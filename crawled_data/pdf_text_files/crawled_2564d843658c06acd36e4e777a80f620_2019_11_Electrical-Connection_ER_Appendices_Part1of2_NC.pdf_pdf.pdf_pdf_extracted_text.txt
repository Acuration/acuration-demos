Introduction
1.1 
Screening the Need for EIA
1.1.1 
This Supporting Information Report has been prepared on the behalf of Abergelli Power
Limited (APL). This Report sets out detailed information in relation to a to a forthcoming
planning application for an Electrical Connection from the proposed Abergelli Power
Station to the existing Swansea North substation (hereafter referred to as the “Electrical
Connection”). The location of the Electrical Connection can be viewed on Figure 1: Site
Location and Layout Plan.
1.1.2 
A screening opinion is requested pursuant to Regulation 6(1) of the Town and Country
Planning (Environmental Impact Assessment) (Wales) Regulations 2017 (the ‘EIA
Regulations’) (1) from the City and County of Swansea Council (CCS) regarding the need
for an Environmental Impact Assessment (EIA) for the Electrical Connection.
1.2 
Background
1.2.1 
APL proposes to construct and operate an Open Cycle Gas Turbine (“OCGT”) peaking
power generating station (the "Power Generation Plant") and new connections to the gas
and electricity networks on land adjacent to the Felindre Gas Compressor Station at
Abergelli Farm, Felindre, Swansea SA5 7NN (the “Project”).
1.2.2 
APL's project is split into three different elements which are described below, which
together form the "Abergelli Power Project".  These elements are referred to as the Power
Generation Plant, the Gas Connection, and the Electrical Connection.
1.2.3 
The three main elements of the Project comprise:
 
An Open Cycle Gas Turbine (OCGT) peaking power generating station, fuelled by
natural gas and capable of providing a rated electrical output of up to 299 Megawatts
(MW). The Power Generation Plant comprises:
o 
Generating Equipment including one Gas Turbine Generator with one exhaust
gas flue stack and Balance of Plant (BOP) (together referred to as the
“Generating Equipment”) which are located within the “Generating Equipment
Site”;
o 
An Access Road to the Project Site from the B4489 which lies to the west,
formed by upgrading an existing access road between the B4489 junction and
the Swansea North Substation (the “Substation”) and constructing a new section
of access road from the Substation to the Generating Equipment Site; and
o 
A temporary construction compound for the storage of materials, plant and
equipment as well as containing site accommodation and welfare facilities,
temporary car parking and temporary fencing (the “Laydown Area”). A small area
within the Laydown Area will be retained permanently (the “Maintenance
Compound”).
 
o 
Ecological Mitigation Area – area for ecological enhancement within the Project 
Site Boundary    
 
o 
Permanent parking and drainage to include: a site foul, oily water and surface 
water drainage system.

 
A Gas Connection in the form of a new Above Ground Installation (AGI) and 
underground gas connection (the “Gas Pipeline”) to bring natural gas to the 
Generating Equipment from the National Gas Transmission System; and 
 
 
An Electrical Connection in the form of a new underground electrical cable to export 
power from the Generating Equipment to the National Grid Electricity Transmission 
System (NETS).  
1.2.4 
The Electrical Connection is the focus of this Request for Screening Opinion.  
1.3 
Development Consent under the Planning Act 2008 
1.3.1 
Power Generation Plant 
1.3.2 
The Power Generation Plant described above would have a rated electrical output of up to 
299 MW of electricity and is therefore classified as a Nationally Significant Infrastructure 
Project (“NSIP”) under section 15 of the Planning Act 2008 (as amended) (“PA 2008”).   
1.3.3 
As such, APL is applying to the Secretary of State (“SoS”) for Business, Energy and 
Industrial Strategy under section 31 of the PA 2008 for a Development Consent Order 
(“DCO”) for powers to construct, operate and maintain the Power Generation Plant. The 
DCO Application was submitted on 25th May, 2018. 
1.3.4 
Associated Development 
1.3.5 
The Gas Connection and Electrical Connection comprise development associated with the 
NSIP (“associated development”).   
1.3.6 
The PA 2008 restricts associated development for which consent can be sought under a 
DCO in Wales to development that is associated with a generating station with a capacity 
in excess of 350 MW.  As the Power Generation Plant would have rated electrical output of 
up to 299 MW, associated development to the Power Generation Plant cannot be included 
in any application for DCO under the PA 2008.  The application for a DCO therefore only 
includes the Power Generation Plant and related mitigation as "authorised development" 
and does not seek development consent for the Gas Connection or the Electrical 
Connection. 
1.4 
Town and Country Planning Act 1990  
1.4.1 
APL is seeking for planning permission for the Gas Connection under the Town and 
Country Planning Act 1990 ("TCPA 1990").  
a) Abergelli Power Project Environmental Statement  
1.4.2 
The Abergelli Power Project is a Schedule 1 development as it is a thermal generating 
station with a heat output of 300 MW or more as listed in Schedule 1, paragraph 2(1) of the 
Infrastructure Planning (Environmental Impact Assessment) Regulations 2009. As such, an 
EIA has been carried out in respect of the development.  
1.4.3 
Therefore, although the Electrical Connection has not previously been screened to 
determine the need for an EIA, the environmental impacts associated with the Electrical 
Connection have been assessed within the Abergelli Power Project Environmental 
Abergelli – Electrical Connection Screening Report

Statement (ES). Though the Gas and Electrical Connections are not included in the DCO 
Application, the Connections were included within the EIA to avoid the risk of overlooking 
potentially significant environmental impacts through segregating the Abergelli Power 
Project into component parts, often referred to as ‘salami-slicing’. 
1.4.4 
Mitigation has been identified within the EIA carried out for the Abergelli Power Project 
which is applicable to the Electrical Connection. This mitigation includes both embedded 
mitigation (mitigation inherent in to the design of the Project and also specifically to the 
Electrical Connection), or additional mitigation (which is required to mitigate any residual 
adverse effects of the Project). This has been identified in this request for Screening 
Opinion for clarity where appropriate.  
1.5 
The Developer 
1.5.1 
The Applicant is APL, an energy development company established for the Abergelli Power 
Project and owned by Drax Group plc (Drax). 
1.5.2 
Drax is responsible for generating 6% of the UKs electricity, predominantly via Drax power 
station in Selby.  Drax is one of the UK’s largest energy producers and is committed to 
helping to reduce carbon emissions, displacing more coal off the system and providing 
additional system support to plug the gaps created by intermittent renewables and boost 
security of supply.  
1.5.3 
Drax acquired APL from Watt Power Limited (Watt Power) in 2016. Stag Energy 
Development Company Ltd (Stag Energy) previously provided management services to 
Watt Power in relation to APL. Stag Energy continues to provide resources to APL through 
a management services agreement. Stag Energy was founded in 2002 and the company 
draws on a depth of experience within a team that has created and delivered over 10,000 
MW of power generation and related infrastructure projects across the globe, of which 
2,500 MW has been delivered in the UK. 
1.5.4 
APL is committed to the development of assets to support the UK Government’s drive to a 
low carbon economy.  APL recognises the need to balance commercial issues with the 
environmental benefits and concerns relating to energy projects and believes this balance 
can be responsibly delivered. The Electrical Connection as part of the Abergelli Power 
Project will be designed and developed to high quality, safety and environmental 
standards.

Section 6 presents the Report conclusions.
1.6.2 
An EIA Screening Matrix has been completed for the Electrical Connection and is included
in Appendix 1 of this Report. A Mitigation Register has been prepared that outlines all the
embedded and additional mitigation which has been identified to avoid, reduce or remedy
any significant residual effects from the Project as a whole, but specifically for the Electrical
Connection. The Mitigation Register is included in Appendix 2 of this Report and has been
abbreviated from the wider Abergelli Power Project Mitigation Register for the mitigation
required for the Electrical Connection. This is cross-referenced throughout this Report for
consistency and ease of reference.
1.6.3 
The Report summarises the environmental assessments conducted as part of the Abergelli
Power Project ES and provides technical conclusions based on those assessments in
relation to the likely significant effects of the Electrical Connection.
2. 
Project Description
2.1.1 
The Electrical Connection will enable power to be exported from the Abergelli Power
Station to the National Grid Electricity Transmission System (NETS). The connection will
be approximately 900 metre (m) in length. It will consist of a 400 kilovolt (kV) underground
cable to the Substation and associated works inside the Substation to connect to a gas-
insulated switchgear (GIS) bay. The GIS bay will be consented and owned by National Grid
with APL providing and installing a 400 kV cable for termination into the GIS bay as well as
installing feeder protection and settlement metering for the GIS Bay.
2.1.2 
The Substation is proposed to be extended by National Grid at the eastern end of the
building to house the GIS bay. National Grid is responsible for securing any necessary
planning permissions for this work and therefore this is not considered as part of this
project description or application.
2.1.3 
The Electrical Connection route (see Figure 1: Site Location and Layout Plan) will 
run immediately adjacent to the alignment of the new section of Access Road for the 
Abergelli Power Project. At the eastern extent, the Electrical Connection leaves the 
Abergelli Power Project Generating Equipment Site, passing underground through open 
land to the east and southeast of the National Grid Gas Transmission System. The route 
crosses into National Grid’s land to the east of tower 4YW251 heading towards the Sub-
station. Once within National Grid’s land the Electrical Connection turns to the north-west 
to run outside the Substation and parallel with the Substation fence line. The Electrical 
Connection then turns into the Substation close to the northern corner.
2.1.4 
The Electrical Connection passes twice under one 400 kV overhead lattice tower mounted
transmission line and once under one wooden pole mounted 11 kV overhead distribution
line. The route crosses two ditches and a Local Transmission System pipeline within the
field to the east of tower 4YW251. The Electrical Connection will be drilled (for example
using drilling techniques such as Horizontal Directional Drill (HDD)) under the Water Main
and Oil Pipeline with at least 2 m clearance from the underside of the Water Main.
a) Construction
2.1.5 
The Electrical Connection will be constructed within the curtilage of the new section of
Access Road within a 5 m working width adjacent to the road. A cable duct will be installed
adjacent to the new section of Access Road to allow the cable to be pulled through at a
Abergelli – Electrical Connection Screening Report

later date. Short sections of open cut trench will be required at either end of the cable route 
where it does not coincide with the Access Road. The installation of the cable within the 
Substation is anticipated to be in cable ducts, although National Grid has recently started 
using direct buried cables within the Substation. 
2.1.6 
The Electrical Connection will require temporary bridges (for example a temporary bailey 
bridge) over the Water Main and Oil Pipeline during the construction phase to enable 
access from the new section of Access Road and Laydown Area. The temporary bailey 
bridge will approximately 5 m in height from the anchor points on the existing ground level. 
b) Operation and Maintenance 
2.1.7 
No regular maintenance is anticipated to be carried out on the underground electrical 
cable. Maintenance of the electrical cable will be limited to repair in the event of a fault in 
the cable, in which case the cable will be isolated for repair in line with industry good 
practice. 
2.1.8 
The electrical equipment would be subject to periodic inspection. To perform such 
inspections, pedestrian access is adequate.  
2.1.9 
The route would be regularly checked to ensure that there are no excavation or 
construction works in the direct vicinity of the cables, that mounds of soil are not deposited 
above the cables and that trees are not planted above the cables; this should normally 
require little more than a drive past. 
2.1.10 
In addition, periodic inspection of any above ground equipment associated with the cable 
system would be required. The above ground equipment would include cable terminations, 
and structures, and bonding system link housings; this would require access to the 
equipment. In some case dirt and debris can deposit on cable termination insulators which 
may therefore require cleaning. It is also recommended that the integrity of the cable 
oversheath be tested at least once every two to three years; this would require access to 
the cable terminations and the bonding system link housings. In the event that the 
oversheath is found degraded or damaged then a repair may be required which would 
necessitate some excavation along the cable route (in most cases, oversheath damage 
results from the actions of third parties). 
c) Decommissioning 
2.1.11 
It is assumed that the Electrical Connection would be decommissioned after 25 years, 
which is the design life of the Power Generation Plant. However, it is important to note that 
elements of the Connection (such as the GIS bay) would be owned and operated by 
National Grid. In accordance with its statutory duties, National Grid may use these assets 
in the future as part of its wider network.  
2.1.12 
As such, though the date of decommissioning of some elements of the Electrical 
Connection cannot be certain, a 25 year working assumption has been used to allow for a 
reasonable assessment of decommissioning effects in this Report.  
2.1.13 
Finally, it is assumed that elements of the Electrical Connection may be left in situ at the 
point of decommissioning, as this approach is likely to cause less environmental effects 
than removal.

d) Embedded Mitigation 
2.1.14 
Mitigation which is either implicit in the design of the Electrical Connection or its 
construction and operation through standard control measures routinely used, such as 
working within best practice guidance during construction, is known as embedded 
mitigation. The embedded mitigation implemented on the Electrical Connection is 
summarised as follows but is outlined in greater detail within the Mitigation Register in 
Appendix 2 (using the notation for ease of reference): 
 
Production of an Outline Construction Environment Management Plan (CEMP) (ref 
GEN01) which includes waste management (OE01); 
 
Production of an Outline Landscape & Ecology Mitigation Strategy (LEMS) (GEN02); 
 
Management of dust and air quality mitigation (AQ01 – AQ04); 
 
Management of noise, noise generation and vibration management (N01 – N08); 
 
Protection of sensitive habitats, sensitive ecological features, protected species and 
designated sites (E01 – E03); 
 
Production of an Outline Surface Water Management Plan (WQ01), surface water 
management (WQ04) and drainage (WQ06 and WQ09); 
 
Protection of groundwater and hydrogeology features, peat management, identification 
and management of unexpected contamination(G01 – G03); 
 
Landscape and visual mitigation from Public Rights of Way (PRoW) and other amenity 
viewpoints (LV01); 
 
Production of a Construction Traffic Management Plan (CTMP) (including safety, 
severance and traffic management such as speed restrictions) in addition to a 
Construction Staff Travel Plan (CSTP) (T03 – T05); and 
 
Archaeological investigation including a Written Scheme of Investigation (WSI) (CH01 
and CH02) 
 
2.1.15 
This embedded mitigation applies to the Electrical Connection and has been assumed for 
this Supporting Information Report to be in place from the outset. The assessments 
included in this Report therefore consider the likely significant effects of the Electrical 
Connection including embedded mitigation.   
2.1.16 
Any required additional mitigation is set out within the relevant assessment in Section 5 of 
this Report and cross referenced within the Mitigation Register in Appendix 2. The 
management plans committed to as embedded mitigation are also referenced where 
relevant.  
3. 
Determining the Need for EIA 
3.1 
EIA Regulations 
3.1.1 
All development in Schedule 1 of the EIA Regulations requires an EIA. Development in 
column 1 of the table in schedule 2, which is either to be carried out in a sensitive area or 
satisfies a threshold or criterion in Column 2 of that table (‘Schedule 2 development’) 
requires EIA if it is likely to have significant effects on the environment. 
3.1.2 
The Electrical Connection does not constitute an EIA Development as underground cables 
are not listed in either Schedule 1 or 2 of the EIA Regulations. Therefore in isolation the 
Electrical Connection would not require an EIA.

3.1.3 
The Electrical Connection is a constituent part of the Abergelli Power Project, which is an 
EIA Development, and its effects (including those from the Electrical Connection) are fully 
assessed in the Environmental Statement that accompanies the DCO Application. 
However, whilst the laying of electrical cable is not listed in Schedule 1 or Schedule 2 of 
the EIA Regulations, for completeness and to ensure a robust approach, the potential 
environmental impacts of the Electrical Connection have been assessed in this Report. 
3.1.3 
The existing site conditions of the Electrical Connection and surrounding area are 
discussed in Section 4.  
3.1.4 
The potential environmental effects relating to the Electrical Connection, as identified in the 
Abergelli Power Project ES are summarised in Section 5 with an overview in Section 5.13. 
A Screening Matrix has also been completed and is included in Appendix 1 of this Report.  
4. 
Site Description 
4.1 
Electrical Connection Location 
4.1.1 
The Electrical Connection (see Figure 1) is located on open agricultural land approximately 
2 kilometres (km) north of Junction  46 on the M4, approximately 3 km to the north of the 
city of Swansea, 1 km southeast of Felindre and 1.4 km north of Llangyfelach. The current 
land use is improved grazing for sheep and horses on poor quality agricultural land 
(Agricultural Land Classification Grade 4).   
4.1.2 
The western extent of the Electrical Connection encompasses parts of the Swansea North 
Substation (‘Substation’) (comprising a 400 kilovolt (kV) and 132 kV substation) and the 
existing access road leading to the Substation and Felindre Gas Compressor Station from 
the B4489. There are no residential dwellings located along the Electrical Connection.   
4.1.3 
Ground levels vary from approximately 85 m above ordnance datum (AOD) at the highest 
point to the east and approximately 80 m AOD along the southern extent, with ground 
levels generally falling in a southerly and south easterly direction. The CCS Unitary 
Development Plan (UDP) Proposals Map (Ref.4.1) identifies mineral deposits within the 
Site including coal and sand and aggregates. There is a groundwater body below the 
Electrical Connection of poor current and projected Water Framework Directive (Ref.4.2) 
status.  
4.1.4 
The Electrical Connection coincides with an area classified as Ancient Woodland as the 
route enters the Substation. This is part of a wider area of Ancient Woodland surrounding 
the Substation and Felindre Gas Compressor Station, and the existing access road leading 
to these facilities from the B4489. The woodland is also partially within the Lletty-Morfil Site 
of Nature Conservation Interest (SINC) (no. 106), which is adjacent to the Site to the north. 
4.1.5 
The Electrical Connection crosses two drainage ditches that discharge into the Afon Llan. 
The Afon Llan links with the Afon Lliw and the River Loughor, which discharges into 
Carmarthen Bay through Bury Inlet, 7 km west of the Abergelli Power Station Site. 
Carmarthen bay and estuaries is designated as a Special Area for Conservation (SAC) and 
Bury Inlet is designated as a Special Protection Area (SPA), Site of Special Scientific 
Interest (SSSI) and as a wetland of international importance under the Ramsar 
Convention. There are no Main Rivers within the boundary of the Electrical Connection.

Surrounding Area
4.2.1 
The area surrounding the Electrical Connection is, at present, predominantly rural in
character, although there is the Felindre Park and Ride facility to the south and a
substantial amount of utility infrastructure in the area, some of which the Electrical
Connection will cross.
4.2.2 
The National Gas Transmission System, a Water Main and the Oil Pipeline cross the
Electrical Connection and there is also a network of electricity pylons, underground utilities
and overhead lines which lead to and from the Substation. The Felindre Water Treatment
Works is located to the northwest, while the Cefn Betingau Solar Park and Abergelli Solar
Farm are located to the east of the Electrical Connection. A further three solar parks are
built in the vicinity; Lletty-Morfil Solar Farm, Brynwhilach Solar Park and Gelliwern Isaf
Solar Park.
4.2.3 
Other features of the area include public footpaths, bridleways and tracks that link the
Electrical Connection to the wider area. Of particular note is the LC117 which crosses the
Electrical Connection at its western end. There are a number of residential properties
between 600 m and 875 m from the Electrical Connection. These include Cefn-betingau to
the east, Feline Wen Farm and Llwynhelig to the south east, Maes-eglwys to the south,
and Lletty-Morfil Farm to the west and Abergelli Farm to the north west.
4.2.4 
There is a paintball activity centre located to the west of the Electrical Connection off the
B4889. Other tourist attractions and resources include the Cwm Clydach Nature Reserve
woodland and nature reserve at Clydach, 3 km east of the Electrical Connection and the
National Cycle Route 43, which passes through Clydach on route to Swansea from Builth
Wells.
4.2.5 
In addition to the Lletty-Morfil SINC, there is another SINC, Rhos Fawr (no.316), 1 km
north of the Electrical Connection across the Rhyd-Y-Pandy road. The Rhyd-Y-Pandy
SINC (no. 315) is 850 m to the north east and Waun Garn Wen SINC (no. 105) 400 m to
the north.  There is also a Wildlife Trust Reserve (Coed Barcud) to the north east and an
area of Ancient Woodland 150 m to the north.  The Mawr Uplands Special Landscape Area
(SLA) is located within 5 km of the Electrical Connection, extending from the north-west
round to the east.
4.2.6 
The remains of Abergelli Colliery are located north of Abergelli Farmhouse. The
environmental features and designations along the Electrical Connection and in the
surrounding area are set out on the attached Figure 2: Constraints Plan.
4.3 
Area Sensitivity
4.3.1 
In summary, the Electrical Connection is currently low value agricultural land. Although
there are some mineral deposits within the Electrical Connection, these are not in high
demand or of especially high quality. There are ancient woodlands around the Electrical
Connection and some locally designated habitat. As such the Electrical Connection is
classified as having low environmental sensitivity based on the criteria contained in
Schedule 3 of the EIA Regulations (Ref.4.1).

Assessment of the Electrical Connection 
5.1.1 
The following sections set out a summary of the environmental impact assessment of the 
Electrical Connection which has been undertaken for the Abergelli Power Project and 
informs this request for Screening Opinion. The results are summarised by environmental 
technical topic and phase of the development. Section 5.13 provides an overview of the 
anticipated effects, proposed mitigation and significance.   
5.1.2 
The operational lifetime of the Electrical Connection is assumed to be 25 years for the 
purpose of the assessments. As it is likely that the Electrical Connection will be partially or 
fully left in place at the end of the operational period, few effects are anticipated during the 
decommissioning phase. The sections below discuss decommissioning only when effects 
are anticipated from the Electrical Connection being left in situ.    
5.2 
Air Quality 
a) Construction  
5.2.1 
The sensitivity of the human receptors to the Electrical Connection is classed as low in 
terms of both nuisance and health impacts as the closest residential receptors are 600 m 
from activities onsite. In relation to ecology the sensitivity is classed as low as the only 
ecological sites close to dust generating activities, Lletty-Morfil SINC and an area of 
Ancient Woodland, are locally designated and not considered to be sensitive to dust 
deposition.  
5.2.2 
The dust emission potential for construction of the Electrical Connection is assessed as 
being small during earthworks and construction considering that the earthworks are 
confined to small area and construction emissions will be moderated by the largely 
prefabricated nature of the installation. Emissions from trackout have a small dust potential 
due to the number of vehicles operating and the fact there will be minimal amount of 
excavation/trenching needed. There is no demolition associated with this phase of the 
works. 
5.2.3 
Table 5.1 sets out the assessment of dust emission class from demolition activities, 
earthworks, construction and trackout as a function of the works associated with the 
Electrical Connection.

the nearest receptors to assess the risk of effects associated with the construction phase of 
the Electrical Connection with no embedded or additional mitigation. Table 5.1 shows the 
risk of effects with no mitigation is Negligible in terms of human health, nuisance and 
ecological impacts. Impacts are therefore anticipated to be Not Significant. 
5.2.5 
Although no significant effects are anticipated, even without mitigation, good practice dust 
management will be set out within the Outline CEMP, GEN01 of the Mitigation Register 
(Appendix 2). 
b) Operational  
5.2.6 
No impacts on air quality are anticipated from the operation of the Electrical Connection.  
5.3 
Noise & Vibration 
5.3.1 
A worst case assessment of the potential noise and vibration effects from the Electrical 
Connection has been undertaken for identified noise sensitive receptors (NSRs). The 
NSRs for the Electrical Connection are listed in Table 5.3 and are comprised of the 
residential properties surrounding the Electrical Connection as detailed in Section 4.2. 
a) Baseline 
5.3.2 
The baseline sound levels summarised in Table 5.2 were measured by AECOM in 
February 2018. The monitoring method used was in line with the requirements of BS 
4142:2014 (Ref.5.2). Access could only be obtained to four of the six NSRs. Unattended 
loggers were installed at NSRs 1, 4, 5 and 6 over a period of six days and were located 
within the property boundary of each NSR following prior agreement with the residents. 
5.3.3 
It was not possible to place loggers at NSRs 2 and 3, even though attempts were made to 
locate and contact the residents both prior to and during the monitoring period. However 
the four locations that were used cover the major compass directions from the Electrical 
Connection and include the two closest receptors (1 and 6).  Therefore the lack of 
monitoring data from NSRs 2 and 3 does not impact the comprehensiveness or validity of 
the assessments and conclusions on the impacts and effects on NSRs 2 and 3 can be 
drawn from application of professional judgement to the results for the other four NSRs.

The predicted indicative construction noise levels for the Electrical Connection are given in 
Table 5.3 below.

5.3.5 
The predicted indicative construction noise levels range between 31 and 46 equivalent 
continuous level decibels (LAeq, T dB). This is lower than the lowest observable adverse 
effect level (LOAEL) as derived from British Standard (BS) 5228:2009 of 65 LAeq,T dB for 
day time, 55 LAeq,T dB for evenings and weekends and 45 LAeq,T dB for night time.  
5.3.6 
Therefore the magnitude of impact is assessed to be very low at all of the NSRs. The 
sensitivity of all residential receptors is assessed to be high as they are susceptible to 
noise and vibration. Therefore the significance of effects, is predicted to be Negligible at 
all NSRs, and is therefore considered Not Significant. 
5.3.7 
No additional mitigation is proposed however good practice noise management is 
considered within the Outline CEMP, GEN01 of the Mitigation Register (Appendix 2). 
b) Operational  
5.3.8 
Once operational the Electrical Connection will not generate any noise or vibration impacts.  
5.4 
Ecology  
a) Construction  
i. 
Habitat Loss 
5.4.1 
The construction in the Electricity Connection will result in the temporary loss of:  
 
0.36 metres squared (m2) (<0.01%) of Lletty-Morfil SINC comprising broadleaved 
semi-natural woodland; 
 
54 m2 of dense/continuous scrub; 
 
Up to 15 m of the row of trees habitat designated as ancient woodland; 
 
0.07 hectares (ha) of semi-improved neutral grassland; and 
 
0.15 ha of marshy grassland. 
5.4.2 
There may also potential be the loss of up to one standalone tree.  
Abergelli – Electrical Connection Screening Report 
 
   
 
 
 
 
 
Prepared for:  Abergelli Power Limited 
 
AECOM 
14 
 
5.4.3 
The significance of the effect on these habitats is considered Negligible and therefore Not 
Significant given the small areas affected.  
ii. Species 
5.4.4 
The impact on the species present at the Electrical Connection has been assessed and is 
summarised as follows:  
 
The loss or temporary removal of habitat has the potential for Minor Adverse impacts 
on invertebrates, amphibians, reptiles and bats;  
 
Construction activities relating to the Electrical Connection also have the potential to 
disrupt breeding birds, the significance of which would also be Minor Adverse;  
 
Construction works in or near water courses could have an impact of Minor Adverse 
significance on otter through direct harm;  
 
Additional, species specific, mitigation has been identified where required as set out in 
E04 and E09 – E20 of the Mitigation Register (Appendix 2); 
 
Mitigation will also be set out within the Outline CEMP and the Outline LEMS  GEN01 
and GEN02 of the Mitigation Register (Appendix 2); including measures relating to 
lighting, habitat protection and habitat reinstatement; 
5.4.5 
Therefore impacts are considered Not Significant.  
b) Operational  
5.4.6 
No operational effect on Ecology has been identified.  
5.5 
Water Quality and Resources 
a) Construction  
i. 
Water Quality and Resources 
5.5.1 
The principal risks of the construction works to water quality and resources comprise: 
 
Pollution impacts on surface watercourses and groundwater associated with: 
o Increased sediment loads in site runoff containing elevated suspended sediment 
levels disturbed during site clearance; 
o The release of hydrocarbons and oils due to a large number of vehicles 
accessing the site, leakages from temporary oil/fuel storage tanks and accidental 
spillages; and 
o Accidental leaks of hazardous materials, such as concrete and cement products, 
which can be contained in uncontrolled wash-down water and surface water 
runoff;  
o Dewatering of excavations and the discharge of potentially polluted/high 
sediment loading water to the water receptors; and 
o Pollution from dust and debris. 
5.5.2 
Good practice management measures for the reduction and control of water pollution 
including works near water will be set out in the Surface Water Management Plan and 
Drainage Strategy, WQ01 of the Mitigation Register (Appendix 2). No additional mitigation 
measures have been proposed.  
5.5.3 
Surface water runoff from the Electrical Connection will be conveyed to the tributaries of 
the Afon Llan River to the east. There is potential for hydraulic connectivity (most likely 
Abergelli – Electrical Connection Screening Report 
 
   
 
 
 
 
 
Prepared for:  Abergelli Power Limited 
 
AECOM 
15 
 
through shallow groundwater) and therefore for some runoff to migrate to the Lletty-Morfil, 
Waun Garn Wen and Rhos Fawr SINCs. Surface water runoff from the Electrical 
Connection may also infiltrate and migrate further afield via groundwater. The tributary to 
the Afon Llan, the SINCs and the groundwater at the Electrical Connection are all classified 
as having medium sensitivity.  
5.5.4 
Given the limited scope of the Electrical Connection works and the measures to be 
implemented through the Outline CEMP (GEN01) and the Outline Surface Water 
Management Plan (WQ01 of the Mitigation Register, Appendix 2), the magnitude of the 
potential construction water quality and resources effects are Negligible. Accordingly, the 
significance of effects is assessed to be Negligible and Not Significant. 
ii.  Flooding 
Watercourse Crossings 
5.5.5 
The Electrical Connection crosses two field drains. One of the drains will be culverted or 
bridged for a short length for the new section of Access Road. This would be designed to 
allow flow up to the 1 in 100 year return period. The Electrical Connection will be laid within 
the curtilage of the new section of Access Road across the bridge or culvert.  
5.5.6 
The crossing method for the second drain will be informed by post-consent ground 
investigation surveys. Trenchless techniques such as horizontal direction drilling (HDD) will 
be considered.  
5.5.7 
The sensitivity of the watercourse crossings as a flood risk receptor is considered to be 
Negligible since the Electrical Connection is in a very low flood risk area.  The magnitude of 
the impact is considered to be Low. The significance of the permanent effect is therefore 
considered to be Negligible, and Not significant. 
b) Operational  
5.5.8 
For water quality and resources and flooding, no impact is expected to arise from the 
Electrical Connection location during the operational phase.  
5.6 
Geology, Ground Conditions and Hydrogeology 
a) Construction  
i. 
Geology and Soils: Sand and Gravel Reserves 
5.6.1 
Sand and gravel reserves were identified within the Electrical Connection area on the UDP 
Proposals Map (Ref.4.1).  
5.6.2 
The Electrical Connection will be routed adjacent to the Felindre Gas Compressor Station 
and the Substation, and adjacent to the new section of Access Road. Therefore the land is 
already sterilised in this area. The sand and gravels reserves are considered to be of low 
sensitivity due to minimal economic use. The magnitude of the impact is assessed as low, 
as while there will be permanent sterilisation of the reserves, a relatively small area of the 
reserves will be affected compared to the full extent.  The significance of the effects is 
therefore considered to be Minor adverse, which is Not Significant. No additional 
mitigation is proposed.

AECOM 
16 
 
ii. Geology and Soils: Coal Reserves 
5.6.3 
The UDP Proposals Map indicates that coal reserves are present underlying the Electrical 
Connection (Ref.4.1). These coal reserves are considered to be of low sensitivity due to 
minimal economic use. Given that the majority of the Electrical Connection route is already 
sterilised and a relatively small area of the coal reserves will be affected compared to the 
full extent, the magnitude of the impact is assessed as low.  The significance of the effects 
is therefore considered to be Minor adverse, which is Not Significant. No additional 
mitigation is proposed.     
iii. Agricultural Land 
5.6.4 
The construction works associated with the Electrical Connection will result in the direct, 
local and permanent sterilisation of approximately 0.33 ha of Grade 4 agricultural land. 
Grade 4 land is defined as land with severe limitations that significantly restrict the range of 
crops and / or level of yield. Therefore the sensitivity of the agricultural land is considered 
to be Negligible and the magnitude also Negligible due to the limited extent of the impact. 
The significance of effect is therefore considered to be Negligible, which is Not 
Significant. No additional mitigation is proposed.     
b) Operational  
i. 
Geology and Soil 
5.6.5 
The geology and soils are considered to be of low sensitivity and the magnitude of the 
impact is therefore considered to be low. Operation and maintenance is anticipated to have 
a Minor adverse effect on the geology and soils present at the Electrical Connection as 
the potential impact will have occurred during the construction phase, which is Not 
Significant. No additional mitigation is proposed.  
ii. Structures 
5.6.6 
There is potential for long term chemical attack on the underground cable ducts during the 
operational and decommissioning phase. Chemical compounds such as sulphate and pH 
levels in natural ground or polluted ground can cause damage to sub surface structures. 
The sensitivity of the structures is assessed as high as the receptor has low ability to 
absorb change without fundamentally altering its character. Pre-construction ground 
investigation has been committed to as embedded mitigation to identify ground conditions 
and potential contaminants (G03 of the Mitigation Register Appendix 2). The Electrical 
Connection will be built to industry safety standards and meet legislative requirements for 
safe operation to protect the installed equipment from chemical attack. Therefore the 
magnitude of effect is considered to be Negligible. The significance of the effects has 
therefore been assessed as Minor adverse, which is Not Significant. No additional 
mitigation is proposed.

Landscape and Visual Effects 
5.7.1 
The landscape and visual effects have been assessed for the Electrical Connection as a 
component part of the Abergelli Power Project.  
a) Construction  
Landscape 
5.7.2 
The Electrical Connection route will run immediately adjacent to the alignment of the new 
section of Access Road. The construction activity and plant associated with the Electrical 
Connection alone will only result in localised and limited effects to the landscape character 
resulting in a small loss of woodland and hedgerow planting, which will not affect the 
integrity or key characteristics of the landscape. Magnitude of change will be Low, which 
combined with the Medium sensitivity will result in a Minor adverse effect on the 
landscape character, which is Not Significant. No additional mitigation is proposed, but 
good practice landscape and visual management measures will be included within the 
Outline CEMP and LEMS, GEN01 and GEN02 of the Mitigation Register (Appendix 2).  
Visual 
5.7.3 
There will be no significant effects on views as a result of construction of the Electrical 
Connection. 
b) Operational  
5.7.4 
Once operational there will be no significant visual effects or effects on the landscape 
character as a result of the Electrical Connection. 
5.8 
Traffic, Transport and Access 
a) Construction  
i. 
Traffic Generation 
5.8.1 
The construction of the Electrical Connection is estimated to take place alongside and 
within the period of construction of the Abergelli Power Project Generating Equipment. The 
peaks in construction staff traffic and Heavy Good Vehicle (HGV) traffic for the Electrical 
Connection are shown for the weekday AM and PM peak hours and 24-hour period in

ii. Traffic Flows 
5.8.2 
The impact of the predicted traffic arising from the construction of the Electrical Connection 
on the traffic flows of local traffic links has been assessed.  
5.8.3 
The links assessed included sections of the Pant Lasau Road, the B4489, the A48 and the 
M4. The links were assed to range from very low to high sensitivity. The percentage 
change between 2020 predicted baseline traffic flows and the baseline plus all predicted 
Electrical Connection construction traffic was between 0 and 4%, with a Negligible to Low 
magnitude of change. Accordingly the significance is Negligible and therefore Not 
Significant. No additional mitigation is proposed however traffic management will be 
covered within a CTMP and CSTP, T03 – T05 of the Mitigation Register (Appendix 2).   
iii. Driver Delay 
5.8.4 
An assessment of the Electrical Connection construction traffic on driver delay was also 
conducted. The assessment found that the Electrical Connection will, at worst, have a 
Minor adverse effect in terms of driver delay, which is Not Significant. This effect will be 
temporary in nature, and only experienced during the peak of construction traffic 
movements.  
5.8.5 
No additional mitigation is proposed, but management measures to minimise driver delay 
will be included within a CTMP and CSTP, T03 – T05 of the Mitigation Register (Appendix 
2).    
iv. Severance 
5.8.6 
Only one footpath will be affected by the construction of the Electrical Connection, this is 
the LC117, which routes adjacent to the perimeter of the Felindre Gas Compressor Station. 
The proposed management of the PROW will be set out in the Outline CEMP (GEN01) and 
CTMP T03 of the Mitigation Register (Appendix 2) and will be developed further in 
consultation with the PROW Officer at CCS. 
5.8.7 
It is not proposed to permanently divert the LC117, although measures will be implemented 
to ensure the safety of users. Given the scale and nature of the works associated with the 
Electrical Connection it is likely that there will be little or no hindrance to pedestrian 
movements along the LC117 and therefore effects are anticipated to be Not Significant.  
b) Operational  
5.8.8 
No operational effects on traffic, transport and access have been identified.

5.9 
Historic Environment  
5.9.1 
Construction and operation of the Electrical Connection will not impact on any known 
historic asset. No known historic assets exist within its footprint. 
5.9.2 
A WSI will be prepared and a watching brief will be implemented during construction. In the 
event that any archaeology be discovered during construction it will be excavated, 
recorded and reported in line with the WSI as set out in CH02 of the Mitigation register 
(Appendix 2).  
5.10 
Socio-Economics 
a) Construction  
i. 
Socio-economics 
5.10.1 
The socio-economic assessment of effects considers the Abergelli Power Project as a 
whole as impacts cannot be disaggregated into elements, i.e. Power Generation Plant, 
Gas Connection, and Electrical Connection.  The assessment reviewed employment, gross 
added value, skill requirements, accommodation capacity and labour market absorption 
capacity.  
5.10.2 
At peak construction the estimated number of workers onsite is 122 with a median of 69.5 
(monthly). This constitutes a Low beneficial impact on local construction employment. The 
demand for construction labour arising from the Abergelli Power Project’s development will 
not result in any pressure on labour market capacity as it will require less than 15%1 of 
existing capacity.  These jobs will also be predominantly moderate – high skilled with 
relatively high value and high paid positions that required a high degree of training and 
qualifications.  
5.10.3 
Although likely unnecessary due to the high potential for local workers; 100% of the 
workers could be accommodated without causing pressure or shortages on the local 
accommodation supply.  
5.10.4 
Gross value added (GVA) is a measure of the value of goods and services produced in an 
area, industry or sector of an economy.  Annual construction GVA per head in Wales is 
£76,725.  The construction phase could therefore deliver up to £7.1 million GVA2 to the 
wider economy.   
5.10.5 
The impact on the labour market for the Abergelli Power Project as a whole was assessed 
to be Negligible Beneficial and therefore not significant. As a minor contributing part of the 
Project, the impact of the Electrical Connection can also be assumed to be Not 
Significant.  
ii. Tourism, Recreation and Community 
5.10.6 
No significant effects on tourism, recreation or community infrastructure were identified as 
part of the assessment.  
                                                                                                                     
1 15% threshold based on professional judgement  
2 £76,725 x 92 person years= £7,058,745 (note this is the same as 9.2 FTEs x 10 years continuous employment x £76,725 = £7.1m)

b) Operational  
5.10.7 
Best practice principles outlined in HM Treasury Green Book Appraisal Guidance (Ref.5.4) 
were applied to assess the effect of permanent operational employment.  An Economic 
Impact Model was developed to measure net additional employment and GVA.  Labour 
market capacity, accommodation capacity and skill requirements were again considered.  
5.10.8 
Similar to the construction phase a Negligible effect on the labour market was identified for 
the Abergelli Power Project as a whole. As a minor contributing part of the Project, the 
impact of the Electrical Connection can also be assumed to be Not Significant.  
5.10.9 
No operational impacts were identified for community infrastructure or tourism and 
recreation. 
5.11 
Other Effects 
a) Waste 
5.11.1 
The laying of the Electrical Connection will involve the excavation of a trench or drilling, 
temporary placement of the excavated soil and then backfilling with soil. No surplus waste 
materials are expected to arise from this activity if excavated material is reused onsite, 
which is normal practice.  In the event that material is not suitable for re-use onsite it will be 
managed in accordance with the Site Waste Management Plan (SWMP),which will be 
contained within the Outline CEMP, GEN01 of the Mitigation Register (Appendix 2).  
5.11.2 
No waste is anticipated from the operation of the Electrical Connection.  
b) Electromagnetic Fields 
5.11.3 
An electromagnetic fields (EMF) assessment has been undertaken and an overview of the 
likely significant effects is provided below: 
 
Underground cables, as proposed, do not give rise to electric fields above ground due 
to the shielding effect of the cable sheath.  This is explained in the British Insulated 
Callender's Cables (BICC) Electric Cables Handbook (Ref.5.5).  
 
In 1998, the International Commission on Non-Ionizing Radiation Protection (ICNIRP) 
issued guidelines reference level of 360 micro Tesla (μT) for public exposure (basic 
restriction) to magnetic fields (Ref.5.5). At 1 m above ground The EMF assessment an 
additional 3.1 µT  is predicted from the underground cable, which is considerably lower 
than the ICNIRP guidelines. 
 
The intensity of both electric fields and magnetic fields also diminishes with increasing 
distance from the source. 
 
The above-ground components of the Electrical Connection will also lie within the 
Substation where there are already EMFs present that were considered as part of the 
application for the Substation; they will not make a significant difference to the EMFs 
already present. It should also be noted that the general public will not spend any 
prolonged time in close proximity to the Electrical Connection or to the Substation. 
5.11.4 
The general public will thus not be exposed to any increase in EMFs from the Electrical 
Connection and there will be no significant effects arising from EMFs.

c) Public Health 
5.11.5 
Public health impacts as a result of noise, air quality and pollution or contamination have 
been assessed to be Negligible and therefore Not Significant during construction and 
decommissioning given the Negligible impacts identified for these technical topics 
individually. 
5.11.6 
No operational effects on public health were identified.   
d) Climate Change 
5.11.7 
Climate change impacts have been considered throughout each of the individual technical 
topic impact assessments, where relevant. Climate resilience has therefore been built into 
the design to reduce effects from climate change. 
5.12 
Cumulative  
a) Intra-project Effects 
5.12.1 
For the purpose of this section, consideration will be given to the additive or amplified 
effects resulting from environmental effects on ‘shared receptors’ and also where sources 
of effect from different components of the Abergelli Power Project may combine to be of 
greater significance than when the Electrical Connection considered alone.  
i. 
Shared Receptors  
5.12.2 
Shared receptors from individual elements of the Abergelli Power Project (e.g. construction 
of Power Generation Plant, Gas Connection and Electrical Connection) are likely to be 
limited to nearby residential dwellings.  
5.12.3 
Potential effects at these shared receptors may comprise of the following: 
 
Noise effects;  
 
Views from residential dwellings; 
 
Potential effects on waterbodies and water based receptors from increased risk of 
sediment runoff and polluted discharges during the construction phase; 
 
Traffic effects from increased vehicle numbers during the construction phase; and 
 
Production of dust during the construction phase. 
5.12.4 
Due to the application of embedded and additional mitigation measures (such as the 
avoidance of habitats, the proposed Outline CEMP and topic specific management plans) 
which ensure that likely significant effects on shared receptors are unlikely, or the absence 
of any effects on shared receptors, the following technical topics are scoped out from the 
intra-cumulative assessment:  
 
Ecology - due to the embedded and additional mitigation, there is unlikely to be any 
cumulative effects from multiple components of the Abergelli Power Project working 
simultaneously affecting several species.  
 
Socio-economic - Absence of effects on shared receptors. 
 
Historic Environment – Absence of effects on shared receptors.  
 
Geology, Ground Conditions and Hydrogeology - Absence of effects on shared 
receptors.

ii. Assessment of Potential Intra-project effects 
5.12.5 
Table 5.5 outlines the potential intra-project cumulative effects from the Abergelli Power 
Project. It is considered unlikely that there will be any intra-project effects during operation 
or decommissioning, and so the assessment only considers construction stage effects.

Effects 
Comments 
Residential  
Dust, Noise, 
Traffic, 
Landscape   
Construction of the whole Abergelli Power 
Project will result in construction activity not 
previously present and additional vehicles 
along access routes. This creates an increase 
in traffic flows for all Abergelli Power Project 
components, disruption of views and potential 
production of noise, dust and air pollutants from 
the Abergelli Power Project as a whole during 
the construction period.  
This may have an effect on local communities 
and nearby residential dwellings. As embedded 
and additional mitigation is proposed (such as a 
CTMP and Outline CEMP), this will result in a 
Minor Adverse in-combination effect, which is 
Not Significant. 
 
b) Inter-project Effects 
5.12.6 
The Electrical Connection is considered within the assessment of inter-project effects in the 
Abergelli Power Project ES. Given the integral nature of the Electrical Connection to the 
Abergelli Power Project, it is not considered appropriate to assess the inter-project effects 
of the Electrical Connection in isolation. Segmenting the development has the potential to 
distort the assessment of effects. Therefore inter-project effects are not assessed for the 
Electrical Connection within this Supporting Information Report.

Case Reference 
Abergelli Power Project - Electricity Connection 
Brief description of the project / 
development 
The Electricity Connection will enable power to be exported from 
Abergelli Power Station to the National Grid Electricity Transmission 
System. The connection will be approximately 900 metres (m) in 
length and consist of a 400 kilovolt (kV) underground cable to the 
Substation and associated works inside the Substation to connect to a 
gas-insulated switchgear (GIS) bay. The GIS bay will be consented 
and owned by National Grid with APL providing and installing a 400 
kV cable for termination into the GIS bay as well as installing feeder 
protection and settlement metering for the GIS Bay. National Grid will 
extend the existing Substation building at the eastern end of the 
Substation to house the GIS bay.

Question 
(Part 2a) / (Part 2b) – Answer to the question and explanation of 
reasons 
(Yes/No or Not Known (?) or N/A) 
(Part 3a) / (Part 3b) (only if Yes in part 2a) – Is a Significant Effect 
Likely?  
(Yes/No or Not Known (?) or N/A) 
 
Briefly explain answer to Part 2a and, if applicable and/or known, 
include name of feature and proximity to site 
(If answer in Part 2a / 2b is ‘No’, the answer to Part 3a / 3b is ‘N/A’) 
Is a significant effect likely, having regard particularly to the magnitude 
and spatial extent (including population size affected), nature, intensity 
and complexity, probability, expected onset, duration, frequency and 
reversibility of the impact and the possibility to effectively reduce the 
impact? 
If the finding of no significant effect is reliant on specific features or 
measures of the project envisaged to avoid, or prevent what might 
otherwise have been, significant adverse effects on the environment 
these should be identified in bold. 
1. NATURAL RESOURCES 
1.1 Will construction, operation or 
decommissioning of the project involve actions 
which will cause physical changes in the 
topography of the area? 
No 
The excavated material and topsoil for the Electrical 
Connection trench will be returned to its original position and 
re-seeded to return to current condition. Therefore no physical 
changes to the topography of the area are anticipated. Any 
excess waste generated will be controlled via the Construction 
Environment Management Plan for the Project. 
N/A 
- 
1.2 Will construction or operation of the project use 
natural resources above or below ground such 
as land, soil, water, materials/minerals or 
energy which are non-renewable or in short 
supply? 
No 
The Electrical Connection construction and operation will not 
use natural resources.

Question 
(Part 2a) / (Part 2b) – Answer to the question and explanation of 
reasons 
(Yes/No or Not Known (?) or N/A) 
(Part 3a) / (Part 3b) (only if Yes in part 2a) – Is a Significant Effect 
Likely?  
(Yes/No or Not Known (?) or N/A) 
1.3 Are there any areas on/around the location 
which contain important, high quality or 
scarce resources which could be affected by 
the project, e.g. forestry, agriculture, 
water/coastal, fisheries, minerals? 
Yes 
The current land use is improved grazing for sheep and 
horses on poor quality agricultural land (Agricultural Land 
Classification Grade 4). There are mineral deposits including 
coal and sand and aggregates.  
No 
The agricultural land is not of high quality. In addition, the 
working width will be reinstated.  
As the Electrical Connection will be routed adjacent to the 
Felindre Gas Compressor Station, the Substation and 
adjacent to the new road, sterilisation or constraint of mineral 
deposits would be to a very local spatial extent. Therefore the 
effects are not anticipated to be significant.  
2. WASTE 
2.1 Will the project produce solid wastes during 
construction or operation or decommissioning? Yes 
There is likely to be some waste associated with construction 
such as pipe and cable cuttings and packaging. This is 
expected to be minor.  
No 
Due to the scale and nature of the activities and 
implementation of a Site Waste Management Plan (SWMP) 
within an Outline CEMP, no significant effects from waste 
generation are anticipated. The measures within the SWMP 
will align with the EU Waste Framework Directive, together 
with the Environmental Permitting (England and Wales) 
Regulations 2016 and the Hazardous Waste (England and 
Wales) Regulations 2005 (as amended by the Hazardous 
Waste (England and Wales) Amendment Regulations 2016) 
(OE01 in the Mitigation Register).

Likely?  
(Yes/No or Not Known (?) or N/A) 
3. POLLUTION AND NUISANCES 
3.1 Will the project release pollutants or any 
hazardous, toxic or noxious substances to air? No 
Emissions to air associated with the Electrical Connection is 
associated with construction vehicles bringing materials, 
workers and equipment to site which is expected to be minor 
and localised.  
Dust is likely to be elevated during the construction phase. 
This will be controlled via a CEMP. 
N/A 
- 
3.2 Will the project cause noise and vibration or 
release of light, heat, energy or 
electromagnetic radiation? 
Yes 
Construction of the Electrical Connection will generate noise 
and vibration, which will be controlled via a CEMP. No noise 
or vibration will be caused during operation.  
Underneath power lines, magnetic fields can be around 20 µT, 
which is considerably lower than the ICNIRP guidelines. The 
Electrical Connection will also be underground and will not be 
accessible to the public. No risk from electromagnetic 
radiation has therefore been identified.  
No 
Given the nature of the excavation and installation activities, 
the length of the connection and the distance to any noise 
sensitive receptors, no significant effect is anticipated. 
Construction noise will be controlled through a CEMP, which 
will also contain a protocol for acknowledging and taking 
action on nuisance complaints from the general public. 
Given the low level of magnetic fields expected from the 
Electrical Connection, no significant effects are likely. 
3.3 Will the project lead to risks of contamination of 
land or water from releases of pollutants onto 
the ground or into surface waters, groundwater, 
coastal waters or the sea? 
No 
With good construction practice, implementation of a pollution 
prevention plan within a CEMP (WQ01 in the Mitigation 
Register) and standard operation, no risk of contamination has 
been identified.

3.4 Are there any areas on or around the location 
which are already subject to pollution or 
environmental damage, e.g. where existing 
legal environmental standards are exceeded, 
which could be affected by the project? 
No 
There are areas adjacent, to the north, and outside of the 
Electrical Connection, at Abergelli Farm, including a reinstated 
and historical landfill, a disused colliery and adit and an old 
gravel pit that could potentially be subject to contamination. 
However, the Electrical Connection infrastructure is on 
previously undeveloped, agricultural land, so pre-existing 
contamination and pollution risk is low. APL have committed 
to pre-construction ground investigations that would identify 
ground conditions and potential contaminants (G03 in the 
Mitigation Register). A protocol for the event that unexpected 
contaminated land is identified during construction is also 
included within a CEMP.

be affected by the project? 
 Yes 
A Phase 1 survey has confirmed the presence of scrub, rows 
of and standalone trees, semi-improved grassland, 
hedgerows, standing water and marshy grassland.  The 
habitats present are suitable to support badgers, water vole, 
breeding birds, otters, bats, reptiles and amphibians.  
 No 
With the implementation of embedded mitigation no significant 
effects on these ecological receptors are anticipated. 
Embedded mitigation measures include: 
 
Pre-construction surveys for bats, water voles, otters and 
badgers;  
 
Trapping and translocating of reptiles;  
 
The inclusion of ecological management measures within 
the CEMP such as the management of excavations to 
prevent trapping mammals; and 
 
Reinstatement of habitats and the creation of replacement 
habitats including hedgerows.  
These measures are set out in E09-E16 and E20-E26 of the

high landscape or scenic value on or around 
the location which could be affected by the 
project?
3 Where designated indicate level of 
designation (international, national, regional or 
local). 
Yes 
The Mawr Uplands Scenic Landscape Area (SLA) is within 5 
km of the Electrical Connection.  
No 
The visual effect of the Electrical Connection is limited in 
extent due to the underground nature of the cables. Visual 
amenity effects associated with construction will be temporary. 
In addition, the distance is great enough between the 
Electrical Connection and the SLA that there is unlikely to be 
an effect on visual amenity during construction.

construction/operation phase? 
Yes 
Intra-Project 
Only nearby residential dwellings have been identified as 
shared receptors between the other components of the 
Abergelli Power Project and the Electrical Connection. 
Construction of the Abergelli Power Project will result in 
construction activity not previously present and additional 
vehicles along access routes. This creates an increase in 
traffic flows, disruption of views and potential production of 
noise, dust and air pollutants from construction activities. 
No 
Intra-Project 
No operational cumulative effects are anticipated, but there 
may be dust, noise, traffic and landscape effects during 
construction. These effects will be mitigated through 
embedded mitigation in the form of a CTMP and CEMP (T04 
and GEN01 in the Mitigation Register). No significant effects 
are anticipated.

CONCLUSIONS –  ACCORDING TO EIA REGULATIONS SCHEDULE 3 
The characteristics of the Electrical Connection are such to be unlikely to incur significant adverse environmental effects. The Electrical 
Connection is located on land that will have the capacity to absorb the development without stressing the availability and quality of 
resources. Any impacts are likely to be localised and in most instances, temporary.

visual inspections, ambient air monitoring is undertaken in the vicinity of
high risk sites. This data is required for two reasons: the first relates to
ensuring that mitigation measures are appropriate and being applied

Ensuring that modern plant is used, complying with the latest
European noise emission requirements.  Selection of inherently
quiet plant where possible;
·
Hydraulic techniques for breaking to be used in preference to
percussive techniques where practical;
·
Use of lower noise piling (such as rotary bored or hydraulic
jacking) rather the driven piling techniques (if required), where
possible;
·
Off-site pre-fabrication, where practical;
·
All plant and equipment being used for the works to be properly
maintained, silenced where appropriate, operated to prevent
excessive noise, and switched off when not in use;
·
All contractors to be made familiar with current legislation and the
guidance in BS 5228 (Parts 1 and 2), which should form a
prerequisite of their appointment;
·
Loading and unloading of vehicles, dismantling of site equipment
such as scaffolding or moving equipment or materials around the
Project Site, to be conducted in such a manner as to minimise
noise generation;
·
Appropriate routing of construction traffic on public roads and
along access tracks;
·
Consultation with CCC and local residents to advise of potential
noisy works that are due to take place; and

would be based on regular or fixed measurements close to the Project
Site boundary to give consistency by minimising the impact of weather
and extraneous sources.  The measured levels at these locations must
be calibrated against the levels at the receptors as part of the plant

The Project incorporates welfare facilities which will require a site foul

will be unfeasible to connect to a public sewer. Therefore, a foul water
drainage system will either drain to a septic tank or a package
treatment plant within the Project Site but outside any area at risk of
flooding. It is likely that the latter would be the preferred option for ease
of maintenance and environmental criteria. The processed water would
then discharge on site or to a nearby watercourse in accordance with

It is not expected that it will be possible to connect the surface water

This will be confirmed when the Ground Investigation surveys are
carried out post-consent. Instead the discharged flow of water at the
Generating Equipment Site boundary from the surface water drainage
system will be attenuated in order to maintain the equivalent greenfield
runoff flow for a range of events up to the 1 in 100 year event (with
climate change allowance). The flow will be attenuated using suitably
sized attenuation ponds with restricted discharge pipes to the existing
greenfield runoff rates. An emergency overflow will be provided to the
attenuation ponds to prevent site flooding in the event of an extreme

translocation are outlined below:
·
Any construction areas suitable or known to support reptiles,
including any routes in and out, areas for site compounds, offices or
storage of materials/waste, will be fenced off using suitable fencing
(drift or semi-permanent) to limit individuals attempting to enter the
Project Site from the adjacent land;

No construction activities, including pedestrian access will be
allowed outside of the fencing in areas of habitat suitable for
supporting reptiles.
·

fenced area to attract reptiles;
·
Each day, up to twice a day for a minimum of 60 days an ecologist
will check the refugia for the presence of reptiles;
·
Any reptiles or amphibians found will be captured for relocation to
suitable habitat outside of the fenced areas.
·
After 60 days the trapping can cease once there have been five
consecutive days where no reptiles have been found;
·
After the fenced area has been cleared of reptiles and prior to soil
stripping the vegetation can undergo a process of habitat
management and hand searches for reptiles;

Where possible, roadside swales and infiltration drains will be used to
remove and convey any standing water into the surface water drainage
system from internal roads within the Project Site including the new
Access Road. Where there are space constraints, or there is an
elevated risk of contamination, the new site roads will be kerbed and
drain via road gullies with pollution control measures. It is expected that
roadside swales will discharge to nearby local watercourses at the
existing greenfield runoff rate.

Introduction
1.1
Overview
1.1.1
This Outline Construction Environment Management Plan (CEMP) has been
prepared as part of the Environmental Statement (ES) for Abergelli Power Station
(hereafter referred to as the ‘Project’). This Outline CEMP has been prepared by
AECOM on behalf of the applicant, Abergelli Power Limited (APL).
1.1.2
The Project comprises of an Open Gas Cycle Turbine (OGCT) peaking power
generating station and supporting infrastructure. The Project is described in detail
in Chapter 3: Project and Site Description and its location provided in Figure 1.1
and Figure 1.2 of the ES.
1.2
Purpose of this Document
1.2.1
The purpose of this Outline CEMP is to set out the approach towards, and
framework for, environmental management during the construction phase (including
site preparation) and to provide mitigation against potentially adverse construction
impacts on environmental resources, local residents and businesses. The Outline
CEMP will provide assurance to the decision maker and stakeholders that
appropriate measures for preventing and reducing environmental effects will be
adopted during the construction of the Project and secured via this document. Both
standard environmental good practice and project specific mitigation, as committed
to within the ES are included within this Outline CEMP.
1.2.2
This Outline CEMP covers all elements of the Project as described in Chapter 3:
Project and Site Description of the ES, although some measures will only be
relevant to particular project elements or specific works, and this will be made clear
in the text of the document.
The principles of this Outline CEMP set out the
standards, environmental management and good practice that will also be
consistently applied to the construction of the Gas and Electrical Connections.
1.2.3
Post-consent, this CEMP will require updating in accordance with a Development
Consent Order (DCO) Requirement and will be approved by CCS (in consultation
with Natural Resources Wales) prior to any construction commencing on the
Project Site. The approved CEMP will be used as an environmental management
and monitoring tool for the duration of the construction phase. The CEMP will be
kept on site as a live document, being updated as and when required (for example
to recognise changes in regulations, good practice guidance, actions from on site
audits or a change in situation onsite).
1.2.4
The approved CEMP will fall within the scope of the main contractor’s externally
certified environmental management systems, and as such will be subject to
independent audits by the relevant certification bodies.
1.2.5
Measures set out in this document and the approved CEMP will have regard to the
Welsh Government document ‘Construction and Demolition Sector Plan’ (Ref. 1.1)
Abergelli ES 2018 – Outline Construction Environmental Management Plan
Prepared for: Abergelli Power Limtied
AECOM

which seeks to move towards zero waste by detailing outcomes, policies and
delivery actions for organisations, companies and individuals involved with the
construction and demolition sector in Wales.
a)
Decommissioning
1.2.6
It is anticipated that the environmental effects of the decommissioning of the
Project will be similar in size and nature to those associated with construction. A
detailed decommissioning methodology cannot be finalised until immediately prior
to decommissioning. However the measures and procedures are anticipated to be
similar to those set out within this Outline CEMP and updated to align with industry
good practice guidance at the time of writing.

appropriate personnel as identified by the main contractor(s) in the finalised
CEMP; and
·
Working in accordance with the finalised and approved CEMP and associated
management plans. Protocol to support adherence is set out in the
Communication and Training section (starting paragraph 2.2.2) of this Outline
CEMP.
2.2
Communications and Training
a)
Community Liaison
2.2.1
The following steps will be taken by APL/the main contactor to make the public
aware of the activities onsite and the available lines of communication with the
Project:
·
Neighbouring residents and occupiers will be notified of the start of construction
activities, the likely duration of the construction phase, of any changes to the
working hours as agreed with CCS and of periods when higher levels of noise
may be expected;
·
There will be a community liaison group (CLG) established for facilitation two-
way communication between the public and the Project, which will meet on a
regular basis.
·
A telephone number for environmental complaints will be published local to the
Project Site. There will be a dedicated person responsible for dealing with any
complaints, which could be the Environmental Manager.  This person will have
the appropriate authority to resolve complaints. An ‘out of hours’ telephone
number will be made available if required. A Welsh speaker can be available at
request;
·
Liaison will be maintained with CCS’s Environmental Health Officer (EHO) for
the duration of the construction phase;
·
Should any complaints regarding dust or noise be received the details will be
passed to the EHO for verification purposes; and
·
Should any unforeseen event occur on the Project Site that has the potential to
cause pollution then the relevant regulatory bodies will be notified immediately.
As far as possible, notice will be issued to the EHO for dealing with an
unforeseen activity that may give rise to a particular nuisance problem.
b)
Environmental Site Meetings
2.2.2
To ensure dissemination of environmental information, environmental meetings will
be held throughout the duration of the Project construction. The frequency of
meetings will be determined by the main contractor(s), but will not be less than
Abergelli ES 2018 – Outline Construction Environmental Management Plan
Prepared for: Abergelli Power Limtied
AECOM
8
once per month. These meetings will be held for all site personnel and will be
attended by the ECoW or similar environmental expert (if required).
2.2.3
Any environmental issues or lessons learnt will be reported at these meetings along
with any updates or changes to environmental management plans. A “Look Ahead”
at relevant environmental management or special requirements linked to specific
upcoming tasks or seasonality will also be provided.
c)
Site Signage and Notice Boards
2.2.4
Working areas will be clearly marked with appropriate signage and warnings to
ensure that they are avoided by members of the public.
2.2.5
Site notice boards for disseminating information to Site personnel will be positioned
either within individual work stations or in a centralised location. Site notice boards
will display method statements, emergency contacts, and relevant statutory and
non-statutory advice and guidance.
d)
Site Inductions
2.2.6
The main contractor(s) will ensure all employees, sub-contractors, suppliers, and
other visitors to the Project Site receive induction training.  The Site Induction will
include a summary of environmental risks associated with the Project and the
onsite environmental methods and standards. Any environmental methods and
standards specifically relevant to the inductee’s role or task will be highlighted.
2.2.7
Topics that will be covered in the Site Induction include, but are not limited to;
·
Pertinent areas of environmental sensitivity, such as ecological, archaeological,
hydrological or geological sensitive areas;
·
Pollution prevention and protection of the water environment (including
concrete washout);
·
Waste management; and
·
Environmental incident and near miss reporting.
e)
Training in Environmental Requirements
2.2.8
The main contractor(s) will ensure all personnel are suitably trained in general site
good practice and environmental emergency response procedures, including the
use of spill kits, silt mitigation and concrete washing out.  Good practice and
emergency response training will be provided by a suitably qualified person on a
regular basis.  The main contractor(s) will keep a record of this training.
2.2.9
Toolbox talks will be provided as part of briefings on specific tasks, based on
method statements and environmental standards.
The will provide on-going
reinforcement and awareness of environmental sensitivities and issues on the
Project Site.
Toolbox talks will be task specific and will identify the sensitive
receptors and provide advice on any specific procedures that need to be followed
and the mitigation measures that should be implemented. For specialist topics,
Abergelli ES 2018 – Outline Construction Environmental Management Plan
Prepared for: Abergelli Power Limtied
AECOM
9
toolbox talks may be presented by an ECoW (or equivalent suitably trained
specialist).
2.2.10 A programme of relevant toolbox talks will be drawn up by the Environmental
Manager
or main
contractor(s)
based on upcoming construction activities.
Additional toolbox talks may be required outside of this based on circumstances
such as unforeseen risks, repeated observation of bad practices, perceived lack of
awareness, or a pollution event. A record of all toolbox talks reporting highlights of
the meeting and attendees will be maintained.
2.3
Register of Mitigation
2.3.1
A register of embedded and additional mitigation measures committed to within the
ES has been attached in Appendix A: Mitigation Register to this Outline CEMP. The
Register has been updated in response to consultee comments and updated EIA
technical assessments. This
Register
will
be used to inform the
onsite
environmental management and provide a tool for aiding the preparation of method
statements or environmental standards. The register covers several environmental
topic areas and will be regularly updated to reflect any additional risks resulting
from the main contractors selected methods of working, changing site conditions
etc. Mitigation measures have been identified under the following general headings:
·
General;
·
Air Quality;
·
Noise and Vibration;
·
Ecology;
·
Water Quality and Resources;
·
Geology, Ground Conditions and Hydrogeology;
·
Landscape and Visual;
·
Traffic, Transport and Access; and
·
Historic Environment.
2.4
Method Statements and Site Environmental Standards
2.4.1
The main contractor(s) will prepare Method Statements for specific construction
activities and Site Environmental Standards for day-to-day Project Site operations
such as housekeeping, material storage and waste management. These will be
based on standard good practice measures (as set out within relevant management
plans in Section 3 of this Outline CEMP), statutory requirements, environmental
sensitivities and any Requirements of the DCO.
2.4.2
Site Environmental Standards will be printed on A3 posters, placed on site notice
boards and used as a briefing tool onsite. They will also form the basis of toolbox
talks on the relevant Project Site operations.
2.4.3
The method statement will be communicated to all or task specific personnel ahead
of the commencement of the relevant activities using an agreed instruction format
(e.g. toolbox talks).

Inspections
2.5.1
The Project Site will be inspected at regular intervals to ensure implementation of
good practice and compliance with measures set out within the approved CEMP.
The inspection and auditing schedule for the Project will be agreed by the main
contractor(s) in consultation with the Environmental Manager and ECoW if required
prior to commencement of construction. It is anticipated that there will be a
programme of:
·
Daily inspections;
·
Weekly inspections;
·
Monthly Audits;
·
Monthly Complaint Reporting; and
·
Ongoing Environmental Monitoring.
2.5.2
Particular notice will be taken during and following extreme weather events (high
rainfall, high winds, snowfall etc.), when working in areas of known contamination,
and when particularly hazardous activities are being carried out. Additional Method
Statements or Site Environmental Standards will be produced where significant risk
to the environment is identified.
2.5.3
An Audit Close-out Schedule will be maintained by the main contractor(s). This is a
document to record any observations, corrective action requests or non-compliance
notices identified through inspections. Progress against corrective and preventative
actions logged in the Schedule will be reported to APL on a regular basis.
i.
Daily Inspections
2.5.4
The nominated site personnel or the Environmental Manager will conduct daily
checks against environmental requirements. This could be done against a pro
forma or similar, based on the measures outlined within method statements and
Environmental Standards relevant to activities being conducted on that day.
2.5.5
Daily inspections will include visual inspections of dust emissions as described in
Section 4.3.
ii.
Weekly Inspections
2.5.6
Weekly Project Site inspections will be carried out by the Environmental Manager,
which will assess the effectiveness of the implemented mitigation on the Project
Site.
iii.
Monthly Audits

receiving and taking action on complaints is set out in the Community Liaison
(paragraph 2.2.1).
v.
Environmental Monitoring
2.5.9
Any requirements for specific monitoring programmes as determined through the
DCO or pre-construction surveys (i.e. ground investigations) will be conducted at
appropriate intervals by a suitably qualified individual.
b)
Incidents and Near Misses
2.5.10 An indicative environmental Emergency Response Plan is detailed in Section
Error! Reference source not found. of this Outline CEMP.  This will be finalised
by the main contractor(s). The plan in the approved CEMP will follow the stop –
contain – notify protocol and will detail responsible personnel and contacts for
reporting. All personnel will be briefed on the notification protocol for alerting the
main contractor(s) and Environmental Manager of an environmental emergency as
part of their Site Induction. Environmental emergency response training and toolbox
talks will also be conducted at regular intervals by a suitably qualified person.
2.5.11 The main contractor(s) will maintain a register of all environmental incidents,
dangerous occurrences and/or near misses, each supported by an Environmental
Incident Report Form. This will document the nature, date and time of the incident,
corrective action(s) taken, and details of any contact with regulatory agencies. All
incidents will be reported to the appropriate regulatory body and APL on the day
that they occur or within 24 hours.
2.5.12 All environmental incidents, dangerous occurrences and near misses will be
reviewed by the Environmental Manager and where necessary changes to working
practices/procedures will be implemented. Lessons learnt, along with any updates

3.
General Environmental Management Measures during
Construction Phase
3.1
Safety
3.1.1
The main contractor(s) will have the day to day responsibility for maintaining Health
and Safety throughout the construction phase. A risk assessment and method
statement (RAMS) will be produced and detail how risk will be minimised through
an approved procedure, which will:
·
Identify the significant Health and Safety impacts that can be anticipated;
·
Assess the risks from these impacts;
·
Identify the control measures to be taken and re-calculate the risk; and
·
Report where an inappropriate level of residual risk is identified so that action
can be taken.
3.1.2
There will be no access to construction areas by the general public. The Project
Site will be secured to avoid unauthorised access including where permissive
routes cross the construction areas.
3.1.3
Traffic safety should be promoted by all project personnel to prevention and control
traffic related injuries. Speed restrictions will be imposed onsite. This will also
minimise disturbance of bare surfaces.
3.1.4
The following good practice measures will be implemented
by the main
contractor(s) to ensure the safety of site personnel:
·
The provision of appropriate Personal Protective Equipment (PPE), including
footwear, masks, protective clothing and goggles where required;
·
Eating, drinking and smoking will be limited to a designated ‘clean’ area of the
Project Site;
·
Welfare facilities will be made available;
·
All
site
personnel
will be required to wash their hands and remove
overalls/boots when moving from ‘dirty’ to ‘clean’ areas of the Project Site;
·
Any soils excavated that are considered by the main contractor(s) to be
potentially contaminated will be reported, left in situ and fenced off until their
appropriate treatment (in line with Section Error! Reference source not
found.: Emergency Response Plan); and
·
Water inflows to excavated areas will be minimised by the use of lining
materials, good housekeeping techniques and by the control of drainage and
construction materials in order to prevent the contamination of ground water.
3.1.5
The main contractor(s) will ensure that qualified first-aid can be provided at all
times. Appropriately equipped first-aid stations will be easily accessible throughout
the Project Site.
3.2
Security
3.2.1
During site preparation the perimeter of the Generating Equipment Site will be
cleared of undergrowth and a permanent or temporary security fence placed with
Abergelli ES 2018 – OUTLINE CONSTRUCTION ENVIRONMENTAL MANAGEMENT PLAN
Prepared for: Abergelli Power Limited
AECOM
13
locked gates for main and emergency exits (capable of being opened in an
emergency).
3.3
Construction Site Housekeeping
3.3.1
Good construction site housekeeping practice will be applied at all times. As far as
reasonably practicable the construction working areas for the Project Site will be
designed using the following principles:
·
All work areas will be secured;
·
Any fuels or liquid materials will be stored and bunded in compliance with the
relevant regulation;
·
Signage and boundary fences will be regularly inspected, repaired and
replaced as necessary;
·
All working areas will be kept in a clean and tidy condition;
·
Wheel washing and dust suppression facilities will be provided when and where
required;
·
Waste will be removed at frequent intervals; and
·
Construction waste susceptible to spreading by wind or liable to cause litter will
be stored in secure containers.
3.4
Storage of Fuels and Chemicals
3.4.1
The main contractor(s) will ensure that fuels and chemicals are stored appropriately
and the measures are in place to prevent pollution of ground and water. Fuel will be
stored:
·
In areas where potential for contamination of water bodies is low i.e. outside 50
m of a spring, well or borehole and 10 m of an open watercourse;
·
In areas that are low risk of flooding;
·
In tanks that meet the manufacturing standards appropriate for the type of oil
stored and comply with BS EN ISO 9001;
·
With contents clearly marked on the storage containers;
·
With secure and appropriately sized bunds being suitable to contain 110% of
the contents (single tank).  If there is more than one storage container, the
bund will be capable of containing 110% of the largest tank, or 25% of the total
aggregate capacity, whichever is the greatest;
·
Tanks/ storage containers will be protected against vehicle collision; and
·
All deliveries will be overseen by site personnel with emergency response
training.
3.4.2
A Control of Substances Hazardous to Health (COSHH) store will be set up in the
site compound. COSHH assessments and Material Safety Data Sheets will be held
with the COSHH materials. A COSHH register will be created and maintained
onsite.
3.4.3
All site personnel and sub-contractors will be made aware of the COSHH
requirements through site inductions and specific toolbox talks. Daily site
inspections will be used to review and monitor the storage and issue of COSHH
materials.

3.5
Welfare Facilities
3.5.1
Welfare cabins, toilets and drying facilities, in line with The Construction (Design
and Management) Regulations 2015 (Ref. 3.1) will be provided within the Project
Site for the use of site personnel. Grey and foul water from welfare facilities will not
be discharged directly into ditches or watercourse, but will be collected through a
foul water drainage system that will either drain to a septic tank or a package
treatment plant within the Project Site. It is likely that the latter will be the preferred
option for ease of maintenance and environmental criteria. The processed water
will then discharge onsite or to a nearby watercourse.
3.5.2
Where portable generators are used, industry good practice will be followed to
minimise noise and pollution from such generators.
3.5.3
The risk of infestation by pests or vermin will be minimised by the appropriate
collection, storage and regular collection of waste, the prompt treatment of any pest
infestation and effective preventative pest control measures.
3.6
Public Right of Ways
3.6.1
There are three Public Right of Ways (PRoW) that cross the Project Site. Specific
mitigation measures for the management of these PRoWs is contained within the
Outline Construction Traffic Management Plan, which will be finalised post-consent,
in consultation with the PRoW officer at CCS.
3.6.2
It is not proposed to permanently divert any PRoWs although measures will be
implemented during the construction phase to maintain safety to users from
construction traffic and also from any excavations which may be present. Any
temporary closures, required for public safety, will be advertised in advance and
diversions or directions to alternate routes will be provided where practicable.
3.6.3
Appropriate signage will be placed prior to the construction area to ensure users
are aware of the works prior to arriving. Should works be undertaken in the
immediate location of the crossing, banksman will be employed to avoid any
potential adverse effects from construction traffic. In addition, suitable fencing will
be implemented to ensure users of the permissive routes are segregated from
construction traffic appropriately and safely if required.
3.7
Timing of Works
3.7.1
Construction will be programmed in such a way as to ensure that construction
activities are undertaken in a timely manner while minimising environmental risk as
far as possible, e.g. seasonal sensitivities or inclement weather will be considered.
Construction activities may be undertaken simultaneously at more than one area of
the Project Site.  The work programme will be agreed with CCS prior to
construction commencing onsite. In the event that the programme changes
significantly, the changes will be communicated to CCS.
3.7.2
Construction activities will be scheduled so that works that have the potential to
impact upon ecological receptors are conducted outside key periods of seasonal
Abergelli ES 2018 – OUTLINE CONSTRUCTION ENVIRONMENTAL MANAGEMENT PLAN
Prepared for: Abergelli Power Limited
AECOM
15
activity, for instance, vegetation clearance will be conducted outside of the breeding
bird season.
3.7.3
Construction activities will also be scheduled, where possible to reduce the risk of
pollution. Measures include:
·
Minimising the periods for which soils are exposed and stockpiled thereby
reducing the risk of generating silt laden runoff;
·
Avoiding, where possible, undertaking specific activities such as earthworks
during prolonged and heavy rainfall thereby reducing the risk of sediment or
pollutants becoming entrained in excess runoff; and
·
Avoiding, where possible, undertaking
activities
in closer proximity to
watercourses when water levels are higher and adjacent land is at risk of
flooding.
3.8
Working Hours
3.8.1
Construction activities will not take place outside the hours of 08:00-18:00 Monday
to Friday and 08.00-13.00 on Saturday and public holidays, unless otherwise
agreed with CCS. These limits will not apply during commissioning and completion
of the Project, as defined in Chapter 3: Project and Site Description of the ES.
Local residents will be notified, as detailed in Section 2.2 Community Liaison, of
any agreed changes to the working hours. Lighting
3.8.2
The Project Site will require artificial lighting during construction to provide a safe
working environment during hours of darkness. Artificial lighting can be a nuisance
to any nearby residence and can disrupt nocturnal species.
3.8.3
All artificial lighting used at the Project Site will be in accordance with the Institute
of Lighting Professionals (ILP) Guidelines (Ref. 3.2) and the Bat Conservation
Trust’s (BCT) interim guidance on artificial lighting and wildlife (Ref. 3.3).
3.8.4
In order to minimise light disturbance to ecological receptors:
·
There will be no more than 1 lux beyond the boundary of the proposed Project
Site, particularly within the Lletty-Morfil
Site of Importance for Nature
Conservation (SINC) to the north and east of the Generating Equipment Site,
which is a habitat that supports bats; and
3.8.5
The general design objectives that will be used to ensure that adverse effects of
lighting (through adding light to a darker rural landscape) associated with
construction of the Project are minimised are listed below:
·
Luminaires will be appropriately designed for the required task;
·
Louvres and shields will be used to prevent undesirable light break-out;
·
Construction lighting will be directed away from all sensitive receptors;
·
For the illumination of large areas, in order to limit light trespass, glare and
sky glow from the plant, preference will be given to several, lower lighting
units rather than tall, wide beam lighting units;
·
Vehicle lights will be properly directed (conforming to MOT requirements) and
lenses will be intact to prevent un-necessary glare and light intrusion;
Abergelli ES 2018 – OUTLINE CONSTRUCTION ENVIRONMENTAL MANAGEMENT PLAN
Prepared for: Abergelli Power Limited
AECOM
16
·
Lighting will be reduced or switched off when not required for safety purposes;
·
Security lighting will be kept at the minimum level needed for visual and
security protection;
·
Dark corridors will be maintained along hedgerows and watercourses and any
other linear features by avoiding light encroaching on these areas. This will
avoid the fragmentation of habitat used by species such as bats and also
otters that use these features to move at night-time; and
·
If appropriate, the use of infra-red floodlighting and CCTV systems will be
considered for security to reduce the need for visible lighting outside working
hours.

Environmental Management Plans
4.1
Overview
4.1.1
The following sections outline the likely contents of the topic specific Management
Plans that will be developed to be submitted to discharge a DCO Requirement
post-consent.
4.1.2
Other than the Emergency Response Plan which is integral to the CEMP, these
plans will be subject to their own separate Requirement in the DCO and finalised as
required via standalone documents.
4.2
Emergency Response Plan
4.2.1
This plan provides response measures for potential environmental emergencies
that could arise during the construction of the Project. These include; discovery of
unknown contaminated ‘hotspots’; spills of contaminants such as chemicals, fuels
or waste materials; and entry of contaminants into watercourses during flood
events.
4.2.2
This Emergency Response Plan will be reviewed by the main contractor(s) and
finalised in the approved CEMP. The main contractor(s) will also supply emergency
contact details for nominated site personnel, relevant regulatory bodies and
emergency services. These details will be available on site notice boards
(paragraph 2.2.5) and will be displayed along with a plan of the Project Site that
displays safe storage areas and the location of response equipment, such as spill
kits.
4.2.3
The emergency plan and contact details will be shown to all site personnel as part
of the Site Induction. Nominated site personnel will be provided with emergency
response training. There will be regular toolbox talks on emergency response
procedures and all site personnel will be informed of the notification procedure in
the event of discovering contamination or a spill as part of the Site Induction.
4.2.4
All incidents where the Emergency Response Plan is implemented will be reported
in line with the Incident Response Procedure detailed in Section 2.5: Monitoring
and Auditing (starting paragraph 2.5.10).
a)
Contaminated Hotspots Plan
4.2.5
Ground investigations will be conducted to identify any potentially existing
contaminated land within the Project Site. In the case where a contaminant is
identified, a contaminant specific management plan will be produced.
4.2.6
As such, the procedure below is proposed to be followed in the eventuality that an
unidentified contaminant “hotspot” showing visual or olfactory evidence of
contamination is discovered during construction:
·
Relevant construction activities will be stopped immediately;
Abergelli ES 2018 – OUTLINE CONSTRUCTION ENVIRONMENTAL MANAGEMENT PLAN
Prepared for: Abergelli Power Limited
AECOM
18
·
The discovery will be reported to the Environmental Manager or appropriate
personnel as identified by the main contractor(s);
·
The area will be sealed off in order to contain the spread of contaminants;
·
The area will be cleared to ensure there is nothing that could cause fire or
explosion;
·
The relevant regulator and/or CCS will be contacted once it is confirmed that
contamination has been found;
·
Testing will be arranged; and
·
Details of the incident will be recorded, including photos and relevant
information on the Environmental Incident Report Form.
b)
Emergency Spill Response Plan
4.2.7
Appropriate spill response materials for the chemicals, fuels and oils stored onsite
will be provided throughout the Project Site. Spill kits will be made available at fuel
storage and refuelling locations and in individual plant and vehicles. Use of plant
and hazardous materials will be done in the presence of at least one operative
trained in emergency response.
4.2.8
The main contractor(s) will produce an emergency response plan that will follow the
STOP – CONTAIN – NOTIFY – CLEAN UP – REPORT procedure. An indicative
procedure is set out below:
·
STOP
o
Relevant Construction activities will be stopped immediately;
o
Spilt substance will be identified and any information available (i.e.
COSHH material sheet) obtained along with the correct PPE;
o
If safe to do so, the spill will be stopped to prevent more material spilling,
e.g. oil drums will be righted or valves closed; and
o
Sources of ignition will be switched off.
·
CONTAIN
o
The spillage will be immediately contained using bunds of earth or sand,
drip trays, boom and or spill materials;
o
Drains and watercourses will be checked to see if the spill has reached
them. Where possible, spills will be diverted and drains will be bunded to
stop the spill entering the drainage network;
o
Spillage and runoff will not be washed into the drainage system.
·
NOTIFY
o
The Environmental Manager will be notified;
o
The Environmental manger will then notify the relevant regulator, CCS
and APL.
·
CLEAN UP
o
The spill will be cleaned up using appropriate spill materials OR by an
expert/ specialist clean-up contractor;
o
Contaminated soil, ground and water will be disposed of as hazardous
waste (Section 4.5.11).
·
REPORT
o
An Environmental Incident Report will be completed in line with the
Incident Response Procedure (Section 2.5.10).

c)
Flood Risk Management Plan
4.2.9
The following provides an outline of the measures to be implemented to minimise
flood risk:
·
The main contractor(s) will sign up to receive NRW flood warnings or flood
alerts for the Afon Llan and Afon Lliw;
·
The main contractor(s) will sign up to receive high rainfall alerts provided by the
MET office as flood warning for the Project Site;
·
Weather forecasts will be checked regularly;
·
Plant, machinery and stockpiles will be stored away from watercourses, ditches
and low lying areas that could flood;
·
If flooding of the Project Site is expected, vehicles and plant machinery that
pose a hazard will be moved to higher ground or off-site if appropriate;
·
If flooding of the Project Site occurs, plant machinery and vehicles will be
checked to ensure they are safe before use; and
4.2.10 Where possible, temporary works (including stockpiles and drains) will be set to
direct overland flows away from the main Project Site and access routes.
4.3
Dust Management Plan
4.3.1
This plan contains a proposed dust monitoring plan and standard good practice
measures for reducing dust and emissions from vehicles.
4.3.2
Guidance relevant to the implementation of air quality measures include;
·
BS 6031: 2009: Code of Practice for Earth Works (Ref. 4.1);
·
HSE Vehicle at Work Guidance (Ref. 4.2); and
·
Institute of Air Quality Management (IAQM) Guidance on Air Quality Monitoring
in the Vicinity of Demolition and Construction Sites (Ref. 4.3).
a)
Contents of Plan
4.3.3
In line with IAQM guidance (Ref. 4.3) on monitoring air quality at construction sites;
daily visual inspections of dust emissions (and weekly recording) will be made in
conjunction with dust emissions monitoring at locations to be agreed with NRW.
This data will be used to ensure that mitigation measures are appropriate and being
applied rigorously and to provide early warning of increased dust emissions to
inform the cessation or modification of activities prior to impacts occurring.
4.3.4
Monitoring will be undertaken in the vicinity of the Lletty-Morfil SINC. Since the risk
for ecosystems relates to dust deposition, a real time monitor for total suspended
particulate matter will be installed. Trigger levels for the instrument, which would
suggest increasing risk/emissions,
will
be agreed with NRW prior to the
commencement of construction. The monitoring stations will be mobile and will be
moved around the Project Site as the principal activities move.
4.3.5
The following are general good practice measures that will be implemented onsite
to control dust and vehicle emissions. If inspections and monitoring find that plumes
Abergelli ES 2018 – OUTLINE CONSTRUCTION ENVIRONMENTAL MANAGEMENT PLAN
Prepared for: Abergelli Power Limited
AECOM
20
of dust are visible, behind moving vehicles for example, or dust was visibly
deposited on roads outside of the Project Site, more vigorous control measures
may be required.
i.
Site Management
·
All personnel will be made aware of nuisance dust and will be trained in dust
management; and
·
Project Site plant will be maintained so as to reduce emissions.
ii.
Earthworks
·
Disturbance of the ground will be kept to a minimum wherever possible;
·
Necessary vegetation/ topsoil removal will be carried out in discrete sections
with progressive restoration of exposed areas to minimise wind erosion;
·
Earthworks and excavation areas will be kept damp, and will be avoided during
periods of exceptionally dry weather; and
·
Earthworks will be undertaken following BS 6031:2009 (Ref. 4.1).
iii.
Material Handling

The number of handling operations will be kept to a minimum to ensure that
dusty material isn’t moved or handled unnecessarily;
·
Soil handling will be restricted during adverse weather conditions such as high
winds or exceptionally dry spells;
·
Drop heights will be kept to a minimum and will be enclosed where possible;
·
Transportation of aggregates and fine materials will be conducted in enclosed
or sheeted vehicles;
·
Dampening methods will be used where necessary; and
·
Methods and equipment will be in place for immediate clean-up of spillages of
dusty or potentially dusty materials.
iv. Stockpiles
·
Stockpiles will be located away from sensitive receptors where dust nuisance is
likely to result;

vi. Emissions Management
·
Plant and equipment will be operated as far as possible away from residential
areas or sensitive receptors near to the Project Site;
·
An onsite speed limit will be implemented by the main contractor(s) that will be
appropriate to the types of construction plant utilised and the Project Site
hazards in line with Vehicles at Work guidance from the Health and Safety
Executive (HSE) (Ref. 4.2);
·
Onsite vehicle movement will be kept to a minimum and restricted to
adequately compacted internal roads;
·
All plant utilised on Project Site should be regularly inspected.  Monitoring of
plant will include:
o
Ensuring no black smoke is emitted other than during ignition;
o
Ensuring exhaust emissions are maintained to comply with the
appropriate limits;
·
Vehicle exhausts will be directed away from the ground and other surfaces and
preferably upwards to avoid road dust being re-suspended to the air; and
·
Exhausts will be positioned at a sufficient height to ensure adequate dispersal
of emissions.
4.4
Pollution Prevention Management Plan
4.4.1
This plan covers measures to minimise the risk of pollution to ground and water
from the storage and use of potentially polluting materials onsite. The sections
below detail the storage of fuels and oil, management of non-oil chemicals,
potential pollution from construction vehicles, plant and machinery and the use of
cement and concrete.
4.4.2
An Emergency Spill Response Plan is set out within Section Error! Reference

4.4.3
All fuel storage will comply with the Water Resources (Control of Pollution) (Oil
Storage) (Wales) Regulations 2016 (Ref. 4.4).
4.4.4
Further water specific management measures can be found in ES Appendix 3.2:
Surface Water Management Plan.
a)
Contents of Plan
i.
Movement, Parking and Re-fuelling of Vehicles and Plant
4.4.5
Vehicles and plant will comply with the following:
·
In order to prevent compaction and erosion of undeveloped ground, movement
of construction plant and vehicles will be limited to clearly defined access tracks
and construction areas only.
·
Where possible, all construction plant and vehicles will be parked/stored at
least 50 m away from surface waterbodies and springs.
·
All construction plant and vehicles will be checked daily for oil and fuel leaks
and record of such checks kept by the Environmental Manager (or ECoW).

22
·
Mobile plant will be in good working order, kept clean and fitted with drip trays
where appropriate.
·
Refuelling of construction plant and vehicles will be undertaken on an
impermeable surface at a temporary construction compound only.
·
All refuelling activities will be supervised by site personnel with emergency
response training.
ii.
Cement and Concrete
4.4.6
Concrete and cement are alkaline and corrosive, and can have a highly polluting
impact in water and on land and are harmful to human flesh.
4.4.7
Due to the size of the Project Site it is likely that concrete batching will occur onsite.
The equipment used for concrete batching should be operated in accordance with
Process Guidance Note 3/01(12) (Ref. 4.5).
4.4.8
Mixing and washing of concrete will not take place within 10 m of any watercourse
or swale and waste waters will not be discharged into the water environment. All
site personnel will receive training on concrete washout as part of their Site
Induction.
4.5
Waste and Material Management Plan
4.5.1
To ensure efficiency of resource use, prevention of litter nuisance and compliance
with waste legislation, this sections sets out good practice waste and material
management measures.
4.5.2
Construction activities associated with materials and/or waste generation include:
·
Site clearance
will remove vegetation and undergrowth in work areas
generating organic materials and waste;
·
Excavation; it is estimated that the overall quantity of excavated material (solid)
from the construction is to be approximately 19,000 m3m3. This figure is a
measure of excavated material in the ground and bulk material. The worst case
scenario assessed in Chapter 12: Traffic, Transport and Access of the ES
assumes that none of this excavated material can be reused within the Project
Site. However the worst case is not anticipated; and
·
General day-to-day construction operations such as use of welfare facilities and
deliveries generating packaging, domestic waste and sewage.
4.5.3
Waste likely to be generated during construction includes:
·
Topsoil and subsoil;
·
Excess concrete, mortar and grout;
·
Wood off cuts and used wood (crates and concrete formwork);
·
Bricks, pavers and concrete block off cuts;
·
Roofing materials;
·
Metal including steel reinforcement off cuts;
·
Plastic wrapping and packaging;

·
Paper;
·
Delivered material bags, wrappings and coverings; and
·
Miscellaneous materials
4.5.4
The EU Waste Framework Directive (WFD) (Ref. 4.6) provides the overarching
legislative framework for the collection, transport, recovery and disposal of waste,
and includes a common definition of waste. The Project will operate in accordance
with the WFD, together with the Environmental Permitting (England and Wales)
Regulations 2016 (Ref.4.7) and the Hazardous Waste (England and Wales)
Regulations 2005 (as amended by the Hazardous Waste (England and Wales)
Amendment Regulations 2009 and 2016) (Ref. 4.8).
4.5.5
Other guidance referred to within the CEMP includes:
·
The Waste Classification Technical Guidance WM3 (Ref. 4.9), which sets out a
standardised classification of waste based on material properties;
·
Welsh Government Guidance on Applying the Waste Hierarchy (Ref. 4.10); and
·
The Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affair’s (DEFRA) Waste Duty
of Care Code of Practice (Ref. 4.11).
a)
Contents of Plan
i.
Waste Hierarchy
4.5.6
Onsite waste management will align with the Waste Hierarchy, which promotes
efficient resource use and minimisation of waste through the priority ordering of the
following measures:
·
Prevention;
·
Preparing for re-use;
·
Recycle;
·
Other recovery; and
·
Dispose (Ref. 4.11).
4.5.7
The priority order may be deviated from if a better overall environmental outcome is
recognised for a particular resource or waste.
ii.
Waste Prevention
4.5.8
The following preventative measures will be adopted:
·
Building materials ordered will be the correct size so as not to be wasted due to
being obsolete;
·
The appropriate volume of material will be ordered to avoid excess;
·
Ordering of new materials will be avoided if there are existing materials
available or able to be adapted to the task within the Project Site;
·
Deliveries will be timely and directly placed in secure storage areas, double
handling will be kept to a minimum;
·
Re-usable materials will be identified onsite and removed for storage and re-
sale;
·
Excess materials will be returned to the supplier if possible; and

24
·
General information on site waste management will be provided in Site
Inductions and toolbox talks with feedback welcomed.
iii.
Classification of Waste
4.5.9
APL and/ or the main contractor(s) will identify and classify all Project Site waste
streams in line with the categories and methods set out in the Waste Classification
Technical Guidance WM3 (Ref. 4.9).
iv. Storing Waste
4.5.10 Where resources are earmarked for recycling, recovery or disposal the following
method of storage will be implemented to minimise the risk of waste escaping, litter
and/ or pollution:
·
All waste will be stored at the location in which it is generated, or within a
designated central waste storage area;
·
These designated waste storage areas will be isolated from surface water
drains and areas that discharge directly to the water environment;
·
Waste will be stored in suitable containers of sufficient capacity to avoid loss,
overflow or spillage;
·
Storage of liquid wastes will be on impermeable bunds that hold the capacity of
the container;
·
Waste will be segregated by waste stream and storage containers will be
clearly signed with the waste that they will hold e.g. wood, metal, plastics or
other appropriate waste stream;
·
Storage containers will be secure, covered or enclosed;
·
There will be separate containers for hazardous waste (see Paragraph 4.5.11);
·
Skips will be monitored and action taken if waste levels are too high; and
·
Burning of waste is prohibited.
v.
Hazardous Waste
4.5.11 “Hazardous waste” is any waste which contains properties that might make it
harmful to human health or the environment (Ref. 4.8).
4.5.12 Hazardous waste could arise during construction from the following sources:
·
Maintenance of plant and machinery;
·
Oily water waste;
·
Oily rags;
·
Oil absorbent pads etc.; and
·
Environmental Spill recovery (small amounts only; larger volumes taken away
directly for disposal).
4.5.13 All Hazardous waste will be segregated by type and from other waste streams. All
waste oil will be stored in a bunded facility until such times that it is collected. Used
filters, rags and absorbents will be stowed in the hazardous waste container in
drums or waste oil bags.
vi. Organic Matter
Abergelli ES 2018 – OUTLINE CONSTRUCTION ENVIRONMENTAL MANAGEMENT PLAN
Prepared for: Abergelli Power Limited
AECOM
25
4.5.14 The waste wood and foliage material resulting from site clearance will be managed
in-line with the Waste Hierarchy (as detailed within paragraph 4.5.6), thus helping
to minimise potential environmental issues pertaining to this process.
4.5.15 Wherever feasible, the generation of tree and foliage waste will be prevented and
these features will be retained in-situ. However, the retention of trees and foliage
will not always be possible; therefore the reuse of material onsite will be explored
wherever practicable, with wood material either reused in construction, or within
landscaping aspects such as the use of wood chippings, or as mulch to enhance
soil quality to aid the reinstatement of the Project Site.
4.5.16 Should this not prove to be a viable option for all generated material, then excess
wood waste will be stored under cover, such as tarpaulin, to protect wood from the
weather so that it may be re-used wherever possible off-site e.g. as carpentry
material or offered to the local community for fire wood and biomass.
4.5.17 Attention will also be paid to the proximity principle, with local uses for waste
materials considered where this represents the best practicable environmental
option. For all material that cannot be re-used on- or off- site, or recycled, then
elements of the wood and foliage material can be converted into wood-chip. By
following this process, it will be possible to limit the volume of tree and foliage
waste sent for disposal as far as practicably possible.
4.5.18
Any topsoil or subsoil generated will remain onsite to be reused for any
landscaping.
vii. Transporting Waste
·
Waste contractors will be checked periodically (bi-annually) to ensure they
have valid licences;  and
·
All waste leaving the Project Site will be accompanied by a Waste Transfer
Note (WTN) for non-hazardous waste or a Special Waste Consignment Note
(SWCN) for hazardous waste.  A copy of which will be retained for 2 (WTN) or
3 years (SWCN).

Introduction
1.1
Overview
This document describes the landscape and biodiversity impact
mitigation
1.1.1
measures that will be implemented prior to and during the construction phase of the
Project, as well as the mitigation, management and monitoring measures to be
implemented once the Project is operational.
This document should be read in conjunction with ES Chapter 8: Ecology,
1.1.2
Chapter 11: Landscape and Visual Assessment and the Landscape and Ecology
Mitigation Plan (LEMP) (ES Figure 3.6a-e).
This strategy also refers to the
following plans: Construction Environmental Management Plan (CEMP), Surface
Water Management Plan (SWMP) and an Outline Lighting Strategy to demonstrate
a holistic approach.
The proposed landscape and biodiversity mitigation measures are summarised
1.1.3
below. These proposals have been designed to be delivered within the Project Site
Boundary, as well as to retain where possible the existing planting within the
Project Site
Boundary. New habitat
creation and landscaping have been
accommodated, alongside the protection and enhancement of existing habitats
where feasible.
The key measures proposed are:
1.1.4
·
biodiversity mitigation by the provision of newly created replacement habitats;
·
woodland structure planting within the Project Site Boundary to partially screen
structures; and
·
management of newly created replacement habitats.
The proposed landscape and ecological mitigation measures are illustrated in ES
1.1.5
Figures 3.6a-e which graphically demonstrate the primary mitigation measures
embedded into the project design as well as the new habitat creation. Combined
with this document they outline the proposed mitigation measures for the Project in
relation to landscape and ecology using a holistic and integrated approach, and
have been produced to support the DCO Application.
The landscape and ecological mitigation measures described in this document will
1.1.6
be subject to a 25 year management period running concurrently with the
operational design lifetime of the Project. The execution of these works will be the
responsibility of the operator of the Site. The planting operations in association with
the Above Ground Installation (AGI) will be undertaken by National Grid.
1.2
The Purpose and Structure of this Document
The purpose of this document is to set out the proposed strategy to mitigate
1.2.1
potentially adverse effects of the Project on the biodiversity features within the
Project Site Boundary and on the landscape and visual resource.
It provides a
Landscape and Ecology Mitigation Strategy

clear landscape and ecological rationale, which responds to the Project Site and
the assessments prepared in
ES
Chapter 8: Ecology
and
Chapter 11:
Landscape and Visual.
The Project has been designed, as far as is practicable, to avoid or reduce effects
1.2.2
on landscape and biodiversity features through design development and impact
avoidance. Opportunities to secure net gains for landscape and biodiversity as a
consequence of the Project have also been considered.
The document has been structured as follows:
1.2.3
·
Baseline Conditions;
·
Construction Mitigation;
·
Landscape and Ecological mitigation proposals; and
·
Management and Maintenance.
Outline species specific method statements are provided in Appendices A-G.
1.2.4
2.
Baseline Conditions
The Project Site is located within a valley with ground rising to the north, east and
2.1.1
west which provides visual containment. Ground levels vary across the Project Site
from approximately 146 m Above Ordinance Datum (AOD) in the north-west corner
to 80 m AOD along the southern perimeter. Ground levels generally fall in a
southerly and south easterly direction.
The Project Site is predominantly covered with pasture which is currently used for
2.1.2
sheep and horse grazing as well as a band of broadleaf woodland to the east. A
soft surface horse training track, known as 'The Gallops', crosses the Project Site
and runs diagonally north-west to south-east. Broadleaf woodland which is
classified in part as Ancient Woodland lies to the east of the Project Site as well as
around the Access Road to the Substation and Felindre Gas Compressor Station.
Fields across the Project Site support a mix of improved grassland, semi-improved
grassland (acid/neutral) and wet grassland (marshy grassland) which are
subdivided by ditches, post and wire fencing, remnant hedgerows (forming rows of
mature trees) and are interspersed with scrub vegetation. The habitats are heavily
grazed and as such support a limited range of floristic species.
The western part of the Project Site encompasses part of the Substation, adjacent
2.1.3
to the Felindre Gas Compressor Station. Both the Substation and the Felindre Gas
Compressor 
Station 
comprise 
large 
scale 
power 
infrastructure 
facilities
characterised by tall industrial structures enclosed by security fencing and set
within woodland planting. Pylons are prominent across the landscape and converge
at the Substation.
Generating Equipment Site
Pre-construction, the Generating Equipment Site is dominated by an area of
2.1.4
marshy grassland surrounded by broadleaf woodland and semi-improved neutral
Landscape and Ecology Mitigation Strategy

grassland. There are five ditches running through the centre of the Generating
Equipment Site of which two pairs run parallel to each other and are wooded. Part
of the broadleaf woodland and marshy grassland is designated as a Site of
Importance for Nature Conservation (SINC) (Lletty-Morfil SINC), the boundary of
which extends beyond the Project Site Boundary.
The construction of the Generating Equipment Site will require the creation of a
2.1.5
temporary construction compound for the storage of materials, plant and equipment
as well as containing site accommodation and welfare facilities, temporary car
parking and temporary fencing (the Laydown Area). A small area within the
Laydown Area will be retained permanently (the Maintenance Compound). The
area is dominated by marshy grassland and a small area of improved grassland
and semi-improved neutral grassland.
Habitats within the Generating Equipment Site are known to support or are suitable
2.1.6
for supporting the following protected and priority species:
·
Priority species of butterfly and moth;
·
Common toad (priority species);
·
Common lizard and grass snake (protected species);
·
Breeding birds (protected species);
·
Bats (protected species);
·
Water vole (protected species);
·
Otter (protected species);
·
Brown hare (priority species); and,
·
Badger (protected species).
The Generating Equipment Site also supports invasive non-native species (INNS)
2.1.7
of plants – Japanese knotweed, Himalayan balsam and floating pennywort.
Access Road
The Access Road runs from the B4489, which lies to the west, to the Generating
2.1.8
Equipment Site. The Access Road will be formed by upgrading an existing access
road between the B4489 junction and the Substation and constructing a new
section of Access Road from the Substation to the Generating Equipment Site.
Pre-construction, the Access Road comprises hard standing, improved grassland,
2.1.9
semi-improved neutral grassland, row of trees and marshy grassland. The new
section of Access Road crosses two watercourses, and has been rerouted to avoid
an area of Ancient Woodland.
2.1.10 Habitats within the Access Road are known to support or are suitable for supporting
the following protected and priority species:
·
Common toad (priority species);
·
Common lizard and grass snake (protected species);
·
Breeding birds (protected species);
Landscape and Ecology Mitigation Strategy
Prepared for: Abergelli Power Limited
AECOM

·
Bats (protected species);
·
Otter (protected species);
·
Brown hare (priority species); and,
·
Badger (protected species).
The Access Road also supports INNS plants, namely Japanese knotweed.
2.1.11
Electrical Connection
2.1.12 The Electrical Connection is an underground electrical cable to export power from
the Generating Equipment to the National Grid Electricity Transmission System
(NETS). For the first 160 m (approx.) the route runs from the NETS through an area
of semi-improved neutral grassland, a ditch and row of trees, after which it runs
alongside the Access Road.
Gas Connection
2.1.13 The Gas Connection will be in the form of a new AGI and underground Gas
Pipeline. This is to bring natural gas to the Generating Equipment from the National
Gas Transmission System. The Gas Pipeline will follow an approximate north-south
route corridor, between the National Gas Transmission System south of Rhyd-y-
pandy Road and the Generating Equipment Site.
2.1.14 The Gas Connection is dominated by improved grassland, with boundary features
including one hedgerow, two rows of trees and post and wire fences.
2.1.15 Habitats within the Gas Connection are known to support or are suitable for
supporting the following protected and priority species:
·
Priority species of butterfly and moth;
·
Common toad (priority species);
·
Common lizard and grass snake (protected species);
·
Breeding birds (protected species);
·
Bats (protected species);
·
Otter (protected species);
·
Brown hare (priority species); and,
·
Badger (protected species).
The Gas Connection also supports INNS plants.

Construction Mitigation
3.1
Landscape Working Methods
Mitigation measures will be implemented during the construction in order to limit
3.1.1
impacts on the landscape and visual resource. These are summarised below:
·
Land and vegetation clearance and occupation will be limited to the minimum
area necessary for the works;
Landscape and Ecology Mitigation Strategy
Prepared for: Abergelli Power Limited
AECOM
6
·
Good housekeeping measures will minimise unsightly waste and secure
storage will be provided for materials at risk from displacement by wind;
·
Temporary stockpiles will be located in defined storage areas, away from
sensitive visual receptors;
·
No advertisements or fly posting will be permitted on any fence and all graffiti
will be removed and made good as soon as reasonably practicable;
·
All boundary fences will be maintained in a neat and tidy condition;
·
Any temporary fencing will be removed as soon as reasonably practicable after
completion of the works; and
·
Temporary lighting will be selected and sited so as to minimise visual intrusion
to residents, whilst maintaining the safe and efficient operation of the work site.
At night and during periods of darkness, directional security lighting will be used
where required.
The following good practice measures will be adopted and implemented for the
3.1.2
protection of trees retained onsite:
·
A Root Protection Area (RPA) will be set up around trees to be retained onsite
prior to commencement of construction;
·
The RPA will be demarcated by 'Netlon' fluorescent mesh fencing or similar
physical barrier. The protective fencing will be maintained for the duration of the
construction phase and checked on a regular basis;
·
In the event that an RPA cannot be maintained at 12 times the diameter at
breast height (DBH) mitigation such as bog matting, flotation tyres and hand
digging will be utilised;
·
No machinery or material will be stored within the RPA;
·
To ensure retained trees do not become hazardous, the condition of trees will
be checked by the Environmental Manager or Ecological Clerk of Works
(ECoW) at an appropriate frequency and following storm events where there
may be damage from wind throw;
·
Where a tree is damaged or diseased advice will be sought from an
Arboriculturalist (unless the ECoW is appropriately qualified) for appropriate
treatment measures;
·
Where hazardous branches or trees require to be felled this will be done by a
qualified tree surgeon in line with BS 3998: 2010;
·
Before felling trees, surveys for potential bird nest or bat roosts will be
undertaken by the ECoW; and

Landscape and Ecological Mitigation Proposals
4.1
Overview
The primary focus of the landscape and ecology mitigation is habitat creation and
4.1.1
landscape planting which will be accommodated within the Project Site Boundary
alongside the protection and enhancement of existing habitats. It is anticipated that
existing planting within the Project Site would be retained and protected where

AECOM
7
possible. ES Figure 3.6 identifies the woodland and trees to be retained and the
areas of new habitat and planting.
The overall construction working methods to be implemented during the
4.1.2
construction phase are outlined in the outline CEMP (Appendix 3.1), outline SWMP
(Appendix 3.2) and Outline Lighting Strategy (Appendix 3.5) and are secured via
corresponding Requirements in schedule 2 of the DCO (Document Reference 3.1).
Therefore these are not repeated here but are referred to where necessary for
completeness.
4.2
Habitats and Protection
Existing habitats will be retained where possible. Where this is not possible those

habitats removed with conservation value will be compensated for through the
provision of newly created habitats or enhancement of existing habitats. Mitigation
to help avoid injury or killing of protected and priority species will be implemented.
Newly created habitats will be designed to be of value to those protected and
4.2.2
priority species known to be present within the Project Site Boundary.
Lighting has been designed to limit the effects on wildlife (refer to outline Lighting
4.2.3
Strategy (Appendix 3.5).
4.3
Habitat Replacement
The total area of habitat with conservation value (i.e. not improved grassland or
4.3.1
hard standing) permanently removed during construction is estimated to be 2.9 ha.
An area of land approximately 3 ha in size within the Project Site boundary has
been identified as suitable for habitat enhancement and will mitigate for the loss of
habitats including a proportion of Lletty-Morfil SINC. The habitat enhancement
measures will also provide valuable habitats for a range of species including
invertebrates, amphibians, reptiles, breeding and foraging birds, brown hare and
badger, commuting and foraging bats and, once trees mature, roosting bats. This
area is known as the Ecological Mitigation Area
and will be implemented by the
end of construction (ES Figure 3.6c).
During construction there will be no night time illumination of hedgerows, woodland
4.3.2
or mature tree lines. Operational external lighting has been designed to reduce
trespass and configured to avoid glare and spillage, and otherwise in accordance
with the Outline Lighting Strategy undertaken in accordance with the Institution of
Lighting Professionals guidelines. The strategy will seek to limit effects of lighting
on habitats (and therefore species) adjacent to the Project Site.  During the hours
of darkness, only critical light sources will remain in operation,
The sensitivity of the infrared motion detectors will be set so as not to be activated
4.3.3
by the movement of large mammals such as badgers and otters. The lighting
strategy will ensure that all lighting columns will be fitted with cowls to reduce light
spill and will be directed away from boundary features. A ‘dark corridor’ (as shown
Landscape and Ecology Mitigation Strategy

in ES Figure 3.6) has been designed to keep lighting to no more than 1 lux along
adjacent woodland edges and watercourses that are likely to be used by nocturnal
species such as bats, badgers, water vole and otters. The Gas Connection and
Electrical Connection will not be lit.
4.4
Tree Management and Root Protection
The following good practice measures will be adopted and implemented as part of
4.4.1
this Strategy for the protection of trees retained onsite, including Ancient Woodland:
·
A Root Protection Area (RPA) will be set up around trees to be retained onsite
prior to commencement of construction;
·
The RPA will be demarcated by 'Netlon' fluorescent mesh fencing or similar
physical barrier. The protective fencing will be maintained for the duration of the
construction phase and checked on a regular basis;
·
In the event that an RPA cannot be maintained at 12 times the diameter at
breast height (DBH) mitigation such as bog matting, flotation tyres and hand
digging will be utilised;
·
No machinery or material will be stored within the RPA;
·
To ensure retained trees do not become hazardous, the condition of trees will
be checked by the Environmental Manager or Ecological Clerk of Works
(ECoW) at an appropriate frequency and following storm events where there
may be damage from wind throw;
·
Where a tree is damaged or diseased advice will be sought from an
Arboriculturalist (unless the ECoW is appropriately qualified) for appropriate
treatment measures;
·
Where hazardous branches or trees require to be felled this will be done by a
qualified tree surgeon in line with BS 3998: 2010;
·
Before felling trees, surveys for potential bird nest or bat roosts will be
undertaken by the ECoW; and
·
The waste hierarchy will be applied to vegetation and biomass arisings and
alternate onsite uses will be sought before disposal is considered.
4.5
Species-Specific Measures
Measures have been specified to help avoid injury or killing of protected and priority
4.5.1
species, and control the spread of INNS plants and have been incorporated into the
management strategy. These are outlined in Appendices A-G.

4.6
Planting Proposals
i.
Overview
A palette of native tree and shrub planting has been compiled to meet the various
4.6.1
planting proposals identified below. The function of the planting is primarily to help
integrate the various components of the Project into the local landscape and views
whilst providing biodiversity value by enhancing existing habitats and creating new
habitats.
ii.
Woodland Planting
Woodland structure planting is proposed adjacent to the Generating Equipment
4.6.2
Site to assist in screening lower level structures from view and to assist in
integrating the Project Site within the immediate landscape (refer to ES Figure
3.6c). Woodland planting is also proposed along the western edge of the Ecological
Mitigation Area (refer to ES Figure 3.6c).
The western edge of the Ecological Mitigation Area will be planted with a row of
4.6.3
trees native to the local area. The trees will be allowed to mature and will create a
linkage between a row of trees in the north and the watercourse in the south (Afon
Llan). A mixture of standards and feathered will be used. This area compensates
for the loss of the woodland habitat within Lletty-Morfil SINC.
Indicative typical species will include the following:
4.6.4
·
Betula pendula (silver birch);
·
Betula pubescens (downy birch);
·
Quercus robur (pedunculate oak);
·
Salix alba (white willow);
·
Alnus glutinosa (Alder)
·
Ilex aquifolium (holly); and
·
Corylus avellana (hazel).
iii.
Woodland Edge Scrub Planting
The Woodland Planting above will grade into an area of scrub habitat within the
4.6.5
Ecological Mitigation Area refer to ES Figure 3.6c). Species will comprise those
native to the local area and include species capable of thriving in a wetter
environment. The scrub will be allowed to mature and be managed to have a
scalloped edge. This area compensates for the loss of the scrub habitat.
Indicative typical species will include the following:
4.6.6
·
Crataegus monogyna (hawthorn);
·
Prunus spinosa (blackthorn) and,
·
Sorbus aucuparia (rowan); and,
·
Eupatorium cannabinum (hemp agrimony; and
·
Filipendula ulmaria (meadowsweet).
Landscape and Ecology Mitigation Strategy

AECOM
10
It is anticipated that willow species and bramble will develop naturally and will not
4.6.7
require planting.
iv.
Hedgerow and Hedgerow Trees
Hedgerow and hedgerow tree planting is proposed along the Access Road (refer to
4.6.8
ES Figure 3.6e) and to the west of the AGI as well as to reinstate any hedgerow
planting removed during construction of the Gas Connection (refer to ES Figure
3.6d).
Mixed hedgerow and tree planting will provide vegetation structure and commuting
4.6.9
corridors for bats as well as integrating the new Access Road into the immediate
landscape structure. Reinstatement hedgerow planting is also proposed along the
Gas Connection corridor where hedgerows are removed and also to the west of the
AGI along an existing field boundary to provide partial screening of the AGI and
local landscape enhancement, providing continuity of hedgerow boundary planting.
Indicative typical species will include the following:
4.6.10
·
Acer campestre (field maple) Corylus avellana (hazel);
·
Crataegus monogyna (hawthorn);
·
Rosa canina (dog rose);
·
Viburnum opulus (guelder rose);
·
Prunus spinosa (blackthorn);
·
Sorbus aucuparia (rowan);
·
Ilex aquifolium (holly); and,
·
Lonicera periclymenum (honeysuckle)
v.
Wet Meadow and Acid Grassland
4.6.11 Wet meadow and acid grassland is proposed to the south of the Generating
Equipment Site within the Ecological Mitigation Area (refer to ES Figure 3.6c).
4.6.12 The Woodland Edge Planting will grade into a mosaic of marshy grassland and
acid grassland within the . Ecological Mitigation Area. The area currently supports
degraded versions of these habitat types, and a relaxation of the grazing regime
(grazed less intensively) and therefore reduction in nutrient inputs will allow a
greater botanical species diversity to develop without the need for seeding or plant
plugs. The enhancements in this area compensate for the loss of the marshy
grassland habitat within Lletty-Morfil SINC within the Generating Equipment Site.
vi.
Wetland Habitat and New Drainage Routes
4.6.13 Two new ponds will be created within the Wet Meadow and Acid Grassland of the
Ecological Mitigation Area to the south of the Generating Equipment Site. The
ponds will be at least 2 m x 2 m and have shallow sides to allow animals to
enter/exit the pond freely and should taper to a depth of at least 0.5 m in the centre.
The pond will be planted with native plant species and will not be stocked with fish.
Landscape and Ecology Mitigation Strategy
Prepared for: Abergelli Power Limited
AECOM
11
This will give native amphibians and invertebrates the best chance of colonising the
pond. The creation of two ponds for wildlife compensates for the loss of the ponds
within the Project Site.
4.6.14 Within the Generating Equipment Site (ES Figure 3.6c), adjacent to the Access
Road (ES Figure 3.6c) and AGI (ES Figure 3.6d) the attenuation ponds will be
planted with emergent native wetland species and where possible maintained as
wetland features.
4.6.15 New ditches and rerouted ditches (Generating Equipment Site – ES Figure 3.6b)
will be planted with emergent native wetland species and where possible
maintained as wetland features.
4.6.16 Typical species will be determined at detailed design stage, as the species
proposed will likely differ between waterbodies, depending on the aspect of the
waterbody, substrate, the profile of the water body and potential water depth.
4.7
Management and Maintenance
vii.
Management Aims
This section sets out the management and maintenance objectives for the
4.7.1
protection and enhancement of the landscape and biodiversity fabric of the Project
Site. A detailed landscape management and maintenance plan will be developed
alongside the detailed landscape and ecological design. The maintenance and
management plan will cover a 25 year period covering the operational design
lifetime of the Project. Within the first five years after planting, all plants found to be
dead or dying will be replaced within the first available planting season.
In general terms the landscape and ecological management aims for the Project
4.7.2
Site are to:
·
Secure the long-term future of the landscape;
·
Enhance local landscape character;
·
Integrate the Site into the surrounding landscape and local views;
·
Retain and manage existing woodland/hedgerow and scrub planting and
provide additional supplementary planting to provide links for wildlife across the
site;
·
Create, maintain and enhance habitats of value to wildlife to provide benefits
for the local environment and biodiversity;
·
Create marshy habitats in conjunction with the attenuation areas for
amphibians and aquatic invertebrates; and,
·
Establish a flexible management and maintenance regime able to respond to
changing needs or objectives.
Landscape and Ecology Mitigation Strategy

AECOM
12
i.
New Tree and Shrub Planting
Tree and shrub planting shall be subject to routine maintenance operations that
4.7.3
include pruning, litter picking, prevention of weeds and invasive species. The
maintenance regime will seek to:
·
To create and maintain a vegetation structure, horticultural interest and to
partially screen the built structures and movement within the Project Site; and
·
To extend and enhance habitat diversity in a variety of different areas, including
corridors for commuter bats.
ii.
Management Aims – Grassland
Both wet meadow grassland and acid grassland areas will be subject to a similar
4.7.4
maintenance regime. Both areas shall ensure a healthy sward of native wildflowers
and grasses which will increase biodiversity as well as create visual interest. The
maintenance regime will seek to:
·
Maintain the quality and integrity of the ditches, such that they are free of litter,
tree roots and invasive species;
·
To establish and maintain species-rich swards of wet meadow and species rich
swards, including wildflowers that support invertebrate larvae and flowers that
attract pollinating bees, butterflies, moths and other invertebrates; and
·
Sward management to ensure the sward is longest in the summer and shorter
in the spring and autumn will allow flowering species to set seed and
germinate.
4.8
Roles and Responsibilities
Roles and responsibilities for implementation of the landscape and ecological
4.8.1
mitigation measures during the construction phase are identified in the outline
CEMP (Appendix 3.1).
Management of habitat enhancement measures during the operational phase will
4.8.2
be secured via landowner agreements. .
[APL is currently investigating securing
the involvement of the current landowners in the management of ecological areas
including via grazing and management agreements].
4.9
Reinstatement
Reinstatement of temporary construction areas and working widths will be
4.9.1
undertaken as soon as reasonably practical once construction has ceased. Prompt
implementation of reinstatement and restoration measures aim to reduce the
effects of:
·
Compaction of subsoil, which can lead to inhibited drainage and root growth;
·
Exposed ground, which can cause loss of topsoil, dust and water pollution
through wind blow and erosion; and
·
Visual intrusion.
Landscape and Ecology Mitigation Strategy
Prepared for: Abergelli Power Limited
AECOM
13
Planned reinstatement at the Project Site includes the following considerations and
4.9.2
measures:
·
Land reinstatement should normally take place in the autumn following the
construction phase. The length of the Gas Pipeline route will be reinstated to its
original condition and returned to its previous use;
·
Where compaction may have occurred a ‘sub-soiler’, which lifts and shatters
the subsoil will be used before the topsoil is reinstated;
·
Topsoil that has been stored in the Laydown Area will be spread and levelled
across the width of the strip, using hydraulic excavators or bulldozers. In areas
where stones have been brought to the surface, stone picking will be carried
out mechanically;
·
The finish in which the soil is left will be agreed with the relevant land occupier.
Land to be reinstated as grassland will either be reseeded in the autumn or the
following spring. Reptile fences will remain in place until the grass crop is
established;
·
Temporary construction fences will be removed once agreement has been
reached with the landowners that the land over which temporary possession
powers have been exercised has been reinstated and can be handed back to
the landowner, and no later than three months from completion of construction
and
·
Hedgerows will be reinstated in the first planting season following the
completion of construction and land reinstatement work.
The following general reinstatement good practice measures that will be adopted:
4.9.3
·
Reinstatement will be carried out as soon as possible following any vegetation
stripping to ensure integrity is maintained;
·
The reinstatement of the construction areas will be undertaken to the standard
to be agreed with CCS, using the existing soil and vegetation wherever
possible;
·
Stripped soil will be reinstated as close to where it was removed as possible;
·
Subsoil, topsoil and turf will be replaced in the same order as removed;
·
Restoration works will be carried out in suitable weather conditions noting that
wet ground conditions can be difficult, as can hot, dry and windy spells; and
·
Natural regeneration of habitats will be promoted in all appropriate areas as
advised by the Environmental Manager or ECoW.

Appendix A Reptiles
1.
These measures will be applicable to the following Project components:
·
Generating Equipment Site;
·
Access Road;
·
Electrical Connection; and
·
Gas Connection.
2.
The risk of reptiles and the mitigation measures discussed below will be included in
the site induction package and prior to any site clearance and construction tasks.
3.
The trapping and translocation programme has been designed following the
guidance set out in Herpetofauna Groups of Britain and Ireland 1998 publication
(HGBI, 1998).
4.
Due to the ‘Good’ population of common lizard and the presence of low numbers of
grass snakes within the survey area a trapping and translocation programme will be
undertaken to help protect any reptiles from being injured or killed.  Due to the
presence of suitable habitat for adder, the programme includes measures for this
species.  The actions involved in the proposed trapping and translocation are
detailed below.
Fencing
5.
Any construction areas suitable or known to support reptiles, including any routes in
and out, areas for site compounds, offices or storage of materials/waste, will be
fenced off using suitable fencing to limit reptiles attempting to enter the site from
the adjacent land.
6.
Fencing should remain in situ for the duration of construction to help limit the re-
colonisation of the Project Site by reptiles. Depending on the construction duration
it may be suitable to use recycled HDPE plastic semi-permanent, rigid reptile
fencing with a 50 mm return folded and welded into the top edge forming an
overlap to comply with EN guidelines and 100 mm underground return. It provides
a reptile barrier that is highly resistant to vandalism and general site damage. Drift
fencing can be used for construction duration lasting 18 months or less.
7.
Fencing will be installed by a suitable contractor under the supervision of an
ecologist. Contractors will be given a toolbox talk prior to works commencing, and
advised on the identification of reptiles, what reptiles were expected on site, the
legal protection afforded by reptiles, and how to safely move reptiles to avoid injury
or killing.
8.
Any areas subject to machines tracking over or repeated foot traffic, as well as the
route of the fence line, will be hand searched by an ecologist for the presence of
reptiles. Reptiles encountered will be captured by hand and moved out of the way
into suitable habitat (see ‘Translocation Area’ below). The routes will then be mown
Landscape and Ecology Mitigation Strategy

AECOM
17
to a height of less than 150 mm and maintained as such for the duration of the
fencing installation.
9.
No vehicles, machinery or materials will be stored in areas suitable for supporting
reptiles without first being checked by an ecologist; preference will be given to
those areas not suitable for supporting reptiles.
10.
No construction activities, including pedestrian access will be allowed outside of the
fenced areas in habitat suitable for supporting reptiles.
Trapping and Translocation
11.
Artificial refugia comprising approximately 1 m x 0.5 m square sheets of heavy-duty
mineral roofing felt, corrugated iron and carpet tiles will be placed at a density of
50/ha in suitable habitat within the fenced area to attract reptiles.
12.
The refugia will be left to ‘bed-in’ and will remain undisturbed for a period of at least
fourteen days. After the ‘bedding-in’ period, each day, up to twice a day for a
minimum of 60 days, an ecologist will check the refugia for the presence of reptiles.
Any reptiles or amphibians found will be captured for relocation into suitable habitat
outside of the fenced areas. After 60 days, the trapping can cease once there have
been five consecutive days where no reptiles have been found.
13.
After the fenced area has been cleared of reptiles and prior to soil stripping the
vegetation can undergo a process of habitat management and hand searches for
reptiles. Supervision of the soil strip during construction work by a suitably qualified
ecologist will be required to help protect injury or killing of reptiles.
14.
Any litter or rubble piles will be removed by hand under the supervision of an
ecologist to avoid injuring or killing any reptiles. If the material is too heavy to be
removed by hand it will be done so using a mini excavator carefully and slowly
removing the material, under the supervision of an ecologist.
15.
Any amphibians captured during the reptile trapping programme will be moved to a
suitable location within the Project Site Boundary.
Translocation Area
16.
During the reptile survey, very few numbers of reptiles were found within the
footprint of the Project; the majority of reptiles were found along the Gallops. Due to
the relatively low numbers of reptiles likely to be present within the fenced area it is
considered appropriate to move any captured reptiles to the areas of habitat
suitable for supporting reptiles that are to be retained outside of the fenced area.
Habitat Manipulation and Destructive Search
17.
Once capture rates decrease significantly habitat manipulation will be used to
enhance the process. This involves reducing the amount of suitable vegetation
cover by strimming the vegetation between the refugia mats (leaving a 10cm buffer
around the edge of each refugia mat) to a height of no less than 100mm, after 48
Landscape and Ecology Mitigation Strategy

AECOM
18
hours the cut will be repeated to ground level, concentrating the remaining reptiles
to the retained vegetation and refugia. Naturally occurring refugia (stones, rocks,
litter etc) will be hand searched by and ecologist before being removed and located
within the receptor area. After which the final remaining areas of vegetation and
refugia will be cut to ground level and removed following a final check for reptiles by
an ecologist; any reptiles found will be removed and located within the receptor
area.
18.
Contractors will be given a toolbox talk prior to habitat manipulation works
commencing, and will be advised on the identification of reptiles, what reptiles are
expected on site, the legal protection afforded by reptiles, and how to safely move
reptiles to avoid injury or killing. Any that reptiles identified during the strimming
works will be moved by hand into suitable habitat outside of the fenced area. An
ecologist will provide ecological support and advice during the works.
Timing
19.
A method statement detailing the location and specification of fencing, timing and
methodology for the management of reptiles will be submitted to CCS (in
conjunction with NRW) for approval.

2.
To avoid destruction of active bird nests or eggs, vegetation clearance works
should be undertaken between September – February inclusive. Should works be
required from 1 March – end August then an ecologist should inspect the area to be
cleared no more than 48 hours prior to works. Should any active nests be found,
works will have to halt in this area until the chicks have fledged and no longer
return to the nest, which can take up to eight weeks. Should a nest be found a
species-specific buffer should be implemented.

Roosting Bats
2.
Pre-construction checks will be undertaken on trees and any hedgerows prior to
their removal for their current suitability for supporting roosting bats.
3.
Checks will be undertaken to allow time for any follow up (emergence and re-entry)
surveys to be undertaken and an application for a European Protected Species
License (EPSL) should any works require a confirmed roost to be destroyed.
4.
The survey results will be used to inform any further mitigation to seek to avoid
impacts on roosting bats.
Commuting and Foraging Bats
5.
New planting will include wooded linear features to create new commuting and
foraging routes linking existing rows of trees to the Afon Llan.
6.
To allow bats to continue to use commuting and foraging routes during
construction, the connectivity of tree lines and hedgerows along the Gas
Connection, Access Road and Electrical Connection routes will be maintained
utilising ‘brown hedgerows’ of brash. At least one hour before sunset key linear
features as identified in ES Figure 3.6e will be reinstated utilising brash.
Access Road
7.
To maintain connectivity post-construction, replacement planting of trees removed
to facilitate the construction of the Access Road (including the new section of
Access Road) should be undertaken. Using standards of the same species as
those trees removed, trees will be planted along the existing boundary tree lines up
to the edge of the Access Road. Over time the canopies will grow closer together
thereby creating a linear feature than can be used by bats to cross the new section
of Access Road.

Water Vole
2.
A pre-construction check for water vole burrows and activity will be undertaken
where construction is present within 100 m of watercourses identified as suitable
for supporting the species during the 2017 field surveys, as identified in ES
Appendix 8.10 Figure 1.
3.
Should the pre-construction check return a negative result, habitat management will
be undertaken to help reduce the quality of the habitats for burrow creation in the
period leading up to, and for the duration of construction in that area.
4.
Should water vole be confirmed as present on watercourses within 100 m of
construction works during the pre-construction check, a Water Vole Conservation
License from Natural Resources Wales (NRW) may be required to allow works to
proceed and additional mitigation may be required.
Otter
A pre-construction check for otter holts/couches and activity will be undertaken
5.1.1
where construction is present within 100 m of watercourses identified as suitable
for supporting the species during the 2017 field surveys, as identified in ES
Appendix 8.10 Figure 1. A pre-construction check for otter holts/couches and
activity will be undertaken where construction is present within 100 m of
watercourses identified as suitable for supporting the species during the 2017 field

Should the pre-construction check return a negative result, habitat management will
5.1.2
be undertaken to help reduce the quality of the habitats for holt/couch creation for
the period leading up to, and for the duration of construction in that area. Should
otter be confirmed as present on watercourses within 100 m of construction works

2.
An updated INNS survey (Invasive Species Assessment – ISA) will be undertaken
to accurately assess INNS and extents within the Project Site boundary prior to the
implementation of control measures and a site specific Invasive Non Native
Species Protocol will be produced that elaborates on the outline recommendations
provided below.
3.
Many remediation options are available for the management of invasive species. All
control options will be considered to identify appropriate management actions
relevant in the context of controlling Schedule 9 species on land impacted by the
proposed works.
4.
The optimal control measures for the proposed works will involve a combination of
biosecurity precautions (i.e. good site hygiene) and mechanical and/or chemical
treatment.
Biosecurity Precautions
5.
At a minimum, the following biosecurity measures will be implemented when
working within the Project Site:
·
All appropriate staff members will be made aware of the locations of INNS and
will be informed of the necessary precautions required to prevent spread. This
will include informing personnel who might come into contact with any of the
species of the requirements to prevent spread (e.g. during vegetation
clearance, and vegetation management).
·
A toolbox talk will be provided by a suitably qualified Ecological Clerk of Works
(ECoW) at the onset of works, providing details on identification and the
required biosecurity precautions. An ECoW will be present during all works to
help implement biosecurity measures.
·
Clearance works should avoid the period when Himalayan balsam has ripe
seeds. When seeds ripen is dependent on the weather that year, but typically
the period is from July until the end of October.
·
Vegetation clearance works will be undertaken methodically; commencing in
areas with no presence of INNS, then working through areas with increasing
levels of infestation. This will help prevent works spreading seeds and
contaminated soils to areas onsite that are not currently infested.
·
Clearance works will avoid the area with INNS if the infestation is outside the
treatment area or until treatment on the species has been completed. Before
any treatment commences, if there is risk of vehicular or pedestrian incursion

into the area where INNS are growing then the plant stems will be fenced with
temporary orange mesh fencing. Default stand-off distances are provided
below. It may be possible to reduce these distances following the ISA, based
on the data collected.
·
Vehicular and people movements will be restricted to specific routes within the
Project Site thereby helping to limit the spread of seeds and contaminated soils
around Site.
·
Cleaning stations will be set up at designated entry/exit points to demarcated
areas. A jet wash should be available for vehicles and brushes and buckets of
water should be available for clothing and equipment.
·
No plant, equipment or personnel should leave a demarcated area without
ensuring that all mud and/or plant material has been removed from vehicles,
equipment and clothing/footwear.
·
Any soil within demarcated areas will be considered to potentially contain INNS
material (seeds etc.). When soils potentially containing viable INNS material
seeds are taken off Site, such soils are classified as controlled waste and there
is a duty of care for their proper disposal, i.e. the soil must be transported by an
appropriately licensed carrier and disposed of at an appropriately licensed
waste disposal facility.
·
Personnel will be reminded of biosecurity requirements at the start of each
work day and should be updated on any changes to management plans, i.e.
information on the locations of any newly identified stands.
·
Following the ISA, where additional biosecurity hazards are identified, they will
be incorporated into the Invasive and Non Native Species Protocol.
Control
6.
Potential control measures have been provided for each species identified within
the Project Site Boundary below. Following the ISA a single actionable option will
be specified for each stand, based on the recommendations below, in combination
with a review of site development plans and activities.
Himalayan Balsam
7.
Away from watercourses, depending on development plans, stands within working
areas or stands within 6 m of a working area will be controlled by a combination of:
·
Herbicide treatment (potentially followed by hand removal once the quantity of
plants has been reduced):
·
excavation and (i) burial or (ii) offsite disposal; and
·
raising the soil profile above existing stands, thus preventing future growth
8.
Any herbicide treatments will use appropriate herbicide, which will be applied by an
appropriately qualified contractor.
9.
Seeds from Himalayan balsam typically remain viable for 18 months in soil. Follow-
up monitoring of the treated stands will confirm treatment has been successful
when no new seeds have germinated; after which the soil is considered inert
Landscape and Ecology Mitigation Strategy
Prepared for: Abergelli Power Limited
AECOM
25
(assuming no other contaminates are present). Typical treatment periods are for 2
years of control action followed by at least a 1 year monitoring period. Herbicide
should be applied three times in the year.
10.
Where excavation is required, the recommended excavation area is 6 m radius to a
30 cm depth, although through the commissioning of soil core analysis it may be
possible to reduce the depth at which soil needs to be removed. The excavated
material will need to be disposed of as controlled waste or buried within the Project
Site.
11.
Where the soil profile is raised, 30 cm soil is sufficient to prevent regrowth.
12.
Where Himalayan balsam is growing next to a watercourse control will not be
effective in the long term, since new seeds will travel from further up the catchment
(where Himalayan balsam is abundant) and re-colonise the area. In such areas,
management will focus on containment (i.e. implementation of biosecurity
protocols).
Japanese Knotweed
13.
In areas where there is a risk of spreading Japanese knotweed (stands within 7 m
of access routes and storage compounds – following the ISA and through risk
assessment is may be possible to reduce this distance to 4 m), the stands will be
managed appropriately. A single actionable option for each stand will be determined
for each stand with takes account of development plans. Options include:
·
Herbicide treatment;
·
Rhizome fragmentation and cultivation (e.g. soil rotation) to stimulate growth
and reduce herbicide treatment time requirements;
·
excavation and (i) stockpiling, (ii) burial or (ii) offsite disposal; and
·
raising the soil profile above existing stands, thus preventing future growth.
14.
Any soil containing Japanese knotweed material will be removed from the Project
Site following the appropriate duty of care, or buried within the Project Site.
15.
To reduce the risk of spread and future growth, a herbicide treatment programme
will commence as far in advance of construction works as is practical. Typical
treatment periods are for 3 years followed by a 2 year monitoring period. However,
mature stands can take significantly longer to successfully treat. The presence of
mature stands will be identified as part of the ISA. Herbicide should be applied
once in the year.
16.
Where herbicide treatment is used in isolation there is a risk that dormant but viable
rhizomatous material remains underground after treatment appears successful
above ground, and as such the soil in such areas should not be disturbed and if it is
subsequently removed, it remains classified as controlled waste moving forward.
17.
Where the soil profile is to be raised above Japanese knotweed, the plants should
first be treated with herbicide in advance for as long as possible. Depending of
Landscape and Ecology Mitigation Strategy
Prepared for: Abergelli Power Limited
AECOM
26
maturity and time scales, it may be beneficial to lay a geomembrane in the area
prior to raising the soil level.
Floating Pennywort
18.
There is one pond recorded as supporting floating pennywort in 2014. The pond is
under the footprint of the proposed Power Generation Plant and is not
hydrologically connected to any other waterbodies or watercourses. As such, the
pond can be infilled with inert soil and then built on. No material or water will be
removed from the pond.
Rhododendron and Montbretia
19.
The ISA will be used to confirm locations and extents.
20.
Montbretia is located on the edge of the Access Road, and should be treated by
herbicide at the same time as the other species. The corms react well to herbicide
treatment, and since the plant does not produce viable seed, this course of action
will be effective at controlling the plant.
21.
Rhododendron is present within the woodland which is not being disturbed during
the construction of the Project. As such, there is no risk of causing the spread of
rhododendron as the seeds produced by rhododendron will not establish in the
disturbed soils of a development site (such seeds require very specific conditions to
germinate AND establish).

Appendix G Hedgerows
1.
These measures will be applicable to the following Project components:
·
Access Road;
·
Electrical Connection; and
·
Gas Connection.
2.
To allow bats to continue to use commuting and foraging routes during
construction, the connectivity of tree lines and hedgerows along the Gas
Connection, Access Road and Electrical Connection routes will be maintained
utilising ‘brown hedgerows’ of brash. At least one hour before sunset key linear
features as identified in ES Figure 3.6 will be reinstated utilising brash.
3.
On completion of construction works the hedgerow gaps will be reinstated by
planting species typical of the hedgerow as whips of four per metre in a double
staggered row. Shrubs will be bare rooted and comprise 1.5 m size class. Spiral
guards will be used to help prevent damage from rabbits. Some brash can be left in
situ to help maintain the linear feature whilst the whips are establishing.
4.
In the two winters following planting, any dead shrubs should be replaced with the
same species mix as the original planted.
5.
The grass around the base of the trees/shrubs (0.5 m diameter) should be killed at
least once annually using an approved non residual herbicide for three years
following planting.
6.
Additional hedgerow planting is covered in Planting Proposals Section 4.6.

Outline Surface Water Management Plan
1.1
Introduction
1.1.1
The objective of the Surface Water Management Plan (STMP) is to detail the water
management
principles and procedures to be implemented throughout the
construction period of the Abergelli Power Project (the ‘Project’). The SWMP is
designed to ensure
compliance with surface water protection legislative
requirements, Environmental Statement (ES) commitments and environmental
permits conditions during construction.
1.1.2
This Outline SWMP has been developed by the applicant, Abergelli Power Limited
(APL), and will be adopted and implemented by the main contractor upon
appointment. It will be the responsibility of APL to ensure the Project is executed in
a manner that demonstrates commitment to the care and protection of the aquatic
environment.
1.1.3
After appointment of the main contractor, this Outline SWMP will be reviewed to
include any additional requirements of the main contractor’s own environmental
policies. The measures and procedures set out in the SWMP will feed-in to the
detailed design process and the development of Construction Method Statements
(CMS). This will include the selection and design of surface water drainage for the
construction phase. The CMS will be submitted to the City and County of Swansea
Council (CCS) and Natural Resource Wales (NRW) for approval as part of
applications for temporary works environmental permits. On approval of the CMS,
the SWMP will then be updated to include the finalised details for the construction
surface water drainage.
1.1.4
The SWMP will be a ‘live’ document, which will be kept under continuous review by
the main contractor. This is to take into account any additional environmental
information obtained during the detailed design and construction phases, changes
in legislation, policy and best practice, and any lessons learned on the Project. It
will also allow for the inclusion of any further conditions and amendments that arise
from the granting of any temporary works environmental permits, a review of
environmental monitoring results or the legitimate concerns of Third Parties.
1.1.5
In implementing this plan, the main contractor will ensure that the measures and
procedures are followed in accordance with the Outline Construction Environment
Management Plan (CEMP) (Appendix 3.1).
1.2
Project Site Surface Water Features
1.2.1
The Project Site lies within the Afon Llan River catchment. The Afon Llan flows in a
south-westerly direction past the southern boundary of the Project Site and links
with the Afon Lliw and the River Loughor, before discharging into Carmarthen Bay.
Outline Surface Water Management Plan

1.2.2
Within the Project Site itself, there are a number of small drainage ditches and land
drains, as well as springs and spring-drainage rivulets that drain into the Afon Llan.
There are two heavily vegetated ponds located within the Generating Equipment
Site. These are of unverified extent owing to vegetation cover but are thought to
have a radius of approximately 5 m.
1.3
Guidance

1.4
Water Management Measures
a)
Drainage Management
1.4.1
Information on the proposed design of the drainage system for the Project Site
during the construction phase is available in Chapter 3: Project and Site
Description of the ES and the Flood Consequence Assessment in Appendix 9.1 of
the ES. Surface water, foul water and water potentially contaminated with oil (oily
water) will have separated drainage systems on the Project Site. Foul water and
oily water will not be directly discharged into drains or watercourse, but collected
and treated. These details will be finalised by the main contractor as part of the
detailed design.
1.4.2
Details of the proposed permanent drainage system to be implemented through the
operational phase are available in the Outline Drainage Strategy (Appendix E of the
Flood Consequences Assessment).
1.4.3
The following measures will be implemented within the design of the construction
drainage to safeguard water quality:
·
All Project Site drainage measures will be developed in consultation with NRW
prior to the commencement of construction;
·
Sequencing of work will be such that proposed drainage measures, including
flow controls and attenuation storage will be in place prior to erection of
buildings and hardstanding;
·
The construction oily water drainage will be designed in accordance with NGTS
2.20 ‘Oil Containment at Electricity Substations and Other Operational Sites’
(Ref 1.3) Oil Storage Regulations 2016 (Ref 1.7) and Pollution Prevention
Outline Surface Water Management Plan
Prepared for: Abergelli Power Limited
AECOM
3
Guidance 3: Use and Design of Oil Separators in Surface Water Drainage
Systems (Ref 1.8) or similar approved guidelines;
·
The construction surface water drainage system will adopt the principles of the
SuDs Manual (Ref 1.4) to adequately drain the Project Site and prevent
ponding; and
·
Any artificial drainage will only be installed where necessary. The individual
lengths, depths and gradients of these drains will be minimised to avoid
intercepting large volumes of diffuse overland flow and generating high velocity
flows during storm events.
b)
Control of Runoff
1.4.4
During construction and site preparation, there will be a requirement for temporary
measures to ensure controlled management of runoff draining from the Project Site.
Runoff from the Project Site will not be allowed to drain directly into any water
bodies untreated and will be collected, treated and attenuated using a range of
control measures. These will include combinations of:
·
Cut off drainage ditches;
·
Infiltration drains;
·
Suitably sized attenuation ponds with restricted discharge pipes;
·
Road side swales; and
·
Pollution control measures such as silt fencing, straw bales, sedimats and
sediment traps.
1.4.5
The arrangements of such drainage infrastructure will be set out in the detailed
design and, where appropriate, agreed with NRW
prior to construction in
accordance with the requirements of any temporary works discharge environmental
permits.
1.4.6
The above measures will ensure that any sediment or other pollutants dissolved or
carried in suspension in the surface water runoff from the Project Site will have
been treated, filtered or settled out to an acceptable level before being discharged
to a water body. Limits on the concentration of relevant physico-chemical
parameters will be agreed with NRW as part of the process of determining a
temporary works environmental permit from NRW.
1.4.7
All earthworks will be undertaken in accordance with BS6031:1981 Code of
Practice for Earth Works (Ref 1.1).  Land disturbance will be kept to a minimum and
disturbed areas will be stabilised as soon as possible after construction.
c)
Proximity to Water
1.4.8
The following good practice measures will be implemented to minimise the potential
of direct pollution to water:
·
A 10 m buffer will be applied to all Project Site watercourses. Where possible,
this buffer will not be entered by plant and machinery;
Outline Surface Water Management Plan
Prepared for: Abergelli Power Limited
AECOM
4
·
Stockpiles of excavated soils/peat will be located away from surface
watercourses and away from known surface drainage pathways as much as
possible;
·
Laydown areas and plant and machinery will be stored at least 10 m from
watercourses and where possible, in low flood risk areas; and
·
Oil storage will comply with the measures set out in the Pollution Prevention
Plan within the Outline CEMP (Appendix 3.1) including, where possible being
located at least 50 m from an open watercourse.
d)
Silt and Sediment
1.4.9
The following measures will be implemented in order to reduce the potential
generation of silt laden runoff:
·
The Project Site will be laid out to prevent runoff from stockpiles entering
watercourses. Stockpiles of soils and excavated solid material will be
surrounded at their bases by silt fencing that will be implemented as per
manufacturer guidelines to prevent contaminated run-off being generated
during inclement weather and where damping is used to prohibit dust;
·
Bare ground exposure will be minimised by only removing vegetation from
areas that require to be
exposed in the near future and completing
reinstatement as soon as practicably possible;
·
Project Site roads will be regularly maintained and kept free from sediment
deposits in order to reduce the volume of silt becoming entrained in surface
runoff and entering any watercourse or drain;
·
Mitigation will be implemented as required (silt fencing, placement of straw
bales into ditches, sedimats or similar commercially available products and
sediment traps) to intercept and collect silt, reduce runoff velocity and
encourage deposition of suspended sediment; and
·
Care will be taken during felling operations to reduce the risk of sedimentation
and erosion into the watercourses.
e)
Control of Pumped Water
1.4.10 Water pumped from excavations may contain a moderate level of suspended
solids, which if left to drain untreated, could carry sediment into Afon Llan. As noted
above, runoff from the Project Site will not be allowed to drain directly into any
watercourse and will be filtered and attenuated using a variety of methods including
silt traps and settlement lagoons.
1.4.11 If pumping is required, disposal of water pumped from excavations will be in
accordance with the following requirements:
·
APL and the main contractor will ensure that all necessary consents, permits
and licences will be obtained from NRW prior to any pumping; and
·
No discharges will be made directly to watercourses or land unless agreed with
NRW and a discharge licence will be sought.

Protection of Private Water Supplies
1.5.1
Recent (received on 9 October 2017) data on private groundwater and abstraction
licences received from CCS and NRW respectively did not identify any licences
within 4 km of the Project Site.

Introduction 
1.1 
Overview 
1.1.1 
This Outline Construction Traffic Management Plan (CTMP) has been 
prepared by AECOM on behalf of Abergelli Power Limited (APL) in respect of 
the Abergelli Power Project (referred to as 'the Project' from herein). 
1.1.2 
This document supports the Environmental Statement (ES) which is 
submitted as part of the DCO Application. A Transport Assessment (TA) has 
also been undertaken and can be found in ES Chapter 12: Traffic, 
Transport and Access. 
1.2 
The Project 
1.2.1 
The Project is situated on open agricultural land located approximately 2 km 
north of Junction 46 of the M4 within the administrative area of the City and 
County of Swansea Council (CCS), approximately 1 km southeast of 
Felindre and 1.4 km north of Llangyfelach.  
1.2.2 
The land upon which the Project would be developed, or which is required 
for construction of the Project, is referred to as the 'Project Site'. The 
approximate centre of the Project Site lies at grid reference 265284, 201431. 
The Project Site covers an area of up to approximately 30 ha. 
1.2.3 
The current land use is predominantly agricultural, with sheep and horse 
grazing. The western extent of the Project Site encompasses the existing 
Access Road leading to the Substation and Felindre Gas Compressor 
Station from the B4489. 
1.2.4 
The components of the Project are summarised in Table 1.1.

connection (the Pipeline). This is to bring natural gas to the 
Generating Equipment from the National Gas Transmission 
System. The Pipeline will follow an approximate north-
south 
route 
corridor, 
between 
the 
National 
Gas 
Transmission System south of Rhyd-y-Pandy Road and the 
Generating Equipment Site. 
Electrical 
Connection
 This is an underground electrical cable to export power 
from the Generating Equipment to the National Grid 
Electricity Transmission System (NETS). 
1.3 
Structure of Construction Traffic Management Plan 
1.3.1 
The CTMP provides a framework for addressing the transport issues 
associated with the movement of construction traffic to serve the 
construction of the Project, including movements to/from the local and 
strategic highway network, along the existing Access Road (that serves the 
National Grid premises), the new section of Access Road that will be 
constructed to serve the Power Generation Plant and the new access to the 
proposed  AGI. These will be considered with regard to routeing, signage, 
HGVs and Abnormal Indivisible Loads (AILs). 
1.3.2 
The purpose of this document is to set out the principles that APL and the 
contractor will follow to manage construction traffic during the construction of 
the Project. 
1.3.3 
The CTMP is structured as follows: 
 
Section 2 - Existing Conditions and Site Accessibility: Sets out the local 
transport conditions in the vicinity of the site and access to non-car 
modes of transport; 
 
Section 3 - Access Arrangements and Management Measures: Details 
the access arrangements to the Project Site during construction of the 
Project and the management measures to minimise the disruption on the 
highway network and internal access roads; and

Existing Conditions and Site Accessibility 
2.1 
Local Highway Network 
2.1.1 
The Project Site is served by a privately maintained Access Road from the 
B4489. The Access Road is unlit. The width of the Access Road varies along 
its length between 3.5 m and 7.5 m, and is generally bordered by trees and 
intermittent hedgerows. The Access Road connects to the B4489 via a 
simple priority junction. This is characterised by large radii on the minor arm 
(the Access Road) to accommodate HGV movements. 
2.1.2 
The B4489 routes between the village of Felindre to the north (approximately 
2.3 km from the Access Road) and the M4 Junction 46 to the south 
(approximately 1.8 km from the Access Road). The B4489 is subject to a 40 
mph speed limit at its junction with the Access Road. At this location, the 
road has a 5.5 m wide carriageway and is unlit. Approximately 330 m to the 
north of the Access Road, the B4489 becomes subject to the national speed 
limit. The B4489 continues a further 1.7 km north where it connects to Rhyd-
y-Pandy Road at a priority junction. This section of the B4489 is unlit and 
ranges in width between 4.5 m and 5.5 m, with numerous passing places. 
The junction with Rhyd-y-Pandy Road and its approaches are subject to a 30 
mph speed limit. Rhyd-y-Pandy Road routes east for 1.6 km where it passes 
the northern extent of the Project Boundary. This section of Rhyd-y-Pandy 
Road is unlit and ranges in width between 4.5 m and 5.5 m, with numerous 
passing places. It is subject to a 30 mph speed limit, increasing to the 
national speed limit around 900 m east of its junction with the B4489. It also 
serves the Felindre Water Treatment Works. 
2.1.3 
Approximately 475 m to the south of the Access Road, the B4489 is street lit. 
A further 75 m south from this point, the B4489 forms a three-arm 
roundabout with the access to the Felindre Park and Share. 
2.1.4 
On an average weekday, the B4489 carries approximately 130 vehicles 
during the AM peak hour, 90 vehicles during the PM peak hour, and 1,000 
vehicles over the 24-hour period. HGVs account for no more than 2% of total 
traffic. 
2.1.5 
The B4489 forms a dumbbell roundabout with the M4 Junction 46. The 
northern dumbbell roundabout junction comprises three arms; the B4489 
and the eastbound on/off-slips of the M4. The southern dumbbell roundabout 
junction comprises six arms; the A48 (three arms), the B4489 Swansea 
Road, and the westbound on/off-slips of the M4. The south-eastern arm of 
the A48 forms a mini-roundabout junction with Pant Lasau Road 
approximately 90 m southeast of the southern dumbbell roundabout. These 
junctions are subject to a 40 mph speed limit and are lit.

2.2 
Walking and Cycling 
2.2.1 
The walking and cycling facilities and Public Rights of Way (PROW) are 
shown on Figure 2.1. 
2.2.2 
There are no footways that serve the Project Site. The nearest footways are 
on the B4489, approximately 475m south of the Access Road (on the 
approach to the junction with the Felindre Park and Share). This footway 
continues to the M4 Junction 46. The 500 m section of the footway to the 
north of the M4 Junction 46 is separated from the carriageway edge by a 
barrier. At the M4 Junction 46 the footways continues south along the east 
side of the carriageway, serving the southern arms of the southern dumbbell 
roundabout, with dropped kerbs and tactile paving to facilitate crossing 
movements across entry arms. 
2.2.3 
There are no formal cycling routes in the vicinity of the Project Site. Part of 
the B4489 is identified as an ‘advisory cycling route’ on the CCS’s cycle 
map. This covers the section of the B4489 that routes north from the Access 
Road to Felindre and to a point approximately 475 m south of the Access 
Road. 
2.2.4 
There are numerous PROW crossing/in the vicinity of the Project Site. 
Footpaths LC34 and LC117 cross the Access Road (and the new section of 
Access Road) at points approximately 350 m and 1.3 km from the B4489. 
Footpath LC35B passes through the northern part of the Project Site, 
connecting to Rhyd-y-Pandy Road in the vicinity of the AGI Access. 
2.3 
Public Transport 
2.3.1 
The nearest bus stop to the Project Site is the 'Lliw Reservoirs' stop located 
on Rhyd-y-Pandy Road. This is situated to the east of Felindre and 
approximately 500 m to the northwest of the northern extent of the Project 
Site boundary. There is no footway between the Project Site and this bus 
stop. It provides access to Service 142, which routes between Morriston and 
Garnswllt. This service is operated by DANSA, a community transport 
organisation. There are three to four services per day in each direction, 
although these can generally only be pre-booked. 
2.3.2 
Service 141 passes to the south of the Project Site, routeing between 
Gorseinon and Morriston. The nearest stop that provides access to this 
service is the 'Pant Lasau Cross' stop located on Mynydd Gelli Wastad 
Road. It is situated approximately 750 m to the southeast of the southern 
extent of the Project Site boundary and can be accessed via Footpath 
LC117.

2.3.3 
There are no railway stations in the vicinity of the Project Site. Llansamlet 
railway station is situated approximately 5.5 km southeast of the Project Site, 
accessible by car via the A48 (from M4 Junction 44 and 46). Swansea 
railway station is a further 7 km from the Project Site; this is a key local 
transport hub and is more easily accessible by public transport. Swansea 
railway station is managed by Arriva Trains Wales. There are four services 
daily from Swansea to Shrewsbury; an hourly service from Swansea to 
Manchester Piccadilly, which calls at Cardiff Central; and a total of two to 
three services hourly from Swansea to Cardiff Central. Great Western 
Railway also provides services from Swansea to London Paddington, calling 
at Bristol Parkway. 
2.3.4 
Overall, the opportunities to access the Project Site by public transport are 
limited, and it is therefore considered that, for the purposes of this 
assessment, no trips by construction, maintenance and permanent staff will 
be undertaken by these modes. 
2.4 
Parking 
2.4.1 
Felindre Park and Share is accessed from the B4489, approximately 550 m 
south of the Access Road. It is located on the site of the proposed Felindre 
Business Park. It has capacity for 480 spaces and its use is encouraged for 
employees of the DVLA HQ in Clase. A shuttle bus service runs between the 
Felindre Park and Share and the DVLA. The Felindre Park and Share is 
understood to be managed by the DVLA and will not be available for use by 
the Project. 
2.4.2 
A layby is located adjacent to the northbound carriageway of the B4489, 
approximately 800 m from the M4 Junction 46, and 950 m from the Access 
Road. The layby measures approximately 50 m in length.

Access Arrangements and Management Measures 
3.1 
Construction Access Routes 
3.1.1 
The access route to the Project Site comprises four parts. These and the 
associated management measures along the route are set out under the 
following sub-headings and shown on Figure 3.1. 
Local/Strategic Highway Network to Existing Access Road 
3.1.2 
Access to the Project Site (from the public highway) will be from the B4489. 
Construction traffic will route to/from the M4 Junction 46, located 
approximately 1.8 km from the Access Road. This section of the route is 
approximately 2 km in length. This route would be used during both the 
construction and operational phases of the Project. 
3.1.3 
A layby is located adjacent to the northbound carriageway of the B4489, 
approximately 950 m from the Access Road. The layby measures 
approximately 50 m in length, which is sufficient storage capacity for two 
HGVs, as shown on Figure 3.2. HGVs travelling to the Project Site will be 
instructed to enter the layby before proceeding to the Access Road. On 
arrival at the layby, HGVs will contact a Site Representative (Site 
Representative A) to be stationed at a holding area located approximately 40 
m along the Access Road (east of the gates to the Access Road). Site 
Representative A will advise whether the holding area has capacity to 
accommodate HGVs, instructing HGVs to wait at the layby/proceed to the 
site as appropriate. The layby will be subject to a Temporary Traffic 
Regulation Order (TTRO) for closure to non-construction traffic during the 
construction phase to ensure that the layby has capacity to accommodate 
HGVs. 
Existing Access Road (B4489 to National Grid) 
3.1.4 
The second part of the construction access route is along the existing 
Access Road which currently serves the National Grid premises. This is 
approximately 1 km in length between the B4489 at the western extent and 
the National Grid car park in the east. There are also additional adjoining 
accesses to National Grid areas along this route. A new section of Access 
Road will be constructed to serve the Project Site off the existing Access 
Road (discussed at Paragraph 3.1.6). 
Abergelli Power Project 
 
Abergelli Power Limited 
 
 
 
Prepared for:  Abergelli Power Limited   
 
AECOM 
12 
 
3.1.5 
HGV movements along the existing Access Road will be managed by 
construction staff so that no two-way traffic movements are undertaken along 
the affected section of Access Road while an HGV is routeing along the 
Access Road. This will be managed by Site Representative A and a site 
representative (Site Representative B) located near the access to the new 
section of Access Road and in close proximity to the bend immediately after 
the existing height restricting frame, who will be in contact via radio. Traffic 
associated with the construction activities will be held at these locations and 
priority will be given to all National Grid vehicles and employees. 
New Section of Access Road 
3.1.6 
A new section of Access Road will be constructed between the existing 
Access Road and the Laydown Area within the Project Site. This will 
commence at a point around 850 m along the existing Access Road. 
3.1.7 
HGV movements along the new section of Access Road will be managed by 
construction staff so that no resultant two-way traffic movements are 
experienced along the existing Access Road or at the junction of the two 
routes. This will be managed by Site Representative B and, if found to be 
required, a further site representative (Site Representative C) will be located 
within the Project Site (at the Laydown Area), who will be in contact via radio. 
Any HGV movements will be managed out of the new section of Access 
Road as appropriate. This will ensure priority is given to National Grid 
vehicles and employees on the existing Access Road. 
AGI Access 
3.1.8 
The construction route to the AGI will result in the use of a section of the 
B4489 to the north of the existing Access Road. This continues 
approximately 2.1 km north before continuing east along Rhyd-y-Pandy 
Road for approximately 1.5 km. Much of the AGI access route is constrained 
in terms of two-way movement. Construction activities associated with the 
AGI will be undertaken over two quarterly periods, with up to 30 HGV 
movements per day. 
3.1.9 
The HGVs associated with the AGI will continue to the site without the need 
for being held. The AGI access will be managed by the construction team 
and will not be in use by third parties, as is the case for the existing National 
Grid access. 
3.1.10 An alternative route via Rhyd-y-Pandy Road has been considered. This 
suffers from similar constraints to the route proposed, but would involve 
routeing via Pant-Lasau. Experience of this route gives us knowledge of the 
Local Highway Authority's (LHA’s) concerns of the local roads being beyond 
theoretical vehicular capacity in the peak hour periods. In addition to this, the 
route passes through more residential areas and there could be issues with 
Morriston Hospital traffic. On this basis, it is considered more appropriate for 
the AGI construction traffic to access the north of the site using the B4489.

3.2 
AIL Routeing 
3.2.1 
An AIL is a vehicle that has any of the following: 
 
A weight of more than 44 tonnes; 
 
An axle load of more than 10 tonnes for a single non-driving axle  and 
11.5 tonnes for a single driving axle; 
 
A width of more than 2.9m; and 
 
A length of more than 18.65m. 
3.2.2 
The shape and scale of these loads will be refined as the construction 
process develops in more detail. At this stage, we have taken instruction 
from the current design and from previous experience from within the 
Applicant team. There are expected to be two AILs; these are likely to be 
around 5 m in width, potentially 6.5 m in height and up to around 50 m in 
length. The total vehicle weight could be up to 400 tonnes per vehicle. The 
new section of Access Road has been designed to accommodate these 
vehicles, and provision will made along the Access Road through widening 
as appropriate. These loads will be travelling with a full complement of 
technical operators, mobile safety entourage and police escort. It is assumed 
that the heavy and large equipment will arrive via water transport to either 
Swansea or Port Talbot Docks. The route to the Project Site will be confined 
to the strategic highway network wherever possible and will take as direct a 
route as available given the local circumstances. The pre-planning and lead 
up time required for the transportation of such loads will ensure that all 
appropriate measures are in place and relevant authorities are notified. 
3.2.3 
Once the Contractor has been appointed, and prior to transportation of the 
first AIL, an access route survey report will be produced by the haulage 
company to identify any pinch-points requiring mitigation (such as temporary 
removal of road traffic signs). The access route survey report will detail: 
 
Preferred ports of entry; 
 
Delivery routes; 
 
Potential pinch-points and any street furniture removal/temporary 
highway alterations required; and 
 
Delivery vehicles. 
3.3 
Haulage Responsibilities for AILs 
3.3.1 
The following requirements will be the responsibility of the haulage 
companies during the delivery of AIL components: 
 
The tendering process for the construction of the site will ensure that AIL 
drivers and their convoy are fully aware of the access route and do not 
deviate from this; 
Abergelli Power Project 
 
Abergelli Power Limited 
 
 
 
Prepared for:  Abergelli Power Limited   
 
AECOM 
14 
 
 
Deliveries should only take place during the hours agreed with the 
Police, LHA (CCS) and South Wales Trunk Road Agent (SWTRA); 
 
Peak traffic periods and school run periods will be avoided when timing 
deliveries to and from the Project Site; 
 
Deliveries on a Saturday between 08.00 and 13.00 may be undertaken if 
this is acceptable to the Police, LHA and SWTRA; 
 
Written notification of the commencement of the delivery period(s) 
should be given to the Police, LHA and SWTRA, within an agreed 
timescale, to allow for the safe coordination of the work; and 
 
Further temporary warning signs may be provided on the AIL delivery 
route in accordance with the requirements of the various Highway 
Authorities along the route. 
3.3.2 
For the delivery of AIL, it will be the responsibility of the haulage company to 
contact and inform the following stakeholders to inform them of delivery 
dates and likely impact of delivery. 
Emergency Services 
3.3.3 
The Police, Fire and Ambulance service will be given written notice of the AIL 
deliveries. 
Highway Authorities 
3.3.4 
The Highway Authorities will be given written notice of the AIL deliveries. The 
relevant authorities will include the LHA (CCS) and SWTRA. 
3.3.5 
Authorities can be notified using the Highways England Electronic Service 
Delivery for Abnormal Loads (ESDAL) system. 
3.3.6 
Any request for an AIL movement must include an indemnity to ensure that 
the cost of repairing any damage to the highway causing by transporting the 
AIL can be recovered. 
Local Residents 
3.3.7 
Local residents affected by AIL deliveries will be notified prior to 
commencement of the deliveries. The method of communicating information 
will be agreed with the LHA (CCS), but could include the use of leaflet drops 
and information in the local media. The timing of the notification will be 
subject to the appointment of the AIL operator and handler who will be able 
to provide more information on the time and duration of the expected load 
delivery. Notification will be made in advance and as part of the consultation 
process and once the necessary agreements are obtained from the Highway 
Authorities detailed above. The communication should include the following 
information: 
 
Name and number of the Construction Site Manager; 
 
Commencement date for deliveries; 
Abergelli Power Project 
 
Abergelli Power Limited 
 
 
 
Prepared for:  Abergelli Power Limited   
 
AECOM 
15 
 
 
Duration of delivery period; 
 
Estimated time of deliveries; 
 
Request to keep the highway clear of parked cars during the delivery 
period; and 
 
Emergency number of Local Police and LHA Helpdesk. 
Local Business 
3.3.8 
Local businesses should be approached directly to ensure the effect on their 
businesses is minimised. This will be carried out in a similar timeframe and 
manner to that set out for local residents, detailed above. 
Local Services 
3.3.9 
The contractor and haulage company will make all reasonable efforts to work 
with local service providers to ensure disruption caused by deliveries is 
avoided. Services of particular relevance include but are not limited to: 
 
Royal Mail for postal delivery services and distribution vehicles; 
 
Local buses; 
 
Refuse collection; and 
 
Regular good deliveries. 
Planned Engineering Works 
3.3.10 The contractor and haulage company will work with CCS to identify any 
planned engineering works that could cause conflict with the proposed 
delivery route times. Discussions will then be made to minimise disruption to 
the local community and the planned engineering works. 
Local Community Events 
3.3.11 The contractor and haulage company will work with CCS to identify any 
conflicts with school and nursery drop off and pick up locations and times. 
Where possible, construction deliveries will be scheduled to avoid these 
busy periods. The chosen routes have also been selected ensuring that the 
journey of construction traffic is direct and contained, using higher 
classification of roads, wherever possible. 
3.3.12 Planned and notified community events will also be considered by the 
contractor and haulage company when scheduling deliveries. The 
Construction Site Manager will contact event organisers to ensure any 
issues are considered.

Highway Conditions Survey 
3.3.13 A highway condition survey of the public highway along the access route will 
be undertaken by the haulage company prior to the first AIL and following the 
final AIL. Any road maintenance issues directly caused by the AIL will be 
notified and approved through the normal process by CCS Highway 
Inspectors. 
3.4 
Construction Signage 
3.4.1 
Signage will be provided along the construction routes to direct construction 
traffic to/from the Project Site and to warn other road users construction 
traffic movements in key locations, e.g. the B4489/Access Road junction. 
The location and form of signage will be agreed with the LHA. Signage will 
also be provided within the Project Site to guide construction traffic in and 
out of the Laydown Area and the Generating Equipment Site, and to the 
construction parking bays. The location of the signage will be developed as 
the Project progresses and in discussion with the LHA and National Grid. 
3.5 
Monitoring of Construction Traffic 
3.5.1 
AIL and HGV deliveries to site will be monitored to check compliance with 
the proposed routeing strategy. The final measures will be agreed with the 
LHA and the contractor, as either the use of one or a number of measures 
could be utilised to achieve compliance. An example of a possible monitoring 
measure is a sticker system thereby all HGVs delivering to the Project Site 
would be required to display a sticker in the front window. This would allow 
HGVs to be visually assessed for compliance with the proposed routes. 
3.5.2 
The haulage companies may be able to offer more advanced compliance 
measures depending on the type of tracking/monitoring system they employ 
on their vehicles. 
3.6 
Construction Laydown Area 
3.6.1 
A temporary Laydown Area during construction will be provided for the 
storage of materials, plant and equipment as well as containing site 
accommodation and welfare facilities, temporary car parking and temporary 
fencing. The Laydown Area will be provided adjacent to the Generating 
Equipment Site. A small permanent area within the Laydown Area is required 
for maintenance during the operational phase of the Project. 
3.6.2 
Sufficient car parking will be provided within the Laydown Area. During 
operation car parking for operational and maintenance staff would be 
provided within the Generating Equipment Site. The Project will take into 
account CCS's policy on parking standards during the operational phase of 
the Project and implement sustainable transport methods through travel 
planning measures, where possible.

3.7 
Scheduling of Deliveries 
3.7.1 
A booking system will be used to log vehicles entering and leaving the 
Project Site. Where possible, deliveries will be spread across the day to 
minimise the impact of HGV traffic during the peak periods. 
3.7.2 
The transport of AILs will be timed to be undertaken at night or outside of the 
peak hours on the highway network to minimise disruption. These deliveries 
will be pre-arranged with local authorities and the police. 
3.8 
Cleansing of Vehicles Prior to Exiting the Site 
3.8.1 
All vehicles exiting the Project Site will be required to undertake effective 
vehicle cleaning and wheel-washing to minimise the amount of debris which 
is transferred to the Access Road and the local highway network. There will 
be specialised water tanks, hosing equipment, water collection and 
treatment tanks to undertake the cleaning process. The location of the wheel 
cleaning facility within the Project Site would be determined by the contractor 
in agreement with National Grid. 
3.9 
Highway Conditions Survey 
3.9.1 
A pre-construction condition survey, including road and verge condition at the 
junction of the Access Road and the B4489 and PROW (where directly 
affected) within the boundary of the Project Site would be undertaken prior to 
the commencement of the construction programme. 
3.9.2 
Three PROWs crossing the Project Site will be reinstated to their pre-
construction condition upon completion of works (where any damage is 
attributable to contractors working on behalf of APL) or permanently diverted 
as appropriate. These PROW will be stopped up or diverted temporarily 
during construction to ensure public safety. 
3.10 
PROW 
3.10.1 Footpaths LC34 and LC117 cross the Access Road (and the new section of 
Access Road) at points approximately 350 m and 1.3 km from the B4489. 
Footpath LC35B passes through the northern part of the Project Site. There 
will be further consultation to develop measures in respect of the PROW. 
Where possible, connectivity will be maintained by the use of temporary 
diversions and working methods to allow the PROWs to remain open for the 
majority of the construction period. Potential measures include fencing to 
ensure separation between movements along the PROW and construction 
activities (for PROW within the Project Site), and signage/management of 
movements where PROW cross construction traffic routes.

3.11 
Construction Staff Travel Plan 
3.11.1 Staff will be encouraged, where possible, to car share to the Project Site. It is 
recognised that using sustainable modes of transport may not be suitable 
due to working hours or the site location. However, car sharing would reduce 
the total number of trips to the Project Site. The Contractor will also be 
encouraged to lay on crew vehicles. 
3.12 
Measures relating to National Grid 
3.12.1 The measures set out in this plan largely relate to the public highway 
network. In this case the Access Road to the construction site will, in part, 
require use of the existing Access Road which is currently operated by 
National Grid. Therefore, there will be a number of measures which will 
relate to National Grid as a business and as a provider of utilities. The 
measures below have been developed following ongoing discussions with 
and input from National Grid representatives. 
 
Works planned by National Grid in relation to the Felindre Gas 
Compressor Station and the Substation will be taken into consideration 
when finalising the Project construction plan. At the time of this report it 
has been determined that any future works planned by National Grid 
would not occur within the Project’s construction period. Liaison will 
continue prior and during construction with appropriate management 
measures implemented if needed; 
 
National Grid operational staff at Felindre currently comprises four site-
based staff in attendance 0800 hours to 1600 hours. The site entrance 
gate is locked outside of these times. There are also instances where 
weekend work is required. The contractor appointed for the Project 
construction will manage the gate security if working outside of these 
hours and ensure the National Grid access is not obstructed; 
 
To assist with the above and also with the construction communication 
process, National Grid will be provided with a named APL contact, the 
construction site manager or an appropriate project manager. Either the 
nominated construction manager will ensure that key communication is 
continually fed to National Grid operatives and will be the point of contact 
for all queries; 
 
Height clearance for overhead cables has been discussed with National 
Grid and the project team will ensure that all available information is 
considered and that HGV loads are able to safely pass below the cable 
lines; 
 
The existing height restriction gate will be temporarily removed to 
accommodate the width of any AILs, and only for these loads, it will be 
fully reinstated immediately after this work. In the interim period a height 
safety bunting gateway will be erected to ensure height limits are in 
place; 
 
There are a number of cable burials beneath the existing Access Road. 
The location of these is the subject of discussion at the time of writing 
this document. Location plans will be provided by National Grid and the 
Abergelli Power Project 
 
Abergelli Power Limited

AECOM 
19 
 
APL construction team will record and manage these appropriately. 
Liaison will continue through the planning and pre-construction period to 
understand if further works are required to protect or reroute cables; 
 
National Grid will be kept informed of the planning for AILs with 
measures put into place to use the existing access outside of National 
Grid’s key required access times. 
 
A highway condition survey of the existing Access Road will be 
undertaken by the APL construction team and National Grid, recording 
the condition of the route prior to work commencement. Following 
completion of the construction period, a final inspection will be carried 
out and any defects which have occurred since the first inspection will be 
recorded; and 
 
A highway condition survey of the existing Access Road will be 
undertaken by the haulage company prior to the first AIL and following 
the final AIL as a separate measure and in conjunction with the wider 
highway inspection.

4. 
Traffic Generation and Impacts 
4.1.1 
The TA sets out the level of traffic generation of the Project and considered 
the impacts on the highway network. 
4.1.2 
The peak traffic during construction is expected to result in approximately 
270 car or van trips per day and around 130 HGV deliveries per day. This 
assumes a 22-month construction period, with the peak of HGV deliveries 
occurring during the first three months of the period and the peak of car and 
van trips occurring during months 13 to 15. The car or van trips would be 
limited to the start and end of the working day whilst HGV trips would be 
spread across the day. 
4.1.3 
Construction traffic generated by both staff and deliveries would arrive at the 
site from 08:00 and depart the site by 18:00 Mondays to Fridays. On 
Saturday and public holidays staff and deliveries would arrive at the site from 
08:00 and depart the site by 13:00. AILs will be transported outside peak 
hours.

Introduction
1.1
Overview
1.1.1
This Construction Staff Travel Plan (CSTP) has been prepared by AECOM
on behalf of Abergelli Power Limited (APL) in respect of the Abergelli Power
Project (hereafter referred to as 'the Project’).
1.1.2
This document supports the Environmental Statement (ES) which is
submitted as part of the DCO Application.
1.2
The Project
1.2.1
The Project is situated on open agricultural land located approximately 2 km
north of Junction 46 of the M4 within the administrative area of the City and
County of Swansea Council (CCS), approximately 1 km southeast of
Felindre and 1.4 km north of Llangyfelach.
1.2.2
The land upon which the Project would be developed, or which is required
for construction of the Project, is referred to as the 'Project Site'. The
approximate centre of the Project Site lies at grid reference 265284, 201431.
The Project Site covers an area of up to approximately 30 ha.
1.2.3
The current land use is predominantly agricultural, with sheep and horse
grazing. The western extent of the Project Site encompasses the existing
Access Road leading to the Substation and Felindre Gas Compressor
Station from the B4489.
1.2.4
A detailed description of the
Project and Project
components are
summarised in Chapter 3: Project and Site Description.
1.2.5
The core working hours during construction are between 08:00 and 18:00hrs
(Monday to Friday) and 08:00 to 13:00hrs (Saturdays and Bank Holidays).
For the assessment in the ES, it has been assumed that all construction staff
will arrive between 07:45 and 08:45hrs, and depart between 16:30 and
17:30hrs. Temporary parking spaces for staff will be made available within
the Laydown Area during construction.
1.2.6
The construction of the Power Generation Plant is estimated to take 22
months. The new section of Access Road will be constructed as part of the
Power Generation Plant and is expected to take around six months. The
construction of the Gas Connection and Electrical Connection is expected to
take place alongside and within the period of construction of the Power
Generation Plant.

Purpose and Scope of Construction Staff Travel Plan
1.3.1
Travel Plans (TPs) are a way of promoting sustainable travel behaviour
through a range of mechanisms, initiatives and targets that when combined
can help to reduce unnecessary travel and encourage journeys to be
undertaken in a more environmentally sustainable way. For new
developments, it is important that sustainable travel measures are in place
prior to occupation of a new development as travel habits in favour of
walking, cycling and public transport are more readily established from the
outset.
1.3.2
Benefits of implementing a TP can include:
·
Increased travel choice: TPs can increase personal travel choice by
promoting existing and providing additional sustainable travel options;
·
Health benefits: Many alternative forms of travel involve an element of
physical activity that can help improve the physical health and mental
wellbeing of users of a development. For employers, this can also
reduce the number of days lost to staff illness;
·
Public/environmental responsibility: A decrease in the number of vehicle
trips results in cleaner air and eases congestion both in the development
and on the local highway network;
·
Positive publicity: TPs can generate positive publicity and improve the
environmental image of an organisation, an area or a development. It
demonstrates to residents living in the surrounding areas that the
organisation is committed to limiting single occupancy car trips and
promoting sustainable travel options; and
·
Financial savings: Users of a development can make savings by
switching to or encouraging travel by non-car modes. For staff employed
on a site, this is primarily related to reduced fuel consumption and
vehicle depreciation.
1.3.3
It is recognised that construction staff will exhibit travel behaviours and have
certain requirements that differ from staff that would be traditionally targeted
by a workplace TP. Factors can include:
·
Requirement to carry and transfer of specialist equipment, tools and
personal protective equipment;
·
Start and finish times that are generally outside of periods when public
transport is available or in periods when services are not as frequent;
·
Requirement to undertake physically demanding tasks during the
working day which makes the use of active modes such as
walking/cycling for commuting purposes less attractive;
·
Working on sites that are in remote locations where provision for non-car
modes is limited; and
·
Variation in the workforce due to the construction schedule, making the
establishment of standard travel routines more difficult.

1.3.4
These factors have been taken into consideration in identifying measures in
this CSTP.
1.4
Policy and Guidance
1.4.1
This CSTP has been prepared with reference to Technical Advice Note
(TAN) 18: Transport, published by the Welsh Government (WG). TAN 18 sets
out technical guidance for the transport related elements of development and
also confirms
the WG’s commitment to sustainable travel via the
implementation of TPs for new developments.
1.4.2
TAN 18 states that the WG “wishes to promote the widespread adoption of
travel plans by businesses, schools, hospitals, tourist attractions and other
significant travel-generating uses”. It is also acknowledged that “travel plans
may be prepared, individually or jointly, by the owners and operators of
existing or proposed developments”.
1.5
Report Structure
1.5.1
The TP is structured as follows:
·
Section 2 – Existing Conditions and Site Accessibility: Sets out the local
transport conditions in the vicinity of the site and access to non-car
modes of transport
·
Section 3 – Trip Generation: Provides details of the trip generation of
staff associated with each of the Project components; and
·
Section 4 – Travel Plan Measures: Sets out the key measures and
initiatives relating to the reduction in single-occupancy car trips to/from
the site.
2.
Existing Conditions and Site Accessibility
2.1
Local Highway Network
2.1.1
The Project Site is served by a privately maintained Access Road from the
B4489. The Access Road is unlit. The width of the Access Road varies along
its length between 3.5 m and 7.5 m, and is generally bordered by trees and
intermittent hedgerows. The Access Road connects to the B4489 via a
simple priority junction. This is characterised by large radii on the minor arm
(the Access Road) to accommodate HGV movements.
Abergelli Power Project

2.1.2
The B4489 routes between the village of Felindre to the north (approximately
2.3 km from the Access Road) and the M4 Junction 46 to the south
(approximately 1.8 km from the Access Road). The B4489 is subject to a 40
mph speed limit at its junction with the Access Road. At this location, the
road has a 5.5 m wide carriageway and is unlit. Approximately 330 m to the
north of the Access Road, the B4489 becomes subject to the national speed
limit. The B4489 continues a further 1.7 km north where it connects to Rhyd-
y-Pandy Road at a priority junction. This section of the B4489 is unlit and
ranges in width between 4.5 m and 5.5 m, with numerous passing places.
2.1.3
The junction with Rhyd-y-Pandy Road and its approaches are subject to a 30
mph speed limit. Rhyd-y-Pandy Road routes east for 1.6 km where it passes
the northern extent of the Project Boundary. This section of Rhyd-y-Pandy
Road is unlit and ranges in width between 4.5 m and 5.5 m, with numerous
passing places. It is subject to a 30 mph speed limit, increasing to the
national speed limit around 900 m east of its junction with the B4489. It also
serves the Felindre Water Treatment Works.
2.1.4
Approximately 475 m to the south of the Access Road, the B4489 is street lit.
A further 75 m south from this point, the B4489 forms a three-arm
roundabout with the access to the Felindre Park and Share.
2.1.5
On an average weekday, the B4489 carries approximately 130 vehicles
during the AM peak hour, 90 vehicles during the PM peak hour, and 1,000
vehicles over the 24-hour period. HGVs account for no more than 2% of total
traffic.
2.1.6
The B4489 forms a dumbbell roundabout with the M4 Junction 46. The
northern dumbbell roundabout junction comprises three arms; the B4489
and the eastbound on/off-slips of the M4. The southern dumbbell roundabout
junction comprises six arms; the A48 (three arms), the B4489 Swansea
Road, and the westbound on/off-slips of the M4. The south-eastern arm of
the A48 forms a mini-roundabout junction with Pant Lasau Road
approximately 90 m southeast of the southern dumbbell roundabout. These
junctions are subject to a 40 mph speed limit and are lit.
2.1.7
The walking and cycling facilities and Public Rights of Way (PROW) are
shown on Figure 2.1.
2.1.8
There are no footways that serve the Project Site. The nearest footways are
on the B4489, approximately 475 m south of the Access Road (on the
approach to the junction with the Felindre Park and Share). This footway
continues to the M4 Junction 46. The 500 m section of the footway to the
north of the M4 Junction 46 is separated from the carriageway edge by a
barrier. At the M4 Junction 46 the footways continues south along the east
side of the carriageway, serving the southern arms of the southern dumbbell
roundabout, with dropped kerbs and tactile paving to facilitate crossing
movements across entry arms.

2.1.9
There are no formal cycling routes in the vicinity of the Project Site. Part of
the B4489 is identified as an ‘advisory cycling route’ on the CCS’s cycle
map. This covers the section of the B4489 that routes north from the Access
Road to Felindre and to a point approximately 475 m south of the Access
Road.
2.1.10 There are numerous PRoW crossing/in the vicinity of the Project Site.
Footpaths LC34 and LC117 cross the Access Road (and the new section of
Access Road) at points approximately 350 m and 1.3 km from the B4489.
Footpath LC35B passes through the northern part of the Project Site,
connecting to Rhyd-y-Pandy Road in the vicinity of the AGI Access.
2.2
Public Transport
2.2.1
The nearest bus stop to the Project Site is the 'Lliw Reservoirs' stop located
on Rhyd-y-Pandy Road. This is situated to the east of Felindre and
approximately 500 m to the northwest of the northern extent of the Project
Site boundary. There is no footway between the Project Site and this bus
stop. It provides access to Service 142, which routes between Morriston and
Garnswllt. This service is operated by DANSA, a community transport
organisation. There are three to four services per day in each direction,
although these can generally only be pre-booked.
2.2.2
Service 141 passes to the south of the Project Site, routeing between
Gorseinon and Morriston. The nearest stop that provides access to this
service is the 'Pant Lasau Cross' stop located on Mynydd Gelli Wastad
Road. It is situated approximately 750 m to the southeast of the southern
extent of the Project Site boundary and can be accessed via Footpath
LC117.
2.2.3
There are no railway stations in the vicinity of the Project Site. Llansamlet
railway station is situated approximately 5.5 km southeast of the Project Site,
accessible by car via the A48 (from M4 Junction 44 and 46). Swansea
railway station is a further 7 km from the Project Site; this is a key local
transport hub and is more easily accessible by public transport. Swansea
railway station is managed by Arriva Trains Wales. There are four services
daily from Swansea to Shrewsbury; an hourly service from Swansea to
Manchester Piccadilly, which calls at Cardiff Central; and a total of two to
three services hourly from Swansea to Cardiff Central. Great Western
Railway also provides services from Swansea to London Paddington, calling
at Bristol Parkway.
2.2.4
Overall, the opportunities to access the Project Site by public transport are
limited, and it is therefore considered that, for the purposes of this
assessment, no trips by construction staff will be undertaken by these
modes.

2.3
Parking
2.3.1
Felindre Park and Share is accessed from the B4489, approximately 550 m
south of the Access Road. It is located on the site of the proposed Felindre
Business Park. It has capacity for 480 spaces and its use is encouraged for
employees of the DVLA HQ in Clase. A shuttle bus service runs between the
Felindre Park and Share and the DVLA. The Felindre Park and Share is
understood to be managed by the DVLA and will not be available for use by
the Project.
2.3.2
A layby is located adjacent to the northbound carriageway of the B4489,
approximately 800 m from the M4 Junction 46, and 950 m from the Access
Road. The layby measures approximately 50 m in length.

3.
Trip Generation
3.1.1
The traffic generated by staff associated with the Project during the
construction period has been quantified using a first principles approach.
This assumes that all construction staff will arrive at and depart the Project
Site in private cars or vans at average vehicle occupancy of 1.6. Due to the
limitations of public transport provision, no staff are expected to arrive or
depart by public transport.
3.1.2
The forecast vehicle trip generation associated with staff is set out for the
individual Project components and full Project in Table 3.1.

Travel Plan Measures
4.1
Aims and Objectives
4.1.1
The principal aim of this CSTP is to reduce the impact associated with the
vehicle trip generation of the Project during the construction phases. In view
of the development type, location and limited potential for non-car modes, it
is considered appropriate and realistic for efforts to be focused on increasing
occupancy levels of vehicles travelling to/from the site.
4.2
Travel Plan Implementation and Monitoring
4.2.1
The construction of the Project will be carried out by a contractor who will be
responsible for complying with the selected measures described in the
CSTP. The contractor will also be responsible for ensuring that all sub-
contractors are both aware of, and comply with, the requirements of the
CSTP.
4.2.2
A member of staff, typically the Site Manager, will be identified to perform the
role of Travel Plan Coordinator (TPC). The TPC will be responsible for the
management and delivery of the CSTP for the duration of the construction
phase, working with senior site management and stakeholders.
4.2.3
The TPC will be required to monitor travel on a regular basis (e.g. every six
months) throughout the construction period. This will involve car occupancy
surveys at the accesses to the Project Site.
4.3
Car Sharing
4.3.1
The key measure to increase the occupancy levels of vehicles will be to
increase car sharing. This will be achieved through the establishment of a
staff car sharing database, which will contain the home postcodes of staff
and details of their shift patterns so that staff can be ’matched’. This could be
a bespoke database or could make use of online resources such as ‘Share
Cymru’.
4.3.2
Where practically possible, the contractor will lay on crew transport such as
minibuses, between their place of business and the Project Site.
4.4
Marketing and Communication
4.4.1
This CSTP is exclusively focused on car sharing and all staff will be provided
with:
·
Details of and access to the car sharing database. As staff will work shift
patterns, these timings will be reviewed to see where the optimum
opportunities for car sharing can be achieved;
·
Car sharing/site routeing policies;
Abergelli Power Project
Abergelli Power Limited
Prepared for: Abergelli Power Limited
AECOM

·
Information on local traffic-related congestion concerns for the purposes
of raising awareness; and
·
A map showing the location of the Project in relation to the local area,
highlighting the designated routes to use to access the Project Site to
reduce congestion/conflict.
4.4.2
Sustained and specific marketing of car sharing will be undertaken during
the construction phase to ensure staff are aware of and understand the
CSTP. This will include the provision of information to staff during the
induction process, and regular communication through staff briefings and the
staff notice board. As part of the induction process, all construction staff will
be required to register on a car sharing database and encouraged to
participate in car sharing to site with other staff members.

Introduction
2.1
Introduction
2.1.1
AECOM was instructed by Abergelli Power Limited (APL) to carry out a Preliminary
Ecological Appraisal (PEA) of the Abergelli site, hereafter referred to as ‘the Project
Site’. The central grid reference for the Project Site is SN 6528 0143 and the
boundary of the Project Site is shown on Figure 1.
2.1.2
This PEA was commissioned to identify whether there are known or potential
ecological receptors (nature conservation designations, and protected and notable
habitats and species) that may constrain or influence the design and
implementation of the Project. The approach applied when undertaking this PEA
pays due regard to the Guidelines for Preliminary Ecological Appraisal published by
the Chartered Institute of Ecology and Environmental Management (Ref. 3). The
PEA addresses relevant wildlife legislation and planning policy as summarised in
Section 2 of this report.
2.1.3
In order to deliver the PEA, a desk study and an extended Phase 1 Habitat Survey
were undertaken by an appropriately experienced ecologist, to identify ecological
features within the Project Site and the wider potential zone of influence of the
Project. The potential zone of influence was defined with reference to the project
description provided by APL as shown as the habitats surveyed on Figure 1.
Additional details are provided in Section 3: Methodology.
2.2
Proposed Development
2.2.1
The Project Site is located near to the village of Felindre, Swansea, as shown in
Figure 1.1 of the ES, and the central grid reference for the Project Site is
SN65280143. The Project Site is approximately 30.66 ha. A full description of the
development is provided in Chapter 3: Project and Site Description) of the ES.
2.2.2
The development will require the removal of hedgerows, semi-natural broadleaved
woodland, rows of trees, scrub, running water, ponds, hardstanding, marshy
grassland, semi-improved grassland, improved grassland, and trees with potential
for roosting bats.
2.2.3
It is understood that construction is programmed to commence no sooner than
2020/2021.
2.3
Objectives
2.3.1
The objectives of the PEA were:
·
Identify designated nature conservation sites on or within proximity to the
Project Site;
·
Identify known records of protected or notable species within proximity to the
Project Site;
Abergelli ES 2018 – PRELIMINARY ECOLOGICAL APPRAISAL (NON-CONFIDENTIAL)

·
Identify and categorise the main habitats and features of ecological interest
present within the Project Site ;
·
Appraise the potential for protected or notable species of fauna and flora;
·
Provide advice on potential ecological constraints and opportunities on or within
proximity to the Project Site;
·
Identify the requirement for further habitat and species surveys;
·
Make recommendations for requirements to avoid and mitigate ecological
impacts as well as opportunities for biodiversity enhancements; and,
·
Provide a map showing the Phase 1 habitats on the Project Site and features of
ecological interest.
2.3.2
The purpose of this report is to support the submission of a Development Consent
Order (DCO) application. The report identifies the scope of further work (where
necessary) that would be required to support a DCO application. High level
recommendations are made on potential options for the avoidance, mitigation or
compensation of the potential impacts of the Project (where known) on the
identified ecological receptors, and of potential enhancements to the biodiversity
and ecosystem services. A full assessment of potential effects and mitigation will be
made during the Ecological Impact Assessment (EcIA).
2.4
Wildlife Legislation and Planning Policy
Wildlife Legislation
2.4.1
There are several different acts of legislation and regulations which refer to the
protection of wildlife. These are summarised in Appendix A. In particular, the
legislation relating to possible protected species on the Project Site is outlined. This
is a brief summary of the legislation and is not to be regarded as a definitive legal
opinion. When dealing with individual cases, the client is advised to consult the full
texts of the relevant legislation and obtain further legal advice.
2.4.2
The following wildlife legislation is potentially relevant to the Project:
·
The Wildlife and Countryside Act (WCA) 1981 (as amended);
·
The Countryside and Rights of Way (CRoW) Act 2000;
·
The Conservation of Habitats & Species Regulations 2010 (as amended);
·
Environment (Wales) Act 2016;
·
The Hedgerow Regulations 1997; and,
·
The Protection of Badgers Act 1992.
2.4.3
The above legislation has been considered when planning and undertaking this
PEA using the methods described in Section 3, when identifying potential
constraints to the Project, and when making recommendations for further survey,
design options and mitigation, as discussed in Section 5. Compliance with
legislation may require the attainment of relevant protected species licences prior to
the implementation of the Project.

National Planning Policy
Planning Policy Wales (8th Ed. January 2016)
2.4.4
Planning Policy Wales (PPW) sets out the land use planning policies of Welsh
Government. It provides the policy framework for the preparation of Local
Development Plans. Chapter 5, Conserving and Improving the Natural Heritage
and Coast, outlines Welsh Government’s objectives for the conservation and
improvement of natural heritage.
Technical Advice Note 5 (TAN5) Nature Conservation and Planning (2009)
2.4.5
The Planning Policy Wales (PPW) is supplemented by a series of Technical Advice
Notes. TAN 5 provides guidance on how the land use planning system should
contribute to protecting and enhancing biodiversity and geological conservation.  It
provides advice on areas including the key principles of positive planning for nature
conservation, nature conservation in Local Development Plans and development
management procedures. It also provides advice on development affecting
designated sites and habitats, in addition to protected or priority habitats and
species.
2.4.6
Key Principles include that the town and country planning system in Wales should
integrate nature conservation into all planning decisions; that the town and country
planning system should look for development to provide a net benefit for
biodiversity conservation with no significant loss of habitats or populations of
species, locally or nationally and that they should ensure that the UK’s international
and national obligations for site, species and habitat protection are fully met in all
planning decisions.
Local Planning Policy
2.4.7
Local Development Plans (LDPs) must be produced by every Local Planning
Authority in Wales. Any development proposal will be tested against the policies
within the LDP. The LDPs follow the planning guidance provide in PPW, including
biodiversity and natural heritage policies. These include protecting designated sites
and other areas of importance for biodiversity conservation; safeguarding protected
species and priority species, including those listed in local biodiversity action plans
and retaining, creating and enhancing features of importance for biodiversity
conservation where appropriate.
2.4.8
Relevant local planning policies for City and County of Swansea (CCS) are detailed
in the adopted City and County of Swansea Unitary Development Plan.
2.4.9
CCS has also submitted the Swansea Local Development Plan 2010 – 2025 to the
Secretary of State for Examination in public. This is an emerging development plan,
and is not part of the statutory development plan. However, its policies are a
material consideration. :

2.4.10 Appendix A provides a summary of relevant local planning policies. For the precise
wording of each specific policy please refer back to the source document. This
planning policy has been considered when assessing potential ecological
constraints and opportunities identified by the desk study and field surveys; and,
when assessing requirements for further survey, design options and ecological
mitigation, as described in Section 6.
2.5
Quality Assurance
2.5.1
This survey and subsequent report was undertaken in line with AECOM’s
Integrated Management System (IMS). Our IMS places great emphasis on
professionalism, technical excellence, quality, environmental and Health and Safety
management. All staff members are committed to establishing and maintaining our
certification to the international standards BS EN ISO 9001:2008 and 14001:2004
and BS OHSAS 18001:2007. In addition our IMS requires careful selection and
monitoring of the performance of all sub consultants and contractors.
2.5.2
All AECOM Ecologists who worked on this project are members of (at the
appropriate level) the Chartered Institute of Ecology and Environmental
Management (CIEEM) and follow their code of professional conduct (Ref. 4) when
undertaking ecological work.
3.
Methodology
3.1
Desk Study
3.1.1
The objectives of the desk study are to review the existing information available in
the public domain concerning species and habitats to identify the following:
·
Internationally, nationally and locally designated sites, up to 2 km from the
Project Site using the Multi Agency Geographic Information for the Countryside
(MAGIC) website (www.magic.gov.uk);
·
Protected and Priority species records and records of locally designated sites
up to 2 km from the Project Site, using the South East Wales Biodiversity
Records Centre (SEWBReC);
·
Special Areas of Conservation (SACs) and Sites of Special Scientific Interest
(SSSIs) designated for bats within a 10 km radius of the Site in accordance
with Bat Conservation Trust (Collins, 2016) recommendations;
·
Section 7 list of Species and Habitats of Principal Importance for Conservation
of Biological Diversity in Wales;
·
Ancient Semi-Natural Woodland (ASNW), Plantation on Ancient Woodland Site
(PAWS), Restored Ancient Woodland Site (RAWS) or Ancient Woodland Site
of Unknown category (AWSU) within or adjacent to the Project Site boundary
using LLE dataset (http://lle.gov.wales/home);
·
Tree Protection Orders (TPO’s) from Swansea Council; and,
·
Aerial photographs and Ordnance Survey (OS) maps were reviewed to identify
features of ecological interest surrounding the Project Site including ponds
within 500 m, nearby areas of ecological interest and features connecting these
habitats (hedgerows, watercourses, railway lines).

3.1.2
The reports of previous surveys undertaken by BSG Ecology and WSP/Parsons
Brinckerhoff (WSP/PB) were provided by the client and were reviewed (Ref. 5).
3.2
Extended Phase 1 Habitat Survey
3.2.1
A Phase 1 Habitat Survey (Ref. 6) of the Project Site was undertaken by two
suitably experienced ecologists of AECOM on the 18th and 19th May 2017.
3.2.2
The survey involved a site walkover and preliminary assessment of key habitats,
land use and ecological features. The main habitats present were recorded using
standard Phase 1 Habitat Survey methodology as described in the Handbook for
Phase 1 Habitat Survey: A technique for Environmental Audit (JNCC, 2010). The
plant species defining the habitat types on the Project Site were recorded.
Evidence of any invasive plant species subject to legal controls was recorded. The
Project Site was assessed for its potential to support protected or notable species
in order to identify potential ecological constraints and to guide recommendations
for further surveys.
3.3
Assessment of Bat Potential
3.3.1
During the Phase 1 Habitat Survey, where access allowed, trees and buildings
throughout the Project Site were classified into categories dependent on the
presence of features suitable as bat roost habitat.
3.3.2
Due to the size of the Project Site and the number of trees present within the
Project Site boundary, it was not possible to make an assessment of every tree.
However a number of trees were assessed during the Phase 1 Habitat Survey and
the details of these are provided in Table 3-1 below. Trees within area of woodland
present within or close to the Project Site boundary were not individually assessed
but the woodlands were given an overall rating, based on species composition and
age, of their likelihood to support roosting bats and/or the need for further
assessment.
3.3.3
The assessment was conducted via an external appraisal from the ground using
binoculars where necessary. Table 3-1 provides descriptions of the categories for
buildings and trees.
3.3.4
Habitats on-site were classified into categories dependent on the presence of
features suitable for bats to commute and forage. Table 3-2 provides descriptions
for commuting and foraging habitats.

Limitations
3.4.1
Biological records can be received from a wide variety of sources and may or may
not be comprehensive and accurate. However, if assessed in conjunction with a
Phase 1 Habitat survey, they can contribute to a robust ecological assessment of a
site.
3.4.2
Due to the size of the Project Site, it was not possible to assess every tree or
building for its potential to support bats.
3.4.3
Some areas adjacent to but outside of the Project Site boundary were not
accessible at the time of survey and as such these habitats were surveyed from the
road at a distance.
3.4.4
Some areas within the Project Site boundary were not accessible due to the
presence of horses; these habitats were surveyed at a distance.
3.4.5
There is potential for trees and/or buildings with the potential to support roosting
bats to have gone unrecorded due to time and access restrictions. It is possible that
some species, including invasive non-native plant species may not have been
recorded due to access limitations.

Previous Surveys
The client provided AECOM with the reports of previous surveys
undertaken by BSG Ecology and WSP/PB within the Site (Ref. 5, and
Appendices 8.3 and 8.8 of the ES). It was noted that the current red
line boundary of the Site is now smaller than the red line boundary
used by BSG Ecology and WSP/PB. However, the current red line
boundary is within the same area as the previous red line boundary
provided to BSG Ecology and WSP/PB and therefore the surveys
undertaken would have captured the current Project Site boundary.
A summary of the previous protected and priority species surveys are
detailed below:

Subsequent targeted surveys for marsh fritillary

July to October and may have gone unrecorded. It
stated that there may still be suitable areas within
the Project Site in which devil’s bit scabious may
be found (Ref. 5).
Devil’s bit scabious typically grows in damp
meadows and marshes and along woodland rides
and riverbanks.
Areas of semi-improved neutral grassland and
marshy grassland are present within the Project
Site. Therefore there is the potential for devil’s bit
scabious to be present, however it is considered
that even if this plant is now present within the
Project Site it is unlikely to be in any great number
and therefore it is considered unlikely that marsh
fritillary butterfly will be present.

the trees within area of woodland are of a suitable
age and size to support bat roost potential
features.
Four buildings (outside of the Project Site

Ecological Constraints and Indicative Potential Impacts
5.1.1
The constraints and potential impacts listed here do not include consideration of
further surveys which have been recommended in Section 6. The results of further
surveys may change the likely potential impacts.
5.1.2
The indicative potential impacts of the Project on habitats and protected species
are outlined below; potential impacts will be assessed fully during the Ecological
Impact Assessment (EcIA).
5.1.3
The development proposals are for proposed 299 MW Open Cycle Gas Turbine
power station. The development will require the removal of vegetated habitats
including hedgerows, semi-natural broadleaved woodland, rows of trees, scrub,
hardstanding, marshy grassland, improved grassland, and trees.
5.2
Indicative Potential Impacts
5.2.1
Without mitigation, during construction and operation the following indicative
potential impacts are anticipated:
·
Habitat loss, severance and fragmentation;
·
Loss and/or disturbance of breeding and resting sites of protected species;
·
Disturbance, injury or killing of protected and priority species during site
clearance and construction works;
·
Disturbance, injury or killing of protected and priority species during operation
where protected species are retained within the Project Site;
·
Disturbance from noise and vibration (if piling is required);
·
Pollution to land and/or water as a result of run off of sediments, chemicals, fuel
or oil;
·
Degradation of habitats and designated site habitats due to increases in
nutrients from operational emissions;
·
Spread of invasive species; and,
·
External lighting disturbance.

Further Surveys and Recommendations
6.1
Further Surveys
6.1.1
Further surveys for protected species are recommended so that the baseline data
can be used to inform the EcIA. Surveys will be programmed and completed with
sufficient time ahead of DCO application submission and the results can be used to
inform the Project design. Certain species can only be surveyed for at certain times
of year and without consideration this has potential to cause project delays.
6.1.2
Recommendations for further surveys are based on the current information
available and will be subject to consultation with relevant consultees and local
authority officers. Further surveys are recommended for the following species:
a) Hedgerows
6.1.3
Hedgerows proposed to be removed as part of the development should be
assessed by a suitably qualified ecologist to determine if they are classified as an
Important hedgerow under the Hedgerow Regulations, 1997 (Ref. 1). The optimal
times for hedgerow surveys are April – early-June, whilst the woodland ground flora
is still present.
b) Tree Preservation Orders
6.1.4
No TPOs are to be removed as part of the Project. However the TPOs may be
impacted by the works. TPO trees that may be impacted by the Project should be
identified and the appropriate Root Protection Zones should be set up during
construction.
c) Invertebrates
6.1.5
As the habitats on the Project Site have not changed significantly since the
invertebrate survey conducted in 2014 it is recommended that the consultation is
undertaken with Natural Resources Wales (NRW) and the local planning authority
to discuss the requirement for additional invertebrate surveys.
6.1.6
Should an update to the 2014 survey data be required by the NRW and the local
planning 
authority 
it 
should 
be 
undertaken 
by 
a 
suitably 
qualified
ecologist/entomologist to determine if the habitats proposed to be removed as part
of the development support any protected and/or priority invertebrate species,
including the marsh fritillary butterfly.
d) Great Crested Newts
6.1.7
It is recommended that surveys for great crested newts are undertaken on suitable
ponds within the Project Site boundary, and within 500 m of the Project Site
boundary to determine if they are present in the area.
Abergelli ES 2018 – PRELIMINARY ECOLOGICAL APPRAISAL (NON-CONFIDENTIAL)
Prepared for: Abergelli Power Limited
AECOM
37
e) Reptiles
6.1.8
It is recommended that
presence/absence
surveys for reptiles should be
undertaken in areas of suitable habitat using artificial refugia.
6.1.9
Grass snake and common lizard have previously been identified on Project Site
(see Table 4-1).
f)
Breeding Birds
6.1.10 It is recommended that breeding bird surveys should be undertaken within suitable
areas of habitat within the Site to assess presence, population and activity of birds.
Particular focus will be paid to protected and/or priority species breeding in areas of
suitable habitat and will include ground nesting birds, in particular lapwing, in areas
of marshy and semi-improved grassland.
g) Bats
6.1.11 The Bat Survey Guidelines (Ref. 2) requires surveys to consider potential roosts
(trees, buildings and structures) within the Zone of Influence (ZoI) of a project. For
the Generating Equipment Site in consideration of construction noise and vibration,
and operational lighting to COMAH regulations the ZoI has been set to a 50m
radius from the Project Site boundary, and for the rest of the Site set to potential
roosts within and adjacent to the Project Site boundary.
Tree Assessments
6.1.12 If broadleaved semi-natural woodland, rows of trees and /or individual trees within
the ZoI and Project Site are to be removed or illuminated by external lighting a
preliminary ground level roost assessment should be undertaken on all trees within
the area which will be affected.
Building and Structure Assessments
6.1.13 Buildings and/or structures within the vicinity of the Project Site should be assessed
for their potential to support summer roosting and winter hibernating bats.
Bat Roost Survey
Trees
6.1.14 Any trees to be removed or disturbed (disturbance can include lighting, crown
lifting, limb removal, noise and vibration) which have been assessed as having low
potential to support roosting bats will not be subject to further surveys, but
precautionary measures may be appropriate during felling or pruning activities.
6.1.15 Any trees to be removed or disturbed which have been assessed as having
moderate or high potential to support roosting bats may require a further Potential

6.1.16 To establish roost presence or likely absence up to three manual surveys
(dusk/dawn) are to be completed following the Bat Survey Guidelines (Collins,
2016). The climbed inspection can count towards one of the three manual surveys.
Buildings and Structures
6.1.17 Any buildings or structures assessed as having potential to support roosting bats
may require an internal inspection, winter hibernations survey, and/or will require
presence/absence surveys to be undertaken if they are to be disturbed as part of
the Project (disturbance can include lighting, renovation works, noise and
vibration).
6.1.18 To establish roost presence or likely absence up to three manual surveys
(dusk/dawn) are to be completed following the Bat Survey Guidelines (Ref. 2).
6.1.19 At least three surveys are needed to support a European Protected Species
License application if a roost is to be destroyed or disturbed.
Activity Survey
6.1.20 To ascertain the presence and/or level of bat activity on the Project Site, activity
surveys (including walked transects and automated/static activity surveys) are
recommended to be completed following the Bat Survey Guidelines (Ref. 2).
Transect Surveys
6.1.21 This comprises two site visits a month, for each month between April and October
inclusive for walked transects. Transects will incorporate all areas of suitable
habitat. Particular focus will be on commuting bats using the hedgerows and tree
lines. The transect route will depend on suitable and safe access. Due to the size of
the Project Site it is anticipated that the Project Site will be covered by two walked
transect routes.
Automated/Static Activity Surveys
6.1.22 This comprises three remote detector locations per transect with data to be
collected on five consecutive nights per month, for each month between April and
October inclusive.  The devices will be placed out and retrieved after each session.
Recordings are then analysed in the office.
h) Hazel Dormouse
6.1.23 Suitable habitat for supporting dormice was recorded within woodland, hedgerows
and dense scrub. No records of dormice were returned from the local records
centre. Surveys for dormice were undertaken by BSG Ecology in 2014 (Appendix
8.8 of the ES) and no evidence of dormice was found.
Abergelli ES 2018 – PRELIMINARY ECOLOGICAL APPRAISAL (NON-CONFIDENTIAL)
Prepared for: Abergelli Power Limited
AECOM
39
6.1.24 The habitats on-site with the potential to support dormice are not considered to
have changed since 2014, Therefore AECOM consider that no further surveys for
dormice are necessary. However, a consultation with NRW and the local planning
authority will be required to determine if this approach is appropriate. There may be
a requirement to undertake further surveys for dormice in areas of suitable habitat
on-site.
6.1.25 Should a dormouse survey need to be completed to ascertain presence or likely
absence at the Project Site, the survey will follow the guidelines set out in the
Dormouse Conservation Handbook Second Edition (Ref. 10).
6.1.26 Nest tubes will be positioned within areas of scrub woodland and along hedgerows
suitable to support dormouse. The tubes will be checked monthly using a surveyor
possessing a NRW dormouse handling licence for the presence of dormice and
also for signs of recently constructed dormouse nests.
6.1.27 Based on survey methodologies provided in Ref. 10, it is recommended that
surveys commence in May and are undertaken on a monthly basis until September.
As shown in Table 6-1 below, each survey month is given an Index of Probability
based on the likelihood of dormouse being present and active in each month. A
minimum score of 20 is required to assume absence from the Site.

6.1.28 If dormice are confirmed present within the woodland on site then an application for
a European Protected Species License (EPSL) will need to be made from NRW to
allow works to be undertaken that would otherwise be in breach of legislation. The
EPSL will contain a Method Statement describing how the works will proceed (likely
to include timing of works, working methods and hand searching by a licensed
ecologist) and mitigation measures. If an EPSL is required then the survey must
include a survey in May to inform a population size class assessment, due to the
timing of this PEA this would need to be undertaken in May 2018.
i)
Badger
6.1.29 Badger setts have previously been identified on Project Site (see Table 4-1).
Badger setts were identified and the sensitive information is contained within a
confidential version of this report. A badger survey should be undertaken in areas of
suitable habitat above the water table within and up to 50 m from the Project Site
boundary for badger setts and signs.
6.1.30 Badger tunnels can extend up to 30 m from the entrance holes and are located
between 0.2 m and several metres below the surface, depending on the soil and
topography. Any works, in particular heavy machinery and ground breaking works,
that takes place within 30 m of an active badger sett has the potential to cause a
collapse of a sett and disturb, harm or kill a badger. Light work, such as hand
digging has the potential to cause disturbance within 10 m of a sett.
6.1.31 Works likely to damage or destroy a badger sett will require a license to close the
sett prior to works commencing.
6.1.32 Further surveys and a pre-works check for newly created badger setts may be
required.
j)
Otter and Water Vole
6.1.33 An otter and water vole survey should be undertaken along watercourses and
ditches at least 100 m from the Project Site boundary (where access allows) to
ascertain presence and distribution.
k) Invasive Non-Native Plant Species
6.1.34 Invasive non-native plant species were identified during the Phase 1 Habitat
Survey. A survey for invasive non-native species should be undertaken in areas
that could not be accessed during the Phase 1 Habitat Survey.

6.2
Recommendations for Further Work
a) Habitat Regulations Assessment – Screening
6.2.1
A search should be undertaken for any Natura 2000 sites situated within the 10 km
study area. A Habitat Regulations Assessment (HRA) screening assessment should
be undertaken to ascertain if the development proposals would have a Likely
Significant Effects (LSE) on any Natura 2000 sites alone or in-combination with
other projects, and therefore identifying whether an Appropriate Assessment (AA) is
required. Consultation with NRW is recommended at early stages to discuss the
proposals and suitable mitigation measures should these be required.
6.2.2
A HRA screening assessment was undertaken in 2015 by Parsons Brinckerhoff and
concluded no LSE. It is recommended that the report is reviewed and, if deemed
appropriate, consultation undertaken with NRW to ascertain whether the report can
be used to support the DCO application. However, a new in-combination
assessment will be required as there is a likelihood that new projects have been
planned or built since the 2015 report was written.
6.3
Recommendations for Consultation
6.3.1
Development plans are likely to require the removal of SINC habitats and TPO
trees, and may impact upon a number of protected and/or priority species, and
designated sites. The following is a list of bodies that should be consulted:
·
CCS Ecologist;
·
CCS Officer;
·
Natural Resources Wales; and,
·
Local wildlife groups.

6.4
Recommendations for Mitigation and Enhancement
6.4.1
A detailed list of recommendations has not been completed. Further
recommendations will be made as a result of the further surveys and as part of the
EcIA.
6.4.2
The mitigation hierarchy should be considered and implemented when designing a
new development.
a) Mitigation Hierarchy
1. Enhance positive impacts and opportunities;
2. Avoidance – Alternative site or technology, or timing to eliminate impact;
3. Minimise – Actions during design construction and operation to minimise or
eliminate impacts; and
4. Compensation – Used as last resort to offset impacts.
b) Habitat Loss, Severance and Fragmentation
6.4.3
Avoid removal of habitats where possible. The following are of particular
importance as they are listed as priority habitats under the Section 7 of the
Environment (Wales) Act 2016. The Act places a duty on public authorities to ‘seek
to maintain and enhance biodiversity’ of types of habitat included in on the Section
7 list, and encourage others to take such steps:
·
Woodland;
·
Semi-improved grassland;
·
Marshy grassland;
·
Standing water; and,
·
Hedgerows.
c) Loss and/or Disturbance of Breeding and Resting sites of Protected Species
6.4.4
Further surveys will confirm the presence of any breeding or resting sites.
Disturbance, destruction, or obstruction of breeding or resting sites for European
Protected Species (EPS) and certain nationally protected species, such as badger,
will require a licence from NRW. Compensatory habitat/sites, mitigation,
supervision of works and post construction monitoring would likely be required.
d) Disturbance, Injury and Killing during Construction
·
To reduce the risk of killing and injury to individual reptiles when vegetation is
cleared it is recommended that a programme of translocation and mitigation
based on a high population is undertaken prior to any site clearance.
·
Removal or maintenance of habitats that have the potential to support breeding
birds should take place outside of the breeding bird season (removal between
the 1st September and end of February). There is a potential for a clash
between the removal of vegetation to avoid impacts on birds and impacts on
reptiles. This will need to be managed and planned once timings are known.

The provision of bird boxes, such as swift boxes, typical garden bird boxes,
sparrow terraces and barn owl boxes will provide supplementary nesting sites.
·
Any new lighting design should avoid lighting of habitats with the potential to
support wildlife (such as vegetated habitats or buildings) and/or adjacent
habitats. Suggestions for mitigating external lighting and achieving the lighting
recommendations above are outlined in the best practice guidance by the Bat
Conservation Trust (Ref. 11 and Ref. 12) and are applicable to several other
nocturnal species.
·
A vehicle traffic assessment should be completed to understand the likely
impacts on habitats and species.
·
A noise and vibration assessment as a result of piling should be completed to
understand the likely impacts on species.
·
Excavations, if left unfilled overnight, should be covered to avoid animals
becoming trapped or excavations fitted with a scaffolding board ramp to allow
any trapped animals to exit.
e) Pollution to Land and/or Water
·
Appropriate measures should be in place to: control pollution and disturbance
during construction and adhere to applicable published guidelines. These
measures should be detailed and implemented via a Construction Management
Plan (CMP) and appropriate Toolbox Talks.
f)
Disturbance during Operation including Litter and Predation by Pets
·
Areas set aside for wildlife (for example reptile receptor areas, woodland,
diverse grassland planting) should be protected for the lifetime of the Project
Site and should have management plans in place which are followed to protect
and maintain the areas. For example, without active management through
successional change grassland will turn to dense scrub which would make an
area less suitable for reptiles.
·
A Habitat Management Plan should be created for operation of the Project Site.
g) Spread of Invasive Species
·
Invasive plants should be treated and removed from the Project Site as part of
the Project. The removal of the plants from the Project Site will be of benefit to
the biodiversity within the Project Site and the local area.
·
Prevent the tracking of vehicles over or otherwise disturbing areas of invasive
plant growth or areas of soil contaminated with the remains (roots, seeds, and
rhizomes).
·
Have an appropriate management plan in place during construction and
operation to help prevent/limit any re-growth or re-introduction of invasive
species that could be spread by works or invasive grounds maintenance
activities, such as flailing and use of tractors or frequent trampling by people.

h) Biodiversity Enhancements
6.4.5
The National Planning Policy Framework (March, 2012) and the Environment
(Wales) Act 2016, requires that developments enhance biodiversity, as well as just
mitigating impacts.
6.4.6
A detailed list of recommendations has not been completed. Further
recommendations can be made as a result of the further surveys and at EcIA stage.
6.4.7
Suggested potential enhancement measures for the Project Site are provided
below.
·
Implement a sympathetic management regime for the vegetation within the
Project Site to increase the conservation value and biodiversity of the Project
Site;
·
Use locally native species within the planting and landscaping deign, and
species that are of a benefit to invertebrates; and,
·
Include the provision of bird nesting features within the landscaping design.

Appendix A Wildlife Legislation and Local Planning Policy
8.2
Legislation – Habitats
8.2.1
A variety of sites are designated in the UK, under Conventions, Directives and
Regulations for their nature conservation importance and interest. The general aim
of these designations is to conserve and protect ecological resources, as well as
raising awareness and understanding. Other non-statutory sites are afforded some
protection through local plans. The following outlines the most common statutory
and non-statutory designations:
Designation
Brief Description
Special Areas of
Conservation
(SAC)
SACs are sites selected to conserve the natural habitat types and
species of wild flora and fauna listed in the Annexes of the Habitats
Directive (further information regarding the Habitats Directive is set out
in more detail in Table 8.3 below).  They are the best areas to
represent the range and variety of habitats and species within the
European Union (EU).
Special Protection
Area (SPA)
SPAs are strictly protected sites for the most important habitats for rare
and migratory birds within the EU classified in accordance with Article
4 of the Birds Directive information regarding the Birds Directive is set
out in more detail in Table 8.3 below).
Ramsar Sites
Ramsar Sites are wetlands of international importance. Ramsar Sites
are protected, through the planning system, under the Wildlife and
Countryside Act 1981 (as amended), and the Countryside and Rights
of Way Act 2000 through their notification as SSSIs and through other
regulatory systems addressing water, soil and air quality.
National Nature
Reserve (NNR)
NNRs are nationally important areas of wildlife habitat and geological
formations in Britain.  NNRs are designated and protected under the
National Parks and Access to the Countryside Act 1949 and the
Wildlife and Countryside Act 1981 (as amended). They receive
additional protection under the Countryside and Rights of Way Act
2000.  They are managed for the benefit of nature conservation.
Site of Special
Scientific Interest
(SSSI)
A SSSI is a site of at least national importance for nature conservation
designated under the Wildlife and Countryside Act 1981 (as amended)
due to its special interest in terms of flora, fauna or geological or
physiographical features.  Protection afforded to SSSI’s was
strengthened by the Countryside and Rights of Way Act 2000.  It
should be noted that under the Countryside and Rights of Way Act
2000 owners of SSSIs must give Natural Resources Wales (NRW)
written notice before they begin any of the operations listed in the
notification as likely to damage the special interest features, or if they
allow others to carry out these activities.  None of the listed operations
can be carried out without NRW’s consent.
County Wildlife
Site (Local site)
A County Wildlife Site is a non-statutory site designated by a local
authority as being of local nature conservation value.
Ancient Woodland
Ancient Woodland is a term applied to woodlands which have existed
from at least Medieval times to the present without ever having been
Abergelli ES 2018 – PRELIMINARY ECOLOGICAL APPRAISAL (NON-CONFIDENTIAL)

Designation
Brief Description
Inventory
cleared for uses other than wood or timber production.  A convenient
date used to separate ancient and secondary woodland is about the
year 1600. In special circumstances semi-natural woods of post-1600
but pre-1900 origin are also included.
Wildlife Trust
Reserve
These non-statutory sites are managed by the Wildlife Trusts with the
purpose of conserving wildlife.
8.3
Legislation – Protected Species
8.3.1
In addition to habitats, a number of species have been afforded protection through
international/European and national law. Other species are considered to contribute
to our ‘quality of life’. Although these species do not benefit from legal protection,
they can be material considerations in the planning process. The table below
outlines the key forms of protection afforded to species. The Countryside and
Rights of Way Act, the Wildlife and Countryside Act 1981 (as amended), The
Protection of Badgers Act 1992 and the Conservation of Habitats and Species
Regulations 2017 are the main legislative framework for protection of wild animals
in the UK. Schedule 1 of the Wildlife and Countryside Act 1981 (as amended)
covers birds, Schedule 5 covers other animals and Schedule 8 covers plants.
8.3.2
Species including bats, otters and great crested newts are listed under Schedule 2
of the Conservation of Habitats and Species Regulations 2017. Badgers are
protected under their own Act: The Protection of Badgers Act 1992. Activities
affecting protected species must usually be conducted under licence obtained from
the appropriate body (in Wales, this is Natural Resources Wales).
8.3.1
Developers must be able to show that all reasonable measures have been taken to
ensure that protected species are not subject to disturbance.  The habitats which
regularly support the Conservation of Habitats and Species Regulations
2017Schedule 2 species, the Wildlife and Countryside Act 1981 (as amended)
Schedule 1 species and some Wildlife and Countryside Act 1981 (as amended)
Schedule 5 species are also protected from disturbance and destruction. Again, all
reasonable precautions should be taken to ensure that this does not happen. The
Countryside and Rights of Way Act 2000 has strengthened enforcement powers
and introduced a new offence of “reckless disturbance” that applies to both
protected sites and species. Error! Reference source not found. below provides
a summary of the relevant legislation with regards to protected and priority species.
8.3.2
Legislation
Brief Description
The Habitats Directive
The Habitats Directive 1992 (Directive 92/43/EEC sets out the
legal framework requiring EU member states to protect habitat
sites supporting vulnerable and protected species, as listed
within the Directive. The need for an assessment of impacts on
Natura 2000 sites (the collective name for European designated
sites, including SPAs and SACs) is set out within Article 6 of the
Abergelli ES 2018 – PRELIMINARY ECOLOGICAL APPRAISAL (NON-CONFIDENTIAL)
Prepared for: Abergelli Power Limited          
AECOM
50
Legislation
Brief Description
Directive. The Directive is transposed into UK law through the
Conservation of Habitats and Species Regulations 2017) (the
"Habitats Regulations") and the Wildlife & Countryside Act 1981
(as amended).
The Birds Directive
The Directive on the Conservation of Wild Birds (Directive
2009/147/EC (the codified version of Council Directive
79/409/EEC as amended)) provides a framework for the
protection, management and control of all species of naturally
occurring wild birds in the European territory of Member States,
including the UK. The provisions of the Birds Directive are
transposed into UK law by the Conservation of Habitats and
Species Regulations, 2017 and the Wildlife & Countryside Act
1981 (as amended).
Wildlife and Countryside
Act (1981) (as
amended)
The Wildlife and Countryside Act 1981 (as amended) is the
principal mechanism for the legislative protection of wildlife in
Great Britain. This legislation is the means by which the
Convention on the Conservation of European Wildlife and
Natural Habitats (Bern Convention) and (partially) the Birds
Directive and the Habitats Directive are implemented in the UK.
The Countryside and Rights of Way Act 2000 has strengthened
this legal protection (see below).
A small number of plant species are listed under Schedule 9 of
the Wildlife and Countryside Act 1981, as amended, which
includes species such as Japanese knotweed (Fallopia
japonica), Himalayan balsam (Impatiens glandulifera),
montbretia (Crocosmia x crocosmiiflora), giant hogweed
(Heracleum mantegazzianum) and some cotoneaster species
(Cotoneaster sp.).  It is illegal to plant or to cause these plants to
grow in the wild, and legal disposal methods for vegetation and
soil subject to disturbance or clearance from a site must be
used.
Convention on
Biological Diversity and
the Countryside and
Rights of Way Act 2000
The Countryside and Rights of Way Act 2000 provides a
statutory framework for biodiversity conservation. The Act
places a duty on Government Departments and the National
Assembly for Wales to have regard for the conservation of
biodiversity and maintain lists of species and habitats for which
conservation steps should be taken or promoted, in accordance
with the Convention on Biological Diversity.
Schedule 9 of the Act amends SSSI provisions of the Wildlife
and Countryside Act 1981, including provisions to change SSSIs
and providing increased powers for their protection and
management. The provisions extend powers for entering into
management agreements; place a duty on public bodies to
further the conservation and enhancement of SSSIs; increases
penalties on conviction where the provisions are breached; and
introduce a new offence whereby third parties can be convicted

Legislation
Brief Description
for damaging SSSIs.
Schedule 12 of the Act amends the species provisions of the
Wildlife and Countryside Act 1981, strengthening the legal
protection for threatened species. The provisions make certain
offences 'arrestable' and create a new offence of reckless
disturbance.
The UK Biodiversity Action Plan (BAP) was published in 1994,
and was the UK Government’s response to the Convention on
Biological Diversity (CBD), which the UK signed up to in 1992. It
provides the framework for fulfilling the UK’s responsibilities
towards the Convention on Biological Diversity.  Conservation of
biodiversity (the variety of life on earth) is an essential element
of sustainable development.
Environment (Wales)
Act 2016
The Environment (Wales) Act puts in place the legislation
needed to plan and manage Wales’ natural resources in a more
proactive, sustainable and joined-up way.  Part 1 relates to the
sustainable management of natural resources.  This ensures
that the way in which the use of and the impacts on natural
resources do not result in long term decline.  The aim is to
sustainably manage natural resources in a way and rate that
meets the needs of present and current generations without
compromising the needs of future generations.
The Act also contains at section 7, a duty for the Welsh Ministers
prepare and publish a list of the living organisms and types of
habitat which in their opinion are of principal importance for the
purpose of maintaining and enhancing biodiversity in relation to
Wales. This section replaces the duty in section 42 of the NERC
Act 2006.
Protection of Badgers
Act 1992
The Protection of Badgers Act 1992 makes it an offence to
wilfully take, kill, injure or ill-treat a badger, possess a dead
badger or any part of a badger. Sett interference includes
damaging or destroying a sett, obstructing access to a sett, and
disturbing a badger whilst it is occupying a sett. The Act defines
a badger sett as ‘any structure or place, which displays signs
indicating the current use by a badger’ and Natural England
takes this definition to include seasonally used setts.
Work that may disturb badgers or their setts is illegal without a
development licence from the relevant statutory body (in this
case Natural Resources Wales).
The Hedgerow
Regulations 1997
The Hedgerow Regulations (1997) make provision for the
protection of important hedgerows in England and Wales. The
regulations affect hedgerows which are 20m or more in length,
or connected at both ends to another hedgerow of any length.
They relate to hedgerows which are on, or adjoining land used
for the following purposes: agriculture or forestry; the breeding or

Legislation
Brief Description
keeping of horses, ponies or donkeys; common land; village
greens; and SSSIs (They do not include hedges that are
attached to, or marking the boundaries of a private house.
It is an offence to intentionally or recklessly remove or cause or
permit another person to remove a hedgerow or intentionally or
recklessly remove, or cause or permit another person to remove,
a hedgerow which is the subject of a hedgerow retention notice.

Local Planning Policy
8.4.1
The table below provides a summary of relevant local planning policies found in the
Swansea Unitary Development Plan. For the precise wording of each specific
policy please refer back to the source document.
Planning Policy
Purpose /Relevant Sections
SP1 Creating a
Quality Environment
Sustainable development will be pursued as an integral principle of
the planning and development process.
Development proposals designed to a high quality and standard,
which enhance townscape, landscape, sense of place, and
strengthen Swansea Waterfront identity, will be favoured.
SP2 - Creating a
Quality Environment
The countryside will be protected and conserved, with green
wedges shaping the urban form and safeguarding the distinctive
interplay of town and country. Village character will be protected.
SP3 - Creating a
Quality Environment
The natural, built, and cultural heritage of the County will be
protected and enhanced to safeguard from materially harmful
development.
Siting and Location -
EV2
The siting of new development should give preference to the use of
previously developed land over greenfield sites, and must have
regard to the physical character and topography of the site and its
surroundings by:
i. Avoiding locations that would have a significant adverse impact on
prominent buildings, landscapes, open spaces and the general
locality, including loss of visual amenity,
ii. Effectively integrating with the landscape, seascape or coastline
by utilising topography to integrate into the contours of the site and
avoiding conspicuous locations on prominent skylines and ridges,
iii. Retaining important views into and out of the site,
iv. Taking into account and where possible retaining site features
including existing buildings, topography, landscape, archaeological
and water features, trees and hedgerows, and, where appropriate:
v. Undertaking, at the earliest opportunity, an assessment of
species and habitats on site and, where planning permission is
granted, implementing any necessary mitigation measures,
ix. Determining whether the proposal would be at risk from flooding,

AECOM
53
Planning Policy
Purpose /Relevant Sections
increase flood risk off-site, or create additional water run-off,
xiii. Having full regard to existing adjacent developments and the
possible impact of environmental pollution from those
developments, as well as the creation of any environmental
pollution to the detriment of neighbouring occupiers (including light,
air and noise).
Rural Development -
EV21
In the countryside non residential development will only be
permitted where it can be demonstrated that:
iii. It is an appropriate development associated with farm
diversification, sustainable tourism and recreation, or nature
conservation and does not adversely affect the viability of an
established farm unit.
Rural Development -
EV22
The countryside throughout the County will be conserved and
enhanced for the sake of its natural heritage, natural resources,
historic and cultural environment and agricultural and recreational
value through:
i. The control of development, and
ii. Practical management and improvement measures.
Sites of International
Importance - EV25
Development, alone or in combination with other plans or projects,
which is likely to adversely affect the integrity of a European
protected site (SAC, Marine SAC, SPA and Ramsar Sites) and is
not directly connected with or necessary to the management of the
site, will not be permitted unless:
i. There are imperative reasons of over-riding public interest,
including those of a social or economic nature, which are sufficient
to override the reasons for designation, and
ii. There is no alternative solution.
Where such development is permitted, planning conditions and/or
obligations will be used to secure all compensatory measures
necessary to ensure that the overall coherence of the European
Site is protected.
SSSIs and National
Nature Reserves -
EV27
Development that significantly adversely affects the special
interests of sites designated as SSSIs and NNRs will not be
permitted unless the need for the development is of such
significance that it outweighs the national importance of the
designation.
Where development is permitted, planning conditions and/or
obligations will be used to protect and enhance those interests and
where necessary provide effective mitigation and compensatory
measures.
Sites of Local
Importance - EV28
Within locally designated areas the natural heritage will be
preserved and enhanced wherever possible.
Development that would significantly adversely affect the special
interest of Local Nature Reserves will not be permitted unless the
need for the development is of such significance that it outweighs
the importance of the designation.

54
Planning Policy
Purpose /Relevant Sections
Development that would significantly adversely affect SINCs or
RIGs, or which would not provide for appropriate compensatory or
mitigation measures will not be permitted, unless it can be
demonstrated to meet appropriate social or economic needs where
the benefits in such terms would outweigh the harm to the feature
concerned.
Where development is permitted which would damage the nature
conservation value of the site, such damage will be kept to a
minimum, and appropriate mitigation or compensatory measures
sought.
Trees, Woodland
and Hedgerow
Protection - EV30
Protection and improved management of woodlands, trees and
hedgerows which are important for their visual amenity, historic
environment, natural heritage, and/or recreation value will be
encouraged, with priority being given to:
i. Protecting the remaining areas of ancient semi natural woodland
and planted ancient woodland sites,
ii. Promoting new planting with species appropriate to the location,
where there is no conflict with other land uses or nature
conservation interests, and
iii. Ensuring that where management involves commercial felling
and replanting, protection of amenity interests is achieved.
Environmental
Enhancement -
EV32
Environmental improvement schemes will be implemented at a
number of locations shown on the Proposals Map. These are
intended to:
i. Improve visual appearance, natural heritage value and recreation
potential,
ii. Improve the setting of industrial, commercial and residential
developments and transport corridors, and
iii. Maintain, extend and improve the quality of the urban
greenspace network in line with the aims of the ‘Greening the City’
strategy
Protection of
Controlled Waters -
EV34
Development proposals that may impact upon the water
environment will only be permitted where it can be demonstrated
that they would not pose a significant risk to the quality and or
quantity of controlled waters.
Initiatives that lead to improvements in the quality of surface water
will be approved subject to satisfactory ecological and visual
safeguards.
Protection of
Controlled Waters -
EV35
Development that would have an adverse impact on the water
environment due to:
i. Additional surface water run off leading to a significant risk of
flooding on site or an increase in flood risk elsewhere, and/or
ii. A reduction in the quality of surface water run-off,
will only be permitted where it can be demonstrated that appropriate
alleviating measures can be implemented.
Sustainable drainage systems (SUDS) will be encouraged wherever

AECOM
55
Planning Policy
Purpose /Relevant Sections
they would be effective and practicable, so as to ensure that
development does not increase run off, and potentially damage
important landscape features and protected species and habitats.
Where SUDS are not provided then any conventional drainage
system utilised must improve the status quo.
Air, Noise and Light
Pollution EV40
Development proposals will not be permitted that would cause or
result in significant harm to health, local amenity, natural heritage,
the historic environment or landscape character because of
significant levels of air, noise or light pollution.
8.4.2

implications of development proposals within areas
susceptible to flooding and preventing development that
unacceptably increases risk, and,
vi. Maintaining ecological resilience.
ER 
2 
Strategic 
Green
Infrastructure Network
Development will be required to maintain or enhance the
extent, quality and connectivity of the County’s multi-
functional 
green 
infrastructure 
network, 
and 
where
appropriate:
i. Create new interconnected areas of green infrastructure
between the proposed site and the existing strategic
network;
ii. Fill gaps in the existing network to improve connectivity;
and/or,
iii. In instances where loss of green infrastructure is
unavoidable, provide mitigation and compensation for the
lost assets.
ER 6 Designated Sites of
Importance 
for 
Nature
Conservation
Development will not be permitted that would result in a
likely significant adverse effect to sites of international or
national nature conservation importance.
Development that would affect locally designated sites of
nature 
conservation importance 
should maintain 
or
enhance the nature conservation interest of the site. Where
this cannot be achieved development will only be permitted
Abergelli ES 2018 – PRELIMINARY ECOLOGICAL APPRAISAL (NON-CONFIDENTIAL)
Prepared for: Abergelli Power Limited          
AECOM
56
where it can be demonstrated that:
i. The need for the development outweighs the need to
protect the site for nature conservation purposes;
ii. There is no satisfactory alternative location for the
development that avoids nature conservation impacts; and,
iii. Any unacceptable harm is kept to a minimum by effective
avoidance measures and mitigation, or where this is not
feasible compensatory measures must be put in place to
ensure that there is no overall reduction in the nature
conservation value of the area.
ER 8 Habitats and Species
Development proposals that would have a significant
adverse effect on the continued viability of habitats and
species, including those identified as priorities in the UK or
Swansea Local Biodiversity Action Plan, will only be
permitted where:
i. The need for development outweighs the nature
conservation importance of the site;
ii. The developer demonstrates that there is no satisfactory
alternative location for the development which avoids
nature conservation impacts;
iii. Effective mitigation measures are provided by the
developer; And,
iv. Any unavoidable harm is minimised by effective
mitigation to ensure that there is no reduction in the overall
nature conservation value of the area. Where this is not
feasible, compensation measures designed to conserve,
enhance, manage and, where appropriate, restore natural
habitats and species must be provided.
ER 9 Ecological Networks and
Features of Importance for
Biodiversity
Development proposals will be expected to maintain,
protect and enhance ecological networks and features of
importance for biodiversity. Particular importance will be
given to maintaining and enhancing the connectivity of
ecological networks which
enable the dispersal and
functioning of protected and priority species.
Development proposals that could result in a significant
adverse effect on the connectivity of ecological networks
and features of importance for biodiversity will only be
permitted where:
i. The need for the development outweighs the nature
conservation value of the site;

Summary
1.1
Abergelli Power Limited (APL) is promoting a new Power Generation Plant with its associated Gas
and Electricity Connections (the ‘Project’) on agricultural land within Abergelli Farm, north of
Swansea in the City and County of Swansea (approximately at National Grid Reference 265284,
201431).
1.2
As part of the preliminary ecological appraisal1 for the Survey Site, a request was made to the
South East Wales Biodiversity Records Centre (SEWBReC) and Swansea Council for information
on designated sites and protected or otherwise notable species on and around the Project Site
boundary at the time of the survey (hereafter referred to as the ‘Survey Site’). The information
collected during the preliminary ecological appraisal and the desk study was used to identify those
areas of the Survey Site that required a more detailed botanical survey (National Vegetation
Classification (NVC)). The map of Sites of Importance for Nature Conservation (SINCs) provided
by Swansea Council revealed that three SINCs, which contain habitats of potentially high botanical
value, lie within the Survey Site boundary. APL commissioned BSG Ecology to undertake an NVC
survey of woodlands and grasslands within the 150 ha of pastoral farmland within the Survey Site
in June and July 2014, to inform and support an application for Development Consent for the
Project.
1.3
The land within the Survey Site that is designated as SINC along with some additional fields that
were identified as being potentially ‘habitats of principal importance for nature conservation’ as
referred to in Section 42 of the NERC Act 2006 (S42) were selected for inclusion in the NVC
survey.
1.4
The surveys were carried out on 11th June 2014 by Anna Gundrey MCIEEM (woodland), 23rd and
25th June 2014 by Vilas Anthwal MCIEEM (woodland) and 30th June and 1st July 2014 by
Thomas Flynn (grasslands and mires). The complex of habitats around the gas compressor station
was visited again on 12 September 2014 to confirm the boundaries of some habitats; and on 14
November 2014 Niall Lusby rechecked the woodland canopy composition in survey area WL1 (see
Figure 2). The surveyors are all suitably qualified botanists and experienced NVC surveyors.
1.5

Introduction
2.1
Abergelli Power Limited commissioned BSG Ecology to undertake a National Vegetation
Classification (NVC) survey during 2014 to inform and support an application for Development
Consent for the Project described below.
Site Description
2.2
The Survey Site consists of approximately 150 ha of pastoral farmland, primarily grazed by horses.
The extent of the Survey Site is shown on Figure 1 and is centred at National Grid Reference
265284, 201431. The nearest settlement is Felindre, which is approximately 2 km to the north of
the Survey Site, with Swansea approximately 5 km to the south.
2.3
The Survey Site is largely agriculturally improved pasture with several areas of marshy grassland,
particularly in the north, south and north-western extents of the Survey Site. The fields are
bounded by fences, running along the line of defunct hedgerows, and often accompanied by
ditches. There is a block of broadleaved woodland on the eastern boundary of the Survey Site and
areas around the marshy grassland to the west of the Survey Site, and around Felindre Gas
Compressor Station and the two National Grid 400 kV electrical substations that lie at the south-
west end of the Survey Site.  The habitats in the surrounding landscape are similar to those within
the Survey Site boundary – a mixture of improved and marshy grassland interspersed with
occasional patches of woodland.
Description of Project
2.4
APL is promoting a new Power Generation Plant with associated Gas and Electricity Connections
within Abergelli Farm.  The Power Generation Plant would operate as a Simple Cycle Gas Turbine
(SCGT) peaking plant and would be designed to provide an electrical capacity of up to 299
Megawatts (MW).  It would be fuelled by natural gas, supplied by a new underground gas pipeline
connecting the Power Generation Plant to the existing National Grid Gas (NGG) National
Transmission System (NTS).  It would also connect to the National Grid Electrical Transmission
System (NETS) via underground cable or overhead lines.
2.5
BSG Ecology has been appointed as the ecological consultant to undertake ecology surveys,
including a desk study and Extended Phase 1 Habitat Survey as well as a range of Phase 2
surveys, including a NVC survey. These baseline surveys will be included in an appendix to an
ecology chapter of an Environmental Statement, which is intended for submission, as an integral
part of the application for Development Consent.
Aims of Study
2.6
The aims of this study are as follows:

Identify habitats on the Survey Site that are potentially sensitive or important, either because
of their ecological designation or the plant community that is present; and

In order to fully describe such habitats, undertake a National Vegetation Classification (NVC)
survey to classify those plant communities present in the identified areas.

Methods
Desk Study
3.1
As part of the Preliminary Ecological Appraisal (PEA) for the Survey Site2, a request was made to
the South East Wales Biodiversity Records Centre (SEWBReC) and Swansea Council for
information on designated sites and protected or otherwise notable species on and around the
Survey Site.
3.2
Of relevance to this report was the data provided by Swansea Council on locally-designated SINCs
and the botanical data provided by SEWBReC from within a 2km radius of the Survey Site
boundary.
3.3
The information collected during the PEA was used to identify those areas of the Survey Site that
required a detailed botanical survey.
3.4
These areas were selected for more detailed botanical survey on the basis that either they were
identified as NERC Act Section 42 habitats of principal importance for biodiversity (see Appendix
2), and / or they lie within a SINC boundary for which habitats are a qualifying feature, and/or they
are identified on the Ancient Woodland Inventory for Wales.
Field Survey
3.5
Each parcel of land included in the survey was initially walked by the surveyor to map the broad
community types with the aid of aerial photographs. Quadrats (measuring 2 m x 2 m for grassland
and 50 m x 50 m for woodland canopy (with multiple 4 m x 4 m quadrats for field layer and ground
flora as dictated by the complexity of the woodland stands) were then marked out in blocks of
vegetation that were considered representative of each community type. In the case of narrow
linear habitats (two over-mature hedge banks and a narrow strip of woodland) it was very difficult to
identify quadrats so whole lengths were surveyed and species’ cover values were recorded
accordingly.
3.6
The number of quadrats employed in each type or area of vegetation was related to the level of
floristic variability present. For uniform areas of vegetation, one or several quadrats were
employed. For vegetation exhibiting more variability, larger numbers of quadrats (up to six in this
survey) were employed. The number of quadrats utilized for each vegetation type reflected the
surveyors’ judgement of the number required to sufficiently capture the floristic variation present. In
addition, the identification of plant communities is a two stage process with broad communities
identified in the field, and more definitive identifications of community and sub-community occurring
later, after data analysis. Therefore the numbers of quadrats associated with the final plant
community categories is variable. All plant species present within quadrats were recorded, along
with estimates of their cover values. Cover values were recorded using the Domin scale of Rodwell
et al. (1991) (see Appendix 3).  The lists of species generated were evaluated against the keys and
community accounts in the relevant British Plant Community Volume3 to establish the closest fit to
a National Vegetation Classification (NVC) community.
Survey Limitations
3.7
Access to parts of sites G2 and G3, as shown on Figure 1, was limited by impenetrable vegetation.
This limited the number of quadrats that could be employed in these areas. It is possible that the
data obtained in these areas may not be representative, particularly with respect to identifying the
presence or absence of rare or notable species. One or more quadrats were placed in the more
open parts of areas G2 and G3, but quadrat data was not collected from the dense scrub. The
dense scrub was assigned to an NVC category by the surveyor in the field, based on the
surveyor’s judgement and experience. Because the surveyor was an experienced botanist with

considerable experience of NVC surveys, this approach to the survey of areas G2 and G3 is not
considered to have affected the aims and value of the survey. The general character of the
vegetation and the typical/abundant species in these areas were determined with a high level of
confidence and any limitations are not considered to be significant.
3.8
Because of the very narrow and limited extent of the cover of vegetation at WL9, WL11, and a part
of WL13, the survey was conducted using the whole compartment as the quadrat. In places there
is a limited canopy but the dominant species were clear and communities have been assigned with
a reasonably high level of confidence. The assigned communities are consistent with adjacent
patches of woodland.

SEWBReC did not provide any records of notable botanical species on the Survey Site.
4.2
The map of SINCs provided by Swansea Council revealed that three SINCs lie within the Survey
Site boundary.  These are Rhyd-Y-Pandy Valley Grasslands SINC, Waun Garn Wen SINC and
Llety Morfil SINC. Brief descriptions of the habitats present in each SINC are provided below and
summarised from citations provided by Swansea Council:

Rhyd-Y-Pandy Valley and Grasslands: Wet woodland and woodland with assemblage of
ancient woodland indicator species, scrub, purple moor grass Molinia caerulea and rush
pasture, lowland meadow, neutral grassland, scrub, reed bed and water course habitats;


Vegetation Community Descriptions
MG6a Lolium perenne – Cynosurus cristatus grassland, typical Sub-Community
4.7
This is the major permanent pasture type on moist free draining neutral soils in lowland Britain.  It
is generally species-poor and grass-dominated.  Typical species include perennial rye-grass
Lolium perenne, crested dog’s-tail Cynosurus cristatus, red fescue Festuca rubra and common
bent Agrostis capillaris.  Broad-leaved plants are generally sparse and consist of common and
widespread species, such as common mouse-ear Cerastium fontanum, ribwort plantain Plantago
lanceolata, white clover Trifolium repens and creeping buttercup Ranunculus repens.
4.8
A large proportion of the Survey Site is MG6a grassland which, because of its ubiquity, was not
included in the NVC survey area.  However, some fields that meet this classification are included
within the survey area because they lie within a SINC boundary.  These are in G4 and G5.  The
MG6a grassland within G4 is a typical community with perennial rye-grass, crested dog’s-tail and
Yorkshire fog Holcus lanatus being the main grasses; and broad-leaved species including white
clover, daisy Bellis perennis and ribwort plantain.
4.9
The MG6a grassland at G5 includes more moisture-tolerant species such as marsh thistle Cirsium
palustre, marsh bedstraw Galium palustre and sharp-flowered rush Juncus acutiflorus, as well as
the more typical perennial rye-grass and white clover.  Of particular note was whorled caraway
Carum verticillatum, a species with very local distribution (confined to the extreme west of Britain),
which is more usually found in M23/M25 mire habitats (see below).
MG10a Holcus lanatus – Juncus effusus rush pasture, typical sub-community
4.10
This is a neutral grassland community with prominent tussocks of soft rush Juncus effusus in and
amongst species-poor shorter grassland.  Broad-leaved species are generally few in number, but
creeping and meadow buttercup Ranunculus acris can be abundant along with common species
such as white clover, common sorrel Rumex acetosa, and cuckoo flower Cardamine pratensis.
4.11
This community is found in G4, G5 and G6. The MG10a grassland at G5 is in a close association
with MG6a (above).  One field has a central wetter area of MG10a grassland within a larger area of
MG6a, whilst another is a continuum between the two communities.  It has frequent perennial rye-
grass and cock’s-foot Dactylis glomerata indicative of MG6a, but also abundant soft rush and
Yorkshire fog. A number of plants of whorled caraway (see paragraph 3.9 above) were also noted.
4.12
The MG10a grassland at G4 also forms a continuum from adjacent slightly drier MG6a habitats.  It
has abundant soft rush and Yorkshire fog, with smaller proportions of creeping buttercup, fleabane
Pulicaria dysenterica and selfheal Prunella vulgaris.
4.13
The grassland in G6 is heavily disturbed having apparently been mown, harrowed and sprayed to
remove the rushes.  However, the constant species of MG10a such as soft rush, Yorkshire fog,
creeping bent Agrostis stolonifera and creeping buttercup are still in evidence.
M15b Scirpus cespitosus – Erica tetralix wet heath, typical sub-community
4.14
This is a community of moist acid peats and peaty soils in the western parts of Britain.  It is
generally characterized by a mixture of varying quantities of purple moor-grass, deer grass
Trichophorum cespitosum (Scirpus cespitosus), cross-leaved heath Erica tetralix and heather
Calluna vulgaris.
4.15
A large block of the M15b typical sub-community is present on G1.  Purple moor grass and cross-
leaved heath are both abundant here, with frequent deer grass and heather.  Other species include
common hair grass
Eriophorum angustifolium, small amounts of hare’s-tail cotton grass
Eriophorum vaginatum, heath milkwort Polygala serpyllifolia and marsh lousewort Pedicularis
palustris.

M23 Juncus effusus/acutiflorus - Galium palustre rush-pasture and two sub-communities
(M23a Juncus acutiflorus sub-community; and M23b Juncus effusus sub-community)
4.16
This community is defined by the presence of an abundance of soft rush and/or sharp-flowered
rush amongst mesophytic herbs widely occurring in moister agricultural grasslands.  It is not a
species-rich community, but a diverse range of species can occur amongst the dominant rushes.
4.17
In the habitats present on site, there is mostly a similar proportion of both rushes present, but
where soft rush is predominant, and purple moor-grass and whorled caraway are absent, the
Juncus effusus sub-community M23b has been assigned. This sub-community represents a
transition from the drier MG10 rush pasture community described above.  Commonly occurring
species in this sub-community include Yorkshire-fog, velvet bent Agrostis canina, tufted hair grass
Deschampsia cespitosa, creeping buttercup, marsh bedstraw and marsh thistle. Where sharp-
flowered rush is dominant or abundant, or purple moor-grass is abundant, the Juncus acutiflorus
sub-community M23a has been assigned.
4.18
The M23 community is present on G1 – G5. On G1 there is an area of M23a at the southern tip of
the surveyed area.  It includes typical M23 species such as velvet bent, soft and sharp flowered
rushes, marsh bedstraw and Yorkshire fog, as well species more typical of the M15b wet heath to
which it lies adjacent –
purple moor grass, tormentil Potentilla erecta and heath rush Juncus
squarrosus. This is a fairly grassy, probably relatively dry example of this community. The local
abundance of purple moor-grass suggests affinity with the M23a sub-community, and this
vegetation has therefore been mapped as M23a.
4.19
On G2 the M23b sub-community is present within (and in mosaic with) extensive areas of scrub.
Much of this area was inaccessible because of the dense scrub cover.  The M23b areas surveyed
has abundant soft rush cover, with creeping bent, wild angelica Angelica sylvestris, greater bird’s-
foot trefoil Lotus pedunculatus and ragged robin Lychnis flos-cuculi.  Species more typical of
scrubby margins were also present in some quantity, including bramble, rosebay willowherb
Chamerion angustifolium, greater willowherb Epilobium hirsutum and hemp agrimony Eupatorium
cannabinum.
4.20
G3 is similar to G2, consisting of a wetter area surrounded by, and in mosaic with, an extensive
area of scrub.  The M23b community here is overwhelmingly dominated by soft rush, with
occasional wild angelica and bulrush Typha latifolia.
4.21
The M23 community on G4 lies along the gallops and is present in association with MG6a, MG10a,
and M25 communities.  Soft and sharp-flowered rush are both present in some quantity, along with
marsh bedstraw, greater bird’s-foot trefoil, creeping buttercup, white clover and lesser spearwort
Ranunculus flammula. Because of the abundance of sharp-flowered rush, the M23 community has
been identified as M23a.
4.22
The two fields on the northern and eastern edges of G5 are classified as M23a and M23b.  The
field to the north has an abundance of soft rush with occasional sharp-flowered rush and so is
classified as M23b.   It also has abundant creeping bent and frequent marsh bedstraw and greater
bird’s-foot trefoil and small quantities of wild angelica, Yorkshire fog and tormentil.  Purple moor
grass is occasionally present.  The eastern field has an abundance of both soft and sharp-flowered
rush and Yorkshire fog and greater bird’s-foot trefoil are both frequent and there are smaller
quantities of velvet bent, sweet vernal grass Anthoxanthum odoratum, marsh bedstraw and
creeping buttercup. While the field could probably be assigned to the wider M23 community, it is
worth noting that this area was mown prior to the survey. However, the unmown parts were
relatively species-rich and a cautious assessment of the M23 community as M23a has been made.
M25a Molinea caerulea – Potentilla erecta mire, Erica tetralix sub-community
4.23
This community is characterised by the overwhelming dominance of purple moor grass, which
distinguishes it from the M23 community described above.  Other species are limited in number
and abundance.  Soft rush and sharp-flowered rush can be frequent, but tormentil is the only
broad-leaved species that occurs regularly.
4.24
A large block of the Erica tetralix M25a sub-community is present on G1 and a smaller patch of this
community is present on G4.  On G1 purple moor grass is dominant, with small amounts of
tormentil, cross-leaved heath, soft and sharp-flowered rush, bilberry Vaccinium myrtillus, devil’s-bit
scabious Succisa pratensis and deer grass.
Abergelli Power Project – NVC Survey Report
10
17/11/2014
4.25
The patch of M25a on G4 is overwhelmingly dominated by purple moor-grass, with no other
species recorded.
M25c Molinea caerulea – Potentilla erecta mire, Angelica sylvestris sub-community
4.26
The patch of M25 on G5 lies adjacent to a stream, and has a lower dominance of purple moor-
grass, although it is still the most abundant species, and forms distinct tussocks.  Other species
present include soft rush, marsh bedstraw, greater bird’s-foot trefoil and wild angelica. The
abundance of wild angelica suggests affinity with the M25c Angelica sylvestris sub-community, and
this vegetation has therefore been classified as this.
W1 Salix cinerea – Galium palustre woodland
4.27
This community has a canopy dominated by grey willow Salix cinerea, with scattered silver birch
and alder occasionally present.  The field layer is variable but often consists of mosaics of more
open areas over undulations in wetter and drier ground.  Common species are marsh bedstraw,
water mint Mentha aquatica and soft rush.
4.28
This community is found in mosaic with M23b (see above) on survey areas G2 and G3.
The
dominant woody species is grey willow, mixed with hazel Corylus avellana and bramble.  Other
species present include soft rush, hemp agrimony and foxglove Digitalis purpurea.
W6e Alnus glutinosa – Urtica dioica woodland, Betula pubescens sub-community
4.29
This classification brings together a variety of canopies dominated by alder, willows Salix spp., and
silver birch.  The field layer is generally species-poor, with nettle Urtica dioica being the only
constant. The Betula pubescens sub-community has a greater dominance of downy birch, with an
understorey of bramble and honeysuckle Lonicera periclymenum and scattered broad-buckler fern
Dryopteris dilatata and patchily abundant nettle.
4.30
This sub-community is present at WL4, WL5 and WL7.  Here the sparse canopy consist largely of
downy birch and grey willow, with rowan Sorbus aucuparia, sycamore Acer pseudoplatanus, and
pedunculate oak also present in small numbers. Bramble is frequent in the understorey.
The
ground flora is dominated by the invasive species Himalayan balsam, which fills a niche usually
occupied by nettle. Nettle also remains frequent, and other species occasionally present include
cleavers Galium aparine, yellow pimpernel Lysimachia nemorum, creeping soft grass Holcus mollis
and ivy Hedera helix.
W7 Alnus glutinosa – Fraxinus excelsior – Lysimachia nemorum woodland
4.31
This community tends to have an open and irregular canopy of trees with alder being the only
woody constant.  The most frequent understorey species are hazel, hawthorn and grey willow; and
the ground flora includes creeping buttercup, rough meadow grass Poa trivialis, Yorkshire fog and
yellow pimpernel.
4.32
The W7 community is found on survey areas WL16 (where it forms a mosaic with rush pasture and
W10 woodland) and WL17. On these areas, pedunculate oak and grey willow form the canopy,
with lower-growing alder, holly Ilex aquifolium and grey willow making up the understorey.
Bramble scrub is abundant, and the ground flora is sparse. The ground flora includes ivy, soft rush
and marsh bedstraw.
W10 Quercus robur – Pteridium aquilinum – Rubus fruticosus Woodland
4.33
This is essentially oak woodland, with pedunculate oak being the commonest tree.  Birch (usually
silver birch, but also downy birch) is also frequently present.  Holly, rowan and sometimes beech
Fagus sylvatica occur, and alder may be present on wetter areas.
The understorey generally
includes frequent bramble and honeysuckle.  The ground flora can include bluebell Hyacinthoides
non-scripta, creeping soft grass Holcus mollis and bracken, and ferns such as male fern Dryopteris
filix-mas and broad-buckler fern.
4.34
The W10 community is found on survey areas WL1, WL2, WL3, WL6, WL8, WL9, WL10, WL11,
WL12, WL13, WL14, WL15 and WL16. In WL9, 11, and 13 the canopy is very narrow, in places
only one tree deep. More generally in the W10 areas, pedunculate oak is the dominant canopy
tree, with downy birch also frequent.  The understorey includes rowan, grey willow and holly, and
Abergelli Power Project – NVC Survey Report
11
17/11/2014
also abundant bramble.  The ground flora includes frequent ivy, with scattered broad-buckler fern,
lady fern Athyrium filix-femina and hard fern Blechnum spicant.
Creeping bent, common bent,
bluebell Hyacinthoides non-scripta, creeping buttercup and soft rush are amongst other species
occasionally present.
4.35
In survey area WL1, the W10 woodland has a relatively sparse and uniform open canopy. Part of
WL1 follows a high voltage overhead power line, and presumably tall vegetation is regularly
cleared from this area. The canopy here is particularly open and the understorey has a high level of
rowan. The field layer in WL1 is dominated by grasses (such as Yorkshire fog and rough meadow-
grass Poa trivialis), with some woodland species (such as bluebell, and foxglove), and (in places)
indicators of damp ground (wavy bitter-cress Cardamine flexuosa and creeping buttercup). This
field layer shows some similarity with MG10 rush pasture, except for the absence of rushes
(Juncus sp.); and with MG9 grassland, except for the absence of tufted hair-grass Deschampsia
cespitosa. The poor fit with plant communities described in the NVC may result from the on-going
management in this area. Here, the vegetation is considered to be sparse W10 woodland with a
grass-dominated field layer.

Appendix 2 - Legislation
Natural Environment and Rural Communities (NERC) Act 2006
Section 40 of the Natural Environment and Rural Community Act (NERC) 2006 sets out the duty which
public authorities have to conserve biodiversity. Section 40 States that: “every public authority must, in
exercising its functions, have regard, so far as is consistent with the proper exercise of those functions, to
the purpose of conserving biodiversity”. The term Public Authority includes local authorities and local
planning authorities.
Paragraph 40(3) goes on to state that “conserving biodiversity includes, in relation to a living organism or
type of habitat, restoring or enhancing a population or habitat”.
Paragraph 42(1) states that “the Secretary of State must, as respects Wales, publish a list of the living
organisms and types of habitat which in the Secretary of State’s opinion are of principal importance for the
purpose of conserving biodiversity”. This replaces a similar reference to the list that was found in Section 74
of the Countryside and Rights of Way Act 2000 (the CRoW Act).

Summary
1.1
Abergelli Power Limited (APL) is promoting a new Power Generation Plant with its associated Gas
and Electricity Connections (the ‘Project’) on agricultural land within Abergelli Farm, north of
Swansea in the City and County of Swansea (approximately at National Grid Reference 265284,
201431).
1.2
As part of the Preliminary Ecological Appraisal (PEA) (BSG Ecology, 2014a) for the Project Site
(hereafter referred to as the ‘Survey Site’), a request was made to the South East Wales
Biodiversity Records Centre (SEWBReC) and Swansea Council for information on designated sites
and protected or otherwise notable species within 2 km of the ‘Survey Site’. The desk study
provided 40 records of four Lepidoptera1 ‘species of principal importance for nature conservation’
as referred to in Section 42 of the NERC Act 2006 (S42), within 2 km of the Survey Site, including
29 records of marsh fritillary butterfly Euphydryas aurinia. In addition, the desk study revealed that
three Sites of Importance for Nature Conservation (SINC) lie within the Survey Site boundary and
contain some potentially valuable habitats for invertebrates, with S42 invertebrate species recorded
at two of them. The PEA confirmed the presence of several potentially valuable habitats for
invertebrates, particularly woodland, marshy grassland, watercourses and ponds.
1.3
APL commissioned BSG Ecology to undertake invertebrate surveys of suitable habitats within the
Survey Site boundary. Surveys were carried out during June-September 2014 for moths, marsh
fritillary (adult and larval stages), terrestrial Coleoptera2, and aquatic macroinvertebrates3 (in ponds
and watercourses). The purpose of the surveys was to inform and support an application for
Development Consent for the Project.
1.4
A total of 384 species were recorded from the Survey Site. One species is Red Data Book
(insufficiently known4), two are nationally scarce and fourteen are S42 species. The results of each
survey is summarised as follows:

Terrestrial Coleoptera survey: 150 species were recorded during two surveys (in July and
September). These included 112 species of Coleoptera, 20 of which are saproxylic5 species
(see 3.6) although none are indicative of continuous saproxylic habitat, which may be taken as
an indicator of the quality of ancient woodland habitat;

Marsh fritillary survey: This species was not recorded during surveys for adult or larval stages,
although seven butterfly and two day-flying moth species were observed. These included one
S42 species;

Moth survey: 118 species of moth were recorded during two night-time surveys. Three locally
notable species (see 4.36) were recorded and 13 S42 species;

Pond survey: 48 species of aquatic macroinvertebrates were recorded during the survey of
Ponds 11 and 16, with the highest diversity of species recorded at Pond 11. No scarce or
threatened aquatic invertebrates were identified within the samples; and

Watercourse survey: all of the watercourses sampled were of very good quality. 59 species
were recorded with no scarce or threatened aquatic invertebrates identified within the samples.
1 Butterflies and moths.
2 Beetles.
3 An invertebrate that is large enough to be seen without the use of a microscope.
4 The category insufficiently known refers to species for which insufficient data exists to assign that species to another
RDB category, e.g. rare or vulnerable.
5 Beetles which live in or on dead wood or involved in or dependent on wood decay

Introduction
2.1
Abergelli Power Limited commissioned BSG Ecology to undertake an invertebrate survey in 2014
to inform and support an application for Development Consent for the Project described below.
Site Description
2.2
The Survey Site consists of approximately 150 ha of pastoral farmland primarily grazed by horses.
The extent of the Survey Site is shown in Figure 1 (Figures are located in Appendix 1) and is
centred at National Grid Reference 265284, 201431. The nearest settlement is Felindre, which is
located approximately 2 km to the north of the Survey Site, with Swansea approximately 5 km to
the south.
2.3
The Survey Site is largely agriculturally improved pasture with several areas of marshy grassland,
particularly in the north, south and north-western extents of the Survey Site. The fields are bounded
by fences, running along the line of defunct hedgerows, and often accompanied by ditches. There
is a block of broadleaved woodland on the eastern boundary of the Survey Site and other areas of
woodland around the marshy grassland to the west of the Survey Site, and around Felindre Gas
Compressor Station and the two National Grid 400 kV electrical substations that lie at the south-
west end of the Survey Site.  The habitats in the surrounding landscape are similar to those within
the Survey Site boundary comprising a mixture of improved and marshy grassland interspersed
with occasional patches of woodland.
Description of Project
2.4
APL is promoting a new Power Generation Plant with associated Gas and Electricity Connections
within Abergelli Farm.  The Power Generation Plant would operate as a Simple Cycle Gas Turbine
(SCGT) peaking plant and would be designed to provide an electrical capacity of up to 299
Megawatts (MW).  It would be fuelled by natural gas, supplied by a new underground gas pipeline
connecting the Power Generation Plant to the existing National Grid Gas (NGG) National
Transmission System (NTS).  It would also connect to the National Grid Electrical Transmission
System (NETS) via underground cable or overhead lines.
2.5
BSG Ecology has been appointed as the ecological consultant to undertake ecology surveys,
including a PEA as well as a range of Phase 2 surveys, including invertebrate surveys. These
baseline surveys will be included in an appendix to an ecology chapter of an Environmental
Statement, which is intended for submission, in support of the application for Development
Consent.
Aims of Study
2.6
The aims of the invertebrate survey were to indicate the quality of habitats present on the Survey
Site that are potentially important for invertebrates; and to identify whether any notable species
(e.g. rare, scarce or nationally threatened species of invertebrate, including S42 species), are
present and if present, to indicate their likely distribution across the Survey Site.

Methods
Desk Study
3.1
Existing ecological information for the Survey Site and its surrounding area was requested from the
South East Wales Biodiversity Records Centre (SEWBReC). Information on protected6 or notable
species (particularly those identified as S42 species and/or of local conservation importance or
LBAP7 species), including invertebrates, was requested covering the Survey Site and land up to 2
km from the Survey Site boundary. In addition, on-line resources including the Multi Agency
Geographic Information for the Countryside (MAGIC, www.magic.gov.uk) website8 and aerial
photography of the area were also reviewed.
Habitat Potential Assessment
3.2
During the Extended Phase 1 Habitat Survey of the Survey Site, carried out to inform the PEA,
which was undertaken in three phases (in February, April and July 2014), consideration was given
to the suitability of the Survey Site to support important invertebrate communities as well as
protected and/or notable invertebrate species. Full details of the PEA are provided in the PEA
report (BSG Ecology, 2014).
3.3
As part of this assessment, notes were made of the habitats present, which included observations
of features that might limit invertebrate interest as well as those which might be of particular value
for invertebrates. In particular, emphasis was placed on the following features (where present):

Mature open grown trees and veteran trees: especially those with large volumes of standing
dead wood;

Woodland edge and scrub: especially where there is a diverse vegetation structure and
species composition;

Species-rich grassland: especially that in association with scrub, with a high proportion of
plants providing nectar and pollen, and with a varied vegetation structure;

Early successional habitat: (e.g. cliff faces, quarries, eroded banks, periodically disturbed bare
or sparsely vegetated ground) especially on free-draining ground where there is a high
proportion of exposed bare earth; and

Wetland: including watercourses (e.g. streams, ditches, flushes and seepages), standing water
or waterbodies (e.g. ponds, lakes and swamp) and associated terrestrial habitat (e.g. wet heath
and marshy grassland).
3.4
A number of habitats were identified during the survey with the potential to support important
invertebrate communities (which are described further in the results section). Subsequent
invertebrate surveys were designed, to target key indicator groups of invertebrates within the
survey area that may be associated with woodland and marshy grassland in particular, namely
Coleoptera (terrestrial beetles) and Lepidoptera (marsh fritillary butterfly and moths). In addition,
two ponds (see Figure 1: Pond 11 and Pond 16) and three watercourses (see Figure 2) within the
Survey Site were identified as of potential value to aquatic invertebrates.
3.5
The results of these targeted surveys can be used to assess the main groups of invertebrate
present within the Survey Site, and to provide an indication of the relative species diversity within
the targeted groups.
Targeted Survey for Coleoptera
3.6
Features within the Survey Site that provided the most suitable habitat for this taxonomic order
were selected for targeted survey.  Surveys for beetles focussed on woodland and woodland edge

Protection of Badgers Act.

habitats within the Survey Site as a number of the woodland areas are listed on the Ancient
Woodland Inventory for Wales and one of the aims of the survey was to identify whether the beetle
fauna present within the Survey Site is indicative of high quality ancient woodland. The assessment
of whether woodland is ancient and/or is of high quality to invertebrates can be indicated by
surveying the saproxylic beetle fauna. The presence of a particular species or a high diversity of
such species can indicate the continuity of woodland on a site. This has been used in the
formulation of an Index of Ecological Continuity (Alexander, 2004) based on the scores assigned to
180 species of Coleoptera taken as ‘indicative of continuity of saproxylic habitats’ from a more
general list of 700 saproxylic species. Across the four main areas of woodland on the Survey Site
(Woodlands 1-4; see Figure 1) the following sampling methods were employed: pitfall traps, sweep
netting, beating, hand searching and sieving. These methods are described below. Whilst
Coleoptera formed the focus of the survey, incidental records of other invertebrate taxa were also
taken. Surveys were conducted on 10 July 2014 by Don Stenhouse FRES and on 18 September
2014 by Jim Fairclough MCIEEM, both suitably qualified entomologists.
Pitfall Traps
3.7
Two or three pitfall traps were set out in each of the four woodlands within the Survey Site (shown
on Figure 1).  The number of traps in each woodland was dependent on the availability of suitable
locations for trapping and the size and quality of the habitat. Pitfall trapping involved the use of
circular plant pot trays (24 cm diameter x 5 cm depth) that were sunk into a circular hole that had
been excavated using a spade.  The trays were installed such that the tray rims were flush with the
surrounding ground level.  Preserving fluid, comprising 1 part ethylene glycol (antifreeze) to 3 parts
water, was poured into the trays until they were half full.  A drop of detergent was added to the fluid
to break the surface tension and a layer of mesh (aperture size 2 cm x 1 cm) was balanced over
the tray to prevent capture of small mammals, amphibians and reptiles. The traps were operational
between 10 and 28 July 2014 as well as between 9 and 18 September 2014. Pitfall trapping is
considered to be an effective method for the sampling of ground dwelling beetles, particularly those
belonging to the family Carabidae (ground beetles).
Sweep Netting
3.8
Sweep netting involved walking at a steady pace and passing a heavy duty entomologist’s sweep
net back and forth through scrub and understorey vegetation in a figure of eight motion. This
method is particularly suitable for capturing phytophagous (foliage-feeding) families such as
Curculionidae (weevils), Chrysomelidae (leaf or flea beetles), Nitidulidae (pollen beetles) and
Cantharidae (soldier beetles).
Beating
3.9
Beating is an appropriate technique for extracting beetles from overhanging branches. This method
involves placing a beating tray beneath a branch before delivering several sharp blows to the
branch and sending any dislodged invertebrates into the beating tray for inspection. This method
may uncover a diverse array of beetle families that are similar to those found during the sweeping,
and may additionally produce Cerambycids (longhorn beetles) or Elaterids (click beetles), many of
which are associated with dead wood habitats.
Hand-searching and Sieving
3.10
Hand searching under logs and bark of dead trees, as well as grass tussocks and pleurocarpous
(spreading and branched) mosses is a useful additional technique of extracting invertebrates by
hand. In addition, samples of rotten wood, leaf/grass litter or moss were sieved into a white tray to
extract additional samples. This technique is particularly appropriate to aid detection of small, often
obscure beetles such as Staphylinidae (rove beetles), Anobiidae (wood-boring beetles) and
Cryptophagidae (silken fungus beetles).
Weather Conditions
3.11
For the first survey the weather had been warm and settled in the preceding weeks with some rain
in the days immediately preceding the survey. On the first survey visit, conducted on 10 July 2014,
the weather was dry, sunny and warm (maximum temperature 22°C), with a light wind.
Abergelli Power Project – Invertebrate Survey Report

20/11/2014
3.12
For the second survey, conditions in the week preceding the survey were dry and warm. On the
second survey visit, conducted on 18 September, the weather was overcast but dry with a light
wind and a temperature of 19°C.
3.13
The weather during both periods of pitfall trapping was generally warm and dry.
Sample Sorting and Identification
3.14
Whilst some species could be identified in the field, the majority of specimens were stored in 70%
methanol solution for subsequent identification, using a stereoscopic microscope with the aid of
identification literature. Don Stenhouse carried out identification of all terrestrial invertebrate
samples collected from the Survey Site.
Targeted Survey for Marsh Fritillary
Survey for Adult Butterflies
3.15
On 7 and 17 June 2014, Matthew Hobbs MCIEEM, an experienced butterfly surveyor, visited the
Survey Site to conduct a walked butterfly transect survey following standard methods described
below, with a focus on recording marsh fritillary butterfly in its adult stage.
3.16
A transect route was selected to cover an area of marshy grassland in the north-west of the Survey
Site that forms part of the Waun Garn Wen SINC. Marsh fritillary butterfly has apparently not been
previously recorded within this SINC, as no desk study records were received and the species is
not mentioned in the SINC citation. However, some areas of the marshy grassland habitat
comprise the National Vegetation Classification (NVC) habitat type, M25 Molinia caerulea –
Potentilla erecta mire9. This habitat supports a number of devil’s bit scabious Succisa pratensis
plants within the sward. Marsh fritillary larvae will only feed on scabious plants (with devil’s bit
scabious the most important larval host plant) and this species is the only scabious species present
within the Survey Site. As such, this is the only area that has the potential to support a breeding
population of marsh fritillary within the Survey Site and is the only area that was surveyed. The
area that the transect route covered is shown on Figure 1. The methodology used for the survey
adapted the protocol used within the UK Butterfly Monitoring Scheme (UKBMS)10, as follows:

Timed counts were made between 10:00 and 16:30 hours, and only carried out in warm, bright
and dry weather, with no more than moderate winds;

A transect route was devised (Figure 1), which was split into sections, each section being of
similar length and covering discreet ‘field’ or habitat types;

Each section was walked at a slow, steady pace counting all butterflies seen within a fixed
distance, 2.5 m either side of the transect line and 5 m ahead;

Care was taken to maintain a steady pace and avoid waiting at favoured hotspots to improve
the count and bias the results;

Butterfly numbers and percentage of sunshine in each section were recorded using the
standard UKBMS proforma. Wind speed was estimated using the Beaufort scale (0 - no wind, 6
- very strong wind); and

During surveys, species of butterfly other than marsh fritillary and day-flying moths were also
recorded.
3.17
During the two surveys on 7 and 17 June, the wind speed was measured as 3 and 2 respectively
(light wind) and the average temperature was 16°C and 21°C respectively.
Survey for Larvae
3.18
A second stage of surveys for marsh fritillary, which involved looking for larval webs of this species,
was undertaken on 20 August 2014, by Greg Chamberlain MCIEEM, an experienced marsh
fritillary surveyor. The survey followed standard methods derived from the UK Butterfly Monitoring

Scheme (UKBMS)11. The survey involved walking 2-5 m strip width transects across the marshy
grassland within the Waun Garn Wen SINC which encompassed a similar area to the one used in
the surveys for adult marsh fritillary described above. The survey took into account any devil’s bit
scabious plants that had been recorded in the transect area during other surveys. Following the
adult surveys in June, access was no longer available to the northern part of the area surveyed for
adults and the larval surveys were restricted to the southern area, where devil’s bit scabious had
not been recorded. During the June survey no examples of this plant were recorded and no further
surveys were scheduled for marsh fritillary larvae.
Targeted Survey for Moths
3.19
Night-time moth surveys were undertaken twice, on 16 June and 14 August 2014. The first survey
was conducted by Owain Gabb MCIEEM and Matthew Hobbs MCIEEM, both ecologists competent
in moth survey and identification, with the second undertaken by Owain Gabb, with Caitlin McCann
assisting. A single 125W Robinson moth trap (using a mercury vapour bulb) and two 40W heath
traps (using actinic bulbs) were used during both surveys, with the aim of attracting the greatest
number and variety of moths. The traps were positioned on both occasions in habitat areas within
the Survey Site that were expected to give the greatest range of species (see Figure 1 for trap
locations).

Trap M1: the first heath trap was located in an area of dry heath and rush pasture in the west
of the Survey Site;

Trap M2: the Robinson trap was located on a sloping track close to horse-grazed pasture,
woodland, scrub, neutral grassland and ruderal vegetation; and

Trap M3: the second heath trap was located on a track bordered with scrub and neutral
grassland in horse-grazed pasture between two areas of woodland.
3.20
Weather conditions during the survey on 16 June were good with a temperature range of 13-18⁰C,
with no rain and little or no wind. On 13 August, conditions were again good with a temperature
range of 14-18⁰C with a light wind and no rain.
3.21
The lights were switched on approximately 20 minutes before dusk and remained lit until they were
switched off after dawn.  The Robinson trap was powered via mains electricity (and an extension
lead) from a house on site, and the two heath traps by external 12V leisure batteries (and timer
switches).
3.22
The Robinson trap was manned for the first few hours of darkness to capture moths drawn to the
light but not entering the trap, with the other traps visited periodically.  The traps were
systematically emptied, and all moths determined to species level the following morning.
3.23
A number of micro-moths were externally determined / verified by Barry Stewart, one of the three
authors of The Moths of Glamorgan (Gilmore et al., 2014), on the day following each survey.
Targeted Survey of Ponds
3.24
The survey focussed on two of the three ponds present within the Survey Site (Ponds 11 and 16)
(for numbering of ponds please see Figure 1 in the great-crested newt survey report (BSG Ecology,
2014b)). A third pond (Pond 17) was not surveyed as it was thought to be suboptimal for aquatic
invertebrates due to shading, lack of vegetation and very shallow water levels. The survey was
undertaken on 28 July 2014 by Dr Jessica Frame MCIEEM and Rachel Taylor ACIEEM, both
skilled freshwater ecologists.
3.25
Benthic macroinvertebrates were collected at the two ponds using standard 3-minute kick sample
methodology (Biggs et al., 1998) using a 1 mm mesh hand net. One minute of hand searching (of
rocks, logs, leaf packs and other submerged debris) was then carried out in search of invertebrates
(e.g. caddis fly larvae (Trichoptera), pond skaters (Gerrida) and whirligig beetles (Gyrinida) that
might otherwise have been missed during the net sampling.
3.26
Invertebrates were separated from detritus and bed material in the field and preserved immediately
in 70% Industrial Methylated Spirit (IMS) for subsequent laboratory analysis.

3.27
A number of water quality parameters, including pH, dissolved oxygen, conductivity and total
dissolved solids were also recorded at each pond.
3.28
The weather during the survey was warm (18°), dry, with intermittent sun and a light wind. The
location of each of the ponds surveyed is shown in Figure 1.
Targeted Survey of Watercourses
3.29
Surveys of watercourses were carried out on 19 September 2014 by Jim Fairclough and Rachel
Taylor, both skilled freshwater ecologists. The survey techniques used at each sampling point are
described in detail below.
Sample point selection
3.30
To be effective, biological sampling should ideally use watercourses with a range of habitats that
are most likely to yield a diverse invertebrate community sensitive enough to detect changes in
biological water quality. Accordingly, sampling locations included reaches of approximately 10
linear metres, typically centred on a shallow fast-moving section of the stream (riffle), across which
a sample was collected.
Sample collection
3.31
At each sample point, one minute of hand searching (of rocks, logs, leaf packs and other
submerged debris) was carried out in search of invertebrates (e.g. caddis larvae, pond skaters or
whirligigs) that might otherwise have been missed during the subsequent kick sampling.  Three
minutes of kick sampling was then carried out for each sample point.  Pond nets were used for
sampling and these conformed to Environment Agency standards (1 mm mesh and 0.5 m deep).
Care was taken to avoid deep accumulations of soft sediment because this makes sample sorting
extremely difficult.  Similarly, the netting of large volumes of plant material was avoided.
Sample sorting and identification
3.32
The sample was placed into a sorting tray and all invertebrates were placed in a collection jar for
identification in the laboratory. The tray was carefully checked to ensure that no species were
missed. Specimens were stored in 70% methanol solution.  Any necessary species identification
was carried out by a suitably experienced entomologist (Dr Jessica Frame) using a stereoscopic
microscope with the aid of identification literature.
Water Quality Assessment
3.33
Assessment of aquatic invertebrate composition and diversity is recognised as an effective way of
measuring the water quality and habitat quality of wetland habitat. A common method for the
assessment of water quality is the Biological Monitoring Working Party (BMWP) index.  This gives
a score to freshwater habitat based upon the number of families of invertebrates found in a sample.
3.34
The BMWP works on the basic principle that freshwater pollution levels affect invertebrate families
differently.  Thus, certain families that are most susceptible to pollution score maximum points.
These include many families belonging to the mayflies (Ephemeroptera), stoneflies (Plecoptera)
and caddis (Trichoptera).  Conversely, those families tolerant of polluted waters score the fewest
points, and include families such as the leeches (Hirudinea), worms (Oligochaeta), chironomid
midges (Diptera) and the freshwater hog-louse (Isopoda).  Accordingly, cleaner watercourses,
which have higher water quality, score the highest number of points, whilst polluted watercourses
score the lowest.  In the mid-1990s, Walley and Hawkes carried out a computer-based revision of
the BMWP Scoring System, using data from the 1990 River Quality Survey of England and Wales
(Walley and Hawkes, 1996, 1997).  This is thought to be a more objective approach to allocating
BMWP scores which would lead to a more accurate reflection of the impacts of pollution on
invertebrate fauna.  For the purposes of this report the revised scores have been calculated.
3.35
An alternative way of expressing the BMWP score is by measuring the Average Score per Taxon
(ASPT).  This is obtained by dividing the BMWP score by the number of scoring families.  This
score is sometimes preferred to the BMWP score, since it eliminates any discrepancies associated
with ‘recorder effort’.  As with the BMWP score, the higher the ASPT per sample the cleaner the
Abergelli Power Project – Invertebrate Survey Report

watercourse.  The cleanest waters might therefore have an ASPT close to ‘10’, whilst the most
polluted waters lie closer to ‘1’.  In general terms an ASPT greater than the ‘benchline’ mark of ‘5’ is
indicative of a watercourse in reasonable condition. Water quality monitoring can be carried out
using the same scoring index each time and comparing the results.
Laboratory Identification
3.36
All aquatic macroinvertebrate individuals (excluding fly larvae and worms) collected in the field
were identified to species-level under a stereoscopic microscope (up to 70 x magnification) using
the most up-to-date identification keys available. Identification of aquatic macroinvertebrates was
completed by Dr Jessica Frame of BSG Ecology.
Survey Limitations
3.37
It was not possible to access the northern part of the marshy grassland in the north-west of the
Survey Site after July and therefore larval surveys for marsh fritillary were not carried out in this
area. This is the only area that devil’s bit scabious was recorded in the Survey Site and is the only
area where there was potential for marsh fritillary to occur. Since the restrictions to land access
were applied the Project Site has been subsequently refined due to changes in the design of the
Project and the Project Site no longer includes this area.
3.38
No other constraints to the efficacy of the surveys were recorded.

Results
Desk Study
4.1
SEWBReC provided 40 records of Section 42 Lepidoptera species. The species recorded are
marsh fritillary, dingy skipper Erynnis tages, narrow-bordered bee hawk-moth Hemaris tityus and
small pearl-bordered fritillary Boloria selene. Twenty nine of the records are of marsh fritillary; the
closest of these is located approximately 0.7 km west of the Survey Site boundary in 2009. This
location also contains the closest of the four dingy skipper records, as well as the closest of the five
small pearl-bordered fritillary records and the only narrow-bordered bee hawk-moth record. The
results of the Habitat Potential Assessment (below) include a discussion regarding whether suitable
habitats to support any of these species are present within the Survey Site.
Habitat Potential Assessment
4.2
The results of the desk study were taken into account to assess whether there is suitable habitat
for the Lepidoptera species within 2 km of the Survey Site and whether further survey for any of
these species was justified. The marshy grassland in the north-west of the Survey Site provides
broadly suitable habitat for marsh fritillary (see 3.14), although the food plant devil’s-bit scabious
was only noted in small patches in M25 grassland during the NVC survey (see Figure 1).  Of the
other Section 42 species recorded from the desk study, suitable habitat is present for narrow-
bordered bee hawk-moth, which also largely relies on devil’s bit scabious. The methods employed
during the marsh fritillary transect surveys (see 3.1.5) included recording of day-flying moths such
as this species. For dingy skipper, there are few areas of bare ground, where this species prefers
to bask and no areas where it’s usual egg-laying food plant, bird’s foot trefoil Lotus corniculatus, is
found in any quantity. Small pearl-bordered fritillary is reliant on violets (Viola sp.) as its egg-laying
plant, and violets have not been recorded during the PEA (the April survey was timed to record
them in flower).  It is unlikely that either of these latter two species are present within the Survey
Site.
4.3
Much of the Survey Site is pastoral farmland. The fields are grazed by horses and sheep, and are
largely bounded by fences with occasional trees, scrub and defunct hedgerows. These areas were
discounted from further study on the basis of the habitat being of poor suitability for invertebrates.
Only common and widespread species might be expected to occur in association with such habitat.
4.4
Away from these areas, there are four key habitats that have the potential to be important for
assemblages of invertebrates, including those that are rare, scarce or nationally threatened. These
are:

The area of marshy grassland in the north-west of the Survey Site, which contains a mosaic of
habitats, including M25 grassland, that has the potential to support marsh fritillary;

Several areas of woodland within the Survey Site, most of which are included on the Ancient
Woodland Inventory for Wales and are also SINCs;

Numerous watercourses on site, mostly in the form of ditches along field boundaries, and also
four streams; and

The two ponds (Ponds 11 and 16) within the Survey Site.
4.5
These habitats formed the main focus of the targeted surveys and are described below.
Marshy grassland
4.6
Most areas of marshy grassland within the Survey Site were degraded due to grazing pressure and
were not identified as providing potentially high quality habitat for invertebrates. However, the
marshy grassland habitat in the north-west of the Survey Site forms part of the Waun Garn Wen
SINC and is of higher quality.
4.7
This area was composed of mire (dominated by purple moor grass Molinia caerulea) to the north,
with wet heath to the south and rush pasture around the margins. The northern area was
characterised by the dominance of purple moor grass, which distinguishes it from the rush pasture

described below.  Other species were limited in number and abundance.  Soft rush Juncus effusus
and sharp-flowered rush Juncus acutiflorus can be frequent, but tormentil Potentilla erecta is the
only broad-leaved species that occurred regularly. Other potential food and nectar plants for
invertebrates included cross-leaved heath Erica tetralix, bilberry Vaccinium myrtillus, devil’s-bit
scabious, marsh bedstraw Galium palustre, greater bird’s-foot trefoil and wild angelica Angelica
sylvestris.
4.8
The southern area was largely wet heath, characterised by a mixture of varying quantities of purple
moor-grass, deer grass Trichophorum cespitosum, cross-leaved heath and heather Calluna
vulgaris. Other species included wavy hair grass Deschampsia flexuosa, small amounts of hare’s-
tail cotton grass Eriophorum vaginatum, heath milkwort Polygala serpyllifolia and marsh lousewort
Pedicularis palustris.
4.9
Around the fringes of this area there were pockets of rush pasture, which were defined by the
presence of an abundance of soft rush and/or sharp-flowered rush amongst mesophytic herbs
widely occurring in moister agricultural grasslands. This was not a species-rich habitat, but other
species present included marsh bedstraw and marsh thistle Cirsium palustre, ragged robin Lychnis
flos-cuculi, bulrush Typha latifolium, and lesser spearwort Ranunculus flammula. Species more
typical of scrubby margins were also present, including bramble Rubus fruticosus agg., rosebay
willowherb Chamerion angustifolium, great willowherb Epilobium hirsutum and hemp agrimony
Eupatorium cannabinum.
4.10
This area was also crossed by wet ditches and contained areas of young woodland and small trees
scattered around the edges of the habitat mosaic. It formed part of a much larger area of similar
habitats (mostly contained within the Waun Garn Wen SINC) that extend to the west.
4.11
This combination of habitats may provide an important reservoir for invertebrates within the wider
landscape, where it is intensively farmed. The grassland habitat is complemented by ruderal
vegetation, stands of bracken Pteridium aquilinum, wet ditches, trees and scrub; the combination of
which should provide complex transitional zones that are often rich in invertebrates, due to the
structural diversity they create and the variety of foraging opportunities they provide. The added
height and often permanency of features such as grass and sedge tussocks, scrub and trees offers
important refuges for invertebrates especially during winter when penetrating frosts may otherwise
have adverse consequences.
Woodland
4.12
There were several areas of woodland within the Survey Site. There was a block of broadleaved
woodland along the eastern boundary of the Survey Site (Woodland 4; Figure 1).  The western end
being on a hill, and is dry with widely-spaced trees and a grazed grassland ground flora including
common grassland species. The trees here were small to medium-stemmed with very little
understorey, and included: silver birch Betula pendula, crab-apple Malus sylvestris, holly Ilex
aquifolium and pedunculate oak Quercus robur. Dead wood and bracket fungi were also present,
which can provide suitable habitat for a range of saproxylic invertebrates. The hill slopes down
steeply to the east, where a stream delineates a lower, wetter area of woodland.  Here the tree
species composition was similar but the understorey was more dense, with bramble predominating.
There were also extensive areas of ground flora that were dominated by purple moor-grass with
Sphagnum moss species also present.
4.13
Another relatively extensive area of broad-leaved woodland was present at the south-west end of
the Survey Site around Felindre Gas Compressor Station and the two National Grid 400kV
electrical substations (Woodland 1; Figure 1).  This formed a strip to the south and a more
continuous block to the north of Felindre Gas Compressor Station and the two National Grid 400kV
electrical substations. The woodland was generally quite wet, with alder Alnus glutinous and willow
species Salix spp. frequent along with pedunculate oak, birch and holly.  The trees were growing
close together and were generally small-stemmed and straggly.  The understorey was comprised
of dense bramble, whilst the ground flora was largely absent. Where the woodland opened out, for
example around the margins of Felindre Gas Compressor Station and the two National Grid 400kV
electrical substations, soft-rush dominated marshy grassland was present. This woodland is listed
as ancient woodland but lacks most features of ancient woodland habitat, including significant dead
wood and diverse understorey layers that would be suitable for supporting a diverse invertebrate
fauna. To the north, Woodland 2 (Figure 1) was dominated by semi-mature oak, alder, willow and
birch with a thick bramble understorey.
Abergelli Power Project – Invertebrate Survey Report
12
20/11/2014
4.14
There were also patches of deciduous woodland around the edges of the marshy grassland on the
block of land to the west of the road that runs through the Survey Site (Woodland 3). Tree species
were largely immature and included oak, birch, holly, hawthorn Crataegus monogyna and an
understorey dominated by bramble, but also including ivy Hedera helix, creeping bent Agrostis
stolonifera, Yorkshire fog Holcus lanatus, soft rush, hard fern Blechnum spicant, scaly male fern
Dryopteris affinis and bracken.  The ground flora included nettle Urtica dioica, lady fern Athyrium
filix-femina, wood false brome Brachypodium sylvaticum and abundant Himalayan balsam
Impatiens glandulifera. There was some dead wood present in this area of woodland but it lacked
features characteristic of ancient woodland habitat that would be suitable for supporting a diverse
invertebrate fauna.
Watercourses
4.15
There were numerous small water courses within the Survey Site.  These were mostly ditches
along field boundaries, but there were also some larger streams. The block of marshy grassland to
the west was criss-crossed by numerous ditches, which were largely dry or with marshy bases
when visited in April. There was also a stream that flowed through this block of land – this was
shaded by flanking woodland, with a stone bed and shallow banks. These were all deemed
unsuitable for survey at the time of watercourse sampling in September.
4.16
Another stream flowed south-east through the Survey Site and was split into smaller tributaries
through Woodland 4 (See Figures 1 and 2). It was overgrown with scrub in many places and was
shallow and fast-flowing with riffles and pools along its uniform bank structure and stony bed. This
stream exhibited local detritus but there was no sewage present. No macrophyte cover was found
and in the most heavily shaded sample point (See Figure 2; Sample Point 3) a brown trout Salmo
trutta (parr) was caught during a standard kick sample.
4.17
Another larger stream flowed along the eastern boundary of the Survey Site.  This was relatively
unshaded, with a bed of mud, gravel and rocks. The upstream portion of this watercourse was
approximately 1.5 m in width and the water depth ranged from approximately 10 cm to 20 cm
where pools formed.
It was fast flowing and appeared to be clean as there was no turbidity,
detritus or sewage. Another brown trout (parr) was caught during kick sampling at Sample Point 1
(See Figure 2). Further downstream where two additional kick samples were taken (Sample Points
5 & 6), the stream widened and formed a wide pool at Sample Point 6. The stream had moderate
shade and slight turbidity, was surrounded by scrub and trees and had a substrate of pebbles,
sand and silt.
4.18
There were also small watercourses present around the margin of Felindre Gas Compressor
Station and the two National Grid 400kV electrical substations. These streams were on average 0.5
m wide and 0.3 m deep with the average bank height being 0.4 m. The first stretch sampled
(Sample Point 7) was heavily impinged upon by bank vegetation, mostly scrub that covered the
majority of its length (see Image 14). The flow in this watercourse was low both upstream and
downstream with only riffles over a substrate of gravel and silt. Pastoral land sits on either side of
both streams.
4.19
All features that were visited in February had flowing water, reflecting a period of prolonged wet
weather preceding the survey. This was not the case when sampling took place in September.
Aquatic vegetation was not apparent in any of the watercourses, but marginal vegetation included
frequent soft rush, occasional purple moor-grass and scattered gorse Ulex europaeus and
bramble.
4.20
Watercourses can support rich and varied assemblages of invertebrates adapted to highly
specialised niches across the reach of a watercourse.  Taxonomic orders including Ephemeroptera
(mayflies), Plecoptera (stoneflies), Trichoptera (caddisflies), Odonata (dragonflies), Diptera (true
flies) and aquatic Coleoptera tend to be well represented in such habitats, especially where water
quality appears to be unimpaired.
Ponds
4.21
Although neither Pond 11 nor 16 forms part of a wider cluster of ponds or other waterbodies, both
were located in good quality habitat, either surrounded by marshy grassland and scrub (Pond 11)
or between woodland and neutral grassland (Pond 16). There is likely to be a wide range of
Abergelli Power Project – Invertebrate Survey Report
13

species potentially associated with such ponds, including (but not limited to): snails (Gastropoda),
diving beetles (Dytiscidae), water beetles (Hydrophilidae), dragonflies and caddisflies.
Targeted Surveys
4.22
Overall, a total of 384 species were recorded during the targeted invertebrate surveys, the results
of which are fully described in the following sections.
Coleoptera
4.23
From the first survey 150 specimens were examined and 95 invertebrate species were identified.
Coleoptera was the dominant order recorded with 70 species recorded, reflecting the search
emphasis, with Hemiptera making up the majority of other records. Hemiptera were taken more as
incidental material and have been included for completeness.
During the second survey, 71
species were recorded. Coleoptera was the dominant order recorded with 46 species (four of which
were also recorded during the first survey), with Hemiptera well represented at 13 species and a
small number of incidental records, such as millipedes, making up the rest. The full list of
Coleoptera species recorded within the four woodlands surveyed is displayed in tabular format in
Appendix 2.
4.24
The four woodlands produced 19 saproxylic species from the first survey with one more species
added from the second survey visit. These species are all included in the general list of Alexander
(2004) with none indicative of continuous saproxylic habitat, which may be taken as an indicator of
the quality of ancient woodland habitat.
4.25
Combining results for the two sample sets results in a list of 150 species, 75% of which are in the
target order, Coleoptera. A total of 20 saproxylic species were recorded, representing 2.8% of the
700 species regarded as saproxylic by Alexander (2004).
4.26
The results of the survey were analysed by measuring the number of locally rare, nationally notable
and IUCN red list / RDB species.
4.27
Overall, the majority of the insects recorded are widely distributed and common, with 15 regarded
as more local, and two of notable status. These notable species are discussed further in Table 1
below.

Marsh Fritillary
Survey for Adult Butterflies
4.28
Seven butterfly and two day-flying moth species were observed during the transect surveys. Marsh
fritillary was not recorded. A summary of the transect survey results are shown in Table 2 below

4.29
The diversity of butterfly species is typical for a site of this type and location. The numbers of
butterflies recorded were low with the large majority recorded in a narrow strip of flower-rich habitat
in the southernmost part of the area that was surveyed. In general, a lack of flowering nectar-rich
plants during the surveys is likely to have led to the low abundance of butterflies recorded. The
species recorded are generally considered to be common and widespread across south Wales.
4.30
Small heath is the only species recorded that is a S42 species. Although widespread and common
and found in a fairly wide variety of habitats with its main food plants being grasses
(particularly Bents (various) (Agrostis spp.), Fescues (various) (Festuca spp.) and Meadow-grasses
(various) (Poa spp.)), this species has undergone a 10 year decline of 28% (Butterfly Conservation,
2011). None of the S42 butterfly or day-flying moth species recorded from the desk study were
recorded during the surveys.
Incidental sightings
4.31
In addition to the Lepidoptera species recorded above, seven green hairstreak Callophrys rubric
butterflies were recorded while deploying reptile refugia on 16 May in the transect survey area. This
species, although widespread, is relatively localised in distribution in Britain.
Survey for Larvae
4.32
No devil’s bit scabious plants were recorded during the first survey, and therefore a second survey
was not carried out (see 3.18). Marsh fritillary larvae are considered to be absent from the area in
which the survey was carried out.
Moths
4.33
The night-time surveys produced 118 taxa of moth in total (see Appendix 3).
4.34
The macro moth fauna of Glamorgan is well recorded, with hectads12 in Swansea and the Gower
Peninsula being very well covered in a vice-county13 context. Micro Lepidoptera are notably under
recorded, however, which makes robust assessment of apparent abundance based on the number
of records and/or their geographical spread within the vice-county impossible for many species
(Gilmore et al., 2014).
4.35
Gilmore et al. (2014) provide a detailed summary of the number of records, by species, for all
moths in Glamorgan.  For macro moths, the authors attribute an assessment of abundance (very
rare, rare, scarce, uncommon, common etc.) based on the number of records, qualified by further
12 A 10 km x 10 km square often used for biological recording.
13 A vice-county is a geographical division of the British Isles used for the purposes of biological recording
and other scientific data-gathering. Glamorgan contains a single vice-county (number 41), which is split into
a number of hectads, that sub-divide the vice-county into smaller recording units.

information with regard to how widespread the species is based on the number of hectads it has
occurred in.
4.36
None of the macro moths recorded on the Survey Site was less frequent than ‘very local’, at the
vice-county level.  The most notable species were map-winged swift Hepialus fusconebulosa, and
marbled brown Drymonia dodonaea. Prior to the survey, map-winged swift had been recorded on
200 previous occasions in the vice-county, and in 25 of the 40 10 km hectads that fall within
Glamorgan.  Marbled brown had occurred on 186 previous occasions and in 17 hectads: it is a very
localised species in Glamorgan which only occurs regularly on the Gower Peninsula and in
northern districts of the vice-county.  It is associated with native oak species.
4.37
There was one locally notable micro moth species, the grass veneer Crambus uliginosellus.  This is
a localised species of damp grassland, bogs and fens.  It was recorded at the heath trap in the
area of marshy grassland in the north-west of the Survey Site (M1).  Gilmore et al. (2014) state that
there have been 15 previous records of this species at the vice-county level, and that the species
has been noted in six hectads on Gower and at Crymlyn Bog.
4.38
Thirteen moth species collected were noteworthy due to their status as S42 species. Table 3,

This species has become scarce in eastern Glamorgan,
but remains common in the south and west, particularly
on the coast (Gilmore et al., 2014).  Waring & Townsend
(2003) indicate that the species could be being affected
by both the general ‘tidying up’ of the countryside and
climatic change.

Waring & Townsend (2003) state that this species is
common and well distributed in West Wales (much of
England and Southern Scotland).  Gilmore et al. (2014)
indicate that it is common and widespread in southern
Glamorgan.

Waring & Townsend (2003) state that this species is
common throughout Great Britain, being most abundant
on heather moorland.  Gilmore et al (2014) note that the
moth is frequently encountered in all parts of the vice-
county other than the Vale of Glamorgan.  Locally, the
favoured larval food plant is bracken.

Timandra comae
S42: Decline of

According to Waring & Townsend (2003), this species is
common across England and Wales. The moth is
associated with a variety of herbaceous plants, but
docks in particular, so it would have been well suited to
the field margins and woodland within the Survey Site.
Gilmore et al. (2014) state that it is common throughout
Glamorgan.
Cinnabar
Tyria
jacobaeae
S42: Decline of
83%

Waring & Townsend (2003) state that this species is
common across England and Wales, and Gilmore et al.
(2014) confirm that this remains its status in Glamorgan.
The moth is almost exclusively associated with common
ragwort Jacobaea vulgaris and there are some small
patches of this plant within the Survey Site, many of
which hold larvae of this species.

moth 
agg.
Amphipoea
oculea
S42:
Declined

research
needed (JNCC,
2010)
There are four species of ear moth that could account
for the records.  These can only be distinguished based
on dissection of genitalia.  All have a localised
distribution, and even the commonest
Amphipoea
oculea typically occurs at low density in the UK.
Amphipoea crinanensis has not been recorded in the
vice-county to date.
The three ear moths that have been recorded in
Glamorgan are all either uncommon or rare in the
county.  However their relative abundance (in relation to
each other) is currently unknown (Gilmore et al., 2014).
Based on the habitat present, and the altitude of the site
however, the records are most likely to refer to
Amphipoea oculea as opposed to A. fucosa paludis or A.
lucens. A. oculea is considered an uncommon but
widespread resident in the county.
Small 
phoenix
Ecliptopera
silaceata
S42:

Waring & Townsend (2003) state that this species is
common throughout mainland Britain, the Inner Hebrides
and Ireland.
Gilmore et al. (2014) state that it is a
common, widespread resident in Glamorgan, and found
in a range of habitats.
Dusky

Ennomos
fuscantaria
S42:

A common resident that is fairly generally distributed and
often frequent in England and Wales.  It occurs
wherever the foodplant, ash Fraxinus excelsior is found
(Waring & Townsend, 2003).
In Glamorgan the species is found throughout southern
areas, but is more localised in northern districts.
Rosy 
rusticI
Hydraecia
micacea
S42: 
Declined

Occurs in a wide range of habitats including gardens,
waste ground, pasture, fens, marshes and woodland
rides.  It is common and well distributed in Britain and
Ireland (Waring & Townsend, 2003).
It is a common, widespread resident in Glamorgan
(Gilmore et al., 2014)

This waterbody covered an area of
approximately 25 m2 with an average depth
of over 0.75 m and a maximum depth of
over 1 m. The aquatic plant community
was dominated by water horsetail
Equisetum fluviatile with patches of broad-
leaved pondweed present. The highly
invasive floating pennywort Hydrocotyle
ranunculoides was also present at the
northern end of the pond.
pH: 6.70
Temp: 18.61°C
Conductivity: 103 µS/cm
TDS: 52 mg/L
DO: 10% (1.10 mg/L)
* TDS = total dissolved solids; DO = dissolved oxygen

Forty eight different species were recorded during the pond survey. Pond 11 supported the highest
diversity of aquatic macroinvertebrates, with total of 46 taxa recorded.  Pond 16 supported a more
moderate diversity of 32 taxa. The samples were generally dominated by beetles (21 unique taxa),
followed by bugs (11 unique taxa). No scarce or threatened aquatic invertebrates were identified
within the samples. A complete list of all the macroinvertebrate taxa recorded at each of the ponds
can be found in Appendix 5.

The samples were analysed to at least family level as required to obtain a BMWP/ASPT score for
the stream sections sampled; where possible species were also recorded for completeness and so
that any rare species collected would be identified. The BMWP/ASPT score is then given a quality
rating (Table 6 below). The scores and ratings calculated for the sample points are recorded in
Table 7 (below), and a complete macroinvertebrate taxa list is provided in Appendix 5, Table 2.

The scores for the spring-fed stream (Sampling points 2-4) improve with each step downstream,
but water quality was generally good. There is an increase in distance from the edge of the stream
to the pastoral fields further downstream, from no buffer to a 10 m buffer with trees and scrub. This
Abergelli Power Project – Invertebrate Survey Report

may be a reason for the improving scores, as there is less risk of sediment deposition / spray drift
from adjacent fields when a buffer is present.

Executive Summary
1.1.1
AECOM were commissioned to undertake Great Crested Newt Surveys on ponds
identified as suitable to support GCN within the Project Site and within 500 m of the
Project Site. The Project Site is approximately 30.66 ha and located near to the
village of Felindre, Swansea.
1.1.2
The Abergelli Power Project development proposals are for a proposed 299MW
Open Cycle Gas Turbine power station.
1.1.3
The Abergelli Power Project comprises the following principal elements:
·
A new Power Generation Plant;
·
A new integral Electrical Connection; and,
·
A new integral Gas Connection.
1.1.4
The Power Generation Plant, Gas Connection and Electrical Connection together
are referred to as the Project.
1.1.5
The Project will require the partial removal of terrestrial and aquatic habitat suitable
to support GCN.
1.1.6
It is understood that construction is programmed to commence no sooner than
2020/2021
1.1.7
The GCN is protected under European law through Annexes II and IV of the EC
Habitats Directive (Council Directive 92/43/EEC). Protection is given to all life
stages (e.g. adults, sub-adults, larvae, and eggs). This is implemented into UK law
under section 41 of the Conservation of Habitats and Species Regulations, 2010
where it is listed as a European protected species under Schedule 2. GCN is an
Environment (Wales) Act 2016 Section 7 Priority Species.
1.1.8
A total of 26 ponds were identified within proximity of the Project Site.
1.1.9
A Habitat Suitability Index (HIS) Assessment was undertaken an all ponds within
500m of the Site and ponds outside of the 500 m but clustered with ponds within
the 500m of the Project Site boundary. Further surveys were undertaken, where
appropriate, following the results of the HSI Assessment.

1.1.10 Following the HSI Assessment, off the 26 ponds identified, two were classed as
poor (a further survey was undertaken on one of these) nine were dry and seven
were not accessible and therefore could not be surveyed. A combination of manual
and eDNA surveys were undertaken on nine ponds.
1.1.11 No great crested newts were identified during the manual surveys and the eDNA
surveys undertaken were all returned with a negative result. The manual surveys
ceased once the results of the eDNA surveys had been received. Common
amphibians were identified during the surveys.
1.1.12 Of the seven ponds that were not accessible. These are considered unlikely to
support great crested newts given the lack of GCN records from the local records
centre and the absence of GCN identified in other ponds during the surveys
1.1.13 No further surveys for great crested newts are required and there will be no impact
on great crested newts as part of the Project.
1.1.14 The Project will require the removal of three ponds (Ponds 16, 22 and 23). Pond 22
currently supports palmate newts and is likely to support other amphibians
including frogs and toads as well as a range of generalist aquatic invertebrates.
Pond 16 was dry. Pond 23 could not be assessed but if it contains water has the
potential to support generalist aquatic invertebrates and common amphibians.
1.1.15 Where the scheme design allows, ponds, swales or water bodies, should be
considered to mitigate the loss of the ponds and enhance the Site for common
amphibians.
1.1.16 Log piles and hibernacula could be created in suitable areas of habitat (such as
grassland and scrub/woodland edges), to enhance the area for amphibians.

Introduction
2.1.1
AECOM were commissioned to undertake Great Crested Newt (GCN) Surveys on
ponds identified as suitable to support GCN within the Abergelli site and within
proximity of the Abergelli site (hereafter referred to as the ‘Project Site’). An Habitat
Suitability Index (HSI) Assessment was undertaken an all ponds, where access
allowed, within 500 m of the Site and ponds outside of the 500m but clustered with
ponds within the 500 m of the Project Site boundary. Further surveys were
undertaken following the HSI Assessment.
2.2
The Project
2.2.1
The Project Site is located near to the village of Felindre, Swansea, as shown in
Figure 1.1, and the central grid reference for the Project Site is SN65280143. A full
description of the development is provided in Chapter 3: Project and Site
Description of the ES.

Great Crested Newt Ecology
2.3.1
GCNs are one of the two European Protected Species of amphibian found in the
UK.
2.3.2
GCNs, like all British amphibians, rely on water bodies for breeding but otherwise
spend much of their lives on land. They are ectotherms and have permeable skins,
so most movement occurs when the air temperature is above approximately 5ºC
and there is, or has recently been rain.
2.3.3
Adults and immature newts spend the winter in places where they will be protected
from frost and flooding. Whilst on land outside of the hibernation period, GCNs will
also take refuge to shelter from extremes of weather; hence during the day they will
often rest in dense vegetation, under refuges or underground. Adult GCNs normally
begin moving from their over-wintering land sites between February and April, with
some adult newts not reaching the desired water body until May, but this is very
weather dependant. Not all life-stages enter water over the course of a year;
immature newts (or efts) may spend all year on land until they reach breeding
condition.
2.3.4
Upon reaching the pond, the peak courtship and egg-laying period is normally from
mid-March to mid-May. The larvae hatch out after about three weeks, and then take
another two to three months to complete larval development. The larvae emerge
from the pond upon completion of metamorphosis and enter the eft land stage. This
move usually begins in early August and lasts for about two months. Adult newts
generally leave the breeding ponds from late May onwards, a movement which
occurs gradually with most newts having left by August but some staying until
October or even remaining over winter.

2.3.5
GCNs in a given area often form a metapopulation (a series of sub-populations that
are linked by dispersal of individuals). Newt populations function in this way since
they depend on habitats which vary in quality over time, and where the distribution
of suitable habitats often changes. This metapopulation concept complicates the
study and conservation of this species, since impacts to a single pond may have
knock-on effects on newts in nearby ponds. GCNs commonly move between ponds
that are up to 250 m from each other but are known to range up to 500 m from
breeding ponds in some cases.
2.3.6
English Nature (Ref. 1) lists the following pond characteristics as being favourable
for GCN populations:
·
Surface area between 100 and 300 m2;
·
Variable depth, but preferably not so deep that aquatic and emergent
vegetation is unable to take root. A maximum depth around 4 m is acceptable;
·
Substantial cover of submerged and marginal vegetation;
·
Open areas to facilitate courtship behaviour;
·
Good populations of invertebrates and other amphibians as prey;
·
Ponds in clusters rather than in isolation;
·
Absence of shading on the south side;
·
Absence of fish; and
·
Absence of waterfowl.
2.4
Great Crested Newt Legislation
2.4.1
The GCN is protected under European law through Annexes II and IV of the EC
Habitats Directive (Council Directive 92/43/EEC). Protection is given to all life
stages (e.g. adults, sub-adults, larvae, and eggs). This is implemented into UK law
under section 41 of the Conservation of Habitats and Species Regulations, 2010
where it is listed as a European protected species under Schedule 2, which in
summary makes it an offence to:
·
Deliberately take (capture), injure or kill a GCN. (In a court, 'deliberately' would
probably be interpreted as someone who, although not intending to take, injure
or kill a GCN, performed the relevant action, being sufficiently informed and
aware of the consequence his/her action will most likely have.);
·
Deliberately disturb a GCN in a way that would affect its ability to survive, breed
or rear young, hibernate or migrate or significantly affect the local distribution or
abundance of the species;
·
Damage or destroy a breeding site or resting place of a GCN;
·
Possess or control any live or dead specimen or anything derived from a GCN;
and,
·
Intentionally take or destroy the eggs of a GCN.
2.4.2
The GCN is also given full protection under Section 9 of the Wildlife and
Countryside Act 1981 (as amended) through its inclusion on Schedule 5. In
summary, the legislation makes it an offence to:
·
Intentionally or recklessly take (capture), injure or kill a GCN;
·
Intentionally or recklessly disturb a GCN;
Abergelli ES 2018 – GREAT CRESTED NEWT SURVEY REPORT
Prepared for: Abergelli Power Limited
AECOM
8
·
Intentionally or recklessly damage or destroy, or obstruct access to, any
structure or place which a GCN uses for shelter or protection or intentionally or
recklessly disturb a GCN while it uses such a place; and,
·
Possess or advertise/sell/exchange a GCN (dead or alive) or any part of a
GCN.
2.4.3
The inclusion of this species on Annex II of the Habitats Directive also means that a
Special Area of Conservation (SAC) can be designated as a protected area due to
a significant presence of this species.
2.4.4
The Natural Environment and Rural Communities (NERC) Act (2006), as amended,
puts an obligation on public bodies to have regard, so far as is consistent with the
proper exercise of their functions, to the purpose of conserving biodiversity. Under
the terms of the Act, conserving biodiversity includes restoring or enhancing
populations and/or habitats. The local planning authority (LPA) or other determining
authority must therefore consider the effects of planning applications upon
biodiversity and how it can be mitigated for or enhanced.
2.4.5
In addition, Government Circular ODPM 06/2005: “Biodiversity and Geological
Conservation – Statutory Obligations and their Impact within the Planning System”
sets out further detail on how species and habitats should be considered during
planning applications.
2.4.6
GCN is an Environment (Wales) Act 2016 Section 7 Priority Species. These are the
species found in Wales which were identified as requiring action under the UK BAP
and which continue to be regarded as conservation priorities under the UK Post-
2010 Biodiversity Framework. As such, it is targeted for measures necessary to
support its conservation status in the UK.
2.5
Quality Assurance
2.5.1
The surveys and subsequent report was undertaken in line with AECOM’s
Integrated Management System (IMS). Our IMS places great emphasis on
professionalism, technical excellence, quality, environmental and Health and Safety
management. All staff members are committed to establishing and maintaining our
certification to the international standards BS EN ISO 9001:2008 and 14001:2004
and BS OHSAS 18001:2007. In addition our IMS requires careful selection and
monitoring of the performance of all sub consultants and contractors.
2.5.2
All AECOM Ecologists who led surveys and completed the reporting for this project
are members of (at the appropriate level) the Chartered Institute of Ecology and
Environmental Management (CIEEM) and all follow their code of professional
conduct (CIEEM, 2013) when undertaking ecological work.

Methodology
3.1
Desk Study
3.1.1
A full desk study was not undertaken to establish the number of ponds within the
Project Site and within 500 m of the Project Site as the client provided AECOM with
the location and number of ponds identified by WSP/PB in March 2017 (Appendix
8.17).
Previous Surveys
3.1.2
The client provided AECOM with a copy of GCN surveys undertaken at the Project
Site by BSG Ecology in 2014 (ES Appendix 8.17).
3.2
Habitat Suitability Assessment
3.2.1
The client provided AECOM with a list of 23 ponds, 19 of these had been subject to
a HSI assessment undertaken by WSP/PB in March 2017. Where access allowed,
these ponds were visited by AECOM in May 2017 to check the assessment score.
3.2.2
HSI is a tool used to assess the likelihood that a water body will support GCN. It
incorporates ten suitability indices (SI), all of which are factors thought to affect the
suitability of a water body to support GCN, such as the quality of the water and the
presence / absence of different predators (particularly fish and waterfowl). Each
variable is assessed separately and then mathematically combined to provide a
numerical index, between 0 and 1 (Ref. 3). The HSI Categorisations is described in
Table 3-1 below.
3.2.3
The following equation is used (Ref. 3):
HSI = (SI1*SI2*SI3*SI4*SI5*SI6*SI7*SI8*SI9*SI10).

3.3
Manual Surveys
3.3.1
Manual GCN surveys were undertaken on ponds (where access allowed) with a
score of below average or above.  GCN surveys were undertaken paying due
regard to Natural England’s Great Crested Newt Standing Advice (Ref. 3) and
Froglife’s Great Crested Newt Conservation Handbook (Ref. 1). GCN Surveys were
undertaken by an appropriately licenced ecologist and in suitable weather
conditions. Manual surveys ceased once a negative eDNA sampling result had
been received. The manual surveys that were undertaken were carried out within
the Natural Resources Wales (NRW) approved survey season window.
3.3.2
Four GCN manual survey visits are required to establish GCN presence/ absence
within the period mid-March to mid-June (with at least two surveys during mid-April
to mid-May). An additional two surveys (six in total) are required to estimate GCN
population. Three out of five survey techniques are required on each of the ponds
surveyed. A combination of four survey techniques were utilised as appropriate.
Torchlight searching, bottle trapping, egg searching and netting. All manual survey
methods were undertaken by at least one NRW GCN licence holder. A description
of the survey techniques used is as follows:
a)
Torching
3.3.3
The water body was thoroughly searched using torch light between dusk and
midnight. The surveyor walked slowly around the perimeter of the water body once
(where access was possible), checking for newts in the torch beam every 2 – 3 m,
paying particular attention to marginal vegetation and potential display areas on the
pond bottom. Care was taken with the torch to minimise disturbance to the newts
and other wildlife which may have been present (e.g. nesting birds). To allow
comparison between ponds, the same power of torch (between 100,000 –
1,000,000 candlepower) was used on every occasion.
b)
Bottle Trapping
3.3.4
Bottle traps were set around the margin of the water body in the evening and left
overnight to catch adults during the breeding season. Traps were set at an
appropriate density of one trap per two metres of shoreline dependent upon
individual site variations. The guidelines set out by Natural England, Froglife, and
the Herpetofauna Workers Manual was followed strictly to ensure the welfare of
trapped newts and other aquatic organisms.
c)
Egg Searching
3.3.5
Submerged and floating aquatic vegetation was checked by the surveyor in order
to locate great crested newt eggs. Egg searches are terminated when presence of
great crested newt eggs is confirmed. This method is unreliable for population
estimates. Terminated egg searches where great crested newt eggs have been
identified avoids excess damage to the eggs by minimising impacts of predation
and UV light.

AECOM
11
d)
Netting
3.3.6
A sturdy dip-net with a 2 – 4 mm mesh was used for netting for fifteen minutes per
50m of pond shoreline.
3.4
eDNA Sampling
3.4.1
eDNA sampling was undertaken following the methodologies provided in Biggs et al
(Ref. 5). eDNA kits were purchased from SureScreen. Water sampling was
undertaken by at least one NRW GCN licenced surveyor per pond. Water samples
were taken from 20 locations around each pond as described in the instructions
provided by SureScreen and in Ref. 5. Samples were stored in accordance with the
instructions provided by SureScreen and returned to SureScreen for analysis. Care
was taken at all steps in the procedure to avoid contamination of samples.
3.4.2
The following NRW GCN licenced surveyors were used to undertake the manual
and eDNA surveys:
3.4.3
Clare Morgans GradCIEEM, Ben Walsh ACIEEM and Jack Muskett GradCIEEM.
3.5
Limitations
a)
Pond Access
3.5.1
Of the 26 ponds identified, seven were not accessible. Six of these were not
accessible due to land access restrictions (Ponds 12-14, 18, 23 and 24) and one
was surrounded by a large, tall area of dense bramble vegetation (Pond 10) and
therefore could not be surveyed. (see Section 4.1.2, Table 4-1).
3.5.2
Ponds 12-14 and 18 are located close to each other approximately 400-500 m east
of the Project Site boundary. There is the possibility that these ponds may support
GCN, although this is considered unlikely given the lack of GCN records from the
local records centre and the absence of GCN identified in other ponds during the
surveys.
3.5.3
Pond 10 is not considered likely to support GCN. It has previously been surveyed
and no evidence of GCN was found (ES Appendix 8.17). No records of GCN were
returned from the local records centre. Ponds 9 and 21 which are within close
proximity were deemed not suitable to support GCN and no evidence of GCN was
found in Pond 19a.
3.5.4
Pond 23 is not considered likely to support GCN given the lack of GCN records
from the local records centre and the absence of GCN in other ponds within a 500
m radius.
3.5.5
Pond 24 is located to the west of the Project Site and may support GCN, although
this is considered unlikely given the lack of GCN records from the local records
centre and the absence of GCN identified in other ponds during the surveys.
b)
Manual Surveys

AECOM
12
3.5.6
The three required manual survey methods were not undertaken on Ponds 1b, 4,
11 and 19b (see Section 4.1.2, Table 4-1 and Section 4.2, Table 4-4) due to a
combination of health and safety issues and dense vegetation.
3.5.7
Ponds 1b and 4 are within a cluster of ponds to the north west of the Project Site.
No evidence of GCN was identified for Pond 7 and Pond 8 which is within this
cluster of ponds and therefore the manual survey limitation is not deemed
significant.
3.5.8
Pond 11 has previously been surveyed and no evidence of GCN was found (ES
Appendix 8.17). Therefore the manual survey limitation is not deemed significant.
3.5.9
On the first survey visit to Pond 19b, the water level had dropped making it
impossible to bottle trap. Torching was attempted but not possible due to the low
water level and vegetation cover. Egg searching was not possible as the access
was restricted to the vegetation due to deep soft mud. Pond 19b is connected to
Pond 19a. Pond 19a was deemed poor as part of the HSI assessment. However,
due to the limitation to the surveys on Pond 19b, manual surveys and an eDNA
survey were undertaken on Pond 19a. No evidence of GCN was returned for Pond
19a and therefore the manual survey limitation on Pond 19b is not deemed
significant.
3.5.10 Manual surveys were not undertaken on Pond 17, as AECOM did not gain land
access permission to the pond within the required survey season time. However,
once granted it was possible to eDNA sample Pond 17 within the approved survey
season window.
3.5.11 A summary of the manual survey and eDNA limitations is given in Table 3-2.
c)
eDNA Sampling
3.5.12 eDNA surveys were undertaken on all ponds, where access allowed, of below
average category and above, with the exception of Ponds 19a and 19b. On the first
manual survey visit to Pond 19b, the water level had dropped and deep soft mud
was exposed on the edges making it unsuitable for eDNA sampling.  As Pond 19b
is connected to Pond 19a, the decision was taken to proceed with an eDNA survey
on Pond 19a despite it being categorised as Poor. As the GCN eDNA result
returned for Pond 19a was negative, it was assumed that Pond 19b was also
negative as the two ponds are connected.
3.5.13 The eDNA sampling was restricted due to accessibility on Ponds 1b, 4 and 11
caused by dense vegetation and soft, deep mud. Approximately only 5% of the
perimeter of the pond was accessible to sample (see Table 3-2 and  Table 4-5).
Usually a GCN eDNA water sample which has been taken from such a restricted
area reduces the confidence in any negative result returned as GCN eDNA can be
patchy depending upon where the animals have been in the pond.

3.5.14 However on this occasion, given the lack of evidence of GCN within other ponds in
close proximity of Ponds 1b, 4 and 11 and the previous survey undertaken on Pond
11 which returned no results for GCN (ES Appendix 8.17). The eDNA limitation on
Ponds 1b, 4 and 11 is not deemed significant.

Results
4.1
Desk Study
4.1.1
WSP/PB identified a total of 23 ponds within 500 m of the previous Project Site
boundary and undertook a HSI assessment on 19 of these, 16 of which were
considered suitable to support GCN (see Table 4-1).
4.1.2
The Preliminary Ecological Appraisal (PEA) undertaken by AECOM in May 2017
(ES Appendix 8.1) identified a further two ponds within 500 m of the Project Site
(See Table 4-1 Pond 23 and 24).
4.1.3
The WSP/PB (ES Appendix 8.13) and the AECOM PEA (ES Appendix 8.1) desk
study highlighted that no GCN records were returned within 2 km of the Project Site
from the local records centre.
a)
Previous Surveys
4.1.4
The GCN surveys undertaken by BSG Ecology in 2014 did not identify any GCN
from the ponds surveyed (ES Appendix 8.17). Palmate newts Lissotriton helveticus
and smooth newts Lissotriton vulgaris were identified.
b)
Habitat Suitability Assessment
4.1.5
During the pond scoping survey to check the HSI categorisation AECOM identified
an additional pond, Pond 1b.

Manual Surveys
4.2.1
Following the AECOM updated HSI assessment, manual surveys were
undertaken on all ponds, where access allowed, of below average category
and above (with the exception of Pond 19a see Section 3.5). Access to Pond
17 was granted at a later stage than the other ponds and part of the manual
survey season was missed. Therefore manual surveys were not undertaken
on this pond. eDNA sampling was undertaken on Pond 17 (see Section 4.3).
4.2.2
The results of the surveys are shown in Table 4-2 and the weather conditions
are shown in Table 4-3. No GCN were recorded during any of the manual
surveys. Other amphibians were present in the ponds including palmate
newts, frogs and toads and a range of aquatic invertebrates including diving
beetle, dragonfly nymphs and pond skaters.
4.2.3
Weather conditions were considered favourable during all of the surveys as
shown in Table 4-3. The manual surveys ceased once the results of the
eDNA surveys had been received.
4.2.4
In 2014 manual surveys were undertaken by BSG Ecology on Ponds 10, 11
and 15-17 and no GCN were identified (ES Appendix 8.17).

#Details for ponds which had less than the three required manual survey methods are given in Section 3.5 and in the limitations section in Table 4-1.
**A dead water shrew was found in one of the bottle traps in Pond 7, therefore bottle trapping ceased for Ponds 7 and 8 and the netting technique was used for future surveys (see
Section 3.5)

Ecological Constraints and Indicative Potential Impacts
5.1.1
The indicative potential impacts of the Project on habitats and protected
species are outlined below; potential impacts will be assessed fully during
the Ecology Impact Assessment (EcIA).
5.1.2
No GCN were identified within nine ponds surveyed (Ponds 1b, 4, 7, 8, 11,
17, 19a, 19b and 22). The local records centre did not return any records of
GCN within 2 km of the Project Site. Previous surveys of ponds 10, 11, 15,
16 and 17 by BSG Ecology in 2014 did not identify the presence of GCN (ES
Appendix 8.17). Therefore, it is considered unlikely that any GCN will be
present within any of the ponds that were not surveyed or within 500 m of
these ponds in surrounding habitat given the absence of GCN from all
nearby ponds, and it is considered that there will be no impacts on GCN.
5.1.3
The Project will require the removal of three ponds (Ponds 16, 22 and 23).
Pond 22 currently supports palmate newts and is likely to support other
amphibians including frogs and toads, as well as a range of generalist
aquatic invertebrates. Pond 16 was dry. Pond 23 could not be assessed but
if it contains water has the potential
to support generalist aquatic
invertebrates and common amphibians. Removal of the ponds will result in
loss of habitat for a small number of common amphibians and common
aquatic invertebrates.
6.
Further Surveys and Recommendations
6.1
Further Surveys
6.1.1
No further surveys are recommended.
6.2
Recommendations for Mitigation and Enhancement
6.2.1
The Project will require the removal of three ponds (Ponds 16, 22 and 23).
Pond 22 currently supports palmate newts and is likely to support other
amphibians including frogs and toads as well as a range of generalist
aquatic invertebrates. Pond 16 was dry. Pond 23 could not be assessed but
if it contains water has the potential to support generalist aquatic
invertebrates and common amphibians.
6.2.2
Where the scheme design allows, ponds, swales or water bodies, should be
considered to mitigate the loss of the ponds and enhance the Project Site for
common amphibians.
6.2.3
If a waterbody is included in the scheme design this should be managed
specifically for amphibians and not stocked with fish. The waterbody could
include planting of marginal and floating vegetation. The waterbody and any
bankside vegetation should be managed to control over shading.

6.2.4
Log piles and hibernacula could be created in suitable areas of habitat (such
as grassland and scrub/woodland edges), to enhance the area for
amphibians.

Reptile Survey Report
1.1
Introduction
1.1.1
AECOM was commissioned to undertake a suite of ecological survey work to
inform the Abergelli Power Project (the “Project”).
1.1.2
The Project Site is located near to the village of Felindre, Swansea, as shown in
Figure 1, and the central grid reference for the Site is SN 6528 0143. A full
description of the Project is provided in Chapter 3: Project and Site Description.
1.1.3
The Preliminary Ecological Appraisal Report (AECOM, June 2017) identified that
surveys for reptiles were required within areas of suitable habitat at the Project Site.
1.1.4
This report outlines the presence of reptiles within the reptile survey area and
outlines initial recommendations for further surveys, mitigation and enhancement.
1.1.5
The reptile survey area encompasses all suitable habitats accessible within the
Project Site boundary, as shown on Figure 2.
a)
Objectives of this Survey
1.1.6
The objectives of this survey were:
·
To identify any designated nature conservation sites within or in the vicinity of
the Project Site boundary that have the potential to support reptiles;
·
To identify any known records and/or populations of reptiles in the vicinity of the
Project Site boundary;
·
To record and map evidence of reptiles;
·
To make an initial ecological assessment of the Project Site boundary in
respect to reptiles;
·
To highlight any initial potential ecological constraints in respect to reptiles;
·
To outline further survey work that may be required; and,
·
To make initial suggestions for mitigation, compensation and enhancement of
the natural features identified on the within the Project Site boundary in respect
to reptiles.
1.2
Legislation
1.2.1
British reptiles are protected under Schedule 5 of the Wildlife and Countryside Act
1981 (as amended).
1.2.2
For sand lizard Lacerta agilis and smooth snake Coronella austriaca all parts of
Section 9 apply. This prohibits:
·
intentional killing;
·
injuring or taking (capture. etc);
·
possession;
·
intentional disturbance whilst occupying a 'place used for shelter or protection'
and destruction of these places; and,

AECOM 1-5
·
trade (i.e. sale, barter, exchange, transporting for sale and advertising to sell or
to buy).
1.2.3
For the four widespread species of reptile, namely the common lizard Zootoca
vivipara, slow-worm Anguis fragilis, grass snake Natrix helvetica helvetica and
European adder Vipera berus, only part of sub-section 9(1) and all of sub-section
9(5) apply. These prohibit:
·
intentional killing;
·
injuring; and,
·
trade (i.e. sale, barter, exchange, transporting for sale and advertising to sell or
to buy).
1.3
Quality Assurance
1.3.1
This survey and subsequent report was undertaken in line with AECOM’s
Integrated Management System (IMS). Our IMS places great emphasis on
professionalism, technical excellence, quality, environmental and Health and Safety
management. All staff members are committed to establishing and maintaining our
certification to the international standards BS EN ISO 9001:2008 and 14001:2004
and BS OHSAS 18001:2007. In addition, our IMS requires careful selection and
monitoring of the performance of all sub-consultants and contractors.
1.3.2
All AECOM Ecologists who worked on this project are members of (at the
appropriate level) the Chartered Institute of
Ecology and Environmental
Management (CIEEM) and follow their code of professional conduct (CIEEM, 2013)
when undertaking ecological work.
1.4
Methodology
a) Desk study
1.4.1
The objective of the desk study is to review the existing information available in the
public domain concerning species and habitats to identify the following:
·
Internationally and nationally designated sites for reptiles, up to 2 km from the
Project Site using the Multi Agency Geographic Information for the Countryside
(MAGIC) website (www.magic.gov.uk);
·
Reptile records and records of locally designated sites for reptiles up to 2 km
from the Project Site, using the South East Wales Biodiversity Records Centre
(SEWBReC);
·
The Section 7 list of Principal Importance for Conservation of Biological
Diversity in Wales was reviewed for inclusion of reptiles; and,
·
Aerial photographs and Ordnance Survey (OS) maps were reviewed to identify
features of ecological interest surrounding the Project Site, nearby areas of
ecological interest and features connecting these habitats (hedgerows,
watercourses, railway lines).
1.4.2
The reports of previous surveys undertaken by BSG Ecology were provided by the
client and subsequently reviewed.

AECOM 1-6
b) Reptile Presence / Likely Absence Survey
1.4.3
The Phase 1 Habitat map (AECOM, 2017) and OS mapping were used to identify
habitat suitable for supporting reptiles within the Project Site boundary.
1.4.4
The reptile survey methodology paid due regard to reptile survey guidelines
provided by Froglife Advice Sheet 10 (Froglife, 1999) and the Herpetofauna
Workers’ Manual (Gent, T and Gibson, S, 1998).
1.4.5
Artificial refugia (approximately 0.5 m x 0.5 m square sheets of heavy-duty mineral
roofing felt – known as ‘reptile survey mats’) were placed in suitable locations within
suitable habitat (e.g. sunny areas adjacent denser vegetation and south facing) on
the 21st August 2017. These were left for 10 days to ‘bed-in’, until the start of
September when the suitable reptile survey period started.
1.4.6
A total of 99 reptile survey mats were placed within an area of 3.8 ha. This exceeds
the minimum density of 10 per hectare recommended in guidelines provided by
Froglife, 1999.
1.4.7
Figure 1 shows the Phase 1 Habitat map used to assess suitable reptile habitat.
Figure 2 shows the location of the reptile survey mats.
1.4.8
Reptile survey mats were checked on seven subsequent occasions in suitable
weather conditions (within a constant temperature range of between 10 – 20°C,
rain and windy conditions are usually unsuitable, sunny spells after rain can be
suitable (Froglife, 1999)). Each reptile survey mat was initially inspected from a
suitable distance to identify any reptiles that may be present basking on top of the
reptile survey
mats, without causing disturbance. The refugia were then
approached quietly and carefully, and lifted swiftly to examine the ground beneath;
any reptiles present were noted. During each survey, other artificial debris (such as
waste wood, plastic sheeting) and other naturally occurring habitat features likely to
be used by reptiles (such as small logs) were also checked for the presence of
reptiles.
1.4.9
Surveys were completed by suitably qualified ecologists with at least five years’
experience of ecological consultancy and with experience completing reptile
surveys.
1.4.10 The weather conditions were considered largely suitable for undertaking reptile
surveys. Weather conditions and survey dates are shown in Table 1.2.

c) Evaluation
1.4.11 In order to assess the value of any given reptile population, two assessment
methodologies may be applied. Nationally, the guidelines for the selection of Sites
of Special Scientific Interest (JNCC, 1989) provide criteria for identifying nationally
important populations of reptiles. The methodology developed by Froglife (1999)
used in the identification of Key Reptile Sites can be used to evaluate reptile
populations at a local or regional level.
1.4.12 To qualify as a Key Reptile Site, a site must meet at least one of the following
criteria:
·
Supports three or more reptile species;
·
Supports two snake species;
·
Supports an exceptional population (see Table 1.1) of one species;
·
Supports an assemblage of species scoring at least 4 (see Table 1.1); or,
·
Does not meet any of the previous criteria, but is of particular regional
importance due to local rarity.

1.5
Limitations
1.5.1
Biological records can be received from a wide variety of sources and may or may
not be comprehensive and accurate. However, if assessed in conjunction with a
survey, they can contribute to a robust ecological assessment of a site.
1.5.2
Several areas of habitat suitable for supporting reptiles within the Project Site
boundary could not be surveyed using artificial refugia due to the presence of
grazing livestock. Artificial refugia would pose a health and safety risk to the
livestock as well as posing a risk of trampling to sheltering reptile utilising the
artificial refugia. These areas lacked features where reptiles might be easily
observed and as such a walkover survey of these areas was not deemed
appropriate. There is the potential for reptiles to have gone unrecorded in these
areas. These areas have been indicated on Figure 2.
1.5.3
The survey method is designed to identify the presence or likely absence of
common reptile species. There is the potential for the survey to have recorded a
small sample of the populations present and if a reptile species occurs at a low
density it may have been missed.

Description
Previous Surveys
undertaken by BSG
Ecology, 2014
Common Lizard
A total of 163 adult and juvenile common lizard observations were
recorded, with a peak count of 50 recorded on one survey visit.
Observations were across the survey area within the Project Site
boundary. During the course of the survey both male and female
common lizard were recorded with some of the females being
gravid, which confirmed that there was a breeding population
present. (Appendix 8.5 of the ES).
Grass Snake
In total ten observations were recorded for grass snake with a
peak count of five recorded on one survey visit. The majority of
observations of grass snake were made in the area of marshy
grassland close to a pond. Juvenile grass snake was recorded
along with adults which suggested a breeding population present.
As grass snake are a wide ranging species and the location of the
animals recorded were near to the boundary, the presence of
juveniles could not necessarily confirm that breeding was taking
place within the Project Site boundary (Appendix 8.5 of the ES).
b) Reptile Survey Results

The weather conditions and timings for each of the reptile surveys are given in
Table 1.3 and a summary of the results of the reptile survey are given in Table 1.4.

Conclusions
a) Project Site Assessment
1.7.1
The desk study confirmed the presence of slow-worm, grass snake, adder and
common lizard within 2 km, and the presence of grass snake and common lizard
within the Project Site boundary.
1.7.2
During the 2017 reptile survey a total of 51 adult and juvenile common lizard
observations were recorded, with a peak count of 6 adults recorded on one survey
visit. Observations of common lizard were recorded from across the reptile survey
area within the Project Site boundary. The majority of records were from the verges
either side of the grassy track running through the centre of the Project Site and
from the semi-improved neutral grassland present around the National Grid site.
1.7.3
During the course of the reptile survey male, female and juvenile common lizards
were recorded, which confirmed that there was a breeding population present
within the Project Site boundary.
1.7.4
No grass snakes were identified within the reptile survey area including the area
with the highest abundance during the 2014 surveys (Appendix 8.5 of the ES).
However, there is the potential for grass snake to be present within the Project Site
boundary and to have gone unrecorded since:
·
grass snake are wide ranging;
·
Pond 16, where the majority of the 2014 records were from was mostly dry
throughout the 2017 reptile survey period, making the areas less suitable for
supporting grass snake; and,
·
the area in the north of the reptile survey area where grass snake were
recorded in 2014 could not be accessed for survey in 2017 due to grazing
livestock.
1.7.5
As such, it should be assumed grass snake is likely to be present at low densities
within the Project Site boundary and surrounding habitat.
b) Population and ‘Key reptile Site’ Criteria
1.7.6
Based on the survey results and the criteria laid out in Table 1.1, the Project Site
supports a ‘Good population’ of common lizard.
1.7.7
The Project Site does not meet the criteria for a ‘Key Reptile Site’.
c) Amphibian Species
1.7.8
Common toads were recorded under the reptile survey mats across the reptile
survey area, including juvenile and adults and as such it can be assumed that
common toad is breeding within or near to the Project Site boundary.

Recommendations
d)
Recommendations for Further Surveys
1.8.1
It is anticipated that no further surveys will be required.
e) Recommendations for Mitigation
1.8.2
At this stage the following key recommendations have been made:
·
Prior to construction commencing, areas within the Project Site boundary that
are suitable for supporting reptiles or are known to support reptiles should
undergo an exclusion fencing and translocation programme, including habitat
management, to move reptiles out of construction zones into suitable habitat
thereby limiting harm, injury or killing;
·
As part of the translocation programme, a suitable receptor site will need to be
identified to accept the reptiles translocated from the areas impacted by
construction phase activities and operational footprint of the Project.
·
The receptor site will need a population survey for reptiles undertaken to
ascertain it’s suitability for holding greater numbers of reptiles, this may be
possible within the Order Limits and it is proposed to discuss the findings of this
report with CCS and NRW and identify an area within the existing Order Limits.
An area of suitable or sub-optimal habitat can be utilised within the Project Site
boundary. If the area is sub-optimal, habitat management works will be
required to increase its suitability for reptiles with the aim to create structurally
diverse habitats. These will include:
o
Areas of cover to provide shelter and protection from predators;
o
Open areas in sunny spots and south facing slopes to provide areas for
basking; and
o
Mosaic of structural diversity including areas with different plant species,
age and height.
·
In addition, there must be:
o
Connectivity of habitats to allow movement between hibernating, foraging
and basking areas and to allow dispersal of populations; and
o
Inclusion of habitat edges and transitional zones including woodland
edges and grassland/scrub interface.
·
Habitat management works may take up to two years, depending on the
current condition of the area, to allow habitats to grow and develop these
features suitable for supporting reptile; and,
·
A Method Statement for the translocation and habitat management programme
should be written by a suitability experienced ecologist and agreement of the
Method Statement sought from the county ecologist.
f)
Recommendations for Biodiversity Enhancement
1.8.3
At this stage the following precautionary recommendations have been made:
·
Consider reptiles in the landscaping of the Project Site where possible.
·
Create artificial habitat features including:
o
Log and brash piles – to create cover, provide structural diversity and
enhance prey availability; and
Abergelli ES 2018 – REPTILE SURVEY REPORT
Prepared for: Abergelli Power Limited              
AECOM
1-15
o
Artificial hibernacula – create piles of rocks, logs, rubble etc. Some of this
should be buried below ground. Southward facing and well drained
locations are the most successful.
o
Basking sites – create south facing banks in open areas.
·
Manage the Project Site boundary under client ownership for reptiles.
Appropriate techniques should be adopted to prevent succession change in
areas of suitable habitat.

Breeding Bird Survey Report
1.1
Introduction
1.1.1
AECOM was commissioned to undertake a suite of ecological survey work to
inform the Abergelli Power Project (the “Project”), and support the Environmental
Statement (ES).
1.1.2
The Project Site is located near to the village of Felindre, Swansea, as shown in
Figure 1, and the central grid reference for the Project Site is SN65280143. A full
description of the development is provided in Chapter 3 (Project and Site
Description).
1.1.3
The Preliminary Ecological Appraisal Report (AECOM, 2017) identified that surveys
for breeding birds were required at the Project Site.
1.1.4
This baseline report describes the status of breeding birds within the breeding bird
survey area and makes initial indications of potential effects and outlines initial
recommendations for further surveys, mitigation and enhancement.
1.1.5
The breeding bird survey area encompasses all suitable and accessible areas of
woodland, hedgerows and scrub within proximity of and within the Project Site
boundary, as shown on Figure 1.
1.1.6
Previous surveys have been undertaken by BSG Ecology is provided in the ES
Appendix 8.16.
a)
Objectives of the Study
1.1.7
The objectives of this study were:
·
To identify any designated nature conservation sites within or in the vicinity of
the Project Site boundary that have the potential to support notable breeding
bird species or assemblages;
·
To identify any known records of breeding birds in the vicinity of the Project Site
boundary;
·
To record and map evidence of breeding bird activity;
·
To make an initial ecological assessment of the value of the Project Site to
breeding birds;
·
To highlight any initial potential ecological constraints related to breeding birds;
·
To outline further survey work that may be required; and,
·
To make initial suggestions for mitigation, compensation and enhancement of
the natural features identified within the Project Site with respect to the
breeding bird assemblage.

1.2
Legislation
1.2.1
There are several different acts of legislation and regulations which refer to the
protection of wildlife. Legislation with particular relevance to birds is outlined below.
1.2.2
This is a brief summary of the legislation and is not to be regarded as a definitive
legal opinion. When dealing with individual cases, the client is advised to consult
the full texts of the relevant legislation and obtain further legal advice.
b)
Statutory Legislation
1.2.3
Key legislation for birds in the UK includes:
·
Council Directive 79/409/EEC on the conservation of wild birds (the EC Birds
Directive); and,
·
Wildlife and Countryside Act 1981 (as amended) [WCA].
1.2.4
Annex 1 of the EC Birds Directive lists rare and vulnerable species of regularly
occurring or migratory wild birds that are subject to special conservation measures.
The Directive also provides for the designation of SPAs for the protection of these
species, which form part of the Natura 2000 network of sites protected by European
wildlife legislation.
1.2.5
Part 1 of the WCA sets out how the provisions of the Convention on the
Conservation of European Wildlife and Natural Habitats (the 'Bern Convention'), the
EC Birds Directive and the EC Habitats Directive are implemented in Great Britain.
Under Part 1, Section 1 of the WCA it is an offence to:
·
Kill, injure or take any wild bird intentionally;
·
Take, damage or destroy the nest of any wild bird while that nest is in use or
being built; and,
·
Take or destroy the egg(s) of any wild bird.
1.2.6
Schedule 1 of the WCA lists a number of species which, in addition to the
provisions listed above, are protected by special penalties at all times, including
against disturbance when breeding.
1.2.7
The WCA requires the prosecuting authority to prove that an offence was
intentional, however the Countryside and Rights of Way (CROW) Act 2000
strengthens the provisions of the WCA by introducing an additional offence of
“reckless” disturbance, which means that ignorance of the presence of a protected
species cannot be used as a reliable defence should a breach of the WCA be
committed.  The Natural Environment and Rural Communities (NERC) Act 2006
strengthens the WCA further with respect to the protection of the nests of certain
birds listed on Schedule Z1A, even when they are not in use.  The NERC Act also
offers additional protection to birds released into the wild as part of a repopulation
programme and provides minor amendments to the WCA with respect to captive
birds.

1.2.8
The Environment (Wales) Act 2016 strengthens the duty previously applied under
the Natural Environment and Rural Communities Act (2006) placed on planning
authorities to have due regard to biodiversity when making decisions. A number of
species of bird are listed on the Environment (Wales) Act 2016 Section 7 Priority
Species. These are the species found in Wales which were identified as requiring
action under the UK Biodiversity Action Plan (BAP) and which continue to be
regarded as conservation priorities under the UK Post-2010 Biodiversity
Framework. As such, it is targeted for measures necessary to support its
conservation status in the UK.
c) Non Statutory Policy
1.2.9
The RSPB (2009) and Eaton et al. (2009) have published lists of Birds of
Conservation Concern (BoCC). Red List species are those whose breeding
population or range is rapidly declining (50% or more in the last 25 years), recently
or historically, and those of global conservation concern. Amber List species are
those whose breeding population is in moderate decline (25 – 49% in the last 25
years), rare breeders, internationally important and localised species and those of
unfavourable conservation status in Europe.
1.2.10 These lists confer no legal status; however they are useful when assessing the
significance of predicted impacts and determining the level of mitigation that may
be required when birds are affected by development or any other activity.
Furthermore, inclusion on the Red List is a factor in determining the species which
may be added to the list of species of principal importance under the Environment
(Wales) Act.
1.3
Quality Assurance
1.3.1
This survey and subsequent report was undertaken in line with AECOM’s
Integrated Management System (IMS).
Our IMS places great emphasis on
professionalism, technical excellence, quality, environmental and Health and Safety
management. All staff members are committed to establishing and maintaining our
certification to the international standards BS EN ISO 9001:2008 and 14001:2004
and BS OHSAS 18001:2007.
In addition, our IMS requires careful selection and
monitoring of the performance of all sub-consultants and contractors.
1.3.2
All AECOM Ecologists who worked on this project are members of (at the
appropriate level) the Chartered Institute of Ecology and Environmental
Management (CIEEM) and follow their code of professional conduct (CIEEM, 2013)
when undertaking ecological work.
1.4
Methodology
a)
Desk Study
1.4.1
The objective of the desk study is to review the existing information available in the
public domain concerning species and habitats to identify the following:
Abergelli ES 2018 – BREEDING BIRD SURVEY REPORT

·
Internationally and nationally designated sites for birds, up to 2 km from the
Project Site using the Multi Agency Geographic Information for the Countryside
(MAGIC) website (NE, 2017);
·
Bird records and records of locally designated sites for breeding birds up to 2
km from the Project Site, using the South East Wales Biodiversity Records
Centre (SEWBReC);
·
Bird species within the Section 7 list of Principal Importance for Conservation of
Biological Diversity in Wales;
·
Features of ecological interest surrounding the Project Site, nearby areas of
ecological interest and features connecting these habitats (hedgerows,
watercourses, railway lines) using aerial photographs and Ordnance Survey
(OS) maps.
1.4.2
The reports of previous surveys undertaken by BSG Ecology were provided by the
client and were reviewed (ES Appendix 8.16).
b)
Breeding Bird Survey
1.4.3
The Project Site was visited on two occasions to identify the presence and status of
breeding birds within the Project Site. Surveys were undertaken paying due regard
to guidance provided in Breeding Bird Survey (BBS) methodology. All parts of the
Project Site were visited on foot to within 50 m where visibility extended or closer
where visibility was needed for example in woodlands or behind hedgerows.
Surveys were carried out on days with little or no wind, rain or mist in order to
maximise the potential for detection of birds and to avoid the possibility of bird
activity being suppressed by inclement weather conditions. Surveys were
completed by personnel with experience of the likely species assemblage for this
geography and habitat type. Survey dates, personnel and weather conditions are
shown in Table 1.1.
1.4.4
Species were identified by sight or sound and details of behaviour and activity was
recorded. A range of optical equipment including binoculars and telescope were
used as required and to minimise disturbance to potentially breeding species. A
species list of common passerine birds was compiled for the site; details of activity
and behaviour were made. The results were analysed to assess the status of the
birds on site as one of the following:
·
Non-breeding – Flyover or species observed within unsuitable breeding habitat;
·
Possible breeding – Species observed in breeding season in suitable nesting
habitat;
·
Probable breeding – Pair observed in suitable nesting habitat in breeding
season, territorial behaviour observed on at least two occasions, courtship and
display observed, observed visiting probable nest site, agitated behaviour or
anxiety calls from adults or nest building observed; or
·
Confirmed breeding – Used nest or eggshells, distraction display/injury feigning
observed, recently fledged young, adults on nest, adult carrying faecal sac or
food, nest containing eggs or nest with young seen/heard.

Limitations
1.5.1
BBS methodology was not followed in its entirety; species and activity were
recorded on a base map and species list and locations and behaviours recorded.
This gave a broad assessment of species present, potential for breeding and
potential ornithological constraints at the site. Territory mapping was not undertaken
since the surveys started in the later part of the breeding season and many species
had fledged and were recorded through the presence of dependent (or recently
independent) young as breeding.
1.5.2
The second survey visit on 14 June included an evening survey of the northern part
of the Site followed by a dusk walkover of marshy grassland in the south of the
Project Site looking for evidence of crepuscular species. The intention was to
complete the survey of the remainder of the Project Site the next morning (15 June)
from dawn onwards but the survey was unable to be completed due to a persistent
threat to surveyor safety.
1.5.3
There is potential for some birds to be missed or to go unnoticed due to the nature
of breeding bird surveys and possibility of birds not vocalising and/or being present
in dense vegetation. When combined with previous surveys and given the relatively
simple nature of habitats it is considered that the current BBS provides an accurate
assessment of the ornithological value of the Project Site to breeding birds.
1.5.4
There were no further limitations to this survey.

Surrounding Land
Use
The Project Site is located to the north of Junction 46 of the M4
Motorway close to the village of Felindre, Swansea.
The Project Site has agricultural fields to the east, south and
north. Areas of woodland are located to the south, east and west
of the Site. Areas of the National Grid Compound with associated
roads and buildings are partially within and adjacent to the Project
Site boundary.
A water treatment works is located in the north
west outside of the Project Site boundary.
Previous Surveys
undertaken by BSG
Ecology
The client provided AECOM with the reports of previous surveys
undertaken in 2014 by BSG Ecology within the Site (ES Appendix
8.16).  The red line boundary included within these reports is
different to the 2017 Project Site boundary.
It was noted that the 2017 Project Site boundary is smaller than
the red line boundary used by BSG Ecology in 2014.  However,
the current Project Site boundary is within the same area as the
2014 red line boundary provided to BSG Ecology and therefore
the surveys undertaken would have captured the current Project
Site area.
The 2014 BSG Ecology Breeding Bird Survey Report identified 30
species of birds breeding within the Project Site and an additional
23 species using the Project Site or flying over. The surveys were

A breeding bird survey was conducted at the Project Site on two occasions during
May and June 2017. The results are summarised in Table 1.3. Birds were
considered to be confirmed breeding if either direct evidence of nesting was found
(active nest or adult bird carrying food or faecal pellet) or if males were observed
displaying territorial behaviour (singing, calling or aggression) in suitable habitat for
breeding on each visit. An assemblage of common birds typical of the habitats on
Project Site was recorded. No Annex 1 or Schedule 1 birds were recorded.
1.6.3
Out of a total of 45 species recorded only swift was definitely not breeding within
the Project Site boundary. Twelve species listed on Section 7 were recorded all of
which may have been breeding within the Project Site boundary or immediate
surrounds: bullfinch, cuckoo, dunnock, house sparrow, lapwing, lesser redpoll,
linnet, reed bunting, skylark, song thrush, starling and tree pipit.  Ten species are
also listed on the BoCC Red list: cuckoo, house sparrow, lapwing, lesser redpoll,
linnet, mistle thrush, skylark, song thrush, starling and tree pipit. Eight further
species were recorded which are listed on the BoCC Amber List: bullfinch,
dunnock, meadow pipit, redstart, reed bunting, swift, tawny owl and willow warbler.

1.7
Conclusions
1.7.1
The Site supports a varied assemblage of breeding birds typical of the size, habitat
types and regional location. The surveys undertaken in both 2014 and 2017
produced very similar results which is unsurprising considering that the habitats
and management practices have changed little between the two surveys.
1.8
Preliminary Recommendations
a)
Recommendations for Further Surveys
1.8.1
A full assessment of required further surveys has been made during EcIA and
reported in the ES.
At this stage it is anticipated that further surveys should be
undertaken in early 2018 in order to fully assess the assemblage of species using
the Project Site earlier in the season.
b) Recommendations for Mitigation
1.8.2
A full series of recommendations for further surveys and mitigation at construction
and operation has been undertaken for the EcIA.
Mitigation should focus on
avoiding removal of habitat within the bird breeding season of March – August
inclusive and to ensure that replacement landscape planting seeks to provide
alternative habitat for those species present.

c) Recommendations for Biodiversity Enhancement
1.8.3
A full series of recommendations for biodiversity enhancement has been made
during the EcIA and reported in the ES. At this stage the following preliminary
recommendations have been made for general biodiversity enhancements:
·
Provide nesting boxes in woodland and buildings for a range of species
including house sparrow, starling and tawny owl; and,
·
Improve the availability of breeding and foraging habitat within the Project Site
by planting new scrub, hedgerows, and infilling current gaps in hedgerows with
whips and creating green corridors. It is recommended to use native species.

Breeding Bird Survey Report 
1.1 
Introduction 
1.1.1 
AECOM was commissioned to undertake a suite of ecological survey work to 
inform the Abergelli Power Project (the “Project”), and support the Environmental 
Statement (ES).  
1.1.2 
The Project Site is located near to the village of Felindre, Swansea, as shown in 
Figure 1, and the central grid reference for the Project Site is SN65280143. A full 
description of the development is provided in ES Chapter 3 (Project and Site 
Description).  
1.1.3 
The Preliminary Ecological Appraisal Report (Appendix 8.1) identified that surveys 
for breeding birds were required at the Project Site.  
1.1.4 
This baseline report describes the status of breeding birds within the breeding bird 
survey area and makes initial indications of potential effects and outlines initial 
recommendations for further surveys, mitigation and enhancement.  
1.1.5 
The breeding bird survey area encompasses all suitable and accessible areas of 
woodland, hedgerows and scrub within proximity of and within the Project Site 
Boundary, as shown on Figure 1.  
1.1.6 
Additional surveys were undertaken after the submission of the ES in May 2018, 
therefore this report is provided as an update to the Breeding Birds Report, ES 
Appendix 8.6.  
1.1.7 
Surveys have been undertaken in 2017 and 2018. Surveys undertaken in 2017 
were focussed on a larger area that encompassed the Project Site Boundary due to 
the uncertainty of the Project Site Boundary at the time of survey. Surveys 
undertaken in 2018 were focused within the Project Site Boundary only. Previous 
surveys have been undertaken by BSG Ecology are provided in the ES Appendix 
8.16.  
a) Objectives of the Study 
1.1.8 
The objectives of this study were: 
 
To identify any designated nature conservation sites within or in the vicinity of 
the Project Site boundary that have the potential to support notable breeding 
bird species or assemblages; 
 
To identify any known records of breeding birds in the vicinity of the Project Site 
boundary; 
 
To record and map evidence of breeding bird activity;  
 
To make an initial ecological assessment of the value of the Project Site to 
breeding birds; 
 
To highlight any initial potential ecological constraints related to breeding birds; 
 
To outline further survey work that may be required; and, 
 BREEDING BIRD UPDATE SURVEY REPORT 
 
Prepared for:  Abergelli Power Limited  
AECOM

 
To make initial suggestions for mitigation, compensation and enhancement of 
the natural features identified within the Project Site with respect to the 
breeding bird assemblage.  
 
1.2 
Legislation 
1.2.1 
There are several different acts of legislation and regulations which refer to the 
protection of wildlife. Legislation with particular relevance to birds is outlined below.  
1.2.2 
This is a brief summary of the legislation and is not to be regarded as a definitive 
legal opinion. When dealing with individual cases, the client is advised to consult 
the full texts of the relevant legislation and obtain further legal advice. 
b) Statutory Legislation 
1.2.3 
Key legislation for birds in the UK includes: 
 
Council Directive 79/409/EEC on the conservation of wild birds (the EC Birds 
Directive); and, 
 
Wildlife and Countryside Act 1981 (as amended) [WCA]. 
1.2.4 
Annex 1 of the EC Birds Directive lists rare and vulnerable species of regularly 
occurring or migratory wild birds that are subject to special conservation measures.  
The Directive also provides for the designation of SPAs for the protection of these 
species, which form part of the Natura 2000 network of sites protected by European 
wildlife legislation.   
1.2.5 
Part 1 of the WCA sets out how the provisions of the Convention on the 
Conservation of European Wildlife and Natural Habitats (the 'Bern Convention'), the 
EC Birds Directive and the EC Habitats Directive are implemented in Great Britain.  
Under Part 1, Section 1 of the WCA it is an offence to: 
 
Kill, injure or take any wild bird intentionally; 
 
Take, damage or destroy the nest of any wild bird while that nest is in use or 
being built; and, 
 
Take or destroy the egg(s) of any wild bird. 
1.2.6 
Schedule 1 of the WCA lists a number of species which, in addition to the 
provisions listed above, are protected by special penalties at all times, including 
against disturbance when breeding.   
 BREEDING BIRD UPDATE SURVEY REPORT 
 
Prepared for:  Abergelli Power Limited  
AECOM 
5 
 
1.2.7 
The WCA requires the prosecuting authority to prove that an offence was 
intentional, however the Countryside and Rights of Way (CROW) Act 2000 
strengthens the provisions of the WCA by introducing an additional offence of 
“reckless” disturbance, which means that ignorance of the presence of a protected 
species cannot be used as a reliable defence should a breach of the WCA be 
committed.  The Natural Environment and Rural Communities (NERC) Act 2006 
strengthens the WCA further with respect to the protection of the nests of certain 
birds listed on Schedule Z1A, even when they are not in use.  The NERC Act also 
offers additional protection to birds released into the wild as part of a repopulation 
programme and provides minor amendments to the WCA with respect to captive 
birds.  
1.2.8 
The Environment (Wales) Act 2016 strengthens the duty previously applied under 
the Natural Environment and Rural Communities Act (2006) placed on planning 
authorities to have due regard to biodiversity when making decisions. A number of 
species of bird are listed on the Environment (Wales) Act 2016 Section 7 Priority 
Species. These are the species found in Wales which were identified as requiring 
action under the UK Biodiversity Action Plan (BAP) and which continue to be 
regarded as conservation priorities under the UK Post-2010 Biodiversity 
Framework. As such, it is targeted for measures necessary to support its 
conservation status in the UK. 
c) Non Statutory Policy 
1.2.9 
The RSPB (2009) and Eaton et al. (2009) have published lists of Birds of 
Conservation Concern (BoCC) which are regularly updated to reflect recent trends 
in bird populations. Red List species are those whose breeding population or range 
is rapidly declining (50% or more in the last 25 years), recently or historically, and 
those of global conservation concern. Amber List species are those whose 
breeding population is in moderate decline (25 – 49% in the last 25 years), rare 
breeders, internationally important and localised species and those of unfavourable 
conservation status in Europe.  
1.2.10 These lists confer no legal status; however they are useful when assessing the 
significance of predicted impacts and determining the level of mitigation that may 
be required when birds are affected by development or any other activity. 
Furthermore, inclusion on the Red List is a factor in determining the species which 
may be added to the list of species of principal importance under the Environment 
(Wales) Act. 
1.3 
Quality Assurance 
1.3.1 
This survey and subsequent report was undertaken in line with AECOM’s 
Integrated Management System (IMS). Our IMS places great emphasis on 
professionalism, technical excellence, quality, environmental and Health and Safety 
management. All staff members are committed to establishing and maintaining our 
certification to the international standards BS EN ISO 9001:2008 and 14001:2004 
and BS OHSAS 18001:2007.  In addition, our IMS requires careful selection and 
monitoring of the performance of all sub-consultants and contractors.

1.3.2 
All AECOM Ecologists who worked on this project are members of (at the 
appropriate level) the Chartered Institute of Ecology and Environmental 
Management (CIEEM) and follow their code of professional conduct (CIEEM, 2017) 
when undertaking ecological work.  
1.4 
Methodology 
a) 
Desk Study 
1.4.1 
The objective of the desk study is to review the existing information available in the 
public domain concerning species and habitats to identify the following: 
 
Internationally and nationally designated sites for birds, up to 2 km from the 
Project Site using the Multi Agency Geographic Information for the Countryside 
(MAGIC) website (NE, 2017);  
 
Bird records and records of locally designated sites for breeding birds up to 2 
km from the Project Site, using the South East Wales Biodiversity Records 
Centre (SEWBReC);  
 
Bird species within the Section 7 list of Principal Importance for Conservation of 
Biological Diversity in Wales; 
 
Features of ecological interest surrounding the Project Site, nearby areas of 
ecological interest and features connecting these habitats (hedgerows, 
watercourses, railway lines) using aerial photographs and Ordnance Survey 
(OS) maps.   
1.4.2 
The reports of previous surveys undertaken by BSG Ecology were provided by the 
client and were reviewed (ES Appendix 8.16).  
b) Breeding Bird Survey 
1.4.3 
Surveys were completed by personnel with experience of the likely species 
assemblage for this geography and habitat type. Survey dates, personnel and 
weather conditions are shown in Table 1.1.  
1.4.4 
Species were identified by sight or sound and details of behaviour and activity was 
recorded. A range of optical equipment including binoculars and telescope were 
used as required and to minimise disturbance to potentially breeding species. A 
species list of common passerine birds was compiled for the site; details of activity 
and behaviour were made. The results of breeding bird surveys were analysed to 
assess the status of the birds on site as one of the following: 
 
Non-breeding – Flyover or species observed within unsuitable breeding habitat;  
 
Possible breeding – Species observed in breeding season in suitable nesting 
habitat; 
 
Probable breeding – Pair observed in suitable nesting habitat in breeding 
season, territorial behaviour observed on at least two occasions, courtship and 
display observed, observed visiting probable nest site, agitated behaviour or 
anxiety calls from adults or nest building observed; or 
 
Confirmed breeding – Used nest or eggshells, distraction display/injury feigning 
observed, recently fledged young, adults on nest, adult carrying faecal sac or 
food, nest containing eggs or nest with young seen/heard.

i. 
Breeding Bird Surveys 2017 
1.4.5 
The Project Site was visited on two occasions to identify the presence and status of 
breeding birds within the Project Site. Surveys were undertaken paying due regard 
to guidance provided in Breeding Bird Survey (BBS) methodology. All parts of the 
Project Site were visited on foot to within 50 m where visibility extended or closer 
where visibility was needed for example in woodlands or behind hedgerows.  
1.4.6 
Surveys were carried out on days with little or no wind, rain or mist in order to 
maximise the potential for detection of birds and to avoid the possibility of bird 
activity being suppressed by inclement weather conditions.  
ii. Breeding Bird Surveys 2018 
1.4.7 
Four breeding bird surveys were undertaken between April and May 2018. Surveys 
were undertaken paying due regard to guidance provided in BBS methodology.  
1.4.8 
A survey transect (located in Figure 1) was designed to encompass habitat within 
the Project Site boundary suitable for supporting breeding birds such as hedgerows 
and woodland.  
1.4.9 
The transect was walked at dusk and dawn on the same or consecutive day in April 
and May. The direction of the transect was swapped  for each survey to help 
reduce bias. The dusk survey commenced two hours before sunset and finished at 
sunset. The dawn survey commenced fifteen minutes before sunrise and continued 
for two hours. All birds heard or seen whilst walking the transect were recorded 
including species, location and activity.  
1.4.10 Surveys were carried out on days with little or no wind, rain or mist in order to 
maximise the potential for detection of birds and to avoid the possibility of bird 
activity being suppressed by inclement weather conditions. 
1.4.11 An additional survey was undertaken in late February 2018 aimed at detecting the 
presence of displaying goshawk Accipiter gentilis. This survey paid due regard to 
the guidance in Raptors: a field guide for surveys and monitoring, (Hardey et al, 
2013).  The survey consisted of a Vantage Point watch over the area of woodland 
within the Project Site boundary. Goshawk seek large undisturbed blocks of 
woodland in which to breed and therefore the survey area was selected 
accordingly. The survey period deviated from that in the guidance to reflect the 
likely earlier breeding recorded in South Wales compared to the reference surveys 
further north.

Limitations 
1.5.1 
BBS methodology was not followed in its entirety; species and activity were 
recorded on a base map and species list and locations and behaviours recorded.  
This gave a broad assessment of species present, potential for breeding and 
potential ornithological constraints at the site. Territory mapping was not undertaken 
since the assemblage of birds recorded were relatively common and as such this 
would not add any value to the assessment of impacts in the ES.  
1.5.2 
It was not possible to access the access road leading to the Felindre Gas 
Compressor Station and National Grid 400 kV electrical substations due to the gate 
being locked between the hours of 16:00 and 08:00 (Figure 1). Habitats suitable for 
supporting breeding birds in this area are limited to trees and hedgerows, adjacent 
habitats include improved and semi-improved grassland and woodland. As such, 
the suite of species will be similar to those found elsewhere within the Project Site 
boundary and this is not considered to be a significant limitation.  
1.5.3 
The second survey visit on 14 June 2017 included an evening survey of the 
northern part of the Site followed by a dusk walkover of marshy grassland in the 
south of the Project Site looking for evidence of crepuscular species. The intention 
was to complete the survey of the remainder of the Project Site the next morning 
(15 June 2017) from dawn onwards but the survey was unable to be completed due 
to a persistent threat to surveyor safety.

1.5.4 
In 2018 the survey was undertaken across the entire Project Site. In 2018 the 
transect was reduced to include only the areas which are within the Project Site 
boundary. The 2018 survey area is smaller than the 2017 survey area and as such 
the results have been reported separately to avoid over or under valuing of the 
Project Site in relation to breeding birds.  
1.5.5 
There is potential for some birds to be missed or to go unnoticed due to the nature 
of breeding bird surveys and possibility of birds not vocalising and/or being present 
in dense vegetation. A total of six surveys have been undertaken by AECOM. When 
combined with previous surveys and given the relatively simple nature of habitats it 
is considered that the BBS as described in this report provides an accurate 
assessment of the ornithological value of the Project Site to breeding birds.  
1.5.6 
There were no further limitations to this survey.

Previous Surveys 
undertaken by BSG 
Ecology  
The client provided AECOM with the reports of previous surveys 
undertaken in 2014 by BSG Ecology within the Site (ES Appendix 
8.16).  The red line boundary included within these reports is 
different to the 2017 Project Site boundary.  
It was noted that the 2017 Project Site boundary is smaller than 
the red line boundary used by BSG Ecology in 2014.  However, 
the current Project Site boundary is within the same area as the 
2014 red line boundary provided to BSG Ecology and therefore 
the surveys undertaken would have captured the current Project 
Site area.  
The 2014 BSG Ecology Breeding Bird Survey Report identified 30 
species of birds breeding within the Project Site and an additional 
23 species using the Project Site or flying over. The surveys were 
undertaken on three dates between April and June under suitable 
weather conditions (ES Appendix 8.16).  
b) Breeding Bird Survey Results 
1.6.2 
A breeding bird survey was conducted at the Project Site on two occasions during 
May and June 2017, four occasions during April and May 2018, and one occasion 
in February 2018 aimed at identifying the presence of Northern goshawk. The 
results of the BBS are summarised in Table 1.3.  
1.6.3 
Birds were considered to be confirmed breeding if either direct evidence of nesting 
was found (active nest or adult bird carrying food or faecal pellet) or if males were 
observed displaying territorial behaviour (singing, calling or aggression) in suitable 
habitat for breeding on each visit. An assemblage of common birds typical of the 
habitats on the Project Site was recorded. One red kite was recorded during the 
survey in February 2018 soaring over woodland outside of the Project Site 
Boundary but otherwise there were no records of Annex 1 or Schedule 1 breeding 
species (including Northern goshawk). 
1.6.4 
Results have been split into 2017 and 2018 due to the variation in survey area. The 
results from 2018 are more representative of the actual impacts of the scheme as 
they were undertaken over a reduced survey area within the Project Site Boundary.

1.7 
Conclusions 
1.7.1 
The Project Site supports a varied assemblage of breeding birds typical of the size, 
habitat types and regional location. The surveys undertaken in 2014 and 2017 
produced very similar results which is unsurprising considering that the habitats 
and management practices have changed little between the surveys.  
1.7.2 
The 2018 surveys recorded similar species assemblages as for 2014 and 2017 but 
the numbers of birds were reduced due to a reduced survey area.  
1.8 
Recommendations 
a) Recommendations for Further Surveys 
1.8.1 
No further surveys are required.  
b) Recommendations for Mitigation 
1.8.2 
A full series of recommendations for further surveys and mitigation at construction 
and operation has been undertaken for the EcIA.  Mitigation should focus on 
avoiding removal of habitat within the bird breeding season of March – August 
inclusive and to ensure that replacement landscape planting seeks to provide 
alternative habitat for those species present. Ecological mitigation methods are set 
out in the Landscape and Ecology Mitigation Plan (ES Appendix 3.4) and secured 
through the Development Consent Order (DCO). 
c) Recommendations for Biodiversity Enhancement  
1.8.3 
A full series of recommendations for biodiversity enhancement has been made 
during the EcIA and reported in the Landscape and Ecology Mitigation Plan (ES 
Appendix 3.4), and secured through the Development Consent Order (DCO). 
1.8.4 
Following additional surveys in 2018 the following recommendations as set out in 
the ES still remain valid: 
 
Provide nesting boxes in woodland and buildings for a range of species 
including house sparrow, starling and tawny owl; and,  
 
Improve the availability of breeding and foraging habitat within the Project Site 
by planting new scrub, hedgerows, and infilling current gaps in hedgerows with 
whips and creating green corridors. It is recommended to use native species.

Bat Survey Report  
1.1 
Introduction  
1.1.1 
AECOM was commissioned to undertake a suite of ecological survey work to 
inform the Abergelli Power Project (the “Project”).  
1.1.2 
The Project Site is located near to the village of Felindre, Swansea, as shown in 
Figure 1.1. The central grid reference for the Project Site is SN65280143. 
1.1.3 
The Preliminary Ecological Appraisal (PEA) Report (Appendix 8.1 of the ES) 
identified that surveys for bats were required at the Project Site.  The Project Site 
was assessed as having ‘High’ commuting and foraging potential (Collins, 2016).  
Four buildings (outside of, but adjacent to the Project Site boundary) were 
assessed as having the potential to support roosting bats (Appendix 8.1 of the ES).  
1.1.4 
This baseline report outlines the presence of bat species within the Project Site 
boundary and makes initial indications of potential effects and outlines initial 
recommendations for further surveys, mitigation and enhancement.   
1.1.5 
The bat survey encompasses suitable habitat in close proximity to and within the 
Project Site boundary, as shown on Figure 1 and Figures 3.1-3.4.  
1.1.6 
Previous surveys have been undertaken by BSG Ecology in 2014 which are 
presented in Appendix 8.1 of the ES.  
1.2 
Site Description 
1.2.1 
The Project Site supports semi-natural broadleaved and plantation woodland, rows 
of broadleaved trees, standalone broadleaved trees, dense and scattered scrub, 
improved and semi-improved grassland and marshy grassland, tall ruderal, running 
water ditches, ponds, species-rich hedgerow with trees, species-poor hedgerow 
with trees, species-poor intact hedgerows, earth banks, fences and bare ground 
(hard standing). In order to cover the Project Site adequately two walked transects 
were undertaken and nine static detector monitoring locations were established 
across the Project Site. 
1.2.2 
The walked transect North (Figure 3.1) predominantly encompasses improved 
grassland fields with hedgerows and mature tree lines. It also includes a few areas 
of dense scrub, semi-improved neutral grassland, and a running water ditch (which 
is connected to the Afon Llan watercourse outside of the Project Site) and a tree 
lined minor road and track. 
1.2.3 
The walked transect South (Figiure 3.1) predominantly encompasses; marshy and 
improved grassland fields with hedgerows and treelines, with ancient and semi-
natural woodland. It also includes semi-improved neutral grassland and areas of 
scattered scrub.  There are three running water ditches and the walked transect 
runs adjacent to a an area of running water on the eastern Project Site boundary 
which connects to the Afon Llan watercourse, which is outside of the Project Site.

1.2.4 
Plates 1.6 and 1.7 show exmaples of the transect habitats. 
1.2.5 
The nine static detector monitoring locations were placed on field boundaries 
across the Project Site, sampling improved grassland, semi-improved grassland, 
marshy grassland, field boundaries, woodland edges and trees lines. Table 1.25 
describes the habitats around each static detector location and locations of the 
static detectors are shown in Figure 3.4.

The Project  
1.3.1 
Full details of the Project and Site Description are provided in Chapter 3: Project & 
Site Description. 
1.4 
 Objectives of the Study  
1.4.1 
The objectives of this study were: 
 
To identify nature conservation sites within the Project Site or within 10km of 
the Project Site boundary designated for bats; 
 
To identify any known records and/or populations of bats within the Project Site 
or within 2km of the Project Site boundary; 
 
To establish the presence of any bat roosts within the Project Site; 
 
To establish bat species composition within the Project Site; 
 
To record and map spatial distribution and temporal bat activity within the 
Project Site;  
 
To highlight any potential ecological constraints in respect to bats; 
 
To outline further survey work that may be required; and, 
 
To make suggestions for mitigation, compensation and enhancement of the 
natural features identified within the Project Site in respect to bats.    
1.5 
Legislation 
1.5.1 
All bats and their roosts in Wales are fully protected under Schedule 5 of the 
Wildlife and Countryside Act 1981 (as amended).  They are also included in 
Schedule 2 of the Conservation of Habitats and Species Regulations 2010, known 
as The Habitats Regulations.  The Wildlife and Countryside Act 1981 was amended 
by the Countryside and Rights of Way Act 2000 (CRoW) which adds an extra 
offence of recklessly disturbing roosting bats or obstructing access to their roosts; 
makes species offences arrestable, increases the time limits for some prosecutions 
and increases penalties.  
1.5.2 
The Wildlife and Countryside Act, the Habitats Regulations and the CRoW Act, 
together make it an offence, among other things, to recklessly, intentionally or 
deliberately: 
 
Deliberately capture, injure or kill any wild animal which is a European 
Protected Species (EPS), 
 
Deliberately disturb wild animals of any such species, and, 
 
Damage or destroy a breeding site or resting place of such an animal

1.5.3 
Disturbance is defined as that which is likely: 
 
To impair their ability: 
o To survive, to breed or reproduce, or to rear or nurture their young, or 
o In the case of animals of a hibernating or migratory species, to hibernate 
or migrate; or 
 
To affect significantly the local distribution or abundance of the species to 
which they belong. 
1.5.4 
A bat roost is defined as “any structure or place (including trees) which any bat 
uses for shelter or protection”.  Because bats tend to re-use the same roosts, legal 
opinion is that the roost is protected whether or not the bat(s) are present at the 
time.  
1.5.5 
If the Project is likely to destroy or disturb bats or their roosts, then a European 
Protected Species License (EPSL) will be required from Natural Resources Wales 
(NRW), which would be subject to appropriate mitigation and working methods to 
protect bats.  
1.5.6 
This is a brief summary of the legislation.  When dealing with individual cases, the 
client is advised to consult the full texts of the relevant legislation and obtain further 
legal advice.

Methodology 
a) Desk study 
1.7.1 
The desk study was completed as part of the AECOM PEA (Appendix 8.1 of the 
ES).  In relation to bats, the objectives of the desk study were to review the existing 
information available in the public domain to identify the following: 
 
Special Areas of Conservation (SACs) and Sites of Special Scientific Interest 
(SSSIs) designated for bats within a 10km radius of the Project Site boundary 
paying due regard to Bat Conservation Trust (BCT) guidelines (Collins, 2016) , 
Abergelli ES 2018 – BAT ACTIVITY AND ROOST SURVEY

using the Multi Agency Geographic Information for the Countryside (MAGIC) 
website (NE, 2017);  
 
Bat records up to 2km from the Project Site boundary, purchased from the 
South East Wales Biodiversity Records Centre (SEWBReC);  
 
Ancient Semi-Natural Woodland (ASNW), Plantation on Ancient Woodland Site 
(PAWS), Restored Ancient Woodland Site (RAWS) or Ancient Woodland Site 
of Unknown category (AWSU) within or adjacent to the Project Site using 
Ancient Woodland Inventory 2011 dataset downloaded from the Lle website 
(WG and NRW, 2017); 
 
The Section 7 list of species of Principal Importance for Conservation of 
Biological Diversity in Wales; and, 
 
Features of ecological interest surrounding the Project Site, and features 
connecting these habitats (e.g. hedgerows, watercourses, railway lines) using 
aerial photographs and Ordnance Survey (OS) maps.   
1.7.2 
The County Ecologist and Glamorgan Bat Group was consulted regarding locally 
designated site citations, local bat records not available from SEWBReC and any 
local knowledge about the area. 
1.7.3 
Appendix 8.8 of the ES which contains the previous bat surveys undertaken by 
BSG Ecology in 2014 was provided by the client and reviewed. 
b) Bat Roosts in Buildings 
i. 
Preliminary Ground Level Roost Assessments 
1.7.4 
There are no buildings within the Project Site. Buildings adjacent (adjacent is 
defined as up to 20m from the Site boundary) to the Project Site boundary were 
classified into categories dependent on the presence of features suitable as bat 
roost habitat.   
1.7.5 
The assessment was conducted via an external appraisal from the ground using 
binoculars where necessary.  Table 1.1 provides descriptions of the roost potential 
categories for buildings.  
ii. Emergence/Re-Entry Surveys  
1.7.6 
Surveys paid due regard to Bat Surveys: Good Practice Guidelines (Collins, 2016).  
Each survey consisted of two surveyors stood around the buildings so that bats 
could be observed leaving/re-entering Potential Roost Features (PRF).  Bat activity 
was also recorded if observed by the surveyors.  
1.7.7 
Emergence surveys started at least 15 minutes before sunset and continued for 2 
hours.  The dawn re-entry survey started at least 2 hours before sunrise and 
continued until 15 minutes after sunrise.   
1.7.8 
Broadband frequency division detectors were used and digital recordings were 
made to assist with species identification if required.

c) Bat Roosts in Trees 
i. 
Preliminary Ground Assessment 
1.7.9 
The bat study area comprised the land within the Project Site boundary and the 
area within the Zone of Influence (ZoI) (Figure 2). The Bat Survey Guidelines 
(Collins, 2016) state that bat roost assessments must be considered within the 
Project Site boundary and the areas under the ZoI of the project.  For potential bat 
roosts the ZoI was assessed to be all land within the Project Site boundary; and 
using professional judgement, within a 50 m buffer surrounding area where the 
Generating Equipment Site will be situated due to noise, vibration and lighting 
during construction, operation and decommissioning.  
1.7.10 Trees within or adjacent (adjacent is defined as up to 20m from the Site boundary) 
to the Project Site boundary were classified into categories dependent on the 
presence of features suitable as bat roost habitat.   
1.7.11 Trees up to 50m from the Generating Equipment Site were classified into 
categories dependent on the presence of features suitable as bat roost habitat. 
1.7.12 The assessment was conducted via an external appraisal from the ground using 
binoculars where necessary.  Table 1.1 provides descriptions of the roost potential 
categories for trees.  
1.7.13 Eleven trees with bat roost potential were identified during the PEA (Appendix 8.1 
of the ES).  Thirty four trees were identified during a ground level roost assessment 
of trees in July 2017.   
ii. Potential Roost Feature Climbed Inspection Survey  
1.7.14 Following the Ground Level Roost Assessment trees which were assessed as 
having ‘Low or Moderate’ bat roost potential were subject to a PRF climbed 
inspection.  No trees with High bat roost potential were identified.  
1.7.15 These PRF climbed inspections were undertaken in August 2017.  The inspections 
were completed by certified and bat licenced tree climbers.  
1.7.16 The inspections paid due regard to Bat Surveys: Good Practice Guidelines (Collins, 
2016), Bat Workers Manual (Mitchell-Jones and McLeish, 2004) and Bats and 
Woodland Management (Forestry Commission, 2005).  
1.7.17 Trees were climbed using ropes and/or ladders.  Once accessed, features were 
examined in detail using a torch, endoscope or mirror to inspect (where possible) 
the full extent of the features and search for bats or evidence of bat activity (e. g.  
droppings, urine stains, odour, feeding remains, scratch marks, grease stains, wear 
marks).  Where necessary, trees were re-categorised following the PRF climbed 
inspection.

1.7.18 Two trees identified as having bat roost potential during the preliminary ground 
level roost assessments were not climbed as they were approximately 20 and 55m 
outside of the Project Site boundary. 
1.7.19 Sixteen trees could not be accessed and two could not be found during the PRF 
climbed inspections, as described in the Limitations (Section 1.8).  
iii. Emergence/Re-Entry Surveys  
1.7.20 Following the Ground Level Roost Assessment and PRF climbed inspections, 
emergence/re-entry surveys were undertaken on trees with a category of Moderate 
or above.  
1.7.21 Surveys paid due regard to Bat Surveys: Good Practice Guidelines (Collins, 2016). 
Each survey consisted of one surveyor stood so that bats could be observed 
leaving/re-entering the PRF. Bat activity was also recorded if observed by the 
surveyors. 
1.7.22 Emergence surveys started at least 15 minutes before sunset and continued for 2 
hours (see Limitations). The dawn re-entry survey started at least 2 hours before 
sunrise and continued until 15 minutes after sunrise.  
1.7.23 Broadband frequency division detectors were used and digital recordings were 
made to assist with species identification if required. The weather conditions during 
the surveys were recorded and were largely considered favourable for bats.  
Survey dates and weather conditions are given in Table 1.3. 
d)  Bat Activity Surveys 
i. 
Preliminary Assessment of Potential Commuting and Foraging Habitat 
1.7.24 The Project Site was assessed as having High commuting and foraging potential 
for bats (Collins, 2016) during the PEA (Appendix 8.1 of the ES).  Habitats within 
the Project Site were classified into categories dependent on the presence of 
features suitable for bats to commute and forage.  Table 1.2 provides category 
descriptions for commuting and foraging habitat.

ii. Bat Activity – Walked Transects 
1.7.25 Surveys paid due regard to Bat Surveys: Good Practice Guidelines (Collins, 2016).  
Two walked transect routes were developed to sample the Project Site, one in the 
north and one in the south. These are shown on Figures 3.1 to 3.3.  
1.7.26 Each transect was walked twice per month. Dusk activity surveys were completed 
in June, July, August, September and October 2017. One dusk and dawn survey 
within one 24 hour period was completed in September 2017.  
1.7.27 No surveys were completed in April and May 2017 due to the late commencement 
of the Project. Activity surveys following the methodology above are due to be 
undertaken in April and May 2018.  
1.7.28 Each survey consisted of two surveyors walking a pre-determined transect route at 
a steady pace across the Project Site. The start point and direction of each transect 
was varied across the months to reduce bias. 
1.7.29 The transect contained set Listening Points (LPs) which the surveyors stopped at 
for three minutes. Each transect contained 12 LPs, with the exception of the first 
set of surveys in June which had 11 LPs (see Section 1.8, Limitations). The 
locations of the LPs are shown on Figures 3.1 to 3.3.  
1.7.30 Tables 1.23 and 1.24 describe the habitat at each of the LPs. 
1.7.31 Dusk transect surveys began 15 minutes before sunset and continued for up to 3 
hours after sunset, except for one occasion (see Section 1.8, Limitations). The 
dawn transect started at least 2 hours before sunrise and continued until sunrise, 
except on one occasion (see Limitations).   
1.7.32 A broadband frequency division detector was used (Bat Box Duet with EM3) and 
digital recordings made to assist with species identification if required.   
1.7.33 The weather conditions for all but one of the surveys (see Section 1.8, Limitations) 
completed to date was considered to be favourable for bats. The weather 
conditions and survey dates are given in Table 1.3. 
iii. Bat Activity – Static Detector Surveys 
1.7.34 Surveys paid due regard to Bat Surveys for Professional Ecologists: Good Practice 
Guidelines (Collins, 2016). Nine static detector locations were selected within the 
Project Site to incorporate a range of habitats and give spatial coverage of the 
Project Site. The locations of the static detectors are shown in Figure 3.4. 
1.7.35 Static detector surveys were completed in June, July, August, September and 
October 2017.  
1.7.36 The dates of the static detector surveys were: 
 
June 26 – 01 July 2017; 
Abergelli ES 2018 – BAT ACTIVITY AND ROOST SURVEY

AECOM 
14 
 
 
 
24 July – 29 July 2017; 
 
23 August 2017 – 01 September 2017; 
 
12 September 2017 – 18 September 2017; and,  
 
17 October - 21 October 2017. 
1.7.37 No surveys were completed in April and May 2017 due to the late commencement 
of the Project.  Activity surveys following the methodology above are due to be 
undertaken in April and May 2018.  
1.7.38 The static detectors were set to begin recording 30 minutes before sunset and 
continue until 30 minutes after sunrise for a period of five consecutive nights 
(Collins, 2016). Some equipment failures reduced the static detector recording time 
(see Limitations and Appendix 3A). 
1.7.39 Full spectrum frequency detectors (Wildlife Acoustics Song Meter 2 (SM2/SM2+) 
with sample rate 384kHz) and ultrasonic SMX-U1 omnidirectional microphones 
were used to obtain digital recordings of bat echolocation calls in order to 
determine the species present at each Static Detector Location. 
e) Data Analysis and Interpretation 
1.7.40 Bat echolocation call analysis where required was undertaken by a suitably 
experienced ecologist, with support from reference material including the British Bat 
Calls Species Identification Guide (Russ, 2012).   
1.7.41 The AnalookW software programme (version 4.2n) was used to analyse bat 
echolocation calls.  A series of custom made filters in Analook were applied to the 
bat echolocation call data. All calls were manually checked once filters had been 
applied, and any additional or incorrect calls were relabelled. 
1.7.42 Long-eared bats have very quiet echolocation calls and these are often not 
recorded on bat detectors but may be audible using bat detectors. Where long-
eared bats are suspected but the echolocation call has not been recorded then the 
long-eared bat (possible) category has been used. This is shown in Tables 1.8 to 
1.12. 
1.7.43 There are six resident species of Myotid bat in Britain.  Myotid bats are difficult to 
identify to species level as the echolocation calls can have overlapping frequencies 
and can be visually similar when viewed on bat echolocation call software, such as 
Analook.  Therefore all Myotid bat echolocation calls were grouped together for the 
purposes of calculating Bat Activity Index (BAI). 
1.7.44 Where possible, calls with characteristics of specific Myotid bats were noted to 
inform the species composition within the Project Site.  
1.7.45 For the walked transect data, a BAI was calculated as the number of passes 
divided by the survey time in ‘hours’.  Survey time was calculated to the nearest 15 
minutes, expressed as 0.25 hours, to account for minor differences in survey 
duration (see Section 1.8, Limitations). 
Abergelli ES 2018 – BAT ACTIVITY AND ROOST SURVEY 
 
 
Prepared for:  Abergelli Power Limited 
AECOM 
15 
 
 
1.7.46 For the static detector survey data, a BAI was calculated as the number of passes 
divided by the survey time in ‘nights’.  Survey time was calculated to the nearest 
0.5 nights, to account for differences in survey duration (see Section 1.8, 
Limitations and Appendix 3A).  The half way point for each night was calculated 
using the start and finish time. If the static detector failed before the half way point 
then 0.5 of a night was used in the BAI calculations.  If the static detector failed 
after the half way time point the whole night was used in the BAI calculations.   
1.7.47 Bat activity is an indication of the amount of use bats make of an area (Collins, 
2016). A bat pass is defined by BCT as a sequence of greater than two 
echolocation calls made as a single bat flies past the microphone (BCT, 2017).  A 
bat pass is an index of bat activity rather than a measure of number of individuals in 
a population (Collins, 2016).  
1.7.48 The statistics software programme ‘R’ (R Core Team, 2013) was used to assist data 
interpretation and to help look for statistically significant differences and/or 
relationships. This was completed by an ecologist with appropriate statistical 
knowledge and experience of the programme. 
1.7.49 Due to the variation in successful recording nights, statistical tests could only be 
completed from the first night of data from each static detector, for each month.   
1.7.50 The data was assessed for normal distribution and the most appropriate statistical 
tests applied. The data was not normally distributed and therefore non parametric 
tests, Kruskal-Wallis and Mann Whitney-Wilcoxon, were used. 
1.7.51 Calculated values within this report have been given to one decimal place, except 
for survey times in Table 1.13, BAI totals in Table 1.18 and BAI values in Table 1.20.

1.8 
Limitations 
1.8.1 
Biological records can be received from a wide variety of sources and may or may 
not be comprehensive and accurate.  However, if assessed in conjunction with a 
survey, they can contribute to a robust ecological assessment of a site.   
a) 
Suitable Roost Feature Climbed Inspection Survey  
1.8.2 
There are 16 trees which were not climbed due to access and/or health and safety 
restrictions and there are two trees which were not climbed as they could not be 
found due to dense woodland, however were the subject of emergence survey at a 
later date.  These trees did not have their bat roost suitability category altered from 
the original assigned category and all trees with Moderate suitability subsequently 
had emergence/re-entry surveys. Therefore this is not deemed to be a significant 
limitation. 
b) 
Roost Survey  
1.8.3 
Building 1 did not have a full Ground Level Preliminary Assessment due to time 
constraints (Appendix 8.1 of the ES). However this building is approximately 120m 
outside of the Project Site boundary and no further surveys were considered 
necessary on this building. Therefore this is not a significant limitation.  
1.8.4 
Access was not granted to Buildings 7 and 8 (collectively known as Abergelli Farm) 
to the west of, but outside of the Project Site boundary and these could not be 
assessed for their suitability to support roosting bats.  However, these buildings 
(BSG Buildings 4 and 5) were previously assessed by BSG (PB, 2015) (see Table 
1.4).  The previous results will be used in the assessment. These buildings will be 
subject to emergence and re-entry surveys in 2018.  
c) Bat Activity Walked Transect Survey 
1.8.5 
The first set of June walked transect surveys had 11 LPs per transect, this was 
increased to 12 LPs per transect for all subsequent surveys.  This was done to 
increase the spread of sample points.  This is not deemed to be a significant 
limitation to the surveys or this report.  
1.8.6 
On 10 July 2017 during the Northern Transect the SD recording card briefly came 
out of the EM3 bat detector and calls during that period were not recorded 
electronically.  However, this was replaced and all bats heard during the period 
were recorded on the survey sheet and were of common species which the 
surveyor was able to determine species identification with confidence.  This is not 
deemed to be a significant limitation to the survey or the results.   
1.8.7 
On 13 September 2017 the dawn South Transect survey finished at 06:42 which 
was 5 minutes before sunrise, however no bats had been heard since 06:16 and 
therefore this is not deemed to be a significant limitation. 
Abergelli ES 2018 – BAT ACTIVITY AND ROOST SURVEY 
 
 
Prepared for:  Abergelli Power Limited 
AECOM 
20 
 
 
1.8.8 
On a small number of occasions surveyors walked past an LPs or LPs were not 
accessible meaning that bat data was not recorded for 3 minutes at that location. 
For calculations of Bat Activity Index, the survey time at each LP has been adjusted 
to reflect this variation and will mitigate the impact of this limitation of the 
comparisons of bat activity between LPs. The occasions are listed below:  
 
On 10 July 2017 North Transect LP 4 was missed;   
 
On 23 August and 7, 11 and 12 September 2017, North Transect LP1 was not 
accessible due to horses being present in the field. A replacement LP was 
completed as close as possible to the original location at LP1a, as shown on 
Figure 5.2; 
 
On 7 and 13 September 2017 LP7 on the South Transect not accessible due to 
the presence of rams in the field.  On 7 September 2017, LP9 was missed, this 
was replaced with LP9a (see Table 1. 12, LP9a and Figure 5. 3).  As LP9 was 
replaced with another LP close to the original location, this is not deemed to be 
a significant limitation;  
 
On 3 October 2017, LP9 was missed, this was replaced with LP9b (See Table 
1.12, LP9b and Figure 5. 3).  As LP9 was replaced with another LP close to the 
original location, this is not deemed to be a significant limitation.  
1.8.9 
No surveys were completed in April and May 2017 due to the late commencement 
of the Project.  Best practice guidelines recommend transect surveys are 
undertaken between April and October (Collins, 2016).  Activity walked transect 
surveys following the methodology described above are due to be undertaken in 
April and May 2018.   
1.8.10 The weather conditions encountered on the dusk transect surveys on 13 
September 2017 (see Table 1.3) were not considered wholly favourable for bats, 
but not so bad as to need to abandon the survey.  There was light rain at 21:33 and 
a spell of heavy rain between 21:50 and 22:17.  The North Transect was also 
sampled at dusk on 11 September 2017 in September in favourable weather 
conditions. 
1.8.11 It was not possible to incorporate land within the National Grid land within a walked 
bat activity transect due to due to site access restrictions at night and during the 
early morning.   
d) Bat Activity Static Detector Survey 
1.8.12 Some of the static detectors did not record for the full five night period. Details of 
malfunctions and reduced survey nights are provided in Appendix 3A Static 
Detector Limitations.  
1.8.13 No data was recorded at South 3 in June 2017 and South 1 in July 2017.  
1.8.14 Data in these locations was successfully collected in the other 4 months. 
1.8.15 No data was recorded at:  Lane 2 in August and September 2017.  Two other static 
detectors (Lane 1 and Lane 3) were positioned within the Lane and have captured 
bat activity which is representative of the Lane.

e) Data Analysis and Interpretation 
1.8.16 Different bat species vary in their likelihood of detection using bat detectors and 
therefore it is not relevant to compare numbers of bat passes from different species 
(Collins, 2016).   
1.8.17 Results of the statistical analysis could only utilise the first night of data for each 
location in each month, due to the variation in successful recording nights. 
Therefore, the results are less powerful than if the full five nights could have been 
compared. However, the statistical analysis provides an additional tool, alongside 
BAI and count data in the interpretation of bat activity.

Previous surveys have been undertaken by BSG Ecology. See 
Appendix 8.8 of the ES. 
 
The Site boundary included within these reports is different to the 
2017 Project Site boundary. The 2017 Project Site is smaller than 
the red line boundary used by BSG in 2014, however lies entirely 
within the area covered by the 2014 BSG surveys. A summary of 
the previous bat species surveys is detailed below:

Description 
Eleven buildings with bat roost potential were identified.  Internal 
inspections of buildings confirmed non- maternity roosts in three 
buildings. These are shown in Appendix 2A: 
 BSG Building 4: A scattering of long-eared bat, pipistrelle and 
lesser horseshoe bat droppings were found in the store rooms; 
 BSG Building 8: Small piles of long-eared bat and pipistrelle 
droppings found in both first and second storey at the north of 
the building; and,  
 BSG Building 10: Two pipistrelle droppings were found on the 
floor.  
 
BSG Building 1, 2, 5 and 11 were categorised as having 
Moderate bat roost potential.  BSG Building 7 was categorised as 
having Low bat roost potential.  BSG Building 3 and 9 were 
categorised as having Negligible bat roost potential (Hundt, 
2012). 
The buildings identified by BSG in 2014 fall outside of the 2017 
Project Site.  However, some of these buildings adjacent to the 
Project Site have been reassessed by AECOM in 2017.  Details 
are provided in Table 1.5.   
 
Tree – Ground Level Roost Assessments 
Thirty three trees were considered to have potential to support 
roosting bats.  29 of these were subject to a climbed inspection. 
Emergence and/or re-entry surveys were carried out on eight 
trees.  BSG Trees T3, T4 and T9 are located within the 2017 
Project Site.  No bats were recorded emerging or re-entering any 
potential roost features. No tree roosts were identified. Trees 
within the Project Site have been reassessed by AECOM in 2017.  
Details are provided in Section 1.11.  
Bat Activity Walked Transect Surveys 
At least seven species of bat were recorded during transect 
surveys; common pipistrelle, soprano pipistrelle, Myotis sp., long-
eared bat, noctule, Leisler’s bat, and lesser horseshoe bat.  All of 
these species and an additional three were recorded during 
automated 
static 
detector 
surveys; 
Nathusius’ 
pipistrelle 
Pipistrellus nathusii, serotine Eptesicus serotinus and greater

1.9.2 
Six buildings were assessed for their potential to support roosting bats in 2017 and 
11 buildings were assessed by BSG in 2014.  The results of the assessment are 
provided in Table 1.5.  
1.9.3 
Building locations are provided in Figure 2. A map showing the AECOM 2017 
results is provided in Figure 4.1 and a map showing the 2014 BSG building 
locations is provided in Figure 4.2. 
1.9.4 
Access was not granted to Buildings 7 and 8 (known as Abergelli Farm) in 2017 
(outside the Project Site) and therefore these could not be assessed for their 
potential to support roosting bats in 2017.  Details are given in Section 1.8 
Limitations.   
1.9.5 
In November 2017, a trial shaft and adit, adjacent to the Project Site was identified. 
Underground sites can be of value to hibernating bats, including horseshoe, long-
eared and Myotis species. The approximate locations mine shaft and adit are 
shown in Figure 6.  These were assessed for their suitability to support roosting 
bats in March 2018. The adit is sealed, with no potential for underground 
hibernation and this has been capped and filled in. The adit is close to Building 4.  
The trial shaft entrance was located and a depression in the ground which was 
grassed over was visible. Historical maps had identified that the trail shaft had been 
dug to 57ft and 6 inches and backfilled. There were no access points for bats. The 
trail shaft is not suitable for hibernation.

ii. Bat Roosts in Trees 
Trees - Preliminary Ground Level Roost Assessment 
1.9.8 
The results of the Preliminary Ground Level Roost Assessment are provided in 
Appendix 1A.  
Trees - Potential Roost Feature Climbed Inspections 
1.9.9 
All trees with Low or Moderate bat roost suitability were put forward for climbed 
inspection.  A full table of results from the climbed inspections are provided in 
Appendix 1A.  
1.9.10 All trees inspected were reduced to Negligible or Low bat roost suitability. No bat 
roosts were identified.   
1.9.11 Trees 3, 19, 21, 36 and 44 could not be accessed and therefore retained their 
original Moderate rating. These trees were taken forward for emergence and re-
entry surveys, in the absence of the climbed inspection assessment.  
1.9.12 Trees with Low bat roost suitability do not require further survey but may need to be 
checked for roosting bats before removal.   
Emergence/Re-entry Surveys 
1.9.13 The results of the emergence /re-entry surveys are provide in Table 1.7. The 
locations of the trees and the roost results are shown on Figure 4.   
1.9.14 Of the five trees surveyed, one bat roost was confirmed in Tree 19.  Whilst the bat 
was seen entering the tree, no calls were detected. This is possibly due to the 
distance of the tree canopy from the surveyor, and the angle of the bat from the 
detector. It has been concluded that the species is likely to be a common pipistrelle, 
because a brief common pipistrelle pass was heard approximately nine seconds 
before the roosting bat was seen flying around and then disappearing into the 
crown of Tree 19.  
1.9.15 A Photograph of Tree 19 is provided in Plate 1.1.

iv. Static Detector Surveys 
1.9.24 The Static Detector Locations are shown in Figure 3.4.  
1.9.25 The results of the static detector surveys are presented in Tables 1.17 to 1.22.  
1.9.26 33,764 bat passes were recorded at the Project Site between June and October 
2017.  A total of 173.5 recording nights were completed.  
1.9.27 Table 1.17 and 1.19 display the count of bat passes for each species or species 
group. 
1.9.28 Table 1.18 displays the BAI for each species or species group.  
1.9.29 Tables 1.20 to 1.21 display BAI, expressed as bat passes per night.  
1.9.30 Table 1.20 displays BAI (passes/night), by Static Detector Location. 
1.9.31 Table 1.21 displays BAI (passes/night), by month. 
1.9.32 Table 1.22 displays the bat passes and BAI for each Static Detector Location 
Group. 
1.9.33 Appendix 4A Tables 2.2 to 2.6 provide the results of the Kruskal-Wallis and Mann 
Whitney-Wilcoxon non parametric tests.   
1.9.34 Plates 1. 2 and 1.3 displays box plots for bat passes (shown on the y axis as bat 
call frequency) for location and month, respectively.   
1.9.35 Plates 1. 4 and 1.5 display box plots for bat species richness for location and 
month, respectively. Bat species richness is defined as the number of different bat 
species recorded at each location.  
1.9.36 A Site Assessment Summary is provided in Section 1.10.

Preliminary Project Site Assessment 
a) Bat Roosts 
i. 
Bat Roosts in Buildings  
1.10.1 There are no buildings, and hence no building bat roosts, within the Project Site.  
1.10.2 Buildings adjacent to the Project Site were assessed. None of the buildings 
surveyed by AECOM supported bat roosts. Previous surveys by BSG in 2014 
confirmed roosts in buildings not surveyed by AECOM in 2017 (Appendix 8.8 of the 
ES). This is expressed in Table 1.6 and shown on Figure 4.2:  
ii. Bat Roosts in Trees 
1.10.3 Tree 19 is a lone male or non-breeding female common pipistrelle summer roost.  
No other trees were identified as bat roosts. A photograph of Tree 19 is shown in 
Plate 1.1.  
b) Bat Activity – Species Composition 
1.10.4 At least 13 species of bat were recorded foraging and/or commuting in close 
proximity of and within the Project Site.  The following species have been identified 
during bat surveys at the Project Site: 
 
Greater horseshoe 
 
Lesser horseshoe; 
 
Common pipistrelle; 
 
Soprano pipistrelle; 
 
Nathusius’ pipistrelle; 
 
Daubenton’s; 
 
Natterer’s; 
 
Mytois species; (including calls with characteristics of Bechstein's, Brandt's 
Myotis brandti and Whiskered Myotis mystacinus); 
 
Noctule; 
 
Serotine; 
 
Leisler’s; 
 
Long-eared species; and, 
 
Indeterminate species.

i. 
Pipistrelle species  
1.10.5 Common and soprano pipistrelles were the most commonly recorded species in the 
Project Site.  Overall pipistrelle species comprised 86.8 % of all passes recorded 
on the walked transect surveys and 93.9% of the static detector surveys.  They 
were also the most commonly recorded species during the emergence/re-entry 
surveys.  Pipistrelle species comprised of 89.5% of the passes recorded on the 
North Transect and 84.6% of the passes recorded on the South Transect.   
1.10.6 Pipistrelle species were similarly the most commonly recorded species during the 
BSG 2014 transect and static detector surveys (Appendix 8.8 of the ES).  
1.10.7 Two passes of Nathusius' pipistrelle were recorded during the July transect 
surveys, one record from the South Transect and one record from the North 
Transect, making up 0.2% of total bat passes. 
1.10.8 One pass of Nathusius' pipistrelle was recorded at Lane 1 in June and one pass of 
Nathusius' pipistrelle at North 2 in October, making up <0.1% of the total bat 
passes.  
1.10.9 One pass of Nathusius' pipistrelle was recorded during the BSG static detector 
surveys in 2014 at Location D8 (ES Appendix 8.8)).  Location D8 is in a similar area 
to the AECOM South 1.  Nathusius' pipistrelle were not identified during the BSG 
2014 activity transect surveys (Appendix 8.8 of the ES).  
ii. Myotis species 
1.10.10 Myotis species comprised 9.8% of the total calls recorded on the transect surveys. 
Myotis species comprised 7.7% of the passes recorded on the North Transect and 
11.5% of the calls recorded on the South Transect  
1.10.11 Activity levels for Myotis species during the 2017 transects surveys were 
comparable with the activity levels recorded during the BSG 2014 transect surveys 
(Appendix 8.8 of the ES).  
1.10.12 A total of 1881 Myotid bat passes, 5.6% of the total calls, were recorded during the 
static detector surveys. Myotis species were recorded in every month, with the 
highest level of activity recorded in July with BAI of 20.6, and the second highest 
level recorded in June with a BAI of 17.0. 
1.10.13 Some of the Myotid bat echolocation calls from the static detector surveys were 
considered to have characteristics of Bechstein's (85 passes), Brandt's (50 passes) 
and whiskered (87 passes). BSG did not identify Myotis to species level (Appendix 
8.8 of the ES).  
iii. Noctule, Serotine, and Lieslers Species 
Abergelli ES 2018 – BAT ACTIVITY AND ROOST SURVEY 
 
 
Prepared for:  Abergelli Power Limited 
AECOM 
53 
 
 
1.10.14 Noctule and serotine bats comprised 1.8% of the passes recorded on walked 
transect surveys. Noctule and serotine bats comprised of 1.9% of the passes 
recorded on the North Transect and 1.8% of the passes recorded on the South 
Transect.  BSG did not breakdown these species into percentages (Appendix 8.8 of 
the ES).  
1.10.15 Noctule, serotine and Leisler's (N/S/L) bats comprised 0.4% of the passes recorded 
during the static detector surveys.  
1.10.16 Noctule, serotine and Leisler's were recorded during the BSG 2014 static detector 
surveys Serotine were not identified during the BSG 2014 activity transect surveys 
(ES Appendix 8.8).  
iv. Long-eared Species 
1.10.17 Long-eared and possible long-eared bat comprised a total of 0.5% of the passes 
recorded on the North Transect and 0.6% recorded on the South Transect   
surveys.  BSG did not breakdown these species into percentages (Appendix 8.8 of 
the ES). 
1.10.18 Long-eared bats comprised 0.1% of the passes recorded during the static detector 
surveys.  
v. Horseshoe Bat Species  
1.10.19 There was a single lesser horseshoe bat pass recorded on the South Transect, 
equating to 0.2% of the total passes for the South Transect and 0.1% of the total 
passes for the Project Site.  This was recorded in August 2017.  BSG 2014 also 
recorded only one lesser horseshoe bat pass, again recorded on the BSG south 
transect (Appendix 8.8 of the ES). 
1.10.20 A total of 14 lesser horseshoe passes were recorded during the static detector 
survey:  
 
Three passes recorded in July; one pass at South 3 and two passes at Lane 3; 
 
Eight passes recorded in August; six passes at South 2, one pass at South 3 
and one pass at Lane 1:  
 
Two passes in September:  one at Lane 1 and one at Lane 3; and  
 
One pass in October at Lane 3.   
1.10.21 BSG recorded a single lesser horseshoe pass at Location D3 (Appendix 8.8 of the 
ES), which is in a similar area to AECOM South 3.   
1.10.22 Greater horseshoe was not detected during the walked transect survey. A single 
greater horseshoe pass was recorded at Lane 2 in July during the static detector 
surveys. BSG recorded two greater horseshoe passes in 2014, in Locations D5 and 
D8 (Appendix 8.8 of the ES). Location D5 was located along the Gallops near to 
Abergelli Farm and is not comparable with any of the AECOM locations as this is 
outside of the Project Site Boundary.  Location D8 is relatively close to AECOM 
South 1.

c) Bat Activity – Spatial Distribution 
1.10.23 Figure 5.1 shows the spatial distribution of individual bat passes recorded during 
the transect surveys. Figure 3.4 shows the static detector locations. 
1.10.24 In total 940 bat passes were recorded during the walked transects.   
1.10.25 Higher levels of activity were recorded in the Southern Transect (513 bat passes; 
15.2 BAI), compared to the Northern Transect (427 bat passes, 13. 2 BAI). The bat 
activity levels are broadly similar.  
1.10.26 In total 33,764 bat passes were recorded during the static detector surveys.  Table 
1.22 gives the bat activity by the Static Detector Location Groups. Higher levels of 
activity were recorded in the Southern Static Detector Locations (7,779 total bat 
passes; 148.2 BAI), compared to the Northern Static Detector Locations (5,847 
total bat passes, 87.3 BAI), reflecting the pattern of the walked transect. 
1.10.27  Using the first night data from static detector surveys, the species richness 
recorded across different locations was not statistically significant (Appendix 4A: 
Table 2.5). Therefore, similarly to the walked transect results, the bat activity levels 
between North and South are broadly similar.  
1.10.28 The highest level of activity was recorded in the Lane Static Detector Locations 
(20,138 total bat passes, 372.9 BAI). The Lane Static Detector Locations (even with 
the equipment malfunctions, see Limitations) had higher levels of activity compared 
to both the North and South Static Detector Locations combined. This may be 
because the Lane is likely used for foraging, along the sheltered woodland edge, 
and detectors may have been recording multiple passes by the same bats up and 
down the Lane.  
1.10.29 During the walked transects bat activity was recorded across the Project Site 
(Figure 5.1). Vegetated stream or wet ditch corridors appear to be important for 
bats within the Project Site. The distribution of bat call suggests the following 
general patterns of activity. This is a qualitative assessment only: 
 
Pipistrelle bats were recorded across the Project Site;  
 
Myotis Species showed some association with mature tree lines and/or areas 
near water; 
 
Noctule and Serotine bats were primarily recorded at height over open fields 
across the Project Site; 
 
Long-eared bats showed some association with mature tree lines and are 
focused more towards the centre and south-east of the Project Site.  The 
passes recorded are within approximately 315m to 700m of the BSG confirmed 
long-eared roost in Building 7 and approximately 270m and 850m of the BSG 
confirmed long-eared roost in Building 2;  
 
The single lesser horseshoe was recorded on the South Transect along a 
mature tree line approximately 900m south of the closest known lesser 
horseshoe roost in Building 2.

 
Myotis species were recorded across the Project Site; 
 
Noctule, Serotine and Leisler bats were recorded across the Project Site ;  
 
Long-eared bats were recorded at the majority of Static Detector Location 
except for North 1 and Lane 2;  
 
The single greater horseshoe was recorded at Lane 2 in the south-west of the 
Project Site; and 
 
Lesser horseshoe bats were recorded within the south and south-west of the 
Project Site at South 2, South 3, Lane 1 and Lane 2.

d) Bat Activity – Temporal Distribution 
1.10.46 Bat activity was recorded at the Project Site between June and October 2017.  Bat 
surveys for April and May are due to be undertaken in 2018.  
1.10.47 August had the highest BAI for both transects.  The North Transect had a BAI of 8.5 
and the South Transect had a BAI of 4.8. 
1.10.48 For the North Transect, the second highest BAI was 7.0, both in June and July. 
1.10.49 For the South Transect, the second highest BAI was 3.0 in July and the third 
highest was 2.8 in October.   
1.10.50 For the static detector surveys, July had the highest BAI of 377.3, the second 
highest BAI was 238.9 in June.  
1.10.51 Higher levels of Myotis species activity in June and July during the 2017 static 
detector surveys were comparable with the higher activity levels recorded in June 
and July during the BSG 2014 static detector surveys (PB, 2015), although it 
should be noted that BSG did not have any static detectors placed within the lane 
area to the west of the Project Site.   
1.10.52 As seen in Plate 1.4 the months of August and October have a greater level of 
species richness than September. This was a statistically significant result as seen 
in Appendix 4A: Tables 2.5 and 2.6.  
1.10.53 The statistical analysis of the first night of static detector data show that bat passes 
is influenced by month (Plate 1.2  and Appendix 4A: Table 2.2). June has a 
significantly higher bat echolocation call frequency than August and October 
(Appendix 4A: Table 2.3). This result differs from the walked transect results which 
showed highest level of bat activity in July and June as the second highest. Both 
survey methods indicate that the summer months had the highest level of activity. 
This is likely due to general bat ecology, with bats being most active in mid-
summer.   
1.10.54 Young bats are typically born in June and July and during August the young are 
starting to leave the roosts to fly and feed. October is part of the bat mating period 
and a time when bats are extensively foraging for food as they are looking to store 
fat for the winter hibernation period. The general ecology of bat species is likely to 
influence the temporal activity for the Project Site.

Preliminary Potential Effects 
1.11.1 A full assessment of effects at construction and operation has been undertaken for 
the Ecological Impact Assessment (EcIA) and reported in the ES.  
1.11.2 Figure 7 indicates the location of potential constraints / impacts.  At this stage the 
following potential effects have been identified:  
a) Bat Roosts 
i. 
Destruction and Loss of a Roost 
1.11.3 Tree 19 was the only confirmed roost within the Project Site.  The Project will not 
require the removal of Tree 19.  
ii. Killing and Injury 
1.11.4 Based on the current known distribution of bat roosts within the Project Site, there 
is no risk of killing or injuring bats during construction and operation.  
iii. Disturbance 
1.11.5 Without mitigation, there is potential for disturbance to bats due to noise and 
vibration and external lighting during construction and operation.  
b) Bat Commuting and Foraging 
i. 
Habitat Loss 
1.11.6 The Project Site is used by bats, particularly the vegetated watercourse/wet ditch 
corridors, followed by woodland edges and hedgerows with mature trees.   
1.11.7 A proportion of the broadleaved semi-natural woodland, semi-improved grassland 
and marshy grassland will be removed as part of the Project. Without mitigation, 
hedgerows and mature trees lines will be removed for construction of the Electrical 
Connection and new section of Access Road. This will reduce the amount of habitat 
available to foraging bats.  
ii. External Lighting 
1.11.8 An Outline Lighting Strategy provided in Appendix 3.5 of the ES. There will be an 
increase in external lighting at the Project Site during construction and operation. 
There is currently no external lighting within the majority of the Project Site. If 
external lighting for the Project is poorly designed there is potential for a light spill 
onto hedgerows, tree lines, woodland edges and vegetated areas. Many species of 
bat are adverse to light, with different species having different tolerances. External 
lighting can make areas of previous foraging habitat unsuitable or inaccessible and 
therefore cause in-direct habitat loss.

iii. Noise 
1.11.9 There will be an increase in ambient noise at the Project Site during construction 
and operation. Construction noise will be temporary and is considered unlikely to 
impact on foraging bats in the long-term. Operational noise is discussed further 
below.  
1.11.10 The Generating Equipment will only be operational intermittently at times of peak 
demand and will not emit ultrasonic noise (ultrasonic being noise which is higher 
than the upper audible limit of human hearing, typically considered to be above 
20kHz).   
1.11.11 The Generating Equipment is predicted to emit a sound power level of around 
100dB LWA, the power peaks at a frequency of around 50/63 Hz and roughly halves 
with every doubling of frequency above that. A typical attenuated power station 
sound power spectrum is shown in Plate 1.8. This only goes up to 8,000Hz (8kHz) 
but the tail off in the spectrum continues with increased frequency, showing that 
there will be little sound power (dB LA) above 10,000Hz (10kHz).  
1.11.12 The specific sound level near the Project Site boundary is estimated to be 
approximately 55dB LAeq (ES Chapter 7 Noise – Figure 7.1) (this term is the 
Equivalent Continuous Level, a type of average, where noisy events have a 
significant influence). The theoretical average sound pressure level (dB LA) at the 
Project Site boundary approximately 30m from the Generating Equipment will be 
approximately 55 dB LA to 63 dB LA. Equivalent general sounds comparisons are: 
50 dB LA is light traffic or rainfall; 60 – 65 dB LA is normal conversation; and 85 dB 
LA is heavy traffic.

1.11.13 There is limited research on the impact of anthropogenic noise on foraging bats 
and no directly comparable research on the impacts of power station noise have 
been identified. Research that exists shows that increased anthropogenic noise can 
negatively impact foraging activity of some species of bats, particularly low 
frequency bats (<35kHz), as a result of prey masking and avoidance of noise. Two 
of these are summarised below. 
1.11.14 Bunkley et. al. (2015) investigated the potential effects of gas compressor station 
noise in the USA on the activity levels of the local bat assemblage. The gas 
compressor stations run 24 hour a day, 365 days a year. The mean background 
sound level (dB LA) recorded at 50m from the gas compressor site centre was 
between 70 and 85dB LA. The frequency of the compressor noise was 24kHz.  
1.11.15 Bunkley et. al. (2015) found that activity levels for the Brazilian free-tailed bat 
(Tadarida brasiliensis) were 40% lower at loud compressor sites compared to 
quieter well pads, whereas the activity levels of four other species (Myotis 
californicus, M. cillolabrum, M. lucifugus, Parastrellus hesperus) were not affected 
by noise. The assemblage of bat species emitting low frequency (<35kHz) 
echolocation calls showed a 70% reduction in activity levels at loud sites compared 
to quieter well pad sites whereas the assemblage using high frequency (>35kHz) 
echolocation did not exhibit altered activity levels. Bunkley et. al. (2015) concluded 
that lower activity levels of Brazilian free-tailed bats at loud sites indicate a potential 
reduction in habitat for this species and that this species modifies its echolocation 
search calls in noise, producing longer calls with a narrower bandwidth, which 
might affect prey detection.  
1.11.16 Luo et al., 2015 investigated how anthropogenic noise impairs foraging, which has 
direct consequences for animal survival and reproductive success, using 
Daubenton’s bats, which ﬁnd prey by echolocation. The study looked to identify the 
potential mechanisms of disturbance in any species capable of detecting the noise, 
namely acoustic masking of prey echoes, reduced attention and noise avoidance. 
The study used playback of traffic noise and was laboratory based. Traffic noise 
was played at around 76dB LA, at nonoverlapping frequencies below 25kHz (not 
spectrally overlapping the minimum call frequency of Daubenton’s, which is at 
28kHz), and overlapping frequencies above 25kHz. 
1.11.17 Luo et al., 2015 found that trafﬁc noise reduced foraging efﬁciency in most 
Daubenton’s bats. This effect was present even if the playback noise did not 
overlap in frequency with the prey echoes. Neither overlapping noise nor 
nonoverlapping noise inﬂuenced the search effort required for a successful prey 
capture. Hence, noise did not mask prey echoes or reduce the attention of bats. 
Instead, traffic noise acted as an aversive stimulus that caused avoidance 
response, thereby reducing foraging efﬁciency.  
1.11.18 The frequency emitted from the Generating Equipment (between 50Hz and 
10,000Hz (10kHz)) is unlikely to mask the frequencies of large bat prey items, 
which are generally in the range of 20 - 35kHz and frequencies less than 1 kHz are 
probably inaudible to bats (Luo et al., 2015).

1.11.19 Bunkley et. al. (2015) suggests that bat species emitting low frequency (<35kHz) 
echolocation calls may be more affected by noise than other species. At the Project 
Site, bats which echolocate at frequencies <35kHz include the large bats; noctule, 
serotine and Leisler's. Lower frequency bats at the Project Site make up 5.8% of 
the total composition of bat species, the rest are higher frequency bat species 
(>35kHz). However, the predicted frequencies emitted from the Generating 
Equipment (between 50Hz and 10,000Hz (10kHz)) were much lower than in 
Bunkley et. al. (2015) and, as above, are unlikely to mask prey items for any bat 
species. 
1.11.20 There may be some noise avoidance by some bat species when the Generating 
Equipment is operating, as there is little research available to be able to completely 
rule out potential avoidance from noise of 55 – 63dB LA . However, the generation 
of noise would be sporadic and the sound power anticipated at the Project Site 
boundary is lower than that in the studies summarised above and it would be 
anticipated that any impact from avoidance would therefore be comparably lower. 
No studies were identified which looked at potential foraging impacts from sound 
power (dB LA) less than 70dB LA to be able to draw any direct conclusion. 
1.11.21 At the Project Site, the sporadic nature of the noise generated with times of peak 
demans most likely to occur during winter (when bats are hibernating) during the 
early evening (16:00 – 18:00, when people get home from work and before bats 
emerge from roosts), combined with the sound power peaking at a frequency well 
below the typical frequency used by echolocating bats, it is considered that noise 
will not have a significant impact on the population of foraging bats within the 
Project Site.

iv. Severance and Fragmentation 
1.11.22 The removal of trees and woodland is required to facilitate the construction of the 
new section of Access Road. Without mitigation, this will sever the connectivity to 
habitats either side of the track, resulting in severance and fragmentation of 
retained areas.  
1.11.23 The removal of tree lines and hedgerows may be required in order to facilitate the 
construction of the Gas Connection in the north of the Project Site. Removal or 
severance of tree lines and hedgerow will sever the connectivity they provide and 
create fragmentation of retained habitat. 
1.11.24 During construction of the Project natural habitats including hedgerows and tree 
lines will be removed and converted to new areas of hardstanding and buildings.  
This will fragment and sever the connectivity of the habitats located to the north and 
to the south of the Project. This will impact on bats using the existing features in the 
landscape to commute and forage between these two areas.  
1.11.25 An Outline Lighting Strategy provided in Appendix 3.5 of the ES. There will be an 
increase in external lighting at the Project Site during construction and operation. 
There is currently no external lighting within the majority of the Project Site. Many 
species of bat are adverse to light, with different species having different 
tolerances.  External lighting can make areas of previous foraging habitat 
unsuitable and fragment commuting routes.  If external lighting for the Project is 
poorly designed there is potential for a light spill onto hedgerows, tree lines, 
woodland edges and vegetated areas which will negatively impact on bats, 
severing commuting routes and impeding access to foraging habitat.  Poorly 
designed lighting also has the potential to affect areas outside the Project Site 
boundary.

1.12 
Preliminary Recommendations for Further Surveys and Mitigation 
a) Recommendations for Further Surveys 
1.12.1 A full assessment of required further surveys has been made during EcIA and 
reported in the ES.  At this stage it is anticipated that further surveys will be 
required. The following recommendations have been made:  
 
Walked bat activity transect surveys in April and May 2018 using the same 
methodology for the walked bat activity surveys undertaken in 2017; 
 
Static detector bat surveys in April and May 2018 and assessment to augment 
the walked transect data; 
 
Building assessments and further bat surveys on Buildings  7 and 8 within the 
Abergelli Farm (schedule to be undertaken in 2018);  
 
Pre-construction checks on trees, scheduled for removal, should be assessed 
for their current bat roost suitability with consideration of the seasonal survey 
timings. 
1.12.2 Although further surveys are recommended it is considered that, utilising data from 
2014 and 2017 surveys undertaken to date, an accurate assessment of bat activity 
within the Project Site has been made. Further surveys are recommended to 
confirm that the most appropriate and effective mitigation measures have been 
determined; mitigation has been included in a Landscape and Ecological Mitigation 
Plan (LEMP). 
b) Recommendations for Mitigation 
1.12.3 A full series of recommendations for further surveys and mitigation at construction 
and operation has been undertaken for the EcIA and reported in the ES.  At this 
stage the following key recommendations have been made:  
 
Based on the current Project proposals a European Protected Species Licence 
(EPSL) is not a requirement. However, should the scope of the Project  change 
and/or if further bat roosts are identified a EPSL may be required; 
 
Compensate for loss of foraging habitat; 
 
Maintain connectivity of foraging and commuting habitats by the retention of 
trees and hedgerows wherever possible. Figure 7 shows areas of potential 
conflict; 
 
Utilising ‘brown hedgerows’ of brash, to maintain connectivity during 
construction;  
 
Create new green corridors to mitigate loss, provide alternative routes and 
enhance the local landscape;  
 
For construction of the Electrical Connection consider directional drilling under 
hedgerows and mature tree lines to avoid felling and avoid severance; 
 
If less important hedgerows need to be severed temporarily during construction 
of the Electrical Connection the severed areas should be replanted with whips 
and standards; 
 
It is recommended that reasonable avoidance measures should be taken if any 
trees with a Low bat roost potential need removing as part of the Project 
(Hundt, 2012).  This is likely to include soft-felling of trees under ecological 
supervision from a bat licenced ecologist; 
Abergelli ES 2018 – BAT ACTIVITY AND ROOST SURVEY

 
Plant a mix of locally native species of standard trees and whips along both 
sides of the new section of Access Road to create a ‘hedgerow with trees’; and, 
 
Avoid external lighting wherever possible. Only light areas which need to be lit 
to meet minimum standard. Where external lighting is needed it should be 
designed to avoid and reduce light spill following best practice guidelines for 
lighting and bats (Gunnell 2012, BCT 2009), and should be reviewed by an 
ecologist. Where external road lighting is needed the use of bollards with 
louveres should be considered to keep lighting directional and below head 
height, timer or motion sensors should be used. 
c) Recommendations for Biodiversity Enhancement  
1.12.4 A full series of recommendations for biodiversity enhancement has been made 
during the EcIA and reported in the ES.  At this stage the following precautionary 
recommendations have been made:  
 
Woodcrete bat boxes on trees; 
 
Improve existing hedgerows by infilling with locally native species standard 
trees to maintain connectivity to key foraging areas; and, 
 
Creation of new hedgerows and green corridors of locally native species.

Bat Survey Update Report  
1.1 
Introduction  
1.1.1 
AECOM was commissioned to undertake a suite of ecological survey work to 
inform the Abergelli Power Project (the “Project”).  
1.1.2 
Previous bat surveys have been undertaken by BSG Ecology in 2014 which are 
presented in Appendix 8.1 of the ES and AECOM in 2017 (ES Appendix 8.7).  
1.1.3 
This report is provided as an update to the Bat Report submitted as part of the 
Environmental Statement in May 2018 (ES Appendix 8.7). Additional bat surveys 
have been undertaken since submission, and this document now reflects these  
results. 
1.1.4 
The Project Site is located near to the village of Felindre, Swansea, as shown in 
Figure 1.1. The central grid reference for the Project Site is SN65280143. 
1.1.5 
The Preliminary Ecological Appraisal (PEA) Report (Appendix 8.1 of the ES) 
identified that surveys for bats were required at the Project Site.  The Project Site 
was assessed as having ‘High’ commuting and foraging potential (Collins, 2016).  
Four buildings (outside of, but adjacent to the Project Site Boundary) were 
assessed as having the potential to support roosting bats (Appendix 8.1 of the ES).  
1.1.6 
This baseline report outlines the presence of bat species within the Project Site 
Boundary and makes initial indications of potential effects and outlines initial 
recommendations for further surveys, mitigation and enhancement.   
1.1.7 
The bat survey encompasses suitable habitat in close proximity to and within the 
Project Site Boundary, as shown on Figure 1 and Figures 3.1-3.4.  
1.2 
Site Description 
1.2.1 
The Project Site supports semi-natural broadleaved and plantation woodland, rows 
of broadleaved trees, standalone broadleaved trees, dense and scattered scrub, 
improved and semi-improved grassland and marshy grassland, tall ruderal, running 
water ditches, ponds, species-rich hedgerow with trees, species-poor hedgerow 
with trees, species-poor intact hedgerows, earth banks, fences and bare ground 
(hard standing). In order to cover the Project Site adequately two walked transects 
were undertaken and nine static detector monitoring locations were established 
across the Project Site. 
1.2.2 
The walked transect North (Figure 3.1) predominantly encompasses improved 
grassland fields with hedgerows and mature tree lines. It also includes a few areas 
of dense scrub, semi-improved neutral grassland, and a running water ditch (which 
is connected to the Afon Llan watercourse outside of the Project Site) and a tree 
lined minor road and track.

1.2.3 
The walked transect South (Figure 3.1) predominantly encompasses; marshy and 
improved grassland fields with hedgerows and treelines, with ancient and semi-
natural woodland. It also includes semi-improved neutral grassland and areas of 
scattered scrub.  There are three running water ditches and the walked transect 
runs adjacent to a an area of running water on the eastern Project Site Boundary 
which connects to the Afon Llan watercourse, which is outside of the Project Site. 
1.2.4 
Plates 1.6 and 1.7 show examples of the transect habitats. 
1.2.5 
The nine static detector monitoring locations were placed on field boundaries 
across the Project Site, sampling improved grassland, semi-improved grassland, 
marshy grassland, field boundaries, woodland edges and trees lines. Table 1.25 
describes the habitats around each static detector location and locations of the 
static detectors are shown in Figure 3.4. 
1.3 
The Project  
1.3.1 
Full details of the Project and Site Description are provided in Chapter 3: Project & 
Site Description. 
1.4 
 Objectives of the Study  
1.4.1 
The objectives of this study were: 
 To identify nature conservation sites within the Project Site or within 10km of 
the Project Site Boundary designated for bats; 
 To identify any known records and/or populations of bats within the Project Site 
or within 2km of the Project Site Boundary; 
 To establish the presence of any bat roosts within the Project Site; 
 To establish bat species composition within the Project Site; 
 To record and map spatial distribution and temporal bat activity within the 
Project Site;  
 To highlight any potential ecological constraints in respect to bats; 
 To outline further survey work that may be required; and, 
 To make suggestions for mitigation, compensation and enhancement of the 
natural features identified within the Project Site in respect to bats.    
1.5 
Legislation 
1.5.1 
All bats and their roosts in Wales are fully protected under Schedule 5 of the 
Wildlife and Countryside Act 1981 (as amended). They are also included in 
Schedule 2 of the Conservation of Habitats and Species Regulations 2017, known 
as The Habitats Regulations. The Wildlife and Countryside Act 1981 was amended 
by the Countryside and Rights of Way Act 2000 (CRoW) which adds an extra 
offence of recklessly disturbing roosting bats or obstructing access to their roosts; 
makes species offences arrestable, increases the time limits for some prosecutions 
and increases penalties.  
Abergelli BAT ACTIVITY AND ROOST UPDATE SURVEY 
 
 
Prepared for:  Abergelli Power Limited 
AECOM 
7 
 
 
1.5.2 
The Wildlife and Countryside Act, the Habitats Regulations and the CRoW Act, 
together make it an offence, among other things, to recklessly, deliberately or 
intentionally:  
 Capture, injure or kill any wild animal which is a European Protected Species 
(EPS), 
 Distrub wild animal of any such species; and 
1.5.3 
Damage or destroy a breeding or resting site of any such animal. Disturbance is 
defined as that which is likely: 
 To impair their ability: 
 To survive, to breed or reproduce, or to rear or nurture their young, or 
 In the case of animals of a hibernating or migratory species, to hibernate or 
migrate; or 
 To affect significantly the local distribution or abundance of the species to 
which they belong. 
1.5.4 
A bat roost is defined as “any structure or place (including trees) which any bat 
uses for shelter and protection”.  Because bats tend to re-use the same roosts, 
legal opinion is that the roost is protected whether or not the bat(s) are present at 
the time.  
1.5.5 
If the Project is likely to destroy or disturb bats or their roosts, then a European 
Protected Species License (EPSL) will be required from Natural Resources Wales 
(NRW), which would be subject to appropriate mitigation and working methods to 
protect bats.  
1.5.6 
This is a brief summary of the legislation.  When dealing with individual cases, the 
client is advised to consult the full texts of the relevant legislation and obtain further 
legal advice. 
1.6 
Quality Assurance 
1.6.1 
This survey and subsequent report was undertaken in line with AECOM’s 
Integrated Management System (IMS).  Our IMS places great emphasis on 
professionalism, technical excellence, quality, environmental and Health and Safety 
management.  All staff members are committed to establishing and maintaining our 
certification to the international standards BS EN ISO 9001:2015 and 14001:2004 
and BS OHSAS 18001:2007.  In addition, our IMS requires careful selection and 
monitoring of the performance of all sub-consultants and contractors.   
1.6.2 
All AECOM Ecologists who worked on this project are members of (at the 
appropriate level) the Chartered Institute of Ecology and Environmental 
Management (CIEEM) and follow their code of professional conduct (CIEEM, 2017) 
when undertaking ecological work.

1.7 
Methodology 
a) Desk study 
1.7.1 
The desk study was completed as part of the AECOM PEA (Appendix 8.1 of the 
ES).  In relation to bats, the objectives of the desk study were to review the existing 
information available in the public domain to identify the following: 
 Special Areas of Conservation (SACs) and Sites of Special Scientific Interest 
(SSSIs) designated for bats within a 10km radius of the Project Site Boundary 
paying due regard to Bat Conservation Trust (BCT) guidelines (Collins, 2016), 
using the Multi Agency Geographic Information for the Countryside (MAGIC) 
website (NE, 2017);  
 Bat records up to 2km from the Project Site Boundary, purchased from the 
South East Wales Biodiversity Records Centre (SEWBReC);  
 Ancient Semi-Natural Woodland (ASNW), Plantation on Ancient Woodland Site 
(PAWS), Restored Ancient Woodland Site (RAWS) or Ancient Woodland Site 
of Unknown category (AWSU) within or adjacent to the Project Site using 
Ancient Woodland Inventory 2011 dataset downloaded from the Lle website 
(WG and NRW, 2017); 
 The Section 7 list of species of Principal Importance for Conservation of 
Biological Diversity in Wales; and, 
 Features of ecological interest surrounding the Project Site, and features 
connecting these habitats (e.g. hedgerows, watercourses, railway lines) using 
aerial photographs and Ordnance Survey (OS) maps.   
1.7.2 
The County Ecologist and Glamorgan Bat Group were consulted regarding locally 
designated site citations, local bat records not available from SEWBReC and any 
local knowledge about the area. 
1.7.3 
Appendix 8.8 of the ES which contains the previous bat surveys undertaken by 
BSG Ecology in 2014 was provided by the client and reviewed. 
b) Bat Roosts in Buildings 
i. 
Preliminary Ground Level Roost Assessments 
1.7.4 
There are no buildings within the Project Site. Buildings adjacent (adjacent is 
defined as up to 20m from the Project Site Boundary) to the Project Site Boundary 
were classified into categories dependent on the presence of features suitable as 
bat roost habitat.   
1.7.5 
The assessment was conducted via an external appraisal from the ground using 
binoculars where necessary.  Table 1.1 provides descriptions of the roost potential 
categories for buildings.

ii. Internal Inspection 
1.7.6 
A bat licenced ecologist conducted an internal inspection of Building 7. A systematic 
search was made of the interior of the building to identify potential or actual bat 
access points and roosting places and to locate evidence of bats. Bat evidence can 
include: 
 Bat speciemens (live or dead); 
 Droppings; 
 Urine splashes; 
 Fur-oil staining; 
 Feeding remains (e.g moth wings); 
 Squeaking noises; 
 Bat-fly pupal cases; and, 
 Odour. 
 
iii. Emergence/Re-Entry Surveys  
1.7.7 
Surveys paid due regard to Bat Surveys for Professional Ecologists: Good Practice 
Guidelines (Collins, 2016).  Each survey consisted of two surveyors stood at 
vantage points looking at the buildings so that bats could be observed leaving/re-
entering Potential Roost Features (PRF).  Bat activity was also recorded if 
observed by the surveyors.  
1.7.8 
Emergence surveys started at least 15 minutes before sunset and continued for 2 
hours.  The dawn re-entry survey started at least 2 hours before sunrise and 
continued until 15 minutes after sunrise.   
1.7.9 
Broadband frequency division detectors were used and digital recordings were 
made to assist with species identification if required.

High 
A structure with one or more potential roost 
sites that are obviously suitable for use by 
larger numbers of bats on a more regular 
basis and potential for longer periods of time 
due to their size, shelter, protection, 
conditions (e. g.  temperature, humidity, 
height above ground level, light levels or 
levels of disturbance) and surrounding 
habitat.   
Can include structures with points of access 
to the interior of the building and poorly 
maintained fabric providing ready access 
points for bats into structures, but at the same 
time not draughty.  Structures of traditional 
stone, brick or timber construction.  
Structures with large (>20cm) roof timbers 
with mortice joints, cracks and holes.  
Structures of pre or early 20th century 
construction.  Structures with large 
complicated and/or uncluttered roof spaces 
providing unobstructed flying spaces.  
Structures with weather boarding and/or 
hanging tiles with gaps.  Structures with 
accessible south facing roofs.  Structures with 
proximity to good foraging habitat such as 
woodland, wetland, water and /or good 
hedgerows.  
A tree with one or more 
potential roost sites that 
are obviously suitable 
for use by larger 
numbers of bats on a 
more regular basis and 
potential for longer 
periods of time due to 
their size, shelter, 
protection, conditions (e. 
g.  temperature, 
humidity, height above 
ground level, light levels 
or levels of disturbance) 
and surrounding habitat.  
Moderate 
A structure with one or more potential roost 
sites that could be used by bats due to their 
size, shelter, protection, conditions (e. g.  
temperature, humidity, height above ground 
level, light levels or levels of disturbance) and 
surrounding habitat but unlikely to support a 
roost of high conservation status.   
Can include structures with some potential to 
support roosting bats, but fewer features than 
a high risk building.  Features may include 
areas suitable for crevice dwelling and/or 
access points into structures.  Some proximity 
to foraging habitat.   
A tree with one or more 
potential roost sites that 
could be used by bats 
due to their size, shelter, 
protection, 
conditions 
and surrounding habitat 
but unlikely to support a 
roost

Low 
A structure with one or more potential roost 
sites that could be used by individual bats 
opportunistically.   
However, these potential roost sites do not 
provide enough space, shelter protection, 
appropriate conditions and/or suitable habitat 
to be used on a regular basis or by large 
numbers of bats (i. e.  unlikely to be suitable 
for maternity or hibernation).  
Tree of sufficient size 
and 
age 
to 
contain 
potential roost features 
but with none seen from 
the ground or features 
seen have only very 
limited 
roosting 
potential.   
Negligible 
No features suitable for roosting bats.   
Can include structures constructed from 
unsuitable materials e. g.  prefabricated with 
steel and sheet material.  Structure is 
draughty, light and cool buildings with no 
roosting opportunities.  High levels of regular 
disturbance including external and/or internal 
lighting.  Building is isolated from areas of 
foraging habitat.   
Trees with no potential 
to support bats.

i. 
Preliminary Ground Assessment 
1.7.10 The bat study area comprised the land within the Project Site Boundary and the 
area within the Zone of Influence (ZoI) (Figure 2). The Bat Survey Guidelines 
(Collins, 2016) state that bat roost assessments must be considered within the 
Project Site Boundary and the areas under the ZoI of the project.  For potential bat 
roosts the ZoI was assessed to be all land within the Project Site Boundary; and 
using professional judgement, within a 50m buffer surrounding area where the 
Generating Equipment Site will be situated due to noise, vibration and lighting 
during construction, operation and decommissioning.  
1.7.11 Trees within or adjacent (adjacent is defined as up to 20m from the Project Site 
Boundary) to the Project Site Boundary were classified into categories dependent 
on the presence of features suitable as bat roost habitat.   
1.7.12 Trees up to 50m from the Generating Equipment Site were classified into 
categories dependent on the presence of features suitable as bat roost habitat. 
1.7.13 The assessment was conducted via an external appraisal from the ground using 
binoculars where necessary.  Table 1.1 provides descriptions of the roost potential 
categories for trees.  
1.7.14 Eleven trees with bat roost potential were identified during the PEA (Appendix 8.1 
of the ES).  Thirty four trees were identified during a ground level roost assessment 
of trees in July 2017.   
ii. Potential Roost Feature Climbed Inspection Survey  
1.7.15 Following the Ground Level Roost Assessment trees which were assessed as 
having ‘Low or Moderate’ bat roost potential were subject to a PRF climbed 
inspection.  No trees with High bat roost potential were identified.  
1.7.16 These PRF climbed inspections were undertaken in August 2017.  The inspections 
were completed by certified and bat licenced tree climbers.  
1.7.17 The inspections paid due regard to Bat Surveys for Professional Ecologists: Good 
Practice Guidelines (Collins, 2016), Bat Workers Manual (Mitchell-Jones and 
McLeish, 2004) and Bats and Woodland Management (Forestry Commission, 
2005).  
1.7.18 Trees were climbed using ropes and/or ladders.  Once accessed, features were 
examined in detail using a torch, endoscope or mirror to inspect (where possible) 
the full extent of the features and search for bats or evidence of bat activity (e. g.  
droppings, urine stains, odour, feeding remains, scratch marks, grease stains, wear 
marks).  Where necessary, trees were re-categorised following the PRF climbed 
inspection.

1.7.19 Two trees identified as having bat roost potential during the preliminary ground 
level roost assessments were not climbed as they were approximately 20m and 
55m outside of the Project Site Boundary. 
1.7.20 Sixteen trees could not be accessed and two could not be found during the PRF 
climbed inspections, as described in the Limitations (Section 1.8).  
iii. Emergence/Re-Entry Surveys  
1.7.21 Following the Ground Level Roost Assessment and PRF climbed inspections, 
emergence/re-entry surveys were undertaken on trees with a category of Moderate 
or High.  
1.7.22 Surveys paid due regard to Bat Surveys for Professional Ecologists: Good Practice 
Guidelines (Collins, 2016). Each survey consisted of one surveyor positioned so 
that bats could be observed leaving/re-entering the PRF. Bat activity was also 
recorded if observed by the surveyors. 
1.7.23 Emergence surveys started at least 15 minutes before sunset and continued for 2 
hours (see Limitations). The dawn re-entry survey started at least 2 hours before 
sunrise and continued until 15 minutes after sunrise.  
1.7.24 Broadband frequency division detectors were used and digital recordings were 
made to assist with species identification if required. The weather conditions during 
the surveys were recorded and were largely considered favourable for bats.  
Survey dates and weather conditions are given in Table 1.3.

Preliminary Assessment of Potential Commuting and Foraging Habitat 
1.7.25 The Project Site was assessed as having High commuting and foraging potential 
for bats (Collins, 2016) during the PEA (Appendix 8.1 of the ES).  Habitats within 
the Project Site were classified into categories dependent on the presence of 
features suitable for bats to commute and forage.  Table 1.2 provides category 
descriptions for commuting and foraging habitat.

ii. Bat Activity – Walked Transects 
1.7.26 Surveys paid due regard to Bat Surveys for Professional Ecologists: Good Practice 
Guidelines (Collins, 2016).  Two walked transect routes were developed to sample 
the Project Site, one in the north and one in the south. These are shown on Figures 
3.1 to 3.3.  
1.7.27 Each transect was walked twice per month. Dusk activity surveys were completed 
in June, July, August, September and October 2017 and in April and May 2018. 
One dusk and dawn survey within one 24 hour period was completed in September 
2017.  
1.7.28 Each survey consisted of two surveyors walking a pre-determined transect route at 
a steady pace across the Project Site. The start point and direction of each transect 
was varied across the months to reduce bias. 
1.7.29 The transect contained set Listening Points (LPs) which the surveyors stopped at 
for three minutes. Each transect contained 12 LPs, with the exception of the first 
set of surveys in June which had 11 LPs (see Section 1.8, Limitations). The 
locations of the LPs are shown on Figures 3.1 to 3.3.  
1.7.30 Tables 1.23 and 1.24 describe the habitat at each of the LPs. 
1.7.31 Dusk transect surveys began 15 minutes before sunset and continued for up to 3 
hours after sunset, except for one occasion (see Section 1.8, Limitations). The 
dawn transect started at least 2 hours before sunrise and continued until sunrise 
(see Section 1.8, Limitations). 
1.7.32 A broadband frequency division detector was used (Bat Box Duet with EM3) and 
digital recordings made to assist with species identification if required.   
1.7.33 The weather conditions for all but one of the surveys (see Section 1.8, Limitations) 
completed to date was considered to be favourable for bats. The weather 
conditions and survey dates are given in Table 1.3. 
iii. Bat Activity – Static Detector Surveys 
1.7.34 Surveys paid due regard to Bat Surveys for Professional Ecologists: Good Practice 
Guidelines (Collins, 2016). Nine static detector locations were selected within the 
Project Site to incorporate a range of habitats and give spatial coverage of the 
Project Site. The locations of the static detectors are shown in Figure 3.4. 
1.7.35 Static detector surveys were completed in June, July, August, September and 
October 2017 and April and May 2018.  
1.7.36 The dates of the static detector surveys were: 
 June 26 – 01 July 2017; 
 24 July – 29 July 2017; 
 23 August  – 28 August  2017; 
Abergelli BAT ACTIVITY AND ROOST UPDATE SURVEY 
 
 
Prepared for:  Abergelli Power Limited 
AECOM 
16 
 
 
 12 September – 17 September 2017;  
 17 October - 22 October 2017; 
 25 April – 30 April 2018; and, 
 23 May – 28 May 2018. 
1.7.37 The static detectors were set to begin recording 30 minutes before sunset and 
continue until 30 minutes after sunrise for a period of five consecutive nights 
(Collins, 2016). Some equipment failures reduced the static detector recording time 
(see Limitations and Appendix 3A). 
1.7.38 Full spectrum frequency detectors (Wildlife Acoustics Song Meter 2 (SM2/SM2+) 
with sample rate 384kHz) and ultrasonic SMX-U1 omnidirectional microphones 
were used to obtain digital recordings of bat echolocation calls in order to 
determine the species present at each Static Detector Location. 
e) Data Analysis and Interpretation 
1.7.39 Bat echolocation call analysis where required was undertaken by a suitably 
experienced ecologist, with support from reference material including the British Bat 
Calls Species Identification Guide (Russ, 2012).   
1.7.40 The AnalookW software programme (version 4.2n) was used to analyse bat 
echolocation calls.  A series of custom made filters in Analook were applied to the 
bat echolocation call data. Ten percent of pipistrelle calls and all calls of the 
remaining bat species were manually checked once filters had been applied, and 
any additional or incorrect calls were relabelled. 
1.7.41 Long-eared bats have very quiet echolocation calls and these are often not 
recorded on bat detectors but may be audible using bat detectors. Where long-
eared bats are suspected but the echolocation call has not been recorded then the 
long-eared bat (possible) category has been used. This is shown in Tables 1.8 to 
1.12. 
1.7.42 There are six resident species of Myotid bat in Britain.  Myotid bats are difficult to 
identify to species level as the echolocation calls can have overlapping frequencies 
and can be visually similar when viewed on bat echolocation call software, such as 
Analook.  Therefore all Myotid bat echolocation calls were grouped together for the 
purposes of calculating Bat Activity Index (BAI). 
1.7.43 Where possible, calls with characteristics of specific Myotid bats were noted to 
inform the species composition within the Project Site.  
1.7.44 For the walked transect data, a BAI was calculated as the number of passes 
divided by the survey time in ‘hours’.  Survey time was calculated to the nearest 15 
minutes, expressed as 0.25 hours, to account for minor differences in survey 
duration (see Section 1.8, Limitations).

1.7.45 For the static detector survey data, a BAI was calculated as the number of passes 
divided by the survey time in ‘nights’.  Survey time was calculated to the nearest 
0.5 nights, to account for differences in survey duration (see Section 1.8, 
Limitations and Appendix 3A).  The half way point for each night was calculated 
using the start and finish time. If the static detector failed before the half way point 
then 0.5 of a night was used in the BAI calculations.  If the static detector failed 
after the half way time point the whole night was used in the BAI calculations.   
1.7.46 Bat activity is an indication of the amount of use bats make of an area (Collins, 
2016). A bat pass is defined by BCT as a sequence of greater than two 
echolocation calls made as a single bat flies past the microphone (BCT, 2017).  A 
bat pass is an index of bat activity rather than a measure of number of individuals in 
a population (Collins, 2016).  
1.7.47 The statistics software programme ‘R’ (R Core Team, 2013) was used to assist data 
interpretation and to help look for statistically significant differences and/or 
relationships. This was completed by an ecologist with appropriate statistical 
knowledge and experience of the programme. 
1.7.48 Due to the variation in successful recording nights, statistical tests could only be 
completed from the first night of data from each static detector, for each month.   
1.7.49 The data was assessed for normal distribution and the most appropriate statistical 
tests applied. The data was not normally distributed and therefore non parametric 
tests, Kruskal-Wallis and Mann Whitney-Wilcoxon, were used. 
1.7.50 Calculated values within this report have been given to one decimal place, except 
for survey times in Tables 1.13 and 1.14, BAI values in Table 1.18 and BAI values 
in Table 1.20.

1.8 
Limitations 
1.8.1 
Biological records can be received from a wide variety of sources and may or may 
not be comprehensive and accurate.  However, if assessed in conjunction with a 
survey, they can contribute to a robust ecological assessment of a site.   
a) 
Suitable Roost Feature Climbed Inspection Survey  
1.8.2 
There are 16 trees which were not climbed due to access and/or health and safety 
restrictions and there are two trees which were not climbed as they could not be 
found by the climbing team due to dense woodland, however these trees were the 
subject of emergence/ re-entry survey at a later date.  These trees did not have 
their bat roost suitability category altered from the original assigned category and 
all trees with Moderate suitability subsequently had emergence/re-entry surveys. 
Therefore, this is not deemed to be a significant limitation. 
b) 
Roost Survey  
1.8.3 
Building 1 did not have a full Ground Level Preliminary Assessment due to time 
constraints (Appendix 8.1 of the ES). However, this building is approximately 120m 
outside of the Project Site Boundary and no further surveys were considered 
necessary on this building. Therefore, this is not a significant limitation.  
1.8.4 
Two dusk emergence surveys were undertaken on Buildings 7 and 8, rather than 
one dusk and one separate dawn re-entry as recommended by Collins, 2016. The 
deviation from the suvey guidance was required to facilitate a favourable access 
agreement with the householder for the bat surveys, to limit access disturbance. 
Both of these buildings were confirmed as bat roosts during these dusk surveys 
and therefore this limitation is not deemed to be significant. 
c) Bat Activity Walked Transect Survey 
1.8.5 
The first set of June walked transect surveys had 11 LPs per transect, this was 
increased to 12 LPs per transect for all subsequent surveys.  This was changed to 
increase the spread of sample points.  This is not deemed to be a significant 
limitation to the surveys or this report.  
1.8.6 
On 10 July 2017 during the Northern Transect the SD recording card briefly came 
out of the EM3 bat detector and calls during that period were not recorded 
electronically.  However, this was replaced and all bats heard during the period 
were recorded on the survey sheet and were of common species which the 
surveyor was able to determine species identification with confidence.  This is not 
deemed to be a significant limitation to the survey or the results.   
1.8.7 
On 13 September 2017 the dawn South Transect survey finished at 06:42 which 
was 5 minutes before sunrise, however no bats had been heard since 06:16 and 
therefore this is not deemed to be a significant limitation.

1.8.8 
On a small number of occasions surveyors walked past an LPs or LPs were not 
accessible meaning that bat data was not recorded for 3 minutes at that location. 
For calculations of Bat Activity Index, the survey time at each LP has been adjusted 
to reflect this variation and will mitigate the impact of this limitation of the 
comparisons of bat activity between LPs. The occasions are listed below:  
i. 
North Transect: 
 On 10 July 2017 North Transect LP4 was missed;   
 On 23 August and 7, 11 and 12 September 2017, North Transect LP1 was not 
accessible due to horses being present in the field. A replacement LP was 
completed as close as possible to the original location at LP1a (s See Table 
1.11, LP1a and Figure 5.2). As LP1 was replaced with another LP close to the 
original location, this is not deemed to be a significant limitation.  
 On 7 August, North Transect LP1 was missed; 
 On 12 and 25 April and 10 and 23 May North Transect LP3 was not accessible 
due to horses being present in the field. A replacement LP was completed as 
close as possible to the original location at LP3a (See Table 1.11, LP3a and 
Figure 5.2). As LP3 was replaced with another LP close to the original location, 
this is not deemed to be a significant limitation; 
 23 May 2018 North Transect LP3a as missed; 
 On 12 and 25 April and 10 May North Transect LP4 was not accessible due to 
horses being present in the field. A replacement LP was completed as close as 
possible to the original location at LP4a (See Table 1.11, LP4a and Figure 5.2). 
As LP4 was replaced with another LP close to the original location, this is not 
deemed to be a significant limitation; and, 
 On 25 April 2018 North Transect LP12 was missed.  
 
ii. South Transect: 
 On 7 and 13 September 2017 LP7 on the South Transect not accessible due to 
the presence of rams in the field.   
 On 7 September 2017, LP9 was missed, this was replaced with LP9a (See 
Table 1. 12, LP9a and Figure 5. 3).  As LP9 was replaced with another LP 
close to the original location, this is not deemed to be a significant limitation;  
 On 3 October 2017, LP9 was missed, this was replaced with LP9b (See Table 
1.12, LP9b and Figure 5. 3).  As LP9 was replaced with another LP close to the 
original location, this is not deemed to be a significant limitation; and,  
 On 25 April 2018 LP9 on the South Transect was missed.  
1.8.9 
The weather conditions encountered on the dusk South Transect surveys on 13 
September 2017 (see Table 1.3) were not considered wholly favourable for bats, 
but not so bad as to need to abandon the survey.  There was light rain at 21:33 and 
a spell of heavy rain between 21:50 and 22:17.  The South Transect was also 
sampled at dusk on 7 September 2017 in favourable weather conditions. 
1.8.10 It was not possible to incorporate land owned by National Grid within a walked bat 
activity transect due to due to site access restrictions at night and early morning.

d) Bat Activity Static Detector Survey 
1.8.11 Some of the static detectors did not record for the full five night period. Details of 
malfunctions and reduced survey nights are provided in Appendix 3A Static 
Detector Limitations.  
1.8.12 No data was recorded at North 1 in October 2017. Data in this location was 
successfully collected in the other 6 months.  
1.8.13 No data was recorded at South 1 in July and October 2017. Data in this location 
was successfully collected in the other 5 months. 
1.8.14 No data was recorded at South 3 in June and September 2017. Data in this 
location was successfully collected in the other 5 months. 
1.8.15 No data was recorded at South 1 in July and October 2017. Data in this location 
was successfully collected in the other 5 months. 
1.8.16 No data was recorded at Lane 2 in August and September 2017.  Two other static 
detectors (Lane 1 and Lane 3) were positioned within the Lane and have captured 
bat activity which is representative of the Lane.  
e) Data Analysis and Interpretation 
1.8.17 Different bat species vary in their likelihood of detection using bat detectors and 
therefore it is not relevant to compare numbers of bat passes from different species 
(Collins, 2016).   
1.8.18 Only the first night of data for each location in each month could be used for 
statistical analysis, due to the variation in successful recording nights. Therefore, 
the results are less powerful than if the full five nights could have been compared. 
However, the statistical analysis provides an additional tool, alongside BAI and 
count data in the interpretation of bat activity.

Building – Ground Level Roost Assessments and Internal 
Inspections 
Eleven buildings with bat roost potential were identified.  Internal 
inspections of buildings confirmed non-maternity roosts in three 
buildings. These are shown in Appendix 2A: 
 BSG Building 4: A scattering of long-eared bat, pipistrelle and 
lesser horseshoe bat droppings were found in the store rooms; 
 BSG Building 8: Small piles of long-eared bat and pipistrelle 
droppings found in both first and second storey at the north of 
the building; and,  
 BSG Building 10: Two pipistrelle droppings were found on the 
floor.  
 
BSG Building 1, 2, 5 and 11 were categorised as having 
Moderate bat roost potential.  BSG Building 7 was categorised as 
having Low bat roost potential.  BSG Building 3 and 9 were 
categorised as having Negligible bat roost potential (Hundt, 
2012). 
The buildings identified by BSG in 2014 fall outside of the current 
Project Site.  However, some of these buildings adjacent to the 
Project Site have been reassessed by AECOM in 2017/2018.  
Details are provided in Table 1.5.   
 
Tree – Ground Level Roost Assessments 
Thirty three trees were considered to have potential to support 
roosting bats.  29 of these were subject to a climbed inspection. 
Emergence and/or re-entry surveys were carried out on eight 
trees.  BSG Trees T3, T4 and T9 are located within the current 
Project Site.  No bats were recorded emerging or re-entering any 
potential roost features. No tree roosts were identified. Trees 
within the Project Site have been reassessed by AECOM in 2017.  
Details are provided in Section 1.11.  
 
Bat Activity Walked Transect Surveys 
At least seven species of bat were recorded during transect 
surveys; common pipistrelle, soprano pipistrelle, Myotis sp., long-
eared bat, noctule, Leisler’s bat, and lesser horseshoe bat.  All of 
these species and an additional three were recorded during 
automated 
static 
detector 
surveys; 
Nathusius’

Bat Roosts in Buildings 
Buildings - Preliminary Ground Level Roost Assessments 
1.9.2 
Six buildings were assessed for their suitability to support roosting bats in 2017, 
two buildings were assessed in 2018 and 11 buildings were assessed by BSG in 
2014.  The results of the assessment are provided in Table 1.5.  
1.9.3 
Building locations are provided in Figure 2. A map showing the AECOM 2017 and 
2018 results is provided in Figure 4.1 and a map showing the 2014 BSG building 
locations is provided in Figure 4.2. 
1.9.4 
In November 2017, a disued mine trial shaft and adit, adjacent to the Project Site 
was identified. Underground sites can be of value to hibernating bats, including 
horseshoe, long-eared and Myotis species. The approximate locations of the mine 
shaft and adit are shown in Figure 6.  These were assessed for their suitability to 
support roosting bats in March 2018. The adit is sealed, with no potential for 
underground hibernation and this has been capped and filled in. The adit is close to 
Building 4.  The trial shaft entrance was located and a depression in the ground 
which was grassed over was visible. Historical maps had identified that the trial 
shaft had been dug to 57ft and 6 inches and backfilled. There were no access 
points for bats. The trial shaft is not suitable for hibernation.  
Buildings – Internal Inspection 
1.9.5 
An internal inspection of Building 7 was undertaken by a bat licenced ecologist in

The results of the 2014 and 2017/2018 emergence/re-entry surveys are provided in 
Table 1.6. The locations of the buildings and the roost results from 2017/2018 are 
shown on Figure 4.1. 
1.9.7 
Further surveys were not undertaken on AECOM Buildings 1 and 2 due to their 
distance from the Project Site.  Further surveys were not undertaken on Buildings 5 
and 6 in 2017 as they had Negligible bat roost suitability.

ii. Bat Roosts in Trees 
Trees - Preliminary Ground Level Roost Assessment 
1.9.8 
The results of the Preliminary Ground Level Roost Assessment are provided in 
Appendix 1A.  
Trees - Potential Roost Feature Climbed Inspections 
1.9.9 
All trees with Low or Moderate bat roost suitability were put forward for climbed 
inspection.  A full table of results from the climbed inspections are provided in 
Appendix 1A.  
1.9.10 All trees inspected were reduced to Negligible or Low bat roost suitability. No bat 
roosts were identified.   
1.9.11 Trees 3, 19, 21, 36 and 44 could not be accessed and therefore retained their 
original Moderate rating.  These trees were taken forward for emergence and re-
entry surveys, in the absence of the climbed inspection assessment.  
1.9.12 Trees with Low bat roost suitability do not require further survey but may need to be 
checked for roosting bats before removal.   
Emergence/Re-entry Surveys 
1.9.13 The results of the emergence/re-entry surveys are provide in Table 1.7. The 
locations of the trees and the roost results are shown on Figure 4.   
1.9.14 Of the five trees surveyed, one bat roost was confirmed in Tree 19.  Whilst the bat 
was seen entering the tree, no calls were detected.  This is possibly due to the 
distance of the tree canopy from the surveyor, and the angle of the bat from the 
detector. It has been concluded that the species is likely to be a common pipistrelle, 
because a brief common pipistrelle pass was heard approximately nine seconds 
before the roosting bat was seen flying around and then disappearing into the 
crown of Tree 19.  
1.9.15 A Photograph of Tree 19 is provided in Plate 1.1.

iv. Static Detector Surveys 
1.9.24 The Static Detector Locations are shown in Figure 3.4.  
1.9.25 The results of the static detector surveys are presented in Tables 1.17 to 1.22.  
1.9.26 82,329 bat passes were recorded at the Project Site between June and October 
2017 and April, May 2018.  A total of 247.5 recording nights were completed.  
1.9.27 Table 1.17 and 1.19 display the count of bat passes for each species or species 
group. 
1.9.28 Table 1.18 displays the BAI for each species or species group.  
1.9.29 Tables 1.20 to 1.21 display BAI, expressed as bat passes per night.  
1.9.30 Table 1.20 displays BAI (passes/night), by Static Detector Location. 
1.9.31 Table 1.21 displays BAI (passes/night), by month. 
1.9.32 Table 1.22 displays the bat passes and BAI for each Static Detector Location 
Group. 
1.9.33 Appendix 4A Tables 2.2 to 2.4 provide the results of the Kruskal-Wallis and Mann 
Whitney-Wilcoxon non parametric tests.   
1.9.34 Plates 1.2 and 1.3 display box plots for bat passes for location and month, 
respectively.  The log of the number of bat passes is used on the y-axis to aid with 
the visual interpretation of the box plots. 
1.9.35 Plates 1.4 and 1.5 display box plots for bat species richness for location and month, 
respectively. Bat species richness is defined as the number of different bat species 
recorded at each location.  
1.9.36 A Site Assessment Summary is provided in Section 1.10.

Project Site Assessment 
a) Bat Roosts 
i. 
Bat Roosts in Buildings  
1.10.1 There are no buildings and hence no building bat roosts within the Project Site.  
1.10.2 Buildings adjacent to the Project Site were assessed. Building 7 is a confirmed 
summer, non-maternity roost for at least two lone roosting common pipistrelle bats,  
a summer roost, possibly maternity, for at least 8 long-eared bats and a suspected 
roost for at least one Myotis sp. Building 8 is a confirmed summer non-maternity 
roost for at least two lone roosting common pipistrelle bats. None of the other 
buildings surveyed by AECOM supported bat roosts. This is expressed in Table 1.6 
and shown on Figure 4.2. 
ii. Bat Roosts in Trees 
1.10.3 Tree 19 is a lone male or non-breeding female common pipistrelle summer roost.  
No other trees were identified as bat roosts. A photograph of Tree 19 is shown in 
Plate 1.1.  
b) Bat Activity – Species Composition 
1.10.4 At least 13 species of bat were recorded foraging and/or commuting in close 
proximity of and within the Project Site.  The following species have been identified 
during bat surveys: 
 Greater horseshoe; 
 Lesser horseshoe; 
 Common pipistrelle; 
 Soprano pipistrelle; 
 Nathusius’ pipistrelle; 
 Daubenton’s; 
 Natterer’s; 
 Mytois species; (including calls with characteristics of Bechstein's, Brandt's 
Myotis brandtii and Whiskered Myotis mystacinus); 
 Noctule; 
 Serotine; 
 Leisler’s; 
 Long-eared species; and, 
 Indeterminate species.

i. 
Pipistrelle Species  
1.10.5 Common and soprano pipistrelles were the most commonly recorded species in the 
Project Site.  Overall pipistrelle species comprised 87.3% of all passes recorded on 
the walked transect surveys and 93.8% of the static detector surveys.  They were 
also the most commonly recorded species during the emergence/re-entry surveys.  
1.10.6  Pipistrelle species comprised of 89.9% of the passes recorded on the North 
Transect and 85.6% of the passes recorded on the South Transect.   
1.10.7 Similarly, pipistrelle species were the most commonly recorded species during the 
BSG 2014 transect and static detector surveys (Appendix 8.8 of the ES).  
1.10.8 Two passes of Nathusius' pipistrelle were recorded during the July transect 
surveys, one record from the South Transect and one from the North Transect, 
making up 0.2% of total bat passes. 
1.10.9 One pass of Nathusius' pipistrelle pass was recorded at the static detector location 
North 2 in October, making up <0.1% of the total bat passes.  
1.10.10 One pass of Nathusius' pipistrelle was recorded during the BSG static detector 
surveys in 2014 at Location D8 (ES Appendix 8.8).  Location D8 is in a similar area 
to the AECOM South 1.  Nathusius' pipistrelle were not identified during the BSG 
2014 activity transect surveys (Appendix 8.8 of the ES).  
ii. Myotis Species 
1.10.11 Myotis species comprised 9.5% of the total calls recorded on the transect surveys. 
Myotis species comprised 7.7% of the passes recorded on the North Transect and 
10.8% of the calls recorded on the South Transect. 
1.10.12 Activity levels for Myotis species during the transect surveys were comparable with 
the activity levels recorded during the BSG 2014 transect surveys (Appendix 8.8 of 
the ES).  
1.10.13 A total of 4562 Myotid bat passes, 5.5% of the total calls, were recorded during the 
static detector surveys.  
Some of the Myotid bat echolocation calls from the static detector surveys were considered to have characteristics of 
Bechstein's, Brandt's  Daubenton’s, Natterer’s and whiskered.

iii. Noctule, Seortine and Leislers 
1.10.14 Noctule, serotine and Leisler’s (N/S/L) bats comprised 1.8% of the passes recorded 
on walked transect surveys. N/S/L bats comprised of 1.6% of the passes recorded 
on the North Transect and 2.0% of the passes recorded on the South Transect.  
BSG did not breakdown these species into percentages (Appendix 8.8 of the ES).  
1.10.15 Noctule, serotine and Leisler's (N/S/L) bats comprised 0.4% of the passes recorded 
during the static detector surveys.  
1.10.16 Noctule, serotine and Leisler's were recorded during the BSG 2014 static detector 
surveys. Serotine were not identified during the BSG 2014 activity transect surveys 
(ES Appendix 8.8).  
iv. Long-eared Species 
1.10.17 Long-eared and possible long-eared bat comprised a total of 0.4% of the passes 
recorded on the North Transect and 0.4% recorded on the South Transect   
surveys.  BSG did not breakdown these species into percentages (Appendix 8.8 of 
the ES). 
1.10.18 Long-eared bats comprised 0.1% of the passes recorded during the static detector 
surveys.  
v. Horseshoe Bat Species  
1.10.19 There was a single lesser horseshoe bat pass recorded on the South Transect, 
equating to 0.2% of the total bat passes for the South Transect and 0.1% of the 
total passes for the Project Site.  This was recorded in August 2017.  BSG 2014 
also recorded only one lesser horseshoe bat pass, again recorded on the BSG 
south transect (Appendix 8.8 of the ES). 
1.10.20 A total of 104 lesser horseshoe passes were recorded during the static detector 
surveys:  
 North Static Detector Locations = 6 bat passes; 
 South Static Detector Locations = 72 bat passes; and  
 Lane Static Detector Locations = 26 bat passes.  
1.10.21 BSG recorded a single lesser horseshoe pass at Location D3 (Appendix 8.8 of the 
ES), which is in a similar area to AECOM South 3.   
1.10.22 Greater horseshoe was not detected during the walked transect survey.  
1.10.23 A total of 42 greater horseshoe passes were recorded during the static detector 
surveys: 
 North Static Detector Locations = 16 bat passes; 
 South Static Detector Locations = 19 bat passes; and  
 Lane Static Detector Locations = 7 bat passes.

1.10.24 BSG recorded two greater horseshoe passes in 2014, in Locations D5 and D8 
(Appendix 8.8 of the ES). Location D5 was located along the Gallops near to 
Abergelli Farm and is not comparable with any of the AECOM locations as this is 
outside of the Project Site Boundary.  Location D8 is relatively close to AECOM 
South 1.  
 
c) Bat Activity – Spatial Distribution 
1.10.25 Figure 5.1 shows the spatial distribution of individual bat passes recorded during 
the transect surveys. Figure 3.4 shows the static detector locations. 
1.10.26 In total 1,268 bat passes were recorded during the walked transects.   
1.10.27 Higher counts of bat passess were recorded in the Southern Transect (713 bat 
passes; 15.4 BAI), compared to the Northern Transect (555 bat passes, 12.3 BAI). 
The bat activity levels are broadly similar.  
1.10.28 In total 83,329 bat passes were recorded during the static detector surveys.  Table 
1.22 gives the bat activity by the Static Detector Location Groups. Higher levels of 
activity were recorded in the Southern Static Detector Locations (20,470 total bat 
passes; 264.1 BAI), compared to the Northern Static Detector Locations (21,492 
total bat passes, 231.1 BAI), reflecting the pattern of the walked transect. 
1.10.29  Using the first night data from static detector surveys, the species richness 
recorded across different locations was not statistically significant (Appendix 4A: 
Table 2.3), i.e. one location did not support a significantly different diversity of bats 
than any other location.  
1.10.30 The highest level of activity was recorded in the Lane Static Detector Locations 
(41,367 total bat passes, 537.23 BAI). The Lane Static Detector Locations (even 
with the equipment malfunctions, see Limitations) had higher levels of activity 
compared to both the North and South Static Detector Locations combined. This 
may be because the Lane is likely used for foraging, along the sheltered woodland 
edge, and detectors may have been recording multiple passes by the same bats up 
and down the Lane.  
1.10.31 During the walked transects bat activity was recorded across the Project Site 
(Figure 5.1). Vegetated stream or wet ditch corridors appear to be important for 
bats within the Project Site. The distribution of bat call suggests the following 
general patterns of activity. This is a qualitative assessment only: 
 Pipistrelle bats were recorded across the Project Site;  
 Myotis species showed some association with mature tree lines and/or areas 
near water; 
 Noctule, serotine and Leisler bats were primarily recorded at height over open 
fields across the Project Site; 
 Long-eared bats showed some association with mature tree lines and are 
focused more towards the centre and south-east of the Project Site.  The 
Abergelli BAT ACTIVITY AND ROOST UPDATE SURVEY

passes recorded are within approximately 315m to 700m of the confirmed long-
eared roost in Building 7 and approximately 270m and 850m of the BSG 
confirmed long-eared roost in Building 2;  
 The single lesser horseshoe was recorded on the South Transect along a 
mature tree line approximately 900m south of the closest known lesser 
horseshoe roost in Building 2. 
1.10.32 The distribution of bat echolocation calls detected during the static detector surveys 
suggests the following general patterns of activity. This is a qualitative assessment 
only:  
 Pipistrelle bats were recorded across the Project Site;  
 Myotis species were recorded across the Project Site; 
 Noctule, Serotine and Leisler bats were recorded across the Project Site;  
 Long-eared bats were recorded across the Project Site, with highest numbers 
recorded at Lane 3, followed by South 3 and  North 2;   
 Greater horseshoe bats were recorded across the Project Site, with the South 
having the highest number of passes; and, 
 Lesser horseshoe bats were recorded across the Project Site within the highest 
number recorded in the south and south-west of the Project Site at South 2, 
South 3, Lane 1 and Lane 2.

1.10.35 LP2, LP8 and LP12 had the highest species richness, with a total of four different 
species recorded at each.  
1.10.36 The combined totals of LP4 and LP4a had the highest BAI, with the combined 
totals of LP3 and LP3a having the second highest BAI. LP4 and LP4a are located 
next to a row of mature trees which are connected to the Abergelli Farm buildings 
to the west and a watercourse to the east. LP3 and LP3a are located adjacent to a 
watercourse and riparian woodland with mature trees.   
1.10.37 LP11 had the lowest BAI, with only two bat passes recorded over all the months.

d) Bat Activity – Temporal Distribution 
1.10.48 Bat activity was recorded at the Project Site between June and October 2017 and 
April and May 2018.  
1.10.49 August had the highest BAI for both transects.  The North Transect had a BAI of 
17.2 and the South Transect had a BAI of 24.9. 
1.10.50 May had the second highest BAI for both transects.  The North Transect had a BAI 
of 15.1 and the South Transect had a BAI of 20.4. 
1.10.51 For the static detector surveys, July had the highest BAI of 456.8; the second 
highest BAI was 428.3 in May and third highest BAI was 423.0 in August.  
1.10.52 As seen in Plate 1.4 the month of August has a greater level of species richness 
than April and September.  This was a statistically significant result as seen in 
Appendix 4A: Tables 2.3 and 2.4.  
1.10.53 The statistical analysis of the first night of static detector data showed that there is 
no significant difference between the bat activity in each month sampled (Plate 1.2 
and Appendix 4A: Table 2.2) as there was not statistically significant results 
between any of the months.   
1.10.54 Young bats are typically born in June and July and during August the young are 
starting to leave the roosts to fly and feed. October is part of the bat mating period 
and a time when bats are extensively foraging for food as they are looking to store 
fat for the winter hibernation period. The general ecology of bat species is likely to 
influence the temporal activity for the Project Site.

1.11 
Preliminary Potential Effects 
1.11.1 A full assessment of effects at construction and operation has been undertaken for 
the Ecological Impact Assessment (EcIA) and reported in the ES.  
1.11.2 Figure 7 indicates the location of potential constraints / impacts.  At this stage the 
following potential effects have been identified:  
a) Bat Roosts 
i. 
Destruction and Loss of a Roost 
1.11.3 Tree 19 was the only confirmed roost within the Project Site.  The Project will not 
require the removal of Tree 19.  
ii. Killing and Injury 
1.11.4 Based on the current known distribution of bat roosts within the Project Site, there 
is no risk of killing or injuring bats during construction and operation.  
iii. Disturbance 
1.11.5 Without mitigation, there is potential for disturbance to bats due to noise and 
vibration and external lighting during construction and operation.  
b) Bat Commuting and Foraging 
i. 
Habitat Loss 
1.11.6 The Project Site is used by bats, particularly the vegetated watercourse/wet ditch 
corridors, followed by woodland edges and hedgerows with mature trees.   
1.11.7 A proportion of the broadleaved semi-natural woodland, semi-improved grassland 
and marshy grassland will be removed as part of the Project. Without mitigation, 
hedgerows and mature trees lines will be removed for construction of the Electrical 
Connection and new section of Access Road. This will reduce the amount of habitat 
available to foraging bats.  
ii. External Lighting 
1.11.8 An Outline Lighting Strategy provided in Appendix 3.5 of the ES. There will be an 
increase in external lighting at the Project Site during construction and operation. 
There is currently no external lighting within the majority of the Project Site. If 
external lighting for the Project is poorly designed there is potential for a light spill 
onto hedgerows, tree lines, woodland edges and vegetated areas. Many species of 
bat are adverse to light, with different species having different tolerances. External 
lighting can make areas of previous foraging habitat unsuitable or inaccessible and 
therefore cause in-direct habitat loss.

iii. Noise 
1.11.9 There will be an increase in ambient noise at the Project Site during construction 
and operation. Construction noise will be temporary and is considered unlikely to 
impact on foraging bats in the long-term. Operational noise is discussed further 
below.  
1.11.10 The Generating Equipment will only be operational intermittently at times of peak 
demand and will not emit ultrasonic noise (ultrasonic being noise which is higher 
than the upper audible limit of human hearing, typically considered to be above 
20kHz).   
1.11.11 The Generating Equipment is predicted to emit a sound power level of around 
100dB LWA, the power peaks at a frequency of around 50/63 Hz and roughly halves 
with every doubling of frequency above that. A typical attenuated power station 
sound power spectrum is shown in Plate 1.8. This only goes up to 8,000Hz (8kHz) 
but the tail off in the spectrum continues with increased frequency, showing that 
there will be little sound power (dB LA) above 10,000Hz (10kHz).  
1.11.12 The specific sound level near the Project Site Boundary is estimated to be 
approximately 55dB LAeq (ES Chapter 7 Noise – Figure 7.1) (this term is the 
Equivalent Continuous Level, a type of average, where noisy events have a 
significant influence). The theoretical average sound pressure level (dB LA) at the 
Project Site Boundary approximately 30m from the Generating Equipment will be 
approximately 55 dB LA to 63 dB LA. Equivalent general sounds comparisons are: 
50 dB LA is light traffic or rainfall; 60 – 65 dB LA is normal conversation; and 85 dB 
LA is heavy traffic.

1.11.13 There is limited research on the impact of anthropogenic noise on foraging bats 
and no directly comparable research on the impacts of power station noise have 
been identified. Research that exists shows that increased anthropogenic noise can 
negatively impact foraging activity of some species of bats, particularly low 
frequency bats (<35kHz), as a result of prey masking and avoidance of noise. Two 
of these are summarised below. 
1.11.14 Bunkley et. al., 2015, investigated the potential effects of gas compressor station 
noise in the USA on the activity levels of the local bat assemblage. The gas 
compressor stations run 24 hours a day, 365 days a year. The mean background 
sound level (dB LA) recorded at 50m from the gas compressor site centre was 
between 70 and 85dB LA. The frequency of the compressor noise was 24kHz.  
1.11.15 Bunkley et. al., 2015, found that activity levels for the Brazilian free-tailed bat 
(Tadarida brasiliensis) were 40% lower at loud compressor sites compared to 
quieter well pads, whereas the activity levels of four other species (Myotis 
californicus, M. cillolabrum, M. lucifugus, Parastrellus hesperus) were not affected 
by noise. The assemblage of bat species emitting low frequency (<35kHz) 
echolocation calls showed a 70% reduction in activity levels at loud sites compared 
to quieter well pad sites whereas the assemblage using high frequency (>35kHz) 
echolocation did not exhibit altered activity levels. Bunkley et. al. (2015) concluded 
that lower activity levels of Brazilian free-tailed bats at loud sites indicate a potential 
reduction in habitat for this species and that this species modifies its echolocation 
search calls in noise, producing longer calls with a narrower bandwidth, which 
might affect prey detection.  
1.11.16 Luo et al., 2015, investigated how anthropogenic noise impairs foraging, which has 
direct consequences for animal survival and reproductive success, using 
Daubenton’s bats, which ﬁnd prey by echolocation. The study looked to identify the 
potential mechanisms of disturbance in any species capable of detecting the noise, 
namely acoustic masking of prey echoes, reduced attention and noise avoidance. 
The study used playback of traffic noise and was laboratory based. Traffic noise 
was played at around 76dB LA, at non-overlapping frequencies below 25kHz (not 
spectrally overlapping the minimum call frequency of Daubenton’s, which is at 
28kHz), and overlapping frequencies above 25kHz. 
1.11.17 Luo et al., 2015, found that trafﬁc noise reduced foraging efﬁciency in most 
Daubenton’s bats. This effect was present even if the playback noise did not 
overlap in frequency with the prey echoes. Neither overlapping noise nor non-
overlapping noise inﬂuenced the search effort required for a successful prey 
capture. Hence, noise did not mask prey echoes or reduce the attention of bats. 
Instead, traffic noise acted as an aversive stimulus that caused avoidance 
response, thereby reducing foraging efﬁciency.  
1.11.18 The frequency emitted from the Generating Equipment (between 50Hz and 
10,000Hz (10kHz)) is unlikely to mask the frequencies of large bat prey items, 
which are generally in the range of 20 - 35kHz and frequencies less than 1kHz are 
probably inaudible to bats (Luo et al., 2015).  
Abergelli BAT ACTIVITY AND ROOST UPDATE SURVEY

AECOM 
74 
 
 
1.11.19 Bunkley et. al.,2015, suggests that bat species emitting low frequency (<35kHz) 
echolocation calls may be more affected by noise than other species. At the Project 
Site, bats which echolocate at frequencies <35kHz include the large bats; noctule, 
serotine and Leisler's. Lower frequency bats at the Project Site make up 1.8% of 
the total composition of bat species, the rest are higher frequency bat species 
(>35kHz). However, the predicted frequencies emitted from the Generating 
Equipment (between 50Hz and 10,000Hz (10kHz)) were much lower than in 
Bunkley et. al., 2015, and, as above, are unlikely to mask prey items for any bat 
species. 
1.11.20 There may be some noise avoidance by some bat species when the Generating 
Equipment is operating, as there is little research available to be able to completely 
rule out potential avoidance from noise of 55 – 63dB LA . However, the generation 
of noise would be sporadic and the sound power anticipated at the Project Site 
Boundary is lower than that in the studies summarised above and it would be 
anticipated that any impact from avoidance would therefore be comparably lower. 
No studies were identified which looked at potential foraging impacts from sound 
power (dB LA) less than 70dB LA to be able to draw any direct conclusion. 
1.11.21 At the Project Site, the sporadic nature of the noise generated with times of peak 
demand is most likely to occur during winter (when bats are hibernating) during the 
early evening (16:00 – 18:00, when people get home from work and before bats 
emerge from roosts), combined with the sound power peaking at a frequency well 
below the typical frequency used by echolocating bats, it is considered that noise 
will not have a significant impact on the population of foraging bats within the 
Project Site.

iv. Severance and Fragmentation 
1.11.22 The removal of trees and woodland is required to facilitate the construction of the 
new section of Access Road. Without mitigation, this will sever the connectivity to 
habitats either side of the track, resulting in severance and fragmentation of 
retained areas.  
1.11.23 The removal of tree lines and hedgerows may be required in order to facilitate the 
construction of the Gas Connection in the north of the Project Site. Removal or 
severance of tree lines and hedgerow will sever the connectivity they provide and 
create fragmentation of retained habitat. 
1.11.24 During construction of the Project natural habitats including hedgerows and tree 
lines will be removed and converted to new areas of hardstanding and buildings.  
This will fragment and sever the connectivity of the habitats located to the north and 
to the south of the Project. This will impact on bats using the existing features in the 
landscape to commute and forage between these two areas.  
1.11.25 An Outline Lighting Strategy provided in Appendix 3.5 of the ES. There will be an 
increase in external lighting at the Project Site during construction and operation. 
There is currently no external lighting within the majority of the Project Site. Many 
species of bat are adverse to light, with different species having different 
tolerances.  External lighting can make areas of previous foraging habitat 
unsuitable and fragment commuting routes.  If external lighting for the Project is 
poorly designed there is potential for a light spill onto hedgerows, tree lines, 
woodland edges and vegetated areas which will negatively impact on bats, 
severing commuting routes and impeding access to foraging habitat.  Poorly 
designed lighting also has the potential to affect areas outside the Project Site 
Boundary.

Preliminary Recommendations for Further Surveys and Mitigation 
a) Recommendations for Further Surveys 
1.12.1 A full assessment of required further surveys has been made during EcIA and 
reported in the ES.  At this stage it is anticipated that pre-construction checks will 
be required as follows:  
 Pre-construction checks on trees, scheduled for removal, should be assessed 
for their current bat roost suitability with consideration of the seasonal survey 
timings. 
1.12.2 It is considered that, utilising data from 2014, 2017 and 2018 surveys, an accurate 
assessment of bat activity within the Project Site has been made.  Pre-construction 
checks are recommended. Mitigation measures have been determined; mitigation 
has been included in a Landscape and Ecological Mitigation Plan (LEMP). 
b) Recommendations for Mitigation 
1.12.3 A full series of recommendations for further surveys and mitigation at construction 
and operation has been undertaken for the EcIA and reported in the ES.  At this 
stage the following key recommendations have been made:  
 Based on the current Project proposals a European Protected Species Licence 
(EPSL) is not a requirement. However, should the scope of the Project  change 
and/or if further bat roosts are identified a EPSL may be required; 
 Compensate for loss of foraging habitat; 
 Maintain connectivity of foraging and commuting habitats by the retention of 
trees and hedgerows wherever possible. Figure 7 shows areas of potential 
conflict; 
 Utilising ‘brown hedgerows’ of brash, to maintain connectivity during 
construction;  
 Create new green corridors to mitigate loss, provide alternative routes and 
enhance the local landscape;  
 For construction of the Electrical Connection consider directional drilling under 
hedgerows and mature tree lines to avoid felling and avoid severance; 
 If less important hedgerows need to be severed temporarily during construction 
of the Electrical Connection the severed areas should be replanted with whips 
and standards; 
 It is recommended that reasonable avoidance measures should be taken if any 
trees with a Low bat roost potential need removing as part of the Project 
(Hundt, 2012).  This is likely to include soft-felling of trees under ecological 
supervision from a bat licenced ecologist; 
 Plant a mix of locally native species of standard trees and whips along both 
sides of the new section of Access Road to create a ‘hedgerow with trees’; and, 
 Avoid external lighting wherever possible. Only light areas which need to be lit 
to meet minimum standard. Where external lighting is needed it should be 
designed to avoid and reduce light spill following best practice guidelines for 
lighting and bats (Gunnell 2012, BCT 2009), and should be reviewed by an 
ecologist. Where external road lighting is needed the use of bollards with

louvers should be considered to keep lighting directional and below head 
height, timer or motion sensors should be used. 
c) Recommendations for Biodiversity Enhancement  
1.12.4 A full series of recommendations for biodiversity enhancement has been made 
during the EcIA and reported in the ES.  At this stage the following precautionary 
recommendations have been made:  
 Woodcrete bat boxes on trees; 
 Improve existing hedgerows by infilling with locally native species standard 
trees to maintain connectivity to key foraging areas; and, 
 Creation of new hedgerows and green corridors of locally native species.

Summary 
1.1 
Abergelli Power Limited (APL) is promoting a new Power Generation Plant with its associated Gas 
and Electricity Connections (the ‘Project’) on agricultural land within Abergelli Farm, north of 
Swansea in the City and County of Swansea (approximately at National Grid Reference 265284, 
201431). 
1.2 
The Preliminary Ecological Appraisal (PEA) (BSG Ecology, 2014) identified records of a number of 
bat species within 2 km of the Project Site boundary, and suitable habitat to support these species 
within the Project Site boundary, as defined at the time of the survey (hereafter referred to as the 
‘Survey Site’). APL commissioned BSG Ecology to undertake surveys for bats within the 150 ha of 
pastoral farmland at and around Abergelli Farm between April and October 2014 within the Survey 
Site, as part of a range of ecological surveys to inform and support an application for Development 
Consent for the Project. 
1.3 
A range of surveys were carried out in accordance with published best-practice guidance focusing 
on investigating the distribution and variety of bat species present within the Survey Site. These 
included; walked transects, automated bat detector surveys, and internal and external inspections 
of trees and buildings. 
1.4 
At least seven species of bats were recorded during transect surveys; common pipistrelle 
Pipistrellus pipistrellus, soprano pipistrelle Pipistrellus pygmaeus, Myotis sp., long-eared bat 
Plecotus sp., noctule Nyctalus noctula, Leisler’s bat Nyctalus leisleri, and lesser horseshoe bat 
Rhinolophus hipposideros. All of these species and an additional three were recorded during 
automated bat detector surveys; Nathusius’ pipistrelle Pipistrellus nathusii, serotine Eptesicus 
serotinus, and greater horseshoe bat Rhinolophus ferrumequinum. By far the most frequently 
recorded species were common and soprano pipistrelle with 90 % of calls identified as one or other 
of these two species. Myotis sp. bats were also recorded frequently with noctule recorded 
infrequently but regularly. The six other species of bats were recorded occasionally or singly. 
1.5 
Roost surveys of buildings within the Survey Site confirmed that at least three buildings contained 
bat droppings and were used as bat roosts. Droppings from at least three species of bats 
(pipistrelle sp., long-eared bat sp. and lesser horseshoe bat) were found. Thirty three trees were 
located within the Survey Site that are thought to have potential to support roosting bats. 
Emergence and / or re-entry surveys were carried out on eight trees all of which would potentially 
be directly affected by the Project.  No bats were recorded emerging from or entering these 
potential tree roosts.

Introduction 
2.1 
Abergelli Power Limited commissioned BSG Ecology to undertake surveys for bats between April 
and October 2014 as part of a suite of ecological surveys to inform and support an application for 
Development Consent for the Project described below.  
Site Description 
2.2 
The Survey Site consists of approximately 150 ha of pastoral farmland, primarily grazed by horses. 
The extent of the Survey Site is shown in (Figure 1, Appendix 1) and is centred at National Grid 
Reference 265284, 201431. The nearest settlement is Felindre, which is located approximately 2 
km to the north of the Survey Site, with Swansea approximately 5 km to the south.    
2.3 
The Survey Site is largely agriculturally improved pasture with several areas of marshy grassland, 
particularly in the north, south and north-western extents of the Survey Site. The fields are bounded 
by fences, running along the line of defunct hedgerows, and often accompanied by ditches. There 
is a block of broadleaved woodland on the eastern boundary of the Survey Site and other areas of 
woodland around the marshy grassland to the west of the Survey Site, and around Felindre Gas 
Compressor Station and the two National Grid 400 kV electrical substations that lie at the south-
west end of the Survey Site. The habitats in the surrounding landscape are similar to those within 
the Survey Site and comprise a mixture of improved and marshy grassland interspersed with 
occasional patches of woodland. 
Description of Project 
2.4 
APL is promoting a new Power Generation Plant with associated Gas and Electricity Connections 
within Abergelli Farm.  The Power Generation Plant would operate as a Simple Cycle Gas Turbine 
(SCGT) peaking plant and would be designed to provide an electrical capacity of up to 299 
Megawatts (MW).  It would be fuelled by natural gas, supplied by a new underground gas pipeline 
connecting Power Generation Plant to the existing National Grid Gas (NGG) National Transmission 
System (NTS). It would also connect to the National Grid Electrical Transmission System (NETS) 
via underground cable or overhead lines. 
2.5 
BSG Ecology has been appointed as the ecological consultant to undertake an ecology survey, 
which includes a PEA as well as a range of Phase 2 surveys, including bat surveys. These 
baseline surveys will be included in an appendix to an ecology chapter of an Environmental 
Statement, which is intended for submission in support of the application for Development Consent. 
Aims of Study 
2.6 
The aims of the bat surveys within the Survey Site were to: 
 
Identify the bat species using the Survey Site and the activity levels of bats within the Survey 
Site; 
 
Identify whether there are any features that are capable of supporting roosting bats; and 
 
If the above features are likely to be affected by the Project, establish whether they are used by 
roosting bats.

Methods 
Desk Study 
3.1 
Existing ecological information for the Survey Site and the surrounding area was requested from 
the South East Wales Biodiversity Records Centre (SEWBReC).  Information on European and 
nationally protected1 species, including bats, was requested covering the Survey Site and land up 
to 2 km from the Survey Site boundary.  
Site Appraisal  
3.2 
The areas of marshy grassland, trees, scrub, woodland and streams within the Survey Site 
potentially provide good foraging habitat for bats, with similar habitat present in the surrounding 
landscape providing habitat continuity and connectivity throughout the landscape. The desk study 
returned records of five species of bats, which are all fairly common and widespread. In addition, 
the Survey Site has habitat that is capable of supporting roosting and foraging habitat for rarer 
species of bat that have been recorded in the Swansea area, for example lesser horseshoe bat, 
greater horseshoe bat and barbastelle Barbastella barbastellus.  
3.3 
Overall, the Survey Site has been assessed as being of ‘Medium Habitat Quality’ following 
consideration of the current best practice bat survey guidelines (Hundt, 2012). Therefore the 
following methods were used at the appropriate level of survey effort, as recommended by the 
guidelines: 
 
Walked transects; and  
 
Automated detector surveys.   
3.4 
In addition, a number of buildings and trees within the Survey Site were surveyed for presence / 
likely absence of roosting bats. The following methods were used: 
 
Internal and external building inspection or tree roost climbing inspection; and 
 
Dusk emergence and pre-dawn re-entry surveys of potential roosts that are likely to be 
affected by the Project.  
Bat Activity Surveys 
Walked Transects 
3.5 
Walked surveys of two pre-determined transect routes (northern and southern, see Figure 1) were 
undertaken monthly between April and October 2014.  The pre-determined transect routes were 
largely contained within the Survey Site, with the southern route extending a short distance to the 
east of the Survey Site in one area.  
3.6 
Each transect started around sunset and took approximately 2-3 hours to complete. The timing of 
the surveys therefore covered the bat emergence period and the period of most intense foraging 
activity when invertebrate prey is most abundant (Altringham, 2003).   
3.7 
The same transect route was walked on each survey visit with the start points and direction 
changed on each visit to ensure that different parts of the Survey Site were surveyed at different 
times of the night. This approach was adopted to remove any bias that could be introduced into the 
survey data if each survey was walked in the same direction. This bias could otherwise have 
resulted in any given point on the transect route being visited at approximately the same interval 
after sunset.  Static recording points were selected for each transect.  At these points the surveyors 
were stationary for three minutes to listen and record all bat passes. 
3.8 
Bat activity was recorded using Anabat hand-held electronic bat detectors. This model of detector 
automatically records all the bat passes they detect, which significantly reduces the chances that

bats could be missed due to human error. Wherever possible, surveyors recorded the observed 
behaviour and numbers of bats onto a field proforma. This was to aid identification and also to 
provide additional detail on the behaviour of observed bats. Field notes included a record of the 
time of each bat encounter, allowing results to be cross-referenced with the recorded data. 
3.9 
The main aim of the transect walks was to identify areas of high bat activity, such as foraging areas 
and/or commuting routes (e.g. wet ditches, marshy grassland and hedgerows). Accordingly, the 
transect routes focussed on such areas. 
3.10 
When possible, all walked transects avoided heavy rain, strong winds and dusk temperatures 
below 10°C as recommended in the BCT guidelines (Hundt, 2012).  
Automated detector surveys 
3.11 
In addition to the transect surveys, automated surveys were conducted using Wildlife Acoustics 
Song Meter 2 (SM2BAT+) bat detectors which are full spectrum detectors that are triggered 
automatically to record bat echolocation calls.  These detectors can be deployed and left to 
remotely record bat activity for a period of several nights. 
3.12 
The BCT guidance recommends that two locations per transect route are surveyed each month. In 
this case, eight survey locations were used across the Survey Site with four in each half of the 
Survey Site (north and south). Each location was surveyed every other month to enable a larger 
number of survey locations to be sampled over the survey season but ensure that each location 
was sampled in spring, summer and autumn. Bat detectors would be deployed at four locations 
(two in the north and two in the south) in April, June, August and October with the other half of the 
locations sampled in May, July and September.  
3.13 
The detectors were deployed for five nights at each of the locations, which allowed continuous 
monitoring to take place during the period when bats are active, i.e. sunset to sunrise. They were 
programmed to begin recording from half an hour before sunset until half an hour after sunrise.  
Survey hours varied throughout the survey season according to daylight hours and have been 
calculated for each recording session in order to accurately calculate activity indices.  
Materials and Data Analysis 
Full details of the equipment used for surveys and the data analysis methods are provided in 
Appendix 2. 
Bat Roost Surveys 
Internal and External Building Inspection 
3.14 
The internal/external survey of eleven buildings within the Survey Site was undertaken on 25th June 
2014 by Principal Ecologist and experienced bat worker Matthew Hobbs MCIEEM (Natural 
Resources Wales (NRW) Licence number 52240:OTH:CSAB:2014) with assistance from Rachel 
Taylor ACIEEM and Caitlin McCann. Eleven buildings (Buildings B1 – B11) (see Figure 2, 
Appendix 1) were inspected to assess their potential to support roosting bats and to search for 
evidence of bat activity.  
3.15 
The survey included all the buildings within the Survey Site, except for those contained within the 
Felindre Gas Compressor Station and the two National Grid 400 kV electrical substations that lie at 
the south-west end of the Survey Site, which were visually inspected using binoculars from 
boundary fences during the PEA survey in July. The buildings within these sites do not apparently 
have any features that could support roosting bats and it was not necessary to arrange access to 
these sites to carry out a more detailed inspection of any of the buildings.  
3.16 
During the survey a thorough search was made of the buildings including all accessible areas and 
crevices for bats, their droppings, food remains or characteristic grease marks at potential roost 
exit/entrance points.  The exterior of the buildings were searched, paying particular attention to 
window ledges, where droppings can gather undisturbed, and under potential roost access points, 
such as loose tiles and gaps between boarding. Where possible, internal inspections were also 
undertaken.

3.17 
Signs of bat activity searched for included: 
 
Live bats; 
 
Droppings; 
 
Urine staining; 
 
Feeding remains (e.g. discarded wings of flying invertebrates); 
 
Oil staining; 
 
Smell; 
 
Daytime vocalisations; 
 
Absence of cobwebs (a well-used bat roost and its access points are typically clear of 
cobwebs); 
 
Scratching; and 
 
Dead bats.  
3.18 
All buildings were assigned a category defining their potential to support roosting bats in 
accordance with Table 1 below. 
Table 1: Categories defining the potential for buildings to support roosting bats. 
Level of Bat Potential  
Rationale 
Negligible  
Building with no or very limited roosting opportunities for bats, no 
evidence of use by bats and where the feature is isolated from foraging 
habitat. 
Low  
Building with a limited number of roosting opportunities, no evidence of 
current use by bats and with poor connectivity to foraging habitat. 
Medium  
Building with some roosting opportunities, with no evidence of current 
use by bats and with connectivity to moderate – high quality foraging 
habitat. 
High  
Building with multiple roosting opportunities for one or more species of 
bat, and with good connectivity to high quality foraging habitat. 
Confirmed Roost 
Presence of bats or evidence of recent use by bats. 
Internal and External Tree Inspection 
Preliminary Ground Level Inspection of Trees 
3.19 
The Preliminary Ecological Appraisal conducted (on 24 February, 14 April and 9 July 2014) 
included a preliminary ground-level assessment of trees for their potential to support roosting bats. 
Features of trees that may be used by roosting bats include: 
 
Natural holes; 
 
Woodpecker holes; 
 
Cracks or splits in major limbs; 
 
Loose bark; and 
 
Hollows or cavities. 
3.20 
Any trees with apparent roosting features were recorded and assigned a category defining their 
potential to support roosting bats in accordance with Table 2 below, as adapted from Hundt, 2012 
(Table 8.4, p. 60). The locations of these trees are shown in Figure 3a, Appendix 1.

Table 2: Categories defining the potential for trees to support roosting bats. 
Level of Bat Potential  
Rationale 
1* 
Trees with multiple, highly suitable features capable of supporting larger 
roosts. 
1 
Trees with definite bat potential, supporting fewer suitable features than 
category 1* trees or with potential for use by single bats. 
2 
Trees with no obvious potential, although the tree is of a size and age 
that elevated surveys may result in cracks or crevices being found; or 
the tree supports some features which may have limited potential to 
support bats. 
3 
Trees with no potential to support roosting bats.  
Roped Access Survey of Trees 
3.21 
Any trees that were identified during the Phase 1 survey as category 2 or above, i.e. have potential 
to support roosting bats were further assessed by Anton Kattan2 and Ted Bodsworth, during a 
roped access (or tree climbing) survey. The aim of this survey was to closely inspect features 
identified during the Phase 1 survey and re-categorise trees as necessary. The trees were 
surveyed from 15-17 July 2014. Weather conditions during the three day period were generally 
good with light rain on 16 July 2014.  
Dusk emergence and Dawn Re-entry Surveys 
3.22 
Following on from the internal and external inspections described above, dusk emergence and 
dawn re-entry surveys were undertaken between 12 and 28 August 2014. The survey was 
undertaken in a smaller area than the Survey Site described above; due to refinements in the 
Project design and extent of the Project Site which assisted in determining which potential roosts 
would be affected by the Project and, therefore, would require further survey. A plan of the reduced 
area was provided on 8 August 2014 and the trees within this reduced area, along with their roost 
potential categorisation are shown in Figure 3b, Appendix 1. No buildings are anticipated to be 
directly affected by the Project, and therefore all the buildings were excluded from further surveys. 
The recommendations included in the BCT guidance (Hundt, 2012) for the level of survey effort 
required to determine the presence or absence of bats from a structure are shown in Table 3.  
Table 3: Survey effort required for determining presence / absence of bats at a potential roost 
Level of bat potential 
Survey effort required 
High roost potential 
3 dusk emergence and/or pre-dawn re-entry 
surveys during May-September including 2 
between mid-May and August. 
Low to moderate roost potential 
2 dusk emergence and/or pre-dawn re-entry 
surveys during May-September including 2 
between mid-May and August. 
Low roost potential 
1 dusk emergence and/or pre-dawn re-entry 
surveys during May-September. 
3.23 
The roped access surveys are considered equal effort to one emergence or re-entry survey, 
therefore reducing the number of further activity surveys by one. The tree categories were split into 
the three roost potential categories as follows: 1* - high roost potential; 1 – low to moderate 
potential; 2 – low roost potential; and 3 – no roost potential. Table 4 shows the additional activity 
surveys required on each of the trees. Where it was not possible to carry out a roped access 
survey on the trees within the reduced area, namely T5, T32 and T35, an additional emergence or 
re-entry survey was carried out.

The dusk emergence surveys commenced approximately 15 - 30 minutes before sunset and 
continued until approximately 1½ - 2 hours after sunset. The dawn re-entry survey commenced 
approximately 1½ - 2 hours before sunrise and finished 15 minutes after sunrise. 
3.25 
Surveyors used two different bat detectors on each survey to supplement visual observations: a 
Batbox Duet detector for listening to bat calls from the combined heterodyne/frequency division 
output and an Anabat frequency division detector for recording calls for subsequent identification. 
Limitations of Study Methods 
3.26 
No significant limitations to the study methods were noted. The access route in the south-west of 
the Survey Site (Access Road Option 2) and the western part of the land surrounding the Felindre 
Gas Compressor Station and the two National Grid 400 kV electrical substations were not included 
in the transect surveys as access to these areas could not be arranged until late in June and was 
not permitted at night for security reasons. This area is a small proportion of the Survey Site that 
does not contain habitats significantly different to those present in other parts of the Survey Site, 
and is unlikely to support a more diverse species assemblage than the rest of the Survey Site. As 
such, it is not considered that this is a significant limitation to the survey methods. 
3.27 
No access was granted to the roof voids of the three residential buildings (buildings 1, 2, and 5 – 
see Table 12) surveyed for roosting bats. This limitation to the survey is unlikely to be significant 
given that these buildings will not be directly affected by the Project.

Results  
Desk Study 
4.1 
There were 126 bat records provided by SEWBREC from the 2 km radius search area. Of these 
the majority were recorded during bat transects carried out to inform a separate unrelated 
development proposal, named ‘Felindre development site’ in the records which was located 
approximately 1 km to the south west of the Survey Site boundary.  
4.2 
The bat species recorded from the desk study include brown long-eared bat Plecotus auritus, 
common pipistrelle, Natterer’s bat Myotis nattereri, noctule, and whiskered bat Myotis mystacinus. 
There were also records of unidentified Pipistrellus sp. and other records where the bat species 
was not specified. 
4.3 
There are four bat roosts amongst the records provided. The closest of these is a record of 50 
unspecified bat species 1.8 km to the south-east of the Survey Site at Ynystawe, Swansea from 
1992.  The next closest is a night / feeding roost of an unspecified species 1.9 km south west of the 
Survey Site boundary in Tredegar-Fawr farm buildings from 1998. A record of a roost of 87 
whiskered bats also comes from approximately 1.9 km to the north west of the Survey Site 
boundary in Felindre, Swansea from 1993. The fourth record is a roost of 70 bats of unspecified 
species, 2.5 km to the south east of the Survey Site in Ynysforgan, Swansea from 1993.

There were 43 Pipistrelle sp. passes recorded during the walked transect that could not be 
identified to species level, as the peak frequency of the calls were within a frequency range used 
by more than one species (see ‘Materials and Data Analysis’ in Appendix 2 for details of how 
pipistrelle bats were identified). These have not been included in the results tables.  
4.7 
A total of 464 bat passes (B) were recorded during the north transect, including at least five 
species, a total of 494 bat passes were recorded during the south transect, including at least seven 
species. The relative activity level (Bat passes per hour (B/h) for the definition of B and B/h used in 
this analysis see ‘Materials and Data Analysis’ in Appendix 2) recorded during the north and south 
transects is recorded in Table 7.

Relative Activity of Bats 
4.8 
Across the survey season, common pipistrelle was the most frequently encountered species during 
walked transects with 15.4 B/h and 60.2 % of all passes recorded as this species (B = 577).  
Soprano pipistrelle was the second most numerous with 6.4 B/h. When passes from unidentified 
pipistrelles are added to the total, 89.8 % of all the recorded passes were identified as bats from 
the Pipistrellus genus4. Activity levels of 1.8 B/h and 0.7 B/h were recorded for Myotis sp. and 
noctule respectively with one pass recorded for Leisler’s bat, lesser horseshoe bat and long-eared 
bat sp.  
4.9 
Bat activity levels varied between transects, with a mean of 26.1 B/h (range; 7.3–70.4 B/h). 
Fluctuations between surveys are within normal limits, being influenced by factors such as short-
term variations in weather conditions and prey availability and seasonal variations.  During April, an 
average across both surveys of 49.8 B/h was recorded, which then declined in May to 22.3 B/h and 
in June (14.4 B/h) and then rose again in July (36.5 B/h). In the autumn bat activity declined again 
with an average of 24.2 B/h recorded in September, which dropped again in October (12.2 B/h). 
The highest level of activity recorded during a single transect survey occurred during the April 
transect in SA2 when an activity rate of 70.4 B/h (B = 176) was recorded. 
Spatial Distribution of Bats 
4.10 
Common and soprano pipistrelle bats were recorded during every survey and occurred in most of 
the Survey Site. The highest number of passes was recorded along linear features such as hedges 
or streams, with lower activity over open fields. Passes were recorded throughout transect surveys, 
with the majority being recorded later in the night; however, 12 passes were recorded within 20 
minutes of sunset. 
4.11 
A total of 67 passes of Myotis bats were recorded, with a relatively wide scatter of records 
throughout the Survey Site. The highest proportion of passes was recorded along the stream to the 
east and woodlands in the south of the Survey Site. No passes were recorded within 20 minutes of 
sunset. 
4.12 
Noctule was recorded infrequently and in low numbers with just 26 passes recorded. Most passes 
were recorded during the southern transect, with single passes scattered throughout the Survey 
Site.  Twelve of the passes recorded were within the first 20 minutes after sunset. 
4.13 
One pass of lesser horseshoe bat was recorded on 3 June near the woodland at the north corner 
of the National Grid gas compressor station. This was recorded 67 minutes after sunset. 
Automated Detector Surveys 
4.14 
Automated bat detectors were operating for a total of 132 nights, equating to 1,266 hours and 50 
minutes of survey time between April and October 2014. Table 8 gives details of automated bat 
detector deployment dates and locations with the latter illustrated in Figure 1, Appendix 1. Table 9

Relative Activity of Bats 
4.15 
A total of 27,634 passes from at least ten species of bat were recorded. Figure 6 illustrates the 
proportion of activity recorded for different species at each automated survey location, for the 
whole survey period as well as spring (April-May), summer (June-August) and autumn (September-
October) in Figures 7 to 9. Data for bats not identified to species-level (e.g. common/soprano 
pipistrelle), or for which there were so few calls recorded that the activity rate cannot be 
meaningfully illustrated (e.g. greater and lesser horseshoe bat), have not been illustrated in the 
Figures provided in Appendix 1. The relative activity of bat species recorded at all detector 
locations is recorded in Table 10.

Across the survey season, the highest relative activity rate recorded was for common pipistrelle, at 
an average of 14.2 B/h (B = 17975) followed by soprano pipistrelle (4.8 B/h) with 90.0% of all the 
recorded passes identified as bats from the Pipistrellus genus. The next most frequently recorded 
species were Myotis sp. with 1.8 B/h (B = 2328) and noctule (0.2 B/h). There were also 45 long-
eared bat Plecotus sp. passes recorded, with six passes for lesser horseshoe bat, two for greater 
horseshoe bat, three for serotine Eptesicus serotinus and just one Nathusius’ pipistrelle Pipistrellus 
nathusii pass.  
4.17 
The data presented in Table 11 indicates that overall bat activity dropped from spring (April and 
May; 43.0 B/h) to summer (June - August; 19.1 B/h) and again in autumn (September and October 
11.4 B/h). The pattern of activity was the same for all species of bats except long-eared bat sp. 
which increased from <0.1 to 0.1 B/h from spring to summer, and serotine and Nathusius’ 
pipistrelle which were only recorded in the spring and autumn respectively.

Distribution of Bats 
4.20 
The highest activity levels came from three detectors that each recorded 29.9-35.7 B/h as follows: 
 
D5 (29.9 B/h) - located at the corner of a patch of woodland to the west of the Survey Site. 
The large majority of passes were from common pipistrelle bats (20.7 B/h). Two of the six 
lesser horseshoe bat passes were recorded at this location, as was one of two greater 
horseshoe bat passes. The highest Myotis activity (5.0 B/h) was recorded at this location. 
 
D4 (30.5 B/h) - located at the south corner of the Survey Site in trees along a stream corridor. 
High activity levels of common (13.4 B/h) and soprano (13.0 B/h) pipistrelle bats were 
recorded, as well as two of the six lesser horseshoe bat passes were recorded at this location. 
 
D8 (35.7 B/h) – located on the corner of woodland surrounding the National Grid Gas 
compressor station to the west of the Survey Site. High levels of activity were recorded from 
common (22.7 B/h) and soprano (9.5 B/h) pipistrelle bats. One of two greater horseshoe bat 
passes was recorded. 
Myotis bats 
4.21 
In total, 2,328 Myotis sp. passes were recorded at an average rate of 1.8 B/h. Myotis bats were 
recorded at all of the static locations and during every deployment. Higher activity rates were 
recorded in the spring (4.0 B/h) than the summer (0.9 B/h) with a slight increase again in autumn 
(1.4 B/h). 
4.22 
Higher levels of activity were recorded in the south of the Survey Site than the north (2.8 B/h and 
1.0 B/h, respectively). The highest relative activity was recorded at D5 (5.0 B/h), in the most 
southerly part of the Survey Site. 
4.23 
The nocturnal activity of Myotis bats showed that passes were typically being recorded first by 
detectors at around 40 minutes after sunset, with a peak around one hour after sunset and 
consistent activity throughout the night until around 40 minutes before sunrise.

10/03/2015 
Noctule bats 
4.24 
In total, 228 Noctule passes were recorded at an average rate of 0.2 B/h. Noctule bats were 
recorded at all of the static locations. Higher activity rates were recorded in the spring (0.5 B/h) 
which then dropped away during the summer (0.1 B/h) with a further drop in autumn (<0.1 B/h). 
4.25 
Higher levels of activity were recorded in the south of the Survey Site compared to the north (0.2 
B/h and 0.2 B/h, respectively). The highest relative activity was recorded at D3 and D6 (0.3 B/h), 
along the eastern side of the Survey Site. 
4.26 
The nocturnal activity of Noctule bats showed that passes were typically being recorded first by 
detectors at around 20 minutes after sunset, with three calls in total recorded before sunset, and a 
peak in activity around 40 minutes after sunset followed by consistently low activity throughout the 
night until around 20 minutes before sunrise. 
Leisler’s and Serotine bats 
4.27 
In total four Leisler’s bat and three serotine bat passes were recorded on the Survey Site, with an 
additional 24 passes that were identified as either Leisler’s bat or serotine.  
4.28 
Leisler’s bat passes were recorded at detector numbers D5 and D6, in the west and north-east of 
the Survey Site respectively. Serotine passes were recorded at detectors D3 and D8, in the 
woodland in the east of the Survey Site and the woodland around the Gas Compressor Station in 
the west respectively. All passes of Leisler’s bat / serotine occurred at detector D8.  
4.29 
All of the bat passes were recorded within the first 60 minutes after sunset with the exception of 
one Leisler’s bat pass and one Leisler’s bat / serotine pass which were both recorded in the middle 
of the night.  
Pipistrelle bats 
4.30 
This section covers common, soprano and Nathusius’ pipistrelles and also any pipistrelle calls that 
could have been from either species (see Appendix 2). In total, 17,975 common pipistrelle passes 
were recorded (14.2 B/h), with 6,019 soprano pipistrelle (4.8 B/h), and a total of 772 unidentified 
pipistrelle passes (0.6 B/h); 97% of all pipistrelle calls were therefore recorded to species level. 
Common and soprano pipistrelle bats were recorded from all detectors during every deployment. 
Much higher activity rates were recorded for common pipistrelle in the spring (29.6 B/h) than the 
summer (12.2 B/h) and autumn (11.4 B/h). This was also true for soprano pipistrelle, with 7.4 B/h in 
spring, 5.3 B/h in summer and 2.7 B/h in autumn. Only one Nathusius’ pipistrelle pass was 
recorded, during the autumn at D8 (in the south east of the Survey Site). 
4.31 
Higher levels of common and soprano pipistrelle activity were recorded in the south of the Survey 
Site than the north (25.5 B/h and 12.9 B/h, respectively). The highest relative activity for common 
pipistrelle was recorded at D8 (22.7 B/h). For soprano pipistrelle highest relative activity was at D4 
(13.0 B/h), the only location at which soprano pipistrelle levels nearly matched common pipistrelle, 
along the eastern side of the Survey Site. 
4.32 
The nocturnal activity of pipistrelle bats showed that passes were typically being recorded first by 
detectors at around 20 minutes after sunset, with a peak from 40 to 80 minutes after sunset. There 
was constant activity recorded throughout the night until around 20 minutes before sunrise, with a 
secondary peak around 60 to 40 minutes before sunrise. 
Long-eared bat sp. 
4.33 
In total, 45 long-eared bat sp. passes were recorded at an average rate of 0.04 B/h. Long-eared 
bat sp. were recorded at low levels at all of static locations, with a peak activity level of 0.1 B/h at 
D1. A higher number of passes were recorded in the summer (31 passes) than the autumn (13 
passes) and the spring when only one pass was recorded. 
4.34 
Long-eared bat sp. was recorded at all detectors with peak activity levels at D1 and D3, both on the 
western side of the Survey Site next to woodland.

Horseshoe bats 
4.35 
Six lesser horseshoe bat passes were recorded across four detector locations, D3, D4, D5 and D7, 
located in the centre of the Survey Site. Four of these passes were recorded in spring, with one in 
the summer and one in autumn. A single pass was recorded from D3 on 18 June, with two passes 
recorded from D4 on 25 April, single passes recorded on 18 and 19 May from D5 and a further 
single pass recorded at D7 on 20 September. Bat passes were recorded between 1-1.5 hours after 
sunset or 55 minutes – 1.5 hrs before sunrise in spring and summer, and in the middle of the night 
(23:45) in autumn.  
4.36 
Two greater horseshoe bat passes were recorded at detector locations D5 and D8 during the 
middle of the night in July and September respectively.

first and second storey at the north of 
the building.  
Building 9 
Negligible 
Breeze block shed with 
corrugated roof. 
No potential roost features or signs of 
use by bats observed. 
Building 10 
Confirmed 
roost 
Brick out-house, single 
room, no doors or 
windows. Flat concrete 
roof. 
Missing bricks allow access to the cavity 
wall in a number of places. Two 
pipistrelle droppings were found on the 
floor.  
Building 11 
Moderate 
Derelict stone cottage, 
two distinct standing 
walls, no roof.  
Walls are very exposed. Some roosting 
opportunities between the stone, and 
gaps into a rubble filled wall. No signs of 
use by bats were observed.  
4.38 
None of the buildings will be affected by the Project and therefore no further survey has been 
carried out on the buildings.  
Internal and External Tree Inspection 
Preliminary Ground Level Inspection of Trees 
4.39 
A total of 33 trees were identified during the preliminary ground level inspection of trees as having 
potential bat roosting features. The details of each tree are recorded in Table 13 below with their 
locations shown in Figure 3a, Appendix 1.  
4.40 
All but four of the trees that were identified were further assessed during the roped access survey 
(see below). 
Roped Access Survey of Trees 
4.41 
A total of 29 trees were climbed using ladders or rope access. Four trees were inaccessible or 
unsafe to climb. Table 13 includes descriptions of the potential roosting features and the BCT 
category (see Table 1) assigned to each tree following the roped access survey.

Appendix 2: Materials and Data Analysis 
Use of Bat Detectors 
The bat detectors used for automated surveys were Wildlife Acoustics SM2Bat and SM2Bat+. These are 16-
bit full-spectrum bat detectors with internal storage and computing power that allows the unit to be used as a 
remote fixed-point detector. Recording is triggered by ultrasound, such as bat calls, in the vicinity of the 
detector, and any bat calls are stored as sound files on an internal SD card.  
SM2 detectors were placed in water-proof boxes connected by a 10 m cable to an omnidirectional Wildlife 
Acoustics SMX-US microphone. The microphones were attached to a telescopic pole at 3.5 m above ground 
level on, and angled at 45° to the ground to allow water to run off, as recommended by the manufacturers.  
For walked transect surveys and emergence/re-entry surveys, surveyors used two different bat detectors on 
each survey to supplement visual observations: a Batbox Duet detector for listening to bat calls from the 
combined heterodyne/frequency division output and an Anabat (SD1 or SD2) detector or Wildlife Acoustics 
Echo Meter 3 (EM3) for recording calls for subsequent identification. 
Assessment of data from bat detectors 
The likelihood of detecting bats acoustically depends on the propagation of sound through air, the 
characteristics of bat calls, and the way sound is received and processed by the bat detector. Recent 
unpublished collaborative research by BSG Ecology and Bristol University has shown that bat detectors 
detect calls from some species of bats at greater distances than others. In general, bats with calls that can 
be detected over greater distances are larger bats which use calls that are both high amplitude and low 
frequency such as the noctule and the most difficult to detect are those which use low amplitude calls, such 
as the brown long-eared bat and barbastelle, or high frequencies, such as horseshoe bats (Rhinolophus 
spp.). Table 1 shows the mean frontal detection range of SM2 detectors for echolocation calls from UK bat 
species based on research undertaken by BSG Ecology in collaboration with Bristol University.

standard ‘field’ settings and converting to zero-crossing recordings.

Data Analysis 
Bat Call Identification 
Recorded bat calls were analysed using Analook software to confirm the identity of the bats present. Where 
possible, the bat was identified to species level. For species of long-eared bats records were not identified to 
species level due to the overlapping call parameters of each species but were assumed to refer to brown 
long-eared bats. It is unlikely that grey long-eared bat (Plecotus austriacus) occurs in Swansea, given the 
species’ known distribution and rarity (Harris & Yalden, 2008). Species of the genus Myotis6 were grouped 
together as many of the species have overlapping call parameters, making species identification problematic 
(BCT, 2012). 
For Pipistrelle species the following criteria, based on measurements of peak frequency, were used to 
classify calls: 
Common pipistrelle 
 
 
 
≥42 and <49 kHz 
Soprano pipistrelle 
 
 
 
≥51 kHz 
Nathusius’ pipistrelle 
 
 
 
<39 kHz  
                                                      
5 Refers to any bat species of the genus Myotis. 
6 This genus includes several regularly occurring species in the UK that include, Natterer’s bat, Daubenton’s 
bat Myotis daubentonii, Brandt’s bat Myotis brandtii, whiskered bat and Bechstein’s bat Myotis bechsteinii. 
 
 
 
Common pipistrelle / Soprano pipistrelle  
≥49 and <51 kHz 
Common pipistrelle / Nathusius’ pipistrelle 
≥39 and <42 kHz 
Bat calls which could not be ascribed to any of these categories were not used in the analysis. 
Calculation of relative activity 
The SM2 detectors were configured to record above the level of ambient noise, such as from wind or rain, 
and set to define a bat pass (B) as a call note of >2ms which is separated from another by more than one 
second. 
AnalookW (Version 3.8, 2010) software was used for all analysis of bat calls. It enables analysis of the 
relative activity of different species of bats by counting the number of bat passes (B) recorded within a unit of 
time – hour (h) was used. More than one pass of the same species was counted within a sound file if multiple 
bats were recorded calling simultaneously. During analysis of sound files, it was possible to estimate the 
minimum number of bats recorded on individual sound files but not whether consecutive sound files had 
recorded, for example, a number of individual bats passing as they commute to a feeding habitat or one bat 
calling repeatedly as it flies up and down the edge of forestry.  Although relative abundance cannot be 
estimated from this analysis, the number of bat passes does reflect the relative importance of a 
feature/habitat to bats by assigning a level of bat activity that is associated with that feature, regardless of the 
type of activity. 
Analysis by sunset-sunrise times 
As part of the analysis of nocturnal patterns of behaviour for bats the data were split into discrete time 
periods relating to their proximity to sunset or sunrise. The time categories (time codes: TC) were as follows:  
TC 0 = before sunset 
TC 1 = 0-20 min after sunset 
TC 2 = 20-40 min after sunset 
TC 3 = 40-60 min after sunset 
TC 4 = 60-80 min after sunset 
TC 5 = 80-100 min after sunset 
TC 6 = 100-120 min after sunset 
TC 7 = Middle of night (varies across seasons) 
TC 8 = 120-100 min before sunrise 
TC 9 = 100-80 min before sunrise 
TC 10 = 80-60 min before sunrise 
TC 11 = 60-40 min before sunrise 
TC 12 = 40-20 min before sunrise  
TC 13 = 20-0 min before sunrise 
For each of these categories B/h was calculated to allow a comparison between the activity level recorded in 
different time periods and TC7 was corrected to allow for variation in night length throughout the survey 
season. 
 
 
 
Appendix 3: Building Descriptions 
Internal/External inspection 
The building layouts and referencing as described in the following section is illustrated in Appendix 1: 
Figures. In order to assist with the building descriptions, each building has been given a letter/number 
combination identifier.  
B1 
This is a two storey domestic property approximately 40-50 years old. It sits east to west on the Survey Site, 
with footprint dimensions 20 m x 8 m. The roof is constructed from hanging slate tiles and has a pronounced 
pitch, with boxed-in eaves on the gable ends. There are sections of lead flashing around the chimneys and 
eaves. There are opportunities for bat roosting in the following external features: 
• 
Under gaps in the eaves where boxed in sections have sagged or are broken; 
• 
Under lead flashing; 
• 
Under broken or missing hanging slate tiles; and 
• 
In space under ridge tiles. 
No internal inspection of this building was undertaken as it is currently inhabited and access was not granted. 
The building is considered to have moderate bat roosting potential. Although there are a number of features 
with potential to be used as bat roosts, there is no evidence that it is currently being utilised as a roost. 
N.B.     A shed in close proximity to B1 is constructed of wood cladding and has an open soffit into its roof 
space under felt. Owing to its high exposure and well-lit features, it was also deemed to have low potential 
for bat roosting potential. 
B2 
This property is a two storey domestic abode, approximately 40-50 years old but sitting 90° N of B1. This is 
an identical build to B1 but varies in specific features for roosting potential. There are opportunities for bat 
roosting in the following external features: 
• 
Under broken or missing hanging slate tiles on south facing roof and water heater to the east side of 
the property; 
• 
Under lead flashing around entrance, on the roof and gable ends; 
• 
Under lifted ridge tiles where lifted; and 
• 
In gaps between boxed eaves and flashing. 
No internal inspection of this building was undertaken as it is currently inhabited and access was not granted. 
The building is considered to have moderate bat roosting potential. Although there are a number of features 
with potential to be used as bat roosts, there is no evidence that is currently being utilised as a roost. 
B3 
This building is a corrugated metal framed agricultural building, its footprint dimensions are approximately 30 
mx20 m and it is situated on the south side of the Survey Site at the top of a track leading to a gallops track. 
The building is single storey with lower block curtain walling and with low profile metal sheet on the upper 
side of the walls and roof. It is currently being utilised as a stable for horses.  
Although there is lead flashing below the corrugated metal roof, upon internal inspection, an exposed interior 
with a lack of suitable roosting features means this building is considered to have negligible bat roosting 
potential. The building was however, considered to have some feeding potential. 
B4 
This is a stable block of stone, a solid wall construction, one storey tall. The roof is pitched with felt lined 
hanging tiles concluding in boxed eaves. There is considerable over hang in the boxed eaves. On internal 
inspection of the building there is a false ceiling made of plywood. 
• 
Room with partition and false ceiling, very dark; 
• 
Gaps above door frames; 
 
 
 
• 
Cracks in existing stable walls; 
• 
Space between breeze block gable ends (roof); and 
• 
Several open windows (1m in width, opening 1ft wide) and garage doors often ajar. 
B4 is a confirmed roost. There were stains and droppings (pipistrelle sp., long-eared bat sp. and lesser 
horseshoe) found upon internal investigation in one room of the stable block, and the majority of the building 
lends itself to roosting and feeding potential. 
B5 
This is a two storey terraced house approximately 50-60 years old. The roof is constructed from hanging 
slate tiles and has a pronounced pitch, with boxed-in eaves on the gable ends. There are sections of lead 
flashing around the chimneys and eaves. There are opportunities for bat roosting in the following external 
features: 
• 
Under gaps in the eaves where boxed in sections have sagged or are broken; 
• 
Under lifted lead flashing; 
• 
Under broken or missing hanging slate tiles; and 
• 
In space under ridge tiles. 
No internal inspection of this building was undertaken as it is currently inhabited and access was not granted. 
The building is considered to have moderate bat roosting potential. Although there are a number of features 
with potential to be used as bat roosts, no signs of roosts were found. 
B6 
This building is a corrugated metal framed agricultural building with lower block curtain walling and with low 
profile metal (and some plastic) sheet on the upper side of the walls and roof. The building is currently being 
utilised as storage for farm equipment such as disused vehicles & tools and hay bales. The footprint 
dimensions are roughly 30 m x 20 m and it is one storey tall. The area behind the hay bales at the far end of 
the building which is being used as stables for several horses could not be accessed for further investigation.  
No evidence of bats roosting was found during the internal/external search and no potential roost features 
were identified. Therefore this building is considered to have negligible potential for roosting bats. 
B7 
This is a single storey brick outbuilding with a corrugated metal roof. The building has several small vents 
and cavity walls. There are opportunities for bat roosting in the following features: 
• 
Accessible cavity walls through external vents. 
No evidence of bat roosting was found during the internal/external search and therefore this building is 
considered to have low potential for roosting bats. 
B8 
This building is comprised of three sections. The first two are part of the original structure which is over 100 
years old (est. 1900) and is constructed from brick walls with a corrugated, pitched metal roof with a series of 
fly ins and open access points on the roof apex. There is also a second storey tower on the north end of the 
building. The far north section is a single storey porta cabin style building approximately 4 m x 2 m with open 
windows and doors. There are opportunities for bat roosting in the following features: 
• 
Gaps under the corrugated metal roof; 
• 
In the stone vents/access points at the apex of the structure; 
• 
In the series of lead flashing found around the top of the tower portion of the main brick building; 
• 
Multiple fly-in opportunities in both storeys; and 
• 
In the tower block, historic roost evidence, several small piles of disintegrated droppings, identified 
as long-eared bat Plecotus auritus droppings and at least one Pipistrelle sp. in both first and second storeys. 
B8 is a confirmed roost. There were droppings from at least two bat species found upon internal investigation 
of both storeys and the majority of the building lends itself to roosting and feeding potential. 
 
 
 
 
 
B9 
This building is a single storey breeze block shed of recent build with a footprint of 3 m x 3 m. The building 
has solid walls and a flat corrugated metal roof. No evidence or potential or actual roost points were noted 
upon internal or external investigation.  
Owing to the lack of signs and potential roosting features this building is considered to have negligible bat 
roosting potential. 
B10 
This property is a single storey, one-room brick outbuilding with footprint dimensions of 4 m x 3 m. The 
building has no doors or windows and the roof is concrete and flat with the internal ceiling exhibiting cracks 
and fissures. The brick walls are cavity walls with many missing bricks and openings. Although there is no 
door, there is an east facing entrance. Upon internal investigation two Pipistrelle sp. droppings were found 
on the floor. There are opportunities for bat roosting in the following features: 
• 
Cavity walls with missing bricks; 
• 
East facing entrance, fly-in; 
• 
Cracked ceiling; and 
• 
Also, bat droppings found in building. 
This building is a confirmed roost owing to the discovery of bat droppings and a variety of optimal features for 
roosting potential.  
B11 
This is a derelict stone cottage over 100 years old. Its footprint dimensions are 15 m x 10 m. There are two 
distinct standing walls and there is no roof remaining. The walls are rubble filled and many stones are 
missing. There are opportunities for bat roosting in the following features: 
• 
Missing stones leading to rubble filled internal wall. 
Because the structure sits in a cluster of trees and has some notable roosting features, this building is 
considered to have moderate roosting potential.

Introduction
1.1
Introduction
1.1.1
AECOM was commissioned to undertake a suite of ecological survey work to
inform the Abergelli Power Project (the “Project”).
1.1.2
The Project Site is located near to the village of Felindre, Swansea, as shown in
Figure 1, and the central grid reference for the Project Site is SN65280143. A full
description of the development is provided in Chapter 3 (Project and Site
Description) of the Environmental Statement (ES).
1.1.3    The Preliminary Ecological Appraisal Report (ES Appendix 8.1) identified that    sur
veys
for
hazel 
dormouse
Muscardinus 
avellanarius
hereafter 
called 
‘dormouse’ or ‘dormice’, were required at the Project Site.
1.1.4
This baseline report describes the status of dormouse within the dormouse survey
area
and
makes
initial indications of potential effects and outlines initial
recommendations for further surveys, mitigation and enhancement.
1.1.5
The dormouse survey area encompasses all suitable and accessible areas of
woodland, hedgerows and scrub within proximity of and within the Project Site
boundary, as shown on Figure 1 and Figure 2.
1.1.6
Previous surveys have been undertaken by BSG Ecology which are presented in
the ES Appendix 8.15.
a)
Objectives of the Study
1.1.7
The objectives of this study were:
·
To identify any designated nature conservation sites within or in the vicinity of
the Project Site boundary that have the potential to support dormouse;
·
To identify any known records and/or populations of dormouse in the vicinity of
the Project Site boundary;
·
To record and map evidence of dormouse activity;
·
To make a population estimate of dormouse within the Project Site;
·
To make an initial ecological assessment of the Project Site in respect to
dormouse;
·
To highlight any initial potential ecological constraints in respect to dormouse;
·
To outline further survey work that may be required; and,
·
To make initial suggestions for mitigation, compensation and enhancement of
the natural features identified within the Project Site in respect to dormouse.

1.2
Legislation
1.2.1
The dormouse is a fully protected species under both United Kingdom and
European law. It is also included in the Environment Act (Wales) 2016 Section 7
List as a species of principal importance. This is a brief summary of the legislation
and is not to be regarded as a definitive legal opinion. When dealing with individual
cases, the client is advised to consult the full texts of the relevant legislation and
obtain further legal advice.
1.2.2
The dormouse was given partial protection under the Wildlife and Countryside Act
(WCA) 1981. Schedule 5 of this Act was amended in 1988 making it a fully
protected species. Protection is also afforded by Schedule 2 of the Conservation
(Natural Habitats &c.) Regulations 1994, making the dormouse a European
Protected Species.
These two pieces of legislation operate in parallel, although
there are some small differences in scope and wording.
1.2.3
The WCA 1981 transposes into UK law the Convention on the Conservation of
European Wildlife and Natural Habitats (commonly referred to as the ‘Bern
Convention’). The 1981 Act has been amended several times, most recently by the
Countryside and Rights of Way ((CRoW)) Act 2000, which added ‘or recklessly’ to
Section 9(4)(a) and (b). Dormice are listed on Schedule 5 of the 1981 Act, and are
therefore subject to the provisions of Section 9, which makes it an offence to:
·
Intentionally kill, injure or take a dormouse ((Section 9(1)));
·
Possess or control any live or dead specimen or anything derived from a
dormouse ((S 9(2))) (unless it can be shown to have been legally acquired);
·
Intentionally or recklessly damage, destroy or obstruct access to any structure
or place used for shelter or protection by a dormouse ((S 9(4)(a))); and,
·
Intentionally or recklessly disturb a dormouse while it is occupying a structure
or place which it uses for that purpose ((S9(4)(b))).
1.2.4
The Conservation (Natural Habitats &c.) Regulations (known as the Habitats
Regulations) transpose into UK law Council Directive 92/43/EEC of 21st May 1992
on the Conservation of Natural Habitats and of Wild Fauna and Flora (often
referred to as the ‘Habitats ((and Species)) Directive’). Dormice are listed on Annex
IV (‘European Protected Species’) of the Directive meaning that member states are
required to put in place a system of strict protection as outlined in Article 12; this is
done through inclusion on Schedule 2 of the Regulations. Regulation 39 makes it
an offence to:
·
Deliberately capture or kill a dormouse (Regulation 39(1)(a));
·
Deliberately disturb a dormouse (R. 39(1)(b));
·
Damage or destroy a breeding site or resting place of a dormouse (R. 39(1)(d));
and/or,
·
Keep, transport, sell or exchange, or offer for sale or exchange a live or dead
dormouse or any part of a dormouse (R. 39(2)).

All AECOM Ecologists who worked on this project are members of (at the
appropriate level) the Chartered Institute of Ecology and Environmental
Management (CIEEM) and follow their code of professional conduct (CIEEM, 2013)
when undertaking ecological work.
2.
Methodology
2.1
Desk study
2.1.1
The objective of the desk study is to review the existing information available in the
public domain concerning species and habitats to identify the following:
·
Internationally and nationally designated sites for dormouse, up to 2 km from
the Site using the Multi Agency Geographic Information for the Countryside
(MAGIC) website (NE, 2017);
·
Dormouse records and records of locally designated sites for dormouse up to 2
km from the Site, using the South East Wales Biodiversity Records Centre
(SEWBReC);
·
Dormouse within the Section 7 list of Principal Importance for Conservation of
Biological Diversity in Wales;
·
Ancient Semi-Natural Woodland (ASNW), Plantation on Ancient Woodland Site
(PAWS), Restored Ancient Woodland Site (RAWS) or Ancient Woodland Site
of Unknown category (AWSU) within or adjacent to the Project Site using
Ancient Woodland Inventory 2011 dataset downloaded from the Lle website
(WG and NRW, 2017);
·
Local knowledge of dormouse species and habitats from the County Ecologist;
·
Local knowledge of dormouse species and habitats from the South Wales
Mammal Group (SWMG) and,
·
Features of ecological interest surrounding the Project Site, nearby areas of
ecological interest and features connecting these habitats (hedgerows,
watercourses, railway lines) using aerial photographs and Ordnance Survey
(OS) maps.
2.1.2
The reports of previous surveys undertaken by BSG Ecology were provided by the
client and were reviewed.

2.2
Dormouse Survey
2.2.1
Dormouse surveys were undertaken paying due regard to the Dormouse
Conservation Handbook (Bright, et al., 2006).
Nest survey tubes (n=129) were
installed on 24 and 25 May 2017 in suitable habitat as shown in Figure 2.  The
survey tubes were retrieved on 20 November 2017.
2.2.2
Bright, et.al. (2006) provides guidance on survey effort requirements, using an
Index of Probability of finding dormice present in nest tubes in any one month. The
Index of Probability is based on using 50 nest tubes as a standard. A copy of The
Index of Probability scores is provided in Table 1.1.
2.2.3
Chanin and Woods (2003) recommend that assumed absence of dormice should
not be based on a Search Effort Score of less than 20. The Search Effort Score is
calculated by adding the Index of Probability scores for the months in which the
survey was undertaken. For example using the values in Table 2.1. If all surveys
were undertaken in all months the Search Effort Score would be 25.

2.2.4
Tubes were inspected in June, August, September October and November 2017
(see Section 1.5 in Limitations) for any presence of dormouse and any signs,
particularly for recently constructed nests. One licensed dormouse surveyor was
present during all visits.
Tube inspection was undertaken using flashlight or by
sliding the nest tube trays open.
Survey dates and personnel are given in Table
2.2.

2.2.5
Using Table 2.1, the Search Effort Score for the 2017 dormouse surveys meets the
minimum score of 20. As the minimum score has been met and considering that the
number of tubes used for the surveys is greater than the minimum of 50 used to
calculate the Index of Probability score, the survey provides a robust assessment of
presence or likely absence of dormouse in the survey area.
2.3
Limitations
2.3.1
Biological records can be received from a wide variety of sources and may or may
not be comprehensive and accurate. However, if assessed in conjunction with a
survey, they can contribute to a robust ecological assessment of a site.
2.3.2
Following best practice guidelines (Bright, et al., 2006) the best time to set out
dormouse tubes is in March and it is best to leave dormouse tubes out for an entire
season from March onwards, for checking in November. However this could not be
achieved as access to the suitable areas for dormouse nest tube deployment was
not granted until late May 2017 and time constraints of the Project meant that they
could not be left for an entire season.
However, the tubes were deployed and
surveyed within suitable survey months and will still be suitable to determine the
presence or absence of dormice within the Project Site. Furthermore, Chanin and
Woods (2003) identified that the length of time tubes are deployed is less important
than the time of year. Leaving them out from early March to the end of November
will give the highest probability of detecting dormice if they are present.  With a
minor peak of tube use in May and a more substantial one in August and
September, it would be best to ensure that tubes are installed no later than April
and finally checked no earlier than October. As an absolute minimum they
recommend that tubes are installed before the end of July and finally checked after
the end of September.  Given the evidence above and meeting the minimum
Search Effort Score of 20, the deployment of the nest tubes in May is not deemed
to be a significant limitation. A survey was not undertaken in July. Instead, two
surveys were undertaken in August; one at the beginning of the month and one at
the end of the month. Therefore, this is not deemed to be a significant limitation.
2.3.3
On 26 June 2017 not all the tubes could be located due to extensive vegetation
cover; 93 tubes were checked on this occasion, on all other occasions all of the
tubes were checked.
On 29 August 2017 three tubes had to be repositioned as
they had fallen. On 29 September three tubes had to be repositioned as they had
fallen.
On 17 October 2017 it was noted that one of the tubes had fallen and
snapped in half. These incidents are not deemed to be a significant limitation.

(Wales) 2016 Section
7
Dormouse is listed on the Wales Section 7 list.
Surrounding Land
Use
The Project Site is located to the north of Junction 46 of the M4
Motorway close to the village of Felindre, Swansea.
The Project Site has agricultural fields to the east, south and
north. Areas of woodland are located to the south, east and west
of the Site.
Areas of the National Grid Power Station with
associated roads and buildings are partially within and adjacent to
the Project Site boundary. A water treatment works is located in
the north west outside of the Project Site boundary.
Previous Surveys
undertaken by BSG
Ecology
The client provided AECOM with the reports of previous surveys
undertaken in 2014 by BSG Ecology within the Site (ES Appendix
8.15).  The Site boundary included within these reports is different
to the 2017 Project Site boundary.
It was noted that the 2017 Project Site boundary is smaller than
the red line boundary used by BSG Ecology in 2014.  However,
the current Project Site boundary is within the same area as the
2014 red line boundary provided to BSG Ecology and therefore
the surveys undertaken would have captured the current Project
Site area.
The 2014 BSG Ecology Dormouse Report did not identify any
dormice or evidence of dormice in the 2014 survey period. A total
of 143 tubes were deployed across the months of May and June
2014, and checked on six occasions between the months of June
and November (ES Appendix 8.15).

Conclusions and Recomendations
4.1.1
No dormice or evidence of dormice have been identified within the Project Site.
4.1.2
Given the negative results of the field surveys from 2017, the negative results of the
BSG Ecology surveys from 2014 (ES Appendix 8.15), and the lack of records from
SEWBReC of dormouse from within 2 km it is likely that dormouse is absent from
the Project Site.
4.1.3
A full assessment of required further surveys has been made during EcIA and will
be reported in the ES. At this stage it is anticipated that no further surveys will be
required for dormouse.
4.2
Recommendations for Mitigation
4.2.1
A full series of recommendations for further surveys and mitigation at construction
and operation has been undertaken for the EcIA and will be reported in the ES. At
this stage a European Protected Species Licence (EPSL) for dormice is not
required and no recommendations are required for mitigation as dormice are
considered likely absent from the Project Site.
4.3
Recommendations for Biodiversity Enhancement
4.3.1
A full series of recommendations for biodiversity enhancement has been made
during the EcIA and reported in the ES. At this stage the following preliminary
recommendations have been made for general biodiversity enhancements:
·
Maintain connectivity within the landscape by avoiding the severance of tree
lines, woodland edges, hedgerows and dense scrub; and,
·
Improve the connectivity of the Project Site by planting new hedgerows, infilling
current gaps in hedgerows with whips and creating green corridors. It is
recommended to use native species.

Introduction
1.1
Introduction
1.1.1
AECOM was commissioned to undertake a suite of ecological survey work to
inform the Abergelli Power Project (the “Project”).
1.1.2
The Project Site is located near to the village of Felindre, Swansea, as shown in
Figure 1.1, and the central grid reference for the Site is SN 6528 0143. A full
description of the Project is provided in Chapter 3: Project and Site Description of
the Environmental Statement.
1.1.3
The Preliminary Ecological Appraisal Report (Appendix 8.1) identified that surveys
for otter Lutra lutra and water vole Arvicola amphibius were required at the Project
Site.
1.1.4
This baseline report outlines the presence of otter and water vole within the otter
and water vole survey area and outlines initial recommendations for further
surveys, mitigation and enhancement.
1.1.5
The otter and water vole survey area encompasses all suitable and accessible
watercourses within the Project Site boundary and within a 100 m radius from the
Project Site boundary, as shown on Figure 1.1.
1.1.6
Previous surveys have been undertaken by BSG Ecology and supported the 2014
ES Ecology Chapter which are presented in the ES Appendix 8.14.
1.2
Objectives of the Survey
1.2.1
The objectives of this survey were:
·
To identify any designated nature conservation sites within or in the vicinity of
the Project Site boundary that have the potential to support otter and water
vole;
·
To identify any known records and/or populations of otter or water vole in the
vicinity of the Project Site boundary;
·
To record and map evidence of otter and water vole;
·
To make an initial ecological assessment of the Project Site boundary in
respect to otter and water vole;
·
To highlight any initial potential ecological constraints in respect to otter and
water vole;
·
To outline further survey work that may be required; and,
·
To make initial suggestions for mitigation, compensation and enhancement of
the natural features identified on the within the Project Site boundary in respect
to otter and water vole.

1.3
Legislation
a)
Otter Legislation
1.3.1
Otters are a European Protected Species under The Conservation of Habitats and
Species Regulations 2010 (as amended), known as the ‘Habitats Regulations’,
making it an offence to:
·
deliberately capture, injure or kill an otter;
·
deliberately disturb an otter; and
·
damage or destroy a breeding site or resting place of an otter.
1.3.2
Disturbance is defined as that which is likely to impair their ability:
·
to survive, to breed or reproduce, or to rear or nurture their young, or
·
in the case of animals of a hibernating or migratory species, to hibernate or
migrate; or
·
to affect significantly the local distribution or abundance of the species to which
they belong.
1.3.3
Under the Wildlife and Countryside Act 1981(as amended) it is illegal to:
·
intentionally or recklessly disturb any otter while it is occupying a structure or
place which it uses for shelter or protection;
·
intentionally or recklessly obstructs access to any structure or place used by an
otter for shelter or protection; and,
·
sell, offer or expose for sale any otter.
1.3.4
A Natural Resources Wales licence would be required for any works likely to
constitute an offence in respect to otters.
b)
Water Vole Legislation
1.3.5
The water vole is listed on Schedule 5 of the Wildlife and Countryside Act 1981 (as
amended), for which the following are offences:
·
Intentional killing, injuring or taking;
·
Intentionally or recklessly damaging/destroying a place of shelter/protection;
·
Intentionally or recklessly disturbing an animal in its place of shelter/protection;
·
Intentionally or recklessly obstructing access to its place of shelter/protection;
and,
·
Possession (live or dead, including derivatives), sale and offering for sale.
1.4

1.4.2
All AECOM Ecologists who worked on this Project are members of (at the
appropriate level) the Chartered Institute of Ecology and Environmental
Management (CIEEM) and follow their code of professional conduct (CIEEM, 2013)
when undertaking ecological work.
2.
Methodology
2.1
Desk study
2.1.1
The objective of the desk study is to review the existing information available in the
public domain concerning species and habitats to identify the following:
·
Internationally and nationally designated sites for otter and water vole, up to 2
km from the Site using the Multi Agency Geographic Information for the
Countryside (MAGIC) website (www.magic.gov.uk);
·
Otter and water vole records and records of locally designated sites for otter
and water vole up to 2 km from the Site, using the South East Wales
Biodiversity Records Centre (SEWBReC);
·
The Section 7 list of Principal Importance for Conservation of Biological
Diversity in Wales was reviewed for inclusion of otter and water vole; and,
·
Aerial photographs and Ordnance Survey (OS) maps were reviewed to identify
features of ecological interest surrounding the Site, nearby areas of ecological
interest and features connecting these habitats (hedgerows, watercourses,
railway lines).
2.1.2
The reports of previous surveys undertaken by BSG Ecology were provided by the
client and were reviewed.
2.2
Otter Survey
2.2.1
The Phase 1 Habitat map (Appendix 8.1) and OS mapping were used to identify
watercourses within the Project Site boundary and within a 100 m radius of the
Project Site boundary.
2.2.2
Surveys for otter were conducted by AECOM ecologists on 18 July 2017 under
suitable weather conditions. A detailed visual search of the watercourses within the
otter survey area was undertaken.
2.2.3
Searches for otter activity were undertaken following guidance provided in
Monitoring the otter Lutra lutra (Chanin and Smith, 2003). The survey methodology
involved recording all evidence of otter activity, which is detailed below.
·
Holt entrances – holes characteristically in river banks or under tree roots at
river edges.
·
Couch – typically an above-ground nest-like structure used as a resting place;
·
Footprints – five toes which arch around the front of a large pad. In soft ground
claw marks and webs between toes may show. Often seen in sand or soft mud
deposits along rivers and under river bridges;
·
Otter trails through vegetation – otters use the same routes within their territory
to access rivers, so the paths are usually worn leading down the banks to the
Abergelli ES 2018 – OTTER AND WATER VOLE SURVEY REPORT

AECOM
6
river and may have a ‘slide’ at the end of well-worn mud as they slide into the
water;
·
Spraint – found in prominent locations adjacent or along a river, for example on
tree stumps, large rocks and ledges under bridges. Sometimes otters may build
a ‘castle’ of soft mud or sand along a river to spraint on top of. Spraints are
made up of clearly visible fish bones and scales, with some other small bones,
fur, feather and insect fragments sometimes present. Fresh spraint is usually
black, tarry and sticky.  It has a distinctive sweet-musky odour, which is not
unpleasant;
·
Anal jelly – a jelly-like secretion that smells strongly of otter and can vary in
colour from pale brown, greenish to amber; and
·
Other signs – for example, occasionally remains of dead otters can be seen on
roads.
2.3
Water Vole Survey
2.3.1
The Phase 1 Habitat map (Appendix 8.1) and OS mapping were used to identify
watercourses within the Project Site boundary and with a 100m radius of the
Project Site boundary.
2.3.2
Surveys for water vole were conducted by AECOM ecologists on two separate
visits on the 28th June 2017 and 29th September 2017. This is to allow for variations
in habitat suitability across the season and because water voles are increasingly
being shown to utilise different areas at different times of year. A detailed visual
search of the watercourses within the water vole survey area was undertaken.
2.3.3
The survey methodology used was in accordance with the Water Vole
Conservation Handbook (Strachan and Moorhouse, 2011). This consisted of
identifying the extent and distribution of water vole through searches of both banks
(where possible) of watercourses for field signs indicating recent activity (i.e.
feeding stations and latrines), as well as signs of past and potentially present
activity (i.e. burrows). Where conditions allowed, a surveyor walked in the
watercourse channel to check for field signs along the water’s edge.
2.3.4
The survey methodology involved recording all evidence of water vole activity,
which is detailed below.
·
Faeces – these are 8 – 12mm long and 4 – 5mm wide, with a smooth ‘tic tac’
like shape, varying in colour from green to black, and odourless with a putty-like
texture;
·
Latrines – found throughout the territory, often comprising a pile of flattened
droppings, with fresh droppings on top, used to mark range boundaries or
favoured spots close to burrows;
·
Feeding stations – comprise a neat pile of chewed feeding remains, often
comprising lengths of vegetation up to 10cm long, showing the marks of the
two large incisors;
·
Burrows – these are typically wider than they are high, with a diameter of 4 –
8cm, and are usually located along the water’s edge;
Abergelli ES 2018 – OTTER AND WATER VOLE SURVEY REPORT

·
Lawns – around burrows there is often an area of grazed vegetation,
surrounded by taller vegetation, these are most often produced when the
female is nursing young;
·
Nests – these comprise a large ball of shredded material, often woven into the
bases of rushes and reeds, and are normally found in areas where the water
table is high, such as wetlands;
·
Footprints – as with other rodents, the footprints of the fore foot, show four toes
in a star arrangement, with the hind foot showing five toes.  The size of
footprints for the hind foot is 26-34mm; and,
·
Runways – these are low tunnels within the vegetation, often adjacent to the
water’s edge; and
2.3.5
The presence of water vole can also be confirmed by sightings and from the
characteristic ‘plop’ of the water vole entering the water, which acts as a warning to
other voles.
2.3.6
Latrines are indicators of territorial behaviour, which in turn generally correlates with
water vole breeding activity. For the presentation of water vole distribution data,
sections of the ditch where latrines were identified would be illustrated as “Breeding
Activity”, and sections of the ditch where evidence other than latrines was identified
would be illustrated as “Non-Breeding Activity”.
2.4
Limitations
2.4.1
Biological records can be received from a wide variety of sources and may or may
not be comprehensive and accurate. However, if assessed in conjunction with a
survey, they can contribute to a robust ecological assessment of a site.
2.4.2
There was heavy rain the night before the second survey on the 29th September
2017 which had the potential to wash away spraint or faeces evidence.
2.4.3
Two watercourses (Afon Llan and a tributary of the Afon Llan) were not accessible
at the time of survey due to dense vegetation obscuring the view of the banks, and
land access permissions. These watercourses were partially viewed and were
assessed as having suitability to support both species. There is potential for signs
of both species to have gone unrecorded.

undertaken by BSG
Ecology
An otter spraint was identified during the previous surveys (ES
Appendix 8.14), the location of which is approximately 500m east
of the Project Site boundary and the watercourse on which it was
found flows through the Project Site.
Holes, that were likely to be mammal burrows, were observed.
The holes have the right dimensions to allow use by water voles
but did not show signs of current occupation. No latrines,
footprints or grazing lawns were observed during the survey (ES
Appendix 8.14).

Conclusions
5.1
Otter
5.1.1
A total of thirteen watercourses within the otter survey area were suitable for
supporting commuting otter and two watercourses were suitable for supporting
foraging otter, holt and couch creation. One potential couch was identified with a
trampled vegetation track leading to it which suggested occasional use by a
mammal. Two mammal tracks were identified; these may have been fox or another
mammal. No spraints, holts, footprints, anal jelly or other signs were identified
during the surveys.
5.1.2
Due to the confirmed presence of otter upstream from the Project Site in 2015 and
the presence of spraints and a footprint from a nearby pond in May 2017 it can be
concluded that otters are still active in the locality. As such it is likely that otters use
the suitable watercourses (numbers 10, 11, 12, 14, 15, 41, 43 and 45) within the
otter survey area and Project Site boundary for occasional forging, commuting,
resting and holt creation (although no evidence of holts was identified during the
survey).
5.2
Water Vole
5.2.1
Four watercourses that had potential for supporting water vole were recorded within
the water vole survey area (15, 43, 46 and 48). Two of these (15 and 45) had
limited potential for water vole due to the relative isolation of these watercourses
within the landscape (i.e. not connected to watercourses with potential to support
water vole). However, it should be noted that some watercourses could not be
adequately surveyed due to dense vegetation and therefore signs may have been
missed. Burrows suitable for water vole were found (watercourses 15 and 43) but
there was no evidence of current occupancy. It was therefore not possible to
determine if the burrows had been excavated by brown rat or water vole. There
were no records of water vole from SEWBReC, and it appears likely that water vole
are absent from the water vole survey area.
5.3
Recommendations
a)
Recommendations for Further Surveys
5.3.1
A full assessment of required further surveys has been made during EcIA and
reported in the ES. At this stage the following recommendations have been made:
·
Due to the time that would have elapsed between the otter and water vole
survey and the proposed construction start date it is recommended that a pre-
construction survey for otters and water voles is undertaken on suitable
watercourses to check for activity or any newly created holts or couches, or
burrows. The survey will focus on watercousres and water bodies likely to be
impatcted by the propsed works.

AECOM
19
b)
Recommendations for Mitigation
5.3.2
A full series of recommendations for mitigation at construction and operation has
been undertaken for the EcIA and reported in the S. Further recommendations may
be made as a result of the outcome of the pre-construction survey. At this stage the
following key recommendations have been made:
·
An exclusion area of 100 m will be established around any newly identified otter
holts and resting places prior to works commencing and further advice will be
sought from Natural Resources Wales.
·
An exclusion area of 10 m will be established around any newly identified
owater vole burrows prior to works commencing and further advice will be
sought from Natural Resources Wales.
·
Access to open-water habitats must be safeguarded at all times; effects to
newly identified established otter paths and traditional routes between such
areas (such as field drains) during the construction phase should be minimised.
·
Habitat loss should be compensated – particularly key habitat types for the
species.
·
A buffer should be in place during construction to prevent pollution and/or run
off into the watercourses/water bodies.
c)
Recommendations for Biodiversity Enhancement
5.3.3
A full series of recommendations for biodiversity enhancement has been made
during the EcIA and reported in the ES. Further recommendations may be made as
a result of the outcome of the pre-construction survey. At this stage the following
precautionary recommendations have been made:
·
Habitat restoration or enhancement works.

INTRODUCTION
1.1
Overview
1.1.1
Parsons Brinckerhoff has been commissioned by Abergelli Power Ltd
(ALP) to undertake a BS5837: 2012 “Trees in Relation to Design
Demolition and Construction – recommendations” (BS5837)
arboriculture survey in relation to the proposed 299MW gas-fired
‘peaking’ plant at Abergelli Farm Felindre, near Swansea (hereafter
referred to as ‘the Project’).
1.2
Context
1.2.1
The Arboriculture Survey Report is required in support of an application
for Development Consent as an Appendix to the Environmental
Statement (ES) for the Project.
1.3
Purpose
1.3.1
The purpose of this report is to assess all qualifying trees, groups of
trees, hedges and woodland (individuals with a stem diameter of at
least 75mm measured at 1.5m above ground level) within the survey
areas (identified as “project site” within the Tree Constraints Plan at
appendix D)and those where the Root Protection Areas (RPA) may be
affected by the Project as defined in BS5837
1.3.2
Parsons Brinckerhoff Ltd carried out the BS5837 Arboriculture Survey
between 17th and 19th September 2014 and on 18th November 2014.
1.4
Planning and Legislative Context
1.4.1
This report has been carried out in accordance with the most recently
published (30th April 2012) BS5837 which updates the previous
BS5837 of 2005 by:
· 
Taking account of current practice regarding planning for the
management, protection and planting of trees in the vicinity of
structures, and for the protection of structures near trees;
· 
Updating the guidance in relation to building regulations; and
· 
Recognising the contribution that trees make to climate change
adaptation.
1.4.2
Trees are a material consideration in the UK planning system, and
existing trees are an important factor on construction sites, whether on
or near the working areas. BS 5837 2012 Arboriculture reports are
intended to assist decision-making, by ensuring consideration is given
Abergelli Power BS5837 Arboriculture
Survey Report
Arboriculture Report
Prepared by Parsons Brinckerhoff
November 2014
for Abergelli Power
- 10 -
to existing and proposed trees in the context of design, demolition and
construction.
1.4.3
The primary source of protection afforded to trees is through the
application of Tree Preservation Orders (TPO) as part of the Town and
Country Planning (Tree Preservation) (England) Regulations 2012
which came into effect on April 6th 2012. There are two offences under
this Act:
· 
in contravention of tree preservation regulations: cut down, uproot
or wilfully destroy a protected tree; or to damage, top or lop it
wilfully in such a manner as to be likely to destroy it; or to cause
and permit any such activity; and
· 
to carry out any other works in contravention of tree preservation
regulations.
1.4.4
It has been confirmed that there are no tree preservation orders with
the survey site.
1.4.5
 In recent years greater weight has been added to the protection of
ancient and veteran trees within our landscape. This is reflected in the
recent update to Planning Policy Wales which states “Ancient and Semi
Natural woodlands are irreplaceable habitats of high biodiversity value
which should be protected from development that would result in
significant damage” (paragraph 5.2.9).
1.4.6
 The Forestry Act of 1967 requires any person wishing to fell trees to
apply for a felling licence before those works are undertaken. There are
many exemptions to this requirement that often reflect good forest and
woodland management and other exemptions that may be reasonably
expected such as dead, diseased or dangerous trees. Exemptions are
also afford to works required to facilitate planning consent

METHODOLOGY
2.1
Survey
2.1.1
The trees on the survey site qualifying for survey were inspected and
classified, by a competent arboriculture consultant with regard to
BS5837.  The trees were classified in accordance with BS5837: 2012
tree quality assessment categories A, B, C and U, as set out in Table 1
and 2 of the British Standard. Qualifying trees are defined as individual
trees with a stem diameter of at least 75 mm measured at 1.5 m above
ground level.
2.1.2
All trees within the survey site were inspected from ground level using
the Visual Tree Assessment (VTA) method. VTA assessment is a non-
invasive method for ascertaining the physiological and structural
condition of trees. The method requires the use of a Thor 10 nylon
acoustic mallet, and a wire probe.
2.1.3
The VTA was undertaken on the above ground portion of the trees. No
aerial inspection, sampling, or excavations for the purpose of soil or
root analysis were undertaken. Binoculars were used to inspect the
upper parts of the tree canopy from ground level, if required.
2.1.4
To allow the assessment of trees on site to be completed in a
practicable way and to best reflect the tree population on site, where
trees formed groups either aerodynamically, through mutual support or
by forming a screen or other such feature they have been recorded as
such. This is a widely used method and is supported by Section 4.4.2.3
of BS 5837: 2012.
2.2
Survey Limitations
2.2.1
Trees are large dynamic organisms, influenced by a variety of
environmental variables, whose health and condition can change
rapidly.  Due to the changeable nature of trees and other site and
environmental considerations which may influence the trees, this
report, and any recommendations made within it are valid for a period
of 12 months from the date of the site survey (November 2014).
2.2.2
Although comments and recommendations on the safety of particular
trees may have been made, this survey is not a tree hazard
assessment and should not be used as such.
2.2.3
Any management recommendations have been made in accordance
with BS 3998: 2010 “Tree Works – Recommendations” and industry
best practice. Works have been recommended in accordance with any
statutory obligations owed by the land owners or occupiers.

RESULTS
3.1
Overview
3.1.1
None of the trees within the survey site were found to be of such poor
condition that urgent remedial work was required.
3.1.2
The hedge recorded as part of this survey was not made the subject of
detailed assessment for their importance in relation to the Hedgerow
Regulations.
3.2
Site Context
3.2.1
Many of the trees within the survey site were of reasonable but not
outstanding quality. Due to the relatively low hedges and open field
systems mature trees are locally prominent in the landscape.
3.2.2
The following features were recorded during the survey and recorded in
the Tree Survey Schedule in Appendix A and plotted on the Tree
Constraints Plan in Appendix D:
· 
Woodlands 1 and 2;
· 
Groups 1 to 6;
· 
Hedge 1; and
· 
Trees 922 to 924.
3.2.3
Where access was not possible, trees were listed as A to C. These
trees were not tagged and stem diameters were estimated using
neighbouring trees as a reference.
3.3
Notable Features
3.3.1
Woodland 1 is designated as Ancient Woodland and a Site of
Importance for Nature Conservation (SINC). It is relatively open
woodland with birch as the dominant species in most areas. Many of
the birch trees are in full maturity and will start to decline over the next
20 to 30 years. This is due to the fungal pathogen Piptoporus betulinus
(birch strop fungi) which is dormant in birch trees for most of their life
becoming active when the tree suffers a wound or bark lesion. The
fruiting body of this fungi is clearly visible on many of the birch within
this woodland.  It is important to note that the decline of the birch within
the woodland is not a sign of ill health or poor quality within the
woodland. The decline of the birch will make way for the oak and ash
within the woodland to succeed and form woodland with greater
longevity.

3.3.2
Woodland 2 to the south of the National Grid Access Road is
designated as Ancient Woodland and a SINC. However, it is of
relatively low quality with the oldest individuals within the woodland
being no more than 80 or 90 years old and the majority being under 50
years old. The woodland would benefit from management and creation
of a more structured woodland edge.
3.3.3
The trees to the north of the National Grid Access Road at this location
(within Group 1) are also located within Ancient Woodland and a SINC.
They are of greater quality individually than those within the Woodland
2 and when considered as parts of the hedge form a linear feature
providing connectivity east to west. The existing National Grid Access
Road extends in places to almost 2 m under the saplings, bramble and
leaf litter that has accumulated at the edge of the clear area.
3.3.4
Many of the individual trees on site such as those within groups 5 and 6
have grown from former hedge lines or are formed from outgrown
hedge trees. Browsing by horses has caused bark damage in some
areas.
3.3.5
Groups 3, 4 and 6 will require pruning and in some cases minor felling
to allow construction traffic pass safely without causing damage to the
vehicles or vegetation. Pruning should be carried out in accordance
with Section 154 of the Highway Act 1980 to a height of 5.2m above the
carriage way.  These works are not considered to be a significant
impact.

CONCLUSION
4.1.1
The presence of trees on the Project Site is not considered to be an
obstruction to the Project. Careful consideration of trees at all stages of
the development process will ensure that existing trees of high
retention value are retained and protected throughout the Project.
Suitable mitigation for any tree loss should be designed into the Project
from the outset.
4.1.2
The Tree Constraints Plan (TCP), in Appendix D, will be used as a tool
to inform the Project design, the practicalities of implementing the
Project throughout construction and the final landscaping / mitigation
planting.
4.1.3
Table 1 of BS 5837 (shown in Appendix B) defines Category C trees as
“Trees of low quality with an estimated remaining life expectancy of at
least 10 years, or young trees with a stem diameter below 150mm”.
With this point in mind, Category C trees can potentially be removed if
suitable justification is given and appropriate mitigation provided.
4.1.4
British Standard 5837 provides a specification for protective fencing as
shown in Appendix C. Although this fencing is perfectly suitable for
individual significant trees it is not always practical for large areas of
fencing. With this in mind it is recommended that for large areas
fencing constructed of wooden post and netting with appropriate
signage may be used.

Summary 
1.1 
Abergelli Power Limited (APL) is promoting a new Power Generation Plant on agricultural land 
within Abergelli Farm north of Swansea in the City and County of Swansea (approximately at 
National Grid Reference 265284, 201431).   
1.2 
The Power Generation Plant would operate as a Simple Cycle Gas Turbine (SCGT) peaking plant 
and would be designed to provide an electrical capacity of up to 299 Megawatts (MW).  It would be 
fuelled by natural gas, supplied by a new underground gas pipeline connecting the Power 
Generation Plant to the existing National Grid Gas (NGG) National Transmission System (NTS).   
1.3 
BSG Ecology has been appointed as the ecological consultant to undertake a preliminary 
ecological appraisal, which includes a desk study and Extended Phase 1 Habitat Survey. This 
preliminary survey will inform the subsequent need for further, targeted surveys of protected and 
otherwise notable species and habitats.  
1.4 
The preliminary ecological survey has identified two European designated sites within 10km, five 
statutory designated sites for ecology (four Sites of Special Scientific Interest (SSSIs) and one 
Local Nature Reserve (LNR)) within 5km, and twenty-three non-statutory designated Sites of 
Importance for Nature Conservation (SINC) within 2km of the Survey Site boundary. Three of the 
SINCs are partially within the Survey Site boundary, and a further two are adjacent. Much of the 
woodland on the Survey Site is also designated as Ancient Woodland. Direct impacts on SINCs 
and Ancient Woodland within and close to the Survey Site boundary could occur, depending on the 
final layout of the Power Generation Plant.     
1.5 
Three Section 421 habitats (‘lowland mixed deciduous woodland’, ‘purple moor-grass and rush 
pasture’ and ‘ponds’) are present within the Survey Site.  
1.6 
There is habitat in the Survey Site that has the potential to support European Protected Species 
(EPS) including bats, great crested newts Triturus cristatus, dormouse Muscardinus avellanarius 
and otter Lutra lutra.  There are also habitats suitable for nationally protected species such as 
reptiles and water voles Arvicola amphibius. Information on badgers is contained in a confidential 
version of this report.   
1.7 
The following surveys are recommended to inform the ecology baseline chapter of the 
Environmental Statement and full details are provided in Section 5: 
 
Extended Phase 1 habitat survey of inaccessible land at the south-west end of the Survey Site 
and new land that has been identified since the survey was carried out – an access route to 
the west of the site. 
 
A National Vegetation Classification (NVC) botanical survey of marshy grassland and 
woodland that may be affected within the Survey Site as well as any areas identified as SINCs 
within or adjacent to the site; 
 
A survey of invasive plant species within the Survey Site; 
 
Roped access survey of trees identified as having potential to support bat roosts and internal 
and external building inspections, where trees/buildings may be affected directly or indirectly 
by the Project. Inspection surveys should include surveys for barn owls. Subsequent dusk 
emergence / dawn return to roost surveys should be undertaken if roosting potential or 
evidence of roosting is found; 
 
Bat activity surveys including walked transects and automated bat detector surveys; 
 
A survey for otter and water vole along water courses within the Survey Site; 
 
Dormouse surveys in areas of woodland and scrub within the Survey Site; 
                                                      
1 Species referred to within The Natural Environment and Rural Communities Act 2006 (NERC 2006) as species of 
principal importance for the conservation of biodiversity in Wales which are listed on the Natural Resources Wales 
website. The Welsh Assembly Government must take steps to “further the conservation” of these species under Section 
42 of the NERC ACT 2006.

Introduction 
Site Description 
2.1 
The Phase 1 Habitat Survey Site (hereafter referred to as the ‘Survey Site’), in which the Project 
would be located, consists of approximately 150 ha of pastoral farmland primarily grazed by 
horses. The Survey Site is contained within the red line boundary shown in Figure 1 and is centred 
at National Grid Reference 265284, 201431. The nearest town is Felindre, which is located 
approximately 2 km to the north of the Survey Site, with Swansea approximately 5 km to the south.   
2.2 
The Survey Site is largely agriculturally improved pasture with several areas of marshy grassland, 
particularly in the north, south and north-western ends of the Survey Site. The fields are bounded 
by fences, running along the line of defunct hedgerows, and often accompanied by ditches. There 
is a block of broadleaved woodland on the eastern boundary of the Survey Site and areas around 
the marshy grassland to the west of the Survey Site, and around Felindre Gas Compressor Station 
and the two National Grid 400kV electrical substations that lie at the south-west end of the Survey 
Site.  The habitats in the surrounding landscape are similar to those within the Survey Site 
boundary – a mixture of improved and marshy grassland interspersed with occasional patches of 
woodland. 
2.3 
The Survey Site boundary is shown on Figures 1a, 1b, 2a and 2b (photographs of the Survey Site 
are found in Appendix 2).  
Description of Project 
2.4 
APL is promoting a new Power Generation Plant within Abergelli Farm.  The Power Generation 
Plant would operate as a Simple Cycle Gas Turbine (SCGT) peaking plant and would be designed 
to provide an electrical capacity of up to 299 Megawatts (MW).  It would be fuelled by natural gas, 
supplied by a new underground gas pipeline connecting the thermal generating station to the 
existing National Grid Gas (NGG) National Transmission System (NTS).   
2.5 
BSG Ecology has been appointed as the ecological consultant to undertake a preliminary ecology 
survey, which includes a desk study and Extended Phase 1 Habitat Survey. This preliminary 
ecological survey will inform the subsequent need for further, targeted surveys of protected and 
otherwise notable species and habitats. These baseline surveys will be included in an appendix to 
an ecology chapter of an Environmental Statement, which is presently intended for submission, as 
an integral part of the Development Consent Order (DCO) Application. 
Aims of Study 
2.6 
BSG Ecology was commissioned to undertake a preliminary ecological appraisal of the Survey Site 
within which the Project would be located. The main aims of this report are to: 
 
present the findings of the desk study and site surveys; 
 
assess the potential for the Survey Site to support protected or otherwise notable species; 
 
set out the legislative and/or policy protection afforded to any habitats present or any species 
potentially associated with the Survey Site; and 
 
provide recommendations for any further surveys necessary to inform a subsequent ecology 
chapter for an Environmental Statement for the site.

Methods 
Desk Study 
3.1 
Existing ecological information for the Survey Site and its surrounding area was requested from the 
South East Wales Biodiversity Records Centre (SEWBReC).  Information on European designated 
sites was requested from within 10 km with information on national statutory designated sites was 
requested covering the Survey Site and land up to 5 km from the Survey Site boundary and 
information regarding non-statutory designated sites and records of protected2 or notable species 
(particularly those identified as priority or Section 42 species and/or of local conservation 
importance or LBAP3 species) was requested covering the Survey Site and land up to 2 km from 
the Survey Site boundary. Information on locally designated Sites of Importance for Nature 
Conservation (SINC) within 2 km of the Survey Site boundary was requested from the Swansea 
Council Ecologist. In addition, on-line resources including the Multi Agency Geographic Information 
for the Countryside (MAGIC, www.magic.gov.uk) website and aerial photography of the area were 
also reviewed. 
Field Survey 
Phase 1 Habitat Survey 
3.2 
The initial field survey was undertaken by Anna Gundrey MCIEEM and Matthew Hobbs MCIEEM 
on 24 February 2014. The Project Site boundary and therefore the Survey Site was subsequently 
extended after a design review, and a second field survey was carried out by Stephanie Boocock 
MCIEEM on 14 April 2014 of the additional area. Habitats within the Survey Site, and up to at least 
50m from the Survey Site boundary, were identified and described following standard JNCC Phase 
1 Habitat Survey methodology as detailed in the Phase 1 Habitat Survey Handbook (JNCC, 2010). 
This uses a system of codes to describe different habitat types based on the dominant vegetation 
present, which are recorded by means of habitat maps and target notes. All plant names in this 
report follow The New Flora of British Isles (Stace, 2010). 
3.3 
The survey was extended to give particular consideration to the potential of the habitats present to 
support protected species or species of local conservation importance; recorded as incidental 
information as part of the target notes. 
3.4 
It should be noted that species lists derived from the target notes are not necessarily an exhaustive 
inventory of all species occurring at a site.  They are intended to illustrate the character of habitats 
present, general species richness of a particular area, and draw attention to any species that may 
be considered uncommon or unusual.   
3.5 
Weather conditions during both surveys were clear and largely dry. 
Habitat Suitability Index 
3.6 
During the February field survey a Habitat Suitability Index (HSI) assessment (Oldham et al., 2000) 
of all ponds/water bodies within a 500m radius of the Survey Site (where access was possible) was 
undertaken. In the case of this survey, a wider buffer than 250m was used because of the high 
number of ponds within 250 and 500m of the Survey Site. The additional information collected is 
useful to provide context of how ponds within or in proximity to the Survey Site may connect with 
habitat available for newts in the surrounding landscape, and also to give greater confidence to the 
assessment carried out on each pond.  
3.7 
Information on the physical features and characteristics of each pond were collected in order to 
allow a great crested newt Habitat Suitability Index (HSI) score to be derived for each pond by 
applying the scoring system developed by the Herpetological Conservation Trust (HCT, 2008). The 
suitability index is calculated by allocating scores to features associated with each pond; these

include features such as size, quality of surrounding habitat and presence of fish. These scores are 
then used to calculate the overall HSI for each pond as a number between 0 and 1, with 0 being 
the least suitable and 1 being the most suitable. The HSI score allows each pond to be placed in 
one of five categories defining its suitability for great crested newts as follows: 


Tree Assessment 
3.8 
All the trees on site were examined for their potential to support roosting bats, graded according to 
the scale provided in the Bat Conservation Trust survey guidelines (Hundt, 2012), and summarised 
in Table 1 below.  Those that were rated Category 2 and above were described and their locations 
recorded on a GPS. 
 
Table 1: Bat tree survey categories 
Category 
Description 
1* 
Tree with multiple highly suitable features for bats.  Potential to support large numbers of bats. 
1 
Tree with some definite suitable features and potential to support low numbers of bats. 
2 
No obvious potential although tree is of a size and age that elevated surveys may reveal suitable 
cracks and crevices. Or, tree supports some limited features for bats.

Limitations to Methods 
3.9 
Although records secured through the desk study and supplied by third parties provide useful 
background information for initial ecological assessment, they often comprise individual records 
supplied by members of the public or are the result of ad hoc surveys. The data trawl information 
can therefore help to inform the likelihood of a particular species being present in the area, but 
should not be relied upon to definitively determine presence or absence of individual species. 
3.10 
The first site visit was undertaken at a sub-optimal time of year (February) for a survey of this type, 
being outside the main growing season, when the greatest variety of plants is in evidence.  
However the habitats on site are readily identifiable to an experienced botanist, and those that 
require further survey work in order to confirm their quality have been identified.  In addition, a 
robust assessment of the Survey Site’s potential to support protected species could also be made. 
Therefore, it is considered that the timing of the survey in this instance is not a significant constraint 
with regard to the findings of this assessment. The second survey on the 14th April was undertaken 
at a time when most plant species are evident and was less constrained in this respect. 
3.11 
Most parts of the Survey Site were accessed and surveyed. Some of the ponds outside of the 
Survey Site could not be accessed (see Figures 2a and 2b) as they were located on private land 
and access was denied to a number of them. Ponds within 250-500m of the Survey Site, where 
accessible, were inspected to gather contextual information and enough have been inspected to 
allow suitable additional background information to be gathered.  
3.12 
The extreme south-west end of the Survey Site could not be surveyed as the land here is in a 
separate ownership and access had not been granted by land owners at the time of survey.  The 
route of the access track (that leads west to the B4489) was added to the Survey Site boundary 
after the April Phase 1 visit, so this was also not included in the survey. A recommendation has 
been made below to survey the remainder of the Survey Site as soon as access has been granted.

Results and Interpretation 
4.1 
In this section the results of the desk study and fieldwork are brought together. The implications of 
these results are then considered.  
4.2 
Figures 1a (the northern part of the site) and 1b (the southern part of the site) illustrate the results 
of the extended Phase 1 habitat survey.  Numbers on the map and in the text below can be cross-
referenced with Target Notes (TN) in Appendix 1.  Photographs of the site can be found in 
Appendix 2.  Figures 2a (the northern part of the site) and 2b (the southern part of the site) 
illustrate areas of the site that support, or have the potential to support, protected species. 
Designated Sites 
Statutory 
4.3 
There are two Special Areas of Conservation (SAC)4 designated under the EC Habitats Directive 
within 10km. One of these, Camarthen Bay and Estuaries SAC, has has been afforded multiple 
designations and is referred to under the umbrella term European Marine Site (EMS)5 which 
comprises the SAC, and is also split into two Special Protection Areas (SPA)6 and two Ramsar 
Wetlands of International Importance (Ramsar)7 the details of each designation are provided 
below. There are also four statutory protected Sites of Special Scientific Interest (SSSI) and one 
Local Nature Reserve (LNR) within 5km of the Survey Site. These are described in Table 2 below.

4 Special Areas of Conservation (SACs) are strictly protected sites designated under the EC Habitats Directive. Article 3 
of the Habitats Directive requires the establishment of a European network of important high-quality conservation sites 
that will make a significant contribution to conserving the 189 habitat types and 788 species identified in Annexes I and II 
of the Directive (as amended). 
5 The term 'European Marine Site' (EMS) (as defined by the Habitats Regulations) refers to those marine areas that area 
both Special Areas of Conservation (SACs) and Special Protection Areas (SPAs). For management advice see 
http://www.severnestuary.net/asera/docs/Regulation%2033%20Advice.pdf 
6 Special Protection Areas (SPAs) are strictly protected sites classified in accordance with Article 4 of the EC Birds 
Directive, which came into force in April 1979. They are classified for rare and vulnerable birds (as listed on Annex I of 
the Directive), and for regularly occurring migratory species. 
7 Ramsar sites are wetlands of international importance designated under the Ramsar Convention.

 Non-statutory 
4.5 
There are 23 Sites of Interest for Nature Conservation (SINC) within 2 km of the Survey Site. 
These are described in Table 3 below and their locations are shown on Figure 3.  Three SINCs lie 
partially within the Survey Site boundary. Rhyd-Y-Pandy Valley Grasslands is a large SINC, which 
includes three fields that lie within the north-east corner of the Survey Site.  Warn Garn Wen is also 
an extensive SINC which includes the marshy grassland that lies within the western boundary of 
the Survey Site.  Llety Morfil SINC is a collection of three areas of ancient woodland  with some 
areas of marshy grassland, that includes the woodland on the eastern boundary of the site and at 
the south-west end of the Survey Site.   
4.6 
There are two SINCs located adjacent to the boundary.  Rhos Fawr SINC is a block of land 
immediately to the north of the Site boundary, and Felindre Grasslands SINC lies adjacent to the 
southern tip of the proposed access route.   
4.7 
Most of the woodland within the Survey Site is also designated as Ancient Woodland (See Figure 
3).

Habitats 
4.8 
The Survey Site is roughly an ‘L’ shape, with the majority of the Survey Site running approximately 
north-south and the foot of the ‘L’ branching off to the south-west around either side of Felindre 
Gas Compressor Station and the two National Grid 400kV electrical substations. The topography 
drains the land to the south with the highest elevation in the Survey Site along the northern 
boundary (approximately 140m above ordnance datum (aod). The land slopes away to the south 
and the lowest elevation is around the Felindre Gas Compressor Station and the two National Grid 
400kV electrical substations (approximately 80m aod). The land is predominantly pastoral 
farmland, mostly agriculturally improved but with significant areas of marshy grassland.  The fields 
are grazed by horses and sheep and are largely bounded by fences with occasional trees, scrub 
and one defunct hedgerow.  There are numerous water courses on site, mostly in the form of 
ditches along field boundaries, but also four streams; one which runs along the eastern boundary 
of the Survey Site; another that runs north-west from the woodland in the eastern part of the site; a 
stream that runs through the marshy grassland to the west; and another around Felindre Gas 
Compressor Station and the two National Grid 400kV electrical substations. There is a small 
woodland on the eastern boundary of the Survey Site and the land around Felindre Gas 
Compressor Station and the two National Grid 400kV electrical substations is also largely wooded. 
There are also copses and stands of mature trees around the edges of the marshy grassland in the 
north-western part of the site, as well as along field boundaries in the northern part of the site. 
Improved grassland 
4.9 
The majority of the land on site is agriculturally improved grassland (Photo 1, 2a).  This was all 
grazed short when surveyed, and consists of abundant perennial rye-grass Lolium perenne, and 
varying quantities of common grassland herbs such as white clover Trifolium repens, common 
mouse ear Cerastium fontanum, and dandelion Taraxacum fontanum agg.   
Marshy grassland 
4.10 
There are marshy grassland fields at TN3, TN3a, TN4a, TN5, TN9a, TN13a and TN21a and a 
block of marshy grassland at the southern end of the Survey Site.  Although all fit within the same 
Phase 1 category, the habitats in these fields vary across the Survey Site.  The field at TN3 (Photo 
2) had a short, close-grazed sward when surveyed.  It has numerous tussocks of soft rush Juncus 
effusus and frequent sedge species.  These include common sedge Carex.nigra and glaucous 
sedge C. flacca.  Other species noted include creeping bent Agrostis stolonifera, a cinquefoil 
Potentilla sp., creeping buttercup Ranunculus repens and sharp-flowered and/or jointed rush 
Juncus actutiflorus / J. articulatus.  
4.11 
The field at TN5 (Photo 3) was also grazed extremely short, when surveyed, to the point where 
individual species are difficult to distinguish.  Soft rush is frequent, along with purple-moor grass 
Molinia caerulea, sheep’s fescue Festuca ovina and a sedge species (not possible to identify to 
 
Abergelli Power Project - Phase 1 survey report

18/06/2014 
species level).  Heather Calluna vulgaris and bilberry Vaccinium myrtillus plants are occasional and 
there are patches of sphagnum moss Sphagnum sp. present. 
4.12 
The fields marked TN3a, TN4a and TN13a, are wet semi-improved grassland, with marshy species 
such as lesser spearwort Ranunculus flammula, sedges, soft rush and water figwort Scrophularia 
aquatica. 
4.13 
The fields marked TN20 all have over 25% soft rush which places them in the ‘marshy grassland’ 
category, but the intervening grassland is agriculturally improved, with abundant perennial rye-
grass and frequent white clover.  The fields marked TN21 and TN22 (Photo 4) have a much higher 
cover of soft rush - approximately 75% in TN21 and 100% in TN22 and intervening species are 
more typical of wet grassland, such as creeping bent Agrostis stolonifera, creeping buttercup and 
Yorkshire fog Holcus lanatus.   
4.14 
Areas of purple-moor grass dominated vegetation, which also falls into the ‘marshy grassland’ 
category are present at TN14 (Photo 5), TN9a and TN21a where the purple moor grass is 
dominant with very occasional cross-leaved heath Erica tetralix and heather plants in evidence and 
scattered willow Salix sp. scrub. At TN9a additional species recorded include soft rush, bracken, 
common haircap moss Polytrichum commune, unidentified sphagnum moss, heather, cross-leaved 
heath and bilberry along the margins with some birch and willow regeneration in small scattered 
copses. TN21a (Photo 4a) is a large field which is superficially similar to that at TN9a but appears 
to have been managed.   Purple moor-grass is not as dominant with numerous patches of bare 
earth and young ling and cross-leaved heath plants.  In addition hare’s-tail cotton grass Eriphorum 
vaginatum, (Photo 1a) deergrass Trichophorum germanicum and lousewort Pedicularis sp. are 
common. 
Semi-improved Grassland 
4.15 
The field to the south of the woodland at TN10 appears to be slightly less agriculturally improved, 
having a lower cover of perennial rye-grass, and a wider range of grasses such as Yorkshire fog, 
crested dog’s tail Cynosurus cristatus and creeping and common bent Agrostis capillaris.  The field 
is nevertheless species-poor. There are also two species-poor semi-improved fields in the north-
east corner of the site (TN3a, TN13a, Photo 3a). 
Woodland and scrub 
4.16 
There is a block of broadleaved woodland along the eastern boundary of the Survey Site at TN10.  
The western end is on a hill, and is dry with widely-spaced trees and a grazed grassland ground 
flora including species such as Yorkshire fog, common mouse-ear and creeping buttercup.  The 
trees here are small to medium-stemmed with very little understory, and include birch Betula 
pendula, crab-apple Malus sylvestris, holly Ilex aquifolium and pedunculate oak Quercus robur.  
The hill slopes down steeply to the east, where a stream delineates a lower, wetter area of 
woodland.  Here the tree species composition is similar but the understorey is much thicker with 
bramble predominating.  On wetter areas, where the bramble thins out, carpets of opposite-leaved 
golden-saxifrage Chrysosplenium oppositifolium are present.  There are also extensive areas of 
purple moor-grass dominated ground flora with sphagnum moss species also present. 
4.17 
To the north of this woodland there is a thin strip of deciduous woodland running along the banks of 
a stream running north to south at TN42. The species composition includes occasional birch, 
willow, ash and holly. There is an understory made up largely of gorse with bramble scrub and soft 
rush grading into improved grassland to the east.   
4.18 
Another relatively extensive area of broad-leaved woodland is present at the south-west end of the 
Survey Site around Felindre Gas Compressor Station and the two National Grid 400kV electrical 
substations.  This forms a strip to the south and a more continuous block to the north of Felindre 
Gas Compressor Station and the two National Grid 400kV electrical substations. The woodland is 
generally quite wet, with alder Alnus glutinous and willow species frequent along with pedunculate 
oak, birch and holly.  The trees are growing close together and are generally small-stemmed and 
straggly.  The understorey is dense bramble and ground flora was largely absent when surveyed, 
although where the woodland opens out, for example around the margins of Felindre Gas 
Compressor Station and the two National Grid 400kV electrical substations, soft-rush dominated 
marshy grassland is present. 
 
Abergelli Power Project - Phase 1 survey report 
 
11 
18/06/2014 
4.19 
There are also patches of deciduous woodland around the edges of the marshy grassland on the 
block of land to the west of the road that runs through the Survey Site. At TN6a there is a small 
wooded spur with tree species including oak, birch, holly, hawthorn and an understorey dominated 
by brambles and including ivy Hedera helix, creeping bent, Yorkshire fog, soft rush, hard fern 
Blechnum spicant, scaly male fern Dryopteris affinis, and bracken Pteridium aquilinum.  AtTN23a 
there is a wooded copse comprised of young birch and willow with an understorey of bramble 
scrub.  The ground flora incudes nettle, lady fern Athyrium filix-femina, scaly male fern Dryopteris 
affinis and wood false brome Brachypodium sylvaticum. A continuous area of scrub is present to 
the south of the woodland at TN10 and around the pond at TN15.  These areas are quite wet and 
include willow species (including grey and goat willow Salix cinerea, S. caprea), alder and bramble.  
At TN15 the scrub merges into stands of purple moor grass that are present around the pond. 
There are also blocks of scrub to the south of Abergelli Farm, along the stream that runs along the 
eastern boundary, at the northernmost point of the Survey Site, and within the marshy grassland to 
the west.  Scattered scrub (mostly common gorse Ulex europaeus) is present along some fence 
lines, and there is a bramble scrub-covered bund at TN4.   
4.20 
Many of the trees within the Survey Site are along site boundaries and are remnant hedgerow 
stools, as described in the section below. 
Boundary features 
4.21 
All boundaries on site are fences, except one length of species-poor hedgerow running north of 
Abergelli Farm.  The fences often run along the line of defunct hedges (Photo 1).  These generally 
take the form of a degraded stone-faced hedge banks, with occasional small sections of overgrown 
hedge.  The overgrown hedges include mature standard trees, large coppice stools and clumps of 
bramble and gorse scrub.  Species present include pedunculate oak, holly, birch, ash Fraxinus 
excelsior, hazel Corylus avellana and hawthorn Crataegus monogyna. 
4.22 
Some of the fields on site have overgrown margins where the vegetation is less trampled and 
grazed along the fence line.  For example the northern boundary of the improved field to the north 
of the field marked TN3 has a ditch lined with purple moor-grass and gorse, and further east along 
this boundary fence bracken is frequent.  The western boundary of the field marked TN22 has 
purple moor-grass and heather growing along the fence.   
Water Courses 
4.23 
There are numerous small water courses within the Survey Site.  These are mostly ditches along 
field boundaries (TN22a, Photo 5a), but there is also some larger streams. The block of marshy 
grassland to the west is criss-crossed by numerous ditches, which were largely dry or with marshy 
bases when visited in April.  There is also a stream that runs through this block of land – this is 
shaded by flanking woodland, with a stone bed and shallow banks.  Another stream (Photos 8, 9 
and 6a) runs south-east through the Survey Site and splits into smaller tributaries through the 
woodland at TN10. There are also small watercourses present around the margin of Felindre Gas 
Compressor Station and the two National Grid 400kV electrical substations.  All features that were 
visited in February had flowing water, reflecting a period of prolonged wet weather preceding the 
survey. Aquatic vegetation is not apparent in any of the water courses, but marginal vegetation 
includes frequent soft rush, occasional purple moor-grass and scattered gorse and bramble.   
Water Bodies 
4.24 
There are four water bodies within the Survey Site. The pond at TN15 (Pond17 – see 4.39) is 
approximately 10m in diameter, shallow, and completely covered in an unidentified sedge species.  
It has a small tree-covered island in the centre.  The pond is ringed by small willow and alder trees.  
The surrounding vegetation is dominated by purple moor-grass with occasional heather and cross-
leaved heath plants, with densely growing small trees and scrub (grey willow, bramble and alder).  
A small pond immediately to the south is shown on OS maps.  This was not apparent amongst the 
scrub, but there were small patches of standing water (including wheel ruts) within purple moor 
grass in this area. 
4.25 
A small pond is present at TN19 (P18 – see 4.39) adjacent to an electricity pylon.  The pond is 
approximately circular and 5m in diameter.  It is in woodland and completely surrounded by small 
saplings.  There was no evidence of marginal or emergent aquatic vegetation when surveyed. 
 
Abergelli Power Project - Phase 1 survey report 
 
12 
18/06/2014 
4.26 
Two ponds are also present immediately to the west of TN30a (Ponds 11 and 12).  Pond 12 is 
approximately 10m in diameter, open and unshaded with both aquatic and marginal vegetation 
present.  It appears to be an extension of two field drains that meet at this point.  Pond 11 is a 
small wet depression containing no vegetation. 
Invasive Species 
4.27 
Japanese knotweed Fallopia japonica was noted on at least two locations on the block of land to 
the west of the road that runs through the site.  At Target Note 15a several stands of the species 
were noted on an embankment to a large raised area.  At Target Note 18a a stand of the species 
was noted on a bend in the stream. There are also several stands of this species growing on the 
edge of the road that leads into Abergelli Farm from the west. These extend just beyond the 
western site boundary and into the Survey Site. 
4.28 
Himalayan balsam Impatiens glandulifera was also noted in two areas.  Abundant seedlings of the 
species were noted in the wooded copse at Target Note 23a and on an area of deciduous 
woodland at Target Note 28a.  
Protected Species and Species of Conservation Importance 
4.29 
This section presents the protected species records provided by SEWBReC along with any 
evidence of the species, or potential for it to be present gathered during the field survey.  Where 
relevant it also evaluates the potential for the Survey Site to support Section 42 species identified 
within the desk study area.  The legislation and policy relevant to each species or species group is 
described in Appendix 6. 
Bats 
4.30 
There were 126 bat records provided by SEWBREC from the 2 km radius search area. Of these 
the majority were recorded during bat transects carried out to inform a separate unrelated 
development proposal, named ‘Felindre development site in the records’ approximately 1 km to the 
south west of the Survey Site boundary.

The bat species recorded from the desk study include brown long-eared bat Plecotus auritus, 
common pipistrelle Pipistrellus pipistrellus, Natterer’s bat Myotis nattereri, noctule Nyctalus noctula, 
and whiskered bat Myotis mystacinus. There were also unidentified Pipistrellus sp. and records 
where the bat species was not specified. 
4.32 
There are four bat roosts amongst the records provided. The closest of these is a record of 50 
unspecified bat species 1.8 km to the south-east of the Survey Site at Ynystawe, Swansea from 
1992.  The next closest is a night / feeding roost of an unspecified species 1.9 km south west of the 
Survey Site boundary in Tredegar-Fawr farm buildings from 1998. A record of a roost of 87 
whiskered bats also comes from approximately 1.9 km to the north west of the Survey Site 
boundary in Felindre, Swansea from 1993. The fourth record is a roost of 70 bats of unspecified 
species, 2.5 km to the south east of the Survey Site in Ynysforgan, Swansea from 1993.   
4.33 
There are a number of buildings associated with Abergelli Farm that fall within the Survey Site.  
These are all situated along the road that runs between the Water Treatment Works to the north of 
the Survey Site and Felindre Gas Compressor Station and the two National Grid 400kV electrical 
substations to the south.   Abergelli Farm consists of a rendered brick-built building (Photo 26) with 
a tiled pitched roof.  It has overhanging eaves with wooden soffits.  The associated stable block 
(Photo 27) is of the same construction with an ‘L’-shaped footprint.  Opportunities for roosting bats 
are fairly limited as the buildings appear to be in good condition, although gaps in the woodwork 
around the eaves would allow entry into the soffits. 
4.34 
At TN4 is a small concrete bunker (Photo 31) within an area of waste land.  It is formed of 2 m high 
brick walls with a flat roof formed from concrete sleepers.  There is an open doorway on the south 
elevation and a 30 cm x 30 cm hole at the top of the west-facing wall.  This has some potential to 
support roosting bats. 
4.35 
Immediately to the north (Photo 29) and south (Photo 28) of Abergelli Farm are large barns 
constructed of corrugated metal and asbestos.  Potential for roosting bats in these buildings is low.   
 
Abergelli Power Project - Phase 1 survey report 
 
13 
18/06/2014 
There are also two brick-built sheds with corrugated metal/asbestos pitched roofs (Photo 30) 
adjacent to the northern barn which may have greater potential to support bats, having some gaps 
in the brickwork that could allow entry in to the buildings. 
4.36 
Further south, to the south of TN25a, is a pair of houses set within plots of hard-standing and 
amenity grassland.  These are newly built and in good condition with no opportunities for roosting 
bats. 
4.37 
There are 21 trees on or within 50 m of the Survey Site that have the potential to support roosting 
bats.  Of these two have been classed as Category 1 (with definite suitable features that may 
support larger roosts of bats – see Table 1), and the remainder are Category 2 (with some limited 
roost features – see Table 1).  The locations of the trees (T1-21) are illustrated in Figures 2a and 
2b and full details of the trees are provided in Appendix 3.   
4.38 
The northern end of the Survey Site offers limited foraging and commuting potential for bats.  The 
boundaries are fences and short sections of remnant hedgerows and the fields are closely grazed.  
The block of marshy grassland, woodland and scrub to the west of the road that runs through the 
Survey Site, and the wooded stream that runs along the eastern boundary offer more potential, and 
both areas have good wooded connections with a network of hedgerows, tree-lines and marshy 
pastures off-site.  The damp wooded area around Felindre Gas Compressor Station and the two 
National Grid 400kV electrical substations at the south-west end of the Survey Site also offers 
foraging potential and connects to off-site blocks of woodland to the north and south that may be 
good habitat for bats. 
4.39 
It is concluded that the Survey Site is likely to have moderate value for bats.  There are a few 
potential roosting opportunities, and some  areas (woodland and marshy grassland) of the Survey 
Site which offer foraging opportunities, but the Survey Site as a whole does not have good linear 
commuting features and the majority of the habitats (tightly grazed improved grassland) are of low 
foraging value. 
Great crested newt  
4.40 
There were no records for great crested newts provided by SEWBREC within 2 km of the Survey 
Site. 
4.41 
Nineteen ponds have been identified within 500 m of the Survey Site boundary with the aid of aerial 
photographs and OS maps.  Of these, two were identified within the Survey Site boundary (Pond 
17 turned out to be a single pond when surveyed) and eight within 250 m of the Survey Site. An 
additional two on-site ponds (Ponds 11 and 12) were found during a reptile survey on 21 May 2014 
in the marshy grassland in the north-west of the Survey Site that had not previously been seen 
during any other survey, as well as one within 100 m of the Survey Site boundary during the first 
February Phase 1 survey (Pond 18). An HSI assessment was carried out on the seven ponds that 
were accessible within 500 m of the Survey Site boundary during the first Phase 1 survey visit.  
This included the two on-site ponds (P17 and P18); one pond within 100 m of the Survey Site 
boundary (P16); and the remainder are those ponds within 500 m of the Survey Site boundary for 
which access was possible (P07, P08, P09 and P10). Figures 2a and 2b shows which ponds were 
surveyed and which were inaccessible, either on private land or not accessible given the presence 
of horses8. 
4.42 
Table 4 below summarises the results of the HSI, and Appendix 4 gives more detailed results.

4.43 
The Survey Site lies in a part of the country where the distribution of great crested nested newts is 
patchy, with the species largely absent to the west of the Survey Site. Whilst this might reduce the 
probability that great crested newts would be present on site, it does not rule out their presence.  
There are a number of ponds in and around the Survey Site, and suitable habitat for newts in their 
terrestrial phase, including old hedge banks, marshy grassland and woodland within the Survey 
Site.  Those ponds surveyed, whilst most did not have a ‘good’ or ‘excellent’ HSI score, do have 
potential to provide breeding habitat for great crested newts and the possible presence of the 
species on site should be considered further. In addition the cluster of inaccessible ponds within 
the grounds of the water treatment works (to the north-west of the Survey Site) are likely to be of 
similar ‘good’ quality as Pond 08 (which was visible through the gate). 
 
Dormouse 
4.44 
SEWBReC did not provide any records of dormouse Muscardinus avellanarius. The woodland 
areas on the eastern boundary, at the south-west end and within the marshy grassland in the 
north-west of the Survey Site do not provide optimum dormouse habitat although they are suitable 
for the species. Most of the woodland consists of relatively immature trees with little hazel 
understorey, limited foraging opportunities for this species and a lack of connectivity in the canopy. 
However, these areas of woodland have good connections to a complex of woodland and thick 
hedgerows to the west, south and east, and consequently could potentially form part of a wider 
network of dormouse-supporting habitat. There are a number of recent examples of dormouse 
occurring in sub-optimal habitat, such as coniferous plantation and species-poor hedges, in south 
and mid-Wales and their presence should not be ruled out if the habitat is sub-optimal but still has 
clear potential to support the species, as in this case. 
4.45 
Figures 2a and 2b illustrate which areas of the Survey Site have the highest potential to support 
dormouse. 
Otter 
4.46 
There are a number of water courses on site, most of which are ditches, but also a small stream 
running from north-west to south-east along the centre and eastern flank of the Survey Site and 
through the woodland in the centre of the Survey Site.  SEWBReC provided 32 records of otter 
within the 2 km search radius, all recorded between 1991 and 2013. The closest record to the 
Survey Site is 0.5 km to the south west from the River Llan.  At its closest point the River Llan is 
approximately 0.3 km south of the southern Survey Site boundary, and it links to the Survey Site 
via the stream running through the woodland in the centre of the Survey Site.  None of the water 
courses on site are likely to provide good foraging opportunities because of their size, but they may 
offer lying up sites for otter, and it is possible that individuals might use the water courses to 
commute along from time to time. 
Water Vole 
4.47 
No evidence of water voles was noted along the water courses on site when surveyed in February 
and April, although February is a time of low activity for the species, when field signs may not be 
evident.  The water courses that were visited in February all had flowing water in them when 
 
Abergelli Power Project - Phase 1 survey report 
 
15 
18/06/2014 
surveyed, following a prolonged period of extremely wet weather during the winter.  It is likely that 
many of these are usually dry or hold only a small amount of water and this was confirmed during 
the April survey. As such they do not provide good habitat for water voles. The stream that runs 
along the eastern boundary of the site; however, does provide suitable habitat for water vole, 
particularly at TN41-43. At TN43, a number of vole tunnels and holes were seen along the western 
side of the bank in long tussocks of grass, although it was not possible to ascertain which species 
had made them.   
4.48 
Water voles have been present in the vicinity: SEWBReC provided three records of water vole from 
the River Llan approximately 1.9 km from the Survey Site boundary, all from 1996.  This River is 
hydrologically linked to the Survey Site (see otter section above), so it is possible, if any of the 
water courses retain water, particularly those linked to the River Llan, that water voles could be 
present on site.  
Reptiles 
4.49 
There were 12 records of reptiles provided by SEWBReC, between 1998 and 2010. These 
included records of all the common reptile species: adder Vipera berus, grass snake Natrix natrix, 
common lizard Zootoca vivipara, and slow worm Anguis fragilis. The closest record is of a common 
lizard, approximately 0.8 km to the west of the Survey Site boundary. Most records are from the 
south-west side of tinplate workings near to Bryn Whilach Farm, approximately 1 km to the 
southwest of the Survey Site boundary. 
4.50 
There are several areas of the Survey Site that provide suitable habitat for common reptile species 
(see Figures 2a and 2b).  This includes areas of marshy grassland to the south of the Survey Site, 
mounds of wood to the south of the woodland at TN10 (Photo 11), scrubby woodland fringes 
(Photo 12) and overgrown field margins either along remnant hedge banks or ditch banks. In 
addition a common lizard was seen during the April Phase 1 survey in the marshy grassland area 
in the north-west of the site and this area is particularly suitable for reptiles providing high quality 
habitat for foraging, sheltering and basking. 
Badger 
4.51 
Information on badgers is provided in a confidential version of this report. 
Birds 
4.52 
During the Phase 1 survey a number of common woodland and farmland bird species were 
recorded and these are listed in Appendix 5. The trees and woodland on site may provide nesting 
habitat for a range of common bird species.  The marshy grassland on site could also provide 
nesting habitat for ground-nesting bird species. The Survey Site does not appear to be of particular 
importance for wintering birds with no notable aggregations of common species or any rarer 
species recorded during the walkover survey, except for a red kite Milvus milvus seen in flight over 
the Survey Site (see below) in both February and April.  
4.53 
SEWBReC provided a number of records of ground nesting birds in the search area.  These 
included records for Eurasian curlew Numenius arquata, northern lapwing Vanellus vanellus and 
skylark Alauda arvensis. The closest of these records are located at the tinplate workings site near 
to Bryn Whilach Farm, approximately 1 km to the southwest of the Survey Site boundary.  There 
was one record of curlew, located at the Lliw reservoir, 1 km north of the Survey Site boundary.  
 
Schedule 1 Birds 
4.54 
SEWBReC provided 21 records of barn owl Tyto alba. The closest of these records is 0.7 km to the 
west of the Survey Site boundary from 1997, with the nearest breeding record 3 km to the south 
west near Penllergaer Woods in 2000.  It is possible that some of the farm buildings within the 
Survey Site may support breeding barn owl, although no trees were found that appear, from a 
ground level inspection, to have sufficiently large cavities to support nesting barn owls. The marshy 
fields at the southern end of the Survey Site, although probably sub-optimal, could provide habitat 
for field vole Microtus agrestis (a preferred prey species) given the thick, tussocky structure of 
some parts of the sward. The marshy grassland in the north-west of the Survey Site provides 
 
Abergelli Power Project - Phase 1 survey report 
 
16 
18/06/2014 
optimal foraging habitat for barn owls due to its extensive areas of tussocky grassland that may 
support breeding field voles Microtus agrestis, their preferred prey species. 
4.55 
A red kite was noted circling above the field at TN3 and also over Abergelli Farm.  Red kites 
generally breed in valley woodlands of which there is extensive habitat to 2-3 km to the east and 
west of the Survey Site.  It is considered likely that the Survey Site is part of a much wider area of 
potential foraging habitat for the species. SEWBReC provided 54 records for red kite between 1999 
and 2013. 
Terrestrial Invertebrates 
4.1 
SEWBReC provided 40 records of Section 42 terrestrial invertebrate species. The species 
recorded are marsh fritillary, dingy skipper Erynnis tages, narrow-bordered bee hawk-moth 
Hemaris tityus, and small pearl-bordered fritillary Boloria selene. Twenty-nine of the records are of 
marsh fritillary; the closest of these is located approximately 0.7 km west of the Survey Site 
boundary in 2009. This location also contains the closest of the four dingy skipper records, as well 
as the closest of the five small pearl-bordered fritillary records and the only narrow-bordered bee 
hawk-moth record. 
4.2 
The marshy grassland to the west provides suitable habitat for marsh fritillaries, although the food 
plant devil’s-bit scabious Succisa pratensis was not noted in any quantity during the April survey.  
Of the other Section 42 species recorded from the desk study, suitable habitat is present for 
narrow-bordered bee hawk-moth Hemaris tityus, which largely relies on devil’s bit scabious, like 
marsh fritillary. For dingy skipper, there are few areas of bare ground, where this species prefers to 
bask and no areas where its usual food plant, bird’s foot trefoil Lotus corniculatus, is found in any 
quantity. Small pearl-bordered fritillary is reliant on violets (Viola spp.) as its foodplant and violets 
have not been recorded during either Phase 1 survey (the April survey was well timed to record 
them in flower).  It is unlikely that either of these latter two species is present.  
4.3 
Other habitats that may be suitable for diverse assemblages of terrestrial invertebrates include the 
areas of broad-leaved ancient woodland at Target Note 10, for example, which represents a fairly 
extensive area of semi-natural habitat that may be important for terrestrial invertebrates, 
particularly Lepidoptera (notably moths) and beetles (Coleoptera); which are both strongly 
represented in wooded habitats.   
Aquatic Invertebrates 
4.4 
No records of Section 42 aquatic invertebrate species were provided by SEWBReC, and it is 
unlikely that any of the ponds on or close to the site support unusual or diverse assemblages of 
aquatic invertebrates.

Recommendations 
5.1 
For the purposes of this report it has been assumed at this stage that direct impacts will potentially 
occur across the Survey Site, and that indirect impacts will need to be considered beyond this, 
within the ‘zone of influence’ that will vary dependent on the receptor (habitat, protected species, 
designated site) concerned.  The recommendations presented below are based on preliminary 
assumptions of the potential impacts and the corresponding requirement to confirm presence / 
absence, and where present the distribution and abundance of protected and otherwise notable 
species or habitats that may occur within the Survey Site and a zone of influence surrounding it. 
Statutory Designated Sites  
5.2 
Nant Y Crimp SSSI, Penplas Grasslands SSSI and Cadle Heath LNR are located within 5 km of the 
Survey Site boundary. These sites are designated for their habitat interest and as all are over 2 km 
from the Survey Site, direct impacts resulting from the development are considered unlikely.  Nant 
Y Crimp SSSI also has a colony of marsh fritillary butterflies. The larval food plant (devil’s-bit 
scabious) for this species was found in small patches in the western area of marshy grassland 
during the Phase 1 survey, so this species may be present.  However this assessment will need to 
be reviewed once a botanical survey (see below) of the western block of marshy grassland has 
been carried out.  
 
Habitat Regulations Assessment 
5.3 
Consultation with the Planning Authority, Natural Resources Wales and PINS will determine the 
requirement for a screening exercise (under the Habitat Regulations) that considers the proximity 
of potentially sensitive ecological receptors (notably European protected sites, but potentially 
extended to SSSIs) within a search area that may extend to or beyond a 5 km radius of the Survey 
Site (for example, Camarthen Bay and Estuary SAC, Crymlyn Bog SAC, SPA and Ramsar, and 
Burry Inlet SPA and Ramsar all lie within 10 km of the Survey Site), and whether these could be 
affected by CO, NOX and NO2 emissions as well as nitrogen and acid deposition. 
5.4 
The requirement for further surveys or desk based investigation will be determined following review 
of the scoping opinion (and consultation) on this matter. 
Non-statutory Designated Sites  
5.5 
Three SINCs lie partially within the site boundary and could therefore be directly affected by the 
proposed development.  Indirect impacts could also potentially occur on those sites lying adjacent 
or close to the boundary.   
5.6 
The woodland on site that falls within Llety-Morfil SINC and the southern part of Waun Garn Wen 
SINC is also designated as Ancient Woodland and as such is irreplaceable.  Direct impacts on this 
resource may therefore also occur as a result of the proposals. 
Habitats 
5.7 
The marshy grasslands within the Survey Site potentially qualify as a Section 42 habitat ‘purple 
moor-grass and rush pastures’.  The area to the west of Abergelli Farm is also a SINC.  These 
habitats require a NVC botanical survey at an appropriate time of year (June/July) to establish their 
ecological value and inform the level of mitigation required to compensate if they are to be lost or 
modified as a consequence of the Project. The marshy grassland in the north-west of the site is 
potentially of high ecological value, and this needs to be confirmed through botanical and other 
Phase 2 survey work.  The semi-improved grasslands in the north-east corner of the site, whilst not 
having obvious high botanical value, are included within a larger SINC.  As such it is recommended 
that a botanical survey is carried out on these areas to establish their value in the wider context of 
the SINC, and therefore the likely mitigation that would be required for their loss. 
5.8 
‘Lowland mixed deciduous woodland’ is also a Section 42 habitat. The woodland on site all falls 
into this category and the majority of the resource also falls within a SINC and is designated as 
 
Abergelli Power Project - Phase 1 survey report 
 
18 
18/06/2014 
Ancient Woodland.  A botanical survey of these areas in spring/early summer when the ground 
flora is in evidence would allow an evaluation of their ecological value to be made.  
5.9 
There are no other habitats on site of high intrinsic ecological value.  The improved grassland 
habitat is common and widespread in south Wales and of minimal ecological value. In addition, all 
(bar one species poor example) of the hedgerows on the Survey Site are defunct. 
Invasive species 
5.10 
Japanese knotweed and Himalayan balsam have both been noted on the Survey Site.  It is 
recommended that a walkover survey of the Survey Site is carried out once access is available to 
all areas, including the proposed access route to map all locations where these species are 
growing.  This should be done within the period June - July when both species are most in 
evidence.  
5.11 
If work is to take place in any areas where these species are present, a Management Plan will 
need to be drawn up detailing the methods that will be used to remove these species under 
controlled conditions as detailed by the Environment Agency (The Knotweed Code of Practice 
2003 and guidance on Environment Agency website). 
Protected Species and Species of Conservation Importance 
Bats 
Trees and Buildings 
5.12 
Twenty one trees within the Survey Site have been identified as having potential to support 
roosting bats.  If these trees are to be removed or modified, it is recommended that a roped-access 
tree survey is carried out in order to confirm whether any of the features initially identified support 
roosting bats or have the potential to do so.  Where the potential for bats to roost in the tree is 
confirmed then emergence/re-entry (at dusk and/or dawn) survey may need to be carried out to 
confirm the likely use of the tree by roosting bats, and the status of any roost present. If a bat roost 
is confirmed, either through emergence/re-entry survey or through roped-access survey a 
European Protected Species (EPS) Licence is likely to be required before the tree can be felled.  
5.13 
It is recommended that all buildings to be directly or indirectly affected by the Project (if any) should 
be inspected for signs of roosting bats and features with the potential to support roosting bats, 
where access allows. 
5.14 
If signs of roosting bats or features with the potential to be used by roosting bats are identified 
during these inspection surveys, further survey in the form of dusk emergence/ dawn re-entry 
surveys may be required. The level of survey effort required will depend on the potential that the 
building or tree has been assigned in these initial inspection surveys. These further surveys (if 
required) should be undertaken in accordance with current best practice guidance (Hundt, 2012) at 
a time of year when breeding roosts may be present (i.e. between mid-May and mid-August). 
Activity Survey 
5.15 
The areas of marshy grassland, woodland and streams on site potentially provide good foraging 
habitat for bats.  It is recommended that bat activity surveys are carried out in order to inform an 
assessment of the Survey Site’s value for bats and to guide the evolution of the Project and 
mitigation accordingly.  Following the guidance provided in Hundt (2012), this would involve two 
walked transect routes (given the size of the Survey Site) carried out monthly between April and 
October, as specified in the guidelines.  An automated survey using four static bat detectors (two 
per transect route) recording for at least three nights would also be carried out. Rather than 
deploying detectors at four locations every month, it is recommended that surveys are carried out 
at four locations for three months and another four locations for the other four months so that half 
the locations would be surveyed in April, June, August and October and the other four in May, July 
and September. This would increase the spatial coverage of the Survey Site but ensure that 
sampling was undertaken at each location in spring, summer and autumn to allow a robust 
seasonal comparison to be made.  
 
Abergelli Power Project - Phase 1 survey report 
 
19 
18/06/2014 
 
Great Crested Newt 
5.16 
The presence of four ponds on site with several more in the vicinity of the Survey Site, and the 
occurrence of suitable terrestrial habitat on site indicate that great crested newts could potentially 
be using the Survey Site. This should be established through further targeted survey work. 
5.17 
Section 5.4 of the GCN Mitigation Guidelines (English Nature, 2001) recommends that: 
“For a common situation, where a plot of land containing a pond is proposed for development, the 
pond itself should be surveyed, and other ponds up to 500m away should also be checked, if it is 
thought likely that great crested newt populations centred on these ponds would be affected by 
changes to the plot.” 
5.18 
Natural England guidance(2001) is further developed in the GCN Method Statement which states 
that:  
‘The decision on whether to survey depends primarily on how likely it is that the development would 
affect newts using those ponds. For developments resulting in permanent or temporary habitat loss 
at distances over 250m from the nearest pond, carefully consider whether a survey is 
appropriate.…. normally appropriate only when all of the following conditions are met: 
1. 
maps, aerial photos, walk-over surveys or other data indicate that the pond(s) has potential to 
support a large great crested newt population,  
2. 
the footprint contains particularly favourable habitat, especially if it constitutes the majority available 
locally,  
3. 
the development would have a substantial negative effect on that habitat, and 
4. 
there is an absence of dispersal barriers.’ 
5.19 
The second piece of guidance, which supersedes the first, specifies that all four conditions should 
be met for surveys to be required of ponds beyond 250m of the Survey Site boundary.  In this case, 
condition 1. is not met as there is no indication from desk study data or the HSI assessment that 
any of the ponds is likely to support a large population of GCN or that they provide particularly 
suitable habitat (condition 2.) with no ponds within 250m of the Survey Site recording better than an 
‘average’ score on the HSI assessment.  
5.20 
As a consequence, it is recommended that all ponds within 250m (not 250-500m) would need to be 
further surveyed. This would initially involve four surveys within the period mid-March to mid-June 
to establish presence/absence (with at least two surveys during mid-April to mid-May), with an 
additional two surveys (six in total) required to estimate population size if newts are found during 
the first four surveys.   
 
Dormouse 
5.21 
If the woodland on the Survey Site is to be removed, damaged or significantly modified, it is 
recommended that dormouse surveys are carried out with the aim of establishing whether the 
species is present on site, and therefore whether a EPS Licence will be required before woodland 
can be cleared or significantly modified. It is recommended undertaking a dormouse survey, 
following methods based on those prescribed in best practice guidance (Bright et al. 2006). The 
surveys will involve the use of dormouse boxes in areas of woodland and nest tubes in cluttered 
environments where boxes cannot be used. The survey will be designed to detect the presence or 
absence of dormice rather than to provide an abundance estimate or monitor a population of the 
species. Surveys would be carried out monthly during April-November. 
 
Otter and Water Vole 
5.22 
Otter usage of the Survey Site is likely to be occasional although there are suitable resting/lying up 
places present along the eastern stream corridor within the Survey Site.  Mitigation measures to 
avoid potential killing or injury to individuals during the construction and decommissioning phases 
should be considered, for example covering open workings overnight.   
 
Abergelli Power Project - Phase 1 survey report 
 
20 
18/06/2014 
5.23 
A survey for water voles along the banks of the water courses on site should be carried out as a 
precautionary measure to establish whether the species is likely to be present on site and to design 
mitigation accordingly.  This would involve one visit and should be carried out ideally in spring 
when field signs are likely to be most in evidence but the vegetation has not grown up to obscure 
them. It will also be possible to carry out additional checks for signs of otter at the same time as the 
water vole survey, for completeness. The survey would be carried out in accordance with best 
practice guidelines (Chanin (2003) and Strachan et al., (2011), respectively). 
 
Reptiles 
5.24 
A reptile survey should be carried out on the Survey Site to establish the presence/absence of 
reptiles, the species present and the approximate population size. The survey will be conducted 
using artificial refuges (e.g. roofing felt and tin) to aid in the detection of reptiles and assessment of 
their distribution and abundance, following good practice guidance, including that set out in the 
Herpetofauna Worker’s Manual (Gent & Gibson, 2003) and Reptile Survey Guidance (Froglife, 
1999). This requires a minimum of seven visits conducted at an appropriate time of year (either 
spring/early summer and/or late summer/early autumn) during suitable weather conditions. 
 
Badger 
5.25 
 Information on badgers is provided in a confidential version of this report. 
 
Breeding Birds 
5.26 
Breeding bird surveys of the Survey Site should be carried out with the aim of establishing the 
ecological value of the breeding bird population and to inform mitigation measures. Farmland birds 
(occurring both within the Survey Site and a buffer of up to 50m) would be the main target of the 
survey. Territory mapping surveys based on the British Trust for Ornithology’s Common Bird 
Census (CBC) methodology will be undertaken.  These would be conducted on three occasions 
during the breeding season.  It is recommended that an initial visit is carried out in mid-April, 
followed by additional visits in May and June. 
5.27 
The Phase 1 survey was partly conducted in winter with an experienced ornithologist (Matt Hobbs) 
part of the survey team. As there was no evidence of notable aggregations of common species or 
habitat that may support rarer species it is considered that there is no justification for carrying out 
targeted wintering bird surveys.  
Barn owls 
5.28 
It is recommended that all buildings and mature trees on site to be directly or indirectly affected by 
the Project (if any) should be inspected for signs of roosting or nesting. Signs to be searched for 
include: nest debris, barn owl pellets, white splashes from barn owl droppings and live or dead barn 
owls themselves (Barn Owl Trust, 2012). Barn owl roost inspections can be conducted all year 
round. 
Terrestrial Invertebrates 
5.29 
The block of marshy grassland to the west, provides potential habitat for marsh fritillary butterflies 
due to the presence of their food plant, devil’s-bit scabious. As such a survey of adults during late 
May/June and also the larval webs should be carried out in mid-August to mid-September. Both 
surveys would involve walking transects over the marshy grassland, the former noting adult marsh 
fritillary butterflies and the latter checking all patches of the food plant for larval webs and larvae 
and following standard methods9. 
5.30 
The woodland at Target Note 10, for example represents a fairly extensive area of semi-natural 
habitat that may be important for terrestrial invertebrates; which are both strongly represented in 
wooded habitats.  If the woodland at TN10 is to be affected by the Project it is proposed that further 
survey will be appropriate that targets both Lepidoptera (notably moths) and beetles (Coleoptera).

A moth survey should also be undertaken of the marshy grassland area in the north-west of the 
site. 
5.31 
Survey of Lepidoptera should involve two night-time moth surveys to be undertaken in late spring 
and mid-summer. Trapping using Skinner or Robinson moth traps fitted with mercury vapour bulbs 
is most suitable in terms of attracting an extensive and variable moth fauna. Lights should be 
switched on at dusk and remain lit until dawn the following day.  The traps should be checked 
periodically throughout the night to log any new arrivals.  Any species hard to identify from external 
markings alone, and those requiring further confirmation, should be retained and dissected if 
necessary to ascertain their identity with the use of a stereoscopic microscope. 
5.32 
For beetles, a method should be developed that follows Natural England (ISIS) protocol (Drake et 
al., 2007) to sample beetle assemblages directed at woodland habitats, via hand searches, sweep 
netting and pitfall trapping. To align with the Lepidoptera surveys, this can be undertaken in late 
spring/early summer and mid/late summer/early autumn. Subsequent laboratory identification will 
be required for many of the specimens collected. 
5.33 
Analysis of the results should use the ISIS protocol to determine whether any broad or specialist 
assemblage types of Lepidoptera and / or Coleoptera are present. Consideration should also be 
given to any rare, scarce or nationally threatened species present, including Section 42 species.  
Aquatic Invertebrates 
5.34 
On the assumption that watercourses will be affected by the Project, it may be appropriate to 
undertake an assessment of water quality, compliant with the Water Framework Directive (WFD). A 
main aim of the WFD is to prevent deterioration in the status of aquatic ecosystems, protect them 
and improve the ecological condition of waters. The requirement for such an assessment would be 
driven in consultation with Natural Resources Wales. Should such an assessment be required it 
may be appropriate to assess the ecological quality and surface water chemistry of watercourses to 
be affected. 
5.35 
To determine ecological quality kick-sampling for aquatic invertebrates should be undertaken at 
selected locations along the ditch / stream, and the Biological Monitoring Working Party (BMWP) 
score applied to inform an assessment of water quality and species present. This survey is best 
undertaken in spring or autumn in swift flowing waters, or in summer in stationary ditches or those 
with a slow flow. All macro-invertebrates should be identified to species level in order to determine 
the presence of any scarce or nationally notable species. 
5.36 
To determine water chemistry status a single water sample should be extracted at three locations; 
within the Survey Site and upstream and downstream of this. Samples should be dispatched to a 
UKAS accredited laboratory for subsequent analysis, to cover a standard range of parameters 
including: Biological Dissolved Oxygen, Total Suspended Solids, nutrient composition (e.g. nitrite 
as nitrogen, total oxidised nitrogen, total ammoniacal nitrogen, total phosphorus), hardness, 
calcium, alkalinity, conductivity and pH. 
5.37 
The condition of the watercourse can subsequently be analysed by recording and comparing the 
aggregated number of taxa, and average score per taxon from the sampling points along the 
watercourse within, upstream and downstream from the Survey Site. The statistical model (RICT) 
developed for WFD classification would be used to calculate the Ecological Quality Ratio (EQR) 
that compares observed with expected results for a watercourse of the same type. The EQR is 
then used to identify the Biological Status of the watercourse which is separated into five bands 
(Bad to High) required by the WFD. 
5.38 
It may also be necessary to undertake invertebrate surveys of any ponds that are likely to be 
affected by the development proposals. These are likely to involve surveys of aquatic beetles in 
June and August 
Un-surveyed Land 
5.39 
There are a number of small parcels of land that have not yet been surveyed in the southern part of 
the site. These are indicated on Figure 1b and will be surveyed once access has been arranged. 
The Phase 1 report will be updated once these surveys are complete.

Appendix 1: Target Notes 
February Survey 
1. A spring running into a wet ditch.  The ditch has a muddy base with sweet-grass Glyceria sp. and soft rush 
the dominant plant species.  Frog spawn was present. 
2. A wet ditch fenced on either side.  The ditch meets a spring which runs into it flowing southwards.  The 
ditch has steeply sloping grassy banks, is open and unshaded with great willow herb Epilobium hirstum and 
soft rush present.  A newly planted hedge runs along the south side – gapping up a defunct hedge.  Also, 
occasional large coppices of holly were recorded. 
3. Marshy grassland with abundant soft rush.   The sward is grazed very short by horses. Frequent patches 
of sedge species were recorded including common sedge and glaucous sedge.  Other species noted include 
sharp-flowered rush and/or jointed rush (difficult to separate in winter and when closely grazed), cinquefoil 
species, daisy and creeping bent.   
4. A small concrete bunker with wasteland area.  The concrete bunker is formed of 2m high brick walls with a 
flat roof formed from concrete sleepers.  There is an open doorway on the south elevation and a 30cm x 
30cm hole at the top of the west-facing wall.  No evidence of bats was recorded. The surrounding land is 
compacted course aggregate which is becoming colonised with common grassland species.  There is an 
earth bund around the south-east and north-east boundary, topped with dense bramble and gorse scrub. 
5. An area of marshy grassland which is very closely grazed.  Occasional heather and bilberry plants and 
patches of sphagnum moss were recorded. Purple moor grass is frequent and forms dominant tussocks at 
the north end of the field.  Other species include sheep’s fescue and a sedge species.   
6. An area of marshy grassland dominated by soft rush.  The field was not entered as it is outside the 
ownership boundary, but inspection from the roadside suggests that rushes are interspersed with 
agriculturally improved grassland. 
7. A wet ditch running through the middle of the field containing fast flowing water with orange discolouration. 
The ditch is overgrown with bramble and joins another ditch on its eastern boundary, which is lined with 
purple moor grass, greater willowherb, and soft rush.  The surrounding field is agriculturally improved with 
patches of soft rush. 
8. A derelict stone farmhouse with only the bottom halves of walls still present.  Patches of rubble and 
overgrown vegetation are present, which may provide good habitat for reptiles. 
9. A stream lined with trees, which is fast-flowing with a stony substrate. 
10. An area of broadleaved woodland.  The western end is on a hill, which slopes steeply down to the east.  
This end (delineated by a stream running north-south) is dry with widely spaced trees and a grazed 
grassland ground flora (Yorkshire fog, common mouse-ear, and creeping buttercup were the most prominent 
species) and very little understorey was noted.  The eastern end is much wetter, with carpets of opposite-
leaved golden-saxifrage, extensive areas of purple moor-grass dominated ground flora with some sphagnum 
moss species.  The understorey is thicker here and is predominantly bramble.   Tree species include birch, 
crab-apple, holly and pedunculate oak.  Most specimens are small-medium in size. 
11 and 12. These Target Notes relate to evidence of badger activity and are provided in a confidential 
version of this report. They are also omitted from Figures. 
13. A ditch along a line of small-medium trees (beech, holly, pedunculate oak) and a fence. Bilberry is 
growing along the fence. 
14. A marshy grassland field with abundant soft rush tussocks.  The area indicated by this target note is 
dominated by purple moor-grass with occasional cross-leaved heath and scattered small trees/scrub.  
15. A shallow pond (less than 10cm deep), approximately 10m in diameter, completely covered in a sedge 
species (only dead leaves were evident so identification was not possible) and with a small tree-covered 
island in the centre.  The pond is ringed by small trees.  The surrounding vegetation includes purple moor-
grass with occasional heather and cross-leaved heath and densely growing small trees and scrub (willow 
species, bramble and alder.  A small pond immediately to the south is shown on OS maps.  This consisted of 
small patches of standing water (including wheel ruts) within marshy (rushes, purple moor grass) vegetation. 
16.  A strip of land around the gas station, which is higher than the surrounding land.  There is a gravel strip 
immediately surrounding the boundary fence then a steep slope covered in soft-rush dominated grassland.  
At the base of the slope is a mosaic of marshy rush-dominated grassland with dense bramble scrub and wet

woodland.  The woodland consists of closely spaced, small and straggly trees composed largely of holly, 
pedunculate oak, birch, willow and alder.     
17. A patch of marshy grassland almost totally dominated by soft rush.  Small patch of bulrush were found 
towards centre of field.  The field is surrounded by encroaching scrub and straggly woodland. 
18.  An area of wet woodland with dense bramble understorey.  The species present and structure are as for 
Target Note 16.  Wet underfoot. 
19. A small pond within woodland fed by a stream.  No emergent/marginal vegetation was in evidence and 
the pond is surrounded by small saplings. 
20. Marshy grassland fields consisting of more than 25% soft rush.  The intervening grassland is 
agriculturally improved, including perennial rye-grass Lolium perenne, common mouse-ear and white clover 
Trifolium repens.   
21. An area of marshy grassland with approximately 75% soft rush cover. The intervening grassland is semi-
improved.

Appendix 6: Summaries of Relevant Legislation, Policy and Other 
Instruments 
National Planning Policy  
6.2 
Technical Advice Note (TAN) 5 provides Welsh Assembly Government advice about how the land 
use planning system in Wales should contribute to protecting and enhancing biodiversity and 
geological conservation.   
6.3 
It follows that the TAN provides guidance to local planning authorities on: the key principles of 
positive planning for nature conservation; nature conservation and Local Development Plans; 
nature conservation in development management procedures; development affecting protected 
internationally and nationally designated sites and habitats; and, development affecting protected 
and priority habitats and species. 
6.4 
Planning considerations with regard to habitats and species are of greatest relevance to the 
Abergelli Farm proposal.  For a full account, the TAN should be referred to, but some of the key 
principles are summarised as follows: 
i. 
When dealing with cases where a European protected species of plant or animal may be affected, 
a local planning authority needs to have regard to the requirements of the Habitats Directive in the 
exercise of its functions. 
ii. 
The TAN refers to the Wildlife and Countryside Act 1981 (as amended), which makes it an offence 
(with certain limited exceptions and in the absence of a licence) to intentionally to kill, injure or take 
any wild bird, or to damage, take or destroy the nest of any wild bird whilst that nest is being built or 
in use, or to take or destroy its eggs.  Further offences apply to species listed under Schedule 1 of 
the Act. 
iii. 
The above Act also affords protection to wild animals of the species listed in Schedule 5, and to 
wild plants listed in Schedule 8, most of which are not European protected species.  Actions that 
are likely to result in an offence are identified; 
iv. 
With regard to badger, Meles meles, the TAN refers to the provisions of the Protection of Badgers 
Act, 1992; 
v. 
The TAN makes reference to Sections 40 and 42 of the Natural Environment and Rural 
Communities Act 2006, which place a duty on the Welsh Assembly Government to have regard to 
the purpose of conserving biodiversity (see Section 1.10 of this report); 
vi. 
In section 2.4 it is noted that when deciding planning applications that may affect nature 
conservation, local planning authorities should protect wildlife and natural features in the wider 
environment, with appropriate weight attached to priority habitats and species in Biodiversity Action 
Plans; 
vii. 
When determining planning applications, planning authorities should ensure that all material 
considerations are taken into account, that decisions are informed by adequate information about 
the potential effects of development on nature conservation, and that the range and population of 
protected species is sustained; 
viii. 
Planning applications should demonstrate a step-wise approach to avoid harm to nature 
conservation, minimise unavoidable harm by mitigation measures, offset residual harm by 
compensation measures and look for new opportunities to enhance nature conservation.

The Environment Departments of all four governments in the UK work together through the Four 
Countries Biodiversity Group.  Together they have agreed, and Ministers have signed, a framework 
of priorities for UK-level work for the Convention on Biological Diversity.  Published on 17 July 
2012, the 'UK Post-2010 Biodiversity Framework' covers the period from 2011 to 2020.

6.6 
Most work which was previously carried out under the UK Biodiversity Action Plan (UK BAP) is now 
focussed in the four countries of the UK through the new framework.  The UK BAP partnership no 
longer operates but includes detailed Action Plans for priority habitats and species, which are still in 
use and of relevance. The list of priority habitats and species included within the UK BAP list is 
equivalent to the list of Section 42 habitats and species.  
6.7 
The UK BAP is supported by a series of Local Biodiversity Action Plans (LBAPs), usually set up on 
a local authority administrative boundary basis. Each LBAP identifies those habitats and species 
considered to be most important in that area (usually referred to as priority habitats and species). 
Commonly, an LBAP will identify a number of habitats and species for which “action plans” have 
been prepared. The Swansea LBAP is was created in 2005 but is unavailable as it is under review. 
Wildlife Legislation 
6.8 
Legislation of most relevance to this assessment includes the following: 
Natural Environment and Rural Communities (NERC) Act 2006  
6.9 
Section 40 of the Natural Environment and Rural Community Act (NERC) 2006 sets out the duty 
which public authorities have to conserve biodiversity. Section 40 States that: “every public 
authority must, in exercising its functions, have regard, so far as is consistent with the proper 
exercise of those functions, to the purpose of conserving biodiversity”. The term Public Authority 
includes local authorities and local planning authorities. 
6.10 
Paragraph 40(3) goes on to state that “conserving biodiversity includes, in relation to a living 
organism or type of habitat, restoring or enhancing a population or habitat”. 
6.11 
Paragraph 42(1) states that “the Secretary of State must, as respects Wales, publish a list of the 
living organisms and types of habitat which in the Secretary of State’s opinion are of principal 
importance for the purpose of conserving biodiversity”. This replaces a similar reference to the list 
that was found in Section 74 of the Countryside and Rights of Way Act 2000 (the CRoW Act). 
The Wildlife and Countryside Act 1981 (as amended by the Countryside and Rights of Way 
Act 2000) 
Protection afforded to birds 
6.12 
Section 1 of the Wildlife and Countryside Act 1981 (WCA) prohibits the intentional killing, injuring or 
taking of any wild bird and the taking, damaging or destroying of the nest (whilst being built or in 
use) or eggs.  Section 1 also prohibits disturbing any bird listed on Schedule 1 of the Act whilst at 
or near the nest and prohibits disturbing the dependent young of such birds. 
Protection afforded to other animals 
6.13 
Species listed on Schedule 5 that may be of relevance to this site include GCNs, bats, otter, water 
vole and all species of reptiles.  The places of shelter used by otter and water vole are protected, 
but reptiles are protected from killing and injury only. 
Protection afforded to Sites of Special Scientific Interest (SSSIs) 
6.14 
Section 28 allows for the creation of SSSIs by the government (through Natural Resources Wales 
in Wales) where Natural Resources Wales (NRW) “is of the opinion that any area of land is of 
special interest by reason of any of its flora, fauna, geological or physiographical features.” 
6.15 
Section 28G specifies the duty of specific public authorities (including local authorities) to further 
the conservation and enhancement of the features by reason of which the site is designated and 
also to notify NRW of operations likely to damage such features in order that NRW may consent to 
or refuse permission for such operations.

The Conservation of Habitats and Species Regulations 2010 
6.16 
The Conservation of Habitats and Species (Amendment) Regulations 2012 consolidates the 
various amendments that have been made to the Regulations. The original (1994) Regulations 
transposed the EC Habitats Directive on the Conservation of Natural Habitats and of Wild Fauna 
and Flora (Council Directive 92/43/EEC) into national law. 
6.17 
“European protected species” (EPS) are those which are present on Schedule 2 of the 
Conservation of Habitats and Species Regulations 2010. They are subject to the provisions of 
Regulation 41 of those Regulations. All EPS are also protected under the Wildlife and Countryside 
Act 1981 (as amended). Taken together, these pieces of legislation make it an offence to: 
a) Intentionally or deliberately capture, injure or kill any wild animal included amongst these 
species; 
b) Possess or control any live or dead specimens or any part of, or anything derived from a these 
species; 
c) Deliberately disturb wild animals of any such species; 
d) Deliberately take or destroy the eggs of such an animal; or 
e) Intentionally, deliberately or recklessly damage or destroy a breeding site or resting place of 
such an animal, or obstruct access to such a place. 
6.18 
For the purposes of paragraph (c), disturbance of animals includes in particular any disturbance 
which is likely— 
a) to impair their ability— 
I. 
to survive, to breed or reproduce, or to rear or nurture their young, or 
II. 
in the case of animals of a hibernating or migratory species, to hibernate or migrate; or 
6.19 
To affect significantly the local distribution or abundance of the species to which they belong. 
6.20 
Although the law provides strict protection to these species, it also allows this protection to be set 
aside (derogated) through the issuing of licences. The licences in England are currently determined 
by NE for development works. In accordance with the requirements of the Regulations (2012), a 
licence can only be issued where the following requirements are satisfied: 
a) The proposal is necessary ‘to preserve public health or public safety or other imperative 
reasons of overriding public interest including those of a social or economic nature and 
beneficial consequences of primary importance for the environment’; 
b) ‘There is no satisfactory alternative’; and 
c) The proposals ‘will not be detrimental to the maintenance of the population of the species 
concerned at a favourable conservation status in their natural range’. 
6.21 
EPS that may be relevant to this proposal include GCNs, bats, dormouse and otter. 
Invasive Species Legislation 
6.22 
Japanese knotweed and Himalayan balsam are both listed on Part 2, Schedule 9 of the Wildlife 
and Countryside Act 1981 (as amended).  Section 14 of the Act states that it is an offence for a 
person to plant or otherwise cause to grow in the wild any species listed on Part2, Schedule 9.  The 
Environmental Protection Act 1990 contains a number of legal provisions concerning ‘controlled 
waste’.  Any soil or plant material contaminated with Japanese knotweed that is to be discarded is 
classified as controlled waste.

Summary 
1.1 
Abergelli Power Limited (APL) is promoting a new Power Generation Plant with its associated Gas 
and Electricity Connections (the ‘Project’) on agricultural land within Abergelli Farm, north of 
Swansea in the City and County of Swansea (approximately at National Grid Reference 265284, 
201431). 
1.2 
The preliminary ecological appraisal1 identified records of otter Lutra lutra and water vole Arvicola 
amphibius within 2 km of the Project Site boundary, and suitable habitat to support these species 
within the Project Site boundary at the time of the survey (hereafter referred to as the ‘Survey 
Site’). APL commissioned BSG Ecology to undertake an otter and water vole survey of streams 
and wet ditches within the 150 ha of pastoral farmland at and around Abergelli Farm in June 2014 
within the Survey Site, to inform and support an application for Development Consent for the 
Project. 
1.3 
All accessible ponds, streams and wet ditches within the Survey Site boundary were surveyed for 
field signs of use by otter and water vole. 
1.4 
There are water courses on Survey Site that could provide resting places and commuting routes for 
otter. A single fresh spraint was recorded during the survey. This was observed on a rock in the 
stream that runs along the eastern boundary of the Survey Site. 
1.5 
Holes, that were likely to be mammal burrows, were observed at six points along two streams 
within the Survey Site. The holes have the right dimensions to allow use by water voles, but did not 
show signs of current occupation. No latrines, footprints or grazing lawns were observed during the 
survey.

Introduction 
2.1 
Abergelli Power Limited commissioned BSG Ecology to undertake an otter and water vole survey 
in May/June 2014 to inform and support an application for Development Consent for the Project 
described below.  
Site Description 
2.2 
The Survey Site consists of approximately 150 ha of pastoral farmland, primarily grazed by horses. 
The extent of the Survey Site is shown in (Figure 1, Appendix 1) and is centred at National Grid 
Reference 265284, 201431. The nearest settlement is Felindre, which is located approximately 2 
km to the north of the Survey Site, with Swansea approximately 5 km to the south.    
2.3 
The Survey Site is largely agriculturally improved pasture with several areas of marshy grassland, 
particularly in the north, south and north-western ends of the Survey Site. The fields are bounded 
by fences, running along the line of defunct hedgerows, and often accompanied by ditches. There 
is a block of broadleaved woodland on the eastern boundary of the Survey Site and other areas of 
woodland around the marshy grassland to the west of the Survey Site, and around Felindre Gas 
Compressor Station and the two National Grid 400 kV electrical substations that lie at the south-
west end of the Survey Site. The habitats in the surrounding landscape are similar to those within 
the Survey Site boundary – a mixture of improved and marshy grassland interspersed with 
occasional patches of woodland. 
2.4 
There are a number of water courses within the Survey Site as described below: 
 
A stream corridor with small tributaries fed by springs and surface runoff along the 
eastern boundary of the Survey Site, which feeds into the River Llan to the south.  
 
A wooded stream runs along the north western boundary.  
 
Several small streams and wet ditches run through the woodland surrounding the 
Felindre Gas Compressor Station and the two National Grid 400 kV electrical substations. 
 
Drainage ditches border many of the pasture fields. 
Description of Project 
2.5 
APL is promoting a new Power Generation Plant with associated Gas and Electricity Connections 
within Abergelli Farm.  The Power Generation Plant would operate as a Simple Cycle Gas Turbine 
(SCGT) peaking plant and would be designed to provide an electrical capacity of up to 299 
Megawatts (MW).  It would be fuelled by natural gas, supplied by a new underground gas pipeline 
connecting Power Generation Plant to the existing National Grid Gas (NGG) National Transmission 
System (NTS). It would also connect to the National Grid Electrical Transmission System (NETS) 
via underground cable or overhead lines. 
2.6 
BSG Ecology has been appointed as the ecological consultant to undertake an ecology survey, 
which includes a desk study and Extended Phase 1 Habitat Survey as well as a range of Phase 2 
surveys, including an otter and water vole survey. These baseline surveys will be included in an 
appendix to an ecology chapter of an Environmental Statement, which is intended for submission in 
support of the application for Development Consent. 
Aims of Study 
2.7 
The aims of the otter and water vole survey within the Survey Site were to: 
 
Assess where water courses within the Survey Site have the potential to support otter and 
water vole. 
 
Establish the likely presence/absence of each species and, if present, their distribution 
throughout the relevant watercourses.

Methods 
Desk Study 
3.1 
Existing ecological information for the Survey Site and the surrounding area was requested from 
the South East Wales Biodiversity Records Centre (SEWBReC).  Information on European and 
nationally protected2 species, including otter and water vole, was requested covering the Survey 
Site and land up to 2 km from the Survey Site boundary. In addition, on-line mapping and aerial 
photography of the area was also reviewed in May 2014 to identify watercourses that might be 
present within the Survey Site. 
Scoping Survey 
3.2 
A Phase 1 habitat survey was carried out by BSG Ecology in February 2014 and updated in April 
and July 20143. During the Phase 1 habitat survey it was noted that a number of watercourses 
within the Survey Site had the potential to support otter and water vole, although no field signs 
were observed. The ponds within the Survey Site were also assessed at this time, and no field 
signs of otter or water vole were noted. 
Field Survey 
3.3 
The otter and water vole survey included two visits to cover water courses within the Survey Site. 
The first visit covered the north of the Survey Site and was conducted on 20 May 2014 by Anna 
Gundrey MCIEEM and Rachel Taylor ACIEEM. The second visit covered the south of the Survey 
Site and was conducted on 26 June 2014 by Rachel Taylor ACIEEM and Caitlin McCann. All 
accessible water courses were inspected for field signs of otter and water vole. In addition, Rachel 
Taylor ACIEEM and Caitlin McCann surveyed the ponds within the Survey Site while undertaking 
great crested newt Triturus cristatus presence/absence surveys in May 20144.  
Otter 
3.4 
The otter survey was carried out on all accessible water courses within the Survey Site. Survey 
methods followed those recommended in Chanin (2003)5. 
3.5 
The water courses, including the channel and banks, were systematically surveyed for signs of 
otter such as droppings (‘spraints’), runs and footprints.  All areas that were accessible were 
surveyed, and particular attention was given to suitable sprainting areas such as large, flat rocks or 
areas where otters were likely to leave the water course.  Otter spraint can be distinguished from 
other mammal droppings, such as mink, by its distinctive musky smell and the presence of fish 
bones.  Mink scats tend to be twisted in appearance and are smaller.   
3.6 
Signs of, or potential for, permanent dwellings (‘holts’) or resting places for otters were also 
recorded.  Holts and resting places include structures such as cavities in roots of bank side trees, 
piles of logs or flood debris, drains and caves.  Otters can also use resting places above ground in 
reed beds and dense scrub such as bramble Rubus fruticosa and blackthorn Prunus spinosa.   
Water Vole 
3.7 
All water courses that were accessible were surveyed within the optimal period for finding water 
vole (late April to early October). This is in line with survey standards set out in The Water Vole 
Conservation Handbook6. The water courses, including the channel and banks, were

systematically surveyed for signs of water vole such as latrines (a communal area of droppings), 
feeding stations and grazed lawns, burrows (wider than high, diameter 4-8 cm), runs and footprints.   
3.8 
In addition, an assessment was made of whether individual water courses have potential to support 
water vole. The Water Vole Conservation Handbook describes favourable water vole habitat as 
having: wide swathes of riparian vegetation to provide both food and shelter; easily penetrable 
earth banks; and slow flowing, relatively deep (over 1 m) slow flowing water courses.  Factors such 
as shallow water or over-shading by trees are generally unfavourable to water voles. 
Classification of Areas Surveyed for Otter and Water Vole 
3.9 
Target notes (TN) were used to describe the characteristics of the water courses surveyed and to 
record any field signs that were observed. These were mapped (Figure 1, Appendix 1) and the 
target notes included (Appendix 2). In order to further illustrate the findings of the survey, the 
streams and ditches were categorised as follows: 
3.10 
Habitat considered unsuitable for use by otter/water vole – water courses with some or all of 
the following characteristics: no/low water levels; shaded; little vegetation; poached banks; no 
suitable resting places; no field signs of otter or water vole. 
3.11 
Habitat considered suitable for use by otter/water vole – water courses with some or all of the 
following characteristics: permanent flow of water; vegetation on banks; minimal shading; suitable 
resting places present; signs of otter/water vole. 
3.12 
Photographs are included showing the characteristics of water courses within the Survey Site 
(Appendix 3).

Results  
Otter 
Desk Study 
4.1 
SEWBReC provided 32 records of otter within the 2 km search radius, all recorded between 1991 
and 2013. The closest record to the Survey Site is 0.5 km to the south west of the River Llan.  At its 
closest point the River Llan is approximately 0.3 km south of the southern Survey Site boundary, 
within the same surface water catchment, and it links to the Survey Site via the stream running 
through the woodland in the centre of the Survey Site. 
Field Survey 
4.2 
A single fresh otter spraint was found in the stream that runs along the eastern boundary of the 
Survey Site (see TN3, Figure 1, Appendix 1; and Appendix 2). At this point the stream is 
approximately 15 cm deep and with a bed of mud, gravel and rocks, the eastern bank is 
approximately 2 m high and sheer with over hanging trees. The western bank has an 
approximately 45 degree grass slope and is approximately 1.5 m high. 
4.3 
No other signs were observed that confirm otter presence in the other water courses within the 
Survey Site.  
4.4 
The stream that runs along the eastern boundary of the Survey Site also had deep overhangs 
created by the root system of the mature hedge and trees on the east bank. These have potential 
to be used as resting places by otter (see Figure 1, Appendix 1). However, foraging opportunities 
for otters are likely to be limited due to the low water levels (20-30 cm), which would make the 
watercourse less suitable for fish, and therefore foraging otters.   
Water Vole 
Desk Study 
4.5 
SEWBReC provided three records of water vole, within a 2 km search radius. These records were 
from the River Llan approximately 1.9 km from the Survey Site boundary, all from 1996.  This River 
is in the same surface water catchment as watercourses present in the Survey Site, so it is 
possible that water voles could move along water courses that are linked to the River Llan (see 
section 4.1 above). 
Field Survey 
4.6 
During the surveys many of the ditches that had contained water during the first Phase 1 habitat 
survey (in February after a very wet winter) had completely dried out by the time of the otter and 
water vole surveys in May and June 2014. The remaining water courses were fast running and 
shallow. The banks of the streams were often over-shaded with encroaching bramble and gorse or 
had steep, bare banks.  
4.7 
No field signs were observed during the surveys that clearly establish the presence of water vole. 
Some burrows were noted that had dimensions suitable for use by water vole and/or bank vole 
Myodes glareolus and rats, but did not exhibit signs of current use (see TNs 1. 2, 4, 5 and 7). 
However, no associated latrines, footprints or grazing lawns were observed at any of these 
locations, Figure 1, Appendix 1; Appendix 2). There was also no evidence of associated burrows 
below the water line, which is typical of water vole burrows. The holes were therefore considered 
unlikely to be used by water vole and are more likely to have been created by another species of 
small mammal, such as bank vole Myodes glareolus, or been created by water vole but 
subsequently abandoned.

4.8 
No water vole field signs were observed at the ponds within the Survey Site during the great 
crested newt presence/absence surveys in May 20147. 
Incidental Sightings 
In addition to signs of otter and water vole presence recorded during the survey, some signs of 
badger activity were also noted and are included here for completeness. A single hole badger sett 
was found at TN9, with digging and a fresh latrine recorded at TN8.  
Limitations of Study 
4.9 
Some of the southern stretch of the stream along the eastern boundary of the Survey Site had 
extensive bramble and scrub along the banks, with low over-hanging branches and debris in the 
stream itself. This impeded the view of the surveyors along this stretch. However, a large stretch of 
the northern section of the same stream was also surveyed without issue, and therefore this 
limitation should not affect the overall results of the survey. Areas that were inaccessible, or for 
which the visibility was limited due to extensive scrub, are also indicated on the map (Figure 1, 
Appendix 1).

Appendix 2: Target Notes (TN) 
 
Stream at TN1 - The stream is wooded, mostly shaded with shallow bramble covered banks. The 
stream bed is stony, water fast moving and shallow. This provides a sheltered corridor through 
which otter may commute, but no obvious resting places or signs of otter use were observed. 
 
1. 
At TN 1 there is a vertical 1m high bare mud bank on the western side of the stream. The stream is 
approximately 10 cm deep at this point. There is a hole 1 m above the water which had dimensions 
suitable for use by water vole and/or bank vole/rat. No other field signs were observed.  
 
To the south of TN1 is a marshy field with a network of ditches - At the time of survey (May) these 
ditches were dry or contained very little water and had steep banks with very little or no vegetation. 
 
Stream at TN2 to TN10 – The stream is relatively unshaded, with a bed of mud, gravel and rocks. 
The water depth ranges from approximately 10 cm to 20 cm where pools form. It is fast flowing and 
appears clean. The eastern bank is approximately 2 m high and sheer. It is topped by a mature 
hedge the root system of which form a number of deep overhangs by the side of the stream. The 
west bank has an approximately 45 degree grassed slope.  
 
2. 
A hole was found in the vertical east bank, approximately 20 cm above the waterline, which had 
dimensions suitable for use by water vole and/or bank vole/rat. No other field signs were observed. 
3. 
A fresh otter spraint was found on a large, flat stone in the middle of the stream. 
4. 
A pair of holes was found in the east bank approximately 1.5 m from the water line, which had 
dimensions suitable for use by water vole and/or bank vole/rat. No other field signs were observed. 
5. 
A possible otter resting place on east bank. No otter field signs were observed. A 15 cm diameter 
hole was found leading into a cavity under the tree root bole, approximately 2 m above the water 
line. Approximately 3 m to the south of this there are three further holes, 1 m above the waterline 
on the eastern bank with dimensions that would allow use by water vole and/or bank vole/rat. No 
water vole field signs were observed.  
6. 
Tributary of the main stream, this is a narrow brook that has dried out at its northern end. It is over 
shaded by scrub, no field signs for otter or water vole were observed. 
7. 
There is a particularly deep over-hang in the east bank under a root bole. Basal rocks are moss 
free on top suggesting that it may be regularly accessed; however no field signs of otter were 
observed. This has good potential as a resting place for otter. On the west bank, above a culvert 
pipe that runs into the stream from the brook at TN6 there are two holes with dimensions that 
would allow use by water vole and/or bank vole/rat. No other field signs of water vole were 
observed. 
8. 
A deep cavity in the eastern bank along the waterline good provides a potential resting place for 
otter. No otter field signs were observed. On the top of the west bank opposite the cavity are a 
number of fresh patches of badger digging and a fresh badger latrine. 
9. 
A hole was found in the east bank 2 m above the water line; dimensions suggest that this is a 
badger sett. There is a mammal run into the field to the east.  
10. 
The stream becomes very shaded at this point, and the eastern bank is largely undercut providing 
several potential resting places for otter. No field signs were observed.  
 
Damp ditch/brook at TN11 to TN12 – to the north of TN11 this is a dry to damp ditch that has 
mainly bare banks, with some areas over-grown by bramble. It is open to horses and sheep and 
the land around the ditch is poached. No signs of otter or water vole were observed and this 
section is considered unsuitable for use by either species. To the south of TN11 the amount of 
water in the ditch gradually becomes greater until it forms a narrow brook, approximately 10 cm in 
depth.  
 
11. 
The brook is very over-grown with gorse and bramble, the banks are approximately 1 m high and 
the water is quick moving and shallow. There is a fenced culvert 10 m to the north which is partially 
blocked by debris from a fallen tree on the eastern bank. No field signs of otter or water vole were 
observed.  
12. 
The brook is shallow and fast moving with low grassy banks, over grown by bramble and nettle in 
large sections. No signs of otter or water vole were observed. South of this location the stream runs 
through woodland and connects to the stream along the eastern boundary of the Survey Site.  
 
 
 
 
Stream at TN13 to TN18 – The southern section of the stream previously described in TN2 to 
TN10. The banks are lined with trees and a scrub understorey of predominantly bramble, the 
stream is approximately 10 cm – 20 cm deep with a rocky bed. The bank is approximately 1 – 2 m 
high and undercut in places. The extensive scrub impeded the surveyors’ ability to access the 
stream, however the length was walked and notes made when a good view was available. 
  
13. 
The stream is narrow, with a bare bank approximately 1 m on each side. It is encroached by 
bramble and gorse and is largely over shaded. No signs of otter or water vole were observed.  
14. 
A shallow ditch extending north-west of the stream, it is dry at the northern end, the banks and low 
and poached by horses. The south end contains a small amount of slow moving water and is 
overgrown with bramble.  
15. 
A similar ditch to TN14, this is dry to the north and the banks are poached by horses. No signs of 
otter or water vole were observed.  
16. 
The stream is wide, and fast moving, approximately 10 cm in depth. The banks are approximately 1 
m high and covered by bramble. There is some undercutting of the bank, although not deep 
enough to provide resting opportunities for otter. No signs of otter or water vole were observed.  
17. 
The stream is narrow and fast moving, approximately 15cm deep, banks are steep and bare 
topped with bramble. No signs of otter or water vole were observed. 
18. 
The stream is wide and fast flowing, approximately 20 cm deep. Root boles of trees along the 
western bank provide resting opportunities for otter. The eastern bank is low with a stone beach 
where the stream bends. No signs were observed however access was limited due to bramble and 
a fence on the western bank.  
 
Ditches and stream at TN19 to TN21 – ditches run along the edge of sheep pasture, most of 
these are dry with bare banks. A small brook runs from the edge of the woodland through the 
pasture and extends south outside of the site boundary.  
 
19. 
This is a dry sheep poached ditch. No signs of otter or water vole were observed.  
20. 
A shallow brook, approximately 10cm in depth with a 50cm high grassy bank to the west and trees 
along the eastern bank. There are fox runs along the western side. No signs of otter or water vole 
were observed.  
21. 
A nearly dry ditch, small trickle of water runs over a muddy bed. The banks are low and bare, the 
ditch is over shaded by trees which line each side. No signs of otter or water vole were observed. 
  
Water courses in and around wet woodland and National Grid land at TN22 to TN26 – There 
are shallow ditches along the edges of the woodland, with small streams running in the interior of 
the woodland. The streams are approximately 10 cm deep, containing leaf litter and debris. The 
banks are steep with little vegetation other than nettle.  
 
22. 
Very narrow, over-shaded steam with fast moving, shallow water. There is bramble encroaching on 
both banks. No signs of otter or water vole were observed.  
23. 
Slow flowing woodland ditch with little water, and a large amount of leaf litter and debris. The banks 
are low with no vegetation. No signs of otter or water vole were observed. The ditch to the north of 
this point becomes inaccessible.  
24. 
Similar to the ditch at TN23 this ditch is shallow with slow moving water and completely over 
shaded by the woodland, with large amounts of leaf litter. No otter or water vole signs were 
observed.  
25. 
Small stream along the east edge of the field to the east of the Felindre Gas Compressor Station. 
Fast flowing, shallow (15 cm) with gravel and rock bed. Wide mammal run down to the stream at 
this point, though to be used by the sheep resident in the field. No signs of otter or water vole were 
observed.  
26. 
A dry ditch at the time of survey, shaded by trees and full of leaf litter.

Summary 
1.1 
Abergelli Power Limited (APL) is promoting a new Power Generation Plant with associated Gas 
and Electricity Connections (the ‘Project’) on agricultural land within Abergelli Farm north of 
Swansea in the City and County of Swansea (approximately at National Grid Reference 265284, 
201431). 
1.2 
The Preliminary Ecological Appraisal (PEA) (BSG Ecology, 2014) did not identify records of 
dormouse Mucardinus avellanarius within 2 km of the Project Site boundary, but habitat suitable for 
supporting dormouse was found within the Project Site boundary at the time of the Extended Phase 
1 Habitat survey (referred to as the ‘Survey Site’). 
1.3 
APL commissioned BSG Ecology to undertake a presence/absence survey for dormouse in 
suitable woodland, hedgerow and scrub habitats within 150 ha of pastoral farmland within the 
Survey Site, to inform and support an application for Development Consent for the Project. The 
dormouse survey was undertaken between June and November 2014. 
1.4 
The survey did not record any dormouse in the areas surveyed.  Sufficient visits were undertaken 
to determine the likely absence of this species from the Survey Site in line with best practice 
guidance for survey. 
1.5 
All accessible woodland, hedgerow and scrub habitats within the Survey Site boundary were 
included in the survey.

Introduction 
2.1 
Abergelli Power Limited (APL) commissioned BSG Ecology in May 2014 to undertake a dormouse 
survey to inform an application for Development Consent for the Project described below.  
2.2 
APL is promoting a new Power Generation Plant with its associated Gas and Electricity 
Connections (the ‘Project’) on agricultural land within Abergelli Farm, north of Swansea in the City 
and County of Swansea (approximately at National Grid Reference 265284, 201431).  
Site Description 
2.3 
The Survey Site consists of approximately 150 ha of pastoral farmland, primarily grazed by horses. 
The extent of the Survey Site is shown in Figure 1 in Appendix 1 and is centred at National Grid 
Reference 265284, 201431. The nearest settlement is Felindre, which is located approximately 2 
km to the north of the Survey Site, with Swansea approximately 5 km to the south.    
2.4 
The Survey Site is largely agriculturally improved pasture with several areas of marshy grassland, 
particularly in the north, south and north-western extents of the Survey Site. The fields are bounded 
by fences, running along the line of defunct hedgerows, and often accompanied by ditches. There 
is a block of broadleaved woodland on the eastern boundary of the Survey Site and other areas of 
woodland around the marshy grassland to the west of the Survey Site, and around Felindre Gas 
Compressor Station and the two National Grid electrical substations that lie at the south-west end 
of the Survey Site. The habitats in the surrounding landscape are similar to those within the Survey 
Site boundary which comprise a mixture of improved and marshy grassland interspersed with 
occasional patches of woodland. 
Description of Project 
2.5 
APL is promoting a new Power Generation Plant with associated Gas and Electricity Connections 
within Abergelli Farm.  The Power Generation Plant would operate as a Simple Cycle Gas Turbine 
(SCGT) peaking plant and would be designed to provide an electrical capacity of up to 299 
Megawatts (MW).  It would be fuelled by natural gas, supplied by a new underground gas pipeline 
connecting Power Generation Plant to the existing National Grid Gas (NGG) National Transmission 
System (NTS). It would also connect to the National Grid Electrical Transmission System (NETS) 
via underground cable or overhead lines. 
2.6 
BSG Ecology has been appointed as the ecological consultant to undertake ecology surveys, 
which include a desk study and Extended Phase 1 Habitat Survey as well as a range of Phase 2 
surveys, including a dormouse survey. These baseline surveys will be included in an appendix to 
the ecology chapter of an Environmental Statement, which is intended for submission in support of 
the application for Development Consent. 
Aims of Study 
2.7 
The aims of the dormouse survey were to identify whether dormouse are present in woodland, 
hedgerow and scrub habitats within the Survey Site boundary using standard survey methods (as 
specified in Section 3).

Methods 
Desk Study 
3.1 
Existing ecological information for the Survey Site and its surrounding area was requested from the 
South East Wales Biodiversity Records Centre (SEWBReC). Information on protected1 species, 
including dormouse, was requested covering the Survey Site and land up to 2 km from the Survey 
Site boundary. In addition, on-line mapping and aerial photography of the area were also reviewed 
to identify areas of suitable habitat that might be present outside of the Survey Site that could be 
connected to habitats within the Survey Site, or support off-site populations that maintain linkages 
through habitats in the Survey Site. 
Scoping Survey 
3.2 
A Preliminary Ecological appraisal (PEA) was carried out by BSG Ecology in February 2014 and 
updated in April and July 2014 (BSG Ecology, 2014). As part of the PEA woodland, hedgerow and 
scrub habitats were assessed with regard to their suitability to support dormouse in terms of woody 
species diversity and structure. The connectivity of woodland habitats within the wider landscape 
was also considered. 
Field Survey 
3.3 
The survey was undertaken in accordance with the best practice survey guidance as set out in 
English Nature’s Dormouse Conservation Handbook (English Nature, 2006). Under this guidance it 
is stated that to determine presence/absence within a woodland that a minimum of 50 nest tubes at 
a spacing of 15-20 m intervals need to be put out in suitable habitats for several months, and these 
tubes then need to be checked monthly for indications of use by dormouse. The indications of use 
include finding animals in residence within the tube during the survey or finding a nest 
characteristic of the species. Dormouse typically make neat nests comprising tightly woven 
honeysuckle bark (or similar), along with green leaves, normally hazel, though other species are 
used. This differs from the nest of other small mammals which are typically much messier and lack 
a distinct structure. 
3.4 
Each month receives a score based on the probability of dormouse occupying the tubes in that 
month. For a survey to be considered valid a total of 20 or more points are required. The score per 
month is illustrated in Table 1 below.

3.5 
A total of 143 tubes were deployed in woodland, scrub, and hedgerow habitats across the Survey 
Site with 110 tubes deployed in May and June.  Due to difficulties in gaining access permission for 
the access road the deployment in this area was undertaken later in June. The tubes were 
deployed as follows:  
 
55 tubes were deployed on 9 May 2014, the locations of which are shown in red on the Plan 
provided as Figure 1: 
 
A further 55 tubes were deployed on 4 June with the locations shown in green on Figure 1; 
and 
 
When access to the National Grid land was obtained, a further 33 tubes were deployed along 
the access road on 24 June.  The locations of these tubes are shown in blue on Figure 1. 
Limitations of study 
3.6 
The Survey Site was surveyed with a sufficient number and density of tubes to comply with best 
practice guidance on dormouse survey. Most tubes were deployed within the Survey Site between 
June to November inclusive, which scores 20 points under best practice guidance. 20 points is the 
minimum number of points required for a survey to be considered valid. 
3.7 
Some of the tubes (33) were not deployed until 24 June. This was due to late permission to survey 
the National Grid Access road margins. This led to the areas of suitable dormouse habitat adjacent 
to the National Grid access road being surveyed from July, rather than June. This area is a small 
part of the wider habitat within the Survey Site that was identified as having the potential to support 
dormouse. The road margins here are connected to other blocks of woodland and scrub in the 
western and, to a lesser extent (as habitat connections are fragmented in the middle part of the 
Survey Site) the eastern part of the Survey Site and are considered to be contiguous with these 
areas and therefore part of the same dormouse survey area. The results of the survey are clear 
and robust enough to conclude that dormouse is likely to be absent from the Survey Site, 
regardless of the lack of one month of data from a small section of the site, and this is not 
considered to be a significant constraint.

Results  
Desk Study 
4.1 
There were no records of dormouse provided by SEWBREC within 2 km of the Survey Site. 
4.2 
The lack of records in the immediate surrounds of the Survey Site does not necessarily indicate the 
absence of dormouse. A lack of records can be due to a lack of survey, which in turn could be a 
based on former assumptions of dormouse habitat requirements. In recent years dormice have 
been recorded in habitats previously discounted as unsuitable, meaning that survey for this species 
in sub-optimal habitats is currently recommended.  
Scoping Survey 
4.3 
The Survey Site was assessed for its suitability to support dormouse during the PEA survey. It was 
found to support numerous fragments of woodland, some of which are designated as Ancient 
Woodland, as well as several treelines that follow stream corridors or are remnants of former 
wooded areas that have been cleared historically. 
4.4 
The habitats within the Survey Site were assessed as being sub-optimal for dormouse for the 
following reasons: 
 
There is a very low occurrence of hazel Corylus avellana within the Survey Site, along with a 
low diversity of other woody species present on the Survey Site. Dormice typically require a 
variety of woody species to ensure, year round availability of food; 
 
Many of the woodlands have been grazed and lack a well-developed understorey, typically 
required by dormouse; and   
 
The Survey Site lacks hedgerows, with most of the field boundaries comprising post and wire 
fences.  Some tree lines are present, where hedgerows have become defunct though a lack of 
active management. Some small areas of hedgerow are present along the National Grid 
access road and these were included in the survey. The lack of hedgerows reduces the 
suitability of the Survey Site as hedgerows typically serve to provide habitat linkages between 
small woodlands such as those found on the Survey Site and its wider surrounds.

Field Survey  
4.5 
The first survey was carried out on 25 June which excluded the 33 tubes put out the day before 
along the National Grid Access Road.  The 33 tubes not included on 25 June were first surveyed 
on 9 July after having been left to “bed in”2.  The second survey (on 9 July included all the tubes 
and was undertaken on 23rd and 24 of July.  The surveys were carried out by Niall Lusby CMIEEM 
(licence number 53084:OTH:SA:2014) and Gareth Lang (licence number (44285:OTH:SA:2013).

2 Bed in – this phrase is used to describe a period of time that the tubes are left before the first survey is 
carried out. During this time the scent of humans disappears from the tube, and dormice are more likely to 
use them.

Summary 
1.1 
Abergelli Power Limited (APL) is promoting a new Power Generation Plant with its associated Gas 
and Electricity Connections (the ‘Project’) on agricultural land within Abergelli Farm north of 
Swansea in the City and County of Swansea (approximately at National Grid Reference 265284, 
201431). 
1.2 
APL commissioned BSG Ecology to undertake a breeding bird survey within 150 ha of pastoral 
farmland at and around Abergelli Farm in 2014, to inform and support an application for 
Development Consent for the Power Generation Plant.  
1.3 
Breeding birds were surveyed by walking along field boundaries and tracks within the Survey Site 
at a slow pace to enable all birds detected to be located, identified and recorded. Frequent stops 
were made to listen and scan for singing and calling birds. The Survey Site was visited on three 
occasions, once during each of April, May and June. A constant search effort was employed during 
each survey visit, with all habitat types being approached to within approximately 50 m.  
1.4 
Nine bird species of principal importance for nature conservation’ as referred to in S42 of the 
NERC Act 2006 (S42)1 (cuckoo Cuculus canorus, grasshopper warbler Locustella naevia dunnock 
Prunella modularis, house sparrow Passer domesticus, linnet Carduelis cannabina, lesser redpoll 
Carduelis cabaret, skylark Alauda arvensis, song thrush Turdus philomelos, and tree pipit Anthus 
trivialis) were considered likely to breed on site. All nine S42 species recorded within the Survey 
Site are also red-listed species of conservation concern in Wales (RSPB, 2009), with the exception 
of dunnock (which is amber-listed).  An additional seven amber-listed species, bullfinch Pyrrhula 
pyrrhula, mistle thrush Turdus viscivorus, meadow pipit Anthus pratensis, reed bunting Emberiza 
schoeniclus, common redstart Phoenicurus phoenicurus, whitethroat Sylvia communis and willow 
warbler Phylloscopus trochilus were also considered to have bred. 
1.5 
No territories of species listed under Schedule 1 Part 1 of the Wildlife & Countryside Act 1981 (as 
amended) (Schedule 1 species) were recorded, although two Schedule 1 species were recorded 
during the surveys, as follows. A pair of red kite Milvus milvus was recorded mobbing a peregrine 
falcon Falco peregrinus over the Felindre Gas Compressor Station land during survey in May. A 
pair of kites was also recorded flying over the eastern boundary in the northern compartment of the 
Survey Site during the same survey day. Given the timing of the records, and that at least one pair 
were recorded during survey it is likely that red kite breed locally but that the single record of 
peregrine referred to a transient bird. No evidence was found to suggest breeding of either species 
occurred within the Survey Site during 2014. 
                                                      
1 The Natural Environment and Rural Communities Act 2006 (NERC 2006) required the Welsh Assembly Government 
(WAG), based on advice from the Countryside Council for Wales (now part of Natural Resources Wales), to identify 
species and habitats of principal importance for the conservation of biodiversity in Wales.  Section 42 of The NERC Act 
requires the WAG to take steps to “further the conservation” of these species/habitats.

Introduction 
2.1 
Abergelli Power Limited (APL) commissioned BSG Ecology to undertake a breeding bird survey to 
inform and support an application for Development Consent for the Project described below.  
Site Description  
2.2 
The Survey Site consists of approximately 150 ha of pastoral farmland primarily grazed by horses. 
The extent of the Survey Site is shown in Figure 1 and is centred at National Grid Reference 
265284, 201431. The nearest settlement is Felindre, which is located approximately 2 km to the 
north of the Survey Site, with Swansea approximately 5 km to the south.    
2.3 
The Survey Site is largely agriculturally improved pasture with several areas of marshy grassland, 
particularly in the north, south and north-western ends of the Survey Site. The fields are bounded 
by fences, running along the line of defunct hedgerows, and often accompanied by ditches. There 
is a block of broadleaved woodland on the eastern boundary of the Survey Site and other areas of 
woodland around the marshy grassland to the west of the Survey Site, and around Felindre Gas 
Compressor Station and the two National Grid 400 kV electrical substations that lie at the south-
west end of the Survey Site.  The habitats in the surrounding landscape are similar to those within 
the Survey Site boundary – a mixture of improved and marshy grassland interspersed with 
occasional patches of woodland. 
Description of Project 
2.4 
APL is promoting a new Power Generation Plant with associated Gas and Electricity Connections 
within the Survey Site.  The Power Generation Plant would operate as a Simple Cycle Gas Turbine 
(SCGT) peaking plant and would be designed to provide an electrical capacity of up to 299 
Megawatts (MW).  It would be fuelled by natural gas, supplied by a new underground gas pipeline 
connecting the Power Generation Plant to the existing National Grid Gas (NGG) National 
Transmission System (NTS).  It would also connect to the National Grid Electrical Transmission 
System (NETS) via underground cable or overhead lines. 
2.5 
BSG Ecology has been appointed as the ecological consultant to undertake an ecological survey, 
which includes a desk study and Extended Phase 1 Habitat Survey as well as a range of Phase 2 
surveys, including a breeding bird survey.  These baseline surveys will be included in an appendix 
to an ecology chapter of an Environmental Statement, which is intended for submission, as an 
integral part of the application for Development Consent. 
Aims of Study 
2.6 
The survey work undertaken at Abergelli Farm between April and June 2014 aimed to establish: 
 
The number of species present on the Survey Site or the immediate surrounding habitat; 
 
The number of territories held by each species, and 
 
Whether the Survey Site or the immediate surrounding habitat is used by bird species of high 
conservation interest, including: 
a. 
Species protected under Schedule 1 of the Wildlife and Countryside Act 1981 (as 
amended); 
b. 
Species listed on Annex 1 of the Council Directive 79/409/EEC on the Conservation of 
Wild Birds; 
c. 
Species listed in Section 42 of the Natural Environment and Rural Communities Act 
(NERC 2006) as species of principal importance for the conservation of biodiversity in 
Wales; 
d. 
Species listed in the Swansea Local Biodiversity Action Plan (LBAP); and 
 
Abergelli Power Project – Breeding Bird Survey Report

10/03/2015 
e. 
Species listed as having a Red or Amber population status2 (RSPB, 2009). 
 
                                                      
2 Seven quantitative criteria are used to assess the population status of each bird species and to categorise it on the red, 
amber or green list of conservation concern (species that are red-listed are of greatest conservation concern whereas 
those that are green-listed are not considered to be of particular conservation priority or (in a few cases) have insufficient 
data to be robustly categorised). Criteria considered are: global conservation status; evidence of recent decline; evidence 
of historical decline; an unfavourable European conservation status; rarity (in terms of breeding numbers); restricted 
(localised) distribution; and whether a species is considered to be of international conservation importance (featuring in 
the list of birds in Annex 1 of the Birds Directive 1979).  When considering whether a species is added to the red or the 
amber list, factors such as the extent of decline and range contraction are considered.

Methods 
Desk Study 
3.1 
Existing ecological information for the Survey Site and its surrounding area was requested from the 
South East Wales Biodiversity Records Centre (SEWBReC). Information on designated sites was 
requested from within 10 km for European sites, 5 km for nationally designated sites and 2 km of 
the Survey Site for non-statutory sites. The latter search radius was also used for information on 
protected3 or notable species (particularly those identified as S42 species and/or of local 
conservation importance or LBAP4 species), including birds. In addition, an initial study of on-line 
aerial photographs, topographical, and Ordnance Survey maps was made using web-based 
resources including: Where’s the path?5, Google Maps6 and Google Earth Version 6 (Google Inc, 
2010). This, together with the results from a preliminary ecological appraisal7 carried out in 
February 2014 and updated in April 2014, resulted in a detailed understanding of the habitats and 
features on the Survey Site along with an indication of the bird community potentially present. 
Field Survey 
3.2 
The method used was adapted from the British Trust for Ornithology (BTO) Common Bird Census 
(CBC) as described by Gilbert et al. (1998), Although eight to ten visits are usually undertaken for 
CBC sites being monitored over the long term, it is generally accepted that for the purposes of 
assessing potential environmental impacts, three visits are sufficient to describe the value of a 
Survey Site for breeding birds and give an approximation of the number of breeding bird territories 
present within a Survey Site (e.g. SNH, 20058). Breeding birds were surveyed by walking along 
field boundaries and tracks within the Survey Site at a slow pace to enable all birds detected to be 
located, identified and recorded. Frequent stops were made to listen and scan for singing and 
calling birds.  All habitat features were approached to within approximately 50 m, except in horse 
pasture fields. Transects were not walked across closely grazed pasture fields, as it was possible 
to easily view birds by scanning from field boundaries (due to the lack of vegetation and small field 
sizes) and to avoid disturbing horses that were kept in many of them at the time of the survey. Bird 
locations were mapped using standard two-letter British Trust for Ornithology (BTO) codes, and 
bird activity was recorded using standard BTO behaviour codes (Marchant 1983).  
3.3 
The breeding status of birds recorded was categorised as either ‘holding territory’ or ‘showing other 
evidence of breeding’. Birds presumed to be holding territory were those recorded in song. Other 
evidence of breeding included observations of: 
 
Distraction display or injury feigning; 
 
Used nests or eggshells found (occupied or laid within the survey period); 
 
Recently fledged young or downy young; 
 
Adults entering or leaving a nest site in circumstances indicating an occupied nest or an adult 
sitting on nest; 
 
Adults carrying food for young or faecal sacs; 
 
Nest containing eggs; and 
 
Nest with young seen or heard. 
3.4 
The presence of house sparrow near a suitable nesting building was also taken as evidence for 
breeding in this species.

3.5 
The results of the three breeding bird territory mapping surveys were combined to create a single 
map showing all birds considered to be holding territory (Figures 1a and 1b in Appendix 1). BTO 
codes for each species illustrated in Figure 1a and 1b are provided in Table 2 (below). Where a 
bird was observed in the same location during more than one survey visit, and this is judged to be 
the same individual bird, only one registration of that bird is shown on the map. Where more than 
one individual of the same species is shown in close proximity, these are individual birds seen 
simultaneously during a single survey. Note the locations of presumed territories do not represent 
specific nest locations. 
3.6 
The Survey Site was divided into two survey compartments due to its size; the first covered the 
north of the Survey Site (the land north of the gallops that runs from the houses at Abergelli Farm 
to the south-east corner of the Survey Site), and the second covered the south of the Survey Site 
(the land south of the gallops).  Three survey visits were made to each compartment; one in each 
of late April, late May and mid-June.  Table 1 below provides details of the duration and weather 
conditions during surveys.

3.7 
The Felindre Gas Compressor Station and the National Grid electrical substation compounds to the 
south-west of the Survey Site were not entered, due to lack of access. The compounds can be 
viewed adequately from the fence and there is very little suitable habitat for breeding birds within 
these compounds. The land immediately beyond the northern and eastern Survey Site boundaries 
was also not entered. The surveyor(s) scanned areas of adjacent habitat by walking paths and field 
edges and made use of local vantage-points to record species present around the access 
restricted areas. This enabled the entire site to be sampled without trespassing. 
3.8 
In late June, all buildings within the Survey Site, with the exception of those within the National Grid 
compounds referred to above, were inspected for barn owl Tyto alba presence or other evidence of 
presence, such as pellets, nests, or faecal matter. The buildings were primarily visited to inspect for 
bat roosts and the methods are described in detail in the bat roost inspection report. Anecdotal 
evidence from the land owner prior to inspection suggested that none of the buildings were in use 
or had historically been used by barn owl. All trees within the Survey Site were also inspected from 
ground level for evidence of use by bats and barn owl. A sub-set of these trees were identified for 
further roped-access (tree-climbing) survey that involved internal and external inspection of these 
trees. Full details of these surveys are provided in the bat survey report. 
3.9 
The maps from the three visits were combined.  For species where definitive evidence of breeding 
was not obtained, professional judgement (based on a range of factors including knowledge of 
habitat requirements, local status and/or repeat sightings) was used to conclude whether breeding 
was likely.  A precautionary approach was taken, with species suspected to have bred being 
plotted as having done so. 
Survey Limitations 
3.10 
It was not possible to gain access to the access road to the south-west of the Felindre Gas 
Compressor Station and the two National Grid 400 kV electrical substations and also the land 
immediately surrounding these areas during the breeding bird surveys, as shown in Figure 1b. It is 
unlikely that this is a significant constraint to the surveys as the areas that could not be surveyed 
contain similar habitats to those within the areas that were surveyed and it is unlikely that they 
support any additional species that are protected or notable.

Results  
Desk Study Data 
4.1 
A full list of the European designated sites within 10 km, national statutory designated sites within 5 
km, and non-statutory designated sites within 2 km of the Survey Site boundary is provided in the 
preliminary ecological appraisal.  Sites that include a cited ornithological interest are described 
below. 
Statutory Sites of Nature Conservation Importance 
4.2 
Carmarthen Bay and the tidal estuaries that extend from it, approximately 7.2 km west of the 
Survey Site, has been afforded multiple designations and is referred to under the umbrella term 
European Marine Site (EMS9) which includes the Carmarthen Bay area and Estuaries Special Area 
of Conservation (SAC10), and the Burry Inlet Special Protection Area (SPA11). This area also 
contains a Ramsar Wetland of International Importance (Ramsar12). The boundaries of each of 
these sites are not contiguous but all fall within the EMS site. The details of each designation are 
provided below.  
4.3 
The Burry Inlet SPA and Ramsar, located approximately 9.7 km west south-west of the Survey 
Site, is classified for large numbers of overwintering wildfowl and waders that feed in the 
saltmarshes and on the intertidal mud and sand. 
4.4 
The SPA has been classified as it supports important overwintering populations of eleven migratory 
species of waterfowl and an assemblage of 34,962 wintering water fowl including common 
shelduck Tadorna tadorna, Eurasian wigeon Anas penelope, Eurasian teal Anas crecca, northern 
pintail Anas acuta, shoveler Anas clypeata, Eurasian oystercatcher Haematopus ostralegus, grey 
plover Pluvialis squatarola,  red knot Calidris canutus, dunlin Calidris alpina alpina, Eurasian curlew 
Numenius arquata, and common redshank Tringa totanus.  The SPA includes extensive areas of 
intertidal sand and mud-flats, large sand dune systems and the largest continuous area of 
saltmarsh in Wales. 
4.5 
The spring and autumn population of common redshank, and wintering population of northern 
pintail, Eurasian oystercatcher, and red knot are qualifying features for the Burry Inlet Ramsar 
designation. 
4.6 
The Carmarthen Bay and Estuaries SAC, located approximately 7.2 km to the west, is designated 
for its ‘Sandbanks which are slightly covered by sea water all the time’, ‘Estuaries’, ‘Mudflats and 
sandflats not covered by water at low tide’, ‘Large shallow inlets and bays’, ‘Salicornia and other 
annuals colonising mud and sand’, and ‘Atlantic salt meadows’. 
Non-Statutory Sites 
4.7 
There are 23 Sites of Interest for Nature Conservation (SINC) within 2 km of the Survey Site. 
These are described in detail in the preliminary ecological appraisal.  Three SINCs lie partially 
within the Survey Site boundary, of which two have cited ornithological interest. 
4.8 
Rhyd-Y-Pandy Valley Grasslands is a large SINC, which includes three fields that lie within the 
north-east corner of the Survey Site. The site is designated for its wet woodland and woodland with 
                                                      
9 The term ‘European Marine Sites’ (EMS) collectively describes Special Areas of Conservation (SACs) and Special 
Protection Areas (SPAs) that are covered by tidal waters and protect some of our most important marine and coastal 
habitats and species of European importance. 
10 SACs are strictly protected sites designated under the EC Habitats Directive in order to conserve the 189 habitat 
types and 788 faunal species identified in Annexes I and II of the Directive (as amended).  They do not afford protection 
to birds directly (although are often subject to various other designations that do have an ornithological component and 
often offer protection to habitats of value to a range of bird species).   
11 SPAs are internationally important sites classified in accordance with Directive 79/409/EEC on the conservation of wild 
birds (commonly referred to as the Bird Directive).   
12 Ramsar sites are wetlands of international importance designated under the Ramsar Convention.

assemblage of ancient woodland indicator species, scrub, purple moor grass and rush pasture, 
lowland meadow, neutral grassland, scrub, reed bed and water course habitats.  Species of bird 
listed on the SINC form include sky lark, tree pipit, reed bunting, common kestrel Falco tinnunculus, 
herring gull Larus argentatus, red kite, house sparrow, common starling Sturnus vulgaris, song 
thrush and barn owl. It is unclear what the status of these species on the SINC is. 
4.9 
Warn Garn Wen is also an extensive SINC which includes the marshy grassland that lies within the 
western boundary of the Survey Site. The site is designated for purple moor grass and rush 
pasture, wet woodland, scrub and watercourse habitats. Species of bird listed on the SINC form 
include herring gull, lesser black-backed gull Larus fuscus, house sparrow, stonechat Saxicola 
rubicola, common starling and song thrush. It is unclear what the status of these species on the 
SINC is. 
4.10 
There are two SINCs located adjacent to the boundary. Rhos Fawr SINC is a block of land 
immediately to the north of the Survey Site boundary, and Felindre Grasslands SINC lies adjacent 
to the southern tip of the proposed access route. Both have cited ornithological interest. 
4.11 
The Rhos Fawr SINC is designated for its woodland containing an assemblage of ancient 
woodland indicator species, scrub, purple moor grass and rush pasture, and neutral grassland 
habitats. Species of bird listed on the SINC form include tree pipit and common cuckoo Cuculus 
canorus. It is unclear what the status of these species on the SINC is. 
4.12 
The Felindre Grasslands SINC is designated for its wet woodland and lowland mixed deciduous 
woodland, purple moor grass and rush pasture, and scrub habitats. Species of bird listed on the 
SINC form include northern goshawk Accipiter gentilis, tree pipit, lesser redpoll, common linnet, 
reed bunting, common kestrel, common snipe Gallinago gallinago, herring gull, house sparrow, 
green woodpecker Picus viridis, willow tit Poecile montanus, common bullfinch, water rail Rallus 
aquaticus, stonechat, Eurasian woodcock Scolopax rusticola, common starling, song thrush, barn 
owl, and northern lapwing Vanellus vanellus. It is unclear what the status of these species on the 
SINC is. 
4.13 
Two additional SINCs have cited ornithological interest. These are; Penllergaer Forest, located 
approximately 1 km south-west of the Survey Site, and Penllergaer to Llangyfelach Tunnel and 
Railway Line, located approximately 1 km south of the Survey Site. 
4.14 
The Penllergaer Forest SINC is designated for its range of woodland types, purple moor grass and 
rush pasture, reedbeds and watercourses.  Species of bird listed on the SINC form include 
Northern goshawk, common kingfisher Alcedo atthis, lesser redpoll, common cuckoo, lesser 
spotted woodpecker Picoides minor, common grasshopper warbler, common crossbill Loxia 
curvirostra, red kite, house sparrow, wood warbler Phylloscopus sibilatrix, green woodpecker, 
willow tit, common bullfinch, common starling and song thrush. It is unclear what the status of these 
species on the SINC is. 
4.15 
Penllegaer to Llangyfelach Tunnel and Railway Line SINC is also designated for its range of 
woodland types, purple moor grass and rush pasture, scrub and watercourses. Species of bird 
listed on the SINC form include tree pipit, lesser redpoll, common bullfinch, and song thrush. It is 
unclear what the status of these species on the SINC is. 
4.16 
Most of the woodland within the Survey Site is also designated as Ancient Woodland. 
Species Data 
4.17 
SEWBReC provided 21 records of barn owl. The closest of these records is 0.7 km to the west of 
the Survey Site boundary from 1997, with the nearest breeding record 3 km to the south west near 
Penllergaer Woods in 2000. The most recent record is from approximately 3.7 km north-west of the 
Survey Site in April 2013. An additional 5 records were provided for the last 10 years, the nearest 
of which was recorded in 2007, approximately 2 km south-west of the Survey Site,

A red kite was noted circling above a field in the north-west corner of the Survey Site and also over 
Abergelli Farm during the Phase 1 Survey in April 2014. SEWBReC provided 54 records for red 
kite between 1999 and 2013, the record nearest the Survey Site being approximately 150 m to the 
east.

SEWBReC provided a number of records of ground nesting birds in the search area.  These 
included records for Eurasian curlew, northern lapwing and skylark.  A total of 63 records of 
lapwing were provided from between 2000 and 2009, all south of the Survey Site.  The closest of 
these records are located at the tinplate workings site near to Bryn Whilach Farm, approximately 1 
km to the south-west of the Survey Site boundary.  There was one record of curlew from 2011, 
located at the Lliw Reservoir, 1 km north of the Survey Site boundary.  
4.20 
A full list of species, returned from the data search can be found in Table 3 in Appendix 2. 
Breeding Bird Survey (2014) 
4.21 
A total of 53 species were recorded on the Survey Site during the breeding bird survey in 2014. Of 
these, 46 were passerines (including near-passerines) and seven non-passerines. 
Breeding passerines 
4.22 
The bird community was passerine dominated. Those observed holding territories and considered 
to have bred on the Survey Site are presented in Table 2 below. A full list of species, including non-
breeding birds, recorded during the breeding bird survey can be found in Table 4 in Appendix 2.

13 The number of territories where other evidence was found to confirm breeding is indicated. Other evidence of breeding 
was considered to include observations of adults carrying nesting material or food, adults being repeatedly alarmed or 
engaging in territorial disputes, and families including juveniles accompanied by adults. The presence of house sparrow 
near a suitable nesting building was also taken as evidence for breeding in this species.

Twenty eight species of passerine were noted holding breeding territories on the Survey Site. An 
additional two species, lesser redpoll and house sparrow, were observed showing other evidence 
of breeding. 
4.24 
No passerine species listed under Schedule 1 Part 1 of the Wildlife & Countryside Act 1981 (as 
amended)14 were recorded. 
4.25 
Nine S42 species (cuckoo, dunnock, grasshopper warbler, house sparrow, linnet, lesser redpoll, 
skylark, song thrush, and tree pipit) were considered likely to breed on the Survey Site. All nine 
S42 species recorded within the Survey Site are also listed in the Swansea LBAP15, and are red-
listed species of conservation concern in Wales (RSPB Undated), with the exception of dunnock 
(which is amber-listed).  An additional seven amber-listed species, bullfinch, mistle thrush, meadow 
pipit, reed bunting, redstart, whitethroat and willow warbler were also considered to have bred. 
4.26 
Willow warbler was the most abundant breeding species on the Survey Site. Large numbers of 
territories were also held by other passerines typical of a lowland farmland mosaic habitat including 
chiffchaff, chaffinch, robin and wren. Of the S42 species recorded, dunnock and song thrush were 
most abundant, with territories widely distributed across the Survey Site. The abundance of willow 
warbler, dunnock and song thrush on the Survey Site may be attributed to the relatively wide-
ranging habitat preferences of these generalist species (and the tendency of the former two 
species to breed in scrub).  
4.27 
The presence of ground nesting species (skylark and meadow pipit) within the Survey Site reflects 
the fact that much of the Survey Site is grazed pasture. However, the distribution of these species 
was localised, only being recorded in the pasture fields in the north-west of the Survey Site. Other 
species recorded on the pasture habitat during survey in April include stonechat, for which two 
territories were recorded, and northern wheatear Oenanthe oenanthe which were likely to have 
been on passage and not remained to breed on site (see Incidental Records below). Stonechat and 
wheatear were not recorded during breeding bird surveys in May and June.  
4.28 
Grasshopper warbler was associated with marshy areas in the north-western part of the Survey 
Site which reflect the species’ breeding habitat preferences. The species was only recorded during 
survey in April. No further records were made during dusk bat surveys or moth trap surveys carried 
out on the Survey Site during 2014. All registrations of cuckoo were beyond the Survey Site 
boundary. These were recorded near Lletty’r Bugail, approximately 300 m north of the Survey Site 
and at Waun y Garn-wen, and approximately 100 m west of the Survey Site, during survey in April 
                                                      
14 Schedule 1 birds receive full protection under the Wildlife and Countryside Act 1981 (as amended), In addition to the 
protection from killing or taking that all birds, their nests and eggs have under the Act, Schedule 1 birds and their young 
must not be disturbed at the nest. 
15 Based on the 2005 consultation draft of the Swansea LBAP. The forthcoming replacement to this plan will be expected 
to reflect Section 42 Species and Habitats more closely.

and near a pond, north of Cefn-betingau, approximately 100 m east of the Survey Site during 
survey in May.  
4.29 
House sparrow colonies were recorded at the barn north of Abergelli Farm during all survey visits 
and at the Abergelli Farm buildings during the survey in May and June. The individual count was 26 
during the visit in April, 20 during the survey in May and 18 during the survey in June. Therefore, 
the number of breeding pairs within the Survey Site is likely to be between nine and 13. 
4.30 
A family of lesser redpoll were observed in scrub bordering the marshy grassland to the west of the 
Survey Site during the survey in June. Two birds were also recorded in this area during the survey 
in April. No further evidence of breeding in this species was recorded. Observations of single 
individuals were made near the Felindre Gas Compressor Station and National Grid electrical 
substation during survey in May and June. 
4.31 
Three tree pipit territories were recorded during survey. These were recorded immediately south of 
the gallops at the centre of the Survey Site in May and around the fringes of marshy grassland in 
the western part of the Survey Site and in the scrub line on the north-east corner of the Survey Site 
in June. Tree pipit were recorded during all survey visits, with flocks of up to 14 observed over the 
marshy grassland in the western part of the Survey Site during survey work in May. A family of tree 
pipit were recorded on a field boundary in the south-east corner of the Survey Site in June. Two 
pairs of tree pipit were observed immediately south of the gallops at the centre of the Survey Site in 
June. It is likely that these records are of breeding pairs. 
4.32 
Indicative central territory locations are shown on Figures 1a and 1b in Appendix 1. 
Non-Passerines 
4.33 
Red kite were recorded during surveys in April and May. A bird was noted flying over the houses at 
Abergelli Farm and over the pasture in the northern part of the Survey Site during the survey in 
April. Two red kites were recorded mobbing a peregrine falcon over the Felindre Gas Compressor 
Station land during the survey in May. An apparent pair was also recorded flying over the eastern 
boundary in the northern compartment of the Survey Site during the same survey day. Given the 
timing of the records, and that at least one pair was recorded during the survey in May it is likely 
that red kite breed locally. However, no evidence was found to suggest breeding occurred within 
the Survey Site during 2014.  
4.34 
Red kite are listed under Schedule 1 Part 1 of the Wildlife & Countryside Act 1981 (as amended) 
and Annex 1 of the Council Directive 79/409/EEC on the Conservation of Wild Birds making it an 
offence to intentionally or recklessly disturb birds at, on or near an ‘active’ nest, or to directly 
threaten birds, such as deliberately kill or capture birds, destroy their nests or take their eggs. 
4.35 
A peregrine falcon was observed flying over the Felindre Gas Compressor Station and National 
Grid electrical substation during survey in May. There is limited suitable breeding habitat within the 
Survey Site for peregrine falcon, and therefore this species is only likely to visit the Survey Site to 
forage on an occasional basis. Electricity pylons within the Survey Site were scanned from the 
ground for the presence of peregrine (and corvid) nests. No evidence of crow nests, which are 
sometimes appropriated by peregrine were found. Peregrine falcon is listed under Schedule 1 Part 
1 of the Wildlife & Countryside Act 1981 (as amended). 
4.36 
It is possible that some of the farm buildings within the Survey Site may support breeding barn owl, 
although no trees were found that appear, from a ground level inspection, to have sufficiently large 
cavities to support nesting barn owls. The marshy fields in the north-west and at the southern end 
of the Survey Site could provide habitat for field vole Microtus agrestis (a preferred prey species) 
given the thick, tussocky structure of some parts of the sward. There was no evidence that barn 
owl breed within the Survey Site, and are unlikely to have done so in the recent past due to lack of 
droppings in the buildings and anecdotal evidence to this effect from the landowner. No signs of 
barn owl presence were found during building inspections and no birds were recorded during the 
breeding bird surveys.

Incidental Records 
4.37 
Species recorded during other survey work in the bird breeding season but not recorded during 
breeding bird surveys are described below. 
4.38 
Ten male and two female wheatear were observed on the horse pasture in the northern part of the 
Survey Site during a bat transect recce on 24 April 2014, and were presumably transient migrant 
birds.  
4.39 
Young tawny owls Strix aluco were heard calling near the houses in the western part of the Survey 
Site during a moth survey on 16 June, with birds of unknown age heard during a second survey on 
13 August 2014. This suggests that tawny owl bred on the Survey Site in 2014, presumably in the 
woodland block immediately to the south-west of Abergelli Farm, although much of the woodland 
within the Survey Site is suitable nesting habitat for this species. No further observations of tawny 
owl were made. A goshawk (female) was observed flying over the Survey Site at dusk on 16 June, 
and a sparrowhawk Accipiter nisus, was recorded roosting in a tree near the aforementioned 
houses on 13 August. 
4.40 
Red kite were observed flying over the marshy grassland in the western part of the Survey Site 
during a dormouse survey on 29 May, and near Abergelli Farm during bat transect surveys on 22 
May and 17 July 2014.Single red kites flying over the Survey Site were also recorded during Phase 
1 habitat surveys on 24 February 2014 and 14 April 2014. 
4.41 
A spotted flycatcher Muscicapa striata was recorded in the hedge-line near the two houses on 17 
June 2014. Spotted flycatcher is a S42 species of principal importance in Wales, is listed in the 
Swansea LBAP and is a red-listed species of conservation concern in Wales (RSPB, 2009).

Summary 
1.1 
Abergelli Power Limited (APL) is promoting a new Power Generation Plant with its associated Gas 
and Electricity Connections (the ‘Project’) on agricultural land within Abergelli Farm north of 
Swansea in the City and County of Swansea (approximately at National Grid Reference 265284, 
201431). 
1.2 
A Habitat Suitability Index (HSI) assessment for great crested newts Triturus cristatus (GCN) was 
carried out at accessible ponds as part of the preliminary ecological appraisal of the Project Site at 
the time of the survey (hereafter referred to as the ‘Survey Site’). The results of the HSI 
assessment are set out in the Preliminary Ecological Appraisal (BSG, June 2014). APL 
subsequently commissioned BSG Ecology to undertake a presence/absence survey for GCN of 
ponds within 150 ha of pastoral farmland at and around Abergelli Farm in May 2014, to inform and 
support an application for Development Consent for the Project.  
1.3 
Owing to the size and nature of the Survey Site, and the lack of GCN records in the desk study 
search area, it was recommended that a survey for GCNs be conducted for all ponds within the 
Survey Site boundary and within 250 m of the Survey Site boundary. A total of five ponds were 
surveyed including three within the Survey Site and a further two within 250 m of the Survey Site 
boundary. It was not possible to access a number of ponds, which included: 
 
seven ponds outside of the Survey Site but within 250 m of the Survey Site boundary; and 
 
a further four ponds between 250m and 500m from the Survey Site boundary that formed part 
of a cluster of ponds, the remainder of which were within 250m of the Survey Site boundary. 
1.4 
The survey did not record any GCNs in the ponds surveyed, although palmate newts Lissotriton 
helveticus were recorded in three ponds and smooth newts Lissotriton vulgaris were recorded in 
two ponds. As a consequence, further surveys to establish the population size class of GCN were 
not necessary and were not undertaken.

Introduction 
 
2.1 
Abergelli Power Limited commissioned BSG Ecology to undertake a presence/absence GCN 
survey in May 2014 to inform and support an application for Development Consent for the Project 
described below.  
Site Description 
2.2 
The Survey Site consists of approximately 150 ha of pastoral farmland primarily grazed by horses. 
The extent of the Survey Site is shown in Figure 1 in Appendix 1 and is centred at National Grid 
Reference 265284, 201431. The nearest settlement is Felindre, which is located approximately 2 
km to the north of the Survey Site, with Swansea approximately 5 km to the south.    
2.3 
The Survey Site is largely agriculturally improved pasture with several areas of marshy grassland, 
particularly in the north, south and north-western ends of the Survey Site. The fields are bounded 
by fences, running along the line of defunct hedgerows, and often accompanied by ditches. There 
is a block of broadleaved woodland on the eastern boundary of the Survey Site and other areas of 
woodland around the marshy grassland to the west of the Survey Site, and around Felindre Gas 
Compressor Station and the two National Grid 400 kV electrical substations that lie at the south-
west end of the Survey Site.  The habitats in the surrounding landscape are similar to those within 
the Survey Site boundary – a mixture of improved and marshy grassland interspersed with 
occasional patches of woodland. 
Description of Project 
2.4 
APL is promoting a new Power Generation Plant with associated Gas and Electricity Connections 
within Abergelli Farm.  The Power Generation Plant would operate as a Simple Cycle Gas Turbine 
(SCGT) peaking plant and would be designed to provide an electrical capacity of up to 299 
Megawatts (MW).  It would be fuelled by natural gas, supplied by a new underground gas pipeline 
connecting the Power Generation Plant to the existing National Grid Gas (NGG) National 
Transmission System (NTS).  It would also connect to the National Grid Electrical Transmission 
System (NETS) via underground cable or overhead lines. 
2.5 
BSG Ecology has been appointed as the ecological consultant to undertake an ecology survey, 
which includes a desk study and Extended Phase 1 Habitat Survey as well as a range of Phase 2 
surveys, including presence / absence survey for GCNs. These baseline surveys will be included in 
an appendix to an ecology chapter of an Environmental Statement, which is intended for 
submission, in support of the application for Development Consent. 
Aims of Study 
2.6 
The aims of the GCN survey were to identify whether GCNs are present in the ponds within the 
Survey Site and those within 250 m of the Survey Site boundary using standard survey methods 
(as specified in Section 3).

Methods 
Desk Study 
3.1 
Existing ecological information for the Survey Site and its surrounding area was requested from the 
South East Wales Biodiversity Records Centre (SEWBReC).  Information on protected1 species, 
including GCNs, was requested covering the Survey Site and land up to 2 km from the Survey Site 
boundary. The National Biodiversity Network Gateway2 was also checked for records for 1 x 1 km 
grid squares in which GCN records have occurred. In addition, on-line mapping and aerial 
photography of the area were also reviewed to identify ponds that might be present within the 
Survey Site and 500 m of the boundary based on recommendations made in the Natural England 
(formerly English Nature) GCN Mitigation Guidelines3 (the selection of an appropriate buffer 
distance for survey is explained in more detail below). 
Scoping (HSI) Survey 
3.2 
A Preliminary Ecological Appraisal was carried out by BSG Ecology in February 2014 and updated 
in April 20144. As part of this survey, all accessible ponds within 250 m of the Survey Site were 
visited and assessed against the criteria of Oldham et al. (2000)5. This was to establish the 
likelihood of their use by GCNs using a Habitat Suitability Index (HSI), and to identify the scope of 
the GCN presence/absence field survey described below.  
3.3 
The information collected during the HSI assessment provides context of how ponds within or in 
proximity to the Survey Site may connect with habitat available for newts in the surrounding 
landscape, and also to give greater confidence to the assessment carried out on each pond.  
3.4 
Information on the physical features and characteristics of each pond within 250 m of the Survey 
Site was collected, to enable an HSI score to be derived for each pond, by applying the scoring 
system developed by the Herpetological Conservation Trust (HCT, 2008)6. Where a cluster of 
ponds was found (P01-P08; see Figure 1) with some ponds within 250 m of the Survey Site and 
some ponds beyond this distance, the intention was to carry out an HSI on all ponds within the 
cluster (although lack of access prevented this in this case).   
3.5 
The HSI is calculated by allocating scores to features associated with each pond including features 
such as size, quality of surrounding habitat and presence of fish. These scores are then used to 
calculate the overall HSI for each pond as a number between 0 and 1, with 0 being the least 
suitable and 1 being the most suitable. The HSI score allows each pond to be placed in one of five 
categories defining its suitability for GCNs as follows: 
 
<0.5  
 
= poor 
 
0.5 – 0.59 
= below average 
 
0.6 – 0.69 
= average 
 
0.7 – 0.79 
= good 
 
>0.8  
 
= excellent 
3.6 
In addition, there are a number of wet ditches present within the Survey Site and within 250 m of 
the Survey Site boundary. All of the wet ditches are narrow (<1 m width) and did not hold more 
than a few centimetres of water during February – June 2014 despite an exceptionally wet winter.

They are not thought to provide suitable habitat for GCNs and presence / absence surveys are not 
considered to be required for these waterbodies.  
Field Survey 
3.7 
Following the initial HSI assessment (see above) four GCN survey visits were undertaken within 
the period mid-March to mid-June to establish presence/absence (with at least two surveys during 
mid-April to mid-May), with an additional two surveys (six in total) required to estimate population 
size if GCN were found during the first four surveys. The GCN field survey work was undertaken in 
2014 and was completed in accordance with the Natural England (2001) GCN Mitigation 
Guidelines.  
3.8 
In determining the distance at which presence/absence survey of ponds would take place, Natural 
England guidance has been considered and an approach developed that is proportionate to the 
likelihood of encountering GCNs (Note that where a survey is conducted in Wales, Natural 
Resources Wales advise that the Natural England guidance is consulted.) 
3.9 
Natural England guidance on geographical limits of survey is discussed in Section 5.4 of the GCN 
Mitigation Guidelines which recommends that:  
“For a common situation, where a plot of land containing a pond is proposed for development, the 
pond itself should be surveyed, and other ponds up to 500 m away should also be checked, if it is 
thought likely that great crested newt populations centred on these ponds would be affected by 
changes to the plot.” 
3.10 
Natural England guidance is further developed in the GCN Method Statement7  which states that:  
“In keeping with a proportionate and risk-based approach, surveys need reasonable boundaries. 
The great crested newt mitigation guidelines explain that surveys of ponds up to around 500m from 
the development might need to be surveyed. The decision on whether to survey depends primarily 
on how likely it is that the development would affect newts using those ponds. For developments 
resulting in permanent or temporary habitat loss at distances over 250m from the nearest pond, 
carefully consider whether a survey is appropriate. Surveys of land at this distance from ponds are 
normally appropriate when all of the following conditions are met: (a) maps, aerial photos, walk-
over surveys or other data indicate that the pond(s) has potential to support a large great crested 
newt population, (b) the footprint contains particularly favourable habitat, especially if it constitutes 
the majority available locally, (c) the development would have a substantial negative effect on that 
habitat, and (d) there is an absence of dispersal barriers.” 
3.11 
The approach that has been taken for these field surveys is consistent with the above guidance 
and advice from Natural England. Where access was available, presence/absence surveys for 
GCN were carried out on all ponds within 250 m of the Project Site. The exception to this were 
pond clusters that are interconnected to each other (less than 250 m apart) and which therefore 
could be considered to be part of the same population (should GCN be found). However, no such 
ponds (P01-P08 and P012-P014) were accessible as shown on Figure 1. As explained in the 
limitations section below, it is not considered to be a significant constraint to the findings of the 
survey that some ponds could not be accessed. 
Limitations of study 
3.12 
The GCN field surveys were undertaken within the recommended survey period and in suitable 
weather conditions apart from the torchlight survey and egg search on 19/05/2014 where heavy 
rain occurred leaving some ponds turbid, making survey less effective for a short period. 
Nevertheless, the surveys were considered to be effective despite the reduced visibility. 
3.13 
Two ponds (P07 and P08) located within the Water Treatment Works to the northwest of Project 
Site that were classified during the HSI assessment as being of ‘average’ or ‘good’ value for GCNs 
could not be surveyed due to access not being granted by landowners. In addition, access was not 
granted by landowners to Ponds P01, P02, P03, P04, P05, P06, P12, P13 and P14, which would 
have been surveyed for presence/absence of GCN, had access been possible.

3.14 
In considering the significance of not surveying the inaccessible ponds both within and beyond 250 
m from the Project Site, it is useful to examine the results of the presence / absence surveys for 
those ponds that could be surveyed, as well as the results of the desk study, which places the 
Survey Site into a wider context (see 4.1). The presence/absence survey did not reveal the 
presence of GCNs in any of the five ponds surveyed, although three of the ponds supported 
smooth and /or palmate newts and were also thought to provide suitable habitat for GCNs. This 
included all ponds within the Survey Site, three of which were of ‘average’ suitability as derived 
from the Habitat Suitability Assessment. The Survey Site is on the edge of the known range of 
GCN and the lack of desk study records within 2 km of the Survey Site is consistent with this, as is 
a search of the National Biodiversity Network website where the closest record of GCN was 
approximately 7.5 km from the Survey Site.  
3.15 
The conclusion that may be drawn is that since suitable ponds within the Survey Site were not 
occupied by GCNs, and no GCN records have been located within 7 km of the Survey Site, it is 
unlikely that GCNs are present in the inaccessible ponds. Notwithstanding this, if any of the ponds 
that were not surveyed (most are beyond 250 m from the Survey Site) did indeed support GCNs, it 
is likely that they would be present in such low numbers and at a sufficient distance from the 
Survey Site as to be unaffected by the Project. A Natural England funded research report into 
trapping efficiency on sites where GCNs are present (Cresswell and Whitworth, 2004) supports this 
assertion. It arrives at the conclusion that very few animals were captured at distances greater than 
100 m from a breeding pond. As a consequence, it is not considered to be a significant constraint 
to the findings of the survey that some ponds could not be surveyed.

Results  
Desk Study 
4.1 
No records of GCNs within 2 km of the Survey Site were returned by SEWBReC.  The closest 1 x 1 
km Grid Square in which GCN records have occurred is ca. 7.5 km to the south-east of the Survey 
Site, near Llandarcy8. 
Scoping survey 
4.2 
Twelve ponds were identified within 250 m of the Survey Site boundary with the aid of aerial 
photographs and OS maps.  Of these, two (P16 and P17) were identified within the Survey Site 
boundary, 10 (P05, P06, P07, P08, P09, P10, P12, P13, P14, and P15) were located within 250 m 
of the Survey Site and another four (P01, P02, P03, and P04) beyond 250m of the Survey Site but 
forming part of a cluster of ponds (with P05-P08) within the Water Treatment Works to north-west 
of the Survey Site. An additional on-site pond (P11) was found whilst carrying out other survey 
work on 21 May 2014 in the marshy grassland in the north-west of the Survey Site. An HSI 
assessment was carried out on the seven ponds that were accessible within 250 m of the Survey 
Site boundary during the first Phase 1 survey visit (in February).  This included: the two on-site 
ponds (P16 and P17); one pond within 100 m of the Survey Site boundary (P15); and ponds within 
250 m of the Survey Site boundary for which access was possible (P07, P08, P09 and P10). An 
HSI assessment was also carried out on P11 following its discovery in May 2014.

Figure 1 shows which ponds were surveyed and which were inaccessible on private land.

The Survey Site lies in a part of Wales where the distribution of GCNs is patchy, with the species 
largely absent to the west of the Survey Site. Whilst this reduces the probability that GCNs would 
be present within the Survey Site, it does not rule out their presence.  There are a number of ponds 
in and around the Survey Site, and suitable habitat for newts in their terrestrial phase, including old 
hedge banks, marshy grassland and woodland within the Survey Site.  Accordingly, whilst the 
ponds surveyed did not have a ‘good’ or ‘excellent’ HSI score, they did have potential to provide 
breeding habitat for GCNs.  
4.6 
The scoping exercise concluded that surveys should be carried out on all ponds within 250 m of the 
Survey Site boundary, except P09, which was a small recession with a small amount of water in 
February and completely dry in April. In addition the cluster of inaccessible ponds within the 
grounds of the water treatment works (to the north-west of the Survey Site) are likely to be of 
similar ‘good’ quality as Pond 08 (which was visible through the gate) and it was concluded that 
surveys of this cluster of ponds (including P01, P02, P03 and P04) should also be carried out 
following the rationale explained in Section 3.7.

Field Survey  
4.7 
GCN presence-absence surveys were carried out on Ponds P10, P11, P15, P16, and P17. P15 
dried out completely between the first and second visits and was only surveyed once. The ponds 
within the Water Treatment Works (P01-P08), including four ponds beyond 250m from the Survey 
Site could not be surveyed: access to these ponds was denied on grounds of Health & Safety. In 
addition, access was denied to the cluster of three ponds (P12-P14) to the east of the Survey Site. 
The land surrounding these ponds contains Japanese Knotweed Fallopia japonica (an invasive 
species) and is subject to an exclusion and treatment programme which precludes access to third-
parties due to the risk of spreading the plant. 
4.8 
Surveys between May 12th and May 22nd were carried out by Stephanie Boocock MCIEEM under 
the class licence (WML-CL08) with assistance from Caitlin McCann, Owain Waters and Rachel 
Taylor. For Pond 11, which was identified late during other surveys, the third and fourth visits were 
carried out by Matthew Hobbs MCIEEM under license number (52219:OTH:SA:2014) with 
assistance from Rachel Taylor and Gareth Lang. On each visit, weather conditions, including air 
temperature were recorded. Table 1 gives details of the surveys.

The likely absence of GCNs was established for all five ponds surveyed in 2014 the four presence / 
absence surveys. Additional surveys to make a population size class assessment were not 
required (following Natural England 2001).

Summary 
1.1 
Abergelli Power Limited (APL) is promoting a new Power Generation Plant with its 
associated Gas and Electricity Connections (the ‘Project’) on agricultural land within 
Abergelli Farm, north of Swansea in the City and County of Swansea (approximately at 
National Grid Reference 265284, 201431). 
1.2 
A desk study undertaken as part of the Preliminary Ecological Appraisal (PEA) returned 
records of the common reptile species: adder Vipera berus, grass snake Natrix natrix, 
common lizard Zootoca vivipara and slow worm Anguis fragilis within 2 km of the Project 
Site boundary. Suitable habitat to support these species was identified within the Project 
Site boundary at the time of the survey (hereafter referred to as the ‘Survey Site’).  
1.3 
APL commissioned BSG Ecology to undertake a reptile survey of all suitable habitat for 
reptiles within the Survey Site boundary. Habitats selected for survey included marshy 
grassland areas, scrubby woodland edges, overgrown field margins either along remnant 
hedge or ditch banks.  
1.4 
Seven surveys visits were carried out during August and September 2014, during which 
the presence of common lizard and grass snake was confirmed within the Survey Site. 
1.5 
317 refugia were deployed in 33 ha of habitat identified as being suitable to support 
reptiles within the Survey Site, achieving a density of 9.6 refugia per ha. The Survey Site 
was split into four Areas in order to describe the distribution of reptile records 
1.6 
A peak count of 50 common lizard was recorded on 26 August 2014; common lizard was 
recorded in all areas surveyed, with highest numbers recorded in Areas 1 and 3 in the 
marshy grassland areas in the north-west of the Survey Site and the east of the Survey 
Site respectively.  The presence of juveniles and gravid females confirms breeding on the 
Survey Site.   
1.7 
A peak count of five grass snake was recorded during the survey on 26 August 2014.  All 
observations of grass snake were made in Area 3, in the marshy grassland close to the 
pond in the east of the Survey Site.  The presence of juvenile animals suggests that a 
breeding population is present on the Survey Site.

Abergelli Power Limited (APL) commissioned BSG Ecology to undertake a reptile survey 
in May/June 2014 to inform and support an application for Development Consent for the 
Project described below. 
Site Description 
2.2 
The Survey Site consists of approximately 150 ha of pastoral farmland, primarily grazed 
by horses. The extent of the Survey Site is shown on Figures 1a and 1b, Appendix 1 as 
illustrated by the red line boundary. It is centred at National Grid Reference 265284, 
201431. The nearest settlement is Felindre, which is located approximately 2 km to the 
north of the Survey Site, with Swansea approximately 5km to the south. 
2.3 
The Survey Site is largely agriculturally improved pasture with several areas of marshy 
grassland particularly in the north, south and north-western extents of the Survey Site. 
The fields are bounded by fences, running along the line of defunct hedgerows, and often 
accompanied by ditches. There is a block of broadleaved woodland on the eastern 
boundary of the Survey Site and other areas of woodland around the marshy grassland to 
the west of the Survey Site, and around Felindre Gas Compressor Station and the two 
National Grid 400kV electric substations that lie at the south-west end of the Survey Site. 
The habitats in the surrounding landscape are similar to those within the Survey Site 
boundary – a mixture of improved and marshy grassland interspersed with occasional 
patches of woodland. 
Description of Project 
2.4 
APL is promoting a new Power Generation Plant with associated Gas and Electricity 
Connections within Abergelli Farm. The Power Generation Plant would operate as a 
Simple Cycle Gas Turbine (SCGT) peaking plant and would be designed to provide an 
electrical capacity of up to 299 Megawatts (MW). It would be fuelled by natural gas, 
supplied by new underground gas pipelines connecting the Power Generation Plant to 
the existing National Grid Gas (NGG) National Transmission System (NTS). It would also 
connect to the National Grid Electrical Transmission System (NETS) via underground 
cables or overhead lines. 
2.5 
BSG Ecology has been appointed as the ecological consultant to undertake ecology 
surveys, which include a PEA as well as a range of Phase 2 surveys, including a reptile 
survey. These baseline surveys will be included in an appendix to an ecology chapter of 
an Environmental Statement, which is intended for submission in support of the 
application for Development Consent.  
Aims of Study 
2.6 
The aims of the reptile survey within the Survey Site were to: 
 
Assess where habitats within the Survey Site have the potential to support reptiles; and 
 
Establish the likely presence/absence of each species and, if present, their distribution within 
the Survey Site.

Methods 
Desk Study 
3.1 
Existing ecological records for European and nationally protected2 species, including 
reptiles was requested from the South East Wales Biodiversity Records Centre 
(SEWBReC).  Records were provided for the Survey Site and a 2km buffer area beyond 
the Survey Site boundary. On-line mapping and aerial photography of the area was also 
reviewed in May 2014 to identify potential reptile habitat present within the Survey Site. 
Scoping Survey 
3.2 
During the PEA carried out by BSG Ecology in February 2014, which was subsequently 
updated in April and July 2014, habitats within the Survey Site that had the potential to 
support common species of reptile were identified. The following areas were identified as 
containing habitats suitable to support reptiles: 
 
Area 1: An extensive area of marshy grassland / wet modified bog in the north-west of the 
Survey Site and a smaller area of road verge on the edge of semi-improved marshy grassland; 
 
Area 2: Areas of overgrown grassland, open ground and scrub as well as overgrown field 
margins along either remnant hedge banks or ditches in the north-east of the Survey Site;  
 
Area 3: Wood piles, overgrown banks, scrubby woodland fringes and marshy grassland  areas 
in the east of the Survey Site, as well as dry grassland and scrub bordering the gallops in the 
centre of the Survey Site; and 
 
Area 4: Dry grassland and scrub along the periphery of the Felindre Gas Compressor Station 
and the two National Grid 400kV electric substations, as well as areas of marshy grassland on 
the periphery of these habitats, in the south-west extent of the Survey Site. 
3.3 
The areas assessed as being suitable for reptiles are shown on Figures 1a and 1b in 
Appendix 1. 
Field Survey 
3.4 
The reptile survey was undertaken in accordance with best practice guidance, as set out 
in the Herpetofauna Worker’s Manual (Gent et al., 2003) and guidelines for reptile survey 
published by Froglife (1999). A total of seven visits were made to each refugia during late 
August and September 2014.   This period is within the optimum survey period for 
reptiles. 
3.5 
A survey was carried out to establish the likely presence/absence of each reptile species 
and, if present, their distribution through the Survey Site. This included the placement of 
317 artificial refugia comprising of 50 x 50 cm roofing felt sections, which were placed 
within suitable habitats within the Survey Site (shown on Figures 1a and 1b in Appendix 
1). In total approximnately 33 ha (approximately 22% of the total Survey Site area) of 
suitable reptile habitat was identified within the Survey Site, this means that the survey 
attained a refugia density of 9.6 refugia per hectare which approaches the upper limit of 
the guideline density of 5-10 refugia per hectare of suitable reptile habitat (Froglife, 1999). 
3.6 
Best practice guidance recommends that refugia are allowed to “bed in” for a minimum of 
one week before the survey commences. The “bedding in” period allows vegetation to die 
back beneath the refugia creating a close fit to the ground and allowing the development 
of suitable humidity and temperature conditions. It also allows time for reptiles to locate 
and become accustomed to the refugia. Refugia in Area 1 were deployed on 16 April 
2014, and the remainder of the refugia deployed on 11 August 2014.  The first survey 
visit was undertaken on 22 August giving a minimum bedding in period of 11 days.  
3.7 
During each survey, refugia were approached carefully so that any reptiles basking on 
top of them could be observed before they were disturbed by the surveyor. Once the 
 
Abergelli Power Project – Reptile Survey Report

10/03/2015 
refugia had been inspected for basking reptiles, the refugia were carefully lifted and 
checked for any reptiles sheltering underneath.  
3.8 
Some areas initially assessed as being suitable for reptiles were not included in the 
refugia survey either due to a change in landuse such as ploughing or due to the regular 
grazing by horses as the presence of horses means that the refugia were at risk of 
trampling, with an inherant risk of injury to reptiles sheltering underneath, Figures 1a and 
1b reflect this with some areas of suitable habitat not containg artificial refugia as part of 
the survey. 
Direct Observation 
3.9 
The surveyors made visual searches whilst on site by slowly walking between refugia and 
watching for signs of movement. Any existing refugia (e.g. pieces of wood, stones) were 
also checked where appropriate. A supplimentary direct observation survey aims to 
eliminate bias towards recording those reptile species more likely to use refugia.  
Reptile Survey Details  
3.10 
Surveys were conducted during optimum weather conditions, generally dry, with low 
wind, lightly overcast or hazy sunshine, and a temperature range of 9-18°C (Froglife, 
1999; Gent & Gibson, 20031). This temperature range includes the optimum temperature 
ranges for recording most of the widespread UK species of reptile (see Table 1, below).  
3.11 
Due to the large number of refugia and the extent of the Survey Site, surveys were often 
completed by two surveyors in one day or by one surveyor over two days (subsequent 
days where weather was permitting).

Limitations to Methods 
3.12 
The survey method is designed to identify the presence or likely absence of common 
reptile species and to provide an indication of the abundance of reptiles present within the 
Survey Site. However it is possible that the survey may have only recorded a small 
sample of the populations present, and that if a reptile species occurs at a low density, it 
may have been missed. 
3.13 
On two survey visits (Visit 4 on 3 September and Visit 5 on 11 September) the average 
temperature for the survey was slightly higher than is recommended (both averaged 18.5 
°C) for surveying. It is not considered to have affected the overall result of the survey, as 
the common species of reptile that were recorded on site are known to bask at higher 
temperatures (Gent & Gibson, 2003). In addition, the numbers of reptiles recorded were 
similar to numbers recorded during the other surveys, with the 4th and 6th highest total 
counts of reptiles recorded during these surveys.

Results  
Desk Study 
4.1 
SEWBReC provided 12 records of reptiles, between 1998 and 2010. These included 
records of all the common reptile species: adder, grass snake, common lizard, and slow 
worm. The closest record is of a common lizard, approximately 0.8 km to the west of the 
Survey Site boundary. Most records are from the south-west side of the tinplate working 
near to Bryn Whilach Farm, approximately 1 km to the southwest of the Survey Site 
boundary. 
Field Survey 
4.2 
Reptiles were recorded during refugia checks and visual searches on site. Details of the 
timing of surveys and weather conditions are provided in Table 2.

4.3 
A summary of the survey results is provided in Table 3 below and the full results are 
presented in Appendix 2. The locations where reptiles were recorded is presented in 
Figures 1a and 1b in Appendix 1. Two common species of reptile were recorded at the 
Survey Site; common lizard and grass snake. No other reptile species were recorded.  
The majority of records were associated with artificial refugia and where direct 
observation of reptiles were made during the surveys, the closest refugia number was 
used to indicate the sighting location.  
Common Lizard  
4.4 
A total of 163 adult and juvenile common lizard observations were recorded during the 
seven survey visits, with a peak count of 50 recorded during the second visit on 26 
August 2014 (Survey No. 2).  
4.5 
Area 1 was surveyed with 38 refugia and the highest numbers of common lizard were 
recorded from this area, with 58 recorded over the seven visits, and a peak count of 22 
on 28 August 2014 (Survey No. 3). All of these records were from the extensive area of 
marshy grassland / wet modified bog with no observations of any reptiles made along the 
road verge also included in Area 1.   
4.6 
Area 2 was surveyed with 65 refugia and a total of 36 common lizard observations were 
recorded during the seven visits, with a peak count of 15 on 28 August 2014 (Survey No. 
3). The animals recorded were fairly evenly distributed across the habitats included in this 
area, although most records were from the eastern half of this area.

4.7 
Area 3 was surveyed with 89 refugia and a total of 51 common lizard observations were 
recorded during the seven survey visits with a peak count of 23 on 26 August 2014 
(Survey No. 2). The majority of the records were from the marshy grassland on the 
eastern boundary of the Survey Site, with occasional records along the gallops track.  
4.8 
Area 4 was surveyed with 125 refugia and a total of 18 common lizard observations were 
recorded during the seven surveys with a peak count of seven on 26 August 2014 
(Survey No. 2).  
4.9 
During the course of the survey both male and female common lizard were recorded with 
some of the females being gravid, which confirms that there is a breeding population 
present on the Survey Site. 
Grass snake 
4.10 
In total ten observations were recorded for grass snake during the course of the survey 
with a peak count of five recorded on 26 August 2014 (Survey No. 2).  All observations of 
grass snake were made in Area 3 in the marshy grassland close to the pond. 
4.11 
Juvenile grass snake were recorded along with adults which is suggestive that a breeding 
population is present on the Survey Site, however as grass snake are a wide ranging 
species and the location of the animals recorded on site was close to the Survey Site 
boundary; the presence of juveniles does not necessarily confirm that breeding takes 
place on site. 
Other species 
4.12 
Common toad Bufo bufo was found across the Survey Site with a total of 51 records 
made for this species and a peak count of 17 recorded on 28 August 2014 (Survey No. 
3). 
4.13 
Common frog Rana temporaria was recorded once on 26 August 2014 (Survey No. 2). 
Large numbers of recently emerged juvenile common frog were observed during the 
refugia collection on 16 September 2014. These sightings were made in the areas of 
marshy grassland and were not associated with the artificial refugia.

Summary 
1.1 
Abergelli Power Limited (APL) is promoting a new Power Generation Plant with its associated Gas 
and Electricity Connections (the ‘Project’) on agricultural land within Abergelli Farm, north of 
Swansea in the City and County of Swansea (approximately at National Grid Reference 265284, 
201431). 
1.2 
The preliminary ecological appraisal1 identified that invasive species of plants, as listed under Part 
II of Schedule 9 of the Wildlife and Countryside Act (WCA), 1981 (as amended) (specifically 
Japanese Knotweed Fallopia japonica and Himalayan balsam Impatiens glandulifera), are present 
on the Survey Site in a number of areas. The report recommended that a detailed survey to map 
the distribution of any invasive species should be carried out to inform any management measures 
that would need to be implemented to remove or control the spread of these species during the 
construction and operation of the Project.  
1.3 
APL commissioned BSG Ecology to undertake an invasive survey of streams and wet ditches 
within the 150 ha of pastoral farmland at and around Abergelli Farm in June 2014 within the Survey 
Site, to inform and support an application for Development Consent for the Project.  
1.4 
The Survey Site was surveyed in July 2014 by an ecologist from BSG Ecology.  All accessible 
areas of the Survey Site were walked with areas of dense scrub assessed from the perimeter of the 
scrub, and the presence of five species included under Part II were recorded within the Survey 
Site: Japanese knotweed, Himalayan balsam, rhododendron Rhododendron ponticum, floating 
pennywort Hydrocotyle ranunculoides and montbretia Crocosmia x crocosmiiflora. 
1.5 
Of the five species Himalayan balsam and Japanese knotweed were the most widespread within 
the Survey Site.

Introduction 
2.1 
APL commissioned BSG Ecology to undertake an invasive species survey in May 2014 to inform 
and support an application for Development Consent for the Power Generation Plant. 
Site Description 
2.2 
The Survey Site consists of approximately 150 ha of pastoral farmland, primarily grazed by horses. 
The extent of the Survey Site is shown in Figure 1 in Appendix 1 and is centred at National Grid 
Reference 265284, 201431. The nearest settlement is Felindre, which is located approximately 2 
km to the north of the Survey Site, with Swansea approximately 5 km to the south.    
2.3 
The Survey Site is largely agriculturally improved pasture with several areas of marshy grassland, 
particularly in the north, south and north-western ends of the Survey Site. The fields are bounded 
by fences, running along the line of defunct hedgerows, and often accompanied by ditches. There 
is a block of broadleaved woodland on the eastern boundary of the Survey Site and other areas of 
woodland around the marshy grassland to the west of the Survey Site, and around Felindre Gas 
Compressor Station and the two National Grid 400 kV electrical substations that lie at the south-
west end of the Survey Site. The habitats in the surrounding landscape are similar to those within 
the Survey Site boundary – a mixture of improved and marshy grassland interspersed with 
occasional patches of woodland. 
Description of Project 
2.4 
APL is promoting a new Power Generation Plant with associated Gas and Electricity Connections 
within Abergelli Farm.  The Power Generation Plant would operate as a Simple Cycle Gas Turbine 
(SCGT) peaking plant and would be designed to provide an electrical capacity of up to 299 
Megawatts (MW).  It would be fuelled by natural gas, supplied by a new underground gas pipeline 
connecting Power Generation Plant to the existing National Grid Gas (NGG) National Transmission 
System (NTS). It would also connect to the National Grid Electrical Transmission System (NETS) 
via underground cable or overhead lines. 
2.5 
BSG Ecology has been appointed as the ecological consultant to undertake an ecology survey, 
which incorporates a desk study and Extended Phase 1 Habitat Survey as well as a range of 
Phase 2 surveys, including a survey for invasive species.  The methods and results of baseline 
surveys will be provided as appendices to an ecology chapter of an Environmental Statement, 
which is intended for submission, in support of the application for Development Consent. 
Background to Survey 
2.6 
For the purposes of this survey, invasive plant species are defined as those species of non-native 
plants included in part II of Schedule 9 of the WCA 1981 (as amended).   
2.7 
Since its creation in 1981, part II of Schedule 9 of the WCA (as amended) 1981, pertaining to 
invasive plants, has undergone many revisions, to the extent that the original four species has now 
been expanded to include over 30 invasive plant species. 
2.8 
The Phase 1 survey of the Survey Site was carried out in three phases, in February 2014 and 
updated in April 2014, and July 2014.  The timing of the first two surveys during the winter and 
early spring meant that the presence of some of the Schedule 9 species was missed as the 
vegetative parts of the plants (growing above ground) can be absent during the colder months of 
the year, with the plant persisting, over winter, below ground as rhizomes or lying dormant in the 
seed bank.  Because of this it was recommended in the Phase 1 survey report that a dedicated 
invasive species survey should be undertaken within the main botanical survey season (May to 
September) to attempt to map the distribution and extent of Schedule 9 species within the Survey 
Site.

Aims of Study 
2.9 
The aim of the survey is to confirm the presence and identify the locations of species of plant 
included under Schedule 9 of the WCA (as amended) 1981.

Methods 
3.1 
No standard method exists for invasive plant species survey; and the survey was based on an 
ecological walkover survey approach, whereby all accessible areas of the Survey Site were walked 
by the surveyor in daylight hours, with a visual search for the target species undertaken.  
3.2 
Particular focus was also given to areas where the target species were most likely to be found, for 
example water courses, areas of disturbed ground and tracks where imported material may have 
been used or where fly-tipping or movements of vehicles or machinery could have led to the spread 
of these species.  
3.3 
Where found to be present, the species and location were recorded using a handheld GPS. The 
locations of individual plants, small clusters and large clusters of plants found during the walkover 
survey are provided in Figure 1. The locations are representative and do not necessarily provide 
mapping of the exact extent of each species or the precise location of each individual plant.  
Limitations of Study 
3.4 
The scale of the Survey Site and the presence of dense areas of scrub or woodland understorey in 
some areas mean that it is possible that small stands or individual plants of invasive species could 
have been missed during the walkover survey.  In addition, the presence of horses in some fields 
restricted access to some areas of the Survey Site although these areas were assessed using 
binoculars and it is likely, given the heavily grazed nature of these fields, that most invasive plant 
species would have been visible using binoculars. It is considered that the majority of the Survey 
Site was surveyed adequately and that overall the distribution of invasive species across the 
Survey Site has been mapped accurately.  
3.5 
The mapping produced in support of the report is based on point locations taken using a handheld 
GPS device which is subject to varying degrees of accuracy depending on satellite coverage and 
other factors.  Further to this the GPS locations recorded were for the main aggregation of each 
plant species at each location.   Each point therefore does not represent full coverage of the 
species at each point.  Any invasive plant management plan should take account of this with up to 
date, detailed surveying by a qualified land surveyor undertaken to provide accurate extents of 
species coverage. The distribution of each invasive plant species will, inevitably, change from year 
to year to a greater or lesser extent and these locations should be re-checked as necessary.

Results 
4.1 
Five species of plant included on Part II of Schedule 9 of the WCA 1981 were recorded during the 
survey: Japanese knotweed; Himalayan balsam; rhododendron; floating pennywort; and 
montbretia.  The locations and extents of these species are shown on Figure 1. 
4.2 
The most frequently recorded species were Japanese knotweed and Himalayan balsam.   
4.3 
Japanese knotweed was found to be strongly associated with roads and trackways on the Survey 
Site as well as the area of inert landfill in the north-west half of the Survey Site.  This perennial 
species is typically spread through the movement of contaminated soils or through spreading of 
vegetative parts through flailing of hedges or movement of other machinery. 
4.4 
Himalayan balsam is an annual plant that is typically found in wetter habitats, although it will 
tolerate drier conditions.  It is strongly associated with woodland, stream corridors and ditches 
across the Survey Site. 
4.5 
Rhododendron is restricted to woodlands with a small patch occurring in the marshy grassland 
area in the north-west of the Survey Site.  Montbretia was recorded in two locations alongside 
roads, which is a typical location for this species to be found in given that it is often spread from the 
fly tipping of garden waste. 
4.6 
Floating pennywort was found in one of the Survey Site ponds in the south-east of the Survey 
Site2.

APPENDIX 8.12 - SPECIES SPECIFIC LEGISLATION
1.1
Badgers
1.1.1
Badgers are protected under the Protection of Badgers Act (1992) on
animal welfare grounds rather than nature conservation value.  It is an
offence to wilfully take, kill, injure or ill-treat a badger, or possess a
dead badger or any part of a badger.  Under the Act their setts are also
protected against obstruction, destruction or damage.
1.2
Otters
1.2.1
Otters are fully protected under Schedule 2 of the Habitats Regulations
which define “European protected species of animals” and also receive
partial protection under the WCA.
1.2.2
Taken together the Act and Regulations make it illegal to: deliberately
kill, injure, capture, disturb otters (whether in a resting place or not);
damage, destroy or obstruct access to a resting place used by an otter;
possess or transport an otter or any part of an otter, unless acquired
legally; sell, barter or exchange or advertise for such purposes an otter
1.2.3
Activities that could result in impacts on otters should be modified to
avoid/minimise the likelihood of an impact occurring in the first
instance.  If impacts are unavoidable then the works may need to be
carried out under a European Protected Species development licence,
granted under the Habitats Regulations.
1.2.4
Otters are also a Species of Principal Importance in Wales as identified
under Section 42 of the NERC Act 2006.
1.3
Water voles
1.3.1
Water voles are fully protected under the WCA.  It is an offence to
possess, control or sell water voles or to intentionally or recklessly kill,
injure or take water voles.  It is also an offence to intentionally or
recklessly damage, destroy or obstruct access to a place that water
voles use for shelter or protection or disturb water voles whilst using
such a place.  No licensing regime exists for development activities that
may result in an infringement of the legislation.
1.3.2
Current guidance from NRW states that where development activities
may result in unavoidable impacts on water voles, developers will need
to be confident that their activities are “the incidental result of an
otherwise lawful operation”, and that all steps that could reasonably be
taken to avoid, minimise, mitigate and (if necessary) compensate for
impacts have been taken.
- 2 -
1.4
Dormice
1.4.1
Dormice are protected under the WCA (in respect of section 9(4)(b)
and (c) and (5) only) and are listed in Schedule 2 of the Habitats
Regulations.  Under the current legislation it is illegal to intentionally or
deliberately kill, injure or capture dormice, deliberately disturb dormice
(whether in a nest or not); or to damage, or destroy dormouse breeding
sites or resting places.
1.4.2
Any activity that would result in a contravention of the above legislation
would likely require a European Protected Species (EPS) licence from
the relevant statutory body (NRW).
1.5
Bats
1.5.1
All native UK bat species are protected by UK law under Schedule 5
and 6 of the WCA, and under Schedule 2 of the Habitats Regulations.
It is illegal to deliberately capture, injure or kill a bat or to intentionally or
recklessly disturb bats.  It is also illegal to damage, destroy or
intentionally or recklessly obstruct access to a breeding or resting place
used by a bat.  Under Part 2 of the Habitats Regulations, SACs can be
designated to further protect barbastelle (Barbastella barbastellus),
Bechstein’s (Myotis bechsteinii), lesser horseshoe (Rhinolophus
hipposideros) and greater horseshoe bats (Rhinolophus
ferrumequinum).
1.5.2
Several species of bats are listed under Section 42 of the NERC Act
2006 as Species of Principal Importance.  Species include the greater
horseshoe bat, lesser horseshoe bat, barbastelle, common pipistrelle
(Pipistrellus pipistrellus), soprano pipistrelle (Pipistrellus pygmaeus),
noctule (Nyctalus noctula), Bechstein’s bat and brown long-eared bat
(Plecotus auritus).  Furthermore, five bat species (common pipistrelle,
barbastelle, Bechstein’s bat, greater horseshoe bat, lesser horseshoe
bat) are listed as priority species in the Swansea BAP.
1.6
Breeding birds
1.6.1
All birds, their nests and eggs are protected by the WCA.  It is an
offence to intentionally kill, injure, or take any wild bird, or take or
destroy an egg of any wild bird.  It is also an offence to damage or
destroy the nest of any wild bird (whilst being built, or in use).
1.6.2
Birds listed under Schedule 1 of the WCA are afforded additional
protection with regard to intentional or reckless disturbance while nest
building, or at a nest containing eggs or young, and disturbance of the
dependent young of such a bird is also an offence away from the nest.
- 3 -
1.7
Great crested newts
1.7.1
GCN are fully protected under Schedule 2 of the Habitats Regulations,
and receive partial protection under the WCA Schedule 5.  It is illegal to
deliberately capture, injure or kill GCN, to intentionally disturb GCN or
to otherwise disturb them in their place of shelter, or to deliberately take
or destroy the eggs of GCN.  It is also illegal to damage, destroy or
intentionally or recklessly obstruct access to a breeding site or resting
place used by GCN.  All life stages of GCN are afforded the same level
of protection.  The legislation also makes it an offence to possess,
transport, sell or exchange, or offer to sell or exchange GCN.
1.8
Reptiles
1.8.1
The four common reptile species, adder, grass snake (Natrix natrix),
common lizard and slow worm, are protected under Schedule 5 of the
Wildlife and Countryside Act (1981, as amended) against intentional
killing, injuring and trade.  All species of reptile are listed as Species of
Principal Importance in Wales.
1.8.2
The natural range of the rarer species (smooth snake (Coronella
austriaca) and sand lizard (Lacerta agilis) does not include this part of
South Wales, and thus they are not considered further in this
assessment.  Sand lizard is listed as priority species under the
Swansea BAP (coastal areas).
1.9
Terrestrial and Aquatic Invertebrates
1.9.1
The WCA lists around 70 invertebrate species on Schedule 5 with
various levels of protection according to the rarity of the species.
Species with full protection under the Act include the marsh fritillary
butterfly, southern damselfly, mole cricket, fairy shrimp, medicinal leech
and freshwater pearl mussel, amongst many others.  Three
invertebrate species are protected under the Conservation of Habitats
and Species Regulations (2010, as amended) large blue butterflies,
Fisher's estuarine moths and little whirlpool ramshorn snails.  Section
42 of the NERC Act (2006) also lists several invertebrate species as
species of principal importance in Wales.

Hedgerow Survey Report 
1.1 
Introduction 
1.1.1 
AECOM was commissioned to undertake a suite of ecological survey work to 
inform the Abergelli Power Project (the “Project”), and support the Environmental 
Statement (ES).  
1.1.2 
The Project Site is located near to the village of Felindre, Swansea, as shown in 
Figure 1, and the central grid reference for the Project Site is SN65280143. A full 
description of the development is provided in ES Chapter 3 (Project and Site 
Description).  
1.1.3 
The Preliminary Ecological Appraisal (PEA) Report (ES Appendix 8.1) identified 
that a hedgerow survey, in accordance with the Hedgerow Regulations, 1997, was 
required at the Project Site.  
1.1.4 
This report describes the status of hedgerows within the Project Site, makes an 
assessment of potential effects and provides recommendations for further work and 
mitigation.  
1.1.5 
The survey was undertaken on all hedgerows within the Project Site, as shown on 
Figure 1.  
a) Objectives of the Study 
1.1.6 
The objectives of this study were: 


1.2 
Background to the Protection of Hedgerows 
1.2.1 
The Defra Hedgerow Survey Handbook (2007) defines a hedgerow as 'any 
boundary line of trees or shrubs over 20 m long and less than 5 m wide at the base, 
provided that at one time the trees or shrubs were more or less continuous. It 
includes an earth bank or wall only where such a feature occurs in association with 
a line of trees or shrubs. This includes 'classic' shrubby hedgerows, lines of trees, 
shrubby hedgerows with trees and very gappy hedgerows (where each shrubby 
section may be less than 20 m long, but the gaps are less than 20 m)'.  
1.2.2 
Hedgerows are a defining character of the landscape and are important for 
agriculture, archaeology, ecology and culture (Defra, 2007). They assist in 
preventing soil erosion and water run-off, controlling livestock and providing shelter, 
but also are an important habitat for many globally threatened and rapidly declining 
species (Defra, 2007).  
1.3 
Legislation and Policy 
1.3.1 
Several statutes relate to the protection of hedgerows and are summarised in Table 
1.1 below.  
Table 1.1: Legislation relating to Hedgerows 
Legislation/Policy 
Description 
Hedgerow 
Regulations 1997 
The Hedgerow Regulations (1997) make provision for the 
protection of important hedgerows in England and Wales. The 
regulations affect hedgerows which are 20 m or more in length, or 
connected at both ends to another hedgerow of any length. 
They relate to hedgerows which are on, or adjoining land used for 
the following purposes: agriculture or forestry; the breeding or 
keeping of horses, ponies or donkeys; common land; village 
greens; and SSSIs (they do not include hedges that are attached 
to, or marking the boundaries of a private house). 
It is an offence to intentionally or recklessly remove or cause or 
permit another person to remove a hedgerow or intentionally or 
recklessly remove, or cause or permit another person to remove, a 
hedgerow which is the subject of a hedgerow retention notice.  
The Wildlife and 
Countryside Act 
1981 (as amended) 
The Wildlife and Countryside Act 1981 (as amended) is the 
principal mechanism for the legislative protection of wildlife in 
Great Britain. This legislation is the means by which the 
Convention on the Conservation of European Wildlife and Natural 
Habitats (Bern Convention) and (partially) the Birds Directive and 
the Habitats Directive are implemented in the UK.  The 
Countryside and Rights of Way Act 2000 has strengthened this 
legal protection (see below).  
Convention on 
Biological Diversity 
and the Countryside 
and Rights of Way 
Act 2000 
The Countryside and Rights of Way Act 2000 provides a statutory 
framework for biodiversity conservation.  The Act places a duty on 
Government Departments and the National Assembly for Wales to 
have regard for the conservation of biodiversity and maintain lists 
of species and habitats for which conservation steps should be 
taken or promoted, in accordance with the Convention on

Legislation/Policy 
Description 
Biological Diversity. 
Schedule 9 of the Act amends SSSI provisions of the Wildlife and 
Countryside Act 1981, including provisions to change SSSIs and 
providing increased powers for their protection and management. 
The provisions extend powers for entering into management 
agreements; place a duty on public bodies to further the 
conservation and enhancement of SSSIs; increases penalties on 
conviction where the provisions are breached; and introduce a new 
offence whereby third parties can be convicted for damaging 
SSSIs.   
Schedule 12 of the Act amends the species provisions of the 
Wildlife and Countryside Act 1981, strengthening the legal 
protection for threatened species. The provisions make certain 
offences 'arrestable' and create a new offence of reckless 
disturbance.  
The UK Biodiversity Action Plan (BAP) was published in 1994, and 
was the UK Government’s response to the Convention on 
Biological Diversity (CBD), which the UK signed up to in 1992. It 
provides the framework for fulfilling the UK’s responsibilities 
towards the Convention on Biological Diversity.  Conservation of 
biodiversity (the variety of life on earth) is an essential element of 
sustainable development.  
Environment 
(Wales) Act 2016 
The Environment (Wales) Act puts in place the legislation needed 
to plan and manage Wales’ natural resources in a more proactive, 
sustainable and joined-up way.  Part 1 relates to the sustainable 
management of natural resources.  This ensures that the way in 
which the use of and the impacts on natural resources do not 
result in long term decline.  The aim is to sustainably manage 
natural resources in a way and rate that meets the needs of 
present and current generations without compromising the needs 
of future generations.  
The Act also contains at Section 7, a duty for the Welsh Ministers 
to prepare and publish a list of the living organisms and types of 
habitat which in their opinion are of principal importance for the 
purpose of maintaining and enhancing biodiversity in relation to 
Wales.

1.3.2 
This is a brief summary of the legislation and is not to be regarded as a definitive 
legal opinion. When dealing with individual cases, the client is advised to consult 
the full texts of the relevant legislation and obtain further legal advice. 
a) The Hedgerow Regulations 1997 
1.3.3 
The Hedgerow Regulations 1997 (HM Government, 1997) provide a series of 
comprehensive assessments to identify 'Important' hedgerows. To qualify as 
'Important' under the Regulations, the hedgerow must comply with the following list 
of criteria: 
 
It must have a continuous length of or exceeding 20 m; 
 
Has a continuous length of less than 20 m, but meets another hedgerow (by 
intersection or junction) at each end; and 
 
It must be more than 30 years old. 
1.3.4 
In addition to the above criteria, to be deemed 'Important', a hedgerow must meet 
one or more of the following criteria: 
i. 
Archaeological  
 
Marks a pre-1850 parish or township boundary; 
 
Incorporates an archaeological feature;  
 
Is part of or is associated with an archaeological site;  
 
Marks the boundary of, or is associated with, a pre-1600 estate or manor; or 
 
Forms an integral part of the a pre-Parliamentary enclosure field system. 
ii. Ecological  
 
Contains certain categories of species of birds, animals or plants listed in the  
Wildlife and Countryside Act 1981 (as amended) or Joint Nature Conservation 
Committee publications (JNCC); 
 
Includes: 
o at least seven woody species; on average, in a 30 m length; or 
o at least six woody species; on average, in a 30 m length and has at least 
three associated features (see list below); or 
o at least six woody species, on average, in a 30 m length, including a black 
poplar; large-leaved lime, small-leaved lime or wild service tree; or 
o at least five woody species, on average, in a 30 m length and has at least 
four of the associated features listed below; 
o at least 4 woody species, on average, in a 30 m length; is adjacent to a 
bridleway, footpath, road used a public path, or a byway open to all traffic 
and includes and has at least two or more of the associated features listed 
below.  
Associated Features 
 
A bank or wall for at least half the length of the hedgerow; 
 
Less than 10% gaps; 
 
On average, at least one standard tree per 50 m of hedgerow; 
 
A ditch for at least half the length of the hedgerow; 
 
At least three woodland species from a list of 57 woodland plants (as defined in 
Schedule 2 of the Regulations) within 1 m of the hedgerow;

 
Connections scoring four or more points, where connection with a hedgerow 
counts as one, a broad-leaved woodland or pond counts as two;  
 
A parallel hedgerow within 15 m.  
1.3.5 
The hedgerow surveys conducted as described in this report only assess 
hedgerows present with the Project Site against the Ecological Criteria as listed 
above.  Archaeology Criteria of Hedgerow Regulations 1997, 'Important 
Hedgerows' have not been considered.  
1.4 
Hedgerow Removal 
1.4.1 
If under the Hedgerow Regulations 1997 the hedgerow is not 'Important', the Local 
Planning Authority (LPA) cannot refuse permission to remove the hedgerow. If the 
hedgerow is ‘Important’, the LPA will decide if the circumstances justify removal of 
an 'Important' hedgerow. Unless satisfied that removal is justified, the LPA must 
refuse permission and issue a hedgerow retention licence.  
1.4.2 
However, under The Hedgerow Regulations 1997, the removal of any hedgerow to 
which the Regulations apply is permitted if it is required for carrying out 
development for which planning permission has been granted. Therefore, it may 
not be necessary to have to seek permission specifically to remove the hedgerow.  
1.5 
Quality Assurance 
1.5.1 
This survey and subsequent report was undertaken in line with AECOM’s 
Integrated Management System (IMS). Our IMS places great emphasis on 
professionalism, technical excellence, quality, environmental and Health and Safety 
management. All staff members are committed to establishing and maintaining our 
certification to the international standards BS EN ISO 9001:2015 and 14001:2004 
and BS OHSAS 18001:2007.  In addition, our IMS requires careful selection and 
monitoring of the performance of all sub-consultants and contractors.  
1.5.2 
All AECOM Ecologists who worked on this project are members of (at the 
appropriate level) the Chartered Institute of Ecology and Environmental 
Management (CIEEM) and follow their code of professional conduct (CIEEM, 2017) 
when undertaking ecological work.  
1.6 
Hedgerow Survey Methodology 
a) Initial Scope Assessment 
1.6.1 
The scope of the hedgerow survey work was informed by the PEA which was 
conducted in 2017 (ES Appendix 8.1).  Field boundaries were mapped in 
accordance with the JNCC (2010) Phase 1 habitat codes; including the mapping of 
boundaries as species rich or species poor; defunct and intact hedgerows (with or 
without trees).

b) Field Survey  
1.6.2 
Hedgerows which were located within the Project Site were surveyed in April 2018.  
1.6.3 
Hedgerow surveys were undertaken paying due regard to the methodology as 
outlined in the Hedgerow Survey Handbook (Defra, 2007). A set of parameters 
were recorded for each hedgerow covering hedgerow type, connections, 
characteristics (length, height, width), shape, associated features, integrity, trees, 
non-native species, woody species, ground flora species and hedgerow 
management.  
1.6.4 
As per the Hedgerow Regulation 1997, where lengths of hedgerows were between 
100 m and 200 m two 30 m sections were surveyed and the totals of the woody 
and woodland ground flora plants were averaged.  
1.6.5 
The field survey collated information to assess the Ecological Criteria of the 
Hedgerow Regulations 1997. A photograph of each hedgerow surveyed was taken 
and the extent of the hedgerow was marked onto field survey plans.  
c) Hedgerow Assessment – Ecological Criteria 
1.6.6 
The ecological data gained during the field survey was assessed against the 
Ecological Criteria of the Hedgerow Regulations 1997 to ascertain which of the 
hedgerows could be classified as ‘Important’.  
d) Archaeological Desk Study – Archaeological Criteria 
1.6.7 
No assessment of the archaeological importance of the hedgerows was made as 
part of this Important hedgerow assessment.  
1.7 
Survey Limitations 
1.7.1 
Whilst the hedgerow survey was not undertaken at the most optimal time of the 
year (optimal survey period is May and June), all woody species and associated 
features were easily identifiable and due to some early season warm weather the 
woodland ground flora was present at the time of survey.  
1.7.2 
It was not possible to access the land in which Hedgerow C was located. As such 
the survey was conducted from a gateway next to the hedgerow to the south using 
binoculars. It was not possible to record the woodland ground flora; however, the 
hedgerow supported a sufficient number of woody species to classify it as an 
‘Important’ hedgerow without relying on the woodland ground flora.  
1.7.3 
There are deemed to be no significant limitations to the hedgerow survey.

1.9 
Hedgerow Survey Conclusions  
1.9.1 
Three hedgerows were present within the Project Site and were scoped in for 
requiring an Important hedgerow survey during the PEA. Three hedgerows were 
assessed under Ecological Criteria (Hedgerow Regulations, 1997).  
1.9.2 
Two of the three hedgerows within the Project Site fulfil the Ecological Criteria for 
being ‘Important’ under the Hedgerow Regulations (1997).  
1.10 
Potential Effects  
1.10.1 ‘Important’ hedgerows will be partially removed. Hedgerow A will be severed to 
facilitate the construction of a Gas Connection and Hedgerow B will be partially 
removed to facilitate the widening of a section of the Access Road.  
1.11 
Recommendations 
1.11.1 If planning permission is granted then the hedgerows classified as ‘Important’ can 
be removed without further permission (Hedgerows A and C, as shown on Figure 
1).  
1.11.2 New species rich hedgerow planting is proposed as well as reinstatement of any 
hedgerow removed during construction of the Project. Further details are provided 
in the Outline Landscape and Ecology Mitigation Strategy (ES Appendix 3.4).  
1.11.3 Indicative typical species will include the following: 
 Acer campestre (field maple);  
 Corylus avellana (hazel); 
 Crataegus monogyna (hawthorn); 
 Rosa canina (dog rose); 
 Viburnum opulus (guelder rose); 
 Prunus spinosa (blackthorn);  
 Sorbus aucuparia (rowan);  
 Ilex aquifolium (holly); and, 
 Lonicera periclymenum (honeysuckle).

Executive Summary 
1.1.1 
This report presents the findings of a Flood Consequence Assessment (FCA) undertaken by 
AECOM Limited on behalf of Abergelli Power Limited. This FCA has been prepared to 
inform and support the Development Consent Order (DCO) application for a new Open 
Cycle Gas Turbine (OCGT) peaking power generating station, Electrical Connection and 
Gas Connection north of Swansea, Wales. 
1.1.2 
The Project will be located within the largely undeveloped rural site approximately 3km to 
the north of the city of Swansea, approximately 1 km southeast of Felindre and to the east of 
the existing Felindre Compressor Gas Station. The Project Site extends to approximately 
30.8 hectares (ha). 
1.1.3 
The Project Site is located within the Afon Llan catchment and is bounded and crossed by a 
series of small watercourses/drainage ditches which are fed by issues and springs 
throughout the catchment. All watercourses discharge into the Afon Llan at the southern 
reaches perimeter of the Project Site. The Afon Llan links with the Afon Lliw and the River 
Loughor, which discharges into Carmarthen Bay.  
1.1.4 
This FCA has been prepared following consultation with Natural Resources Wales (NRW) 
and City and Council of Swansea (CCS) and conforms to the requirements of ‘Technical 
Advice Note 15 (TAN15): Development and Flood Risk’ (July 2004) and the Welsh 
Government’s accompanying Development Advice Maps (DAMs). NRW fluvial and surface 
water flood maps have been used to inform the assessment of flood risk.  
1.1.5 
The Project is considered ‘Highly Vulnerable’ under the development criteria in TAN15. A 
review of the DAMs shows that a small area of the Generating Equipment Site is located 
within DAM Zone B. A small area at the southern boundary of the Project Site is within DAM 
Zone C2 however no building, development or construction activities are proposed within 
this area. The majority of the Project Site is located within DAM Zone A and is considered 
acceptable for development.  
1.1.6 
TAN15 requires that all potential flood sources that could affect the developable areas of the 
Project Site be considered. An initial assessment of flood risk to and from the Project Site 
from all sources shows: 
 
There is no risk of tidal flooding;  
 
The risk of fluvial flooding is considered to be negligible from Afon Llan and low from 
ordinary watercourses/land drainage to small areas of the Generating Equipment Site 
and Access Road;  
 
The risk of surface water flooding is considered to be medium to high for small areas of 
the Generating Equipment Site, Access Road and Gas Connection however the 
majority of the site is considered to be at low risk;  
 
The risk of sewer flooding is considered to be negligible;  
 
The risk of groundwater flooding is considered to be low; and 
 
There is no risk of flooding from artificial sources.

1.1.7 
TAN15 requires taking into account the potential impact of climate change over the lifetime 
of the development to ensure a safe and secure living and/or working environment. 
Following consultation with CCS it was agreed that a 1% Annual Exceedance Probability 
(AEP) +20% Climate Change allowance was used to assess the flood attenuation 
requirements. 
1.1.8 
It was identified the main flood risk to the Project Site is from surface water runoff and fluvial 
flooding from ordinary watercourse in small areas of the Generating Equipment Site. 
Therefore an Outline Drainage Strategy (Appendix E) has been prepared to manage surface 
water at the Project Site and flood mitigation measures have been proposed to reduce flood 
risk to and from the Project Site.  
1.1.9 
During construction works a Construction Environment Management Plan (CEMP) will 
incorporate measures to prevent an increase in flooding. It is expected that this will include 
new temporary and/or permanent drainage ditches, silt traps, settlement lagoons and 
monitoring of flow routes along the eastern perimeter of the Project Site. 
1.1.10 
During operation flood mitigation measures have been proposed that include raised ground 
and finished floor levels, permanent cut off ditches, maintenance of overland flow routes 
across the whole Project Site and particularly at the eastern extent of the Generating 
Equipment Site, an easement to the existing Welsh Water Water Main that traverses the 
Generating Equipment Site, suitably sized culverts beneath the Access Road and safe 
access and egress routes for all site workers. 
1.1.11 
The Outline Drainage Strategy (Appendix E) outlines the implementation of SuDS methods 
including swales and attenuation storage to manage surface water on and off the Project 
Site. Prior to a Ground Investigation it is assumed that the possibility of infiltration will be 
limited. Therefore to mitigate the increase in impermeable area due to the Project, flood 
attenuation storage areas for the Generating Equipment Site, Access Road Maintenance 
Compound and Above Ground Installation (AGI) are proposed to attenuate and release 
surface water to local watercourses at the existing greenfield runoff rates up to and including 
the 1% AEP + 20% Climate Change event.   
1.1.12 
The Project may have some impact on flood flows and flood storage associated with the 
local watercourse at the south eastern extent of the Generating Equipment Site where 
raising of ground levels are proposed. The impact on flood storage and conveyance will be 
mitigated by the formalisation of an overland flow route along the eastern extent of the 
Generating Equipment Site. With the formalisation of the overland flow path it is anticipated 
that, combined with the steep catchment, any loss of storage and impact on conveyance will 
be minimal. Minor changes to the flood routes within the rural area are not considered to 
increase flood risk to third parties.  
1.1.13 
Through implementation of mitigation measures outlined in this document and in the outline 
drainage design it is considered by AECOM that this development is acceptable under 
TAN15 guidance.

Introduction 
2.1 
Background 
2.1.1 
This report presents the findings of a Flood Consequence Assessment (FCA) undertaken by 
AECOM Limited on behalf of Abergelli Power Limited. This FCA has been prepared to 
inform and support the Development Consent Order (DCO) application for a new Open 
Cycle Gas Turbine (OCGT) peaking power generating station, Electrical Connection and 
Gas Connection north of Swansea, Wales.    
2.2 
The Project 
2.2.1 
The Project comprises an OCGT peaking power generating station, fuelled by natural gas 
and capable of providing a rated electrical output of up to 299 Megawatts (MW), a new 
Access Road to the Generating Equipment Site, a new Gas Connection to bring natural gas 
to the Generating Equipment site from the National Transmission System and a new 
Electrical Connection to export power from the Generating Equipment to the National Grid 
Electricity Transmission System (NETS).   
2.2.2 
The Project will be located within the largely undeveloped rural site approximately 3 km to 
the north of Swansea (Appendix A, Figure A1) and will extend across an area of 
approximately 30.8 hectares (ha).  
2.3 
The Purpose and Structure of this Document 
2.3.1 
According to TAN 151, highly vulnerable development (i.e. a power station) is not permitted 
within Development Advice Map (DAM) Zone C2 (Section 5). They are, however, acceptable 
in DAM Zone A and DAM Zone B where fluvial / tidal flooding is considered to be less of an 
issue. In the Section 42 consultation response, NRW requested that an FCA was 
undertaken. This was to assess the potential flood consequences associated with the Afon 
Llan and ordinary watercourses to and from the Project. A FCA has therefore been 
undertaken to determine the risks of flooding that could result from the Project and 
subsequent appropriate flood risk mitigation measures required.  
2.3.2 
The aim of the FCA is to assess flood consequences to and from the Project. Where 
appropriate, mitigation measures have been identified to manage flood consequences in line 
with planning guidance in order to support the DCO application for elements of the Project. 
In order to meet this aim the following scope of the FCA was undertaken:  
 
Collection and review of existing flood risk data including topographic data, surface 
water drainage, Natural Resources Wales information (Appendix C), development 
plans and CCS Flood Risk Management Plan;  
 
Assessment and interpretation of available information to identify potential sources of 
flood risk including groundwater, surface water and infrastructure failure; and,  
 
Review of the Project design in light of the identified flood risks and identification of 
measures, where necessary, that would manage any residual flood risk to the Project 
Site to acceptable levels.

Site Visit and Consultation 
2.5.1 
A site visit was undertaken on 8th November 2017 to assess the local topography and local 
drainage network. Observations made during this site visit have been used to inform this 
FCA.    
2.5.2 
Consultation with respect to the requirements of this FCA has been undertaken with the 
following key stakeholders between September and November 2017: 
 
NRW; and 
 
CCS 
2.5.3 
Consultation with Dŵr Cymru Welsh Water was undertaken in 2014 during the scoping 
process. Further consultation is expected during the DCO consultation process during 2018. 
Information provided by Dŵr Cymru Welsh Water regarding the capacity of the Water Main 
through the Project Site is considered to be current and up to date as no major upgrade has 
taken place within the intervening period. In addition, further investigations are ongoing to 
determine the location and depth of the Water Main and these will be provided in the DCO 
Application. However these investigations are not expected to influence the conclusion of 
the FCA.

Project Site and Surrounding Area 
3.1 
Existing Site 
3.1.1 
The Project Site (red outline in Figure A1, Appendix A) is located on predominately open 
agricultural land approximately 2 km north of Junction 46 on the M4, approximately 3 km to 
the north of Swansea, approximately 1km southeast of Felindre and 1.4 km north of 
Llangyfelach 
3.1.2 
The Project Site area is approximately 30.8 ha (Figure A2, Appendix A).   
3.2 
Topography 
3.2.1 
Ground levels at the Project Site vary from approximately 146 m AOD at the highest point in 
the north-west corner at Rhyd-y-pandy Road to approximately 80 m AOD along the southern 
perimeter, with ground levels generally falling in a southerly and south easterly direction. 
The land within the Generating Equipment Site is at approximately 90 m AOD (Figure B1, 
Appendix B). 
3.2.2 
The Felindre Gas Compressor Station located to the north of the new section of the Access 
Road is built upon raised ground at a level of approximately 87 m AOD. This is between 5-8 
m above the ordinary watercourse to the south. 
3.3 
Local Water Features 
3.3.1 
Figure B2 (Appendix B) shows the main local water features in the vicinity of the Project 
Site. A more detailed description of the local drainage network within each area of the 
Project Site can be found in Figure B3 Appendix B. 
3.3.2 
The Project Site is bound and crossed by a series of small watercourses/drainage ditches 
which are fed by issues and springs throughout the catchment. All watercourses discharge 
into the Afon Llan at the southern perimeter of the Project Site. The Afon Llan links with the 
Afon Lliw and the River Loughor, which discharges into Carmarthen Bay.  
Main River 
3.3.3 
The Afon Llan flows in a south westerly direction along the southern perimeter of the Project 
Site. This watercourse is designated Main River and falls under the jurisdiction of NRW. 
Observations from the site visit show that the watercourse is approximately 4-5 m wide at 
the top of bank and 0.8-1.0 m deep from channel bottom to top of bank along the southern 
boundary of the Project Site. The water depth of the Afon Llan on the day of the site was 
estimated to be approximately 0.3 m deep.  
3.3.4 
The Afon Llan floodplain consists of arable and pasture fields. The Generating Equipment 
Site is located approximately 300 m to the north of the watercourse and approximately 6 m 
above the bank level of Afon Llan.

Ordinary Watercourses 
3.3.5 
A series of ordinary watercourses drain into the Afon Llan at the southern perimeter of the 
Project Site. An ordinary watercourse is a watercourse that is not designated as ‘Main River’ 
and can include rivers, streams, ditches, drains cuts, culverts, dikes sluices, sewers through 
which water passes.  The largest of the ordinary watercourses flows in a southerly direction 
(Figure B3, Appendix B) along the east perimeter of the Project Site (Stream A). 
Observations made during the November 2017 site visit estimate that Stream A has a 
channel width of approximately 1.5-2.0 m at the top of bank and is approximately 1.0 m high 
from the channel bed to top of bank. A water depth of approximately 0.3 m was observed on 
the site visit. 
3.3.6 
Stream A has a relatively steep gradient from the north east of the Generating Equipment 
Site down to the Afon Llan floodplain as it falls from approximately 89 m AOD to 76 m AOD 
across 620 m (gradient of approximately 1 in 50) which is considered to be relatively steep 
for a watercourse.  
3.3.7 
A second ordinary watercourse (Stream B)  flows south-westerly along the eastern boundary 
of the Felindre Gas Compressor Station  and crosses the proposed Access Road before 
entering the Afon Llan approximately 0.9 km to the south west (Figure B3, Appendix B). This 
watercourse has been diverted along existing field boundaries and site observations 
estimate the channel to be 1.5 m wide at the top of bank and 0.4-0.5 m high from the 
channel bed to the top of bank. A water depth of 0.3 m in Stream B was observed during the 
site visit. 
Land Drains and Drainage Ditches  
3.3.8 
A number of land drains and small drainage ditches cross the Project Site and outfall to the 
local watercourse network and eventually the Afon Llan. These primarily follow existing field 
boundaries and trackways and are generally ephemeral in nature. 
3.3.9 
A drainage ditch passes through the centre of the proposed Generating Equipment Site 
(Stream C) and outfalls into Stream A to the south east (Figure B2, Appendix B). This drains 
a small catchment area (approximately 0.1 km2) to the north of the Generating Equipment 
Site and during the site visit a water depth of 0.1 m was observed in the ditch.  
3.3.10 
A second drainage ditch flows across the proposed path of the Gas Connection to the north 
of the Generating Equipment Site (Steam D) and outfalls in to Stream A to the south east 
(Figure B2, Appendix B). The drainage ditch has been diverted and is approximately 1 m 
wide at the top of bank and 0.3 m high from the channel bed to top of bank. A very low flow 
was observed during the site visit with most of the flow coming from a small leaking 
waterpipe servicing the surrounding fields. The watercourse flows away from Abegelli Farm 
and Abergelli Solar Farm at the location of the proposed Gas Connection crossing.

Ponds and Other Sources    
3.3.11 
Two heavily vegetated ponds are located within the Generating Equipment Site. As a result 
of restricted access and high groundwater table, in the area the extent of these ponds could 
not be verified.       
3.3.12 
The Afon Lliw and Lower Lliw Reservoir are located approximately 2.1 km to the north of the 
Generating Equipment Site within a neighbouring topographic catchment.  As such neither 
reservoir is considered to be a flood risk to the Project Site and they are therefore not 
considered further in this report.   
3.3.13 
A series of surface water outfalls were noted from the Felindre Gas Compressor Station that 
flow into the aforementioned ordinary watercourse (Stream B).   
Existing Flood Defence Structures 
3.3.14 
There are no flood defence structures within the vicinity of the Project Site.  
3.4 
Geology and Soil  
3.4.1 
A review of the British Geological Survey (BGS) online mapping2 data indicates that the 
Project Site is underlain by bedrock of the Grovesend Formation, comprising mudstone, 
siltstone and sandstone (Figure B4, Appendix B). Superficial deposits across the Project 
Site are quite variable however the Generating Equipment Site is predominately underlain 
by Peat with the surrounding site comprising of mainly Till and Glaciofluvial sand and gravel 
deposits (Figure B5, Appendix B). No ground investigations to date have been undertaken to 
verify the depth of these superficial deposits.   
3.4.2 
The superficial glaciofluvial deposits and the bedrock geology are both classified as 
Secondary A Aquifers.  Secondary A Aquifers are defined as ‘permeable layers capable of 
supporting water supplies at a local rather than strategic scale, and in some cases forming 
an important source of base flow to rivers.’ 
3.4.3 
The superficial glacial till deposits are classed as Unproductive Strata,  defined as ‘rock 
layers or drift deposits with low permeability that have negligible significance for water 
supply or river base flow’. 
3.4.4 
The Landmark Envirocheck report (2017)3 has identified no groundwater abstraction 
licences associated with the Project Site. There is only one licence located within 100 m of 
the Project Site boundary, recorded 56 m to the north-east for a well at Abergelli Farm, 
licence number 22/59/4/0027 dated February 1993, for general farming and domestic use.  
3.4.5 
A review of the Cranfield University/National Soil Resources Institute Soilscapes website4 
has found that that there are two main soil types across the Project Site which indicates the 
following: 
 
The Generating Equipment Site and the AGI compound are characterised by slowly 
permeable soils with a peaty surface and are considered to have impeded drainage; 
and 
 
The rest of the Project Site is characterised by freely draining loamy soils.

3.4.6 
Observations made during the site visit in November 2017 support the slow permeability of 
the Generating Equipment Site where ponding of surface water was observed throughout. 
This would support the inference that there is limited potential for infiltration of surface water 
within the area.  
3.5 
Surrounding Area 
General 
3.5.1 
The area surrounding the Project Site is, at present, predominantly rural in character, 
although there is Felindre Park and Share facility to the south and a substantial amount of 
utility infrastructure in the area, some of which crosses the Project Site (see Figure B6, 
Appendix B). Most notable is the Water Water Main that traverses the site from the north 
west to south east (Section 3.5.3) and electricity pylons associated with the Substation. 
3.5.2 
Other features of the area include public footpaths, bridleways and tracks located in and 
around the Project Site, linking it to the wider area. 
Felindre Water Treatment Works 
3.5.3 
The Felindre Water Treatment Works is situated approximately 1.4 km to the north west of 
the Generating Equipment Site. A 1.68 m diameter Water Main flows in a south easterly 
direction through the Generating Equipment Site, generally following the line of the existing 
farm trackway (Figure B6, Appendix B). The pipeline is owned by Welsh Water who has 
advised that typically a 30 m easement (15 m either side of the pipeline) is required to be 
kept clear of construction. A 60 m easement has been shown on the layout due to 
uncertainty over the accuracy and digitisation of the archive drawings (Appendix C, C1,C2 
and C3). Further investigations into the location and depth of the Water Main are ongoing.  
Felindre Gas Compressor Station 
3.5.4 
The Access Road is bound to the north by the Felindre Gas Compressor Station and is 
approximately 400 m to the west of the Generating Equipment Site. The main site is at an 
elevation of approximately 87 m AOD and lies 5-8m above the fields to the south.    
3.5.5 
During the site visit it was observed that number of small cut-off ditches drain the perimeter 
of the Felindre Gas Compressor Station and outfall in to the drainage network to the south.  
Solar Farm 
3.5.6 
Cefn Betingau Solar Park and Abergelli Solar Farm are located to the east of Project Site. A 
further two Solar Farms are located in the vicinity at Rhyd-y-pandy and Abergelli Farm.

The Project 
4.1 
The Project 
4.1.1 
The Project comprises a OCGT peaking power generating station, fuelled by natural gas 
and capable of providing a rated electrical output of up to 299 Megawatts (MW), a new 
Access Road to the Generating Equipment Site, a new Gas Connection to bring natural gas 
to the Generating Equipment site from the National Transmission System and a new 
Electrical Connection to export power from the Generating Equipment to the National Grid 
Electricity Transmission System (NETS).   
4.1.2 
Figure C1 in Appendix C shows an overview of the key areas within the Project Site. A 
detailed view of each element can be found within Figure C2 in Appendix C.  
4.1.3 
The Project consists of the following elements:  
 
Power Generation Plant: An Open Cycle Gas Turbine (OCGT) peaking power 
generating station, fuelled by natural gas and capable of providing a rated electrical 
output of up to 299 Megawatts (MW). The Power Generation Plant comprises: 
 
Generating equipment including one Gas Turbine Generator with one exhaust gas 
flue stack and Balance of Plant (BOP) (together referred to as the ‘Generating 
Equipment’) which are located within the ‘Generating Equipment Site’; 
 
An Access Road to the Generating Equipment Site from the B4489 which lies to the 
west, formed by upgrading an existing access road between the B4489 junction and the 
Swansea North Substation (the Substation) and constructing a new section of access 
road from the Substation to the Generating Equipment Site; and 
 
A temporary construction compound for the storage of materials, plant and equipment 
as well as containing site accommodation and welfare facilities, temporary car parking 
and temporary fencing (the Laydown Area). There will be two Laydown areas and a 
small area within the southern Laydown Area will be retained permanently for the 
Maintenance Compound. 
 
Ecological Mitigation Area – area for potential reptile translocation and ecological 
enhancement.  
 
Permanent parking and drainage to include: a site foul, oily water and surface water 
drainage system.  
 
The Gas Connection will be in the form of a new above ground installation (AGI) and 
underground gas pipeline connection (the Pipeline). This is to bring natural gas to the 
Generating Equipment from the National Transmission System. The Pipeline will follow 
an approximate north-south route corridor, between the National Transmission System 
south of Rhyd-y-pandy Road and the Generating Equipment Site.  
 
Electrical Connection: This is an underground electrical cable to export power from 
the Generating Equipment to the National Grid Electricity Transmission System 
(NETS). The proposed route of the Electrical Connection will be alongside the Access 
Road.   
4.1.4 
The Project has a current design and operational life of 25 years. During this period, on-
going assessment of the condition of the electricity market and energy mix would be 
undertaken to assess whether to ‘re-power’ or decommission.

Policy Context 
5.1 
National Policy 
5.1.1 
Overarching National Policy Statement for Energy (NPS EN-1) 
5.1.2 
According to the policy5, an assessment of the existing baseline conditions regarding water 
quality, water resources and physical characteristics of the water environment is required 
where a proposed project is likely to have effects on the water environment. 
5.1.3 
The NPS EN – 1 also sets the requirement for additional pollution control measures that 
must be considered for all activities that discharge to the water environment and 
recommends that the Secretary of State (SoS) gives increased weight in its decision making 
to impacts on the water environment that would have an adverse effect on the achievement 
of the objectives of the WFD. 
5.1.4 
National Policy Statement for Gas Supply Infrastructure and Gas and Oil Pipelines (NPS EN 
– 4) 
5.1.5 
The NPS EN-46 Part 2 Section 2.22.2 recognises that “constructing pipelines creates 
corridors of surface clearance and excavation that can potentially affect watercourses, 
aquifers, water abstraction and discharge points, areas prone to flooding and ecological 
receptors. Pipeline impacts could include inadequate or excessive drainage, interference 
with groundwater flow pathways, mobilisation of contaminants already in the ground, the 
introduction of new pollutants, flooding, disturbance to water ecology, pollution due to silt 
from construction / demolition and disturbance to species and their habitats”. 
5.1.6 
The NPS EN-4 states that where the project is likely to have effects on water resources or 
water quality, an assessment of the impacts should be provided in line with Section 5.15 of 
EN-1. The SoS should be satisfied that the impacts on water quality and resources are 
acceptable in accordance with Section 5.15 of EN-1. 
National Policy Statement for Electricity Networks Infrastructure (NPS EN-5)  
5.1.7 
NPS EN-5 requires consideration of adaption to climate change particularly from the 
increased risk of flooding to the resilience of some of the sites infrastructure and should be 
covered in the FCA.  
Planning Policy Wales 2016 
5.1.8 
Planning Policy Wales 2016 is supplemented by TAN15 and incorporates sustainable 
development into the planning system which can be adhered to.  It requires every local 
planning authority to have produced a Local Development Plan (LDP) superseding the 
Unitary Development Plan (UDP).

TAN15 (2004) 
5.1.9 
TAN15 provides guidance which supplements the policy set out in Planning Policy Wales 
(PPW)7 in relation to development and flooding. A precautionary framework is set out which 
advises caution in respect of new development in areas at high risk of flooding and this is 
used as a guide for planning decisions. The overall aim of the precautionary framework is to 
direct new development away from those areas that have a high risk of flooding; and 
development will only be justified in these areas if it meets the criteria and tests specified in 
this guidance.  
5.1.10 
TAN15 also requires provision for future changes in flood risk are considered. Therefore the 
predicted future impacts of climate change should be accounted for within the FCA where 
they can be anticipated.  
5.1.11 
The operation of the precautionary framework is governed by DAMs made up of three zones 
(Table 5-1) which are used to trigger the appropriate planning test and definitions of 
vulnerable developments. The DAMs are based on the best available information 
considered adequate to determine when flood risk needs to be taken into consideration with 
future development.

5.1.12 
The precautionary framework identifies the vulnerability of different land uses to flooding, 
and classifies proposed uses accordingly as detailed in Table 5-2. This is because certain 
flooding consequences may not be acceptable for particular development types

Emergency Services 
Hospitals, ambulance stations, fire stations, police stations, 
coastguard stations, command centres, emergency depots and 
buildings used to provide emergency shelter in time of flood. 
High vulnerable development 
All residential premises (including hotels and caravan parks), public 
buildings (e.g. schools, libraries, leisure centres), especially 
vulnerable industrial development (e.g. power stations, chemical 
plants, incinerators), and waste disposal sites. 
Less vulnerable development 
General industrial, employment, commercial and retail development, 
transport and utilities infrastructure, car parks, mineral extraction 
sites and associated processing facilities, excluding waste disposal 
sites. 
5.1.13 
Table 5-2 highlights that a power station development is classified as ‘Highly Vulnerable’; 
Project Site is located within DAM Zone C2, Zone B and Zone A (Appendix D, D1).  
5.1.14 
According to TAN15 new development should be directed away from Zone C and towards 
more suitable land in Zone A, otherwise to Zone B, where river or tidal flooding will be less 
of an issue. In Zone C there are a number of tests that need to be applied for certain types 
of development, however highly vulnerable development (i.e. power generation) and 
Emergency Services should not be permitted in Zone C2. All other development should only 
be permitted within Zones C1 and C2 if determined by the planning authority to be justified 
in that location, satisfying the tests within the TAN 15 document. 
5.1.15 
As shown in Figure D1, Appendix D, there is a small area on the southern perimeter of the 
Project Site that lies within DAM Zone C2, and therefore is not suitable for highly vulnerable 
development. No development is proposed in this area.   
5.1.16 
A small portion of the south eastern corner of the Generating Equipment Site is located 
within DAM Zone B and the majority of the site is within DAM Zone A, which under TAN15 is 
considered appropriate for ‘highly vulnerable’ development as long as all sources of flood 
risk have been considered. This FCA addresses these risks with mitigation proposed where 
necessary.

Local Policy 
5.3.1 
Swansea City Council Unitary Development Plan (UDP) 2008 
5.3.2 
The CCS UDP was adopted on 10th November 2008 and it is stated on the CCS website 
that this is the most up to date Development Plan covering the authorities' administrative 
area and is used in the determination of planning applications. 
5.3.3 
Policy EV35: Surface water run-off, and Policy EV36: Development and Flood Risk, are the 
relevant policies in CCS Unitary Development Plan. Policy EV35 affects developments that 
will lead to additional surface water run-off or cause a reduction of the quality of surface 
water run-off, and encourages SuDS implementation wherever practical to counteract this. 
Policy EV36 only allows new development within flood risk areas if developers can justify 
the location by proving the flooding consequences associated with the development are 
acceptable. Until the adoption of the Local Development Plan this is considered the most up 
to date Development Plan covering the authorities' administrative area. 
5.3.4 
Swansea City Council Local Development Plan 2017 
5.3.5 
The Project Site is located entirely within the CCS and so must comply with local planning 
policy and strategy.  
5.3.6 
The council submitted the Swansea Local Development Plan 2010-2025 (the LDP) to the 
Ministers of the Welsh Government for independent examination on 28 July 2017. The Plan 
‘provides a clear planning framework to address key issues facing the County, providing 
certainty and the basis for efficient planning decisions. Its policies and proposals will enable 
the delivery of sustainable development, and ensure that social, economic, environmental 
and cultural well-being goals are all suitably balanced in the decision making process so that 
the right development occurs in the right place’ 
5.3.7 
The LDP adopts a sustainable approach to flood risk by avoiding vulnerable development 
occurring within flood hazard areas.  Policy RP4 Avoidance of Flood Risk states that 
development will not be permitted if it causes an increase to flooding on or off site. 
5.4 
Evidence Base 
5.4.1 
Strategic Flood Consequence Assessment 
5.4.2 
CCS developed a Level 1 Strategic Flood Consequence Assessment (SFCA)8 in 2010 that 
provides an overview of flood risk from all sources and provides developers and other 
interested parties with guidance on flood risk and issues associated with flooding.  
5.4.3 
The Level 1 SCFA does not identify any historic flooding within the vicinity of the Project Site 
or highlight any specific flood risk to the Project Site.   
5.4.4 
CCS developed a Level 2 SFCA9 in 2012 that provides a more detailed appraisal of flood 
risk to Local Development Plan Candidate Sites to assess their suitability.  
5.4.5 
The Felindre area, located to the west of the Project Site, is highlighted for Mixed Used 
Major Development and includes six land parcels for development consideration. The 
Project Site is located to the east of these land parcels and should be considered within 
context of this development.

Local Flood Risk Management Strategy 
5.4.6 
In 2013, CCS developed a Local Flood Risk Management Strategy (LFRMS)10, this 
document highlights the responsibilities of CCS as Lead Local Flood Authority (LLFA) with 
respect to flooding from surface water, ordinary watercourses and groundwater. This report 
also outlines the strategy objectives of CCS to manage flood risk. 
Flood Risk Management Plan 2015 
5.4.7 
CCS developed a Flood Risk Management Plan (FRMP)11 which provides an overview of 
the flood risk in Swansea and detailed objectives for reducing flood risk in community areas 
which have been identified as being at significant flood risk.  
5.4.8 
The Project Site is situated within the Mawr Community and is not located within a Flood 
Risk Area as described within the FRMP. Borough wide measures from the CCS Flood Risk 
Management Strategy apply and there are no specific requirements for the Project Site.

Sources of Flooding and Flood Risk 
6.1 
Overview 
6.1.1 
TAN15 requires that all potential flood sources that could affect the Project be considered. 
This chapter primarily focuses on the fluvial and surface water flood risk posed to the Project 
Site location, but also considers the flood risk posed to the Project Site from other sources. 
6.2 
Tidal 
6.2.1 
Tidal flood sources include both the sea and estuaries. The assessment of tidal flood risk 
takes into account the sites distance from the Severn Estuary (approximately 9 km) and 
minimum ground levels on site (approximately 75 m AOD). This assessment identifies that 
there is no tidal flood risk posed to the Project and is therefore not considered further within 
this FCA. 
6.3 
Fluvial 
6.3.1 
The Project Site is bound by Afon Llan (Main River) to the south and an unnamed 
watercourse (Stream A) to the east. A series of small watercourses and land drains cross 
the Project Site (Stream B and Stream C) with a number of issues and sinks present within 
the vicinity of the Project Site.  
Main River 
6.3.2 
The NRW DAM Maps12 (See Figure D1, Appendix D) identify that the majority of the Project 
Site is located within DAM Zone A (little or no risk of fluvial flooding) whilst a small proportion 
of the Generating Equipment Site is located within DAM Zone B (areas known to have 
flooded historically evidenced by sedimentary deposits). A small area of the southern portion 
of the Project Site is located within DAM Zone C2 (Areas of Zone C without significant flood 
defence infrastructure) and is associated with the Afon Llan floodplain. This part of the 
Project Site is a proposed water compatible Ecological Mitigation Area (Figure C1, Appendix 
C) and is therefore not considered to be affected by or impact upon the floodplain.   
6.3.3 
A review of the NRW Fluvial Flood Map (Figure D2, Appendix D) indicates that the area 
south of the Generating Equipment Site is located within Flood Zone 3 (the extent of a flood 
from rivers with a 1% (1 in 100) chance or greater of happening in any given year) and 
coincides with the DAM Zone C2 extent. The majority of the Project Site is located within 
Flood Zone 1 with negligible risk of flooding from rivers (Figure D2, Appendix D).  
6.3.4 
The CCS Level 1 SCFA and Level 2 SFCA indicate that there has been no recorded 
historical fluvial flooding within the Project Site or within 1km of the Project Site. Further 
consultation with NRW and CCS shows that there has been no recorded flooding from 
fluvial sources on or near the Project Site since the production of the SFCAs.  
6.3.5 
Modelled river levels for the Project Site and surrounding area were requested from NRW, 
however it was stated that a “1D Steady State HECRAS catchment wide model created in 
2007.  This model is well out of date and the results would not be suitable for use in an 
FCA”.

6.3.6 
In the absence of suitable modelled flood levels, a review of the existing LiDAR data shows 
that the Generating Equipment Site is elevated at its lowest point to approximately 6 m 
above the flood plain of Afon Llan and located approximately 300 m from the current Flood 
Zone 3 extent. In conclusion, it is considered that there is negligible fluvial flood risk to the 
Project from Afon Llan due to the distance from the flood plain and the higher elevation of 
the site and the floodplain.  
Local Ordinary Watercourses and Land Drains 
6.3.7 
Section 3.3 provides a summary of the local ordinary watercourses and drainage ditches. 
Ordinary watercourses fall under the jurisdiction of CCS and land drainage is the 
responsibility of the riparian owner.    
6.3.8 
CCS has confirmed that there are no recorded historical flooding events from ordinary 
watercourses within the vicinity of the Project Site primarily due to the rural nature and size 
of the local watercourse network.  
6.3.9 
The ordinary watercourses and land drains flowing through the Project Site are not included 
within the NRW DAM or Flood Maps. There are no modelled flood water levels for any of the 
identified ordinary watercourses or drainage ditches. However, given the steep topography, 
relatively small channel dimensions and ephemeral nature of some of the drainage ditches it 
has been assumed that the risk of fluvial flooding is low, with ditches only holding water in 
higher return period storm events or when the groundwater level are raised.   
6.3.10 
In the absence of modelled flood levels for ordinary watercourses, a review of the NRW 
Updated Flood Map for Surface Water (UFMfSW) was undertaken. This dataset provides a 
high level assessment of flood risk from surface water and provides an indication of primary 
overland flow paths and likely locations of ponding. This therefore provides a coarse 
indication of the direction of out of bank flood flow routes.    
6.3.11 
The UFMfSW shows that there are two main overland flow routes passing across the 
Project Site from the high ground in the north to the Afon Llan in the south (Figure D3, 
Appendix D). The mapping indicates that the part of the Generating Equipment Site, located 
within DAM Zone B, lies at the confluence of several local watercourses and drains and may 
be at risk of flooding should the watercourse overtop in the 3.3% AEP event. However, given 
the size of watercourse observed during the site visit, steepness of the catchment and size 
of the floodplain downstream it is considered that the risk of fluvial flooding from ordinary 
watercourse is low.  
6.3.12 
It is likely that the greatest fluvial flood risk to the Project Site will be during the construction 
phase when there will be the culverting/bridging of Stream C (Access Road) and diversion of 
Stream B (Generating Equipment Site) and Stream D (Gas Connection). Flood risk 
mitigation measures to reduce this risk will be outlined within the CEMP and are discussed 
in Section 8.2.   
6.3.13 
The AGI area is not located near any watercourses and therefore the risk of flooding from 
fluvial sources is negligible.  
6.3.14 
The Pipeline and Electrical Connection, once constructed, will be underground and not at 
risk of flooding from fluvial sources.  
6.3.15 
In conclusion, it is considered that there is negligible flood risk to the Project from Afon Llan 
due to the distance from the modelled flood plain and the difference in elevation of the 
Project Site and the floodplain. Flood risk from ordinary watercourse is considered to be low 
given the size of watercourse observed during the site visit, steepness of the catchment and 
size of the receiving floodplain downstream.

6.4 
Overland Flow 
6.4.1 
Overland flow results from rainfall that fails to infiltrate the surface. This is exacerbated 
where the permeability of the ground is low due to the type of soil and geology (such as 
clayey soils) or urban development. Surface water flow may also occur in areas where steep 
topography can rapidly convey water that has failed to penetrate the surface or where the 
ground may already be saturated.  
6.4.2 
It has been identified in Section 3.4 that part of the Project Site and surrounding area is 
characterised by low permeable soils. It is likely therefore that rainfall during extreme events 
will be unable to effectively infiltrate into the ground and convey overland flow towards the 
Afon Llan.  
6.4.3 
CCS holds no records of surface water flooding within the vicinity of the Project Site.  
6.4.4 
A review of the UFMfSW indicates that the land adjacent to the local drains and 
watercourses, predominately Stream A (Generating Equipment Site) and Stream B (Access 
Road), have areas that are at a high risk of surface water flooding (3.3% AEP). The majority 
of the Project Site is considered to be at very low risk ((0.1% AEP) for Surface Water). 
Figure D3, Appendix D shows the key flow paths across the Project Site.  
6.4.5 
As described in Section 3.2 the Project Site is reasonably steep, sloping in a south easterly 
and southerly direction towards the Afon Llan floodplain. It is expected that overland flow 
from the upland areas of the Project Site would follow this natural topography away from the 
Project Site with only very localised ponding. The existing trackway to the west of the 
Generating Equipment Site conveys water to the south east away from the Project Site 
through minor land drains.  
6.4.6 
Flood risk from surface water is likely to be greatest during construction when the temporary 
diversion of overland flow routes is required for the construction of the Access Road and 
Gas Connection and permanent diversion of Stream B for the Generating Equipment Site. 
Flood mitigation measures are outlined in Section 8.2.   
6.4.7 
It is concluded that based on the UFMfSW small sections of the Generating Equipment Site, 
Access Road and Gas Connection are at a medium to high risk of flooding from overland 
flow. However the majority of the Project Site is considered to be at low risk of flooding from 
overland flow.  
6.5 
Sewer Flooding 
6.5.1 
Flooding can occur as a result of infrastructure failure, e.g. blocked sewers or failed 
pumping stations. Sewer flooding can occur when the system surcharges due to the volume 
or intensity of rainfall exceeding the capacity of the sewer, or if the system becomes blocked 
by debris or sediment. 
6.5.2 
The Project Site is located within an undeveloped area where there is limited known 
sewerage infrastructure. Flood risk from sewer sources is considered very low and therefore 
not considered further in this FCA.  
6.6 
Groundwater 
6.6.1 
Groundwater flooding occurs where groundwater levels rise above ground surface levels. 
The geology has a major influence on where this type of flooding takes place; it is most 
likely to occur in low-lying areas underlain by permeable rocks (aquifers).

23 
 
6.6.2 
The CCS PFRA, Level 1 and Level 2 SFCA’s state there are no recorded flood events from 
groundwater sources within the CCS region. The FRMP indicates that there is a low risk of 
groundwater flooding across the CCS region.   
6.6.3 
A review of the BGS Area susceptible to groundwater flooding map within the Landmark 
Envirocheck Report (2017) indicates the lower areas of the Project Site and Generating 
Equipment Site are considered to have potential for groundwater flooding at the surface. 
Observations made during the site visit indicate that the water table was high within the 
Generating Equipment Site. 
6.6.4 
Due to the steep local topography at the Project Site, it is likely that any groundwater 
reaching the surface would be conveyed to the south east away from the Generating 
Equipment Site. This was observed during the site visit, as small issues were conveyed in 
ruts and drainage ditches along the trackway at the west of the Generating Equipment Site. 
Therefore by maintaining any existing flow paths during construction and operation the risk 
of ponding will be limited. 
6.6.5 
Based upon the evidence, there is potential for groundwater flooding at the surface however 
given the local topography and proposed ground levels above the groundwater flood risk is 
considered to be low.  
6.7 
Artificial Sources 
6.7.1 
Artificial sources include flood risk from sources such as storage areas and reservoirs. 
6.7.2 
The Afon Lliw and Lower Lliw reservoir are located approximately 2 km to the north of the 
Project Site within a neighbouring topographic catchment. A review of the NRW Reservoir 
Flood Risk Map shows that there is no risk of flooding from a breach to the reservoirs and as 
such is not considered further within this FCA.  
6.8 
Summary 
6.8.1 
In summary the following flood risk for the Project Site: 
 
There is no risk of tidal flooding;  
 
The risk of fluvial flooding is considered to be negligible from Afon Llan and low from 
ordinary watercourses/land drainage to small areas of the Generating Equipment Site 
and Access Road;  
 
The risk of surface water flooding is considered to be medium to high for small areas of 
the Generating Equipment Site, Access Road and Gas Connection however the 
majority of the Project Site is considered to be at low risk;  
 
The risk of sewer flooding is considered to be negligible;  
 
The risk of groundwater flooding is considered to be low; and 
 
There is no risk of flooding from artificial sources.

Climate Change 
7.1 
General 
7.1.1 
TAN15 requires that it is necessary to take account of the potential impact of climate change 
over the lifetime of the development to ensure a safe and secure living and/or working 
environment. 
7.1.2 
Welsh Government published updated climate change guidance in December 201613 . The 
guidance indicates that climate change is likely to have an impact on river flows, sea levels, 
rainfall intensity, wave height and wind speed. 
7.1.3 
Details of the methods and justifications for calculating the projected climate change 
allowances can be found on the Welsh Government website and will not be replicated in this 
document.      
7.2 
Peak River Flows 
7.2.1 
The peak river flow allowances show the anticipated changes to peak flow by river basin 
district. The Project Site is located within the West Wales river basin district and Table 7-1

The lifetime of the development is considered to be a minimum of 25 years and through 
correspondence with NRW it is agreed that the Central estimate for the Total potential 
change anticipated by the 2050’s (25%) can be used in this assessment. The period 
described as the 2050’s is not defined within the Welsh Government Climate Change 
Guidance (2016). However, within the Environment Agency Climate Change Allowances15 
(2016) it is stated for the Dee and Severn River Basin Districts that the period, 2050’s, is 
defined as 2040-2069. Therefore this assessment is considered representative for a design 
life up to 2069.

Increased rainfall affects river levels, land and drainage systems. Table 7-2 shows the 
anticipated changes in extreme rainfall intensity in small and urban catchments based upon 
English guidelines. At the time of writing no specific Welsh Government guidance was 
available and so this is considered the most up to date peak rainfall allowances.

a design life up to 2069.    
7.4 
Impact of Climate Change on Flooding Sources 
Fluvial 
7.4.1 
The effect of climate change on peak river flow and consequently on flood levels within Afon 
Llan is unlikely to increase the flood risk from fluvial sources to the Project Site given the 
present distance and elevation distance from the watercourse.  
Overland Flow 
7.4.2 
Climate change must be taken into account when considering surface water runoff 
generated by the development site. The increase in rainfall intensity will result in increased 
surface water runoff rates and volumes. Therefore the drainage systems associated with the 
development must be designed to accommodate the climate change allowances in 
compliance with TAN15.   
7.4.3 
To accommodate increased surface water volumes peak runoff from the development will be 
attenuated up to and including the 1% + 20% Climate Change AEP event using onsite 
storage. All cut off ditches and culverts will be designed to a similar standard to ensure no 
increased flood risk to the Project Site from overland flow. Section 8.3 and Appendix E 
outline how surface runoff will be managed on the Project Site.

Groundwater 
7.4.4 
The predicted increase in wetness of winters and the intensity of storm events as a result of 
climate change could impact the groundwater level fluctuations at the Project Site and 
possibly increase the fluctuations of the groundwater table. This may therefore increase the 
likelihood of groundwater emergence and the potential for groundwater flooding to impact 
the development.  
7.4.5 
Once constructed, the Project will be largely covered by hard standing, which reduces 
infiltration and the likelihood of localised groundwater flooding reaching the surface. Cut off 
trenches along the northern and western perimeter of the Project Site will intercept any 
overland flow as a result of increased ground water levels and discharge in to the 
attenuation storage and local watercourse.  
7.4.6 
It is therefore anticipated that the risk from groundwater sources will remain low and not 
increase significantly as a result of climate change.

Flood Risk Management Measures 
8.1 
General 
8.1.1 
It has been demonstrated within Section 6 that the main flood risk to the Project Site is from 
surface water runoff and fluvial flooding from ordinary watercourse during construction 
operation and decommissioning, which therefore forms the basis for this assessment. This 
chapter identifies the flood risk management measures required to mitigate against the flood 
risk which has been identified in accordance with TAN15 requirements. 
8.2 
Flood Risk Management Measures 
8.2.1 
An Outline Drainage Strategy (Appendix E) has been prepared to manage surface water 
flood risk to and from the Project Site and is provided within Appendix E. The surface water 
drainage system proposed adopts the principles within The SuDS Manual – CIRIA 75317 and 
industry best practice and is describe further in Section 8.3.  
8.2.2 
The following key measures to mitigate flood risk to the Project Site during construction will 
be implemented to reduce flood risk to the Project Site: 
Construction 
8.2.3 
Construction activities associated with the Project intercept a number of overland flow routes 
as discussed in Section 6.4 which is most notable at the Access Road, Generating 
Equipment Site and Gas Connection. Given that the highest flood risk for the Project is from 
surface water and/or ordinary watercourse flooding mitigation measures are focussed on 
managing and mitigating risks to the temporary works as well as not increasing flood risk off 
site. 
8.2.4 
During construction, pollution prevention guidelines will be followed by the contractor.  
8.2.5 
The proposed works involve new crossings, diversions and temporary diversions of local 
watercourses. Any proposed works to the watercourses require Land Drainage Consent 
from CCS and must be granted before any works can take place. Diversion and crossing of 
local watercourses have been kept to a minimum within the Project design.  
8.2.6 
A Construction Environmental Management Plan (CEMP) will incorporate measures to 
prevent an increase in flooding during construction works. It is expected that the CEMP will 
include provisions such as: 
 
New temporary and/or permanent drainage ditches to prevent uncontrolled surface 
runoff of contaminated water;  
 
Silt traps within drainage ditches to reduce the flow of suspended solids from the 
Project Site;  
 
Settlement lagoons and/or proprietary settlement tanks as required to reduce the flow 
of suspended solids from site;  
 
Suitable layout of the construction site and application of suitable management 
techniques to prevent runoff from stockpiles directly ion to the watercourse; and 
 
Monitoring of overland flow routes along the eastern extent of the Generating 
Equipment Site to ensure minimal impedance of flow routes.

Operation 
8.2.7 
To ensure the ongoing operation of the Project, an Outline Drainage Strategy has been 
prepared (Section 8.3) to manage foul, oily and surface water from the Project Site and flood 
risk mitigation measures have been proposed.   
8.2.8 
The following measures will be implemented to ensure the operation of the Project is 
protected:  
Raised Ground and Finished Floor Levels 
8.2.9 
Ground levels across the Generating Equipment Site will be raised to provide three platform 
terraces for the development. Indicative proposed site levels are provided within Figures C3 
and Figure C4, Appendix C, which demonstrate that the Generating Equipment will be at a 
proposed level of 89.3 m AOD and 86.8 m AOD whilst the attenuation storage area terrace 
will be at a proposed elevation of 84.0 m AOD.  The indicative proposed levels are 
approximately 2 m above higher than the existing south east corner of the Project Site, 
which is currently at the highest risk of flooding. It is anticipated that the raised levels will be 
sufficiently resilient to future climate change levels given the steep topography of the site 
and size of the floodplain.   
8.2.10 
The north east corner of the Generating Equipment Site will be within a cutting below the 
existing ground levels. In this area potential overland flow and or watercourse overtopping 
will be managed by either localised earth mounding and/or a suitably sized cut off ditch (see 
below).  
8.2.11 
As an additional measure the finished floor levels In the Generating Equipment Site will be 
0.15 m above the site road crown level with plant plinths 0.3 m above the site level. This will 
reduce the Power Generation Plant vulnerability to flooding.  
Cut off ditches/watercourses 
8.2.12 
To prevent inundation of the Generating Equipment Site from surface runoff down the 
hillside, cut off drainage ditches will be placed around the uphill Generating Equipment Site 
perimeter. The location of these cut of ditches are located within Appendix E.  These new 
drainage ditches will be designed to divert surface runoff around the Generating Equipment 
Site and return downstream back to the original drainage ditches/watercourse. The final 
design of the cut off ditches will be completed at detailed design however they should be 
designed to adequately accommodate the 1% + 20% Climate Change AEP flows.  
8.2.13 
It is proposed the existing watercourse, Stream C, is diverted around the northern and 
western perimeter of the Generating Equipment Site. The final sizing of the diverted 
watercourse will be undertaken at the detailed design stage however based upon based on 
a catchment area of circa 13,100 m2, pessimistic runoff coefficient of 0.60 and rainfall 
intensity of 45 mm/hr [based on M100-1hr storm it is estimated that the upper end flows will 
be approximately 100 l/s. As noted in Section 8.2.10 this may be extended around to the 
east of the Project Site to protect the cutting platform.  
8.2.14 
The permanent cut-off ditches require Land Drainage Consent from CCS before 
construction can take place.

Maintenance of Overland Flow Routes 
8.2.15 
It has been demonstrated that there is an existing overland flow route that crosses the 
eastern extent of the Generating Equipment Site which, in areas, is considered to be 
medium to high risk of flooding. Part of this overland flow route falling on the Generating 
Equipment Site will be accommodated by the onsite drainage that includes attenuation 
storage for surface runoff from the Project Site (Section 8.3). However, as there is land 
raising at the Generating Equipment Site some of this overland flow route will be diverted 
along the eastern extent of the Project Site. In order to maintain this overland flow path it is 
proposed that the eastern boundary of the Generating Equipment Site is kept clear and 
formalised to encourage water downslope and away from the development towards the 
undeveloped area to the south. This will also provide the easement required by CCS for 
maintenance access to the watercourse. 
Welsh Water - Water Main Easement 
8.2.16 
The Dŵr Cymru Welsh Water Water Main that crosses the site will have an easement of a 
minimum of 30 m as required by Welsh Water. The proposed site layout (Appendix C, C1 
and C2) indicates that a 60 m easement has been provided due to uncertainty of the 
accuracy and digitisation of archive drawings.  Further investigations are currently being 
carried out to identify the location and depth of the Water Main prior to detailed design so 
adequate easement can be provided for.   
8.2.17 
The ground levels will be maintained within the Water Main easement area. This will provide 
a flood flow path in the event of a Water Main rupture away from the elevated Generating 
Equipment Site which should be able to accommodate the understood flows of 1.2-1.7 m3/s. 
The combination of the easement, general topographic slope to the south and elevation of 
Generating Equipment Site Plant means that the flood risk from the unlikely rupture of the 
Water Main will be negligible.    
Access Road Culverts 
8.2.18 
The Access Road leading west from the Generating Equipment Area crosses a small field 
drain, Felindre Gas Compressor Station surface water drainage ditch and an ordinary 
watercourse (Stream B). It is assumed in outline design that a culvert will be used to convey 
flow beneath the road (Appendix E) to prevent the Access Road from flooding. Whilst this is 
proposed as a culvert, other techniques such as bridging could be incorporated into the 
design.   
8.2.19 
Culvert crossings will be designed to allow for flow up to and including the 1% AEP + 20% 
Climate Change Allowance to ensure there is no impedance of flow. For more extreme 
events the overland flow will pass over the road to the south along the natural fall of the 
topography. 
8.2.20 
To mitigate against the risk of blockage it is proposed that a twin culvert arrangement and/or 
trashscreen is implemented which will allow for the continued flow of water beneath the 
Access Road in the event that one culvert is blocked.  
8.2.21 
It is noted that Land Drainage Consent must be granted by CCS prior to any works on 
Ordinary Watercourses.  
Safe Access and Egress Route 
8.2.22 
During flood events it is proposed that suitable access and egress routes are provided the 
details of which are subject to detailed design. As a minimum, safe pedestrian 
access/egress routes should be provided and where possible vehicular routes should be 
accommodated in to the design.

Decommissioning 
8.2.23 
It is recommended that a detailed Decommissioning Environmental Management Plan will 
be prepared at a later date to identify required measures to prevent pollution during this 
phase of the development, based on the detailed decommissioning plan.  
8.2.24 
The mitigation measures for decommissioning will be similar to those identified for 
construction.  
8.3 
Surface Water Management 
8.3.1 
An Outline Drainage Strategy (Appendix E) has been developed for the Project for the 
disposal of foul, oily and surface water from the Project to assist with planning and detailed 
drainage design phases (Appendix E).  
8.3.2 
The Project will increase the impermeable area at the Project Site through the construction 
of hard standing and buildings. Without suitable mitigation measures this is likely to increase 
the surface water runoff rates and volumes that leave the Project Site compared to the 
existing greenfield conditions. The Outline Drainage Strategy (Appendix E) therefore 
identifies mitigation measures such as attenuation storage, swales and infiltration strips to 
manage any increase in surface water runoff as a result of the Project.    
8.3.3 
An increase in impermeable area is only applicable to the Generating Equipment Site and 
Maintenance Compound, Access Road and AGI Compound. The Pipeline and Electrical 
Connection will be below ground and will not increase the impermeable area at the Project 
Site.    
8.3.4 
The main elements of the strategy are as follows: 
 
The Project Site drainage system will be designed to prevent flooding of the Project 
Site during the 3.33% AEP and maintain greenfield runoff rates off site up to and 
including the 1% AEP + 20% Climate Change event;  
 
Where possible, the site will be designed to drain by infiltration;  
 
Pending a Ground Investigation (at detailed design stage) it is assumed that drainage 
by infiltration will not be possible and therefore all site surface water runoff will be 
attenuated up to an including the 1% AEP + 20% Climate Change event and 
discharged to the local watercourse network at the greenfield runoff rate;  
 
The Access Road will generally have a constant cross fall and no longitudinal fall. 
Where possible, roadside swales and infiltration drains will be used to remove and 
convey any standing water in to the surface water drainage system;  
 
The AGI area will drain to a small attenuation area and discharge into the nearest local 
watercourse at the greenfield runoff rate.

8.3.5 
It is not proposed to connect existing road drainage systems into the new surface water 
drainage system. Existing road drainage systems along the access road to the west of the 
Felindre Gas Compressor Station will be maintained 
8.3.6 
The surface water drainage design will be subject to detailed design which will be 
undertaken after granting of the DCO 
8.4 
Flood Attenuation Storage 
8.4.1 
Due to local ground conditions and high groundwater it is unlikely that the proposed surface 
water drainage system will be able to infiltrate into the ground. This will be confirmed by a 
Ground Investigation prior to detailed design. As such a worst case scenario has been 
assumed where all surface runoff from the Project Site will be attenuated in order to mimic 
the equivalent greenfield runoff rates for events up to the 1%AEP +20% Climate Change 
event.    
8.4.2 
It is proposed that attenuation storage is required for the Generating Equipment Site, 
Maintenance Compound, AGI compound and the Access Road.  A full explanation of the 
sizing calculation and location of the attenuation areas is included within the Outline 
Drainage Strategy in Appendix E. 
8.4.3 
Table 8.1 demonstrates the preliminary calculated greenfield runoff rates using the IH124 
method18 and required attenuation storage for each area of the Project Site for the 1%+20% 
Climate Change event. It can be seen that the largest attenuation storage of approximately 
2018m3 is required for the Generating Equipment Site.

Off Site Impacts and Residual Risk 
9.1 
Impact to third party property/land 
9.1.1 
The flood risk to third parties has been assessed in accordance with TAN15. The following 
possible flood risk impacts have been identified: 
 
Loss of ordinary watercourse flood storage at the Project Site;   
 
Impact on overland flow routes and conveyance;  
 
Damage of Dŵr Cymru Welsh Water Water Main 
 
Increase surface runoff (see Section 8);  
9.1.2 
The area of the Project Site that is located within Afon Llan floodplain will not involve any 
built development or any land raising. Therefore this will not affect the storage of the Afon 
Llan floodplain.  
9.1.3 
The Project may have some impact on flood flows and flood storage associated with the 
local watercourse at the south eastern extent of the Generating Equipment Site where 
raising of ground levels are proposed (Figure C3 and C4, Appendix C). The impact on flood 
storage and conveyance will be mitigated by the formalisation of an overland flow route 
along the eastern extent of the Generating Equipment Site. This will allow any flow to pass 
around the site to the south, away from the Cefn Betingau Solar Park and towards the Afon 
Llan floodplain. Furthermore, the creation of suitably sized cut-off drainage ditches will 
provide additional storage during large events. With the formalisation of the overland flow 
path it is anticipated that, combined with the steep catchment, any loss of storage and 
impact on conveyance will be minimal. Minor changes to the flood routes within the rural 
area are not considered to increase flood risk to third parties.      
9.1.4 
During construction of the Gas Connection there may be a temporary diversion of the 
existing drainage ditch to the north of the Generating Equipment Site. Abergelli Farm House 
and Abergelli Solar Farm are located at a higher elevation than the watercourse at this 
location and will therefore not be affected by any temporary diversion.    
9.1.5 
During construction and operation there is a very low risk that the Dŵr Cymru Welsh Water 
Water Main could accidentally be damaged causing water to flow across the Project Site. A 
Ground Penetrating Radar (GPR) survey will be completed in January 2018 to identify the 
exact location and depth of the Water Main and protective provisions will be employed 
during both phasesto ensure any works around the Water Main are strictly controlled. Dŵr 
Cymru Welsh Water require a 30m easement around the Water Main and the proposed 
design includes a 60m easement. The land naturally drains to the south east between the 
laydown area and Generating Equipment Site following existing drainage ditches. It is 
anticipated that the large easement and existing drainage ditch network could adequately 
convey water towards the south east away from the Project Site and towards the Afon Llan,       
9.1.6 
The Outline Drainage Strategy (Appendix E) and mitigation measures highlighted in Section 
8.2 demonstrate that the impact on increased surface runoff will be negligible.   
9.1.7 
It has been concluded that there will be negligible impact to third parties from the Project 
through the implementation of the necessary mitigation measures described in this FCA.

Conclusions and Recommendations 
10.1.1 
Based upon the NRW flood maps, it has been demonstrated in Figure D1, Appendix D that 
part of the southern extent of the Project Site is located with TAN15 Flood Zone C2 (areas of 
the floodplain without significant flood defence infrastructure, based on the NRW extreme 
flood outline, equal to or greater than 0.1% (fluvial or tidal)). As part of the Project design 
this area will not involve any built development or land raising and will therefore not impact 
upon the floodplain or be affected by flooding.  
10.1.2 
Under TAN15 highly vulnerable development (i.e. power stations) must be located out of 
Flood Zone C2, preferably in Flood Zone A and if this is not possible Flood Zone B. A small 
area of the Generating Equipment Site is located within Flood Zone B whilst the majority of 
the Project is located within Flood Zone A (Figure D1, Appendix D). Under TAN15, this is 
considered acceptable development provided flood risk from all sources has been 
considered. 
10.1.3 
To understand the flood risk to the Project Site and impact of the Project to the surrounding 
area an assessment of all sources of flooding has been undertaken and flood mitigation 
measures proposed. 
10.1.4 
Flood risk to the Project was assessed as follows: 
 
There is no risk of tidal flooding;  
 
The risk of fluvial flooding is considered to be negligible from Afon Llan and low from 
ordinary watercourses/land drainage to small areas of the Generating Equipment Site 
and Access Road;  
 
The risk of surface water flooding is considered to be medium to high for small areas of 
the Generating Equipment Site, Access Road and Gas Connection however the 
majority of the site is considered to be at low risk;  
 
The risk of sewer flooding is considered to be negligible;  
 
The risk of groundwater flooding is considered to be low; and, 
 
The risk of flooding from artificial sources is considered to be negligible. 
10.1.5 
The most likely flood risk to the Project Site has been identified as surface water flooding 
and localised ordinary watercourse flooding. Therefore mitigation measures have been 
included within the Project design to reduce the overall risk of flooding to low.   
10.1.6 
An Outline Drainage Strategy has been proposed to control surface water runoff from the 
project site to reduce any of site impact up to and including the 1% AEP +20% Climate 
Change event. Flood attenuation storage is proposed for all impermeable areas on the 
Generating Equipment Site, Access Road, Maintenance Compound and AGI. 
10.1.7 
Through implementation of mitigation measures outlined in this document and in the outline 
drainage design it is considered that this development is acceptable under TAN15 guidance.

PROJECT BACKGROUND 
2.1 
SCOPE OF THIS REPORT 
This conceptual Project Site drainage strategy outlines the proposal for managing the surface 
water, oily water and waste water drainage systems at the proposed Abergelli Power Project.  
External flood risk to the Project Site is outside the scope of this report and will be addressed 
separately.  
2.2 
SITE DESCRIPTION 
The Project Site (approximate UK National Grid Reference SN 65477 01290) is located on open 
land approximately 2 km north of Junction 46 on the M4, to the north of Swansea and 
approximately 1 km southeast of Felindre, 760 m west of Llwyncelyn and 1.4 km north of 
Llangyfelach. Refer to Figures 2.2-1 to 2.2-3 inclusive below.

Figure 2.2-2 Site Location (2) 
 
Figure 2.2-3 Site Location (3) 
The current land use is predominantly agricultural, with sheep and horse grazing. The western 
extent of the Project Site encompasses parts of National Grid’s ‘Swansea North’ electrical 
substation (comprising a 400kV and 132kV substation) and the existing access road leading to 
the substation and Felindre Gas Compressor Station from the B4489.  
The Project Site is accessed from Junction 46 of the M4. From the M4 vehicles would travel north 
via the B4489, with the Project Site therefore accessed from the west utilising the existing

National Grid junction and access road from the B4489 (which is to be widened to accommodate 
abnormal loads and is part of the Access Road) and then via land following the southern 
boundary of the Felindre Gas Compressor Station before crossing over agricultural land 
immediately west of the Generating Equipment Site.  
The Project Site is roughly 'L' shaped (in reverse). Ground levels at the Project Site vary from 
approximately 146 m above ordnance datum (AOD) at the highest point in the north-west corner 
at Rhyd-y-Pandy Road to approximately 80 m AOD along the southern perimeter, with ground 
levels generally falling in a southerly and south easterly direction.   The land within the Generating 
Equipment Site is at approximately 90 m AOD.  
There are no residential dwellings located within the boundary of the Project Site. Most of the 
Project Site is improved grassland but there are areas of marshy grassland in the south eastern 
part of the Generating Equipment Site. There are parts of a Site of Importance for Nature 
Conservation (SINC) within the Project Site (Lletty Morfil SINC). The woodland present within the 
Project Site is designated as Ancient Woodland (a mixture of restored and semi-natural 
woodland).  
Within the Project Site there are springs, with their associated streams and drainage ditches 
which discharge into the Afon Llan (See Figures 2-4 to 2-7 inclusive). The Afon Llan links with the 
Afon Lliw and the River Loughor, which discharges into the Bristol Channel. 
The Generating Equipment Site is located primarily within fields used for grazing, bounded by a 
mixture of drainage ditches, fencing and poor quality hedgerows with substantial gaps in them. 
The Generating Equipment Site and Laydown Area are both crossed by a soft surface horse 
training track known as ‘the gallops’, which runs diagonally north-west to south-east. A block of 
broadleaved woodland, classified as Ancient Woodland, and a Site of Importance for Nature 
Conservation (SINC) lie to the east. There are also further blocks of Ancient Woodland, also 
classified as SINCs, to the west surrounding Swansea North Substation, Felindre Gas 
Compressor Station and the existing access road leading to these facilities from the B4489.  
The proposed gas supply pipeline will follow an approximate north-south route corridor, as shown 
in Figures 2-4 & 2-6, between the National Transmission System south of Rhyd-y-Pandy Road 
and the Generating Equipment Site.  The Pipeline corridor varies between 50 m and 200 m in 
width, depending on the working area required during construction. The maximum area of the 
Gas Connection Site during construction is approximately 13 Ha. Once construction is completed, 
the route corridor will reduce to 10 m wide, reflecting the width of the easement surrounding the 
Pipeline required for maintenance and to ensure safety.  The Pipeline crosses grazing fields 
bounded by a number of poor quality hedgerows (with gaps) and/or fence lines, one Public Right 
of Way, and two drainage ditches. The Pipeline avoids the small deciduous copse to the north of 
the Generating Equipment Site, part of which is classified as Ancient Woodland and a SINC.  
The Electrical Connection will follow a route corridor of approximately 30 m in width during 
construction. The Electrical Connection route coincides with the Access Road for approximately 
500 m of the route length. The maximum site area for the Electrical Connection during 
construction is 3 ha.  It will be located to the southwest of the Generating Equipment Site passing 
through grass fields and following the southern boundary of the Gas Compressor Station, passing 
through an area classified as Ancient Woodland and a SINC, before entering National Grid’s 
Swansea North Substation.  
The geology of the site is characterised by boulder clay and the underlying Grovesend Beds, 
Upper Carboniferous sandstones and thin coals; overlain by glacial sand and gravel, alluvium and 
peat. The geology is overlain by raw grey and brown soils.  
The land within the power generation plant site is approximately 90 m Above Ordnance Datum 
(AOD), generally sloping at 1:25 downwards in a southerly direction.

DRAINAGE STRATEGY 
3.1 
FOUL WATER DRAINAGE PROPOSAL 
The Generating Equipment Site incorporates welfare facilities which will require a site foul water 
drainage system. The site is remote and it is believed it will be unfeasible to connect to a public 
sewer. The provision of a cesspool, composting or chemical toilets has not been considered due 
to Natural Resources Wales preferences, maintenance requirements and staff comfort. As a 
result there are two options for the foul water drainage system:  
1. A foul water drainage system that will drain to a septic tank within the site. The water from 
septic tank would then discharge into an onsite drainage field. 
2. A foul water drainage system that will drain to a package sewage treatment plant within the 
site. The processed water from this treatment plant would then discharge into an onsite 
drainage field or nearby watercourse. 
Option 2 is likely to be the preferred option for ease of maintenance and environmental criteria.  
The selected foul water drainage system will be positioned away from any areas at risk of flooding. 
Site foul water drainage systems shall be designed and constructed in accordance with Part H of 
the UK Building Regulations 2010. Any septic tank or package treatment plant shall be situated a 
minimum of 10 metres from habitable buildings. We suggest the most appropriate siting of the 
sewage treatment plant is in the area to the northwest of the accommodation building 
(immediately northeast of the car parking area) in order to satisfy the aforementioned separation 
requirement and allow ease of vehicular access for maintenance. 
The proposed location of the sewage treatment plant is indicated in Figure 2-4. The most 
appropriate outfall location would seem to be to the proposed drainage swale running along the 
southwest boundary of the Generating Equipment Site. 
3.2 
OILY WATER DRAINAGE PROPOSAL 
An oily water drainage system will be required to receive surface water from potentially 
contaminated oil retaining areas and prevent contaminated water being discharged from the site. 
The following areas and activities have been identified as potential sources of oil contamination:  
 Oil filled transformers 
 Lubrication systems for the Generating Equipment 
 Oil/fuel storage 
 Vehicle hard-standings used for the unloading of oil/fuel 
In the event of a spillage all designated oil retaining areas (e.g. oil filled transformers and oil 
storage areas) will be designed to contain at least 110% of the stored oil plus an allowance for 
fire-fighting water/foam. Rainwater will be removed from oil retaining areas by an automatic pump 
to the oily water drainage system. The automatic pumps will be designed to automatically shut 
down in the event that a major oil spillage is detected in order to prevent large quantities of oil 
entering the oily water drainage system.

Outline Drainage Strategy 
WSP 
Abergelli Power Ltd. 
Project No 70034053 
 
Rainwater drainage from oily water areas will pass through a Class 1 Full Retention Oil Separator 
(as defined in BS EN 858) to remove residual traces of oil before discharging into the site surface 
water drainage system. The Oil Separator shall be sized to suit the oily water catchment area and 
will be fitted with an alarm to indicate when the integral oil coalescer requires maintenance. 
Oily water drainage shall be designed in accordance with National Grid Technical Specification 
2.20 ‘Oil Containment at Electricity Substations and Other Operational Sites’ or similar approved. 
Outline oily water drainage areas for the Generating Equipment Site are indicated in Figure 2-4. 
3.3 
SURFACE WATER DRAINAGE PROPOSAL 
SURFACE WATER DRAINAGE PHILOSOPHY 
The surface water drainage system will be required to adequately drain the Project Site and 
prevent any significant flooding for the maximum design rainfall event of 100 year return period. 
The surface water drainage system will adopt the principles of The SuDS Manual – CIRIA C697.  
To prevent inundation of the Generating Equipment Site from surface runoff down the hillside, cut 
off drainage ditches will be placed around the uphill Generating Equipment Site perimeter. These 
new drainage ditches will be designed to divert surface runoff around the Generating Equipment 
Site and return downstream back to the original drainage ditches/watercourse.  
Where possible the new platform (levels and surfacing) will be designed so they naturally drain by 
infiltration into the surrounding ground. Where this is not economically possible or presents an 
unsatisfactory risk of flooding to the site, infiltration drains will be installed into the new platforms. 
All infiltration drains will connect to the surface water drainage system.  
It is not expected that it will be possible to connect the surface water drainage system to an 
infiltration basin due to the presumed predominantly clayey ground and high groundwater level in 
places. This will be confirmed when the Ground Investigation surveys are carried out. For the 
purposes of this drainage strategy, a worst case is assumed. Instead the discharged flow of water 
at the site boundary from the surface water drainage system will be attenuated in order to mimic 
the equivalent greenfield runoff flow for events up to the 100 year return period event (with climate 
change allowance). The flow will be attenuated using suitably sized attenuation pond(s) with 
downstream flow restriction. The resulting equivalent greenfield runoff will discharge to existing 
nearby watercourses. The attenuation pond(s) shall be sited to prevent flooding of operational 
areas in the event of an extreme rainfall event in excess of the 100 year return period.  
The Gas Connection comprises a buried pipeline and AGI. The Pipeline will not give rise to an 
increase in impermeable area within the Project Site and impact upon the surface water run-off 
regime.  
The only permanent above ground structure associated with the gas connection is the Above 
Ground Installation (AGI) at the point of connection to the National Transmission System. The AGI 
consists of 2No 30m by 30m compounds and is proposed to drain to a soakaway. 
Proposed new bituminous Power Generation Plant Site roads will generally have a constant 
crossfall with no longitudinal fall. Where possible, roadside swales and infiltration drains will be 
used to remove and convey any standing water into the surface water drainage system. Where 
there are space constraints, or there is an elevated risk of contamination, the new roads will be 
kerbed and drain via road gullies into the surface water drainage system.  
Construction laydown areas and a maintenance yard are proposed to the west of the Generating 
Equipment Area on the opposite side of the water main easement. We understand both laydown 
and maintenance areas require granular finish (i.e. crushed rock pavement construction) at 
commencement of construction in the Generating Equipment Area. The maintenance yard will be 
9

retained on completion of construction, however the laydown areas will be returned to grassland  
As a result, the construction laydown area runoff is omitted from calculations for permanent 
construction runoff and it shall be considered in the CEMP only (refer to Section 3.5). 
Culverts to route existing field drains under the proposed Access Road have been assumed in the 
outline design, however, other techniques such as bridges could also be used. These culverts or 
crossings will be designed for events up to the 100 year return period. It is expected that drainage 
of the new section of Access Road will be via roadside swales. Swales will discharge to existing 
watercourses via flow restriction device and piped outlets as necessary to approximate equivalent 
greenfield runoff flows from the proposed road area. 
A section of access road crosses the water main easement. At the time of writing, the form of this 
crossing is unknown. The access road is likely to be raised due to restrictions on excavation 
within the easement zone. In this case this section of road is likely to be formed on an 
embankment above the easement (a causeway) or, if surcharge loading of the easement zone is 
unacceptable, on a suspended bridge deck. Surface water runoff from the grassland/pasture area 
to the north and upslope of the raised access road shall be allowed to passively drain through the 
causeway due to installation of open pipes / culverts at regular spacings for the former option. A 
suspended bridge structure would permit surface water runoff to flow unimpeded in the latter 
option. We would expect any temporary drainage requirements during construction of a raised 
access road to be addressed in the CEMP (refer to Section 3.5). 
It is not proposed to connect existing road drainage systems into the new surface water drainage 
system. Existing road drainage systems along the existing section of Access Road will be 
maintained or modified to reflect any widening. 
PROPOSED SUDS MANAGEMENT TRAIN 
For purposes of this study it is assumed that the sensitivity of receiving watercourses is ‘Medium’. 
In accordance with Table 3.3 of the ‘SuDS Manual’ (CIRIA, 2007) there shall be a minimum of 
three SUDS management train techniques for drainage of runoff from general site development 
areas: 
1. TRAPPED GULLIES / FILTER DRAINS  
As described above, where possible all proposed new bituminous road drainage will be 
collected via roadside swales or infiltration drains. Where required the new platforms will 
be drained via a filter drain. The swales and filter drains will be designed to minimise the 
ingress of sediment into the drainage network. All new swales and drains on the 
Generating Equipment Site will discharge into the proposed attenuation ponds and then 
the existing watercourses. 
2. ATTENUATION 
The primary purpose of the attenuation pond is storage and gradual release of storm 
water runoff, however it will have secondary benefits in terms of water treatment. The 
pond geometry will be selected to promote settlement of any remaining suspended 
sediment from inflow as the pond widens and flow velocity decreases towards its outfall. 
Furthermore, in the unlikely accidental event of entry of pollutants from site activities to 
the surface water drainage system, the attenuation pond provides access for water quality 
sampling and retention of pollutants via closure of a valve within the outfall manhole prior 
to remediation. 
Periodic maintenance of the attenuation pond and its surrounding area will be required by 
the Generating Equipment Site operator in order to remove significant silt deposits and 
10

Abergelli Power Ltd. 
Project No 70034053 
 
control vegetation. Suitable provision shall be made in the layout and levels of the pond 
area to permit access by off-road vehicles to allow this maintenance to take place. 
3. SWALE 
The final measure within the SUDS system will be a drainage swale between the 
attenuation pond and the un-named tributary of the Afon Llan (subject to agreement with 
City and Council of Swansea). The swale will be incorporated into the landscaping and be 
of a vegetated design to provide further filtering measures for any particles that have 
passed through the previous control techniques.  
Drainage from roads only requires application of two treatment train components. Therefore, the 
proposed site access road will be drained via swales that shall provide storage attenuation with 
controlled discharge, approximating to pre-development greenfield runoff, to existing 
watercourses. 
OUTLINE SIZING OF SITE ATTENUATION 
Refer to Section 4 of this report for calculation of outline storage volume requirements. 
3.4 
SITE FLOOD RISK 
The risk to the Project Site by flooding from external sources is outside the scope of this report 
and is therefore not evaluated further herein.  
Buildings, plant and equipment within the site will be elevated above the surrounding platform 
level to avoid inundation by minor surface water flooding in the event of local drainage failure or 
extreme rainfall events in excess of the 100 year return design event.  
As a minimum a raised pedestrian access route will be provided to and within the site to provide 
for safe access and egress during a flood.  
3.5 
SURFACE WATER DRAINAGE STRATEGY DURING CONSTRUCTION 
Surface water drainage during construction will be developed by the contractor and detailed in the 
Construction Environmental Management Plan (CEMP). At this stage it is expected that the CEMP 
will include provisions such as:  
 New temporary and /or permanent drainage ditches to prevent uncontrolled surface runoff of 
contaminated water 
 Silt traps within drainage ditches to reduce the flow of suspended solids from site. 
 Settlement lagoons and / or proprietary settlement tanks as required to reduce the flow of 
suspended solids from site. 
 Suitable layout of the construction site and application of suitable management techniques to 
prevent runoff from stockpiles directly into watercourses.

SCOPE 
The following figures are based on permanent construction only. Runoff and attenuation from 
temporary construction hardstanding (e.g. construction laydown) and similar shall be considered 
by the Contractor in the CEMP (refer to Section 3.5). 
4.2 
RAINFALL & RUNOFF 
Site-specific rainfall has been derived using the HR Wallingford Flood Studies Report (FSR) for 
the 100 year return storm with a range of storm durations for purposes of attenuation design.  
This data is presented in Table 4.2-1 below. Note that a Climate Change factor of 120% has been 
applied to the FSR calculated rainfall depths. This is in accordance with the upper bound figure 
stated in Table 2 of the UK Environment Agency’s publication ‘Flood risk assessments: climate 
change allowances’ (February 2016) for the period 2040 to 2069. The design life of the Abergelli 
Power Project is 25 years.

Table 4.2-1 Site-specific rainfall calculations 
Permanent site construction areas have been subdivided by category for purposes of runoff 
calculation. Subdivision of the Equipment Generating Area is shown on drawing 70034053-SK-C-
001 in Appendix A. A runoff coefficient has been allocated to each area type for determining the 
proportion of rainfall that is converted to runoff. The permanent site area and runoff coefficients 
are presented in Table 4.2-2. The chosen runoff coefficients represent the impermeability of the 
area categories within the limits of 0.0 (no runoff) to 1.0 (100% of rainfall is converted to runoff)

coefficients contain implicit allowances for minor ponding to ground surface during high intensity 
rainfall events.

Introduction
1.1 
Background
AECOM has prepared this Water Framework Directive (WFD) Screening Assessment on behalf of Abergelli
Power Limited (APL) as part of the Environmental Statement (ES) for the proposed Abergelli Power Project
hereafter referred to as ‘the ‘Project’.
This WFD Screening Assessment has been prepared in response to comments received from Natural Resources
Wales (NRW) to the 2014 and 2018 PEIR. This WFD Screening Assessment is contained as an Appendix to the
ES and specifically to supplement the Water Quality and Resources Chapter (Chapter 9) of the ES and should,
therefore, be read together with this chapter.
The Project Site is situated on open land located approximately 2 km north of junction 46 of the M4 within the
administrative area of the City and County of Swansea Council (CCS).  The central grid reference for the site is
SN 6528 0143 and the location of the Project Site is shown in Figure 1-1. A detailed Project description is 
provided in Chapter 3: Project and Site Description.
This Preliminary WFD Assessment Screening Assessment aims to identify the relevant WFD groundwater and
surface water bodies located in the proximity of the Project Site and to undertake an assessment on the WFD
features identified which could potentially be impacted by the Project.
1.2 
Legislative Context
The Water Framework Directive (WFD) aims to protect and enhance the quality of the water environment across
all European Union (EU) member states. It takes a holistic approach to the sustainable management of water by
considering the interactions between surface water (including transitional and coastal waters, rivers, streams and
lakes), groundwater and water-dependent ecosystems. Further details of the WFD are set out in sections 9.3.3,
9.5 and 9.8 of the Water Quality and Resources Chapter of the ES.
Under the WFD, ‘water bodies’ are the basic management units and are defined as all or part of a river system or
aquifer. These water bodies form part of a larger ‘river basin districts’ (RBD), for which ‘River Basin Management
Plans’ (RBMPs) are developed by EU member states and environmental objectives are set. RBMPs are
produced every six years, in accordance with the river basin management planning cycle. Summary documents
for the second cycle of plans were published by Natural Resources Wales (NRW) in December 2015, whilst water
body objectives and measures were updated in 2017.
The WFD requires all EU member states to classify the current condition or ‘status or potential’ of surface and
groundwater bodies and to set a series of objectives for maintaining or improving conditions so that water bodies
maintain or reach ‘good status or potential’ during the next river basin management planning cycle. NRW is the
competent authority for implementing the WFD in Wales. As part of its role, NRW must consider whether
proposals for new developments have the potential to:
 
Cause a deterioration of a water body from its current status or potential; and/ or
 
Prevent future attainment of good status or potential where not already achieved.
As a result, new developments that have the potential to impact on current or predicted WFD status are required
to assess their compliance against the WFD objectives of the potentially affected water bodies.
1.3 
Structure of this report
Section 2 of this report, provides a summary of the WFD screening process. While Section 3 provides information
on the current WFD status of water bodies that have the potential to be impacted by the Project. The no
deterioration assessment methodology is described in Section 4.2 and the WFD Assessment is provided in
Section 5.

WFD Screening 
Screening has identified four WFD surface water bodies and two WFD groundwater bodies of relevance located 
in proximity to the Project Site (i.e. within a 1km buffer set around the Project Site). The water bodies are listed in 
Table 2-1 and the locations are presented in Figure 2-1 with the exception of Burry Inlet Channel, a downstream 
surface water body, which is located approximately 7 km southwest of the Project Site.

considered in professional judgement that of the WFD water bodies identified in Table 2-1, only the Afon Llan 
River body (GB11059032100) and Carmarthen Carboniferous Coal Measures (GB41002G200600) should be 
carried through into the WFD Screening Assessment.  It is considered that the water bodies screened out before 
the assessment are very unlikely to be impacted by the Project.  Justifications for their exclusion are included in

Water Body Status 
3.1 
Background to Surface Water Body Status 
3.1.1.1 
Under the WFD, surface water body status is classified on the basis of chemical and ecological status 
or potential. Ecological status is assigned to surface water bodies that are natural and considered by 
the NRW not to have been significantly modified for anthropogenic purposes. Ecological potential is 
assigned to artificial and man-made water bodies (such as canals), or natural water bodies that have 
undergone significant modification; these are termed Heavily Modified Water Bodies (HMWBs). The 
term ‘ecological potential’ is used as it may be impossible to achieve good ecological status because 
of modification for a specific use, such as navigation or flood protection. The ecological potential 
represents the degree to which the quality of the water body approaches the maximum it could 
achieve. The worst case classification is assigned as the overall surface water body status, in a ‘one-
out all-out’ system. This system is summarised below in Figure 3-1.

3.1.2 
Chemical Status 
3.1.2.1 
Chemical status is defined by compliance with environmental standards for chemicals that are priority 
substances and/or priority hazardous substances, in accordance with the Environmental Quality 
Standards Directive (2008/105/EC). This is assigned on a scale of good or fail. Surface water bodies 
are only monitored for priority substances where there are known discharges of these pollutants; 
otherwise surface water bodies are reported as being at good chemical status. 
3.1.3 
Ecological Status or Potential 
3.1.3.1 
Ecological status or potential is defined by the overall health or condition of the watercourse. This is 
assigned on a scale of High, Good, Moderate, Poor or Bad, and on the basis of four classification 
elements or ‘tests’ (Environment Agency, 2013), as follows: 
 
Biological: This test is designed to assess the status indicated by a biological quality element 
such as the abundance of fish, invertebrates or algae and by the presence of invasive species. 
The biological quality elements can influence an overall water body status from Bad through to 
High. 
 
Physico-chemical: This test is designed to assess compliance with environmental standards for 
supporting physicochemical conditions, such as dissolved oxygen, phosphorus and ammonia. 
The physicochemical elements can only influence an overall water body status from Moderate 
through to High. 
 
Specific pollutants: This test is designed to assess compliance with environmental standards 
for concentrations of specific pollutants, such as zinc, cypermethrin or arsenic. As with the 
physico-chemical test, the specific pollutant assessment can only influence an overall water 
body status from Moderate through to High. 
 
Hydromorphology: For natural, non-HMWBs, this test is undertaken when the biological and 
physico-chemical tests indicate that a water body may be of High status. It specifically 
assesses elements such as water flow, sediment composition and movement, continuity, and 
structure of the habitat against reference or ‘largely undisturbed’ conditions. If the 
hydromorphological elements do not support High status, then the status of the water body is 
limited to Good overall status. For artificial or HMWBs, hydromorphological elements are 
assessed initially to determine which of the biological and physico-chemical elements should be 
used in the classification of ecological potential. In all cases, assessment of baseline 
hydromorphological conditions are an important factor in determining possible reasons for 
classifying biological and physico-chemical elements of a water body as less than Good, and 
hence in determining what mitigation measures may be required to address these failing water 
bodies. 
3.2 
Relevant Surface Water Bodies and Status 
3.2.1.1 
There is one surface water body to be considered in the WFD assessment: the river water body of the 
Afon Llan (Water body ID GB110059032070).  The water body encompasses the headwaters of the 
river to the tidal limit and flows in a general south-westerly direction in proximity of the Project. The 
Llan flows into the Burry Inlet Channel transitional water body (estuary) which is not considered to be 
affected by the Project given that it is located more than 7 km downstream.  Information on the Llan 
water body has been taken from the 2015 Western Wales River Basin Management Plan (NRW, 2015) 
and summarised as follows: 
 
The overall objective of the surface water body is Good by 2015 (and to remain so). 
 
Objective is Good with respect to chemical quality and quantity. 
 
Objective is Good with respect to ecological quality and quantity.

The Natural Resources Wales Watch Water Gallery1  (NRW website, accessed November 2017) 
indicates that under the latest 2015 assessment (Cycle 2) the status of the Llan is ‘good’ and therefore 
the objective in the RBMP has been met.  A summary of the 2009 Cycle 1 and 2015 Cycle 2 
assessment is reproduced in Table 3-1.

3.3 
Background to Groundwater Body Status 
3.3.1.1 
Under the WFD, groundwater body status is classified on the basis of quantitative and chemical status. 
Status is assessed primarily using data collected from the NRW monitoring network; therefore, the 
scale of assessment means that groundwater status is mainly influenced by larger scale effects such 
as significant abstraction or widespread/ diffuse pollution. The worst case classification is assigned as 
the overall groundwater body status, in a ‘one-out all-out’ system. This system is summarised in Figure 
3-2. 
3.3.2 
Quantitative Status 
3.3.2.1 
Quantitative status is defined by the quantity of groundwater available as baseflow to watercourses 
and water-dependent ecosystems, and as ‘resource’ available for use as drinking water and other 
consumptive purposes. This is assigned on a scale of Good or Poor, and on the basis of four 
classification elements or ‘tests’ as follows: 
 
Saline or other intrusions: This test is designed to identify groundwater bodies where the 
intrusion of poor quality water, such as saline water or water of different chemical composition,

as a result of groundwater abstraction is leading to sustained upward trends in pollutant 
concentrations or significant impact on one or more groundwater abstractions. 
 
Surface water: This test is designed to identify groundwater bodies where groundwater 
abstraction is leading to a significant diminution of the ecological status of associated surface 
water bodies. 
 
Groundwater Dependent Terrestrial Ecosystems (GWDTEs): This test is designed to 
identify groundwater bodies where groundwater abstraction is leading to “significant damage” to 
associated GWDTEs (with respect to water quantity). 
 
Water balance: This test is designed to identify groundwater bodies where groundwater 
abstraction exceeds the “available groundwater resource”, defined as the rate of overall 
recharge to the groundwater body itself, as well as the rate of flow required to meet the 
ecological needs of associated surface water bodies and GWDTEs. 
3.3.3 
Chemical Status 
3.3.3.1 
Chemical status is defined by the concentrations of a range of key pollutants, by the quality of 
groundwater feeding into watercourses and water-dependent ecosystems and by the quality of 
groundwater available for drinking water purposes. This is assigned on a scale of Good or Poor, and 
on the basis of five classification elements or ‘tests’ as follows: 
 
Saline or other intrusions: This test is designed to identify groundwater bodies where the 
intrusion of poor quality water, such as saline water or water of different chemical composition, 
as a result of groundwater abstraction is leading to sustained upward trends in pollutant 
concentrations or significant impact on one or more groundwater abstractions. 
 
Surface water: This test is designed to identify groundwater bodies where groundwater 
abstraction is leading to a significant diminution of the chemical status of associated surface 
water bodies. 
 
Groundwater Dependent Terrestrial Ecosystems (GWDTEs): This test is designed to 
identify groundwater bodies where groundwater abstraction is leading to “significant damage” to 
associated GWDTE’s (with respect to water quality). 
 
Drinking Water Protected Areas (DrWPAs): This test is designed to identify groundwater 
bodies failing to meet the DrWPA objectives defined in Article 7 of the WFD or at risk of failing 
in the future. 
 
General quality assessment: This test is designed to identify groundwater bodies where 
widespread deterioration in quality has or will compromise the strategic use of groundwater.

Carboniferous Coal Measures (ID: GB41002G200600). Information on the status of this water body is 
available from the 2015 Western Wales River Basin Management Plan (NRW, 2015) and summarised 
as follows: 
 
The overall objective of the groundwater body is Poor by 2015 (technically infeasible – no 
known technical solution available due to legacy metal mine contamination). 
 
The 2015 Cycle 2 Quantitative Status is Good.

Assessment Methodology 
4.1 
Introduction 
4.1.1.1 
Proposed developments that have the potential to impact on current or predicted WFD status are 
required to assess their compliance against the objectives defined for potentially affected water 
bodies. As part of its role, NRW must consider whether proposals for new developments have the 
potential to: 
 
Cause a deterioration of a water body from its current status or potential; and/ or 
 
Prevent future attainment of Good status (or potential where not already achieved).  
4.2 
No Deterioration Assessment 
4.2.1 
Defining 'No Deterioration' 
4.2.1.1 
'No deterioration' was defined by the Environment Agency in its Position Paper (Environment Agency, 
2013). Steps are required to prevent deterioration of the ecological status, ecological potential and 
chemical status of surface water and the qualitative status and quantitative status of groundwater.  
4.2.1.2 
Originally deterioration was defined by the Environment Agency as deterioration from one status class 
to a lower one, however following a ruling by the Court of Justice of the European Union (CJEU) in 
July 2015 (C-461/13), this has been redefined.  The CJEU ruling clarified that: 
 
“deterioration of the status” of the relevant water body includes a fall by one class of any 
element of the “quality elements“ even if the fall does not result in the a fall of the classification 
of the water body as a whole;  
 
 ‘Any deterioration’ in quality elements in the lowest class constitutes deterioration; and  
 
Certainty regarding a project’s compliance with the Directive is required at the planning consent 
stage; hence, where deterioration ‘may’ be caused, derogations under Article 4.7 of the WFD 
are required at this stage.  
4.2.1.3 
While deterioration within a status class does not contravene the requirements of the WFD, (except for 
Drinking Water Directive parameters in drinking water protected areas), the WFD requires that action 
should be taken to limit within-class deterioration as far as practicable. For groundwater quality, 
measures must also be taken to reverse any environmentally significant deteriorating trend, whether or 
not it affects status or potential. 
4.2.1.4 
The no deterioration requirements are applied independently to each of the elements that come 
together to form the water body classification as required by Annex V of the Water Framework 
Directive and Article 4 of the Groundwater Daughter Directive. 
 
Surface water: To manage the risk of deterioration of the biological elements of surface 
waters, the no deterioration requirements are applied to the environmental standards for the 
physico-chemical elements, including those for the Moderate/Poor and Poor/Bad boundaries. 
 
Groundwater: The no deterioration requirements are applied to each of the four component 
tests for quantitative status and the five component tests for chemical status. The no 
deterioration requirement may not apply to elements at High status and elements at High status 
may be permitted to deteriorate to Good status, provided that: 
─ 
The water body’s overall status is not High; 
─ 
The RBMP has not set an objective for the water body of High status; 
─ 
The objectives and requirements of other domestic or European Community legislation 
are complied with; and 
─ 
Action is taken to limit deterioration within High or Good status or potential classes as 
far as practicable.

Future Status Objectives 
4.3.1.1 
RBMPs are used to outline water body pressures and the actions that are required to address them. 
The future status objective assessment considers the ecological potential of a surface water body and 
the mitigation measures that defined the ecological potential. Assessments in this project are based on 
mitigation measures defined in the 2015 RBMP. Information on WFD measures available from the 
NRW website (accessed November 20173) have also been reviewed. The assessment considers 
whether the Project has the potential to prevent the implementation or impact the effectiveness of the 
defined measures.

5. 
Water Framework Directive Compliance Assessment 
5.1 
General Approach and Project Assumption 
5.1.1.1 
The WFD compliance assessment uses a spreadsheet tool to assess the effects of the Project on 
each of the WFD elements (biological, physico-chemical and hydromorphological surface water 
elements, and quantitative and chemical groundwater elements).  
5.1.1.2 
Both the surface water assessment and the groundwater assessment examine the potential effects of 
the Project, which includes the Power Generation Plant, and Gas and Electricity Connections. The 
works plans are shown in Figure 3.2 of the ES.  
5.1.1.3 
The Power Generation Plant in summary will comprise the Generating Equipment, Laydown Area and 
Access Road.  The Generating Equipment will be an OGCT designed to operate where there is a 
surge in demand and a stack. An existing Access Road will be upgraded between the B4489 and the 
Swansea North Substation and a new Access Road constructed between the Substation and the 
Generation Equipment Site.   
5.1.1.4 
The Gas Connection will be a new above ground installation and approximately 1.4 km of underground 
pipeline to connect to the existing high pressure National Transmission System.  The Electrical 
Connection will comprise elements to enable power to be exported via underground cable to the 
Substation of approximately 900 m in length.  As the Project Site is remote a foul water drainage 
system will either drain to a septic tank or a package treatment plant, and will discharge onsite or to a 
nearby watercourse.  A surface water drainage system incorporating drainage ditches will perimeter 
the Project Site and prevent ponding.  Attenuation ponds will maintain greenfield runoff flows with 
emergency overflow. 
5.1.1.5 
Key assumptions for the assessment are as follows: 
 
Ground Works: It is assumed that ground works will comprise excavation and levelling for 
foundations, piling (if required) and laying of Gas and Electric Connections and erection of the 
Generating Equipment.  
 
Dewatering: It is assumed that no groundwater dewatering is required as part of the Project. 
 
Outline Construction Environmental Management Plan (CEMP): It is assumed that suitable 
plans will be put in place through the Outline CEMP (secured in the development consent 
order) in order to reduce risks to the environment.       
 
Surface Water Run-off: It is assumed that drainage from the Project will not have an impact on 
surface water run-off (and therefore water quality) into the Llan WFD water body.  
5.1.1.6 
For surface water, the potential effects identified are as a result of: 
 
Noise and vibration during construction of foundations and piling during the construction phase; 
 
Temporary land-take during the construction phase; 
 
Pollution due to discharges or spillages during the construction phase; 
 
Scour during the construction phase; 
 
Temporary diversion of tributary drains during construction phase; 
 
Permanent land take during the operational phase; and 
 
Permanent diversion of tributary drains during operation. 
5.1.1.7 
For groundwater, the potential effects identified are as a result of: 
 
Pollution due to discharges or spillages during the construction phase; 
 
Piling and below ground working causing mobilisation of contaminants during the construction 
and operational phases; and 
Preliminary WFD Assessment

 
Damming of groundwater flow behind sheet piles (decreasing groundwater contributions and 
potentially mobilising contamination). 
5.1.1.8 
Appendix A contains the surface water and groundwater assessments where the above potential 
effects are considered. The colour coded system referred to in Table 4-1 and Table 4-2 is used to give 
a visual impression of the compliance assessment. 
5.2 
No Deterioration Assessment 
5.2.1 
Llan – headwaters to tidal limit 
5.2.1.1 
The Project is located in proximity to tributary drains of the Afon Llan River with only the southern edge 
of the Project Site outline in proximity of the Afon Llan WFD body.   
5.2.1.2 
There is the potential for localised effects from land take and scour as a result of construction close to 
tributary drains which may cause a loss of habitat. However, this is unlikely to be significant at 
waterbody scale and it is considered that habitats will recover naturally.  The impacts are not expected 
to be significant at water body scale and the system would recover naturally. 
5.2.1.3 
There is the potential for localised temporary impacts on water quality in the Llan from the mobilisation 
of contaminated sediment or groundwater into surface water through piling below ground workings.  
The impact is not expected to increase at the waterbody scale and any impacts are likely to be minor 
and localised on the tributary drains.  Should any unforeseen water quality issues be identified during 
future ground investigations, which are likely to follow the granting of planning permission , further 
mitigation measures will be embedded into the design to limit any adverse impacts on the surface 
water body.  
5.2.1.4 
The Outline CEMP will mitigate potential impacts on the Afon Llan from spillages during construction.   
5.2.1.5 
There is potential for minor impacts on habitat, water quality and hydromorphology as a result of 
diversion of tributary drains during the construction and operation phases.  Any impacts are likely to be 
localised to the tributary drains and are not expected to be significant at the water body scale. 
5.2.1.6 
Therefore, overall the Project is not expected to result in significant deterioration or change in surface 
water body status.  
5.2.2 
Carmarthen Carboniferous Coal Measures 
5.2.2.1 
The Project is not anticipated to involve dewatering, which limits the potential construction impacts of 
the Project on the groundwater body. There is believed to be potential for contamination with respect 
to land quality, although the potential to impact the WFD status of the groundwater body is minor as 
the impacts will be localised especially given the likely presence of low permeability superficial 
deposits.  Should any unforeseen water quality issues be identified during future ground 
investigations, which are likely to follow the granting of planning permission, further mitigation 
measures will be embedded into the design to limit any adverse impacts on the groundwater body.  
5.2.2.2 
Any proposed piling and below ground working may have the potential to reduce groundwater 
contributions to surface water or dependent ecosystems.  However, it is not expected that the 
interaction between groundwater-and surface water is a key driver given the likely low permeability 
superficial deposits in the study area.  Therefore, piling and below ground activities are no anticipated 
to have a measurable impact on the status of the groundwater body throughout the construction and 
operational phases.  
5.2.2.3 
The Outline CEMP will mitigate potential adverse impacts on the Carmarthen Carboniferous Coal 
Measures groundwater body from spillages during construction.  
5.2.2.4 
Overall, the Project is not expected to result in significant deterioration or change in groundwater body 
status.

5.3 
Future Good Status 
5.3.1.1 
The status objective for the Llan water body as reported within the 2015 RBMP is Good by 2015, 
therefore the objective is currently met.  The focus of the NRW programme of measures is to prevent 
deterioration of status in all water bodies which is assessed in Section 5.2. 
5.3.1.2 
The objective of the Carmarthen Carboniferous Coal Measures is Poor by 2015.  This objective is 
classified as less than Good by 2027 in the 2015 RBMP (a less stringent objective) because a Good 
objective is technically infeasible due to legacy metal mine contamination. 
5.3.1.3 
At present there are no local targeted measures within the catchments to maintain or achieve 
improvements to the status of the water bodies.  National Measures set by NRW in the 2015 RBMP to 
achieve the objectives of the plan relate to: 
 
Physical Modifications; 
 
Management of pollution from sewage and waste water; 
 
Management of pollution from towns, cities and transport; 
 
Changes to natural flow and levels of water; 
 
Managing invasive non-native species; 
 
Managing pollution from rural areas; 
 
Managing the impacts of acidification; 
 
Managing pollution from mines. 
5.3.1.4 
Based on the above information it is not considered that any of the aspects of the Project will prevent 
the WFD objectives from being achieved.

Conclusion  
6.1.1.1 
The WFD assessment indicates that, based on the current understanding of the Project, there is 
potential for minor localised effects on the Afon Llan River surface water body.  However, it has been 
assessed that it is unlikely that the Project will cause any significant deterioration or change in water 
body status or prevent attainment, or potential to achieve, future good status.   
6.1.1.2 
The WFD assessment indicates that there is potential for minor temporary or localised effects on the 
Carmarthen Carboniferous Coal Measures groundwater body.  However, it has been assessed that it 
is unlikely that the Project will cause any significant deterioration or change in water body status or 
prevent attainment, or potential to achieve, the WFD objectives.  
6.1.1.3 
No further assessment of WFD is recommended given that no significant deterioration or change in 
water body status is expected based on the current understanding.

Introduction 
This report describes a sound survey undertaken at noise sensitive receptors around the Abergelli Power Project 
site (hereafter referred to as the ‘Project Site’) on behalf of Abergelli Power Limited.  The purpose of the survey 
was to provide baseline noise information, which will be used to inform an Environment Statement (ES) for the 
proposed Abergelli Power Station. 
The 2018 Preliminary Environmental Impact Report (PEIR) Noise Assessment was based on a noise survey 
conducted by a previous consultant in 2014.  It was considered that the scope of the previous survey had been 
too limited to provide fully representative data for the Project Site and that a more detailed, up to date survey 
would be required for the ES.   
The survey was conducted following the background sound levels determination requirements of BS 4142:2014 
Measurement and assessment of industrial and commercial sound.  The following sections fulfil the reporting 
requirements of that standard. 
A glossary of acoustics terminology is provided in Appendix A.

Baseline Survey 
2.1 
Site Description 
The Project Site is situated in a rural area to the south east of Abergelli Farm. The Project Site is surrounded by 
agricultural land and scattered farms in all directions, with small clusters of housing.  To the south is the M4 
motorway corridor at a distance of approximately 1 km. Road traffic noise from the surrounding local roads and 
M4 motorway, and noise from farming activities were the dominant sources in the area.  
Figure 1 below locates the Noise Sensitive Receptors around the Project Site.

Noise Sensitive Receptors 
Six Noise Sensitive Receptors (NSRs) were identified for the project. On this occasion access was only possible 
to use four of these for the detailed survey.  However the four locations monitored covered all compass directions 
around the Project Site.  
The NSRs are listed in Table 1 below.

Subjective impressions of noise sources 
Descriptions of noise sources heard on site at the measurement locations are included in Table 2 below. As well 
as noise sources being observed at the time of set-up and collection of the loggers, each of the sites was 
attended around 01:00 on 21st February to determine the noise sources during the night-time period. 
In general, during the daytime, the noise climate had audible contributions from the following sources: 
M4 motorway traffic noise, low but audible, a distant rotary engine noise, possibly a drone (as advised by the 
property owner of NSR 6), animal noises including wild birds, hens and far cattle, and wind through the trees.

These instruments are all within calibration and calibration certificates can be provided on request.  
The sound level meters at NSRs 1, 5 and 6 were mounted on a stainless steel pole, and the sound level meter at 
NSR 4 was mounted on a tripod. All were at a height of approximately 1.2 m from the ground and wind shields 
were used. There were no vertical reflecting surfaces within 3.5 m of the measurement locations.  
2.6 
Operational Test 
The sound level meters and associated microphones were field calibrated at the beginning and end of their 
respective measurement periods in accordance with recommended practice.  No significant drift in calibration 
was observed during the measurement periods.  The accuracy of the calibrator can be traced to the National 
Physical Laboratory Standards. 
2.7 
Weather conditions 
Weather conditions during the survey were within the parameters set out in BS 4142 and had no adverse effect 
on the levels measured.  
Weather data for local weather stations was obtained from public sources for the duration of the survey.  Wind 
speeds were generally below 5 m/s throughout the survey. During the day, the temperature ranged between 1

and 11 degrees with an average of 7 degrees Celsius, and during the night it ranged between 1 and 7 with an 
average of 5 degrees Celsius. There were no significant periods of rain. 
The favourable wind conditions for gathering suitable data at each NSR are stated in the first half of Tables 5 and 
6 below which details the downwind direction and range necessary for use in the assessment for both the day 
and night-time periods.  Periods with downwind conditions for each receptor are shown in green.

Unattended logged measurements were made between the afternoon of Thursday 15th February and the morning 
of Wednesday 21st February 2018 at each of the NSR locations. They were chosen as being representative of 
the background levels at that NSR. 
The background sound levels were measured in general accordance with the methodology set out in BS 
4142:2014 ‘Methods for rating and assessing industrial and commercial sound’ (BS 4142). In addition, 
measurements were in general accordance with BS 7445-2:1991 ‘Description and measurement of 
environmental noise, Part 2: Guide to the acquisition of data pertinent to land use’ which defines parameters, 
procedures and instrumentation required for noise measurement and analysis.

Background sound level  
BS 4142 states gives guidance on how a representative background sound level can be derived from a sound 
measurement data set.   
 
Section 8.1.1 states that background sound level should be determined in “weather conditions that are 
representative or comparable to the weather conditions when the specific sound occurs”.  The propagation of 
sound from outdoor sources is significantly influenced by the weather.  In particular the propagation down wind of 
a source can be 10 to 15 dB greater than that upwind.  The prediction methodology used to derive the specific 
sound level for the proposed power station (based on ISO 9613) assumed downwind conditions for each 
receptor.  Therefore the predicted specific sound levels will only occur at each receptor when that receptor is 
downwind of the source.  Representative background sound levels must therefore by measured in similar 
conditions.  Therefore, for each receptor the data set was filtered so that only measurements sessions were the 
average wind direction was within a 120° arc (60°s each side) of the downwind condition.  
 
Section 8.1.4 states that the data set should be analysed statistically to obtain a representative value.  It clearly 
states that the lowest measured level should not be taken as representative.  Therefore, after filtering for wind 
direction as described above the mean and modal values of the remaining results for each receptor were 
obtained.  Both of these are presented in the results section of this report.  They were generally with one or two 
dB of each other. 
 
The modal value was selected as representative for each receptor.

Comparison with Previous Survey Results 
 
The assessments in the 2018 PEIR were based upon the results of a brief survey undertaken in 2014.  The 2014 
survey was so brief that the number of measurements for each location was small and it was not possible to 
undertake any statistical analysis to derive representative values for the background and residual sound levels.  
As a result, the levels used in the 2018 PEIR were subject to specific conditions and noise sources present 
during the brief measurement period and did not give a representation of the full range of appropriate conditions 
and sources. 
The assessment made using that data are summarised in Table 9 below.

The potential impact of uncertainty  
There are several potential sources of uncertainty in the result obtained.  These are listed in Table 11 along with 
the measures taken to mitigate them. 
 
Table 11.  Sources of uncertainty 
Source 
Mitigation 
Effects of wind due to wind 
generated noise 
The survey period was selected with low predicted windspeeds.  Weather information was 
noted at the time of set-up and collection, and public weather sources were used so that 
measurements affected by unsuitable wind conditions could therefore be excluded. 
Effects of wind on propagation 
of background sound sources 
Survey period chosen at a time of low wind speed (<5 m/s). Weather information was noted at 
the time of set-up and collection, and historic weather data was obtained so that 
measurements affected by unsuitable wind conditions could therefore be excluded. 
Attendance at site for the setup and collection of the noise monitors, and during the night-time 
period allowed observations of noise sources in the area. 
Possibility of unrepresentative 
activities 
contributing 
to 
background sound 
Study of site prior to survey and drive-around inspection before and after survey indicated no 
major road or rail disruption or major construction projects in the area.  Undertaking survey 
over a longer and continuous period gave a fuller picture of the general levels of activity. 
Uncertainties in measurement

Appendix A Glossary of Acoustic Terminology 
This document provides a layperson’s explanation of the acoustics terms that commonly appear in reports.  It is 
not intended to give full scientific definitions and explanations or go into detail on how and why things are as they 
are.  Some obsolete terms and abbreviations have been included as they still appear in documents from time to 
time. 
 
Many words have more specific meanings when used in acoustics than in every-day language.   
sound 
is used to describe the physical phenomenon of the transmission of energy 
through gaseous or liquid media via rapid fluctuations in pressure. 
level 
used solely to describe values measured in decibels 
loudness 
is the human perception of the level of sound 
noise 
has no strict definition and is often used interchangeably with sound however it 
is usually taken to mean unwanted sound 
index 
a value based on the mathematical processing of raw data 
indicator 
a value used to indicate the likelihood of a particular response of effect 
eg. L10,18hr is an index based on statistical processing of sound pressure data 
that is used as an indicator for road traffic noise response. 
weighted 
values modified to reflect sensitivities at particular frequencies. 
directivity 
the amount by which a source radiates more sound in one direction than 
another. 
decibels 
dB 
 
The decibel is not a true measurement unit nor is it exclusive to acoustics. 
The decibel is a logarithmic ratio of two values of a variable.  Decibels are used 
because they can represent very wide ranges of ratios (from trillionths and 
billionths to billions and trillions) with a small range of decibel values.  Decibels 
can be used to represent measured values by using a known reference value in 
the ratio.  When using decibels to measure something it is therefore important to 
specify what variable is actually being measured and what reference level has 
been used.  This is done by adding a reference value statement in the form “dB 
re x units”, where the units indicate the variable being measured and x is the 
reference value. 
Decibels are used in acoustics because the human ear responds to sound in a 
logarithmic way and the quantities measured in acoustics vary over wide ranges.  
However, decibels are used in acoustics to measure several different things 
which it is important not to confuse with each other. 
To avoid confusion there is a notation system that identifies what a decibel value 
is for.  The notations take the form of an italic capital letter and some subscript 
characters.  The capital identifies the general type of value and the subscripts 
give specific details of what is being represented. 
Lxxx  
denotes a level (ie a value measured in dB by comparison with a 
reference value);  
Dxxx  
denotes a difference between two levels; 
Rxxx  
denotes a rating (or index), which is measure of the generalised 
acoustic performance of a material or construction based on a 
difference between two levels;  
Cxxx  
denotes a correction (or constant) 
Of these only those with L notations require a reference value statement.  Those 
with D or R notations are effectively ratios of two measured values not one 
measured value and a reference value and those with C notations are not based 
on reference values at all.  A reference value statement therefore has no 
meaning when describing D, R and C decibels. 
Because decibels are logarithmic they have to be added, subtracted, multiplied, 
divided and averaged using different techniques from normal numbers. 
Sound Pressure Level 
Lp  
 
obsolete – SPL 
This is the basic measure of how much sound there is at a given location.  It is a 
measure of the size of the pressure fluctuations in the air that we perceive as 
sound.   
Sound Pressure Level is expressed in decibels with a reference level of 20 Pa 
(Lp in dB re 20 Pa)

Sound Power Level 
LW 
obsolete – SWL 
This is the total amount of sound produced by a source.  It cannot be measured 
directly but it can be calculated from Sound Pressure Level measurements in 
known conditions.  It can be used to predict the Sound Pressure Level at any 
point.  
Sound Power Level is expressed in decibels with a reference level of 1 pW (LW 
in dB re 1 pW).  In the US a reference of 100 fW is sometimes used 
Pitch, frequency 
 
 
 
 
tonal sound 
broadband sound 
impulsive sound 
 
frequency analysis 
 
The sound we perceive can have different characteristics.  These can range 
from low-pitched hums to high-pitched squeals and impulsive sounds.   
In engineering acoustics the word frequency rather than pitch tends to be used 
when describing the characteristics of a sound.  The unit of frequency is the 
Hertz (Hz), which is the number of pressure fluctuations per second.  
Any sound can be defined by its frequency content.  Some sounds comprise just 
one discrete frequency (tonal sounds).  Others are distributed over wide 
frequency ranges (broad band sound).  Impulsive sounds are made up short 
pulses of high frequency components.  Sources often produce all of these types 
of sound at the same time.   
There are different ways of analysing and displaying the frequency content of a 
sound: 
Octave Band Analysis  
is the simplest method. The audible range of 
frequencies is divided into 10 bands.   
Third-Octave Band Analysis 
more detailed with 30 bands  
Narrow Band Analysis 
12th Octave (120 bands), 24th Octave (240),  
Fast Fourier (FFT) Analysis 
a high resolution technique that can give 
extremely detailed information on frequency 
content 
 
 
 
A-weighting 
LA or LpA, LWA, 
 
 
 
obsolete – dBA, dB(A) 
 
similar – C-weighting 
LC or LpC, LWC 
The human ear does not sense all frequencies of sound equally.  Our sensitivity 
is at a maximum at around 2 kHz and steadily decreases above and below.  
Below 20 Hz and above about 20 kHz we can’t hear at all.   
Within its operating limits a precision measurement microphone measures all 
frequencies the same so the output it produces does not reflect what we would 
actually hear.  The A-weighting is an electronic filter that matches the response 
of a sound level meter to that of the human ear.  When A-weighted the Sound 
Pressure Level Lp becomes LpA (or LA) and the Sound Power Level LW becomes 
LWA. 
It used to be common to identify that a level was A-weighted by writing dB(A) or 
dBA instead of dB.  These terms are now obsolete and should not be used as 
they conflict with other, non-acoustic, uses of decibels 
The response of the human ear varies depending on how loud the sound is.  A-
weighting matches the response of a sound level meter to human hearing at low 
levels (~ 40-90 dB).  For higher levels there are other weightings the most 
common of which is the C-weighting. 
Different types of decibels commonly used in acoustics 
Lp  
LpA (or LA) 
 
 
 
 
LAF, LAS 
The instantaneous sound pressure level (Lp) 
The A-weighted instantaneous sound pressure level (LpA or LA)   
This is the root mean square size of the pressure fluctuations in the air.  This level 
can fluctuate wildly even for seemingly steady sounds.  To make sound level 
meters easier to read the values on the display are smoothed or damped out.  This 
is effectively done by taking a rolling average of the previous 0.125 s (FAST time 
constant) or the previous 1 s (SLOW time constant). 
The letters F or S are added to the subscripts in the notation to indicate when the 
FAST or SLOW time constant has been used.  These are often omitted but it is 
good practice to include them. 
Lmax  
LAmax  
LAFmax  
 
 
 
Lmin , LFmin 
The maximum instantaneous sound pressure level (Lmax),  
The A-weighted maximum instantaneous sound pressure level (LAmax) 
The A-weighted maximum instantaneous sound pressure level with a FAST time 
constant (LAFmax).   
This is the highest instantaneous sound pressure level reached during a 
measurement period.   
The opposite of the Lmax is the minimum instantaneous sound pressure level or 
Lmin etc. 
It is good practice to include the letter which identifies the time constant used as 
this can make a significant difference to the value.

LN,T 
LAN,T LAFN,T 
N = %age value, 0-100 
T = measurement time 
eg. LA90, LA10, LAF90, 5 min 
The percentage exceedence sound pressure level (LN,T), 
The A-weighted percentage exceedence sound pressure level (LAN,T), the A-
weighted percentage exceedence sound pressure level with a FAST time constant 
(LAFN,T).  
This is the sound pressure level exceeded for N% of time period T.  eg. If an A-
weighted level of x dB is exceeded for a total of 6 minutes within one hour, the 
level will have been above x dB for 10% of the measurement period.  This is 
written as LA10,1hr = x dB. 
LA0 (the level exceeded for 0 % of the time) is equivalent to the LAmax and LA100 (the 
level exceeded for 100 % of the time) is equivalent to the LAmin. 
It is good practice to include the letter which identifies the time constant used as 
this can make a significant difference to the value. 
Leq,T 
LAeq,T 
T = measurement time 
eg. LAeq,5min 
The equivalent continuous sound pressure level over period T (Leq,T),  
The A-weighted equivalent continuous sound pressure level over period T (LAeq,T). 
This is effectively the average sound pressure level over a given period.  As the 
decibel is a logarithmic quantity the Leq is not a simple arithmetic mean value. 
The Leq is calculated from the raw sound pressure data.  It is not appropriate to 
include a reference to the FAST and SLOW time constants in the notation

There are warnings associated with one or more model runs - see the 'Data Errors and Warnings' tables for each Analysis or Demand Set. 
 
Values shown are the highest values encountered over all time segments. Delay is the maximum value of average delay per arriving vehicle. Arm and junction delays are 
averages for all movements, including movements with zero delay.

Warning
Mini-roundabout
Junction 3
Mini-roundabout appears to have unbalanced flows and may behave like a priority junction; treat results with 
caution. See User Guide for details.[Arms B and C have 83% of the total flow for the roundabout for one or 
more time segments]
Warning
Linked junction
Junction 1 - Arm C
Linked arm: Junction 1 Arm C has more than one lane at its upstream end. It is recommended that the 
upstream lane level for a linked arm should have only one lane (if necessary add a dummy lane level to do 
this)
Warning
Linked junction
Junction 2 - Arm A
Linked arm: Junction 2 Arm A has more than one lane at its upstream end. It is recommended that the 
upstream lane level for a linked arm should have only one lane (if necessary add a dummy lane level to do 
this)
Warning
Linked junction
Junction 3 - Arm C
Linked arm: Junction 3 Arm C has more than one lane at its upstream end. It is recommended that the 
upstream lane level for a linked arm should have only one lane (if necessary add a dummy lane level to do 
this)
