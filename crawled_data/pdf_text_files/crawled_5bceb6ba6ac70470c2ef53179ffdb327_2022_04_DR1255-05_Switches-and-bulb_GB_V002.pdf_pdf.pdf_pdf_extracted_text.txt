You’ll remember from the ‘Symbols 
for simple circuits’ sheet that we can 
introduce components to a simple circuit 
and use special symbols to recognise 
what they are.
If we make a simple circuit with a bulb  
(symbol pictured right), we’ll want a way 
of turning it ‘on’ and ‘off’. 
We can do this using a switch, and show 
it with the following symbols:
When the switch is open (off), the circuit’s 
not complete, the electricity can’t flow 
along the wire and the bulb won’t light up.
Open (off)
Closed (on)
Switches and bulbs
When the switch is closed (on), there’s a 
complete circuit so the electricity from the 
battery can travel along the wire to light 
the bulb.
