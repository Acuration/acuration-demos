10.2 Design Principles Statement
Design  
Principles
1.1.1. This document is the Design Principles Statement 
for the Abergelli Power Project. It has been prepared 
by Sheppard Robson on behalf of Abergelli Power 
Limited (APL). 
1.1.2. APL are promoting a new thermal electricity generating 
station (hereafter referred to as the Project) on land 
located approximately 2 km north of junction 46 of 
the M4, approximately 1 km southeast of Felindre, 
and 1.4 km north of Llangyfelach. The Project would 
operate as a Open Cycle Gas Turbine (OCGT) 
peaking plant and would be designed to provide an 
electrical output of up to 299 Megawatts (MW). The 
plant would be fuelled by natural gas.
1.1.3. The Power Generation Plant comprises: 
• 
Generating equipment including one Gas Turbine 
Generator with one exhaust gas flue stack and 
Balance of Plant (BOP) (together referred to as the 
Generating Equipment) which are located within the 
Generating Equipment Site;
• 
An Access Road to the Generating Equipment Site 
from the B4489 which lies to the west, formed by 
upgrading an existing access road between the 
B4489 junction and the Swansea North Substation 
(the Substation) and constructing a new section of 
access road from the Substation to the Generating 
Equipment Site;  
• 
A temporary construction compound for the storage of 
materials, plant and equipment as well as containing 
1.1  Introduction
site accommodation and welfare facilities, temporary 
car parking and temporary fencing (the Laydown 
Area). A small area within the Laydown Area will be 
retained permanently (the Maintenance Compound).
• 
Ecological Mitigation Area – area for ecological 
enhancement within the Order Limits; and  
• 
Permanent parking and drainage to include: a site 
foul, oily water and surface water drainage system
1.1.4. The Project will also require:
• 
a new Gas Connection to bring natural gas to the 
Generating Equipment from the National Transmission 
System; and
• 
a new Electrical Connection to export power from the 
Generating Equipment to the National Grid Electricity 
Transmission System (NETS).
1.1.5. As the Project is a generating station located in 
Wales but its generating capacity is under 350MW, 
‘associated development’ under section 115 of 
the PA 2008 cannot be included within the DCO. 
Separate consents will be sought for the Gas 
Connection and the Electrical Connection under the 
Town and Country Planning Act 1990 or via permitted 
development rights. 
1.1.6. However, APL is seeking authorisation for powers 
of compulsory acquisition over all land required 
to facilitate construction of the Power Generation 
Abergelli
UK Location Map
Plant, including the land and rights required for the 
construction and operation of the Gas Connection 
and Electrical Connection.  
1.1.7. The Power Generation Plant, the Gas Connection 
and the Electrical Connection are together described 
in this Statement as the ‘Project’.

10.2 Design Principles Statement
1.2  Purpose of Document
1.2.1. As described in the Planning Statement (Document 
Reference 10.1.0) Section 104 of the Planning Act 
2008 sets the statutory framework for determination 
of the application.  Section 104 requires that the 
application must be determined in accordance with 
the relevant National Policy Statement (NPS), except 
where a number of exceptions apply, including 
where the adverse impact of the development would 
outweigh its benefits.  Section 104 requires the 
Secretary of State to regard to the relevant national 
policy statements, any local impact report, and any 
other matters which the Secretary of State thinks 
are both important and relevant to the Secretary of 
State’s decision.
1.2.2. The relevant National Policy Statements.  
 
For the Project these are: 
• 
National Policy Statement EN-1 - The Overarching 
National Policy Statement for Energy; 
• 
National Policy Statement EN-2 - National Policy 
Statement for Fossil Fuel Electricity Generating 
Infrastructure; 
• 
National Policy Statement EN-4 - National Policy 
Statement for Gas Supply Infrastructure (relevant in 
respect of the Gas Connection);
• 
National Policy Statement EN-5 – National Policy 
Statement for Electricity Networks Infrastructure 
(relevant in relation to the consideration of alternatives).
1.2.3. Other important and relevant considerations. 
These are considered to include the Planning Policy 
Wales (PPW) and relevant local planning policy 
adopted or being prepared by City and County of 
Swansea Council (CCS), and local environmental 
constraints and stakeholder/consultee responses 
during the non-statutory and statutory consultation 
exercises. A more detailed discussion can be found 
in the Planning Statement (Document Reference 
10.1.0).
1.2.4. Specifically in relation to design, paragraph 4.5.4 of 
NPS EN-1 requires applicants “demonstrate in their 
application documents how the design process 
was conducted and how the proposed design 
evolved. Where a number of different designs were 
considered, applicants should set out the reasons 
why the favoured choice has been selected”. 
1.2.5. The Project has been developed to respond suitably 
to all of the above considerations. The process by 
which this was conducted, and the reasons for key 
design choices, are documented in the Environmental 
Statement, in particular, Chapter 5 ‘Alternatives’ 
(Document Reference 6.1.0), and the Consultation 
Report, in particular chapter 5 (Document Reference 
5.1.0). Chapter 5 of the Consultation Report 
explains, for each stage of the Project, the nature of 
consultation exercises, the responses received, and 
how these influenced the design. 
1.2.6. The responses influenced a variety of important 
design changes (see section 11.1 of the Consultation 
Report Document reference: 5.1.0) including:
• 
A reduction in the number of stacks from up to five 
to one;
• 
Selection of an underground cable option as opposed 
to an overhead line option to export power from the 
Generating Equipment;
• 
Selection of a preferred Access Route Option: and
• 
Realignment of the new section of Access Road.
1.2.7. The visual impact of the stack, alignment of the access 
road and landscape treatment were amongst other 
design matters that were influenced by comments 
from consultees. In addition, other application 
documents such as the Environmental Statement 
Appendices (Document Reference 6.2.0) contain 
design process information and are referenced in 
this document under ‘Consideration of policy and 
context’.
1.2.8. The purpose of this Design Principles Statement 
is to draw together the findings of the various 
documents as they relate to design, and establish 
firm and deliverable commitments to Good Design. 
These commitments are secured by Requirement 2 
of the Draft DCO (Document Reference 3.1) to the 
effect that implementation must be substantially in 
compliance with this Design Principles Statement.

1.2.9. Consideration of policy and context 
 
Paragraph 4.5.1 of NPS EN-1 states that good 
design for energy infrastructure ‘should produce 
sustainable infrastructure sensitive to place, efficient 
in the use of natural resources and energy used in 
their construction and operation, matched by an 
appearance that demonstrates good aesthetic as far 
as possible.’  However, paragraph 4.5.1 of NPS EN-1 
also acknowledges that ‘the nature of much energy 
infrastructure development will often limit the extent 
to which it can contribute to the enhancement of the 
quality of the area.’ 
1.2.10. In Wales, TAN 12 ‘Design’ in conjunction with chapter 
4 of Planning Policy Wales (PPW) may be of relevance 
to the determination of the DCO Application. This 
Technical Advice Note (TAN) sets out the objectives of 
good design and aims to encourage good design in all 
aspects of development, stating that: ‘The way which 
development relates to its urban or rural landscape 
context is critical to its success’. The aim should be to 
achieve good design solutions, which maximise the 
natural landscape assets and minimise environmental 
impact on the landscape. It is particularly important 
that proposals to amend or create new landscape 
are not considered as an afterthought and that the 
long term impact of development on the landscape 
is understood.
1.2.11. Paragraph 4.5.3 of NPS EN-1 seeks that proposals 
are “sustainable and, having regard to regulatory 
and other constraints, are as attractive, durable and 
adaptable (including taking account of natural hazards

of designing in relation to place, natural resources 
and aesthetic, and reasons for design choices are 
set out in: Environmental Statement (Document 
Reference 6.1), specifically chapters 5, 8, 9, 11, 12, 
13, and the Flood Consequences Assessment (ES 
Appendix 9.1 (Document Reference 6.2, including 
Appendix E Outline Drainage Strategy), the Outline 
Construction Environment Management Plan (CEMP) 
(ES Appendix 3.1, Document Reference 6.2), the 
Outline Landscape and Ecology Mitigation Strategy 
(ES Appendix 3.4, Document Reference 6.2) and the 
Outline Landscape and Ecology Mitigation Plan (ES 
Figure 3.6, Document Reference 6.3).

Selected a site that minimises resources used in 
construction, and selected technology with low water 
use and which are durable for the proposed 25-
year use and capable of being dismantled/recycled 
and the site restored; undertaken assessments 
and proposed layouts, finishes and screening that 
minimise impacts on adjacent land uses, accesses 
and habitats. In these respects the siting of the 
Project is considered to perform well on the range 
of sustainability related grounds. The process of 
designing a sustainable Project which is attractive, 
durable and adaptable,  and the reasons for design 
choices are set out in Environmental Statement 
(Document Reference 6.1), specifically chapter 5 
on alternative sites and connections; the Outline 
CEMP (ES Appendix 3.1, Document Reference 6.2) 
and the Outline Landscape and Ecology Mitigation 
Strategy (ES Figure 3.6, Document Reference 6.3); 
the Photographs and Photomontages (Document 
Reference 7.1); and the Consultation Report 
(Document Reference 5.1.0), specifically sections 10 
and 11 documenting the influences of consultation 
responses on the design. 
such as flooding) as they can be”.   Further, Paragraph 
4.5.3 of NPS EN-1 states that “Whilst the applicant 
may not have any or very limited choice in the physical 
appearance of some energy infrastructure, there may 
be opportunities for the applicant to demonstrate 
good design in terms of siting relative to existing 
landscape character, landform and vegetation.” 
1.2.12. Paragraph 4.5.4 of NPS EN-1 seeks that the decision-
maker takes into account the ultimate purpose of the 
infrastructure and bear in mind the operational, safety 
and security requirements which the design has to 
satisfy.
1.2.13. Paragraph 4.5.5 of NPS EN-1 states that “applicants 
are encouraged” to use Design Review services such 
as those by CABE. The equivalent body in Wales is 
the Design Commission for Wales (DCfW). 
1.2.14. In summary, in accordance with paragraphs 4.5.1, 
4.5.3 and 4.5.4 of NPS EN-1, and where relevant 
TAN 12, the applicant has:

1.3  Project Site Location
1.3.1. The Project Site is situated on open land and will be 
accessed from Junction 46 of the M4 to the north 
of Swansea, in the administrative area of the City 
and County of Swansea Council. It is approximately 
1 km southeast of Felindre and 1.4 km north of 
Llangyfelach.
1.3.2. The closest residential dwelling to the Generating 
Equipment Site is Maes-eglwys, 440m South of the 
Generating Equipment Site.
1.3.3. The area surrounding the Project Site is partly 
rural with some existing and planned urban fringe 
development (e.g. Park and Ride Facilities) together 
with a substantial amount of utilities infrastructure .
1.3.4. The current land use is predominantly agricultural, with 
sheep and horse grazing. The Generating Equipment 
Site is located primarily within fields used for grazing, 
bounded by a mixture of drainage ditches, fencing 
and poor quality hedgerows with substantial gaps in 
them. 
1.3.5. The Gas Connection is located north of the 
Generating Equipment Site crossing open land. The 
Electrical Connection is located to the south west 
of the Generating Equipment Site linking in to the 
existing Swansea North Substation. 
1.3.6. South of the Project Site lies the M4 motorway running 
in a west-east direction separating the Project Site 
and the northern extent of Greater Swansea.  The M4 
connects London and Llanelli via the major cities of 
South Wales, Swansea, Neath and Cardiff via Bristol 
and Heathrow airport. 
1.3.7. From the M4 access to the Project Site is from the 
west via the B4489 utilising the existing National Grid 
road and then via agricultural land to the west of the 
Generating Equipment Site and land following the 
southern boundary of the Felindre Gas Compressor 
Station.
1.3.8. The approximate centre of the Project Site lies at grid 
reference 265284, 201431.

The proposed buildings, structures and perimeter security fencing shall be of high quality design. 
Materials used for cladding shall above all need to be durable and functional, as appropriate for 25 
years operation in a power station environment.
The design should be such that it minimises visual impact and blends with the background and 
foreground as far as possible, with recessive colouring.
Consideration should be given to cladding in scale & grades of colour appropriate to the local sur- 
rounding backdrop, to minimise visibility from medium distance views and beyond.
Stack height shall be minimised to 35m -45m and will not be illuminated or contain signage unless 
for safety / operational requirements.

Built Form, Uses & Activities
The Power Generation Plant Site shall 
be laid out and maintained in a safe and 
attractive manner and which supports 
a positive public perception of the 
operation.
The main entrance shall have clear but unobtrusive signage in keeping with the rural surroundings.
Vehicle parking, storage areas and smaller structures shall be laid out and screened so as to 
minimise visual impact to local footpath users and improve the safety and perception of safety of the 
site operation.
The CEMP shall include measures for the maintenance of a tidy and contained site compound during 
construction.
06
Built Form, Uses & Activities
Lighting shall be appropriate to the 
local context and avoid lighting impacts 
upon  identified  habitats,  neighbouring 
occupiers, and the wider landscape.
The overarching philosophy underpinning the design of the lighting for the project during its 
operation is to maintain the existing rural, low brightness lighting zone. Only critical light sources 
such as emergency exit illumination and security lighting at low level will remain on during the night. 
Surrounding screening and a scheme of lighting in accordance with the Outline Lighting Strategy 
shall minimise detrimental visual and environmental impacts. This will include appropriate placing, 
directionality, and technology of lighting and a preference for a greater number of lower level building 
mounted lamps over a fewer number of taller lamps.
During construction, use of artificial lighting shall be minimised but safety shall be paramount. The 
outline CEMP shall govern the provision of lighting and mitigation of temporary lighting impacts.
Dark area around existing tree and shrub planting along northern boundaries of Generating Equipment 
Site to provide commuting habitat for bats and other nocturnal species.
05
Built Form, Uses & Activities
Stack should be designed at a height 
which causes minimum visual impact
whilst   also   allowing   for   adequate 
dispersion of stack emissions.
The height of all plant should be minimised. The design of the project utilises technology (OGCT) 
that allows a significant reduction in stack height compared to other technology types. Stack shall 
be minimised to 35m - 45m and shall not be illuminated or contain signage or branding unless 
necessary for a recognised safety / operational requirement.

Inherently quiet plant items shall be selected wherever practicable. Again, where practical, silencers 
shall be used, and consideration will be given to housing plant items in acoustic enclosures. 
07
Built Form, Uses & Activities
Consideration  shall  be  given  to  the 
most appropriate choice of materials.
Materials should be agreed with the

Landscape,  Environment  & 
Ecology
Minimise impacts on existing habitats 
and species within the Project Site.
The design of landscape planting should enhance the area’s biodiversity through: the retention and 
reinforcement of existing trees and bushes where practical; the planting of belts of broadleaved 
woodland and hedgerow to increase the amount of natural green landscape in the area; and careful 
management of soils.
New or replacement ponds and other water features shall be maintained during construction and 
operation. 
Landscape,  Environment  & 
Ecology
Reinstate  the  routes  of  the  Gas 
Pipeline with appropriate planting for 
their wider and local landscape and 
habitat setting, taking into account the 
need to avoid damage from roots.
In the vicinity of the final route of the Gas Pipeline, reinstatement planting shall follow National Grid 
guidance “Trees and Vegetation near Gas Pipelines” and shall comprise only shallow-rooting tree/
shrub species should be used in order to avoid interfering with the installed Gas Pipeline.
Landscape,  Environment  & 
Ecology
The use of soft landscaping should be 
maximised within the Power Generation 
Plant Site where safety and operational 
considerations allow.
Planting within the Power Generation Plant Site should be used to enhance and reinforce the 
character of the surrounding area. 
Screen planting to be created to the west of the Generating Equipment Site. 
The design of perimeter planting and security fencing along the south side of the Generating 
Equipment Site should provide a ‘soft’ edge and screen potential views from surrounding footpaths.
Mixed hedgerow and tree planting to the south of the new section of Access Road will provide 
vegetation structure and commuting corridors for bats, as well as integrating the new Access Road 
into the immediate landscape structure.

1.7  Design Response : Initial Design Approach
1.7.1. At the outset of the Project, a number 
of different engineering and plant 
options were considered. The initial 
design response in absence of a 
finalised engineering solution was 
to consider (as is typical of many 
similar NSIP projects of this nature) a 
development “envelope” enclosure for 
the various plant components. This 
approach would provide a degree of 
flexibility to arrange the components 
with the Order Limits. It would also 
allow engineering optioneering to 
continue and broad concepts for 
visual screening to be developed. 
1.7.2. The 
design 
concept 
graphics 
adjacent indicate the initial approach 
adopted to address and minimise the 
visual impact of an enclosure within 
an integrated design landscape to 
mitigate/filter views. The architectural 
design intention visually was that the 
building colour, materiality and texture 
would be informed by features in the 
surrounding and distance landscape. 
1.7.3. Sheppard Robson carried out a 
detailed study of the landscape 
character not only in the near vicinity 
of the Project Site, but also in a 
wider study area taking in Felindre, 
Llangyfelach, 
Cwmrhydyceirw 
and 
stretching out further in all directions to 
investigate and more closely understand 
the texture and mix of colour and tones 
in the environment that could then be 
translated into the enclosure elevations. 
The mixture of tones and colours would 
also have to be representative, as much 
as possible, of the changing seasons 
in and around the site. The graphics 
(to the right) demonstrate in more detail 
how this analysis translates into colour 
contrast and tones.
1.7.4. Various surrounding and long distance 
photographs 
were 
taken, 
then 
broken down into a pixelation of the 
representative colours. From this, the 
predominant and highlight colours were 
established, along with matching tones 
that could then be tested in the facade 
cladding of the proposed enclosure. 
Not only colour combinations were 
investigated, but also the orientation of 
panels, and size of panels to achieve 
a scale and harmony with the existing 
backdrop landscape.

1.8  Design Response : Built Form
1.8.1. As the continual review of various engineering/
plant options progressed through the early design 
development stages, the necessity for design flexibility 
became a primary consideration.  As a consequence 
of this, the decision was taken to pursue a ‘Rochdale 
Envelope’ type engineering solution approach. 
This approach requires that the various plant and 
buildings are strategically planned out on the site and 
negate the requirement to house everything in an 
envelope enclosure. The various plant as indicated 
on the adjacent page range in scale and type from 
gas turbine generator and stack, to water tanks and 
other small scale buildings.  
1.8.2. This siting of the various items of plant and buildings 
has to ensure efficient and safe working arrangements 
and direct routes for gas and electrical connections 
with minimum disruption. At the same time, the 
strategic siting of the various different items of plant 
and buildings can be planned to address a number 
of other environmental and visual impact type criteria. 
As the various plant and buildings are planned and 
separated out on the site as opposed to the large 
envelope enclosure approach, the visual impact is 
reduced immediately and the ability to address any 
other key issues such as noise sensitive receptors 
is improved. Interrupted views towards the site and 
beyond can be minimised by this separating out and 
careful planning of the larger pieces of engineering 
plant such as the gas turbine stack. 
1.8.3. The design concept intention developed for the 
‘envelope enclosure’ approach would be maintained 
but then adopted for the various buildings and 
engineering plant components around the site. 
1.8.4. The colour response would take reference from 
the immediate rural surroundings and more distant 
landscape context. From this sampling, the horizontal 
strata and bands of landscape colour are established, 
taken from foreground all the way to the backdrop of 
the distant hills and sky.
1.8.5. Detailed studies of the landscape were undertaken 
as indicated on the previous pages (19, 20). These 
studies were then translated into elevational studies. 
The mixture of tones would also be representative of 
changing seasons in and around the wider area of 
Abergelli and Felindre. 
1.8.6. The 
graphics 
demonstrate 
how 
this 
analysis 
translates into colour contrast and tones. Particular 
photographs were taken from within the Project 
Site looking out to the countryside then broken this 
into a pixilation of the colours. From these colours 
along with colour matching, horizontal strata were 
established that can be applied to the various plant 
components from base to top.
