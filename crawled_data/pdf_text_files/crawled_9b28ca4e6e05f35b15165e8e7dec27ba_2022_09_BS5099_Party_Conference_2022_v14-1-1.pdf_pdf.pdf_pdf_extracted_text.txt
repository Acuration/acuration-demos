The Challenge Ahead
Global events of 2022 have necessitated 
stark warnings to governments and 
economies the world over. The war in 
Ukraine has highlighted the volatility 
of the global energy supply and the 
importance of generating reliable and 
renewable power for British homes and 
businesses. 
Now more than ever, the UK must invest 
in renewables to ensure security of supply 
and energy resilience. Producing energy 
domestically is the best way to support 
energy security – with the additional 
benefits of creating jobs and boosting 
opportunities across the country. 
Which is why it is encouraging to see 
Government making progress on a 
solution to support security of supply  
and achieve net zero targets – while, at 
the same time, presenting an opportunity 
for the UK to lead the world in pioneering, 
climate-saving technology. 
Drax is ready to invest £2.5bn in 
renewable energy technologies, including 
bioenergy with carbon capture and 
storage (BECCS) – the only carbon 
removal technology that generates 
renewable electricity. This means BECCS 
supports energy security, while also 
removing millions of tonnes of CO2 from 
the atmosphere. 
In July 2022, after two consultations and 
ongoing community engagement, Drax 
submitted its planning application for 
BECCS – an important delivery milestone. 
If approved, the BECCS project at our 
North Yorkshire power station could start 
capturing millions of tonnes of CO2 as 
soon as 2027, permanently storing those 
emissions in geological formations under 
the North Sea.
We’re ready to deliver; we have already 
started building our supply chain with two 
supplier engagements in 2022 attracting 
600 businesses from the Humber and 
Teesside. Drax has also signed a landmark 
MOU with British Steel to explore 
opportunities to supply UK steel for  
the project.
Government is also making encouraging 
progress on BECCS, with the launch 
of a business model consultation and 
project submission process for BECCS 
technology. 
BECCS is the most cost-effective carbon 
removal technology. It will also sustain 
and create over 10,000 green jobs in the 
North and put the UK at the forefront 
of a climate solution that will be needed 
globally to decarbonise economies and 
support energy security. 
Deploying BECCS at Drax could save 
the UK over £26bn to reach its net zero 
target. Half of that saving – £13bn – will 
come this decade 1. And with the right 
government support and investment 
framework, Drax will capture eight 
million tonnes of CO2 with BECCS – 
delivering the world’s biggest carbon 
capture project in power and a significant 
proportion of carbon removals that the 
UK needs to reach net zero. 
With the right policies to unlock 
investment, Britain can lead the world in 
a technology which is urgently needed 
to prevent catastrophic climate change 
and deliver clean, secure, lower-cost 
energy. 
We’re asking for your support in making 
BECCS at Drax a reality. Back BECCS at 
Drax to support energy security; create 
jobs and opportunities for the North and 
make the UK a world leader in fighting the 
climate crisis.
Securing the UK’s Energy Supply
Today, Drax is proud to generate 11% of  
the UK’s renewable electricity – more than  
any other generator – across our UK sites 
including Drax Power Station in Selby, 
Yorkshire and Cruachan Power Station in 
Scotland. We play a critical role in ensuring the 
country’s security of supply while supporting 
almost 18,000 jobs across the UK directly and 
through our supply chain. 
Drax helps keep the lights on when the wind 
doesn’t blow and the sun doesn’t shine. 
Unlike wind or solar, our sites provide clean, 
dispatchable power whatever the weather – 
supporting grid stability and flexibility.
Now more than ever, the UK needs to invest 
in domestic security of supply, while also 
decarbonising the grid and meeting climate 
targets. There is only one technology which 
can generate reliable and renewable electricity, 
all while removing carbon dioxide from the 
earth’s atmosphere – it is called Bioenergy 
with Carbon Capture and Storage (BECCS). 
This technology has already been trialled 
and proven at Drax. Now, we’re ready to go 
further and begin our next chapter – through 
delivering BECCS at scale at our North 
Yorkshire site. BECCS is proven technology 
which will remove millions of tonnes of carbon 
from the atmosphere and create local, national 
and global opportunities.  
Scaling up BECCS will get the UK to net zero 
faster and at least cost. BECCS kickstarts a 
new green economy in the Humber, supporting 
10,000 jobs and creating opportunities across 
the North. BECCS allows the UK to get ahead 
in the global race to lead in carbon removals. 
Crucially, it’s shovel ready and will start 
delivering jobs and growth before the next 
election.

Different negative emissions solutions that exist today
Bioenergy with carbon capture and storage is the process of 
capturing and permanently storing carbon dioxide (CO2) that is 
generated during the production of electricity from sustainable 
biomass. This is the only carbon removal technology that also 
generates low carbon renewable power. 
Direct air capture (DAC) technologies extract CO2 directly from the 
atmosphere using either liquid or solid sorbents. While this could offer 
huge potential, the technology is currently in its infancy and requires 
substantial investment to make it a more widespread practice. It also 
requires vast amounts of zero carbon power to operate.
Natural climate solutions use natural processes and carbon sinks 
to remove CO2. Examples include reforestation, where new trees 
absorb and store carbon as they grow and seagrasses (vegetation 
underwater) which can store up to twice as much carbon dioxide as 
forests on land.

Negative emissions solutions are crucial in order to:
 Neutralise residual, hard-to-abate emissions, supporting industries 
and jobs whose path to decarbonisation will take longer than other 
sectors, such as agriculture, aviation and heavy industry.
 Reduce carbon dioxide if emissions reductions are not delivered 
quickly enough – giving us security and resilience on the path to  
net zero.
Ensure efforts to achieve net zero are affordable. 
Ensure that achieving net zero does not disadvantage or hold back 
developed and developing economies around the world, which will 
become ever more dependent on access to affordable, reliable power.
 Remove historic emissions already in the atmosphere.

The importance of  
negative emissions
According to the United Nations 
Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, 
negative emissions technologies such as 
BECCS – which remove carbon from the 
atmosphere – could be required to capture  
10 billion tonnes of carbon dioxide annually 
to help prevent catastrophic changes in 
the climate between now and 2050 2. A 
combination of negative emissions solutions, 
including BECCS, DACS and natural climate 
solutions is vital to achieving net zero 3. 
According to the experts, it is BECCS that 
will be the major negative emissions solution 
capable of being deployed to help reach  
net zero by 2050.

Pioneering BECCS to help  
the UK decarbonise
What is BECCS? 
Bioenergy with carbon capture and storage (BECCS) 
is the process of capturing and permanently storing 
carbon dioxide (CO2) from biomass (organic matter) 
energy generation. Using BECCS, Drax aims to be a 
carbon negative company by 2030.

Drax's BECCS project uses carbon capture technology. 
Some of the key components used for BECCS are:
 1  
 Sustainably sourced wood biomass pellets are burned, producing high-pressured 
steam that drives electricity-generating turbines.
  2  
 The flue gases, which would ordinarily be released into the atmosphere,  
are treated to remove any harmful pollutants.
  3  
 The CO2 produced is then captured – solvents, which are re-used, isolate the  
CO2 from the remaining flue gases.
  4  
 The captured CO2 is pressurised and turned into a liquid-like substance that  
can then be transported by pipeline. At least eight million tonnes of CO2 can  
be captured and stored every year using this technology.
  This liquidised CO2 can then be safely and  
permanently injected into naturally occurring porous 
rock formations (unused natural gas reservoirs, 
coal beds or saline aquifers), in a process known as 
sequestration. The UK has the capacity to potentially 
hold 70 billion tonnes of CO2 under its seabed. 4

Helping the UK lead the way  
in negative emissions
Developing BECCS at Drax would put 
the UK at the forefront of developing and 
exporting a vital technology needed to 
combat climate change.
The UK can seize this unique opportunity 
to lead the world in BECCS technology 
and tackle the climate crisis – as long 
as we move quickly. In backing BECCS, 
the UK government will be prioritising 
decarbonisation, keeping the costs of net 
zero down for hardworking families and 
backing new British technology which 
can be exported worldwide.
BECCS is increasingly being explored 
and deployed around the world at 
heat and power stations, factories and 
waste-to-energy plants as countries and 
organisations aim to achieve net zero 
through negative emissions.  
The US is ramping up their research and 
development of BECCS; the landmark 
Inflation Reduction Act demonstrated the 
vital need for biomass and BECCS in the 
view of the US Government.
Other countries have recognised the 
importance and scalability of this 
technology and are either piloting or 
developing BECCS. If the UK wants to 
gain first mover advantage and be seen as 
leading the world in negative emissions, 
there must be bold and urgent action to 
get behind this crucial technology. 
We want to play our part. At Drax, we 
stand ready to invest to scale up BECCS 
and put the UK at the forefront of global 
efforts to reach net zero emissions. 
Driving up standards with  
the right biomass
Drax is taking bold action and making 
significant investment around the world 
to realise a positive future. 
The right biomass, as used at Drax Power 
Station, is a critical tool in the fight against 
climate change, in ensuring energy 
security and in achieving net zero:
 
 The right biomass protects and 
creates jobs in communities 
across the world most at risk 
in the green transition, while 
keeping the lights on for 
households and businesses.
 
 The right biomass supports 
healthy, growing forests.
 
 The right biomass helps get 
the world off coal and enables 
the removal of carbon from the 
atmosphere. All while helping 
the world to get to net zero 
faster and while supporting 
energy security.
The world needs biomass, but only in  
the right way. That’s why we have 
rigorous monitoring, scrutiny and 
transparency to ensure our biomass 
meets the highest standards. 
In 2019, an Independent Advisory 
Board was established. It comprises 
scientists and forestry experts led by 
former UK Chief Scientific Adviser 
Sir John Beddington to peer review 
Drax’s transition to net zero and our 
use of sustainable biomass. The IAB 
scrutinised Drax’s biomass sustainability 
and found that Its sourcing policy is in 
line with the UK Forest Research report 
recommendations.
We have gone further, also. Alongside 
the Earthworm Foundation, we have 
developed the Healthy Forest Landscape, 
a data and evidence-led approach that 
evaluates forest health, carbon stock, 
biodiversity and community wellbeing.
Drax stands ready to help raise standards 
across the sector, around the world 
because we know the right biomass can 
deliver climate, people and nature positive 
outcomes.
