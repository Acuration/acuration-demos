Notice under Section 56 Planning Act 2008 and Regulation 9 The Infrastructure Planning (Applications: Prescribed Forms and Procedure) 
Regulations 2009 
 
Notice of acceptance of an application for a Development Consent Order for the Millbrook Gas Fired Generating Station Order 
 
Planning Inspectorate reference: EN010068 
 
 
1. 
Notice is hereby given that the Secretary of State for Business Energy and Industrial Strategy (“Secretary of State”) has accepted an application 
for a Development Consent Order (“DCO”) made by Millbrook Power Limited (“MPL”) of Drax Power Station, Drax, Selby, North Yorkshire, YO8 
8PH under the Planning Act 2008 (the “Application”). The Application was submitted to the Secretary of State (via the Planning Inspectorate) on 
Monday 23
rd October 2017 and accepted for examination on Monday 20
th November 2017. The reference number applied by the Planning 
Inspectorate, on behalf of the Secretary of State, to the Application is EN010068. 
 
2. 
The Application seeks consent for the construction, operation and maintenance of an up to 299 Megawatts (MW) gas fired peaking power 
generation plant and associated electrical and gas connections on land at the former clay extraction pit, Rookery South, Stewartby, Bedfordshire, 
England (the Project).  
 
3. 
The Project would comprise the following elements: 
 
§ 
a new Power Generation Plant in the form of an Open Cycle Gas Turbine (OCGT) peaking power generating station, fuelled by natural gas 
with a rated electrical output of up to 299 MW.  This is the output of the generating station as a whole, measured at the terminals of the 
generating equipment. The Power Generation Plant comprises: 
- 
generating equipment including one Gas Turbine Generator with one exhaust gas flue stack and Balance of Plant (together 
referred to as the ‘Generating Equipment’), which are located within the ‘Generating Equipment Site’; 
- 
a new purpose built access road from Green Lane to the Generating Equipment Site (the ‘Access Road’ or the ‘Short Access 
Road’);  
- 
a temporary construction compound required during construction only (the ‘Laydown Area’); 
§ 
a new underground gas pipeline connection, approximately 1.8 km in length (the ‘Pipeline’) to bring natural gas to the Generating Equipment 
from the National Transmission System (the ‘Gas Connection’). The Gas Connection also incorporates an Above Ground Installation (AGI) 
at the point of connection to the National Transmission System; and 
§ 
a new electrical connection to export power from the Generating Equipment to the National Grid Electricity Transmission System (NETS) 
(the ‘Electrical Connection’), comprising an underground double circuit Tee-in. This would require one new tower (which will replace an 
existing tower and be located in the existing Grendon – Sundon transmission route corridor, thereby resulting in no net additional towers). 
The Electrical Connection also includes two Sealing End Compounds (SECs), one located on each side of the existing transmission line, 
and both circuits would then be connected via underground cables approximately 500 m in length to a new substation (the ‘Substation’). 
 
4. 
The Generating Equipment, Access Road and Laydown Area are together known as the “Power Generation Plant” and are located within the 
“Power Generation Plant Site”. The Power Generation Plant Site is approximately 12.5 ha in area. 
 
5. 
The Power Generation Plant, Gas Connection, and Electrical Connection, together with all access requirements are referred to as the ‘Project’. 
The land upon which the Project would be developed, or which would be required in order to facilitate the development of the Project, is referred 
to as the ‘Project Site’. The Project Site is approximately 48 ha in area. 
 
6. 
The DCO will, if granted, authorise the construction, operation and maintenance of the Project and would, amongst other things, make provision 
for the following: 
 
a) 
The compulsory acquisition by MPL of land and rights over land including the power to create new rights and impose restrictive covenants 
over land, required for the Project and the power to take possession of and use land temporarily for the purpose of constructing, operating 
and maintaining the Project. 
b) 
The suspension or extinguishment of private rights or restrictive covenants over land required for the construction, operation and 
maintenance of the Project; 
c) 
Tree and hedge removal along the routes of the Electrical Connection and the Gas Connection; 
d) 
Landscaping and ecological mitigation works; 
e) 
Alterations to the public highway network and the construction of temporary and permanent accesses to the Project as described in the 
Application; 
f) 
The temporary stopping up or management of the public highway and public rights of way and street works as described in the Application; 
and 
g) 
The application and/or disapplication of legislation relevant to the Project as described in the Application. 
 
Environmental Impact Assessment (EIA) 
 
7. 
Due to its nature and size, the Project is classified as EIA development under the Infrastructure Planning (Environmental Impact Assessment) 
Regulations 2009 (EIA Regulations 2009). This means that the Proposed Development constitutes development for which an Environmental 
Impact Assessment ("EIA") is required. The Application is therefore accompanied by an Environmental Statement. It should be noted that the 
Project falls under the EIA Regulations 2009 regime and not the Infrastructure Planning (Environmental Impact Assessment) Regulations 2017 
(EIA Regulations 2017) regime. This is because a scoping opinion was requested from the Secretary of State under the EIA Regulations 2009 
before the commencement of the EIA Regulations 2017. This means that, in accordance with the transitional arrangements at Regulation 37 of 
the EIA Regulations 2017, the EIA Regulations 2009 will continue to apply to the Project.
