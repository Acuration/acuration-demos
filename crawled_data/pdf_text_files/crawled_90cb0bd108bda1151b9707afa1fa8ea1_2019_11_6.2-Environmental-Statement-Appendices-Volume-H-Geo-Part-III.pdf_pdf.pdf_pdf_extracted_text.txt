Information from the Coal Authority
Underground coal mining
Past
The property is in the likely zone of influence from workings in 3 seams of coal at shallow to 380m
depth, and last worked in 1986.
Present
The property is not in the likely zone of influence of any present underground coal workings.
Future
The property is not in an area for which the Coal Authority is determining whether to grant a
licence to remove coal using underground methods.
The property is not in an area for which a licence has been granted to remove or otherwise work
coal using underground methods.
The property is not in an area that is likely to be affected at the surface from any planned future
workings.
However, reserves of coal exist in the local area which could be worked at some time in the
future.
No notice of the risk of the land being affected by subsidence has been given under section 46 of
the Coal Mining Subsidence Act 1991.
Mine entries

Within, or within 20 metres of, the boundary of the property there are 2 mine entries, the
approximate positions of which are shown on the attached plan.
There is no record of what steps, if any, have been taken to treat the mine entries.
Records may be incomplete. Consequently, there may exist in the local area mine entries of
which the Coal Authority has no knowledge.
For an additional fee, the Coal Authority will provide a supplementary Mine Entry Interpretive
Report.  The report will provide a separate assessment for the mine entry (entries) referred to in
this report. It will give details based on information in the Coal Authority's possession, together
with an opinion on the likelihood of mining subsidence damage arising from ground movement as
a consequence of the existence of the mine entry/entries. It will also give details of the remedies
available for subsidence damage where the mine entry was sunk in connection with coal mining.
Please note that it may not be possible to produce a report if the main building to the property
cannot be identified from Coal Authority plans (ie. for development sites and new build).
For further advice on how to order this additional information visit www.groundstability.com or
telephone 0845 7626 848.
Coal mining geology
The Authority is not aware of any evidence of damage arising due to geological faults or other
lines of weakness that have been affected by coal mining.
Opencast coal mining
Past
The property is not within the boundary of an opencast site from which coal has been removed
by opencast methods.
Present
The property does not lie within 200 metres of the boundary of an opencast site from which coal
is being removed by opencast methods.
Future
The property is not within 800 metres of the boundary of an opencast site for which the Coal
Authority is determining whether to grant a licence to remove coal by opencast methods.
The property is not within 800 metres of the boundary of an opencast site for which a licence to
remove coal by opencast methods has been granted.
Coal mining subsidence
A damage notice or claim for alleged subsidence damage was made in November 1996 for
ABERGELLI FARM, FELINDRE, SWANSEA, SA5 7NN. However, the claim was rejected.
There is no current Stop Notice delaying the start of remedial works or repairs to the property.
A damage notice or claim for alleged subsidence damage was made in June 1995 for
ABERGELLI FARM, FELINDRE, SWANSEA, WEST GLAMORGAN, SA5 7NN. However, the
claim was rejected.
There is no current Stop Notice delaying the start of remedial works or repairs to the property.
The Authority is not aware of any request having been made to carry out preventive works before
coal is worked under section 33 of the Coal Mining Subsidence Act 1991.
If further subsidence damage claims information is required in addition to that provided in this
report, the Authority need to manually search their records. For further advice on how to order this
additional information visit www.groundstability.com or telephone 0845 7626 848.
Mine gas
There is no record of a mine gas emission requiring action by the Coal Authority within the
boundary of the property.
Hazards related to coal mining
The property has been subject to remedial works, by or on behalf of the Authority, under its
Emergency Surface Hazard Call Out procedures.

The property is not in an area for which a relevant notice has been published under the Coal
Industry Act 1975/Coal Industry Act 1994.
Comments on Coal Authority information
The attached plan shows the approximate location of the disused mine entry/entries referred to in
this report.  For reasons of clarity, mine entry symbols may not be drawn to the same scale as the
plan.
Property owners have the benefit of statutory protection (under the Coal Mining Subsidence act
1991*). This contains provision for the making good, to the reasonable satisfaction of the owner,
of physical damage from disused coal mine workings including disused coal mine entries.  A
leaflet setting out the rights and the obligations of either the Coal Authority or other responsible
persons under the 1991 Act can be obtained by telephoning 0845 762 6848 or online at
www.coal.decc.gov.uk/en/coal/cms/services/claims.
If you wish to discuss the relevance of any of the information contained in this report you should
seek the advice of a qualified mining engineer or surveyor.  If you or your adviser wish to examine
the source plans from which the information has been taken these are normally available at our
Mansfield office, free of charge, by prior appointment, telephone 01623 637235.  Should you or
your adviser wish to carry out any physical investigations that may enter, disturb or interfere with
any disused mine entry the prior permission of the owner must be sought.  For coal mine entries
the owner will normally be the Coal Authority.
The Coal Authority, regardless of responsibility and in conjunction with other public bodies,
provide an emergency call out facility in coalfield areas to assess the public safety implications of
mining features (including disused mine entries).  Our emergency telephone number at all times is
01623 646333.
*Note, this Act does not apply where coal was worked or gotten by virtue of the grant of a gale in
the Forest of Dean, or any other part of the Hundred of St. Briavels in the county of Gloucester.
In view of the mining circumstances a prudent developer would seek appropriate technical advice
before any works are undertaken.
Therefore if  development proposals are being considered, technical advice relating to both the
investigation of coal and former coal mines and their treatment should be obtained before
beginning work on site. All proposals should apply good engineering practice developed for
mining areas. No development should be undertaken that intersects, disturbs or interferes with
any coal or mines of coal without the permission of the Coal Authority. Developers should be
aware that the investigation of coal seams/former mines of coal may have the potential to
generate and/or displace underground gases and these risks both under and adjacent to the
development should be fully considered in developing any proposals.  The need for effective
measures to prevent gases entering into public properties either during investigation or after
development also needs to be assessed and properly addressed.  This is necessary due to the
public safety implications of any development in these circumstances.
