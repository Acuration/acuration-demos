1.  Headlines
The last decade has seen unprecedented changes in the 
power system, so we dedicate this issue of Electric Insights 
to looking at ‘the ten years of transition’. 2019 was as a 
dramatic year for Britain’s power system. It faced the  
most serious blackout for a decade, saw offshore wind 
become cheaper than wholesale power, and renewables 
produce more output than fossil fuels for much of the 
year. Despite fears that low-carbon generation had stalled 
in 2019, we reveal that carbon emissions fell once again,  
by a staggering 14% on the previous year.
2019 also marked a major turning point for energy and the 
environment. Climate change has grabbed mainstream 
attention as fires raged across Australia and the Amazon. 
Glasgow was selected to host the COP26 intergovernmental 
climate conference this coming November, putting the UK 
front and centre of the global energy transition. Now is a 
critical time to show environmental leadership.
Thankfully, Britain’s power sector is rapidly moving in the 
right direction. Our first article looks back over the last  
ten years of transition. In 2019, the average carbon 
intensity of Britain’s electricity fell below 200 g/kWh for 
the first time ever, ending the decade 60% lower than 
at the start. Renewables continued to grow and coal 
retreated to less than 2% of supply. However, Britain’s 
weather is also moving into new territory, with heat waves 
becoming ever-more common, pushing up peak summer 
temperatures by 5 degrees Celsius.
We then look back over the past century of electricity 
generation to put this decade into context. Britain’s  
power system is being transformed at never-before-seen 
speed. Next, we turn to the decade ahead of us, looking at 
what predictions we can make about the 2020s with some 
confidence, and what things are just impossible  
to forecast.
Article 5 looks at which elements of last decade’s transition 
contributed the most to decarbonisation, and how they 
impacted on power prices. New analysis shows how coal 
phase-out, the growth of renewables and increasing carbon 
prices have impacted the environment and the economy.
Finally, we begin a series of primers in the run up to 
COP26 which take a broader view on how Britain’s clean 
electricity can contribute to decarbonising other sectors 
of the economy. This quarter, we look at the options for 
tackling heat production, and a new milestone for clean 
electric heating. 
This issue concludes with the capacity and production 
statistics for Quarter 4 of 2019, and a review of the British 
power system records.

2.  Britain’s decade of decarbonisation
Looking back over the last decade, Britain’s power system 
has changed beyond recognition. Carbon emissions from 
electricity consumption fell by almost two-thirds, the 
fastest rate of decarbonisation anywhere in the world. 
Emissions fell 14% in the last year alone, quelling fears that 
low-carbon generation has stalled. 
Electricity generation added 2.6 tonnes of CO2 to every Brit’s 
carbon footprint back in 2010. Last year, that fell below  
1 tonne for the first time since the 1940s. A major cause of 
this has been reducing our reliance on coal and gas.
Generation from fossil fuels fell every single year during 
the decade, and last year was no exception with an 8% 
fall from 2018. Britain’s power system now burns half as 
much fossil fuel as it did in 2010, saving the equivalent of 
32 million tonnes of oil each year.2 This is roughly the total 
consumption of all cars, vans and lorries on Britain’s roads. 
Given that 40% of the UK’s fossil fuels are imported, this has 
a significant impact on the country’s trade deficit, reducing 
our energy import bill by around £3.6 billion each year.
In contrast, output from renewables has grown every year, 
with output in 2019 being more than eight times higher 
than in 2010. The capacity of wind, solar, biomass and 
hydro has grown six-fold in that time, from 5.2 GW in 2010 
to 38.5 GW in 2019.
Electricity demand has fallen steadily over the decade 
even though the population has grown 7% and GDP 
risen by a quarter in that time.3 Britain now consumes 
one-eighth less electricity, through a combination of 
shifting economic production, milder winters meaning 
less demand for electric heating, and improving energy 
efficiency. For example, a modern 42” LCD TV has triple 
the screen area of an old 21” square TV, but uses only half 
as much electricity.

This includes the emissions released abroad due to imported electricity and the biomass supply chain. See the Electric Insights methodology page for more detail.

Comparing 2019 to 2010, 38 million tonnes of coal has been saved (equivalent to 23 million tonnes of oil), and 10 billion m3 of natural gas (equivalent to 9 million tonnes of oil). The current market value of these savings is 
approximately £2.2 and £1.4 billion respectively.

Population grew from 62.8 to 66.9 million people, and GDP rose from £1.7 to £2.2 trillion, according to the Office of National Statistics.

3.  The 100 years from coal to clean power
Energy sector transitions are meant to be slow.1 Power stations have long lifetimes and are 
expensive to replace, so it usually takes decades to shift the supply mix. The chart below 
shows how Britain’s power system is rewriting the rule book. The electricity generation mix 
changed more in the 2010s than in the previous ninety years combined.
In previous decades there have been big shifts between fossil fuels, but not away from them. 
The chaos caused by the 1970s oil crises and the 1980s miners’ strikes saw huge swings 
between coal and oil, and expanding gas production in the North Sea drove a rapid switch from 
coal to gas in the 1990s. Overall reliance on fossil fuels has been very hard to shift though. 
Previously, the fastest changes we had seen were in the 1960s and 1980s, both of which 
saw the share of fossil fuels fall by around 10% due to the growth of nuclear power. These 
changes were gradually reversed as nuclear went into decline and demand continued 
growing. Overall, between 1920 and 2010, fossil fuels barely loosened their grip, from 100% 
to 80% of electricity generated. Between 2010 and 2019 they halved to just 40%.
But has this radical change come at a price? Retail prices 
rose 3% faster than inflation over the 2010s, in part due to 
the growing pot of subsidies used to fund new renewable 
investment. For context though, this is half the rate 
of price rises seen during the 2000s; and has brought 
electricity prices back to their long-term average over the 
latter half of the 20th Century. 
If this pace of change can be maintained, renewable 
sources could be providing more than half of Britain’s 
electricity by the end of this decade, and Britain’s power 
system could be practically carbon free.

4.  What to watch in the 2020s
The 2020s are billed as the ten years we have to save the climate. 
What might they have in store for Britain’s power system? The old 
saying goes that predictions are difficult, especially if they’re about 
the future. However, several aspects of the coming decade’s 
transition are already baked in through investment and retirement 
decisions. So, can we already say whether or not the rapid changes  
of the 2010s will continue or not?
Coal phase-out is pretty much certain, and is being actively 
implemented by government. The last coal power station should 
have switched off by 2024, but this could happen as early as 2022 
according to National Grid.1 This is largely symbolic now that coal 
provides only 2% of power, but perhaps it would be useful to keep the 
remaining plants available for times of high system stress. The Beast 
from the East from back in 2018 could have been catastrophic if not 
for the 10 GW of coal plant that came online. It is not the capacity, 
but the energy output which matters to the climate. 
Coal-free runs will become longer and more frequent. No coal power 
stations operated during two-thirds of hours in spring and summer  
of 2019, up from just over one-third in 2018. This coming spring 
could potentially see the first ever month completely free from  
coal generation.
Nuclear output will also decline as every existing reactor except 
for Sizewell B comes up for retirement. The UK’s only new nuclear 
reactor (Hinkley Point C) should come online in the second half of 
the 2020s. Given the extremely long lead times for nuclear new build 
(planning for this reactor began ten years ago), it is relatively certain 
that Britain’s nuclear capacity will halve over the coming decade.
The outlook couldn’t be more different for wind power. Offshore wind 
will grow rapidly during the 2020s, boosted by auctions that have 
delivered record low prices, and government intentions to reach  
40 GW of offshore wind by 2030 (more than quadruple today’s 
capacity). This direction of travel can be said with relative confidence 
as several GW-scale projects have already secured financial support or 
planning permission, but there is wide uncertainty about ultimately 
how large the wind fleet will grow.

Demand minus output from weather-driven renewables and inflexible nuclear (i.e. supply from flexible and dispatchable sources).
The future for onshore wind and solar power is less clear, as the 
withdrawal of government support means new investment depends 
on when (and to what extent) they become profitable on the open 
market. The first such ‘merchant’ projects are already operating or 
under construction, but whether this becomes mainstream depends 
on how quickly technology costs continue to fall and what happens 
to wholesale prices – both of which are highly uncertain. Growth 
of onshore wind will be modest (perhaps half the rate of offshore), 
whereas forecasts for solar power capacity range from almost no 
increase on today’s levels through to capacity more than doubling 
by 2030. In either case, solar will remain relatively small, at less than 
one-tenth of Britain’s annual electricity generation (though a higher 
share of capacity).
The role of gas power stations is already changing from bulk 
electricity production to balancing out variations in wind and solar 
output. Their future depends largely on how much new wind capacity 
is developed. Some of the oldest stations will retire during the 2020s, 
so capacity will decrease slightly unless others are built. The running 
hours of the remaining capacity will likely fall with each passing 
year, but it is impossible to say by how much – reflected in the wide 
uncertainty through the 2020s. The big unknown is when we see the 
transition from zero-coal to the first ever zero-fossil hours.
The other driver of uncertainty is Britain’s trade balance with other 
countries. Several new interconnectors will be built over the coming 
decade, with over 3 GW already under construction. Capacity is 
expected to grow from 5 GW today to between 10 and 20 GW by 
2030, but it is hard to predict whether Britain will remain a net 
importer, or if these links will have balanced two-way trade (as is 
seen currently with Ireland). Investment in grid-scale energy storage 
is one to watch: Britain’s total storage capacity might double or triple 
over the coming decade. This is highly dependent on how rapidly 
costs continue to fall, and whether electric vehicles start to be 
employed as distributed storage through smart charging systems.
Electricity demand may bottom out and then begin growing towards 
the end of the 2020s, or it may continue its gradual decline. This 
depends largely on uptake of electric vehicles and long-term energy 
storage (such as hydrogen). These ‘new’ sources of demand could 
form anything from 1% to 10% of total electricity demand by 2030, 
and represent one of the biggest sources of uncertainty on the 
system’s future.
With demand changing in nature and more than half of supply 
coming from weather-dependent renewables, the “minimum 
headroom” on the system2 will likely hit zero in the next 2–3 years. 
System operability will undoubtedly become more difficult in the 
years to come, and National Grid anticipate being ready for periods of 
zero-carbon generation by 2025.

Many things have helped to reduce Britain’s power sector 
carbon emissions: coal phase-out, new renewables, rising 
carbon prices and falling demand. But how much did each 
of these contribute, and what was their impact on the cost 
of generating electricity?
Two-thirds of coal power stations have retired since 2010 
due to clean air laws, conversion to biomass, or because 
they were simply no longer profitable. These have been 
replaced by over 30 GW of new renewables. Carbon prices 
have trebled,1 as prices on the EU Emissions Trading 
Scheme eventually rose and the UK government added an 
extra £18 per tonne of pollution. All the while, international 
fuel prices have surged and collapsed, and the economy has 
shifted in ways which are beyond anyone’s control.
A national electricity system is not a laboratory, so it is 
not possible to re-run history with some of these changes 
‘switched off’ to find out how important each one was. 
Similarly, each change didn’t happen in a vacuum, they 
all happened together and interacted to amplify or 
constrain one another. The IDLES research programme at 
Imperial College is developing a suite of computer models 
of the power system which allows us to investigate what if 
scenarios.2 What if carbon prices had remained flat; or what 
if all the retired coal power stations were still running?
By testing each possible combination (some 16,000 of 
them) we find out the influence of each change, and its 
‘interaction’ effects from combining with other changes. 
For example, without the rise in carbon prices, coal 
would be cheaper to burn than gas, and without the coal 
retirements and conversions we would be able to burn 
much more coal. The two changes put together have more 
impact than each could have done alone. 
The charts below show how emissions and power prices 
changed between 2010 and 2019, and what influenced 
them. Five changes stand out as having a major effect: 
carbon prices, coal retirements, coal-to-biomass 
conversions, wind capacity and demand reduction.
It should be of little surprise that carbon pricing, coal 
and wind were big drivers. However, these were all 
dwarfed by reductions in demand – reinforcing the 
often-overlooked mantra that efficiency is the ‘first fuel’ 
that should be considered. But, whereas carbon prices 
and coal retirements pushed up wholesale power prices; 
renewables and efficiency improvements reduced them.3  
Demand reductions genuinely pushed down both prices 
and environmental impact: a rare win-win.
This analysis shows us what worked in the past. In the 
decade to come, the power system will change in new 
and different ways. One thing is clear though, there is 
no single silver bullet that delivers the radical change 
required; many changes in many areas must all  
work together.

6.  A major milestone for electric heat
The UK’s ambition for net zero means that all sectors of the energy system must rapidly 
decarbonise. In the run up to COP26 in Glasgow, Electric Insights will look across these 
sectors to discuss how clean electricity can help.
The way we heat our buildings presents a major challenge for reaching net-zero emissions. 
Heat accounts for 80% of the energy consumed in our homes, and is the second largest 
source of CO2 emissions in the UK behind only transport. Unlike the power sector, emissions 
from heating show little sign of reducing because measures to reduce heat demand through 
improving insulation were scrapped, and most of our buildings are still heated by gas boilers 
as alternatives have yet to gain ground. This is about to change though, as from 2025 it will 
be illegal to build new homes which use fossil fuels for heating.
Two low-carbon options for the heating sector are hydrogen and electricity. Both are more 
expensive than natural gas though, so first and foremost it will be critically important to 
improve building thermal efficiency to bring down energy consumption whilst maintaining 
comfort levels.
Hydrogen heating 
Hydrogen has recently gained attention and could be seen 
as the ‘continuity candidate’. It has the benefit of using 
similar appliances to natural gas, so it should feel familiar 
to consumers and require little change to home life. This is 
critically important as for everything to change, we need 
everybody on board.
It should be technically possible to blend 20% hydrogen 
into our current natural gas pipelines, as is being tested at 
Keele University. However, this only gives a 7% reduction 
in methane consumption and carbon emissions, because 
hydrogen is a much lighter and less energy-dense gas. 
Alternatively, we could switch entirely to hydrogen, but 
this would require changing every gas-burning appliance 
in every home. Manufacturers are already offering 
‘hydrogen ready’ boilers, much like the ‘digital ready’ TVs 
that were marketed in the five years before analogue TV 
was turned off. Achieving a complete switchover could 
take decades, but would offer the deep decarbonisation 
that is needed. 
Pure hydrogen is not naturally occurring, so it must be 
manufactured from other molecules. Hydrogen can be 
split out from water (H2O) by electrolysis, or reformed 
from natural gas (CH4). These will only give environmental 
benefits if the electricity is clean, or if the reforming is 
integrated with carbon capture and storage.
Electric heating
Electric heating is already used in around a tenth of 
British houses, primarily electric radiators or night-
storage heaters. Electric heat pumps are a more 
efficient alternative which use the same technology as a 
refrigerator, scaled up to suck heat from the outside air 
or ground (rather than out of your food) and pump it into 
your home. They offer much higher efficiencies, producing 
2–4 units of heat per kWh of electricity consumed, 
referred to as having a coefficient of performance (COP) 
of 2–4. However, homes must be much better insulated 
than is typical in the UK, as heat pumps have lower peak 
power output than gas boilers. Heat pump performance is 
sensitive, so high-quality installation and user education 
are essential (more so than for other technologies).
A large uptake of heat pumps could push up electricity 
demand during peak winter evenings too far, so hybrid 
heat pumps (which combine a small heat pump with a 
boiler for backup) are gaining interest. If these use a 
natural gas boiler, they will also fall short of being zero-
carbon – but this could instead be a hydrogen boiler to 
combine the best of both technology groups.

The rapid changes in Britain’s power system are shifting 
the goal posts for clean heating. Just as we think about 
the carbon intensity of electricity, it is useful to compare 
these technologies on the carbon intensity of the heat 
they produce.
The move towards condensing boilers means the 
efficiency of the UK’s gas boilers is improving over time, 
but too slowly to help with climate change.1 The average 
efficiency of gas heating has risen from 82% to 86% over 
the last decade, meaning that the carbon emissions from 
producing 1 kWh of central heating or hot water only fell 
from 225 grams in 2010 to 215 grams in 2019.
In comparison, standard electric heating would have 
produced 500 grams of CO2 per kWh2 of heat delivered 
back at the start of the decade, more than double that 
from a gas boiler. As electricity production has shifted 
away from fossil fuels, Britain has reached the point where 
it is cleaner to use electric heating than a gas boiler for 
the first time ever.
Averaged over 2019, simple electric heaters produced 
207 grams of CO2 per kWh of heat. We would now have 
to blend 12% hydrogen (by volume) into the mains gas 
grid for Britain’s boilers to be as clean as simple electric 
radiators. As the carbon intensity of electricity continues 
to fall, it will be impossible for hydrogen blending to keep 
pace with the carbon reductions, and only complete 
hydrogen switch-over will have the chance to compete on 
environmental grounds.
Electric heat pumps can boost these savings further, 
offering heat with as little as 50–100 g/kWh. However, 
carbon cannot be the only consideration. Retail electricity 
prices are three times higher than gas (at around  
15 p/kWh versus 5 p/kWh), meaning electric heat will be 
more expensive unless a high-efficiency heat pump is 
installed. Having time-of-use tariffs (such as Economy 7)  
can help to reduce these running costs. The cost of 
producing hydrogen is difficult to quantify as it is not 
available for the domestic heating sector. 
Ultimately, new hydrogen and electric technologies need 
to offer low carbon heat without pushing up consumer 
bills if they are to gain popular support. The next five years 
are critical for decarbonising Britain’s heat, so pressure 
is mounting to find the right solutions, to engage wider 
interest from the public, to build the social licence for a 
costly programme of transformation, and to decide how to 
equitably fund such a transformation.

Energy efficiency standards meant that for the last decade only ‘condensing boilers’ could be installed. These burn around a tenth less fuel as they capture the heat that is otherwise wasted as steam in the exhaust flue. 
Their market share has grown from just 2% of gas-heated homes in 2000 to 38% in 2010 to an estimated 74% of homes last year.

7.  Capacity and production statistics
Wind supplied its largest ever share of electricity over the fourth 
quarter of 2019, beating nuclear again to supply 23%. Four out of 
the last five quarters have seen wind being the second largest 
provider of electricity.
Coal output was down by half on this quarter last year. It supplied 
less than half the output of Britain’s biomass power stations, 
despite having more than twice the installed capacity.
Imports continued to grow, up 25% on this quarter last year. Over 
the fourth quarter, Britain imported five times more electricity 
than it exported.
Wholesale power prices were uneventful, averaging £39/MWh over 
the quarter. The highest instantaneous price was just £86, whereas 
the lowest price was a record-breaking –£73/MWh.
Prices have fallen by a one-third over the last year, driven by the 
falling cost of natural gas and coal. Futures contracts for natural gas 
have plummeted in recent months, halving since September 2019.

Other sources give different values because of the types of plant they consider. For example, BEIS Energy Trends records an additional 0.7 GW of hydro, 0.6 GW of biomass and 3 GW of waste-to-energy plants.  
These plants and their output are not visible to the electricity transmission system and so cannot be reported on here.

We include an estimate of the installed capacity of smaller storage devices which are not monitored by the electricity market operator. Britain’s storage capacity is made up of 2.9 GW of pumped hydro storage,  
0.6 GW of lithium-ion batteries, 0.4 GW of flywheels and 0.3 GW of compressed air.

8.  Power system records
2019 saw all clean electricity sources break their previous records for annual 
production. 2019 saw all clean electricity sources break their previous records 
for annual production. For wind, solar and biomass, these were all-time highs; 
for nuclear, it was the lowest output recorded this century. Wind supplied 
more than a fifth of Britain’s electricity for the first time, while coal fell to 
a new low of just 2%. 2019 was also the first year where Britain’s electricity 
averaged below 200 grams of CO2 per kWh. 
On the 8th of December, wind supplied a record 43% of demand through the 
day, and total generation from low-carbon sources exceeded 30 GW for the 
first time ever. Overproduction and constraints in the transmission system led 
to wholesale prices reaching a new low of –£73 per MWh, and the first ever 
day with a negative average power price. Just two days later, wind broke its 
instantaneous record, surpassing 16 GW output for the first time ever.
The tables below look over the past decade (2009 to 2019) and report the 
record output and share of electricity generation, plus sustained averages 
over a day, a month and a calendar year. Cells highlighted in blue are records 
that were broken in the fourth quarter of 2019. Each number links to the date 
it occurred on the Electric Insights website, allowing these records to be 
explored visually.

Note that Britain has no inter-seasonal electricity storage, so we only report on half-hourly and daily records. Elexon and National Grid only report the output of large pumped hydro storage plants. The operation of 
battery, flywheel and other storage sites is not publicly available.
