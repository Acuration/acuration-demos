accordance with our contract.  
 
Terms of Engagement

Governance data (hereafter referred to as ‘Selected Information’), for the period January 1 2022 to December 31 
2022, against the assurance criteria below to a limited level of assurance and at a materiality of the professional 
judgement of the verifier using LRQA’s verification procedure. LRQA’s verification procedure is based on current 
best practice, is in accordance with ISAE 3000 and ISAE 3410. 
 
Our assurance engagement with Drax covered the following requirements: 
• 
Verifying conformance with:

• 
World Resources Institute / World Business Council for Sustainable Development Greenhouse Gas

the WRI/WBCSD Protocol) for the GHG data1 
• 
Evaluating the accuracy and reliability of data and information for only the selected indicators listed below:   
• 
Group Greenhouse Gas (GHG) emissions (Scope 1 and 2);  
• 
Group GHG emissions (Scope 3);

LRQA’s Opinion 
Based on LRQA’s approach,  nothing has come to our attention that would cause us to believe that Drax has not, 
in all material respects: 
• 
Met the requirements of the criteria listed above; and 
• 
Disclosed accurate and reliable performance data and information in the Selected Information. 
The opinion expressed is formed on the basis of a limited level of assurance2 and at the materiality of the 
professional judgement of the verifier.  
 
LRQA’s Approach 
LRQA’s assurance engagements are carried out in accordance with our verification procedure and with the 
International Standard on Assurance Engagements (ISAE) 3000 Revised, Assurance Engagements Other than Audits 
or Reviews of Historical Financial Information (effective for assurance reports dated on or after December 15, 
2015), issued by the International Auditing and Assurance Standards Board (December 2013). 
 
The following tasks were undertaken as part of the evidence gathering process for this assurance engagement:  
• 
Review of the evidence pack;  
• 
Conducted virtual interviews with relevant personnel of Drax;  
• 
Review of the data collection and consolidation processes used to compile the Selected Information, 
including assessing assumptions made, the data scope and reporting boundaries;  
• 
Reviewed a sample of the Selected Information against the corresponding source documentation provided 
by Drax; and  
• 
Performed a selection of aggregation calculations of the Selected Information.  
 
Observations  
Further observations and findings, made during the assurance engagement, are: 
• 
The company should continue to make every effort to improve the accuracy of submitted data to the 
workbook.  Assumptions have been made appropriately but actual data would be an improvement. 
• 
The company should continue to develop the calculations in a way that allows factors and conversions to 
be applied in a clear and transparent manner. 
• 
It would be beneficial to complete periodic reviews of the ESG reporting process, to consider its 
effectiveness and where opportunities for improvement could be. 
• 
It would be beneficial to develop sense checks where appropriate, to monitor data trends and to highlight 
any initial data errors such as those arising from changes in reporting units. 
 
LRQA’s Standards, Competence and Independence 
LRQA implements and maintains a comprehensive management system that meets accreditation requirements 
for ISO 14065 Greenhouse gases – Requirements for greenhouse gas validation and verification bodies for use in 
accreditation or other forms of recognition and ISO/IEC 17021 Conformity assessment – Requirements for bodies 
providing audit and certification of management systems that are at least as demanding as the requirements of 
 
2 The extent of evidence-gathering for a limited assurance engagement is less than for a reasonable assurance engagement.  Limited assurance 
engagements focus on aggregated data rather than physically checking source data at sites.  Consequently, the level of assurance obtained in a 
limited assurance engagement is lower than the assurance that would have been obtained had a reasonable assurance engagement been 
performed.

the International Standard on Quality Control 1 and comply with the Code of Ethics for Professional Accountants 
issued by the International Ethics Standards Board for Accountants. 
 
LRQA ensures the selection of appropriately qualified individuals based on their qualifications, training and 
experience. The outcome of all verification and certification assessments is then internally reviewed by senior 
management to ensure that the approach applied is rigorous and transparent. 
 
LRQA is: 
• 
Drax’s certification body for ISO14001 and OHSAS18001; 
• 
Drax Generation Enterprise Limited’s certification body for ISO 45001; and  
• 
Drax Power Station installation’s UK ETS verification body.  
The verification and certification assessments are the only work undertaken by LRQA for Drax and as such does 
not compromise our independence or impartiality.
