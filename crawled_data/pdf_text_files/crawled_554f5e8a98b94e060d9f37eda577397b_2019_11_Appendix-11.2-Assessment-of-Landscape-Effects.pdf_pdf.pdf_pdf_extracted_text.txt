Appendix 11.2 Assessment of Landscape Effects
This Appendix should be read in conjunction with Figures 11.2 – 11.6 and 11.9 and Appendix 11.1. Note: All landscape and visual mitigation is embedded and described in Chapter 3: Project and Site
Description. All effects identified in the table below are therefore residual. The cumulative assessment has been undertaken for the project as a whole and not for each individual element.

Value:
The aspect areas considered in the
LANDMAP evaluation as being of High or
Outstanding 
value 
tend 
not 
to 
be
particularly apparent within the Project
Site. Overall the landscape character of
the Site is considered to be of Medium
value.
Susceptibility:
The landscape resource is considered to
have some capacity to accommodate the
proposed development without effects
upon its overall integrity.  The pattern of
the landscape reflects a mostly intact
pattern of elements, with features in
reasonable condition although a number
of detracting elements exist such as the
prominent power lines and adjacent Gas
Compressor 
Station 
and 
Substation.
Taking all of this into account, landscape
susceptibility to change is Medium.
Sensitivity:
Taking into account value judgements
and susceptibility to change, overall
sensitivity of the landscape character is
considered to be Medium.
Construction:
Construction of the Power Generation Plant would result
in temporary adverse effects as a result of the
construction plant and activities, laydown areas and
temporary structures on site. During construction there
would be a permanent loss of landscape features
including grazing land, trees and scrub vegetation along
with extensive earth re-profiling. Construction noise,
activities and lighting would reduce the relative tranquillity
in the vicinity of the Project Site. Construction of the
Access Road would result in the removal of trees and
some woodland although the wider woodland structure
and its associated strong degree of enclosure and shelter
it currently provides would remain intact.
The construction of the Gas Connection would result in
temporary adverse effects as a result of the construction
plant and activity involved in constructing the AGI along
with access from  Rhyd-y-pandy road and the Pipeline.
The open trench method of constructing the Pipeline
connection would result in the temporary removal of
grazing land and the permanent removal of sections of
field boundary hedgerow and trees.
The Electrical Connection route would follow the
alignment of the new Access Road and so disruption
associated with its construction would be similar to that of
the new Access Road as described above.
Across the entire Project Site, the temporary presence of
construction plant, activities and lighting would introduce
noticeable features uncharacteristic of the landscape at
present. As a result of these changes and the partial loss
and alteration of some
of the key characteristics,
magnitude of change is considered to be Medium.
The Medium sensitivity assessed combined with the
Medium magnitude of change would result in a Moderate

Project Site. It would result in the partial loss to landscape
features, including grazing land, trees and scrub
vegetation, which would result in a partial change to some
of the landscape characteristics although it would not

The Access Road would lie substantially within the
woodland characteristic of the Penllergaer Forest Aspect
Area which would retain its qualities providing a strong
degree of enclosure and shelter.
The route of the Gas Connection would be reinstated
upon operation with fields returned to grazing and field
boundaries reinstated with hedgerow and tree planting.

The Electrical Connection route would be buried
immediately adjacent to the Access Road and the long
term residual effects on the landscape would be similar to
the Access Road as described above.
Across the wider site there would be a partial loss to
some of the key characteristics of the landscape but
would not result in an obvious change to the overall
character of the area. These effects would be long term
and partially reversible. At year of opening the magnitude
of change would be Medium which when combined with
the Medium sensitivity to change would result in a
Moderate Adverse effect.
Once the structure planting around the Power Generation
Plant and AGI establishes it would assist in providing
some additional structure to the landscape which
alongside the reinstatement hedgerow planting and fields
returned to grazing along the Gas Connection Route
would assist in integrating elements of the development
into the local landscape. Nonetheless, despite the
establishment of the planting, the magnitude of effect is
considered to remain Medium at year 15 as there would
remain a noticeable alteration of the existing components
of the landscape of the Site. This would result in a
residual Moderate Adverse effect.

this aspect area. Tall construction plant such as cranes,
lighting, increased vehicle movements and noise would
result in greater effects in proximity to the Project Site
where the construction of the Project would have a
greater influence on the aesthetic and perceptual aspects
of the landscape. However for the majority of the aspect
area there would be little tangible effect upon the
aesthetic and perceptual qualities as the tracts of
woodland planting and intervening hedgerows and
localised variations in landform limit the effects on the
setting of the wider aspect area resulting in minimal
change to the overall landscape character.
Magnitude of change would be Low which combined with
a Medium sensitivity would result in a Minor Adverse

Operation:
Direct effects on this aspect area are covered above as

prominent

Indirect effects would be limited to parts of the aspect
area in closer proximity to the Project Site. Whilst the ZTV
suggests extensive theoretical visibility across the
majority of this aspect area, the extensive tracts of
woodland, hedgerows and localised variations in landform
would substantially limit the indirect effects on this
landscape. Furthermore this aspect area contains a
number of features which are not dissimilar in nature to
the Project including the Felindre Gas Compressor

Combined with the medium sensitivity, overall, Minor

would reduce the relative tranquillity in the vicinity of the Project Site. Construction
of the Access Road would result in the removal of trees and some woodland
although the wider woodland structure and its associated strong degree of
enclosure and shelter it currently provides would remain intact.
Across the Generating Equipment Site, the temporary presence of construction
plant, activities and lighting would introduce noticeable features uncharacteristic
of the landscape at present. As a result of these changes and the partial loss and
alteration of some of the key characteristics, magnitude of change is considered
to be Medium.
The Medium sensitivity assessed combined with the Medium magnitude of
change would result in a Moderate Adverse effect on landscape character during

Operation:
Once operational the Power Generation Plant would be a prominent feature within
the immediate landscape of the Generating Equipment Site. It would result in the
partial loss of landscape features, including grazing land, trees and scrub
vegetation, which would result in a partial change to some of the landscape
characteristics although it would not diminish the overall integrity of the
landscape.
The Access Road would lie substantially within the woodland characteristic of the
Penllergaer Forest Aspect Area which would retain its qualities providing a strong
degree of enclosure and shelter.
Overall, across the Generating Equipment Site there would be a partial loss of
some of the key characteristics of the landscape which would not result in an
obvious change to the overall character of the area. These effects would be long
term and partially reversible. At year of opening the magnitude of change would
be Medium which when combined with the Medium sensitivity to change would
result in a Moderate Adverse effect.
Once the embedded structure planting around the Power Generation Plant
establishes (Figure 11.10) it would assist in providing some additional structure to
the landscape and in integrating elements of the development into the local
landscape. Nonetheless, despite the establishment of the planting, the magnitude

this aspect area. Tall construction plant such as cranes, lighting, increased vehicle
movements and noise would result in greater effects in proximity to the
Generating Equipment Site where the construction of the development would
have a greater influence on the aesthetic and perceptual aspects of the
landscape. However for the majority of the aspect area there would be little
tangible effect upon the aesthetic and perceptual qualities as the tracts of
woodland planting and intervening hedgerows and localised variations in landform
limit the effects on the setting of the wider aspect area resulting in minimal change
to the overall landscape character.

Operation:
Direct effects on this aspect area are covered above as part of the Generating

would be limited to parts of the aspect area in closer proximity to the Generating
Equipment Site. Whilst the ZTV suggests extensive theoretical visibility across the
majority of this aspect area, the extensive tracts of woodland, hedgerows and
localised variations in landform would substantially limit the indirect effects on this
landscape. Furthermore this aspect area contains a number of features which are
not dissimilar to the development including the Felindre Gas Compressor Station,
Substations and numerous pylons and associated overhead lines which are
prominent vertical structures across this aspect area. The overall character, scale
and pattern of the landscape would remain largely unchanged.
Magnitude of change would be Low with little change resulting to the overall
character of this aspect area. Combined with the medium sensitivity, overall,
Minor Adverse effects would result for this aspect area which would not diminish
as the reinstatement planting matures as this is considered to have most

the AGI along with an Access Road into it off the Rhyd-y-pandy road and the
underground gas pipeline. The open trench method of constructing the
underground gas pipeline connection would result in the temporary removal of
grazing land and the permanent removal of sections of field boundary
hedgerow and trees. Construction noise, activities and lighting would reduce
the relative tranquillity in the vicinity of the Gas Connection Site for a temporary

This would entail the removal of trees and some woodland although the wider
woodland structure and its associated strong degree of enclosure and shelter it
currently provides would remain intact.
Construction plant and activity would be very localised and would be within the
parts of the landscape that are currently heavily influenced by overhead
transmission lines, pylons, the Gas Compressor Station and Substation. As a
result the temporary changes and the partial loss of some of landscape
characteristics would result in a Low magnitude of change.
The Medium sensitivity assessed combined with the Low magnitude of change
would result in a Minor Adverse effect on landscape character during
construction.

Operation:
Once operational the Electrical Connection would be buried alongside the
Access Road. This would lie substantially within the woodland characteristic of
the Penllergaer Forest Aspect Area which would retain its qualities providing a
strong degree of enclosure and shelter.
The character of the landscape and its inherent features would remain
unchanged and as such there would be scarcely any perceptible change in the
character resulting in a Negligible magnitude. The Medium sensitivity combined
with the Negligible magnitude of change would result in a Negligible effect.

the aspect area there would be little tangible effect upon the aesthetic and

Direct effects on this aspect area are discussed above for the Electrical

woodland which would limit the temporary construction effects on the setting of
this aspect area to very localised and peripheral areas in the east.

Value:
With reference to the LANDMAP overall
evaluation, the value of this aspect area is

Susceptibility:
The landscape resource is considered to
have slightly less capacity to accommodate
the Electrical Connection without effects
upon its overall integrity due to the open,
upland character of this small aspect area
which is distinct from adjoining areas.
However, there are a number of prominent
features such as pylons and overhead

which are situated in adjoining aspect
areas which reduces its susceptibility to the
type of development proposed. Taking this
into account, landscape susceptibility to

aspect area. Due to its open and upland context the construction activity and
