ENABLING A ZERO CARBON, LOWER COST ENERGY FUTURE
Absolute increase in demand for electricty
Decarbonisation of heating and transport
Globally 70-85% of electricity from intermittent renewables by 2050(1)
>15% from complementary flexible sources – biomass, hydro, storage
How Drax is helping
Renewable biomass generation and supply chain
Flexible generation to support the energy system
Giving customers control of their energy

ENABLING A ZERO CARBON, LOWER COST ENERGY FUTURE
Growing demand for flexible, low carbon and renewable energy sources
Biomass is an important source of system stability and security of supply
Biomass is only large scale flexible renewable source of power
Supports forest growth and health
Commercially managed forestry consumes more CO2 than unmanaged
• Primary market is construction not biomass
• Biomass generation uses low grade wood
Biomass supports long-term investment in forest stocks
Opportunity for large scale carbon negative generation
Required to achieve UK decarbonisation targets
Attractive option subject to appropriate regulatory framework
“[BECCS] has the potential to make huge 
strides in our efforts to tackle climate 
change while kick-starting an entirely 
new cutting-edge industry in the UK. 
World-firsts like this will help us to 
realise our ambition of having a first 
operational plant by the mid-2020s as 
we continue to seize the opportunities of 
moving to a greener, cleaner economy –
a key part of our modern Industrial 
Strategy.”
