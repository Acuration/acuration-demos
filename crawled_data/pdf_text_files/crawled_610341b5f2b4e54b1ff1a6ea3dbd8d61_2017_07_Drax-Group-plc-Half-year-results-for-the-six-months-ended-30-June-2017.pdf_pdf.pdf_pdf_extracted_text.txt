Chief Executive’s statement 
Introduction 
The Group has delivered strong operational performance, and increased EBITDA from £70 million in H1 2016 to £121 
million in H1 2017. However, increases to depreciation and amortisation costs and unrealised losses on derivative 
contracts, resulted in a loss before tax for the period of £(83) million (2016: Profit of £184 million). 
Our new Group strategy, which we launched in December 2016, is creating greater diversification for the business as 
we help to change the way energy is generated, supplied and used for a better future. In doing so we are shifting our 
earnings profile to deliver higher quality more stable earnings, with opportunities for long-term growth. 
In Retail, with the acquisition of Opus Energy and good performance at Haven Power, we significantly increased our 
customer base and markedly improved profitability in the first half of the year.  
Our Generation business, Drax Power, is a predominantly renewable electricity generator with 68% of our output being 
produced from biomass in the form of sustainable compressed wood pellets. As expected, our coal units ran less often 
but continued to play an important role providing a range of system support services to the UK electricity system with 
reliable, flexible and responsive capacity.  
In North America, our compressed wood pellet supply business, Drax Biomass, increased its production of good quality, 
sustainable, cost effective wood pellets for sale to Drax Power. In April, in line with our strategy to increase self-supply, 
we acquired a 450k tonne wood pellet plant in Louisiana. This increases our production capacity by 50%. 
At our Capital Markets Day in June we provided further detail of our strategy and our ambitions for long-term growth 
across the business, which we expressed with a 2025 EBITDA target of over £425 million. We expect to deliver this 
across a range of earnings streams, more than a third of which will come from the growth of our Retail and Biomass 
Supply businesses, complemented by increasingly stable and less commodity exposed generation earnings. 
We also announced the Group’s new dividend policy which will see us pay £50 million for the 2017 calendar year. This 
is a level which is sustainable and expected to grow. It follows refinancing we completed in May, which completes the 
Group’s financial model and supports our new strategy. 
Strong corporate governance remains as important as ever and to that end we are pleased to be able to complement 
our experienced Board of directors with the appointment of a new non-executive director. David Nussbaum will join the 
Board in August 2017 and we look forward to benefitting from his considerable experience as we deliver our 
sustainability agenda.     
Safe and Sustainable Operations 
Good safety and sustainability management is at the heart of our operational philosophy.  
Safety performance was particularly strong in the period. We achieved our lowest ever total recordable injury rate across 
the Group of 0.08. This is also good progress against the 0.17 recorded in H1 2016. 
Through the period we maintained our rigorous and robust approach to sustainability, to ensure that all of the biomass 
we use is sustainable, low carbon and fully compliant with the UK’s mandatory sustainability standards for biomass. The 
biomass we use to generate electricity provides a 68% carbon emissions saving against gas.  This calculation factors 
in supply chain emissions associated with manufacturing and transportation.  Our biomass life-cycle carbon emissions 
are 34g CO2/ MJ, less than half of the UK Government’s 79g CO2/ MJ limit1.   
 
Retail 
The acquisition of Opus Energy, alongside Haven Power, delivered a step change in customer growth and profits in H1 
2017, making the Group the largest challenger business to business (B2B) energy retailer in the UK. EBITDA for Retail 
increased from £(2) million in H1 2016 to £11 million in H1 2017. 
The B2B energy market in the UK has over five million businesses. There are good opportunities for future growth as 
market shares shift from traditional suppliers to challenger brands like Opus Energy and Haven Power.  
 
Opus Energy is focused on the Small and Medium-sized Enterprise (SME) market, whilst Haven Power focuses on the 
Industrial and Commercial (I&C) market and larger SMEs. Our two retail businesses provide a highly complementary 
range of electricity products and services. In addition, through Opus Energy we have now added the sale of gas to our 
product range. 
 
5 
 
Led by their experienced management teams these businesses are working well together. We have made good progress 
with the integration of Opus Energy into the Group, as demonstrated by its continued growth in sales at attractive 
margins. In addition, Haven Power achieved breakeven profitability, ahead of plan, during H1 2017. 
Generation 
In biomass generation we have delivered world class operational performance, with output of 7.3TWh in H1 2017 (2016: 
7.5TWh).  We estimate2 that we produced 17% of the UK’s renewable electricity, enough to power over four million 
homes.  Three of our six generating units are powered by compressed wood pellets and receive support from Renewable 
Obligation Certificates (for two units) and a Contract for Difference (CfD) (for one unit), which provides us with high 
levels of revenue visibility through to 2027.   
Our renewable electricity generation provides the UK with reliable, flexible and cost effective electricity. Independent 
research has shown that, on a whole system costs basis, it is the most affordable large-scale renewable on the system3.  
In its recent Future Energy Scenarios report, the electricity system operator (National Grid plc4) has identified a role for 
biomass, well beyond 2027.   
H1 2017 saw good operational performance in coal generation, producing 32% of the power station’s output, playing an 
important role in the provision of system stability and earning a range of merchant and contract based revenue streams.  
Capacity payments worth circa £80 million are secured for 2017-2021, and revenue from ancillary services was £21 
million in H1 2017 (£20 million in H1 2016). 
In line with our strategy we continue to explore future options for our Generation business. This includes continued 
engagement with Government to make the case for further biomass upgrades of coal units. During H1 2017 we have 
been running a trial on one of our coal units to examine the feasibility of a low cost solution for fuelling it with 100% 
compressed wood pellets using existing co-firing infrastructure. The unit has performed well but there is further work to 
do to ensure that it delivers high output reliably and safely on a sustained basis, which we believe is achievable. In view 
of this, we will continue our trial through the summer, but have decided to return the unit to coal fuelling this winter to 
ensure high availability through the colder months.  
We are progressing well with our four rapid response gas projects. Two of our project sites are ready to participate in 
the UK capacity auctions and we intend to bid them into the February 2018 auction. If successful we will secure fifteen 
year contracts for capacity delivery starting in winter 2021/2022. Meanwhile, the process of securing the principal permits 
for the remaining two project sites is progressing well and we aim to enter them into the 2019 capacity auction. 
Our Research and Innovation team is currently developing a proposal to look into the feasibility of converting one or 
more of our coal units to gas. Early indications are that this could be an attractive option for delivering critical flexible 
and reliable generation capacity for the UK and we expect to continue to develop this as an option over the coming 
years. Any such investment would be eligible for a fifteen year capacity contract through the UK Government’s capacity 
auctions. 
 
Biomass Supply 
Operational performance improved in H1 2017 with increases in production and supply.  Production increased from 
251k tonnes in H1 2016 to 366k tonnes in H1 2017.   
In April we progressed our strategy to self-supply at least 30% of wood pellets for Drax Power Station. We acquired a 
450k tonne compressed wood pellet plant out of receivership at a significant discount to the new build cost of the asset. 
This plant, which we have named LaSalle Bioenergy, is in the same South East US region as our two existing pellet 
plants, allowing us to maximise the benefits of our presence in this region. It requires further investment to bring it up to 
the Group’s technical standards for safe and reliable operation. This is now underway and we expect the plant to start 
ramping up operations in Q1 2018 and to reach full capacity output in 2019. 
 
 
Regulatory 
We continue to operate in a changing political and regulatory environment. The full impact of the UK’s decision to leave 
the EU is not yet known, but we continue to utilise medium-term foreign exchange hedges to help protect the Group 
from volatility in exchange rates leading to volatility in fuel costs. We do not generate power or supply electricity and gas 
outside of the UK. 
In terms of domestic energy policy, the UK Government’s main focus has been on what it sees as potentially unfair 
standard variable tariffs (SVTs) for domestic consumers. The Government has asked our regulator, Ofgem, to address 
this issue and to ensure microbusinesses are treated fairly. Our retail focus remains on the B2B market. 
6 
 
The Government’s consultation on the cessation of coal generation by 2025 closed in December 2016. The consultation 
asked for views about the potential for co-firing with biomass to allow coal stations to meet tighter emissions limits but 
we do not yet have any indication of when the conclusions of this consultation will be published. Similarly, the 
Government’s call for evidence on fuelled and geothermal technologies in the CfD scheme closed in March this year. 
This asked for views on how the CfD scheme should treat biomass conversions in the future but to date the Government 
has not responded to the part of the consultation relating to fuelled technologies which burn a fuel source derived from 
biomass. We are also expecting the Government to announce plans for future Carbon Price Support this autumn and 
are maintaining a dialogue with the Treasury and other Government departments on this issue. 
 
Outlook 
For the full year 2017, subject to continued operational performance, we expect EBITDA to be in line with current market 
consensus. 
Beyond this our focus remains on the implementation and delivery of our strategy, which is underpinned by safety, 
sustainability and operational excellence as well as expertise in our markets. Central to our strategy is the delivery of 
targeted growth through deploying our expertise across our supply chain and, in so doing, diversifying, growing and 
improving the quality of our earnings with reduced exposure to commodity market volatility.  
In our Retail business we expect to deliver continued growth at Opus Energy at attractive margins and improving 
profitability at Haven Power. 
Our generation assets remain strategically important, delivering cost effective large scale, low carbon renewable power, 
whilst also playing a significant role in providing critical system support services to the electricity grid. We will continue 
to actively explore options to expand and upgrade our generation assets, including new opportunities in gas which would 
provide additional system support services and be underpinned by a stable fifteen year, fixed price, capacity market 
contract. This would extend earnings visibility to the late 2030’s and deliver attractive returns to shareholders. 
The focus for our biomass pellet supply business remains on good operational performance, reducing operating costs, 
cross-supply chain optimisation and identifying attractive options to increase self-supply to at least 30%.  
Having made good progress on the delivery of our strategy we will continue to build on it as we progress our targets for 
2025, whilst playing an important role in our markets and helping to change the way energy is generated, supplied and 
used for a better future.

Group Financial Review 
Introduction 
The Group’s performance for the first six months of the year was significantly improved relative to the first six months of 
2016, with EBITDA of £121 million (2016: £70 million). This principally reflects contributions from recently acquired Opus 
Energy and the operation of a biomass unit in Generation under a CfD. This was delivered alongside a well-supported 
refinancing and underpinned by strong operational performance across the Group. 
Profit before tax was adversely impacted by higher depreciation (£22 million), relating to the previously announced 
accelerated depreciation of coal-specific assets, one off costs associated with the Opus Energy acquisition (£6 million) 
and the refinancing (£24 million), as well as amortisation of newly-acquired intangible assets in Opus (£19 million). In 
addition, non-cash unrealised losses on derivative contracts in the period of £65 million moved adversely by £228 million 
from 30 June 2016, principally a result of foreign exchange rate movements. This resulted in a loss before tax of £83 
million for the period (2016: profit £184 million). However, the underlying performance, which excludes this volatility and 
related tax charges, resulted in underlying earnings of £9 million, as shown in note 5.    
The financial structure of the business has changed over the past twelve months and the Group now benefits from 
increasingly visible and growing earnings from a diversified base, with reducing exposure to commodity prices. We 
expect the CfD will underpin our earnings through the life of the contract (to March 2027), supported by growing 
contributions from expanding Biomass Supply operations and our Retail business. 
On 10 February 2017 we completed the acquisition of Opus Energy Group Limited for total consideration of £367 million. 
The acquisition was funded from the Group’s own resources and £200 million from an acquisition facility and resulted 
in £156 million of goodwill and £224 million of intangible assets (see note 8).  
As part of our interim review, we have reviewed the principal commercial and operational risks faced by the Group. 
These risks are set out in our 2016 Annual Report and Accounts (pages 55-61) and remain unchanged. 
The Group is supported by a robust balance sheet, strengthened in the period by the refinancing and restructuring of 
the Group’s debt and a continued focus on working capital and cash optimisation. 
 
Financial Performance 
Consolidated revenue for the period of £1,801 million was £314 million greater than the same period in 2016, driven by 
higher Generation sales and the acquisition of Opus Energy.  
Electrical output from our Generation business of 10.7TWh was in line with our plan, 68% from biomass-fired units and 
32% from coal-fired units.  
Retail power revenues increased from £643 million at 30 June 2016 to £940 million at 30 June 2017, including 
contributions from Opus Energy (from 10 February). Gross margins also improved from £10 million to £61 million, with 
both businesses contributing to this result. 
Revenues and margins for our US-based compressed wood pellet manufacturing business continued to rise, as we 
increased production from 250,895 tonnes in the first half of 2016 to 366,496 tonnes this year. We are also making good 
progress on our projects to increase capacity at our two existing facilities and in the work to bring the recently acquired 
LaSalle Bioenergy in to service in 2018. 
Consolidated gross margin to 30 June 2017 of £275 million was driven by improvements across the business and 
compares to £182 million in the same period in 2016.  
Other operating costs of £154 million are higher than £112 million in the first six months of 2016, reflecting the acquisition 
of Opus Energy and costs associated with strategic development activities.   
As a result of these costs and gross margin performance, consolidated EBITDA for 30 June 2017 was £121 million, 
compared to £70 million in 2016. 
Depreciation and amortisation charges increased from £49 million in the first six months of 2016 to £90 million this year. 
This includes shortening the useful economic life and accelerating depreciation on certain coal-specific assets within 
Generation to a long stop date of 2025, in line with the Government’s stated ambition for the cessation of unabated coal 
generation. We also recognised intangibles, entirely arising from the Opus acquisition, of £224 million, which resulted 
in amortisation of £19 million in the period.  
Interest payable of £37 million include the costs incurred during the Group’s refinancing. A full breakdown of interest 
payable is shown in note 3 and includes early repayment charges for loans outstanding at the refinancing date. 
8 
 
A key component of the Group’s risk management strategy is the use of forward contracts to secure and de-risk the 
future cash flows of the business. The accounting for these contracts is set out in further detail in note 12 and during 
the period resulted in an unrealised loss of £65 million, driven by the partial recovery of sterling against the US Dollar. 
Loss before tax, calculated in accordance with IFRS was £83 million, including transaction and integration costs incurred 
through the acquisition of Opus Energy of £6 million, and the Group refinancing costs of £24 million. This compared to 
a profit of £184 million for the 6 months to June 2016. The movement predominantly reflects volatility in the unrealised 
gains and losses on derivative contracts. 
After a tax credit for the period of £14 million (2016: charge of £36 million), loss after tax was £68 million (2016: profit of 
£149 million), delivering a basic loss per share of (16.8) pence (2016: Earnings of 36.6 pence). 
Underlying earnings is used to assess the performance of our Group without P&L volatility. The reconciliation of IFRS 
earnings to underlying earnings is shown in note 5 and results in underlying profit after tax for the six months of £9 
million (2016: £17 million) or 2.2 pence per share (2016: 4.2 pence per share). 
Cash taxes paid during the period were £9 million (2016: £2 million cash taxes repaid).  
 
Financial Position 
Capital expenditure in the period was £79 million, increased from £38 million in the first six months of 2016. This included 
the purchase, at auction, of the pellet-production assets at LaSalle Bioenergy ($35 million), details of which are shown 
in note 11, and investment in an office facility in Northampton (£10 million), which will be used to consolidate existing 
Opus Energy operations in that area. Other investment reflected routine asset replacement at Drax Power Station, 
including the purchase of strategic spares, and the development of a new information technology platform for Retail.  
Cash generated from operations amounted to £235 million in the period, an £82 million increase from the previous year. 
This was supported by initiatives designed to improve cash flows and release working capital from our balance sheet.  
The cash position during the first half was significantly impacted by a full Group refinancing, which was executed on 5 
May 2017. The Group successfully raised £550 million of publicly traded bonds, supported by a revised revolving credit 
facility of £350 million.  
During the period the newly-raised funds were used to repay the £200 million Opus Energy acquisition facility and going 
forward will provide support for our investment and strategic programmes.  
Net debt at 30 June was £372 million, compared to £85 million at the end of June 2016. 
 
Distributions 
On 15 June we announced a new dividend policy, consistent with maintaining the Group’s credit rating and investing in 
its business. 
In 2017 the Board expects to recommend a dividend of £50m with regards to the 2017 financial year. The Board is 
confident that this dividend is sustainable and expects it to grow from this level as the implementation of the strategy 
generates an increasing proportion of stable earnings and cash flows. In determining the rate of growth in dividends the 
Board will take account of future investment opportunities and the less predictable cash flows from the Group’s 
commodity based businesses. If there is a build-up of capital in excess of the Group’s investment needs the Board will 
consider the most appropriate mechanism to return this to shareholders. 
At the Annual General Meeting on 13 April 2017, shareholders approved payment of a final dividend for the year ended 
31 December 2016 of 0.4 pence per share (£1.6 million). The final dividend was subsequently paid on 12 May 2017. 
On 18 July 2017, the Board resolved to pay an interim dividend for the six months ended 30 June 2017 of 4.9 pence 
per share (£20 million), representing 40% of the expected full year dividend. The interim dividend will be paid on 6 
October 2017 and shares will be marked ex-dividend on 21 September 2017.

Other information 
Going Concern 
The Group’s business activities, together with the factors likely to affect future developments, financial position and 
financial performance, including principal risks and uncertainties, are discussed within the Chief Executive’s statement 
(on pages 4 to 6), this Group Financial Review and our 2016 Annual Report and Accounts. 
Our cash flows and borrowing facilities are described above. In addition, section 7 of the consolidated financial 
statements in the 2016 Annual Report and Accounts explains our approach to capital risk management and exposure 
to financial risks (including credit, counterparty and liquidity risk) and gives details of financial instruments and hedging 
activities used to mitigate these risks and exposures. 
Following the refinancing described above, we have substantial headroom in our banking facilities, a recent history of 
cash generation and strong covenant compliance. We retain good visibility in near-term forecasts due to our progressive 
hedging strategy. Our business plan is updated quarterly and takes account of our capital investment plans and 
reasonably possible changes in trading performance, including sensitivity analysis on downside scenarios. 
We are satisfied that we are able to operate the business within the current level of our banking facilities, that we will 
remain compliant with our covenants and that we will have sufficient cash available to meet our obligations as they fall 
due for the foreseeable future. 
Consequently, the directors have a reasonable expectation that the Group has adequate resources to continue in 
operational existence for the foreseeable future and, as a result, continue to prepare the financial statements on a going 
concern basis.  
 
Principal risks and uncertainties 
We manage the commercial and operational risks faced by the Group in accordance with policies approved by the 
Board. We set out in detail in our 2016 Annual Report and Accounts (pages 55-61) the principal risks and uncertainties 
that could impact performance. We have reviewed the principal risks and consider they are broadly unchanged and will 
continue to be relevant over the second half of the year. 
We recognise that the UK’s decision to leave the European Union in 2016 and the recent UK election result have 
increased political and regulatory uncertainty. The Group continues to monitor this situation closely but at this stage we 
do not detect increasing risks for our businesses. We continue to promote the benefits of biomass and are engaged with 
government and regulators in the UK and internationally to ensure the Group’s views and positions on current and 
forthcoming legislation and regulations, and on energy and environmental policy issues that may have implications for 
our business, are represented. 
 
Seasonality of Trading 
The primary activities of our Group are affected by seasonality. Demand in the UK, for electricity, gas and heat, is 
typically higher and thus drives higher prices and dispatch in the winter period (October to March) when temperatures 
are colder. Conversely, demand is typically lower in the summer months (April to September), when prices are lower.  
This trend is experienced by all of our UK-based businesses, as they variously operate within the UK electricity, gas 
and heat markets, and is most notable within the Generation business due to its scale and the flexible operation of coal-
fired plant when prices are low in the summer. The US-based Biomass Supply business has a regular production and 
despatch schedule, driven by regular demand from the Generation business for wood pellets, which insulates it from 
demand fluctuations caused by seasonality. 
Cash flow during the summer months can thus be materially reduced due to the combined effects of lower demand, 
prices and output, while maintenance expenditures are increased due to the timing of major planned outages. The 
Group’s amended £350 million working capital and revolving credit facility assists in managing cash low points in the 
cycle if required. 
Related parties 
The Group set out in its 2016 Annual Report and Accounts (page 166) the related party transactions arising which were 
in relation to remuneration of management personnel. There have been no new related party transactions, other than 
the remuneration of key management personnel, since 31 December 2016. 
 
The contents of this report were approved by the Board on 18 July 2017.

Interim Condensed Consolidated Financial 
Statements 
 
Introduction 
The Interim Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements provide detailed information about the financial performance 
(Condensed consolidated income statement), financial position (Condensed consolidated balance sheet), and cash 
flows (Condensed consolidated cash flow statement) of Drax Group plc (the Company) together with all of the entities 
controlled by the Company (collectively, the Group). 
The notes to the financial statements provide additional information on the items in the Condensed consolidated income 
statement, Condensed consolidated balance sheet and Condensed consolidated cash flow statement. In general, the 
additional information in the notes to the financial statements is required by IFRS or other regulations to facilitate 
increased understanding of the primary statements. 
 
Basis of preparation 
The Interim Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements have been prepared using accounting policies consistent 
with International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRSs) as adopted by the EU and in accordance with IAS 34 “Interim 
Financial Reporting”. The information provided in respect of year ended 31 December 2016 does not constitute statutory 
accounts as defined in Section 434 of the Companies Act 2006. A copy of the statutory accounts for that year has been 
delivered to the Registrar of Companies. The auditor’s report on those accounts was not qualified, did not draw attention 
to any matters by way of emphasis and did not contain statements under Section 498(2) or (3) of the Companies Act 
2006. 
The Interim Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements have been prepared on the going concern basis, as 
explained on page 9, and on the historical cost basis, except for certain assets and liabilities that have been measured 
at fair value (principally derivative financial instruments and acquired intangible assets). 
The Interim Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements were approved by the Board on 18 July 2017. 
 
 
Significant events and transactions 
The financial position and performance of the Group was particularly affected by the following events and transactions 
during the six months to 30 June 2017: 
 
On 10 February 2017, the Group acquired 100% of the issued equity of Opus Energy Group Limited (“Opus 
Energy”). The consolidated results for the period include the post-acquisition trading results of Opus Energy. In 
addition, intangible assets of £224 million have been recognised in the Group’s consolidated balance sheet. See 
note 8 for further details. 
 
On 13 April 2017, the Group acquired the assets of a compressed wood pellet manufacturing facility in Urania, 
Louisiana, USA. The assets, which were acquired via an auction for a total cost of $35 million, have been included 
in the Group’s property, plant and equipment at 30 June. Further details can be found in note 11. 
 
On 5 May 2017, the Group refinanced its debt facilities, replacing the existing term loans (including a £200 million 
facility drawn to part-fund the Opus Energy acquisition) and revolving credit facility with a high yield bond (comprised 
of £350 million fixed rate bonds and £200 million floating rate bonds) and a new £350 million revolving credit facility. 
Full details of new debt facilities are included in note 15. Interest costs, including those expensed as a result of the 
refinancing, are explained in note 3. 
 
Adoption of new and revised accounting standards 
Since the 2016 Annual Report and Accounts were published, the Group has not made any changes in its accounting 
policies which would result in retrospective adjustments to the published results. Note 19 contains information relating 
to the potential impact of three new IFRS standards which are in issue but not yet adopted by the Group, and which will 
be applicable from 1 January 2018 (IFRS 9 and IFRS 15) and 1 January 2019 (IFRS 16). 
The acquisition of Opus Energy has given rise to the recognition of intangible assets which will be amortised over their 
useful lives. The Group has not previously held any intangibles with a defined useful life. The judgements and estimates 
relating to the valuation and amortisation of these assets have been disclosed in note 8.   
 
Judgements and estimates  
12 
 
The judgements and estimates applied to the preparing of the Interim Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements 
are consistent with those described in detail on pages 117-118 of the Group’s Annual Report and Accounts for 2016, 
except for those noted below.  
As noted in section 3.1 (page 138) of the 2016 Annual Report, the useful economic lives of certain coal-specific assets 
have been reviewed. This followed the Government’s announcement to consult on the future closure of unabated coal-
fired generation. In the light of this announcement, it was concluded that coal generation will cease during 2025, but 
that the three coal units will be retained for conversion to alternative fuel sources after this date. An initial assessment 
of the coal-specific assets affected by this change suggested that depreciation charges would be increased by £27 
million per annum until 2025.  Following a detailed review of the assets that will be affected, the increase in depreciation 
charges is expected to be £15 million per annum. Accordingly, approximately half of this has been charged to the income 
statement for the six months ended 30 June 2017. The detailed review has also identified further Generation assets 
with a shortened useful life and additional one-off charge of £4 million has been charged in respect of these assets in 
the current period. 
Following the acquisition of Opus Energy, the Retail businesses have, where appropriate, aligned their judgements, 
estimates and approach. Key judgements that have been reflected in the condensed financial statements in respect of 
Opus Energy include: 
 
the valuation of land and buildings – these have been valued at their market value at the date of acquisition, 
resulting in a £2 million uplift in non-current assets;  
 
valuation of intangible assets – the key judgements in the valuations of these assets are disclosed in note 8; 
and  
 
the estimation of costs and revenues resulting from electricity and gas supplies to customers – these are 
aligned to the approaches taken on the existing Retail business, as disclosed in the 2016 Annual Report and 
Accounts.  
We have also reviewed the risk of impairment, as we did at 31 December 2016 (explained in Section 2.4 (page 130) of 
the 2016 Annual Report and Accounts). There have been no significant changes to the judgements and estimates made 
at 31 December 2016 in this respect. 
 
Alternative performance measures (APMs) 
We present two APMs (measures without formal definition within IFRS) on the face of our income statement to assist 
investors in evaluating the comparability of the Group’s financial performance and the performance against strategic 
objectives. 
EBITDA is the primary measure we use to assess our financial performance. The purpose of EBITDA is to provide a 
consistent, comparable measure of the trading performance of the Group’s businesses year on year. 
EBITDA is defined as earnings before interest, tax, depreciation, amortisation and material one-off items that do not 
reflect the underlying trading performance of the business. 
The purpose of underlying earnings is to provide a consistent, comparable measure of the overall financial performance 
of the Group’s businesses year on year, including costs of servicing the existing debt and tax. 
Underlying earnings is defined as profit after tax, as calculated in accordance with IFRS, adjusted to exclude unrealised 
gains and losses on derivative contracts and material one-off items that do not reflect the underlying performance of the 
business. 
EBITDA is reconciled to both gross profit and operating profit on the face of the income statement. A reconciliation of 
underlying earnings to profit after tax attributable to shareholders is provided in note 5.

Notes to the condensed consolidated financial statements 
 
1. General information 
These notes provide additional information about the disclosures within the condensed consolidated financial 
statements. Further information can be found in our 2016 Annual Report and Accounts on pages 117 – 166.  
Drax Group plc (the Company) is incorporated in England and Wales under the Companies Act. The Company and its 
subsidiaries (together, the Group) operate in the electricity, gas and heat markets within the UK. The address of the 
Company’s registered office and principal establishment is Drax Power Station, Selby, North Yorkshire, YO8 8PH, 
United Kingdom. 
 
2. Segmental reporting 
The Group is organised into three businesses, with a dedicated management team for each, and a central head office 
providing certain corporate functions. Our businesses are: 
- 
Generation: the generation of electricity at Drax Power Station; 
- 
Biomass Supply: production of sustainable compressed wood pellets at our processing facilities in the US; and 
- 
Retail: the supply of electricity and gas to business customers and wood pellets to the domestic heat market.  
Each of these business units is an operating segment for the purpose of segmental reporting. Information reported to 
the Board for the purposes of assessing performance and making investment decisions is organised into these three 
operating segments. The measure of profit or loss for each reportable segment presented to the Board on a regular 
basis is EBITDA (as defined on page 12).  
Operating costs are allocated to segments to the extent they are directly attributable to the activities of that segment. 
Unallocated costs are included in central operating costs. 
During the period, the Group acquired 100% of the share capital of Opus Energy Group Limited, a retail business 
supplying electricity and gas to business customers. This new acquisition forms part of the Retail segment, in line with 
the internal reporting structure for its results. Note 8 details the additional revenue and profit attributable to the Group 
from the new acquisition.  
The primary activities of the Group are affected by seasonality as described on page 9 and is reflected in the results 
below.

Interest, tax, assets and working capital are monitored on a Group basis with no separate disclosure by segment made 
in the management accounts, and hence no separate asset disclosure is provided in this report. However, investment 
on key capital projects at segment level is monitored.  
 
In the period, total capital investment was £79.0 million. The significant movements relate to expenditure of £27 million 
for the purchase of the assets of LaSalle Bioenergy within the US-based Biomass Supply segment and £15 million 
relating to the Retail segment, which is predominantly £10.4 million for a new office facility for Opus Energy. 
 
Major customers 
Total revenue for the six months ended 30 June 2017 includes amounts of £215 million and £204 million (H1 2016: 
£282.0 million and £222.7 million) derived from two customers (H1 2016: two customers), each representing 10% 
or more of the Group’s revenue for the period.

costs incurred to extinguish the existing debt together with the write off of the related deferred finance costs. Further 
information about the new finance structure can be found in note 15.

4. Taxation 
The tax charge includes both current and deferred tax. For interim periods, the tax charge is based upon the expected 
tax rate for the full year which is applied to taxable profits/losses for the interim period.  
Current tax, including UK corporation tax and foreign tax, is the amount payable on taxable profits (profit before tax 
adjusted for items upon which we are not required to pay tax, or in some cases for items upon which we are required to 
pay additional tax in respect of tax-disallowed expenditure) in the period. Deferred tax is an accounting adjustment which 
reflects where more or less tax is expected to arise in the future due to differences between the accounting and tax 
rules.

5. Underlying earnings 
Underlying earnings is defined as profit after tax, as calculated in accordance with IFRS, adjusted to exclude unrealised 
gains or losses on derivative contracts and material one-off items that do not reflect the underlying performance of the 
business.  
This note analyses the items which are included in our results for the current and previous periods but are excluded 
from underlying earnings: 
- 
Unrealised gains and losses on derivative contracts: calculated in accordance with IAS 39 and excluded due 
to the inherent volatility 
- 
Transaction and integration costs: costs associated with the acquisition and integration of Opus Energy have 
been excluded as material one-off costs incurred in the period 
- 
Cost of refinancing: material costs incurred as a result of the refinancing transactions and include break costs 
and the acceleration of amortisation of deferred finance costs associated with the previous facilities. 
- 
Deferred tax on start-up losses and other temporary differences: credit resulting from the recognition of a 
deferred tax asset in the Biomass Supply business. This was excluded from underlying earnings in 2016 as a 
material one-off item.

On 18 July 2017, the Board resolved to pay an interim dividend of 4.9 pence per share (£20 million), representing 40% 
of the expected full year dividend in line with our new dividend policy. The interim dividend will be paid on 6 October 
2017 and shares will be marked ex-dividend on 21 September 2017. 
The Group has sufficient retained profits, which are accessible by the Parent Company, for future distributions in 
accordance with the Group’s dividend policy. 
 
 
7. Earnings per share 
Earnings per share (EPS) represents the amount of our earnings (post-tax profits) attributable to each ordinary share 
or dilutive potential ordinary share we have in issue. Basic EPS is calculated by dividing our earnings by the weighted 
average number of ordinary shares in issue during the period. Diluted EPS demonstrates the impact upon the basic 
EPS if all outstanding share options, that are expected to vest on their future maturity dates, were exercised and treated 
as ordinary shares as at the balance sheet date. 
In addition to EPS, we calculate underlying EPS. Underlying EPS is based upon underlying earnings as defined in note 
5.  
Reconciliations of the weighted average number of shares used in the calculation are set out below.

8. Acquisition of Opus Energy
The acquisition of Opus Energy Group Limited (Opus Energy) was approved by shareholders on 8 February 2017 and 
subsequently completed on 10 February 2017. 
Opus Energy is a well-established energy retail business serving business customers in the SME market. Opus Energy 
has contributed positively to earnings and cash flow immediately following the acquisition and the combination provides 
a robust platform for future growth. 
The purchase consideration was £340 million plus interest calculated on the amount of Opus Energy’s net assets from 
31 March 2016 to the acquisition completion date. The total consideration was £367 million and was funded by a 
combination of existing cash reserves (£167 million) and partial drawing of a £375 million acquisition facility (£200 
million). This facility was repaid as part of the refinancing described in note 15. 
Acquisition related costs in the period amounted to £6.3 million and have been included in ‘transaction and integration’ 
costs on the income statement. 
The fair values of the identifiable assets acquired and the liabilities assumed were provisionally determined as follows:

These items exclude the effect of fair value adjustments included in the consolidated accounts. 
Following the acquisition, the Group has been able to identify and measure the fair value of existing customer contracts 
and relationships, the Opus Energy brand and software. The assets will be amortised over their useful economic lives 
as follows: 
 
Existing customer related assets 
11 years (reducing balance) 
 
Brand  
 
 
 
10 years (straight line) 
 
Software 
 
 
 
3 years (straight line) 
The fair value measurement of the existing customer contracts requires judgement and assumptions, in particular 
regarding margins on current customer contracts, future contract renewal rates and future margins on renewed 
contracts. The goodwill of £156 million initially recognised on acquisition is largely reflective of potential new customer 
contracts and relationships, and growth opportunities together with the assembled workforce. None of the goodwill is 
deductible for tax purposes. 
24 
 
The financial assets acquired include £128 million of receivables, the majority of which reflect the trade receivables for 
energy supplied to customers. By virtue of their short tenor, the fair value of these receivables is considered to be the 
contractual amounts receivable less any provision for doubtful debts. The provision for doubtful debts as at the 
acquisition date was £16 million. 
 
Pro forma information 
The pro forma consolidated results of the Group, assuming the acquisitions had been made at the beginning of the year, 
would show revenue of £353 million (compared to reported revenue of £263 million), EBITDA of £14 million, compared 
to the reported EBITDA of £12 million) and profit after taxation of £14 million (compared to reported profit after taxation 
of £11 million). This pro forma information includes the revenue and profits made by the acquired business between the 
beginning of the financial year and the date of acquisition, without accounting policy alignments and/or the impact of fair 
value uplifts resulting from purchase accounting considerations. This pro forma aggregated information is not 
necessarily indicative of the results of the combined Group that would have occurred had the acquisitions actually been 
made at the beginning of the year presented, or indicative of the future results of the combined Group.

11. Property, plant and equipment
On 13 April 2017, the Group acquired the wood pellet manufacturing plant owned by Louisiana Pellets Inc, for a 
consideration of $35 million (£27.4 million). The assets of the plant were acquired at auction through a bankruptcy court 
and do not constitute a business in their own right. At the point of acquisition, the plant was not operational, there was 
no workforce in place and no raw material contracts for it to operate as a business. In accordance with the requirements 
of IFRS 3 – business combinations, the acquisition has been accounted for as an asset acquisition.  
 
During the second half of the year, the plant will undergo a re-fit and re-commissioning period and will then provide 
additional wood pellet capacity in the region of 450k tonnes pa, playing an important part in Drax's strategy to build a 
flexible supply chain capable of self-supplying 30% of its generation requirement.

12.  Derivative financial instruments
We enter into forward contracts for the purchase and sale of physical commodities (principally power, gas, coal, 
sustainable biomass and CO2 emissions allowances) to secure market level bark and dark green spreads on future 
electricity sales and also financial contracts (principally currency exchange contracts, financial coal and oil derivatives) 
to fix Sterling cash flows. 
We hold these contracts for risk management purposes, to manage key risks facing the business including commodity 
price risk and foreign currency risk. 
At the balance sheet date all contracts (subject to certain exemptions described below) must be measured at fair value, 
which is in essence the difference between the price we have secured in the contract, and the price we could achieve 
in the market at that point in time. 
Changes in fair value are recognised either in the income statement or, if the contract in question qualifies as an effective 
hedge under IFRS, the hedge reserve. 
Where possible, the Group has taken advantage of the “own use” exemption which allows qualifying contracts to be 
excluded from fair value mark-to-market accounting and therefore not recognised in the financial statements until the 
contract is performed. This applies to certain contracts for physical commodities entered into and held for our own 
purchase, sale or usage requirements, including forward contracts for the purchase of biomass, and coal from domestic 
sources. It also applies to forward purchase contracts of electricity and gas for use in the Retail business. 
Contracts which do not qualify for the own use exemption are accounted for as derivatives in accordance with IAS 39 
and are recorded in the balance sheet at fair value, with changes in fair value reflected through the hedge reserve (note 
14) to the extent that the contracts are designated as effective hedges in accordance with IAS 39, or the income 
statement where the hedge accounting requirements are not met. The Group enters into forward contracts solely for the 
purpose of financial risk management and considers all of its contracts to be economic hedges, regardless of whether 
the specific criteria for hedge accounting are met. 
Forward contracts for the sale of power, purchase of coal from international sources, purchase of CO2 emissions 
allowances, gas (collectively “Commodity contracts”) and financial coal, financial oil and foreign currency exchange 
contracts (collectively “Financial contracts”) are recorded in the balance sheet at fair value as follows:

Net unrealised losses on our derivative contract portfolio in the first six months of 2017 were £200 million, with £65 
million recognised in the income statement and £135 million in the hedge reserve.  
The change in fair value of our derivative portfolio in the period has been driven predominantly by changes in currency 
exchange rates. 
We have a large portfolio of forward currency purchase contracts, which fixes the sterling cost of our future biomass fuel 
purchases denominated in foreign currencies. Given the size of the portfolio, its fair value is highly sensitive to changes 
in foreign currency exchange rates.  
 
Fair value measurement 
 
Commodity contracts fair value – The fair value of open commodity contracts that do not qualify for the own 
use exemption is calculated by reference to forward market prices at the balance sheet date. As contracts are 
generally short-term, forward market price curves are available for the duration of the contracts. The quoted market 
price used for financial assets held by the Group is the current bid price; the quoted price for financial liabilities is 
the current ask price.  
Financial contracts: 
 
Forward foreign currency exchange contracts fair value – The fair value of forward foreign currency exchange 
contracts is determined using forward currency exchange market rates at the balance sheet date.  
 
Other financial contracts fair value – The fair value of other financial contracts that do not qualify for the own 
use exemption, is calculated by reference to forward market prices at the balance sheet date. As contracts are 
generally short-term, forward market price curves are available for the duration of the contracts.  
The fair values of all derivative financial instruments are discounted to reflect the credit risk inherent within the 
instrument. 
The fair values of commodity contracts and financial contracts are largely determined by comparison between forward 
market prices and the contract price; therefore, these contracts are categorised as Level 2 of the fair value hierarchy. 
 
13. Other financial instruments
We hold a variety of other non-derivative financial instruments, including cash and cash equivalents, borrowings, 
payables and receivables arising from our operations. 
Fair value 
Cash and cash equivalents, short-term investments, trade and other receivables, and trade and other payables generally 
have short times to maturity. For this reason, their carrying values approximate to their fair value. The Group’s 
borrowings relate principally to the publicly traded high-yield bond and amounts drawn down against term loans. The 
financial liabilities have been measured at  amortised cost. The terms of the instruments have been reviewed for 
embedded derivatives. The bond notes contain an early repayment option that meets the definition of an embedded 
derivative, but this has not been separated as it is deemed to be closely related.  
At 30 June 2017, the fair value of the fixed and floating bond notes was £27 million in excess of the carrying value of 
£538 million (based on quoted market prices).

14. Hedge reserve
Changes in the fair value of our derivative contracts for purchases and sales of commodities and foreign currencies, to 
the extent that they qualify as effective cash flow hedges under accounting rules, are recognised in the hedge reserve, 
a component of shareholders’ equity. The cumulative gains and losses unwind and are released to the income statement 
as the related contracts mature and delivery is taken of the associated commodity or currency. 
 
The expected release profile from equity of post-tax hedging gains and losses is as follows:

15. Borrowings
On 5 May 2017, the Group undertook a refinancing exercise, repaying its existing term debt. The new financing structure 
includes £550 million high yield publicly traded bond listed on the Luxembourg exchange. This bond included £350 
million 4.25% fixed rate notes and £200 million floating rate notes of 4.00% above LIBOR. 
 
The Group continues to benefit from a Revolving Credit Facility (RCF), which has now been reduced to £350 million 
and incorporates £35 million of fully drawn term debt. The facility and the bond notes mature in April 2022.

18. Contingent Liabilities
Contingent liabilities are potential future outflows of cash that are dependent on a future event that is outside of our 
control. The amount and timing of any payment is uncertain, cannot be measured reliably, or is considered to be unlikely. 
Guaranteed Minimum Pension (GMP) 
The UK Government has begun implementing legislation to equalise the GMP, resulting in an increase in the value of 
GMP for males. This would correspondingly increase the defined benefit pension obligation of the Group. At present, 
the methodology for implementing the equalisation is uncertain and thus the impact cannot be reliably measured. As a 
result, no allowance has been made for GMP equalisation in the calculation of the defined benefit obligation within these 
condensed consolidated financial statements. 
Borrowings 
In addition to the amount drawn down against the bank loans, certain members of the Group guarantee the obligations 
of a number of banks in respect of letters of credit issued by those banks to counterparties of the Group. As at 30 June 
2017 the Group’s contingent liability in respect of letters of credit issued under the revolving credit facility amounted to 
£46.1 million (H1 2016: £44.9 million). 
 
19. Impact of standards issued but not yet applied by the entity
IFRS 9 – financial instruments 
The Group expects to adopt IFRS 9 in line with the 1 January 2018 effective date.  
The group does not expect the new requirements to have a significant impact on the classification or measurement of 
its financial assets. Further analysis is being performed to assess the likely quantum, if any, of change that may occur 
in the valuation of the Group’s trade receivable balances as a result of new impairment requirements in respect of 
financial assets. 
There will be no impact on the Group’s accounting for financial liabilities. 
New hedge accounting rules will align the accounting for hedging instruments more closely with the Group’s risk 
management practices. It is anticipated that more of the Group’s commodity contracts will qualify for hedge accounting 
under the new standard than under the existing standard. This may result in a greater proportion of unrealised gains 
and losses being recognised in the hedge reserve and an associated reduction in income statement volatility.  
IFRS 9 also introduces expanded disclosure requirements and changes in presentation. These are expected to change 
the nature and increase the extent of the group’s disclosures about its financial instruments, particularly in 2018 when 
the new standard is adopted.  
  
 
 
 
 
IFRS 15 – revenue from customer contracts 
30 
 
The Group’s impact assessment for the adoption of IFRS 15 is ongoing. The Group expects to adopt IFRS 15 in line 
with the effective date of 1 January 2018.  
Whilst further work is required to determine the impact on reported revenue, the Group will review and update its revenue 
recognition policies in light of the updated requirements.  
Based on the initial findings of this process, a material change to the quantum and timing of profitability is considered 
unlikely. The key focus area is in the Retail businesses due to the types of customer contracts. 
The new standard also introduces expanded disclosure requirements. These are expected to change the nature and 
extent of the group’s disclosures about its revenue recognition, particularly in 2018 when the new standard is adopted.   
 
IFRS 16 – leases 
The standard will affect primarily the accounting for the Group’s operating leases. As at the reporting date, the group 
has non-cancellable operating lease commitments of £29 million. However, the Group has not yet determined to what 
extent these commitments will result in the recognition of an asset and a liability for future payments and how this will 
affect the Group’s profit and classification of cash flows.    
Some of the commitments may be covered by the exception for short-term and low-value leases.    
The Group currently expects to adopt IFRS 16 in the period it becomes mandatory,  which is 1 January 2019 subject to 
EU endorsement.

Independent review report to Drax Group plc 
 
We have been engaged by the company to review the condensed set of financial statements in the half-yearly financial 
report for the six months ended 30 June 2017 which comprises the condensed consolidated income statement, the 
condensed consolidated statement of comprehensive income, condensed consolidated balance sheet, the condensed 
consolidated statement of changes in equity, the condensed consolidated cash flow statement and related notes 1 to 
19. We have read the other information contained in the half-yearly financial report and considered whether it contains 
any apparent misstatements or material inconsistencies with the information in the condensed set of financial 
statements. 
 
This report is made solely to the company in accordance with International Standard on Review Engagements (UK and 
Ireland) 2410 “Review of Interim Financial Information Performed by the Independent Auditor of the Entity” issued by 
the Auditing Practices Board.  Our work has been undertaken so that we might state to the company those matters we 
are required to state to it in an independent review report and for no other purpose. To the fullest extent permitted by 
law, we do not accept or assume responsibility to anyone other than the company, for our review work, for this report, 
or for the conclusions we have formed. 
 
Directors’ responsibilities 
The half-yearly financial report is the responsibility of, and has been approved by, the directors.  The directors are 
responsible for preparing the half-yearly financial report in accordance with the Disclosure and Transparency Rules of 
the United Kingdom’s Financial Conduct Authority. 
 
As disclosed on page 11, the annual financial statements of the group are prepared in accordance with IFRSs as 
adopted by the European Union.  The condensed set of financial statements included in this half-yearly financial report 
has been prepared in accordance with International Accounting Standard 34 “Interim Financial Reporting” as adopted 
by the European Union. 
 
Our responsibility 
Our responsibility is to express to the Company a conclusion on the condensed set of financial statements in the half-
yearly financial report based on our review. 
 
Scope of review  
We conducted our review in accordance with International Standard on Review Engagements (UK and Ireland) 2410 
“Review of Interim Financial Information Performed by the Independent Auditor of the Entity” issued by the Auditing 
Practices Board for use in the United Kingdom. A review of interim financial information consists of making inquiries, 
primarily of persons responsible for financial and accounting matters, and applying analytical and other review 
procedures. A review is substantially less in scope than an audit conducted in accordance with International Standards 
on Auditing (UK and Ireland) and consequently does not enable us to obtain assurance that we would become aware 
of all significant matters that might be identified in an audit. Accordingly, we do not express an audit opinion. 
 
Conclusion 
Based on our review, nothing has come to our attention that causes us to believe that the condensed set of financial 
statements in the half-yearly financial report for the six months ended 30 June 2017 is not prepared, in all material 
respects, in accordance with International Accounting Standard 34 as adopted by the European Union and the 
Disclosure and Transparency Rules of the United Kingdom’s Financial Conduct Authority.

Average percentage of time the units were available for generation. 
Bark spread 
The difference between the power price and the cost of biomass, net of renewable support. 
Contracts for difference (CfD) 
A mechanism to support investment in low-carbon electricity generation. The CfD works by stabilising revenues for 
generators at a fixed price level known as the “strike price”. Generators will receive revenue from selling their electricity 
into the market as usual. However, when the market reference price is below the strike price they will also receive a top-
up payment from suppliers for the additional amount. Conversely, if the reference price is above the strike price, the 
generator must pay back the difference. 
Dark green spread 
The difference between the power price and the cost of coal and carbon. 
EBITDA 
EBITDA is defined as earnings before interest, tax, depreciation, amortisation and material one-off items that do not 
reflect the underlying trading performance of the business. 
Grid charges 
Includes transmission network use of system charges (TNUoS), balancing services use of system charges (BSUoS) 
and distribution use of system charges (DUoS).
