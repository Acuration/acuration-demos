DCO requirements & conditions
•
DCO stipulates 23 requirements; they are effectively planning conditions
•
Some of these must be met prior to commencement of work on site
•
Drax is in process of discharging DCO requirements by submitting 
documentation, plans and schemes to local authorities for approval
To name a few of these requirements:
•
Landscaping and fencing plans – although final designs will be project -
specific
•
Highways Access
