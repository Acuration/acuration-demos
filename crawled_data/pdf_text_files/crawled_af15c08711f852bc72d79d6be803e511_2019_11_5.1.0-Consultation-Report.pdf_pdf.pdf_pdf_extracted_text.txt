Executive Summary 
1.1 
Introduction 
1.1.1 
Abergelli Power Limited (APL) is seeking to construct, operate and maintain 
a gas fired power station on open land located approximately 2 km north of 
junction 46 of the M4 within the administrative area of the City and County of 
Swansea Council (CCS).   
1.1.2 
The Project includes a Power Generation Plant (comprising Generating 
Equipment, an Access Road, temporary construction compound (a small 
area of which will be retained permanently), Ecological Mitigation Area and 
permanent parking and drainage), underground Gas Connection and 
underground Electrical Connection.  A full description of the Project is 
provided in section 2.4. 
1.1.3 
The Power Generation Plant is classified as a Nationally Significant 
Infrastructure Project (NSIP) under section 15 of the Planning Act 2008 (PA 
2008) and as such APL is applying to the Secretary of State (SoS) for a DCO 
for powers to construct, operate and maintain it.  APL will seek planning 
permission for the Gas Connection under the Town and Country Planning Act 
1990 (TCPA 1990) and the Electrical Connection under either the TCPA 1990 
or as permitted development under the Town and Country Planning (General 
Permitted Development) (England) Order 1995 (GPDO). 
1.2 
Purpose of the Report 
1.2.1 
This Consultation Report has been prepared in respect of the Project to 
satisfy S37(3) and S37(7) of the PA 2008. The Consultation Report sets out 
the approach to consultation, the consultation activities undertaken, the 
feedback received and its influence on the Project.  
1.2.2 
This Consultation Report is submitted as part of the Application for 
Development Consent to the SoS for Business, Energy and Industrial 
Strategy (BEIS). A separate translation of the Executive Summary of this 
Consultation Report has been prepared in Welsh (Document Reference 
5.1.1).  
1.3 
The Applicant 
1.3.1 
APL is the applicant for the Project. APL is registered in England and Wales 
(Company number 8190497) and is a wholly owned subsidiary of Drax 
(Company Number 05562053).   
1.3.2 
APL’s registered office is at Drax Power Station, Drax, Selby, North Yorkshire, 
United Kingdom, YO8 8PH.

1.4 
The Project 
1.4.1 
The Project includes: 
 A new Power Generation Plant in the form of an OCGT peaking 
power generating station, fuelled by natural gas and capable of 
providing a rated electrical output of up to 299 Megawatts (MW). The 
Power Generation Plant comprises:  
 The Generating Equipment including one Gas Turbine 
Generator with one exhaust gas flue stack and Balance of Plant 
(BOP) (together referred to as the Generating Equipment) 
which are located within the Generating Equipment Site;  
 An Access Road to the Project Site from the B4489 which lies 
to the west, formed by upgrading an existing access road 
between the B4489 junction and the Swansea North Substation 
(the Substation) and constructing a new section of access road 
from the Substation to the Generating Equipment Site;  
 A temporary construction compound for the storage of 
materials, plant and equipment as well as containing site 
accommodation and welfare facilities, temporary car parking 
and temporary fencing (the Laydown Area).  A small area 
within the Laydown Area will be retained permanently (the 
Maintenance Compound); 
 Ecological Mitigation Area – area for ecological enhancement 
within the Project Site Boundary. 
 Permanent parking and drainage to include: a site foul, oily 
water and surface water drainage system. 
 A new Gas Connection, in the form of a new above ground installation 
(AGI) and underground gas pipeline connection (the Pipeline), to bring 
natural gas to the Generating Equipment from the National 
Transmission System; and 
 A new Electrical Connection to export power from the Generating 
Equipment to the National Grid Electricity Transmission System 
(NETS). 
1.4.2 
The Project is situated on open land located approximately 2 km north of 
junction 46 of the M4 within the administrative area of CCS, approximately 1 
km southeast of Felindre and 1.4 km north of Llangyfelach.  
1.4.3 
The Power Generation Plant would have rated electrical output of up to 299 
MW of electricity and is therefore classified as a NSIP under the PA 2008.  As 
such, APL is applying to the SoS under the PA 2008 for a DCO for powers to 
construct, operate and maintain the Power Generation Plant. 
Consultation Report 
Abergelli Power Project 
 
 
3 
 
1.4.4 
The Gas Connection and Electrical Connection comprise development 
associated with the NSIP (“associated development”).  The PA 2008 restricts 
the ability to include associated development in a DCO for a generating 
station project under 350MW in Wales.  Development Consent is therefore 
not sought for the Gas Connection and Electrical Connection, although APL 
is seeking authorisation for powers of compulsory acquisition over the land 
required for the Gas Connection and Electrical Connection as part of the 
DCO.   
1.5 
Legislation and Guidance 
1.5.1 
This Consultation Report and the pre-application consultation process have 
been prepared and undertaken in accordance with the following requirements 
and guidance:  
Primary and Secondary Legislation  
 The PA 2008 (as amended);  
 The Infrastructure Planning (Environmental Impact Assessment) 
Regulations 2009 (as amended) (the EIA Regulations); and 
 The Infrastructure Planning (Applications: Prescribed Forms and 
Procedure) Regulations 2009 (as amended) (the APFP Regulations).  
Statutory Guidance and Non-Statutory Advice notes  
 The Planning Act 2008, Guidance on the pre-application process 
(Department for Communities and Local Government, March 2015) 
(“the PA 2008 DCLG pre-application guidance”); and 
 Advice note fourteen: Compiling the consultation report (PINS, 
Version 2: April 2012). 
1.5.2 
Appendix 1.A contains a compliance checklist which details the relevant 
components of legislation, guidance and advice applicable to the consultation 
process and this report and how these have been addressed by APL. 
1.6 
Overview of Consultation 
1.6.1 
APL has invested considerable time and resources during two phases of pre-
application consultation in respect of the Project in order to encourage 
meaningful involvement by the local community, those interested in the 
Project and the Project Site, Local Authorities and other prescribed 
consultees. Consequently, the Project has developed in a consultative and 
iterative manner, during successive stages of development and consultation.  
1.6.2 
The Project was initiated by APL in January 2014, following which non-
statutory and statutory consultation was undertaken.  In March 2015, it was 
decided by the previous owners of the Project to put it “on hold”, primarily 
Consultation Report 
Abergelli Power Project

because of the then market conditions for new power generation in the UK.  
However, after acquisition of APL by Drax Group plc (Drax) in December 
2016 (further described in section 2.3) the Project was publicly “re-launched” 
in April 2017. Consultation on the Project (statutory and non-statutory) has 
been undertaken over two phases: Phase 1 (January 2014 – March 2015) 
and Phase 2 (April 2017 – May 2018).  
1.6.3 
The two phases of pre-application consultation on the Project have involved 
several different strands (both non-statutory and statutory) which can be 
summarised as follows: 
Phase 1 Consultation (January 2014 – March 2015): 
 Non-Statutory (before, during and after statutory consultation)); 
 EIA Scoping (under the EIA Regulations); 
 Regulation 6 Notification (under the EIA Regulations); 
 S47 – Local Community; 
 S48 – Statutory Publicity; 
 Regulation 11 Notification (under the EIA Regulations); 
 S46 – Notification; and 
 S42 – Prescribed Consultees (S42(1)(a) prescribed persons; 
S42(1)(b) local authorities; and S42(1)(d) land interests). 
Phase 2 Consultation (April 2017 – May 2018): 
 Non-Statutory (before, during and after statutory consultation); 
 S47 – Local Community; 
 S48 – Statutory Publicity; 
 Regulation 11 Notification (under the EIA Regulations); 
 S46 – Notification; and 
 S42 – Prescribed Consultees (S42(1)(a) prescribed persons; 
S42(1)(b) local authorities; and S42(1)(d) land interests). 
1.6.4 
Consultation on the Project has generated significant levels of interest and 
participation from a broad spectrum of consultees. This Consultation Report 
recognises that certain members of the local community expressed concerns 
about the Project and its potential impacts. Equally, this Consultation Report 
acknowledges that the Project has received expressions of support.

1.6.5 
Both supporters and objectors of the Project have been able to contribute to 
its development since 2014. Significant design and Project decisions were 
either directly or indirectly influenced by the consultation undertaken. This is 
reflected, in particular, by the significant changes to the design of the Project 
which were undertaken during and following the Phase 1 consultation. 
1.6.6 
Figure 1-1 below summarises the key stages of the development of the 
Project, and highlights the interaction between the consultation, assessment 
and design stages.

statutory consultation, at an early stage of the Project's development.  This 
allowed APL to introduce the Project to the public and gain early feedback 
from other consultees.  This period of consultation comprised consultation 
with CCS, Planning Inspectorate (PINS), Natural Resources Wales (NRW), 
interested parties, locally elected representatives and the local community. 
1.7.2 
At the commencement of Phase 1 non-statutory consultation, several options 
were under consideration relating to the design of the Project: 
 Two possible access routes; 
 Two possible options for connecting the Generating Equipment to a 
suitable source of fuel gas; 
 Four possible options for the Gas Connection route corridor (within 
an identified Gas Connection Opportunity Area); 
 Two possible Electrical Connection options to export power from the 
Generating Equipment to the NETS: 
o Underground Cable; or 
o Overhead line 
 Options for the Electrical Connection route corridor within an 
identified Electrical Connection Opportunity Area to the south-west of 
the Generating Equipment Site; 
 Up to 5 Gas Turbine Generators with up to 5 Stacks; 
 Stacks up to 60 m (height) and up to 10 m (diameter); and 
 Indicative Layout of the Power Generation Plant Site. 
1.7.3 
As outlined within the EIA Scoping Report (Appendix 3.A.II) and chapter 5 of 
the ES (Document Reference 6.1), the following technology options were 
originally considered for the Power Generation Plant: OCGT plant; Combined 
Cycle Gas Turbine (CCGT) plant; and Reciprocating Gas Engines (RGE) 
plant.  OCGT is considered to be the most suitable technology choice for 
generating up to 299 MW as a peaking plant at the Project Site based on 
environmental, technical and feasibility considerations, relating to: visual 
impact, water resources, noise and available space, financial considerations, 
and start-up times.  OCGT was therefore presented as the preferred 
technology choice for the Project during Phase 1 non-statutory consultation.

1.7.4 
The potential for using CHP opportunities with these technologies was also 
considered (as explained within the EIA Scoping Opinion (Appendix 3.A.II) 
and the CHP Technical Note contained within Appendix 5.1 of the ES 
(Document Reference 6.2)); however, it is not technically or economically 
feasible with the selection of a OCGT peaking power station.  As such, CHP 
was not included as part of the Project during Phase 1 non-statutory 
consultation. 
1.7.5 
APL consulted CCS, PINS, locally elected representatives and interested 
parties about the Project through a number of briefing meetings (Appendix 
2.D) and discussions during non-statutory consultation throughout 2014, prior 
to Phase 1 statutory consultation. APL consulted the local community in June 
2014 at three exhibitions at local venues within the administrative area of CCS 
and in proximity to the Project Site.   
1.7.6 
The exhibitions were advertised by a number of means including a leaflet 
delivered to the local community (in English and Welsh) (Appendices 2.A.IV 
and 2.A.V), a letter sent to locally elected representatives (in English and 
Welsh) (Appendices 2.A.I and 2.A.II), posters displayed at community venues 
(in English and Welsh) (Appendices 2.A.VII, 2.A.VIII and 2.A.IX), a press 
release (Appendix 2.A.X) and newspaper advert (in English and Welsh) 
(Appendix 2.A.XI).  Consultation materials available at the exhibitions 
included exhibition boards (Appendices 2.B.I and 2.B.II), leaflets outlining 
details of the Project (Appendices 2.B.III and 2.B.IV) and feedback forms 
(Appendices 2.B.V and 2.B.VI), all available in both English and Welsh. 
1.7.7 
Approximately 38.3% of those who attended an exhibition in June 2014 
returned a feedback form (‘the respondents’).  Approximately 25% of 
respondents who returned a feedback form during initial non-statutory 
consultation were supportive of the Project, and approximately 30.6% of 
respondents who returned a feedback form (Appendices 2.B.V and 2.B.VI) 
were not supportive of the Project.  Approximately 44.4% of respondents were 
undecided, neutral or did not answer.  A number of respondents requested 
further information about the Project and raised concerns regarding the 
visual, socio-economic and traffic impacts (as summarised in Appendix 6.A).  
Some respondents queried the need for the Project and questioned why the 
Project Site had been selected (as summarised in Appendix 6.A). 
EIA Scoping (June 2014 – August 2014) 
1.7.8 
The DCO Application must be supported by an Environmental Statement (ES) 
(Document Reference 6.1), reporting on the outputs of an Environmental 
Impact Assessment (EIA). 
1.7.9 
In accordance with the EIA Regulations, an EIA Scoping Report (Appendix 
3.A.II) was submitted to the Secretary of State on 25th June 2014 with a 
request for an EIA Scoping Opinion in order to determine the required scope 
of the EIA.  A Scoping Opinion (Appendix 3.B.II) was received from the 
Secretary of State on 1st August 2014, following consultation with statutory 
consultees.  As set out within the Scoping Opinion (Appendix 3.B.II), the 
Consultation Report 
Abergelli Power Project 
 
 
10 
 
Secretary of State was satisfied that the details of the EIA Scoping Report 
encompassed the matters identified in the EIA Regulations.  
1.7.10 
The Scoping Opinion (Appendix 3.B.II) included the Secretary of State’s 
comments on the Project, EIA approach and topic areas, as well as a list of 
all organisations consulted (Appendix 3.B.III).  The Scoping Opinion 
(Appendix 3.B.II) response was considered in undertaking the EIA and in the 
production of the 2014 Preliminary Environmental Information Report (2014 
PEIR). 
Phase 1 Statutory Consultation (October 2014 – November 2014) 
1.7.11 
APL engaged in a series of consultation activities in accordance with the 
statutory requirements of the PA 2008; the EIA Regulations; and the APFP 
Regulations.  The Phase 1 statutory consultation consisted of: 
 S47 consultation on the draft 2014 SoCC; 
 S47 consultation with the local community; 
 S48 publicity (including notification under Regulation 11 of the EIA 
Regulations); 
 S46 notification; 
 S42 consultation; and 
 Additional S42 consultation with parties identified from Land Registry 
searches after s42 consultation had begun. 
1.7.12 
During Phase 1 statutory consultation, several options were still under 
consideration relating to the design of the Project: 
 Two possible access routes to the Power Generation Plant Site; 
 Up to 5 Gas Turbine Generators with 5 associated stacks; 
 Stacks at a height of between 35 m (minimum) and 40 m (maximum) 
and up to 10m in diameter;  
 Route alignments of the Gas Connection and Electrical Connection; 
and 
 Indicative layout of the Power Generation Plant. 
S47 consultation on the draft 2014 SoCC 
1.7.13 
APL produced a draft 2014 SoCC (Appendix 4.A.II) to explain how APL 
intended to consult with the local community regarding the Project, and thus 
how APL would satisfy the consultation requirements for an Application under 
Consultation Report 
Abergelli Power Project

the PA 2008.  In accordance with S47 of the PA 2008, APL undertook formal 
statutory consultation with CCS on the draft 2014 SoCC for a period of 28 
days from 31st July 2014 to 27th August 2014.  APL took into account 
comments received from CCS (Appendix 4.A.IV) relating to the display of 
consultation materials prior to publication of the SoCC and SoCC Notice. 
1.7.14 
The 2014 SoCC Notice was published in both English and Welsh in the South 
Wales Evening Post on 30th September 2014 (Appendix 4.A.VII) and 7th 
October 2014 (Appendix 4.A.VIII) and the 2014 SoCC was made available on 
the Project website, in local libraries and CCS’s council offices from 30th 
September 2014. 
Phase 1 S47 Consultation with the Local Community  
1.7.15 
Statutory S47 consultation was undertaken with the local community in 
October and November 2014 for a period of 35 days in accordance with the 
published 2014 SoCC (Appendices 4.A.V and 4.A.VI). Four exhibitions were 
held at separate venues in the vicinity of the Project Site. The Project and 
exhibitions were publicised via a number of different methods, including 
letters to locally elected representatives (in English and Welsh) (Appendices 
4.D.IV and 4.D.V), letters to ‘hard to reach’ groups (in English and Welsh) 
(Appendices 4.D.II and 4.D.III), distribution of leaflets (in English and Welsh) 
(Appendix 4.D.VII), local newspaper adverts (in English and Welsh) 
(Appendix 4.G), posters (in English and Welsh) (Appendices 4.D.X, 4.D.XI 
and 4.D.XIII) and media coverage (Appendix 4.K). The consultation materials 
available at statutory exhibitions included the 2014 SoCC (available in English 
and Welsh) (Appendices 4.A.V and 4.A.VI); the 2014 PEIR NTS (available in 
English and Welsh) (Appendix 4.C), the 2014 PEIR, including Figures and 
Appendices; exhibition boards (available in English and Welsh) (Appendices 
4.E.I and 4.E.II), leaflets (available in English and Welsh) (Appendix 4.E.III), 
plans and photomontages (Appendix 4.E.VI) and a feedback form (available 
in English and Welsh) (Appendices 4.E.IV and 4.E.V).  
1.7.16 
A total of 106 people from the local community attended the four exhibitions, 
of whom approximately 49% returned a feedback form (Appendices 4.E.IV 
and 4.E.V).  Approximately 33% of all respondents were supportive of the 
Project.  Approximately 17% of all respondents were not supportive of the 
Project, and approximately 50% of all respondents were neutral, undecided 
or did not respond.  Respondents' comments most commonly related to the 
following topic themes: site selection, landscape, transport, community 
benefit, need for the Project, and socio-economics. 
Phase 1 S48 Publicity 
1.7.17 
In accordance with S48 of the PA 2008 and Regulation 4 of the APFP 
Regulations, a notice publicising the Project was published in The 
Independent (Appendix 4.G.I) and London Gazette (Appendix 4.G.II) on 6th 
October 2014 and in the South Wales Evening Post on 6th October (Appendix 
4.G.III) and 13th October 2014 (Appendix 4.G.IV).

1.7.18 
APL did not receive any consultation responses that identified themselves as 
responding to S48 publicity although it is likely that S48 publicity will have had 
an influence on some consultees in accessing S42 / S47 consultation 
materials. 
Phase 1 Regulation 11 Notification 
1.7.19 
In accordance with Regulation 11 of the EIA Regulations, on 2nd October 2014 
APL sent a copy of the S48 notice (in English and Welsh) (Appendices 4.G.V 
and 4.G.VI) and a covering letter (Appendix 4.H.I) to consultation bodies and 
persons notified to APL by the Secretary of State under Regulation 9 of the 
EIA Regulations (Appendix 4.H.II).  The covering letter (Appendix 4.H.I) 
stated APL's intention to apply to the SoS for a DCO and explained that, under 
S48 of the PA 2008, APL would be publishing a notice of the proposed 
Application in the London Gazette (Appendix 4.G.II), The Independent 
(Appendix 4.G.I) and the South Wales Evening Post (Appendices 4.G.III and 
4.G.IV). 
Phase 1 S46 Notification 
1.7.20 
In accordance with S46 of the PA 2008, APL notified the SoS of the proposed 
application (Appendices 4.J.I and 4.J.II) and issued a copy of the S42 
consultation information to PINS on 8th October 2014, prior to the 
commencement of statutory S42 consultation. 
Phase 1 S42 Consultation 
1.7.21 
APL undertook statutory consultation with prescribed consultees (Appendix 
4.I.I) between 13th October and 16th November 2014 for a period of 35 days.  
The consultation materials comprised a covering letter (in English and Welsh) 
(Appendices 4.I.II and 4.I.III), a copy of the 2014 PEIR NTS (in English and 
Welsh) (Appendix 4.C), a CD or hard copy of the 2014 PEIR and the leaflet 
distributed to the local community (Appendix 4.D.VII).   
1.7.22 
Following amendments to the application boundary and ongoing diligent 
enquiry, six additional land interests were identified.  APL subsequently 
undertook additional S42 consultation with additional land interests between 
December 2014 and March 2015, with a request for comments within 28 days 
(Appendices 4.I.IV and 4.I.V). 
1.7.23 
A total of 20 S42(1)(a) (Prescribed Persons), one S42(1)(b) and nine 
S42(1)(d) responses were received (Appendices 6.C and 6.D).  Respondents’ 
comments most commonly related to the following topic themes: consultation 
process, air quality, EIA, safety, water, and noise (Appendices 6.C and 6.D). 
Non-Statutory Consultation during Phase 1 Statutory Consultation 
1.7.24 
APL continued to engage with CCS, PINS, locally elected representatives and 
interested parties about the Project during the Phase 1 statutory consultation.  
On 20th October, APL issued a draft contact plan (Appendix 4.L.I) to PINS 
Consultation Report 
Abergelli Power Project 
 
 
13 
 
setting out the proposed APL project milestones and anticipated contact with 
PINS up to submission of DCO application.  On 23rd October 2014, APL held 
an update meeting with CCS (Appendix 4.L.II) to discuss the statutory 
consultation and public exhibitions, the Application programme to 
submission, PINS outreach meeting and site visit and to identify any 
outstanding issues and information requirements.   
Non-Statutory Consultation Post-Phase 1 Statutory Consultation 
1.7.25 
A number of additional non-statutory consultation activities were undertaken 
by APL following the Phase 1 statutory consultation. 
1.7.26 
The Design Commission for Wales (DCfW) Design Review Panel provided 
an independent assessment of the Project in December 2014 and published 
a Design Review Report in January 2015 (Appendix 5.A.III).  The Design 
Review Report (Appendix 5.A.III) included DCfW’s comments regarding the 
Project’s proposed approach to design.   
1.7.27 
APL held an outreach meeting with PINS on 9th December 2014 (Appendix 
5.B) in order to discuss the Application for Development Consent, the latest 
update on the Project and stakeholder specific issues (relating to top level 
design, CHP, noise, access, and NRW).  The meeting was also attended by 
representatives of CCS, representatives of NRW, and Councillors for Mawr 
and Llangyfelach Community Council. 
1.7.28 
Following the selection of the proposed Access Route and amendments to 
the application boundary for the Project, APL wrote to all S42 prescribed 
consultees and locally elected representatives (Appendix 5.D) on 26th 
January 2015 inviting any further comments to be made on the Project by 16th 
February 2015.   
1.7.29 
On 6th March 2015, APL wrote to S42(1)(b) local authorities to request an 
informal response as to the perceived adequacy of consultation (Appendix 
5.E.II).  CCS responded on 12th March 2015 stating that consultation has 
been carried out in accordance with 2014 SoCC and noting that APL has 
engaged adequately with CCS, the local community and other interested 
parties as the Project has developed (Appendix 5.E.III). 
1.7.30 
Following further amendments to the application boundary for the Project, in 
order to accommodate all necessary ecological mitigation, APL wrote to all 
S42 prescribed consultees and locally elected representatives on 10th March 
2015 inviting any further comments to be made (Appendix 5.D).  No 
significant concerns were raised in response to the information update in 
January 2015 (Appendix 6.E).   
1.7.31 
In March 2015, it was decided by the previous owners of the Project to put it 
“on hold” primarily because of the then market conditions for new power 
generation in the UK.

Phase 2 Consultation (April 2017 – May 2018) 
Phase 2 Non-Statutory Consultation (prior to Phase 2 Statutory 
Consultation) 
1.8.1 
After acquisition of APL by Drax in December 2016 the Project was publicly 
“re-launched” in April 2017.   
1.8.2 
In April 2017, APL undertook non-statutory consultation, prior to Phase 2 
statutory consultation, with CCS, PINS, NRW, interested parties, locally 
elected representatives, previous consultees and the local community. 
1.8.3 
The Phase 2 non-statutory consultation activities primarily comprised a series 
of phone calls, meetings, site visits and email correspondence, focused 
towards: 
 informing those who were not involved with Phase 1 consultation about 
the Project; 
 updating those who were previously consulted during the Phase 1 
consultation on the changes to the Project; 
 explaining why the Project was progressing once again towards 
submission of a DCO application;  
 clarifying the consenting framework for the Project; and 
 asking for informal feedback from consultees on the Project. 
1.8.4 
Phase 2 non-statutory consultation helped to inform decisions on several 
aspects of the Project by January 2018. 
1.8.5 
At the commencement of Phase 2 statutory consultation, there were still 
several design options under consideration as set out below at paragraph 
1.8.10. 
EIA Scoping 
1.8.6 
APL discussed the validity of the 2014 EIA Scoping Opinion (Appendix 3.B.II) 
with PINS in March 2017.  New regulations governing EIA came into force on 
16 May 2017.  However, Regulation 37 of the Infrastructure Planning 
(Environmental Impact Assessment) Regulations 2017 contain transitional 
provisions which provide that where an applicant had sought an EIA 
screening or scoping opinion prior to the date the regulations came into force, 
the EIA regulations would continue to apply.  PINS confirmed the 2014 EIA 
Scoping Opinion (Appendix 3.B.II) remained valid and therefore the Project 
has continued to be assessed under the EIA Regulations.  The Scoping 
Opinion (Appendix 3.B.II) response was considered in undertaking the EIA 
and in the production of the 2018 PEIR.

Phase 2 Statutory Consultation  
1.8.7 
APL engaged in a further series of consultation activities in accordance with 
the statutory requirements of the PA 2008; the EIA Regulations; and the 
APFP Regulations.   
1.8.8 
As per the earlier Phase 1 statutory consultation, the Phase 2 statutory 
consultation consisted of: 
 S47 consultation on the draft 2018 SoCC; 
 S47 consultation with the local community; 
 S48 publicity (including notification under Regulations 11 of the EIA 
Regulations); 
 S46 notification; 
 S42 consultation; and 
 Additional S42 consultation with parties identified from Land Registry 
searches after s42 consultation had begun. 
 
1.8.9 
Further to feedback received during Phase 1 consultation and Phase 2 non-
statutory consultation, as well as further design and operational 
considerations, several changes were made to the Project which were 
explained and were the subject of Phase 2 statutory consultation: 
 Power Generation Plant: 
o The Power Generation Plant was made up of only one Gas 
Turbine Generator with one exhaust gas flue stack, rather than 
up to five; 
o The stack height was a maximum of 45 m, instead of 40 m; 
o The Generating Equipment Site was moved north of the Welsh 
Water Water Main (Water Main); 
o An access route was selected from the B4489 to the west of the 
Generating Equipment instead of the alternative construction 
access route from the north; and 
o Two onsite options for the new section of the Access Road were 
presented. 
 Electrical Connection: 
o The Electrical Connection runs alongside the road rather than 
under for ease of maintenance. 
Consultation Report 
Abergelli Power Project

1.8.10 
Accordingly, several options were under consideration during Phase 2 
consultation, including: 
 The final layout and location of the Generating Equipment; and 
 The proposed route option(s) for the new section of Access Road. 
S47 2018 SoCC Consultation 
1.8.11 
APL produced a draft 2018 SoCC (Appendix 9.A) to explain how APL 
intended to consult with the local community regarding the Project during 
Phase 2 consultation, and thus how APL would satisfy the consultation 
requirements for an Application under the PA 2008.  The draft 2018 SoCC 
(Appendix 9.A) proposed a similar methodology for consultation to that set 
out in the 2014 SoCC (Appendix 4.A).    
1.8.12 
In accordance with S47 of the PA 2008, APL undertook formal statutory 
consultation with CCS by issuing the draft 2018 SoCC (Appendix 9.A) on 8th 
November 2017 and requesting a response within 28 days.  A response was 
received from CCS on 1st December 2018 (Appendix 9.A.VII).  APL took into 
account comments received from CCS relating to the format the consultation 
documents would be provided in (as hard or electronic copies), which 
consultation documents would be provided in Welsh, and the clarity of the 
project description, prior to publication of the 2018 SoCC and 2018 SoCC 
Notice (Appendix 9.B). 
1.8.13 
The 2018 SoCC Notice (Appendix 9.B) was published in both English and 
Welsh in the South Wales Evening Post on 2nd January 2018 (Appendix 
9.B.III) and 9th January 2018 (Appendix 9.B.IV).  The 2018 SoCC (Appendix 
9.B) was published on the Project website on 2nd January 2018 and made 
available in local libraries from 2nd January 2018, where it remained available 
during the Phase 2 statutory consultation. 
S47 Consultation with the Local Community 
1.8.14 
Statutory Phase 2 S47 consultation was undertaken with the local community 
in January and February 2018 for a period of 35 days in accordance with the 
published 2018 SoCC (Appendix 9.B).  
1.8.15 
Four exhibitions were held at separate venues in the vicinity of the Project 
Site. The Project and exhibitions were publicised via a number of different 
methods, including letters to locally elected representatives (Appendices 
9.D.II – 9.D.IV), leaflets to ‘hard to reach’ groups (in English and Welsh) 
(Appendices 9.D.V – 9.D.VII), leaflet distribution (in English and Welsh) 
(Appendix 9.D.I), local newspaper adverts (in English and Welsh) (Appendix 
9.D.XII), posters (Appendices 9.D.VIII – 9.D.XI) and external media coverage 
(Appendix 9.J). The consultation materials available at statutory exhibitions 
included the 2018 PEIR NTS (Appendices 9.H.I and 9.H.II), exhibition boards 
(Appendices 9.E.I and 9.E.II), leaflets (Appendix 9.H.III) and a feedback form 
(Appendices 9.H.IV and 9.H.V), all available in both English and Welsh.

1.8.16 
A total of approximately 110 people from the local community attended the 
four exhibitions, of whom approximately 26% returned a feedback form 
(Appendices 9.E.IV and 9.E.V).  Approximately 34.5% of all respondents were 
supportive of the Project.  Approximately 24% of all respondents were not 
supportive of the Project, and approximately 41% of all respondents were 
neutral, undecided or did not respond.  Respondents' comments most 
commonly related to the following topic themes: need for the Project, 
landscape, transport, air quality, noise and socio-economics. 
S48 Publicity 
1.8.17 
In accordance with S48 of the PA 2008 and Regulation 4 of the APFP 
Regulations, a notice publicising the Project was published in the South 
Wales Evening Post on 2nd January 2018 (Appendix 9.F.V) and 9th January 
2018 (Appendix 9.F.VI) and in The Times (Appendix 9.V.III) and London 
Gazette (Appendix 9.F.IV) on 9th January 2018.  
1.8.18 
APL did not receive any consultation responses that identified themselves as 
responding to S48 publicity although it is likely that S48 publicity will have had 
an influence on some consultees in accessing S42 / S47 consultation 
materials. 
Regulation 11 Notification 
1.8.19 
In accordance with Regulation 11 of the EIA Regulations, APL sent a copy of 
the Phase 2 S48 notice (in English and Welsh) (Appendices 9.F.I and 9.F.II) 
and a covering letter (Appendix 9.F.VII) to consultation bodies and persons 
notified to APL on 2nd January 2018.  The covering letter (Appendix 9.F.VII) 
stated APL's intention to apply to the SoS for a DCO and explained that, under 
S48 of the PA 2008, APL would be publishing a notice of the proposed 
Application in the London Gazette (Appendix 9.F.IV), The Times (Appendix 
9.F.III) and the South Wales Evening Post (Appendices 9.F.V and 9.F.VI). 
S42 – Prescribed Consultees 
1.8.20 
APL undertook statutory consultation with prescribed consultees (Appendix 
9.G.I) between 16th January and 19th February 2018 for a period of 35 days.  
The consultation materials comprised a covering letter (Appendices 9.G.I, 
9.G.II, 9.G.III and 9.G.IV), a copy of the 2018 PEIR NTS (in English) 
(Appendices 9.H.I and 9.H.II), a copy of the S47 consultation leaflet (in

version was also issued to CCS and NRW), and a CD of the No Significant 
Effects Report (Appendix 9.H.III) and Welsh language version of the 2018 
PEIR NTS (Appendix 9.H.II).  A replacement Figure from the 2018 PEIR was 
issued following the commencement of statutory consultation to all s42 
consultees. 
1.8.21 
Following ongoing diligent enquiry, four additional land interests were 
identified.  APL subsequently undertook additional S42 consultation with 
additional land interests between 22nd January 2018 and 27th February 2018

Introduction and Context 
2.1 
Introduction 
2.1.1 
Abergelli Power Limited (APL) proposes to construct, operate and maintain 
an Open Cycle Gas Turbine (OCGT) peaking power generating station (the 
Power Generation Plant) and new connections to the gas and electricity 
networks on land adjacent to the Felindre Gas Compressor Station at 
Abergelli Farm, Felindre, Swansea SA5 7NN (the Project).   
2.1.2 
The Power Generation Plant would have rated electrical output of up to 299 
MW of electricity and is therefore classified as a Nationally Significant 
Infrastructure Project (NSIP) under section 15 of the Planning Act 2008 (as 
amended) (PA 2008).  As such, APL is applying to the Secretary of State 
(SoS) for Business, Energy and Industrial Strategy under section 31 of the 
PA 2008 for a Development Consent Order (DCO) for powers to construct, 
operate and maintain the Power Generation Plant (the “authorised 
development”). 
2.1.3 
The Project was initiated by APL in January 2014 and extensive consultation 
was undertaken throughout 2014.  In March 2015, it was decided by the 
previous owners of the Project to put it “on hold” primarily because of the then 
market conditions for new power generation in the UK.  However, after 
acquisition of APL by Drax Group plc (Drax) in December 2016 (further 
described in section 2.3 below) the Project was publicly “re-launched” in April 
2017.  Subsequently, a second phase of consultation was undertaken by APL 
in early 2018 after the Project was relaunched.  This Consultation Report 
refers to the two phases of consultation as follows: 
 Phase 1 consultation (including non-statutory and statutory 
consultation from January 2014 until March 2015) (chapters 6 and 8); 
and 
 Phase 2 consultation (including non-statutory and statutory 
consultation from April 2017 until submission of the DCO Application 
in May 2018) (chapters 7 and 9). 
2.2 
Purpose of the Report 
2.2.1 
This Consultation Report has been produced to satisfy S37(3) and S37(7) of 
the PA 2008 and accompanies APL’s Application for a DCO to the SoS for 
Business, Energy and Industrial Strategy. The Application will be submitted 
via PINS to the SoS who will review the application for acceptance for 
examination by an appointed Examining authority who will make a 
recommendation to the SoS. The final decision on whether and in what form 
to make the DCO is taken by the SoS. 
2.2.2 
The Consultation Report sets out the non-statutory and statutory consultation 
activities that have been undertaken in support of the Project during Phase 1

The Project 
Project Description 
2.4.1 
The Project includes: 
 A new Power Generation Plant in the form of an OCGT peaking 
power generating station, fuelled by natural gas and capable of 
providing a rated electrical output of up to 299 Megawatts (MW). The 
Power Generation Plant comprises:  
 The Generating Equipment including one Gas Turbine 
Generator with one exhaust gas flue stack and Balance of Plant 
(BOP) (together referred to as the Generating Equipment) 
which are located within the Generating Equipment Site;  
 An Access Road to the Project Site from the B4489 which lies 
to the west, formed by upgrading an existing access road 
between the B4489 junction and the Swansea North Substation 
(the Substation) and constructing a new section of access road 
from the Substation to the Generating Equipment Site;  
 A temporary construction compound for the storage of 
materials, plant and equipment as well as containing site 
accommodation and welfare facilities, temporary car parking 
and temporary fencing (the Laydown Area).  A small area 
within the Laydown Area will be retained permanently (the 
Maintenance Compound); 
 Ecological Mitigation Area – area for ecological enhancement 
within the Project Site Boundary; and 
Consultation Report 
Abergelli Power Project 
 
 
23 
 
 Permanent parking and drainage to include: a site foul, oily 
water and surface water drainage system. 
 A new Gas Connection, in the form of a new above ground installation 
(AGI) and underground gas pipeline connection (the Pipeline), to bring 
natural gas to the Generating Equipment from the National 
Transmission System; and 
 A new Electrical Connection to export power from the Generating 
Equipment to the National Grid Electricity Transmission System 
(NETS). 
2.4.2 
The Power Generation Plant, Gas Connection, and Electrical Connection, 
together with all access requirements are referred to as the “Project”.  The 
Generating Equipment, Laydown Area, Access Road, Ecological Mitigation 
Area and permanent parking and drainage are together known as the “Power 
Generation Plant”. 
Location 
2.4.3 
APL proposes to construct, operate and maintain the Project on land at 
Abergelli Farm, Felindre, Swansea SA5 7NN.   
2.4.4 
The Project is situated on open land located approximately 2 km north of 
junction 46 of the M4 within the administrative area of CCS, approximately 1 
km southeast of Felindre and 1.4 km north of Llangyfelach.  
2.4.5 
The land upon which the Project would be developed, or which would be 
required in order to facilitate the development of the Project, is referred to as 
the “Order Land”. and is shown on the Land Plans (Document Reference 2.2). 
The Order Land covers an area of up to approximately 35 ha. 
2.4.6 
The extent of the works for which development consent is sought in the DCO 
(together with relevant limits of deviation) is referred to as the “Order Limits” 
and is shown on the Works Plans (Document Reference 2.3). 
2.4.7 
Drawing No. J0008302-18-200A, contained within the Annexe to this 
Consultation Report, shows the extent of the Order Land and the Order 
Limits.  
Consenting Framework and Consultation Scope 
2.4.8 
The Power Generation Plant would have rated electrical output of up to 299 
MW of electricity and is therefore classified as a NSIP under the PA 2008.  As 
such, APL is applying to the SoS under the PA 2008 for a DCO for powers to 
construct, operate and maintain the Power Generation Plant. The 
construction, operation and maintenance of the Power Generation Plant 
comprises the “authorised development” to which the DCO application 
applies. 
Consultation Report 
Abergelli Power Project 
 
 
24 
 
2.4.9 
Under the PA 2008, APL is required to consult on the application for the DCO 
with a wide range of consultees, including statutory consultees, local 
authorities, owners, lessees, tenants, those with an interest in the land and 
the local community. The scope of consultation carried out by APL covers 
both the authorised development being applied for under the PA 2008 and in 
relation to the Order Land over which powers of compulsory acquisition are 
sought.  Therefore, consultation has been undertaken by APL in respect of 
the authorised development and the full extent of the Order Land. 
2.4.10 
The Gas Connection and Electrical Connection comprise development 
associated with the NSIP (“associated development”).  The PA 2008 restricts 
the ability to include associated development in a DCO for a generating 
station project in Wales to development that is associated with a generating 
station with a capacity in excess of 350MW.  As the Power Generation Plant 
would have rated electrical output of up to 299 MW, associated development 
to the Power Generation Plant cannot be included in APL's application for a 
DCO under the PA 2008. Development Consent is therefore not sought for 
the Gas Connection and Electrical Connection.  
2.4.11 
In addition to seeking development consent in the Order for the Power 
Generation Plant, APL is also seeking powers of compulsory purchase 
powers in respect of acquisition over the Order Land, in order to acquire 
authorise the acquisition of land, the temporary use of land, the creation of 
permanent new rights and to suspend, override and/or extinguish any, for 
example, unknown rights, restrictions, easements or servitudes in order to 
facilitate the construction and operation of the Project. 
2.4.12 
Separately, APL will seek planning permission for the Gas Connection under 
the Town and Country Planning Act 1990 ("TCPA 1990").  The Electrical 
Connection could either be consented through the TCPA 1990 or as permitted 
development under the Town and Country Planning (General Permitted 
Development) Order 1995 ("GPDO").

The PA 2008 DCLG pre-application guidance explains that the PA 2008 sets 
out statutory requirements for applicants to engage in pre-application 
consultation with local communities, local authorities, and those who would 
be directly affected by the project. The front-loaded emphasis of consultation 
in the major infrastructure planning regime is designed to ensure a more 
transparent and efficient examination process. Table 3-1 below outlines 
where in this Consultation Report the advice set out in the Guidance has been 
addressed.

Explanatory 
text 
“Explanatory text should set the scene and provide 
an overview and narrative of the whole pre-
application stage as it relates to the particular 
project. It would assist if a quick reference guide in 
bullet point form, summarising all the consultation 
activity in chronological order, is included near the 
start of the report.  
 
This section should define the whole pre-
application consultation and explain the 
relationship between any initial strategic options 
stage, any subsequent informal consultation that 
may have taken place, and the statutory 
consultation carried out under the 2008 Act…" 
Chapter 1 provides a summary of the 
whole pre-application stage.  Sections 
5.2-5.4, including Tables 5-1 and 5-2 
provide an overview of pre-application 
consultation undertaken on the Project 
in chronological order, including 
reference to informal non-statutory 
consultation and statutory consultation 
carried out under the PA 2008.  
Relevant historical consultation is 
described in sections 4.2-4.4.

Report. If the prescribed consultees have been 
consulted on multiple occasions, perhaps at 
different phases of the consultation, then this 
should be explained. If the applicant’s list of 
prescribed consultees varies in any way from the 
list of organisations set out in schedule 1 of the 
Applications: Prescribed Forms and Procedures 
Regulations 2009 (APFP) then this should be 
robustly justified. The list of organisations set out 
in schedule 1 of the APFP should be followed in 
terms of the order in which the consultees are 
presented. 
 
A short description of how S43 of the Act has been 
applied in order to identify the relevant local 
authorities that should be included. This could be 
supported by a map showing the site and 
identifying the boundaries of the relevant local

consulted under S44 of the Act are identified as a 
distinct element of the wider S42 consultation. S44

clearly indicated and identified separately in the 
report from the statutory consultation.  
This does not necessarily mean that informal

The pre-application consultation process is crucial 
to the effectiveness of the major infrastructure 
consenting regime. A thorough process can give 
the Secretary of State confidence that issues that 
will arise during the six months examination period 
have been identified, considered, and – as far as 
possible – that applicants have sought to reach 
agreement on those issues. Without adequate 
consultation, the subsequent application will not be 
accepted when it is submitted. If the Secretary of

State determines that the consultation is 
inadequate, he or she can recommend that the 
applicant carries out further consultation activity 
before the application can be accepted. 
Para. 21 
Compliance with this guidance alone will not 
guarantee that the Secretary of State will conclude 
that the applicant has complied with the pre-
application consultation requirements introduced 
by the Planning Act. Applicants should satisfy 
themselves that they have complied with all 
statutory requirements and applicable guidance 
(including this guidance) so they can reasonably 
expect that their application will not be rejected on 
the grounds of inadequate consultation. Where an 
applicant has not been able to follow this 
guidance, they should provide comments setting 
out why this is the case, in the consultation report. 
This report seeks to demonstrate that 
APL has complied with the consultation 
requirements of the PA 2008 during 
both Phase 1 and Phase 2 
consultation.

This document is the Consultation 
Report and accompanies the DCO 
Application. 
Para. 24 
The requirements of the Planning Act and associated 
Regulations form the framework for the pre-
application consultation process. The Government 
recognises that major infrastructure projects and the 
communities and environment in which they are 
located will vary considerably. A ‘one-size-fits-all’ 
approach is not, therefore, appropriate. Instead, 
applicants, who are best placed to understand the 
detail of their specific project, and the relevant local 
authorities, who have a unique knowledge of their 
local communities, should as far as possible work 
together to develop plans for consultation. The aim 
should be to ensure that consultation is appropriate 
to the scale and nature of the project and where its 
impacts will be experienced. 
Section 5.3 describes APL’s approach 
to consultation on the Project.

Para. 25 - 26 
Consultation should be thorough, effective and 
proportionate. Some applicants may have their 
own distinct approaches to consultation, perhaps 
drawing on their own or relevant sector 
experience, for example if there are industry 
protocols that can be adapted. Larger, more 
complex applications are likely to need to go 
beyond the statutory minimum timescales laid 
down in the Planning Act to ensure enough time 
for consultees to understand project proposals and 
formulate a response. Many proposals will require 
detailed technical input, especially regarding 
impacts, so sufficient time will need to be allowed 
for this. Consultation should also be sufficiently 
flexible to respond to the needs and requirements 
of consultees, for example where a consultee has 
indicated that they would prefer to be consulted via 
email only, this should be accommodated as far as 
possible. 
The Planning Act requires certain bodies and 
groups of people to be consulted at the pre-
application stage, but allows for flexibility in the 
precise form that consultation may take depending

on local circumstances and the needs of the 
project itself. Sections 42 – 44 of the Planning Act 
and Regulations11 set out details of who should 
be consulted, including local authorities, the 
Marine Management Organisation (where 
appropriate), other statutory bodies, and persons 
having an interest in the land to be developed. 
Section 47 in the Planning Act sets out the 
applicant’s statutory duty to consult local 
communities. In addition, applicants may also wish 
to strengthen their case by seeking the views of 
other people who are not statutory consultees, but 
who may be significantly affected by the project. 
Para. 28 
From time to time a body may cease to exist but, for 
legislative timetabling reasons, may still be listed as 
a statutory consultee. In such situations the 
Secretary of State will not expect strict compliance 
with the statutory requirements. Applicants should 
identify any successor body and consult with them in 
the same manner as they would have with the 
original body. Where there is no obvious successor, 
applicants should seek the advice of the 
Inspectorate, who may be able to identify an

appropriate alternative consultee. Whether or not an 
alternative is identified, the consultation report should 
briefly note any cases where compliance with 
statutory requirements was impossible and the 
reasons why. 
Para. 29 
 Applicants will often need detailed technical input 
from expert bodies to assist with identifying and 
mitigating the social, environmental, design and 
economic impacts of projects, and other important 
matters. 
Technical expert input will often be needed in 
advance of formal compliance with the pre-
application requirements. Early engagement with 
these bodies can help avoid unnecessary delays 
and the costs of having to make changes at later 
stages of the process. It is equally important that 
statutory consultees respond to a request for 
technical input in a timely manner. Applicants are 
therefore advised to discuss and agree a timetable 
with consultees for the provision of such inputs 
 
Pre-application non-statutory 
consultation is described in sections

the makeup of the community and on how 
consultation might best be undertaken. In addition, 
many authorities will already have a register of 
local interest groups, and should be able to readily 
provide applicants with an appropriate list of such 
groups for the purposes of consultation. 
Consultation with local authorities on 
2018 SoCC is described in section 8.4 
and Appendix 9.A. 
Para. 35 
The applicant has a duty under section 47 of the 
Planning Act to prepare a Statement of Community 
Consultation, and then to conduct its consultation 
in line with that statement. Before doing so, the 
applicant must consult on their Statement of 
Community Consultation with each local authority 
in whose area the proposed development is 
situated. This may require consultation with a 
number of different local authorities, particularly for 
long, linear projects. In this situation, the local 
authorities in question should, as far as 
practicable, co-ordinate their responses to the 
applicant. This will ensure that the consultation 
proposals set out in the Statement are coherent, 
effective, and work across local authority 
boundaries. 
The preparation of the 2014 SoCC is 
described in section 6.4 and Appendix 
4.A (Phase 1). The preparation of the 
2018 SoCC is described in section 8.4 
and Appendix 9.A (Phase 2).

Para. 36 
Even where it is intended that a development 
would take place within a single local authority 
area, it is possible that its impacts could be 
significantly wider than just that local authority’s 
area - for example if the development was located 
close to a neighbouring authority. Where an 
applicant decides to consult people living in a 
wider area who could be affected by the project 
(e.g. through visual or environmental impacts, or 
through increased traffic flow), that intention 
should be reflected in the 
Statement of Community Consultation. 
The rationale for the CCZ and OCZ is 
contained within the 2014 SoCC and 
2018 SoCC and described at sections

Community Consultation within 28 days of receipt 
of the request. However, prior to submitting their 
draft Statement of Community Consultation 
applicants may wish to seek to resolve any 
disagreements or clarifications about the public 
consultation design. An applicant is therefore likely 
to need to engage in discussions with local 
authorities over a longer period than the minimum 
requirements set out in the Act. 
Para. 38 
The role of the local authority in such discussions 
should be to provide expertise about the make-up 
of its area, including whether people in the area 
might have particular needs or requirements, 
whether the authority has identified any groups as 
difficult to reach and what techniques might be 
appropriate to overcome barriers to 
communication. The local authority should also 
provide advice on the appropriateness of the 
applicant’s suggested consultation techniques and 
methods. The local authority’s aim in such  
discussions should be to ensure that the people 
affected by the development can take part in a

Topics for consideration at such pre-consultation

appropriate, consultation which goes wider than 
one local authority area); 
- the appropriateness of various consultation

further advice or guidance to either party. 
However, such advice will be without prejudice to 
any later decision on whether to accept or reject 
an application for examination. 
 
Where a local authority raises an issue or concern 
on the Statement of Community Consultation 
which the applicant feels unable to address, the 
applicant is advised to explain in their consultation 
report their course of action to the Secretary of 
State when they submit their application. 
 
Where a local authority decides that it does not 
wish to respond to a consultation request on the 
Statement of Community Consultation, the 
applicant should make reasonable efforts to 
ensure that all affected communities are consulted. 
If the applicant is unsure how to proceed, they are 
encouraged to seek advice from the Inspectorate.  
However, it is for the applicant to satisfy 
consultation in sections: 8.2, 8.4-8.6 
and 9.2-9.4.

themselves that their consultation plan allows for 
as full public involvement as is appropriate for their 
project and, once satisfied, to proceed with the 
consultation. Provided that applicants can satisfy 
themselves that they have made reasonable 
endeavours to consult with all those who might 
have a legitimate interest or might be affected by a 
proposed development, it would be unlikely that 
their application would be rejected on grounds of 
inadequate public consultation.

Local authorities are also themselves statutory 
consultees for any proposed major infrastructure 
project which is in or adjacent to their area. 
Applicants should engage with them as early as 
possible to ensure that the impacts of the 
development on the local area are understood and 
considered prior to the application being submitted 
to the Secretary of State. 
 
Local authorities will be able to provide an 
informed opinion on a wide number of matters,

Development Consent Order. These may include 
the later approval by the local authority (after the 
granting of a Development Consent Order) of 
detailed project designs or schemes to mitigate 
adverse impacts. It will be important that any

The local authority in whose area a proposed 
project is located (or an authority adjoining the 
host authority) will be invited by the Secretary of 
State to submit a local impact report once the 
application has been accepted for examination. 
The local impact report will allow local authorities 
to set out details of their views on the likely effect 
of the development on the local area and 
community. Local authorities are likely to have 
developed a range of sources of useful information 
as part of their Local Plan preparation and more 
generally across their functions and 
responsibilities. Where these sources are up-to-

Applicants will also need to identify and consult 
people who own, occupy or have another interest 
in the land in question, or who could be affected by 
a project in such a way that they may be able to

therefore critical that they are engaged with project 
proposals at an early stage. Because they live, 
work and socialise in the affected area, local 
people are particularly well placed to comment on 
what the impact of proposals on their local 
community might be; or what mitigating measures 
might be appropriate; or what other opportunities 
might exist for meeting the project’s objectives. 
 
In consulting on project proposals, an inclusive 
approach is needed to ensure that different groups 
have the opportunity to participate and are not 
disadvantaged in the process. Applicants should 
use a range of methods and techniques to ensure 
that they access all sections of the community in

proposals (e.g. through visual impacts or 
increased traffic flow). 
 
The Statement of Community Consultation should 
act as a framework for the community consultation 
generally, for example, setting out where details 
and dates of any events will be published. The 
Statement of Community Consultation should be

Regulations, aligning publicity with consultation 
may not always be possible, especially where a 
multi-stage consultation is intended. 
Para. 68 
To realise the benefits of consultation on a project, 
it must take place at a sufficiently early stage to 
allow consultees a real opportunity to influence the 
proposals. At the same time, consultees will need 
sufficient information on a project to be able to 
recognise and understand the impacts. 
Section 5.2 recognises the balance 
between commencing consultation and 
information available.  Early non-
statutory consultation was undertaken 
during Phase 1 consultation and is 
described in sections Error! Reference s
ource not found.6,2, 7.2 and 10.2.   
Para. 69 
Applicants will often also require detailed technical 
advice from consultees and it is likely that their 
input will be of the greatest value if they are 
consulted when project proposals are fluid, 
followed up by confirmation of the approach as 
proposals become firmer. In principle, therefore, 
applicants should undertake initial consultation as 
soon as there is sufficient detail to allow 
consultees to understand the nature of the project 
properly.

enough to enable consultees to comment, 
applicants are encouraged to consider an iterative, 
phased consultation consisting of two (or more) 
stages, especially for large projects with long 
development periods. For example, applicants 
might wish to consider undertaking non-statutory 
early consultation at a stage where options are still 
being considered. This will be helpful in informing 
proposals and assisting the applicant in 
establishing a preferred option on which to 
undertake statutory consultation.

Para. 71 
Where an iterative consultation is intended, it may 
be advisable for applicants to carry out the final 
stage of consultation with persons who have an 
interest in the land once they have worked up their 
project proposals in sufficient detail to identify 
affected land interests. 
Not relevant for this Project – 
landowners have been consulted at 
both Phase 1 and Phase 2. 
Para. 72 
The timing and duration of consultation will be 
likely to vary from project to project, depending on 
size and complexity, and the range and scale of 
the impacts. The Planning Act requires a 
consultation period of a minimum of 28 days from 
the day after receipt of the consultation

documents. It is expected that this may be 
sufficient for projects which are straightforward and 
uncontroversial in nature. But many projects, 
particularly larger or more controversial ones, may 
require longer consultation periods than this. 
Applicants should therefore set consultation 
deadlines that are realistic and proportionate to the 
proposed project. It is also important that 
consultees do not withhold information that might 
affect a project, and that they respond in good time 
to applicants. Where responses are not received 
by the deadline, the applicant is not obliged to take 
those responses into account. 
Paras. 73-75 
Applicants are not expected to repeat consultation 
rounds set out in their Statement of Community 
Consultation unless the project proposals have 
changed very substantially. However, where 
proposals change to such a large degree that what 
is being taken forward is fundamentally different 
from what was consulted on, further consultation 
may well be needed. This may be necessary if, for 
example, new information arises which renders all

reason. When considering the need for additional 
consultation, applicants should use the degree of 
change, the effect on the local community and the 
level of public interest as guiding factors. 
 
Where a proposed application changes to such a 
large degree that the proposals could be 
considered a new application, the legitimacy of the 
consultation already carried out could be 
questioned. In such cases, applicants should 
undertake further re-consultation on the new 
proposals, and should supply consultees with 
sufficient information to enable them to understand 
the nature of the change and any likely significant 
impacts (but not necessarily the full suite of 
consultation documents), and allow at least 28 
days for consultees to respond. 
 
If the application only changes to a small degree, 
or if the change only affects part of the 
development, then it is not necessary for an 
applicant to undertake a full re-consultation. Where 
a proposed application is amended in light of 
informed by Phase 1 consultation 
feedback (as described in chapter 8).

consultation responses then, unless those 
amendments materially change the application or 
materially changes its impacts, the amendments 
themselves should not trigger a need for 
further consultation. Instead, the applicant should 
ensure that all affected statutory consultees and 
local communities are informed of the changes. 
Para. 77 
Consultation should also be fair and reasonable for 
applicants as well as communities. To ensure that 
consultation is fair to all parties, applicants should 
be able to demonstrate that the consultation 
process is proportionate to the impacts of the 
project in the area that it affects, takes account of 
the anticipated level of local interest, and takes 
account of the views of the relevant local 
authorities. 
The approach to consultation and the 
rationale for this approach is set out in 
section 5.2.  An overview of how 
consultation responses have been 
taken into account is included in 
chapter 10. 
Para. 78 
Applicants are required under section 37 of the 
Planning Act to produce a consultation report 
alongside their application, which details how they 
have complied with the consultation requirements 
set out in the Act.

Para. 82 
As with the consultation itself, it is likely that 
different audiences will require different levels of 
information. The local community may be 
particularly interested in what the collective view of 
the community is and how this has been taken into 
account. Consultees with highly technical interests 
may seek more detailed information on what 
impacts and risks have been identified, and how 
they are proposed to be mitigated or managed.

A response to points raised by consultees with 
technical information is likely to need to focus on 
the specific impacts for which the body has 
expertise. The applicant should make a judgement 
as to whether the consultation report provides 
sufficient detail on the relevant impacts, or 
whether a targeted response would be more

Historical Consultation 
4.1 
Introduction 
4.1.1 
This chapter sets out historical consultation undertaken in relation to the 
Order Land and surrounding area by others, in accordance with PINS Advice 
Note fourteen.   
4.1.2 
The Order Land and the surrounding area have been subject to a number of 
recent proposals for energy-related and other development, as well as 
consideration through emerging local planning policy.  APL recognises the 
importance of these proposals in assessing the context of the Order Land and 
understanding the concerns and aspirations of the local community.   
4.2 
Order Land – Planning Application Consultation 
4.2.1 
Abergelli Farm has previously been subject to a series of planning 
applications for mineral extraction, inert landfill and other commercial 
activities.  Each of the previous planning applications has been subject to 
consultation. 
4.2.2 
In February 2003, Swansea City Waste Disposal Company Ltd obtained 
planning permission for ‘excavation and removal of inert material from landfill 
site and restoration’ at Abergelli Farm (CCS Ref: 2002/0312). This consent 
was subsequently extended to allow the excavation and removal of inert 
material until 31st December 2010 (2007/0907).  Neither of the planning 
applications were subject to pre-application consultation, however the 
applications were published for statutory consultation by CCS. 
4.2.3 
In May 2003, planning permission was granted for the change of use of land 
at Abergelli Farm from agricultural use to a horse racing training/facility 
ground (CCS Ref: 2003/0561). Subsequently, CCS granted planning 
permission for the construction of a stable block in August 2004 (CCS Ref: 
2004/0415) and for the construction of two detached dwelling houses to 
provide Horse Trainers and Stable Hands accommodation (CCS Ref: 
2004/0329).  Similarly, none of the above planning applications were subject 
to pre-application consultation, however the applications were published for 
statutory consultation by CCS. 
4.3 
Surrounding Area – Planning Application Consultation 
4.3.1 
The area surrounding the Order Land is predominantly rural but is 
characterised by a substantial amount of utilities infrastructure. 
4.3.2 
In August 2008, National Grid Electricity Transmission PLC gained planning 
permission for the construction of a new 400 kV electricity substation at a site 
approximately 1 km to the south-west of the Project Site, at Heol Llangyfelach 
in Felindre, (CCS Ref: 2007/2733). Subsequently, the proposals were 
modified and planning permission was granted for the amended scheme in

November 2008 (CCS Ref: 2008/1685). In association with the 400 kV 
electricity substation, planning permission was granted for an overhead 
electricity line diversion in April 2008 (CCS Ref: 2007/2827) and the 
construction of an amenity building in July 2010 (CCS Ref: 2010/0539). 
4.3.3 
The Access Statement, submitted with the planning application (CCS Ref: 
2008/1685) set out details of pre-application consultation undertaken in 
regards to the proposed 400 kV electricity substation, as provided in Figure

Abergelli Glas Ltd obtained planning permission for a 10 MW solar farm at 
land at Abergelli Farm, adjacent to the north-east of the Project Site, in May 
2013 (CCS Ref: 2013/0135).  The Planning and Design & Access Statement,

Involvement 
NGET has worked closely with statutory consultees and the local 
community regarding this scheme (including revisions), providing 
a comprehensive consultation process for those potentially 
affected. 
From a local residents’ perspective, the foreseen difficulties 
identified from an environmental point of view are: 
 Increase in traffic movements; 
 Proximity; and 
 Noise 
The project team arranged a series of meetings with political 
members before and during June 2007.  Subsequent meetings 
and consultation then took place with the local landowners and 
residents. 
A public exhibition was held at Felindre Welfare Hall on 
Wednesday 11 July 2007, inviting the local residents and elected 
representatives to view plans, gain background information and 
meet members of the project team.  The exhibition was advertised 
locally and letters were sent to local residents in Pant Iasua, 
Felindre and those on the periphery of Llangelyfach.  
Approximately 25 – 30 people attended. 
Additionally, in September 2007, immediate residents to the site 
were invited on a site visit to a similar substation to experience 
this type of development first hand and have any concerns 
addressed. 
As an ongoing commitment, NGET has continued to keep local 
residents informed of the revisions, consents and planning 
process.  The residents have been provided with a project 
Freephone telephone number to contact the community relations 
team, should they have any questions during the process. 
The outcome from this consultation with the local community has 
been positive and no objections from the local residents are 
anticipated.

2013/0865), set out details of consultation undertaken prior to the submission 
of the application, as provided in Figure 4-3. 
5.2 
Involvement 
5.2.1 In seeking a Screening Opinion from Swansea Council, PB also 
received some advice on what the planning application should 
include and what the most important issues are to be considered. 
5.2.2 RD Wales has discussed the proposal extensively with the 
landowner in identifying the area of land most suitable for 
development within the farm boundary and where it would least 
affect the existing business. 
5.2.3 Public consultation has not been undertaken, as the effect of the 
proposed development on local residents will be minimal. 
5.2.4 PB has consulted the Environment Agency Wales (EA) to confirm 
that an FCA was needed and also the most appropriate form of 
SuDS for the site.

Planning Policy Consultation 
4.4.1 
CCS is currently in the process of preparing a new Local Development Plan 
(LDP) and proposals map, which upon adoption will replace the Unitary 
Development Plan (UDP) as the key planning policy document for CCS up to 
2025. 
4.4.2 
The preparation of the LDP has been subject to numerous phases of 
consultation and engagement since 2009: 
 Delivery Agreement (DA) – The DA set out the timetable for 
preparation of the LDP and the Council’s Community Involvement 
Scheme.  The DA was subject to consultation in April and May 2009 
and was updated in 2013. 
 Pre-Deposit Plan Preparation and Involvement – This stage included 
the preparation and collection of background evidence, and an 
invitation for the submission of candidate sites for assessment from 
2010.  A Draft LDP Vision and Objectives document and a Draft LDP 
Strategic Options document were subsequently subject to consultation 
1.5 Consultations 
As discussed in Section 1.4 a screening exercise was undertaken for the 
project with City and County of Swansea Council to determine the need or 
otherwise for a full Environmental Impact Assessment for the project.  The 
Council advised that a full EIA was not required.  Nevertheless, to ensure 
that an appropriate level of environmental assessment work was 
undertaken Wessex Solar Energy and their project team have maintained 
a dialogue throughout the preparation of their planning application with 
various parties to ensure a robust planning application has been prepared. 
1.5.1 Public Consultation 
Communication with the local community and other stakeholders is seen 
by Wessex Solar Energy as an important part of the development process. 
The nature of the development is such that it will have relatively localised 
impacts when compared to a project such as a wind farm which can be 
seen over many miles.  Wessex Solar Energy therefore informed the 
relevant community council (Mawr Community Council) in early March 
2013 with follow up correspondence towards the end of March 2013.  At 
the time of writing this application Wessex Solar Energy has not received 
any correspondence from Mawr Community Council. 
Wessex Solar Energy’s consultations will be on-going throughout the 
development stages of the project.

in 2012.  Following this, the Draft LDP Preferred Strategy was subject 
to public consultation (via exhibitions, community information 
sessions, presentations and workshops) in 2013, prior to the 
publication of the final LDP Preferred Strategy in July 2014. 
 Proposals Maps Consultation – The proposals maps define the precise 
boundaries of proposed development, including key strategic sites 
identified in the LDP Preferred Strategy. The LDP draft proposals 
maps were subject to consultation from 4th December 2014 to 16th 
January 2015.  The draft proposals maps illustrate the proposed 
boundaries of strategic development sites at: ‘land northwest of M4 
Junction 46, Llangyfelach’ for mixed commercial / employment / 
residential uses; and ‘land south of A4240, Penllergaer’ for residential-
led development. 
 Deposit LDP Consultation – The full Deposit LDP was published for 
consultation between July and August 2016.  The consultation 
provided opportunity to comment on a full schedule of policies and 
guidance relating to future development in CCS, including in relation 
to the provision of new homes, jobs, infrastructure and community 
facilities. 
4.4.3 
Notably, the Deposit LDP set out proposals for a new sustainable settlement 
at land north of Junction 46 of the M4 (located in close proximity to the south-
west of the Project Site), to include over 1000 new homes, community 
facilities, leisure opportunities and integrated green infrastructure.  The 
document also set out plans for a major extension to Penllergaer 
(approximately 4km to the south-west of the site) to deliver an additional 1000 
dwellings, a new primary school, local community facilities end extensive 
recreational space.  
4.4.4 
CCS submitted the Deposit LDP, updated following 2016 consultation, for 
independent examination in July 2017.  Examination hearings subsequently 
commenced in February 2018.  It is anticipated that the LDP will be adopted 
later in 2018.

Overview of Consultation 
5.1 
Introduction 
5.1.1 
This chapter explains APL’s approach to its consultation activities, and 
describes the non-statutory and statutory consultation that APL has 
undertaken.   
5.2 
APL’s Consultation Process 
5.2.1 
At the outset of the Project, APL recognised that the planning regime 
established by the PA 2008 places significant importance on pre-application 
consultation.  Accordingly, APL has invested considerable time and 
resources during the pre-application phase of the Project in order to 
encourage meaningful involvement in the process by the local community, 
those interested in the Project Site, local authorities and other prescribed 
consultees.  
5.2.2 
APL has undertaken pre-application consultation on the Project in two 
phases, which reflects the Project development timeline.  
5.2.3 
The Project was initially developed and taken through the first phase of 
consultation by APL under the ownership of Watt Power in 2014/2015.  APL 
undertook Phase 1 consultation on the Project between January 2014 and 
March 2015 (Stages 1-40, Table 5-2). 
5.2.4 
In March 2015, it was decided by Watt Power (the previous owners of the 
Project) to put it “on hold” primarily because of the then market conditions for 
new power generation in the UK.  However, after acquisition of APL by Drax 
in December 2016, the Project was publicly “re-launched” in April 2017. 
5.2.5 
Following this, and in accordance with the PA 2008 DCLG pre-application 
guidance (paragraph 73), APL decided to undertake a second phase of 
consultation in 2017/2018 (Stages 41-73, Table 5-2). The feedback received 
from the Phase 1 consultation informed a number of changes to the Project. 
The Phase 2 consultation provided the opportunity for APL to inform those 
who were not involved with Phase 1 consultation about the Project and to 
update consultees on the changes to the Project and for all consultees to 
comment on the revised proposals.  
5.2.6 
Consequently, the Project has developed in a consultative and iterative 
manner, during successive stages of development as shown in Table 5-2 and 
described in Chapter 11.   
Consultation Strands 
5.2.7 
Figure 5-1 illustrates the strands of consultation that have been undertaken 
during both Phase 1 consultation and Phase 2 consultation, as required under 
the terms of the PA 2008 and EIA Regulations.  
Consultation Report 
Abergelli Power Project 
 
 
72 
 
5.2.8 
These definitions are used throughout this Consultation Report to identify how 
the consultation activities relate to the statutory requirements under the PA 
2008 and EIA Regulations. 
5.2.9 
For clarity, APL took the approach of conducting two streamlined statutory 
consultation periods, incorporating the requirements of s42, s47 and s48 of 
the PA 2008 during both the Phase 1 consultation and Phase 2 consultation. 
5.2.10 
APL undertook non-statutory consultation both leading up to and following on 
from the Phase 1 and Phase 2 statutory consultation periods. In accordance 
with PINS Advice Note 14 (page 4), APL has clearly indicated and identified 
separately within this Consultation Report non-statutory from statutory 
consultation undertaken. In practice, APL has afforded equal weight to 
feedback received from statutory and non-statutory consultation activities. 
This approach is reflected throughout this Consultation Report. 
Figure 5-1 The strands of consultation 
 
5.2.11 
This Consultation Report references the key stages that have occurred during 
the development of the Project and explains how these relate to the various 
strands of consultation, and importantly, the outputs of consultation. 
Consultation Timetable 
5.2.12

chronological order, the corresponding consultation strands and relevant

APL’s Approach to Consultation 
5.3.1 
Consultation is an integral part of the Project.  The views of local residents, 
businesses and other local interest groups have helped to inform the 
development of the Project and to shape the final Application. 
5.3.2 
In developing its approach to consultation and delivering the associated 
activities, APL has taken account of the legislative requirements and 
accompanying guidance (as demonstrated in the Compliance Checklist 
(Appendix 1.A of the Consultation Report)).  In doing so, APL has sought to 
ensure that its approach to consultation is ‘thorough, effective and 
proportionate,’ such that it is ‘proportionate to the impacts of the project in the 
area that it affects’ (DCLG, The Planning Act 2008: Guidance on the pre-
application process, 2015, paragraphs 25 and 77).  
5.3.3 
The pre-application consultation phase of the Project encouraged a range of 
people to express their views on the emerging proposals through non-
statutory consultation or one of the strands of statutory consultation, as set 
out in Figure 5-1.  APL considered and had regard to the feedback of 
consultees throughout the pre-application phase in considering the evolving 
design of the Project and in decision-making at key project milestones (Table 
5-2). 
Phase 1 Consultation (January 2014 – March 2015) 
5.3.4 
During the Phase 1 consultation, APL chose to engage with the local 
community and stakeholders during an early phase of non-statutory 
consultation (Stages 1-6, 9 and 12, Table 5-2), several months in advance of 
the commencement of the statutory consultation phase (Stage 22, Table 5-2) 
and at a point where the Project was significantly less developed. 
Representatives at the national, regional and local levels – including 
community council councillors, CCS officers and councillors, Assembly 
Members and civil servants – were contacted by APL and exhibitions were 
held for the benefit of the local community in June 2014 (Stage 6, Table 5-2). 
During this non-statutory phase of consultation, APL explained the rationale 
and key objectives of the Project, gave reasons why the Power Generation 
Plant Site had been chosen and presented opportunities for feedback on the 
initial, emerging project concepts. 
5.3.5 
As acknowledged by the PA 2008 DCLG pre-application guidance, there is 
an inherent tension between consulting early and providing sufficient 
information to enable consultees to comment. APL sought to balance this by 
providing clear descriptions of options under consideration and explaining the 
on-going nature of the design development and consultation processes. 
5.3.6 
Drawing on the early feedback on the proposals, APL was able to consider 
the consultation responses alongside the design development and EIA 
processes.  APL’s decision to engage early was subsequently validated as 
this phase of non-statutory consultation would shape the development of the 
Project, as demonstrated in chapters 7 and 10 of this report.

5.3.7 
APL proposed in the draft 2014 SoCC (Appendix 4.A.II) to conduct a single 
phase of statutory consultation, with the same time period and deadlines for 
S42 consultation and S48 publicity. This approach was compatible with the 
advice set out within PINS Advice note sixteen1, which highlights that it is 
helpful for S48 deadlines for receipt of views on the application to be as close 
as possible to deadlines given under S42 consultation.  APL also sought to 
maximise the opportunities for consultees to comment on the Project by 
exceeding the minimum statutory timescales of 28 days.  This approach was 
considered straightforward, accessible and appropriate to the scale of the 
Project. The draft 2014 SoCC (Appendix 4.A.II) was developed in consultation 
with CCS (Stage 10, Table 5-2) and the final version published on 30th 
September 2014 (Stage 15, Table 5-2).  
5.3.8 
During Phase 1 statutory consultation, APL was able to demonstrate the 
iterative process of project evolution and design development.  
Phase 2 Consultation (April 2017 – May 2018) 
5.3.9 
APL decided to undertake a second phase of consultation after the project 
resumed in early 2017 in accordance with the PA 2008 DCLG pre-application 
guidance (paragraph 73). This second phase of consultation included a 
number of changes to the Project informed by feedback received from the 
Phase 1 consultation.  The Phase 2 consultation provided the opportunity for 
APL to inform those who were not involved with Phase 1 consultation about 
the Project, to update consultees on the changes to the Project and for all 
consultees to comment on the revised proposals for the Project.  
5.3.10 
During the Phase 2 consultation, APL chose again to undertake early informal 
non-statutory consultation to inform the local community, political 
representatives and other key stakeholders about the DCO application 
process for the Project resuming (under the new ownership of APL by Drax) 
and changes made to the Project since the end of the Phase 1 statutory 
consultation (Stages 41-50, Table 5-2).  
5.3.11 
APL produced a draft 2018 SoCC (Appendix 9.A) for the Phase 2 consultation 
which set out how the 2018 PEIR produced for the Project would be 
publicised and consulted upon. APL proposed to conduct a  further Phase 2 
statutory consultation period with aligned deadlines for s42 and s48 publicity 
reflecting the guidance set out in PINS Advice Note 14.  Again, APL sought 
to maximise the opportunities for consultees to comment on the Project by 
exceeding the minimum statutory timescales of 28 days. In this respect, APL’s 
approach to the consultation is considered to be straightforward and 
accessible.  
                                                      
1 PINS Advice note sixteen was applicable at the time of preparing the draft 2014 SoCC (July 2014) but was 
subsequently retired in July 2015, following publication of Planning Act 2008: guidance on the pre application 
process (DCLG, March 2015)

Abergelli Power Project

5.3.12 
The draft 2018 SoCC (Appendix 9.A) was developed in consultation with CCS 
(Stages 47 and 48, Table 5-2). The final version of the 2018 SoCC (Appendix 
9.B) was published on 2nd January 2018 (Stage 51, Table 5-2).  
Project Consultation Milestones 
5.3.13 
Table 5-2 presents a summary of consultation milestones detailing how the 
Project has evolved from the site selection process to the preparation of the 
Application, and the key project design decisions taken at each stage. 
5.3.14 
Chapters 7 and 9 of this Consultation Report, report feedback received during 
Phase 1 and Phase 2 consultation, respectively. Chapter 10 explains how 
feedback generated during both Phase 1 consultation and Phase 2 
consultation influenced the development of the Project.  
5.4 
Summary  
5.4.1 
The phased approach to consultation undertaken by APL is considered to be 
appropriate to the scale and timeline of the Project. APL maintained an 
internal communications logging system to record incoming and outgoing 
consultation for both statutory and non-statutory consultation. 
5.4.2 
Chapters 6 and 8 describe the consultation activities undertaken by APL for 
the various strands of consultation during Phase 1 and Phase 2 of the pre-
application consultation.

Description of Phase 1 Consultation Activities 
6.1 
Introduction 
6.1.1 
This chapter describes the non-statutory and statutory consultation activities 
that APL undertook as part of the Phase 1 consultation. 
6.2 
Phase 1 Non-Statutory Consultation (January 2014 – October 2014) 
(prior to Phase 1 Statutory Consultation) 
6.2.1 
At the outset of the pre-application consultation phase of the Project, APL 
engaged in a series of non-statutory consultation activities with CCS, PINS, 
locally elected representatives, interested parties and the local community. 
6.2.2 
Initial Phase 1 non-statutory consultation prior to the statutory consultation 
phase comprised a number of briefing meetings and discussions with PINS, 
officers and councillors at CCS, local Community Councils and other 
interested parties (Stages 1-4, 9 and 12, Table 5-2); and initial consultation 
with the local community on 19th – 21st June 2014 at a series of three public 
exhibitions (Stage 6, Table 5-2). 
6.2.3 
This period of consultation occurred several months in advance of the 
commencement of the Phase 1 statutory consultation (Stage 22, Table 5-2) 
and at a point when the Project was significantly less developed.  The 
approach towards undertaking Phase 1 consultation was time-sensitive 
dependent upon the conditions at that time.  Accordingly, this phase of 
consultation enabled APL to explain the rationale and key objectives of the 
Project and to present opportunities for feedback on the initial emerging 
concepts of the Project. 
Initial Phase 1 Non-Statutory Consultation with CCS, PINS, Locally 
Elected Representatives and Interested Parties 
6.2.4 
APL sought to inform and consult about the Project from an early stage.  Initial 
non-statutory consultation with CCS, PINS, locally elected representatives 
and interested parties commenced in early 2014 and comprised a series of 
briefing meetings and discussions (Stage 1-4, 9 and 12, Table 5-2) up to the 
commencement of Phase 1 statutory consultation in October 2014. 
6.2.5 
Table 6-1 provides a list of the stakeholders consulted and the dates and 
details of meetings held and other correspondence.  A summary of feedback 
received from non-statutory consultation with stakeholders is provided in 
section 7.2.  The minutes of the meetings held are contained within Appendix 
2.D.

Project Description for Phase 1 Non-Statutory Consultation with the 
Local Community 
6.2.6 
The Project description at the commencement of Phase 1 non-statutory 
consultation with the local community (Stage 6, Table 5-2) was the same as 
that set out within APL’s EIA Scoping Report (Appendix 3.A.II), which was 
submitted to the SoS in June 2014 (Stage 7, Table 5-2).   
6.2.7 
A number of options were under consideration at this time, including: 
 Two possible access routes: 
o Option 1: from the north via Rhyd-y-pandy Road and the 
existing access road west of Brynheulog past Abergelli Farm, 
which would need to be extended to the Generating Equipment 
Site; or 
o Option 2: from the west via the B4489, along the access road 
to National Grid’s two 400kV electrical substations and Felindre 
Gas Compressor Station and then along a purpose-built access 
road to be constructed across undeveloped land to the 
Generating Equipment Site.  
 Two possible options for connecting the Generating Equipment to a 
suitable source of fuel gas: 
Consultation Report 
Abergelli Power Project 
 
 
106 
 
o Feeder 28 of the National Transmission System; or 
o Nearby LTS HP Pipeline. 
 Four possible options for the Gas Connection Route Corridor (within 
an identified Gas Connection Opportunity Area): 
o Option 1: approximately 1.7 km in length including no major 
road crossings, four minor road crossings, no major water 
crossings and two minor water crossings; or 
o Option 2: approximately 1.2 km in length including no major 
road crossings, one minor road crossings, no major water 
crossings and one minor water crossing; or 
o Option 3: approximately 1.4 km in length including no major 
road crossings, one minor road crossing, no major water 
crossings and three minor water crossings; or 
o Option 4: approximately 0.4 km in length including no major 
road crossings, no minor road crossings, no major water 
crossings and one minor water crossing. 
 Two possible Electrical Connection options to export power from the 
Generating Equipment to the NETS: 
o Underground cable; or 
o Overhead line 
 Options for the Electrical Connection route corridor within an identified 
Electrical Connection Opportunity Area to the south-west of the 
Generating Equipment Site; 
 Up to 5 Gas Turbine Generator with up to 5 stacks; 
 Stacks up to 60 m (height) and up to 10 m (diameter) and 
 Indicative layout of the Power Generation Plant Site. 
6.2.8 
As outlined within the EIA Scoping Report (Appendix 3.A.II) and chapter 5 of 
the ES (Document Reference 6.1), the following technology options were 
originally considered for the Power Generation Plant: OCGT plant; CCGT 
plant; and RGE plant.  Based on environmental, technical and feasibility 
considerations, including visual impact, water resources, noise and available 
space, financial, and start-up times, OCGT is considered to be the most 
suitable technology choice for generating up to 299 MWe as a peaking plant 
at the Project Site.  OCGT was therefore presented as the preferred 
technology choice for the Project during Phase 1 non-statutory consultation. 
Consultation Report 
Abergelli Power Project 
 
 
107 
 
6.2.9 
The potential for using CHP opportunities with these technologies was also 
originally considered, as explained within the EIA Scoping Report (Appendix 
3.A.II) and CHP Technical Note (Document Reference 6.2, Appendix 5.1).  
However, it is not considered technically or economically feasible with SCGT 
peaking power station because the profile for the generation of electrical 
energy from the station cannot be guaranteed to coincide with the required 
heat demand profile of any potential customer.  As such, CHP was not 
included as part of the Project during Phase 1 non-statutory consultation. 
Phase 1 Non-Statutory Consultation with the Local Community 
6.2.10 
APL undertook initial Phase 1 non-statutory consultation with the local 
community in June 2014 (Stage 6, Table 5-2).   
6.2.11 
This period of consultation occurred several months in advance of the 
commencement of the Phase 1 statutory consultation and at a point when the 
Project was significantly less developed.  Accordingly, this phase of 
consultation enabled APL to explain the rationale and key objectives of the 
Project and to present opportunities for feedback on the initial emerging 
concepts of the Project. 
Public Exhibitions 
6.2.12 
Phase 1 non-statutory consultation with the local community comprised three 
public exhibitions in Clydach, Felindre and Tircoed on 19th – 21st June 2014 
(Stage 2, Table 5-2).   
6.2.13 
APL chose three separate exhibition venues at convenient locations within 
close proximity of the Project Site in order to give local people the maximum 
opportunity to attend.  Each exhibition venue met Disability Discrimination Act 
1995 requirements and, upon a reasonable and timely request, had 
provisions in place for those with special requirements seeking to attend the 
exhibition. 
6.2.14 
Table 6-2 sets out the dates, locations and times of the public exhibitions held 
in June 2014 (Stage 2, Table 5-2):

6.2.15 
The public exhibitions presented relevant information about the Project in a 
variety of formats, including display panels (Appendices 2.B.I and 2.B.II) and 
leaflets (Appendices 2.B.III and 2.B.IV) in both English and Welsh.  APL 
considered the provision of written materials in different formats (for example, 
large print or braille) upon request. 
6.2.16 
APL provided a leaflet (in English and Welsh) (Appendices 2.B.III and 2B.IV) 
which was available to take away, outlining: 
 The proposal for an up to 299MW gas fired power station on land at 
Abergelli Farm; 
 Who the applicant is; 
 The need for gas power generation to deliver national energy security 
and flexibility, providing a back-up for renewable energy technologies; 
 Why the land had been identified as a suitable Project Site; 
 The possible community benefits of the scheme, such as construction 
and operation job creation; 
 The preparation of an Environmental Scoping Report and the intention 
for the application to be accompanied by an Environmental Impact 
Assessment (EIA), as well as the possible range of issues it will 
consider; 
 Indicative timeline of activities from pre-application, examination and 
decision, and finance, construction and operation; 
 The planning and consultation process for the Project; and 
 Website details (www.abergellipower.co.uk). 
6.2.17 
Members of the APL project team attended the exhibitions and were available 
to receive feedback from attendees and to discuss and answer questions 
regarding the Project.   
6.2.18 
A feedback form (in English and Welsh) (Appendices 2.B.V and 2.B.VI) was 
also available for attendees to complete at the exhibition or to return via 
Freepost to APL.  The feedback form (Appendices 2.B.V and 2.B.VI) 
requested responses in respect of the following: 
 Age bracket; 
 Gender; 
 How did you travel here today? 
 Which exhibition did you attend?

Advertising and Publicity 
6.2.19 
The public exhibitions were advertised to the local community and local 
representatives via a number of different means (Stage 5, Table 5-2) prior to 
the first exhibition at Clydach on Thursday 19th June. 
6.2.20 
On 9th June 2014, a letter (in English and Welsh) was sent by APL to local 
representatives (comprising the leader of CCS, local MPs, local AMs, local 
councillors, Cabinet Members and Community Council clerks) (Appendices 
2.A.I and 2.A.II) to provide information about the Project and to include an 
invitation to the non-statutory public exhibitions at Clydach, Felindre and 
Tircoed (Stage 5, Table 5-2).  Local representatives were invited to attend the 
exhibitions prior to their opening to the general public or as would be 
convenient.  A total of 25 letters (Appendices 2.A.I and 2.A.II) were sent to: 
the Leader of CCS; the Cabinet Member for Regeneration; Mawr 
Development Trust; local councillors for Mawr, Llangyfelach, Morriston, 
Clydach, Penllergaer; Community Council Clerks for Mawr, Llangyfelach,

Clydach, Potiliw & Tircoed; the local MP and constituency AM for Gower; the 
local MP and constituency AM for Swansea AM; and the constituency AMs 
for South Wales Central.  A list of the local representatives to whom a letter 
was sent is contained within Appendix 2.A.III.  
6.2.21 
On 10th June 2014, a leaflet (in English and Welsh) of introduction about the 
Project and invitation to attend the public exhibitions (Appendices 2.A.IV and 
2.A.V) was sent to approximately 5,500 households and businesses in the 
immediate vicinity of the Project Site (Stage 5, Table 5-2).  A map of the area 
in the vicinity of the Project Site in which letters were sent is contained within 
Appendix 2.A.VI.  The leaflet was distributed by Royal Mail.   
6.2.22 
At the same time, APL launched a Project website to coincide with the 
introduction of the Project to the local community.  The website 
(www.abergellipower.co.uk) provides the latest technical and environmental 
information on the Project, in both English and Welsh.  The website also 
provides contact details to enable people to ask questions and provide 
feedback to APL about the Project. 
6.2.23 
APL issued a press release (Appendix 2.A.X) on 11th June 2014 (Stage 5, 
Table 5-2) to Media Wales, the BBC, South Wales Evening Post, Swansea 
Sound, ITV, and Wales Business Insider in order to announce and introduce 
the Project and publicise the public exhibitions.  APL also placed a separate 
advert (in English and Welsh) in the South Wales Evening Post newspaper 
(Appendix 2.A.XI), published on 12th June 2014 (Stage 5, Table 5-2), giving 
prior notice of the exhibitions.  In addition, APL issued news releases on its 
website (www.abergellipower.co.uk) in advance of the exhibition. 
6.2.24 
On 13th June 2014, letters enclosing posters (in English and Welsh) 
advertising the consultation events (Appendix 2.A.VII and Appendix 2.A.IX) 
were also sent out by APL prior to the exhibitions to community venues within 
the administrative area of CCS and in close proximity of the Project Site, for 
example local shops, post offices and doctors’ surgeries (Stage 5, Table 5-
2).  The letter (Appendix 2.A.VII) requested that the poster (Appendix 2.A.IX) 
was displayed at the community venues in order to publicise the public 
exhibitions.  A list of the locations that were sent a letter and poster by APL 
is contained within Appendix 2.A.VIII. 
6.2.25

an ultra modern and clean facility and a very significant investment in the local 
economy’.  
6.2.28 
Local media announced the Project on the 11th June 2014.  Wales Online 
reported the Project proposals in an article titled, “Revealed: Plans for new 
gas-fired power station in Swansea area” (Appendix 2.C.V). The article 
quoted APL’s Project Director explaining that the power station is a significant 
investment, which will cause minimum disturbance in the local area and the 
extensive consultation process to be undertaken. Insider News Wales also 
published an online article on 12th June 2014 providing a neutral overview of 
what the Project would comprise (Appendix 2.C.IV). Similarly on 11th June 
2014 an article was published in the South West Evening Post online 
(Appendix 2.C.III).  This article reported on the projected cost of the Project 
(at £200 million), the estimated job creation during both construction phases 
and operational phases and the upcoming consultation activity that was 
planned. On Thursday 12th June 2014 an article was published in the Western 
Mail (Appendix 2.C.I), providing details of the Project and detailing other 
similar projects currently being undertaken by Watt Power at Hirwaun in 
Rhondda Cynon Taf and at Eye Airfield in Suffolk.

EIA Scoping Consultation 
6.3.1 
In parallel to the Phase 1 non-statutory consultation, EIA Scoping consultation 
was undertaken with statutory consultees during Phase 1 consultation.  EIA 
Consultation Report 
Abergelli Power Project

Scoping consultation formed part of the statutory  consultation required under 
the EIA Regulations. 
6.3.2 
During this consultation, a series of option appraisals and environmental and 
engineering studies were undertaken in order to inform the design of the 
proposals 
and 
the 
technical 
and 
environmental 
issues 
requiring 
consideration.  The option appraisals and environmental and engineering 
studies informed APL’s EIA Scoping Report (Appendix 3.A.II) which was 
submitted to the SoS on 25th June 2014 (Stage 7, Table 5-2).  The SoS 
subsequently responded with an EIA Scoping Opinion (Appendix 3.B.II) on 
1st August 2014 (Stage 11, Table 5-2).  This is an optional stage of 
consultation under the EIA Regulations. 
Project Description for EIA Scoping Report 
6.3.3 
The Project description included within the EIA Scoping Report (Appendix 
3.A.II) is set out below.   
6.3.4 
A number of options were under consideration at this time, including: 
 Two possible access routes: 
o Option 1: from the north via Rhyd-y-pandy Road and the 
existing access road west of Brynheulog past Abergelli Farm, 
which would need to be extended to the Generating Equipment 
Site; or 
o Option 2: from the west via the B4489,along the access road to 
National Grid’s two 400kV electrical substations and Felindre 
Gas Compressor Station and then along a purpose built access 
road to be constructed across undeveloped land to the 
Generating Equipment Site.  
 Two possible options for connecting the Generating Equipment to a 
suitable source of fuel gas: 
o Feeder 28 of the National Transmission System; or 
o Nearby LTS HP Pipeline. 
 Four possible options for the Gas Connection Route Corridor (within 
an identified Gas Connection Opportunity Area): 
o Option 1: approximately 1.7 km in length including no major 
road crossings, four minor road crossings, no major water 
crossings and two minor water crossings; or 
o Option 2: approximately 1.2 km in length including no major 
road crossings, one minor road crossings, no major water 
crossings and one minor water crossing; or

o Option 3: approximately 1.4 km in length including no major 
road crossings, one minor road crossing, no major water 
crossings and three minor water crossings; or 
o Option 4: approximately 0.4 km in length including no major 
road crossings, no minor road crossings, no major water 
crossings and one minor water crossing. 
 Two possible Electrical Connection options to export power from the 
Generating Equipment to the NETS: 
o Underground cable; or 
o Overhead line; 
 Options for the Electrical Connection route corridor within an identified 
Electrical Connection Opportunity Area to the south-west of the 
Generating Equipment Site; 
 Up to 5 Gas Generator Turbines with up to 5 stacks; and 
 Stacks up to 60 m (height) and up to 10 m (diameter). 
6.3.5 
As outlined within the EIA Scoping Report (Appendix 3.A.II) and chapter 5 of 
the ES (Document Reference 6.1), the following technology options were 
originally considered for the up to 299MW Power Generation Plant: SCGT 
plant; CCGT plant; and RGE plant.  SCGT is considered to be the most 
suitable technology choice for generating up to 299 MWe as a peaking plant 
at the Project Site based on the following environmental, technical and 
feasibility considerations – visual impact, water resources, noise and 
available space, financial, and start-up times. 
6.3.6 
The potential for using CHP opportunities with these technologies was also 
considered, as explained within the EIA Scoping Report (Appendix 3.A.II) and 
CHP Technical Note (Document Reference 6.2, Appendix 5.1).  However, it 
is not considered technically or economically feasible with SCGT peaking 
power station because the profile for the generation of electrical energy from 
the station cannot be guaranteed to coincide with the required heat demand 
profile of any potential customer. 
APL EIA Scoping Report 
6.3.7 
APL prepared an EIA Scoping Report (Appendix 3.A.II) in order to request an 
EIA Scoping Opinion from the SoS on the required content of the EIA. 
6.3.8 
The EIA Scoping Report (Appendix 3.A.II) provided an introduction to the 
Project, including a description of the Project at the time, the needs and 
benefits of the Project, an introduction to APL, the consenting regime and the 
EIA process.

6.3.10 
The report (Appendix 3.A.II) also established the intention to assess the 
construction, operational and decommissioning phases of the Project. 
6.3.11 
The EIA Scoping Report (Appendix 3.A.II), with an accompanying covering 
letter (Appendix 3.A.I), was submitted to the SoS on 25th June 2014 (Stage 
7, Table 5-2) with a request for an EIA Scoping Opinion, under Regulation 8 
of the EIA Regulations, on the possible significant environmental effects of all 
elements of the Project, the proposed methodologies to assess the impacts, 
and the proposed structure of the ES (Document Reference 6.1).  The SoS 
confirmed receipted of APL’s request for an EIA Scoping Opinion on 26th June 
2014 (Appendix 3.A.III). 
Regulation 6 Notification 
6.3.12 
Under Regulation 6(1)(b) of the EIA Regulations, an applicant is required to, 
inter alia, notify the SoS of its intention to submit an ES.   
6.3.13 
In accordance with Regulation 6(1)(b) of the EIA Regulations, at the same 
time as the submission of the EIA Scoping Report (Appendix 3.A.II) to the 
SoS (Stage 7, Table 5-2), the accompanying covering letter (Appendix 3.A.I) 
included formal notification to the SoS that APL proposes to provide an ES 
(Document Reference 6.1) as part of its DCO Application (Stage 8, Table 5-

EIA Scoping Opinion 
6.3.14 
An EIA Scoping Opinion (Appendix 3.B.II), with an accompanying cover email 
(Appendix 3.B.I) was issued by the SoS on 1st August 2014 (Stage 11, Table 
5-2).  
6.3.15 
The Scoping Opinion (Appendix 3.B.II) included a list of all prescribed 
consultation bodies notified by the SoS (Appendix 3.B.III), as required by 
Regulation 9 of the EIA Regulations, and PINS’s comments on the proposed 
development and the EIA approach and topic areas, including its confirmation 
of topics unlikely to have significant environmental effects which could be 
excluded from the Project EIA.  The list of prescribed consultation bodies 
formally consulted by PINS (Appendix 3.B.III), as required by Regulation 9 of 
the EIA Regulations, included Schedule 1 consultees, relevant statutory 
undertakers, local authorities and non-prescribed consultation bodies. 
6.3.16 
The Scoping Opinion (Appendix 3.B.II), summarised in section 6.3, has been 
considered in undertaking the EIA and in the production of the 2014 and 2018 
PEIR (during both Phase 1 and Phase 2 consultation).   
6.4 
Phase 1 Statutory Consultation (October 2014 – November 2014) 
6.4.1 
Following the period of Phase 1 non-statutory consultation (Stages 1-6, 9 and 
12, Table 5-2), APL engaged in a series of subsequent consultation activities 
to satisfy the statutory requirements of the PA 2008 and to further progress 
the development of the Project.  A compliance checklist (Appendix 1.A) sets 
out how the Phase 1 statutory consultation activities undertaken meet the 
requirements of PA 2008. 
6.4.2 
The Phase 1 statutory consultation consisted of: 
 S47 consultation on the draft 2014 SoCC (Appendix 4.A.II) (Stage 10, 
Table 5-2); 
 S47 consultation with the local community (Stage 22, Table 5-2); 
 S48 publicity (including notification under Regulations 11 of the EIA 
Regulations) (Stages 18 and 22, Table 5-2); 
 S46 notification (Stage 19, Table 5-2); 
 S42 consultation (Stage 22, Table 5-2); 
 Additional S42 Consultation (Stage 32, Table 5-2).

Project Description for Phase 1 Statutory Consultation 
6.4.3 
In accordance with PINS Advice note seven2, the Project description during 
Phase 1 statutory consultation was the same as that set out in the 2014 PEIR.   
6.4.4 
Several options were under consideration at this time, including: 
 Two possible access routes: 
o Option 1: from the north via Rhyd-y-pandy Road and the 
existing access road west of Brynheulog past Abergelli Farm, 
which would need to be extended to the Generating Equipment 
Site; or 
o Option 2: from the west via the B4489,along the access road to 
National Grid’s two 400kV electrical substations and Felindre 
Gas Compressor Station and then along a purpose built access 
road to be constructed across undeveloped land to the 
Generating Equipment Site.  
 Up to 5 Gas Turbine Generators with up to 5 stacks; 
 Stacks at a height of between 35m (minimum) and 40m (maximum) 
and up to 10m (diameter);  
 Route alignments of the Gas Connection and Electrical Connection; 
and 
 Indicative layout of the Power Generation Plant Site 
APL’s Approach to Phase 1 Statutory Consultation with the Local 
Community: 2014 SoCC and Consultation Plan 
6.4.5 
S47 of the PA 2008 requires the preparation of a statement for the project 
setting out how the applicant proposes to consult people living in the vicinity 
about the proposed application.   
6.4.6 
In accordance with S47 of the PA 2008, APL produced a draft 2014 SoCC 
(Appendix 4.A.II), which was appended to the Consultation Plan (Appendix 
4.A.II), in July 2014 setting out the proposed methodology for how APL 
intended to consult people living and working in the vicinity of the Project 
during statutory consultation.  The draft 2014 SoCC (Appendix 4.A.II) did not 
set out how APL intended to undertake the other strands of Phase 1 statutory 
consultation and publicity relating to S42 and S48 of the PA 2008. 
6.4.7 
The draft 2014 SoCC (Appendix 4.A.II) and Consultation Plan (Appendix 
4.A.II) set out APL’s intention during Phase 1 consultation to consult with 
                                                      
2 PINS Advice Note Seven as applicable at the commencement of Phase 1 statutory consultation (October 2014).  
This Advice Note has subsequently been subject to minor revisions in March 2015 and December 2017.

CCS, community councils, local MPs and AMs, and to hold four public 
exhibitions where relevant information about the Project would be presented.   
6.4.8 
The draft 2014 SoCC (Appendix 4.A.II) sought to explain how APL intended 
to consult with the local community and local interest groups regarding the 
Project, and thus how APL would satisfy the consultation requirements for an 
Application under the PA 2008.  The draft 2014 SoCC (Appendix 4.A.II) 
explained the planning process associated with Applications for NSIPs, which 
requires thorough and effective pre-application to have been undertaken in 
accordance with the PA 2008 prior to consideration of acceptance for 
examination.   
6.4.9 
The draft 2014 SoCC (Appendix 4.A.II) also explained that, because of the 
nature and size of the Project, APL is undertaking an EIA to consider the 
potential environmental impacts of the Project.  Accordingly, the draft 2014 
SoCC (Appendix 4.A.II) outlined APL’s intentions to publish its preliminary 
findings in a 2014 PEIR and associated NTS (Appendix 4.C) as part of the 
pre-application consultation materials on the Project. 
6.4.10 
APL’s proposed approach to Phase 1 statutory consultation with the local 
community was set out within the draft 2014 SoCC (Appendix 4.A.II), and is 
summarised below: 
 APL would seek views on the preliminary environmental information 
presented about the Project as well as on other key elements of the 
Project: 
o The preliminary findings of the assessment as to the likely 
significant environmental effects of the Project;  
o The proposed route option(s) for accessing the Project; and, 
o The indicative layout of the power generation plant within the 
Project site. 
 Statutory consultation with the local community would run for 35 days 
ending on 16th November 2014; 
 APL would carry out consultation activities in two areas: a Core 
Consultation Zone (CCZ), equating to an approximate radius of 3.5 km 
from the Project Site, and an Outer Consultation Zone (OCZ), equating 
to a radius of approximately 8 km.  Those outside the two zones would 
also be reached through local/regional newspaper advertising and 
media coverage. 
 APL would seek and receive people’s views through a number of 
activities: 
Consultation Report 
Abergelli Power Project 
 
 
119 
 
o Public exhibitions held at Clydach (24th October), Felindre (23rd 
October), Llangyfelach (22nd October) and Tircoed (25th 
October); 
o A leaflet / letter delivered to households, businesses and 
institutions in the CCZ and to ‘hard to reach’ groups, and made 
available at libraries and council offices in the CCZ; 
o The leaflet, 2014 SoCC, 2014 PEIR and 2014 PEIR NTS made 
available for inspection at libraries and Council offices; 
o Information about the Project made available in other formats 
(e.g. large print or braille) and languages upon request; 
o A website providing information on the Project, access to 
documents, and opportunity to comment or ask questions; 
o An email address; 
o A Freepost mailbox; 
o Notification via posters, newspaper advertisements and media 
coverage; 
o Contact with a broad spectrum of local stakeholders 
6.4.11 
The draft 2014 SoCC (Appendix 4.A.II) set out APL’s intention to carry out 
Phase 1 consultation in two defined areas: a Core Consultation Zone (CCZ), 
equating to a radius of approximately 3.5 km from the Project Site; and an 
Outer Consultation Zone (OCZ), equating to a radius of approximately 8 km 
from the Project Site.  The radius of the CCZ and OCZ were based on the 
distance from the application boundary of the Project Site as at the time of 
the issue of the draft 2014 SoCC (Appendix 4.A.II) in July 2014 (Stage 10, 
Table 5-2). 
6.4.12 
The CCZ (Figure 6-1) was established in order to capture the main population 
areas in the vicinity of the Project Site that have the potential to be affected 
by the Project and are expected to have the greatest interest in the Project.  
The CCZ includes the villages of Clydach, Felindre, Llangyfelach and Tircoed, 
and all or part of the following community council areas: Clydach, 
Llangyfelach, Mawr, Morriston, Mynyddbach, Penllergaer and Pontllliw & 
Tircoed.  The extent of the CCZ was agreed with CCS. 
6.4.13 
The OCZ (Figure 6-2) was established in order to capture the main population 
areas close to the Project Site that may be interested in the Project, but that 
are not anticipated to be significantly affected by the construction, operation 
and maintenance of the Project.  The OCZ includes the main population area 
of the city of Swansea.  The extent of the OCZ was also agreed with CCS.

Phase 1 Statutory Consultation on the 2014 SoCC 
6.4.14 
S47 of the PA 2008 requires an applicant to consult the relevant local 
authority about the content of the draft statement and to have regard to any 
comments made by the relevant local authority. 
6.4.15 
In accordance with S47 of the PA 2008, APL formally issued the draft 2014 
SoCC (Appendix 4.A.II) to CCS for statutory consultation on 31st July 2014 
(Appendices 4.A.I) (Stage 10, Table 5-2), with a request for comment within 
28 days in order to inform the approach taken towards statutory S47 
consultation with the local community prior to commencement of this phase. 
6.4.16 
On 19th August 2014, APL contacted CCS via email (Appendix 4.A.III) to 
provide an update on the Project and to highlight several amendments to the 
draft 2014 SoCC (Appendix 4.A.II): 
 Following further design work in relation to the proposed Gas 
Connection and Electrical Connection, the need for route options was 
removed, and therefore statutory consultation will only include the 
preferred route alignments for both the Gas Connection and Electrical 
Connection.  Two route options remain for the proposed Access Road 
and these will be presented as part of statutory consultation.  (This 
alters the wording in bullet 2, p.22 of the draft 2014 SoCC); 
 It was noted that there is a lack of suitable, secure locations within the 
CCZ to deposit and display material for inspection; therefore advice is 
sought on whether the proposed deposit locations outside of the CCZ 
(as listed on pp.24-25 of the draft 2014 SoCC) are acceptable; 
 The provisional dates for public exhibitions are 22nd – 25th October 
2014 which avoid the half-term school holiday and include one 
exhibition on a Saturday.  (This alters the wording on p.26 of the draft 
2014 SoCC). 
6.4.17 
A formal response from CCS was received on 27th August 2014 following 
consultation with internal departments and ward members (Appendix 4.A.IV) 
(Stage 13, Table 5-2).   
6.4.18 
CCS advised that the CCS Council Offices (at Penllergaer, Swansea, SA4 
9GJ) should be included as a location suitable for the display of appropriate 
consultation materials during statutory consultation (Appendix 4.A.IV).  CCS 
also advised that it would seek to provide details on ‘hard to reach’ groups for 
the purposes of statutory consultation (Appendix 4.A.IV).  No other major land 
use related consultation exercises were identified by CCS as occurring during 
the intended statutory consultation phase (Appendix 4.A.IV). 
6.4.19 
In response to the comments made by CCS, APL revised and updated the 
draft 2014 SoCC (Appendix 4.A.II) to include CCS offices as a location at 
which consultation materials would be made available for inspection during 
the statutory consultation phase.

Phase 1 S47 Consultation 
6.4.24 
APL undertook Phase 1 statutory S47 consultation with the local community 
(Stage 24, Table 5-2) in accordance with the published 2014 SoCC 
(Appendices 4.A.V and 4.A.VI). 
6.4.25 
The statutory Phase 1 S47 consultation commenced on 13th October 2014 
and closed on 16th November 2014 (Stages 22 and 27, Table 5-2), 
representing a total duration of 35 days, in excess of the statutory minimum 
requirement of 28 days. 
6.4.26 
The aim of this period of consultation was to seek the views of the local 
community on the preliminary environmental information presented about the 
Project as well as on other key elements of the Project.  Responses were 
invited, in particular, on: 
 The findings of the preliminary assessment on the likely significant 
environmental effects of the Project during construction and operation, 
as set out in the 2014 PEIR; 
 The proposed route option(s) for accessing the Project; and 
 The indicative layout of the Power Generation Plant within the Project 
Site. 
6.4.27 
APL undertook statutory Phase 1 S47 consultation activities in two areas: the 
CCZ (Figure 6-1), equating to an area of an approximate radius of 3.5 km 
from the Project Site; and the OCZ (Figure 6-2), equating to an area of an 
approximate radius of 8 km from the Project Site, in accordance with the 
published 2014 SoCC (Appendices 4.A.V and 4.A.VI). 
Public Exhibitions 
6.4.28 
As set out in the 2014 SoCC (Appendices 4.A.V and 4.A.VI), statutory Phase 
1 S47 consultation with the local community included four public exhibitions 
in Llangyfelach, Felindre, Clydach and Tircoed on 22nd October – 25th October 
2014 (Stage 24, Table 5-2). 
6.4.29 
APL chose four separate exhibition venues at convenient locations within 
close proximity of the Project Site in order to give local people the maximum 
opportunity to attend.  Each exhibition venue met Disability Discrimination Act 
1995 requirements and, upon a reasonable and timely request, had 
provisions in place for those with special requirements seeking to attend the 
exhibition. 
6.4.30 
Table 6-8 sets out the dates, locations and times of the statutory Phase 1 S47 
public exhibitions held within the CCZ (Figure 6-1) and OCZ (Figure 6-2) in

Advertising and Publicity 
6.4.38 
The public exhibitions held during the Phase 1 statutory  consultation (Stage 
24, Table 5-2) were advertised to the local community and stakeholders via 
a number of different means (Stage 21, Table 5-2). 
6.4.39 
Prior to the first exhibition (Stage 21, Table 5-2), a leaflet (Appendix 4.D.VII) 
containing an invitation to attend the public exhibitions was delivered to 
13,000 households, businesses and institutions in the CCZ. 
6.4.40 
On 10th October 2014 (Stage 21, Table 5-2), letters (in English and Welsh) 
(Appendices 4.D.IV and 4.D.V) were sent to a total of 58 MEPs, AMs, MPs, 
local councillors and Community Councils with an invite to attend the first 
exhibition prior to the event being opened to the general public, and enclosing 
a CD including: the Phase 1 2014 SoCC (Appendices 4.A.V and 4.A.VI), 2014 
PEIR NTS (English and Welsh) (Appendix 4.C), and a leaflet outlining the 
content of the exhibition boards (Appendices 4.E.I and Appendix 4.E.II).  A 
list of the MEPs, AMs, MPs, local councillors and Community Councils to 
whom a letter was sent is included within Appendix 4.D.VI. 
6.4.41 
On 10th October 2014 (Stage 21, Table 5-2), letters (in English and Welsh) 
(Appendices 4.D.II and 4.D.III) were also sent to those groups that are defined 
as “hard to reach” (e.g. the elderly, young and minority groups) with an invite 
to attend the public exhibitions.  In order to identify “hard to reach” groups, 
APL contacted CCS via email in August 2014 (Appendix 4.A.III), during the 
statutory phase of consultation on the draft 2014 SoCC (Appendix 4.A.II), to 
request appropriate additional information and contact details.  CCS 
responded via email on 29th August 2014 to provide a list of various 
organisations on the Council’s consultation database and the appropriate 
contact details and communication method.   
6.4.42 
The list was inclusive of: 
 ethnic, racial and religious groups (local, regional or national as 
appropriate); 
 energy suppliers; 
 various community charities/groups operating in Swansea; 
 disability forums; 
 community halls; 
 professional bodies; and 
Consultation Report 
Abergelli Power Project 
 
 
131 
 
 ecological bodies/charities/groups. 
6.4.43 
Members of the APL project team reviewed the list supplied by CCS for 
appropriateness ahead of contacting them. A list of the ‘hard to reach’ groups 
is contained with Appendix 4.D.I.  Letters (in English and Welsh) (Appendices 
4.D.II and 4.D.III) with information on the Project and the consultation process 
were sent to those on the list ahead of Phase 1 consultation beginning (Stage 
21, Table 5-2).  The letters (Appendices 4.D.II and 4.D.III) advised that the 
Phase 1 2014 SoCC (Appendices 4.A.V and 4.A.VI) and 2014 PEIR had been 
produced 
and 
were 
available 
at 
the 
Project 
website, 
www.abergellipower.co.uk (Appendix 4.D.II). 
6.4.44 
Letters (in English and Welsh) (Appendix 4.D.VIII and Appendix 4.D.IX) 
enclosing posters (Appendix 4.D.X) advertising the consultation events were 
also sent out by APL to be displayed at community venues within the CCZ 
prior to the exhibitions, for example local shops, post offices and doctors’ 
surgeries (Stage 21, Table 5-2).  A list of the locations that were sent a poster 
by APL is contained within Appendix 4.D.XI.  
6.4.45 
The leaflet (available in English and Welsh) (Appendix 4.E.III), 2014 SoCC 
(available in English and Welsh) (Appendix 4.A.V and 4.A.VI), 2014 PEIR, 
and 2014 PEIR NTS (available in English and Welsh) (Appendix 4.C) were 
available for inspection at CCS offices and libraries within the CCZ and OCZ 
(listed in Table 6-9) throughout the Phase 1 statutory consultation.  The leaflet 
(Appendix 4.E.III) provided background details of the Project and details of 
the consultation process, including how individuals could get involved.

Phase 1 Regulation 11 Notification 
6.4.51 
Under Regulation 11 of the EIA Regulations, APL was required to send a 
copy of the notification under S48 of the PA 2008 to the consultation bodies 
and persons notified to the applicant in accordance with Regulation 9 of the 
EIA Regulations.   
6.4.52 
APL sent a copy of the S48 notice (in English and Welsh) to the parties listed 
in Appendix 4.H.II on 2nd October 2014 during Phase 1 consultation (Stage 
18, Table 5-2).   
6.4.53 
The copy of the S48 notice was accompanied by a covering letter (Appendix 
4.H.I) which stated APL's intention to apply to the SoS for a DCO under S37 
of the PA 2008.  The covering letter (Appendix 4.H.I) also explained that, 
under S48 of the PA 2008, APL would be publishing a notice of the proposed 
Application in the London Gazette, The Independent and the South Wales 
Evening Post.  The covering letter (Appendix 4.H.I) was issued in English with 
a copy in Welsh available on request.  
Phase 1 S46 Notification 
6.4.54 
Under S46 of the PA 2008, APL was required to notify the SoS of the 
proposed application by providing S42 consultation information prior to the 
commencement of S42 consultation.   
6.4.55 
In accordance with S46 of the PA 2008, APL issued a copy of the S42 
consultation information to PINS on 8th October 2014 (Appendix 4.J) (Stage 
19, Table 5-2) prior to the commencement of Phase 1 statutory S42 
consultation (Stage 22, Table 5-2) on 13th October 2014.  The S42 
consultation information issued to PINS consisted of the same information 
subsequently issued to S42 prescribed consultees, comprising a covering 
letter, a copy of the 2014 PEIR NTS (Appendix 4.C) and an electronic copy 
of the 2014 PEIR (Appendices 4.F and 4.J).

Phase 1 S42 Consultation 
6.4.56 
Under S42 of the PA 2008, bodies prescribed by Schedule 1 of the APFP 
Regulations must be consulted about the proposed application (the 
‘prescribed bodies’).  Schedule 1 of the APFP Regulations sets out the 
circumstances when consultees must be consulted and notified about an 
application. 
6.4.57 
APL undertook statutory S42 consultation with prescribed consultees as part 
of the Phase 1 statutory consultation on the Project.  Pursuant to S45 of the 
PA 2008 – which requires that the deadline for S42 consultation responses is 
no less than 28 days after receipt of the consultation documents – the Phase 
1 statutory S42 consultation commenced on 13th October 2014 (Stage 22, 
Table 5-2) and closed on 16th November 2014 (Stage 27, Table 5-2), 
representing a total duration of 35 days, in excess of the statutory minimum 
requirement of 28 days. 
6.4.58 
As set out in Figure 5-1, and in accordance with S42 of the PA 2008 and 
Schedule 1 of the APFP Regulations, Phase 1 statutory S42 consultation 
comprised consultation with the following: 
 S42(1)(a) – Prescribed Persons 
 S42(1)(b) – Local Authorities 
 S42(1)(d) – Land Interests 
6.4.59 
There are no S42(1)(c) parties as this category applies to the Greater London 
Authority. 
S42(1)(a) – Prescribed Persons 
6.4.60 
‘Prescribed persons’, for the purposes of S42(1)(a), are defined in Schedule 
1 of the APFP Regulations, which provides the circumstances when that 
person must be consulted or notified about an application.   
6.4.61 
In order to identify the prescribed persons required to be consulted on the 
Project, APL reviewed the guidance contained within Schedule 1 of the APFP 
Regulations, as well as the list of consultees notified of the proposed 
application by PINS (Appendix 3.B.III) under Regulation 9(1)(a) of the EIA 
Regulations. 
6.4.62 
The list of prescribed consultation bodies notified by PINS (Appendix 3.B.III) 
under Regulation 9(1)(a), which was issued to APL on 1st August 2014 with 
the EIA Scoping Opinion (Appendix 3.B.II) (Stage 11, Table 5-2), identified 
the following Community Councils and Town Councils as prescribed 
consultees: 
 Llanedi Community Council;

 Pontarddulais Community Council; 
 Betws Community Council; 
 Pontardawe Town Council; 
 Cwmamman Town Council; 
 Mawr Community Council; 
 Pontlliw and Tircoed Community Council; 
 Penllergaer Community Council; 
 Llangyfelach Community Council; 
 Clydach Community Council. 
6.4.63 
The administrative boundaries of the above Community Councils and Town 
Councils, who were consulted on and notified of the Project under S42(1)(a) 
of the PA 2008, is shown in Figure 6-3 below.

6.4.64 
The list of prescribed persons consulted on and notified of the Project under 
S42(1)(a) of the PA 2008 is provided in Appendix 4.I.I.  
S42(1)(b) – Local Authorities 
6.4.65 
‘Local authorities’, for the purposes of S42(1)(b), are defined under S43 of the 
PA 2008.  In accordance with S43 of the PA 2008, CCS is a Category B local 
authority for the purposes of statutory S42(1)(b) consultation, as the Project 
Site is wholly located within the jurisdiction of CCS.  Carmarthenshire County 
Council and Neath Port Talbot County Borough Council are Category A local 
authorities for the purposes of statutory S42(1)(b) consultation, as these local 
authorities are adjacent to CCS (Figure 3.6). Due to the administrative 
structure of local authorities in Wales, there are no Category C and D 
authorities for the purposes of S42 consultation. 
6.4.66 
The administrative boundaries of the local authorities identified above are 
shown in Figure 6-4.  CCS, Carmarthenshire County Council and Neath Port 
Talbot County Borough Council were consulted on and notified of the Project 
under S42(1)(b) of the PA 2008.

S42(1)(d) – Land Interests 
6.4.67 
‘Land interests’, for the purposes of S42(1)(d), are defined under S44 of the 
PA 2008.   
6.4.68 
Pursuant to S44 of the PA 2008, S42(1)(d) parties consist of persons either 
with a range of land interests or who may make a claim under certain land 
compensation legislation as follows: 
 A person is within Category 1 if the applicant, after making diligent 
inquiry, knows that the person is an owner, lessee, tenant (whatever 
the tenancy period) or occupier of the land. 
 A person is within Category 2 if the applicant, after making diligent 
inquiry, knows that the person – 
a) is interested in the land, or 
b) has power – 
i. 
to sell and convey the land, or 
ii. 
to release the land. 
 A person is within Category 3 if the applicant thinks that, if the order 
sought by the proposed application were to be made and fully 
implemented, the person would or might be entitled – 
a) as a result of the implementing of the order, 
b) as a result of the order having been implemented, or 
c) as a result of use of the land once the order has been 
implemented, to make a relevant claim. A "relevant claim" is 
then defined in S44 by reference to particular land 
compensation legislation. 
6.4.69 
Consultees with land interests were identified by APL through a series of 
checks. Initially plans were submitted to the Land Registry to identify all 
registered titles. These were then examined to further identify all interests 
noted against the title in each case. Site/area visits were then carried out to 
check that the desktop information being processed tallied with the 
boundaries and occupants in practice. 
6.4.70 
Further information from each landowner was sought directly by requesting 
that they complete a full enquiry form for each parcel of land stipulating the 
freehold / leasehold interests, the occupiers if any, and other rights on / over 
the land whether registered or not. All persons identified through this process 
were included within the land interest category for Phase 1 S42 consultation. 
Following the receipt of these enquiry forms, a further site and area visit was 
Consultation Report 
Abergelli Power Project

conducted to cross check the data received again against any inconsistency 
or further interest which may have been unidentified earlier in the process. 
6.4.71 
Other potential land interests were identified through diligent enquiry by 
holding meetings and reviews to discuss the total areas affected by the 
physical impacts from the Project and noting persons who may potentially 
have their use of their property affected by those impacts. Consideration was 
given to neighbouring landowners and their use of premises. 
6.4.72 
The list of land interests consulted on and notified of the Project under 
S42(1)(d) of the PA 2008 is provided in Appendix 4.I.I.  
S42 Consultation 
6.4.73 
APL issued consultation materials to prescribed consultees under S42 of the 
PA 2008 on 8th October 2014, during Phase 1 consultation (Stage 20, Table 
5-2).  The consultation materials comprised:  
 A covering letter (Appendix 4.I.II and 4.I.III), setting out an overview of: 
the Project, APL, the need for gas fired power generation, the planning 
regime under the PA 2008, and how to respond to the consultation; 
 A copy of the 2014 PEIR NTS (available in English and Welsh) 
(Appendix 4.C) – the principal consultation document, providing the 
environmental information collected to date on the Project and a 
preliminary assessment of the likely significant environmental effects 
of the Project; and 
 A CD or hard copy of the 2014 PEIR, comprising the main report and 
a volume of figures. 
6.4.74 
Phase 1 S42 consultation materials were delivered to consultees by courier 
(Stage 20, Table 5-2).  S42 consultation materials could not be delivered to 
29 consultees at 15 addresses for one of two reasons: 
 17 consultees at 11 addresses had no answer when the courier 
attempted to deliver them, and as the couriers had been instructed that 
signature was necessary, the notices for these addresses returned to 
their depot and reattempted the next day. Following a series of 
redelivery attempts by the couriers, 5 packages of S42 consultation 
materials to 4 addresses remained outstanding. These were then hand 
delivered on 16th October 2014 by a member of the project team. 4 
were signed for, and one notice was left in a dry location outside the 
relevant property, and a photograph was taken as proof of delivery.  
 12 consultees at 4 addresses had named contacts that no longer lived 
at the addresses. One S42 package of consultation materials per 
address was therefore issued to ‘The Occupier(s)’ at each address.

Additional Phase 1 S42 Consultation 
6.4.76 
Following statutory Phase 1 S42 consultation with prescribed persons in 
October and November 2014 (Stages 22 and 27, Table 5-2) and following 
continuing diligent inquiry, including re-checking of titles, rights and 
restrictions, as well as Royal Mail address checks and Companies House 
checks on all companies, additional land interests were identified.   
6.4.77 
APL issued six additional S42 prescribed consultees (Stage 31, Table 5-2) 
with the consultation materials previously provided to all other prescribed 
consultees at the commencement of Phase 1 statutory S42 consultation in 
October 2014 (Stage 22, Table 5-2), comprising a covering letter (Appendix 
4.I.IV and 4.I.V), a hard copy of the 2014 PEIR NTS (Appendix 4.C) and a CD 
of the 2014 PEIR.   
6.4.78 
For consultation materials that were issued on or after 26th January 2015 
(Stage 31, Table 5-2), the covering letter (Appendix 4.I.V) included an 
additional paragraph providing an update regarding the choice of the 
proposed Access Route and proposed amendments to the application 
boundary.  This information reflected that contained within the information 
update (Appendix 5.C.II) that was sent to all S42 prescribed consultees on 
26th January 2015 (Stage 33, Table 5-2) (see section 3.6 below). 
6.4.79 
Consultation materials were issued on the following dates with a request for 
comments within 28 days in accordance with the statutory minimum 
requirement:

Non-Statutory Consultation during Phase 1 Statutory Consultation 
Phase 
6.4.80 
APL continued to engage with CCS, PINS, locally elected representatives and 
interested parties during the Phase 1 statutory  consultation.  In addition to 
ongoing written and telephone communication, the following key consultation 
activities occurred during the Phase 1 statutory consultation. 
6.4.81 
On 20th October (Stage 23, Table 5-2), APL issued a draft contact plan 
(Appendix 4.L.I) to PINS setting out the proposed APL project milestones and 
anticipated contact with PINS up to submission of the DCO Application. 
6.4.82 
On 23rd October 2014 (Stage 25, Table 5-2), APL held an update meeting 
with CCS to discuss the Phase 1 statutory consultation and public exhibitions, 
the Application programme to submission, PINS outreach meeting and site 
visit and to identify any outstanding issues and information requirements.   
Media Coverage during Phase 1 Statutory Consultation

6.4.84 
In September and October 2014, articles were published in the all-Wales 
press and local press relating to the Project.  
6.4.85 
An article was published on the BBC News website (Appendix 4.K.II) on 13th 
October 2014. This article outlined the public consultation dates for the project 
and reported that the plant could open by 2019/2020 and create 15 full-time 
jobs when operational. It also states the energy generation capability of the 
power plant ‘up to 299 megawatts of electricity, enough to power 400,000 
homes’.  
6.4.86 
Following an enquiry to the Project press team, local media covered the 
Project on the 26th September 2014. The South Wales Evening Post 
(Appendix 4.K.IV) reported that the plans to build a power station north of 
Swansea were to go out to consultation shortly in an article titled, ‘Swansea 
gas-fired power station plan to go out to consultation’. The article quoted APL 
regarding the early feedback received from the community, provided detail 
regarding design of the power station and other energy related developments 
in the area. Insider News Wales online published a news article on 13th 
October 2014 (Appendix 4.K.III) providing an overview of what the Project 
would comprise. On Wednesday 15th October 2014, an article was published 
in the Western Mail (Appendix 4.K.I), providing details of operation of the 
proposed power station and the initial public consultation.  
6.4.87 
A televised media report was aired on S4C (Appendix 4.K.V) on 13th October 
2014, reporting that the public consultation process had commenced for a 
proposed gas power station in Felindre, near Swansea. The report featured 
comments from a representative of Friends of the Earth, who expressed the 
view that the development was ‘a wholly unnecessary investment’, and a 
representative of APL, who commented that the industry is highly regulated 
and would require an Environmental Permit to be agreed with Natural 
Resource Wales (NRW).

part of statutory Phase 1 S42 consultation but CCS were in attendance at the 
presentation. 
6.5.4 
DCfW provided a Design Review Report (Appendix 5.A.III) on 12th January 
2015 (Stage 32, Table 5-2) in which a number of comments were made with 
regards to the Project’s proposed approach to design, as summarised in 
section 7.5. 
Outreach Meeting with PINS 
6.5.5 
APL held an outreach meeting with PINS on 9th December 2014 (Stage 29, 
Table 5-2) in order to discuss the Application, the latest updates on the 
Project and stakeholder specific issues (relating to top level design, CHP, 
noise, access, and NRW).  The meeting was also attended by representatives 
of CCS, representatives of NRW, and councillors for Llangyfelach Community 
Council.  A summary of the meeting is set out at section 7.5 below and the 
minutes are contained in Appendix 5.B. 
Information Update: January 2015 
6.5.6 
During the period of Phase 1 statutory consultation undertaken between 13th 
October (Stage 22, Table 5-2) and 16th November 2014 (Stage 27, Table 5-
2), APL proposed two alternative options for the Access Route to the Project 
Site: 
 Option 1: Access from Rhyd-y-pandy Road following the route of an 
existing farm road to the north of Abergelli Farm; or 
 Option 2: Access from the B4489 using National Grid’s existing road 
to the Swansea North electrical substation and Felindre gas 
compressor station. This option would require the extension of the 
existing road. 
6.5.7 
APL indicated during Phase 1 statutory consultation in October and 
November 2014 that Option 2 was the preferred access option.  In response 
to statutory consultation feedback (Appendices 6.B, 6.C and 6.D) which 
highlighted a preference for Option 2, following the close of the Phase 1 
statutory consultation period in November 2014 (Stage 27, Table 5-2), APL 
continued to engage in discussions with National Grid in order to reach an 
agreement about the use of its road.  APL were subsequently able to reach a 
point in negotiations with National Grid where Option 1 could be removed and 
Option 2 proposed as the Access Route in the Application.  Consequently, 
the application boundary for the Project was updated.   
6.5.8 
In order to allow statutory consultees to take this change into account, APL 
wrote to all S42 prescribed consultees and locally elected representatives 
Consultation Report 
Abergelli Power Project 
 
 
148 
 
(Appendix 5.C.I and 5.C.II) on 26th January 2015 (Stage 33, Table 5-2), 
inviting any further comments on the Project to be submitted within 21 days, 
by 16th February 2015 (Stage 24, Table 5-2).  The information update letter 
sent to all S42 prescribed consultees and locally elected representatives is 
contained within Appendix 5.C.II.  A list of the S42 prescribed consultees and 
locally elected representatives whom APL wrote to is contained within 
Appendix 5.C.I. 
Information Update: March 2015 
6.5.9 
Following further detailed design work with related EIA and ongoing dialogue 
with a known landowner, the application boundary was refined to include 
approximately 4ha of additional land in order to accommodate all necessary 
ecological mitigation within the Project Site. 
6.5.10 
In order to inform statutory consultees of this change, APL wrote to all S42 
prescribed consultees and locally elected representatives (Appendix 5.D.I 
and 5.D.II) on 10th March 2015 (Stage 38, Table 5-2).  The purpose of this 
information update was to provide consultees with feedback on the outcomes 
of the consultation process prior to submission of the DCO Application.  The 
information update did not form part of formal pre-application consultation.  
The information update letter and enclosed application boundary plan that 
was sent to all S42 prescribed consultees and locally elected representatives 
is contained within Appendix 5.D.II.  A list of the S42 prescribed consultees 
and locally elected representatives whom APL wrote to is contained within 
Appendix 5.D.I. 
Other Correspondence 
6.5.11 
In addition to ongoing written and telephone communications, the following 
key consultation activities occurred during the post-statutory consultation 
phase. 
6.5.12 
Following the outreach meeting with PINS on 9th December 2014 (Stage 29, 
Table 5-2) and a meeting on 18th December 2014 with PINS to review draft 
documents for DCO Application (Stage 30, Table 5-2), APL prepared a 
revised contact plan (Appendix 5.E.I) setting out forthcoming milestones for 
engagement on the Project prior to the submission of the DCO Application.  
The contact plan (Appendix 5.E.I) was issued to PINS on 21st January 2015.  
6.5.13 
NRW, Air Ambulance, NHS Wales and Morriston Hospital were all contacted 
after the Phase 1 statutory consultation in order to gain further advice in 
respect of the design of the Project and the assessments undertaken. 
6.5.14 
APL held subsequent meetings with CCS and PINS on 24th and 25th February 
2015 (Stages 35 and 36, Table 5-2) in order to discuss the draft documents 
for the Application, draft requirements and draft DCO prior to submission.   
6.5.15 
On 6th March 2015 (Stage 37, Table 5-2), further to the conclusion of the 
Phase 1 statutory consultation, APL wrote to S42(1)(d) local authorities

Summary of Phase 1 Consultation Feedback 
7.1 
Introduction 
7.1.1 
This chapter explains the non-statutory and statutory consultation responses 
received during Phase 1 consultation.   
7.1.2 
Throughout the Phase 1 non-statutory and statutory consultation, APL 
gathered feedback on the Project from consultees via correspondence, 
meetings and feedback forms. This information can be classified as primary 
data.  APL has sought to maximise consultee involvement in the consultation 
processes, such that the comments received are representative.  
7.1.3 
The feedback received has been analysed according to the themes that are 
represented by the comments received (as set out in Appendices 6.A, 6.B 
and 6.D). Where a comment covers more than one theme, this has been 
accounted for. Where relevant, the detailed content of the comments received 
is also discussed. How APL has responded to the comments and whether 
there has been a resultant change to the Project is also discussed on a 
thematic basis. 
7.1.4 
APL acknowledges that Advice Note fourteen advocates adopting differing 
approaches to reporting the consultation responses received, depending on 
the nature of consultation and the volume of responses. APL has had regard 
to Annex A of PINS Advice note fourteen in preparing this chapter. 
7.2 
Phase 1 Non-Statutory Consultation 
7.2.1 
At the outset of the pre-application consultation phase of the Project, APL 
engaged in a series of non-statutory consultation activities with CCS, PINS, 
locally elected representatives, interested parties (Stages 1-4, 9 and 12, 
Table 5-2) and the local community (Stage 6, Table 5-2) during Phase 1 
consultation. 
7.2.2 
Initial non-statutory consultation prior to the Phase 1 statutory consultation 
comprised a number of briefing meetings and discussions with PINS, officers 
and councillors at CCS, local Community Councils and other interested 
parties (Stages 1-4, 9 and 12, Table 5-2); and initial consultation with the local 
community on 19th – 21st June 2014 (Stage 6, Table 5-2) at a series of three 
public exhibitions.  This phase of consultation occurred alongside a period of 
ongoing option appraisal and identification informed by environmental and 
engineering studies. 
Initial Phase 1 Non-Statutory Consultation with CCS, PINS, Locally 
Elected Representatives and Interested Parties 
7.2.3 
APL undertook non-statutory consultation with PINS, CCS, locally elected 
representatives and other interested parties via a number of briefing meetings 
and discussions (Stages 1-4, 9 and 12, Table 5-2) during Phase 1 
Consultation Report 
Abergelli Power Project

consultation.  A summary of the feedback received during non-statutory 
discussions, prior to the commencement of Phase 1 statutory consultation, is 
set out below (also see Appendix 2.D). 
7.2.4 
On 20th January 2014 (Stage 1, Table 5-2), an initial meeting was held with 
CCS to introduce APL and to discuss the Project.  CCS promoted the 
importance of sustainable development and advised APL to consider the 
visual impact and cumulative impact of the proposals (Appendix 2.D.I). 
7.2.5 
On 29th April 2014 (Stage 1, Table 5-2), a subsequent follow-up meeting was 
held with CCS planning officers.  CCS advised that the community may feel 
unsettled by additional infrastructure developments, and that APL should 
consider the visual impact of the Project and the impact on proposed housing 
sites allocated within the LDP (Appendix 2.D.II).  CCS also advised APL to 
undertake an initial briefing with councillors in advance of the Project being 
made public (Appendix 2.D.II). 
7.2.6 
On 29th April 2014 (Stage 2, Table 5-2), APL held a meeting with Welsh Water 
to discuss the Water Main running across the Project Site.  Welsh Water 
advised that it would not normally agree to the enclosure of the facility within 
a locked compound; however given the unusual nature of the development 
and that the compound would be manned for 24hrs, this arrangement was 
considered to be acceptable (Appendix 2.D.III).    
7.2.7 
On 17th July 2014 (Stage 2, Table 5-2), APL held a meeting with members of 
Llangyfelach Community Council in order to introduce the Project.  
Councillors asked questions about access and the choice of site and 
concerns were raised in respect of the height and visual impact of the stacks.   
7.2.8 
On 18th July 2014 (Stage 9, Table 5-2), APL held an update meeting with 
CCS planning officers following Phase 1 non-statutory consultation with the 
local community in order to discuss: feedback received from the informal 
consultation, the Application programme, the content of the draft 2014 SoCC 
and the EIA Scoping Opinion.  The key issues raised regarding the draft 2014 
SoCC related to the extension of the CCZ, identification of ‘hard to reach’ 
groups and the deposit locations for the 2014 SoCC.  A meeting note is 
contained in Appendix 2.D.VI. 
7.2.9 
On 5th August 2014 (Stage 2, Table 5-2), APL held a meeting with members 
of Pontlliw and Tircoed Community Council in order to introduce the Project.  
Councillors raised queries regarding the electricity connection, site selection 
process, emissions, noise, job numbers and the length of the construction 
period (Appendix 2.D.VII). 
7.2.10 
On 8th October 2014 (Stage 2, Table 5-2), APL held a meeting with Welsh 
Water to discuss potable/service water pipeline protection.  The purpose of 
the meeting was to: discuss and agree the requirements for any protection 
methods/working in the close vicinity of the potable/service Water Main; 
obtain original/archive Welsh Water “as-built” drawing records and design 
reports; and to open discussions to adapt the APL protective provisions

relating to Welsh Water assets which could be impacted by the project 
(Appendix 2.D.VIII).  Welsh Water stated that in their view the southwest 
access road caused the least disruption (Appendix 2.D.VIII).  Welsh Water 
agreed to provide further details of the pipeline to APL. 
Phase 1 Non-Statutory Consultation with the Local Community 
7.2.11 
APL undertook initial Phase 1 non-statutory consultation with the local 
community at three public exhibitions in Clydach, Felindre and Tircoed on 19th 
– 21st June 2014 (Stage 6, Table 5-2).   
7.2.12 
The Project description at the commencement of Phase 1 non-statutory 
consultation with the local community was as set out at section 6.2 above. 
Overview 
7.2.13 
A total of 94 people attended the three public exhibitions held in Clydach, 
Felindre and Tircoed in June 2014 (Stage 6, Table 5-2)), of whom 38.3% (36 
people) returned a feedback form.  Table 7-1 sets out the number of 
attendees and the feedback form response rate at each of the three public 
exhibitions.

EIA Scoping Opinion 
7.3.1 
An EIA Scoping Opinion (Appendix 3.B.II)) was received from the SoS on 1st 
August 2014 (Stage 11, Table 5-2) during Phase 1 consultation.   
7.3.2 
The Scoping Opinion (Appendix 3.B.II) included a list of all consultees 
consulted (Appendix 3.B.III), as required by Regulation 9 of the EIA 
Regulations, and the SoS’ comments on the proposed development and the 
EIA approach and topic areas. 
7.3.3 
The Scoping Opinion (Appendix 3.B.II) identified the main potential Project 
issues as: air quality, landscape and visual and water quality and resources.  
The SoS also noted the potential need to carry out an assessment under the 
Habitats Regulations. 
7.3.4 
The SoS confirmed the following topics would be unlikely to have significant 
environmental effects and so could be excluded from the EIA: 
 Operational Air Quality Emissions of the Gas and Electrical 
Connections; 
 The Operational Noise and Vibration Impacts of the Gas Connections; 
 Water Framework Directive Report; and, 
 Visual impacts on the Gower AONB. 
7.3.5 
The SoS recommended that further justification be provided for the scoping 
out of the following elements: 
 Operational Noise/Impacts of the Electricity Connection; and 
 Drainage/Water quality impacts of the gas and electricity connections 
during the operational and decommissioning phases 
7.3.6 
The Scoping Opinion (Appendix 3.B.II) has been considered in undertaking 
the EIA and in the production of the 2014 & 2018 PEIR (during both Phase 1 
and Phase 2 consultation).  Further details on how APL has taken on board 
the Scoping Opinion (Appendix 3.B.II) are provided in Appendix 4.1 of the ES 
(Document Reference 6.2). 
7.4 
Phase 1 Statutory Consultation

7.4.12 
A complete list of the consultation responses received during Phase 1 
statutory S47 consultation, together with APL’s response, is provided in 
Appendix 6.B. 
7.4.13 
It should be noted that each response is considered on its own merit and thus 
the number of comments in respect of one individual topic area may not 
correlate directly to the importance of that individual area.   
7.4.14 
The most common topics for comment related to (Appendix 6.B): 
 Site selection; 
 Landscape; 
 Transport; 
 Community Benefit; 
 Need for the Project; and 
 Socio-economics 
Site Selection 
7.4.15 
A number of respondents opposed the selection of the Project Site, primarily 
due to the rural character of the area, and queried whether alternative sites 
had been considered (Appendix 6.B). 
Landscape 
7.4.16 
A number of respondents highlighted the visual impact of the Project as a 
particular concern, as the stacks would create an eyesore which would 
change the character of the area.  However it was noted that the Project is 
located close to the former steel works, thereby reducing the additional visual 
impact (Appendix 6.B).  The use of tree barriers was also suggested 
(Appendix 6.B). 
Transport 
7.4.17 
A number of respondents raised concerns regarding the proposed access 
routes due to the capacity of the roads and inability to accommodate 
construction traffic (Appendix 6.B).  Concerns were also raised in respect of 
the impact of traffic on Morriston Hospital (Appendix 6.B). 
Community Benefit 
7.4.18 
Respondents suggested that short-term employment benefits during 
construction would not be experienced directly by the local community 
(Appendix 6.B).  Respondents also queried whether there would be any long-
term benefits to the local community (Appendix 6.B).  Several respondents 
Consultation Report 
Abergelli Power Project 
 
 
163 
 
stated an interest in future work opportunities and recommended the inclusion 
of training opportunities for young people (Appendix 6.B). 
Need for the Project 
7.4.19 
Several respondents acknowledged the need for new energy infrastructure 
(Appendix 6.B).  Other respondents queried the need for a gas-fired power 
station given that there is a greater need for renewable energy which is 
already being met in the local area (Appendix 6.B). 
Socio-economics 
7.4.20 
Respondents queried the impact of the Project on the value of local homes 
(Appendix 6.B).  Respondents suggested that short-term employment 
benefits during construction would not be experienced directly by the local 
community (Appendix 6.B).  Respondents also queried whether there would 
be any long-term benefits to the local community (Appendix 6.B).  Several 
respondents stated an interest in future work opportunities and recommended 
the inclusion of training opportunities for young people (Appendix 6.B). 
Overall View of the Project 
7.4.21 
As illustrated in Figure 7-10, 33% of all respondents were supportive of the 
proposal to build the Project, with 17% not supportive.   
7.4.22 
All respondents in Tircoed were supportive of the Project.  
7.4.23 
29% of respondents in Llangyfelach were supportive of the Project. 33% of 
respondents were undecided and 13% were neutral. 17% were not supportive 
and 8% returned the form but did not answer this question.  
7.4.24 
24% of respondents in Felindre were supportive of the Project. No 
respondents were undecided and 35% were neutral. 29% were not supportive 
and 12% of respondents returned the form but did not answer this question.

Phase 1 S48 Publicity 
7.4.27 
APL did not receive any consultation responses that identified themselves as 
responding to S48 publicity (Appendix 4.G) although it is likely that S48 
publicity (Appendix 4.G) will have had an influence on some consultees in 
accessing S42 / S47 consultation materials. 
Phase 1 S42 Consultation 
7.4.28 
APL undertook statutory Phase 1 S42 consultation with prescribed 
consultees as part of the statutory consultation on the Project, commencing 
on 13th October 2014 (Stage 22, Table 5-2) and closing on 16th November 
2014 (Stage 27, Table 5-2).  Following amendments to the application 
boundary and ongoing diligent enquiry (as explained at section 3.5 above), 
six additional land interests were identified.  APL subsequently undertook 
additional Phase 1 S42 consultation with additional land interests between 
December 2014 and March 2015 (Stage 31, Table 5-2). 
7.4.29 
As set out in Figure 5-1, and in accordance with S42 of the PA 2008, statutory 
Phase 1 S42 consultation comprised consultation with the following: 
 S42(1)(a) – Prescribed Persons; 
 S42(1)(b) – Local Authorities; 
 S42(1)(d) – Land Interests 
7.4.30 
A total of 28 prescribed consultees responded to the Phase 1 S42 
consultation (Appendix 6.C).  Table 7-3 illustrates the number of responses 
in respect of S42(1)(a), S42(1)(b) and S42(1)(d) (Appendix 6.C).  
Respondents classified as S42(1)(a) and 42(1)(d) consultees have been 
counted separately.

It should be noted that each response is considered on its own merit and thus 
the number of comments in respect of one individual topic area may not 
correlate directly to the importance of that individual area.   
7.4.35 
The most common topics for comment related to (Appendix 6.D): 
 Consultation; 
 Air Quality; 
 EIA; 
 Safety; 
 Water; and, 
 Noise. 
Consultation 
7.4.36 
A number of respondents acknowledged that the Project may be subject to 
updates and revisions and therefore request ongoing consultation on 
following further detailed design and assessment work (Appendices 6.C and 
6.D).  Additional consultation was recommended in particular with CCS and 
NRW regarding the likely environmental impacts of the Project and 
associated mitigation (Appendices 6.C and 6.D). 
Air Quality 
7.4.37 
A number of respondents provided advice in respect of the baseline and 
future monitoring for the air quality assessment (Appendices 6.C and 6.D).  
Several respondents raised concerns in respect of the impact of the Project 
on air quality and the resultant effects on health and wellbeing and the water 
quality of the Lower Lliw Reservoir (Appendices 6.C and 6.D).  It was 
recommended that the impacts arising from emissions should be considered 
in respect of all applicable routes of exposure and the impact on all receptors 
during construction, operation and decommissioning (Appendices 6.C and 
6.D). 
EIA 
7.4.38 
Respondents provided advice in respect of the issues to be considered when 
undertaking the EIA (Appendices 6.C and 6.D).  It was recommended, in 
particular, that the EIA identifies off-site human receptors and includes 
consideration of the impact of the Project on: National Grid’s existing assets; 
water quality and resources (including the Lower Lliw Reservoir); 
contaminated land; noise levels during construction and start-up; and habitat 
loss (Appendices 6.C and 6.D).  Further information was requested in the ES 
(Document Reference 6.1) in respect of the opportunities for mitigation and 
the consideration of alternative sites (Appendices 6.C and 6.D). 
Consultation Report 
Abergelli Power Project 
 
 
168 
 
Safety 
7.4.39 
Respondents provided general advice regarding the safety requirements to 
consider as a result of the stack heights and the location of the Project Site, 
in respect of aviation, rail infrastructure, Major Accident Hazard pipelines, 
hazardous substances, health and safety and electrical safety clearances 
(Appendices 6.C and 6.D). 
Water 
7.4.40 
Respondents advised that the EIA should include an assessment of the 
impact of the Project in respect of water quality on human health as well as 
ecology (Appendices 6.C and 6.D).  The EIA should also include 
consideration of the impact of the Project on the water quality of Lower Lliw 
Reservoir, and the ES (Document Reference 6.1) should include a WFD 
screening assessment (Appendices 6.C and 6.D).  It was recommended that 
SUDS is implemented wherever possible and that APL continues to engage 
in discussions regarding the impact of the Project on the Water Main crossing 
the site (Appendices 6.C and 6.D).  Advice was also provided in respect of 
Flood Defence Consent and a Water Discharge Activity Permit (Appendices 
6.C and 6.D). 
Noise 
7.4.41 
Several respondents raised concerns in respect of the potential noise impact 
of the Project on health and wellbeing, due to the proximity of the Project Site 
to human receptors (Appendices 6.C and 6.D).  The sampling and noise 
monitoring locations used for preliminary assessments were queried, and 
further information was requested in respect of noise mitigation (Appendices 
6.C and 6.D). 
Non-Statutory Consultation during Phase 1 Statutory Consultation 
Phase 
7.4.42 
APL continued to engage with CCS, PINS, locally elected representatives and 
interested parties via non-statutory consultation activities during the Phase 1 
statutory consultation (Stage 23 – 27, Table 5-2).   
7.4.43 
On 23rd October 2014 (Stage 25, Table 5-2), APL held an update meeting 
with CCS (Appendix 4.L.II) to discuss the Phase 1 statutory consultation and 
public exhibitions, the  Application programme to submission, PINS outreach 
meeting and site visit and to identify any outstanding issues and information 
requirements.  CCS requested further information regarding the Statement of 
Common Ground (SoCG) and draft DCO (Document Reference 3.1.0).  CCS 
advised that it does not have a Code of Construction Practice to be complied 
with; however noted that some technical matters are currently being 
discussed separately with various internal consultees (Appendix 4.L.II).

A number of additional non-statutory consultation activities were undertaken 
by APL (Stages 28-30 and 32-40, Table 5-2) following the Phase 1 statutory 
consultation, as summarised above in Table 6-13. 
Design Review Panel (DCfW) 
7.5.2 
DCfW provided a Design Review Report (Appendix 5.A.III) on 12th January 
2015 (Stage 32, Table 5-2) in which a number of comments were made in 
regards to the Project’s proposed approach to design.  Table 7-4 summarises 
DCfW’s comments in the Design Review Report (Appendix 5.A.III). 
Table 7-4: DCfW comments in Design Review Report  
DCfW Comment 
“The Design Commission supports this well considered and well justified 
scheme, and believes that the design processes that the team are 
undertaking are guiding the project in the right direction” 
The site selection rationale is commended and economic development at 
this location is supported. 
Visual impact in long views is accepted as being dependent on the detailed 
design, and whilst accepting it is a matter for the promoter they “would prefer 
to see five smaller units rather than two or three much larger ones.” 
DCfW do not seek a camouflaging of the scheme although understand it is 
widely accepted to use colouring and materials to this end.  DCfW 
encourage “a simple colour scheme with a darker colour for the base and a 
lighter colour for the flues.” 
Edge landscaping and minimising hardstanding, and reinforcing the eastern 
edge of the power plant site with woodland planting, would help to reflect its 
location. 
DCfW consider that retaining the ‘gallops’ through the centre of the site may 
be beneficial for public use. 
DCfW would encourage the development of a farm wide management plan 
to 
include 
landscape 
patterns, 
boundaries, 
planting, 
recreation, 
maintenance and decommissioning.

Outreach Meeting with PINS 
7.5.3 
APL held an outreach meeting with PINS on 9th December 2014 (Stage 29, 
Table 5-2) in order to discuss the Application, the latest updates on the 
Project and stakeholder specific issues (relating to top level design, CHP, 
noise, access, and NRW) (Appendix 5.B).  The meeting was also attended by 
representatives of CCS, representatives of NRW, and councillors for 
Llangyfelach Community Council.  The following feedback was received: 
 DCO process: PINS gave a presentation on the DCO process and 
emphasised communication during the pre-application stage between 
the applicant, local authorities and statutory parties.  Early work on the 
SoCG was encouraged in order to narrow down issues.  PINS 
emphasised the importance of the Local Impact Report prepared by 
the local authority during examination. 
 Top level design:  
o Attendees discussed the design of the Generating Equipment 
and any alternative possibilities; 
o Concerns were raised by local councillors regarding the location 
and strategic need for the proposed development. PINS 
advised that the proposed development will be considered in 
accordance with relevant NPSs and important and relevant 
considerations in Technical Advice Notes.  CCS advised that 
the emerging LDP is currently being progressed.   
o NRW advised considering the Environmental Permit early in the 
process.  
o PINS advised ‘twin-tracking’ DCO and Environmental Permit 
applications.   
 CHP: PINS advised APL to prepare information to address the 
requirements of NPSs in respect of CHP. 
 Noise: Concerns were raised regarding the working hours at the 
proposed power station.   
 NRW: NRW advised that it has previously responded to consultation.  
NRW encouraged submission of draft ES chapters.  Potential habitat 
implications of the proposed access routes were noted. 
7.5.4 
Minutes of the outreach meeting with PINS on 9th December 2014 (Stage 29, 
Table 5-2) are contained in Appendix 5.B.

Information Update: January 2015 
7.5.5 
Following the selection of the proposed Access Route for the Application, APL 
wrote to all S42 prescribed consultees and locally elected representatives 
(Appendices 5.C.I and 5.C.II) on 26th January 2015 (Stage 33, Table 5-2), 
inviting any further comments on the Project to be submitted within 21 days, 
by 16th February 2015.  
7.5.6 
A total of six consultation responses were received in respect of the 
information update issued in January 2015 (Stage 33, Table 5-2), which are 
summarised in Appendix 6.E.   
7.5.7 
Comments received advised of the need to consider the impact of vehicles 
accessing the power plant on the Llangyfelach Tunnel, and to consider the 
potential for prior extraction of minerals (Appendix 6.E).  Four of the 
consultation responses make no further comment or acknowledge that there 
are no plants or apparatus in the application boundary or within the immediate 
proximity (Appendix 6.E). 
Information Update: March 2015 
7.5.8 
Following further amendments to the application boundary in order to 
accommodate all necessary ecological mitigation within the Project Site, APL 
wrote to all S42 prescribed consultees and locally elected representatives 
(Appendices 5.D.I and 5.D.II) on 10th March 2015 (Stage 38, Table 5-2) during 
Phase 1 statutory consultation in order to inform of this change. 
7.5.9 
APL received no feedback in respect of this information update prior to the 
decision to put the Project “on hold” in late March 2015.   
Other Correspondence 
7.5.10 
Morrison Hospital were contacted in relation to their air ambulance services 
and confirmed via email on 23rd February 2015 that the power station stacks 
“will not conflict with our [Bond Air Services] operations in and out of Swansea 
Morriston Hospital” and that it would be “beneficial” to add lighting to the tops 
of the stacks. 
7.5.11 
On 6th March 2015 (Stage 37, Table 5-2), APL wrote to S42(1)(b) local 
authorities in order to request an informal indication as to whether or not the 
local authority considered the consultation to be adequate (Appendix 5.E.II).  
A response was received from CCS on 12th March 2015 (Stage 37, Table 5-
2), which stated (Appendix 5.E.III): 
7.5.12 
“In my informal opinion, the consultation exercise carried out by APL was in 
accordance with the proposals set out in the statement of community 
consultation and was therefore adequate in this respect.  APL have engaged 
in consultation with both the Local Planning Authority, the local community 
and other interested parties and provided adequate supporting information to 
explain the proposals as they have developed.

Description of Phase 2 Consultation 
8.1 
Introduction 
8.1.1 
This chapter describes the non-statutory and statutory consultation activities 
that APL undertook between April 2017 and May 2018 as part of the Phase 
2 consultation.  
8.1.2 
In March 2015, it was decided by the previous owners of the Project to put it 
“on hold” primarily because of the then market conditions for new power 
generation in the UK.  However, after acquisition of APL by Drax in December 
2016 (further described in section 2.3 above) the Project was publicly “re-
launched” in April 2017. In accordance with the PA 2008 DCLG pre-
application guidance (paragraph 73) APL decided to undertake a second 
phase of consultation after the Project was relaunched in 2017.  
8.2 
Phase 2 Non-Statutory Consultation (April 2017 – January 2018) prior 
to Phase 2 Statutory Consultation 
8.2.1 
As was the case for Phase 1 non-statutory consultation prior to statutory 
consultation, 
initial 
Phase 
2 
non-statutory 
consultation 
comprised 
engagement by APL, following the relaunch of the Project, with CCS, PINS, 
NRW, interested parties, locally elected representatives, previous consultees 
and the local community.  This period of consultation commenced in April 
2017 up to the commencement of Phase 2 statutory consultation in January 
2018 (Stages 41-50, Table 5-2).  Subsequent non-statutory consultation 
occurred on an ongoing basis during Phase 2 statutory consultation (Stages 
62 & 65, Table 5-2) (described at section 8.5 below) and following Phase 2 
statutory consultation (Stage 71-73, Table 5-2) (described at section 8.6 
below). 
8.2.2 
The focus of the initial Phase 2 non-statutory consultation was to inform those 
who were not involved with Phase 1 consultation about the Project, to update 
those who were previously consulted during the Phase 1 consultation on the 
changes to the Project, to explain why the Project was progressing once 
again towards submission of a DCO application and to ask for feedback from 
consultees on the Project.  
Phase 2 Non-Statutory Consultation with CCS, PINS, NRW, Locally 
Elected Representatives and Interested Parties 
8.2.3 
APL undertook informal non-statutory consultation with a range of 
stakeholders prior to the commencement of the Phase 2 statutory 
consultation period.  Table 8-1 provides a summary list of the stakeholders 
consulted and the details of correspondence.  A summary of feedback 
received from non-statutory consultation with stakeholders is provided in 
section 9.2.  The minutes of the meetings held are contained within Appendix 
7.A.

8.2.4 
On 30th March 2017, following previous correspondence during Phase 1 
consultation, a meeting was held with PINS to discuss the relaunch of the 
Project (Stage 41, Table 5-2).  Subsequent follow-up teleconference calls 
were held with PINS on 28th September (Stage 44, Table 5-2) and 15th 
December 2017 (Stage 50, Table 5-2) to discuss general Project updates, 
statutory consultation, environmental permitting, review of draft documents 
and Welsh language standards.   
8.2.5 
On 19th April 2017, following the initial meeting with PINS on 30th March 2017 
(Stage 41, Table 5-2), an update call was held with CCS to inform of the 
Project relaunch (Stage 42, Table 5-2).  Subsequent meetings were held with 
CCS on 3rd October 2017 and 11th December 2017 (Stage 46, Table 5-2) to 
discuss Project updates and the programme up to submission of the DCO 
Application.  APL engaged with CCS on an ongoing basis between meetings 
to discuss the EIA requirements and consenting framework. 
8.2.6 
APL also discussed the EIA requirements on an ongoing basis with NRW, 
following issue of an EIA Project briefing note (Appendix 9.A.IV) on 3rd 
October 2017 (Stage 45, Table 5-2).  A site visit was held on 8th November 
2017 (Stage 45, Table 5-2) and a number of calls and email correspondence 
with APL from October 2017 onwards (Stage 45, Table 5-2) regarding specific 
issues relating to ecology, flood risk, ground conditions and water quality and 
resources. 
8.2.7 
In addition, APL engaged with local MPs, AMs and Community Councils via 
meetings, calls and email communication (Stages 43 and 49, Table 5-2) prior 
Consultation Report 
Abergelli Power Project 
 
 
176 
 
to Phase 2 statutory consultation.  An invitation to a stakeholder preview 
event prior to the first public exhibition was issued on 9th January (Stage 56, 
Table 5-2) to CCS (Appendix 9.A.III) and 32 invitees comprising local AMs, 
local MPs, Community Councils, ward members and Cabinet members 
(Appendix 9.A.II). 
Refresh of Regulation 9 list 
8.2.8 
As noted at section 7.3 above, as part of its Scoping Opinion issued in August 
2014 during Phase 1 consultation, the SoS provided a list of all consultees 
consulted on the EIA Scoping request (Appendix 3.B), as required by 
Regulation 9 of the EIA Regulations.  The Regulation list included Schedule 
1 consultees, relevant statutory undertakers, local authorities and non-
prescribed consultation bodies, who were consulted during Phase 1 statutory 
consultation. 
8.2.9 
The 2014 Regulation 9 list was refreshed and updated during Phase 2 non-
statutory consultation in order to inform the subsequent Phase 2 statutory 
consultation.  This comprised written enquiries (issued on 24th November 
2017) and follow-up correspondence as required with these consultees, to 
confirm or update relevant contact details from the 2014 Regulation 9 list.  
The updated Regulation 9 list (Appendix 8.B) was finalised on 17th December 
2017.  This ensured that accurate contact details were collated for all 
consultees prior to the commencement of Phase 2 statutory consultation. 
8.3 
EIA Scoping Consultation (March 2017) 
8.3.1 
APL held an update meeting with PINS on 30th March 2017 (Stage 41, Table 
5-2) to discuss various matters relating to the Project, including the validity of 
the 2014 EIA Scoping Opinion (Appendix 3.B), as well as general Project 
updates, the consenting framework, consultation and draft application 
documents.  This meeting informed the status of the 2014 Scoping Opinion 
(Appendix 3.B) for the purposes of the EIA for the Project.   
8.3.2 
New regulations governing EIA came into force on 16th May 2017.  However, 
Regulation 37 of the EIA Regulations 2017 contain transitional provisions 
which provide that where an applicant had sought an EIA screening or 
scoping opinion prior to the date the regulations came into force, the EIA 
Regulations would continue to apply.  PINS confirmed that the 2014 Scoping 
Opinion (Appendix 3.B) remained valid, thereby informing future consultation 
on the Project. 
8.4 
Phase 2 Statutory Consultation (January 2018 – February 2018) 
8.4.1 
Following the period of Phase 2 non-statutory consultation described above, 
and the earlier Phase 1 statutory consultation, APL undertook a series of 
further activities during Phase 2 consultation in accordance with the statutory 
consultation requirements of the PA 2008.  
Consultation Report 
Abergelli Power Project 
 
 
177 
 
8.4.2 
As per the earlier Phase 1 statutory consultation, the Phase 2 statutory 
consultation similarly consisted of: 
 S47 consultation on the draft 2018 SoCC (Appendix 9.A) (Stages 47 
& 48, Table 5-2); 
 S47 consultation with the local community (Stages 60, 66 & 68, Table 
5-2); 
 S48 publicity (including notification under Regulations 11 of the EIA 
Regulations) (Stages 53, 60 & 68, Table 5-2); 
 S46 notification (Stage 58, Table 5-2); and 
 S42 consultation (Stages 60, 63, 68, 70 & 75, Table 5-2). 
Project Description for Phase 2 Statutory Consultation 
8.4.3 
As a result of feedback received during Phase 1 consultation (discussed at 
chapter 7 above) (Stages 1-40, Table 5-2) and Phase 2 non-statutory 
consultation (Stages 41-51, Table 5-2) as well as further design and 
operational considerations, several changes were made to the Project which 
were explained and were the subject of Phase 2 statutory consultation, as 
listed in Table 8-2. 
Table 8-2 Summary of Project changes since Phase 1 consultation 
Project 
Component 
Changes in design since the 2014 PEIR (Phase 1 
Consultation) 
Power 
Generation 
Plant 
The Power Generation Plant was made up of only one 
Gas Turbine Generator with one exhaust gas flue stack, 
rather than up to five. 
The stack height was a maximum of 45 m, instead of 40 
m. 
The Generating Equipment Site was moved north of the 
Water Main. 
An access route was selected from the B4489 to the 
west of the Generating Equipment instead of the 
alternative construction access route from the north. 
Two onsite options for the new section of the Access 
Road were presented. 
Electrical 
Connection 
The Electrical Connection runs alongside the road rather 
than under for ease of maintenance. 
 
Consultation Report 
Abergelli Power Project 
 
 
178 
 
8.4.4 
The full Project description during Phase 2 statutory consultation was the 
same as that set out in the 2018 PEIR, in accordance with PINS Advice Note 
seven, as follows: 
 Power Generation Plant: An Open Cycle Gas Turbine (OCGT) peaking 
power generating station, fuelled by natural gas and capable of 
providing a rated electrical output of up to 299 Megawatts (MW). The 
Power Generation Plant comprises: 
o Generating Equipment including one Gas Turbine Generator 
with one exhaust gas flue stack and Balance of Plant (BOP) 
(together referred to as the ‘Generating Equipment’) which are 
located within the ‘Generating Equipment Site’; 
o An Access Road to the Project Site from the B4489 which lies 
to the west, formed by upgrading an existing access road 
between the B4489 junction and the Swansea North Substation 
(the Substation) and constructing a new section of access road 
from the Substation to the Generating Equipment Site; and 
o A temporary construction compound for the storage of 
materials, plant and equipment as well as containing site 
accommodation and welfare facilities, temporary car parking 
(see section 3.4) and temporary fencing (the Laydown Area).  A 
small area within the Laydown Area will be retained 
permanently (the Maintenance Compound).  
o Ecological Mitigation Area – area for potential reptile 
translocation and ecological enhancement. Location and area 
to be confirmed post-consultation once discussions with NRW 
and CCS have been undertaken. Area likely to be 
commensurate with the extent of mitigation required and within 
the Order Limits of the Project. 
o Permanent parking and drainage to include: a site foul, oily 
water and surface water drainage system. 
 Gas Connection: The Gas Connection will be in the form of a new 
above ground installation (AGI) and underground gas connection (the 
Gas Pipeline). This is to bring natural gas to the Generating Equipment 
from the National Gas Transmission System. The Gas Pipeline will 
follow an approximate north-south route corridor, between the National 
Gas Transmission System south of Rhydy-pandy Road and the 
Generating Equipment Site. 
 Electrical Connection: This is an underground electrical cable to export 
power from the Generating Equipment to the National Grid Electricity 
Transmission System (NETS). 
8.4.5 
Several options were therefore under consideration at this time, including: 
Consultation Report 
Abergelli Power Project 
 
 
179 
 
 The final layout and location of the Generating Equipment; and 
 The proposed route option(s) for the new section of Access Road, 
comprising: 
o Option A: This option was originally shown within the 2014 
PEIR, and extends south from the car park adjacent to the 
Felindre Gas Compressor Station down a grassed embankment 
towards open fields and then north-eastwards towards the 
Generating Equipment Site. 
o Option B: This option has identified an alternative which begins 
before the original spur at the car park adjacent to the Felindre 
Gas Compressor Station and again extends southward towards 
open fields but with a more gentle angle of approach, visibility 
and descent towards the open fields. This would also avoid an 
element of cut and fill, although some excavation is still likely. 
8.4.6 
It was also important to clarify the consenting framework for the Project prior 
to the commencement of Phase 2 consultation. 
8.4.7 
The capacity of the Power Generation Plant will be up to 299 MW of electricity. 
As such, it is classified as a NSIP under the PA 2008 and requires a DCO to 
build and operate.  However, in the context of generating stations in Wales, 
the Planning Act 2008 restricts what can be applied for through the DCO 
process to development that is integral to and forms part of the NSIP. For the 
Project, the integral elements are the Power Generation Plant, the Laydown 
Area/Maintenance Compound and the Access Road.  
8.4.8 
It was therefore clarified that, the APL DCO application will not seek consent 
to construct and operate the gas or electrical connections; instead a planning 
application will be made under the Town and Country Planning Act 1990 or 
permitted development rights will be utilised (as applicable). However, 
compulsory acquisition powers for the land and rights required to construct, 
operate and maintain the gas and electrical connections will be included 
within the DCO application. 
APL’s Approach to Phase 2 Statutory Consultation with the Local 
Community: 2018 SoCC 
8.4.9 
As noted at section 6.4, S47 of the PA 2008 requires the preparation of a 
statement setting out how the applicant proposes to consult people living in 
the vicinity about the proposed application.   
8.4.10 
In accordance with S47 of the PA 2008, and further to the 2014 SoCC 
(Appendix 4.A) published for Phase 1 consultation, APL produced a draft 
2018 SoCC (Appendix 9.A) in November 2017 (Stage 47, Table 5-2), setting 
out the proposed methodology for how APL intended to consult people living 
and working in the vicinity of the Project during Phase 2 statutory consultation.   
Consultation Report 
Abergelli Power Project 
 
 
180 
 
8.4.11 
The draft 2018 SoCC (Appendix 9.A) proposed a similar methodology for 
consultation to that set out in the Phase 1 2014 SoCC (Appendix 4.A), having 
regard to the previous consultation feedback received from CCS on the 
Phase 1 2014 SoCC (Appendix 4.A).    
8.4.12 
For clarity, the draft 2018 SoCC (Appendix 9.A) did not set out how APL 
intends to undertake the other strands of Phase 2 statutory consultation and 
publicity relating to S42 and S48 of the PA 2008. 
8.4.13 
The draft 2018 SoCC (Appendix 9.A) explained the planning and consenting 
process associated with generating stations in Wales, noting that for 
generating stations up to 350MW the PA 2008 restricts what can be applied 
for through the DCO regime to development that is integral to and forms part 
of the NSIP.  The 2018 SoCC (Appendix 9.A) therefore clarified that the APL 
DCO application would not seek consent to construct and operate the gas or 
electrical connections, and instead a planning application would be made 
under the Town and Country Planning Act 1990 or permitted development 
rights would be utilised (as applicable). However, compulsory acquisition 
powers for the land and rights required to construct, operate and maintain the 
gas and electrical connections would be included within the DCO application. 
8.4.14 
The planning process for NSIPs, explained in the 2018 SoCC, requires 
thorough and effective pre-application to have been undertaken in 
accordance with the PA 2008 prior to consideration of acceptance for 
examination.  As such, the draft 2018 SoCC (Appendix 9.A) set out APL’s 
intention during Phase 2 consultation to consult with CCS, community 
councils, local MPs and AMs, and to hold four public exhibitions where 
relevant information about the Project would be presented.  The draft 2018 
SoCC (Appendix 9.A) also sought to explain how APL intended to consult 
with the local community and local interest groups regarding the Project 
during Phase 2 consultation, and thus how APL would satisfy the consultation 
requirements for an Application under the PA 2008.   
8.4.15 
The draft 2018 SoCC (Appendix 9.A) also explained that APL is undertaking 
an EIA to consider the potential environmental impacts of the Project, and 
intended to publish its preliminary findings in a 2018 PEIR (updated from the 
2014 PEIR) and associated NTS (Appendix 9.H) as part of the pre-application 
consultation materials on the Project. 
8.4.16 
APL’s proposed approach to Phase 2 statutory consultation with the local 
community was set out within the draft 2018 SoCC (Appendix 9.A), and is 
summarised below: 
 APL would seek views on the preliminary environmental information 
presented about the Project as well as on other key elements of the 
Project: 
o The Power Generation Plant, as currently proposed, including 
changes since the 2014 consultation;  
Consultation Report 
Abergelli Power Project 
 
 
181 
 
o The proposed route option(s) for the new section of Access 
Road;

Statutory Consultation on the Phase 2 2018 SoCC 
8.4.17 
Pursuant to S47 of the PA 2008, the draft 2018 SoCC and 2018 SoCC Notice 
(Appendix 9.A) were issued to CCS for statutory consultation on 8th 
Consultation Report 
Abergelli Power Project 
 
 
182 
 
November 2017 (Stage 47, Table 5-2) via email, together with a summary 
note of 2014 consultation activities, a draft list of community organisations 
representing “hard to reach” groups to be contacted, and a draft list of 
consultation documents to be provided in Welsh language.  APL requested 
comments within the deadline of 28 days beginning with the day after the day 
on which the documents were received. 
8.4.18 
A formal response was received from CCS (Appendix 9.A.VII) on 1st 
December 2017 (Stage 48, Table 5-2).  In its response, CCS welcomed the 
proposed approach to public consultation, but requested clarity regarding the 
format of documents being placed at prescribed locations and which 
documents would also be published in Welsh.  It was recommended that 
additional clarity was provided regarding the reduction in stack height and the 
operation as a ‘peaking plant’.  It was also noted that in addition to those 
already listed in the draft 2018 SoCC (Appendix 9.A), the CCZ also includes 
the communities of Pendery, Llwchwr and Grovesend and Waungron. 
8.4.19 
CCS also advised that the draft 2018 SoCC Notice (Appendix 9.A) was 
concise and covered the pertinent information. 
8.4.20 
APL revised and updated the 2018 SoCC and 2018 SoCC Notice in response 
to the comments made by CCS, to provide further clarity regarding the 
Project, document formats (as hard or electronic copies), which consultation 
documents would be provided in Welsh and the CCZ as requested.  APL 
responded to CCS with a table indicating how comments had been addressed 
(see Appendix 9.A.VIII). 
Publication of the Phase 2 2018 SoCC Notice and 2018 SoCC  
8.4.21 
The final 2018 SoCC Notice was published in both English (Appendix 9.B.I) 
and Welsh (Appendix 9.B.II) in the South Wales Evening Post for two 
consecutive weeks on 2nd January 2018 (Appendix 9.B.III) and 9th January 
2018 (Appendix 9.B.IV) (Stage 52, Table 5-2), as listed in Table 8-3, in 
accordance with S47 of the PA 2008.  The published 2018 SoCC Notice 
(Appendices 9.B.III and 9.B.IV) provided details of where the 2018 SoCC 
(Appendix 9.B.I and 9.B.II) itself could be inspected, as well as the dates of 
consultation, exhibition details, availability of consultation materials and 
contact details for APL.

Phase 2 S47 Consultation 
8.4.23 
APL undertook Phase 2 statutory S47 consultation with the local community 
(Stage 60, 66 & 68, Table 5-2) in accordance with the published 2018 SoCC 
(Appendix 9.B), as demonstrated in the 2018 SoCC Compliance Checklist 
(Appendix 9.C). 
8.4.24 
The statutory Phase 2 S47 consultation commenced on 16th January 2018 
(Stage 60, Table 5-2) and closed on 19th February 2018 (Stage 68, Table 5-
2), representing a total duration of 35 days, in excess of the statutory 
minimum requirement of 28 days. 
8.4.25 
The aim of this period of consultation was to seek the views of the local 
community on the preliminary environmental information presented about the 
Project as well as on other key elements of the Project: 
 The Power Generation Plant, as currently proposed, including 
changes since the 2014 consultation;  
 The proposed route option(s) for the new section of Access Road; 
 The indicative layout of the Power Generation Plant within the Project 
Site; and 
 The preliminary findings of the assessment as to the likely significant 
environmental effects of the Project; 
Public Exhibitions 
8.4.26 
As set out in the 2018 SoCC (Appendix 9.B), statutory Phase 2 S47 
consultation with the local community included four public exhibitions in 
Llangyfelach, Felindre, Clydach and Tircoed between 7th February and 10th 
February 2018 (Stage 66, Table 5-2). 
8.4.27 
APL chose the same four exhibition venues as per the Phase 1 consultation 
due to their proximity to the Project Site and to give local people the maximum 
opportunity to attend.  Each exhibition venue met Disability Discrimination Act 
1995 requirements and, upon a reasonable and timely request, had 
provisions in place for those with special requirements seeking to attend the 
exhibition. 
8.4.28 
Table 8-5 sets out the dates, locations and times of the statutory Phase 2 S47 
public exhibitions held within the CCZ:

8.4.31 
A separate exhibition feedback form (available in English and Welsh) 
(Appendix 9.E.IV and 9.E.V) was available for attendees to complete at the 
exhibition.  The feedback form requested responses to the following 
questions: 
 How did you hear about this exhibition? 
 Did you comment during either of the two previous phases of 
consultation in 2014? 
 Abergelli Power is committed to ensuring that the Project will bring 
broader benefits to the community, for example through the 
development of skills and training.  APL will work with City and County 
of Swansea to establish the most effective means to deliver such 
benefits and we’d like to know what you see as priorities in supporting 
the local community? 
 We have since taken into account further information and prepared an 
updated Preliminary Environmental Information Report that identifies 
potential benefits and impacts.  Do you have any comments on our 
preliminary findings? 
 If you have comments about the Project (in particular the proposed 
route option(s) for accessing the Project and the indicative layout of 
the power generation plant), or any other information we should be 
aware of, please share below. 
 How do you feel about this proposal to build the Project? 
8.4.32

Advertising and Publicity 
8.4.35 
The public exhibitions held during the Phase 2 statutory consultation (Stage 
66, Table 5-2) were advertised to the local community and stakeholders via 
a number of different means (Stage 57, Table 5-2). 
8.4.36 
Prior to the first exhibition (Stage 66, Table 5-2), a leaflet (in English and 
Welsh) (Appendix 9.D.I) inviting attendance at the public exhibitions was 
delivered to households, businesses and institutions in the CCZ. 
8.4.37 
The leaflets (in English and Welsh) (Appendix 9.D.I) provided information to 
exhibition attendees structured under the following headings: 
 The Project; 
 Why Abergelli Farm? 
 Principal Elements of the Project; 
 Planning and Public Consultation; 
 Project Elements Plan; 
 The Need for Gas Generation; 
 Community Benefits; 
 Environment; 
 Your Views 
 More Information Available 
 Exhibitions in the Local Area; and 
 How to Get in Touch

8.4.38 
The leaflets (in English and Welsh) (Appendix 9.D.I) advised that the 2018 
PEIR and 2018 PEIR NTS (Appendices 9.H.I and 9.H.II) had been produced 
and were available at the Project website, www.abergellipower.co.uk, and at 
local libraries.  A section of the leaflet (Appendix 9.D.I) included a response 
form available for attendees to complete return via Freepost to APL.  Copies 
of the leaflet were also available at the exhibitions for attendees to complete 
the leaflet response form.  The leaflet response form requested responses to 
the following comments:

the Project in 2014.  We have since taken into account further 
information and prepared a PEIR that identifies potential benefits and 
impact.  Do you have any comments on our findings? 
 If you have any comments about the Project (in particular the proposed 
route option(s) for accessing the Project and the indicative layout of 
the power generation plant), or any other information we should be 
aware of, please share below. 
 How do you feel about this proposal to build the Project?: Support, 
Neutral, Opposed or Undecided. 
8.4.39 
The leaflets (in English and Welsh) (Appendix 9.D.I) were also sent to those 
groups that are defined as “hard to reach” (e.g. the elderly, young and minority 
groups).  A list of the ‘hard to reach’ groups is contained with Appendix 
9.D.VII.  In order to identify “hard to reach” groups, APL contacted CCS as 
part of the statutory consultation on the draft 2018 SoCC (Appendix 9.A), to 
confirm the information and contact details from the list of ‘hard to reach’ 
groups at Phase 1 consultation.  CCS responded on 1st December 2017 to 
recommend two further ‘hard to reach’ groups to consult (Stage 48, Table 5-
2).  Members of the APL project team reviewed the list supplied by CCS for 
appropriateness ahead of contacting them. 
8.4.40 
On 9th January 2018, letters (in English and Welsh) (Appendix 9.D.II and 
9.D.III) were sent to MEPs, AMs, MPs, local councillors and Community 
Councils providing an update on the Project and inviting attendance at the 
first exhibition prior to the event being opened to the general public (Stage 
56, Table 5-2).  A list of the MEPs, AMs, MPs, local councillors and 
Community Councils to whom a letter was sent is included within Appendix 
9.D.IV. 
8.4.41 
Letters (in English and Welsh) (Appendix 9.D.VIII) enclosing posters in 
English and Welsh (Appendix 9.D.X) advertising the consultation events were 
also sent out by APL to be displayed at community venues within the CCZ 
prior to the exhibitions, for example local shops, post offices and doctors’ 
surgeries (Stage 57, Table 5-2).  A list of the locations that were sent a poster 
by APL is contained within Appendix 9.D.XI.  
8.4.42 
The leaflet (available in English and Welsh) (Appendix 9.D.I), 2018 SoCC 
(available in English and Welsh) (Appendix 9.B), 2018 PEIR, and 2018 PEIR 
NTS (available in English and Welsh) (Appendix 9.B.I and 9.B.II) were 
Consultation Report

available for inspection at CCS offices and libraries within the CCZ and OCZ 
throughout the Phase 2 statutory consultation.  The leaflet (Appendix 9.D.I) 
provided background details of the Project and details of the consultation 
process, including how individuals could get involved.  
8.4.43 
APL placed adverts (in English and Welsh) in the South Wales Evening Post 
local newspaper, published on 17th January 2018, giving prior notice of the 
exhibitions (Stage 57, Table 5-2) (Appendix 9.D.XII). 
8.4.44 
In addition, the project website (www.abergellipower.co.uk) was updated by 
APL to provide links to the 2018 PEIR, including figures and Appendices, 
2018 PEIR NTS (Appendices 9.H.I and 9.H.II) and 2018 SoCC (Appendices 
9.B.I and 9.B.II), as well as to provide background information on the Project 
and the planning and consultation process. 
8.4.45 
APL’s contact details (website address, email address, postal address and 
phone number) were also included within the exhibition leaflet (Appendix 
9.D.I), feedback form (Appendix 9.H) and 2018 SoCC (Appendix 9.B) in order 
to allow members of the local community to contact the project team via 
different methods to provide additional feedback or queries during the Phase 
2 statutory consultation. 
Stakeholder Preview Event 
8.4.46 
In advance of the public exhibitions, APL held a stakeholder preview event to 
provide CCS officers, members and local politicians with the opportunity to 
preview the consultation materials displayed at the public exhibition and 
discuss the Project with APL. 
8.4.47 
The stakeholder preview event was held on Wednesday 7th February 2018, 
2.30pm – 3.30pm, at Llangyfelach Church Hall, Swansea Road, Llangyfelach, 
Swansea SA5 7JA, prior to the opening of the first public exhibition (Stage 
66, Table 5-2). 
8.4.48 
As explained above, invitations to attend the stakeholder preview event were 
issued on 9th January 2018 (Stage 56, Table 5-2), at the commencement of 
Phase 2 statutory consultation, to local AMs, local MPs, Community Councils, 
local ward members, Cabinet members and politicians.  A full list of the 
invitees to the stakeholder preview event is contained at Appendix 9.D.IV. 
Phase 2 S48 Publicity 
8.4.49 
As required by S48 of the PA 2008 and Regulation 4 of the APFP Regulations, 
a notice publicising the Project was published once in the London Gazette

Phase 2 Regulation 11 Notification 
8.4.52 
As noted in chapter 6 above, under Regulation 11 of the EIA Regulations, 
APL was required to send a copy of its Phase 2 S48 notice to the consultation 
bodies (as defined in the EIA Regulations) and to any person notified to the 
applicant in accordance with regulation 9(1)(c) of the EIA Regulations, at the 
same time as publishing its Phase 2 S48 notice.  
Consultation Report 
Abergelli Power Project 
 
 
192 
 
8.4.53 
Accordingly, APL sent a copy of the Phase 2 S48 notice (in English and 
Welsh) (Appendix 9.F) on 2nd January 2018 (Stage 54, Table 5-2).  The copy 
of the S48 notice was accompanied by a covering letter (Appendix 9.F.VII) 
which stated APL's intention to apply to the SoS for a DCO under S37 of the 
PA 2008.  The covering letter (Appendix 9.F.VII) also explained that, under 
S48 of the PA 2008, APL would be publishing a notice of the proposed 
Application in the London Gazette, The Times and the South Wales Evening 
Post.  The covering letter (Appendix 9.F.VII) was issued in English with a copy 
in Welsh available on request.  
Phase 2 S42 Consultation 
8.4.54 
As noted in chapter 6 above, under S42 of the PA 2008, bodies prescribed 
by Schedule 1 of the APFP Regulations must be consulted about the 
proposed application (the ‘prescribed bodies’).  In addition, Schedule 1 of the 
APFP Regulations sets out the circumstances when consultees must be 
consulted and notified about an application.  Accordingly, Phase 2 statutory 
S42 consultation comprised consultation with the following: 
 S42(1)(a) – Prescribed Persons; 
 S42(1)(b) – Local Authorities; and 
 S42(1)(d) – Land Interests 
8.4.55 
As per Phase 1 consultation, there are no S42(1)(c) parties as this category 
applies to the Greater London Authority. 
8.4.56 
APL undertook statutory S42 consultation with prescribed consultees as part 
of the Phase 2 statutory consultation on the Project.  Pursuant to S45 of the 
PA 2008 – which requires that the deadline for S42 consultation responses is 
no less than 28 days after receipt of the consultation documents – the Phase 
2 statutory S42 consultation commenced on 16th January 2018 (Stage 60, 
Table 5-2) and closed on 19th February 2018 (Stage 68, Table 5-2), 
representing a total duration of 35 days, in excess of the statutory minimum 
requirement of 28 days. 
S42(1)(a) – Prescribed Persons 
8.4.57 
‘Prescribed persons’, for the purposes of S42(1)(a), are defined in Schedule 
1 of the APFP Regulations, which provides the circumstances when that 
person must be consulted or notified about an application.   
8.4.58 
In order to identify the prescribed persons required to be consulted on the 
Project, APL reviewed the guidance contained within Schedule 1 of the APFP 
Regulations, as well as the list of consultees notified of the proposed 
application by PINS in 2014 under Regulation 9(1)(a) of the EIA Regulations.  
The 2014 Regulation 9 list was refreshed and updated (Appendix 8.B) during 
Phase 2 non-statutory consultation in November 2017, in order to ensure that 
Consultation Report 
Abergelli Power Project 
 
 
193 
 
accurate contact details were collated for all consultees prior to the 
commencement of Phase 2 statutory consultation. 
8.4.59 
As outlined in section 6.4, the prescribed consultees included a number of 
Community Councils and Town Councils, based on PINS’ 2014 notification.  
In addition to those consulted during Phase 1 consultation (illustrated in 
Figure 6-3), further to CCS’s response to the 2018 SoCC (Stage 48, Table 5-
2) (Appendix 9.A.VII), Llwchwr Town Council and Grovesend and Waungron 
Community Council were also identified as prescribed consultees for the 
purposes of Phase 2 statutory consultation. 
8.4.60 
The full list of prescribed persons consulted and notified during Phase 2 
consultation under S42(1)(a) of the PA 2008 is provided in Appendix 9.G.I.  
S42(1)(b) – Local Authorities 
8.4.61 
As outlined in section 6.4 above, in accordance with S43 of the PA 2008, CCS 
is a Category B local authority for the purposes of statutory S42(1)(b) 
consultation, as the Project Site is wholly located within the jurisdiction of 
CCS.  Carmarthenshire County Council and Neath Port Talbot County 
Borough Council are Category A local authorities for the purposes of statutory 
S42(1)(b) consultation, as these local authorities are adjacent to CCS (Figure 
6-4).  Accordingly, CCS, Carmarthenshire County Council and Neath Port 
Talbot County Borough Council were consulted and notified during Phase 2 
consultation under S42(1)(b) of the PA 2008. 
S42(1)(d) – Land Interests 
8.4.62 
‘Land interests’, for the purposes of S42(1)(d), are defined under S44 of the 
PA 2008, as explained in section 6.4.   
8.4.63 
As per Phase 1 consultation, consultees with land interests were identified by 
APL through a series of checks.  This included examination of Land Registry 
plans, site visits and diligent enquiry through meetings and engagement. 
8.4.64 
The list of land interests consulted and notified during Phase 2 consultation 
under S42(1)(d) of the PA 2008 is provided in Appendix 9.G.I.  
S42 Consultation 
S42 Consultation Materials 
8.4.65 
APL issued consultation materials to prescribed consultees under S42 of the 
PA 2008 on 8th and 9th January 2018 (Stage 55, Table 5-2), prior to the 
commencement of Phase 2 statutory consultation.   
8.4.66 
The consultation materials issued to all prescribed consultees (except CCS 
and NRW) comprised:

 A paper copy of a S42 covering letter (English and Welsh) (Appendix 
9.G.II and 9.G.III); 
 A paper copy of the 2018 PEIR NTS (English) (Appendix 9.H.I); 
 A CD containing an electronic copy of:  
o 2018 PEIR (including Figures and Appendices);  
o No Significant Effects Report (Appendix 9.H.III); 
o Welsh language version of the 2018 PEIR NTS (Appendix 
9.H.II); and   
 A paper copy of the S47 consultation leaflet (Appendix 9.D.I). 
8.4.67 
In addition to the above, CCS and NRW were issued with a paper copy of the 
2018 PEIR in response to a prior request.  A separate covering letter (in 
English and Welsh) was issued to CCS and NRW addressing this (Appendix 
9.G.IV and 9.G.V). 
8.4.68 
Prescribed consultees were notified within the S42 covering letter (Appendix 
9.G.II and 9.G.III) that the 2018 PEIR and 2018 PEIR NTS (Appendix 9.H.I 
and 9.H.II) would also be available from 16th January 2018 until 19th February 
2018 on the Project website (www.abergellipower.co.uk) and at the following 
locations: Swansea Central Library, Clydach Library, Gorseinon Library, 
Morriston Library, and Pontarddulais Library).  Prescribed consultees were 
also notified that additional copies of the consultation documents, or of other 
individual documents, would be available if requested.   
8.4.69 
The S42 covering letter provided an introduction to the project, details of the 
project elements, an overview of the need for gas generation, environmental 
information, details of the options for the project and details of the consultation 
process and how to respond.  Responses were requested by the close of the 
Phase 2 statutory S42 consultation at 5pm on 19th February 2018 (Stage 68, 
Table 5-2), via the following communication methods: 
 Website: www.abergellipower.co.uk;

Delivery of Phase 2 S42 Consultation Materials 
8.4.70 
All S42 consultation packs were sent by Royal Mail First Class Recorded 
Delivery on 8th and 9th January 2018 (Stage 55, Table 5-2) to allow for proof 
of delivery to be monitored and recorded.  
Consultation Report 
Abergelli Power Project

8.4.71 
The majority of S42 consultation packs (with the exception of 7 consultation 
packs) were signed for between 9th and 12th January 2018 prior to the 
commencement of Phase 2 statutory consultation.   
8.4.72 
Following the original failed delivery, the address of 1 of the 7 outstanding 
consultation packs was clarified and successfully re-delivered on 16th January 
2018.  4 of the 7 outstanding consultation packs could not be delivered by 
Royal Mail initially, however these were successfully redelivered and signed 
for on 17th January 2018.  The remaining 2 of the 7 outstanding consultation 
packs were hand-delivered to a neighbour of the relevant prescribed 
consultee on 19th January, with subsequent receipt of the pack confirmed by 
the prescribed consultee. 
8.4.73 
As such, all consultees received the consultation packs with an excess of 28-
days of the statutory consultation period remaining to respond. 
Identification of additional interests following commencement of Phase 2 
statutory consultation 
8.4.74 
Following further diligent enquiry, four additional landowners were identified 
as prescribed consultees after the commencement of Phase 2 statutory 
consultation.  Accordingly, additional packs of S42 consultation materials (as 
listed above) were sent by Royal Mail First Class Recorded Delivery on 22nd 
January 2018 (Stage 63, Table 5-2).  The S42 cover letter issued to the four 
additional prescribed consultees extended the timeframe for responding to 
5pm on 27th February 2018 (Stage 70, Table 5-2), to ensure these consultees 
were allowed sufficient response time beyond the statutory requirements.  All 
4 additional consultation packs were signed for on 24th January 2018. 
Issue of Replacement Figure 8.3 of 2018 PEIR 
8.4.75 
Following the commencement of statutory consultation, APL identified an 
error in Figure 8.3 “Designated Sites 2” from the 2018 PEIR (Volume II: 
Figures and Photomontages).  This comprised an incorrect numbering of 
ancient woodlands which did not therefore correlate with chapter 8 of the 
2018 PEIR. 
8.4.76 
Accordingly, a replacement Figure 8.3 was issued to all prescribed 
consultees, together with an explanatory covering letter, on 30th January 2018 
(Stage 64, Table 5-2), following the commencement of statutory consultation.  
The covering letter explained that the text in chapter 8 of the 2018 PEIR, as 
well as all other information previously issued, was unchanged and not 
affected by this amendment. 
8.4.77 
The covering letter also explained that the amendment did not affect the 
statutory consultation period running from 16th January 2018 (Stage 60, Table 
5-2) until 19th February 2018 (Stage 68, Table 5-2).

8.4.78 
APL consulted CCS regarding its proposed approach to addressing the issue, 
prior to publication and distribution of the replacement Figure 8.3.  CCS 
advised on 29th January 2018 that the proposed approach was acceptable.  
8.4.79 
The covering letter and replacement Figure were sent by Royal Mail Special 
Delivery on 30th January 2018 to allow for proof of delivery to be monitored 
and recorded.  The majority of letters and replacement Figures were signed 
for 31st January 2018 or 1st February 2018, with all letters and replacement 
Figures signed for by 8th February 2018.  A separate covering letter and 
replacement Figure were hand-delivered to libraries on 30th January to insert 
within the 2018 PEIR. 
Identification of additional interests following Phase 2 statutory consultation 
8.4.80 
Following the end of Phase 2 statutory consultation an additional party with a 
land interest was identified who was not consulted during Phase 2.  HSBC 
Bank Plc was identified as having an interest as a mortgagee in plots 13, 13A, 
13B, 14 and 15 on 18 May 2018.  HSBC was consulted during the Phase 1 
statutory consultation and no response was received by APL, but in error was 
omitted from the Phase 2 consultation.  APL has written to HSBC Bank plc to 
make them aware of the latest consultation on the Project and the intended 
submission of the Application, and has sent a copy of the section 42 materials 
that other consultees received in January 2018, inviting any comments (Stage 
75, Table 5-2).  The letter (a copy of which is enclosed at Appendix 9.G.XII) 
explained to HSBC that, should the Application be accepted, they will be sent 
notice under s56 and will have the opportunity to make representations and 
take part in the examination should they so wish.   
8.4.81 
APL does not consider that the omission of HSBC Bank Plc from the Phase 
2 statutory consultation will cause prejudice to the interests of HSBC Bank 
Plc. APL made HSBC Bank Plc aware of the proposed Application in 2014, 
and sent the Phase 2 information at the earliest opportunity once the omission 
was discovered.  APL also undertook consultation / notification pursuant to 
section 48, and notices were published in the Gazette and in the Times.  In 
addition, APL consulted the freeholder and mortgagor, Mr Michael Edwards, 
and is in ongoing discussions with Mr Edwards in relation to an agreement in 
relation to the land rights sought, to which HSBC Bank Plc will need to be 
party or otherwise consent to its terms. 
Phase 2 S46 Notification 
8.4.82 
As noted in chapter 6 above, under S46 of the PA 2008, APL was required to 
notify the SoS of the proposed application by providing S42 consultation 
information prior to the commencement of S42 consultation.   
8.4.83 
In accordance with S46 of the PA 2008, APL issued a hard copy of the S42 
consultation information to PINS on 9th January 2018, across the same time 
as the issue of S42 consultation packs (and with an electronic copy issued 
via email on 10th January 2018 (Appendix 9.I.I)) (Stage 58, Table 5-2) prior to 
the commencement of Phase 2 statutory S42 consultation  on 16th January 
Consultation Report 
Abergelli Power Project 
 
 
197 
 
2018 (Stage 60, Table 5-2).  The S42 consultation information issued to PINS 
consisted of the same information issued to S42 prescribed consultees, 
comprising the S42 covering letter (Appendix 9.G.II and 9.G.III), consultation 
leaflet (Appendix 9.D.I), No Significant Effects report (Appendix 9.H.III), 2018 
PEIR, 2018 PEIR NTS (in English and Welsh) (Appendix 9.H.I and 9.H.II). 
8.4.84 
A formal acknowledgement of the S46 notification was issued by PINS on 
15th January 2018 (Appendix 9.I.II) confirming receipt of the S42 consultation 
information. 
8.4.85 
Following identification of an error in Figure 8.3 “Designated Sites 2” from the 
2018 PEIR, as noted above, a further S46 notification was issued to PINS on 
29th January 2018 (in electronic and hard copy formats) (Stage 58, Table 5-
2), comprising a S46 notification letter, a copy of the replacement Figure 8.3 
and an accompanying covering letter sent to section 42 consultees (Appendix 
9.I.III).   
8.4.86 
PINS acknowledged the issue of additional information via email on 29th 
January 2018 (Appendix 9.I.IV). 
Media Coverage regarding Phase 2 statutory consultation 
8.4.87 
The Project was subject to media coverage regarding the Phase 2 statutory 
consultation.   
8.4.88 
On 2nd January 2018 (Appendix 9.J.I), Wales Online published an article titled 
‘New £100m gas-fired power station in Swansea could generate power for 
150,000 homes’, reporting the Project and previous consultation and 
publicising the Phase 2 consultation.  The article quoted comments from 
Drax: “As a result of what was learned during the consultation undertaken in 
2014 and other studies, we have made a number of changes to the original 
proposals. For example, the cable for the electrical connection has been put 
underground instead of having an overhead line; we have selected an access 
route from the B4489 to the west of the site, and reduced the number of stacks 
from five to one. We are looking forward to sharing our latest plans at the 
public exhibitions next month and hearing what local people think about them 
before we finalise the scheme and submit a Development Consent Order 
application.” 
8.4.89 
On 2nd January 2018 (Appendix 9.J.II), BBC News also published a similar 
article to Wales Online, reporting the Project, the previous consultation 
undertaken and the Phase 2 statutory consultation. 
8.4.90 
On 22nd January 2018, APL held an interview with The Wave radio station to 
discuss the Project, consultation process, programme and addressing 
potential impacts.  On 23rd January 2018, Swansea Sound radio station 
subsequently broadcasted the interview with APL. 
8.4.91 
On 24th January 2018 (Appendix 9.J.III), a local MP published an article on 
their website titled, ‘The Community must be heard over the proposed 
Consultation Report 
Abergelli Power Project 
 
 
198 
 
Abergelli Power Plant’.  The article sought to encourage residents to contact 
the local MP or county councillors to share views on the Project.  The article 
also publicised the Phase 2 statutory public exhibitions.  
8.5 
Phase 2 Non-Statutory Consultation (January 2018 – February 2018)

Summary of Phase 2 Consultation Feedback 
9.1 
Introduction 
9.1.1 
This chapter explains the non-statutory and statutory consultation responses 
received during the Phase 2 Consultation.  
9.1.2 
Throughout the non-statutory and statutory Phase 2 Consultation, APL has 
gathered feedback on the Project from consultees via correspondence, 
meetings and feedback forms. As explained at chapter 5, APL has sought to 
maximise consultee involvement in the consultation processes, such that the 
comments received are representative.  
9.1.3 
For consistency, feedback received from the Phase 2 consultation has been 
analysed according to the themes used in the analysis of the Phase 1 
consultation responses since the Phase 2 consultation did not raise any new 
themes. Again, where a comment covers more than one theme, this has been 
accounted for. The detailed content of the comments received is discussed 
in this chapter where relevant.  
9.1.4 
Chapter 10 of this Consultation Report summarises how comments received 
during Phase 1 and Phase 2 of the consultation have resulted in changes to 
the Project.  
9.1.5 
The approach taken in reporting on consultation feedback is considered to be 
consistent with PINS Advice note 14 which advocates adopting differing 
approaches to reporting the consultation responses, depending on the nature 
of consultation and the volume of responses. APL has adopted an issue-led 
approach to analysing responses. Appendices 11.A, 11.B and 11.C 
respectively group the S42 and S47 responses received during the Phase 2 
statutory consultation and set out APL’s response.    
9.2 
Feedback from Phase 2 Non-Statutory Consultation (April 2017 – 
January 2018) prior to Phase 2 Statutory Consultation 
9.2.1 
APL undertook non-statutory consultation with PINS, CCS, locally elected 
representatives and other interested parties via a number of briefing meetings 
and discussions during Phase 2 consultation.  A summary of the feedback 
received during non-statutory discussions, prior to the commencement of 
Phase 2 statutory consultation, is set out below (also see Appendix 7, 9.K 
and 10.A). 
9.2.2 
On 30th March 2017 (Stage 41, Table 5-2), following previous 
correspondence during Phase 1 consultation, a meeting was held with PINS 
to discuss Project updates, the potential for outreach events, the Project Site, 
compulsory acquisition, the proposed consultation programme and future 
review of draft documents.  Table 9-1 provides a summary of the feedback 
received (minutes contained in Appendix 7.A.I).

of the Project relaunch.   
9.2.4 
On 20th August 2017 (Stage 43, Table 5-2), APL received queries from a local 
MP requesting detailed plans of the Project location.   
9.2.5 
On 28th September 2017 (Stage 44, Table 5-2), APL held a follow-up meeting 
with PINS, further to the earlier meeting on 30th March 2017 (Stage 41, Table 
5-2), to discuss general Project updates, consultation, review of draft 
documents and publication of Welsh documents.  Table 9-2 provides a

9.2.6 
On 3rd October 2017 (Stage 45, Table 5-2), APL held a meeting with CCS 
further to the initial update call of 19th April 2017 (Stage 42, Table 5-2).  CCS 
advised that the LDP had been accepted for examination in August 2017 and 
suggested that APL has regard in the EIA to the strategic transport 
assessment accompanying the LDP as well as the Wellbeing of Future 
Generations (Wales) Act 2015. CCS also recommended consulting ward 
councillors in Llangyfelach (minutes contained in Appendix 7.A.III). 
9.2.7 
On 3rd October 2017 (Stage 45, Table 5-2), APL issued a Project briefing note 
to NRW (Appendix 7.A.IV) seeking to agree forthcoming engagement on 
ecology, flood risk, ground conditions and water quality & resources.  On 9th 
October 2017 (Stage 45, Table 5-2), APL contacted CCS and NRW to request 
comments on the flood consequences assessment, water resources and 
drainage assessment.  A follow-up call was held with NRW on 17th October 
2017 (Stage 45, Table 5-2) to provide updates to the Project and discuss 
issues regarding flood risk, drainage and ecology.  In response to the request 
of 9th October 2017 (Stage 45, Table 5-2), CCS and NRW provided comments 
regarding flood risk and drainage on 10th October 2017 and 7th November 
2017 (Stage 45, Table 5-2) respectively and a site visit was held on 8th 
November 2017. Table 9-4 provides a summary of the feedback received.

the site boundary would not 
be supported however 
diversion may be an option 
Any works such as 
culverting on the main 
river will require a Flood 
Risk Activity Permit from 
NRW. CCS will deal with 
any requirements for 
culverting or alterations to 
an ordinary watercourse 
Availability of 
existing data 
There is no flood risk data 
available for the 
watercourses crossing the 
site 
All relevant information 
will be supplied as part of 
the Information Request.  
No additional knowledge 
of any flood history. 
 
9.2.8 
On 16th October (Stage 45, Table 5-2), APL contacted CCS to discuss 
ecology considerations associated with the Project.  CCS queried the amount 
of survey information on breeding birds and bat activity but welcomed a full 
analysis and consideration of potential impacts within the ES. 
9.2.9 
On 20th October (Stage 45, Table 5-2), APL contacted CCS to confirm the 
draft list of committed developments for consideration within the EIA 
cumulative assessment.  CCS responded on 23rd October agreeing to the 
draft list and providing additional information on several committed 
developments. 
9.2.10

Summary of S47 Feedback from Public Exhibition and Leaflets 
9.4.19 
This section provides an overall summary of the Phase 2 S47 feedback 
received at the public exhibitions and from returned leaflets. 
9.4.20 
Overall, the majority of S47 respondents had not commented previously 
during the Phase 1 S47 consultation.  Of the total 84 respondents, only 19 
had commented in the Phase 1 S47 consultation.  
9.4.21 
A number of respondents expressed a concern for increases in traffic and the 
potential impacts on local road safety and infrastructure. Several comments 
noted the Project provides the opportunity to develop a link road to Morriston 
Hospital to alleviate congestion (see Appendix 11.A). 
9.4.22 
Some respondents highlighted the landscape and visual impact of the Project 
as a concern, as the 45m stack would ‘create an eyesore’ and impact 
negatively upon the landscape. Several respondents considered the Project 
would blend in with the environment and provide less of a visual impact than 
other energy infrastructure (see Appendix 11.A).  
9.4.23 
Some respondents expressed concerns regarding air quality and the potential 
for prevailing winds to carry emissions towards Morriston Hospital. In addition, 
several respondents were concerned with the impact of air pollution on local 
residents and requested further information on the monitoring of emissions 
(see Appendix 11.A).  
Consultation Report 
Abergelli Power Project

9.4.24 
Some respondents suggested that the Project should provide further 
community benefits by supporting education, skills development and local job 
opportunities. Several respondents raised concerns that the long-term 
benefits would be insufficient (see Appendix 11.A). 
9.4.25 
Overall, 31% of all Phase 2 S47 respondents were supportive of the Project. 
40% of respondents were opposed to the Project, 15% neutral and 14% 
undecided.  
Phase 2 S48 Publicity 
9.4.26 
APL did not receive any consultation responses that identified themselves as 
responding to S48 publicity (Appendix 9.F) although it is likely that S48 
publicity (Appendix 9.F) will have had an influence on some consultees in 
accessing S42 / S47 consultation materials. 
Phase 2 S42 Consultation 
9.4.27 
APL undertook statutory Phase 2 S42 consultation with prescribed 
consultees, commencing on 16th January 2018 (Stage 60, Table 5-2) and 
closing on 19th February 2018 (Stage 68, Table 5-2).  Following ongoing 
diligent enquiry (as explained at section 8.4 above), four additional land 
interests were identified.  APL subsequently undertook additional Phase 2 
S42 consultation with additional land interests between 22nd January 2018 
(Stage 63, Table 5-2) and 27th February 2018 (Stage 70, Table 5-2). 
9.4.28 
In accordance with S42 of the PA 2008, statutory Phase 2 S42 consultation 
comprised consultation with the following: 
 S42(1)(a) – Prescribed Persons; 
 S42(1)(b) – Local Authorities; 
 S42(1)(d) – Land Interests 
9.4.29 
A total of 32 prescribed consultees responded to the Phase 2 S42 
consultation.  Table 9-6 illustrates the number of responses in respect of 
S42(1)(a), S42(1)(b) and S42(1)(d) (Appendix 11.B).  Respondents classified 
as S42(1)(a) and 42(1)(d) consultees have been counted separately.

residential sites would not be an issue; 
 Requested that the Applicant works with CCS to promote local supply 
chain opportunities; and 
 Requested to be kept updated on the Project, particularly regarding 
the construction programme. 
9.5.3 
On 24th January 2018 (Stage 62, Table 5-2), APL received feedback from a 
local MP declining attendance at the stakeholder information event, and 
stressing the importance of investing in renewable energy resources rather 
than reliance on fossil fuels. 
9.5.4 
On 30th January 2018 (Stage 65, Table 5-2), APL met with Mawr Community 
Council to provide information on the Project during Phase 2 statutory 
consultation (minutes contained in Appendix 9.K.I).  The Community Council 
raised a number of queries and made comments regarding: 
 Stack and emissions – queried how the number of stacks could be 
reduced to one; 
 Socio-economics – queried whether there is evidence to suggest that 
similar projects affect house prices; 
 Decommissioning – queried whether the land would be reinstated or 
used for alternative uses upon decommissioning; 
 Power Generation Plant – the viability of a ‘part-time’ plant was 
queried; 
 Project Site – the size and ownership of the site was queried; 
 Local impacts – it was queried whether the Project would affect 
allocated housing land in Llangyfelach;

Abergelli Power Project 
 
 
215 
 
 Access – it was queried whether the access road would need to be 
upgraded; 
 Community Benefit Fund – councillors emphasised that the Project 
should provide community benefits, for example improvements to 
roads, village hall, play facilities and the school. 
9.5.5 
On 8th February 2018 (Stage 63, Table 5-2), APL met with Llangyfelach 
Community Council to provide information on the Project during Phase 2 
statutory consultation (minutes contained in Appendix 9.K.II).  The 
Community Council raised a number of queries and made comments 
regarding: 
 Consultation – the status of the current application and consultation 
was queried; 
 Stack and emissions – concerns were raised about the height of the 
stack, as well as air quality, topography and emissions 
 Power station – the hours of operation were queried; 
 Other environmental effects – concerns were raised regarding the 
potential construction impacts relating to noise and traffic; 
 Flight path – it was queried whether the air ambulance or flight path 
would be affected; 
 Piling – councillors emphasised that local farms and railways should 
be considered if piling is to be undertaken; 
 Community benefit fund – councillors suggested that employment 
opportunities are part of the Project and not an additional community 
benefit.  Other direct benefits should be provided such as support to 
the school.

Evolution of the Project in Response to 
Consultation Feedback 
10.1 
Introduction 
10.1.1 
Since the start of consultation in January 2014, the Project has undergone a 
number of significant changes. The pre-application consultation for the 
Project informed several important aspects of the Project, resulting in a 
revised consultation approach, design interventions and mitigation 
commitments.  
10.1.2 
APL has reviewed consultation feedback received during non-statutory and 
statutory consultation, as set out in Appendices 6.A, 6.B and 6.D (Phase 1) 
and Appendices 11.A and 11.C (Phase 2), in accordance with s49 of the PA 
2008, had regard to the comments made.  Where possible, APL has sought 
to refine its proposals in response to the feedback from the consultation 
process. APL has, in other cases, taken account of the responses in the 
preparation of the ES (Document Reference 6.1), the draft Order (Document 
Reference 3.1) and other DCO Application documents. 
10.1.3 
In summary, feedback received during the Phase 1 and Phase 2 consultation 
informed the development of the Project in the following ways:  
 Locations for display of consultation materials amended; 
 Selection of a Gas Connection route corridor, approximately 1.4 km in 
length, running in a southerly direction to the Generating Equipment 
Site; 
 Selection of an underground cable option as opposed to overhead line 
option to export power from the Generating Equipment to the NETS 
(Swansea North Substation); 
 Selection of an Electrical Connection route corridor, approximately 900 
m in length, to the southwest of the Generating Equipment Site; 
 Selection of the Access Route to the Project Site from the B4489 to 
the west of the Generating Equipment Site, including an upgraded 
access road from the B4489 as well as a new section of access road 
from the Swansea North Substation to the Generating Equipment Site; 
and 
 The Power Generation Plant is made up of only one Gas Turbine 
Generator with one exhaust gas flue stack, rather than up to five. 
 Reduction of stack height from a maximum of 60 m to a maximum of 
45 m; 
Consultation Report 
Abergelli Power Project 
 
 
218 
 
 Generating Equipment Site moved north of the Welsh Water Water 
Main;  
 Selection of an Access Road from the Substation to the Generating 
Equipment Site, beginning before the original spur at the car park 
adjacent to the Felindre Gas Compressor Station and extending 
southwards towards open fields; and 
 Realignment of Access Road from the Substation to the Generating 
Equipment Site to curve further south and avoid ancient woodland. 
 
10.1.4 
The remainder of this chapter provides information relating to how the 
feedback and responses received during non-statutory and statutory 
consultation has been considered and influenced the Project, design and 
mitigation.  This chapter also addresses feedback that did not lead to Project 
changes. 
10.2 
Consultation Approach 
SoCC 
10.2.1 
The approach to undertaking consultation with the local community was 
influenced by early discussions with CCS as part of the Phase 1 non-statutory 
consultation.  Following discussions with CCS before the Phase 1 statutory 
consultation began, CCS Council Offices were included as a location for the 
display of appropriate consultation materials and community organisations 
identified as ‘hard to reach’ groups were identified for consultation.  These 
changes were reflected in the final 2014 SoCC (Appendix 4.A) as well as 
being carried through into the final 2018 SoCC (Appendix 9.B).   
10.2.2 
Upon relaunch of the Project in April 2017, subsequent non-statutory 
consultation with CCS informed how APL would consult with the local 
community under S47 of the PA 2008 during Phase 2 consultation.  CCS’ 
feedback informed the explanation of changes in the Project since Phase 1 
consultation and which consultation materials should be provided in both 
English and Welsh.   As a result, APL sought to revise the wording in the 2018 
SoCC (Appendix 9.B) to ensure that it was clear which consultation materials 
would be displayed in various deposit locations, the format that each 
document would be available in (i.e. hard copy or CD) and which languages 
they would be available in. 
Public Exhibitions 
10.2.3 
A number of the comments received during the Phase 1 non-statutory public 
exhibitions focussed on the availability of information, landscape and visual 
impacts; size and location of the Project; pollution and waste impacts; impact 
on house prices; and likely timescales of the Project. 
Consultation Report 
Abergelli Power Project 
 
 
219 
 
10.2.4 
APL recognises that the June 2014 exhibitions were early in the design and 
development process.  As acknowledged by DCLG’s guidance on pre-
application consultation, there is an inherent tension between consulting early 
and providing sufficient information to enable consultees to comment.  APL 
sought to balance the availability of information with its desire to raise early 
awareness and knowledge, and gain local feedback on its outline proposals.  
10.2.5 
Some respondents indicated during the Phase 1 consultation that more 
information was needed on the Project at the non-statutory consultation 
stage.  APL explained that the non-statutory exhibitions and material were 
intended to introduce the Project to the local community and that more 
detailed proposals (and consultation on these) would follow. APL further 
explained that early engagement would enable discussions of aspects of the 
Project at an early stage in the design development process when a number 
of options were still under consideration. Early consultation therefore 
provided opportunities for consultees to influence subsequent design and 
environmental assessment work. Nevertheless, APL recognises that this 
early engagement inevitably meant that there was not as much detailed 
information available as at the statutory consultation phase when more 
refined proposals were put forward for consideration.  
10.2.6 
APL sought to respond to requests for more information during the Phase 1 
statutory consultation by providing more detailed information on the Project 
and environmental impacts as requested, including: 
 Additional exhibition boards;  
 Leaflets, which provided information about the Project, APL, the 
consultation process and the likely timescales of the Project; and 
 Printed copies of the 2014 PEIR and 2014 PEIR NTS (Appendix 4.C), 
which provided an initial assessment of the likely environmental 
impacts of the Project. 
10.2.7 
All written consultation materials were available in different formats upon 
request. 
10.2.8 
The equivalent information was subsequently also provided for the purpose 
of the Phase 2 S47 consultation and exhibitions (Appendix 9.E). 
10.3 
Project Design and Mitigation 
Gas Turbine Generator and Stack 
10.3.1 
For the purposes of the Phase 1 non-statutory consultation the worst case 
maximum stack height was assumed to be 60 m. Between 1 and 5 Gas 
Turbine Generators were proposed due to uncertain market conditions and a 
number of technologies being considered.  As a result of concerns raised 
regarding the visual impact of the stacks, subsequent Phase 1 statutory 
consultation was based on a reduced stack height of up to 40 m.   
Consultation Report 
Abergelli Power Project 
 
 
220 
 
10.3.2 
During Phase 1 statutory consultation, a number of respondents remained 
concerned about the potential visual impact of the Project on the landscape, 
with particular regards to the proposed stack heights. 
10.3.3 
Following consideration of and regard to Phase 1 consultation responses, 
together with greater clarity on the capacity market rules and further 
engagement with equipment manufacturers, it was decided that a single Gas 
Turbine Generator with a single stack of up to 45 m is the most appropriate 
technology solution and design for the Project.   
10.3.4 
These changes were consulted on during Phase 2 consultation and are 
proposed in the Application. 
Landscape and Visual Impact 
10.3.5 
The Landscape and Visual Impact Assessment of the Project was updated 
from the 2014 PEIR (available during Phase 1 statutory consultation) as a 
result of subsequent changes to the Gas Turbine Generator and stack 
following Phase 1 consultation (see above) and feedback received during 
Phase 2 consultation. 
10.3.6 
Furthermore, in response to feedback received from NRW during Phase 2 
non-statutory consultation, an additional two viewpoints (Viewpoint 10 and 
Viewpoint 19) were included within the Landscape and Visual Impact 
Assessment contained within the ES (Document Reference 6.1, chapter 11).   
10.3.7 
Finally, during Phase 2 statutory consultation, following review of the 
photomontages, NRW requested that further information be presented in the 
photomontages, regarding the distance to the Project, horizontal field of view 
and wirelines of viewpoints.  The photomontages were subsequently updated 
to provide the requested information in the Application (see Document 
Reference 7.1). 
Access 
10.3.8 
Two possible access routes to the Project Site were proposed as options for 
consideration during Phase 1 statutory consultation.  Access Road Option 1 
involved taking access from the north via the Rhyd-y-pandy Road and Access 
Road Option 2 involved access from the west via the B4489. 
10.3.9 
Both S47 and S42(1)(d) respondents raised a number of concerns in regard 
to the route options for the Project during Phase 1 consultation, and in 
particular the proposed use of Rhyd-y-pandy Road (Access Road Option 1) 
(Appendices 6.B – 6.D).  Respondents considered that there would be 
potentially adverse impacts in respect of congestion, particularly during 
construction, and in respect of the impact on emergency vehicles to/from 
Morriston Hospital (Appendices 6.B – 6.D).  S42(1)(a) and S42(1)(d) 
respondents also advised that both access options would result in some 
habitat losses to SINCs (Appendices 6.B – 6.D). 
Consultation Report 
Abergelli Power Project 
 
 
221 
 
10.3.10 As a result of feedback received during Phase 1 consultation from S47 and 
S42 prescribed consultees, and further detailed assessment work, the two 
access route options were refined and Access Road Option 2 was chosen as 
the proposed access to be included within the DCO.  Access Road Option 2 
proposes an Access Road from the B4489 to the west of the Generating 
Equipment Site, including an existing road from the B4489 as well as a new 
purpose built extension to the Generating Equipment Site. 
10.3.11 Further investigation and review resulted in the optimisation of the new 
section of access road proposed by Option 2.  As a result, during Phase 2 
statutory consultation, two options were proposed for the purpose built new 
section of the Access Road from the Substation to the Generating Equipment 
Site (Option A and Option B).  Further to Phase 2 consultation, Option B 
(beginning before the original spur at the car park adjacent to the Felindre 
Gas Compressor Station and extending southwards towards open fields) was 
chosen for the new section of the Access Road to take forward for the DCO 
Application. In response to feedback received from CCS and NRW during 
Phase 2 statutory consultation, this route was subsequently updated from the 
route presented in the 2018 PEIR to curve further south and avoid the area 
of ancient woodland (Revised Option B). 
Project Site Layout 
10.3.12 The siting of the Generating Equipment Site has been influenced by the land-
take of the Gas Turbine Generator and stack and the accessibility of the 
Generating Equipment. 
10.3.13 Following Phase 1 consultation and subsequent further investigation, a water 
main was identified crossing the Generating Equipment Site and Laydown 
Area that was presented during Phase 1 consultation.   
10.3.14 Welsh Water advised during Phase 2 non-statutory consultation that typically 
a 30 m buffer (15 m either side of the water main) is required to be kept clear 
of construction activities.  Accordingly, to allow for uncertainty regarding the 
specific location of the water main, a 60 m allowance has been incorporated 
in the configuration of the Generating Equipment. 
10.3.15 It has been determined from an engineering review of the Project that the 
Generating Equipment Site could be contained in one location to the north of 
the gallops instead of being separated by the water main, particularly 
following the reduction in gas turbine units to a single gas turbine unit 
following Phase 1 consultation.  This ensures retention of much of the length 
of the Gallops as a feature, which was recommended by DCfW during Phase 
1 consultation. 
Gas Connection 
10.3.16 At the commencement of Phase 1 non-statutory consultation, two possible 
options (Feeder 28 of the National Gas Transmission System or a nearby 
Local Transmission System pipeline) were presented for connecting the 
Consultation Report 
Abergelli Power Project 
 
 
222 
 
Generating Equipment to a suitable source of fuel gas.  This followed a gas 
connection feasibility study which was undertaken in March 2014 to consider 
the available options. 
10.3.17 Investigations to identify specific route corridor options to the National Gas 
Transmission System or Local Transmission System pipelines were carried 
out and four possible options were presented (within an identified Gas 
Connection Opportunity Area) during Phase 1 non-statutory consultation 
(Options 1-4).  Variations to Option 2 were considered and identified as 
Options 2a and 2b to address constraints of Option 2. 
10.3.18 Following ongoing consultation with National Grid and further due 
consideration, Option 2b was chosen as the preferred route for the Gas 
Connection as it has the lowest risks and avoids ecologically significant 
habitats.  This option was presented during subsequent Phase 2 consultation 
and is proposed in the Application. 
Underground Cable 
10.3.19 At the commencement of Phase 1 non-statutory consultation, two possible 
Electrical Connection options were being considered to export power from the 
Generating Equipment to the NETS: an underground cable or overhead lines.  
However, overhead lines were presented as a ‘worst case’ scenario. 
10.3.20 Feedback received during initial non-statutory consultation with CCS and 
Community Councils queried the Electrical Connection and raised concerns 
regarding the potential visual impacts of the Project (Appendix 2.D). 
10.3.21 Underground cables were subsequently chosen as the preferred option for 
Phase 1 statutory consultation in order to minimise visual impact.  In the 2014 
PEIR (available during Phase 1 statutory consultation), it was noted that the 
cable would be installed beneath the road; however, it has now been decided 
that the cable will be laid alongside the road for ease of maintenance. 
Electrical Connection Route 
10.3.22 The Electrical Connection Opportunity Area, to the south west of the 
Generating Equipment Site, was the area within which the route for the 
Electrical Connection was identified and was presented during initial Phase 1 
non-statutory consultation. 
10.3.23 Following consideration of a limited number of route corridor options for the 
Electrical Connection and further to initial consultation, APL selected a route 
for the Electrical Connection which resulted in the shortest and most direct 
route from the Generating Equipment Site to the Substation and which 
requires the least amount of land take and avoids any statutory designated 
sites or valued habitats.

Air Quality 
10.3.24 A number of S42(1)(a) and S42(1)(d) respondents during Phase 1 and Phase 
2 statutory consultation made comments in respect of the air quality impacts 
of the Project, particularly in respect of the environmental assessment and 
future monitoring, and the impact on individual wellbeing (Appendices 
6.C,6.D, 11.B and 11.C).  Several S47 respondents also raised concerns 
regarding the impact of the Project on air quality (Appendix 6.B and 11.A). 
10.3.25 The EIA assessment methodology, presented in the ES (Document 
Reference 6.1) provides more detailed information in respect of the potential 
air quality impacts to that of the 2014 PEIR (available during Phase 1 statutory 
consultation) and 2018 PEIR (available during Phase 2 statutory 
consultation), and was agreed with NRW and Environmental Health Officers 
at CCS.  This includes updates to the dust assessment following S42 
comments received during Phase 2 statutory consultation. 
10.3.26 The air quality assessment (contained within chapter 6 of the ES (Document 
Reference 6.1)) concludes that, overall, the Project will have no significant 
impacts on air quality during construction, operation and decommissioning. 
Furthermore, the emissions from the stack will be strictly limited by NRW as 
part of an operational environmental permit. 
Noise 
10.3.27 Several S42(1)(d) respondents during Phase 1 consultation raised concerns 
regarding the impact of noise on individual wellbeing due to their own 
proximity to the Project Site, and several S42(a) respondents queried the 
methodology of the noise assessment presented in the 2014 PEIR (available 
during Phase 1 statutory consultation) (Appendices 6.C and 6.D). 
10.3.28 The noise assessment in the 2014 PEIR (available during Phase 1 statutory 
consultation) (Appendices 6.C and 6.D) was undertaken based on a worst-
case scenario and considered potentially significant effects which may be 
caused by the construction, operation and decommissioning of the Project on 
noise sensitive receptors in and around the vicinity of the Project Site.  The 
assessment took account of relevant planning policy and guidance contained 
within: The Environmental Noise (Wales) (Amendment) Regulations 2009; 
The Noise Action Plan for Wales: British Standard (BS) 7445 'Description and 
Measurement of Environmental Noise'; BS 4142 'Method for rating industrial 
noise affecting mixed residential and industrial areas'; EA Horizontal 
Guidance H3 Part 2: Noise assessment and control; and World Health 
Organisation (WHO) Guidelines for Community Noise. 
10.3.29 In response to concerns raised at the outreach meeting with PINS (Appendix 
5.B), an outline CEMP (Appendix 3.1 to the ES (Document Reference 6.2)) 
has been prepared and is submitted as part of the Application.  APL has 
committed to avoiding 24-hour working hours during construction and 
implementing noise abatement measures. 
Consultation Report 
Abergelli Power Project 
 
 
224 
 
10.3.30 During Phase 2 statutory consultation, NRW queried the assessment criteria 
used for the noise assessment, particularly omission of the use of BS4142 at 
night and use of WHO night noise guidelines for Europe.  As discussed with 
NRW following the s42 consultation, detailed baseline sound monitoring was 
undertaken between 15th and 22nd February 2018. The results included a full 
range of relevant weather conditions, which have been used to update the 
noise assessment in the ES. Robust representative baseline ambient and 
background sound levels have been derived from the results by filtering for 
appropriate weather conditions and statistical analysis of filtered data.  The 
most notable changes were that the detailed survey resulted in higher 
representative background sound levels at NSRs 1 and 6 and lower ambient 
levels at NSR 4.  As a result the assessments are now clearer in terms of 
their low impacts. The BS 4142 night time assessment based on the results 
of the detailed survey demonstrate an impact better than low adverse at all 
receptors.  A night time BS 4142 assessment is therefore in the ES 
(Document Reference 6.1) alongside the WHO assessment. 
10.3.31 The noise assessment (contained within chapter 7 of the ES (Document 
Reference 6.1)) states that, following implementation of embedded mitigation 
measures, as described in the outline CEMP (Appendix 3.1 of the ES 
(Document Reference 6.2), construction noise impacts are anticipated to be 
minor adverse and therefore not significant.  During operation of the Power 
Generation Plant, the noise assessment (contained within chapter 7 of the 
ES (Document Reference 6.1)) states that the effects will be negligible or 
minor adverse, which are not significant.  
Socio-Economics 
10.3.32 During Phase 1 non-statutory consultation, several respondents commented 
that the number of jobs created was not very significant. 
10.3.33 During both Phase 1 statutory consultation and Phase 2 statutory 
consultation, some S47 respondents further queried the benefit of the Project 
to the local community and considered that there would not be any long-term 
jobs for local people.  A number of S47 respondents also stated an interest in 
work opportunities arising from the Project.   
10.3.34 The 2018 PEIR (available during Phase 2 statutory consultation) explained 
that the construction period is estimated to last 22 months from 2020-2022 
and the number of construction workers on site per month will range from 25 
to 122 during the peak construction period.  The operational phase of the 
Project will provide an estimated 10 FTE direct jobs.  Each of the Project’s 10 
FTE jobs will be highly skilled positions that offer permanent employment 
opportunities for 25 years and will be relatively high paid.   
10.3.35 APL has noted the interest of S47 consultees in local employment 
opportunities and will maintain ongoing engagement with the local community 
in this regard following the submission of the Application. 
Consultation Report 
Abergelli Power Project 
 
 
225 
 
10.3.36 APL intends to realise suitable opportunities for the local area over the longer-
term and is discussing with CCS as to how local employment opportunities 
can be secured through an appropriate mechanism. 
10.4 
Other Feedback 
10.4.1 
During both the Phase 1 and Phase 2 consultation APL received a number of 
comments which did not lead to any Project changes for the reasons set out 
below. 
Project Need 
10.4.2 
A number of responses felt that the need for the Project was unjustified, 
particularly given that there are several wind farms and solar parks within 
close proximity of the site.  APL acknowledged these concerns however 
explained that the need for flexible gas fired power station infrastructure is 
well established in Welsh and UK-wide government policy, each of which 
state that there is an urgent requirement for the electricity generation mix to 
incorporate a balance of technologies that reliably produce stable and 
controllable power during the transition to a low carbon economy.  APL 
considers that the Project responds to this identified need. 
Site Selection 
10.4.3 
Some respondents, particularly in the early stages of consultation, queried 
why alternative sites had not been considered which were not within a 
predominantly rural area.  APL sought to explain the detailed site assessment 
which had been undertaken from 2010-2013 and explained the key factors 
which were considered in the site selection process. 
Cumulative Impacts 
10.4.4 
Some respondents raised concerns regarding the impact of the Project 
combined with other nearby developments.  APL explained that a cumulative 
impact assessment has been undertaken as part of the EIA in order to 
consider the combined impacts of the Project with other known nearby 
developments, as identified and agreed with CCS. 
CHP 
10.4.5 
During Phase 1 consultation, PINS advised APL to prepare information to 
address the requirements of NPSs in respect of CHP.  Accordingly, a CHP 
Technical Note (Appendix 5.1 of the ES (Document Reference 6.2) has been 
prepared and is submitted as part of the Application.  The Planning Statement 
(Document Reference 10.1) summarises the CHP Technical Note (Appendix 
5.1 of the ES (Document Reference 6.2) with reference to NPS policy and 
also introduces the regulatory environment deriving from the Energy 
Efficiency Directive in respect of cogeneration for generating plants.

10.5 
Post DCO Submission 
10.5.1 
APL is committed to continued engagement with the local community and key 
stakeholders following submission of the DCO Application, as well as 
throughout the construction, operational and decommissioning phases 
should a DCO be granted. 
10.5.2 
Following submission of the DCO Application, providing it is accepted for 
examination by PINS, APL will undertake statutory notification under S56 of 
the PA 2008.  The S56 notification will include publication and advertisement 
of the accepted application, and information on how to register as an 
interested party for the purpose of involvement in the Examination process.  
Interested parties will have the opportunity to review the application, and to 
provide Relevant Representations (consultation responses) to PINS in 
relation to the application.  Engagement with statutory bodies and other 
interested parties will continue through the Pre-Examination and Examination 
periods to ensure all matters are addressed during that time. 
10.5.3 
In the early stages of non-statutory consultation, APL raised the possibility of 
a Community Liaison Group in which a number of respondents expressed an 
interest. Should a DCO be granted, APL is committed to establishing this 
group to maintain a dialogue with the local community. 
10.5.4 
APL will maintain on-going engagement with the local community, CCS and 
interested parties and respond to queries in relation to the Project as they 
arise.

Conclusion 
11.1.1 
The PA 2008 sets out statutory requirements for applicants to engage in pre-
application consultation with local communities, local authorities and those 
who would be directly affected by the project.  
11.1.2 
This Consultation Report has been prepared in accordance with s37(7) of the 
PA 2008 and seeks to demonstrate how APL has complied with its various 
duties under the relevant sections of the PA 2008.   
11.1.3 
The following provisions of the PA 2008 are relevant to statutory consultation: 
 S42: Duty to consult certain categories of person; 
 S43: Local authorities for purposes of S42(1)(b); 
 S44: Categories for purposes of S42(1)(d); 
 S45: Timetable for consultation under S42; 
 S46: Duty to notify SoS of proposed application (and to provide S42 
consultation materials to the SoS); 
 S47: Duty to consult relevant authority on SoCC and local community 
in accordance with SoCC;  
 S48: Duty to publicise the proposed Application; and 
 S49: Duty to take account of responses to consultation and publicity. 
11.1.4 
APL undertook two phases of statutory pre-application consultation, between 
13th October 2014 and 16th November 2014 (Phase 1 consultation) and 
between 16th January 2018 and 19th February 2018 (Phase 2 consultation).  
Both phases aligned S42, S47 and S48 requirements to run in parallel across 
an extended, 35-day consultation period.   
11.1.5 
Under S42, the bodies prescribed by Schedule 1 of the APFP Regulations, 
local authorities under S43 of the PA 2008, and those who fall under S44 of 
the PA 2008, were consulted about the proposed application.  The full list of 
S42 parties is included as Appendix 4.I.I for the Phase 1 consultation and 
Appendix 9.G.I for the Phase 2 consultation.  The S42 information sent out to 
each consultee is set out in sections 6 and 8 of this Consultation Report and 
included the preliminary findings of the EIA (in the form of the 2014 PEIR 
(Phase 1 consultation) and the 2018 PEIR (Phase 2 consultation)).  
11.1.6 
APL undertook non-statutory consultation with CCS throughout the phased 
consultation.  Initial consultation was undertaken on the draft 2014 SoCC 
(Appendix 4.A.II) with CCS, who were given 28 days to comment, to inform 
the development of the published 2014 SoCC (Appendices 4.A.V and 4.A.VI). 
Consultation Report 
Abergelli Power Project 
 
 
228 
 
11.1.7 
The published 2014 SoCC (in English and Welsh) (Appendices 4.A.V and 
4.A.VI) set out how APL would consult with the local community under S47 of 
the PA 2008 during Phase 1 consultation.  The published 2014 SoCC (in 
English and Welsh) (Appendices 4.A.V and 4.A.VI) and Consultation Plan 
(Appendix 4.A.IX) were made available from 30th September 2014  on the 
APL website (http://www.abergellipower.co.uk), at local libraries and CCS’s 
offices.  Notices (in English and Welsh) were published in the South Wales 
Evening Post on 30th September 2014 (Appendix 4.A.VII) and 7th October 
2014 (Appendix 4.A.VIII) stating when and where the 2014 SoCC 
(Appendices 4.A.V and 4.A.VI) could be inspected.    
11.1.8 
Due to the Project being ‘on hold’ for a period following the 2014/2015 
consultation APL produced a second SoCC (2018 SoCC) ahead of the 2018 
statutory consultation (Phase 2 consultation).  CCS was consulted on the 
draft 2018 SoCC (Appendix 9.A) (together with a summary note of 2014 
consultation activities, a draft list of “hard to reach” groups to be contacted, 
and a draft list of consultation documents to be provided in Welsh language) 
and given 28 days in which to provide comment on APL’s proposed approach 
to the Phase 2 consultation.  
11.1.9 
The published 2018 SoCC (in English and Welsh) (Appendices 9.B.I and 
9.B.II) provided an update regarding the Project following the Phase 1 
consultation, including an explanation of the planning and consenting process 
associated with generating stations in Wales, and set out how APL would 
consult with the local community under S47 of the PA 2008 during Phase 2 
consultation.  The 2018 SoCC (Appendices 9.B.I and 9.B.II) was made 
available from 2nd January 2018 on the APL website and at local libraries.  
Notices (in English and Welsh) were published in the South Wales Evening 
Post on 2nd January 2018 (Appendix 9.B.III) and 9th January 2018 (Appendix 
9.B.IV) stating when and where the 2018 SoCC (Appendices 9.B.I and 9.B.II) 
could be inspected. 
11.1.10 In accordance with S48 of the PA 2008, notices publicising the Project were 
published once in the London Gazette, once in a national newspaper (The 
Independent (Phase 1) and The Times (Phase 2)) and twice in a local 
newspaper (South Wales Evening Post) during Phase 1 and Phase 2 
consultation.  The notice explained when and where the consultation 
documents could be viewed, and the deadline for responses.  
11.1.11 On behalf of the SoS, PINS received a copy of the information and 
documentation that APL were consulting on, ahead of the Phase 1 and Phase 
2 statutory consultation periods. These submissions were in accordance with 
s46 of the PA 2008.  
11.1.12 The requirements of the PA 2008 have been more than met by the 
programme of non-statutory and statutory consultation undertaken by the 
Applicant. 
11.1.13 The feedback received throughout both the Phase 1 and Phase 2 non-
statutory and statutory consultation has been analysed according to the 
Consultation Report 
Abergelli Power Project 
 
 
229 
 
themes that are represented by the comments received. Where a comment 
covers more than one theme, this has been accounted for. Where relevant, 
the detailed content of the comments received is also discussed.  
11.1.14 Chapters 6, 7, 8 and 9 of this Report explain how APL’s engagement and 
consultation influenced the development of the Project.  Table 11-1 highlights 
the key outputs generated by the various consultation responses received, 
and how these correspond to the various development stages of the Project.

11.1.15 This Report demonstrates that the Project generated significant levels of 
interest and participation from a broad spectrum of consultees.  Furthermore, 
and importantly, many of the most significant design and Project decisions, 
summarised in Table 11-1, were either directly or indirectly influenced by 
consultation.
