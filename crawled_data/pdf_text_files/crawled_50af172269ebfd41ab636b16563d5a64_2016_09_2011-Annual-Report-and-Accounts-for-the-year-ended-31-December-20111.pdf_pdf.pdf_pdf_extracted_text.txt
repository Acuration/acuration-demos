Annual report and accounts 2011
2011
Welcome to Drax
Drax is so much more 
than the UK’s largest, 
cleanest and most 
efﬁcient coal-ﬁred 
power station...
We are focused on 
maximising value and 
achieving our vision 
of becoming a bold, 
customer oriented 
power generation and 
retail business, driven 
by biomass innovation.
Drax is predominantly a power 
generation business responsible 
for meeting some 7% of the UK’s 
electricity demand. Currently owning 
and operating the largest power 
station in the UK, we are committed 
to reducing our carbon footprint. 
Through the progressive expansion 
of the use of sustainable biomass, 
as a replacement for coal, we aim 
to provide a low carbon, low cost and 
reliable power generation business 
well into the future.
At the other end of the supply chain, 
through our retail arm, Haven Power, 
we serve the needs of over 40,000 
business sites. Our intention is to 
grow a signiﬁcant retail business 
providing us with a valuable alternative 
to trading through the wholesale 
electricity market.

Annual report and 
accounts 2011
During 2011, we delivered strong operational performance across 
the business. Although we experienced a good deal of uncertainty 
in the power-related commodity markets, I am pleased to report 
earnings (EBITDA) for 2011 of £334 million (2010: £392 million) 
and an operating proﬁt of £366 million (2010: £279 million). 
In accordance with our dividend policy, the Board proposes 
a ﬁnal dividend in respect of 2011 of 11.8 pence per share, 
equivalent to £43 million. This would give a total dividend for 
the year of 27.8 pence per share (2010: 32.0 pence per share).
We continue to make progress in reducing our carbon footprint, 
something which is now well embedded in and central to our 
business strategy. In just a matter of weeks we will embark on the 
last stage of the largest steam turbine modernisation programme 
in UK history, which brings with it a carbon dioxide emissions 
saving of one million tonnes a year.
Haven Power Limited, our electricity retail company serving 
business customers, made good progress implementing its IT 
business platform which is critical to realising its growth ambitions. 
We are delighted with the growth achieved in 2011 and the real 
value that the Group is now deriving from the company’s success. 
It complements well our existing trading capabilities and provides 
a credit efﬁcient, direct sales channel for an increasing proportion 
of our power.
Electricity generation from sustainable biomass remains our 
focus and we continue to believe that this technology has 
considerable potential and an important role as a low carbon, 
cost effective, reliable and ﬂexible source of renewable power 
for the UK. I am delighted to say that our view is being echoed 
by those in Government and elsewhere, which is encouraging.
We have continued to work with the Government throughout 
the year to advance the case for sustainable biomass and secure 
an appropriate level of support. We have welcomed the dialogue 
that we have been afforded and appreciate the extensive work 
undertaken by the Government on the biomass agenda.

Governance
Financials
We have enhanced our technical and commercial expertise 
in the emerging biomass energy sector and we are ready 
to increase greatly our electricity generation from sustainable 
biomass. However, we will only do so if the regulatory regime, 
including the economics of the support offered, is attractive 
for our shareholders.
On more governance-related matters and in line with the guidance 
given in the UK Corporate Governance Code (the “Code”), I should 
like to comment on how the principles relating to the role and 
effectiveness of the Board have been applied.
There is a clear division of responsibilities between myself as 
Chairman and our Chief Executive, Dorothy Thompson. We have 
a clear statement on which matters are reserved for the Board 
and those which are delegated, and these are reviewed at least 
annually. Our non-executive directors play a major role in 
challenging constructively the Group’s management, particularly 
on matters of strategy and its development.
In recent years through our formal, rigorous and transparent 
selection process, we have endeavoured to ensure that those 
appointed to the Board have complementary skills, experience 
and knowledge in order to improve the quality of the Board and 
its decision making. Following publication of the Davies Report, 
Women on Boards, in February 2011, the Board considered the 
recommendations of both the Davies Report and the Financial 
Reporting Council consultation on possible changes to the Code. 
Consequently, we established a policy to ensure that gender 
diversity is one of the factors taken into account when considering 
future appointments to the Board and other senior appointments.
Details of the Board, its function, performance and effectiveness 
can be found in the Corporate governance section of this report.
Throughout the business I believe we have made signiﬁcant 
progress during 2011 and my sincere thanks go to all Group staff 
for their hard work and commitment, without which none of this 
year’s achievements would have been possible.

Maximising the value of the Drax business
We now make use of a range of fuels, including coal, 
biomass and others which are economically advantageous.
How we maximise value
For the last nine years we have burnt biomass in place of 
some of our coal, when economic to do so. Beyond biomass, 
we also have the ability to burn other fuels, such as petcoke 
and pond ﬁnes, which can be economically advantageous. 
By diversifying our fuel sources, not only are we less reliant 
on a single fuel type, but we are able to capture value from 
commodity market cycles, and in the case of biomass avoid 
the cost of carbon.
Through keeping a constant eye on the commodity 
markets within which we operate we are able to optimise 
the commercial despatch of our power.
How we maximise value
As the largest power station in the UK we are able to utilise 
economies of scale through, for example, procuring fuel at 
competitive prices. Our trading strategy to hedge our power 
sales with coal and carbon purchases enables us to lock in 
value in the near, short and long term. We are always looking 
to increase the trading options available to us, for example, 
through our retail business. We beneﬁt from having a physical 
asset to trade around and through a seamless interface with 
the operations side of the business we derive value from the 
operational characteristics of the power station, such as high 
availability and ﬂexibility, enabling us to extract value even 
when market conditions are poor.

Our business model
Our overriding objective is to maximise the value of the Drax 
business whilst increasing our electricity generation from biomass, 
and so reducing our carbon footprint, subject to the availability 
of appropriate levels of regulatory support. 
Our proﬁtability is determined by both the difference between 
the price at which we sell our power and the cost of coal and 
carbon, known as the “dark green spread”, and increasingly by the 
“bark spread” for co-ﬁring, which is the difference between power 
price and renewable support and the cost of biomass. 
From this starting point there are several steps in the Drax value 
chain, with each one adding incremental value to the business 
and ultimately maximising the value of our business and delivering 
our gross margin.

Drax Power Station is the largest, cleanest and most 
efﬁcient coal-ﬁred power station in the UK, almost twice 
the size of the next largest power station.
How we maximise value
Already the most efﬁcient coal-ﬁred power station in the 
UK, we are improving our overall efﬁciency through our 
turbine upgrade project which brings with it coal 
and carbon savings. With leading performances across 
all aspects of the operational side of the generation business, 
from safety to maintenance, we are able to deliver high 
availability and reliability. In addition, the ﬂexibility of our 
power station allows us to respond quickly to changes in 
demand. Together that means we are consistently there 
when needed, both to meet our contractual obligations 
and to provide support services critical to security of supply.

We work towards reducing our impact on the 
environment with a policy of regarding compliance 
with legislation as a minimum level of achievement.
How we maximise value
We strive to be at the forefront of environmental performance 
in pursuit of maintaining our commercial and environmental 
leadership position in the coal-ﬁred sector. Through burning 
sustainable biomass and our turbine upgrade project we are 
able to reduce the amount of coal we burn, save on carbon 
costs and reduce emissions of CO2. We generate revenue 
through sales of our by-products. We aim to maximise the 
sales of ash produced from burning coal, which not only 
saves on landﬁll costs, but creates its own revenue 
stream. By reducing emissions of sulphur dioxide, through 
our ﬂue gas desulphurisation process, we produce gypsum 
which, like ash, is sold to the construction industry.

Chief Executive’s statement
Introduction
The business performed well in 2011 against a backdrop 
of volatile commodity markets and signiﬁcant regulatory 
developments. In our generation and retail businesses, 
we maintained our focus on excellence in operations, 
tight cost control and disciplined capital project execution. 
Preparation for our biomass expansion is now well advanced. 
We completed extensive combustion trials in 2011, and are now 
conﬁdent in our technical ability to be predominantly biomass 
fuelled. However, it is important to note that moving ahead 
with our plans remains dependent on securing appropriate 
regulatory support and a strong investment case.
Good ﬁnancial results, the successful conclusion, in April, 
to the Group’s Eurobond ﬁnancing structure and the bank 
reﬁnancing we completed in July, leave us with a strong 
balance sheet which provides a solid foundation for future 
investment in the business.
Strategy
Our vision for Drax is to be a bold, customer oriented power 
generation and retail business, driven by biomass innovation. 
We have two key strategic initiatives to enable us to achieve 
our vision, namely, our project to convert Drax Power 
Station into a predominantly biomass fuelled generating 
asset, subject to securing the necessary regulatory support, 
and our programme for the expansion of Haven Power Limited 
(“Haven Power”).
Commodity markets
A number of signiﬁcant global events 
in 2011 combined to create uncertainty 
in the commodity markets in which 
we operate.
The gas market continued to be the 
dominant factor in driving power prices. 
Both the unrest in North Africa and the 
Middle East and the incident at one of 
Japan’s nuclear power stations which 
increased the country’s demand for 
liqueﬁed natural gas (“LNG”), 
contributed to increasing gas prices 
through the middle of the year. 
Thereafter, exceptionally mild weather 
in the fourth quarter saw gas prices 
come under pressure and begin to fall.
Coal prices moved within a relatively 
narrow range throughout the year. 
Carbon prices reached their lowest 
point for two years amid fears for the 
Eurozone economies. Looking ahead, the 
introduction of the carbon price support 
mechanism by the UK Government 
from April 2013 is likely to erode the 
competitive position in the market 
of our coal-ﬁred generation business, 
but at the same time it strengthens 
the case for biomass generation.
Overall, gas prices were resilient through 
much of the year and we saw improving 
dark green spreads, the difference 
between the price of power and the 
cost of coal and carbon, for coal-ﬁred 
generators. In the last quarter of the year, 
however, spreads began to drift down as 
the unusually mild weather for the time 
of year continued.
Bark spreads for co-ﬁring, the difference 
between power price and renewable 
support and the cost of biomass, 
remained weak, with most traded 
biomass commanding lower margins 
than coal.
Retail performance
Haven Power is meeting our growth 
expectations with over double the retail 
sales of 2010 during 2011. The growth 
has been driven largely by our 
progression in the industrial and 
commercial (“I&C”) market, supported 
by the implementation of a new IT 
platform which is working well.

An excellent standard of customer 
service is central to our proposition for 
this business, and we were pleased to 
see recognition of that through being 
ranked No. 1 for customer satisfaction in 
the small and medium enterprise (“SME”) 
market in the 2011 Datamonitor Survey.
Selling our output through Haven Power 
provides a credit efﬁcient route 
to market for our power sales compared 
to the wholesale electricity market. 
These sales, when secured at a ﬁxed 
price, provide a hedge against adverse 
power price movements. Currently, 
some 20% of our forward sales are 
through Haven Power.
Although Haven Power made a small 
loss in 2011, we remain on track with 
our target to break-even in this business 
from 2013.
Operating performance 
Following a record year for operating 
performance in 2010, we continued to 
deliver industry-leading performance in 
2011. As in previous years, our availability 
and reliability throughout 2011 meant that 
we were able to deliver value to the 
business through providing ﬂexible 
generation output and balancing services 
to the System Operator, National Grid, in 
support of system stability and security.
The single unit outage for 2011 was 
completed in good time, especially given 
the complexity of some of the renewal 
work undertaken. Our safety statistics 
continue to be industry-leading, with the 
best performance on total recordable 
injury rate since we began using the 
measure in 2005. 
For the year, our forced outage rate, 
which measures any reduction in plant 
availability excluding planned outages, 
is in line with our long-term target of 5%, 
which has been set through extensive 
benchmarking with UK and international 
coal-ﬁred plant to determine the 
optimum balance between performance 
and cost. We delivered this operating 
performance whilst keeping a tight 
control on costs. 
We continued to work on increasing 
our burn of fuels which have a higher 
margin or lower carbon footprint over 
the standard bituminous coal which 
we burn. These advantaged fuels 
(petcoke, pond ﬁnes and commercial 
biomass) accounted for 9% of the 
total fuel burnt during the year. 
We are furthering our work on the 
options available to us for compliance 
with the more stringent emissions 
standards of the Industrial Emissions 
Directive (“IED”) from 2016. The key 
factors in determining the optimal 
solution for compliance are plant 
ﬂexibility, with some technologies such 
as selective catalytic reduction (“SCR”) 
allowing more ﬂexibility than others, and 
fuel mix. Accordingly, the level of biomass 
burn is an important consideration.
We currently estimate the cost of 
compliance with the IED, including SCR, 
to be in the order of £200 million (see 
Strategic capital investment plan).
Renewable output and 
research and development
Our biomass co-ﬁring facility operated 
well during the year, but at less than full 
capacity. Unfortunately, due to the low 
level of renewable support available for 
co-ﬁring, much of the biomass available 
for purchase was not economic to burn. 
This severely limited our commercial 
burn of biomass, with less than half of 
our co-ﬁring capacity being used for 
commercial electricity generation.
During the year, we extended our 
research and development work with 
combustion trials of a wide variety 
of sustainable biomass materials at 
different throughputs and under 
varying operating conditions. We burnt 
signiﬁcant volumes of uneconomic 
biomass to support our research 
and development, but the associated 
cost was necessary to support these 
critical trials.
The results of the trials to date have been 
encouraging and we have conﬁdence 
in the technical capability to become 
predominantly biomass fuelled. 
2

12
Drax Group plc
Annual report and 
accounts 2011
Chief Executive’s statement
Through the trials we achieved high 
levels of biomass burn over sustained 
periods, during which time we were also 
able to demonstrate the plant’s ﬂexibility. 
We have an advanced understanding of 
the chemistry dynamics, and we have 
been working closely with third party 
experts to understand any longer term 
plant efﬁciency or capacity reduction 
implications. 
We have also extended our research 
and development work to cover more 
fuels and further analysis of the likely 
emissions of nitrogen oxides, to help 
determine the optimal solution for 
IED compliance as described earlier. 
The ﬁnal results of these trials are due 
in the second half of 2012.
The ﬁnal support level under the 
regulatory framework is the main driving 
force which will determine the mix of 
sustainable biomass materials and 
supply contract tenors, which in turn 
determines the extent to which we co-ﬁre 
and, therefore, the performance of the 
plant itself.
Further carbon abatement 
In addition to the carbon dioxide (“CO2”)
savings through burning biomass in place 
of coal, savings were made through 
efﬁciency improvements, with the 
progress of our turbine upgrade project 
making a key contribution. The low 
pressure and high pressure turbine 
modules of ﬁve of our six generating 
units have now been replaced and are 
operating as expected, which means we 
are approaching an overall efﬁciency 
for the power station of 40%. 
With only three low pressure turbine 
modules to be replaced during the 
ﬁrst of two unit outages in 2012 we are 
nearing completion of the project, which 
commenced in 2007. On completion, 
the improved efﬁciency of the power 
station will lead to a reduction in CO2 
emissions of one million tonnes a year. 
In February 2011, in conjunction with 
Alstom UK Limited and National Grid 
Carbon Limited, we lodged an application 
for European funding for a new, stand-
alone 426MW oxy-ﬁred carbon capture 
and storage demonstration project based 
at the Drax Power Station site. Following 
consideration by the UK Government the 
project was one of seven put forward to 
the European Investment Bank in May 
2011 for further consideration. In January 
2012, industrial gases provider, BOC (a 
member of The Linde Group), joined the 
consortium, further strengthening the 
project. The outcome of the application 
for European funding will not be known 
until the second half of 2012.
Legislative and 
regulatory framework
In July 2011, the Electricity Market 
Reform (“EMR”) White Paper was 
published. The White Paper represents 
a major change for the electricity sector. 
We do, however, believe that reform 
of the electricity market is essential 
to creating the right environment to 
stimulate the huge investment necessary 
to provide adequate, affordable and 
sustainable supplies of electricity into 
the 2020s and beyond.
In December, an EMR Technical Update 
was published, providing further detail 
on the Government’s preferred options 
for market reform. The document 
conﬁrmed the intention to implement 
a market-based capacity auction with 
the aim of ensuring capacity availability. 
A more detailed design of the mechanism 
will be developed during this year.
Within the EMR, a new low carbon 
support mechanism, Feed-in Tariff with 
Contracts for Difference (“FiT CfD”) 
has also been conﬁrmed. This will replace 
the Renewables Obligation in 2017 
for new renewable generation facilities, 
but not those already in operation. 
It is proposed that both the capacity 
mechanism and the FiT CfD 
arrangements will be run by a single 
central body, the System Operator.

Chief Executive’s statement
The 2011 Budget conﬁrmed the 
introduction of a carbon price support 
mechanism, as part of the EMR, which we 
are against. We believe there is potential 
for conﬂict with the existing EU Emissions 
Trading System (“EU ETS”) and given the 
cap and trade nature of the EU ETS, the 
ﬂoor price will have no impact on overall 
CO2 emissions, since any reduction in the 
UK’s emissions will simply result in higher 
emissions elsewhere in the EU. We also 
believe that the introduction of price 
support will, in all likelihood, distort the 
wholesale market. Nevertheless, we have 
actively engaged with the Government on 
the detail and design of the mechanism.
In advance of the renewable support 
arrangements proposed under the EMR, 
the much awaited consultation on the 
future support levels for renewable 
technologies from 2013 was published 
by the Government in October. This will 
apply to all renewable generation 
facilities accredited before April 2017. 
We were particularly pleased to see 
recognition in the consultation of the 
strategically important role that 
sustainably sourced biomass electricity 
can play in the future UK renewable 
energy mix. In seeking to maximise the 
deployment of the cheapest renewable 
technologies, speciﬁc support levels or 
bands have been proposed for the 
increased use of sustainable biomass in 
existing coal-ﬁred power stations through 
enhanced co-ﬁring and full conversion. 
The new bands have been created 
in recognition of the greater capital 
investment that is required to either 
co-ﬁre large volumes of biomass or 
convert existing coal-ﬁred stations to 
burn solely biomass.
The proposed support level for enhanced 
co-ﬁring will enable us to increase our 
sustainable biomass burn. However, 
to maximise our potential and secure 
our renewable output out to 2020 and 
beyond we require a moderate uplift on 
the proposed level of support. This would 
guarantee that this cost effective form of 
renewable generation will be available to 
help meet the UK’s 2020 targets and will 
lead to lower electricity prices for the UK 
consumer, who will otherwise bear the 
cost of the more expensive alternatives.
In addition to our focus on sustainable 
biomass co-ﬁring, we have been working 
with Siemens Project Ventures on our 
dedicated biomass developments. 
We expressed disappointment with 
the proposed level of support for this 
technology, which makes the investment 
case for independent generators highly 
challenging. The development planned 
for the Drax Power Station site has 
proved the most challenging for a 
number of reasons, including its inland 
location which increases logistics costs. 
Given the signiﬁcant ﬁnancial liability 
that we would face were we to delay 
our investment decision until we have 
certainty over the ﬁnal support level for 
dedicated biomass we have decided to 
cancel the project. 
We are exploring a number of options 
available to us for structuring the 
development planned for the Port of 
Immingham site so as to make it a viable 
proposition.
We participated fully during the 
Government’s consultation process with 
a view to securing appropriate support to 
progress our biomass plans and now that 
the consultation has closed we await the 
Government’s response, which we expect 
to be published in the Spring.
Biomass supply chain 
and sustainability 
Establishing the biomass supply chain 
logistics and procuring sustainable 
biomass against our robust sustainability 
policy are critical components of our 
work to deliver a biomass future for the 
Group. Despite the immature and 
bespoke nature of the supply chain, we 
believe we will be able to secure sufﬁcient 
sustainable biomass to meet our 
ambition to become a predominantly 
biomass fuelled generator. 
There are four strands to our fuel 
contracting strategy. We are looking to 
secure term rights to sustainable 
biomass through both direct contracts 
for delivered biomass pellets and 
contracts for unprocessed ﬁbre to 
provide greater security over the ﬁbre 
source. In order to enhance the security 
of supply from such contracts we are also 
exploring direct investment in biomass 
pellet plants.
We will also engage in spot and shorter 
term opportunistic purchases, with 
the ability to cope with a wide fuel 
envelope being key to securing value 
in this market. 
We will try to develop further UK sources 
of fuel. Although this is likely to remain 
a small proportion of our total fuel mix. 
Despite targeting various geographies 
and ﬁbre sources, we expect to see an 
early concentration in North America. 
All our biomass is procured against 
our own industry-leading, robust 
sustainability criteria, which include 
greenhouse gas emission reduction 
requirements, and habitats and 
biodiversity protection, as well as socio-
economic considerations in the source 
areas. A programme of independent 
audits ensures all our suppliers comply 
with our sustainability criteria. 
We ﬁrmly believe that robust, mandatory 
sustainability criteria are vital to maintain 
and enhance public acceptance, and 
ensure that sustainable practices are 
implemented. Assessment of the full 
life cycle carbon footprint of biomass, 
that is, from ﬁeld to furnace, is now well 
developed, especially in the UK where 
a mandatory life cycle standard comes 
into effect in 2013. 
We are now in our ﬁfth year of calculating 
the life cycle carbon footprint of all the 
biomass we procure and we are 
conﬁdent that our sustainable biomass 
fuel sourcing strategy will meet the 
current mandatory standard which will 
ensure we continue to earn regulatory 
support from April 2013. Our calculations 
show that the range of sustainable 
biomass materials we have burnt over 
the last few years has a far lower carbon 
footprint than that of fossil fuel-ﬁred 
generating plant. In 2011, the average 
greenhouse gas saving resulting from 
burning biomass in place of coal 
was 81%, compared to the EU fossil 
fuel comparator.

Strategic capital 
investment plan
As described above, the proposed 
support level for enhanced co-ﬁring 
will enable us to increase our sustainable 
biomass burn. However, our existing 
co-ﬁring capacity of 12.5% of our output 
is insufﬁcient to meet the proposed 
threshold of 15% of output necessary 
to receive enhanced co-ﬁring support. 
Therefore, to secure the full beneﬁt 
from our existing co-ﬁring facilities, 
we have committed to invest £50 million 
in 2012 in new biomass storage and other 
limited plant modiﬁcations to provide 
the capability to produce up to 20% 
of our output from co-ﬁring sustainable 
biomass, so enabling qualiﬁcation for 
the enhanced co-ﬁring band. In doing 
so, we will only burn biomass which is 
economic, that is, which commands 
higher margins than coal.
We have also made good progress on 
the strategic capital investment plan 
for further biomass expansion. However, 
it is important to note again that further 
investment remains dependent on 
securing appropriate regulatory 
support and a strong investment case. 
The principal components of the plan are 
the further development of our biomass 
capability and IED compliance.
There are two phases to the development 
of our biomass capability. Phase 1 is the 
committed investment of £50 million 
to secure full beneﬁt from our existing 
co-ﬁring facilities as described above. 
Phase 2 requires signiﬁcant further 
investment in the range of £400–£450 
million. Much of this investment will be 
in additional fuel storage and handling 
facilities at Drax Power Station as well as 
further investment in plant modiﬁcations. 
There may also be investment in the 
biomass supply chain to enhance security 
of supply for strategic fuel supplies. 
As described in Operating performance 
above, we currently estimate the cost of 
IED compliance, including SCR, to be in 
the order of £200 million.
It is important to recognise that if we 
are in a position to progress our strategic 
investment plan, our strong balance 
sheet, with net cash of £225 million at 
year end, provides a good foundation 
for our funding requirements. Other 
important considerations for funding 
include working capital, our credit rating 
and our trading strategy. We expect that, 
with an appropriate level of support 
and a strong investment case, we would 
be able to ﬁnance our investment plans 
and begin the transformation of Drax 
into a predominantly biomass fuelled 
generator. 
Our people
Our people are a key resource and 
we consider it a priority to deliver 
excellent people leadership across our 
operations. Throughout the Group we 
share the values of honesty, energy, 
achievement and team spirit. We have 
a responsibility to our people and we 
recognise that engaging and motivating 
them leads to better business 
performance. Our approach to looking 
after our people is described in more 
detail in the Corporate and social 
responsibility section on page 42. 
Looking ahead
We enter 2012 with a strong hedge from 
forward power sales, which were secured 
at good margins. However, there is little 
visibility in our markets beyond 2013. 
In addition, whereas for Phase II of the EU 
ETS (2008–2012) we have an allocation 
of 9.5 million tonnes of CO2 emissions 
allowances per annum under the UK 
National Allocation Plan, we will not 
receive any allocation in Phase III (2013–
2020). We will also have the increased 
cost impact of the introduction of the 
carbon price support mechanism from 
April 2013. Both of these inﬂuences are 
recognised in market forecasts.
We intend to continue our hard work 
to deliver leading operating and cost 
performance and to retain our focus on 
building options to burn advantaged fuel.
With a commitment to delivering value 
to our shareholders, we will continue 
our dialogue with the Government on 
the legislative and regulatory agenda. 
We will continue with our preparations 
to become predominantly biomass 
fuelled. However, our plans are 
dependent upon appropriate regulatory 
support and proving a strong investment 
case. With such, we are ready to make 
a signiﬁcant, timely and cost effective 
contribution to reducing CO2 emissions, 
whilst retaining reliable and ﬂexible 
capacity on the system. 
There is now recognition of the 
strategically important role that 
sustainable biomass has to play in the 
future renewable energy mix of the UK. 
We have long advocated the beneﬁts 
of biomass as a source of renewable 
electricity, key amongst them being the 
ability to deliver cost effective and 
reliable low carbon electricity. Through 
transforming Drax into a predominantly 
renewable generator fuelled by 
sustainable biomass we will not only 
secure large volumes of cost effective 
renewable generation for the consumer, 
but also make a signiﬁcant contribution 
to meeting the UK’s 2020 climate 
change targets.

The aggregate of net merchant sales 
and net Balancing Mechanism activity
Why we measure
Net sales tracks the volume of power we can 
sell at positive margins.
Comment
The increase in power prices following the growth 
in demand for gas in the aftermath of the Japanese 
earthquake, made it economic for us to generate 
more volume in the Summer overnight periods, 
thereby sustaining the high levels of output seen 
in 2010.
Power revenues divided by volume of 
net sales (includes imbalance charges)
Why we measure
The average achieved price of electricity tracks 
the power price component of the dark green 
spread achieved.
Comment
The higher prices achieved in 2011 reﬂect the 
impact of world events on market prices for 
power, as well as our contracted position at 
the start of the year.
Fuel costs excluding carbon divided by 
volume of net sales
Why we measure
The average cost of fuel excluding carbon tracks 
the fuel cost component of the dark green spread 
achieved, and reﬂects the value captured from 
effective fuel procurement and diversiﬁed fuel 
sources.
Comment
Higher volumes of sustainable biomass burn 
and rising coal prices combined to increase our 
average cost of fuel in 2011.
Average percentage of time the units were 
available for generation
Why we measure
Availability tracks our operating performance, 
enabling assessment of, and providing guidance 
for, our operational regime and maintenance 
investment plans. 
Comment
We continue to demonstrate our leadership 
position in the coal-ﬁred generation sector, 
with the impact of enhanced co-ﬁring trials 
marginally lowering 2011 availability.
Why we measure
These injury rate metrics track our health and safety performance and enable us to maintain a 
positive health and safety culture.
Comment
The 2011 LTIR and TRIR represent a record year for health and safety performance at Drax. Our safety 
record continues to be industry-leading and was delivered alongside a signiﬁcant amount of project 
activity. We need to retain focus on this area as we enter a year of double outage.

Why we measure
The average cost of carbon tracks the carbon cost 
component of the dark green spread achieved.
Comment
A large proportion of our 2011 carbon contracts 
were locked in during 2010, when we sold the 
related power. Subsequently carbon prices have 
fallen signiﬁcantly, thereby slightly reducing our 
average cost.
Includes cash and short-term investments, 
less borrowings net of deferred ﬁnance costs
Why we measure
Monitoring net cash/(debt) ensures an efﬁcient 
capital structure is maintained to support our 
business, alongside sufﬁcient liquidity to manage 
our future obligations.
Comment
Despite an increase in working capital, the net 
cash generated exceeded that required to repay 
the term loan and meet dividend payments during 
the year, resulting in an overall increase in net cash.
Tonnes of sustainable biomass fuel burnt 
during the year
Why we measure
Measuring the levels of sustainable biomass 
burnt tracks our progress in producing power 
from renewable and sustainable sources.
Comment
Low levels of support meant that our co-ﬁring 
facility was not used to its full capacity. However, 
the trials undertaken for the research and 
development of enhanced co-ﬁring during the 
year resulted in higher volumes of sustainable 
biomass burnt in 2011 than previous years.
Net sent out generation as a percentage 
of total available generation capacity
Why we measure
Load factor tracks our operating performance 
and the competitiveness of Drax Power Station.
Comment
Stable generation output (net sales) across 
2010 and 2011 resulted in a consistent load factor, 
and reﬂects our competitive position in the 
marketplace and continued high availability.
CO2 emissions rate per unit of output
Why we measure
This measure of carbon emissions illustrates 
our progress in reducing the carbon footprint 
of Drax Power Station.
Comment
The higher levels of sustainable biomass burnt 
through our enhanced co-ﬁring trials, saved 
2 million tonnes of CO2 in the year. Further savings 
were made through the efﬁciency improvements 
resulting from the turbine upgrade project.
Net sales distributed through our retail 
supply arm, Haven Power
Why we measure
A measure of the rate of growth in our retail 
business.
Comment
The growth in retail volumes is driven by 
Haven Power’s planned expansion in the 
industrial and commercial market, supported 
by stable growth in the small and medium 
enterprise customer base.

Our role in the supply chain
Our interests in the electricity supply chain cover the generation, 
wholesale and retail markets.
The UK electricity market
The UK electricity market is 
characterised by six large vertically 
integrated companies and a number 
of smaller “independent” companies. 
Drax is an example of an independent 
company, which until 2009 was solely 
focused on the generation of electricity.
Today, the energy mix of the UK beneﬁts 
from a diversity of fuel sources, including 
gas, coal, nuclear and renewables, which 
is a key contributor to security of supply.
In 2010 (the latest ﬁgures available), the 
generating capacity of the UK’s major 
power producers was some 83,200MW. 
The ﬁnal consumption of electricity in 
2010 was approximately 330TWh.
The six large vertically integrated players 
have control, either through ownership 
or long-term contracts, of some 64% 
of the total generation capacity and have 
a combined interest of over 91% in 
the supply market, and over 99.5% in 
the domestic gas and electricity sector.
Drax has a 5% share in the generation 
capacity market and typically meets 
7% of the UK’s electricity needs. 
Through our retail arm, Haven Power, 
we serve over 40,000 business sites, 
together accounting for sales of 3.3TWh 
of power in 2011. 
From a nationalised, centrally planned system, the UK 
electricity sector has been transformed over the last  
22 years.
Privatisation, liberalisation and energy policy have shaped 
the market and driven increasing consolidation and 
market reform.
Complex arrangements and mechanisms have evolved to 
match the supply and demand of a product which is not 
stored, yet is vital to everyday life.
Wholesale market
Various mechanisms exist to allow  
our power to be traded at the wholesale  
level in Great Britain.
Retail
Haven Power is a retail company serving 
the electricity needs of business 
customers and providing an alternative 
route to market for our power.
Generation
Drax Power Station meets 7% of the UK’s 
electricity needs and is the largest single 
source of renewable power in the UK. There 
are two routes to market for our power.

The wholesale  
electricity market 
Various mechanisms exist to allow power 
to be traded at the wholesale level in 
Great Britain (“GB”). Trading can take 
place via forward and futures markets, 
power exchanges, brokers and bilaterally. 
Power can be traded close to real-time 
and up to several years ahead of delivery. 
It can also be traded for speciﬁc periods, 
for example, speciﬁc half hours or 
speciﬁc seasons. The GB wholesale 
electricity market trades across three 
sub-markets:
 
k long-term forward and futures 
market allowing contracts to be struck 
up to several years ahead of delivery 
in response to market participants’ 
requirements;
 
k short-term bilateral market operated 
over power exchanges which gives 
market participants the opportunity 
to ﬁne tune their contractual positions; 
and
 
k Balancing Mechanism (real-time 
market) through which the System 
Operator accepts offers and bids 
for electricity to enable it to balance 
supply and demand on the system.
Wholesale prices
Power prices are driven by a number of 
factors, such as the underlying commodity 
prices, the availability of capacity on the 
system, and the physical positions taken 
by the individual market players.
The wholesale market operates on 
price and the relative prices of the fuel 
sources, for example, gas and coal will 
determine which plant, gas-ﬁred 
generation or coal-ﬁred generation, 
becomes the marginal plant. If gas prices 
are high then gas-ﬁred plant operates 
at the margin. 
With excellent reliability and availability, 
Drax Power Station is at the top of the 
merit order for UK coal-ﬁred plant and 
so even when coal-ﬁred plant is at the 
margin we will be the ﬁrst of the coal-
ﬁred plants to be called on to generate.
Our trading capability
Our trading team has vast knowledge and 
experience of the markets within which we 
operate. Our trading capability and routes to 
market allow us to manage exposures to the 
commodities in which we deal.

Commodity markets 
A number of signiﬁcant global events 
during 2011 have impacted to increase 
uncertainty in the commodity markets 
in which we operate. 
The price of oil is a key driver of 
wholesale price. In mainland Europe, 
gas prices are linked under contract to 
oil prices, and given that the UK imports 
a signiﬁcant amount of gas and that gas 
is used to generate around 45% of the 
UK electricity, any changes in wholesale 
gas prices will impact wholesale 
electricity prices.
The trends in commodity prices 
witnessed in 2010 and 2011 are 
described further in the following 
paragraphs and are illustrated in 
the accompanying charts.
Gas
The unrest in North Africa and the 
Middle East during the ﬁrst half of 2011 
put upward pressure on oil markets 
despite fears of an economic downturn. 
This in turn drove up gas prices which 
were then further strengthened by 
the increase in demand following the 
Japanese earthquake, and Germany’s 
decision to close its older nuclear plants. 
The Japanese earthquake reduced 
market perceptions of liqueﬁed natural 
gas (“LNG”) availability.
Gas prices held during the Summer, 
before softening during the ﬁnal quarter 
of the year as demand was far lower than 
market expectation as a result of the mild 
winter experienced in the UK and Europe. 
This was compounded by the Eurozone 
crisis which further reduced gas demand. 
LNG and shale gas remain key drivers 
of the long-term gas markets. Shale gas 
is largely a US phenomenon in the 
near-term. Horizontal drilling technology 
has advanced, but research papers 
remain divided on the marginal cost 
and available volumes at the lower end 
of the cost scale. However, the US has 
signiﬁcant reserves that could enable 
it to become relatively self sufﬁcient. 
This could reduce its LNG requirements, 
freeing up more volume for the Asian 
and European markets depending 
on their relative market price. In the 
longer term, other countries such as 
China may also exploit potentially large 
shale gas reserves.

Carbon prices remained fairly ﬂat at 
the start of 2011 before rising in the 
immediate aftermath of the Japanese 
earthquake. Prices dropped sharply in 
the second half of 2011, reaching two year 
lows in late November amid fears for the 
Eurozone economies. With any Phase II 
surplus bankable into Phase III, pricing 
seems largely driven by political and 
macroeconomic factors, such as the 
renewable generation build rate and the 
pace of economic recovery.
Biomass
Types of biomass
Biomass used in energy production 
comes in many different forms, but the 
important characteristics shared by the 
wide range of biomass fuels are that they 
can be renewable and can be sustainable 
and that they would often be discarded 
if not used to produce energy.
The three common types of biomass 
used to generate electricity are 
agricultural residues, forestry products 
and residues, and energy crops. 
Recovered materials offer another, 
very useful, source of biomass.
Agricultural residues 
The by-products of food production, such 
as straw, oat husks, peanut husks, grape 
ﬂour, cocoa shells, olive cake and many 
more, can all be used as biomass for 
energy production. Importantly, because 
they are by-products of food production 
they do not reduce the amount of land 
available for farming, and they are readily 
available. Residues from non-food crops, 
such as cork ﬁnes, can also be used. 
By placing a value on what may be an 
unwanted by-product of farming, the use 
of biomass to produce energy provides 
a new income stream for farmers and 
supports UK farming.
Forestry products and residues 
Sustainably produced woody biomass 
can be produced from managed forests 
and forestry residues, such as bark, 
thinnings, tree tops and branches that 
are often discarded after trees are felled 
for timber.
Energy crops 
These are crops that are planted 
speciﬁcally for the purpose of producing 
energy. Energy crops include short 
rotation coppice willow and miscanthus, 
commonly known as elephant grass. 
Since the start of the UK’s Energy Crop 
Scheme in 2000, thousands of hectares 
of miscanthus and other short rotation 
coppice crops have been planted in the 
UK alone and there is the potential to 
increase this.
Recovered materials 
Recovered wood is an example of a 
material that could be used as a biomass 
fuel. The construction and demolition 
sectors are very large producers of 
recoverable wood. 
Availability of biomass
Biomass is a diverse, readily available 
and plentiful fuel source. According 
to the International Energy Agency, 
biomass is the fourth largest energy 
resource in the world after oil, coal 
and gas. It estimates that by 2050, 
sustainable sources of biomass could be 
enough to supply the world with 10%-
20% of its primary energy requirements.
The EU has indicated that the use of 
biomass will double over the next few 
years, and be responsible for around 
a half of the total effort in reaching the 
EU’s 20% renewable energy target by 
2020. In the UK, AEA Technology has 
estimated that by 2020 sustainable 
biomass could meet 20% of our primary 
energy demand and by 2030 this could 
more than double or even treble.
Biomass procurement
Our biomass is procured against our 
industry-leading sustainability policy which is 
independently audited. We are in our ﬁfth year 
of monitoring the carbon footprint of all the 
biomass we burn.
However, developments outside the 
US are in their infancy and will, therefore, 
have little impact in the short- to medium-
term. Furthermore, demand for gas 
is rising rapidly so that even with the 
possibility of increased shale gas 
production, global markets may well 
remain strong. 
Power
During 2010, power demand was 
relatively stable. There was a small 
increase in demand in the ﬁrst quarter 
of the year, and demand reached 
record levels in December, although 
on both occasions this was most likely 
a result of the unseasonably cold 
weather. To balance this, on the supply 
side signiﬁcant new gas-ﬁred capacity 
came on line and there were some 
plant closures. 
Power prices continued to be driven 
by the gas market during 2011, increasing 
over the ﬁrst half of the year, before 
stabilising and then dropping in the 
ﬁnal quarter as gas prices weakened. 
Coal
Following a continued period of price 
stability through the ﬁrst half of 2010, 
coal prices increased signiﬁcantly in the 
ﬁnal months of the year. This reﬂected 
tightening in the Paciﬁc market with 
severe weather causing constraints 
on production in Australia, Indonesia 
and Colombia. In addition, strong 
Asian demand for Atlantic coal, 
particularly from China, continued 
to support EU prices.
Asian demand continued to inﬂuence 
the global steam coal market during 2011. 
China is the most signiﬁcant player in 
this market with current consumption 
estimates at 2 billion tonnes per annum. 
US exports to Europe were circa 150% 
higher year on year for the ﬁrst half of 
2011 due to increased German demand 
following the closure of its older nuclear 
plant, and relatively high gas prices 
across the continent. Prices reduced 
slightly towards the end of the year as 
a result of lower demand levels during 
the mild winter. 
Carbon
Carbon prices traded in a fairly narrow 
range throughout 2010, with a small 
increase experienced in the second half 
of the year.

Operational and ﬁnancial performance
Introduction
EBITDA was £334 million for the year ended 31 December 2011 
compared to £392 million in 2010 and underlying basic earnings 
per share were 56 pence compared to 64 pence last year. 
Our 2011 proﬁt is in line with expectations, which increased during 
the year with an improvement in the trading environment, 
although commodity prices did soften towards the end of the 
period. Earnings were below 2010 levels, which beneﬁted from 
the accelerated hedge which we put in place during 2008 when 
wholesale margins were higher. We have continued to exercise 
tight control over our cost base and our spend on capital projects. 
2011 was a record year for health and safety performance at Drax 
and we have been supported by strong operational performance. 
Our retail business, Haven Power Limited (“Haven Power”), 
is meeting our growth expectations, with sales of 3.3TWh 
compared to 1.4TWh in 2010, largely as a result of the planned 
growth in its industrial and commercial (“I&C”) customer base, 
along with a continued increase in the volumes sold to the small 
and medium enterprise market (“SME”).
In April, we were pleased to report that we had reached 
agreement with HMRC over the Eurobond tax position, resulting 
in cash tax relief of £180 million. This has enabled us to release 
£148 million of cash to the business so far, with a further 
£32 million to follow over the coming years as we utilise 
the remaining losses. 
In July, we completed the reﬁnancing of our letter of credit, 
working capital and term loan facilities, which were due to mature 
in December 2012. These facilities were replaced by a £310 million 
revolving credit facility, maturing in April 2014, with the term loan 
repaid in full out of cash on hand. 
At the upcoming Annual General Meeting, the Board will 
recommend a ﬁnal dividend for 2011 of 11.8 pence per share, 
taking total dividends for the year to 27.8 pence per share, 
or £101 million.
This review includes further explanation and commentary in 
relation to our principal performance indicators and the results 
for the year.

Revenue
Total generation revenue for the 
year ended 31 December 2011 was 
£1,735 million compared to £1,596 million 
in 2010. Total generation revenue in 2011 
includes power sales of £1,641 million 
(2010: £1,528 million), ROC and LEC 
sales of £69 million (2010: £25 million), 
ancillary services income of £17 million 
(2010: £35 million) and other income 
of £8 million (2010: £8 million).
Higher power sales in 2011 resulted from 
an increase in the average wholesale 
achieved electricity price for the year 
ended 31 December 2011 to £55.6 per 
MWh, compared to £51.6 per MWh in 
2010. Our average achieved price of 
electricity reﬂects our contracted 
position, as well as higher power prices 
on average during the year as a whole, 
but particularly in the ﬁrst half when 
markets felt the impact of the Japanese 
earthquake and the unrest in North 
Africa and the Middle East. Net power 
sold was 26.4TWh in both 2011 and 2010. 
ROC and LEC sales have increased from 
£25 million in 2010 to £69 million in 2011 
as a result of an increase in sustainable 
biomass burn during 2010, which 
increased the number of ROCs available 
for sale during 2011. In addition, we have 
sold a number of current compliance 
period ROCs, thereby beneﬁting earlier 
than usual from sustainable biomass 
burnt during 2011. 
Ancillary services income includes 
revenue from the Firm Frequency 
Response contracts in place with National 
Grid during 2010. Whilst these contracts 
gave us certainty of income and more 
predictable despatch during the Summer 
months in 2010, their beneﬁt was 
somewhat offset by the fact that we had 
less potential to proﬁt from the Balancing 
Mechanism, where we add value through 
the plant’s ﬂexibility and reliability. 
For 2011, whilst we had no contract 
in place with National Grid, we have 
continued to play a key role supporting 
the system, and earning appropriate 
margins from these activities. 
Other income includes the sale of 
by-products (ash and gypsum). 
Fuel costs (coal, sustainable biomass 
and other fuels)
Fuel costs were £1,021 million in 2011, 
compared to £841 million in 2010. 
The average cost of fuel per MWh 
(excluding CO2 emissions allowances) was 
£33.3 for the year ended 31 December 
2011, compared to £25.7 in 2010. The 
increase in average fuel prices was driven 
by fuel mix, in particular higher sustainable 
biomass burn following the research and 
development work described in the Chief 
Executive’s statement and by commodity 
price movements, especially coal. 
We burnt approximately 9.1 million tonnes 
of coal in the year ended 31 December 
2011, compared to approximately 
9.4 million tonnes in 2010. This coal was 
purchased from a variety of domestic 
and international sources under either 
ﬁxed or variable priced contracts with 
different maturities. Coal represented 
around 87% of total fuel burnt (by heat 
content) in 2011 and 88% in 2010. 
In 2011, we burnt 1.3 million tonnes of 
sustainable biomass (2010: 0.9 million 
tonnes) representing 9% of total fuel 
burnt by heat content (2010: 6%). 
This increase is a result of the research 
and development work described in the 
Chief Executive’s statement. We also 
burnt 0.1 million tonnes of petcoke (2010: 
0.2 million tonnes) and 0.6 million tonnes 
of pond ﬁnes (2010: 0.4 million tonnes). 
Our petcoke burn volume is driven by 
its pricing relative to coal. Pond ﬁnes 
is a coal mining residue, which trades 
at a signiﬁcant discount to coal, and 
requires speciﬁc blending and handling 
techniques to burn in large volumes. 
The increases in our sustainable biomass 
and pond ﬁnes burn in 2011, demonstrate 
further improvements in our ability to 
manage a wider fuel mix. 
Fuel costs (CO2 emissions allowances)
For Phase II of the EU ETS (2008–2012), 
Drax has an allocation of 9.5 million 
tonnes of CO2 emissions allowances per 
annum under the UK NAP. We purchase 
CO2 emissions allowances under ﬁxed 
price contracts with different maturity 
dates from a variety of domestic and 
international sources.
Our CO2 emissions allowances 
requirement for the year ended 
31 December 2011, in excess of those 
allocated under the UK NAP, was 
approximately 11.9 million tonnes 
compared to approximately 12.9 million 
tonnes in 2010. This was a result of plant 
efﬁciency improvements and higher 
levels of sustainable biomass burn 
than in 2010, to achieve the same 
level of generation.

Our average price of carbon is a function 
of the timing of purchases under ﬁxed 
price contracts in the forward and 
near-term markets. The average price 
expensed for purchased CO2 emissions 
allowances during the year ended 
31 December 2011 was £12.0 per tonne 
compared to £12.6 per tonne in 2010. 
The majority of our 2011 carbon 
requirement was contracted during 
2010 and the ﬁrst half of 2011 when 
prices were higher than in the second 
half of 2011 (see Commodity markets). 
This is in line with our hedging strategy 
to purchase carbon when we sell the 
related power.
Cost of power purchases
We purchase power in the market when 
the cost of power in the market is below 
our marginal cost of production in 
respect of power previously contracted 
for generation and delivery by us, and 
to cover any shortfall in generation. 
For the year ended 31 December 2011, 
the cost of purchased power for the 
generation business was £172 million, 
compared to £165 million incurred in 
2010, as a result of the higher power 
prices in 2011 as described in 
Commodity markets. 
Grid charges
Grid charges for generation for 
the year ended 31 December 2011 were 
£58 million, compared to £54 million 
in the year ended 31 December 2010. 
The slight increase resulted from an 
increase in the £/MWh charged by 
National Grid reﬂecting the impact 
of additional variable generation, such 
as wind turbines, on their costs to 
balance the system. 
Cost of power purchases
Retail cost of power purchases 
were £171 million for the year ended 
31 December 2011 compared to 
£71 million for the year ended 
31 December 2010. Haven Power 
purchases power in the wholesale 
market for delivery to its retail customers. 
The vast majority of these purchases 
are from Drax Power Limited and are 
eliminated on a group basis. The increase 
in retail cost of power purchases is a 
result of the signiﬁcant increase in sales 
volumes and power prices. 
Grid charges
Haven Power incurred £60 million 
of grid charges during the year ended 
31 December 2011 and £28 million 
during the year ended 31 December 2010. 
Charges have increased as a result of 
higher sales volumes together with 
substantial increases in the rates charged 
by the distribution network operators. 
Other retail costs
Other retail costs include broker fees, 
ROCs, LECs and metering and 
were £29 million in the year ended 
31 December 2011, compared to 
£11 million in 2010. In addition to higher 
volumes, costs have increased in 2011 due 
to the much larger than expected uptake 
of the subsidy for solar photovoltaic 
panels, which has resulted in very large 
increases to the FiT levelisation costs 
being charged to suppliers. 
Retail gross proﬁt for the year ended 
31 December 2011 was £16 million 
compared to £15 million in 2010. 
Although sales volumes have increased 
signiﬁcantly, margins within the I&C 
market remain relatively low. 
Operating and administrative expenses
Retail operating and administrative 
expenses excluding depreciation and 
amortisation were £19 million for the year 
ended 31 December 2011, £3 million 
higher than for 2010. The increase largely 
relates to staff costs following the growth 
in the business and certain entry costs 
into the I&C market. 
As a result, retail EBITDA for both the 
years ended 31 December 2011 and 
2010 was a loss of £2 million. 
We remain on track to achieve our target 
of break even EBITDA for this business 
from 2013. 
Biomass research and development 
work
The biomass research and development 
work described in the Chief Executive’s 
statement cost around £19 million in 2011. 
This includes £11 million within generation 
gross margin (the impact of burning 
uneconomic biomass principally), 
operating costs of £3 million (e.g. expert 
technical advice in relation to biomass 
combustion and chemistry) and capital 
investment of £5 million (new conveyors 
and fuel handling infrastructure). 
We believe this work has placed Drax 
in the best possible position to deliver 
a step change as quickly and efﬁciently 
as possible in the volumes of sustainable 
biomass we burn, if support is at an 
appropriate level. 
As a result of these factors, generation 
gross proﬁt for the year ended 
31 December 2011 was £484 million 
compared to £536 million in 2010. 
Operating and administrative expenses
Generation other operating and 
administrative expenses before 
depreciation and amortisation were 
£148 million for the year ended 
31 December 2011, compared to 
£143 million in 2010. The cost increase 
of £5 million largely reﬂects the 
biomass investment in research and 
development work described above. 
Generation EBITDA for the year ended 
31 December 2011 was, therefore, 
£336 million compared to £393 million 
in 2010.
Retail results
Revenue
Retail revenue of £276 million for the 
year ended 31 December 2011 was 123% 
higher than the revenue of £124 million 
for the year ended 31 December 2010. 
This substantial growth is in line with 
our strategy to grow Haven Power, 
with retail sales being a credit efﬁcient 
alternative to selling power in the 
wholesale market. The growth in 
sales has been secured at satisfactory 
margins and good credit quality. 
Retail sales volumes have increased from 
1.4TWh in the year ended 31 December 
2010 to 3.3TWh in 2011 following planned 
growth in the I&C customer base and 
continued growth in SME customer 
volumes.

was £57 million for the year ended 
31 December 2011 and £52 million for 
the year ended 31 December 2010. 
2011 includes a full year of depreciation 
for the co-ﬁring facility, which was 
commissioned part-way through 2010. 
Unrealised gains and losses on 
derivative contracts
The Group recognises unrealised gains 
and losses on forward contracts which 
meet the deﬁnition of derivatives under 
IFRSs. Where possible, we take the own 
use exemption for derivative contracts 
entered into and held for our own 
purchase, sale or usage requirements, 
including forward domestic coal and 
biomass contracts. 
As such, the movement in the net 
unrealised gains and losses recognised in 
the balance sheet principally relate to the 
mark-to-market of our forward contracts 
for power. The following table shows 
the movements in unrealised gains and 
losses and where they are recorded in 
our ﬁnancial statements.

The trends in forward power prices, 
which largely determine the movements 
in our net unrealised gains and losses 
position are described within the 
Commodity markets section. 
During 2010, power prices increased, 
such that the difference between power 
that had been contracted but had yet to 
be delivered and the market price had 
narrowed considerably at 31 December 
2010, reducing the unrealised gain in the 
balance sheet. In addition, following a 
period of coal price stability during the 
ﬁrst half of 2010, prices increased 
signiﬁcantly in the ﬁnal months of the 
year, driving an increase in the unrealised 
losses on our ﬁnancial coal contracts, 
which expose us to ﬂoating prices. 
Together these factors resulted in an 
unrealised loss in the balance sheet of 
£61 million at 31 December 2010. 
During 2011, power prices fell signiﬁcantly 
in the ﬁnal quarter. As a result, the 
average price of power that had been 
contracted but had yet to be delivered 
at 31 December 2011 was higher than 
market prices, driving an increase in 
the unrealised gain in the balance sheet. 
Coal prices also continued to rise during 
the ﬁrst quarter of 2011, before stabilising 
over the remainder of the year. A number 
of the ﬁnancial coal contracts in place 
at 31 December 2010 unwound during 
the year as the contracts matured, 
thereby reducing the unrealised losses 
at 31 December 2011. 
This combination of factors drove the 
recognition of an unrealised gain of 
£31 million in the balance sheet at 
31 December 2011. 
The unrealised gains recognised in 
the income statement of £90 million 
for the year ended 31 December 2011 and 
unrealised losses of £61 million in 2010 
arise from mark-to-market movements 
on our derivative contracts which do not 
qualify for hedge accounting; largely 
ﬁnancial coal and foreign exchange. 
Mark-to-market movements on most of 
our derivative contracts, considered to be 
effective hedges, have been recognised 
through the hedge reserve, a component 
of shareholders’ equity in the balance 
sheet. Movements in unrealised gains 
and losses recognised in the hedge 
reserve are mainly the result of 
unwinding mark-to-market positions 
relating to power delivered during a 
reporting period, and the recording of 
mark-to-market positions on power yet 
to be delivered at the end of that period. 
The net unrealised gain recognised 
through the hedge reserve in the year 
ended 31 December 2011 was £3 million, 
compared to net unrealised losses of 
£233 million in 2010.
In considering mark-to-market 
movements, it is important to recognise 
that proﬁtability is driven by our strategy 
to deliver market level dark green 
spreads, not by the absolute price of 
electricity at any given date.
After allowing for the unrealised gains 
and losses on derivative contracts, 
depreciation and amortisation, 
operating proﬁt for the year ended 
31 December 2011 was £366 million 
compared to £279 million in 2010. 
Interest
Net ﬁnance costs for the year ended 
31 December 2011 were £28 million 
compared with £24 million in 2010. 
The unwind of deferred ﬁnance costs 
in relation to our previous bank facilities 
was accelerated to reﬂect their 
reduced term following the reﬁnancing 
(see Capital resources and reﬁnancing). 
This resulted in a one-time interest 
charge of £3 million in the year to 
31 December 2011. 
Tax
The tax charge before exceptional items 
for the year ended 31 December 2011 
was £71 million (an effective rate of 
21%), compared to £67 million in 2010 
(an effective rate of 26%). Tax for 2011 
includes the impact of the reduction 
in corporation tax rate from April 2011 
on current and deferred tax liabilities and 
of the reduction in corporation tax rate 
from April 2012 on deferred tax liabilities.
Under the Group’s previous ﬁnancing 
structure, a subsidiary company was 
partially funded by a Eurobond payable 
to another group company, which 
was unwound in 2008, potentially 
accelerating additional tax losses with 
a cash tax beneﬁt of up to £220 million. 
The Group began utilising these 
potential losses in 2008, with cash 
saved notionally ring-fenced, and no 
beneﬁt recognised prior to agreement 
with HMRC. 
In April 2011, we reached agreement 
with HMRC over the Eurobond tax 
position which will result in the release 
of £180 million cash tax relief. As at 
31 December 2011, we had released 
£148 million of cash saved to date to 
the business and will release a further 
£32 million over the coming years 
as we utilise the remaining losses. 
The exceptional tax credit of £198 million 
includes full recognition of the Eurobond 
settlement of £180 million and a further 
£18 million in relation to other legacy 
issues, being the release of historic tax 
provisions no longer required following 
settlement of these issues. 
As a result of the above factors, proﬁt 
attributable to equity shareholders for 
the year ended 31 December 2011 was 
£465 million compared to £188 million 
in 2010, and basic and diluted earnings 
per share were 127 pence and 
126 pence respectively, compared 
to 52 pence in 2010.

Notes:
(1)  The forced outage rate is expressed as a percentage of 
planned capacity available (that is, it includes a reduction for 
planned losses). The planned outage rate is expressed as a 
percentage of registered capacity. Accordingly, the 
aggregation of the forced outage rate and planned outage rate 
will not equate to the total outage rate.
The load factor and electrical output 
were 79.7% and 26.4TWh respectively 
for both years ended 31 December 2011 
and 2010. We continued to demonstrate 
our leadership position in the coal-ﬁred 
generation sector with plant 
availability of 88.4% for the year 
ended 31 December 2011, compared 
to 92.1% in 2010. 
The forced outage and Winter forced 
outage rates for the year ended 
31 December 2011 were 5.8% and 3.9% 
respectively, compared to 3.4% and 
2.4% in 2010 which was a record year. 
2011 forced outage rate remains 
consistent with our long-term target 
of circa 5%. 
The planned outage rate achieved for the 
year ended 31 December 2011 was 6.2%, 
compared to 4.6% in 2010, with one 
major planned outage completed in both 
years. Our maintenance regime includes 
a major planned outage for each of 
our six units once every four years. 
Consequently, there is an irregular 
pattern to planned outages and 
associated expenditure, since in two 
of the four years two units will each 
undergo a major planned outage. 
Two units will undergo a major planned 
outage in 2012. 
Health and safety
2011 was a record year for Drax in terms 
of our health and safety performance. 
Our lost time injury rate and total 
recordable injury rate were 0.08 and 
0.10 respectively for the year ended 
31 December 2011 compared to 0.13 and 
0.26 respectively in 2010. Our safety 
record continues to be industry-leading 
and was delivered alongside a signiﬁcant 
amount of project activity. We continue 
with our commitment to deliver a positive 
health and safety culture. 
Liquidity and capital resources
Net cash was £225 million as at 
31 December 2011, compared to 
£204 million at 31 December 2010, 
following the reﬁnancing in July 2011, 
and the repayment of £135 million 
of borrowings (see Capital resources 
and reﬁnancing). Cash and short-term 
deposits were £233 million as at 
31 December 2011, compared to 
£331 million at 31 December 2010. 
An analysis of cash ﬂows for both 
years is set out in the following table.

Cash generated from operations 
was £282 million in the year ended 
31 December 2011, compared to 
£485 million in 2010. The decrease was 
largely the result of a fall of £58 million 
in EBITDA and a working capital outﬂow 
of £51 million in 2011, compared to 
an inﬂow of £115 million in 2010.
The working capital outﬂow of £51 million 
in 2011 includes an increase of £24 million 
in the value of coal stocks, resulting from 
an additional 0.2 million tonnes of stock 
held at the end of 2011, and higher coal 
prices during the period (see Fuel costs – 
coal, sustainable biomass and other fuels). 
The remaining net outﬂow includes 
a lower carbon creditor (£21 million), 
reﬂecting the timings of payments 
with respect to our 2011 liability and a 
fall in the cost of carbon over the year (see 
Fuel costs – CO2 emissions allowances). 
The working capital inﬂow in 2010 largely 
reﬂects a decrease in coal stocks of 
1.6 million tonnes (£84 million), resulting 
from higher than expected generation 
over the corresponding period. 
Income taxes paid were £68 million in the 
year ended 31 December 2011, compared 
to £56 million in 2010. 2011 payments 
include settlement of the 2010 liability, 
as well as payments on account for 2011.

Net cash ﬂows from investing activities 
includes payments in respect of capital 
expenditure of £44 million for the year 
ended 31 December 2011 and £62 million 
in 2010 (see Capital expenditure). 
2011 includes a reduction in short-term 
investments of £65 million (2010: 
additional £40 million), comprising 
short-term deposits with a maturity of 
more than three months at inception. 
Net cash used in ﬁnancing activities 
was £253 million in the year ended 
31 December 2011, compared to 
£153 million in 2010. The 2011 amount 
includes equity dividends paid of 
£124 million and term loan repayments 
of £135 million, net of new borrowings 
of £10 million drawn down against the 
revolving credit facility. The 2010 
amount includes equity dividends paid 
of £87 million and term loan repayments 
of £65 million (see Capital resources 
and reﬁnancing). 
The decrease in cash and cash 
equivalents was therefore £33 million 
in the year ended 31 December 2011, 
compared to an increase of £156 million 
in 2010. The Group’s policy is to invest 
available cash in short-term bank, 
building society or other low risk 
deposits.
Capital resources and reﬁnancing
In July 2011, we completed the 
reﬁnancing of our letter of credit, 
working capital and term loan facilities, 
which were due to mature in December 
2012. These facilities were replaced with 
a £310 million revolving credit facility 
which matures in April 2014, and which 
can be used for both letters of credit and 
working capital purposes. The margin 
over LIBOR on our new facility has 
reduced from 3.5% to 2%. 
Scheduled debt repayments of 
£34 million were made at 30 June 2011 
and the remaining term loan balance 
of £101 million was repaid in full upon 
reﬁnancing. During 2010 scheduled debt 
repayments were £65 million. 
The unwind of the deferred ﬁnance 
costs in relation to the previous banking 
facilities has been accelerated to reﬂect 
their reduced term, resulting in a 
one-time interest charge of £3 million 
in the year to 31 December 2011. 
£10 million has been drawn down against 
the new revolving credit facility during 
the year and remained in place at 
31 December 2011. 
Going concern
The Group’s business activities, together 
with the factors likely to affect future 
developments, performance and position 
including principal risks and uncertainties 
are set out in this Business review. 
Our cash ﬂows and borrowing facilities 
are described above. In addition, note 19 
to the consolidated ﬁnancial statements 
includes our approach to capital risk 
management, details on ﬁnancial 
instruments and hedging activities, 
and exposure to credit, counterparty 
and liquidity risk. 
We have signiﬁcant headroom in our 
banking facilities, and a recent history 
of cash generation, strong covenant 
compliance, and good visibility 
in near-term forecasts, due to 
our progressive hedging strategy. 
Our Business Plan, taking account of 
reasonably possible changes in trading 
performance, shows that we should be 
able to operate within the level of our 
current banking facilities. 
Accordingly, the directors have a 
reasonable expectation that the Group 
has adequate resources to continue in 
operational existence for the foreseeable 
future, and continue to adopt the going 
concern basis of accounting when 
preparing these ﬁnancial statements. 
Seasonality of borrowing
Our business is seasonal with higher 
electricity prices and despatch in the 
Winter period and lower despatch in the 
Summer months, when prices are lower 
and plant availability is affected by 
planned outages.
Accordingly, cash ﬂow during the 
Summer months is materially reduced 
due to the combined effect of lower 
prices and output, while maintenance 
expenditures are increased during this 
period due to major planned outages. 
The Group’s £310 million revolving credit 
facility assists in managing the cash 
low points in the cycle where required. 
See Capital resources and reﬁnancing. 
Capital expenditure
Fixed asset additions were £45 million 
in the year ended 31 December 2011, 
compared to £59 million in 2010. 
This includes expenditure of £8 million 
(£20 million in 2010) on our major 
strategic carbon abatement project, 
the turbine upgrade, and £5 million of 
expenditure on new conveyors and fuel 
handling infrastructure in support of 
our biomass research and development 
work (2010: £nil). 
In relation to the turbine upgrade project, 
we expect to invest up to £100 million 
to upgrade the high pressure and low 
pressure turbine modules on all six 
generating units to improve efﬁciency 
(see Corporate and social responsibility, 
Tackling climate change). With a double 
unit outage scheduled for 2012, the 
turbine upgrade programme will be 
completed. Expenditure remains in line 
with budget. 
We will continue to evaluate other 
investment opportunities which may 
result in additional capital expenditure 
(see Chief Executive’s statement 
Strategic capital investment plan). 
Creditor payment policy and practice
Terms of payment are agreed with 
suppliers when negotiating each 
transaction and the Group’s policy is 
to abide by those terms and pay 
creditors  when sums owing fall due for 
payment, provided that the suppliers 
also comply with all relevant terms and 
conditions. Drax Group plc, the parent 
company of the Group, has no trade 
creditors. In respect of Group activities, 
the amounts due to trade creditors 
at 31 December 2011 represented 
approximately 22 days of average 
daily purchases through the year 
(2010: 21 days). The ﬁgure is based 
upon the ratio of amounts owed to 
trade creditors against the amounts 
the Group was invoiced by suppliers 
during the ﬁnancial year.

Future developments 
Strategic capital investment plan
The Chief Executive’s statement 
describes how preparation for our 
biomass expansion is now well advanced. 
Whilst moving ahead with our plans 
remains dependent on securing 
appropriate regulatory support and on 
proving a strong investment case, we 
have also made good progress with the 
work to scope out the capital investment 
plan for the project. The principal 
components of the plan include potential 
investments in development of the 
Drax site biomass capacity, the biomass 
supply chain, and in Industrial Emissions 
Directive (“IED”) compliance. 
£m
Committed investment:
Biomass capacity development (Phase 1) 
– secure full beneﬁt from existing 
co-ﬁring facilities

Dependent on appropriate ROC support  
and strong investment case:
Biomass capacity development (Phase 2) 
– increase Drax site capacity to 
predominantly biomass

– pellet plants to provide 
fuel security
£150m–£200m
IED compliance 
– estimate of plant retroﬁt cost 
c. £200m
Net cash at December 2011
£225m
More information on the various 
components of the capital investment 
plan can be found in the Chief Executive’s 
statement. 
It is important to recognise that if 
we are in a position to progress, our 
strong balance sheet, with net cash of 
£225 million at year end, provides a good 
foundation for our funding requirements. 
Positions under contract for 2012, 
2013 and 2014
We continue to follow our stated trading 
strategy of making steady forward power 
sales with corresponding purchases of 
CO2 emissions allowances and fuel 
purchases. Our aim is to deliver market 
level dark green spreads across all traded 
market periods and, as part of this 
strategy, we retain power to be sold into 
the prompt (within season) power markets.
As at 15 February 2012, the positions 
under contract for 2012, 2013 and 2014 
were as follows:

baseload contract which commenced on 
1 October 2007 and the ﬁve year 300MW 
baseload contract which commenced 
on 1 October 2010, both with Centrica.
Fixed margin power sales include 
approximately 6.9TWh in 2012, 
and 2.6TWh both in 2013 and 2014 
in connection with the above contracts.
Under these contracts the Group will 
supply power on terms which include 
Centrica paying for coal, based on 
international coal prices, and delivering 
matching CO2 emissions allowances 
amounting in aggregate to approximately 
7.2 million tonnes in 2012, and 
approximately 2.4 million tonnes 
in both 2013 and 2014. 
The contracts provide the Group with a 
series of ﬁxed dark green spreads, with 
the spreads in the ﬁrst contract having 
been agreed in the ﬁrst quarter of 2006 
and those in the second contract having 
been agreed in October 2009. 
Distributions
Distribution policy
Subject to the provisions of the 
Companies Act, the Group may by 
ordinary resolution from time to time 
declare dividends not exceeding the 
amount recommended by the Board. 
The Board may pay interim dividends 
whenever the ﬁnancial position of the 
Group, in the opinion of the Board, 
justiﬁes the payment.
The Board has previously committed 
to a pay-out ratio of 50% of underlying 
earnings (being proﬁt attributable to 
equity shareholders adjusted to exclude 
the after tax impact of unrealised gains 
and losses on derivative contracts, 
and exceptional items) in each year. 
Underlying earnings per share were 
56 pence on this basis for the year 
ended 31 December 2011. 
Dividends paid 
On 21 February 2011, the Board resolved, 
subject to approval by shareholders at 
the Annual General Meeting (“AGM”) 
on 13 April 2011, to pay a ﬁnal dividend 
for the year ended 31 December 2010 
of 17.9 pence per share (£65 million). 
The ﬁnal dividend was subsequently 
paid on 13 May 2011.
On 1 August 2011, the Board resolved 
to pay an interim dividend for the 
six months ended 30 June 2011 of 
16.0 pence per share (£58 million), 
representing 50% of underlying earnings 
for the period. The interim dividend was 
subsequently paid on 14 October 2011.
Dividends proposed
At the forthcoming AGM the Board 
will recommend to shareholders that a 
resolution is passed to approve payment 
of a ﬁnal dividend for the year ended 
31 December 2011 of 11.8 pence per 
share (£43 million), payable on or 
before 11 May 2012. Shares will be 
marked ex-dividend on 25 April 2012.
This Business review was approved by 
the Board on 20 February 2012.

“The reﬁnancing and conclusion of 
the Eurobond tax structure have both 
given us a strong platform on which 
to grow the business. We had net cash

Maintain an optimal supporting capital structure
Reﬁnancing 
In July 2011, 
we completed the 
reﬁnancing of our 
bank facilities. These 
were replaced by a 
£310 million revolving 
credit facility which 
matures in April 2014.
Eurobond 
In April 2011, we reached 
agreement with HMRC 
over the Eurobond tax

Principal risks and uncertainties
The effective management of risks within the Group 
underpins the delivery of our key priorities. The Group has 
a comprehensive structure of governance controls in place 
to manage risks. Policies have been established in key areas 
of the business such as trading, treasury, production and 
health and safety to ensure that these risks are managed 
in a controlled manner and in accordance with the Board’s 
appetite for risk.
Internal control and 
risk management
The Board is responsible for the Group’s 
system of internal control and for 
reviewing its effectiveness. A process 
has been established for identifying, 
evaluating and managing the signiﬁcant 
risks faced by the Group and this 
has been in place for the year under 
review up to the date of approval of 
the 2011 Annual report and accounts. 
The process is designed to manage 
rather than eliminate the risk of failure 
to achieve business objectives, and can 
only provide reasonable, not absolute, 
assurance against material misstatement 
or loss.
Risk management committees
There are ﬁve risk management 
committees:
1 Treasury and commodity risk 
management committee
2 Safety, health, environmental and 
production integrity committee
3 New business risk management 
committee
4 Corporate risk management 
committee
5 Haven Power risk management 
committee
Each Committee is responsible for 
ensuring that all risks associated with 
their speciﬁc area of the business are 
identiﬁed, analysed and managed 
systematically and appropriately. 
Each Committee has terms of reference 
that requires it to ensure that systems 
and controls are approved, implemented 
and monitored to ensure that activities 
are commensurate with the risk appetite 
established by the Board, are adequately 
resourced and comply with applicable 
legal and regulatory requirements. 
Each risk committee contains at least 
one member of the Executive Committee.

Risk management process
The key elements of the risk 
management process are as follows:
Risk identiﬁcation – risks faced by 
the Group are identiﬁed during the 
formulation of the Business Plan. 
Senior management and risk owners, 
with the assistance of the risk 
management committees, periodically 
review the risks to ensure that the risk 
management processes and controls in 
their area are appropriate and effective, 
and that new risks are identiﬁed. 
Risk analysis – the basic causes of each 
risk are considered, and the impact and 
likelihood of its materialising is assessed. 
Risk registers are used to document 
the risks identiﬁed, level of severity and 
probability, ownership and mitigation 
measures for each risk. The risk registers 
are reviewed by the risk management 
committees on a quarterly basis. 
Risks are then logged with reference 
to impact and probability as follows:
Risk appetite is identiﬁed by reference 
to the same criteria. The analysis enables 
decisions to be taken as to how that 
risk should be managed by applying 
mitigation measures to align the risk 
with the identiﬁed risk appetite. 
Risk monitoring and assurance – 
the Board is ultimately responsible for 
this system of risk management and 
internal control. The Audit Committee 
reviews ﬁnancial information and the 
suitability of internal controls on behalf 
of the Board. Risk management 
committees assist the executive directors 
in the operation and implementation of 
the risk management process, and 
provide a source of assurance to the 
Audit Committee that the process is 
operating effectively.
Internal control
In addition, the Group has comprehensive 
and well deﬁned control policies with 
clear structures, delegated authority 
levels and accountabilities.
The Group has a system of planning and 
monitoring, which incorporates Board 
approval of a rolling ﬁve year Business 
Plan and approval, towards the end 
of each year, of operating and capital 
expenditure budgets for the year ahead. 
Performance against the budget is 
subsequently monitored and reported 
to the Board on a monthly basis. 
The Board also receives monthly reports 
on trading risk exposure as compared 
to the pre-set limits, and monitors overall 
Group performance against a Balanced 
Corporate Scorecard which shows 
progress against a set of ﬁnancial, 
operating, safety and other targets set 
at the start of the year. Performance 
is reported formally to shareholders 
through the publication of Group 
results. Operational management 
makes frequent reports on performance 
to the executive directors.
The Group also has processes in 
place for business continuity and 
emergency planning.

Through the Audit Committee, the 
Board has implemented a programme 
of internal audit reviews of different 
aspects of the Group’s activities. 
The programme, which is reviewed and 
updated annually, is designed so that, 
over time, all facets of the business are 
reviewed to ensure appropriate systems 
of control are in place and are working 
effectively or, where they are not, 
deﬁciencies are rectiﬁed by timely and 
appropriate action. In agreeing the 
actions to be taken in response to each 
report, the aim is always to embed internal 
controls, including measures intended 
effectively to identify and manage 
risk, within each area of the Group’s 
operations. In parallel with its work 
in relation to internal audit, the Audit 
Committee also satisﬁes itself that an 
action plan, for dealing with points raised 
by the external auditor in their yearly 
management letter is being properly 
addressed by management.
With the assistance of the Audit 
Committee, the Board has reviewed the 
effectiveness of the system of internal 
control. It has reviewed the reports 
of the Audit Committee, which has 
considered all signiﬁcant aspects of 
internal control including ﬁnancial, 
operational, trading, compliance, 
social, environmental and ethical risks 
in accordance with the “Internal Control: 
Guidance for Directors on the UK 
Corporate Governance Code”.
Following its review, the Board 
determined that it was not aware 
of any signiﬁcant deﬁciency or 
material weakness in the system 
of internal control.

Principal risks and uncertainties
Context
We experienced a great deal of uncertainty 
in power-related commodity markets 
during 2011 
Risk
 
kWe are exposed to the effect of fluctuations in 
commodity prices, particularly the price of 
electricity and gas, the price of coal and 
sustainable biomass (and other fuels), and the 
price of CO2 emissions allowances.
Potential impact
 
kVolatility in financial results.
Associated objective and key priorities
 
kMaximise the value of the Drax business.
 
kMaximise profitability from our coal 
generation capacity.
Context
The recent recession and uncertain 
economic growth potentially impact 
on counterparty risk 
Risk
 
kWe rely on third party suppliers for the delivery 
of fuel and other goods and services. We 
purchase a significant quantity of our coal under 
contracts with a number of large UK suppliers, 
so are exposed to the risk of non-performance 
by these suppliers. 
 
kWe enter into fixed price and fixed margin 
contracts for the sale of electricity to a number 
of counterparties, so are exposed to the risk of 
failure of one or more of these counterparties.
Potential impact
 
kAdditional costs associated with securing fuel 
and other goods and services from other 
suppliers.
 
kFailure to secure coal from other suppliers 
resulting in limitation of operations.
 
kAdverse effect on cash flow and earnings arising 
from the failure of one or more of the 
counterparties to whom we sell power.
Associated objective and key priorities
 
kMaximise the value of the Drax business.
Context
Liquidity in the market for wholesale 
electricity is dependent on there being a 
sufﬁcient number of counterparties willing 
to trade actively 
Risk
 
kChanges in the market structure or 
consolidation of the existing generation and 
supply businesses in the UK could result in a 
reduction in the number of active participants 
in the market with whom we are able to trade.
Potential impact
 
kInability to hedge short- to medium-term 
exposure to electricity prices through wholesale 
market trading.
 
kIncreased exposure to short-term market 
volatility.
 
kInability to sell all of our output.

Risk
 
kOur investment grade debt rating currently 
underpins our ability to deliver optimal value 
from our existing trading strategy. A downgrade 
of our debt rating to sub-investment grade 
would require a modified trading strategy.
Potential impact
 
kRequirement to post collateral for trading

Sustainable biomass is well placed to provide 
the UK with low cost and ﬂexible renewable 
power, and contribute to meeting carbon 
reduction targets 
Risk
 
kWe may not secure an appropriate regulatory 
framework and specific support mechanisms 
from Government, which underpin the 
economics of sustainable biomass. 
 
kFrom April 2013, in order for the sustainable 
biomass we burn to qualify for support under the 
Government’s renewables support mechanism, 
we will have to demonstrate that it meets pre-
determined sustainability standards. Those 
sustainability standards may be tightened over 
time, and there is a risk that we may sign long-
term supply contracts which meet the current 
standard but fail to meet a future standard.
 
kMost of the sustainable biomass that we can 
procure is priced in foreign currency which 
increases our exposure to fluctuations against 
sterling and poses a risk to profitability. 
 
kThere are relatively few sustainable biomass 
suppliers in the market leading to concentration 
of supply risk. A supply disruption from one 
could impact on our generation capacity. 
 
kWe could fail to secure sustainable biomass 
supplies and logistics arrangements which meet 
our hurdle return rates and sustainability criteria.
Potential impact
 
kInability to progress the biomass growth 
strategy.
Associated objective and key priorities
 
kProgress our biomass strategy.
Context
The Government’s market reform agenda is 
driven predominantly by the need to move to 
a sustainable, low carbon energy sector which 
delivers affordable supplies to customers 
whilst maintaining security of supply over the 
longer term. Laws and regulations are many 
and complex, are frequently changing, and 
becoming ever more stringent, particularly 
in relation to environmental matters 
Risk
 
kThe Government’s Energy Market Reform 
package, including the Carbon Price Support 
mechanism which will be introduced by 
HM Treasury from April 2013, will result in coal 
generation becoming progressively and relatively 
less economic than other major forms of 
generation like gas, nuclear and renewables. 
 
kThe EU, UK and local environmental and health 
and safety laws and regulations cover many 
aspects of our operations including limits 
on emissions to air and water, noise, soil/
groundwater contamination, waste, and health 
and safety standards.
Potential impact
 
kLess funding available for plant retrofit/
investment costs to meet increasingly 
stringent environmental requirements.
 
kLower load factors/generation levels.
 
kAdverse effect on financial results.
Associated objective and key priorities
 
kProgress our biomass strategy.
 
kMaintain operational excellence. 
Context
Forced outages impact on our ability 
to generate electricity
Risk
 
kForced outages may be caused by the 
underperformance or outright failure of our 
power generation plant, or transmission assets 
or other equipment and components including 
the IT systems used to operate the plant or 
conduct trading activities. The duration of 
forced outages is influenced by the lead time 
to manufacture and procure replacement 
components and to carry out repairs.

Corporate and social responsibility
Our approach to corporate and social responsibility
We operate our business within a framework of increasingly 
stringent and challenging legislative and regulatory 
requirements. We are, however, mindful of the still tougher 
expectations held by our wider stakeholder group. For us, 
corporate and social responsibility is about achieving a 
balance between the commercial and regulatory rigours 
of the competitive sector within which we operate and our 
commitment to our stakeholders as a whole.
The Board has ultimate control of policies in respect of both 
the wider corporate responsibility, such as our business 
conduct, and our environmental, health and safety programmes. 
The Board’s policies are implemented by dedicated specialists 
who make sure effective processes and procedures are in 
place to assure compliance and to identify and to report on 
risks and opportunities.
As in previous years we have continued to invest, not only 
to comply with environmental and health and safety 
requirements, but, where practicable, to go further. In 2011, 
we retained our presence in the FTSE4Good Index Series, 
which is designed to measure the performance of companies 
that meet globally recognised corporate responsibility 
standards and facilitate investment in those companies.

Business conduct
Our commitment to integrity
We have a commitment to high ethical 
standards and to conduct our business 
with honesty, integrity and in accordance 
with applicable laws and regulations.
Our reputation for acting with integrity 
plays a critical role in our success. 
Integrity not only underpins how we 
do business, but how we expect our 
suppliers, agents, partners, contractors 
and consultants to do business, whether 
in the UK or beyond. Compliance with 
the laws and regulations of the countries 
in which we do business is mandatory 
for us. Drax is committed to preventing 
bribery and corruption and takes 
responsibility for maintaining a culture 
within the Group in which bribery is 
never acceptable. 
As a business we refuse to offer, give 
or receive bribes or any other form of 
improper payments and we will never 
knowingly participate in any form of 
corrupt activity. Our employees should 
always consider the appropriateness of 
offering or receiving gifts or hospitality. 
We have a policy whereby gifts and 
hospitality offered or received may 
only be of minimal value.
If faced with a situation of compromising 
our integrity or losing the associated 
business, we would forego the business.
Code of Business Ethics
The Group’s Code of Business Ethics 
establishes the rules and framework 
under which employees should base 
their decision making. Employees are 
expected to follow not only the letter 
of the Code, but the spirit.
What is expected of our employees
We require our employees, wherever 
they are in the world, to apply the 
highest standards of behaviour 
and to be accountable for upholding 
the requirements of our Code of 
Business Ethics.
Poor choices could have potentially 
damaging consequences including 
ﬁnancial penalties and imprisonment 
and would be damaging to our 
reputation. During 2011, the Code of 
Business Ethics was refreshed and 
updated, and ensures compliance 
with the Bribery Act 2010 through 
the adoption of a zero tolerance policy 
towards bribery. In addition, our 
commitment to integrity has been 
reiterated by issuing to all our colleagues 
a booklet giving speciﬁc and clear 
guidance on the various policies and 
procedures in place to ensure that the 
highest standards of ethical behaviour 
are maintained. 
Whilst it is often obvious what is right and 
wrong, our employees may, on occasion, 
face an ethical dilemma. If it feels wrong, 
it often is. By encouraging our employees 
to apply good judgement and common 
sense within the framework of the 
Code of Business Ethics they can 
contribute to maintaining the high 
standards we expect.
Whistleblowing
The Group’s whistleblowing policy 
provides a conﬁdential means for our 
employees to speak up with conﬁdence. 
The policy provides guidance on how 
to make a disclosure of information, 
in good faith, relating to some danger, 
fraud or other illegal or unethical 
conduct that they may have witnessed 
or are concerned about.
Climate change 
and the environment
Tackling climate change
We believe we have an important 
role to play in the transition of the UK 
towards a low carbon economy whilst 
maintaining secure and affordable 
supplies of electricity. For us, a sustainable 
business principally implies retaining 
and, where possible, enhancing 
our commitment to sustainable 
biomass co-ﬁring and increased 
thermal efﬁciency as the major, 
strategic carbon abatement initiatives.
The centre of our improved thermal 
efﬁciency programme at the power 
station is the £100 million upgrade of 
the high and low pressure steam turbines 
of each of our six generating units. 
During the major planned outage of 
2011, the penultimate year of the upgrade 
programme, the installation of a high 
pressure and three low pressure turbine 
modules to a further unit was completed. 
In 2012, we will see the completion of 
the programme, which will result in an 
improvement at full load of 5% in our 
overall thermal efﬁciency and an annual 
saving of around one million tonnes 
of carbon dioxide (“CO2“) emissions.
Through co-ﬁring sustainable biomass 
we reduced our reliance on coal and 
saved 2.0 million tonnes of CO2 during 
the year. The investment in co-ﬁring of 
biomass since 2008, including building 
the world’s largest co-ﬁring facility has 
avoided the release of 4.7 million tonnes 
of CO2 and shows our continuing 
commitment to the transition to 
a low carbon economy for the UK.
Our experience and commitment to 
sustainable biomass from source to 
combustion has provided us with strong 
roots from which a future in biomass can 
be grown. This will only come with further 
regulatory certainty and appropriate 
support, both of which are critical 
to us realising our ambition to become, 
over time, a predominantly biomass 
fuelled generator. In the meantime, 
we continue to further our research 
and development work on biomass 
while awaiting further developments 
in the regulatory framework.
In addition to our thermal efﬁciency 
and co-ﬁring work, during the year, in 
partnership with Alstom UK Limited and 
National Grid Carbon Limited, we applied 
to the European Union for partial funding 
to build a 426MW oxy-ﬁred carbon 
capture and storage demonstration plant 
at the Drax Power Station site. In January 
2012, we were joined by industrial gas 
provider, BOC (a member of The Linde 
Group) as a co-sponsor of the project. 
Environmental performance 
and compliance
We fully understand the responsibilities 
we have to society and the environment 
and we are committed to furthering 
the environmental leadership position 
we hold in the coal-ﬁred sector. 
Environmental policies and activities 
at both Drax Power Station and Haven 
Power are discussed and supported 
at Board level.

Corporate and social responsibility
Our Drax Power Station and associated 
landﬁll site manages environmental 
compliance through an environmental 
management system (“EMS”). This 
system is externally certiﬁed to the 
international standard ISO 14001 and is 
subject to external audit twice a year.
We freely discuss our environmental 
performance and activities with our 
stakeholders and are sensitive to their 
views and concerns. This includes 
colleagues, business partners and 
contractors and we ensure that they 
understand how they can affect our 
environmental performance by 
identifying the environmental aspects 
of their activities and by working in a 
responsible manner.
We are pleased to report that there were 
no major breaches of our environmental 
consents during 2011.
Emissions to air
We manage all our emissions effectively 
and have maintained high levels of 
investment in ﬂue gas desulphurisation 
and combustion control systems to 
ensure compliance with environmental 
limits. Work continues to develop an 
investment programme to optimise 
compliance with the anticipated emission 
limits which will be in place beyond 2016.

Procedures are in place to manage

we returned 51% of extracted water 
back to the River Ouse. Our water 
use in 2011 was 1.0 tonnes per GWh 
of electricity generated. 
Disposals to land
We have continued to invest in site 
infrastructure to maximise the sale of ash 
products into the construction industry 
and to reduce the disposal of surplus ash 
to landﬁll. In 2011, ash was sold in 
conformance with European construction 
product standards and in compliance 
with the Waste Recycling Action 
Programme (“WRAP”) quality protocol.
This has helped us to sell 77% of the 
1.5 million tonnes of ash produced in 2011 
as replacement for virgin aggregates 
and as a cement replacement product.
In August, we entered into an agreement 
to lease some of our land to Lytag Ltd 
(“Lytag”), a company based in Escrick, 
North Yorkshire, which manufactures 
lightweight aggregate from pulverised 
fuel ash (“PFA”). PFA generated by the 
power station will be processed in the 
Lytag plant, providing another route to 
reducing the amount of ash we send 
to landﬁll.
Any unsold ash is sent to the power 
station’s ash disposal site, Barlow Mound. 
The completed area of the site has been 
fully restored for use as farm land and 
woodland.
We pay landﬁll tax on the ash disposed 
of to the site. Through the Landﬁll 
Communities Fund, we are able to claim 
a tax credit against our donations to 
recognised Environmental Bodies. 
We have worked with Groundwork 
North Yorkshire since 2001 on projects 
designed to help mitigate the effects 
of landﬁll upon our local community. 
During 2011, we contributed £68,800 
towards local community-based projects 
designed to bring about sustainable 
environmental beneﬁts and contribute 
to the social and economic regeneration 
of the area. 
During the year, we worked with Biffa 
Group Limited to introduce a new general 
and dry mixed recycling waste collection 
service to assist in recycling waste items 
such as food packaging, bottles, cans, 
paper and card. We have removed 
individual waste bins at desks in order 
to change people’s behaviour when it 
comes to recycling. The results speak for 
themselves with an additional 64 tonnes 
of waste from these sources collected in 
the 250 big red bins now installed across 
our site and recycled in 2011.
The other wastes generated as part of 
the operation and maintenance of the 
power station are managed to ensure 
they are processed or disposed of at the 
highest point on the waste hierarchy. 
This has resulted in 84% of our waste 
diverted from landﬁll. This year’s 
operations have also reduced the 
total production of waste by around 
624 tonnes.
Alternative fuels
To help maintain our vital role in the 
UK economy and safeguard cost 
effective power production, our fuel 
strategy recognises the need to sustain 
a ready supply of traditional quality coal 
and how best to incorporate alternative 
fuels, including different fossil fuels and 
renewable and sustainable biomass 
materials. The choice of fuels has to be 
balanced with availability and ﬂexibility 
of supply. 
The use of petcoke is now routine and 
our monitoring indicates that there is no 
impact on the local community. In line 
with our policy on openness and 
transparency all data are discussed 
with the Environment Agency and 
local councils.

Supply chain
Non-fuel procurement
In 2011, performance measurement 
of our procurement supply chain was 
increased and improved. The system has 
been improved to include contingency 
planning and true supply chain mapping 
to encompass more elements in the 
existing process. This has helped to 
develop strategies to identify and 
mitigate risks in our supply base. 
We undertook a series of exercises to 
map out our vulnerable supply markets 
and suppliers. Contingency plans have 
been developed to take into account the 
ease of transference of work, potential 
new suppliers, risks involved with these 
selections and timescales for changeover, 
if necessary. We also undertook training 
to enable us to recognise signs of 
suppliers in distress and as a result we 
have enhanced our risk register, allowing 
supply markets or suppliers to be logged 
and monitored. 
This additional diligence has proved 
invaluable, allowing us to mitigate the 
impact of a supplier that did go into 
administration. Through implementing 
the contingency plan for this particular 
service, disruption to services and 
contractor personnel were successfully 
minimised.
Overall, we like to take a balanced 
approach to our supply chain and 
we look to use suppliers and working 
partners from diverse backgrounds, 
in particular, small and medium suppliers 
in the local community. 
Sustainability is an essential element 
of good procurement practice and takes 
account of wider social, economic and 
environmental factors in addition to the 
conventional criteria of price, quality and 
service. Moving into 2012, by applying 
these wider principles we will create 
procurement practices that go beyond 
meeting simple tender requirements 
and will include safeguarding our brand 
reputation and delivering improved 
value and real cost savings throughout 
the supply chain.
Coal procurement
We purchase around 8 to 9 million tonnes 
of steam coal each year. We buy from a 
range of sources with the objective of 
managing our commercial exposures, 
environmental obligations and diversity 
of supply. We continue to purchase 
around half of the coal from UK deep 
and surface mines with the remainder 
coming from major supply basins around 
the world, including USA, Colombia 
and Russia.
As a responsible procurer we work 
within a strong corporate compliance 
framework. The suitability of each of 
our suppliers is checked through our 
counterparty approval, “know your 
customer” processes and ongoing 
liaison with counterparties. In addition, 
when buying from overseas we have 
introduced a process of documenting, 
in our contracts, the minimum standards 
we expect from our suppliers in respect 
of compliance with legislation, human 
rights, labour relations, health and safety 
arrangements and business ethics.
Good procurement practice
Sustainability is an essential element of good 
procurement practice and takes account of wider 
social, economic and environmental factors in 
addition to the conventional criteria of price, 
quality and service. 
40
Drax Group plc
Annual report and 
accounts 2011
Corporate and social responsibility
These criteria were originally 
designed in the absence of national 
or international legislation, to meet or 
exceed any likely emerging standards 
across the whole sustainability spectrum. 
Our system is continuously improving 
as our experience and legislation 
develops. In 2011, these criteria 
secured our leadership position in the 
utilities sector of the Forest Footprint 
Disclosure scheme. 
From April 2013, generators of over 
1MW capacity will have to comply with 
a set of sustainability requirements on 
greenhouse gas savings and land use 
developed by the Department of Energy 
and Climate Change (“DECC”) in order 
to receive Renewables Obligation 
Certiﬁcates. We are conﬁdent that 
our existing policy will be sufﬁcient 
to ensure compliance.
To assist us in continually improving 
our systems and the performance of 
our suppliers and to ensure compliance 
with our sustainability policy we use 
an experienced third party to rigorously 
audit our biomass supply chain. 
In 2011, our third party auditors carried 
out a range of audits on key existing and 
potential suppliers to conﬁrm that they 
are embracing our policy and are 
improving their performance against 
our criteria. Auditors also undertook an 
ISAE 3000 audit of our overall biomass 
procurement, logistics and combustion 
in order to provide early experience of 
the 2013 requirements.
We have adopted the target for life cycle 
greenhouse gas emissions which DECC 
has established for 2013 and beyond, 
this being similar to our previous internal 
benchmark. We have also used the DECC 
model for calculating these emissions, 
which compares emissions from biomass 
to the EU fossil fuel comparator and 
shows that average emissions savings 
across the range of biomass materials 
we burnt in 2011 were of the order of 
81%, but with a wide range in savings 
for individual biomass materials. 
This provides reassurance that our 
current procurement practices and 
suppliers are robust. 
Biomass sustainability 
and procurement
Biomass use is a high priority, but it is 
a prerequisite that it must be from a 
sustainable source. To ensure this we 
have implemented comprehensive 
criteria into our procurement activities 
with the aim of assuring both the 
availability and sustainability of the 
supply. The backbone of our criteria is 
a high level set of principles committing 
us to progressively improve the 
sustainability performance of 
our suppliers.
Our procurement process is designed 
to ensure that the production and 
delivery of biomass will:
 
k signiﬁcantly reduce greenhouse gas 
emissions compared to coal-ﬁred 
generation and, where possible, give 
preference to biomass sources that 
maximise this beneﬁt;
 
k not result in a net release of carbon 
from the vegetation and soil of either 
forests or agricultural lands;
 
k not endanger food supply or 
communities where the use of 
biomass is essential for subsistence 
(for example heat, medicines, 
building materials);
 
k not adversely affect protected or 
vulnerable biodiversity and, where 
possible, give preference to biomass 
production that strengthens biodiversity;
 
k deploy good practices to protect and/
or improve soil, water (both ground 
and surface) and air quality;
 
k contribute to local prosperity in the 
area of supply chain management 
and biomass production; and
 
k contribute to the social wellbeing of 
employees and the local population 
in the area of the biomass production.
Procuring sustainable biomass
We have implemented comprehensive criteria 
into our procurement activities with the aim of 
assuring both the availability and sustainability 
of our biomass supplies.

Health and safety
Health and safety is at the heart of our 
corporate responsibility. Protecting our 
employees, contractors and all visitors 
from injury is fundamental to our 
business philosophy. We are committed 
to developing and maintaining a positive 
health and safety culture in which 
statutory requirements are viewed as 
a minimum standard and leading 
performance as our goal.

Attaining leading performance
The lost time injury rate and total 
recordable injury rate for 2011 at 
0.08 and 0.10 respectively, remain 
industry-leading, with the latter a record 
breaking achievement at the power 
station since the measure was ﬁrst 
recorded in 2005. Maintaining this level 
of performance is commendable given 
the signiﬁcant construction work that 
took place during the year and number 
of man-hours worked, which at the Drax 
Power Station site totalled some 3 million. 
Our safety record continues to compare 
very favourably with that of our sector 
peers and international benchmarks. 
Amongst global comparator coal-ﬁred 
power stations we are ahead of the 
European and World Pacesetter group 
for total recordable injury rate, which 
is a clear indication that the safety 
management system implemented in 
the last few years is delivering sustained 
levels of performance.
We have been successful in retaining 
certiﬁcation of our Health and Safety 
Management System to the 
internationally recognised Occupational 
Health and Safety standard, OHSAS 
18001, at the Drax Power Station site and 
we have attained certiﬁcation for the our 
straw pellet plant, based at Goole in the 
East Riding of Yorkshire. Drax Power 
Station is one of a select group of large 
coal-ﬁred power stations in the country 
to hold this standard, which is approved 
by Lloyd’s Register Quality Assurance. 
In addition to this, we were delighted, 
once again, to be awarded the RoSPA 
Gold Medal Award having achieved 
Gold Award standards for seven 
consecutive years.
Processes underpinning performance
The Production Integrity Management 
System (“PIMS”) continues to provide the 
platform the business needs to deliver 
continuous improvement of business 
critical systems which are fundamental 
to the safe and effective operation of the 
power station.
“Spotlight on Safety” (“SOS”) is our 
implementation of the internationally 
proven DuPont™ STOP™ programme. 
This behavioural safety programme is 
coupled with the Drax “Four Pillars 
of Safety”:
 
k Task Risk Assessment (“TRA”) 
 
k “Safety Kick-Off” start of shift 
safety brieﬁng 
 
k Dynamic Point of Work Risk 
Assessment (“POWRA”)
 
k Weekly Safety Meeting
The Four Pillars and SOS give us 
the framework we need for open 
engagement between operatives and 
supervisors. Together these tools allow 
us to develop the defensive behaviours 
which are a fundamental component of 
the robust world-class safety culture 
we aspire to create and maintain.
Speciﬁc processes and procedures 
are also in place to clarify the general 
health and safety responsibilities for 
the effective supervision, control and 
monitoring of contractors in accordance 
with current legislation and regulations. 
The arrangements are built around 
an understanding that we and our 
contractors have a responsibility to 
protect each other, their respective 
workforces and others, such as visitors. 
An internal audit process is used to 
ensure compliance.
More generally, compulsory health and 
safety induction courses are tailored 
to suit a range of individuals and their 
on-site activities. In total, six courses have 
been introduced covering, at one end 
of the spectrum, accompanied visitors, 
right through to those employees or 
contractors working on large scale 
operational projects.
Safety leadership and recognition
We are constantly striving to 
improve the critical safety leadership 
contribution required from ﬁrst line 
supervisors. The expectations of 
both management and supervisors 
continue to be reafﬁrmed in the Safety 
Leadership Charter.
The annual Safety Conference for 
contractors and staff continues to be a 
focal point. In 2011, 84 people attended. 
Held early in the year, the conference 
sets expectations for the coming 
year’s performance.
Our “Weekly Safety Bulletin” 
brieﬁng process provides a fast-track 
communication vehicle to reach all 
those working on the site. We use the 
process to draw attention to speciﬁc 
safety issues and our performance 
record, and to recognise achievements. 
Active engagement in the safety 
brieﬁng process is a job requirement. 
A Health and Safety Advisory Committee 
(“HESAC”), which brings together 
a range of employees, including 
trade union representatives, safety 
representatives, occupational health and 
management team members, continues 
to play a vital role in facilitating staff 
consultation on health and safety 
issues, and driving standards upwards. 
A Corporate HESAC group also exists. 
Focusing on engagement with corporate 
staff, the group has a unique set of 
targets and a reporting line back to 
HESAC on a quarterly basis.
People working on the site at all 
levels who have demonstrated safety 
leadership have been given 
recognition awards.
Our active involvement with the 
programmes of our trade body, the 
Association of Electricity Producers 
and the Coal Generators Forum, GENSIP, 
continues to provide new ideas and a 
stimulus to drive our health and safety 
improvement efforts forward.

Employees
Employment
The Group employed 1,150 people at the 
year end. Most of our employees work 
full-time and are on permanent contracts.
Our opinion surveys consistently show 
that our employees are proud to work 
for the Group, and other measures 
of engagement are also very high. 
For example, at Drax Power Station 
the annual resignation rate is only 1.6%, 
the average length of service is just 
under 15 years and 37% of the workforce 
has been with the Group for 20 years 
or more. This high level of retention is 
positive, as our power generation 
business requires levels of skill and 
experience which are difﬁcult to source 
externally. Absence rates are consistently 
low, at around 2% per annum.
The annual resignation rate at Haven 
Power is over 30%, reﬂecting the nature 
of the business. This is an improving 
ﬁgure and Haven Power management 
has recently established a working group 
which is focused on potential actions to 
reduce staff turnover. 
We work to achieve high standards in 
employment practices, for example, 
through the avoidance of discriminatory 
practices, and the speedy and clear 
resolution of queries and grievances. 
We review our policies and procedures 
on a regular basis to ensure legal 
compliance and improved service levels.
Employee relations
At Drax Power Station, 529 people 
(68% of the workforce) are covered 
by collective bargaining arrangements. 
Formal negotiation and consultation 
takes place through the Company 
Committee – a joint management and 
union body that meets regularly to 
discuss working practices and terms and 
conditions of employment for production 
employees, and to receive updates on 
the Group’s strategy.
In 2010, we agreed a long-term pay 
deal for all employees in the collective 
bargaining unit, that is, all production 
employees other than managers and 
senior engineers. The pay deal extends 
to 31 December 2012, providing a 
platform for continuing stable employee 
relations in the year ahead.
All employees in corporate functions, 
Haven Power and senior production staff 
are employed on personal contracts, 
which are not covered by collective 
bargaining. Formal information and 
consultation arrangements are in place 
for these groups of staff, so that any 
proposals for change can be discussed 
openly and with sufﬁcient time to build in 
revisions arising out of the consultation.
Learning and development
Our personal and career development 
processes are designed to equip all 
our people with the technical skills, 
management and leadership 
competencies, and personal behaviours 
needed to achieve our Business Plan. 
All employees receive annual 
performance and career development 
reviews. Individual targets are reviewed 
and assessed formally through interim 
and ﬁnal appraisal discussions with their 
manager. Personal development plans 
include both technical training and 
behavioural development, which are 
delivered through a rolling programme 
of internal and external learning events.
In 2011, we introduced a supervisor 
development programme to develop a 
pipeline of potential supervisors to ﬁll 
succession gaps at Drax Power Station. 
Seven participants completed the 
programme, sponsored and accredited 
by Coventry University. The group 
developed their leadership skills through 
a series of workshops, an action learning 
project and a 12 week secondment into 
a supervisory position. Most of the 
participants have already secured a 
supervisor position and work is now 
underway to run a second programme 
during 2012.
For approved external training 
programmes, our employees receive 
ﬁnancial support, for example, course 
fees and expenses. The Group also 
supports those staff who, as members of 
professional institutions or associations, 
are required to undertake continued 
professional development.
Each year we recruit for our sponsored 
four year apprentice training programme 
covering power station operations and 
engineering maintenance. We currently 
have 18 apprentices at different stages 
of the programme, with plans to recruit 
up to ten new apprentices in 2012.
We accommodate work experience 
requests and support local schools 
and colleges with their career events, 
as well as supporting employees to be 
school governors.
At Haven Power, there are a number of 
leadership programmes in place for the 
operations management team, all team 
managers and all new team leaders. 
This year Haven Power has also 
introduced a “Learning to Lead” 
programme focused on equipping 
potential team leaders with the skills 
to progress into supervisory roles. 
Throughout the Group we have a rolling 
programme of health and safety and 
ﬁrst aid refresher training, to underpin 
the safety culture which is central to 
all operations. 
Internal communications
We use a variety of communication 
channels to ensure that all colleagues 
are kept fully informed of developments 
in the Group’s operations and have 
an opportunity to provide feedback. 
In our 2011 Employee Survey, 96% of 
respondents said they understood 
the direction the Group is taking.
At Drax Power Station, Open Forums 
provide a series of face-to-face meetings 
where the Chief Executive and Executive 
Committee present business updates 
to small groups, followed by an open 
question and answer session. The 
Open Forums, which are scheduled 
to accommodate the power station’s 
operational resource requirements, cover 
every shift pattern so that all employees 
have an opportunity to attend. We use 
a variety of media at the Open Forums, 
including DVDs featuring colleagues 
across the business. This face-to-face 
communication channel is much valued 
by employees.

In addition, our all-employee 
communication methods include 
monthly team briefs and e-mail and 
intranet communications. 
At Haven Power there is a framework of 
individual one-to-one discussions, team 
meetings and staff forums. This year 
Haven Power has introduced a weekly 
communications cascade and targeted 
communications events focused on 
particular initiatives. The intranet is 
widely used. 
Each month following the Haven Power 
Board meeting, members of the senior 
management team conduct brieﬁng 
sessions that all staff are invited to 
attend. These sessions update staff on 
the progress of the business and provide 
an opportunity to raise questions and to 
discuss any concerns.
Diversity and equality
We are committed to attracting a broad 
spectrum of candidates, as we believe 
that we are more likely to ﬁnd the best 
available people if we look in the widest 
possible talent pool. Our aim is to 
maintain an inclusive work environment 
where difference is respected. 
We have established a policy to ensure 
that gender diversity is one of the factors 
taken into account when considering 
future appointments to the Board and 
other senior appointments, and in line 
with the Equality Act 2010, we have 
updated our diversity and equality 
policy and our dignity at work policy.
We give full and fair consideration to 
suitable applications for employment 
from people with disabilities having 
regard to their particular aptitudes and 
abilities. Through a voluntary diversity 
monitoring data collection process, 
6% of colleagues who responded 
recorded that they have a disability, 
amounting to 3.5% of the workforce. 
Where a colleague becomes disabled 
whilst employed by the Group, 
we make reasonable adjustments, 
with the assistance of advice from the 
occupational health team and other 
specialists, to help them remain in work. 
Through monitoring and encouraging 
feedback, the Group is committed 
to ensuring that none of the protected 
characteristics, such as age, race and 
religion, which underpin the Equality Act 
are barriers to working for us.
Performance and reward
Pay and beneﬁts at Drax are attractive 
and match or exceed the best in the 
industry sector and the local area.
We benchmark our salaries and 
beneﬁts at every level in the organisation 
against the industry sector and the 
market as a whole. We also participate 
in specialist industry meetings to 
exchange information and developments 
in employment policy.
Through a range of share plans we 
encourage all employees to build a 
personal stake in the ownership of 
the business.
All core beneﬁts, including pension, 
permanent ill-health insurance, free 
or discounted private healthcare, 
life insurance, maternity/paternity leave, 
and the Savings-Related Share Option 
Plan are provided to both full and part-
time, as well as temporary, employees. 
Recognition
The achievements of our staff have been 
recognised through a number of awards 
and shortlistings for awards from 
external bodies during 2011. 
The Forest Footprint Disclosure 
scheme is an innovative initiative 
assisting businesses in assessing their 
impact on the world’s forests. For the 
third year running, Drax was ranked as 
the leader in the utilities sector based on 
the comprehensive sustainability criteria 
in our business procurement activities.
This year staff at Haven Power helped

Pension provision and retirement
There are 378 employees who are 
members of the Drax Power Group of 
the Electricity Supply Pension Scheme, 
which was closed to new entrants in 
2002. All other employees are eligible to 
join the Group Personal Pension Plan or 
the Haven Power Personal Pension Plan, 
which are both actively promoted to 
new recruits. Any employee aged 55 
or over is eligible to take their accrued 
retirement beneﬁts, in line with the 
statutory minimum age for receipt 
of an occupational pension.
In 2011, we removed the default 
retirement age and we now have a 
number of employees working beyond 
the age of 65. We have also introduced 
a phased retirement policy so that 
any employee aged 55 or over may 
apply to take accrued retirement beneﬁts 
and continue to work part-time for Drax 
Power Limited, subject to operational 
requirements. 
From our Human Resources information 
systems we produce reports to assist 
managers with retirement and 
succession planning and for employees 
approaching their chosen retirement 
age we offer paid pre-retirement 
leave and pre-retirement courses to 
help people transition smoothly from 
working life to their new life. 
Each year we invite over 350 Drax 
pensioners to a celebratory event 
at Christmas. The Retired Employees 
Association organise trips and other 
events during the course of the year for 
people who have retired from the Group.
Sports and Social Club
Employees can join the Drax Sports 
and Social Club for a nominal monthly 
subscription through the payroll. 
The Sports and Social Club, which is also 
open to public subscription, offers an 
extensive range of facilities.
We were shortlisted for the Company 
Award, given to the company that 
has done the most to advance UK 
renewables, of the British Renewable 
Energy Awards 2011. Our work on 
introducing sustainability standards 
to the biomass supply chain ahead of 
legislation was recognised and shortlisted 
in the Renewable Energy category of 
the Green Business Awards 2011.
In addition to receiving recognition for 
our project work, we were also delighted 
to be acknowledged for upholding good 
governance and professional standards 
at the ICSA (Institute of Chartered 
Secretaries and Administrators) Hermes 
Transparency in Governance Awards 
2011, where we were shortlisted for the 
“Best sustainability and stakeholder 
disclosure – FTSE250” award and 
the “Best remuneration disclosure – 
FTSE250” award for our 2010 
Annual report and accounts. 
Health and wellbeing
We are committed to promoting the 
health and wellbeing of all our staff 
and ensuring a professional response 
to all ﬁrst aid and emergency situations 
that occur. 
On appointment to a role in the Group, 
each new employee completes a medical 
questionnaire or examination to identify 
any pre-existing medical conditions 
and previous environmental exposure, 
or to identify where any reasonable 
adjustments are needed in cases 
where an employee has a disability.
We have published occupational 
health policies which address industrial 
disease risks, and our occupational 
health team undertakes regular 
programmes to screen colleagues 
who are in contact with, for example, 
high noise levels or dust. Everyone 
working in operational areas has 
a general medical every three years. 
Some categories of worker are 
exposed to materials which may pose 
a risk to health, such as chemicals and 
coal dust. In these cases, more speciﬁc 
health surveillance, such as lung function 
tests, hearing tests and eyesight tests 
are undertaken through an ongoing 
programme managed in accordance 
with risk, exposure and Health and Safety 
Executive requirements. Driving and 
driver training support programmes are 
in place for those travelling on business 
on a frequent basis.
Each year we have a planned programme 
of health promotion. Promotions in 2011 
included a healthy heart campaign for 
all employees at Drax Power Station, 
run by the charity Heart Research 
UK and funded by us, and a prostate 
and ovarian cancer awareness campaign.
Haven Power had a full week aimed 
at greater promotion of staff beneﬁts 
and facilities. During the week Haven 
Power’s occupational health partners 
visited both the Ipswich and Chelmsford 
sites and provided health advice on 
areas such as keeping ﬁt at work and 
stress management. 
All the Drax Power Station workforce 
is represented in formal joint 
management-worker health and safety 
committees that help monitor and 
advise on occupational health and 
safety programmes. The committees 
have senior management representation, 
with trade union or employee 
representatives.

throughout this Corporate and social 
responsibility section; below we touch 
on other aspects of our stakeholder 
engagement commitments, from investor 
relations to community relations.
Investor relations
We are committed to delivering 
shareholder value. We communicate our 
results and prospects to our shareholders 
in an accurate and timely manner 
using a variety of channels. In addition 
to the Annual General Meeting, 
we communicate through our Annual 
report and accounts, Half year report 
and Interim Management Statements. 
All of these documents are made available 
on our website at www.draxgroup.plc.uk. 
Signiﬁcant matters relating to trading 
and the development of the business 
are disseminated to the market by way 
of announcements via a regulatory 
information service and those 
announcements appear as soon as 
practicable on our website.
Announcements are frequently followed 
up with either conference calls or 
presentations to provide further detail 
and greater understanding. In addition, 
face-to-face meetings are held with our 
major institutional shareholders, again 
to assist them in their understanding of 
the announcements, but also to ensure 
that the Board is aware of their views 
and concerns. In 2011, a formal meeting 
programme was conducted in the 
UK after each of the Preliminary 
and Half year results announcements, 
and we undertook investor visits to the 
United States, Canada and mainland 
Europe during the year. To aid our 
communication with private investors, 
the investor section of our website has 
been developed to be a readily accessible 
and transparent source of information to 
enhance understanding of the business.

Corporate and social responsibility
External relations
As in previous years, we maintained our 
engagement with public affairs audiences 
on issues with implications for our 
business. With energy policy still high on 
the political agenda we had signiﬁcant 
engagement with Parliamentarians and 
ofﬁcials at all levels on issues including 
forthcoming environmental legislation, 
renewables policy and market reform 
issues. 
The form of engagement was varied 
and included both face-to-face and 
written brieﬁngs, participation in public 
consultations, written evidence to 
inquiries, and visits by Parliamentarians 
and ofﬁcials to Drax Power Station. As in 
the past, trade association membership 
proved useful during the year. The ability 
to meet with and discuss issues of the 
day with other interested parties has 
facilitated representation of collective 
positions on energy policy matters. 
Locally, we have continued to engage 
with parish, town, district and county 
councillors and ofﬁcers, with the 
intention of keeping them up to date with 
our business issues and developments. 
Our regular communication channel with 
these and other local opinion formers 
takes the form of an annual consultative 
meeting, and three meetings each year 
with our local parish and town councillors.
No political donations were made 
in the UK or elsewhere during 2011 
(2010: nil), and the Group’s contact 
with those active in the political arena 
has been and will continue to be aimed 
solely at the promotion of the Group’s 
business interests.
The deﬁnitions of EU political expenditure 
are broad and there is widespread doubt 
about the extent to which normal 
business activities, which might not be 
thought to be political expenditure in the 
usual sense, could be considered to be 
political expenditure within the meaning 
of the legislation. The Company wishes 
to avoid any inadvertent infringement 
of the legislation and each year, though a 
resolution at the Annual General Meeting, 
seeks the authority of shareholders to 
incur expenditure for the Company 
and its subsidiaries for such purposes 
of £100,000.
Community relations
We are committed to being a good 
neighbour to our local community 
and our “caring for the community” 
philosophy involves being part of 
local and regional communities. 
Our involvement takes the form of 
sponsoring a variety of local charities 
and fund raising events, promoting our 
own campaigns which focus on the three 
themes of youth sport, education and 
the environment, and maintaining open 
communication channels and good 
working relationships with the region’s 
key opinion formers.
Sponsorship and fundraising
During 2011, the Group gave ﬁnancial 
support of £136,813 (2010: £131,450) 
in total across a range of charitable 
and non-charitable community causes. 
Of that total, charitable donations 
amounted to £93,878 (2010: £87,384).
Some £18,000 of the total donations 
were made under the direction of our 
sponsorship team, across a range of 
activities within a 20-mile radius of the 
power station. Each month the team 
meets to consider requests received for 
charitable donations and community 
sponsorship and makes awards against 
our criteria of furthering community, 
environmental and sporting interests. 
One of the good causes supported 
through the sponsorship team in 2011 
was the Children’s Heart Surgery Fund 
Charity, at the Leeds General Inﬁrmary, 
which supports valuable equipment, 
resources and research for the treatment 
of children with heart defects, whilst 
providing a support service both for the 
children and their families.
Drax also operates a “£ for £” and 
Give As You Earn matching scheme, 
under which we match any monies raised 
for, or donated to, charity by employees. 
During 2011, just over £40,000 of the 
total donations made were through 
this scheme. 
Now in its seventh year, the outage 
charity scheme raised £7,000 during 
the year’s single outage. Through the 
scheme £500 is donated for every 
seven days that goes by without an injury 
requiring more than ﬁrst aid treatment. 
Added to this was a further £400 
through an initiative to collect used ear 
plugs during the outage. As in previous 
years the money was divided equally 
between two local charities chosen by 
Drax staff and our contractors: Willow’s 
Wish, helping a 7 year old girl with 
cerebral palsy travel to America for a 
potentially lifesaving operation; and The 
Steve Prescott Foundation, which raises 
money for people suffering with cancer.
For the ﬁfth year running we held a 
charity corporate golf tournament at 
Fulford Golf Club, York. The event raised 
£14,520 for the Yorkshire Air Ambulance, 
which provides a crucial emergency 
service for the region. A further £750 
was donated following a fund raising 
event held at the Drax annual Safety 
Conference for contractors and staff. 
Education in the community
We provide a choice of educational 
experiences hosted by our team of power 
station guides and, at times, technical 
experts. A state-of-the-art visitor centre 
is of particular interest to students of 
all ages allowing them to explore the 
properties of electricity, discover how 
a power station works and consider 
the environmental issues related to 
electricity generation.
Combined with a tour of the power 
station, students can learn about the 
basic principles and development 
of electricity generation, the role of 
different fuels in electricity generation, 
trading of electricity, environmental 
issues related to burning fossil fuels, 
the recycling of by-products and the 
role of a large industrial complex in the 
local economy and community.
Another visitor opportunity exists at 
our Skylark Centre that lies at the heart 
of our ash disposal site. A nature reserve 
has been established there to provide 
a sanctuary for over 100 species of 
wildlife. It is specially designed to help 
schoolchildren understand more about 
the natural habitat and ecology of 
the area.

Educational visits are complemented by 
classroom and laboratory facilities where 
teachers and students can discuss and 
investigate the results of pond dipping, 
a bugs and grubs hunt, or a nature trail 
walk through woodland areas.
Our “Cricket in the Community” initiative 
launched in May 2006 has continued 
to prove popular with local schools. 
During the year, the England and Wales 
Cricket Board qualiﬁed coaches on our 
staff, together with England ladies’ 
cricketer, Katherine Brunt, took cricket 
coaching to schools in the local area as 
part of our support for education and 
to promote sports learning as part of 
the National Curriculum.
Strengthening our links with the game 
of cricket, for the ﬁfth year we ran the 
Drax Cup, a cricket competition for teams 
of girls and boys under the age of nine. 
Around 340 primary schools across 
Yorkshire took part in the knock-out 
tournament organised by the Yorkshire 
County Cricket Club (“Yorkshire CCC”) 
in conjunction with the Yorkshire Cricket 
Board and the Yorkshire Schools’ Cricket 
Association. The four area ﬁnal winners – 
English Martyrs’ RC Primary School from 
York, Wickersley Northﬁeld Primary 
School from Rotherham, Snaith Primary 
School near Goole and Alwoodley 
Primary School from Leeds – met in the 
semi-ﬁnals and ﬁnal day at Headingley 
Carnegie Stadium, the home of Yorkshire 
CCC and a long-standing venue for test 
matches and one-day internationals. 
This year, for the second year running, 
the winning school was Alwoodley 
Primary School.
Under the “Art in the Community” 
banner, we held our ﬁfth art competition 
for primary and secondary schools. 
Some 20 schools participated and 
the winners received prizes of top art 
supplies and their schools shared in 
prize money totalling over £2,800. 
Our Summer Art Schools, designed to 
encourage and develop art appreciation 
as part of our support for education 
and to promote art learning within the 
National Curriculum, entered their fourth 
year in 2011. Children aged 7 to 10 learnt 
how to make creatures from bugs to birds 
and animals in an arts and crafts class 
using a variety of materials along with 
t-shirt printing and painting, while a 
master class for 11 to 14 year olds helped 
them get to grips with more advanced 
arts and digital technology.
Visitors to Drax
Thousands of visitors are welcomed to 
the power station every year. The appeal 
of discovering more about how power is 
produced and the sheer scale of the site 
and its associated activities attracts 
schools and colleges as well as business 
organisations, and local and professional 
associations. During 2011, we played host 
to some 7,300 visitors. 
On Easter Sunday, we held an event to 
provide fun and games for local families 
and also raise money for The Sobriety 
Project, a charity based at the Yorkshire 
Waterways Museum in Goole, which 
helps disadvantaged young people 
and vulnerable groups in the local 
community. Hundreds of children took 
part in the activities, which included a 
hunt for huge Easter eggs, mask-making 
and face-painting. 
For three Sundays in the run-up to 
Christmas, we converted the Skylark 
Centre into Santa’s Grotto. The attraction 
proved popular with local residents, over 
1,200 people came to visit the grotto 
and through their generosity and other 
Christmas initiatives some £2,500 was 
raised for Selby Hands of Hope, a charity 
helping to fund groups and activities in 
the local area.

Corporate governance
What good corporate governance means at Drax
“ Good corporate governance is one of the cornerstones of  
the success of the organisation and I believe that the systems, 
procedures, processes and controls that Drax has in place 
provide assurance to the Board and its stakeholders that 
the business is well governed.”
Charles Berry 
Chairman
Chairman’s letter
I am pleased to present Drax’s Corporate governance report for 2011 on behalf of our Board. This report is intended to provide you 
with a clear and meaningful explanation of what governance means to us and how it will guide our decision making in the future.
Good governance at all levels is taken seriously at Drax and it is for the Board to set the tone and take the lead. Good governance 
should be second nature to everyone at Drax as they go about their day-to-day business and is not simply a set of policies and 
processes. The Board believes that good practice should ﬂow throughout the Group, which in turn should guide the decisions taken 
on a daily basis. If we achieve this, then we can be sure that we are taking the right actions for the beneﬁt of all our stakeholders.
It is important that we continue to develop our board structures, processes and procedures to ensure that our governance remains 
relevant and focused on improving our business and driving our strategic priorities. During 2011, we continued to strengthen our 
internal control and risk management processes to ensure that they are embedded in business operations across the Group.
I believe the drive for transparent reporting has continued to improve business conduct in recent years. Recently the Financial 
Reporting Council has built into the UK Corporate Governance Code an emphasis for organisations to actively consider the make up 
and diversity of their boards. Drax has established a policy to ensure that gender diversity is one of the factors taken into account 
when considering future appointments to the Board and other senior appointments. 
This year we are required to report against the UK Corporate Governance Code, which replaces the Combined Code. I am pleased 
to report that the Board has reviewed the new code and we comply with it. We intend to continue to observe it, to ensure ongoing 
good governance is maintained. 
A more detailed report on our corporate governance arrangements is set out on the following pages.

Corporate governance 
The Group is committed to high standards of corporate governance, details of which are given in this Corporate governance report

“Articles”) and applicable English law concerning companies (the Companies Act 2006). This is a summary only and the relevant 
provisions of the Articles or the Companies Act should be consulted if further information is required.
Compliance with the UK Corporate Governance Code
It is the Board’s view that throughout the period commencing on 1 January 2011, there has been full compliance with the provisions 
of the UK Corporate Governance Code.

Directors’ interests, indemnity arrangements and other signiﬁcant agreements
Other than a deed of indemnity between each director, the Company and each of its subsidiaries in respect of claims made and 
personal liability incurred as a result of the bona ﬁde discharge of the directors’ responsibilities and a service contract between the 
executive directors and a Group company, or as noted in the Remuneration Committee report, no director had a material interest 
at any time during the year in any contract of signiﬁcance with the Company or any of its subsidiary undertakings.
There are no agreements between the Group and its directors or employees providing for compensation for loss of ofﬁce 
or employment that occurs because of a takeover bid.
The Board has reviewed the independence of each non-executive director. None of the non-executive directors who has served 
during the year had any material business or other relationship with the Group, and there were no other matters that were likely 
to affect their independence of character and judgement. The Board therefore considers all of the non-executive directors to 
be independent.
Selection, appointment, review and re-election
The Articles provide that one-third of directors, not including directors appointed by the Board, (rounded down to the nearest 
whole number) shall retire by rotation each year but are eligible to submit themselves for re-election by shareholders and that 
directors shall not serve longer than the third AGM following their election without being re-elected by shareholders. 
Notwithstanding the provisions of the Articles, and in accordance with the UK Corporate Governance Code, the Company will 
continue to propose all directors for annual re-election. Accordingly each of Tim Barker, Charles Berry, Tim Cobbold, Peter Emery, 
David Lindsell, Tony Quinlan, Dorothy Thompson and Tony Thorne will retire at the forthcoming AGM and, being eligible, offer 
themselves for re-election. 
The Articles require that, following appointment to the Board, directors submit themselves for election by shareholders at the 
ﬁrst AGM following their appointment. Paul Taylor was appointed to the Board after the last AGM and, therefore, will retire and 
offer himself for election by shareholders at the AGM to be held on 18 April 2012.
The evaluation of the Board described on page 55 concluded that the directors offering themselves for election or re-election 
(in line with the provisions contained in the Articles) continue to demonstrate commitment, management and industry expertise 
in their particular role and perform effectively.
The election or re-election of each director is recommended by the Board. Details of the service contracts for the executive 
directors and letters of appointment for the non-executive directors are set out in a table on page 76.
It is the Board’s policy that each non-executive director will be appointed for a term of three years which, subject to the Board 
being satisﬁed as to the director’s performance and commitment and a resolution to re-elect at the appropriate AGM, may be 
renewed by mutual agreement. However, it is the Board’s policy not to extend the aggregate period of service of any independent 
non-executive director beyond nine years and, any proposal made to extend a non-executive director’s aggregate period of ofﬁce 
beyond six years is the subject of a rigorous review. Such reviews in cases where a director remains in ofﬁce after six years, will be 
conducted annually, as part of the evaluation of the Board.
The Board is satisﬁed that all the directors are able to devote sufﬁcient time to their duties as directors.

How the Board functions 
The Board has seven scheduled meetings each year, and arranges additional meetings if the need arises. There are also three 
scheduled business updates for the Board by telephone conference call. In addition, the Board meets at least annually to 
consider strategy.  
The Board has adopted a schedule of matters reserved for its decision and formal terms of reference for its committees 
which are available to view on the Group’s website at www.draxgroup.plc.uk. The Board determines: the Group’s strategy; 
the Group’s appetite for risk; the internal control and risk management policies; the Business Plan and principal performance 
indicators; acquisitions and disposals and other transactions outside delegated limits; material changes to accounting policies 
or practices; significant financial decisions; capital structure and dividend policy; shareholder communications; prosecution, 
defence or settlement of material litigation; Group remuneration policy; the terms of reference and membership of Board 
Committees; and the Board structure, composition and succession. Matters which are not specifically reserved to the Board 
and its committees under their terms of reference, or to shareholders in General Meeting, are delegated to the Chief Executive 
or otherwise delegated in accordance with a schedule of delegated authorities approved by the Board. 
The Board receives regular reports on performance against the Business Plan and periodic business reports from senior 
management. Directors are briefed on matters to be discussed at meetings by papers distributed in advance of Board and 
committee meetings. 
The Board has adopted a policy whereby directors may, in the furtherance of their duties, seek independent professional 
advice at the Company’s expense. During 2011, no director sought independent legal advice pursuant to the policy. 
The Company Secretary is responsible for advising the Board on all governance matters, ensuring good information flows 
within the Board, its committees and senior management, and ensuring that Board processes are complied with. He is also 
responsible for compliance with the Companies Act, the Listing, Prospectus and Disclosure and Transparency Rules. In his role 
as Director of Corporate Affairs, he is also responsible for advising the Board on legal matters and has responsibility for the 
Company Secretarial, Environmental, External Affairs, Group Legal, Human Resources, and Regulatory and Policy functions, 
and for the management of the Group’s internal control and risk management framework and processes. 
The Articles give the directors power to approve conflicts of interest. The Board has adopted a procedure by which situations 
giving rise to potential conflicts of interest are identified to the Board, considered for authorisation and recorded. The Articles 
also allow the Board to exercise voting rights in group companies without restriction (e.g. so as to appoint a director to the 
board of a group company without this counting as a conflict requiring authorisation). 
Each director has the benefit of a deed of indemnity from the Company and its subsidiaries in respect of claims made and 
liabilities incurred, in either case arising out of the bona fide discharge by the director of his or her duties. The Company has 
also arranged appropriate insurance cover in respect of legal action against directors of the Company and its subsidiaries. 
Performance reviews and directors’ development 
The effectiveness of the Board is vital to the success of the Group. During 2010, the Company undertook a review to evaluate 
the performance of the Board, its committees and individual directors. This was performed by Independent Audit Limited 
(“Independent Audit”), an independent strategic governance consultancy that has no other connection with the Company. 
The 2010 review involved individual interviews with each director, the Company Secretary and members of the senior 
management group, and concluded that the Board was strong and appeared well equipped to meet the challenges ahead.  
directors with a broad range of relevant experience. The report made a number of recommendations to enhance Board 
effectiveness, all of which the Board acted upon as part of the process of continuing improvement. During 2011, the Board 
commissioned Independent Audit to conduct a follow up review, which was carried out through a questionnaire based process. 
The findings of the review were presented to the Board. The review did not disclose any areas of concern and found that good 
progress had been made on the areas for improvement identified by the 2010 review. The review suggested that there would 
be benefit in the Board reviewing certain of its past decisions. The Board will act on this suggestion and, as an example, will 
consider whether its decision taken in 2010 to change the manner in which it scrutinises and receives assurance in respect of 
health and safety management has resulted in a more effective process.  
During the year, the Chairman held a meeting with the non-executive directors in the absence of the executive directors, 
and the Senior Independent Director held meetings with the non-executive directors without the Chairman being present, 
as required by provision A.4.2 of the UK Corporate Governance Code. 
The Board is committed to the development of all employees and directors and has reviewed and will periodically continue to 
review each individual director’s development requirements and make appropriate arrangements to address them. All new 
directors receive an induction, including being provided with information about the Group and their responsibilities, meetings 
with key managers and visits to the Group’s sites. In addition, each non-executive director visits operational sites and meets 
with senior management to be briefed on the Group’s business at least annually, and specific Board training days are arranged 
involving presentations on relevant topics. 
In particular, the composition and mix of the Board were considered to be appropriate with a strong cadre of non-executive

Internal control 
Details of the Group’s system of internal control and risk management are contained in the Principal risks and uncertainties 
section on pages 32 to 35 together with the Directors’ responsibilities statement in accordance with the UK Corporate 
Governance Code. 
Relations with shareholders 
The Board places considerable importance on communication with shareholders and is proactive in obtaining an 
understanding of shareholder preferences and evaluating systematically the economic, social, environmental and ethical 
matters that may influence or affect the interests of shareholders. A number of formal communication channels are used to 
account to shareholders for the performance of the Group, which include the Annual report and accounts, AGMs and periodic 
reports to the London Stock Exchange. Presentations given at appropriate intervals to representatives of the investor 
community are available to all shareholders to download from the Group’s website (www.draxgroup.plc.uk). Less formal 
processes include contacts with institutional shareholders by the Chairman and other directors. 
The Chairman is keen to ensure that he maintains an open relationship with the Group’s major shareholders and 
communicates directly with them, offering the opportunity to meet in order that he can understand their views on the Group, 
be it corporate governance issues or any other points they might wish to raise. 
The Board also reviews and discusses the investor feedback from post-results investor meetings conducted by the Chief 
Executive and the Finance Director in the UK, Europe and the USA. These took place following both the preliminary and half 
year results announcements in 2011. The Group has also engaged Makinson Cowell Limited, an independent capital markets 
consultancy firm, to advise and assist in relation to communications with shareholders. 
The Company’s private registered shareholders hold, in aggregate, approximately 0.8% of the issued share capital. The Board 
is as interested in their concerns as it is in the concerns of institutional and corporate shareholders. All shareholders are free 
to put questions to the Board at the AGM. Questions asked in person at the AGM will receive an oral response whenever 
possible. Otherwise a written response will be provided as soon as practicable after the AGM. Questions asked at other times 
will normally receive a written response. Shareholders attending the AGM will have an opportunity to meet informally with 
the directors immediately after the meeting. 
All information reported to the market via a regulatory information service also appears as soon as practicable on the 
Group’s website. 
This Annual report and accounts together with other public announcements is designed to present a balanced and 
understandable view of the Group’s activities and prospects. The Business review, on pages 2 to 49, provides an assessment 
of the Group’s affairs. This Annual report and accounts is despatched to shareholders at least 20 working days before the 
AGM and the accompanying Form of Proxy provides for a shareholder to vote in favour or against, or to indicate abstention 
as an alternative on each separate resolution. Particulars of aggregate proxies lodged will be announced to the London Stock 
Exchange via a regulatory information service and placed on the Group’s website as soon as practicable after the conclusion 
of the AGM.

Auditors and the disclosure of information to the auditor 
So far as each person who is a director at the date of approving this report is aware, there is no relevant audit information, 
being information needed by the auditor in connection with preparing the report, of which the auditor is unaware. 
Having made enquiries of fellow directors, each director has taken all steps that he/she ought to have taken as a director 
to ascertain any relevant audit information and to establish that the auditor is aware of that information. This information 
is given and should be interpreted in accordance with the provisions of Section 418 of the Companies Act.  
In accordance with Section 489 of the Companies Act, a resolution is to be proposed at the AGM for the reappointment of 
Deloitte LLP as the auditor of the Company. A resolution will also be proposed authorising the directors to determine the 
auditor’s remuneration. The Audit Committee reviews the appointment of the auditor, the auditor’s effectiveness and 
relationship with the Group, including the level of audit and non-audit fees paid to the auditor. Further details on the work 
of the auditor and the Audit Committee are set out in the Audit Committee report on pages 62 to 64.

Authority to purchase own shares 
At the AGM held on 13 April 2011, shareholders resolved to authorise the Company to make market purchases of up to 10% of 
the issued ordinary share capital. At the forthcoming AGM, shareholders will be asked to renew this authority. Details are 
contained in the notice of the AGM. 
The Company did not purchase any of its own shares during 2011 and the Company held no Treasury shares during 2011. 
Rights and obligations attaching to shares 
The rights and obligations attaching to the ordinary shares are set out in the Articles. The Articles may only be changed 
by the shareholders by special resolution. 
Variation of rights 
Subject to statute, the Articles specify that rights attached to any class of shares may be varied with the written consent 
of the holders of not less than three-quarters in nominal value of the issued shares of that class, or with the sanction of an 
extraordinary resolution passed at a separate General Meeting of the holders of those shares. At every such separate General 
Meeting the quorum shall be two persons holding or representing by proxy at least one-third in nominal value of the issued 
shares of the class (calculated excluding any shares held as Treasury shares). The rights conferred upon the holders of any 
shares shall not, unless otherwise expressly provided in the rights attaching to those shares, be deemed to be varied by the 
creation or issue of further shares ranking pari passu with them. 
Transfer of shares 
All transfers of shares which are in certificated form may be effected by transfer in writing in any usual or common form 
or in any other form acceptable to the directors and may be under hand only. The instrument of transfer shall be signed by 
or on behalf of the transferor and (except in the case of fully paid shares) by or on behalf of the transferee. The transferor 
shall remain the holder of the shares concerned until the name of the transferee is entered in the register. All transfers 
of shares which are in uncertificated form may be effected by means of the CREST system. 
The directors may decline to recognise any instrument of transfer relating to shares in certificated form unless it:  
a) is in respect of only one class of share; and  
b) is lodged at the transfer office (duly stamped if required) accompanied by the relevant share certificate(s) and such other 
evidence as the directors may reasonably require to show the right of the transferor to make the transfer (and, if the 
instrument of transfer is executed by some other person on his/her behalf, the authority of that person so to do). 
The directors may, in the case of shares in certificated form, in their absolute discretion and without assigning any reason 
therefore, refuse to register any transfer of shares (not being fully paid shares) provided that, where any such shares are 
admitted to the Official List of the London Stock Exchange, such discretion may not be exercised in such a way as to prevent 
dealings in the shares of that class from taking place on an open and proper basis. The directors may also refuse to register 
an allotment or transfer of shares (whether fully paid or not) in favour of more than four persons jointly. 
If the directors refuse to register an allotment or transfer, they shall send within two months after the date on which the letter 
of allotment or transfer was lodged with the Company, to the allottee or transferee, notice of the refusal. 
A shareholder does not need to obtain the approval of the Company, or of other shareholders of shares in the Company, 
for a transfer of shares to take place. 
The Articles provide that directors must give reasons for any refusal to register a transfer of shares in accordance with the 
Companies Act. 
Shares in uncertificated form 
Directors may determine that any class of shares may be held in uncertificated form and title to such shares may be 
transferred by means of a relevant system or that shares of any class should cease to be held and transferred. Subject to 
the provisions of the Companies Act, the CREST Regulations and every other statute, statutory instrument, regulation or 
order for the time being in force concerning companies and affecting the Company, the directors may determine that any 
class of shares held on the branch register of members of the Company resident in South Africa or any other overseas branch 
register of the members of the Company may be held in uncertificated form in accordance with any system outside the UK 
which enables title to such shares to be evidenced and transferred without a written instrument and which is a relevant 
system. The provisions of the Articles shall not apply to shares of any class which are in uncertificated form to the extent 
that the Articles are inconsistent with the holding of shares of that class in uncertificated form, the transfer of title to shares 
of that class by means of a relevant system or any provision of the CREST Regulations.

Voting 
Subject to the Articles generally and to any special rights or restrictions as to voting attached by, or in accordance with, the 
Articles to any class of shares, on a show of hands every member who is present in person at a General Meeting shall have one 
vote and, on a poll, every member who is present in person or by proxy shall have one vote for every share of which he/she is 
the holder. It has been the Company’s practice since incorporation to hold a poll on every resolution at Annual General 
Meetings and Extraordinary General Meetings. 
Where shares are held by trustees/nominees in respect of the Group’s employee share plans and the voting rights attached 
to such shares are not directly exercisable by the employees, it is the Company’s practice that such rights are not exercised 
by the relevant trustee/nominee. 
Under the Companies Act, members are entitled to appoint a proxy, who need not be a member of the Company, to exercise 
all or any of their rights to attend and to speak and vote on their behalf at a General Meeting or class meeting. A member may 
appoint more than one proxy in relation to a General Meeting or class meeting provided that each proxy is appointed to 
exercise the rights attached to a different share or shares held by that member. A member that is a corporation may appoint 
one or more individuals to act on its behalf at a General Meeting or class meetings as a corporate representative. 
Deadlines for exercising voting rights 
Votes are exercisable at a General Meeting of the Company in respect of which the business being voted upon is being heard. 
Votes may be exercised in person, by proxy, or in relation to corporate members, by corporate representative. The Articles 
provide a deadline for submission of proxy forms of not than less than 48 hours before the time appointed for the holding 
of the meeting or adjourned meeting. 
Restrictions on voting 
No member shall, unless the directors otherwise determine, be entitled in respect of any share held by him/her to vote either 
personally or by proxy at a shareholders’ meeting or to exercise any other right conferred by membership in relation to 
shareholders’ meetings if any call or other sum presently payable by him/her to the Company in respect of that share remains 
unpaid. In addition, no member shall be entitled to vote if he/she has been served with a notice after failing to provide the 
Company with information concerning interests in those shares required to be provided under the Companies Act.

Directors’ responsibilities statement 
The directors are responsible for preparing the Annual report and the financial statements in accordance with applicable law 
and regulations. 
Company law requires the directors to prepare financial statements for each financial year. Under that law the directors are 
required to prepare the Group financial statements in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRSs) as 
adopted by the European Union and Article 4 of the IAS Regulation and have elected to prepare the parent Company financial 
statements in accordance with United Kingdom Generally Accepted Accounting Practice (United Kingdom Accounting 
Standards and applicable law). Under company law the directors must not approve the accounts unless they are satisfied that 
they give a true and fair view of the state of affairs of the Company and of the profit or loss of the Company for that period.  
In preparing the parent Company financial statements, the directors are required to: 
−�select suitable accounting policies and then apply them consistently; 
−�make judgements and accounting estimates that are reasonable and prudent; 
−�state whether applicable UK Accounting Standards have been followed, subject to any material departures disclosed 
and explained in the financial statements; and 
−�prepare the financial statements on the going concern basis unless it is inappropriate to presume that the Company 
will continue in business. 
In preparing the Group financial statements, International Accounting Standard 1 requires that directors: 
−�properly select and apply accounting policies; 
−�present information, including accounting policies, in a manner that provides relevant, reliable, comparable and 
understandable information;  
−�provide additional disclosures when compliance with the specific requirements in IFRSs are insufficient to enable users to 
understand the impact of particular transactions, other events and conditions on the entity’s financial position and financial 
performance; and 
−�make an assessment of the Company's ability to continue as a going concern. 
The directors are responsible for keeping adequate accounting records that are sufficient to show and explain the Company’s 
transactions and disclose with reasonable accuracy at any time the financial position of the Company and enable them to 
ensure that the financial statements comply with the Companies Act 2006. They are also responsible for safeguarding the 
assets of the Company and hence for taking reasonable steps for the prevention and detection of fraud and other 
irregularities. 
The directors are responsible for the maintenance and integrity of the corporate and financial information included on the 
Company’s website. Legislation in the United Kingdom governing the preparation and dissemination of financial statements 
may differ from legislation in other jurisdictions. 
Responsibility statement  
We confirm that to the best of our knowledge: 
−�the financial statements, prepared in accordance with the relevant financial reporting framework, give a true and fair view 
of the assets, liabilities, financial position and profit or loss of the Company and the undertakings included in the 
consolidation taken as a whole; and 
−�the management report, which is incorporated into the Directors’ report, includes a fair review of the development and 
performance of the business and the position of the Company and the undertakings included in the consolidation taken 
as a whole, together with a description of the principal risks and uncertainties that they face.

Audit Committee report
Membership and process 
The Audit Committee (the “Committee”) consisted of David Lindsell (as Chairman), Tim Barker (Senior Independent Director), 
Tim Cobbold, and Tony Thorne all of whom are independent non-executive directors.  
The Board is satisfied that the membership of the Committee meets the requirement for recent and relevant financial 
experience. The Company Secretary acts as Secretary to the Committee. 
The Committee met on four occasions in 2011, and the members’ attendance record is set out on page 56. The Chairman of 
the Committee reports the Committee’s deliberations to the following Board meeting and the minutes of each meeting of the 
Committee are circulated to all members of the Board. 
Role 
The Committee assists the Board to fulfil its oversight responsibilities. Its primary functions are to: 
−�monitor the integrity of the financial statements and other information provided to shareholders; 
−�review significant financial reporting issues and judgements contained in the financial statements; 
−�review the systems of internal control and risk management; 
−�maintain an appropriate relationship with the Group’s external auditor and review the effectiveness and objectivity of the 
external audit process; and  
−�monitor and review the effectiveness of the internal audit function (which is provided by Grant Thornton UK LLP), review 
the internal audit plan, all internal audit reports and review and monitor management’s responses to the findings and 
recommendations of the internal audit function. 
The terms of reference for the Committee are reviewed annually by the Committee and then by the Board. The terms of 
reference are available on the Group’s website at www.draxgroup.plc.uk. 
Attendance at meetings 
The Chairman of the Board, the Chief Executive, the Finance Director, the Group Financial Controller and the internal and 
external auditor are normally invited by the Chairman of the Committee to attend meetings of the Committee. In undertaking 
its duties, the Committee has access to the services of the Finance Director and the Company Secretary and their resources, 
as well as access to external professional advice. 
During the year, the Committee undertook its duties in accordance with an agreed annual work plan of which the main 
features were: 
−�at meetings in February and July 2011, the Committee reviewed the Group’s Preliminary results announcement and Annual 
report and accounts, and the Half year results announcement and Half year report respectively. On each occasion, the 
Committee received reports from management and the external auditor identifying accounting or judgemental issues 
requiring its attention and also satisfied itself of the independence and objectivity of the external auditor;  
−�at each meeting the Committee received reports from the internal audit function on the progress of their programme 
for the year, reviewed new internal audit reports and monitored progress with the implementation of internal control 
recommendations. The Committee continues to focus on specifically identified strategic risk areas, as well as ensuring 
the provision of a core compliance assurance service. No significant weaknesses were identified in any of the internal audit 
reports although certain improvements in processes and procedures were made as a result of reviews;  
−�in July 2011, the Committee reviewed the arrangements for the provision of the internal audit function and the 
performance of the current provider, Grant Thornton UK LLP. The Committee considered that outsourcing the internal 
audit function through Grant Thornton UK LLP continues to be effective and appropriate; 
“ The steps Drax has taken in 2011 in revising and reﬁning its 
risk and governance framework should provide stakeholders 
with greater comfort that it is a well-run business.”

−�at meetings in April and November 2011, the Committee reviewed the Company’s risk register and in February and 
November 2011, it undertook a review of the effectiveness of the system of internal controls and consideration of fraud;  
−�during 2011, PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP (“PwC”) conducted a further phase on the effectiveness of controls applicable 
to Drax Power Limited’s commodity trading activities. In July 2011, the results of this further phase were presented to the 
Committee. The report did not identify any significant weaknesses in the controls;  
−�during the year, the Committee met three times in the absence of management with each of the external and internal 
auditor. No matters of concern were drawn to the Committee’s attention at any of these meetings. The Committee’s 
understanding with both the external and internal auditor is that, if they should at any time become aware of any matters 
occasioning them material concern, they will immediately draw it to the Committee’s attention via the Chairman of the 
Committee. Nothing was subject to this procedure in the course of the year; and  
−�strategic reviews of tax (July 2011), treasury and the finance team (both November 2011), were undertaken and presented 
to the Committee and in addition, policy reviews covering auditor independence and whistleblowing were put to, and 
approved by, the Committee in April 2011. 
The nature of the Group’s activities, and the markets in which it operates, are such that from time to time there is a need to 
consider carefully certain complex accounting issues and make subjective judgements.  
Independence of the external audit 
In April 2011, the Committee considered and adopted an enhanced Auditor Independence Policy. In accordance with the Policy, 
the Committee annually reviews the quality and cost effectiveness of the external audit and the independence and objectivity 
of the external auditor. 
The provisions of the Policy include: 
−�seeking confirmation that the auditor is, in their professional judgement, independent of the Group and obtaining from 
them an account of all relationships which may affect the firm’s independence and the objectivity of the audit partner 
and staff;  
−�a policy governing the engagement of the auditor to conduct non-audit work under which: 
−�the auditor may not be engaged to provide certain categories of work, including those where they may be required to 
audit their own work or make management decisions, or where the auditor would act in an advocacy role for the Group;  
−�there is a clear process of approval for engaging the auditor to conduct other categories of non-audit work, subject to 
financial limits;  
−�all engagements of the auditor to conduct non-audit work are reported to the next meeting of the Committee;  
−�the balance between the fees paid to the external auditor for audit and non-audit work is monitored by the Committee; 
and  
−�a policy on the employment by the Group of former employees of the external auditor, the essence of which is to require 
a period of two years to elapse between the cessation of an individual’s association with the auditor and appointment to 
any financial reporting oversight role within the Group. 
Details of the amounts paid to the external auditor during the year for audit and other services are set out in note 5 to the 
consolidated financial statements on page 93. The external auditor is required to rotate the audit partner responsible 
for the Group audit every five years and the current audit partner, Carl Hughes, has been in place for three years. 
No contractual obligations exist that restrict the Group’s choice of external auditor.

Internal audit 
Under an outsourcing arrangement, Grant Thornton UK LLP undertakes the Group’s internal audit function. Regular reports 
are provided to the Audit Committee regarding the audit programme and reviews undertaken. Recommendations are made to 
management for process improvements as appropriate. Topics dealt with by internal audit reports reviewed by the Committee 
during 2011 included: Senior Accounting Officer compliance; Human Resources strategy; Bribery Act compliance; payroll, Drax 
cyclical key financial controls; Haven key financial controls; Drax IT key controls and strategy; Haven IT key controls and 
strategy; and group wide risk management.  
External auditor 
Deloitte LLP was appointed auditor of the Group in 2005 and have been reappointed at each subsequent Annual General 
Meeting. They previously acted as auditor to the Drax group of companies prior to the listing of the Company in December 
2005. Any decision to open the external audit to tender is taken on the recommendation of the Audit Committee based on the 
results of the performance review described below. 
Having reviewed their performance during the year and satisfied itself of their continuing independence and objectivity within 
the context of applicable regulatory requirements and professional standards, the Committee has invited the Board to 
recommend the reappointment of Deloitte LLP as auditor at the forthcoming AGM and a resolution to that effect appears 
in the notice of the AGM. 
The Chairman of the Committee, independent of management, maintains regular and direct contact with both the internal 
and external auditor.

Nominations Committee report
The Nominations Committee (the “Committee”) consisted of Charles Berry (as Chairman), Tim Barker (Senior Independent 
Director), Tim Cobbold, Mike Grasby (until 13 April 2011), David Lindsell and Tony Thorne. The Company Secretary acts as 
Secretary to the Committee. 
The principal duties of the Committee are to keep under review the structure, size and composition of the Board (including  
succession planning for the directors and other senior 
e directors and to review the time required  
The Company’s Articles provide that directors retire by rotation. However, the UK Corporate Governance Code provides that 
all directors should be subject to annual re-election. The Company adopted the provisions of the UK Corporate Governance 
Code on the annual re-election of all directors at the beginning of 2011.  
The terms of reference for the Committee are reviewed annually by the Committee and then by the Board. They are available 
on the Group’s website at www.draxgroup.plc.uk. 
The Committee met on three occasions in 2011, and the members’ attendance record is set out on page 56. 
The Chairman of the Committee reports the Committee’s deliberations to the following Board meeting and, subject to 
redaction in the event that they include personal information, the minutes of each meeting of the Committee are circulated 
to all members of the Board. 
In September 2011, the Committee considered the succession planning process for the directors and senior managers and 
concluded that it was appropriate for the business. The outcome of the process which it initiated for the review of the 
performance of the Board, its committees and individual directors is reported in the Corporate governance report on page 55. 
During the course of the year, the Committee considered the composition of the Board and concluded that it was an 
appropriate time to appoint a commercial director. The succession planning process had already established that Paul Taylor 
was capable of stepping into an executive director role, when the time was right for the Company. Paul Taylor was 
subsequently appointed the Retail and Trading Director on 1 September 2011. He will retire and offer himself for election 
by shareholders at the AGM to be held on 18 April 2012. 
The Board has considered the recommendations of the Report by Lord Davies, Women on Boards, and welcomes initiatives 
aimed at increasing diversity generally, including gender diversity. We believe, however, that an over prescriptive approach 
through setting targets or announcing aspirational goals is not desirable. It is possible that in setting out attributes for new 
appointments, without specific consideration of gender diversity, the Board could unintentionally limit the available talent 
pool. However, it is equally possible that setting out gender diversity targets may also have a limiting effect. The Board has 
established a policy to ensure that the proportion of women on the Board will be one of the considerations for future Board 
and senior management appointments. We believe that proper account of the benefits of gender diversity can be taken 
without establishing specific aims and without giving undue weight to gender diversity. The Nominations Committee will 
implement this policy in relation to future appointments to the Board. 
Further details of gender diversity in the Group are included in the Corporate and social responsibility section of the Annual 
report and accounts. 
The Committee met on 14 February 2012, following the completion of the Board evaluation process, and determined that all of 
the directors who are the subject of annual re-election will retire at the forthcoming AGM and, being eligible, offer themselves 
for re-election. The evaluation of the Board described on page 55 concluded that the directors offering themselves for 
re-election continue to demonstrate commitment to their particular role and perform effectively. 
The executive directors’ service contracts and non-executive directors’ letters of appointment are available for inspection by 
prior arrangement during normal business hours at the Company’s registered office. They will also be available for inspection 
at the venue, prior to the AGM, details of which are contained in the Notice of Meeting. 
This report was reviewed and approved by the Board on 20 February 2012.

Remuneration Committee report
Introduction 
The debate in respect of executive remuneration and in particular the transparency of reporting has continued in earnest 
during 2011. The Remuneration Committee (“the Committee”) has welcomed this and has actively contributed. 
We recognise the need to build trust in the remuneration process through transparency and accountability and we are 
therefore supportive of many of the proposals currently being suggested by the Government following the Department 
for Business, Innovation and Skills reviews of narrative reporting and executive remuneration. 
In particular we welcome proposals that promote clear and concise reporting as evidenced by our nomination for 
“Best Remuneration Disclosure” in the ICSA Hermes Transparency in Governance Awards 2011. We are also considering 
implementing further measures to promote greater transparency within the Group. 
Some disclosures, particularly if they are overly prescriptive, may have unintended consequences or be subject to invalid 
comparisons between companies. We therefore think that it is essential to give companies flexibility to present information 
in a way that is relevant to their business and compensation structures. 
The Committee strongly supports proposals that enhance the link between performance and executive remuneration and 
also improve the clarity of reporting of the same. We believe that the measures of performance to which executive reward 
is linked should be based on the specific company’s circumstances and also individual contribution, so cannot be measured 
solely in terms of share price or earnings growth. This is particularly so in challenging market conditions and in companies 
such as Drax, where shareholders recognise that earnings volatility is inescapable. 
The Committee further developed this approach during the last remuneration review whereby performance measures 
applicable to the Bonus Matching Plan (“BMP”) for executives and senior management were adjusted to include both 
operational and strategic measures. Our aim was to align more closely remuneration with key strategic goals specific to Drax, 
in particular the development of a much more sustainable business with reduced reliance on coal, a greater focus on biomass 
and increased retail sales. A relative Total Shareholder Return (“TSR”) measure was also retained to ensure continued 
alignment of executive reward with the interests of shareholders. 
All participants in the BMP are subject to the share ownership guidelines as set out on page 75.  
The Committee has striven to maintain a balanced remuneration structure which recognises both short-term performance 
and the achievement of long-term strategic objectives. Financial and operational performance continue to be critical 
components in the Committee’s determination of remuneration for executive directors and senior staff as it is these factors 
that primarily determine the returns to shareholders in the short-term. Indeed, the business performed well in both of these 
areas during 2011 against a backdrop of volatile commodity markets.  
Remuneration for executives also takes into account progress in the Group’s two key strategic initiatives; to convert Drax 
Power Station into a predominantly biomass fuelled generating asset, subject to securing the necessary regulatory support, 
and the programme for the expansion of Haven Power Limited. The Committee’s assessment was that excellent progress 
was made during 2011 in achieving these objectives. 
The Committee is satisfied that remuneration incentives are compatible with the Group’s risk policies and systems, 
including those relating environmental, social and governance risks. 
“ The Committee has sought to ensure that the variable elements of 
management remuneration achieve an appropriate balance between 
short-term ﬁnancial and operational performance, progress towards the 
Group’s strategic objectives and alignment with the returns to shareholders.”

This Remuneration Committee report has been prepared by the Committee on behalf of the Board which has adopted  
Governance Code and it complies with the Listing Rules  
Regulations, 2002 (“the Regulations”). 
These Regulations require the Company’s auditor to report on the “Audited information” in the Remuneration Committee 
report and to state that this section has been properly prepared in accordance with the Regulations. For this reason the report 
is divided into unaudited and audited information. 
The Remuneration Committee report is subject to shareholder approval at the Annual General Meeting (“AGM”) on  
Part 1 — Unaudited information

Agenda 
Each year the Committee agrees an annual work schedule. The regular scheduled matters considered by the Committee 
in 2011 were: 
−�review of the performance of the Group by reference to the 2010 Balanced Corporate Scorecard (“Scorecard”), 
including the application of the discretionary factor;  
−�ratification of the measures and weightings of the 2011 Scorecard;

In addition, with the assistance of its advisers, the Committee considered current trends in executive remuneration with 
particular reference to consultation on executive remuneration by the Department of Business, Innovation and Skills.  
actices in that context. It concluded that   
The Committee also considered the provision of pension benefits to executive directors in the light of changes in personal 
taxation. It decided not to make any change to the provision of pension benefit, save to give executives the option to be paid 
in cash in lieu of pension contributions for amounts in excess of the annual personal allowance of £50,000. 
Remuneration policy 
During the year the Committee reviewed and updated its terms of reference to ensure that they were sufficiently flexible and 
appropriate to meet the different requirements necessary to motivate and retain senior managers in all Group companies.  
The objectives of the remuneration policy are:  
−�to enable the Company to recruit, retain and motivate the talent needed to achieve its business objectives; 
−�to strengthen teamwork by enabling all employees to share in the success of the business;  
−�to ensure alignment of executive and shareholder interests; and 
−�to develop an approach which emphasises Total Reward.  
The core principles of the remuneration policy are to: 
−�pay market rates of total remuneration; 
−�adopt different pay and benefit structures for different operating entities in the Group as appropriate to each entity’s 
markets, workforce and location; 
−�ensure that there is an appropriate link between performance and reward; 
−�award annual bonuses which are linked to the delivery of the annual Business Plan targets including the achievement 
of strategic objectives and personal performance; and 
−�ensure that long-term incentives are linked to TSR and to the delivery of Business Plan targets including the achievement 
of strategic objectives. 
The Committee considered the Company’s own remuneration policy and pr
the structure and level of executive remuneration in the Company continued to be appropriate.

The chart values the annual bonus at target with a 5.0% p.a. forfeiture risk applied to the mandatory deferred bonus. 
The BMP opportunity is based on “fair value” assuming the annual bonus pays out at target and the fair value of a BMP 
performance share is assessed at 45% of its face value. 
The following paragraphs provide more detail in relation to each of the components of remuneration for executive directors. 
Base salary 
Executive directors’ base salaries and benefits are reviewed each year with any changes taking effect from 1 April. The review 
takes into account individual performance and market competitiveness, recognising that there is no obvious comparator to 
Drax in the market.  
The Committee also takes into account the level of general pay increases within the Company. The pay increase agreed 
on behalf of staff covered by collective bargaining arrangements is subject to a three year agreement with increases on 
1 January of each year of the agreement, at RPI plus 0.3%. The increase is subject to a cap of 4.9%, which was therefore 
the level of the general pay increase on 1 January 2011. The agreement continues until 31 December 2012. The average 
pensionable pay of an executive director is nine times the average of pensionable pay for employees within the collective 
bargaining unit. 
In the light of the benchmarking exercise and the other factors considered, the Committee agreed that with effect from 1 April 2011: 
−�Dorothy Thompson’s base salary should be increased by 2% to £510,000  
−�Tony Quinlan’s base salary should be increased by 2% to £346,800 
−�Peter Emery’s base salary should be increased by 2% to £285,600  
The Committee consider these salary levels to be appropriate taking into account all of the factors set out.  
−�Paul Taylor was appointed to the Board on 1 September 2011 at an annual base salary of £240,000. 
−�Pensionable salary is derived from base salary only.

Annual performance bonus 
The Group operates an annual bonus scheme. Bonuses are based on both Group and individual performance against 
objectives and are designed to reward short-term performance. 
The Committee determines Group performance measures using a Scorecard for which the Board sets challenging 
performance targets as part of the Business Plan approval process. Each element of the Scorecard has a low, target and 
stretch measure and is given a percentage weighting. No score is attributed if performance is below the low target and 
maximum score is attributed to stretch target performance. In 2011, the Scorecard had the following elements and weightings:

Notes:

In setting these measures and weightings, the Committee recognises that the short-term financial performance of the 
Group is substantially determined by commodity prices, and especially the dark green spread, over which management has 
limited control. 
The Committee, nevertheless, believes that the variable elements of pay should be sufficiently linked to financial performance 
to ensure that there is alignment with the interests of shareholders. The Committee considers that the annual bonus 
measures and weightings achieve an appropriate balance between financial performance measures and other key 
performance measures that are more directly in the control of management. 
The Committee assesses corporate performance against each of these measures, and has a discretion to adjust the overall 
score by a factor between 0.75x and 1.25x (i.e. +/–25%) to reflect performance and unexpected developments that are not 
directly included in the Scorecard, leading to an overall percentage score. 
Following this process, the Committee assessed the corporate score for 2011 at 146%. The Committee exercised its discretion 
to adjust the corporate score (by a factor of 1.03x), resulting in a final corporate score of 150%. 
A summary of the assessment is set out in the following table: 
 
Elements 
Financial targets 
Stretch target achieved for underlying earnings per share. 
Between target and stretch target achieved for cash flow.(1) 
Stretch target achieved for controllable costs. 
Production targets 
Stretch target achieved for total recordable injury rate.  
Between target and stretch target achieved for all other safety and operational 
targets, except for planned outage rate, which achieved between low and target 
because of additional outages associated with plant modifications for biomass 
trials which were not included in the original plan. 
Strategic and Business Plan objectives 
Between target and stretch target achieved for regulatory objectives. 
Overall, slightly below target was achieved for development of biomass plans, 
which reflected the inability to demonstrate a viable investment case for the 
development of dedicated biomass plant. 
Between target and stretch target was achieved for commercial and 
development targets for the retail business. 
Target was achieved for IED plans. 
Target was achieved for volume of commercially advantaged fuel combustion. 
Stretch target was achieved for value added from commodity trading.

Remuneration Committee report
The Board determines personal performance objectives for each executive director. The Committee assesses performance 
against these objectives and applies an individual performance multiplier of between zero and 1.5. 
To determine the actual bonus awarded to each executive director, the target bonus is multiplied by the corporate score 
and by the personal score, subject to a cap of two times the target bonus. 
For bonus awards in 2011, the target bonus for the Chief Executive and the other executive directors was 65% and 60% of 
base salary respectively. The maximum bonus was 130% and 120% respectively. 75% of any bonus award is paid in cash 
and 25% is deferred in shares that vest after three years and are forfeited if the executive leaves the Group other than as 
a “good leaver” before the shares vest. 
The target and maximum bonus percentages for 2012 for the Chief Executive and the other executive directors are the same 
as in 2011, and bonus measures and targets have been set using a similar process to that used previously. The corporate 
scorecard weightings are 30% financial, 15% safety and production, 5% retail and 50% strategic and Business Plan. 
The weightings are set out in the following table:

Conditional share awards under the Bonus Matching Plan 
The Group operates the BMP as a long-term performance share plan. Awards under the BMP have been made in 2009, 2010 
and 2011. 
Under the BMP executive directors and other senior executives receive an annual grant of conditional shares to a value 
of up to 1.5 times the amount of the executive’s annual bonus for the prior year. No payment is made for the shares. 
However, vesting is subject to service and performance conditions. 
In respect of existing awards, 33% of awards granted to those members of senior management who are not members of the 
Executive Committee will vest on the third anniversary of grant provided that the participant is still employed by the Group. 
Awards granted to members of the Executive Committee and the balance (i.e. 67%) of the awards granted to other members 
of senior management will vest on the third anniversary of grant provided the participant is still employed by the Group and 
subject to achievement of performance conditions determined by the Committee and described below.

The Scorecard condition 
50% of the BMP award subject to performance conditions will vest by reference to the Company’s performance against 
the average outcome from the Scorecard over the three year performance period (the Scorecard award). 
The Scorecard award will vest by reference to the average of the outputs of the Scorecard for each of the three years 
reported on during the performance period, commencing at the start of the financial year in which the BMP award is made. 
The averaging calculation is capped although the annual result on which the three year calculation will be made will not, 
for this purpose, be so capped. 
It is then proposed that the Scorecard award will vest at the end of the three year performance period as follows: 
Average Scorecard outcome 
% of Scorecard Award vesting
<1 
0%
1  
15%(1)
1.5  
100%(1)
Notes: 
(1) Straight-line vesting between 15% and 100% for average result between 1 and 1.5. 
In addition, at the end of the three year performance period the Remuneration Committee will ratify each of the annual results 
going into the average Scorecard calculation and has the discretion to adjust the final outcome based on events over the 
period to ensure an outcome that is consistent with the underlying performance progression of the business. In exercising its 
discretion the Committee will pay particular regard to progress against the strategic objectives incorporated in the Scorecard 
including sustainable development of biomass generation and the development of the Haven Power supply business. 
In addition, the Committee must be satisfied that there has also been a demonstrable and sustainable improvement in 
the Company’s performance over the period. In determining this, the Committee will take into account all relevant factors 
but in particular will consider improvement in the Company’s financial, production and trading performance. 
Pension 
Executive directors are entitled to non-contributory membership of the Group’s defined contribution pension plan. 
The employer’s contribution for executive directors is 20% of base salary.  
Alternatively, at their option, executive directors may either have contributions of the same amounts made to their personal 
pension schemes or cash in lieu of pension at the stated rate and subject to normal statutory deductions; or a combination of 
pension contributions up to £50,000 per annum with the remainder as cash in lieu of pension. Details of pension contributions 
for executive directors and of payments in lieu are included in the Directors’ emoluments table in Part 2 of this report. 
the Company’s TSR over the three year period measured from the start 
relative to the TSR over the same period of the companies comprising the FTSE51—150 (the Comparator Group). TSR is the  
return received by a Drax shareholder through appreciation in the share price, plus dividends assumed to be reinvested in  
Drax shares.

Benefits in kind (car, private medical cover, etc.) 
Car allowance 
The Company’s policy is to offer a car allowance to executive directors and to certain senior 
managers, according to their role. The annual allowance is currently: 
 
£17,500 per annum for the Chief Executive; 
 
£12,000 per annum for other executive directors; and 
 
£9,000 per annum for senior managers whose remuneration is determined by the Committee.
Life assurance 
Life assurance (in a sum assured of four times base salary) is provided for the executive 
directors and senior managers. 
Private medical cover  
The Company’s policy is to offer BUPA private medical cover to all employees within the 
Group, on a non-contributory or discounted basis according to the subsidiary company’s 
policy. The executive directors and senior managers receive medical cover for them and 
their dependants. 
Relocation expenses and 
second base expenses 
Relocation expenses are paid where appropriate. Second base expenses provide an allowance 
towards the cost of accommodation and travel when a director or senior manager is required 
to spend a significant amount of time at two Drax locations.

Notes: 
(1) Includes Board Committee membership fees paid as separate amounts. 
(2) The annual bonus assumes an “on target” performance yielding a bonus of 65% of base salary for Dorothy Thompson and 60% of base salary for the other 
executive directors, of which 25% is required to be deferred into shares. 
(3) Covers car allowance and second base expenses only. The cost of other benefits such as BUPA and additional life cover is not easily predicted because they are 
subject to price variation (the amount of which depends on personal circumstances at the time) during the year. 
(4) Annual contribution by the Company to the directors’ pension plans or cash in lieu. 
All employee share plans 
The Committee operates a Savings-Related Share Option Plan (“SAYE”) and a Share Incentive Plan (“SIP”), both of which are 
approved by HM Revenue & Customs and must be operated on an all employee basis. The executive directors may participate 
in each plan upon the same terms as other employees. The plans are the main vehicles for aligning staff with TSR. 
SAYE 
The SAYE provides for the grant of options (which, at the Committee’s discretion, may be offered at a discount of up to 20% 
to the market price of a share determined in accordance with the rules of the plan) linked to a savings contract which pays 
interest at a statutory rate. The plan was operated in 2006 and again in 2010 and 2011, so that (subject to the statutory upper 
aggregate limit of £250 per month on an individual’s savings under all SAYE plans) a participating employee could choose 
to save for either or both periods of three or five years. 
In each year of operation, options have been granted at the permitted discount of 20% to the prevailing share price 
(determined in accordance with the plan rules) resulting in option prices of: 
2006 — 636.00 pence per share 
2010 — 310.50 pence per share 
2011 — 321.00 pence per share 
Options may be exercised upon successful completion of the three or five year savings contract to which they are linked.

The five year contracts under the 2006 Plan matured on 1 July 2011. The market price of Drax Group plc shares from the 
maturity date up to the end of the exercise period peaked at 581.50 pence per share, which was well below the option price 
of 636 pence per share. Therefore all options under this plan lapsed on 31 December 2011.  
Details of the SAYE options held by the executive directors are shown in the table in Part 2 of this report. 
On 14 February 2012, the Committee agreed that invitations to the SAYE be made again in 2012, following the preliminary 
results announcement. The 20% discount to the market price is applied and participants will be able to take out SAYE
contracts over three and five years and contribute in total no more than £250 per month. 
SIP 
In any one tax year, the Committee may operate the SIP for the benefit of participants using any combination of the 
following elements: 
−�award Free Shares (up to £3,000 in value); 
−�allow the purchase of Partnership Shares (up to £1,500 in value subject to an overriding maximum of 10% of salary); 
−�allocate free Matching Shares (in a maximum ratio of two Matching Shares for each Partnership Share); and 
−�allow the investment in shares of dividends received in respect of SIP shares. 
The table below details how the SIP has been operated between 2006 and 2009: 
 
2006

SIP Free Share Award(1) Participants received

Participants received £2,500 worth of shares in 
each year. 
Participants received 
£1,000 worth of shares. 
Partnership Share 
Participants were allowed to invest up to the maximum permitted of £1,500 (subject to an overriding 
maximum of 10% of salary) in each year. 
Matching Share 
Award  
(1)
Partnership Shares matched on a one-for-one basis in each year. 
Notes: 
(1) The SIP Trustee was funded by the Group to purchase the required Free and Matching Shares in order to avoid any dilution. 
In accordance with the plan rules, shares taken up by an employee are allocated to a trustee which holds them on behalf of 
the employee. Under normal circumstances, the employee will receive the shares from the trustee without incurring a tax 
liability once the shares have been held in trust for five years. The employee is entitled to receive dividends paid in respect 
of the shares held in trust. 
Details of the shares allocated to executive directors under the SIP are shown in the table in Part 2 of this report. 
The SIP has not operated since 2009.  
Provision of shares for share plans — dilution 
All equity-based plans are funded through the issuance of shares, or through the purchase of shares in the marketplace 
through a trust, subject to an overall dilution limit for all employee share plans of no more than 10% of share capital in 
any ten year period and a limit of 5% of share capital in any ten year period for the Company’s discretionary share plans 
(e.g. BMP). 
The current estimated dilution from subsisting awards, including executive and all employee share awards, is less than 0.5% 
of the shares in issue at the date of this report. 
Share ownership guidelines 
The Company has share ownership guidelines for executives participating in its performance share plans. They are 100% 
and 50% of base salary for executive directors and other senior manager BMP participants, respectively. 
Those who receive shares by virtue of share plan awards or who receive deferred bonus shares must retain 50% of the net 
(that is, after income tax and national insurance contributions) shares received until the applicable guideline is reached. 
No shares have vested since the introduction of the relevant performance share plan.

Service contracts 
Executive directors’ service agreements are of indefinite duration, terminable at any time by either party giving 12 months’ 
prior notice except that the contracts of Peter Emery and Paul Taylor are terminable by them providing six months’ notice 
to the Company. 
Under each of the executive directors’ service agreements other than the Chief Executive’s, Drax has the right to make a 
payment in lieu of notice of termination, the amount of that payment being the salary and benefits that would have accrued 
to the executive director during the contractual notice period. 
The following table shows for each person who has served as a director of the Company at any time during the year ended 
31 December 2011, the commencement date and term of the service agreement or contract for services, and details of the 
notice periods. No service agreement now includes any operative provision for the payment of compensation upon early 
termination. Any compensation payable in those circumstances would need to be negotiated at the time and in the light 
of the circumstances.

Notes: 
(1) Mike Grasby retired as a director on 13 April 2011. 
Directors’ service agreements and contracts for services are available for inspection at the Company’s registered office during 
normal hours of business and will be available at the place of the AGM from 10.30am until the close of the meeting. 
External appointments 
The Committee recognises that executive directors may be invited to become non-executive directors of other companies  
executive director who accepts an external appointment having had the prior approval of the Board should retain the fees 
payable in respect of the appointment. Dorothy Thompson is a non-executive director of Johnson Matthey plc and received 
£50,000 in fees for that appointment during 2011. 
Non-executive directors 
The Chairman and non-executive directors receive fees in respect of their services. They do not receive any pension 
or benefits in kind, nor are they eligible for any annual performance bonus or any of the share-based reward plans. 
The Chairman’s notice period is six months whilst the other non-executive directors have a notice period of one month. 
The remuneration of the Chairman is determined by the Committee whilst that of the other non-executive directors 
is determined by the Chairman and the executive directors. This is designed to: 
−�recognise prevailing market rates for the Chairman’s and non-executive directors’ fees in other listed companies 
of a similar market value or turnover to Drax; 
−�reflect the responsibilities and time commitment; and 
−�attract and retain individuals with the necessary skills and experience to contribute to the future growth of the Company. 
Chairman 
The Committee determined that the Chairman’s remuneration should be increased from £200,000 to £220,000 per annum 
with effect from 1 April 2011. This was the first increase in the Chairman’s remuneration since his appointment in April 2008 
and was agreed on the basis that it would not be increased further until at least April 2013. This is reflected in the table of 
annualised rates of pay on page 74.  
and that such appointments can broaden their knowledge and experience to the benefit of the Group. The policy is that an

Other non-executive directors 
The fees for non-executive directors were determined in April 2009 as shown below: 
Basic fee 
£52,500 per annum
Senior Independent Director (to include chair of a committee other than the Audit Committee)  
£10,000 per annum
Audit Committee Chairmanship  
£10,000 per annum
Other Committee Chairmanship 
£7,500 per annum
Value of £100 invested 
The following graph shows how the value of £100 invested in the Company on 31 December 2006 has changed and compares 
that performance with the changing value of the same amount invested at the same time in the FTSE100 and FTSE250 
indices. These indices have been chosen as suitable broad comparators against which the Company’s shareholders may judge 
their relative returns given that, in recent years, the Company has been a member of both the FTSE100 and FTSE250 indices. 
The graph reflects the TSR (determined according to usual market practice) for the Company and each of the indices referred 
to on a cumulative basis over the period from 31 December 2006 to 31 December 2011.

To the members of Drax Group plc 
We have audited the Group financial statements of Drax Group plc for the year ended 31 December 2011 which comprise the 
Consolidated income statement, the Consolidated statement of comprehensive income, the Consolidated balance sheet, the 
Consolidated statement of changes in equity, the Consolidated cash flow statement and the related notes 1 to 32. The financial 
reporting framework that has been applied in their preparation is applicable law and International Financial Reporting 
Standards (“IFRSs”) as adopted by the European Union. 
This report is made solely to the Company’s members, as a body, in accordance with Chapter 3 of Part 16 of the Companies 
Act 2006. Our audit work has been undertaken so that we might state to the Company’s members those matters we are 
required to state to them in an auditor’s report and for no other purpose. To the fullest extent permitted by law, we do not 
accept or assume responsibility to anyone other than the Company and the Company’s members as a body, for our audit 
work, for this report, or for the opinions we have formed. 
Respective responsibilities of directors and auditor 
As explained more fully in the Directors’ responsibilities statement, the directors are responsible for the preparation of the 
Group financial statements and for being satisfied that they give a true and fair view. Our responsibility is to audit and express 
an opinion on the Group financial statements in accordance with applicable law and International Standards on Auditing (UK 
and Ireland). Those standards require us to comply with the Auditing Practices Board’s Ethical Standards for Auditors. 
Scope of the audit of the financial statements 
An audit involves obtaining evidence about the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements sufficient to give 
reasonable assurance that the financial statements are free from material misstatement, whether caused by fraud or error. 
This includes an assessment of: whether the accounting policies are appropriate to the Group’s circumstances and have been 
consistently applied and adequately disclosed; the reasonableness of significant accounting estimates made by the directors; 
and the overall presentation of the financial statements. In addition, we read all the financial and non-financial information in 
the annual report to identify material inconsistencies with the audited financial statements. If we become aware of any 
apparent material misstatements or inconsistencies we consider the implications for our Report.  
Opinion on financial statements 
In our opinion the Group financial statements: 
−�give a true and fair view of the state of the Group’s affairs as at 31 December 2011 and of its profit for the year then ended; 
−�have been properly prepared in accordance with IFRSs as adopted by the European Union; and 
−�have been prepared in accordance with the requirements of the Companies Act 2006 and Article 4 of the IAS Regulation. 
Opinion on other matters prescribed by the Companies Act 2006 
In our opinion the information given in the Directors’ report for the financial year for which the financial statements are 
prepared is consistent with the Group financial statements. 
Matters on which we are required to report by exception 
We have nothing to report in respect of the following: 
Under the Companies Act 2006 we are required to report to you if, in our opinion: 
−�certain disclosures of directors’ remuneration specified by law are not made; or 
−�we have not received all the information and explanations we require for our audit. 
Under the Listing Rules we are required to review: 
−�the directors’ statement contained within the Directors’ report in relation to going concern;  
−�the part of the Corporate governance statement relating to the Company’s compliance with the nine provisions of the 
UK Corporate Governance Code specified for our review; and 
−�certain elements of the report to shareholders by the Board on directors’ remuneration. 
Other matters 
We have reported separately on the parent company financial statements of Drax Group plc for the year ended 31 December 
2011 and on the information in the Directors’ remuneration report that is described as having been audited.

1. General information 
Drax Group plc (the “Company”) is incorporated in England and Wales under the Companies Act. The Company and 
its subsidiaries (together the “Group”) operate in the electricity generation and supply industry within the UK. The address 
of the Company’s registered office and principal establishment is Drax Power Station, Selby, North Yorkshire YO8 8PH, 
United Kingdom. The operating companies of the Group are disclosed in note 3 to the Company’s separate financial 
statements, which follow these consolidated financial statements. The principal activities of the Group are the generation 
and sale of electricity and by-products of the electricity generation process at Drax Power Station, Selby, North Yorkshire 
and the sale of electricity to business customers by Haven Power Limited (“Haven Power”).  
2. Basis of preparation 
The financial statements have been prepared in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards (“IFRSs”) 
adopted by the European Union and therefore the consolidated financial statements comply with Article 4 of the EU  
The financial statements have been prepared on a going concern basis, as set out in the Operational and financial review on 
page 29, and on the historical cost basis, except for certain financial assets and liabilities that have been measured at fair value.  
Adoption of new and revised accounting standards 
In 2011, several new, revised and amended standards and interpretations became effective. These are IAS 24 (revised) 
“Related party disclosures”, IFRS 1 (amendment) “First time adoption: financial instrument disclosure”, IAS 32 (amendment) 
“Financial instruments: Presentation on classification of rights issues”, IFRIC 19 “Extinguishing financial liabilities with equity 
instruments”, IFRIC 14 “Prepayments of a minimum funding requirement”, and Improvements to IFRSs (2010). The adoption 
of these standards and interpretations has not had a material impact on the financial statements of the Group. 
At the date of authorisation of these financial statements, the following standards and relevant interpretations, which have 
not been applied in these financial statements, were in issue but not yet effective (and some of which were pending 
endorsement by the EU). 
−�IFRS 1 (amendment) “Severe hyperinflation and removal of fixed dates for first-time adopters” — effective for accounting 
periods beginning on or after 1 July 2011. 
−�IFRS 7 (amendment) “Financial instruments: Disclosures on derecognition” — effective for accounting periods beginning 
on or after 1 July 2011. 
−�IFRS 9 “Financial instruments — Classification and measurement” — effective for accounting periods beginning on or after 
1 January 2015.  
−�IFRS 10 “Consolidated financial statements” — effective for accounting periods beginning on or after 1 January 2013.  
−�IFRS 11 “Joint arrangements” — effective for accounting periods beginning on or after 1 January 2013.  
−�IFRS 12 “Disclosure of interests in other entities” — effective for accounting periods beginning on or after 1 January 2013.  
−�IFRS 13 “Fair value measurement” — effective for accounting periods beginning on or after 1 January 2013.  
−�IAS 1 (amendment) “Presentation of financial statements — Other comprehensive income” — effective for accounting 
periods beginning on or after 1 July 2012. 
−�IAS 12 (amendment) “Deferred tax: Recovery of underlying assets” — effective for accounting periods beginning on or after 
1 January 2012. 
−�IAS 19 (revised) “Employee benefits” — effective for accounting periods beginning on or after 1 January 2013.  
−�IAS 27 (revised) “Separate financial statements” — effective for accounting periods beginning on or after 1 January 2013. 
−�IAS 28 (revised) “Investments in associates and joint ventures” — effective for accounting periods beginning on or after 
1 January 2013. 
The Group is yet to assess the full impact of adoption of IFRS 9 and IFRS 13, and intends to adopt both standards no later 
than the accounting period beginning on or after 1 January 2015 and 1 January 2013 respectively, subject to endorsement 
by the EU. 
Adoption of the other standards in future periods is not expected to have a material impact on the financial statements 
of the Group.

Notes to the consolidated ﬁnancial statements
3. Summary of significant accounting policies 
The principal accounting policies adopted in the preparation of these financial statements are set out below. These policies 
have been consistently applied to both years presented, unless otherwise stated. 
(A) Basis of consolidation 
The consolidated financial statements incorporate the financial statements of the Company and entities controlled by 
the financial and operating policies of an investee entity so as to obtain benefits from its activities. 
All intra-group transactions, balances, income and expenses are eliminated on consolidation. 
(B) Critical accounting judgements, estimates and assumptions 
The preparation of financial statements in conformity with IFRSs requires the use of estimates and assumptions that affect 
the reported amounts of assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues 
and expenses during the reporting period. Although these estimates are based on management’s reasonable knowledge of 
the amount, event or actions, actual results ultimately may differ from those estimates. The critical accounting judgements, 
estimates and assumptions that have a significant risk of causing a material adjustment to the carrying amounts of assets 
and liabilities within the next financial year are discussed below. 
Property, plant and equipment — Estimated useful lives and residual values are reviewed annually, taking into account prices 
prevailing at each balance sheet date. The carrying values of property, plant and equipment are also reviewed for impairment 
where there has been a trigger event (that is, an event which may have resulted in impairment) by assessing the present value 
of estimated future cash flows and net realisable value compared with net book value. The calculation of estimated future 
cash flows and residual values is based on management’s reasonable estimates of future prices, output and costs, and is 
therefore subjective. 
Impairment — The Group tests annually whether goodwill has suffered any impairment, in accordance with the accounting 
policy stated in note 3 (E). The recoverable amounts of cash-generating units have been determined based on value in use 
calculations. These calculations require the use of estimates (see note 10). 
Pensions — The Group operates an approved defined benefit scheme. The cost of providing benefits is determined using the 
projected unit credit method and actuarial valuations of the plan assets and liabilities are carried out as at the balance sheet 
date. Inherent in these valuations are key assumptions, including discount rates, inflation rates, expected returns on scheme 
assets, salary and pension increases, and mortality rates.  
These actuarial assumptions are reviewed annually and modified as appropriate. The Group believes that the assumptions 
utilised in recording obligations under the scheme are reasonable based on prior experience, market conditions and the advice 
of scheme actuaries. However, actual results may differ from such assumptions. 
Taxation — In accounting for taxation the Group makes assumptions regarding the treatment of items of income and 
expenditure for tax purposes. The Group believes that these assumptions are reasonable based on prior experience and 
consultation with advisers.  
Full provision is made for deferred taxation at the rates of tax prevailing at the period end dates unless future rates have  
be recovered, taking into account the nature of the losses, and the certainty of the relevant offsetting income streams. 
Derivatives — Derivative financial instruments are stated in the balance sheet at their fair value. Changes in the fair value 
of derivatives are recorded each period in earnings unless specific hedge accounting criteria are met. The fair values of 
derivative instruments for commodities and foreign exchange rates are determined using forward price curves. Forward price 
curves represent the Group’s estimates of the prices at which a buyer or seller could contract today for delivery or settlement 
of a commodity or foreign exchange payment or receipt, at future dates. The Group generally bases forward price curves 
upon readily obtainable market price quotations, as the Group’s commodity and forward foreign exchange contracts do not 
generally extend beyond the actively traded portion of these curves. However, the forward price curves used are only an 
estimate of how future prices will move and are, therefore, subjective. 
(C) Revenue recognition 
Revenue represents amounts receivable for goods or services provided in the normal course of business, net of trade 
discounts, VAT and other sales-related taxes, and excluding transactions with or between group companies. 
Revenues from the sale of electricity are recorded based upon output delivered at rates specified under contract terms 
or prevailing market rates as applicable. 
Revenues from sales of ROCs are recorded at the invoiced value, net of VAT. Revenue is recognised when the risks 
and rewards of ownership have been substantially transferred to a third party.  
the Company made up to the reporting date each year. Control is achieved where the Company has the power to govern 
been substantively enacted. Deferred tax assets are recognised where it is considered more likely than not that they will

Governance
Where goods or services are exchanged for goods or services of a similar nature and value, the exchange is not treated 
as giving rise to revenue. Where goods or services are exchanged for goods or services of a dissimilar nature, the exchange 
is treated as giving rise to revenue. The revenue is measured at the fair value of goods or services received, adjusted by 
the amount of any cash or cash equivalents received or paid. If the fair value of the goods or services received cannot 
be measured reliably, the revenue is measured at the fair value of the goods or services given up, adjusted by the amount 
of any cash or cash equivalents received or paid. 
Revenue from the sale of electricity direct to customers through our retail business, Haven Power is recorded after deduction 
of trade discounts, VAT and Climate Change Levy. Revenue is recognised on the supply of electricity when a contract exists, 
supply has taken place, a quantifiable price has been established or can be determined and the receivables are likely to  
calculated based on consumption statistics and selling  
(D) Segmental reporting 
The business activity of the Group consists of the generation and sale of electricity at Drax Power Station, along with the sale 
of electricity direct to customers through our retail business, Haven Power. As a result of the growth in the retail business, this 
segment has become more significant during the year ended 31 December 2011, and therefore the results of this segment are 
separately disclosed from 1 January 2011, along with comparatives for the year ended 31 December 2010 (see note 4). 
(E) Goodwill 
Goodwill arising on an acquisition is recognised as an asset and initially measured at cost, being the excess of the cost of 
the business combination over the Group’s interest in the net fair value of the identifiable assets, liabilities and contingent 
liabilities recognised. Goodwill which is recognised as an asset is reviewed for impairment at least annually. Any impairment 
is recognised immediately in the income statement and is not subsequently reversed.  
For the purpose of impairment testing, goodwill is allocated to each of the Group’s cash-generating units expected to benefit 
from the synergies of the combination. Cash-generating units to which goodwill has been allocated are tested for impairment 
annually or more frequently where there is an indication it may be impaired. If the recoverable amount of the cash-generating 
unit is less than its carrying amount, the impairment loss is allocated first to reduce the carrying amount of goodwill and then 
to its other assets. 
On disposal of a subsidiary, the attributable amount of goodwill is included in the determination of the profit or loss

Property, plant and equipment are initially measured at cost. Cost comprises the purchase price (after deducting trade 
discounts and rebates), any directly attributable costs of bringing the asset to the location and condition necessary

Estimated useful lives and residual values are reviewed annually, taking into account commercial and technological 
obsolescence as well as normal wear and tear, and any provision for impairment. Residual values are based on prices 
prevailing at each balance sheet date. 
Costs relating to major inspections, overhauls and upgrades to the power station are included in the asset’s carrying amount 
or recognised as a separate asset, as appropriate, if the recognition criteria are met; namely, when it is probable that future 
economic benefits associated with the item will flow to the Group and the cost of the item can be measured reliably. All other

3. Summary of significant accounting policies (continued) 
(G) Impairment of property, plant and equipment 
At each balance sheet date the Group reviews its property, plant and equipment to determine whether there is any indication 
that these assets may have suffered an impairment loss. If such an indication exists, the recoverable amount is assessed by 
reference to the net present value of expected future cash flows of the asset (value in use) or sales value net of expenses. 
If an asset is impaired, a provision is made to reduce its carrying amount to the estimated recoverable amount. The discount 
rate applied is a pre-tax rate based upon the Group’s weighted average cost of capital and reflects the current market 
assessment of the time value of money and the risks specific to the business. 
(H) Decommissioning costs 
Provision is made for the estimated decommissioning costs at the end of the useful economic life of the Group’s generating 
assets, when a legal or constructive obligation arises, on a discounted basis. The amount provided represents the present 
value of the expected costs. The discount rate used is a risk free pre-tax rate, reflecting the fact that the estimated future cash 
flows have built in risks specific to the liability. An amount equivalent to the discounted provision is capitalised within property, 
plant and equipment and is depreciated over the useful lives of the related assets. The unwinding of the discount is included 
in interest payable and similar charges. 
(I) Inventories 
Inventories primarily comprise coal and biomass stocks, together with other fuels and consumables. Coal and biomass stocks 
are valued at the lower of the weighted average cost and net realisable value. Other stocks of fuel and consumables are 
valued at the lower of average cost and net realisable value. 
(J) ROC assets 
The Group is able to claim ROCs from the Office of Gas and Electricity Markets (“OFGEM”) as a result of burning renewable 
fuels instead of coal. A market exists for the sale of ROCs and the Group recognises revenue in the income statement at the 
point where the risks and rewards of ownership have been substantially transferred to a third party. In respect of ROCs 
earned but not yet sold, the attributable incremental cost of generating ROCs above that of burning coal, limited to the 
recoverable amount expected to be realised, is included within current intangible assets.  
(K) CO2 emissions allowances 
The Group recognises its free emissions allowances received under the UK NAP at £nil cost allocated to each financial year 
on a straight line basis. Any additional allowances purchased in the market are recorded at cost, within intangible assets. 
The Group also recognises a liability in respect of its unsettled obligations to deliver emissions allowances. The charge to 
the income statement within fuel costs and the liability is measured based on an estimate of the amounts that will be required 
to satisfy the net obligation, taking into account generation, free allowances allocated under the UK NAP, market purchases, 
sales and forward contracts already in place allocated to the financial year, and the market price at the balance sheet date. 
(L) Taxation 
Current tax is provided at amounts expected to be paid (or recovered) using the tax rates and laws that have been enacted 
or substantively enacted by the balance sheet date. 
Deferred tax is the tax payable or recoverable on the difference between the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities in the 
balance sheet and the corresponding tax bases used in the computation of taxable profits. Deferred tax liabilities are generally 
recognised for all taxable temporary differences and deferred tax assets are recognised to the extent that it is considered 
more likely than not that taxable profit will be available against which deductible temporary differences can be utilised. 
Deferred tax is calculated at the tax rates that have been substantively enacted at the balance sheet date and are expected to 
apply in the period in which the liability is settled or the asset is realised, and is charged or credited in the income statement, 
except where it relates to items charged or credited to equity via the statement of comprehensive income, in which case the 
deferred tax is also dealt with in equity and is shown in the statement of comprehensive income. 
(M) Pension and other post-retirement benefits 
The Group provides pensions through an approved industry defined benefit scheme and a defined contribution scheme. 
The cost of providing benefits under the defined benefit scheme is determined using the projected unit credit method, and 
actuarial valuations of the plan assets and liabilities are carried out as at the balance sheet date. Actuarial gains and losses 
are recognised in full in the statement of comprehensive income. 
The current service cost of the pension charge is deducted in arriving at operating profit in other operating and administrative 
expenses. The net interest cost of the pension charge is now included in finance costs and therefore deducted in arriving 
at profit before tax. This presentational change has resulted in the reclassification of £1.3 million costs in 2010 from salaries, 
in other operating and administrative expenses, to finance costs. The excess of the present value of the defined benefit 
obligation over the fair value of the plan assets is recognised as a liability in the balance sheet.

Governance
For the defined contribution scheme, the Group pays contributions to publicly or privately administered pension insurance 
plans on a mandatory, contractual or voluntary basis. The Group has no further payment obligations once the contributions 
have been paid. The contributions are recognised as employee benefit expense when they are due to be paid. 
(N) Share-based payments 
Share-based payments are measured at fair value at the date of grant and expensed on a straight line basis over the relevant 
vesting period, based on an estimate of the shares that will ultimately vest.  
(O) Foreign currencies 
The Group’s consolidated financial statements are presented in sterling, which is the functional and presentational currency 
of the Company and its principal subsidiaries. Transactions in foreign currencies are translated into sterling at the exchange 
rate ruling at the date of transaction. Foreign exchange gains and losses resulting from the settlement of such transactions, 
and from the translation at the exchange rate ruling at the balance sheet date of monetary assets and liabilities denominated 
in foreign currencies, are recognised in the income statement. 
(P) Financial instruments 
Debt instruments 
The Group measures all debt instruments, whether financial assets or financial liabilities, initially at the fair value of the 
consideration paid or received. Subsequent to initial measurement, debt instruments are measured at amortised cost using 
the effective interest method. Transaction costs (any such costs incremental and directly attributable to the issue of the 
financial instrument) are included in the calculation of the effective interest rate and are, in effect, amortised through the 
income statement over the life of the instrument.  
Fees paid on the establishment of loan facilities are recognised as transaction costs of the loan to the extent that it is probable 
that some or all of the facility will be drawn down. In this case, the fee is deferred until the draw-down occurs.  
Commodity contracts and treasury derivatives  
Where possible, the Group takes the own use exemption for commodity contracts entered into and held for the purpose of 
the Group’s own purchase, sale or usage requirements. Commodity contracts which do not qualify for the own use exemption 
are dealt with as derivatives and are recorded at fair value in the balance sheet with changes in fair value reflected through 
the hedge reserve to the extent that contracts are treated as effective hedges, or the income statement to the extent the 
contracts are not treated as effective hedges. 
The Group designates certain hedging instruments used to address commodity price risk as cash flow hedges. At the  
ent and hedged item is documented, along with its risk 
management objectives. Furthermore, at the inception of the hedge and on an ongoing basis, the Group documents whether 
the hedging instruments used in hedging transactions are highly effective in offsetting changes in cash flows of hedged items. 
The Group also uses treasury related derivatives to manage exposure to currency fluctuations. Treasury related derivatives 
are recorded at fair value in the balance sheet with changes in fair value reflected through the hedge reserve to the extent 
that contracts are considered to be effective cash flow hedges, or the income statement to the extent the contracts are not 
effective as hedges.  
The effective portion of changes in the fair value of derivatives that are designated and qualify as cash flow hedges are 
deferred in equity. The gain or loss relating to any ineffective portion is recognised immediately in the income statement. 
Amounts deferred in equity are released in the periods when the hedged item is recognised in the income statement. 
The fair value of hedging derivatives is classified as a non-current asset or non-current liability if the remaining maturity 
of the hedge relationship is more than 12 months, and as a current asset or liability if the remaining maturity of the hedge 
relationship is less than 12 months. Derivatives not designated into an effective hedge relationship are classified as a current 
asset or current liability. 
Other financial instruments 
Issued equity — Ordinary shares are classified as equity as evidenced by their residual interest in the assets of the Company 
after deducting all of its liabilities. Incremental costs directly attributable to the issue of new shares or options are shown in 
equity as a deduction, net of tax, from the proceeds. The share premium account records the difference between the nominal 
value of shares issued and the fair value of the consideration received. 
Cash and cash equivalents — Cash and cash equivalents includes cash in hand, deposits held at call with banks, other 
short-term highly liquid investments with original maturities of three months or less, and bank overdrafts.  
Short-term investments — Short-term investments includes cash held on deposits with financial institutions, with a maturity 
of greater than three months at inception. 
Trade and other receivables and payables — Trade and other receivables and payables are measured at amortised cost using 
the effective interest method. A provision for impairment of trade receivables is established subsequently where there is 
objective evidence that the Group will not be able to collect all amounts due according to the original terms of the receivable. 
Interest income is recognised by applying the effective interest rate, except for short-term items where the recognition 
of interest would be immaterial.

4. Segmental reporting 
Information reported to the Board and for the purposes of assessing performance and making investment decisions 
is organised into two operating segments. The Group’s operating segments under IFRS 8 are as follows: 
Generation — The generation of electricity at Drax Power Station. 
Retail — The supply of electricity to retail customers in the small and medium enterprise and industrial and commercial markets. 
The measure of profit or loss for each reportable segment, presented to the Board on a regular basis is EBITDA. Assets and working 
capital are monitored on a Group basis, with no separate disclosure of asset by segment made in the management accounts, and 
hence no separate asset disclosure is provided here.

Following the refinancing of our letter of credit, working capital and term loan facilities in July 2011 (see note 18), the deferred 
finance costs in relation to our previous bank facilities have been accelerated. This resulted in a one-time £2.6 million interest 
charge in the year ended 31 December 2011. 
7. Taxation 
The income tax expense reflects the estimated effective tax rate on profit before tax for the Group for the year ended 
31 December 2011 and the movement in the deferred tax balance in the year, so far as it relates to items recognised in the 
income statement. 
Exceptional items 
Under the Group’s previous financing structure, Drax Holdings Limited (a subsidiary company) was partially funded by a 
Eurobond payable to another group company. This Eurobond debt structure was unwound in 2008, potentially accelerating 
additional tax losses with a cash tax benefit of up to £220 million. Because of the risks related to the unwinding of the 
Eurobond structure, no benefit was recognised in the Group’s financial statements prior to agreement with HMRC. 
On 5 April 2011, we reached agreement with HMRC, resulting in the resolution of the Eurobond tax position and certain smaller 
legacy tax matters. Accordingly, we have recognised an exceptional tax credit of £197.9 million in the income statement. 
This includes a current tax credit of £149.5 million and a deferred tax credit of £48.4 million. 
Changes in the rate of corporation tax 
Following the announcement of the 2011 Budget, the Finance Act 2011 (the “Act”) was enacted by Parliament in July 2011. 
The Act confirmed reductions in the rate of corporation tax from 27% to 26% from April 2011, and from 26% to 25% from 
April 2012, both of which were enacted during the year. In addition, in the 2011 Budget, the Government proposed further 
reductions in the rate of corporation tax from 25% to 23% by 2014. These proposals had not been substantively enacted 
at the balance sheet date. It is currently expected that each future Finance Bill will reduce the corporation tax rate by 1% 
until the rate of 23% is effective.

£43.1 million) payable on or before 11 May 2012. The final dividend has not been included as a liability as at 31 December 2011. 
9. Earnings per share 
Basic earnings per share is calculated by dividing the earnings attributable to ordinary shareholders by the weighted average 
number of ordinary shares outstanding during the year. In calculating diluted earnings per share the weighted average 
number of ordinary shares outstanding during the year is adjusted, when relevant, to take account of outstanding share 
options in relation to the Group’s Approved Savings-Related Share Option Plan (“SAYE Plan”) and contingently issuable 
shares under the Group’s Executive Share Incentive Plan (“ESIP”) and Bonus Matching Plan (“BMP”). The underlying earnings 
per share has been calculated after excluding the after tax impact of marking-to-market derivative contracts which are not 
hedged, and exceptional items.

£m
Cost and carrying amount: 
At 1 January 2010, 31 December 2010 and 31 December 2011 
10.7
Goodwill arising on the Haven Power acquisition has been allocated to the Haven cash-generating unit (Haven Power Limited, 
or Haven Power). At 31 December 2011, the fair value of goodwill was significantly in excess of its book value; accordingly 
a sensitivity analysis has not been disclosed.  
The recoverable amount of Haven Power was calculated based on a value in use calculation. The key assumptions used 
in these calculations are those regarding the discount rates and future cash flows. Management estimates discount rates 
using pre-tax rates that reflect current market assessments of the time value of money and the risks specific to the business. 
The first five years of cash flows are based upon the five year Business Plan approved by the Board. Future cash flows have 
been taken in perpetuity, assuming no growth rate is applied to the final year of the Business Plan. The pre-tax rate used to 
discount the forecast cash flows from Haven Power is 12% reflecting a reasonable assumption of the applicable cost of capital.

Trade receivables principally represent sales of electricity to a number of counterparties. At 31 December 2011, the Group had 
amounts receivable from three (2010: three) significant counterparties, representing 71% (2010: 75%) of trade receivables, 
all of which paid within 15 days of receipt of invoice in line with agreed terms. Counterparty risk is discussed in note 19. 
Management does not consider there to be a significant concentration of credit risk and as a result, does not believe that a 
further credit risk provision is required in excess of the normal provision for doubtful debts of £3.0 million (2010: £2.6 million). 
This allowance has been determined by reference to past default experience, and includes £3.0 million in relation to Haven 
Power (2010: £2.6 million).

Scheduled term loan repayments of £33.8 million were made on 30 June 2011, and £32.5 million on each of 30 June 2010 
and 31 December 2010. These repayments were made in line with the target repayment profile as a result of the levels of cash 
available for debt service. 
Refinancing 
On 28 July 2011, we completed the refinancing of our letter of credit, working capital and term loan facilities, which were due 
to mature in December 2012. These facilities were replaced with a £310 million revolving credit facility which matures in April 
2014, which can be used for both letters of credit and working capital purposes. The margin over LIBOR on our new facility 
has reduced from 3.5% to 2%. The existing term loan was repaid in full out of cash in hand and we subsequently drew down 
£10 million against the new revolving credit facility. 
Analysis of borrowings 
Borrowings at 31 December 2011 and 31 December 2010 consisted principally of amounts drawn down against the revolving 
credit facility, and bank loans respectively, both held by the Company’s subsidiary Drax Finance Limited as follows:

Contingent liabilities 
In addition to the amount drawn down against the revolving credit facility, the Group guarantees the obligations of a number 
of banks in respect of the letters of credit issued by those banks to counterparties of the Group. As at 31 December 2011 the 
Group’s contingent liability in respect of letters of credit issued under the revolving credit facility amounted to £126.1 million 
(2010: £134.3 million, under the previous £200 million letter of credit facility). 
19. Financial instruments 
The Group issues or holds financial instruments for two purposes: financial instruments relating to the financing and 
management of risks for the Group’s operations; and financial instruments relating to the financing and risks in the Group’s 
debt portfolio. 
The Group’s financial instruments comprise borrowings, cash and liquid resources, items that arise directly from its operations 
and derivative contracts. The Group enters into short-term and medium-term forward contracts for the sale of electricity 
and the purchase of coal, sustainable biomass and CO2 emissions allowances, as well as financial coal contracts to swap 
floating for fixed, or fixed for floating prices on fixed volumes of coal. The Group also enters into interest rate swap 
agreements and forward foreign currency exchange contracts. 
Fair value 
Cash and cash equivalents, short-term investments, trade and other receivables, and trade and other payables generally have 
short times to maturity. For this reason, their carrying values approximate their fair value. The Group’s borrowings relate 
principally to amounts drawn down against the revolving credit facility (2010: term loans), the carrying amounts of which 
approximate their fair values by virtue of being floating rate instruments. 
The fair values and maturities of the Group’s derivative financial instruments which are marked-to-market and recorded 
in the balance sheet at 31 December 2011 and 31 December 2010 were as follows:

19. Financial instruments (continued) 
Due to the nature of commodity contracts and the way they are managed, the own use exemption has been applied 
to a limited number of them, including the five and a quarter year baseload contract with Centrica which commenced 
on 1 October 2007, and the five year baseload contract with Centrica which commenced on 1 October 2010. 
−�Commodity contracts fair value — The fair value of commodity contracts qualifying as derivative financial instruments, 
not excluded through the own use exemption, is calculated by reference to forward market prices at the balance sheet 
date. As contracts are generally short-term, forward market price curves are available for the duration of the contracts. 
The quoted market price used for financial assets held by the Group is the current bid price; the quoted price for financial 
liabilities is the current ask price. 
−�Interest rate swaps fair value — The fair value of interest rate swap contracts is determined by discounting the future 
cash flows using forward interest rate curves at the balance sheet date. 
−�Forward foreign currency exchange contracts fair value — The fair value of forward foreign currency exchange 
contracts is determined using forward currency exchange market rates at the balance sheet date. 
−�Embedded derivatives fair value — The Group has also reviewed all contracts for the presence of embedded derivatives. 
Where contracts were found to contain embedded derivatives, they were considered to be closely related to the economic 
characteristics and risks of the host contract, and therefore do not require separate valuation from their host contracts. 
All financial instruments that are measured subsequent to initial recognition at fair value, have been grouped into Level 2, 
as defined below, based on the degree to which fair value is observable. 
Categorisation within the fair value measurement hierarchy has been determined on the basis of the lowest level input that 
is significant to the fair value measurement of the relevant asset or liability as follows: 
Level 1 — fair value measurements are those derived from quoted prices (unadjusted) in active markets for identical assets 
or liabilities; 
Level 2 — fair value measurements are those derived from inputs, other than quoted prices included within Level 1, 
that are observable for the asset or liability, either directly (i.e. as prices) or indirectly (i.e. derived from prices); and 
Level 3 — fair value measurements are those derived from valuation techniques that include inputs for the asset or liability 
that are not based on observable market data (unobservable inputs).  
The fair value of commodity contracts and forward foreign currency exchange contracts is determined by comparison 
between forward market prices and the contract price; therefore these contracts are categorised as Level 2. The fair value 
of interest rate swap contracts is determined by discounting future cash flows using forward interest rate curves at 
the balance sheet date. These are also categorised as Level 2 inputs.  
There have been no transfers during the year between Level 1, 2 or 3 category inputs.  
Risk 
The Group’s activities expose it to a variety of financial risks including commodity price risk, interest rate risk, foreign 
 
e Group’s overall risk management programme focuses 
ial markets and seeks to manage potential adverse effects on the Group’s 
financial performance.  
The Group uses derivative financial instruments to hedge certain risk exposures. Risk management is carried out by the 
Risk Management Committees as detailed in Principal risks and uncertainties which identify, evaluate and hedge financial risks 
in close co-operation with the Group’s trading function under policies approved by the Board of directors. 
Commodity price risk 
The Group is exposed to the effect of fluctuations in commodity prices, particularly the price of electricity, the price of coal, 
sustainable biomass and other fuels, and the price of CO2 emissions allowances. Price variations and market cycles have 
historically influenced the financial results of the Group and are expected to continue to do so. 
The Group has a policy of making forward power sales with corresponding purchases of fuel and CO2 emissions allowances 
when profitable to do so. All commitments to sell power under fixed price contracts are designated as cash flow hedges in 
order to reduce the Group’s cash flow exposure resulting from fluctuations in the price of electricity.  
The Group purchases coal, sustainable biomass and other fuels under either fixed or variable priced contracts with different 
maturities from a variety of domestic and international sources. All international physical coal purchase contracts transacted 
at a fixed price and financial coal contracts exchanging floating price coal for fixed price amounts are designated as cash flow 
hedges in order to reduce the Group’s cash flow exposure resulting from fluctuations in the price of coal. All physical biomass 
and domestic coal purchase contracts are currently entered into and held for the purpose of the Group’s own purchase, sale
or usage requirements and are therefore designated as own use.

The Group purchases CO2 emissions allowances under fixed price contracts with different maturity dates from a range 
of domestic and international sources. All commitments to purchase CO2 emissions allowances under fixed price contracts 
are designated as cash flow hedges in order to reduce the Group’s cash flow exposure resulting from fluctuations in the price 
of CO2 emissions allowances.  
Commodity price sensitivity 
The sensitivity analysis below has been determined based on the exposure to commodity prices for outstanding monetary 
items at the balance sheet date. The analysis is based on the Group’s commodity financial instruments held at each balance 
sheet date.  
If commodity prices had been 5% higher/lower and all other variables were held constant, the Group’s: 
−�profit after tax for the year ended 31 December 2011 would increase/decrease by £61.2 million (2010: decrease/increase 
by £17.3 million). This is mainly attributable to the Group’s exposure to financial coal derivatives; and 
−�other equity reserves would decrease/increase by £25.7 million (2010: decrease/increase by £9.3 million) mainly as a result 
of the changes in the fair value of commitments to sell power and the Group’s exposure to financial coal derivatives. 
Interest rate risk 
Historically the Group has been exposed to interest rate risk principally in relation to its bank debt, and has sought to mitigate 
this risk with interest rate hedges on a proportion of its debt facilities. On refinancing in July 2011 (see note 18), the Group 
repaid its outstanding term loan balance, and drew down £10 million against a new revolving credit facility. The interest rate 
swaps linked to the previous term loans were closed out and no new interest rate swaps have been taken out since. 
Information about the Group’s instruments that are exposed to interest rate risk and their repayment schedules is included 
in note 18. 
Interest rate sensitivity 
The sensitivity analysis below has been determined based on the exposure to interest rates for both derivatives and 
non-derivative instruments at the balance sheet date. For floating rate liabilities, the analysis is prepared assuming the 
amount of liability outstanding at the balance sheet date was outstanding for the whole year.  
If interest rates had been 1% higher/lower and all other variables were held constant, the Group’s profit after tax and net 
assets for the year ended 31 December 2011 would decrease/increase by £0.8 million (2010: increase/decrease by £0.2 million) 
mainly as a result of the changes in interest payable during the period. 
Foreign currency risk 
Foreign currency exchange contracts are entered into to hedge substantially all of the Group’s fixed price international coal 
purchases in US dollars, biomass purchases in Canadian and US dollars and euros, and CO2 emissions allowances purchases 
in euros. Exchange rate exposures are managed within approved policy parameters utilising foreign currency exchange 
contracts. 
Foreign currency sensitivity 
If sterling exchange rates had been 5% stronger/weaker against other currencies, and all other variables were held constant, 
the Group’s: 
−�profit after tax for the year ended 31 December 2011 would decrease/increase by £21.2 million (2010: increase/decrease 
by £6.1 million). This is mainly attributable to the Group’s exposure to foreign currency exchange contracts for the 
purposes of meeting commitments under financial coal contracts; and 
−�other equity reserves would decrease/increase by £4.9 million (2010: decrease/increase by £0.9 million) as a result 
of the changes in the fair value of hedged foreign currency exchange contracts. 
Liquidity risk 
The treasury function is responsible for liquidity, funding and settlement management under policies approved by the Board 
of directors. Liquidity needs are monitored using regular forecasting of operational cash flows and financing commitments. 
The Group maintains a mixture of cash and cash equivalents, and committed facilities in order to ensure sufficient funding 
for business requirements.

Counterparty risk 
As the Group relies on third party suppliers for the delivery of coal, sustainable biomass and other goods and services, it is 
exposed to the risk of non-performance by these third party suppliers. The Group purchases a significant portion of its coal 
requirement under contracts with a number of UK suppliers. There is a risk that if a large supplier falls into financial difficulty 
and/or fails to deliver against the contracts, there would be additional costs associated with securing coal from other suppliers.  
The Group enters into fixed price and fixed margin contracts for the sale of electricity to a number of counterparties.  
r contractual obligations may cause the Group financial  
The Group is also exposed to the risk of collateral calls against its trading contracts should the Group’s creditworthiness 
deteriorate and its counterparties demand collateral to protect their exposure to the Group. In order to mitigate this risk the
Group has undertaken a number of actions — refining its trading strategy to concentrate on more credit-efficient structures 
and to transact more fixed margin contracts which are less exposed to commodity price movements; and increasing the 
volume of business traded through its supply company, Haven Power, which is less exposed to collateral calls. In addition, 
the Group entered into a trading agreement with Barclays Bank PLC on 5 May 2010, as amended on 22 July 2011, which 
enables it to enter into trading contracts without the requirement to post collateral up to a fixed amount of £135 million, 
irrespective of the Group’s underlying credit rating. 
Credit risk 
The Group’s exposure to credit risk is limited to the carrying amount of financial assets recognised at the balance sheet date,

Trade and other receivables are stated gross of the provision for doubtful debts of £3.0 million (2010: £2.6 million). Credit 
exposure is controlled by counterparty limits that are reviewed and approved by the trading and risk management committee. 
Counterparties without an investment grade rating are normally required to provide credit support in the form of a parent 
company guarantee, letter of credit, deed of charge, or cash collateral. Where deemed appropriate the Group has purchased 
credit default swaps. 
The investment of surplus cash is undertaken to maximise the return within Board approved policies. These policies manage 
credit risk exposure by setting out minimum rating requirements, maximum investment with any one counterparty and the 
maturity profile. 
Capital management 
The Group manages its capital to ensure it is able to continue as a going concern, and maintain its credit rating while 
maximising the return to stakeholders through the optimisation of the debt and equity balance. The capital structure of the 
Group consists of shareholders’ equity excluding the hedge reserve, together with net debt or, when the Group has net cash, 
shareholders’ equity excluding the hedge reserve, less net cash. Net debt/cash comprises borrowings disclosed in note 18, 
cash and cash equivalents in note 16 and short-term investments in note 15. Equity attributable to the shareholders of the 
Company comprises issued capital, capital reserves, retained profits/accumulated losses, excluding the hedge reserve (see 
Consolidated statement of changes in equity). Maintaining an optimal supporting capital structure is one of the Group’s key 
priorities, and as such, our performance is detailed within the Business review. The capital structure of the Group is as follows:

The provision for reinstatement represents the estimated decommissioning, demolition and site remediation costs at the  
on a discounted basis. The amount provided represents the 
present value of the expected costs. The initial provision and subsequent estimation increases are capitalised within property, 
plant and equipment and are being depreciated over the useful lives of the related assets. The unwinding of the discount is 
included in finance costs (note 6). 
The provision is estimated using the assumption that the reinstatement will take place between 2039 and 2045, and has been 
estimated using existing technology at current prices. The discount rate applied is a risk free rate, reflecting the fact that the 
estimated future cash flows have built in the risks specific to the liability.  
21. Deferred tax 
The movements in deferred tax assets and liabilities during each year are shown below. Deferred tax assets and liabilities 
are offset where there is a legally enforceable right of offset and there is an intention to settle the balances net.

Deferred tax assets are recognised to the extent that the realisation of the related tax benefit through future associated 
taxable profits is probable (note 3 (B)).  
As described in note 7, we reached agreement with HMRC during 2011 on the resolution of the Eurobond tax position. 
This has resulted in the recognition of a deferred tax asset in respect of the non trading losses incurred on the unwinding 
of the Eurobond debt structure. 
The Group did not recognise deferred tax assets with an estimated value of £3.0 million at 31 December 2011

No shareholders have waived their rights to dividends. 
Issued under employee share schemes 
On 1 April 2011, a total of 2,456 shares were issued in satisfaction of shares vesting in accordance with the rules of the Group’s 
Bonus Matching Plan to an individual whose employment with the Group had terminated due to retirement (1 September 2010: 
6,098 shares, issued to six individuals). Additionally, on 28 September 2011, a total of 274 options under the Group’s Savings-
Related Share Option Plan were exercised early, resulting in an issue of the same number of shares to one individual whose 
employment with the Group had terminated due to redundancy.

Share Incentive Plan (“SIP”) 
Between 2007 and 2009, qualifying employees could buy up to £1,500 worth of Partnership shares in any one tax year. 
Matching shares were awarded to employees to match any Partnership shares they bought, in a ratio of one-to-one, with 
the cost of Matching shares borne by the Group. There were no awards under the SIP Partnership and Matching share plan 
in 2010, or 2011.

23. Share-based payments (continued) 
Executive Share Incentive Plan (“ESIP”) 
Between 2006 and 2008 the Group operated the ESIP. Under the ESIP, annual awards of performance shares were made 
at £nil consideration to executive directors and other senior staff up to a normal maximum of 100% of salary. Shares vested 
according to whether the Group’s Total Shareholder Return (“TSR”) matched or outperformed an index (determined in 
accordance with the scheme rules) over three years. The fair value of the 2008, 2007 and 2006 ESIP awards, of £1.2 million, 
£0.9 million and £1.9 million respectively have been charged to the income statement on a straight-line basis over the 
corresponding three year vesting periods.  
Bonus Matching Plan (“BMP”) 
The BMP was introduced in 2009 to replace the ESIP. Under the BMP, annual awards of performance and service-related 
shares are made at £nil consideration to executive directors and other senior staff up to a normal maximum of 150% of their 
annual bonus. A proportion of the shares vesting is conditional upon whether the Group’s TSR matches or outperforms an 
index (determined in accordance with the scheme rules) over three years. From 2011, a proportion of the shares vesting will be 
conditional upon performance against the internal Balanced Corporate Scorecard. The fair value of the 2011, 2010 and 2009 
BMP awards of £5.5 million, £3.0 million and £2.8 million respectively are being charged to the income statement on a 
straight-line basis over the corresponding three year vesting periods.

Savings-Related Share Option Plan (“SAYE Plan”) 
In April 2011 and April 2010, participation in the SAYE Plan was offered to all qualifying employees. Options were granted for 
employees to acquire shares at a price of 321 pence (2010: 310.5 pence), representing a discount of 20% to the prevailing 
market price determined in accordance with the scheme rules. The options are exercisable at the end of three or five year 
savings contracts. The fair value of the 2011 and 2010 options granted in connection with the SAYE Plan of £0.2 million and 
£0.6 million, respectively, is being charged to the income statement over the life of the relevant contracts. The only previous 
grant under the SAYE Plan, in July 2006 at an exercise price of 636 pence, resulted in a fair value of £0.5 million being 
charged to the income statement over the life of the respective contracts.

Fair value of share-based payment awards 
The fair value of share-based payment awards was determined as follows: 
SIP — based on price paid at award dates; 
ESIP and BMP — Monte-Carlo valuation model, which takes into account the estimated probability of different levels 
of vesting; and 
SAYE — Black-Scholes model which compares exercise price to share price at the date of grant.

The Group’s cash flow hedges relate to commodity contracts (principally commitments to sell power) and forward foreign 
currency exchange contracts. Amounts are recognised in the hedge reserve as the designated contracts are marked-to- 
market at each period end for the effective portion of the hedge, which is generally 100% of the relevant contract. Amounts 
held within the hedge reserve are then released as the related contract matures and the hedged transaction impacts profit 
or loss. For power sales contracts, this is when the underlying power is delivered. Further information in relation to the 
Group’s accounting for financial instruments is included in notes 3 and 19.

30. Retirement benefit obligations 
The Group operates an approved defined benefit scheme on behalf of the Drax Power Group (“DPG”) of the Electricity Supply 
Pension Scheme (“ESPS”). This scheme was closed to new members as from 1 January 2002 unless they qualify through 
being existing members of another part of the ESPS. The Group also operates a defined contribution scheme. 
Defined benefit scheme 
The most recent actuarial valuation of the DPG ESPS was 31 March 2010. This has been updated as at 31 December 2011 
to reflect relevant changes in assumptions. The principal assumptions were as follows: 
As at 31 December

4.1 
4.5
Expected return on plan assets 
5.2 
5.9
The mortality assumptions are based on standard mortality tables which allow for future mortality improvements. 
The assumptions are that a member who retired in 2011 at age 60 will live on average for a further 26 years (2010: 26 years) 
after retirement if they are male, and for a further 28 years (2010: 28 years) after retirement if they are female. 
Similarly life expectancy at age 60 for male and female non-pensioners (currently aged 45) is assumed to be 27 years 
and 29 years respectively (2010: 27 years and 29 years respectively).

The pension plan assets do not include any ordinary shares issued by Drax Group plc or any property occupied by the Group. 
The Group employs a building block approach in determining the long-term rate of return on pension plan assets. Historical 
markets are studied and assets with higher volatility are assumed to generate higher returns consistent with widely accepted 
capital market principles. The overall expected rate of return on assets is then derived by aggregating the expected return for 
each asset class over the actual asset allocation for the scheme. 
The net liability recognised in the balance sheet is particularly sensitive to the discount rate assumption, which is determined 
by reference to market yields at the balance sheet date on high quality corporate bonds, allowing for the duration of the 
scheme’s liabilities. It is estimated that an increase of 0.5% in the discount rate would have the effect of decreasing the net 
liability recognised in the balance sheet by approximately £16 million (2010: £15 million) and a decrease of 0.5% in the 
discount rate would increase the net liability recognised in the balance sheet by £19 million (2010: £17 million).

Company – Independent auditor’s report
To the members of Drax Group plc 
We have audited the parent Company financial statements of Drax Group plc for the year ended 31 December 2011 which 
comprise the parent Company balance sheet and the related notes 1 to 7. The financial reporting framework that has been 
applied in their preparation is applicable law and United Kingdom Accounting Standards (United Kingdom Generally Accepted 
Accounting Practice). 
This report is made solely to the Company’s members, as a body, in accordance with Chapter 3 of Part 16 of the Companies 
Act 2006. Our audit work has been undertaken so that we might state to the Company’s members those matters we are 
required to state to them in an auditor’s report and for no other purpose. To the fullest extent permitted by law, we do not 
accept or assume responsibility to anyone other than the Company and the Company’s members as a body, for our audit 
work, for this report, or for the opinions we have formed. 
Respective responsibilities of directors and auditor 
As explained more fully in the Directors’ responsibilities statement, the directors are responsible for the preparation of the 
parent Company financial statements and for being satisfied that they give a true and fair view. Our responsibility is to audit 
and express an opinion on the parent Company financial statements in accordance with applicable law and International 
Standards on Auditing (UK and Ireland). Those standards require us to comply with the Auditing Practices Board’s Ethical 
Standards for Auditors. 
Scope of the audit of the financial statements 
An audit involves obtaining evidence about the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements sufficient to give 
reasonable assurance that the financial statements are free from material misstatement, whether caused by fraud or error. 
This includes an assessment of: whether the accounting policies are appropriate to the parent Company’s circumstances and 
have been consistently applied and adequately disclosed; the reasonableness of significant accounting estimates made by  
ents. In addition, we read all the financial and non-financial 
information in the annual report to identify material inconsistencies with the audited financial statements. If we become aware 
of any apparent material misstatements or inconsistencies we consider the implications for our Report.  
Opinion on financial statements 
In our opinion the parent Company financial statements: 
−� give a true and fair view of the state of the parent Company’s affairs as at 31 December 2011; 
−� have been properly prepared in accordance with United Kingdom Generally Accepted Accounting Practice; and 
−� have been prepared in accordance with the requirements of the Companies Act 2006. 
Opinion on other matters prescribed by the Companies Act 2006 
In our opinion: 
−� the part of the Directors’ remuneration report to be audited has been properly prepared in accordance with the Companies 
Act 2006; and 
−� the information given in the Directors’ report for the financial year for which the financial statements are prepared is 
consistent with the parent Company financial statements. 
Matters on which we are required to report by exception 
We have nothing to report in respect of the following matters where the Companies Act 2006 requires us to report to you if, 
in our opinion: 
−� adequate accounting records have not been kept by the parent Company, or returns adequate for our audit have not been 
received from branches not visited by us; or 
−� the parent Company financial statements and the part of the Directors’ remuneration report to be audited are not in 
agreement with the accounting records and returns; or 
−� certain disclosures of directors’ remuneration specified by law are not made; or 
−� we have not received all the information and explanations we require for our audit. 
Other matters 
We have reported separately on the Group financial statements of Drax Group plc for the year ended 31 December 2011.

Shareholder information
Share frauds (“Boiler room scams”) 
In recent years, many companies have become aware that their shareholders have received unsolicited phone calls 
or correspondence offering to purchase their shares at apparently inflated prices. It is often the case that the caller, or 
message in the correspondence claims that they represent a majority shareholder who is looking to take over the Company. 
Some Drax Group plc shareholders have received such communications in the latter part of 2011 and the early part of 2012. 
At the time of this report, the Company was not the subject of a take-over attempt, hostile or otherwise, and approaches such 
as those experienced by our shareholders are usually made by unauthorised companies and individuals. The approaches can 
be very persistent and extremely persuasive. Shareholders should be very wary of any unsolicited advice, offers to buy shares 
at a premium or offers of free reports into the Company. 
If you receive any unsolicited investment advice or any offers to purchase your shares: 
−� make sure you get the correct name of the person and organisation; 
−� check that they are properly authorised by the Financial Services Authority (”FSA”) before getting involved. You can check 
at www.fsa.gov.uk/register; 
−� the FSA also maintains on its website a list of unauthorised overseas firms who are targeting, or have targeted, UK 
investors and any approach from such organisations should be reported to the FSA so that this list can be kept up to date 
and any other appropriate action can be considered. If you deal with an unauthorised firm, you would not be eligible 
to receive payment under the Financial Services Compensation Scheme; 
−� do not provide any personal details to callers e.g. bank details, full address; 
−� do not send your share certificates to anyone; and  
−� report the matter to the FSA either by calling 0845 606 1234 (cost of calls may vary) or visiting

Grid charges 
A long-term contract set at a fixed level 
where variable payments are made to

tariff (assuming they sell their electricity 
at the market price). The Feed-in Tariff 
payment would be made in addition to 
the generator’s revenues from selling 
electricity in the market. The FiT CfD

the potential to see generators return 
money to consumers if electricity prices 
are higher than the agreed tariff.
