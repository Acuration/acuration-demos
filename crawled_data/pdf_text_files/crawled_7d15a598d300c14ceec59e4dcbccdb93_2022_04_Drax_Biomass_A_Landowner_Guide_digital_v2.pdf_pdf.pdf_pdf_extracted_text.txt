The Working Forest
Working forests provide a multitude of benefits.  
They filter our water, clean our air, support a 
diversity of plant and wildlife species, and supply 
valuable wood products. To own a forest is both a 
privilege and a challenge. A well-managed forest 
can produce a significant return on investment 
while simultaneously providing recreational 
opportunities, aesthetic beauty, and an unparalleled 
level of personal satisfaction. The challenge forest 
landowners face is how to optimize the values 
they want their forest to provide. When forest 
landowners successfully meet their own goals, 
forests stay forests, and landscape-level  
ecological and economic benefits are achieved. 
This quick reference guide is intended to help forest 
landowners achieve their management goals. It has  
been designed as a tool to help prompt the right 
questions, connect with the right resources, and  
support the planning process.
“A conservationist is one who is humbly aware  
that with each stroke (of the axe) he is writing  
his signature on the face of the land.” 
Aldo Leopold

Everyone has a unique set of goals for their forest.  
Regardless of your specific motivations, or your level of  
forest management experience, a review of currently  
available resources is recommended.
Forestry is a dynamic and evolving field and professional  
natural resource managers are primed to provide you with what  
you need to succeed. A good place to start is with the state 
forestry commission, state wildlife commission, or the Natural 
Resource Conservation Service (NRCS). A list of resources and 
web-links is included in the Contacts and Resources section at 
the end of this guide. 
 
You will quickly find that state forestry and wildlife agencies, 
federal agencies, as well as private resource managers 
(consultants and industry foresters and biologists) form a 
network of professionals that are very willing to help.

Ask the Right Questions
No matter who you start with (consulting forester, industry 
forester, state forestry or wildlife agency representative, NRCS) 
you will want to ask some key questions.
The first step is to make sure your primary management 
goals are clear. For example, are you interested in maximizing 
timber revenue, enhancing wildlife habitat, or providing other 
recreational and aesthetic benefits? Is it a mix of these?  
Defining your priorities and developing a set of questions specific 
to your goals will help assure you get the guidance and support 
you need. The following questions may help you get started: 
1. If you are Harvesting, consider asking for:
•  Information on local timber markets and products your forest is 
expected to yield (i.e. sawtimber, chip-n-saw, pulpwood) – this  
helps assure harvest timing will meet your economic goals
•  General information on harvest planning – Best Management 
Practices for water quality (BMPs), biodiversity, residue 
management, aesthetics 
•  Information on how thinning can enhance sawtimber, forest 
health, and wildlife habitat 
•  A list of certified or registered foresters in your area (see 
Contacts and Resources) – certified and registered forester 
programs verify credentials and require continuing education
•  A list of trained loggers – the Sustainable Forestry Initiative® 
(SFI) and state forestry commissions jointly administer training 
and require continuing education (database available – see 
Contacts and Resources)
6
2. If you are Regenerating, consider asking for:
•  The pros and cons of planting versus natural regeneration
•  Information on site preparation, its costs and benefits
•  Techniques that can be used to enhance forest growth  
(i.e. competition release and fertilization)
•  Available cost-share programs and what they entail
3. If you are Managing for Wildlife, consider asking for:
•  Assistance from a Private Lands Biologist within the  
state wildlife agency 
•  Information on cost share for wildlife enhancements
•  Information on U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service (USFWS) 
programs for protected & at-risk wildlife species (if any  
are known to occur on or near your property) 
7
Forest Planning and 
Certification
Developing a forest management plan is the ideal way to 
maximize the potential of your property. A plan can turn a 
woodlot into a sustainable working forest that meets your 
financial and stewardship goals.
There are many tools and resources available to help you get 
started with a management plan. State forestry and wildlife 
agencies, the Natural Resource Conservation Service (NRCS), and 
the Association of Consulting Foresters are good places to start 
(see the Contacts and Resources section at the end of this guide).  
 
The American Forest Foundation® (AFF) provides a free  
online tool to get you started on drafting your own plan  
(https://mylandplan.org/). AFF also administers the American 
Tree Farm System®, which offers family forest landowners  
an opportunity to “certify” that their property is being  
managed sustainably.
Certification to internationally recognized forest certification 
schemes can open markets and provide incentives to landowners 
who are managing their forest sustainably. In the United States, 
there are three primary certification systems that provide this 
international recognition: the Sustainable Forestry Initiative®, 
the American Tree Farm System®, and the Forest Stewardship 
Council™ (see Contacts and Resources). The American Tree Farm 
System has been developed specifically to serve the needs of 
family forest owners. SFI®, although traditionally geared towards 
larger ownerships (>10,000 ac), is also developing tools for small 
landowners. FSC® serves large ownerships as well as smaller 
landholdings through a group certification program.
8
Wildlife and Biodiversity
Many of our game and non-game species benefit from 
active forest management. Regenerating forests provide 
browse for deer and a mix of grasses and forbs are  
perfect for quail and turkey poults, which require an 
insect-rich foraging area. Thinning also allows sunlight  
to hit the forest floor, which can enhance the herbaceous 
layer within a forest and benefit these same species. 
Southern pine stands naturally self-thin, so harvesting 
can effectively accelerate the maturity of a stand by 
mimicking the open forest structure of an older forest. 
Turkeys especially appreciate open forests, which provide 
foraging as well as roosting opportunities.
Careful harvest planning can further enhance wildlife 
habitat. Streams, seeps, and ephemeral wet areas are key 
habitat features. Protecting the integrity of these areas 
by buffering at final harvest can retain and attract species 
that normally forage and nest in mature trees and enjoy 
cool, moist microclimates. 
 
Buffers or stream side management zones (SMZs) can 
also act as travel corridors. Encouraging your logging 
contractor to leave standing dead trees (snags) will 
provide additional foraging and perching opportunities  
for birds. When they fall, they will offer valuable foraging 
and cover opportunities for amphibians, reptiles, and  
small mammals.

Species of Concern and Unique Natural Communities
It is important to consider that your property may support  
a wildlife species or natural community that is federally protected 
or of global or regional concern. Animals protected under the 
federal Endangered Species Act (ESA) carry regulatory obligations 
that landowners should be aware of. This select group of species 
is protected from “take” which includes habitat modification 
that interferes with the animal’s ability to find food, shelter, 
or reproduce. It is prudent for landowners to be aware of any 
federally listed species that might exist on their property.
 
Most large sawmills, papermills, and pellet facilities like Drax 
Biomass adhere to sustainability standards (i.e. SFI, FSC) that 
require diligence around federally threatened or endangered 
species, as well as species and community types of global concern. 
Therefore, you will likely be notified if a concern exists on your 
property, but it would not hurt to ask! Some federally protected 
species that may be encountered in the south include the red-
cockaded woodpecker, gopher tortoise, black pinesnake, Louisiana 
pinesnake, a suite of aquatics, and the bald eagle (protected under 
the federal Bald and Golden Eagle protection Act).

Southern forestland
80% Private ownership
2/3 of which is  
family owned
With over 80% of southern forestland in private ownership 
(2/3 of which is family owned), private landowners, and the 
forest products industry that sources from them, can make 
a significant contribution to the conservation of our natural 
heritage. Drax Biomass has a commitment to not source  
from sensitive ecosystems like cypress-tupelo forests  
(http://www.draxbiomass.com/setting-standard-responsible-
sourcing/), as well as communities considered of global and 
regional concern by Nature Serve (http://www.natureserve.org/).
12
Biomass, Thinning, and At-Risk Species Management
 
Many of the at-risk species and communities in the 
southern US are dependent on a disturbance regime that 
keeps the forest in an open canopy condition. Much of 
this region was historically influenced by frequent fires. 
Fires that swept across the landscape reduced competing 
hardwoods, thinned out the natural pine stands, favored 
the fire-tolerant longleaf pine, and allowed sunlight to 
reach the forest floor, stimulating a rich herbaceous layer.
Although fire is no longer allowed to burn freely across  
the landscape, forest landowners have the tools they  
need to improve habitat for these imperiled species. 
Regardless of the pine species, thinning a forest stand 
can stimulate the herbaceous layer that is so important 
to many at-risk species. The biomass market provides 
an outlet for low-grade products, which may encourage 
landowners to thin their stands multiple times during  
a sawlog rotation. Thinning paired with targeted 
hardwood control (i.e. herbicides or in-woods chipping) 
and prescribed burning can be used to restore native 
habitats. Species such as the red-cockaded woodpecker, 
gopher tortoise, black pinesnake, and Louisiana pinesnake, 
associates of the relic open pine system, are examples 
of declining species that benefit from this type of 
management.
 
Cost share programs, planning advice, and burn assistance 
is available through a partnership of federal, state, and 
non-profit organizations (see the Contacts and Resources 
section at the end of this document).
13
Best Management Practices 
for Water Quality
Best Management Practices (BMPs) are developed by state 
forestry agencies to meet the federal Clean Water Act (CWA) 
requirements. In most states these are considered voluntary 
best practices, however, CWA compliance is not voluntary.  
The landowner can be held liable if water quality or wetland 
resources are impacted by forest management activities.
BMPs should be considered in a logging plan, with special 
attention to stream crossings and steep or erosive areas. 
Examples of BMPs include use of temporary bridges, application 
of clean rock to stabilize low water crossings, water turn-outs on 
roads, and use of slash to stabilize skid trails.
 
Upon completion of a harvest, care should be taken to “close 
out” the job by identifying and stabilizing any bare soil areas 
that are susceptible to erosion. It is also important to remove 
all temporary stream crossings to ensure water is free to flow. 
Installing appropriate water diversions on roads, stabilizing  
skid trails with slash or waterbars, and seeding critical zones  
(i.e. stream approaches) are common practices. Logging 
contractors are generally well versed in BMP compliance. 
Selecting an SFI trained logger further assures BMP 
implementation. Most large receiving mills (lumber, paper,  
wood pellet) require trained loggers as a part of their 
certification compliance.
14
15
Managing Harvest Residues
Slash (tops, limbs, branches, and needles/leaves) can hinder 
regeneration and become frustrating if allowed to pile up on a 
landing. Unless burned, large slash piles can take a long time to 
decompose, potentially inhibiting regeneration or alternative use 
of the landing area (i.e. as a wildlife food plot).
The leaves and needles are rich in nutrients. Instructing loggers 
to pull this material off the landing and scatter it back in the 
woods as they return to pick up more logs, will help enrich the 
soil and maintain site productivity.
Slash can also be used to protect skid trails. This technique is 
especially useful on highly erodible soils or during wet weather 
events. Slashing skid trails reduces the need to install waterbars, 
which, if not properly installed, can sometimes exacerbate an 
erosion problem.
 
If the slash is fairly free of debris it may be processed by an 
in-woods chipper/grinder and used directly in the pellet or 
paper production process. Chips are also used as mill boiler 
fuel. Harvests utilizing a chipper not only appear “cleaner”, 
they also reduce the need for mechanical site preparation prior 
to planting. Operational in-woods chipping/grinding leaves 
considerable organic material on the forest floor and can be 
done in a way that does not deplete site nutrients or negatively 
impact wildlife habitat. Some states have biomass harvesting 
guidelines to help harvest planners assess the risk of reclaiming 
harvest residues.
16
Pine Reforestation and 
Stand Management
Reforestation offers an opportunity to increase the productivity 
of your forest. Recent advances in seedling genetics, 
regeneration techniques, and intermediate silviculture 
treatments can result in significant volume gains. These 
silvicultural treatments do come at a cost, but the investment 
can pay off. To better understand the recent advances  
in pine silviculture and the investment implications, see  
The Development of Pine Plantation Silviculture in the South 
and What is Ahead for Intensive Pine Plantation Silviculture  
in the South, full reference included in the Contacts and 
Resources section at the end of this guide.
Questions to Consider 
1. Will you replant the site or naturally regenerate?
• Replanting assures better genetics and density control.
•  Natural regeneration is lower cost but requires attention to 
seed trees, can result in unpredictable stand densities, and 
lengthens the rotation.
 
2. Will you need site preparation? (if you plant)
• If the harvest residue level is high consider in-woods chipping.
•  Consider mechanically “bedding” poorly drained pine sites. 
Raised planting beds can increase pine growth and ameliorate 
logging impact. Caution: poorly drained hardwood sites are 
likely not candidates for bedding and planting. Ask state 
forestry agency about CWA implications. 
•  If the site has a strong component of waxy leaved shrubs /
hardwoods, targeted herbicide application may increase pine 
survival. Woody control also promotes the herbaceous layer 
and provides wildlife benefits.
17
3.  Are you interested in learning about advanced  
silviculture techniques? 
•  Fertilization and release require additional investments 
but have proven to be very effective at increasing stand 
productivity and economic return.
Consider Invasive Species – Site preparation is a good time 
to control existing invasive plants/trees (i.e. kudzu, Chinese 
tallowtree, Chinese privet). **Consult the state forestry 
commission for more information on invasive species.

Forest Biomass and 
Sustainability
Forest biomass is receiving international interest as a renewable 
energy source that can help reduce carbon in the atmosphere. 
A greenhouse gas savings of over 80% can result from burning 
sustainable biomass in place of coal. This is because biomass is 
sourced from forests which are actively capturing and storing 
atmospheric carbon, offsetting the emissions of biogenic carbon 
released during combustion.  
In addition to greenhouse gas savings, the market for woody 
biomass supports investment in forest management, thereby 
increasing the productivity and overall carbon storage capacity 
of the land. The market for low-grade woody material provides 
a financial incentive to actively thin stands, making them more 
productive and shortening the length of time it takes to produce 
quality sawlogs. Harvest of these higher valued sawtimber trees 
then provides the landowner with financial resources to improve 
their forest. The promise of a better return on investment in 
the next rotation encourages landowners to plant improved 
seedlings, ensure good establishment, and keep forests as 
forests rather than converting them to other uses.  
The biomass market also supports regional biodiversity and 
forest health. Many of our southern species are adapted to a 
historic disturbance regime that included frequent, low-intensity 
fires, which kept the forest in an open-canopy condition. 
Without fire, many pine forests are overstocked and have dense 
woody understories. These stands provide less value for wildlife 
and are more vulnerable to disease, insect infestation, and 
destructive wildfire. 
19
The biomass industry, which can utilize small diameter and low-
value trees, encourages thinning and makes selective removal 
of understory woody competitors (in-woods chipping/grinding) 
financially feasible. The Association of Fish & Wildlife Agencies 
has recognized that bioenergy sourcing may even help restore 
habitat for priority species (see Contacts and Resources).
