(4) The powers conferred by paragraph (2) must not be exercised without the consent of the 
street authority. 
(5) If a street authority which receives an application for consent under paragraph (4) fails to 
notify the undertaker of its decision before the end of the period of eight weeks beginning with the 
date on which the application was made (or such longer period as may be agreed with the 
undertaker in writing), that street authority is deemed to have granted consent. 
(6) Paragraphs (3), (4) and (5) do not apply where the undertaker is the street authority for a 
street in which the works are being carried out. 
Street works 
9.—(1) The undertaker may, for the purposes of the authorised development, enter on so much 
of any of the streets specified in Schedule 4 (streets subject to street works) as is within the Order 
limits and may— 
(a) break up or open the street, or any sewer, drain or tunnel under it; 
(b) drill, tunnel or bore under the street; 
(c) place and keep apparatus in the street; 
(d) maintain apparatus in the street or change its position; and 
(e) execute any works required for or incidental to any works referred to in sub-paragraphs 
(a), (b), (c) and (d). 
(2) The authority given by paragraph (1) is a statutory right for the purposes of sections 48(3) 
(streets, street works and undertakers) and 51(1) (prohibition of unauthorised street works) of the 
1991 Act. 
(3) Where the undertaker is not the street authority, the provisions of sections 54 to 106 of the 
1991 Act apply to any street works carried out under paragraph (1). 
Construction and maintenance of new or altered means of access 
10.—(1) Those parts of each means of access specified in Part 1 of Schedule 5 (Access) to be 
constructed under this Order must be completed to the reasonable satisfaction of the highway 
authority and must be maintained by and at the expense of the undertaker for a period of 12 
months from completion and from the expiry of that period by and at the expense of the highway 
authority. 
(2) Those parts of each means of access specified in Part 2 of Schedule 5 (Access) to be 
constructed under this Order and which are not intended to be a public highway must be 
completed to the reasonable satisfaction of the street authority and must be maintained by and at 
the expense of the undertaker for a period of 12 months from completion and from the expiry of 
that period by and at the expense of the street authority. 
(3) Those restoration works carried out pursuant to article 8(3) (power to alter layout, etc., of 
streets) identified in Part 3 of Schedule 5 (Access) which are not intended to be a public highway 
must be completed to the reasonable satisfaction of the street authority and must be maintained by 
and at the expense of the street authority. 
(4) In any action against the undertaker in respect of loss or damage resulting from any failure 
by it to maintain a street under this article, it is a defence (without prejudice to any other defence 
or the application of the law relating to contributory negligence) to prove that the undertaker had 
taken such care as in all the circumstances was reasonably required to secure that the part of the 
street to which the action relates was not dangerous to traffic. 
(5) For the purposes of a defence under paragraph (4), a court is, in particular, to have regard to 
the following matters— 
(a) the character of the street including the traffic which was reasonably to be expected to use 
it; 
 
14 
(b) the standard of maintenance appropriate for a street of that character and used by such 
traffic; 
(c) the state of repair in which a reasonable person would have expected to find the street; 
(d) whether the undertaker knew, or could reasonably have been expected to know, that the 
condition of the part of the street to which the action relates was likely to cause danger to 
users of the street; and 
(e) where the undertaker could not reasonably have been expected to repair that part of the 
street before the cause of action arose, what warning notices of its condition had been 
displayed. 
but for the purposes of such a defence it is not relevant that the undertaker had arranged for a 
competent person to carry out or supervise the maintenance of that part of the street to which the 
action relates unless it is also proved that the undertaker had given that person proper instructions 
with regard to the maintenance of the street and that those instructions had been carried out. 
Temporary prohibition or restriction of use of streets 
11.—(1) The undertaker, during and for the purposes of carrying out the authorised 
development, may temporarily alter, divert, prohibit the use of or restrict the use of any street and 
may for any reasonable time— 
(a) divert the traffic from the street; and 
(b) subject to paragraph (3), prevent all persons from passing along the street. 
(2) Without prejudice to the scope of paragraph (1), the undertaker may use any street where the 
use has been prohibited or restricted under the powers conferred by this article and within the 
Order limits as a temporary working site. 
(3) The undertaker must provide reasonable access for non-motorised users (including 
pedestrians) going to or from premises abutting a street affected by the temporary alteration, 
diversion, prohibition or restriction of a street under this article if there would otherwise be no 
such access. 
(4) Without prejudice to the generality of paragraph (1), the undertaker may temporarily alter, 
divert, prohibit the use of or restrict the use of the streets specified in columns (1) and (2) of 
Schedule 6 (temporary prohibition or restriction of the use of streets) to the extent specified in 
column (3) of that Schedule. 
(5) The undertaker must not temporarily alter, divert, prohibit the use of or restrict the use of— 
(a) any street specified in paragraph (4) without first consulting the street authority; and 
(b) any other street without the consent of the street authority which may attach reasonable 
conditions to any consent. 
(6) If a street authority fails to notify the undertaker of its decision within 8 weeks of receiving 
an application for consent under paragraph (5)(b) (or such longer period as may be agreed with the 
undertaker in writing) that street authority is deemed to have granted consent. 
Stopping up of Streets 
12.—(1) Subject to the provisions of this article, the undertaker may, in connection with the 
carrying out of the authorised development, stop up each of the streets specified in columns (1) 
and (2) of Schedule 7 (streets to be stopped up for which a substitute is to be provided) to the 
extent specified, by reference to the letters and numbers shown on the rights of way, streets and 
access plan, in column (3) of those Parts of that Schedule. 
(2) No street specified in columns (1) and (2) of Schedule 7 (being a street to be stopped up for 
which a substitute is to be provided) shall be wholly or partly stopped up under this article unless- 
(a) the new street to be substituted for it, which is specified in column (4) of that Part of that 
Schedule, has been completed to the reasonable satisfaction of the street authority and is 
open for use; or 
 
15 
(b) a temporary alternative route for the passage of such traffic as could have used the street 
to be stopped up is first provided and subsequently maintained by the undertaker, to the 
reasonable satisfaction of the street authority, between the commencement and 
termination points for the stopping up of the street until the completion and opening of 
the new street in accordance with sub-paragraph (a). 
(3) Where a street has been stopped up under this article— 
(a) all rights of way over or along the street so stopped up shall be extinguished; and 
(b) the undertaker may appropriate and use for the purposes of the authorised development so 
much of the site of the street as is bounded on both sides by land owned by the 
undertaker. 
(4) Any person who suffers loss by the suspension or extinguishment of any private right of way 
under this article shall be entitled to compensation to be determined, in case of dispute, under Part 
1 of the 1961 Act. 
(5) This article is subject to article 31 (apparatus and rights of statutory undertakers in streets). 
Access to works 
13.—(1) The undertaker may, for the purposes of the authorised development—

Schedule 3 (streets subject to permanent and temporary alteration of layout); and 
(c) with the approval of the relevant planning authority after consultation with the highway 
authority, form and lay out such other means of access or improve the existing means of 
access, at such locations within the Order limits as the undertaker reasonably requires for 
the purposes of the authorised development.

conferred by this Order; 
(c) the maintenance of the structure of any bridge or tunnel carrying a street; 
(d) any alteration, diversion, prohibition or restriction in the use of a street authorised by this 
Order; or 
(e) the carrying out in the street of any of the works referred to in article 10(1) (construction 
and maintenance of new or altered means of access). 
(2) Such an agreement may, without prejudice to the generality of paragraph (1)— 
(a) make provision for the street authority to carry out any function under this Order which 
relates to the street in question; 
(b) include an agreement between the undertaker and street authority specifying a reasonable 
time for the completion of the works; and 
(c) contain such terms as to payment and otherwise as the parties consider appropriate.

whose area the road concerned is situated, the undertaker may, in so far as may be expedient or 
necessary for the purposes of or in connection with the construction of the authorised

operational— 
(a) permit, prohibit or restrict the stopping, parking, waiting, loading or unloading of vehicles 
on any road; and 
(b) make provision as to the direction or priority of vehicular traffic on any road, 
either at all times or at times, on days or during such periods as may be specified by the

authority in whose area the road is situated; and 
(b) advertised its intention in such manner as the traffic authority may specify in writing 
within 7 days of its receipt of notice of the undertaker’s intention in the case of sub-
paragraph (a). 
(3) Any prohibition, restriction or other provision made by the undertaker under article 11 or 
paragraph (1) of this article has effect as if duly made by, as the case may be— 
(a) the traffic authority in whose area the road is situated as a traffic regulation order under 
the 1984 Act; or 
(b) the local authority in whose area the road is situated as an order under section 32 of the 
1984 Act, 
and the instrument by which it is effected is deemed to be a traffic order for the purposes of 
Schedule 7 to the Traffic Management Act 2004 (road traffic contraventions subject to civil 
enforcement)(a). 
(4) In this article— 
(a) subject to sub-paragraph (b) expressions used in this article and in the 1984 Act have the

to undertake the removal of the remains. 
(6) Where a person has given notice under paragraph (5), and the remains in question can be 
identified, that person may cause such remains to be—

(b) removed to, and cremated in, any crematorium,  
and that person must, as soon as reasonably practicable after such re-interment or cremation, 
provide to the undertaker a certificate for the purpose of enabling compliance with paragraph (11). 
(7) If the undertaker is not satisfied that any person giving notice under paragraph (5) is the 
personal representative or relative as that person claims to be, or that the remains in question can 
be identified, the question is to be determined on the application of either party in a summary 
manner by the county court, and the court may make an order specifying who is to remove the

suitable for the purpose; and, so far as possible, remains from individual graves must be re-
interred in individual containers which must be identifiable by a record prepared with reference to 
the original position of burial of the remains that they contain. 
(10) If the undertaker is satisfied that any person giving notice under paragraph (5) is the 
personal representative or relative as that person claims to be and that the remains in question can 
be identified, but that person does not remove the remains, the undertaker must comply with any 
reasonable request that person may make in relation to the removal and re-interment or cremation 
of the remains. 
(11) On the re-interment or cremation of any remains under this article—

Article 22 
MODIFICATION OF COMPENSATION AND COMPULSORY 
PURCHASE ENACTMENTS FOR CREATION OF NEW RIGHTS 
AND IMPOSITION OF NEW RESTRICTIONS 
Compensation enactments 
1. The enactments for the time being in force with respect to compensation for the compulsory 
purchase of land apply, with the necessary modifications as respects compensation, in the case of 
a compulsory acquisition under this Order of a right by the creation of a new right as they apply 
as respects compensation on the compulsory purchase of land and interests in land. 
2.—(1) Without prejudice to the generality of paragraph 1, the Land Compensation Act 
1973(a) has effect subject to the modifications set out in sub-paragraph (2). 
(2) In section 44(1) (compensation for injurious affection), as it applies to compensation for 
injurious affection under section 7 of the 1965 Act as substituted by paragraph 4(2) — 
(a) for the words “land is acquired or taken” there are substituted the words “a right or 
restrictive covenant over land is purchased from or imposed on”; and 
(b) for the words “acquired or taken from him” there are substituted the words “over which 
the right is exercisable or the restrictive covenant enforceable”. 
3.—(1) Without limitation on the scope of paragraph 1, the Land Compensation Act 1961 has 
effect subject to the modification set out in sub-paragraph (2) . 
(2) For section 5A (5A) (relevant valuation date) of the 1961 Act, for (a) and (b) substitute— 
“(a) the acquiring authority enters on land for the purpose of exercising a right in 
pursuance of a notice of entry under section 11(1) of the 1965 Act; and 
(b) the acquiring authority is subsequently required by a determination under 
paragraph 13 of Schedule 2A to the 1965 Act (as substituted by paragraph 9 of 
Schedule 8 to the Millbrook Gas Fired Generating Station Order 201[X] to acquire 
an interest in the land, and” 
Application of the 1965 Act 
4.—(1) For the purposes of Article 25 only the 1965 Act is subject to the modifications in sub-
paragraph 3(2). 
(2) For section 7 of the 1965 Act (measure of compensation) there is substituted the following 
section— 
“7. In assessing the compensation to be paid by the acquiring authority under this Act, 
regard must be had not only to the extent (if any) to which the value of the land over which 
the right is to be acquired or the restrictive covenant is to be imposed is depreciated by the 
acquisition of the right or the imposition of the covenant but also to the damage (if any) to 
be sustained by the owner of the land by reason of its severance from other land of the 
owner, or injuriously affecting that other land by the exercise of the powers conferred by 
this or the special Act.”. 
5. The following provisions of the 1965 Act (which state the effect of a deed poll executed in 
various circumstances where there is no conveyance by persons with interests in the land), that is 
to say— 
(a) section 9(4) (failure by owners to convey); 
(b) paragraph 10(3) of Schedule 1 (owners under incapacity); 
                                                                                                                                            
(a) 1973 c.26. 
 
65 
(c) paragraph 2(3) of Schedule 2 (absent and untraced owners); and 
(d) paragraphs 2(3) and 7(2) of Schedule 4 (common land), 
are so modified as to secure that, as against persons with interests in the land which are expressed 
to be overridden by the deed, the right which is to be compulsorily acquired or the restrictive 
covenant which is to be imposed is vested absolutely in the acquiring authority. 
6. Section 11 of the 1965 Act (powers of entry) is modified as to secure that, as from the date 
on which the acquiring authority has served notice to treat in respect of any right it has power, 
exercisable in equivalent circumstances and subject to equivalent conditions, to enter for the 
purpose of exercising that right or enforcing that restrictive covenant (which is deemed for this 
purpose to have been created on that date of service of the notice); and sections 12 (penalty for 
unauthorised entry) and 13 (entry on warrant in the event of obstruction) of the 1965 Act are 
modified correspondingly. 
7. Section 20 of the 1965 Act (protection for interests of tenants at will, etc.) applies with the 
modifications necessary to secure that persons with such interests in land as are mentioned in that 
section are compensated in a manner corresponding to that in which they would be compensated 
on a compulsory acquisition under this Order of that land, but taking into account only the extent 
(if any) of such interference with such an interest as is actually caused, or likely to be caused, by 
the exercise of the right or the enforcement of the restrictive covenant in question. 
8. Section 22 of the 1965 Act (protection of acquiring authority’s possession where by 
inadvertence an estate, right or interest has not been got in) is modified as to enable the acquiring 
authority, in circumstances corresponding to those referred to in that section, to continue to be 
entitled to exercise the right acquired, subject to compliance with that section as respects 
compensation. 
9. For schedule 2A to the 1965 Act substitute— 
“SCHEDULE 2A 
COUNTER-NOTICE REQUIRING PURCHASE OF LAND 
Introduction 
1. This Schedule applies where an acquiring authority serve a notice to treat in respect of 
a right over, or restrictive covenant affecting, the whole or part of a house, building or 
factory and have not executed a general vesting declaration under section 4 of the 1981 Act 
as applied by article 19 (application of the Compulsory Purchase (Vesting Declarations) 
Act 1981) in respect of the land to which the notice to treat relates. 
2. In this Schedule, “house” includes any park or garden belonging to a house. 
Counter-notice requiring purchase of land  
3. A person who is able to sell the house, building or factory (“the owner”) may serve a 
counter-notice requiring the authority to purchase the owner’s interest in the house, 
building or factory. 
4. A counter-notice under paragraph 3 must be served within the period of 28 days 
beginning with the day on which the notice to treat was served. 
Response to counter-notice 
5. On receiving a counter-notice, the acquiring authority must decide whether to— 
(a) withdraw the notice to treat, 
(b) accept the counter-notice, or 
(c) refer the counter-notice to the Upper Tribunal. 
 
66 
6. The authority must serve notice of their decision on the owner within the period of 3 
months beginning with the day on which the counter-notice is served (“the decision 
period”). 
7. If the authority decide to refer the counter-notice to the Upper Tribunal they must do so 
within the decision period. 
8. If the authority do not serve notice of a decision within the decision period they are to 
be treated as if they had served notice of a decision to withdraw the notice to treat at the end 
of that period. 
9. If the authority serve notice of a decision to accept the counter-notice, the compulsory 
purchase order and the notice to treat are to have effect as if they included the owner’s 
interest in the house, building or factory. 
Determination by Upper Tribunal 
10. On a referral under paragraph 7, the Upper Tribunal must determine whether the 
acquisition of the right or the imposition of the restrictive covenant would— 
(a) in the case of a house, building or factory, cause material detriment to the house, 
building or factory, or 
(b) in the case of a park or garden, seriously affect the amenity or convenience of the 
house to which the park or garden belongs. 
11. In making its determination, the Upper Tribunal must take into account— 
(a) the effect of the acquisition of the right or the imposition of the covenant, 
(b) the use to be made of the right or covenant proposed to be acquired or imposed, 
and 
(c) if the right or covenant is proposed to be acquired or imposed for works or other 
purposes extending to other land, the effect of the whole of the works and the use 
of the other land. 
12. If the Upper Tribunal determines that the acquisition of the right or the imposition of 
the covenant would have either of the consequences described in paragraph 10, it must 
determine how much of the house, building or factory the authority ought to be required to 
take. 
13. If the Upper Tribunal determines that the authority ought to be required to take some 
or all of the house, building or factory, the compulsory purchase order and the notice to 
treat are to have effect as if they included the owner’s interest in that land. 
14.—(1) If the Upper Tribunal determines that the authority ought to be required to take 
some or all of the house, building or factory, the authority may at any time within the 
period of 6 weeks beginning with the day on which the Upper Tribunal makes its 
determination withdraw the notice to treat in relation to that land. 
(2) If the acquiring authority withdraws the notice to treat under this paragraph they must 
pay the person on whom the notice was served compensation for any loss or expense 
caused by the giving and withdrawal of the notice. 
(3) Any dispute as to the compensation is to be determined by the Upper Tribunal.”

“utility undertaker” means— 
(e) any licence holder within the meaning of Part 1 of the Electricity Act 1989; 
(f) a gas transporter within the meaning of Part 1 of the Gas Act 1986(a); 
(g) a water undertaker within the meaning of the Water Industry Act 1991; and 
(h) a sewerage undertaker within the meaning of Part 1 of the Water Industry Act 1991, 
for the area of the authorised development, and in relation to any apparatus, means the utility 
undertaker to whom it belongs or by whom it is maintained. 
3. This part of this Schedule does not apply to apparatus in respect of which the relations 
between the undertaker and the utility undertaker are regulated by the provisions of Part 3 of the 
1991 Act. 
4. Regardless of the temporary prohibition or restriction of use of streets under the powers 
conferred by article 11 (temporary prohibition or restriction of use of streets), a utility undertaker 
is at liberty at all times to take all necessary access across any such street and to execute and do 
all such works and things in, upon or under any such street as may be reasonably necessary or 
desirable to enable it to maintain any apparatus which at the time of the prohibition or restriction 
was in that street. 
5. Regardless of any provision in this Order or anything shown on the land plans, the 
undertaker must not acquire any apparatus otherwise than by agreement. 
6.—(1) If, in the exercise of the powers conferred by this Order, the undertaker acquires any 
interest in any land in which any apparatus is placed or over which access to any apparatus is 
enjoyed or requires that the utility undertaker’s apparatus is relocated or diverted, that apparatus 
must not be removed under this part of this Schedule, and any right of a utility undertaker to 
maintain that apparatus in that land and to gain access to it must not be extinguished, until 
alternative apparatus has been constructed and is in operation, and access to it has been provided, 
to the reasonable satisfaction of the utility undertaker in question in accordance with sub-
paragraphs (2) to (7). 
(2) If, for the purpose of executing any works in, on or under any land purchased, held, 
appropriated or used under this Order, the undertaker requires the removal of any apparatus placed 
in that land, the undertaker must give to the utility undertaker in question written notice of that 
requirement, together with a plan and section of the work proposed, and of the proposed position 
of the alternative apparatus to be provided or constructed and in that case (or if in consequence of 
the exercise of any of the powers conferred by this Order a utility undertaker reasonably needs to 
remove any of its apparatus) the undertaker must, subject to sub-paragraph (3), afford to the utility 
undertaker the necessary facilities and rights for the construction of alternative apparatus in other 
land of the undertaker and subsequently for the maintenance of that apparatus. 
(3) If alternative apparatus or any part of such apparatus is to be constructed elsewhere than in 
other land of the undertaker, or the undertaker is unable to afford such facilities and rights as are 
mentioned in sub-paragraph (2), in the land in which the alternative apparatus or part of such 
apparatus is to be constructed, the utility undertaker in question must, on receipt of a written 
notice to that effect from the undertaker, as soon as reasonably possible use reasonable endeavours 
to obtain the necessary facilities and rights in the land in which the alternative apparatus is to be 
constructed. 
(4) Any alternative apparatus to be constructed in land of the undertaker under this part of this 
Schedule must be constructed in such manner and in such line or situation as may be agreed 
between the utility undertaker in question and the undertaker or in default of agreement settled by 
arbitration in accordance with article 43 (arbitration). 
(5) The utility undertaker in question must, after the alternative apparatus to be provided or 
constructed has been agreed or settled by arbitration in accordance with article 43 (arbitration), 
                                                                                                                                            
(a) 1986 c.44. A new section 7 was substituted by section 5 of the Gas Act 1995 (c.45), and was further amended by section 76 
of the Utilities Act 2000 (c.27), Section 48 was amended by paragraph 2(1) of Schedule 6 to the Gas Act 1995 (c.45). 
 
74 
and after the grant to the utility undertaker of any such facilities and rights as are referred to in 
sub-paragraph (2) or (3), proceed without unnecessary delay to construct and bring into operation 
the alternative apparatus and subsequently to remove any apparatus required by the undertaker to 
be removed under the provisions of this part of this Schedule. 
(6) Regardless of anything in sub-paragraph (5), if the undertaker gives notice in writing to the 
utility undertaker in question that it desires itself to execute any work, or part of any work, in 
connection with the construction or removal of apparatus in any land controlled by the undertaker, 
that work, instead of being executed by the utility undertaker, must be executed by the undertaker 
without unnecessary delay under the superintendence, if given, and to the reasonable satisfaction 
of the utility undertaker. 
(7) Nothing in sub-paragraph (6) authorises the undertaker to execute the placing, installation, 
bedding, packing, removal, connection or disconnection of any apparatus, or execute any filling 
around the apparatus (where the apparatus is laid in a trench) within 300 millimetres of the 
apparatus. 
7.—(1) Where, in accordance with the provisions of this part of this Schedule, the undertaker 
affords to a utility undertaker facilities and rights for the construction and maintenance in land of 
the undertaker of alternative apparatus in substitution for apparatus to be removed, those 
facilities and rights must be granted upon such terms and conditions as may be agreed between 
the undertaker and the utility undertaker in question or in default of agreement settled by 
arbitration in accordance with article 43 (arbitration). 
(2) If the facilities and rights to be afforded by the undertaker in respect of any alternative 
apparatus, and the terms and conditions subject to which those facilities and rights are to be 
granted, are in the opinion of the arbitrator less favourable on the whole to the utility undertaker in 
question than the facilities and rights enjoyed by it in respect of the apparatus to be removed and 
the terms and conditions to which those facilities and rights are subject, the arbitrator must make 
such provision for the payment of compensation by the undertaker to that utility undertaker as 
appears to the arbitrator to be reasonable having regard to all the circumstances of the particular 
case. 
8.—(1) Not less than 28 days before starting the execution of any works in, on or under any 
land purchased, held, appropriated or used under this Order that are near to, or will or may affect, 
any apparatus the removal of which has not been required by the undertaker under paragraph (3), 
the undertaker must submit to the utility undertaker in question a plan, section and description of 
the works to be executed. 
(2) Those works must be executed only in accordance with the plan, section and description 
submitted under sub-paragraph (1) and in accordance with such reasonable requirements as may 
be made in accordance with sub-paragraph (3) by the utility undertaker for the alteration or 
otherwise for the protection of the apparatus, or for securing access to it, and the utility undertaker 
is entitled to watch and inspect the execution of those works. 
(3) Any requirements made by a utility undertaker under sub-paragraph (2) must be made within 
a period of 21 days beginning with the date on which a plan, section and description under sub-
paragraph (1) are submitted to it. 
(4) If a utility undertaker in accordance with sub-paragraph (3) and in consequence of the works 
proposed by the undertaker, reasonably requires the removal of any apparatus and gives written 
notice to the undertaker of that requirement, paragraphs 1 to 7 apply as if the removal of the 
apparatus had been required by the undertaker under paragraph 6(2). 
(5) Nothing in this paragraph precludes the undertaker from submitting at any time or from time 
to time, but in no case less than 28 days before commencing the execution of any works, a new 
plan, section and description instead of the plan, section and description previously submitted, and 
having done so the provisions of this paragraph apply to and in respect of the new plan, section 
and description. 
(6) The undertaker is not required to comply with sub-paragraph (1) in a case of emergency but 
in that case it must give to the utility undertaker in question notice as soon as is reasonably 
practicable and a plan, section and description of those works as soon as reasonably practicable 
 
75 
subsequently and must comply with sub-paragraph (2) in so far as is reasonably practicable in the 
circumstances. 
9.—(1) Subject to the following provisions of this paragraph, the undertaker must repay to a 
utility undertaker the reasonable expenses incurred by that utility undertaker in, or in connection 
with, the inspection, removal, alteration or protection of any apparatus or the construction of any 
new apparatus which may be required in consequence of the execution of any such works as are 
referred to in paragraph 6(2). 
(2) There is to be deducted from any sum payable under sub-paragraph (1) the value of any 
apparatus removed under the provisions of this part of this Schedule, that value being calculated 
after removal. 
(3) If in accordance with the provisions of this part of this Schedule— 
(a) apparatus of better type, of greater capacity or of greater dimensions is placed in 
substitution for existing apparatus of worse type, of smaller capacity or of smaller 
dimensions; or 
(b) apparatus (whether existing apparatus or apparatus substituted for existing apparatus) is 
placed at a depth greater than the depth at which the existing apparatus was, 
and the placing of apparatus of that type or capacity or of those dimensions or the placing of 
apparatus at that depth, as the case may be, is not agreed by the undertaker or, in default of 
agreement, is not determined by arbitration in accordance with article 43 (arbitration) to be 
necessary, then, if such placing involves cost in the construction of works under this part of this 
Schedule exceeding that which would have been involved if the apparatus placed had been of the 
existing type, capacity or dimensions, or at the existing depth, as the case may be, the amount 
which apart from this sub-paragraph would be payable to the utility undertaker in question by 
virtue of sub-paragraph (1) is to be reduced by the amount of that excess. 
(4) For the purposes of sub-paragraph (3)— 
(a) an extension of apparatus to a length greater than the length of existing apparatus is not to 
be treated as a placing of apparatus of greater dimensions than those of the existing 
apparatus where such extension is required in consequence of the execution of any such 
works as are referred to in paragraph 6(2); and 
(b) where the provision of a joint in a cable is agreed, or is determined to be necessary, the 
consequential provision of a jointing chamber or of a manhole is to be treated as if it also 
had been agreed or had been so determined. 
(5) An amount which apart from this sub-paragraph would be payable to a utility undertaker in 
respect of works by virtue of sub-paragraph (1) if the works include the placing of apparatus 
provided in substitution for apparatus placed more than 7 years and 6 months earlier so as to 
confer on the utility undertaker any financial benefit by deferment of the time for renewal of the 
apparatus in the ordinary course, is to be reduced by the amount which represents that benefit. 
10.—(1) Subject to sub-paragraphs (2) and (3), if by reason or in consequence of the 
construction of any of the works referred to in paragraph 6(2), any damage is caused to any 
apparatus (other than apparatus the repair of which is not reasonably necessary in view of its 
intended removal for the purposes of those works) or property of a utility undertaker, or there is 
any interruption in any service provided, or in the supply of any goods, by any utility undertaker, 
the undertaker must— 
(a) bear and pay the cost reasonably incurred by that utility undertaker in making good such 
damage or restoring the supply; and 
(b) make reasonable compensation to that utility undertaker for any other expenses, loss, 
damages, penalty or costs incurred by the utility undertaker, 
by reason or in consequence of any such damage or interruption. 
(2) Nothing in sub-paragraph (1) imposes any liability on the undertaker with respect to any 
damage or interruption to the extent that it is attributable to the act, neglect or default of a utility 
undertaker, its officers, servants, contractors or agents. 
 
76 
(3) A utility undertaker must give the undertaker reasonable notice of any such claim or demand 
and no settlement or compromise is to be made without the consent of the undertaker which, if it 
withholds such consent, has the sole conduct of any settlement or compromise or of any 
proceedings necessary to resist the claim or demand. 
11. Nothing in this part of this Schedule affects the provisions of any enactment or agreement 
regulating the relations between the undertaker and a utility undertaking in respect of any 
apparatus laid or erected in land belonging to the undertaker on the date on which this Order is 
made.

restriction), (24) (retained apparatus: protection), (25) (retained apparatus: protection), (26) 
(expenses) and (27) (indemnity) this Schedule does not apply to apparatus in respect of which the 
relations between the undertaker and National Grid are regulated by the provisions of Part 3 of 
the 1991 Act. 
Apparatus of National Grid in streets subject to temporary prohibition or restriction 
20.—(1) Without prejudice to the generality of any other protection afforded to National Grid 
elsewhere in the Order, where any street is stopped up under article 12 (stopping up of streets), if 
National Grid has any apparatus in the street or accessed via that street National Grid will be 
entitled to the same rights in respect of such apparatus as it enjoyed immediately before the 
stopping up and the promoter will grant to National Grid, or will procure the granting to the 
National Grid of, legal easements reasonably satisfactory to the specified undertaker in respect of 
such apparatus and access to it prior to the stopping up of any such street or highway. 
(2) Notwithstanding the temporary prohibition or restriction under the powers of article 11 
(temporary prohibition or restriction of use of streets), National Grid shall be at liberty at all times 
to take all necessary access across any such street and/or to execute and do all such works and 
things in, upon or under any such street as may be reasonably necessary or desirable to enable it to 
maintain any apparatus which at the time of the prohibition or restriction was in that street. 
Acquisition of land 
21.—(1) Regardless of any provision in this Order or anything shown on the land plans or 
contained in the book of reference to the Order the undertaker must not acquire any land interest 
or apparatus or override any easement or other interest of National Grid otherwise than by 
agreement (such agreement not to be unreasonably withheld). 
(2) The undertaker and National Grid agree that where there is any inconsistency or duplication 
between the provisions set out in this Schedule relating to the relocation and/or removal of 
apparatus (including but not limited to the payment of costs and expenses relating to such 
relocation and/or removal of apparatus) and the provisions of any existing easement, rights, 
agreements and licences granted, used, enjoyed or exercised by National Grid as of right or other 
use in relation to the apparatus then the provisions in this Schedule shall prevail. 
(3) Any agreement or consent granted by National Grid under paragraph 24 or any other 
paragraph of this Part of this Schedule, shall not be taken to constitute agreement under sub-
paragraph 21(1). 
Removal of apparatus 
22.—(1) If, in the exercise of the agreement reached in accordance with paragraph (21) or in 
any other authorised manner, the undertaker acquires any interest in any land in which any 
apparatus is placed, that apparatus must not be removed under this part of this Schedule and any 
right of National Grid to maintain that apparatus in that land shall not be extinguished until 
alternative apparatus has been constructed, and is in operation to the reasonable satisfaction of 
National Grid in accordance with sub-paragraphs (2) to (5) inclusive. 
(2) If, for the purpose of executing any works comprised in the authorised development in, on, 
under or over any land purchased, held, appropriated or used under this Order, the undertaker 
requires the removal of any apparatus placed in that land, it must give to National Grid 56 days’ 
advance written notice of that requirement, together with a plan of the work proposed, and of the 
proposed position of the alternative apparatus to be provided or constructed and in that case (or if 
in consequence of the exercise of any of the powers conferred by this Order National Grid 
reasonably needs to remove any of its apparatus) the undertaker shall, subject to sub-paragraph 
(3), afford to National Grid to their satisfaction (taking into account paragraph 23(1) below) the 
necessary facilities and rights for— 
(a) the construction of alternative apparatus in other land of the undertaker; and 
 
81 
(b) subsequently for the maintenance of that apparatus. 
(3) If alternative apparatus or any part of such apparatus is to be constructed elsewhere than in 
other land of the undertaker, or the undertaker is unable to afford such facilities and rights as are 
mentioned in sub-paragraph (2), in the land in which the alternative apparatus or part of such 
apparatus is to be constructed, National Grid must, on receipt of a written notice to that effect from 
the undertaker, take such steps as are reasonable in the circumstances in an endeavour to obtain 
the necessary facilities and rights in the land in which the alternative apparatus is to be constructed 
save that this obligation shall not extend to the requirement for National Grid to use its 
compulsory purchase powers to this end unless it elects to so do. 
(4) Any alternative apparatus to be constructed in land of the undertaker under this part of this 
Schedule shall be constructed in such manner and in such line or situation as may be agreed 
between National Grid and the undertaker. 
(5) National Grid must, after the alternative apparatus to be provided or constructed has been 
agreed, and subject to the grant to National Grid of any such facilities and rights as are referred to 
in sub-paragraph (2) or (3), proceed without unnecessary delay to construct and bring into 
operation the alternative apparatus and subsequently to remove any apparatus required by the 
undertaker to be removed under the provisions of this part of this Schedule. 
 
82 
Facilities and rights for alternative apparatus 
23.—(1) Where, in accordance with the provisions of this part of this Schedule, the undertaker 
affords to National Grid facilities and rights for the construction and maintenance in land of the 
undertaker of alternative apparatus in substitution for apparatus to be removed, those facilities 
and rights shall be granted upon such terms and conditions as may be agreed between the 
undertaker and National Grid and must be no less favourable on the whole to National Grid than 
the facilities and rights enjoyed by it in respect of the apparatus to be removed unless agreed by 
National Grid. 
(2) If the facilities and rights to be afforded by the undertaker and agreed with National Grid 
under sub-paragraph (1) above in respect of any alternative apparatus, and the terms and 
conditions subject to which those facilities and rights are to be granted, are less favourable on the 
whole to National Grid than the facilities and rights enjoyed by it in respect of the apparatus to be 
removed and the terms and conditions to which those facilities and rights are subject in the matter 
shall be referred to arbitration under paragraph 31 and, the arbitrator shall make such provision for 
the payment of compensation by the undertaker to National Grid as appears to the arbitrator to be 
reasonable having regard to all the circumstances of the particular case. In respect of the 
appointment of an arbitrator under this sub-paragraph (2), article 43 (arbitration) of the Order shall 
apply. 
Retained apparatus: protection of National Grid as Gas Undertaker 
24.—(1) Not less than 56 days before the commencement of any authorised development 
authorised by this Order that involves activities or works specified in National Grid’s 
“Specification for safe working in the vicinity of National Grid, High pressure Gas pipelines and 
associated installation requirements for third parties T/SP/SSW22” that are within the 
proximities described therein to any apparatus the removal of which has not been required by the 
undertaker under paragraph 22(2) or otherwise, the undertaker must submit to National Grid a 
plan. 
(2) In relation to works which will be situated on, over, under or within 15 metres measured in 
any direction of any apparatus to which sub-paragraph (1) applies, or (wherever situated) impose 
any load directly upon any such apparatus or involve embankment works within 15 metres of any 
such apparatus, the plan to be submitted to National Grid under sub-paragraph (1) shall show— 
(a) the exact position of the works; 
(b) the level at which these are proposed to be constructed or renewed; 
(c) the manner of their construction or renewal including details of excavation, positioning of 
plant etc.; 
(d) the position of all apparatus; 
(e) by way of detailed drawings, every alteration proposed to be made to or close to any such 
apparatus; 
(f) intended maintenance regimes; and 
(g) details of any ground monitoring scheme (if required in accordance with National Grid’s 
“Specification for safe working in the vicinity of National Grid, High pressure Gas 
pipelines and associated installation requirements for third parties T/SP/SSW22”.) 
(3) The undertaker must not commence any works to which sub-paragraph (1) and (2) applies

paragraph (5) or (7); 
(b) must not be unreasonably withheld. 
(5) In relation to a work to which sub-paragraphs (1) and (2) applies, National Grid may require 
such modifications to be made to the plans as may be reasonably necessary for the purpose of 
 
83 
securing its system against interference or risk of damage or for the purpose of providing or 
securing proper and convenient means of access to any apparatus. 
(6) Works executed under sub-paragraphs (1) or (2) shall be executed only in accordance with 
the plan, submitted under sub-paragraph (1) and (2) or as relevant sub paragraph (4), as amended 
from time to time by agreement between the undertaker and National Grid and in accordance with 
such reasonable requirements as may be made in accordance with sub-paragraphs (5), (7) and/or 
(8) by National Grid for the alteration or otherwise for the protection of the apparatus, or for 
securing access to it, and National Grid shall be entitled to watch and inspect the execution of 
those works. 
(7) Where National Grid requires protective works to be carried out either themselves or by the 
undertaker (whether of a temporary or permanent nature) such protective works shall be carried 
out to National Grid’s satisfaction prior to the commencement of any authorised development (or 
any relevant part thereof) to which sub-paragraph (1) applies and National Grid must give 56 
days’ notice of such works from the date of submission of a plan in line with sub-paragraph (1) or 
(2) (except in an emergency). 
(8) If National Grid in accordance with sub-paragraph (5) or (7) and in consequence of the 
works proposed by the undertaker, reasonably requires the removal of any apparatus and gives 
written notice to the undertaker of that requirement, paragraphs (17) to (19) and (22) to (23) shall 
apply as if the removal of the apparatus had been required by the undertaker under paragraph 
22(2). 
(9) Nothing in this paragraph shall preclude the undertaker from submitting at any time or from 
time to time, but in no case less than 56 days before commencing the execution of any works 
comprising the authorised development, a new plan, instead of the plan previously submitted, and 
having done so the provisions of this paragraph shall apply to and in respect of the new plan. 
(10) The undertaker shall not be required to comply with sub-paragraph (1) where it needs to 
carry out emergency works as defined in the 1991 Act but in that case it must give to National

execution of those works. 
(8) Where National Grid require any protective works to be carried out either themselves or by 
the undertaker (whether of a temporary or permanent nature) such protective works must be 
carried out to National Grid’s satisfaction prior to the commencement of any authorised 
development (or any relevant part thereof) to which sub-paragraph (1) applies and National Grid 
must give 56 days’ notice of such works from the date of submission of a plan in line with sub-
paragraphs (1), (2), (3) or (6) (except in an emergency) 
 
85 
(9) If National Grid in accordance with sub-paragraph (6) or (8) and in consequence of the 
works proposed by the undertaker, reasonably requires the removal of any apparatus and gives 
written notice to the undertaker of that requirement, paragraphs (17) to (19) and (22) to (23) shall 
apply as if the removal of the apparatus had been required by the undertaker under paragraph 
22(2). 
(10) Nothing in this paragraph shall preclude the undertaker from submitting at any time or from 
time to time, but in no case less than 56 days before commencing the execution of any works, a 
new plan, instead of the plan previously submitted, and having done so the provisions of this 
paragraph shall apply to and in respect of the new plan. 
(11) The undertaker shall not be required to comply with sub-paragraph (1) where it needs to 
carry out emergency works as defined in the 1991 Act but in that case it must give to National 
Grid notice as soon as is reasonably practicable and a plan of those works and shall— 
(a) comply with sub-paragraphs (6), (7) and (8) insofar as is reasonably practicable in the 
circumstances; and 
(b) comply with sub-paragraph (12) at all times. 
(12) At all times when carrying out any works authorised under the Order, the undertaker must 
comply with National Grid’s policies for development near over headlines ENA TA 43-8 and the

(13) This paragraph shall not apply to numbered work 7. 
Expenses 
26.—(1) Subject to the following provisions of this paragraph, the undertaker shall pay to 
National Grid on demand all charges, costs and expenses reasonably anticipated or incurred by 
National Grid in, or in connection with, the inspection, removal, relaying or replacing, alteration 
or protection of any apparatus or the construction of any new apparatus or alternative apparatus 
which may be required in consequence of the execution of any such works as are referred to in 
this Schedule including without limitation— 
(a) any costs reasonably incurred or compensation properly paid in connection with the 
acquisition of rights or the exercise of statutory powers for such apparatus including 
without limitation in the event that National Grid elects to use compulsory purchase 
powers to acquire any necessary rights under paragraph 22(3) all costs incurred as a result 
of such action; 
(b) in connection with the cost of the carrying out of any diversion work or the provision of 
any alternative apparatus; 
(c) the cutting off of any apparatus from any other apparatus or the making safe of redundant 
apparatus; 
(d) the approval of plans; 
(e) the carrying out of protective works, plus a capitalised sum to cover the cost of 
maintaining and renewing permanent protective works; 
(f) the survey of any land, apparatus or works, the inspection and monitoring of works or the 
installation or removal of any temporary works reasonably necessary in consequence of 
the execution of any such works referred to in this Schedule. 
(2) There must be deducted from any sum payable under sub-paragraph (1) the value of any 
apparatus removed under the provisions of this Schedule and which is not re-used as part of the 
alternative apparatus, that value being calculated after removal. 
(3) If in accordance with the provisions of this part of this Schedule— 
(a) apparatus of better type, of greater capacity or of greater dimensions is placed in 
substitution for existing apparatus of worse type, of smaller capacity or of smaller 
dimensions; or 
(b) apparatus (whether existing apparatus or apparatus substituted for existing apparatus) is 
placed at a depth greater than the depth at which the existing apparatus was situated, 
 
86 
and the placing of apparatus of that type or capacity or of those dimensions or the placing of 
apparatus at that depth, as the case may be, is not agreed by the undertaker or in default of 
agreement settled by arbitration in accordance with article 43 (arbitration) of the Order to be 
necessary, then, if such placing involves cost in the construction of works under this part of this 
Schedule exceeding that which would have been involved if the apparatus placed had been of the 
existing type, capacity or dimensions, or at the existing depth, as the case may be, the amount 
which apart from this sub-paragraph would be payable to National Grid by virtue of sub-paragraph 
(1) shall be reduced by the amount of that excess save where it is not possible in the circumstances 
to obtain the existing type of operations, capacity, dimensions or place at the existing depth in 
which case full costs shall be borne by the undertaker. 
(4) For the purposes of sub-paragraph (3)— 
(a) an extension of apparatus to a length greater than the length of existing apparatus shall 
not be treated as a placing of apparatus of greater dimensions than those of the existing 
apparatus; and 
(b) where the provision of a joint in a pipe or cable is agreed, or is determined to be 
necessary, the consequential provision of a jointing chamber or of a manhole shall be 
treated as if it also had been agreed or had been so determined. 
(5) An amount which apart from this sub-paragraph would be payable to National Grid in 
respect of works by virtue of sub-paragraph (1) shall, if the works include the placing of apparatus 
provided in substitution for apparatus placed more than 7 years and 6 months earlier so as to 
confer on National Grid any financial benefit by deferment of the time for renewal of the 
apparatus in the ordinary course, be reduced by the amount which represents that benefit. 
Indemnity 
27.—(1) Subject to sub-paragraphs (2) and (3), if by reason or in consequence of the 
construction of any works authorised by this Schedule or in consequence of the construction, use, 
maintenance or failure of any of the authorised development by or on behalf of the undertaker or 
in consequence of any act or default of the undertaker (or any person employed or authorised by 
him) in the course of carrying out such works (including without limitation works carried out by 
the undertaker under this Schedule or any subsidence resulting from any of these works), any 
damage is caused to any apparatus or alternative apparatus (other than apparatus the repair of 
which is not reasonably necessary in view of its intended removal for the purposes of those 
works) or property of National Grid, or there is any interruption in any service provided, or in the 
supply of any goods, by National Grid, or National Grid becomes liable to pay any amount to 
any third party, the undertaker shall— 
(a) bear and pay on demand the cost reasonably incurred by National Grid in making good 
such damage or restoring the supply; and 
(b) indemnify National Grid for any other expenses, loss, demands, proceedings, damages, 
claims, penalty or costs incurred by or recovered from National Grid, by reason or in 
consequence of any such damage or interruption or National Grid becoming liable to any 
third party as aforesaid. 
(2) The fact that any act or thing may have been done by National Grid on behalf of the 
undertaker or in accordance with a plan approved by National Grid or in accordance with any 
requirement of National Grid as a consequence of the authorised development or under its 
supervision shall not (unless sub-paragraph (3) applies) excuse the undertaker from liability under 
the provisions of this sub-paragraph (1) where the undertaker fails to carry out and execute the 
works properly with due care and attention and in a skilful and workman like manner or in a 
manner that does not materially accord with the approved plan or as otherwise agreed between the 
undertaker and National Grid. 
(3) Nothing in sub-paragraph (1) shall impose any liability on the undertaker in respect of— 
(a) any damage or interruption to the extent that it is attributable to the neglect or default of 
National Grid, its officers, servants, contractors or agents; and 
 
87 
(b) any authorised development and/or any other works authorised by this Schedule carried 
out by National Grid as an assignee, transferee or lessee of the undertaker with the benefit 
of the Order pursuant to section 156 of the 2008 Act or under article 6 of the Order 
subject to the proviso that once such works become apparatus (“new apparatus”), any 
works yet to be executed and not falling within this sub-section 3(b) shall be subject to 
the full terms of this Schedule including this paragraph (27) in respect of such new 
apparatus. 
(4) National Grid must give the undertaker reasonable notice of any such claim or demand and 
no settlement or compromise shall be made, unless payment is required in connection with a 
statutory compensation scheme without first consulting the undertaker and considering their 
representations. 
(5) National Grid must use its reasonable endeavours to mitigate in whole or in part and to 
minimise any costs, expenses, loss, demands, and penalties to which the indemnity under this 
paragraph (27) applies. If requested to do so by the undertaker, National Grid shall provide an 
explanation of how the claim has been minimised. The undertaker shall only be liable under this 
paragraph (27) for claims reasonably incurred by National Grid. 
Enactments and agreements 
28. Nothing in this part of this Schedule shall affect the provisions of any enactment or 
agreement regulating the relations between the undertaker and National Grid in respect of any 
apparatus laid or erected in land belonging to the undertaker on the date on which this Order is 
made. 
Co-operation 
29. National Grid and the undertaker must each use their best endeavours to co-ordinate with 
the other party on the timing and method of execution of any works carried out under the Order 
or this Schedule (including, for the avoidance of doubt, pursuant to paragraph 22(2) and 
paragraphs (24) or (28)) in the interests of safety and the efficient and economic execution of the 
authorised development and taking into account the need to ensure the safe and efficient 
operation of the other party’s operations. 
Access 
30. If in consequence of the agreement reached in accordance with paragraph 21(1) or the 
powers granted under this Order the access to any apparatus is materially obstructed, the 
undertaker shall provide such alternative means of access to such apparatus as will enable 
National Grid to maintain or use the apparatus no less effectively than was possible before such 
obstruction. 
Arbitration 
31. Save for differences or disputes arising under paragraphs 22(2), 22(4), 23(1), 24 and 25 any 
difference or dispute arising between the undertaker and National Grid under this Schedule shall, 
unless otherwise agreed in writing between the undertaker and National Grid, be determined by 
arbitration in accordance with article 43 (arbitration) of the Order. 
 
88 
PART 4 
FOR THE PROTECTION OF EPN(a) 
32. For the protection of EPN as referred to in this part of this Schedule the following 
provisions have effect, unless otherwise agreed in writing between the undertaker and EPN. 
33. In this part of this Schedule— 
“alternative apparatus” means alternative apparatus adequate to enable EPN to fulfil its 
statutory functions in a manner not less efficient than previously; 
“apparatus” means electric lines or electrical plant (as defined in the Electricity Act 1989(b)), 
belonging to or maintained by EPN; 
“functions” includes powers and duties; 
“in”, in a context referring to apparatus or alternative apparatus in land, includes a reference to 
apparatus or alternative apparatus under, over or upon land; and 
“EPN” means Eastern Power Networks plc (Company No. 02366906) whose registered office 
is at Newington House, 237 Southwark Bridge Road, London SE1 6NP; 
34. This part of this Schedule does not apply to apparatus in respect of which the relations 
between the undertaker and EPN are regulated by the provisions of Part 3 of the 1991 Act. 
35. Regardless of the temporary prohibition or restriction of use of streets under the powers 
conferred by article 11 (temporary prohibition or restriction of use of streets), EPN is at liberty at 
all times to take all necessary access across any such street and to execute and do all such works 
and things in, upon or under any such street as may be reasonably necessary or desirable to 
enable it to maintain any apparatus which at the time of the prohibition or restriction was in that 
street. 
36. Regardless of any provision in this Order or anything shown on the land plans, the 
undertaker must not acquire any apparatus otherwise than by agreement. 
37.—(1) If, in the exercise of the powers conferred by this Order, the undertaker acquires any 
interest in any land in which any apparatus is placed or over which access to any apparatus is 
enjoyed or requires that EPN’s apparatus is relocated or diverted, that apparatus must not be 
removed under this part of this Schedule, and any right of EPN to maintain that apparatus in that 
land and to gain access to it must not be extinguished, until alternative apparatus has been 
constructed and is in operation, and access to it has been provided, to the reasonable satisfaction 
of EPN in accordance with sub-paragraphs (2) to (7). 
(2) If, for the purpose of executing any works in, on or under any land purchased, held, 
appropriated or used under this Order, the undertaker requires the removal of any apparatus placed 
in that land, the undertaker must give to EPN written notice of that requirement, together with a 
plan and section of the work proposed, and of the proposed position of the alternative apparatus to 
be provided or constructed and in that case (or if in consequence of the exercise of any of the 
powers conferred by this Order EPN reasonably needs to remove any of its apparatus) the 
undertaker must, subject to sub-paragraph (3), afford to EPN the necessary facilities and rights for 
the construction of alternative apparatus in other land of the undertaker and subsequently for the 
maintenance of that apparatus. 
(3) If alternative apparatus or any part of such apparatus is to be constructed elsewhere than in 
other land of the undertaker, or the undertaker is unable to afford such facilities and rights as are 
mentioned in sub-paragraph (2), in the land in which the alternative apparatus or part of such 
apparatus is to be constructed, EPN must, on receipt of a written notice to that effect from the 
                                                                                                                                            
(a) This Part is agreed with EPN. 
(b) 1989 c.29. 
 
89 
undertaker, as soon as reasonably possible use reasonable endeavours to obtain the necessary 
facilities and rights in the land in which the alternative apparatus is to be constructed provided that 
this obligation shall not require EPN to exercise any power it may have to acquire any land or 
rights by compulsory purchase order. 
(4) Any alternative apparatus to be constructed in land of the undertaker under this part of this 
Schedule must be constructed in such manner and in such line or situation as may be agreed 
between EPN and the undertaker or in default of agreement settled by arbitration in accordance 
with article 43 (arbitration). 
(5) EPN must, after the alternative apparatus to be provided or constructed has been agreed or 
settled by arbitration in accordance with article 43 (arbitration), and after the grant to EPN of any 
such facilities and rights as are referred to in sub-paragraph (2) or (3), proceed without 
unnecessary delay to construct and bring into operation the alternative apparatus and subsequently 
to remove any apparatus required by the undertaker to be removed under the provisions of this 
part of this Schedule. 
(6) Regardless of anything in sub-paragraph (5), if the undertaker gives notice in writing to EPN 
that it desires itself to execute any work, or part of any work, in connection with the construction 
or removal of apparatus in any land controlled by the undertaker, that work, instead of being 
executed by EPN, must be executed by the undertaker without unnecessary delay under the 
superintendence, if given, and to the reasonable satisfaction of EPN. 
(7) Nothing in sub-paragraph (6) authorises the undertaker to execute the placing, installation, 
bedding, packing, removal, connection or disconnection of any apparatus, or execute any filling 
around the apparatus (where the apparatus is laid in a trench) within 300 millimetres of the 
apparatus. 
38.—(1) Where, in accordance with the provisions of this part of this Schedule, the undertaker 
affords to EPN facilities and rights for the construction and maintenance in land of the 
undertaker of alternative apparatus in substitution for apparatus to be removed, those facilities 
and rights must be granted upon such terms and conditions as may be agreed between the 
undertaker and EPN or in default of agreement settled by arbitration in accordance with article 
43 (arbitration). 
(2) If the facilities and rights to be afforded by the undertaker in respect of any alternative 
apparatus, and the terms and conditions subject to which those facilities and rights are to be 
granted, are in the opinion of the arbitrator less favourable on the whole to EPN than the facilities 
and rights enjoyed by it in respect of the apparatus to be removed and the terms and conditions to 
which those facilities and rights are subject, the arbitrator must make such provision for the 
payment of compensation by the undertaker to EPN as appears to the arbitrator to be reasonable 
having regard to all the circumstances of the particular case. 
39.—(1) Not less than 28 days before starting the execution of any works in, on or under any 
land purchased, held, appropriated or used under this Order that are near to, or will or may affect, 
any apparatus the removal of which has not been required by the undertaker under paragraph 
37(2), the undertaker must submit to EPN a plan, section and description of the works to be 
executed. 
(2) Those works must be executed only in accordance with the plan, section and description 
submitted under sub-paragraph (1) and in accordance with such reasonable requirements as may 
be made in accordance with sub-paragraph (3) by EPN for the alteration or otherwise for the 
protection of the apparatus, or for securing access to it, and EPN is entitled to watch and inspect 
the execution of those works. 
(3) Any requirements made by EPN under sub-paragraph (2) must be made within a period of 
21 days beginning with the date on which a plan, section and description under sub-paragraph (1) 
are submitted to it. 
(4) If EPN in accordance with sub-paragraph (3) and in consequence of the works proposed by 
the undertaker, reasonably requires the removal of any apparatus and gives written notice to the 
undertaker of that requirement, paragraphs (32) to (38) apply as if the removal of the apparatus 
had been required by the undertaker under paragraph 37(2). 
 
90 
(5) Nothing in this paragraph precludes the undertaker from submitting at any time or from time 
to time, but in no case less than 28 days before commencing the execution of any works, a new 
plan, section and description instead of the plan, section and description previously submitted, and 
having done so the provisions of this paragraph apply to and in respect of the new plan, section 
and description. 
(6) The undertaker is not required to comply with sub-paragraph (1) in a case of emergency but 
in that case it must give to EPN notice as soon as is reasonably practicable and a plan, section and 
description of those works as soon as reasonably practicable subsequently and must comply with 
sub-paragraph (2) in so far as is reasonably practicable in the circumstances. 
40.—(1) Subject to the following provisions of this paragraph, the undertaker must repay to 
EPN the reasonable expenses incurred by EPN in, or in connection with, the inspection, removal, 
alteration or protection of any apparatus or the construction of any new apparatus which may be 
required in consequence of the execution of any such works as are referred to in paragraph 37(2). 
(2) There is to be deducted from any sum payable under sub-paragraph (1) the value of any 
apparatus removed under the provisions of this part of this Schedule, that value being calculated 
after removal. 
(3) If in accordance with the provisions of this part of this Schedule— 
(a) apparatus of better type, of greater capacity or of greater dimensions is placed in 
substitution for existing apparatus of worse type, of smaller capacity or of smaller 
dimensions; or 
(b) apparatus (whether existing apparatus or apparatus substituted for existing apparatus) is 
placed at a depth greater than the depth at which the existing apparatus was, 
and the placing of apparatus of that type or capacity or of those dimensions or the placing of 
apparatus at that depth, as the case may be, is not agreed by the undertaker or, in default of 
agreement, is not determined by arbitration in accordance with article 43 (arbitration) to be 
necessary, then, if such placing involves cost in the construction of works under this part of this 
Schedule exceeding that which would have been involved if the apparatus placed had been of the 
existing type, capacity or dimensions, or at the existing depth, as the case may be, the amount 
which apart from this sub-paragraph would be payable to EPN by virtue of sub-paragraph (1) is to 
be reduced by the amount of that excess. 
(4) For the purposes of sub-paragraph (3)— 
(a) an extension of apparatus to a length greater than the length of existing apparatus is not to 
be treated as a placing of apparatus of greater dimensions than those of the existing 
apparatus where such extension is required in consequence of the execution of any such 
works as are referred to in paragraph 37(2); and 
(b) where the provision of a joint in a cable is agreed, or is determined to be necessary, the 
consequential provision of a jointing chamber or of a manhole is to be treated as if it also 
had been agreed or had been so determined. 
(5) An amount which apart from this sub-paragraph would be payable to EPN in respect of 
works by virtue of sub-paragraph (1), if the works include the placing of apparatus provided in 
substitution for apparatus placed more than 7 years and 6 months earlier so as to confer on EPN 
any financial benefit by deferment of the time for renewal of the apparatus in the ordinary course, 
is to be reduced by the amount which represents that benefit. 
41.—(1) Subject to sub-paragraphs (2) and (3), if by reason or in consequence of the 
construction of any of the works referred to in paragraph 37(2), any damage is caused to any 
apparatus (other than apparatus the repair of which is not reasonably necessary in view of its 
intended removal for the purposes of those works) or property of EPN, or there is any 
interruption in any service provided, or in the supply of any goods, by EPN, the undertaker 
must— 
(a) bear and pay the cost reasonably incurred by EPN in making good such damage or 
restoring the supply; and 
 
91 
(b) indemnify EPN for any other expenses, loss, demands, proceedings, damages, claims, 
penalty or costs incurred by or recovered from EPN, 
by reason or in consequence of any such damage or interruption. 
(2) Nothing in sub-paragraph (1) imposes any liability on the undertaker with respect to any 
damage or interruption to the extent that it is attributable to the act, neglect or default of EPN, its 
officers, servants, contractors or agents. 
(3) EPN must give the undertaker reasonable notice of any such claim or demand and no 
settlement or compromise is to be made without the consent of the undertaker which, if it 
withholds such consent, has the sole conduct of any settlement or compromise or of any

Act. 
46.—(1) The undertaker must not interfere with, build over or near to any apparatus within the 
Order land or execute the placing, installation, bedding, packing, removal, connection or 
disconnection of any apparatus, or execute any filling around the apparatus (where the apparatus 
is laid in a trench) within the standard protection strips which are the strips of land falling the

or contractor responsible for carrying out the authorised development on behalf of the 
undertaker. 
47. The alteration, extension, removal or re-location of any apparatus shall not be implemented 
until— 
(a) any requirement for any permits under the Environmental Permitting (England and 
Wales) Regulations 2010 (a) or other legislation and any other associated consents are

93 
obtained, and any approval or agreement required from Anglian Water on alternative 
outfall locations as a result of such re-location are approved, such approvals from Anglian 
Water not to be unreasonably withheld or delayed; and 
(b) the undertaker has made the appropriate application required under the Water Industry 
Act 1991 together with a plan and section of the works proposed and Anglian Water has 
agreed all of the contractual documentation required under the Water Industry Act 1991, 
such agreement not to be unreasonably withheld or delayed; and such works to be 
executed only in accordance with the plan, section and description submitted and in 
accordance with such reasonable requirements as may be made by Anglian Water for the 
alteration or otherwise for the protection of the apparatus, or for securing access to it. 
48. In the situation, where in exercise of the powers conferred by the Order, the undertaker 
acquires any interest in any land in which Apparatus is placed and such apparatus is to be 
relocated, extended, removed or altered in any way, no alteration or extension shall take place 
until Anglian Water has established to its reasonable satisfaction in a timely manner, contingency 
arrangements in order to conduct its functions for the duration of the works to relocate, extend, 
remove or alter the apparatus or provide alternative apparatus. 
49. Regardless of any provision in this Order or anything shown on any plan, the undertaker 
must not acquire any apparatus otherwise than by agreement, and before extinguishing any 
existing rights for Anglian Water to use, keep, inspect, renew and maintain its apparatus in the 
Order land, the undertaker shall, with the agreement of Anglian Water, create a new right to use, 
keep, inspect, renew and maintain the apparatus that is reasonably convenient for Anglian Water 
such agreement not to be unreasonably withheld or delayed, and to be subject to arbitration under 
article 43 (arbitration). 
50. If the undertaker is unable to create the new rights referred to in paragraph (49), Anglian 
Water must, on receipt of a written notice to that effect from the undertaker, as soon as 
reasonably possible, use its reasonable endeavours to obtain the necessary rights. 
51. If in consequence of the exercise of the powers conferred by the Order the access to any 
apparatus is materially obstructed the undertaker shall provide such alternative means of access 
to such apparatus as will enable Anglian Water to maintain or use the apparatus no less 
effectively than was possible before such obstruction. 
52. In consequence of the exercise of the powers conferred by the Order, previously unmapped 
sewers, lateral drains or other apparatus are identified by the undertaker, notification of the 
location of such assets will immediately be given to Anglian Water and afforded the same 
protection of other Anglian Water assets. 
53. If for any reason or in consequence of the construction of any of the works referred to in 
paragraphs 46, 47 and 48 and 52 above any damage is caused to any apparatus (other than 
apparatus the repair of which is not reasonably necessary in view of its intended removal for the 
purposes of those works) or property of Anglian Water, or there is any interruption in any service 
provided, or in the supply of any goods, by Anglian Water, the undertaker shall— 
(a) bear and pay the cost reasonably incurred by Anglian Water in making good any damage 
or restoring the supply; and 
(b) make reasonable compensation to Anglian Water for any other expenses, loss, damages, 
penalty or costs incurred by Anglian Water, 
by reason or in consequence of any such damage or interruption. 
54.—(1) Nothing in paragraph 53 imposes any liability on the undertaker in respect of any 
damage or interruption to the extent that it is attributable to the neglect or default of Anglian 
Water, its officers’ servants, contractors or agents. 
                                                                                                                                            
(a) S.I. 2010/675 
 
94 
(2) Anglian Water must give the undertaker reasonable notice of any claim or demand pursuant 
to paragraph 53 and must consider its representations before proceeding further in respect of the 
claim or demand. 
(3) Anglian Water must use its reasonable endeavours to mitigate in whole or in part and to 
minimise any claim, costs, expenses, loss, demands and penalties pursuant to paragraph 53. If 
requested to do so by the undertaker, Anglian Water shall provide an explanation of how the claim 
has been minimised 
55. Any difference or dispute arising between the undertaker and Anglian Water under this 
schedule must, unless otherwise agreed in writing between the undertaker and Anglian Water, be 
determined by arbitration in accordance with article 43 (arbitration).

SCHEDULE 12 
Article 42 
Applications made under requirements 
1.—(1) Where an application has been made to the relevant authority for any consent, 
agreement or approval required by a requirement (including agreement or approval in respect of 
part of a requirement) included in this Order the relevant authority must give notice to the 
undertaker of their decision on the application within a period of eight (8) weeks beginning 
with— 
(a) the day immediately following that on which the application is received by the authority; 
(b) the day immediately following that on which further information has been supplied by the 
undertaker under paragraph 2; or 
(c) such longer period as may be agreed by the undertaker and the relevant authority in 
writing. 
(2) Subject to sub-paragraph (3), in the event that the relevant authority does not determine an 
application within the period set out in sub-paragraph (1), the relevant authority is to be taken to 
have granted all parts of the application (without any condition or qualification) at the end of that 
period. 
(3) Where— 
(a) an application has been made to the relevant planning authority for any consent, 
agreement or approval required by a requirement included in this Order; and 
(b) the relevant planning authority does not determine such application within the period set 
out in sub-paragraph (1); and 
(c) such application is accompanied by a report that considers it likely that the subject matter 
of such application will give rise to any materially new or materially different 
environmental effects in comparison with the authorised development as approved, then 
the application is to be taken to have been refused by the relevant planning authority at 
the end of that period. 
Further information 
2.—(1) In relation to any part of the application to which this Schedule applies, the relevant 
authority has the right to request such further information from the undertaker as is necessary to 
enable it to consider the application. 
(2) In the event that it considers such further information to be necessary the relevant authority 
must, within twenty one (21) days of receipt of the application, notify the undertaker in writing 
specifying the further information required and (if applicable) to which part of the application it 
relates. In the event that the relevant planning authority does not give such notification within this 
twenty one (21) day period it is deemed to have sufficient information to consider the application 
and thereafter is not entitled to request further information without the prior agreement of the 
undertaker. 
 
100 
(3) Where further information is requested under this paragraph 2 in relation to part only of an 
application, that part is to be treated as separate from the remainder of the application for the 
purposes of calculating time periods in paragraph 1(1)(b), paragraph 1(3) and paragraph 2. 
Appeals 
3.—(1) The undertaker may appeal in the event that— 
(a) the relevant authority refuses (including a deemed refusal pursuant to paragraph 1(3)) an 
application for any consent, agreement or approval required by an article or requirement 
included in this Order or grants it subject to conditions; 
(b) on receipt of a request for further information pursuant to paragraph 2 the undertaker 
considers that either the whole or part of the specified information requested by the 
relevant authority is not necessary for consideration of the application; or 
(c) on receipt of any further information requested, the relevant authority notifies the 
undertaker that the information provided is inadequate and requests additional 
information which the undertaker considers is not necessary for consideration of the 
application. 
(2) The appeal process is to be as follows— 
(a) The undertaker must submit the appeal documentation to the Secretary of State and must 
on the same day provide copies of the appeal documentation to the relevant authority and 
any article or requirement consultee (together with the undertaker, these are the “appeal 
parties”); 
(b) The Secretary of State must appoint a person within twenty (20) business days of 
receiving the appeal documentation and must forthwith notify the appeal parties of the 
identity of the appointed person and the address to which all correspondence for his 
attention should be sent; 
(c) The relevant authority and any requirement consultee must submit written representations 
to the appointed person in respect of the appeal within twenty (20) business days of the 
start date and must ensure that copies of their written representations are sent to each 
other and to the undertaker on the day on which they are submitted to the appointed 
person; 
(d) The appeal parties must make any counter-submissions to the appointed person within 
twenty (20) business days of receipt of written representations pursuant to sub-paragraph 
(c) above; and 
(e) The appointed person must make his decision and notify it to the appeal parties, with 
reasons, as soon as reasonably practicable and in any event within thirty (30) business 
days of the deadline for the receipt of counter-submissions pursuant to sub-paragraph (d). 
The appointment of the person pursuant to sub-paragraph (b) may be undertaken by a person 
appointed by the Secretary of State for this purpose instead of by the Secretary of State. 
(3) In the event that the appointed person considers that further information is necessary to 
enable him to consider the appeal he must, within five (5) days of his appointment, notify the 
appeal parties in writing specifying the further information required. 
(4) Any further information required pursuant to sub-paragraph (3) must be provided by the 
undertaker to the appointed person, the relevant authority and any requirement consultee on the 
date specified by the appointed person (the “specified date”), and the appointed person must notify 
the appeal parties of the revised timetable for the appeal on or before that day. The revised 
timetable for the appeal must require submission of written representations to the appointed person 
within ten (10) days of the specified date but must otherwise be in accordance with the process 
and time limits set out in sub-paragraph (2)(c)-(e). 
(5) On an appeal under this paragraph, the appointed person may— 
(a) allow or dismiss the appeal, or 
 
101 
(b) reverse or vary any part of the decision of the relevant authority (whether the appeal 
relates to that part of it or not), 
and may deal with the application as if it had been made to him in the first instance. 
(6) The appointed person may take into account written representations that have been sent 
outside of the relevant time limits but the appointed person must proceed to a decision within the 
time limits set by this Schedule. 
(7) The appointed person may proceed to a decision even though no written representations have 
been made within the relevant time limits, if it appears to him that there is sufficient material to 
enable a decision to be made on the merits of the case. 
(8) The decision of the appointed person on an appeal is to be final and binding on the parties, 
and a court may entertain proceedings for questioning the decision only if the proceedings are 
brought by a claim for judicial review. 
(9) If an approval is given by the appointed person pursuant to this Schedule, it is deemed to be 
an approval for the purpose of Schedule 2 of this Order as if it had been given by the relevant 
authority. The relevant authority may confirm any determination given by the appointed person in 
identical form in writing but a failure to give such confirmation (or a failure to give it in identical 
form) is not to be taken to affect or invalidate the effect of the appointed person’s determination. 
(10) The appointed person may or may not be a member of the Planning Inspectorate but must 
be a qualified town planner of at least ten (10) years’ experience. 
(11) Save where a direction is given pursuant to sub-paragraph (12) requiring the costs of the 
appointed person to be paid by the relevant authority, the reasonable costs of the appointed person 
must be met by the undertaker. 
(12) On application by the relevant authority or the undertaker, the appointed person may give 
directions as to the costs of the appeal parties and as to the parties by whom the costs of the appeal 
are to be paid. In considering whether to make any such direction and the terms on which it is to 
be made, the appointed person must have regard to Planning Practice Guidance: Appeals (March 
2014) or any circular or guidance which may from time to time replace it. 
4. In this Schedule “relevant authority” means the relevant planning authority, relevant 
highway authority, traffic authority, street authority, or the owner of a watercourse, sewer or 
drain as may be appropriate to the consent, agreement or approval sought.
