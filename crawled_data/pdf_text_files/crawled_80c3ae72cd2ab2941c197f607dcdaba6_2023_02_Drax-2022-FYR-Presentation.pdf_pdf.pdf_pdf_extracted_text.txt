Forward Looking Statements
This presentation may contain certain statements, expectations, statistics, projections and other information that are or may be forward-
looking. The accuracy and completeness of all such statements, including, without limitation, statements regarding the future financial 
position, strategy, projected costs, plans, beliefs and objectives for the management of future operations of Drax Group plc (“Drax”) and 
its subsidiaries (the “Group”), are not warranted or guaranteed. By their nature, forward-looking statements involve risk and uncertainty 
because they relate to events and depend on circumstances that may occur in the future. Although Drax believes that the statements,

future revenues being lower than expected; increasing competitive pressures in the industry; uncertainty as to future investment and 
support achieved in enabling the realisation of strategic aims and objectives; and/or general economic conditions or conditions affecting 
the relevant industry, both domestically and internationally, being less favourable than expected including the impact of prevailing 
economic and political uncertainty. We do not intend to publicly update or revise these projections or other forward-looking statements 
to reflect events or circumstances after the date hereof, and we do not assume any responsibility for doing so.

UK CT rates, acquisition costs, gain on sale of CCGT generation assets (2021), restructuring costs, debt restructuring costs and asset obsolescence charges and impairments), and certain remeasurements on derivative contracts. Adjusted EBITDA and EPS 
measures exclude amounts attributable to non-controlling interests.
2) Includes continuing and discontinued operations (2021: £20m of discontinued operations – CCGT generation assets).
3) Cash and short-term investments of £238m less borrowings of £1,444m (less impact of hedging instruments within borrowings of £2m, less NCI share of cash of £1m).

Growing Scientific Support for Carbon Removals
BECCS has an important role to play
All the illustrative mitigation pathways assessed in the IPCC’s latest report use significant volumes of CDRs, and specifically 
BECCS as a key tool for mitigating climate change. Globally between 0.5-9.5bn tonnes of CDRs via BECCS will be required
Even with rapid investment in emission reductions, the United States could need to remove about 2bn tonnes of CO2 per year 
by midcentury to reach net-zero
10–20bn tonnes of CO2 removals needed every year if we are to keep warming below Paris Agreement thresholds
The IEA’s Sustainable Development Scenario requires BECCS and DACs to remove c.3bn tonnes of CO2eq in 2070

Electricity Generator Levy
A levy on renewable and low-carbon generators
Applies to the three biomass units operating under the Renewable Obligation scheme and run of river hydro 
operations
The levy will not apply to Drax’s CfD biomass unit, pumped storage hydro and coal generation
Structured as a levy on power sales above a benchmark of £75/MWh (indexed to CPI from April 2024)
Includes an allowable exceptional fuel cost element which increases the benchmark and is calculated retrospectively 
based on the actual cost above a baseline fuel cost of £65/MWh or historical levels, whichever is lower
No change to policy to pay a sustainable and growing dividend
