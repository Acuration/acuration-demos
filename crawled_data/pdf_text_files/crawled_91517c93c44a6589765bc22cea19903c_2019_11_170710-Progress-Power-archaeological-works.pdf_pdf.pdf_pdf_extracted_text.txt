Progress Power: Summary of 
archaeological works
July 2017
Introduction
From the 3rd to the 24th of May 2017, Oxford Archaeology East on behalf of Drax 
undertook a trial trench evaluation of the development area for the Progress Power 
Station.
The survey work was undertaken as a requirement of the planning permission or 
‘Development Consent Order’ granted to project by the Planning Inspectorate in 
2015. 
The evaluation involved the excavation of 89 x 30m long trenches across the 
development site. 
The field work was inspected by Suffolk County Council’s archaeology team, prior to 
the trenches being backfilled. The trenches were backfilled with subsoil first and then 
the topsoil.
The survey work has revealed dispersed archaeology. A report is now being prepared 
by Oxford Archaeology to be shared with the County Council.
A selection of photos from the survey work are included in this document.
