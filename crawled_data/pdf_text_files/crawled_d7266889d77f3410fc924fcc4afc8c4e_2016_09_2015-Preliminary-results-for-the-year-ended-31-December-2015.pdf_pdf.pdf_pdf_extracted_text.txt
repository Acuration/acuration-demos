Chairman’s statement 
In my first year as Chairman it has certainly been challenging for the Group. However, the progress we made to complete 
our conversion to a predominantly biomass-fuelled generator was excellent and more than ever Drax showed the 
essential part it has to play in the UK’s future energy mix. 
The operational performance across the business was strong and in 2016 we will complete the transformation we began 
some 10 years ago. The business we have today is more diverse, built on a dedicated supply chain and backed by world-
leading innovation and technology. It continues to deliver around 8% of the UK’s electricity needs, while providing an 
excellent service to our retail customers. 
Political and regulatory changes 
During the year the government applied the Climate Change Levy (“CCL”) to renewables and announced a potential 
timeline for the closure of coal generating plant. The former had a significant negative impact on our 2015 results, 
reducing EBITDA by an estimated £30 million, and this impact will be double for 2016. 
Many years ago Drax recognised that to limit climate change would require an eventual end to the use of coal generation 
– that is why we embarked on our transformation to become a predominantly biomass fuelled generator. 
In 2010 our power station burnt almost 10 million tonnes of coal. Because of our transformation by 2015 we had lowered 
this to 6 million tonnes. 
But we don’t want to keep burning coal and we don’t have to. There are other options. 
Greater use of sustainably sourced biomass is the fastest, safest and most affordable means by which the UK can move 
away from coal and support greater use of wind and solar in the future. 
With the right policy frameworks we could become 100% renewable through the full conversion of our three remaining 
coal units and we could do this well before 2025. We will continue to work closely with the government to help them 
quickly reduce the UK’s reliance on coal. 
Critical infrastructure 
Drax remains an essential part of the energy mix. Our ability to generate reliable, affordable, renewable power and deliver 
this to a broad range of customers places the Group at the heart of the UK’s power generation. In turn, this creates long-
term value for our shareholders – we remain focused on optimising this value as well as remaining alert to opportunities 
for growth. In this regard we await the outcome of the EU State aid decision during the year. Securing the CfD is a key 
component of our investment case. 
Results and dividend 
Our earnings (EBITDA) for 2015 of £169 million were, as expected, below those of 2014 (£229 million). This result was 
adversely impacted by the dramatic fall in commodity prices and the loss of Levy Exempt Certificate (“LEC”) income from 
August, but it is pleasing to note that the shortfall this created was partially offset by our self-help measures. Our capital 
investment programme (£174 million) was delivered on schedule, whilst we retained strong control over operating costs. 
The refinancing of our £400 million Revolving Credit Facility helped us maintain a robust balance sheet. 
In accordance with our dividend policy, the Board proposes a final dividend in respect of 2015 of 0.6 pence per share, 
equivalent to £2 million. This would give total dividends for the year of £23 million (2014: £48 million). 
Corporate governance 
At Drax we are committed to excellent corporate governance and given the changes and challenges experienced during 
the year the Board and Committees remained very active.  
The year ended with a number of changes to the Board. My predecessor Charles Berry left after our AGM in April. Tony 
Quinlan left the Group in June and was replaced as CFO by Will Gardiner, who joined us in November. Paul Taylor and 
Peter Emery, both executive directors, resigned at the end of December, with Andy Koss appointed to the Board effective 
from 1 January 2016. I would like to thank Charles, Tony, Paul and Peter for their contribution over many years of service 
and welcome Will and Andy to the Board. 
We have an effective Board with complementary skills, knowledge and experience. We will continue to look at how we 
can strengthen this mix during the year. 
 
 
 
Our people 
I have reflected on some of the challenges we faced during the year, but there were also many positives, several of which 
are described in this report. This is in large part down to the dedication and hard work of our people, in every part of the 
business. We are fortunate to employ a workforce with a diverse range of skills and experience, unified by their 
commitment to decarbonising the UK and in making Drax successful. I look forward to working with them over the year 
ahead. 
Finally, I would like to say how delighted I am to be Chairman of Drax. The company is at a pivotal point in its 
development, coinciding with a critically important time for UK energy policy. We are confident and determined that our 
reliable, renewable and affordable generation and supply will be at the heart of UK energy for the long term. 
 
 
 
 
 
Chief Executive’s Review 
For any business operating in the UK energy market, 2015 was a difficult year. 
For Drax it was especially so. Yet operationally, it was a year of strong progress: we moved a step closer to the 
completion of our biomass transformation, upgrading our third unit to enhanced co-firing and the power station to a 
predominantly biomass fuelled generator; we began manufacturing and supplying compressed wood pellets from our mills 
in the USA; and Haven completed another year of record sales. The scale of these achievements cannot be 
underestimated, even more so when one recalls that at the start of our biomass journey we had neither a generation nor 
supply solution. 
Sat alongside this strong operational achievement were some of the toughest commodity markets I have known in my 
career. These were then accompanied by a series of unexpected regulatory announcements, including the removal of the 
Climate Change Levy (“CCL”) exemption, which severely affected the renewables sector and caused many to question 
the UK government’s commitment to decarbonisation. 
In November the Secretary of State for Energy and Climate Change announced the government’s proposal to consult on 
setting a clear end date for coal of March 2025. Given it still provides around 25% of the country’s generating capacity, 
this is an ambitious target which could deliver significant carbon savings and secure electricity if carefully implemented. 
We stand ready to assist with this. Coal is high carbon and we need to urgently reduce our dependency on it. Part of the 
solution is new nuclear and gas. But, as a recent report by the Institute of Mechanical Engineers noted, the country will 
find it very difficult to build enough new facilities in time to replace the lost coal capacity. 
The fastest, most affordable and safest way to end coal use is to further deploy the world leading low carbon technology 
Drax has pioneered to upgrade some of the UK’s existing coal fired power stations to biomass. Our strategic priorities are 
aligned with this and, with the right support framework we stand ready to help make this happen. 
Affordability 
The current administration has been clear – when it comes to new renewable generating capacity, affordability is a critical 
criterion. Recent work by the economic consultancy NERA and Imperial College has found that on a whole system cost 
basis biomass is £7-£35/MWh more affordable than other technologies. If these support levels were then modelled in the 
government’s planned renewable energy auctions for later this year, consumers could save in the region of £2 billion. At 
the same time it could take four years for a new build gas facility to come online, even if it can be shown that it could 
achieve an acceptable return on investment. It is because of these factors that we believe there to be a very strong case 
for further coal to biomass upgrades at Drax and we will continue to work closely with government to help the country 
achieve its goals. 
Sustainability 
It is important to note that Drax is on the journey from coal to sustainable biomass, quickly and safely reducing the UK’s 
carbon emissions whilst still generating reliable and affordable electricity. 
Our biomass technology achieves a carbon saving of up to 80% vs coal – a figure independently audited by PwC and 
verified by our industry regulator, Ofgem. We are Europe’s single largest decarbonisation project and if we were able to 
upgrade 100% of our power station to sustainable biomass, we would make an even larger contribution toward the 
decarbonisation of the UK. 
On both a personal and professional level I was pleased with the continued progress being made by the Sustainable 
Biomass Partnership (“SBP”). In March it launched its framework which would allow companies in the biomass sector to 
demonstrate compliance with legal, regulatory and sustainability requirements relating to woody biomass. In December 
this framework was recognised by Ofgem as being fully compliant with the UK’s Renewables Obligation legislation. This 
firmly established SBP as an effective certification scheme for biomass users to demonstrate compliance with regulatory 
requirements. It also adds to recognition in Denmark through the Danish Energy Agreement, and is undergoing evaluation 
in Belgium and The Netherlands. 
Safety 
Excellent safety management has always been at the centre of our management ethos and I am pleased to say that in the 
UK our performance remains industry-leading. In the US, we exceeded our safety targets for 2015 and have made great 
strides toward instilling a culture of safety through the implementation of various proactive safety protocols across our 
facilities. As has always been the case, the safety and well being of our employees and contractors will remain my primary 
operational priority. 
 
 
 
 
 
Strategic priorities 
 
1 
Critical infrastructure 
Continue our transformation from coal to biomass generation 
 
 
 
2 
World leading biomass technology 
Continue to develop our expertise and technology in the sourcing, 
manufacture, transportation and combustion of compressed wood 
pellets 
 
 
 
3 
Improve operational efficiency  
Laser sharp focus on controlling and where possible reducing 
operating costs whilst seeking continual operational improvements 
 
 
 
4 
Grow revenues and improve margins 
Across the Group focus on areas where we can exploit our 
differentiation and unique capabilities to create value, being agile 
and flexible to develop new markets 
 
 
 
5 
Develop new markets 
Use the expertise, knowledge and talents of our people across all 
geographies to identify and develop activities in new and existing 
markets, with a focus on diversifying risk 
Commodities 
As I have already stated, commodity markets have been challenging, driving the price of power to some of the lowest 
levels in the last 15 years. Unlike in previous cycles this fall was not offset by the drop in the price of coal, with dark green 
spreads being very weak. Our teams were incredibly proactive in limiting our exposure to volatility in the commodities 
markets and were able to limit the negative impact on earnings. 
The year in question was one of the windiest in the last 20 years, which, when combined with increased wind generating 
capacity, led to an oversupply of Renewable Obligation Certificates (“ROCs”). This will continue into 2016 but we are 
pleased to note that the UK government has taken action to address this for future years. 
Regulation 
Energy is a complex industry; the challenge of addressing climate change even more so. Both require effective policies 
that help meet the world’s energy needs while significantly reducing carbon emissions. The need to tackle security of 
supply also requires effective policies to encourage long term investment in a diverse range of technologies. And above 
all, industry needs stability and surety so that it can secure shareholder support for long term investment decisions. 
This has been a difficult transitional year for the renewable industry. As one of the UK’s largest generators of renewable 
energy we have been impacted more than most, but it is important to stress that the UK government remains committed 
to, and supportive of, the current role of biomass. 
Strong operational performance from our business units 
Each business unit has performed strongly during the year, as described below. 
Drax Power 
Excellent availability and reliability throughout the year meant that once again our power station was able to prove its 
worth, providing flexible generation output and balancing services in support of system stability and security. As the 
amount of intermittency steadily increases we expect these services to become ever more valuable to the grid. 
It was a record year for planned outages, with four taking place, including the successful completion of our first major 
overhaul of an upgraded biomass unit. 
For the first time since the beginning of the last decade our coal units have started to two-shift, by which we mean they do 
not run in a continual, base load manner. We recognise that this is the future for these units, and our ability to respond in 
an ever more flexible way will help us better support the grid and, in being able to play a more active role in the prompt 
market, create incremental shareholder value. 
 
Our use of non-standard sources of coal increased significantly over the year to 503kt (2014: 257kt). An example is the 
use of coal residues recovered from former coal mines as clean-up operations take place. As well as providing a useful 
outlet for these residues and ensuring they do not end up in landfill, they are exempt from carbon tax. We expect to 
continue use of these fuel types in 2016. 
Haven 
Haven achieved a record 13.8TWh of sales (2014: 11.8TWh). Our customer proposition remains compelling as does our 
ability to deliver a service that consistently exceeds expectations. This means that we have one of the best renewal rates 
in the industry. Over the period we were delighted to welcome Thames Water as a new customer (further demonstrating 
our strength in the utilities market), as well as many others. 
The link between record sales and strong customer retention is people – at its core Haven is a people business. Our 
customers have named account managers; they deal with real people who take their business seriously. Our service is 
second to none. 
In previous years I made it very clear that scale and therefore growth was our primary objective for Haven. This growth 
has delivered cash into the Group. In future years we will shift our focus to creating new sources of value. 
The removal of the CCL exemption had a significant negative impact on the business, yet Haven was the first in the 
market to respond with a new product – Biomass Renewable Electricity. The market for renewable power is evolving but 
our renewable product has already been well received by some of our customers. As the only product to guarantee 100% 
renewable energy, 100% of the time, it is the strongest renewable offering currently available to business users. 
In these uncertain economic times firms have to prioritise stretched resources. Many have clear, long-standing 
commitments to purchase and use only renewable electricity and we hope that despite the removal of the CCL exemption 
they will continue to live up to both the spirit and letter of their public commitments. Certainly we have been pleased to 
work with many of our customers, such as Santander, in this regard. 
Drax Biomass 
This year was a milestone for Drax Biomass, as our port facility became operational in April, followed closely by our 
manufacturing facilities in June and July. I am pleased with the performance of our new US business and I am 
encouraged by the potential for new business opportunities in the US, spurred on by the implementation of President 
Obama’s Clean Power Plan amongst other external developments. 
Outlook 
This was a tough year for Drax and 2016 will be equally challenging. Your senior management team took decisive action 
to ameliorate the impacts of events outside of our direct control and will continue to do so. 
We have developed and have already begun to implement a robust plan to identify and create incremental shareholder 
value. Core to this will be moving our power station from not only being a reliable and consistent generator to one that, in 
a new age of low commodity prices, is also dynamic and agile. The plan addresses three specific areas: a laser sharp 
focus on cost control including capital expenditure; revenue optimisation (especially in changing the way we manage our 
coal units to provide system support to the grid) and downstream development of the retail renewable power market. At 
the same time we continue to evaluate a range of longer-term strategic options. 
Drax is a world leader in biomass technology – not just in our ability to upgrade existing plant, but also in how to source, 
process and improve its use as a fuel. We will continue to search for opportunities to create value from this expertise in 
the UK, US and elsewhere. In the UK this means we will continue to play a critical role in the transition away from coal 
and in further decarbonisation. More biomass conversions are the means by which this can be achieved quickly, safely 
and most importantly of all, at the fairest price to the tax/bill payer. We will continue to work closely with government to 
make the case for further unit conversions. 
 
 
Group financial review 
2015 was a difficult year for all of our businesses. We have seen the lowest market power prices for many years, weather 
conditions in the US south have not been ideal for pellet manufacturing and we continue to see rising third party costs for 
power retail. 
Furthermore, the Government’s announcement of the cessation of the Climate Change Levy (CCL) exemption for 
renewable power in July removed £30 million of renewable support from our 2015 earnings and up to a further £60 million 
in 2016. 
However, we have successfully taken actions to minimise the impact of these uncontrollable events on our financial 
results without compromising our operational capacity. Furthermore, matters within our control have gone well. 
We have capitalised on the flexibility of our generation assets to capture value in the prompt power markets and have 
managed to add incremental margin through enhancements in our fuel sourcing activities. 
In our Retail operations, we delivered another year of record sales in a very competitive marketplace. In Biomass Supply, 
we have a strong team in place and are making good progress optimising our pellet production operations. 
Our EBITDA for 2015 was £169 million, £60 million lower than 2014 but only slightly behind our expectations at the start 
of the year, in spite of the numerous challenges faced. Underlying earnings of £46 million drive a total dividend of 6 pence 
per share. 
Alongside this creditable financial performance, we achieved our long-stated aim of becoming a predominantly biomass-
fuelled generator on time and on budget, with a third unit coming on line as an enhanced co-fired unit in July. Upstream, in 
the US, both our pellet plant and port assets were successfully commissioned at a total cost within initial projections. 
I am confident we have a strong team, sound business model and robust balance sheet to capitalise on future 
opportunities for growth should they arise. At the same time, we are prepared for a variety of eventualities in an ever-
changing and challenging environment. 
Financial performance 
Gross Margin Performance 
Consolidated gross margin of £409 million (2014: £450 million) principally reflects another year of strong operations at 
Drax Power, our generation business. 
As described above, commodity markets have been challenging in 2015 and we experienced lower profitability than in 
previous years as a result. 
Our margins were further reduced from July onwards, following the removal of the CCL exemption, which removed a 
source of renewable subsidy for our Generation business and prompted a review of product offerings in our Retail 
business. 
Despite these challenges, the factors within our control have gone well. Within Drax Power we delivered excellent 
availability and reliability and successfully implemented a two-shift regime on our coal units to maximise the available 
returns. 
Supplementing this, Haven Power delivered another year of strong growth (13.8TWh compared to 11.8TWh in 2014) and 
our US pellet plants and port facility became operational during the year to make a small gross margin contribution. 
Looking forward we are focused on improving retail margins and extracting value from the flexibility of our generation 
plant. 
Operating Costs 
Consolidated operating costs of £240 million (2014: £220 million) have increased by £20 million from the previous year. 
2015 saw the commencement of commercial operations within our US business following the commissioning of both pellet 
plants and the port facility. As a result, the operating costs of the Biomass Supply operation increased 177% to £24 
million. 
The remaining increase in our operating costs year-on-year reflects the very busy outage schedule at Drax Power, 
including the modifications required to enable our third biomass unit to operate on an enhanced co-fired basis and the 
write off of certain maintenance spare parts that are now obsolete as a result. 
 
Looking ahead we are very focused on cost control and have already taken action to reduce our cost base for 2016 and 
beyond. This will be achieved by constantly driving efficiency throughout the business. 
EBITDA 
Consolidated EBITDA of £169 million (2014: £229 million) is £60 million lower than the previous year. 
EBITDA is a function of the movements in gross margin and operating costs described above, and is the key measure we 
use to appraise our financial performance. 
Underlying Earnings 
Underlying earnings measures our overall financial performance. It is calculated as our net profit (in accordance with 
international financial reporting standards) adjusted to exclude any unrealised gains or losses (such as those arising from 
the application of fair value accounting to our forward purchase and sale contracts as required by IFRS), one-off 
transactions that do not reflect the ongoing performance of the business, and the associated tax effect of both. 
Underlying earnings of £46 million in 2015 (2014: £96 million) reflect the lower EBITDA described above and higher 
depreciation charges, as a result of our investments in biomass technology over the last three years, partially offset by the 
positive accounting effect of reductions in future corporation tax rates announced in the Summer Budget statement. 
Financial Instruments 
A key component of the Group’s risk management strategy is the use of forward contracts to secure and de-risk the future 
cash flows of the business. 
We recognised unrealised gains of £124 million (2014: £66 million) within the income statement, below EBITDA and 
excluded from underlying earnings, in respect of outstanding contracts for future delivery. This predominantly reflects the 
impact of strengthening of the US dollar versus Sterling on the value of our portfolio of foreign currency exchange 
contracts. 
Financial position 
Capital Expenditure 
Capital expenditure of £174 million, reduced from £201 million in 2014, reflects continued investment in biomass 
technology, both in developing our biomass pellet plants in the US and bringing a third unit on line at Drax Power Station 
as an enhanced co-fired biomass unit. 
We have also installed Selective Non-Catalytic Reduction (SNCR) technology on four of our generating units this year, at 
a cost of £33 million, in preparation for the requirements of the Industrial Emissions Directive (IED) which come into force 
from 2016. 
Total spend on our biomass transformation project, since we embarked on this strategy in 2012 (which includes the cost 
of IED compliance work) remains in line with original estimates at £640 million, with a relatively low level of expenditure 
expected in 2016-17 to conclude the conversion of the third unit and IED work. 
Asset Obsolescence Charges 
As we reach the conclusion of our biomass transformation plans, certain assets previously utilised in our coal generation 
operations at the power station are no longer required, predominantly comprised of flue-gas desulphurisation (FGD) plant. 
The emissions characteristics of converted biomass units are such that FGD is not needed on these units. 
Total income statement charges in respect of these assets were £109 million, which as one-off charges are not reflective 
of the underlying performance of the Group, have been excluded from underlying earnings and, thus, distributions. 
Cash Generated from Operations 
Cash generated from operations amounted to £167 million in 2015, a £40 million increase on the previous year, in part 
demonstrating the benefit of self-help actions. 
Despite the reduction in profitability year on year our focus on efficient working capital management, including a controlled 
run-down of coal stocks, helped to release £95 million of cash, compared to an £84 million outflow in 2014. 
This significant improvement was offset by an £86 million increase in our ROC assets (2014: £45 million) as our output 
from biomass-fired generation increased. Cash from ROCs is typically realised several months after the ROC is earned, 
 
driven by RO deadlines and commercial considerations. We have facilities in place to monetise a proportion of these 
assets and continue to explore options to accelerate these cash flows. 
The overall net cash outflow for the year is £47 million (2014: net outflow of £86 million) and includes capital investments 
of £179 million (2014: £200 million) which is falling as we approach the end of our biomass transformation, and dividend 
payments of £50 million (2014: £55 million). 
Net Debt & Funding 
Net debt at 31 December 2015 is £187 million, compared to £99 million at the end of 2014, reflecting the cash outflow of 
£47 million described above and a reduction in short-term investments of £40 million. 
Our primary funding platform has remained steady compared to the previous year, with £325 million of term loans drawn 
down. A small increase in borrowings reflects the unwinding of discounting on our index-linked facilities. The maturity 
profile of our loans extends to 2024. 
In December 2015 we successfully concluded the refinancing of our revolving credit facility. The new £400 million facility 
matures in December 2019 and has a margin of 175 basis points over LIBOR. It replaces the existing £400 million facility 
which was due to mature in April 2017 and had a margin of 225 basis points over LIBOR. 
Our funding package also includes a commodity trading line, also successfully renewed in December, which enables us to 
transact prescribed volumes of commodity trades without having to post collateral. 
Other information 
Taxation 
The 2015 tax charge of £3 million compares to a £37 million tax charge in 2014. The reduction principally reflects the 
reduction in profit before tax in 2015 versus 2014, and an £18 million impact of a 2% reduction in corporation tax rates. 
The underlying effective rate of tax of (9)% (excluding the post-tax impact of unrealised gains on derivatives contracts and 
one-off asset obsolescence charges, as described above) is less than the standard rate of corporation tax in the UK, the 
difference arising predominantly from the impact of the corporation tax rate changes described above. The comparable 
underlying rate in 2014 was 20%, which was more aligned with the UK standard rate of tax. 
Cash taxes paid during the year were £6 million (2014: £16 million), principally reflecting lower underlying profit before tax. 
These payments were offset by tax refunds in settlement of prior years, bringing net taxes paid in 2015 to £4 million 
(2014: £14 million). 
Acquisition of Billington Bioenergy 
In March 2015 we welcomed Billington Bioenergy, the second largest operator in the UK’s biomass heat market, to the 
Group. Consideration totaled £4 million paid in cash. 
We are confident that the acquisition represents a good strategic fit for Drax. It is a natural extension to our core biomass 
business and a small but clear opportunity to more fully utilise our status as the world leader in biomass technology. 
We are pleased with the performance at Billington in the short time it has been part of the Group, with total wood pellet 
deliveries of 21kt in the year, and turnover of £5 million. 
Long-term Value 
We remain confident in the long term strategic value of the Group to the UK energy sector and accordingly believe there 
are many opportunities to deliver longer-term value for our shareholders. 
2015 was characterised by low commodity markets and, significantly for Drax, the decision by the Government to remove 
the CCL exemption for power generated from renewable sources, from August. 
As a result of these two factors our share price has declined substantially during the year to the extent that our market 
capitalisation fell materially below the book value of our assets. Accordingly, we have undertaken a comprehensive and 
wide-ranging review of the value of our business, to ensure those assets are not impaired. 
The review, which is further detailed in note 3, reinforced our view that the Group is well placed to deliver future value and 
that the carrying value of our assets remains appropriate. 
 
Looking forward, we expect 2016 to be characterised by continuing challenging commodity markets and, as set out in the 
Chief Executive’s Review, we are meeting the challenge head-on with a firm focus on revenue development and cost 
control, whilst awaiting the outcome of the EU investigation into the award of a CfD for our third biomass conversion. 
Distributions 
We remain committed to our policy of distributing 50% of underlying earnings in each year. Underlying earnings for the 
year ended 31 December 2015 were £46 million (2014: £96 million). 
A full reconciliation of net profit, calculated in accordance with IFRS, to underlying earnings is provided within note 6. 
On 17 February 2015 the Board resolved, subject to approval by shareholders at the Annual General Meeting on 22 April 
2015, to pay a final dividend for the year ended 31 December 2014 of 7.2 pence per share (£29 million). The final 
dividend was subsequently paid on 15 May 2015. 
On 27 July 2015, the Board resolved to pay an interim dividend for the six months ending 30 June 2015 of 5.1 pence per 
share (£21 million), representing 50% of underlying earnings for the period. The interim dividend was paid on 9 October 
2015. 
At the forthcoming AGM the Board will recommend to shareholders that a resolution is passed to approve payment of a 
final dividend for the year ended 31 December 2015 of 0.6 pence per share (£2 million), payable on or before 13 May 
2016. 
Shares will be marked ex-dividend on 22 April 2016. 
 
 
 
Viability Statement 
In accordance with provision C.2.2 of the 2014 version of the UK Corporate Governance Code, the directors have 
assessed the prospects of the Group over a period significantly longer than the 12 months required by the going concern 
provision. 
In preparing this assessment of viability the Board has considered the principal risks faced by the Group, relevant financial 
forecasts and sensitivities, the availability of adequate funding and the strength of the Group’s control environment. 
Assessment period 
The Board conducted this assessment over a period of three years, which was selected for the following reasons: 
– 
The Group’s Business Plan (the “Plan”), which is reviewed and assessed on a quarterly basis and is used for 
strategic decision making, includes a range of financial forecasts and associated sensitivity analysis. This Plan 
covers a three-year period in detail.  
– 
Within the three year period liquid commodity market curves are used for valuations. Typically these curves cover a 
two year window and beyond this horizon, given the lack of forward liquidity in power markets, commodity price 
assumptions are derived using publically available information and the Group’s own estimates.  
– 
The majority of the Group’s financing facilities are available beyond the three year horizon.  
In selecting this period the Board have assumed no material changes to the Group’s mid-term regulatory environment and 
associated support regimes. This includes revenues from ROCs and CfD and the access of coal-generated electricity to 
the UK’s grid. 
Review of principal risks 
The Group’s principal risks and uncertainties, have been considered over the period. The Board considers that 
Commodity Market risk has the most influence upon the continued viability of the Group. A material downturn in 
commodity prices, adversely impacting spreads, could place stress upon the ability of the Group to meet its liabilities as 
they fall due. The prospects of the Group are also strongly influenced by government policy in relation to subsidies 
available for generation of renewable power. Failure to secure and retain sufficient subsidies could have a material impact 
on the viability of the Group. 
The principal risks have been valued, where possible, to assess the potential impact of each on the viability of the Group, 
should that risk arise in its unmitigated form. The valuations have been included, where appropriate, as sensitivities to the 
Plan and considered by the Board as part of the approval process required before the Plan is adopted by the Group. 
Review of financial forecasts 
The Plan considers the Group’s financial position, performance, cash flows, covenant compliance and other key financial 
ratios over the period and was most recently updated to reflect current market and environment conditions in December 
2015. 
The Plan includes certain assumptions, the most material of which relate to commodity market price curves and levels of 
subsidy support available to the Group through the generation of biomass-backed renewable power. The Group continues 
to await the outcome of a state aid review by the European Union of a Contract for Difference, providing a strike price for 
the sale of renewable power. The outcome of this review is expected during 2016 and the Plan includes an assumption 
that State aid clearance will be obtained during the year. 
The Plan is also subject to stress testing, which involves the construction of reasonably foreseeable scenarios, including 
those aligned to the principal risks, which test the robustness of the Plan when key variables are flexed both individually 
and in unison. Where such a scenario suggests a risk to viability, the availability and quantum of mitigating actions is 
considered. 
The Board considers the most significant scenario in the assessment period to be a combination of a failure to secure 
State aid clearance for the CfD during 2016 and a deterioration of commodity market prices, leading to a fall in the 
available price for power and thus a fall in the margins available to the Group from its power generation activities. This has 
been considered in the Plan and the Board is satisfied that in such a scenario sufficient actions could be taken to preserve 
the viability of the Group. 
 
 
 
Availability of adequate funding 
The sources of funding available to the Group are set out in note 10. The Board expects these sources, along with cash 
flows generated by the Group from its normal operations, to provide adequate levels of funding to support the execution of 
the Group’s Plan over the three-year period. 
Expectations 
The directors have considered all the factors in their assessment of viability over the next three years, including the latest 
Plan, scenario analysis, levels of funding, control environment and the principal risks and uncertainties facing the Group. 
The directors have also considered the availability of actions within their control in the event of plausible negative 
scenarios occurring. They have a reasonable expectation that the Group will be able to continue in operation and meet its 
liabilities as they fall due over the three-year period of their assessment.

Principal risks and uncertainties 
Principal risks and uncertainties 
The Group has a comprehensive system of governance controls in place to manage risks. Policies have been established 
in key areas of the business such as biomass sustainability, trading, treasury, production and health and safety to ensure 
that these risks are managed in a controlled manner and in accordance with the policies set by the Board. 
Internal control and risk management 
The Board is responsible for the Group’s system of internal control and for reviewing its effectiveness. A process has 
been established for identifying, evaluating, determining risk appetite and managing the significant risks faced by the 
Group and this has been in place for the year under review up to the date of approval of the 2015 Annual report and 
accounts. 
The process is designed to manage rather than eliminate the risk of failure to achieve business objectives, and can only 
provide reasonable, not absolute, assurance against material misstatement or loss. 
Risk management committees 
There are seven business risk management committees (RMCs): 
1 
Group corporate services risk management committee 
2 
Drax Power safety, health, environmental and production integrity committee 
3 
Drax Power currency and commodity risk management committee 
4 
Drax Power corporate services risk management committee 
5 
Haven Power risk management committee 
6 
Drax Biomass risk management committee 
7 
Billington Bioenergy risk management committee 
Each Committee is responsible for ensuring that all risks associated with its specific area of the business are identified, 
analysed and managed systematically and appropriately. Each Committee has terms of reference that require systems 
and controls to be approved, implemented and monitored in order to ensure that activities are commensurate with the risk 
appetite established by the Board, are adequately resourced and comply with applicable legal and regulatory 
requirements. 
Risks identified and managed by the RMCs are regularly reviewed at the Executive Committee of the Group, as well as by 
the Drax Group plc Board. 
Risk management process 
The key elements of the risk management process are as follows: 
Risk identification – risks faced by the Group are identified during the formulation of the Business Plan. Senior 
management and risk owners, with the assistance of the risk management committees, periodically review the risks to 
ensure that the risk management processes and controls in their area are appropriate and effective, and that new risks 
are identified. A top down risk review is conducted at least annually. 
Risk analysis – the basic causes of each risk are considered, and the impact and likelihood of it materialising is assessed. 
Risk registers are used to document the risks identified, level of severity and probability, ownership and mitigation 
measures for each risk. The risk registers are reviewed by the risk management committees on at least a quarterly basis. 
Risks are then logged with reference to impact and probability. 
Risk appetite is identified by reference to the same criteria. The analysis enables decisions to be taken as to how that risk 
should be managed by applying mitigation measures to align the risk with the identified risk appetite. 
 
 
 
Risk monitoring and assurance – the Board is ultimately responsible for this system of risk management and internal 
control. The Audit Committee reviews the suitability and effectiveness of risk management processes and controls on 
behalf of the Board. Risk management committees assist the executive directors in the operation and implementation of 
the risk management process, and provide a source of assurance to the Audit Committee that the process is operating 
effectively. Each risk committee reports to the Board at least annually. 
Internal control 
In addition, the Group has a comprehensive and well-defined internal control system with clear structures, delegated 
authority levels and accountabilities. 
The Group has a system of planning and monitoring, which incorporates Board approval of a rolling five-year Business 
Plan and approval of operating and capital expenditure budgets. Performance against the budget is subsequently 
monitored and reported to the Board on a monthly basis. The Board also monitors overall Group performance against a 
Scorecard which shows progress against a set of financial, operating, safety and other targets set at the start of the year. 
Performance is reported formally to shareholders through the publication of Group results. Operational management 
makes frequent reports on performance to the executive directors. 
The Group also has processes in place for business continuity and emergency planning. 
Through the Audit Committee, the Board has implemented a programme of internal audit reviews of different aspects of 
the Group’s activities. The programme, which is reviewed and updated annually, is designed so that, over time, all facets 
of the business are reviewed to ensure appropriate systems of control are in place and are working effectively or, where 
they are not, deficiencies are rectified by timely and appropriate action. In agreeing the actions to be taken in response to 
each report, the aim is always to embed internal controls, including measures intended effectively to identify and manage 
risk, within each area of the Group’s operations. In parallel with its work in relation to internal audit, the Audit Committee 
also satisfies itself that an action plan, for dealing with points raised by the external auditor in their yearly management 
letter is being properly addressed by management. 
With the assistance of the Audit Committee, the Board has reviewed the effectiveness of the system of internal control. It 
has reviewed the reports of the Audit Committee, which has considered all significant aspects of internal control including 
financial, operational, trading, compliance, social, environmental and ethical risks in accordance with the “Internal Control: 
Guidance for Directors on the UK Corporate Governance Code”. 
Following its review, the Board determined that it was not aware of any significant deficiency or material weakness in the 
system of internal control. 
Change in risk profile 
There are five principal risks monitored by the Board; Regulatory and Political risk, Biomass risks, Generating Plant 
Operating risk, Trading and Commodity risk and Corporate risks. 
During 2015, the perceived level of risk arising from three of these principal risks (Regulatory/Political, Biomass and 
Trading/ Commodity) increased, with the other two remaining constant. Further details and the changes in 2015 driving 
this assessment are set out below. 
 
Regulatory and Political Risk 
  
 
 
Context 
 
The energy sector is subject to 
detailed legislation and regulation.

Biomass Risks 
 
 
Context 
 
The biomass market is still 
relatively new, the supply chain 
requires further investment and 
public understanding of the 
benefits of the technology need to 
be improved 
 
Risk 
 
– 
Detractors and eNGOs 
operate in concert to try and 
influence policy makers 
against future biomass 
conversions  
 
– 
We may fail to secure 
sufficient sustainable biomass 
due to the lack of new 
suppliers entering the market, 
financial failure of existing 
suppliers and / or increased 
competition for supply  
 
– 
Most of the sustainable 
biomass that we can procure is 
priced in foreign currency 
which increases our exposure 
to fluctuations against sterling 
and poses a risk to profitability

Generating Plant Operating Risk  
 
Context 
 
The reliability of our generating 
plant is central to our ability to 
create value for the Group. There 
are inherent health and safety risks 
in our operations which make our 
strong safety standards and culture 
critically important. Compliance 
with laws and regulations could 
impact the cost of operation. 
 
Risk 
 
– 
Single point failures on the 
plant could result in forced 
outages, impacting financial 
results and / or health and 
safety  
 
– 
As we progress with our 
biomass unit conversions, we 
are exposed to new and 
emerging technical risks which 
could result in higher than 
forecast outage levels 
 
Mitigations 
 
–

Changes in factors impacting 
risk in 2015 
 
– 
Low commodity prices have 
led to a reduction in load 
factor, with coal units 
operating only in peak 
periods. This places pressure 
on the units and can lead to 
higher forced outage rates

Trading and Commodity Risk 
 
 
Context 
 
The margins of our generation 
business are influenced by 
commodity market movements, 
primarily gas prices which drive 
power prices, and are inherently 
volatile. The increasing level of our 
renewables generation exposes us 
to risk in relation to the ROC 
market. 
 
Risk 
 
– 
Fluctuations in commodity 
prices, particularly gas and 
power could lead to low bark 
and / or dark green spreads 
resulting in lower margins in 
our generation business and a 
reduction in cash flow  
 
– 
Value of ROCs generated may 
be lower than forecast if the 
recycle value outturns below 
DECC’s projections due to 
higher than anticipated 
renewable generation on the 
grid 
 
Mitigations 
 
– 
Hedging strategy to sell 
forward bark spread where it is 
economic to do so 
 
– 
State aid process for CfD in 
progress, which if approved 
would remove the income 
volatility associated with that 
unit

– 
Haven Power sales volumes 
continue to grow and offer a 
partial hedge to falling 
wholesale power prices  
 
– 
DECC has increased 
assumptions around wind

Corporate Risks 
 
 
Context 
 
The Group depends on its ability to 
fund ongoing operations. Drax is 
reliant on a number of key IT 
systems to support operations and 
cash flow. 
 
Risk 
 
– 
An inability to raise funds to 
finance the on-going business 
and remain compliant with 
banking covenants could lead 
to a covenant breach, loan 
default or credit rating 
downgrade  
 
– 
If the Haven Power billing 
system is unavailable for 
material invoicing, this could 
have a material impact upon 
cash flow

Directors’ responsibilities statement 
The directors are responsible for preparing the Annual report and the financial statements in accordance with applicable 
law and regulations. 
Company law requires the directors to prepare financial statements for each financial year. Under that law the directors 
are required to prepare the Group financial statements in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards 
(IFRSs) as adopted by the European Union and Article 4 of the IAS Regulation and have elected to prepare the Parent 
Company financial statements in accordance with United Kingdom Generally Accepted Accounting Practice (United 
Kingdom Accounting Standards and applicable law), set out in FRS 101 “Reduced Disclosure Framework”. Under 
company law the directors must not approve the accounts unless they are satisfied that they give a true and fair view of 
the state of affairs of the Company and of the profit or loss of the Company for that period. 
In preparing the Parent Company financial statements, the directors are required to: 
– 
select suitable accounting policies and then apply them consistently;  
– 
make judgements and accounting estimates that are reasonable and prudent;  
– 
state whether applicable UK Accounting Standards have been followed, subject to any material departures 
disclosed and explained in the financial statements; and  
– 
prepare the financial statements on the going concern basis unless it is inappropriate to presume that the Company 
will continue in business.  
In preparing the Group financial statements, International Accounting Standard 1 requires that directors: 
– 
properly select and apply accounting policies;  
– 
present information, including accounting policies, in a manner that provides relevant, reliable, comparable and 
understandable information;  
– 
provide additional disclosures when compliance with the specific requirements in IFRSs are insufficient to enable 
users to understand the impact of particular transactions, other events and conditions on the entity’s financial 
position and financial performance; and  
– 
make an assessment of the Company’s ability to continue as a going concern.  
The directors are responsible for keeping adequate accounting records that are sufficient to show and explain the 
Company’s transactions and disclose with reasonable accuracy at any time the financial position of the Company and 
enable them to ensure that the financial statements comply with the Companies Act 2006. They are also responsible for 
safeguarding the assets of the Company and hence for taking reasonable steps for the prevention and detection of fraud 
and other irregularities. 
The directors are responsible for the maintenance and integrity of the corporate and financial information included on the 
Company’s website. Legislation in the United Kingdom governing the preparation and dissemination of financial 
statements may differ from legislation in other jurisdictions. 
Responsibility statement 
We confirm that to the best of our knowledge: 
– 
the financial statements, prepared in accordance with the relevant financial reporting framework, give a true and fair 
view of the assets, liabilities, financial position and profit or loss of the Company and the undertakings included in 
the consolidation taken as a whole;  
– 
the Strategic report includes a fair review of the development and performance of the business and the position of 
the Company and the undertakings included in the consolidation taken as a whole, together with a description of the 
principal risks and uncertainties that they face; and  
– 
the annual report and financial statements, taken as a whole, are fair, balanced and understandable and provide the 
information necessary for shareholders to assess the Company’s performance, business model and strategy.  
This responsibility statement was approved by the Board of directors on 22 February 2016 and is signed on its behalf by:

1. General information and basis of preparation 
The consolidated financial information for Drax Group plc (the "Company") and its subsidiaries (together "the Group") set 
out in this preliminary announcement has been derived from the audited consolidated financial statements of the Group 
for the year ended 31 December 2015 (the "financial statements").  
This preliminary announcement does not constitute the full financial statements prepared in accordance with International 
Financial Reporting Standards ("IFRSs"). The financial statements were approved by the Board of directors on 22 
February 2016. Statutory accounts for 2014 have been delivered to the Registrar of Companies and those for 2015 will be 
delivered in due course.  
The report of the auditors on the financial statements was unqualified, did not draw attention to any matters by way of 
emphasis without qualifying their report, and did not contain a statement under Section 498 (2) or (3) of the Companies 
Act 2006 or equivalent preceding legislation.  
The financial statements have been prepared in accordance with IFRSs adopted by the European Union and therefore the 
consolidated financial statements comply with Article 4 of the EU IAS Regulations.  
The financial statements have been prepared on a going concern basis, and on the historical cost basis, except for certain 
financial assets and liabilities that have been measured at fair value.  
The principal accounting policies adopted in the preparation of these financial statements are set in the 2015 Annual 
report and accounts. These policies have been consistently applied to both years presented. 
2. Segmental reporting 
On 1 March 2015 the Group reorganised into three businesses with a dedicated management team for each; Generation: 
the generation of electricity at Drax Power Station; Biomass Supply: production of sustainable compressed wood pellets 
at our processing facilities in the US; and Retail: the supply of power to business customers and wood pellets to the 
domestic heat market. Each business is an operating segment for the purpose of segmental reporting. Following the 
reorganisation, information reported to the Board for the purposes of assessing performance and making investment 
decisions is organised into these three operating segments. The measure of profit or loss for each reportable segment 
presented to the Board on a regular basis is EBITDA. 
Operating costs are allocated to segments to the extent they are directly attributable to the activities of that segment. 
Unallocated costs are included within central operating costs. 
Prior period comparatives have been restated to the extent the information is available. Costs were entirely allocated to 
segments in previous periods.

Adjustments represent the elimination of intra-group transactions.  
Assets and working capital are monitored on a Group basis, with no separate disclosure of asset by segment made in the 
management accounts. However, spend on key capital projects is monitored. Total spend on the biomass transformation 
project during 2015 was £90 million (2014: £125 million), of which £22 million (2014: £85 million) relates to construction of 
assets within the Biomass Supply segment. 
The accounting policies of the reportable segments are the same as the Group’s accounting policies. The revenue and 
results of all of our reporting segments are subject to seasonality with higher despatch and prices in the winter months, 
compared to summer months. 
 
Intra-group trading 
Intra-group transactions are carried out on arms-length, commercial terms that where possible equate to market prices at 
the time of the transaction. During 2015, the Biomass Supply segment sold wood pellets with a total value of £28.4 million 
(2014: £nil) to the Generation segment and the Generation segment sold power, ROCs and LECs with a total value of 
£863.2 million (2014: £735.2 million) to the Retail segment. 
The impact of all intra-group transactions, including any unrealised profit arising (£1.6 million at 31 December 2015), is 
eliminated on consolidation. 
Major customers 
Total revenue for the year ended 31 December 2015 includes amounts of £597.7 million and £468.0 million (2014: £320.6 
million and £288.7 million) derived from two customers (2014: two customers), each representing 10% or more of the 
Group’s revenue for the year. These revenues arose in the Generation segment. 
3. Impairment review and asset obsolescence charges 
Accounting policy 
The Group reviews its fixed assets (or, where appropriate, groups of assets known as cash-generating units) whenever 
there is an indication that an impairment loss may have been suffered. The Group considers the smallest collections of 
assets that generate independent cash flows to be its operating entities (Drax Power, Haven Power, Drax Biomass and 
Billington Bioenergy) and accordingly considers the Group to be comprised of four cash-generating units (“CGUs”). 
 
Whilst IFRS requires estimates of future cash flows to be discounted using a pre-tax rate, market rates are generally more 
widely available on a post-tax basis. In utilising a post-tax discount rate, the Group takes account of its specific tax 
characteristics to ensure the impairment calculations are not affected. 
If an indication of potential impairment exists, the recoverable amount of the asset or CGU in question is assessed with 
reference to the present value of the future cash flows expected to be derived from the continuing use of the asset or 
cash-generating unit (“value in use”) or the expected price that would be received to sell the asset to another market 
participant (“fair value”). 
If the recoverable amount is less than the current carrying amount within the financial statements, a provision is made to 
reduce the carrying amount of the asset or cash-generating unit to the estimated recoverable amount. Impairment losses 
are recognised immediately within the income statement. 
Goodwill balances are assessed for impairment annually. Impairment charges, as one-off items that are typically not 
reflective of the underlying performance of the Group in a given period, are excluded from underlying earnings (see note 
6). 
Critical judgement areas 
During 2015, weak commodity markets and the removal of LEC income for the Generation business contributed to a 
substantial and sustained reduction in the Group’s share price. As a result, the market capitalisation of the Group fell 
materially below the carrying value of the Group’s net assets, an indicator of possible impairment. Accordingly a full 
impairment review was undertaken at the balance sheet date. 
The assessment of the present value of future cash flows on which such a review is based is dependent upon a number 
of assumptions. In particular, expected future cash flows are based upon management’s reasonable estimates of future 
prices, output, costs and economic support for renewable energy generation. 
The impairment methodology, calculations and the supporting assumptions were reviewed by the Audit Committee. The 
key assumptions were benchmarked and calculation methodology assessed by an independent expert with relevant 
industry experience. The most critical of these assumptions are discussed below. 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Impairment review 
The value in use of the Drax Power CGU was tested using a broad range of assumptions, including the expected 
economic life of its six power generating units, their fuel type and the regulatory regime under which they might operate. 
This included key assumptions that each generating unit will be available for operation until 2039 (consistent with the 
estimated asset life of the Drax power station), that the outcome of the ongoing EU State aid investigation into the CfD for 
the third unit conversion would be favourable with a strike price consistent with the initial decision published in January 
2015 (£100/MWh) and that, where required to support future renewable generation upon expiry of the current support 
mechanisms in 2027, a suitable level of economic incentive would be available to maintain commercially acceptable 
returns. 
When making these assumptions the enhancement value available from converting three of the generating units from 
their current coal fuel source to biomass was not included in the value in use results. As a result, the majority of the 
CGU’s longer term revenues are delivered by the biomass units. 
Where available, estimates of future prices were based on signed contracts for purchases and sales with third parties. 
Transactions beyond contracted positions were valued using forward price curves and, beyond the liquid portion of 
observable market curves, these were constructed internally. A benchmarking exercise confirmed that management’s 
constructed curves were in line with market consensus. 
The calculations were discounted using a post-tax nominal rate of 8%. This indicated that the recoverable amount of each 
of the Group’s CGUs exceeded its carrying value and therefore that no provisions for impairment were required. 
The calculations for each CGU are sensitive to the key assumptions described above. Material adverse changes to these 
assumptions, particularly a delay in the EU State aid approval process or reduction in strike price for the CfD, the loss of 
existing economic support, the lack of adequate economic support for renewable generation post-2027 or any other 
evidence that the useful lives of assets may be materially shorter than assumed, could result in significant impairment 
charges in future periods. 
Asset obsolescence charges 
Obsolescence charges have been recognised in 2015, in respect of specific assets as described below:

Following an internal review and extensive testing, during 2015 it was concluded that Flue Gas Desulphurisation (FGD) 
technology was no longer required on converted biomass units within the Generation business and the assets were 
decommissioned. The recoverable amount of these assets was determined to be zero and accordingly the full carrying 
amount of £92.6 million has been recognised as an asset obsolescence charge in the year. 
During 2015 we began to install Selective Non-Catalytic Reduction technology across our generating units as part of our 
strategy to ensure compliance with the requirements of the Industrial Emissions Directive. As a result, development costs 
associated with a competing solution were determined to have a recoverable amount of zero, as the project would not be 
progressed. The full carrying amount of £10 million has therefore been recognised as an asset obsolescence charge in 
the year. 
Within the Biomass Supply business, following a decision not to proceed with a third pellet plant project in the US Gulf, the 
recoverable amount of the associated assets was determined to be zero and the full carrying amount of £6.6 million 
recognised as an asset obsolescence charge. 
4. Net finance costs 
Finance costs reflect expenses incurred in managing our debt structure (such as interest payable on our bank loans) as 
well as foreign exchange gains and losses, the unwinding of discounting on provisions for reinstatement of our sites at the 
end of their useful lives and net interest charged on the Group’s defined benefit pension scheme obligation. These are 
offset by interest income that we generate through efficient use of short-term cash surpluses – for example through 
investment in money market funds.

Amortisation of deferred finance costs includes £0.7 million of costs (2014: £nil) relating to the previous revolving credit 
facility for which amortisation was accelerated following the successful renegotiation of a replacement facility in December 
2015 (see note 10 for further details). 
5. Current and deferred taxation 
The tax charge includes both current and deferred tax. Current tax is the estimated amount payable on this year’s taxable 
profits (which are adjusted for items upon which we are not required to pay tax or, in some cases, for items which are not 
allowable for tax purposes and therefore on which we are required to pay additional tax). Deferred tax is an accounting 
adjustment which reflects where more or less tax is expected to arise in the future due to differences between the 
accounting and tax rules (reflected in differences between the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities in the balance 
sheet and the corresponding tax bases used in the computation of taxable profits). The tax charge reflects the estimated 
effective tax rate on profit before tax for the Group for the year ended 31 December 2015 and the movement in the 
deferred tax balance in the year, so far as it relates to items recognised in the income statement. 
Accounting policy 
Current tax, including UK corporation tax and foreign tax, is based on taxable profit for the year in the relevant jurisdiction. 
Taxable profit differs from profit before tax as reported in the income statement because it excludes items income or 
expense that are either taxable or deductible in other years or never taxable/deductible. The Group’s liability (or asset) for 
current tax is provided at amounts expected to be paid (or recovered) using the tax rates and laws that have been 
enacted or substantively enacted by the balance sheet date. 
Deferred tax is the tax expected to be payable or recoverable on differences between the carrying amounts of assets and 
liabilities in the financial statements and the corresponding tax bases used in the computation of taxable profit, and is 
accounted for using the balance sheet liability method. Deferred tax liabilities are generally recognised for all taxable 
temporary differences and deferred tax assets are recognised to the extent that it is probable that taxable profits will be 
available against which deductible temporary differences can be utilized. 
Deferred tax is calculated at the tax rates that are expected to apply in the period when the liability is settled or the asset 
is realised based on tax laws and rates that have been enacted or substantively enacted at the balance sheet date. In the 
Summer Budget 2015, the UK corporation tax main rate has been set by the Finance Act at 19% for the years starting 1 
April 2017, 2018 and 2019 and at 18% for the year starting 1 April 2020. These rates have therefore been reflected in the 
deferred tax balances shown below. 
Current and deferred tax are recognised in profit or loss, except when they relate to items that are recognised in other 
comprehensive income or directly in equity, in which case, the current and deferred tax are also recognised in other 
comprehensive income or directly in equity respectively. 
 
 
 
 
 
Significant judgement areas 
In accounting for taxation the Group makes assumptions regarding the treatment of items of income and expenditure for 
tax purposes. The Group believes that these assumptions are reasonable based on prior experience and consultation with 
advisers. Full provision is made for deferred taxation at the rates of tax prevailing at the period end date unless future 
rates have been substantively enacted. Deferred tax assets are recognised where it is considered more likely than not 
that they will be recovered. Where such assets relate to losses incurred by a business unit, particularly those with a 
history of losses, the Group seeks evidence other than its own internal forecasts to support recognition of the related 
deferred tax asset.

The Group has not recognised deferred tax assets with an estimated value of £19 million at 31 December 2015 (2014: 
£10 million) in respect of UK and US losses that are carried forward against future taxable income. In both cases the 
business units involved have a history of making losses and until sufficient operational performance is established and 
maintained to give suitable confidence in future profitability, taxable income against which to utilise the benefit of the 
accumulated losses is not considered to be probable. 
6. Earnings per share and underlying earnings per share 
Earnings per share (“EPS”) represents the amount of our earnings (post-tax profits) that are attributable to each ordinary 
share we have in issue. Basic EPS is calculated by dividing our earnings by the weighted average number of ordinary 
shares that were in issue during the year. Diluted EPS demonstrates the impact if all outstanding share options (such as 
those to be issued under our employee share schemes), that are currently expected to vest on their future maturity dates, 
were exercised and treated as ordinary shares as at the balance sheet date. 
In addition to EPS, we calculate underlying EPS as it reflects the figures upon which our annual dividends are calculated 
(note 7). Underlying EPS removes the post-tax effect of unrealised gains on derivative contracts, asset obsolescence 
charges and the one-off settlement of CESP in 2014 from earnings. Multiplying underlying basic EPS by 50% will give the 
total dividends per share for the period. 
Reconciliations of the earnings and weighted average number of shares used in the calculations are set out below:

7. Dividends 
Dividends are amounts we return to our shareholders and are paid as an amount per ordinary share held. Our current 
dividend policy is to return 50% of underlying earnings (see note 6) to our shareholders each year. The remaining 50% is 
retained for reinvestment in the business.

8. Retained earnings 
Retained profits are a component of our equity reserves. The overall balance reflects the total profits we have generated

Our financing structure includes £325 million of term loans, comprised of a private placement of £100 million with various 
funds managed by M&G Investments, a £75 million amortising loan facility with Friends Life, underpinned by a guarantee 
from HM Treasury under the Infrastructure UK Guarantee Scheme, a £50 million amortising term loan with Green 
Investment Bank and a £100 million amortising term loan facility with M&G UK Companies Financing Fund. The loans 
have varying maturity profiles ranging from 2017 to 2025. All of the term loans were fully drawn down at 31 December 
2015 and 31 December 2014. 
In December 2015 we successfully refinanced our £400 million revolving credit facility. The new facility matures in 
December 2019 and has a margin of 175 basis points over LIBOR. At 31 December 2015 this facility had been utilised to 
draw down letters of credit with a total value of £37.9 million. 
At the same time we also renewed our commodity trading facility, which allows us to transact prescribed volumes of 
commodity trades without the requirement to post collateral. 
Accounting policy 
The Group measures all debt instruments (whether financial assets or financial liabilities) initially at fair value, which 
equates to the principal value, of the consideration paid or received. Subsequent to initial measurement, debt instruments 
are measured at amortised cost using the effective interest method. Transaction costs (any such costs incremental and 
directly attributable to the issue of the financial instrument) are included in the calculation of the effective interest rate and 
are, amortised through the income statement over the life of the instrument. 
Fees paid on the establishment of loan facilities are recognised as transaction costs of the loan to the extent that it is 
probable that some or all of the facility will be drawn down. Where this is the case, the fee is deferred until the draw-down 
occurs.

Contracts for difference (CfD) 
A mechanism to support investment in low-carbon electricity generation. The CfD works by stabilising revenues for 
generators at a fixed price level known as the “strike price”. Generators will receive revenue from selling their electricity 
into the market as usual. However, when the market reference price is below the strike price they will also receive a top-
up payment from suppliers for the additional amount. Conversely if the reference price is above the strike price, the 
generator must pay back the difference.
