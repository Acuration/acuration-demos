Introduction  
1.1 
Overview 
1.1.1 
This Environmental Report has been prepared on the behalf of Abergelli Power Limited 
(APL) for the gas connection (hereafter referred to as the “Gas Connection”) to the 
proposed Abergelli Power Station from the National Gas Transmission System. The 
location of the Gas Connection can be viewed on Figure 1: Site Location Plan. 
1.1.2 
A screening opinion was submitted pursuant to Regulation 6(1) of the Town and 
Country Planning (Environmental Impact Assessment) (Wales) Regulations 2017 (the 
‘EIA Regulations’) (Ref.1.1) to City and County of Swansea Council (CCS) regarding 
the need for an Environmental Impact Assessment (EIA) for the Gas Connection on the 
15th June 2018.  
1.1.3 
On the 19th July, CCS confirmed that the Gas Connection was not EIA Development, 
and therefore no EIA is required. This Environmental Report therefore provides the 
required detailed Environmental Information to support this Planning Application under 
the Town & Country Planning Act 1990.  
1.2 
Background 
1.2.1 
APL proposes to construct and operate an Open Cycle Gas Turbine (“OCGT”) peaking 
power generating station (the "Power Generation Plant") and new connections to the 
gas and electricity networks on land adjacent to the Felindre Gas Compressor Station 
at Abergelli Farm, Felindre, Swansea SA5 7NN (the “Project”).   
1.2.2 
APL's project is split into three different elements which are described below, which 
together form the "Abergelli Power Project".  These elements are referred to as the 
Power Generation Plant, the Gas Connection, and the Electrical Connection. 
1.2.3 
The three main elements of the Project comprise:  
 
An OCGT peaking power generating station, fuelled by natural gas and capable of 
providing a rated electrical output of up to 299 Megawatts (MW). The Power 
Generation Plant comprises: 
o 
Generating Equipment including one Gas Turbine Generator with one 
exhaust gas flue stack and Balance of Plant (BOP) (together referred to 
as the “Generating Equipment”) which are located within the “Generating 
Equipment Site”; 
o 
An Access Road to the Project Site Boundary from the B4489 which lies 
to the west, formed by upgrading an existing access road between the 
B4489 junction and the Swansea North Substation (the “Substation”) and 
constructing a new section of access road from the Substation to the 
Generating Equipment Site; and 
o 
A temporary construction compound for the storage of materials, plant 
and equipment as well as containing site accommodation and welfare 
facilities, temporary car parking and temporary fencing (the “Laydown 
Area”). A small area within the Laydown Area will be retained permanently 
(the “Maintenance Compound”). 
o 
Ecological Mitigation Area – area for ecological enhancement within the 
Project Site Boundary;    
 Gas Connection Environmental Report 
Prepared for:  Abergelli Power Limited   
 
AECOM 
2 
 
o 
Permanent parking and drainage to include: a site foul, oily water and 
surface water drainage system.  
 
A Gas Connection in the form of a new Above Ground Installation (AGI) and 
underground gas connection (the “Gas Pipeline”) to bring natural gas to the 
Generating Equipment from the National Gas Transmission System; and 
 
An Electrical Connection in the form of a new underground electrical cable to 
export power from the Generating Equipment to the National Grid Electricity 
Transmission System (NETS).  
1.2.4 
The Gas Connection is the focus of this Environmental Report.  
1.3 
Development Consent under the Planning Act 2008 
a) 
Power Generation Plant 
1.3.1 
The Power Generation Plant described above would have a rated electrical output of 
up to 299 MW of electricity and is therefore classified as a Nationally Significant 
Infrastructure Project (“NSIP”) under section 15 of the Planning Act 2008 (as amended) 
(“PA 2008”).   
1.3.2 
As such, APL is applying to the Secretary of State (“SoS”) for Business, Energy and 
Industrial Strategy under section 31 of the PA 2008 for a Development Consent Order 
(“DCO”) for powers to construct, operate and maintain the Power Generation Plant. 
The DCO Application was submitted on 25th May 2018. 
b) 
Associated Development 
1.3.3 
The Gas Connection and Electrical Connection comprise development associated with 
the NSIP (“associated development”).   
1.3.4 
The PA 2008 restricts associated development for which consent can be sought under 
a DCO in Wales to development that is associated with a generating station with a 
capacity in excess of 350 MW.  As the Power Generation Plant would have rated 
electrical output of up to 299 MW, associated development to the Power Generation 
Plant cannot be included in any application for DCO under the PA 2008.  The 
application for a DCO therefore only includes the Power Generation Plant and related 
mitigation as "authorised development" and does not seek development consent for the 
Gas Connection or the Electrical Connection. 
c) 
Town and Country Planning Act 1990  
1.3.5 
APL is seeking for planning permission for the Gas Connection under the Town and 
Country Planning Act 1990 ("TCPA 1990").  
d) 
The Project Environmental Statement  
1.3.6 
The Project is a Schedule 1 development as it is a thermal generating station with a 
heat output of 300 MW or more as listed in Schedule 1, paragraph 2(1) of the 
Infrastructure Planning (Environmental Impact Assessment) Regulations 2009. As 
such, an EIA has been carried out in respect of the development.  
1.3.7 
Mitigation has been identified within the EIA carried out for the Project which is 
applicable to the Gas Connection. This mitigation includes both embedded mitigation 
(mitigation inherent in to the design of the Project and also specifically to the Gas 
 Gas Connection Environmental Report 
Prepared for:  Abergelli Power Limited   
 
AECOM 
3 
 
Connection), or additional mitigation (which is required to mitigate any residual adverse 
effects of the Project). 
1.4 
The Developer 
1.4.1 
The Applicant is APL, an energy development company established for the Project and 
owned by Drax Group plc (Drax). 
1.4.2 
Drax is responsible for generating 6% of the UKs electricity, predominantly via Drax 
power station in Selby.  Drax is one of the UK’s largest energy producers and is 
committed to helping to reduce carbon emissions, displacing more coal off the system 
and providing additional system support to plug the gaps created by intermittent 
renewables and boost security of supply.  
1.4.3 
Drax acquired APL from Watt Power Limited (Watt Power) in 2016. Stag Energy 
Development Company Ltd (Stag Energy) previously provided management services to 
Watt Power in relation to APL. Stag Energy continues to provide resources to APL 
through a management services agreement. Stag Energy was founded in 2002 and the 
company draws on a depth of experience within a team that has created and delivered 
over 10,000 MW of power generation and related infrastructure projects across the 
globe, of which 2,500 MW has been delivered in the UK. 
1.4.4 
APL is committed to the development of assets to support the UK Government’s drive 
to a low carbon economy.  APL recognises the need to balance commercial issues with 
the environmental benefits and concerns relating to energy projects and believes this 
balance can be responsibly delivered. The Gas Connection as part of the Project will 
be designed and developed to high quality, safety and environmental standards. 
1.4.5 
Further information on the companies referred to above is provided at 
www.abergellipower.co.uk or www.drax.com.

Project Description 
2.1.1 
The Gas Connection will be in the form of a new AGI and Gas Pipeline. This is to bring 
natural gas to the Project from the National Gas Transmission System. Gas will be 
transported at a suitable rate and pressure to produce up to 299 MW when the Power 
Station is in use. The AGI will comprise a Minimum Offtake Connection (MOC) facility, 
which will be owned by National Grid; and a Pipeline Inspection Gauge (PIG) Trap 
Facility (PTF), which will be owned by APL.  
2.1.2 
The AGI (both the MOC and PTF) will be located on the southern side of the Rhyd-y-
pandy Road leading to Felindre. Once complete, maintenance access for the AGI will 
be from the Rhyd-y-pandy Road via a short, purpose built tarmacadam access track. 
The Gas Connection will then follow a route corridor shown on Figure 2: Site Layout 
Plan, running in southerly direction to the Abergelli Power Station. It will be 
approximately 1.4 kilometres (km) in length. It will cross the National Gas Transmission 
System in two locations, a Public Right of Way (PRoW LC35B) in one location, two 
private farm tracks and one ditch (field drain). Termination of the Gas Connection will 
be at a second PTF located at the Abergelli Power Station.

2.2.1 
The Gas Connection includes both the Gas Pipeline together with its connection with 
the AGI. The route for the actual Gas Pipeline will be marked out, topsoil stripped and 
moved to one side and the trench excavated. The exact construction method for the 
Gas Pipeline will be subject to further survey and dependant on the National Gas 
Transmission System depth and ground conditions.  
2.2.2 
Construction of the Gas Pipeline would likely take place within a temporary fenced strip 
of land called the ‘working width’. The working width is required to facilitate safe 
construction and the protection of off-site receptors. 
2.2.3 
It is likely that the working width would be 30 metres (m) along the length of the Gas 
Pipeline route, although it may be necessary to increase / decrease the working width 
at specific points. For example, adjacent to road and water crossings it may be 
necessary to increase the working width to provide additional working areas and 
storage for materials or special plant. Alternatively, adjacent to areas of conservation or 
existing services it may be necessary to decrease the working width to reduce potential 
impacts. 
2.2.4 
Aside from the special crossings, for example, water and road crossings, where 
trenchless techniques (e.g. Horizontal Directional Drilling, HDD) may be used to reduce 
impact on sensitive areas, it is expected that the Gas Pipeline would be constructed 
using standard open-cut cross-country pipeline construction techniques.

2.2.5 
The Gas Pipeline will be delivered in spools and laid out along the route before welding 
into a string. The sections of pipe would then be lowered into the trench using side arm 
booms and backfilled for testing. Where the Gas Pipeline route crosses the National 
Gas Transmission System, an appropriate method of crossing will be undertaken which 
affords the appropriate level of protection to the National Gas Transmission System at 
its existing depth. This may include open cut techniques or a trenchless crossing such 
as HDD. 
2.2.6 
After the Gas Pipeline is laid, the excavated material and topsoil will be returned to its 
original position. The surface will then be seeded to restore it to its original state. 
2.2.7 
Gas systems skids will be placed and piping connected before commissioning the Gas 
Pipeline, pressure regulators and metering. 
2.2.8 
The Gas Connection will cross an existing PRoW LC35B. During construction, 
temporary closure(s) of all or part of the footpath and restriction of the use of the 
footpath may be required in order to ensure user safety.  Details of how these 
temporary arrangements will be managed will be supplied in supporting management 
plans. It is not envisaged that the PRoW will be stopped up.  
2.3 
Operation and Maintenance  
2.3.1 
The Gas Connection would remain operational for the entire lifetime of the Project. No 
parts of the Gas Connection would be manned. Telemetry apparatus (both within the 
Gas Pipeline trench and at the AGI) would report back any issues to a central control 
room. Should any issues be identified, the Gas Pipeline would be isolated and the 
supply switched off, pending investigation of any faults. Access to the AGI during 
maintenance / repair would be via a new permanent access off Rhyd-y-pandy Road. 
2.3.2 
The primary maintenance and inspection activities would be as follows: 
 
Visual checks; 
 
In-line inspection; 
 
Cathodic protection checks; and 
 
Valve operation checks. 
2.4 
Decommissioning 
2.4.1 
It is assumed that the Gas Connection would be decommissioned after 25 years, which 
is the design life of the Power Generation Plant. However, it is important to note that 
elements of the Connection would be owned and operated by a third party. In 
accordance with its statutory duties, National Grid may use these assets in the future 
as part of its wider network.  
2.4.2 
As such, though the date of decommissioning of some elements of the Gas Connection 
cannot be certain, a 25 year working assumption has been used to allow for a 
reasonable assessment of decommissioning effects in this Report.  
2.4.3 
Finally, it is assumed that elements of the Gas Connection may be left in situ at the 
point of decommissioning, as this approach is likely to cause less environmental effects 
than removal. Any potential effects linked to decommissioning of the AGI and other 
ancillary elements are considered to be either less than or comparable with the 
construction phase, and are therefore not discussed separately.

2.5 
Embedded Mitigation 
2.5.1 
Mitigation that is either implicit in the design of the Gas Connection or its construction 
and operation through standard control measures routinely used, such as working 
within best practice guidance during construction, is known as embedded mitigation. 
The embedded mitigation implemented in relation to the Gas Connection is 
summarised as follows but is outlined in greater detail within the Mitigation Register in 
Appendix 2.1 (the notation provided is for ease of reference): 
 
Production of an Outline Construction Environment Management Plan (CEMP) 
(GEN01) which includes waste management (OE01) (Appendix 2.2); 
 
Production of an Outline Landscape & Ecology Mitigation Strategy (LEMS) 
(GEN02) (Appendix 2.3); 
 
Management of dust and air quality mitigation (AQ01 – AQ04); 
 
Management of noise, noise generation and vibration management (N01 – N08); 
 
Protection of sensitive habitats, sensitive ecological features, protected species 
and designated sites (E01 – E03); 
 
Production of an Outline Surface Water Management Plan (WQ01) (Appendix 2.3), 
surface water management (WQ04) and drainage (WQ06 and WQ09); 
 
Protection of groundwater and hydrogeology features, peat management, 
identification and management of unexpected contamination(G01 – G03); 
 
Landscape and visual mitigation from PRoW and other amenity viewpoints (LV01); 
 
Production of a Construction Traffic Management Plan (CTMP) (Appendix 2.5) 
(including safety, severance and traffic management such as speed restrictions) in 
addition to a Construction Staff Travel Plan (CSTP) (T03 – T05) (Appendix 2.6); 
and 
 
Archaeological investigation including a Written Scheme of Investigation (WSI) 
(CH01 and CH02). 
2.5.2 
This embedded mitigation applies to the Gas Connection and has been assumed for 
this Environmental Report to be in place from the outset. The assessments included in 
this Report therefore consider the likely significant effects of the Gas Connection 
including embedded mitigation.   
2.5.3 
Any required additional mitigation is set out within the relevant assessment in Section 5 
of this Report and cross referenced within the Mitigation Register in Appendix 2.1. The 
management plans committed to as embedded mitigation are also referenced where 
relevant.

Site Description 
3.1 
Gas Connection Location 
3.1.1 
The Gas Connection (see Figure 1) is located on open agricultural land approximately 
2 km north of Junction 46 on the M4, approximately 3 km to the north of the city of 
Swansea, 1 km southeast of Felindre and 1.4 km north of Llangyfelach.  
3.1.2 
The current land use is improved grazing for sheep and horses on poor quality 
agricultural land (Agricultural Land Classification Grade 4).  There are no residential 
dwellings located within the Gas Connection Site.   
3.1.3 
Ground levels vary from approximately 145 m above ordnance datum (AOD) at the 
highest point in the north-west corner at Rhyd-y-pandy Road to approximately 86 m 
AOD along the southern perimeter, with ground levels generally falling in a southerly 
and south easterly direction. The CCS Unitary Development Plan (UDP) Proposals 
Map (Ref.1.1) identifies mineral deposits along the Gas Connection including coal and 
sand and aggregates. There is a groundwater body below the Gas Connection of poor 
current and projected Water Framework Directive (Ref.4.2) status. 
3.1.4 
Two hedgerows are situated along the Gas Pipeline route that depict field boundaries 
that could have medieval origins. The first is located in the northern extent of the Gas 
Pipeline, running north-south along the field boundary that marks the edge of the 
western boundary of the Gas Connection. The second crosses perpendicular to the 
Gas Connection approximately half way along the Gas Pipeline length.     
3.1.5 
The Gas Pipeline route crosses one field drain that discharges into the Afon Llan. The 
Afon Llan links with the Afon Lliw and the River Loughor, which discharges into 
Carmarthen Bay through Bury Inlet, 7 km west of the Gas Connection. Carmarthen bay 
and its estuaries is designated as a Special Area for Conservation (SAC) and Bury Inlet 
is designated as a Special Protection Area (SPA), Site of Special Scientific Interest 
(SSSI) and as a wetland of international importance under the Ramsar Convention. 
There are no Main Rivers within the Gas Connection working width. 
3.2 
Surrounding Area 
3.2.1 
The area surrounding the Gas Connection is, at present, predominantly rural in 
character, although there is the Felindre Park and Share facility to the south and a 
substantial amount of utility infrastructure in the area, some of which the Gas 
Connection will cross. 
3.2.2 
The National Gas Transmission System, a Water Main and a decommissioned Oil 
Pipeline are all located in the area around the Gas Connection. To the west of the Gas 
Connection there is the Substation and Felindre Gas Compressor Station. There is also 
a network of electricity pylons, underground utilities and overhead lines which lead to 
and from the Substation. The Felindre Water Treatment Works is located to the 
northwest, while the Cefn Betingau Solar Park and Abergelli Solar Farm are located to 
the east of Gas Connection. A further three solar parks are built in the vicinity; Lletty-
Morfil Solar Farm, Brynwhilach Solar Park and Gelliwern Isaf Solar Park.  
3.2.3 
Other features of the area include public footpaths, bridleways and tracks located in 
and around the Gas Connection, linking it to the wider area. Of particular note is the

LC35B PRoW, which crosses the Gas Connection. There are a number of residential 
properties between 600 m and 875 m from the Gas Connection. These include Cefn-
betingau to the east, Feline Wen Farm and Llwynhelig to the south east, Maes-eglwys 
to the south, and Lletty-Morfil Farm and Abergelli Farm to the west.  
3.2.4 
There is a paintball activity centre located to the west of the Gas Connection off the 
B4889. Other tourist attractions and resources include the Cwm Clydach Nature 
Reserve woodland and nature reserve at Clydach, 3 km east of the Gas Connection 
and the National Cycle Route 43, which passes through Clydach on route to Swansea 
from Builth Wells. 
3.2.5 
There are a number of Sites of Nature Conservation Interest (SINCs) adjacent to the 
Gas Connection including: 
 
The Lletty-Morfil SINC (no. 106) to the east; 
 
The Rhos Fawr SINC (no.316) to the north across the Rhyd-Y-Pandy road from 
the Gas Connection.  
 
The Rhyd-Y-Pandy SINC (no. 315) is 71 m to the east; and  
 
Waun Garn Wen SINC (no. 105) 135 m to the west.  
3.2.6 
There is an area of Ancient Woodland that partially coincides with the Lletty-Morfil 
SINC and surrounds the Substation and the Gas Compressor Station to the west of the 
Gas Connection. There is also an area of Ancient Woodland to the east and a Wildlife 
Trust Reserve (Coed Barcud) to the north east.  The Mawr Uplands Special Landscape 
Area (SLA) is located within 5 km of the Gas Connection, extending from the north-
west round to the east.

Potential Environmental Effects 
4.1.1 
The following sections describe the potential effects from the construction, operation 
and decommissioning of the Gas Connection. Throughout the topic specific sections, 
reference will be made to both the Gas Connection Site and the wider Project Site 
Boundary; the former is the subject of this Environmental Report but where surveys or 
data collection has been made on the Project Site Boundary, this has been made clear.  
4.1.2 
In addition, reference will also be made to study areas. These may change in size and 
proximity to the Gas Connection, and in some topics, relate to the Project Site 
Boundary. Where relevant, this has been clearly set out.  
4.1.3 
In the interests of aiding the reader, these definitions are repeated for ease of 
reference: 
 
AGI - Above Ground Installation; 
 
Gas Connection - A gas connection to the proposed Abergelli Power Project 
Station from the National Gas Transmission System comprised of an AGI and Gas 
Pipeline; 
 
Gas Connection Site Boundary - The boundary of the Gas Connection Site; 
 
Gas Pipeline - Underground gas connection; 
 
Project Site Boundary - The boundary of the Project Site to contain the ‘Project’; 
and 
 
The OCGT, Power Generation Plant and new connections to the gas and 
electricity networks on land adjacent to the Felindre Gas Compressor Station at 
Abergelli Farm, Felindre, Swansea SA5 7NN. 
 
4.2 
Ecology 
a) 
Baseline Conditions 
4.2.1 
Previous ecological surveys have been undertaken by BSG Ecology in 2014 and have 
been repeated by AECOM in 2017/2018. These baseline reports are contained within 
the Appendices referred to throughout this section. Given the time between initial 2014 
surveys and submission of the DCO Application for the Project, ecology surveys have 
been repeated to provide more recent ecological survey information to support the 
Project.  
4.2.2 
It should be noted that the Gas Connection fits entirely within the Project Site Boundary 
(for AECOM reports dated 2017/2018). The 2014 survey areas (BSG Ecology and 
Parsons Brinckerhoff reports) are more extensive than the 2017/2018 survey extents 
as the Project Site Boundary was larger in 2014. The Project Site Boundary has since 
been further refined to that shown on Figure 1 and Figure 2, and the survey areas 
reduced as required.   
4.2.3 
The survey extents for both 2014 and 2017/2018 surveys are shown on Figure 4.1, and 
therefore references to survey areas and any associated buffer zones or extents 
required for species specific surveys should be understood in the context of these 
boundaries.

Burry Inlet SPA and Ramsar 
7.8 km south-west  
A component site of the Carmarthen Bay and Estuaries/Bae Caerfyrddin ac Aberoedd European Marine Site. 
Partially overlaps the Carmarthen Bay SAC.  
Burry Inlet is a large estuarine complex located between the Gower Peninsula and Llanelli in South Wales. It 
includes extensive areas of intertidal sand- and mud-flats, together with large sand dune systems at the mouth 
of the estuary. The site contains the largest continuous area of saltmarsh in Wales (2,200 ha). The estuary 
experiences large tidal fluctuations (about 8 m), which has the consequence of exposing a large extent of 
intertidal sediments on a regular basis. These are mostly sandy, but muddy substrates are to be found in more 
sheltered areas. The Burry Inlet regularly supports large numbers of overwintering wildfowl and waders that 
feed in the saltmarshes and on the intertidal areas.

Nant Y Crimp SSSI 
1.75 km west 
Nant y Crimp is of special interest for its wet pastures, species-rich neutral grasslands and semi-natural 
woodland as well as associated scrub, which are host to several uncommon plant species. 
Notable plant species recorded at the site include petty whin Genista anglica, cranberry Vaccinium oxycoccos, 
narrow buckler fern Dryopteris carthusiana and whorled caraway Carum verticillatum, the latter an Atlantic 
species characteristic of unimproved pastures in the South Wales coalfield. 
In addition, there is also a colony of the marsh fritillary butterfly Euphydryas aurinia at the site. This is a 
declining species confined, in South Wales to wet agriculturally unimproved pastures where its food plant, 
devil’s bit scabious Succisa pratensis, grows in profusion.

iii. Protected Species Records 
4.2.7 
A wide range of historical records of protected and/or notable species were received 
from SEWBReC.  Relevant records are reported in the Preliminary Ecological 
Assessment and corresponding technical baseline reports (Appendices 3.1 – 3.19).  
Historic records and survey results are considered together in the evaluation of 
ecological features below.  
Phase 1 Habitat Survey 
4.2.8 
The land within the Gas Connection Site Boundary supports rows of trees, standalone 
trees, dense and scattered scrub, semi-improved grassland, marshy grassland, 
standing water and hedgerows.  
4.2.9 
A summary of data collected during the Phase 1 Habitat survey is presented in Table 
4-3.

Invasive Plant Species 
4.2.10 
During the 2014 survey, BSG Ecology identified five invasive species within the Project 
Site Boundary subject to legal controls: Japanese knotweed; Himalayan balsam; 
rhododendron; floating pennywort Hydrocotyle ranunculoides; and montbretia 
Crocosmia × crocosmiiflora. Two of these species; Japanese knotweed and Himalayan 
balsam were found within the Gas Connection Site Boundary. 
4.2.11 
During the 2017 Phase 1 Habitat survey, three invasive species subject to legal 
controls were identified within the Gas Connection Site Boundary – Rhododendron 
Rhododendron ponticum, Japanese knotweed and Himalayan balsam, and one within 
the Gas Connection Site boundary - Japanese knotweed, on the northern perimeter, 
east of the AGI Access.

Invertebrates 
4.2.12 
Several records of notable moths and the protected marsh fritillary butterfly Euphydryas 
aurinia were returned from the local records centre.  
4.2.13 
Invertebrate surveys were carried out by BSG Ecology in 2014 for moths, beetles, and 
aquatic macroinvertebrates (in ponds and watercourses).  There is no habitat with the 
potential to support marsh fritillary within the Gas Connection Site Boundary and they 
are considered to be absent from the survey area.  
4.2.14 
The watercourses were sampled and samples were analysed to at least family level as 
required to obtain a score for water quality for the watercourse sections sampled; 
where possible, species were also recorded for completeness and so that any rare 
species collected would be identified.  Watercourse 4 is the only watercourse within the 
Gas Connection Site. The report did not highlight any rare species and concluded the 
watercourses were of generally good quality.  
4.2.15 
Notable or Priority beetle, butterfly and moths species identified during the survey are 
given in 4-4 below.  Thirteen Section 7 species of moth were recorded during the 
survey. Their habitat requirements fit with the habitats present within the Gas 
Connection Site Boundary, and as such it is likely they are present.

Amphibians 
4.2.16 
Records of common toad Bufo bufo, palmate newt Lissotriton helveticus and common 
frog Rana temporaria were returned from the local records centre.  
4.2.17 
Twenty-six ponds were subject to a Habitat Suitability Index (HSI) assessment to 
assess suitability for support breeding Great Crested Newt (GCN).  From the results of 
the HSI assessment and where access allowed seven ponds were subject to further 
surveys for GCN including eDNA analysis.  
4.2.18 
No GCNs were recorded during the 2014 and 2017 surveys, and the eDNA analysis 
returned negative results for each of the ponds for GCN within the Gas Connection Site 
Boundary.   
4.2.19 
Ponds 22 and 23 are located within the Gas Connection Site Boundary and may 
require removal. Pond 22 currently supports palmate newts and is likely to support 
other amphibians including frogs and toads as well as a range of generalist aquatic 
invertebrates. Pond 23 could not be assessed but if it contains water has the potential 
to support generalist aquatic invertebrates and common amphibians. 
4.2.20 
The majority of the habitat suitable for supporting common amphibians is present south 
of the Gas Connection Site. The dominance of improved grassland fields with fenced 
boundaries in the north limits the suitability of the area for supporting amphibians.  
 Gas Connection Environmental Report 
Prepared for:  Abergelli Power Limited   
 
AECOM 
22 
 
4.2.21 
It is considered unlikely that GCN will be present within any of the ponds that were not 
surveyed or within 500 m of these ponds in surrounding habitat given the absence of 
GCN from all nearby ponds surveyed.  The Gas Connection will require the removal of 
Pond 23. Pond 23 could not be assessed but, if it contains water, it has the potential to 
support common amphibians.  
Reptiles 
4.2.22 
The desk study confirmed the presence of slow-worm Anguis fragilis, grass snake 
Natrix helvetica helvetica, adder Vipera berus and common lizard Zootoca vivipara 
within 2 km, and the presence of grass snake and common lizard within the Gas 
Connection Site Boundary.  
4.2.23 
During the 2017 reptile survey (survey area as shown on Figure 2 of Appendix 3.5), a 
total of 51 adult and juvenile common lizard observations were recorded within the 
Project Site Boundary, with a peak count of six adults recorded on one survey visit.  
Observations of common lizard were recorded from across the reptile survey area.  
The majority of records were from the verges either side of the grassy track running 
through the centre of the Gas Connection Site and from the semi-improved neutral 
grassland present around the National Grid site.  
4.2.24 
During the course of the reptile survey, male, female, and juvenile common lizards 
were recorded, which confirmed that there was a breeding population present within 
the Project Site Boundary.  
4.2.25 
Based on the survey results and the criteria laid out in Froglife Advice Sheet 10 
(Ref.5.1), the Site supports a ‘Good population’ of common lizard.  
4.2.26 
The Gas Connection Site does not meet the criteria for a ‘Key Reptile Site’.  
4.2.27 
The survey areas for grass snake remain the same in both the 2014 and 2017 surveys 
(survey area as shown on Figure 2 of Appendix 3.5). No grass snakes were identified 
within the 2017 reptile survey area including the area with the highest abundance 
during the 2014 surveys.  However, there is the potential for grass snake to be present 
within the Gas Connection Site Boundary and to have gone unrecorded since grass 
snakes are wide ranging.   
4.2.28 
As such, it should be assumed grass snake is likely to be present at low densities 
within the Gas Connection Site Boundary and surrounding habitat.  
Breeding Birds 
4.2.29 
Breeding bird surveys were undertaken in 2014 (BSG Ecology report, Appendix 3.16) 
and in 2017/2018 (AECOM, Appendix 3.6a and Appendix 3.6b). The survey area is 
more extensive in 2014 as the Project Site Boundary was larger. The 2017/2018 
surveys were undertaken on a refined Project Site Boundary but covered the same 
core areas which make up the Project.  
4.2.30 
The BSG Ecology surveys identified nine Section 7 bird species (previously referred to 
as species of principal importance for nature conservation in S42 of the NERC Act 
2006, now repealed by Environment (Wales) Act 2016) comprising cuckoo Cuculus 
canorus, grasshopper warbler Locustella naevia, dunnock Prunella modularis, house 
sparrow Passer domesticus, linnet Carduelis cannabina, lesser redpoll Acanthis 
 Gas Connection Environmental Report

cabaret, skylark Alauda arvensis, song thrush Turdus philomelos, and tree pipit Anthus 
trivialis were considered likely to breed on-site.  
4.2.31 
All nine Section 7 species recorded are also red-listed species of conservation concern 
in Wales, with the exception of dunnock (which is amber-listed).  An additional seven 
amber-listed species, bullfinch Pyrrhula pyrrhula, mistle thrush Turdus viscivorus, 
meadow pipit Anthus pratensis, reed bunting Emberiza schoeniclus, common redstart 
Phoenicurus 
phoenicurus, 
whitethroat 
Sylvia 
communis 
and 
willow 
warbler 
Phylloscopus trochilis were also considered to have bred.  
4.2.32 
No territories of species listed under Schedule 1 Part 1 of the Wildlife & Countryside 
Act 1981 (as amended) (Schedule 1 species) were recorded, although two Schedule 1 
species were recorded during the surveys, as follows. A pair of red kite was recorded 
mobbing a peregrine falcon Falco peregrinus in May.  A pair of red kite was also 
recorded flying over the breeding bird survey area on the same survey day. Given the 
timing of the records, and that at least one pair were recorded during survey it is likely 
that red kite breed locally but that the single record of peregrine referred to a transient 
bird.  No evidence was found to suggest breeding of either species occurred within the 
breeding bird survey area during 2014.  
4.2.33 
The single breeding bird survey undertaken in 2017 revealed the same nine Section 7 
bird species as recorded during the 2014 survey (cuckoo, grasshopper warbler, 
dunnock, house sparrow, linnet, lesser redpoll, skylark, song thrush and tree pipit). 
Nine further species listed on the Amber List were also recorded (bullfinch, common 
redstart, meadow pipit, mistle thrush, meadow pipit, reed bunting, stock dove, 
whitethroat and willow warbler) although no species listed on Schedule 1 were 
recorded within the Project Site Boundary. The survey results from 2017 are largely 
found to be in line with what was identified in 2014 and there is no significant difference 
in species breeding within the Project Site Boundary between the two surveys.  
4.2.34 
A survey for goshawk was undertaken in February 2018 of habitats suitable for 
supporting the species and with the potential to be impacted by the Project. During the 
survey there were no observations of goshawk.  
4.2.35 
Four further breeding bird surveys were conducted between April and May 2018. The 
2018 surveys recorded similar species assemblages as for 2014 and 2017, but the 
numbers of birds were due to a targeted survey with a reduced survey area. 
Bats 
4.2.1 
All of the distances specified in this section are relative to the wider Project Site 
Boundary not just the Gas Connection Site. In addition, bat features are explained in 
the wider context of the Project Site Boundary where relevant due to the connectivity of 
features for commuting, foraging and roost, and therefore may be outside the Gas 
Connection Site Boundary.  
4.2.2 
Bat surveys were undertaken by BGS in 2014 (Appendix 3.8), AECOM in 2017 
(Appendix 3.7a) and completion of remaining surveys in 2018 to provide an updated 
report (Appendix 3.7b).   
4.2.3 
The desk study identified no sites designated for bats within 10 km of the Project Site 
Boundary.  The desk study confirmed the presence of the following species from within 
2 km of the Project Site Boundary: Daubenton's Myotis daubentonii, Natterer's Myotis

nattereri, Noctule Nyctalus noctule, pipistrelle species Pipistrellus sp., common 
pipistrelle Pipistrellus pipistrellus, soprano pipistrelle Pipistrellus pygmaeus, long-eared 
species Plecotus sp., brown long-eared Plecotus auritus and generic records of bat 
species Chiroptera. None of these records of bats were from within the Project Site.  
4.2.4 
The desk study identified the following records of known roost sites within 2 km of the 
Project Site: 
 
A noctule tree roost approximately 1 km north-west of the Project Site Boundary; 
 
Common pipistrelle roost approximately 1.3 km east of the Project Site Boundary; 
 
A common pipistrelle roost approximately 1.8 km south-east of the Project Site 
Boundary; 
 
A common pipistrelle roost approximately 1 km southeast of the Project Site 
Boundary; 
 
A common pipistrelle roost approximately 1 km north-west of the Project Site 
Boundary; 
 
A soprano pipistrelle roost approximately 2 km south-west of the Project Site 
Boundary; 
 
A soprano pipistrelle roost approximately 2 km north-west of the Project Site 
Boundary; 
 
A long-eared bat and brown-long-eared bat  roost approximately 1.6 km east of the 
Project Site Boundary; and, 
 
A long-eared bat and brown long-eared bat roost approximately 1.1 km north-west 
of the Project Site Boundary. 
4.2.5 
The specific locations of the bat roosts are confidential.  
Bat Roosts 
4.2.6 
There are no buildings suitable for supporting bats within the Gas Connection Site, or 
the within the wider Project Site Boundary.  
4.2.7 
Buildings adjacent to the Project Site Boundary were assessed, and summarised 
below. Building locations can be found in Appendix 3.7b, Figure 2.   
 
AECOM Building 1:  Unknown Roost Status. Not surveyed by AECOM or BSG 
Ecology, Building is approximately 125m from the Project Site Boundary; 
 
AECOM Building 2:  Confirmed as a long-eared and pipistrelle roost by BSG in 
2014 (Appendix 3.8). Not surveyed by AECOM. It is approximately 120 m outside 
of the Project Site Boundary;  
 
AECOM Building 3:  No Roost; 
 
AECOM Building 4:  No Roost; 
 
AECOM Building 5:  No Roost; 
 
AECOM Building 6:  No Roost; 
 
AECOM Building 7:  Confirmed as a lesser horseshoe, long-eared and pipistrelle 
roost by BSG Ecology in 2014 (Appendix 3.8). Surveyed by AECOM in 2018 
(Appendix 3.7b) and confirmed summer, non-maternity roost for at least two lone 
roosting common pipistrelle bats, a summer roost, possibly maternity, for at least 8 
long-eared bats and a suspected roost for at least one Myotis sp.  
 
AECOM Building 8: BSG Ecology internal inspection did not find evidence of bats 
but not all areas were accessible (Appendix 3.8). Due to the bat roost features 
identified by BSG Ecology an internal inspection only is not sufficient to determine 
if this building is being used as a bat roost. Therefore it was surveyed in 2018 by 
AECOM (Appendix 3.7b) and confirmed as a summer non-maternity roost for at 
least two lone roosting common pipistrelle bats.

4.2.8 
Tree 19 is a lone male or non-breeding female common pipistrelle summer roost.  No 
other trees were identified as bat roosts. A photograph of Tree 19 is shown in Appendix 
3.7b, Plate 1.1.  
4.2.9 
A trial shaft (mining feature) and a mine adit are located within the Project Site 
Boundary. A safety investigation confirmed that the trial shaft has been filled in. The 
respective landowner has confirmed that the mine adit, located next to Building 4, is an 
underground feature that has been capped and is now covered by grass. Therefore, 
there is no likelihood of hibernating bats or any suitable bat habitat being present in 
either of the mine related features within the Project Site Boundary. 
Bat Activity – Walked Transects 
4.2.10 
At least 13 species of bat were recorded foraging and/or commuting in close proximity 
of and within the Project Site Boundary.  The following species have been identified 
during bat surveys at the Project Site Boundary during the bat surveys undertaken in 
2017/2018: 
 
Greater horseshoe; 
 
Lesser horseshoe; 
 
Common pipistrelle; 
 
Soprano pipistrelle; 
 
Nathusius’ pipistrelle; 
 
Daubenton’s; 
 
Natterer’s; 
 
Mytois species; (including calls with characteristics of Bechstein's, Brandt's Myotis 
brandtii and Whiskered Myotis mystacinus); 
 
Noctule; 
 
Serotine; 
 
Leisler’s; 
 
Long-eared species; and, 
 
Indeterminate species.  
4.2.11 
Common and soprano pipistrelles were the most commonly recorded species in the 
Project Site (Appendix 3.7b).  Overall pipistrelle species comprised 87.3% of all passes 
recorded on the walked transect surveys and 93.8% of the static detector surveys. 
They were also the most commonly recorded species during the emergence/re-entry 
surveys.  Pipistrelle species comprised of 89.9% of the passes recorded on the North 
Transect and 85.6% of the passes recorded on the South Transect.   
4.2.12 
Similarly, pipistrelle species were the most commonly recorded species during the BSG 
2014 transect and static detector surveys (Appendix 3.8).  
4.2.13 
Two passes of Nathusius’ pipistrelle were recorded during the July 2017 transect 
surveys, one record from the South Transect and one record from the North Transect, 
making up 0.2% of total bat passes.  
4.2.14 
Overall Myotis species comprised 9.5% of the total calls recorded on the transect 
surveys. Myotis species comprised 7.7% of the passes recorded on the North Transect 
and 10.8% of the calls recorded on the South Transect. 
4.2.15 
Activity levels for Myotis species during the transect surveys were comparable with the 
activity levels recorded during the BSG 2014 transect surveys (Appendix 3.8).  
 Gas Connection Environmental Report 
Prepared for:  Abergelli Power Limited   
 
AECOM 
26 
 
4.2.16 
Noctule, serotine and Leisler’s (N/S/L) bats comprised 1.8% of the passes recorded on 
walked transect surveys. N/S/L bats comprised of 1.6% of the passes recorded on the 
North Transect and 2.0% of the passes recorded on the South Transect.  The 
percentages by species within Appendix 3.7a and 3.7b are not comparable to 2014 
surveys as the species were not split by species (Appendix 3.8).  
4.2.17 
Long-eared and possible long-eared bat comprised a total of 0.4% of the passes 
recorded on the North Transect and 0.4% recorded on the South Transect   surveys. 
BSG Ecology did not breakdown these species into percentages but figures are 
comparable between years (Appendix 3.8). 
4.2.18 
There was a single lesser horseshoe bat pass, recorded on the South Transect, 
equating to 0.2% of the total passes for the South Transect and 0.1% of the total 
passes for the Project Site Boundary.  This was recorded in August 2017 (Appendix 
3.7a).  BSG Ecology also recorded a single pass of lesser horseshoe on the South 
Transect (Appendix 3.8).  
4.2.19 
Higher levels of activity were recorded in the Southern Transect (713 bat passes; 15.4 
Bat Activity Index (BAI)), compared to the Northern Transect (555 bat passes, 12.3 
BAI). The bat activity levels across the Project Site Boundary however are broadly 
similar.  
4.2.20 
Bat activity was recorded across the Project Site (Appendix 3.7a.b, Figure 5.1). 
Vegetated stream or wet ditch corridors appear to be important for bats within the 
Project Site Boundary. The distribution of bat calls suggests the following general 
patterns of activity. This is a qualitative assessment only: 
 
Pipistrelle bats were recorded across the Project Site;  
 
Myotis species showed some association with mature tree lines and/or areas near 
water; 
 
Noctule, serotine and Leisler bats were primarily recorded at height over open 
fields across the Project Site; 
 
Long-eared bats showed some association with mature tree lines and are focused 
more towards the centre and south-east of the Project Site.  The passes recorded 
are within approximately 315m to 700m of the confirmed long-eared roost in 
Building 7 and approximately 270m and 850m of the BSG confirmed long-eared 
roost in Building 2;  
 
The single lesser horseshoe was recorded on the South Transect along a mature 
tree line approximately 900m south of the closest known lesser horseshoe roost in 
Building 2. 
4.2.21 
Bat activity was recorded at the Project Site between June and October 2017 and April 
and May 2018 (Appendix 3.7a,b).  
4.2.22 
August had the highest BAI for both transects.  The North Transect had a BAI of 17.2 
and the South Transect had a BAI of 24.9. 
4.2.23 
May had the second highest BAI for both transects.  The North Transect had a BAI of 
15.1 and the South Transect had a BAI of 20.4. 
4.2.24 
For the static detector surveys, July had the highest BAI of 456.8; the second highest 
BAI was 428.3 in May and third highest BAI was 423.0 in August.

4.2.25 
As seen in Plate 1.4 the month of August has a greater level of species richness than 
April and September.  This was a statistically significant result as seen in Appendix 
3.7b, Appendix 4A: Tables 2.3 and 2.4.  
4.2.26 
The statistical analysis of the first night of static detector data showed that there is no 
significant difference between the bat activity in each month sampled (Appendix 3.7b, 
Plate 1.2 and Appendix 4A: Table 2.2) as there was not statistically significant results 
between any of the months.   
4.2.27 
Young bats are typically born in June and July and during August the young are starting 
to leave the roosts to fly and feed. October is part of the bat mating period and a time 
when bats are extensively foraging for food as they are looking to store fat for the 
winter hibernation period. The general ecology of bat species is likely to influence the 
temporal activity for the Project Site.  
Bat Activity – Static Detectors  
4.2.28 
Static detector locations are presented in Appendix 3.7b, Figure 3.4.  
4.2.29 
In total 83,329 bat passes were recorded during the static detector surveys. Appendix 
3.7b, Table 1.22 gives the bat activity by the Static Detector Location Groups. Higher 
levels of activity were recorded in the Southern Static Detector Locations (20,470 total 
bat passes; 264.1 BAI), compared to the Northern Static Detector Locations (21,492 
total bat passes, 231.1 BAI), reflecting the pattern of the walked transect. 
4.2.30 
Using the first night data from static detector surveys, the species richness recorded 
across different locations was not statistically significant (Appendix 3.7b, Appendix 4A: 
Table 2.3), i.e. one location did not support a significantly different diversity of bats than 
any other location.  
4.2.31 
The distribution of bat echolocation calls detected during the static detector surveys 
suggests the following general patterns of activity. This is a qualitative assessment 
only:  
 
Pipistrelle bats were recorded across the Project Site;  
 
Myotis species were recorded across the Project Site; 
 
Noctule, Serotine and Leisler bats were recorded across the Project Site;  
 
Long-eared bats were recorded across the Project Site, with highest numbers 
recorded at Lane 3, followed by South 3 and  North 2;   
 
Greater horseshoe bats were recorded across the Project Site, with the South 
having the highest number of passes; and, 
 
Lesser horseshoe bats were recorded across the Project Site within the highest 
number recorded in the south and south-west of the Project Site at South 2, South 
3, Lane 1 and Lane 2. 
4.2.32 
The highest level of activity was recorded in the Lane Static Detector Locations (41,367 
total bat passes, 537.23 BAI). The Lane Static Detector Locations (even with the 
equipment malfunctions, see Limitations) had higher levels of activity compared to both 
the North and South Static Detector Locations combined. This may be because the 
Lane is likely used for foraging, along the sheltered woodland edge, and detectors may 
have been recording multiple passes by the same bats up and down the Lane. 
Dormouse 
 Gas Connection Environmental Report 
Prepared for:  Abergelli Power Limited   
 
AECOM 
28 
 
4.2.33 
No records of dormouse were returned from the local records centre.  No evidence of 
dormouse was identified during the field surveys.  
Water Vole 
4.2.34 
No records of water vole were returned during the desk study.  
4.2.35 
No watercourses that had potential for supporting water vole were recorded within the  
Gas Connection Site Boundary.   
Otter 
4.2.36 
There were no watercourses found within the Gas Connection Site Boundary suitable 
for supporting foraging otter, holt and couch creation. Water course 6 is suitable, which 
is immediately adjacent to the eastern boundary of Gas Connection Site. 
4.2.37 
Within the Project Site Boundary (as located in Appendix 3.10, Figure 1.1) a total of 
thirteen watercourses were found suitable for supporting commuting otter and two 
watercourses were suitable for supporting foraging otter, holt and couch creation.  One 
potential couch was identified with a trampled vegetation track leading to it which 
suggested occasional use by a mammal.  Two mammal tracks were identified; these 
may have been fox or another mammal.  No spraints, holts, footprints, anal jelly or 
other signs were identified during the otter surveys.  
4.2.38 
Due to the confirmed presence of otter upstream from the Project Site in 2015, the 
presence of spraints and a footprint from a nearby pond in May 2017 and the presence 
of a couch, slide pathway, feeding remains and a spraint from a watercourse it can be 
concluded that otters are still active in the locality.  As such it is likely that otters use the 
suitable watercourses within the otter survey area for occasional forging, commuting, 
resting and holt creation; although no evidence of holts was identified during the 
survey.  
Brown Hare 
4.2.39 
No records of brown hare Lepus europaeus were returned from the local records 
centre.  
4.2.40 
Sightings of brown hare were made during surveys for other species. A targeted survey 
for brown hare was not undertaken.  
4.2.41 
Scrub, trees and grassland habitat present throughout the Gas Connection Site are 
suitable for supporting the species.  
Badger 
4.2.42 
The badger survey area (as located in Appendix 3.11, Figure 1) contains suitable 
habitat for supporting badgers. The scrub, woodland edge and grassland habitat 
present throughout the badger survey area are suitable for supporting the species. A 
total of five badger setts were recorded during the survey (two of which were within 100 
m of the Gas Connection Site Boundary and the other three were well outside of the 
Gas Connection Site Boundary).  
4.2.43 
The survey identified signs of badger actively using the Gas Connection Site. Badger 
signs recorded included dung pits and mammal paths. It is therefore likely that badger

use the Gas Connection Site on a regular basis for foraging and to commute between 
foraging areas within the wider landscape.

Mitigation for the loss of standing water habitat will include the 
provision of replacement habitat. Provisionally, it has been 
suggested that a wildlife pond will be provided at the AGI.  
Hedgerows 
Habitat loss – there will be a temporary loss 180 m of 
species-poor hedgerow. 
Temporarily removed habitats will be reinstated.

Description of Effect 
Additional Mitigation  
Although the works are temporary in this area, the loss 
of standing water (may be possible to avoid) and mature 
rows of trees must be considered permanent due to the 
time required for mature trees to grow and the change in 
ground conditions making it unlikely for the pond to 
reform without human intervention.  
Mature trees will be replaced by standards of the same species 
or transplanted to a suitable location elsewhere within the Gas 
Connection Site. A new pond is located at the AGI.  
Potential for injuring or killing of reptiles during habitat 
removal, trampling and vehicular movements.  
Due to the ‘Good’ population of common lizard within the survey 
area a trapping and translocation programme including exclusion 
fencing will be undertaken to help protect any reptiles from being 
injured or killed.  
All works will proceed under a Method Statement (outline 
included in the LEMS (Appendix 2.3)) to be agreed with the Local 
Biodiversity Officer/Country Ecologist prior to works commencing. 
Breeding Birds 
Temporary removal of habitat with the potential to 
support breeding birds (trees, woodland, hedgerows and 
scrub). 
Habitats will be reinstated once works are complete. 
Localised disturbance from night time illumination in 
winter months.  
None 
Noise generated during construction. Birds generally 
adapt to localised construction noise. 
None 
Bats 
Disturbance, injury or killing of bats in newly formed 
roosts in trees previously confirmed as not supporting 
roosting bats during felling. 
Pre-construction checks will be undertaken on trees scheduled 
for removal for their current bat roost potential with consideration 
of the seasonal survey timings. Results will be used to inform any 
further mitigation to seek to avoid impacts on roosting bats. 
Severance of linear features used by bats roosting in 
Buildings 7 & 8.  
Building assessments and further bat surveys will be undertaken 
on Buildings 7 and 8. Results will be used to inform any further 
mitigation to seek to avoid impacts on bats from the roost

Otter 
There is the potential harm or kill individual otters during 
construction within 10 m of Watercourse 6. 
A pre-construction check for otter holts/couches and activity of

watercourses as identified as suitable for supporting the species 
during the 2017 field surveys. Further mitigation measures may 
be required if activity is found. Habitat management will be 
undertaken to help reduce the quality of the habitats for 
holt/couch creation for the period leading up to and for the 
duration of construction in that area.  
Additional mitigation may be required as a result of the survey.

removal of invasive weed species.  
Recommend management plan is produced to control and 
eradicate the invasive species within the Project Site Boundary.  
An updated invasive species survey will be undertaken to 
accurately assess invasive species and extents within the Project 
Site Boundary prior to the implementation of control measures.  
 
ii. Operation 
4.2.45 
No effects are anticipated through the operation phase of the Gas Connection.

4.3 
Flood Risk and Water Quality 
a) Baseline Conditions 
4.3.1 
This section is supported by the assessment demonstrated in  
 
Appendix 4.1: Flood Consequence Assessment (FCA); and 
 
Appendix 4.2: Water Framework Directive (WFD) Screening Assessment. 
4.3.2 
A 1km study area, taken from the Project Site Boundary, has been utilised and is 
shown on the corresponding Figures.  
i. 
Topography and land use 
4.3.3 
The topography of the Gas Connection Site is reasonably elevated and steeply sloping. 
Ground levels across the Gas Connection Site vary from approximately 145 m AOD in 
the north to 86 m AOD in the south.   
4.3.4 
The land within the Gas Connection Site is currently used for sheep and horse grazing. 
The area surrounding the Gas Connection is, at present, predominantly rural, although 
there is Felindre Park and Share to the south and a substantial amount of utility 
infrastructure in the area. Some springs and drainage channels/ditches drain the land 
and discharge into the Afon Llan River. The current land uses are considered “Less 
vulnerable” to flooding according to the TAN15 classifications. 
ii. Ground conditions and hydrogeology 
4.3.5 
The British Geological Survey (BGS), online mapping data, provides details of both the 
regional and local geology of the Gas Connection Site. The data indicates that the Gas 
Connection Site is underlain by bedrock of the Grovesend Formation, comprising 
mudstone, siltstone and sandstone (Figure 4.5). Superficial deposits across the Gas 
Connection Site are quite variable. However, they primarily comprise till and 
glaciofluvial deposits (sands and gravels) with a smaller area of peat in the 
southeastern corner Gas Connection Site Boundary (Figure 4.6). The thickness of the 
superficial deposits beneath the Gas Connection Site is currently unknown. 
Groundwater occurs in both the superficial and bedrock beneath the Gas Connection 
Site. 
4.3.6 
Natural Resource Wales (NRW) has designated the bedrock geology beneath the Gas 
Connection Site as a Secondary A aquifer with the superficial deposits designated a 
mixture of Secondary A aquifer and unproductive strata. Secondary A aquifers are 
permeable layers capable of supporting water supplies at a local rather than strategic 
scale and, in some cases, can form a vital source of base flow to rivers. Unproductive 
strata are rock layers or drift deposits with low permeability that have negligible 
significance for water supply or river base flow. Soils within the Gas Connection Site 
are variable, designated to have high, intermediate and low leachate potential. 
4.3.7 
Groundwater movement within the underlying geology is likely to be limited considering 
the aquifer designations as discussed above. Although the Gas Connection Site is 
elevated, shallow or perched groundwater within the superficial deposits is expected to 
be reasonably close to the surface and in hydraulic connectivity with the surface 
watercourses present within the Gas Connection Site and immediate surroundings.

4.3.8 
The objectives of the WFD have been used to assess the groundwater quality in the 
Gas Connection Site. The Carmarthen Carboniferous Coal Measures (Waterbody ID 
GB41002G200600) and Swansea Carboniferous Coal Measures (Waterbody ID 
GB410002G201000) are two WFD groundwater bodies within the study area (as 
illustrated in Figure 4.7). Information on their status regarding water quality is available 
from NRW Rivers and Waterbodies website (accessed October 2017). According to the 
NRW website, the current quantitative water quality for both the Carmarthen and 
Swansea water bodies is good and predicted to remain so beyond 2015, based on the 
most recent available data from 2015.  
4.3.9 
However, the overall 2015 Cycle 2 Status and current chemical quality for both 
Carmarthen Carboniferous Coal Measures and Swansea Carboniferous Coal 
Measures groundwater bodies are reported to be poor and are expected to remain so 
beyond 2015. There are no identified designated groundwater SPZs or drinking water 
Safeguard Zones with regards to agricultural activities within 1 km of the Gas 
Connection Site. Furthermore, information on the status of the Carmarthen and 
Swansea Carboniferous WFD groundwater bodies shows that they are not targeted for 
improvement within the Western Wales River Basin Management Plan (RBMP). 
4.3.10 
The Landmark Envirocheck report (Appendix 8.1) has identified no groundwater 
abstraction licences associated with the Gas Connection Site. The Landmark report 
identified only one licence located within 100 m of the Gas Connection Site, recorded 
56 m to the north-east for a well at Abergelli Farm, licence number 22/59/4/0027 dated 
February 1993, for general farming and domestic use. Recent data (received on 9 
October 2017) on private groundwater and abstraction licences received from CCS and 
NRW respectively did not identify this licence or any other licences within the 4 km of 
the Gas Connection Site.  
iii. Contaminated land 
4.3.11 
No intrusive site investigation has been completed to inform this assessment. However, 
as the majority of the Gas Connection Site is undeveloped, it is unlikely to have 
experienced significant potentially contaminative activities. Figure 4.8 shows current or 
historical potential pollution point/aerial sources within 1 km of the Gas Connection 
Site. It also includes historic landfill and industrial land use activities that have a higher 
potential for ground contamination such as the disused (inert) landfill site located 
approximately 100 m west of the Gas Connection, a coal mine north of Abergelli Farm 
and the Substation. 
4.3.12 
A mine spoil dump covered approximately three-quarters of the landfill area from the 
former Abergelli Colliery (Figure 4.8). This mine waste largely was removed leaving a 
layer of well compacted mine waste over the majority of the landfill area. Part of the 
ground that was covered by mine spoil was formerly used for drying out of water 
treatment sludge (aluminium sulphate) though this ceased when the landfill became 
operational. No further information regarding potential impacts to the water 
environment from this operation is known. 
iv. Surface water and groundwater features 
4.3.13 
There are both designated "ordinary" and "main" surface water bodies within the study 
area (as shown in Figures B2 and B3, Appendix B of FCA provided in Appendix 4.1). 
Within the Gas Connection Site, there are springs and spring-drainage rivulets and 
 Gas Connection Environmental Report 
 
Prepared for:  Abergelli Power Limited  
AECOM 
36 
 
drainage ditches that drain the Project Site into the Afon Llan River. The Afon Llan 
River catchment includes all of the Gas Connection Site.  
4.3.14 
There are three WFD classified surface water bodies (Figure 4.9) within the study area: 
the Afon Llan (Water body ID GB110058032070 to the south of the Gas Connection 
Site), the Afon Lliw (Water body ID GB110059032100 to the north of the Gas 
Connection Site) and the Loughor Estuary (Burry Inlet Inner) (Water body ID 
GB531005913500 located approximately 7 km south of the Gas Connection Site) into 
which these water bodies discharges.  
4.3.15 
The Afon Llan River is the closest WFD designated surface watercourse that traverses 
the immediate vicinity of the Gas Connection Site. It flows in a south-westerly direction 
and is designated as a Main River by NRW.  The Afon Llan links with the Afon Lliw and 
the River Loughor, which discharges into Carmarthen Bay.  The rivers will not be 
directly altered by the Gas Connection. 
4.3.16 
There is one WFD groundwater body (i.e. the Carmarthen Carboniferous Coal 
Measures Water body ID GB41002G200600) in the vicinity of the Gas Connection Site. 
This WFD water body is not targeted for improvements within the Western Wales 
RBMP. 
4.3.17 
Information about the current and predicted status of the Afon Llan River and the other 
designated WFD water bodies within the study area are available from NRW Cycle 2 
River and Waterbodies websites1 (accessed May 2017 and updated in June 2018) and 
is summarised in Table 4-6. Details of groundwater bodies are provided in Table 4-7.

4.3.18 
The Afon Lliw is located approximately 1.3 km north of the Gas Connection Site and 
has been assessed under the WFD. 
4.3.19 
There are other smaller watercourses in the vicinity of the Gas Connection Site that 
drain to the Afon Llan, along with some springs and small ponds.  
4.3.20 
Both the Afon Llan and Afon Lliw discharge to the Loughor Estuary west of Swansea, 
approximately 7 km from the Gas Connection Site. The Gas Connection Site lies 
outside of the Afon Lliw topographic catchment and therefore it is expected that any 
direct hydraulic connectivity will be limited. The Afon Llan does, however, join with the 
Afon Lliw approximately 9 km downstream of the Gas Connection Site. There may also 
be some potential for the cross-transfer of shallow groundwater flows between the two 
catchments. The Loughor Estuary has been assessed under the WFD. NRW has 
identified that the Loughor Estuary contains designated Shellfisheries. 
4.3.21 
No surface water abstraction points have been identified within the Gas Connection 
Site. The closest surface water abstractions, assumed to be from a tributary of the Afon 
Llan, have been identified approximately 1.6 km northeast and upstream of the Gas 
Connection Site.  Accordingly, no impact to this receptor is envisaged and it is not 
considered further in this assessment. 
4.3.22 
There are also a number of small drainage ditches and land drains which output into 
the ordinary watercourses and then the Afon Llan.   
v. Flood risk 
4.3.23 
There are no flood defence structures in the study area or Gas Connection Site. 
4.3.24 
The Gas Connection Site is outside the Development Advice Map (DAM) Zones and 
considered to be at very low risk of flooding i.e. DAM Zone A. Figure D1 in Appendix 
4.1 displays the flood zones and Project Site Boundary.   
4.3.25 
During the site visit, the area immediately south of the Gas Connection Site was 
notably saturated.  It is assumed that this area and the lower lying area to the south 
may be susceptible to groundwater or surface water flooding.  This is consistent with 
BGS groundwater flooding susceptibility mapping showing the area to the south of the 
Gas Connection Site as potential groundwater flooding at surface. 
4.3.26 
The literature review has not identified any historic incidents of flooding affecting the 
Gas Connection Site from any source.   
4.3.27 
The CCS Preliminary Flood Risk Assessments (PFRA) (2011) (Ref.5.2), Level 1 (2010) 
and Level 2 (2012) Strategic Flood Consequence Assessment (SFCA’s) do not report 
 Gas Connection Environmental Report 
 
Prepared for:  Abergelli Power Limited  
AECOM 
38 
 
any recorded flood events from groundwater sources within the CCS region.  The 
Flood Risk Management Plan (FRMP) (2015) indicates that there is a low risk of 
groundwater flooding across the CCS region (Ref.5.3). 
4.3.28 
NRW online maps show that reservoir flooding is not predicted to affect the Gas 
Connection Site.  This is relevant with respect to the upstream Lliw Reservoir. 
vi. Drainage 
4.3.29 
Most of the Gas Connection Site is undeveloped and surface water run-off flows 
overland and through field drains discharging into the Afon Llan. These field drains and 
drainage ditches can be seen to cross the Gas Connection Site and flow to the ordinary 
watercourses. The largest ordinary watercourse flows south along the east perimeter of 
the Gas Connection Site before discharging to the Afon Llan.   
4.3.30 
It has been identified that there are no foul sewers within the Gas Connection Site, and 
therefore assumed that the foul effluent from the nearby farm and residential properties 
discharge to cess pits and septic tanks.  
b) Potential Environmental Effects 
i. 
Construction  
4.3.31 
No effects for flooding have been identified during the construction phase for the Gas 
Connection. 
4.3.32 
From water quality and resources perspective, it is envisaged that the Gas Pipeline will 
not give rise to an increase in impermeable area within the Gas Connection Site and 
impact upon the surface water run-off regime for the Gas Connection. 
4.3.33 
Good practice management measures for the reduction and control of water pollution 
including works near water will be set out in the Surface Water Management Plan 
(WQ01) and Drainage Strategy - WQ02 and WQ03 of the Mitigation Register 
(Appendix 2.1). No additional mitigation measures have been proposed.   
ii. Operation 
4.3.34 
The only permanent structure constructed for the Gas Connection is the AGI at the 
connection to the National Gas Transmission System, which will change the infiltration 
capacity of the ground.   
4.3.35 
The total size of the AGI, including access spur road is approximately 0.3 hectares 
(ha).  The installation will have exposed plant on reinforced foundations with gravel 
surfacing in between.  It is anticipated that infrastructure will be identified to 
appropriately attenuate surface water runoff in order to maintain the equivalent 
greenfield runoff. No additional mitigation is proposed.    
4.4 
Air Quality

i. 
CCS Air Quality Monitoring and Reporting

Additionally CCS managed a network of diffusion tube monitoring sites focused on 
roadside locations mainly at busy junctions and along narrow and congested roads. 
The Gas Connection Site is at a rural location and therefore monitoring data from the 
NO2 diffusion tube network are not considered relevant to inform the air quality baseline 
at the Gas Connection Site.

ii. Defra Mapped Background Data 
4.4.4 
Defra has produced maps of background pollutant concentrations covering the whole 
of the UK for use by local authorities and consultants in the completion of Local Air 
Quality Monitoring (LAQM) reports and Air Quality Assessments where local 
background monitoring is unavailable or inappropriate for use.  The current maps are 
based on a background year of 2015 and provide background pollutant concentrations 
for NO2, PM10 and PM2.5 for each 1 km grid square within the UK for all years between 
2015 and 2030.  Defra also provides historic mapped estimates from 2001 for CO.  The 
mapped Defra NO2, PM10 and PM2.5 concentrations at the Gas Connection Site are 
presented in Table 4-12 for 2016.

Potential Environmental Effects 
i. 
Construction 
4.4.6 
The dust emission potential for construction of the Gas Connection is assessed as 
being large during earthworks due to the size of the corridor affected, which is 
approximately 1,400 m long and a maximum of 50 m wide, the number of earth moving 
machines that may be required and the volume of material that will be excavated to 
form the trench into which the Gas Pipeline will be laid. Construction emissions are 
classed as small which is considered to be conservative given the prefabricated nature 
of installing the Gas Pipeline. Emissions from trackout have a large dust potential due 
to the number of vehicles operating.  There is no demolition associated with this phase 
of the works.

4.4.7 
Table 4-14 sets out the assessment of dust emission class from demolition activities,

Good practice dust management will be set out within the Outline CEMP, GEN01 and 
AQ01 – AQ04 Mitigation Register (Appendix 2.1). No additional mitigation is therefore 
proposed. 
ii. Operation 
4.4.10 
No effects on air quality are expected during the operation phase. 
4.5 
Noise 
a) Baseline Conditions  
4.5.1 
This section describes the baseline environmental characteristics for the Gas 
Connection and surrounding areas with specific reference to noise and vibration. The 
baseline sound levels presented within this report were measured by AECOM in 
February 2018 (Appendix 5: Noise Survey) and summarised Table 4.15. 
4.5.2 
Representative background and ambient sound levels are summarised below in Table

Potential Environmental Effects  
i. 
Construction 
4.5.3 
This section sets out the preliminary assessment of the potential noise and vibration 
effects on sensitive receptors arising during the construction period.  
 Gas Connection Environmental Report 
 
Prepared for:  Abergelli Power Limited  
AECOM 
43 
 
4.5.4 
Noise levels experienced by local receptors during such works depend upon a number 
of variables, the most significant of which are: 
 
The noise generated by plant or equipment used on-site, generally expressed as 
Sound Power Levels (Lw) or the vibration generated by the plant; 
 
The periods of use of the plant on-site, known as its on-time;  
 
The distance between the noise/vibration source and the receptor; 
 
The noise attenuation due to ground absorption, air absorption and barrier effects;  
 
In some instances, the reflection of noise due to the presence of hard surfaces 
such as the sides of buildings; and 
 
The time of day or night the works are undertaken. 
4.5.5 
The predicted levels are given in Table 4-16 below.

The predicted indicative construction noise levels for the Gas Connection were below 
the lowest observable adverse effect level (LOAEL) level, apart from at NSR6 where a 
level just exceeding the LOAEL during the day time but significantly below the 
significant observable adverse effect level (SOAEL) is predicted.  
4.5.7 
No additional mitigation is proposed however good practice noise management is 
considered within N01- N09 Mitigation Register (Appendix 2.1) and Outline CEMP, 
GEN01. 
ii. Operation 
4.5.8 
No effects are anticipated during operation due to the nature of development.

4.6 
Landscape and Visual 
a) Baseline 
i. 
Landform 
4.6.1 
The Gas Connection Site is located within a valley with ground rising to the north, east 
and west which provides visual containment. Ground levels vary across the Gas 
Connection Site from approximately 145 m AOD in the north-west corner to 86 m AOD 
along the southern perimeter. Ground levels generally fall in a southerly and south 
easterly direction.  
ii. Movement and Connectivity 
4.6.2 
Junction 46 on the M4 lies approximately 2 km to the south of the Gas Connection Site 
providing immediate access to the strategic road network between London and South 
Wales. To the immediate north of Junction 46 lies the Felindre Park and Share at 
Brynwhilhach adjacent to the un-developed Felindre Business Park. A network of minor 
roads dissects the 5 km study area, connecting settlements and farmsteads. These are 
typically surrounded by earthbanks with hedgerow and tree planting which contains 
views along them and successfully integrates them into the wider landscape. The study 
area is well served with Public Rights of Way (PRoW) although not all are easily 
accessible nor do they appear to be regularly used. A section of the Gower Way, a long 
distance footpath through the Afon Lliw valley passes within approximately 2 km at its 
closest point to the northern boundary of the Gas Connection Site.  
iii. Land Use and Built Form 
4.6.3 
The Gas Connection Site is predominantly covered with pasture which is currently used 
for sheep and horse grazing, and broadleaf woodland which is classified in part as 
Ancient Woodland lies to the east of the Gas Connection Site. Fields across the Gas 
Connection Site are subdivided by ditches, remnant hedgerows and are interspersed 
with scrub vegetation. 
4.6.4 
Pastoral land and woodland are the predominant land uses within the wider valley, 
including Penllergaer Forest and other smaller broadleaved woodlands that are 
scattered throughout the valley. Combined with the network of hedgerows and 
hedgerow tree planting which define many of the small and irregular shaped fields as 
well as the network of minor roads, the landscape displays a well vegetated character. 
This character of woodland, rolling topography and visual containment helps integrate 
developments in the rural fabric. 
4.6.5 
To the southwest of the Gas Connection Site Boundary, there is the Access Road, 
National Grid Car Park, Substation and the Felindre Gas Compressor Station. Both the 
Substation and the Felindre Gas Compressor Station comprise large scale power 
infrastructure facilities characterised by tall industrial structures enclosed by security 
fencing and set within woodland planting. Pylons are prominent across the landscape 
and converge at the Substation.  
4.6.6 
A number of solar farms lie around the Gas Connection Site particularly to the north-
east and east as well as to the north-west. The Felindre Business Park adjacent to the 
Park and Share at Brynwhilhach has been partially constructed with service 
 Gas Connection Environmental Report 
 
Prepared for:  Abergelli Power Limited  
AECOM 
45 
 
infrastructure in place along with an outline landscape structure including stone walls 
and planting.   
4.6.7 
The main settlement in the 5 km study area is Swansea, with the northern edges of the 
city forming notable built form in the south and south eastern parts of the study area, 
approximately 2 km from the Gas Connection Site. The Driver and Vehicle Licensing 
Agency (DVLA) office block forms a prominent tall building and local landmark in many 
views that look south. Morriston hospital complex at Pant-lasau lies to the south-east of 
the Gas Connection Site with the settlement of Clydach extending to the east. 
Settlement locally is dispersed comprising small villages such as Felindre to the north-
west or scattered properties and farmsteads.  
iv. Landscape Designations 
4.6.8 
Landscapes can be given international, national, regional or local designations in 
recognition of their importance, outstanding scenic interest or attractiveness.  The 
Brecon Beacons National Park lies 12.8 km to the northern edge of the Gas 
Connection Site at its closest point. There is no theoretical visibility between the Gas 
Connection and the National Park and as such the Brecon Beacons National Park as a 
landscape receptor due to the distance and topography and is therefore is not 
considered further. 
4.6.9 
The Gower Area of Outstanding Natural Beauty (AONB) lies 9.1 km to the south-west 
of the Gas Connection Site. The Gower AONB was designated in 1956 for its classic 
limestone coast and the variety of natural habitats. The Gower’s scenery ranges from 
dune and salt marsh in the north to dramatic limestone cliffs along the south coast, 
interspersed by sandy beaches. Inland the hills of Cefn Bryn and Rhossili Down 
dominate the landscape of traditional small fields, wooded valleys and open commons. 
There is no theoretical visibility between the Gas Connection and the National Park and 
as such the Brecon Beacons National Park as a landscape receptor is not considered 
further. 
4.6.10 
SLAs are identified in the draft UDP within Policy ER 5: Landscape Protection and are 
identified on Figure 4.11. The Policy state states that priority will be given to protecting, 
managing and enhancing the character and quality of the three SLAs: 
 
Mawr Uplands; 
 
Lower Loughor Valley and Estuary and Southern part of the Burry Inlet; and 
 
North East Gower and Cockett Valley. 
4.6.11 
Within the SLAs, development will only be permitted where proposals include 
measures to protect, manage and enhance the character and quality of the particular 
landscape features for which the SLA has been designated. The aim of the Policy is to 
ensure that the character and quality of the County’s most valued landscapes are 
protected from inappropriate development and to encourage the management, 
enhancement and creation of key landscape features where possible. 
4.6.12 
There are four Country Parks within the wider landscape but all lie beyond the 15 km 
study area and do not experience any theoretical visibility.

b) 
Potential Environmental Effects 
i. 
Construction 
4.6.13 
The construction of the Gas Connection would result in temporary adverse effects as a 
result of the construction plant and activity involved in constructing the AGI along with 
an access road into it off the Rhyd-y-pandy road and the Gas Pipeline. The open trench 
method of constructing the Gas Pipeline would result in the temporary removal of 
grazing land and the permanent removal of sections of field boundary hedgerow and 
trees.  
4.6.14 
The temporary presence of construction plant, activities and lighting would introduce 
noticeable features uncharacteristic of the landscape at present.  
4.6.15 
No additional mitigation is proposed, but good practice landscape and visual 
management measures will be will be included within the Outline CEMP (GEN01) 
(Appendix 2.2) and LEMS (GEN02) (Appendix 2.3) of the Mitigation Register (Appendix 
2.1). 
ii. Operation 
4.6.16 
Post-construction, structure planting and reinstatement boundary vegetation will be 
planted around the AGI to assist in assimilating it within the immediate landscape 
pattern. Planting will extend up to existing field boundaries in order to retain the field 
pattern and avoid land severance.  
4.6.17 
Once the structure planting around the AGI establishes it will assist in providing some 
additional structure to the landscape which alongside the reinstatement of hedgerow 
planting and fields returned to grazing along the route of the Gas Pipeline, will assist in 
integrating the Gas Connection into the local landscape.  
4.6.18 
As a result of the embedded mitigation outlined above and further described in the 
Outline Landscape & Ecology Mitigation Strategy (LEMS) (GEN02) (Appendix 2.3) and 
LEMP, Figure 4.4, there would be no significant effects on the landscape character as a 
result of the Gas Connection. 
4.7 
Historic environment

i. 
Palaeolithic and Mesolithic (1,000,000 – 4000 BC) 
4.7.3 
Evidence for human activity during the Palaeolithic period is extremely sparse across 
Wales as a whole, with the principal find sites being concentrated on the Carboniferous 
Limestone zone of the south-west coast and north-east Wales. The known settlement 
sites in South Wales have been discovered within caves, with no open sites yet 
recognised. The coast of Gower has yielded several very significant sites, but there is 
nothing known closer to the Study Area, nor have any stray finds been recovered 
locally. Although the Mesolithic period is somewhat better represented across Wales as 
a whole, known sites in South East Wales are once again concentrated in coastal 
areas, with few discoveries made in inland locations. No Mesolithic sites or finds are 
known within the Study Areas (Ref.5.7). 
ii. Neolithic and Bronze Age (4000 – 700 BC) 
4.7.4 
The Neolithic period in Britain is differentiated from the preceding Mesolithic by the 
onset of a series of profound social, technological, and economic changes. The period 
coincides with the first domestication of animals and of cereal cultivation, and is 
accompanied by changes in material culture, including the development of ceramics 
and new lithic typologies. It was also a time when long-distance connections developed 
across Britain, Ireland and mainland Europe, alongside mechanisms of long-distance 
exchange, principally of lithic artefacts (Ref.5.8 and Ref.5.9). From this period the 
evidence for human activity increases significantly across Wales, and it becomes 
possible to discuss the Study Areas specifically, as opposed to merely the broader 
regional pattern.  
4.7.5 
Neolithic communities were the first to leave their mark prominently on the landscape 
through the construction of monuments, which have traditionally dominated 
interpretations of the period. The emergence of monumental architecture provides 
evidence for new forms of social organisation and complexity, including ritualised 
mortuary activity involving formal burial deposition, ceremonial practices and the 
construction of social and cultural identities. The range of monument types present in 
South Wales is narrower than in areas such as Wessex, but its uplands are 
characterised by numerous, highly visible Neolithic and Bronze Age funerary and ritual 
 Gas Connection Environmental Report 
 
Prepared for:  Abergelli Power Limited  
AECOM 
48 
 
monuments – principally but not exclusively in the form of cairns (Ref.5.10). The 
majority of cairns were funerary monuments, although some may have served as 
memorials or have marked territorial boundaries. Very many appear to have been 
located for dramatic effect, often on ridge crests or on the saddle of hills close to well-
travelled paths (Ref.5.11 and Ref.5.12). Others had utilitarian origins, having been 
formed by field clearance for agriculture: however, dating these latter features is difficult 
and some could plausibly relate to more recent times. 
4.7.6 
Within the Study Areas there are five cairns of presumed Neolithic to Bronze Age date 
that are designated as Scheduled Monuments. All are shown on Figure 4.13. These 
comprise a ring cairn on Craig Fawr (SM GM380), Pant-y-Ffa Round Cairn (SM 
GM201), Mynydd Pysgodlyn Round Barrow (SM GM202), Garn Goch Round Barrow 
(SM GM199), and a ring cairn on Tor Clawdd (SM GM353). The visual interrelationship 
of such monuments is a well-established theory as a key to understanding their 
positioning within the landscape. A study of a stone alignment at Bancbryn, located 
approximately 3 km north of Tor Clawdd (8 km from Project Site Boundary; not 
illustrated), posits (but cannot prove) that the inter-visibility between those stones and 
Hartland Point, on the north Devon Coast, is significant. Incorporated into this 
alignment is Tor Clawdd, which is framed to the left side of the Hartland Point 
(Ref.5.13). 
4.7.7 
There is no evidence for contemporary settlement within the Study Areas. 
iii. Iron Age (700 BC – AD 43) 
4.7.8 
The society that emerged in the Late Bronze Age and Iron Age was markedly different 
from its predecessor. The emergence of the hillfort points to a changing emphasis in 
the settlement pattern and to a radically altered social dynamic.   
4.7.9 
Although hillforts are the dominant monument of the period within the modern 
landscape, they are known to have existed in conjunction with wider undefended rural 
settlement, of which traces are mostly ephemeral and easily destroyed by cultivation. 
As Lynch et al. comment, ‘though overshadowed by the hillforts, the lightly enclosed or 
open farmstead must have shared a close relationship with their more impressive 
counterparts’ (Ref.5.11). Given this situation, it is reasonable to assume some level of 
settlement in the area, although its character and location remains unknown. 
4.7.10 
A probable Iron Age site is located within the 1 km Study Areas, located 1.5 km to the 
west of the Project Site Boundary, as shown in Figure 4.12 and 4.13. This is Scheduled 
Monument (SM GM308), which comprises an oval enclosure measuring c. 90 m x 60 
m, defined by a wide earthen bank that stands up to 1 m high in places. Its date is 
unproven but its morphology suggests it belongs to the Iron Age, with either a 
defensive and/or settlement function. The monument, now standing within woodland, is 
well preserved and retains considerable archaeological potential. 
iv. Roman (AD 43 – AD 410) 
4.7.11 
The Study Areas are removed from the main framework of Roman forts and roads in 
the region, which developed during the conquest of South Wales between 47 and 77 
AD (Ref.5.14 and Ref.5.15). Forts were established at Coelbren, Neath, Loughor and 
Carmarthen, connected by a road network that can, in part, still be traced in the 
modern landscape (Ref.5.16). The remains of two Roman practice camps are known

within the 5 km Study Area, 4.6 km south of the Project Site Boundary, on Mynydd 
Carn Goch (SM GM269).  
4.7.12 
A re-analysis of the rural evidence may challenge the widely held belief that the 
indigenous population was largely untouched by the Romans (Ref.5.17). However, 
identifiably Roman sites are entirely absent from the 1 km Study Area, although a 
continuity of native occupation must be assumed throughout this period and into the 
immediate post-Roman era. 
v. Medieval (AD 410 – AD 1540) 
4.7.13 
The early medieval period in South Wales is broadly characterised by the emergence 
of distinct regional kingdoms, and of Christianity, with the possibility of some level of 
Viking depredation (Ref.5.14). Archaeologically, the period is very poorly evidenced, 
and no settlement sites of this era are known within the Study Areas – although it is 
possible that some Anglo-Norman and medieval Welsh sites may have earlier origins. 
One possible monument belonging to this period is the base of a stone cross within 
Llangyfelach churchyard, 1.7 km south of the Project Site Boundary (SM GM299). 
Though not precisely dated, stylistically it would appear to belong to the early medieval 
period. 
4.7.14 
Evidence from the later medieval period in South Wales (i.e. after the Norman 
Conquest of the region) is far more abundant. No certain medieval sites are known 
within the Gas Connection Site or 1 km Study Area, but Pen y Fedw (PRN 01525w) is 
suggested to have its origins in the 14th century (Ref.5.18), although the evidence 
supporting this assertion is unclear. Assuming some degree of continuity, some of the 
other post-medieval farms in the district could reasonably be assumed to have earlier 
origins.  
4.7.15 
Within the 5 km Study Area, the scheduled earthwork known as Cae Castell is probably 
medieval in date and, on the basis of its place-name, quite possibly defensive in 
character (SM GM439). Meanwhile, the tower of the St David’s church, Llangyfelach, is 
the likely standing remains of a former 14th-century church that stood within the 
curtilage of the present churchyard (LB 26236). 
4.7.16 
The present-day agricultural field pattern was largely established by the beginning of 
the 18th century, as evidenced by the 2”:1 mile map of Glamorgan and Monmouthshire 
(1812-14; Ref.5.19). Of particular interest on this map are the hedgerows identified in 
this assessment as AB03 and AB04, both of which are within the Gas Connection Site. 
The date at which the field pattern as a whole began to develop is not known, but it is 
possible that some parts may have medieval origins. 
vi. Post-medieval (AD 1540 – AD 1901) 
4.7.17 
Within the 1 km Study Area, the earliest forms of post-medieval remains appear to be 
predominately of domestic and agricultural purpose. One example (albeit immediately 
outside the 1 km Study Area) is Cynghordy Fawr (PRN 02750w), which is located in the 
north-east of the Study Area. This building is fairly typical of the architectural style of 
this period, comprising a 17th-century longhouse with a courtyard and further ranges 
including a stable block and granary. 
4.7.18 
George Yates’ Map of Glamorgan, dated 1799 (Ref.5.20), shows ‘Abergelly Fach’ 
(AB02) as an isolated farm building, disconnected from a north/south aligned lane that 
 Gas Connection Environmental Report 
 
Prepared for:  Abergelli Power Limited  
AECOM 
50 
 
cuts across the north-western corner of the Project Site Boundary. A map of 
Glamorganshire (1812-14, Ref.5.19) depicts the same farm as comprising two north-
east/south-west aligned rectangular buildings set within their own grounds, and 
connected to the existing north/south aligned lane via a short driveway. To the east of 
AB02 is the farmstead of ‘Abergelly-fawr’ (AB01), featuring at least two buildings and 
an associated connecting lane to the north. The remaining land is shown as an 
enclosed field system, which includes boundaries AB03 and AB04, located immediately 
north of Abergelly-fach.  
4.7.19 
By the time of the surveying of the Llangyfelach Tithe Map of 1838 (Ref.5.21), new field 
boundaries had been created and the fields made smaller and more irregular in shape. 
Boundaries AB03 and AB04 remained intact, forming the southern boundary of three 
irregular fields to the east of ‘Abergelly fach’ (AB01). The field systems depicted on the 
tithe map can also been seen on Ordnance Survey (OS) map of 1883-1884 (Ref.5.22). 
By this time ‘Abergelli-fach’ (AB02) had expanded, comprising a farmstead of at least 
six buildings. The most significant development is the establishment of a large 
plantation in the south-east of the Project Site Boundary. The subsequent OS edition of 
1897 (Ref.5.23) names the plantation as ‘Abergelli-fach Plantation’. A quarry (PRN 
01349w) is depicted for the first time, and is labelled as a ‘gravel pit’ immediately south-
west of AB02.  
4.7.20 
In the early post-medieval period the population of the larger Swansea area began to 
decline as the administrative centre for the region moved to Cardiff (Ref.5.24). This 
decline reversed in the early 18th century as the transport of materials for use in 
industry such as coal and metals along the River Tawe became essential. The River 
Tawe was a vital trade route during the 18th and 19th centuries at the time when 
Swansea became renowned as a copper smelting centre with such works as the Hafod 
Copperworks (PRN 05956w) and the Landore Copperworks (PRN 01586w). 
Swansea’s copper industry rose to prominence in the 18th century. Llangyfelach 
Copperworks (NPRN 34094), established in 1717, was the first of the major Swansea 
copperworks; its site is located beyond the 5 km Study Area, at the junction of Cwm 
Level Road and Neath Road to the north of Landore viaduct (Ref.5.25).  
4.7.21 
No copper-working sites are known within the 1 km Study Area, but several sites attest 
to the supporting coal-mining industries which grew up in Swansea’s hinterland. 
Collieries established during this period within the Study Area include Bryn Whilach 
Colliery (PRN 01340w) and an unnamed colliery at Mawr (PRN 01345w).  
4.7.22 
Industrial transport networks are also evidenced. In 1798, the Swansea Canal was 
opened, serving to increase the industrial capacity of the area, such that at one stage 
in the 19th century, three quarters of the world’s copper ore was being transported to 
Swansea for processing (Ref.5.25). The century following the canal’s construction saw 
the city’s population grow from approximately 10,000 people to 95,000 people. 
Transport routes were established over land not only to supply the copperworks with 
raw materials but also to link the mines and collieries with the works and ports. Within 
the 1 km Study Area these include a tramroad (PRN 05950.0w) linking Bryn-whilach 
and Pen-rhiwfelen coal pits to Clydach Road, a mineral railway (PRN 03017.0w) 
situated within the community of Llangyfelach, and now a dismantled railway (PRN 
02916.0w) serving Felindre Pit on the east side of the Lliw Valley.

vii. Modern (1901-present) 
4.7.23 
Due to the availability of cheaper copper and coal from overseas, the industrial 
prosperity of the South Wales region began to decline in the early 20th century 
(Ref.5.25). Throughout this period Swansea still remained a centre of industry within 
South Wales, with a population at the time of the outbreak of World War II of 167,000 
people (Ref.5.27). The Velindre works (PRN 02905w; 0.8 km south of the Project Site 
Boundary) was built as part of a post-war development programme begun after the 
Steel Company of Wales was formed in 1947. In 1952 the company started work on the 
construction of a cold reduction and electrolytic tinning plant at the site near 
Llangyfelach. The Velindre works began production in October 1956. The main 
building, the Mill Bay, was of very significant size: 1440 ft long, 100 ft wide and 66 ft 
high. It was closed down in September 1989 and its buildings were subsequently 
demolished. 
4.7.24 
One historic asset immediately to the west of the Project Site Boundary originates in 
this period: Abergelli Colliery (NPRN 80607). When first shown on the OS map of 1931 
(Ref.5.28), it comprised a water tank, engine houses, a slant (slanted shaft), and a 
tramway or railway following a course from the slant to a slag heap at the north end of 
the colliery site. The colliery worked the Four Feet and Graigola (also known as the 
Brynwhilach) coal seams and was a registered colliery from 1926 to 1960 The owner, 
up to nationalisation, was the Graigola Merthyr Co. Ltd and it was worked in 
association with Clydach Merthyr Colliery located at Craig Cefn Parc, approximately 
2.5 km north-east of the Project Site Boundary (Ref.5.29). 
4.7.25 
Aerial photographs of the area taken in 1970 (Ref.5.30) show the addition of an 
electrical substation to the south-west of Abergelli Farm. The next significant changes 
to the Project Site are shown on aerial photographs taken in 2008; these reflect the 
construction of the Felindre Gas Compressor Station. The photographs show that the 
works included the installation of the Oil Pipeline from the road to the north of Abergelli 
farm, traversing the fields to the east and south of the farm, to the Substation, which 
extends over much of the Abergelli fach Plantation. As a part of this development, a 
section of historic field boundary AB03 was removed for Oil Pipeline easement. 
4.7.26 
Aerial photographs of 2010 show this complex being extended southwards. By 2015, 
much of the land to the east of the farm had been utilised for solar panels (Ref.5.30). 
viii. Historic landscape characterisation 
4.7.27 
The Gas Connection Site area lies in Landmap Historic Landscape Aspect Area H27 
(Gower Supraboscus Agricultural). This is characterised by an irregular fieldscape with 
hedgerows and hedgebanks, reflecting a history of gradual and piecemeal enclosure in 
the valleys and foothills throughout the medieval and post-medieval periods. There is 
some evidence for enclosure in the pre-Norman period, and the process continued into 
the second half of the 19th century. Some unenclosed land and woodland remains. 
Limited industrial activity (mainly mining) also took place here in the 19th century and 
has left residual traces in the landscape. The settlement pattern is predominantly of 
dispersed character, but ribbon developments occur in areas of former industrial 
activity.

ix. Previous Investigations 
4.7.28 
A watching brief was undertaken by Cambrian Archaeological Projects (Ref.5.31) 
during groundworks associated with the construction of a high pressure gas pipeline 
between Felindre and Brecon. The watching brief was carried out within part of the Gas 
Connection Site through the fields to the east of Abergelli Farm. A single pit was noted 
and revealed evidence of in situ burning, which was potentially the remains of a hearth 
or furnace. It measured 1.5 m in diameter and was 0.2 m in depth. No date was 
ascertained for this feature. The site of this feature was located to the south of Abergelli 
farm at NGR SN 65136 01433, approximately 100 m outside of the Gas Connection 
Site.   
4.7.29 
Archaeological watching briefs undertaken by Cotswold Archaeology during the 
construction of the Oil Pipeline in the northern extent of the Gas Connection Site 
revealed two undated charcoal spreads. Elsewhere, two pits with charcoal and burnt 
stone were exposed, and were associated with a spread of burnt material containing 
two worked, undated, flints. An evaluation at Waun y Garnwen, forming part of the 
same scheme of works, recorded four probable former field boundaries (Ref.5.32).  
4.7.30 
A geophysical survey in the area immediately to the east of the Gas Connection Site 
was undertaken in advance of the installation of a solar energy farm. The works 
identified probable soil-filled features in most of the survey areas, and concluded that 
although some of the anomalies were weak or diffuse, most have potential to reflect the 
remains of archaeological features (Ref.5.33). 
4.7.31 
On the south-east fringe of the 1 km Study Area, a watching brief was undertaken by 
Oxford Archaeology within the grounds of Morriston Hospital prior to the development 
of new parking facilities. A linear field boundary and ornamental features relating to the 
garden of the former Maes y Gwernen Hall were recorded (Ref.5.34). 
b) Potential Environmental Effects 
i. 
Construction  
4.7.32 
Construction of the Gas Connection will not have a significant physical impact on any 
known historic asset.  
4.7.33 
The Gas Pipeline will cross the line of historic boundary AB03, necessitating the 
removal of a portion of this feature for the construction working width of the Gas 
Pipeline. However, only a small percentage of this feature is affected – and this was 
substantially altered when the preceding Oil Pipeline was installed, with little of the 
original historic fabric remaining.  
4.7.34 
The construction working width of the Gas Pipeline will also run parallel to historic 
boundary AB04, which coincides with the western limit of the Project Site boundary. 
However, this feature is 25 m from the Gas Pipeline centreline, and thus beyond the 
limits of the pipe easement. There will be no effect upon this feature. No additional 
mitigation is proposed.  
4.7.35 
Archaeological investigation including a Written Scheme of Investigation (WSI) (CH01 
and CH02) will be undertaken which is included as embedded mitigation. No additional 
mitigation is proposed. 
ii. Operation 
 Gas Connection Environmental Report 
 
Prepared for:  Abergelli Power Limited  
AECOM 
53 
 
4.7.36 
Operation of the Gas Connection will not have an impact upon any known historic 
asset, therefore no mitigation is required.

Traffic, Transport and Access  
a) Baseline Conditions

i. 
Access Locations 
4.8.3 
There will be two access points for the Project Site which are both described below, 
and located in Figure 2:  
1. 
A privately maintained ‘Access Road’ from the B4489. This will serve the Project 
Site during the construction and operation phase. The Access Road comprises of 
an existing road from the B4489 to the Swansea North Substation, which will be 
upgraded as required, and a new section of Access Road from the Substation to 
the Generating Equipment Site. This Access Road is being consented separately 
as part of the DCO Application; and 
2. 
The ‘AGI Access’ will connect the AGI to the Rhyd-y-Pandy Road by upgrading an 
existing double gated agricultural access point. The AGI Access will be used only 
for maintenance access to the AGI during operation. The AGI Access is included in 
this TCPA application.  
ii. Local Highway Network 
4.8.4 
The local highway network is presented in Figure 4.14. The existing section of Access 
Road between the B4489 and Substation is unlit. The width of the Access Road varies 
along its length between 3.5 m and 7.5 m, and is generally bordered by trees and 
intermittent hedgerows. The Access Road connects to the B4489 via a simple priority 
junction. This is characterised by large radii on the minor arm (the Access Road) to 
accommodate Heavy Goods Vehicle (HGV) movements.  
 Gas Connection Environmental Report

4.8.5 
The B4489 routes between the village of Felindre to the north (approximately 2.3 km 
from the Access Road) and the M4 Junction 46 to the south (approximately 1.8 km 
from the Access Road). The B4489 is subject to a 40 mph speed limit at its junction 
with the Access Road. At this location, the road has a 5.5 m wide carriageway and is 
unlit. Approximately 330 m to the north of the Access Road, the B4489 becomes 
subject to the national speed limit. The B4489 continues a further 1.7 km north where it 
connects to Rhyd-y-Pandy Road at a priority junction. This section of the B4489 is unlit 
and ranges in width between 4.5 m and 5.5 m, with numerous passing places. The 
junction with Rhyd-y-Pandy Road and its approaches are subject to a 30 mph speed 
limit. Rhyd-y-Pandy Road routes east for 1.6 km where it passes the northern extent of 
the Project Boundary. This section of Rhyd-y-Pandy Road is unlit and ranges in width 
between 4.5 m and 5.5 m, with numerous passing places. It is subject to a 30 mph 
speed limit, increasing to the national speed limit around 900 m east of its junction with 
the B4489. It also serves the Felindre Water Treatment Works. 
4.8.6 
Approximately 475 m to the south of the Access Road, the B4489 is street lit. A further 
75 m south from this point, the B4489 forms a three-arm roundabout with the access to 
the Felindre Park and Share. 
4.8.7 
The B4489 forms a dumbbell roundabout with the M4 Junction 46. The northern 
dumbbell roundabout junction comprises three arms; the B4489 and the eastbound 
on/off-slips of the M4. The southern dumbbell roundabout junction comprises six arms; 
the A48 (three arms), the B4489 Swansea Road, and the westbound on/off-slips of the 
M4. The south-eastern arm of the A48 forms a mini-roundabout junction with Pant 
Lasau Road approximately 90 m southeast of the southern dumbbell roundabout. 
These junctions are subject to a 40 mph speed limit and are lit. 
iii. Highway Operational Conditions 
4.8.8 
An Automatic Traffic Count (ATC) survey was undertaken on the B4489 between the 
Access Road and the roundabout junction with the Felindre Park and Share. The 
survey was undertaken between Thursday 16th October 2014 and Wednesday 22nd 
October 2014. The traffic flow information for an average weekday is summarised in 
Table 4-19. Growth factors have been applied to the 2014 data to represent conditions 
in 2017.

4.8.9 
Table 4-19 shows that, on an average weekday, the B4489 carries approximately 130 
vehicles during the AM peak hour, 90 vehicles during the PM peak hour, and 1,000 
vehicles over the 24-hour period. HGVs account for no more than 2% of total traffic. 
4.8.10 
Junction Turning Count (JTC) surveys were also undertaken on Thursday 16th October 
2014 at the following junctions in the study area network: 
 
M4 Junction 46 Northern Dumbell Roundabout; 
 
M4 Junction 46 Southern Dumbell Roundabout; and 
 
A48/Pant Lasau Road Mini-Roundabout. 
4.8.11 
The traffic survey data is reproduced in Appendix 7.1. The 2014 traffic flows at the 
surveyed locations during the weekday AM and PM peak hours are shown on Figures 
4.15 and 4.16 respectively. Growth factors have been applied to represent traffic flows 
in 2017, as shown on Figures 4.17 and 4.18 respectively. 
4.8.12 
The surveyed junctions have been modelled using the TRL software program 
‘Junctions 9’. They have been modelled as a linked network in view of their proximity to 
each other. This has required the use of the lane simulation tool, which only provides 
outputs for queuing and delay. The capacity assessment results for 2017 during the 
weekday AM and PM peak hours are summarised in  
4.8.13 
Table 4-20.  
4.8.14 
These are shown for the entry arms to the network (listed clockwise from the northern 
arm of the B4489) and exclude the internal links. The capacity assessment output 
reports are reproduced in Appendix 7.2.

Table 4-20 shows that, during the AM peak hour, the highest levels of queuing and 
delay are experienced on the M4 eastbound and westbound off-slips, followed by the 
A48 (Southwest) and B4489 (South). During the PM peak hour, levels of queuing and 
delay are significantly lower across the junction, with Pant Lasau Road and the A48 
(Southeast) experiencing the highest levels of queuing and delay. 
4.8.16 
On-site observations carried out by AECOM during the AM peak hour on Tuesday 21st 
November 2017 suggests that the M4 Junction 46 is operating well within capacity. At 
the time of the observational visit, it was apparent that the queues reported by the 
modelling were not present at that time. This is particularly the case for the M4 off-slips,

which appeared to be free flowing or with minimal queuing. The modelling is therefore 
considered to represent a ‘worst-case’ of existing conditions at the junctions. 
4.8.17 
The analyses was carried out as part of this section will be based upon the previously 
observed traffic flows and queues and will therefore be a robust assessment of this part 
of the network. 
iv. Road Safety 
4.8.18 
A review of PIC data has been undertaken to determine whether there are any 
locations on the local highway network with poor collision records. 
4.8.19 
The data was obtained from CCS for the three-year period from 1st October 2014 to 
30th September 2017 (the most recent three-year period for which data was available). 
The reports for each of the PICs recorded in the study area together with a plan 
showing the location of each PIC (these are not included in this ES for data protection 
reasons). 
4.8.20 
A total of 25 PICs were recorded in study area over the three-year period, of which 
three were ‘serious’. The remaining 22 PICs were all ‘slight’. No ‘fatal’ PICs were 
recorded in the study area. For ease of analysis the PICs have been separated into 
those occurring at junctions and on links in the study area. The following account of the 
events which led to a PIC was taken from the records provided. 
PICs at Junctions 
4.8.21 
One ‘slight’ PIC was recorded at the M4 Junction 46 Northern Dumbbell Roundabout. 
This involved a collision between a vehicle entering the roundabout and a vehicle 
already on the roundabout. 
4.8.22 
Four ‘slight’ PICs were recorded at the A48/Pant Lasau Road Mini-Roundabout. These 
all involved a collision between a vehicle entering the mini-roundabout and a vehicle 
already on the roundabout. These types of collisions are not uncommon on mini-
roundabouts, due to the limited separation between entry arms. Further analysis has 
been undertaken of the listed causation factors for the PICs (these cannot be explicitly 
stated here for data protection reasons); this has not identified any highway defects 
contributing to these PICs. 
4.8.23 
One ‘serious’ PIC was recorded at the M4 Junction 46 Southern Dumbbell 
Roundabout. This involved a vehicle on the M4 westbound off-slip losing control and 
colliding with a tree on the central roundabout island. 
PICs Recorded on Links 
4.8.24 
One ‘slight’ PIC was recorded on the B4489, south of its junction with Rhyd-y-pandy 
Road. This involved a collision between two vehicles on a bend; one vehicle was 
travelling northbound, and the other vehicle was travelling southbound. 
4.8.25 
Three ‘slight’ PICs were recorded on the M4 eastbound, between the off and on slips of 
the M4 Junction 46. Two of these PICs involved vehicles losing control, and the 
remaining PIC involved a rear-end shunt collision. 
4.8.26 
Two ‘slight’ PICs were recorded on the M4 eastbound, east of the M4 Junction 46, both 
of which involved rear-end shunt collisions.

4.8.27 
Two ‘slight’ PICs were recorded on the M4 westbound, east of the M4 Junction 46. 
These involved a rear-end shunt collision, and a collision between two vehicles as one 
vehicle was changing lanes. 
4.8.28 
One ‘slight’ PIC was recorded on the M4 westbound off-slip. This involved a vehicle 
losing control and leaving the carriageway. 
4.8.29 
Three ‘PICs’ were recorded on the M4 westbound, between the off and on slips of the 
M4 Junction 46. The ‘serious’ PIC involved a vehicle losing control after entering the 
drainage system. The ‘slight’ PICs involved a rear-end shunt collision, and a vehicle 
losing control and colliding with the central barrier. 
4.8.30 
One ‘slight’ PIC was recorded on the M4 eastbound, west of the M4 Junction 46. This 
involved a rear-end shunt collision. 
4.8.31 
Two ‘slight’ PICs were recorded on the M4 eastbound off-slip. One of the PICs involved 
a vehicle losing control, colliding with the barrier and overturning. No description was 
provided for the remaining PIC. 
4.8.32 
One ‘slight’ PIC was recorded on the A48 between the M4 Junction 46 Southern 
Dumbbell Roundabout and the A48/Pant Lasau Road Mini-Roundabout. This involved 
a vehicle travelling southeast-bound entering the opposite side of the carriageway and 
colliding with an oncoming vehicle. 
4.8.33 
One ‘serious’ PIC was recorded on Pant Lasau Road, northeast of the A48/Pant Lasau 
Road Mini-Roundabout. This involved a collision between a vehicle and a pedestrian 
that had entered the carriageway. 
4.8.34 
One ‘slight’ PIC was recorded on the A48, southeast of the A48/Pant Lasau Road Mini-
Roundabout. This involved a collision between a vehicle performing a u-turn and 
another vehicle. 
4.8.35 
One ‘slight’ PIC was recorded on the A48, southwest of the M4 Junction 46. This 
involved a collision between a vehicle pulling off from the side of the carriageway and a 
vehicle travelling southwest-bound. 
Summary 
4.8.36 
Overall, the analysis of the PIC data and listed causation factors has not identified any 
existing highway safety issues in the study area. Where PICs have been recorded, 
these have been identified as being as a result of causation factors relating to 
driver/road user error and weather conditions. No causation factors relating to highway 
defects have been reported in the PIC data. 
v. Walking and Cycling 
4.8.37 
The walking and cycling facilities and PRoW are shown on Figure 4.19. 
4.8.38 
There are no footways that serve the Project Site. The nearest footways are on the 
B4489, approximately 475m south of the Access Road (on the approach to the junction 
with the Felindre Park and Share. This footway continues to the M4 Junction 46. The 
500 m section of the footway to the north of the M4 Junction 46 is separated from the 
carriageway edge by a barrier. At the M4 Junction 46 the footways continues south 
along the east side of the carriageway, serving the southern arms of the southern 
dumbbell roundabout, with dropped kerbs and tactile paving to facilitate crossing 
movements across entry arms.

4.8.39 
There are no formal cycling routes in the vicinity of the Project Site. Part of the B4489 
is identified as an ‘advisory cycling route’ on the CCS’s cycle map. This covers the 
section of the B4489 that routes north from the Access Road to Felindre and to a point 
approximately 475 m south of the Access Road.  
4.8.40 
There are numerous PRoW crossing/in the vicinity of the Project Site. Footpaths LC34 
and LC117 cross the Access Road (and the new section of Access Road) at points 
approximately 350 m and 1.3 km from the B4489. Footpath LC35B passes through the 
Gas Connection Site, connecting to Rhyd-y-Pandy Road in the vicinity of the AGI 
Access. 
vi. Public Transport 
4.8.41 
The nearest bus stop to the Project Site is the ‘Lliw Reservoirs’ stop located on Rhyd-y-
pandy Road. This is situated to the east of Felindre and approximately 500 m to the 
northwest of the northern extent of the Project Site boundary. There is no footway 
between the Project Site and this bus stop. It provides access to Service 142, which 
routes between Morriston and Garnswllt. This service is operated Community Transport 
for the Dulais, Afan, Neath, Swansea and Amman Valley areas. There are three to four 
services per day in each direction, although these can generally only be pre-booked. 
4.8.42 
Service 141 passes to the south of the Project Site, routeing between Gorseinon and 
Morriston. The nearest stop that provides access to this service is the ‘Pant Lasau 
Cross’ stop located on Mynydd Gelli Wastad Road. It is situated approximately 750 m 
to the southeast of the southern extent of the Project Site boundary and can be 
accessed via Footpath LC117. 
4.8.43 
There are no railway stations in the vicinity of the Project Site. Llansamlet railway 
station is situated approximately 5.5 km southeast of the Project Site, accessible by car 
via the A48 (from M4 Junction 44 and 46). Swansea railway station is a further 7 km 
from the Project Site; this is a key local transport hub and is more easily accessible by 
public transport. Swansea railway station is managed by Arriva Trains Wales. There are 
four services daily from Swansea to Shrewsbury; an hourly service from Swansea to 
Manchester Piccadilly, which calls at Cardiff Central; and a total of two to three services 
hourly from Swansea to Cardiff Central. Great Western Railway also provides services 
from Swansea to London Paddington, calling at Bristol Parkway. 
4.8.44 
Overall, the opportunities to access the Project Site by public transport are limited, and 
it is therefore considered that, for the purposes of this assessment, no trips by 
construction, maintenance and permanent staff will be undertaken by these modes. 
vii. Parking 
4.8.45 
Felindre Park and Share is accessed from the B4489, approximately 550 m south of 
the Access Road. It is located on the site of the proposed Felindre Business Park. It 
has capacity for 480 spaces and its use is encouraged for employees of the Driver and 
Vehicle Licensing Agency (DVLA) Headquarters (HQ) in Clase. A shuttle bus service 
runs between the Felindre Park and Share and the DVLA. There are no other parking 
facilities in the study area. The Felindre Park and Share is understood to be managed 
by the DVLA and will not be available for use by the Project.

The level of increase in HGV traffic associated with the Gas Connection on the 
pedestrian experience on these links is not significant. Minimal pedestrian movement 
has been observed at these locations, which is typical given the nature of the strategic 
access junction. It is also likely that any pedestrians at these locations will already be 
accustomed to the levels of general traffic and HGVs. 
4.8.52 
No additional mitigation is proposed however traffic management will be covered within 
a CTMP and CSTP, T01 – T05 of the Mitigation Register (Appendix 2.1). 
Driver Delay

Table 4-26 shows that, during the AM peak hour, the entry arms of the M4 westbound 
off-slip and Pant Lasau Road will experience a change of up to 17% which is not 
considered significant.  The B4489 (North and South) and the M4 eastbound off-slip will 
experience a beneficial effects; this is as a result of changes in the balance of traffic 
flows at the junction, which will result in more gaps for traffic exiting from this arm as 
priorities are changed. This will result in a reduction in the level of delay of the arm 
benefitting from traffic flow balancing and an increase in arms which are forced to 
concede priority more than before flows were balanced.  
4.8.55 
Table 4-27 shows that, during the PM peak hour, all entry arms will experience a 
change of up to 5% which is not considered significant. This effect will be temporary in 
nature, and only experienced during the peak of construction traffic movements. 
4.8.56 
No additional mitigation is proposed, but management measures to minimise driver 
delay will be included within a CTMP and CSTP, T01 – T05 of the Mitigation Register 
(Appendix 2.1).  
ii. Operation 
4.8.57 
For maintenance activities during the operation phase, vehicles will use the AGI 
Access. The traffic generation is expected to be minimal (approximately 2 vehicles per 
month), therefore no embedded mitigation is required, or additional mitigation.  
4.9 
Geology and Ground Conditions 
a) Baseline Conditions 
4.9.1 
This section describes the baseline environmental characteristics for the Gas 
Connection Site and surrounding areas with specific reference to geology, ground

conditions and hydrogeology. The study area for this section is the Project Site 
Boundary. 
4.9.2 
This assessment has been undertaken using desk based information currently 
available including the Landmark Envirocheck Report (dated October 2017 and 
presented in Appendix 8.1) and the Preliminary Geo-Environmental Risk Assessment 
for Abergelli Power Project (Appendix 8.2), and a site walkover undertaken in July 
2014.   
i. 
Geological information  
4.9.3 
The baseline geology, ground conditions and hydrogeology data of the Gas Connection 
Site has been gathered from the following sources: 
 
Landmark Information Group Envirocheck Report. Presented in  Appendix 8.1;             
 
Preliminary Geo-Environmental Risk Assessment from Abergelli Power Project 
(Appendix 8.2); and   
 
BGS.  Digital Geological map of Great Britain at 1:50,000 scale (Ref.5.35).                            
Made Ground 
4.9.4 
There is no Made Ground indicated within the Gas Connection Site, based on 
published BGS records. Made Ground is only considered to be likely to be present an 
areas associated with previous development such as the landfill and colliery. It may 
also be present if the landowner undertook land levelling. If any Made Ground is 
present within the Gas Connection Site, its composition and provenance would be 
unknown.   
Superficial Geology 
4.9.5 
There are three types of superficial deposits identified across the Gas Connection Site 
comprising: glacial diamicton till, glaciofluvial deposits of sand and gravel and 
quaternary peat.  
4.9.6 
The BGS indicates that there are three boreholes located in Gas Connection Site, 
however only one is available to view online and presented in Appendix 8.3.  The 
borehole log is located east of Abergelli Farm in an area mapped as being underlain by 
Devensian glaciofluvial deposits of sand and gravel. 
4.9.7 
The borehole log indicates superficial deposits comprising yellow brown sandy gravelly 
clay down to 6.4 metres below ground level (mbgl), overlying grey brown clayey 
gravelly sand, clayey sand and sandy clay down to 15.8 mbgl considered to be 
representative of glaciofluvial deposits. These are underlain by firm yellow clay 
becoming stiff grey gravelly clay described in the log as possible boulder clay which is 
likely to be glacial till; proven to a maximum depth of 16.8 mbgl. Traces of coal were 
identified at 10.7 mbgl within the clayey sand. 
Bedrock Geology 
4.9.8 
The bedrock geology underlying the Gas Connection Site consists of the Grovesend 
Formation of the South Wales Upper Coal Measures Formation, comprising 
argillaceous mudstones and siltstones, with well-developed coals, and minor lithic 
sandstones. The BGS (Ref.5.36) indicates that the Grovesend Formation is the 
youngest unit found in the South Wales coalfield.  
 Gas Connection Environmental Report 
 
Prepared for:  Abergelli Power Limited  
AECOM 
64 
 
4.9.9 
The north eastern corner of the 1 km search buffer surrounding the Gas Connection is 
underlain by the Swansea Member, comprising green-grey Pennant Sandstone, with 
thin mudstone/siltstone and seatearth interbeds and (mainly thin) coals. This geological 
formation is overlain conformably by the Grovesend Formation. 
4.9.10 
The Preliminary Geo-Environmental Risk Assessment (Ref.5.37) indicates that there 
was a ‘Slant’ (inclined shaft or level) identified at Abergelli Colliery, which provided 
access to both the Graigola and Swansea Four Feet coal seams. 
ii. Soils and Agriculture 
4.9.11 
The soil and agriculture land classifications are discussed in the Preliminary Geo-
Environmental Risk Assessment (Ref.5.37) and confirmed by NATMAP Soilscapes 
indicate the following:  
 
There are two different soil classification areas across the Gas Connection 
Site. The predominant soil classification is described as “slowly permeable, 
wet, very acidic upland soils with a peaty surface”. The soils are described as 
“low fertility” and land cover is described as “moorland rough grazing and 
forestry”. The precipitation “drains to the stream network”. Overgrazing of this 
soil could lead to accelerated run-off and soil erosion. 
 
The soils are described as “freely draining, slightly acid loamy soils”. The soils 
are of “low fertility”, with “arable and grassland” land cover and precipitation 
“drains to local groundwater and rivers”. There is potential for groundwater 
contamination with these soils, comprising nitrate, siltation and nutrient 
enrichment of streams from soil erosion. 
 
The agricultural land classification for the land within and surrounding the Gas 
Connection Site is Grade 4 (“poor quality agricultural land”) “with severe 
limitations which significantly restricts the range of crops and/or level of yields, 
mainly suited to grass with occasional arable crops”. 
 
The Gas Connection Site is known to be utilised as improved grazing for sheep 
and horses, with small areas of interspersing the improved grassland. 
 
iii. Ground Workings and Mineral Resources 
4.9.12 
The Envirocheck (Appendix 8.1) does not indicate the presence of any historical 
ground workings on the Project Site, however within the 1 km search buffer there are 
ten records of historical ground working features. These have all ceased production 
and are listed in Table 4-28. These comprise nine opencast mines producing 
sandstones and sands and gravel and one underground mine producing coal.

4.9.13 
The Coal Authority Mining Report (Appendix 8.4) identified Abergelli Colliery located 
adjacent to the Project Site Boundary. A coal pit, shaft, colliery, and mine spoil heap 
have all been identified on historical mapping at locations extending to between 480 m 
and 1 km from the Gas Connection Site Boundary (i.e. outside the boundaries of the 
Project Site). 
4.9.14 
The Coal Authority Mining Report (dated 30 July 2014) indicated that the Gas 
Connection is in the “likely zone of influence from workings in three seams of coal, at 
shallow to a depth of 380 m”. Figure 4.20 presents the mine workings from the mine 
abandonment plan across the Project Site. This plan shows that the entire Project Site 
is influenced by mine workings. 
4.9.15 
As illustrated in Figure 4.21, there is one mine and one shaft entry located within or 
close to the Project Site. The mine entry is located outside the Gas Connection Site 
Boundary, in the vicinity of Abergelli Colliery (north of Abergelli Farm). The mine shaft is 
located south of the Substation at (NGR 264970, 200800). There is no record of any 
treatment to the mine/shaft entries. A site visit undertaken on the 12th March 2018 has 
confirmed that the shaft has been back filled and no open void was visible.  
4.9.16 
The Coal Authority indicates that reserves of coal exist and could be worked in the 
future. However, the Gas Connection Site is currently not in an area for which the Coal 
Authority is determining to grant a licence to remove coal using underground methods, 
where a licence has been granted, or in an area that is likely to be affected at the 
surface from any planned future underground workings. 
 Gas Connection Environmental Report 
 
Prepared for:  Abergelli Power Limited  
AECOM 
66 
 
4.9.17 
The Coal Authority report states that the Gas Connection Site is not within the 
boundary of an opencast site from which coal has been removed by opencast 
methods, and does not lie within 200 m of a boundary of an opencast site. It also states 
that the Gas Connection Site is not within 800 m of the boundary of an opencast site 
for which the Coal Authority are determining whether to grant a licence to remove coal 
by opencast methods, or for which a licence to remove coal has been granted. 
iv. Ground Stability/Subsidence 
4.9.18 
The Coal Authority Mining Report indicates that no notice of the risk of the land being 
affected by subsidence has been given under Section 46 of the Coal Mining 
Subsidence Act 1991. 
4.9.19 
Abergelli Farm has been subject to remedial works, by or on behalf of the Coal 
Authority under its emergency surface hazard call out procedures. No further 
information was provided, however two damage notices or claims for alleged 
subsidence damage were made in June 1995 and November 1996 both of which were 
rejected. 
4.9.20 
Geological hazards across the Gas Connection Site have been identified in the 
Landmark Envirocheck Report; these are detailed in Table 4-29.

Measures 
No radon protective measures are necessary in the construction 
of new dwellings or extensions 
4.9.21 
Consideration of this hazard will be made in the design of any ground works (including 
ground investigation, earthworks, de-watering) and foundation design. There is an 
impact associated with any measure selected to mitigate the risk of settlement of 
compressible peat deposits (if present). The final design will incorporate suitable 
mitigation on the basis of the ground investigation findings to minimise the interaction 
of the Gas Connection with the peat / disturbance of the peat as a result of the Project. 
In the event that there will be some disturbance of peat, part of the embedded 
mitigation is to undertake a peat survey, including probing of the peat to determine the 
thickness and extent of the deposits, and the production of a Peat Management Plan, 
which will detail how to handle the peat properly and maximise on-site reuse of any 
excavated peat. The peat survey methodology and Peat Management Plan (if a 
reasonable amount of peat is found) will be prepared in consultation with and approved 
by CCS and NRW prior to construction (Appendix 2.1, G02).

v. Hydrogeology 
4.9.22 
The superficial glaciofluvial deposits and the bedrock geology are both classified as 
Secondary A Aquifers.  Secondary A Aquifers are defined as ‘permeable layers capable 
of supporting water supplies at a local rather than strategic scale, and in some cases 
forming an important source of base flow to rivers.’ 
4.9.23 
The superficial glacial till deposits are classed as Unproductive Strata,  defined as ‘rock 
layers or drift deposits with low permeability that have negligible significance for water 
supply or river base flow’. 
4.9.24 
The Landmark Envirocheck report has identified no groundwater abstraction licences 
associated with the Gas Connection Site. There is only one licence located within 100 
m of the Gas Connection Site, recorded 56 m to the north-east for a well at Abergelli 
Farm, licence number 22/59/4/0027 dated February 1993, for general farming and 
domestic use. There are a further seven licensed groundwater abstractions within 1 km  
of the site all for general farming and domestic use and a further 21 within 2 km  of the 
Gas Connection Site. Swansea Council has also identified a number of private water 
supplies located in close proximity to the Project Site.  
4.9.25 
The Gas Connection Site does not lie within a groundwater Source Protection Zone 
(SPZ). 
4.9.26 
The Landmark Envirocheck identifies the groundwater vulnerability classification of the 
soils beneath the Gas Connection Site and surrounding area. These vary between Low 
(L) to High (H) Leaching Potentials (classifications of L, H1, H3, I1 and U).  These 
classifications are described as follows: 
 
L: Soils in which pollutants are unlikely to penetrate the soil layer because 
water movement is largely horizontal or they have large ability to attenuate 
diffuse pollutants. Lateral flow from these soils contributes to groundwater 
recharge elsewhere in the catchment. 
 
H1: Soils which readily transmit liquid discharges because they are either 
shallow or susceptible to rapid by-pass flow directly to rock, gravel or 
groundwater. 
 
H3: Coarse textured or moderately shallow soils which readily transmit non-
absorbed pollutants and liquid discharges but which have some ability to 
attenuate absorbed pollutants because of their large clay or organic matter 
contents. 
 
I1: Soils which can possibly transmit a wide range of pollutants. 
 
U: Soil information for restored mineral workings and urban areas is based on 
fewer observations than elsewhere. A worst case vulnerability classification (H) 
assumed, until proved otherwise. 
4.9.27 
There have been no Pollution Incidents to Controlled Waters recorded on the Gas 
Connection Site by the Envirocheck Report. There have been three between 250 m 
and 500 m of the Gas Connection Site, which were classed as Category 3 minor 
incidents and a further eight incidents between 500 m and 1 km of the Gas Connection 
Site. These were classed between Category 1 major incident and Category 3 minor 
incidents.  
vi. Soil Chemistry 
4.9.28 
The Envirocheck Report has identified the estimated background soil chemistry (for 
selected key elements) across the Gas Connection Site. They are summarised as: 
 Gas Connection Environmental Report 
 
Prepared for:  Abergelli Power Limited  
AECOM

 
Arsenic: 25 – 35 mg/kg, 
 
Cadmium: <1.8 – 3.0 mg/kg, 
 
Chromium: 60 – 90 mg/kg 
 
Nickel: 15 – 45 mg/kg; and 
 
Lead: <100 mg/kg. 
 
vii. Landfill 
4.9.29 
The Envirocheck Report indicates that there are no landfill sites located within the Gas 
Connection Site Boundary.    
4.9.30 
The closest landfill sites to the Gas Connection Site is one registered landfill and an 
adjacent historic “Landfill Extension” located at Abergelli Fach Farm located between 
92 m and 121 m north east of the Gas Connection Site.  The current status of the 
registered landfill is ‘closed’ and it was only able to accept non-biodegradable wastes. 
The total void space was calculated at 75,000 m3 with a total tonnage of 142,500 t. 
4.9.31 
The Landfill Extension is reported to have accepted inert waste. The planning 
application for this extension was granted in 1997. NRW provided the Working Plan 
and associated drawings for the landfill which were dated March 1994. The total void 
space was calculated at 99,898 m3, with a total tonnage of 179,816 t. The Working 
Plan described the land as low lying, and poorly drained. Approximately three quarters 
of the landfill area was covered by a mine soil dump from Abergelli Colliery. This mine 
waste was removed leaving a layer of well compacted mine waste over the majority of 
the landfill area. The area of ground that was covered by the mine spoil was used for 
drying out of water treatment sludge (aluminium sulphate) though ceased when the 
landfill became operational. No further information on this operation is known. 
4.9.32 
Swansea City Waste Disposal Company Ltd gained planning permission for 
‘excavation and removal of inert material from landfill site and restoration’ at Abergelli 
Farm in February 2003 (CCS Ref: 2002/0312). This consent was subsequently 
amended, extending the permission to allow the excavation and removal of inert 
material until 31st December 2010 (2007/0907). The site has now been fully restored. 
4.9.33 
There are also an additional three historical landfills within 400 m of the Gas 
Connection, all located between 294 m and 402 m south-east of the Gas Connection 
Site.  The first is located 294 m east of the Gas Connection Site at Gorswen Farm and 
accepted unspecified waste between 1971 and 1972.  The second landfill was licenced 
to British Steel and located 309 m south-east. It was active between 1980 and 1994 
and received deposited waste included industrial and household waste. The third 
landfill is located 402 m south-east and was active been 1955 and 1970 receiving 
deposited waste included inert, industrial and special waste.   
viii. Recorded Animal Burial Grounds 
4.9.34 
Information obtained from CCS indicates there was no local cull of animals in 
Swansea, Neath Port Talbot or Carmarthenshire during the Foot and Mouth outbreak in 
2001. No mass burial of animals have been recorded at the Gas Connection Site. 
ix. Historical Land Use 
4.9.35 
Historical maps have been provided in the Landmark Envirocheck Report, presented in 
Appendix 8.1. The historical development of the Gas Connection Site is summarised in

x. Potentially Contaminative Land Uses 
4.9.36 
The study area for this section is 250 m from the Project Site Boundary.  Table 4-31 
lists land uses identified which have the potential to cause contamination within this 
study area. Land uses further than 250 m from the Project Site Boundary are not 
considered as they are unlikely to affect the Project Site. The table also details 
contaminant groups potentially present as a result of these land uses.

xi. Sources of Contamination 
4.9.37 
It is considered that the most likely sources of contamination for the Gas Connection 
Site are: 
 
Contamination associated with the off-site historic landfill and landfill extension 
including aluminium sulphate sludge; and 
 
Contamination from agricultural land use. 
 
xii. Preliminary Conceptual Site Model (CSM) 
4.9.38 
On the basis of the information summarised above, a preliminary CSM has been 
developed for the Gas Connection. The CSM identifies potential contaminants, 
receptors (both on and off-site) and exposure pathways that may be present. The 
identification of such potential “pollutant linkages” is a key aspect of the evaluation of 
potentially contaminated land. Potential “pollutant linkages” associated with the Project 
Site are detailed within Table 4-32. 
4.9.39 
It should be noted that the identification of potential “pollutant linkages” does not 
indicate that they are significant in any way or that the Gas Connection Site is 
unsuitable for its current/proposed use. It does, however, act as a way of focusing 
future data collection at the Gas Connection Site and identifying any key potential risks 
associated with the Gas Connection Site. 
4.9.40 
The model is based on a desk study and a walkover undertaken in 2014 and will be 
confirmed through intrusive investigation prior to detailed design.

required to assess the likelihood and level of risk. With 
current land use the risk is considered to be moderate

Potential Environmental Effects 
i. 
Construction  
Geology and Soils: Sand and Gravel Reserves 
4.9.41 
Should ground investigation works demonstrate that there are sand and gravel 
reserves at the depth of the Gas Connection works, there will be a permanent 
sterilisation of potential sand and gravel reserves along the Gas Connection where the 
pipe laying activities are expected to occur. No additional mitigation is proposed 
4.9.42 
Sand and gravel reserves were not identified within the AGI area on the UDP 
Proposals Map (shown in Figure 4.22).  
Geology and Soils: Coal Reserves 
4.9.43 
The UDP Proposals Map indicates that coal reserves are present underlying the Gas 
Connection (including AGI), shown in Figure 4.22. Should the ground investigation 
works demonstrate that coal reserves will be directly affected by the depth of the Gas 
Connection; there will be permanent sterilisation on future coal extraction along the 
Gas Pipeline route. No additional mitigation is proposed. 
Agricultural Land 
4.9.44 
The construction phase associated with the Gas Connection will be a corridor with a 
working width of 50 m to 200 m wide and result in a temporary sterilisation of Grade 4 
agricultural land during the construction period. Grade 4 land is defined as land with 
severe limitations which significantly restrict the range of crops and / or level of yield. 
4.9.45 
AGI will be approximately 0.3 ha, and result in the localised, permanent sterilisation of 
poor quality agricultural land. Grade 4 land is defined as land with severe limitations 
which significantly restrict the range of crops and / or level of yield. No additional 
mitigation is proposed. 
4.9.46 
With the embedded mitigation as set out in G01 - G05 Mitigation Register (Appendix 
2.1) no significant effects during construction are anticipated. 
ii. Operation 
4.9.47 
No significant effects are anticipated during the operation phase.

Proposed Stack Location
Planting around the AGI to be developed in parallel with 
the detailed design. Planting to incorporate hedgerow 
and hedgerow tree planting along the road edge to help 
screen views of AGI from road users. All planting will 
respect visibility splay constraints associated with the 
new access road into the AGI site. Additional hedgerow 
and native structure planting around the AGI to assist in 
screening the structures from views, particularly from 
the Public Right of Way.
Proposed hedgerow and tree planting to tie in with 
existing hedgerow and to avoid conflict with the 
proposed ditch from the attenuation pond

Notes:
1) The outline LEMP is for illustrative purposes only and identifies the principles of the landscape and ecological
mitigation. The final LEMP will be subject to the detailed design layout and will be completed as part of a planning
condition.
2) This figure should be read in conjunction with Landscape and Ecology Mitigation Strategy, Outline Lighting
Strategy, and Flood Consequence Assessment - Outline Drainage Strategy.
3) All detailed planting design to reflect utility easements.
4) All existing trees and hedgerows within the Project Site Boundary will be retained where reasonably practical.
5) All construction laydown areas to be fully reinstated (save for maintenance compound).
6) All boundary features (fencelines, hedgerows etc) and fields to be reinstated along Pipeline corridor and to the
edge of the new access road corridor, subject to utility easements.
7) The location of existing landscape features, including hedgerows, woodland areas and solar farms shown on
this figure has been informed by a combination of aerial photography and site observation.
8) Final form of attenuation ponds to be developed in parallel with detailed design.
9) Refer to Appendix 3.10. Figure 1.1 for Otter and Water Vole Survey Area and Survey Results.
