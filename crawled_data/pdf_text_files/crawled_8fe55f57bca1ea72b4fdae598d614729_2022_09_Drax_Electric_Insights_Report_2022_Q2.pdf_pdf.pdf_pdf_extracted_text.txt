1.  Introduction 
After a 12 month hiatus Electric Insights is back, relaunching into one of the 
most turbulent times in Britain’s electricity system’s history.  Our first 
article focuses on the cost-of-living crisis that is engulfing the nation, and 
the central role played by energy prices.  The wholesale cost of coal and gas 
have risen to 5-10 times their usual levels over the past two years, and as 
gas is the largest source of electricity production, the cost of power has 
shot up too.  These price rises have made their way into consumer bills, 
bringing extreme hardship for households, businesses and industrial 
consumers alike.  
  
The price of fossil fuels 
over the last three years, 
relative to their averages 
from 2010-19 
These huge price rises have sparked intense debate about whether energy 
markets are fundamentally broken, who is profiting from the crisis, and 
should they be allowed to?  Our second article explores whether 
renewables are being paid more than they should, and the government’s 
Review of Electricity Market Arrangements which is exploring these topics.  
  
 
These problems are not just limited to the UK: energy prices have 
been spiralling upwards across the whole of Europe.  Several 
factors are colliding on the continent, including gas shortages in 
Germany and prolonged nuclear outages in France, meaning 
Europe’s power systems are facing additional pressures.  So, 
despite British electricity being more expensive than ever, it is 
cheap in comparison to our European neighbours.  Our third article 
details how Britain has become a net exporter of electricity for the 
first time in 10 years, with 5% of the electricity generated here sent 
abroad over the last three months.  This comes at a time when 
Britain’s energy security is becoming a cause for concern. 
  
 
This situation has been complicated further by the extreme 
weather affecting the UK and much of the world.  This 
summer saw a series of unrelenting heat waves, with 
temperatures soaring past 40°C for the first time ever, 
coupled with the driest start to the year ever recorded.  We 
examine how the extreme heat has impacted electricity 
demand and supply, and the longer-term implications for 
the power system.

2.  The cost of energy crisis 
A cost-of-living crisis is consuming the UK, Europe and much of the world alike.  A major 
component of this has been the dramatic increase in the price of electricity and gas.  As 
this filters through into consumer bills it has become a major driver of inflation, which 
has risen above 10% for the first time in decades.  Average household bills had been 
forecast to rise more than five-fold to over £500 per month.  This led to fears of civil 
unrest, and dire warnings of thousands of businesses forced to fold and ‘a catastrophic 
loss of life’ due to fuel poverty this winter.  
 
The incoming Truss government announced a new Energy Price Guarantee that will 
freeze the bill for a typical household at £2,500 per year from October, with support also 
going to small businesses.  This will soften the immediate financial impacts to 
consumers, but in the long-term, high energy costs will weigh heavily on the economy.  
 
Without this intervention, the retail price of electricity to households would have hit 52 
pence per kWh at the start of October.  Britons would have been paying more for 
electricity than at any point since 1923, when there were just 1 million consumers of 
‘light and power’ and “keeping just five bulbs going for a day would cost a week's wages”.  
Households will now instead pay 34 p/kWh for electricity and 10.3 p/kWh for gas, still 
more than at any point since 1935. 
What is driving up energy prices? 
Coal and gas prices started rising in the summer of 2020, initially rebounding from the 
historic lows during the first COVID lockdown.  Prices continued rising through 2021 as 
global supply chains struggled to adjust to the repeated closing and reopening of 
economies.  A year of reduced coal and gas production resulted in low stock levels going 
into the harsh winter of 2020-21 and then an extremely hot summer in 2021 across 
China, Europe and the Americas.  The extreme weather pushed energy demand higher at 
a time when supplies were constrained.  
 
The retail price of electricity in Britain in real terms (2020 p/kWh), averaged across 
all consumers (residential, commercial and industrial).

By the start of 2022, British wholesale electricity prices had already risen to £200/MWh, 
quadruple the average during the 2010s.  As winter eased and demand for heating fell, 
prices would normally have eased back.  However, on February the 24th, Russia’s 
invasion of Ukraine had dire consequences for energy geopolitics and security. 
 
Europe’s reliance on Russia for 40% its natural gas has proven its Achilles Heel.  
Germany has become a flashpoint as the sanctions imposed on Russia have meant 
NordStream 2, a major gas pipeline that took ten years to build, will no longer go into 
operation.  Russia’s Gazprom has then turned the screws on NordStream 1, posing a 
severe threat to Germany’s energy security coming into winter.    
 
The UK does not directly import gas from Russia, although around 4% of our gas does 
come indirectly through the interconnected European markets.  However, as gas is 
traded widely on the global market, shortages abroad will lead to price rises at home.  
Analysts from Cornwall Insight and the World Bank expect gas prices to remain high for 
next 18 months at least. 
Household bills at their highest ever 
Ofgem sets an energy price cap on the maximum price (per kWh of gas and electricity) 
that suppliers can charge their consumers on standard variable tariffs. The cap was 
intended to protect consumers that did not switch regularly between fixed tariffs from 
‘price gouging’ by the big energy companies. With fixed tariffs now largely unavailable or 
unattractive, most consumers are now likely to be on variable standard tariffs, and so 
pay these capped prices.  
 
The bill for gas and electricity in an average household has varied between £70 and £100 
per month over the 2010s.  In the space of just a year, these bills have more than doubled.  
In April of this year, the cap for an average dual-fuel household increased to £164/month, 
and then in October it was scheduled to increase by another 80% to £295/month.   
 
The government’s Energy Price Guarantee now limits the amount that households will 
pay directly (shown by the blue area in the chart below) to £208/month on average.  This 
does not make the underlying energy sources any cheaper though, so retailers (the 
companies that sell gas and electricity to consumers) will still need to receive the original 
(higher) price cap set by Ofgem to stay afloat.   
 
So long as the wholesale cost of gas and electricity remains high, the taxpayer will be 
picking up the additional bill (shown by the red area).  Over the next two years this is 
expected to add £150 billion to the national debt (around £6,000 per household), which 
will have to be recovered by future taxation or reduced public services.

The wholesale cost of electricity has risen to five times the levels during the 2010s.  
The retail bill for an average British household has followed, and for winter 2022/23 
the cost of a typical household’s energy is projected to hit over £500 per month. 
 
 
 
The price caps set by Ofgem limit how much firms can charge for the things they can 
control, such as network and operating costs, and profits.  Other expenses – most 
notably wholesale energy prices – are beyond the control of any one company (or 
country), as gas prices depend on international circumstances, and electricity prices are 
driven by gas prices.  Ofgem allows suppliers to pass these changes onto consumers, 
hence the cap increases when wholesale prices go up, and decreases when they go 
down (as was seen briefly in the Summer of 2020).  There is a lag between the two, hence 
the first big rise in the cap came in April 2022, more than a year after wholesale prices 
started to rise. 
 
It is important to note that the increase in gas prices is responsible for 96% of this bill 
rise.  Green levies have not changed over the past year, but these have now been waived 
to fund part of the Energy Price Guarantee (reducing tax take for the Exchequer).  Ofgem 
has shown that UK CfDs (mainly for offshore wind) are now reducing energy bills. 
 
The speed and size of the recent price changes caught many smaller suppliers off guard, 
leading to the collapse of 29 companies as their costs overtook their revenues.  This has 
added £85 to the average annual electricity bill.  The bankruptcy of ‘Bulb’, which supplied 
1.4 million homes, is expected to add another £150 onto the average energy bill. 
Low building efficiency spells a looming catastrophe 
The tripling of household energy bills since 2021 is made worse by the low energy 
efficiency standards of British housing stock. The UK has some of the oldest and least 
efficient housing stock in Europe, which lose warmth much faster than in neighbouring 
countries.  Three in five homes are rated EPC D or worse, meaning they use more than 
100 kWh per m2 per year, and cost upwards of £30 per m2 per year to heat.   
Drax Electric Insights Quarterly – Q2 2022

Improving energy efficiency is a key route out of this crisis, but one we have failed to 
capitalise on as a country.  The uptake of home energy efficiency measures is at a 10-
year low, which can be largely attributed to the Cameron government “cutting the green 
crap”.  This resulted in a major redesign and shrinkage of energy efficiency supplier 
obligations. The consequences of low efficiency housing stock are now magnified, 
adding an estimated £2.5 billion onto UK energy bills. 
 
Even with the government’s Energy Price Guarantee, many households will be plunged 
into energy poverty this year, spending more than a tenth of disposable household 
income on energy bills.  Around 13% of English and Welsh homes are already energy-
poor, along with a quarter in Scotland.  Fuel poverty in Wales tripled with the April 2022 
price cap rise, and this will only worsen with the October rise.  
 
Many households now face the agonising choice over whether to heat or eat.  This will 
have catastrophic health impacts for the country.  Excess winter deaths are almost three 
times higher in the coldest 25% of housing than in the warmest 25%.  Cold weather 
directly increases the rates of heart attacks, strokes, flu, falls and injuries and 
hypothermia.  Before COVID, there were 32,000 excess deaths each winter, over and 
above the mortality rates across the rest of the year.  Of these, nearly 10,000 deaths were 
avoidable, caused  by under-heated homes – equal to the number of people who die from 
breast or prostate cancer each year. 
 
The Bank of England is expecting a recession in 2022, as energy prices impact on inflation 
and growth, with most businesses having to pass on energy costs to consumers. Small 
businesses are most at risk and may have to down-size. More than half expect to 
stagnate or shrink due to escalating costs, with fuel costs mentioned by two-thirds of 
businesses. 
Getting away from gas 
This crisis has stemmed from high gas prices which are affecting the whole of Europe, 
but the UK has been worst hit out of all countries.  Gas prices are particularly affecting 
British consumers in three ways: (1) increasing the cost of heating our homes, (2) 
increasing the cost of electricity from gas-fired power stations, and (3) increasing the 
price of goods and services, as the cost of heating, lighting, cooking and industrial 
production soars.  
 
The UK is addicted to gas for heating our homes, as 88% of English homes use gas boilers 
for central heating. At the same time, the share of heat from low-carbon sources has 
been broadly flat since 2017, even in new-builds. The installation of heat pumps has 
doubled in 2021, but remains very low at 70,000 per year, again trailing the developments 
in Europe.  In comparison, Germany has installed more than twice as many heat pumps 
in 2021, with half of new-build home opting for heat pumps. The Netherlands have made 
heat pumps mandatory from 2026 onwards for all new-builds.  The UK has an ambitious 
target of 600,000 new heat pumps per year within just six years, but shows little signs of 
progress towards meeting this.

Britain’s electricity market is also more heavily exposed to gas prices than any major 
European country.  Around 40% of Britain’s electricity comes from gas, yet it sets the 
electricity price 80% of the time.  Progress moving away from gas was slowed down with 
curbs on the development of onshore wind and ground-mounted solar PV.  A new 
generation of nuclear power (starting with Hinkley Point C) is also running into severe 
delays, and is not expected to be delivering power before 2027. 
So what can be done? 
The policy options for mitigating the impact of gas price rises fall into two categories.  
Initial action has been taken to reduce the short-term financial impacts on households 
and businesses, and now longer-term measures are needed to reduce our exposure to 
fossil-fuel prices. 
 
Measures to reduce power and gas consumption are paramount. For example, 
explaining to consumers how to lower the flow temperature of their gas boiler so it can 
go into condensing mode could save 6-8% of gas consumption, or £180 per year, with no 
change in comfort levels.  Collectively, even small reduction in energy consumption can 
reduce the pressure on gas prices, further reducing the bills. 
 
In the medium and long term, re-energising efforts to retrofit home insulation, while 
building more renewable and nuclear generation and storage are all vital.  As the country 
transitions towards net-zero, the energy system will become more independent and 
lower cost, shielding us from future fossil-fuel price shocks. For this purpose, the 
government is currently performing a Review of Electricity Market Arrangements (REMA) 
to explore future arrangements in a low-carbon, low-generation-cost markets, to prevent 
minority shares of fossil fuels setting the marginal price. 
Conclusion 
The UK is facing its worst energy crisis in fifty years.  A combination of high reliance on 
gas for both heating and electricity and inefficient buildings makes the UK the worst-hit 
country in Europe.  Addressing this must be the highest priority for any new government, 
or the consequences for households and businesses will be severe.  Quick action can 
mitigate the worst effects, but there is no quick fix for the underlying causes, which will 
require a sustained move away from fossil fuels in our energy system.

3.  Do renewables deliver value for money? 
The government has launched a Review of Electricity Market Arrangements (REMA), 
covering practically every aspect of wholesale electricity trading.  This is only the second 
such review since the industry was privatised in 1990.  A review in 1997 replaced 
centralised dispatch with the current system of independent power exchanges and 
bilateral trading.  Then the Energy Act of 2013 added contracts for differences (CfDs) to 
support low-carbon technologies and the capacity market to support ‘firm’ generators 
that help with security of supply.  Will the current review lead to a similarly big shake up? 
 
Under the current British Electricity Trading and Transmission Arrangements (BETTA), the 
National Grid is charged with keeping the power system stable, balancing the system in 
real time, buying and dispatching reserve capacity, adjusting generation (and 
occasionally demand) to keep power flows within the limits on transmission lines, and 
procuring various other ancillary services.  As the proportion of renewable generation 
grows, it becomes harder to manage the power system, and the cost of providing these 
services will grow.  This makes a thorough review worthwhile.  The options range from 
“very little change” to some quite radical proposals, a few of which seem to be untested 
anywhere else in the world (though, of course, someone has to be first).  
 
Most attention has gone to the suggestion that the market must change so that nuclear 
and renewable generators (with very low marginal costs) no longer receive the market 
price set by gas-fired generators (with much higher marginal costs).  This is not a new 
complaint.  One motivation for the first review back in 1997 was the claim that it was 
wrong for gas-fired generators to be able to undercut more expensive coal stations when 
bidding into the centralised market, but still receive the same System Marginal Price.  
 
However, that review’s change to bilateral trading at mutually agreed prices did not put 
a stop to this.  In a free market, companies naturally want to get ‘the going rate’ for their 
product.  While there was nothing in the rules that said a nuclear station will 
automatically receive the same price as all other stations running at the same time, that 
is what the traders selling their output managed to achieve.  Ultimately, nuclear, gas, 
wind and any other types of power station sell the same product: electricity; so it attracts 
the same price. 
 
That said, it is wrong to think that all low-carbon generators are receiving the current (and 
very high) market prices for their electricity.  The present system already pays newer 
power stations less because they sell their electricity through Contract for Differences 
(CfD). These initially provided high prices, as the first new-build nuclear reactors and 
offshore wind farms were expensive to build.  Hinkley Point C and the East Anglia wind 
farm were both awarded over £100/MWh in today’s money, which was expensive 
compared to fossil fuels at the time.  But even these earliest contracts are now well 
below the average wholesale price of electricity.  The newest offshore wind farms have 
been contracted for less than £40/MWh, so once operational they would be giving three- 
quarters of their revenue back to the government at current prices.  Now that market 
prices are higher than their strike prices, those contracts pay money from the generators

The average revenue received by each technology in the wholesale market during H1 
of 2022.  Wind and solar capacity are split by support type, and vary based on 
installation size and date (as tariffs were reduced in line with technology costs). 
 
 
back to the government-sponsored Low Carbon Contracts Company, which distributes 
the rebates to retailers.  The retail price cap takes this into account, so that households 
are paying less for renewable energy from newer stations. 
 
Some small generators, such as rooftop solar PV, were supported with feed-in tariffs and 
so also receive fixed prices.  However, older renewables that pre-date CfDs were given 
Renewables Obligation Certificates (ROCs) as a second revenue stream on top of selling 
in the wholesale market, and the existing nuclear fleet also sell at wholesale prices.  This 
does not necessarily mean that the plant owners are the ones profiting from the high gas 
prices.  Generators tend to sell much of their expected output in multi-year fixed price 
contracts, to give some revenue stability.  This means the windfall profit goes to the 
company that bought the contract, and as these can be resold indefinitely, the true home 
of the windfall profits difficult to uncover. 
 
How could the government make sure these generators get a lower price?  Professor Rob 
Gross and researchers at the UK Energy Research Centre suggested in April that the 
government could auction CfDs to existing generators are a quick way to reduce 
‘overpayment’.  Some may find it attractive to swap a risky future with unknown market 
prices for a stable price, even one that was lower than current wholesale prices.  
Generators did sign up for equivalent contracts during the Californian Energy Crisis of 
2000-01 (which saw power prices rise 800%), helping to end the crisis. 
 
Although nuclear and renewable generators are cheap to run, they cost a lot to build.  
Older stations should have paid back that cost years ago, but newer stations won’t be 
able to if the prices they can charge are held too low.  One option in the consultation 
paper combines a rule forcing generators to bid their variable costs into an auction (used 
in some markets around the world) with an auction rule that pays winning bidders their 
own bid.  That rule is also used in a wide variety of auctions, but never in combination 
with the first one – as together they would guarantee that stations could never recover 
their fixed costs.  Such interventions could deter future investors and derail the longer-
term transition away from fossil fuels, so care must be taken in any market redesign.

4.  Britain becomes an electricity exporter 
For the first time in over a decade, Britain has become a net exporter of electricity.  The 
3 months to June saw 8% of the electricity generated here (5.5 TWh) get sent abroad, the 
largest amount ever recorded.  This stands in sharp contrast to other forms of energy: 
Britain imports around ¼ of its oil, ½ its gas and ¾ of its coal.  
 
Britain had a trade surplus of 5% of electricity generated (8% exported minus 3% 
imported), with a net value of £500m per month.  Britain’s exports could have been higher 
if it wasn’t for a fire at the IFA interconnector to France back in September 2021.  This 
halved the link’s capacity from 2 to 1 GW, with full service not expected until the end of 
this year. 
 
Historically, Britain has been an importer of electricity, with an average of 8% of 
electricity coming from our neighbours over the last decade.  This long-term trade 
imbalance stems from it being historically cheaper to import power than to generate 
more power here.  France had cheap electricity from its large fleet of nuclear reactors, 
and more recently British power stations face an additional tax on the CO2 they produce.   
 
So, why the turnaround?  Prices on the continent have risen even further than in Britain 
because of low capacity and gas supplies.  France has suffered from extensive capacity 
shortages, with more than half of its 56 nuclear reactors offline either for summer 
maintenance, to repair corrosion and cracking in the reactor cores, or because they 
could not be cooled during the summer heatwaves.  Germany is also suffering from a 
chronic shortage of gas as Russia is withholding exports.

A growing export market is good for producers, as they can earn more for their generation 
by selling abroad, and good for the country’s balance sheet (the current trade deficit is 
£10 billion per month).  But it can be bad news for consumers, as more competition for 
the electricity that is generated here pushes up prices – particularly unwelcome when 
prices are already at a crisis point. 
 
Norway has threatened to impose export controls on electricity to protect consumers, 
as its hydro reservoirs fall to their lowest levels since 1996.  Norway has been exporting 
more than usual to Germany, Denmark and the Netherlands in response to power 
shortages on the continent.  Britain’s electricity trade with Norway is more balanced 
though, importing 0.66 TWh and exporting 0.44 TWh over the last 3 months.  Effectively, 
the UK has been paying Norway £117/MWh to use their enormous hydro storage to 
balance out our wind and solar farms.1 
 
This suggests there is value in increasing the amount of pumped hydro energy storage in 
the UK.  This is the main technology used for long-duration energy storage, which unlike 
batteries can charge for 8 or more hours at a time.  This is essential for balancing 
weather-dependent renewable sources, such as solar power which needs to be shifted 
between day and night time, and wind has shortfalls and surpluses over timescales of 
days or even weeks.  Britain has just under 3 GW of pumped hydro storage capacity, less 
than half that of comparable countries like Germany.  Given that there is now 39 GW of 
wind and solar power, it is no wonder that the job of balancing their variability is being 
outsourced to neighbouring countries.  
 
While the country’s focus is all on the cost of energy, the threat of neighbours restricting 
their exports to us, or needing to import electricity from us, raises the issue of Britain’s 
energy security.  Coal-fired power stations are being paid around £250m to stay online 
for the coming winter, rather than continue their decommissioning.  In August, the Rough 
gas storage facility gained approval to reopen after closing on economic grounds in 2017, 
nearly doubling the UK’s capacity for storing natural gas.  Meanwhile, National Grid 
conducted a four-day wargame exercise to prepare the energy system for all 
eventualities, amid fears of rolling blackouts if gas supplies fail to materialise during 
winter.

5.  How heat waves will change the power system 
Never before has the UK experienced a 40-degree summer’s day – temperatures 
normally reserved for holiday destinations like the south of Spain.  On July the 19th 
Lincolnshire reached 40.3°C, breaking the national record by over 1.5 degrees.  This was 
a big test for the country’s infrastructure: railways buckled, airport runways melted, but 
the power system remained largely unscathed.   
 
Heat waves are increasingly causing major problems for power systems around the 
world.  Many of France’s nuclear reactors had to shut off because the rivers were too hot 
to cool them.  Meanwhile, low water levels in Germany’s rivers threatened shortages of 
coal deliveries to power stations. 
 
Closer to home, the heat wave left the UK ‘very close’ to a shortfall in electricity supply.  
This was not caused by plant outages, but rather the hot weather simply made power 
stations and transmission wires less effective.  Thermal power stations need to cool 
steam back to water as part of their thermodynamic cycle (hence the iconic cooling 
towers seen at many power stations).  This is harder to do when it is hotter outside.  At 
40°C (a typical summer temperature in Saudi Arabia), a gas-fired power station can 
expect its capacity to be reduced by 13%, and its efficiency by 7% compared to when 
running at 20°C (the UK’s typical summer temperature).2  Now that the UK has 
experienced Saudi temperatures, its power station output was similarly degraded. 
 
It is not only supply, but also demand that has been impacted.  Across the US, Texas, 
California and Illinois had to ask citizens to turn down their air conditioning to prevent 
blackouts.  Japan had to scale back industrial production and limit air conditioner use,

than average, blue areas show those that were colder than average.

and parts of China have suffered the worst heat wave ever recorded, with several 
provinces completely halting industrial production for several weeks to keep the lights 
on.  
 
Britain also saw increased electricity demand during the heat wave due to air 
conditioning and refrigeration loads.  The effect was muted though, with demand on the 
19th only 6% higher than the same day the week before and after.  Even so, there was a 
70% expected chance of demand outstripping supply on July the 18th, as this increase 
came at a time when demand would normally be low, and so power stations were offline 
for routine maintenance.  Electricity prices surged to nearly £750/MWh the following day 
(high, even by current standards), in much the same way as they do during the coldest 
winter spells. 
 
Currently only 1 in 20 UK homes have air conditioning. This will undoubtedly increase as 
people struggle with the increasingly hot weather, and sales of air conditioning systems 
soared in the weeks around the heat wave.  As part of the efforts to decarbonise heating, 
it is expected that millions of households will install heat pumps over the coming years.  
Air-to-air heat pumps can also operate as air conditioning units, and National Grid’s 
modelling expects these to take off rapidly in the coming decade.  Ten years from now 
there could be between 7 and 25 times more units installed than at present, meaning the 
demand surges we see in future summers could be much more difficult to 
accommodate. 
 
Going forwards, Britain should not only expect more frequent and more intense 
heatwaves, but also that these will have a stronger effect on electricity demand due to 
changing consumer preferences.

Despite gas prices reaching record highs, the share of 
electricity produced from gas actually increased over the last 
year.  It supplied more than two-fifths of electricity over the 
past quarter. 
 
Wind output was up by two-fifths on this time last year, a 
welcome relief that stemmed the increase in gas generation 
somewhat. 
 
These changes were dwarfed by the change in trade though, 
exports were five times higher than the same quarter last year, 
and imports down two-thirds.

3 Other sources give different values because of the types of plant they consider.  For example, BEIS Energy Trends records an additional 0.7 GW of hydro, 0.6 GW of biomass and 
3 GW of waste-to-energy plants.  These plants and their output are not visible to the electricity transmission system and so cannot be reported on here. 
4 We include an estimate of the installed capacity of smaller storage devices which are not monitored by the electricity market operator.  Britain’s storage capacity is made 
up of 2.9 GW of pumped hydro storage, 0.6 GW of lithium-ion batteries, 0.4 GW of flywheels and 0.3 GW of compressed air.

7.  Power system records 
Britain’s wind farms hit a major milestone back in May, producing more than 20 GW for 
the first time.  National Grid reported peak output hitting 19.916 GW, but our data which 
combines National Grid and Elexon data registered the total as 20.002 GW. 
 
Over the first half of 2022, thirty of the records that we track were broken, mostly relating 
to renewable and low carbon generation hitting new highs, and fossil fuel output reaching 
new lows.  Renewable energy sources (wind, solar, biomass and hydro) provided more 
than half the country’s electricity throughout the month of February, and peaked at an 
instantaneous share of 73% of the country’s demand. 
 
Britain saw its cleanest ever electricity on New Year’s Day, with the generation mix 
producing only 55 grams of CO2 per kWh, the lowest ever for a day.  This means 1,550 
tonnes of CO2 were produced by the electricity sector that day.  This compares to 6,200 
tCO2 on New Year’s Day last year, and a staggering 21,100 tCO2 from the first day of 2009. 
 
Given how electricity prices have risen, you might expect that the price records would 
have tumbled, but only the monthly-average price hit an all-time high.  Extremely high 
but short-lived price spikes are common in normal times, as they are about acute 
shortages of capacity in specific hours.  The current situation is a chronic increase in fuel 
prices which affects all hours. 
 
The tables below look over the past decade (2009 to 2022) and report the record output 
and share of electricity generation, plus sustained averages over a day, a month and a 
calendar year.5  Cells highlighted in blue are records that were broken in the first half of 
2022.  Each number links to the date it occurred on the Electric Insights website, so these 
records can be explored visually.

6 Note that Britain has no inter-seasonal electricity storage, so we only report on half-hourly and daily records.  Elexon and National 
Grid only report the output of large pumped hydro storage plants.  The operation of battery, flywheel and other storage sites is not 
publicly available.
