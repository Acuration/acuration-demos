 Executive Summary 
 
This Flood Risk Assessment (FRA) has been prepared on behalf of Millbrook Power 
Limited and in accordance with the National Planning Policy Framework to support an 
application for a Development Consent Order (DCO) relating to the construction of a 
proposed Power Generation Plant in Bedfordshire.  The Project will comprise an Open 
Cycle Gas Turbine Power Generation Plant fuelled by natural gas, along with 
associated infrastructure including a new Gas Connection to bring in fuel to supply the 
plant and an Electrical Connection to export the power generated to the National Grid. 
 
This FRA has been prepared following consultation with both the Environment Agency 
and the Bedfordshire and River Ivel Internal Drainage Board and sets out: 
 
(i) 
the nature of the existing flood risk constraints associated with watercourses 
and water bodies within and in the vicinity of the Project Site, 
(ii) the likely nature of the impact of the proposed Project from a flood risk 
perspective and details of proposed mitigation measures and 
(iii) the scope of technical work undertaken to enable a detailed appraisal of flood 
risk constraints to inform both development planning/design and the 
preparation of the FRA. 
 
The Project Site is partly located within The Rookery, between Milton Keynes and 
Bedford, extending over an area of some 210ha and comprising two former clay pits 
(Rookery North and Rookery South) separated by an east-west spine of unexcavated 
clay. 
In accordance with the provisions of the Environment Act 1995, The Rookery has been 
the subject of a Review of Old Minerals Permission (ROMP), which allows the minerals 
Planning Authority to update the older mineral planning permissions by imposing 
modern operating, restoration and aftercare conditions.  The landowner submitted an 
application for the determination of new conditions in June 2009 and this application 
set out details of a Low Level Restoration Scheme (LLRS) which seeks to restore the 
former clay workings to low-intensity agricultural use, with measures included to 
enhance biodiversity and landscape.  The LLRS works comprise the re-profiling of the 
pit base, slope buttressing works, the implementation of a surface water drainage 
strategy and landscaping works.  These works will be completed prior to the 
commencement of construction works for the Millbrook Power Project and the LLRS 
therefore provides the ‘baseline’ for the purposes of assessing flood risk constraints, 
the impact of the proposals from a flood risk perspective and associated mitigation 
measures. 
 
The Mill Brook watercourse flows in a northerly direction along the western flank of 
Rookery South Pit and a Tributary of the Mill Brook, draining a catchment to the south 
of Rookery South Pit, joins the Mill Brook in the vicinity of the south-west corner of 
Rookery South Pit.  The FRA has considered the nature of flood risk associated with 
these watercourses and, through hydraulic modelling analysis, has shown that during 
the 1 in 100 year flood event, floodwater may discharge into Rookery South Pit from a 
localised area along the upper reach of the Tributary of the Mill Brook.  However, the 
Flood Risk Assessment 
Millbrook Power Project 
 
 
 
 
4 
LLRS works are such that the Power Generation Plant Site will comprise an elevated 
platform.  In addition, the LLRS surface water drainage strategy has been designed to 
cater for floodwater influx into the Pit from the Mill Brook Tributary.  On this basis, and 
within the context of Tables 1 and 3 of the NPPF Planning Practice Guidance, the 
Power Generation Plant Site is categorised as Flood Zone 1 – Low Probability.  This 
Flood Zone classification has been agreed with the Environment Agency. 
The LLRS includes the implementation of a surface water drainage strategy, this 
strategy having been designed to cater for the entire area of Rookery South Pit, 
including the consented Covanta RRF project.  This FRA has reviewed the Project 
within the context of the LLRS drainage strategy and demonstrates that the surface 
water drainage infrastructure brought forward as part of the LLRS offers adequate 
storage capacity to accommodate surface water run-off from the additional 
impermeable area associated with the Project.  On this basis, the Project is 
‘compatible’ with, and accommodated by, the LLRS drainage strategy, such that no 
further mitigation measures are required as part of the Project. 
The assessment considers the potential impacts of climate change upon (i) flood risk 
associated with the Mill Brook and its Tributary and (ii) the surface water run-off regime.  
The potential implications of extreme flooding (1 in 1,000 year, or 0.1% probability 
event) and ‘residual risk’ issues relating to the operation/performance of the surface 
water drainage system are also addressed and the assessment concludes that flood 
risk considerations do not constitute a barrier to the granting of a Development Consent 
Order (DCO) for the Project.

Introduction 
1.1 
Background and Development Proposals 
1.1.1 Peter Brett Associates LLP (PBA) has been appointed by Millbrook Power 
Limited to prepare a Flood Risk Assessment (FRA) in support of an application 
for a Development Consent Order relating to the construction of a Power 
Generation Plant in Bedfordshire. The Project would comprise an Open Cycle 
Gas Turbine (OCGT) peaking power generating station fuelled by natural gas, 
along with integral infrastructure such as a new Gas Connection to bring in fuel 
to supply the plant and an Electrical Connection to export the power generated 
to the National Grid. 
1.1.2 Government policy in respect of development and flood risk in areas in England 
is contained within the Department for Communities and Local Government 
document National Planning Policy Framework (NPPF) published in March 
2012 and the accompanying Planning Practice Guidance (PPG) published in 
March 2014.  In addition, the Overarching National Policy Statement for Energy 
(NPS EN-1) requires that applications for energy projects of 1ha or greater in 
Flood Zone 1 and all energy projects in Flood Zone 2 and 3 are accompanied 
by a Flood Risk Assessment. 
1.1.3 The NPPF requires Local Planning Authorities (LPAs) to consult the 
Environment Agency (EA) on all applications for development in flood risk areas 
(except minor development), including those in areas with critical drainage 
problems and for any development on land exceeding 1 hectare outside flood 
risk areas (as set out in Section 15 of the Planning Practice Guidance).  
However, The Planning Inspectorate will make the final decision with regards to 
applications for Development Consent Orders. 
1.1.4 This FRA has been prepared in accordance with the NPPF and associated 
Planning Practice Guidance and following consultation with the EA and 
Bedfordshire and River Ivel Internal Drainage Board.  The level of detail entered 
into in any appraisal of flood risk is dependent upon the scale and potential 
impact of the proposed development and EA Standing Advice (England, Version 
3.1) outlines the requirements based upon the scale/nature of development and 
its location within the floodplain. 
1.1.5 The NPPF requires that any appraisal of flood risk be undertaken by competent 
people as early as possible in the planning process.  PBA has many years of 
experience in, amongst other areas, the assessment of flood risk, hydrology, 
flood defence and river engineering. 
1.1.6 It should be noted that the insurance market applies different tests to properties 
in relation to both determining premiums and, more fundamentally, determining 
the insurability of properties for flood risk.  Those undertaking development in 
areas which may be at risk of flooding are advised to contact their insurers or 
the Association of British Insurers (ABI) to seek further guidance prior to 
commencing development.

1.1.7 The findings of this FRA are based on data available at the time of the study 
(February 2015) and relate to the current development proposals as outlined in 
Section 2.  PBA does not warrant that the advice in this report will guarantee 
the availability of flood insurance either now or in the future.

Project Description 
2.1 
Overview 
2.1.1 The Project constitutes a Nationally Significant Infrastructure Project (NSIP) 
pursuant to the Planning Act 2008 and therefore requires a Development 
Consent Order (DCO) under that Act. 
2.1.2 The Project would comprise: 
� 
a new Power Generation Plant in the form of an Open Cycle Gas Turbine 
(OCGT) peaking power generating station, fuelled by natural gas with a 
rated electrical output of between 50 and 299 Megawatts (MW).  This is the 
output of the generating station as a whole, measured at the terminals of 
the generating equipment. The Power Generation Plant comprises: 
 generating equipment including one Gas Turbine Generator, with one 
exhaust gas flue stacks and Balance of Plant (together referred to as the 
‘Generating Equipment’), which are located within the ‘Generating 
Equipment Site’; 
 a new purpose built access road from Green Lane to the Generating 
Equipment Site (the ‘Access Road);  
 a temporary construction compound required during construction only 
(the ‘Laydown Area’); 
� 
a new gas pipeline connection to bring natural gas to the Generating 
Equipment from the National Transmission System (NTS) (the ‘Gas 
Connection’). This element incorporates an Above Ground Installation (AGI) 
at the point of connection to the NTS; and 
� 
a new electrical connection to export power from the Generating Equipment 
to the National Grid Electricity Transmission System (NETS) (the ‘Electrical 
Connection’). This element could be delivered in one of two ways:  
 The first option would involve one underground double circuit Tee-in. This 
would require one new tower (which will replace an existing tower and be 
located in the existing Grendon – Sundon transmission route corridor, 
thereby resulting in no net additional towers). This option would also 
require two SECs, one located on each side of the existing transmission 
line, and both circuits would then be connected via underground cables 
approximately 500 metres in length to a new substation (the ‘Substation’). 
This is hereafter referred to as "Option 1". 
 The second option is similar to Option 1 and would involve an 
underground single circuit turn in (requiring two cable circuits, one into 
and one out of the substation). This would require one new tower (which 
will again replace an existing tower and be located in the existing 
Grendon – Sundon transmission route corridor, thereby resulting in no 
net additional towers). This option would also require one larger SEC,

which could be located on either side of the existing transmission line, 
and both circuits would then be connected via underground cables 
approximately 500 metres in length to a new substation (the ‘Substation’). 
This is hereafter referred to as "Option 2". 
2.1.3 The Generating Equipment, Access Road and Laydown Area are together 
known as the ‘Power Generation Plant’ and are located within the ‘Power 
Generation Plant Site’.  
2.1.4 The Power Generation Plant, Gas Connection, and Electrical Connection, 
together with all access requirements are referred to as the ‘Project’ and are all 
integral to the generation of electricity and subsequent export of that electricity 
to the NETS. The land upon which the Project would be developed, or which 
would be required in order to facilitate the development of the Project, is referred 
to as the ‘Project Site’.  
2.1.5 As a peaking plant, the Generating Equipment would operate when there is a 
‘stress event’, such as a surge in demand or a sudden outage, and would also 
operate at times when renewable energy sources, such as wind and solar 
farms, cannot generate sufficient electricity due to their intermittent operation.  
The Generating Equipment would operate for up to a maximum of 2,250 hours 
per year.

Legislation, Guidance and Policy Context 
4.1 
National Policy Statements 
 
4.1.1 The principal planning policy for the determination of energy-related NSIPs is 
provided by the National Policy Statements issued by the Government’s 
Department for Climate Change.  The Overarching National Policy Statement 
for 
Energy 
(EN-1) 
identifies 
flood 
risk 
as 
a 
topic 
requiring 
consideration/assessment as part of energy-related projects and requires that: 
� 
Where the Project is likely to have effects on the water environment, the 
applicant should undertake an assessment of the existing status of, and 
impacts of the Project on, water quality, water resources and physical 
characteristics of the water environment; 
� 
An application should be accompanied by a Flood Risk Assessment 
(FRA) for energy projects of 1ha or greater in Flood Zone 1 and all 
energy projects in Flood Zones 2 and 3; 
� 
Where a project may be affected by or may increase flood risk, pre-
application discussions should be undertaken with the Environment 
Agency and other bodies; 
� 
Any requirements for sequential testing are satisfied; 
� 
Priority is given to the use of Sustainable Drainage Systems (SuDS). 
4.1.2 National Policy Statement for Fossil Fuel Electricity Generating Infrastructure 
(EN-2) outlines the factors influencing site selection for fossil fuel generating 
stations and also sets out additional policy on the potential impacts of energy 
infrastructure projects.  This includes policy on water quality and resource 
impacts and is concerned principally with water demand/consumption and the 
impacts of abstraction and discharge of cooling water.  NPS EN-2 does not set 
out additional policy in respect of flood risk. 
4.1.3 National Policy Statement for Electricity Networks Infrastructure (EN-5) 
provides the primary basis for decisions taken by the Secretary of State on 
applications it receives for electricity networks infrastructure and sets out the 
factors influencing route selection and the impacts that may arise from such 
development.  However, NPS EN-5 does not set out additional policy in 
respect of flood risk. 
4.2 
National Planning Policy Framework (March 2012) 
 
4.2.1 The National Planning Policy Framework (NPPF) and the accompanying 
Planning Practice Guidance sets out the Government’s national policy on 
development and flood risk and seeks to provide clarity on what is required at 
regional and local levels to ensure that flood risk is taken into account at all 
stages in the planning process, to avoid inappropriate development in areas at 
Flood Risk Assessment 
Millbrook Power Project 
 
 
 
 
31 
risk of flooding and to direct development away from areas at highest risk.  
The NPPF outlines a risk based approach to the planning process and is 
underpinned by the Sequential Test, which is designed to ensure that areas at 
little or no risk of flooding are developed in preference to areas at higher risk. 
Where, following application of the Sequential Test, it is not possible, or 
consistent with wider sustainability objectives, for the development to be 
located in zones with a lower probability of flooding, the Exception Test can be 
applied.  Essentially, the two parts of the Test require proposed development 
to show that it will provide wider sustainability benefits to the community that 
outweigh flood risk and that it will be safe for its lifetime, without increasing 
flood risk elsewhere.  The Test therefore provides a mechanism to allow 
necessary development to go ahead in situations where suitable sites at lower 
risk of flooding are not available. 
4.2.2 The NPPF requires that the spatial planning process should consider the 
possible impacts of climate change and contingency allowances are provided 
to enable impacts to be considered over the lifetime of the development. 
4.3 
The Flood Risk Regulations (2009) 
4.3.1 The Flood Risk Regulations transpose the EC Floods Directive (Directive 
2007/60/EC) into domestic law.  The regulations require that preliminary flood 
risk 
assessments 
are 
prepared 
by 
the 
Environment 
Agency 
and 
Unitary/County Authorities (Lead Local Flood Authorities) and that areas at 
significant potential risk of flooding are identified.  For these "significant risk" 
areas, hazard maps must be produced and flood risk management plans 
developed to reduce flood risk. 
4.4 
Flood and Water Management Act (2010) 
4.4.1 The Flood and Water Management Act received Royal Assent on 8th April 
2010 and takes forward some of the proposals set out in three previous 
strategy documents published by the UK Government: Future Water, Making 
Space for Water and the UK Government's response to the Sir Michael Pitt 
Review of the summer 2007 floods. In doing so it gives the Environment 
Agency a strategic overview of flood risk and gives local authorities 
responsibility for preparing and putting in place strategies for managing flood 
risk from groundwater, surface water and ordinary watercourses in their areas.  
4.4.2 The Act makes provisions for the establishment of SuDS Approval Bodies 
(SAB's), which will be the Unitary Authority or County Council in most cases, 
and the publication of National Standards in respect of the design, 
construction, maintenance and operation of drainage systems. Construction 
work which has drainage implications may not be commenced unless a 
drainage system for the work has been approved by the SAB. The SAB is also 
required to adopt drainage systems which have been designed and 
constructed in accordance with National Standards.

4.5 
Water Environment (Water Framework Directive) (England and Wales) 
Regulations 2003 
4.5.1 These regulations transpose the EU Water Framework Directive (2000/60/EC) 
(WFD) into law in England and Wales.  The WFD is a wide-ranging piece of 
European legislation that establishes a new legal framework for the protection, 
improvement and sustainable use of surface waters, coastal waters and 
groundwater across Europe in order to: 
� 
Promote sustainable water use; 
� 
Contribute to the mitigation of floods and droughts; 
� 
Prevent deterioration and enhance status of aquatic ecosystems, including 
groundwater; 
� 
Reduce pollution. 
4.5.2 Water management has historically been co-ordinated according to 
administrative or political boundaries. The WFD promotes an approach based 
on management by river basin - the natural geographical and hydrological 
unit. River basin management plans include clear objectives in respect of 
water quality and pollution control and a detailed account of how objectives 
are to be met within a prescribed timeframe. 
4.6 
The Environmental Permitting (England and Wales) Regulations 2010 
4.6.1 The Regulations as amended provide the regulatory framework under which 
discharges to controlled waters and other emissions to the environment are 
controlled. 
4.6.2 The Regulations also transpose the requirements of the Groundwater 
Directive into law in England and Wales. They place a duty on the 
Environment Agency to protect groundwater by prohibiting groundwater 
activities other than those carried out under a permit or exemption. 
Groundwater activities include discharges of pollutants to groundwater 
(whether direct or indirect).  
4.6.3 The Regulations therefore require that the direct or indirect discharge of 
pollutants to groundwater must be subject to prior authorisation and also allow 
notices to be served to control activities which may lead to discharges of 
pollutants to groundwater.  
4.7 
Water Resources Act 1991 
4.7.1 The Water Resources Act 1991 (WRA) came into effect in 1991 and sets out 
the responsibilities of the Environment Agency in relation to water pollution, 
resource management, flood defence, fisheries, and in some areas, 
navigation. The WRA regulates discharges to controlled waters, namely rivers, 
estuaries, coastal waters, lakes and groundwater. Discharge to controlled 
Flood Risk Assessment 
Millbrook Power Project 
 
 
 
 
33 
waters is only permitted with the consent of the Environment Agency. 
Similarly, a licence is required to abstract from controlled waters.  
4.8 
Land Drainage Act 1991 
4.8.1 The Act consolidates various enactments relating to Internal Drainage Boards 
and the functions of these Boards and local authorities in relation to land 
drainage.  Amongst other matters, the Act sets out provisions and powers in 
respect 
of 
the 
control 
of 
flow 
of 
watercourses 
and 
watercourse 
restoration/improvement works. 
4.9 
The Building Regulations 2010 
4.9.1 The Building Regulations 2010, Requirement H3, stipulates that rainwater 
from roofs and paved areas is carried away from the surface to discharge to 
one of the following, listed in order of priority: 
1. an adequate soakaway or some other adequate infiltration system, or 
where that is not reasonably practicable; 
2. a watercourse, or where that is not practicable; 
3. a sewer. 
4.10 Interim Code of Practice for Sustainable Drainage Systems (2004) 
4.10.1 This Code of Practice provides support for developers in promoting and 
implementing a sustainable approach to water management and in particular 
Sustainable Drainage Systems (SuDS), to ensure their long-term viability and 
to promote consistent use. The document sets out the key regulatory 
requirements that must be considered and adhered to before SuDS are 
installed and commissioned. 
4.11 Sewers for Adoption 7th Edition 
4.11.1 'Sewers for Adoption' is the standard in England and Wales for the design and 
construction of sewers to adoptable standards. It is a guide to assist 
developers in preparing their submission to a Sewerage Undertaker prior to 
entering an Adoption Agreement under Section 104 of the Water Industry Act 
1991. 
4.12 Surface Waters Plan - Plan for Strategic Management of Surface Waters 
and their Local Environment in the Forest of Marston Vale (Bedfordshire 
and River Ivel Internal Drainage Board and the Forest of Marston Vale, 
June 2002) 
4.12.1 This document was prepared to promote a series of policies that will 
encourage an integrated and sustainable approach to the management of 
surface waters in the context of major development in the area, including: 
Flood Risk Assessment 
Millbrook Power Project 
 
 
 
 
34 
� 
An integrated approach to flood risk management, surface water drainage 
and the water environment; 
� 
Promote government guidance such as PPS25 (since replaced by the 
NPPF), providing a framework for site-specific Flood Risk Assessments to 
be produced in support of planning applications; 
� 
Implementation of strategic solutions to surface water drainage and flood 
risk that are sustainable and offer opportunities for environmental and 
recreational gains. 
4.12.2 It should be noted that Rookery Pit lies outside of the Bedfordshire and River 
Ivel Internal Drainage Board’s area of jurisdiction. However, Mill Brook, which 
flows along the western side of the Pit, outfalls to Stewartby Lake located just 
to the west, which is a water body maintained by the Bedfordshire and River

4.13 Central Bedfordshire Council Local Flood Risk Management Strategy 
(February 2014) 
4.13.1 Central Bedfordshire Council, in its role as Lead Local Flood Authority (as 
defined by the Flood and Water Management Act, 2010), has prepared a 
Local Flood Risk Management Strategy.  The strategy addresses flood risk 
arising from surface water, groundwater and ordinary watercourses, sets out a 
number of objectives for managing flood risk and the actions and the 
measures identified to achieve these objectives.  The majority of the items set 
out in the strategy Action Plan are county-wide and the strategy does not 
identify any specific issues/actions/objectives for the area in the immediate 
vicinity of the Project Site. 
4.14 Preliminary Flood Risk Assessment 
4.14.1 In accordance with the requirements of the Flood Risk Regulations (2009), 
Central Bedfordshire Council, Bedford Borough Council and Milton Keynes 
Council commissioned the Bedford Group of Drainage Boards to prepare a 
Preliminary Flood Risk Assessment.  This constitutes a high level screening 
exercise to identify significant flood risk areas associated with flooding from 
surface water, groundwater and ordinary watercourses.  The assessment did 
not identify any significant flood risk areas and, being a high level, strategic 
study, it does not contain any information in respect of flood risk associated 
with the Mill Brook catchment. 
4.15 Strategic Flood Risk Assessment 
4.15.1 In 2008, Mid Bedfordshire District Council commissioned WSP Limited to 
prepare a Stage 2 Strategic Flood Risk Assessment to inform preparation of 
the Local Development Framework for the District.  The assessment is based 
upon hydraulic modelling data and Environment Agency flood mapping data 
available in 2008 and focuses upon fluvial flood risk associated with likely 
future growth areas and potential development sites (for future housing

supply).  The assessment does not present any detailed/site-specific 
information in respect of flood risk associated with the Mill Brook catchment. 
4.15.2 To inform spatial planning across the District, South Bedfordshire District 
Council commissioned Scott Wilson Ltd to prepare a Stage 1 Strategic Flood 
Risk Assessment.  The 2008 study is based upon hydraulic modelling data 
and Environment Agency flood mapping data available in 2008 and, being 
relatively ‘high level’ in nature, does not present any detailed/site-specific 
information in respect of flood risk in the vicinity of Rookery Pit.

Site and Surroundings 
5.1 
Site Location and Description 
5.1.1 The Project Site is partly located within 'The Rookery', which comprises two 
former clay pits (Rookery North and Rookery South) separated by an east-
west spine of unexcavated clay. 
5.1.2 The Rookery is located in the Marston Vale between Milton Keynes and 
Bedford, approximately 3km north of Ampthill, a local market town, and 7km 
south-west of Bedford. 
5.1.3 The general location of the Project Site is shown in Figure 1, Appendix A. 
5.1.4 The Generating Equipment Site, Laydown Area and parts of the Access Road, 
Gas Connection and Electrical Connection would be located within part of 
Rookery South Pit, which is approximately 95ha in area and bounded by steep 
clay banks that are varied in nature and substrate.  The level of the pit base 
currently varies between approximately 10m and 15m below ground level and 
includes open water, reed beds, pools and bare inundated clay.  The land that 
remains at the original ground level (approximately 42maOD) around the 
periphery of Rookery South Pit is predominantly bare ground that has 
previously been cleared of vegetation and maintained in this state for 
approximately the last 28 years. 
5.1.5 The Gas Connection and Electrical Connection would be located largely 
outside of Rookery South Pit, in a mostly undeveloped, agricultural landscape 
which comprises large arable fields, small areas of woodland, hedgerows and 
a number of drainage ditches. 
5.1.6 Access to the site is from the north near Stewartby, via the A421 Bedford 
Road and Green Lane.  A junction on Green Lane leads to an access track 
which extends south, along the western fringe of Rookery North Pit and into 
Rookery South Pit. 
5.2 
Wider Setting 
5.2.1 
The former brickworks buildings and chimneys of the Stewartby Brickworks 
and the settlement of Stewartby itself lie to the north of The Rookery. Other 
nearby residential areas include: Houghton Conquest approximately 1.5km to 
the east of the Project Site boundary; Marston Moretaine approximately 1.2km 
to the west and Millbrook approximately 400m to the south.  These residential 
areas are shown on Figure 1, Appendix A. 
5.2.2 
To the west of the Project Site is the Marston Vale Millennium Country Park.  
Millbrook Proving Ground, a vehicle testing ground covering 285ha, is located 
to the south-west of Rookery South Pit. 
Flood Risk Assessment 
Millbrook Power Project 
 
 
 
 
37 
5.2.3 
Overhead power lines run west to east, to the south of Rookery South Pit, and 
a number of public footpaths are located in and around the Project Site, linking 
it to the wider Marston Vale.  
5.2.4 
The closest residential dwelling to the Power Generation Plant Site is South 
Pillinge Farm, located approximately 130m to the west of the western 
boundary of the Project Site.  South Pillinge Farm is separated from the 
Project Site by a small deciduous woodland.  
5.3 
Watercourses and Water Bodies 
5.3.1 
The Mill Brook watercourse flows in a northerly direction along the western 
flank of Rookery South Pit.  The Brook rises in the vicinity of Millbrook, 
approximately 1.5km to the south of Rookery South Pit, and drains a 
predominantly rural catchment of approximately 4.5km2.  It passes through a 
culvert beneath the Marston Vale Railway Line and ultimately outfalls to 
Stewartby Lake, a further 400m downstream. 
5.3.2 
A tributary watercourse draining a catchment of 1.5km2 passes to the south of 
Rookery South Pit within the Project Site and joins the Mill Brook to the east of 
South Pillinge Farm (Figure 1, Appendix A). 
5.4 
Flood Defences 
5.4.1 There are no flood defences within/adjacent to the Project Site. 
5.5 
Groundwater Vulnerability 
5.5.1 The 
EA 
publish 
on 
their 
website 
(http://apps.environment-
agency.gov.uk/wiyby/default.aspx) indicative Source Protection Zones (SPZs) 
for 2000 groundwater sources such as wells, boreholes and springs used for 
public drinking water supply. The zones define areas where a range of human 
activities may damage/pollute groundwater. The maps show three main zones 
(inner, outer and total catchment) and a fourth zone of special interest. 
5.5.2 The location of a site within a SPZ will determine the level of restriction applied 
to a range of activities within the context of EA policy.  Restricted activities, as 
defined by "Policy and Practice for the Protection of Groundwater" (EA, 1992) 
are: 
� 
Groundwater abstraction; 
� 
Physical disturbance of aquifers and groundwater flow; 
� 
Waste disposal to land; 
� 
Land contamination; 
� 
Disposal of liquid effluent, sludges and slurries to land; 
� 
Discharges to underground strata;

� 
Diffuse pollution of groundwater; and 
� 
Additional activities or developments which pose a threat to groundwater 
quality. 
5.5.3 Examination of EA mapping shows that the Project Site does not lie within any 
SPZ and as such it is envisaged that the EA would not object to the proposals, 
subject to standard conditions.

Planning Background 
6.1 
Context 
6.1.1 The Environment Act 1995 requires owners and operators of mineral sites to 
periodically update the planning conditions that regulate and control extraction 
operations.  This review process is known as the Review of Old Minerals 
Permission (ROMP) and aims to allow the minerals Planning Authority to 
update the older mineral planning permissions by imposing modern operating, 
restoration and aftercare conditions. 
 
6.1.2 O&H Properties Ltd (O&H), as landowner of Rookery Pit, submitted an 
application for the determination of new conditions in June 2009 (application 
number: BC/CM/2000/8).  This ROMP review application set out details of a 
Low Level Restoration Scheme (LLRS), the scope of which is summarised 
below and set out in the Drawings presented in Appendix B. 
6.2 
The Low Level Restoration Scheme (LLRS) 
6.2.1 The LLRS seeks to restore the former clay workings to low-intensity 
agricultural use, with measures included to enhance biodiversity and 
landscape.  The LLRS works within Rookery South Pit comprise: 
� 
the re-profiling of the base of the pit involving the extraction of soils and 
clays from the permitted extraction area on the southern side with re-
grading of the base of the pit to an approximate level of 15mbgl; 
� 
implementation of surface water drainage measures and construction of 
an attenuation pond and pumping station in order to facilitate a managed 
surface water drainage strategy; 
� 
a landscape strategy to include planting on the boundary of Rookery 
South Pit and the margins of the attenuation pond;  
� 
provision of buttresses to the southern, eastern and northern slopes to 
ensure the long-term stability of those slopes, and re-grading through 
excavation; 
� 
provision of a series of permissive footpaths around the perimeter of 
Rookery North Pit and around the attenuation pond within Rookery South 
Pit; 
� 
provision of an access ramp into Rookery South Pit from Rookery North 
Pit which connects to Green Lane, Stewartby via an existing track along 
the western side of Rookery North Pit. Note that the ramp and existing 
track are both of an agricultural standard; and 
� 
provision of a further, smaller access track into and out of Rookery South 
Pit from the south side of the pit connecting with Station Lane, near 
Millbrook Station.

6.2.2 
To facilitate the proposed LLRS works, extraction of clay from a currently un-
worked area situated directly to the south of the existing extent of Rookery 
South Pit will be undertaken. This area covers approximately 25 ha and forms 
part of the existing minerals extraction consent boundary, but has not 
historically been subject to excavation works. Deposits won from this area will 
provide material for use in the restoration, re-profiling and buttressing work to 
Rookery South Pit together with the implementation of a landscape and 
ecology strategy, which will integrate with ecological mitigation works and 
strategic landscape planting in Rookery North Pit. 
6.2.3 
Once the LLRS works are completed, Rookery South Pit will be approximately 
15m below the surrounding ground level in the vicinity of the Generating 
Equipment Site, Laydown Area and the Substation. 
6.2.4 
The LLRS works will be completed prior to the commencement of construction 
works for the Project, with the possible exception of buttressing and re-
profiling to the eastern side of Rookery South Pit, which has no bearing on the 
Project as it lies outside the boundary of the Project Site. 
6.2.5 
The LLRS therefore provides the baseline for the purposes of assessing (i) the 
nature of flood risk constraints associated with watercourses and water bodies 
within and in the vicinity of the site and (ii) the likely nature of the impact of the 
development proposals from a flood risk perspective and associated mitigation 
measures.

Stakeholder Consultation 
7.1.1 In preparing this FRA, consultation has been undertaken with the Environment 
Agency (EA) and the Bedfordshire and River Ivel Internal Drainage Board 
(IDB). 
7.1.2 The purpose of this consultation was to: 
� 
identify the issues to be addressed; 
� 
agree design criteria/principles; 
� 
agree the methodology for the technical assessment/analysis required to 
inform the FRA. 
7.1.3 A joint FRA ‘scoping’ meeting was held with both the EA and IDB in December 
2014, at which the scope of the FRA and associated methodology and design 
principles were agreed.  A copy of the meeting notes summarising the scope 
of matters discussed and agreed is enclosed within Appendix C.

Flood Risk Assessment 
8.1 
Tidal/Coastal 
8.1.1 Flooding arising from tidal or coastal sources is not an issue at this inland 
location. 
8.2 
Groundwater 
8.2.1 Information in respect of the geological and hydrogeological setting of the site 
is set out in the report titled ‘Millbrook Power Project, Phase 1 Ground 
Condition Assessment (Contamination and Ground Stability), December 
2014’, prepared by Peter Brett Associates LLP.  According to this report the 
solid geology of the area generally consists of the following sequence of 
strata: 
� 
the Peterborough Member of the Oxford Clay Formation; 
� 
underlain by the Kellaways Formation (including the Kellaways Clay 
Member); 
� 
underlain by the Cornbrash Formation (limestone) and the Blisworth Clay 
Formation and Blisworth Limestone Formation at depth. 
8.2.2 More specifically, the report indicates that the geological sequence in the base 
of Rookery South Pit comprises made ground in the form of Callow Clay fill 
(superficial deposits and weathered Oxford Clay not suitable for brickmaking 
which was removed and cast back into the Pit), underlain by Oxford Clay.   
8.2.3 The report also indicates that the clayey deposits of the Callow Clay Fill, 
Oxford Clay, Kellaways Clay and Blisworth Clay Formation can be considered 
as being aquicludes/aquitards (an impermeable body of rock or stratum of 
sediment that acts as a barrier to the flow of groundwater).  According to the 
report, the Cornbrash Formation is classified as a Minor Aquifer, but has been 
shown to be characterised by low permeability, such that it is considered to be 
an aquitard.  The Blisworth Limestone Formation is similarly characterised by 
low permeability. 
8.2.4 The report indicates that groundwater elevations in the base of Rookery South 
Pit are around 28.7mAOD (approximately 0.3m bgl). 
8.2.5 Enquiries conducted as part of this assessment and information collated as 
part of the aforementioned Ground Condition Assessment have not identified 
any evidence of elevated groundwater levels or records of groundwater 
flooding.  Flooding arising from groundwater sources is not therefore 
considered to be an issue at this location.

8.3 
Surface Water 
8.3.1 The site comprises a former clay pit that is being restored to low-intensity 
agricultural use.  Surface water accumulating within the Pit is currently 
pumped to the Mill Brook, in accordance with the terms of an existing Consent 
to Discharge (EA reference PRCNF/14024) granted under Schedule 10 of the 
Water Resources Act 1991. 
8.3.2 The updated Flood Map for Surface Water (published on the Environment 
Agency’s website (http://apps.environment-agency.gov.uk/wiyby/37837.aspx) 
indicates that approximately 50% of Rookery South Pit may be affected by 
surface water flooding.  However, this mapping is based upon the existing 
topography of the Pit base and is not therefore representative of the surface 
water drainage regime that will exist following implementation of the LLRS (as 
set out in Section 6 above). 
8.3.3 As noted above, the LLRS provides the baseline for the purposes of assessing 
the nature of flood risk constraints.  The LLRS works include the 
implementation of a surface water drainage strategy, comprising construction 
of a surface water balancing pond within the north-west corner of Rookery 
South Pit, the excavation of associated surface water interceptor channels 
within the base of the Pit and provision of a pumping station to enable surface 
water to be pumped to Rookery North Pit and the Mill Brook.  The surface 
water drainage strategy has been designed to accommodate the Covanta 
RRF, along with other future development, including the Millbrook Power 
Project.  Proposals in respect of surface water management are set out in 
Section 10 of this report. 
8.3.4 It is therefore concluded that surface water will be appropriately managed 
such that flood risk arising from surface water sources, both within and outside 
the Pit, is not considered to be an issue at this location. 
8.4 
Watercourses 
8.4.1 The EA publishes floodplain maps on the internet (http://apps.environment-
agency.gov.uk/wiyby/37837.aspx).  These maps show the possible extent of 
fluvial flooding for the 1 in 100 year flood (that which would have a 1% 
probability of being exceeded each year) or the possible extent of tidal 
flooding to a 1 in 200 year event. Also shown is the possible extent of flooding 
arising from a 1 in 1,000 year event (0.1% probability). 
8.4.2 In this instance, the EA’s flood maps do not extend to include the Mill Brook 
and its tributary on account of the small size of the contributing catchment 
area. 
8.4.3 The nature of flood risk associated with the Mill Brook and its Tributary was 
originally assessed in 2008 (‘the LLRS modelling study’) as part of the ROMP 
review application and the findings reflected in the design of the LLRS.  Flood 
risk was assessed by developing a HEC-RAS hydraulic model using a 
Flood Risk Assessment 
Millbrook Power Project 
 
 
 
 
44 
topographic survey of Rookery South Pit and the watercourse corridor and 
associated structures/crossings undertaken in 2003. 
8.4.4 This analysis demonstrated that floodwater may discharge into the Pit during 
the 1 in 100 year flood event, the discharge occurring in a very localised area 
along the upper reach of the Mill Brook Tributary (Figure 2, Appendix D).  The 
LLRS was subsequently designed to cater for this flooding mechanism – 
floodwater being allowed to discharge into the Pit on a ‘managed’ basis, such 
that it would be intercepted and routed to the surface water attenuation pond 
(the routing channels and attenuation pond being designed to accommodate 
both floodwater discharge from the Mill Brook Tributary and surface water run-
off arising from within the Pit itself).  This strategy was agreed with both the 
Environment Agency and the Bedfordshire and River Ivel Internal Drainage 
Board (IDB). 
8.4.5 The LLRS modelling study was refined and updated in 2010 in support of 
proposals for development within the north-west area of Rookery South Pit 
(the Covanta RRF) and following further topographic survey of the Mill Brook 
corridor (the Covanta modelling study).   
8.4.6 Following consultation with the EA and IDB in December 2014, it was agreed 
that the 2010 Covanta modelling study provides the best available data in 
respect of flood risk associated with the Mill Brook such that it should be taken 
forward and used to inform the FRA prepared in support of the Project.  
However, it was noted that in the time that has elapsed since the 2010 study 
was concluded, the Flood Estimation Handbook (FEH) methodology and 
associated database (used to estimate flood flows for the purposes of 
hydraulic modelling) has been revised/updated.  It was therefore agreed that 
the 2010 assessment of flood flows should be reviewed/validated before being 
used to inform the FRA prepared in support of the Millbrook Power Project. 
8.4.7 A summary of the revised and updated FEH analysis is set out in the 
Technical Note presented in Appendix D.  This demonstrates that flood flow 
estimates based upon the current FEH methodology and database are lower 
than those derived in 2010 as part of the Covanta modelling study.  As agreed 
with the EA and IDB (ref correspondence included in Appendix C), it has not 
therefore been necessary to revisit the 2010 Covanta modelling study and this 
study has therefore been taken forward and used as the basis for this FRA. 
8.4.8 The 2010 Covanta modelling study validated the findings of the earlier (2008) 
LLRS modelling study.  In summary, it was found that: 
� 
During the 1 in 100 year event floodwater may discharge into Rookery 
South Pit from a localised area along the upper reach of the Mill Brook 
Tributary.  Floodwater discharge does not occur along the main branch of 
the Mill Brook; 
� 
Discharge into the Pit from the Mill Brook Tributary increases marginally 
during the 1 in 100 year plus climate change event.  Floodwater discharge 
does not occur along the main branch of the Mill Brook. 
Flood Risk Assessment 
Millbrook Power Project 
 
 
 
 
45 
� 
During the 1 in 1,000 year event, floodwater may discharge from the upper 
reach of the Mill Brook Tributary and also over the right (eastern) bank of 
the main branch of the Mill Brook immediately upstream of the culvert 
beneath the Bedford to Bletchley Railway. 
The 2010 Covanta modelling study also indicated that the volume of 
floodwater influx into the Pit associated with the 1 in 100 year plus climate 
change flood event amounted to 7,500m3.  This represents a reduction from 
the volume of 23,000m3 assessed as part of the LLRS modelling study 
undertaken in 2008 in support of the ROMP review application and is a result 
of the improved resolution of the hydraulic model developed in 2010. 
8.5 
Extent and Depth of Flooding 
8.5.1 Hydraulic modelling has demonstrated that floodwater arising from the Mill 
Brook and its Tributary may discharge into Rookery South Pit during the 1 in 
100 year and the 1 in 100 year plus climate change events. 
8.5.2 However, as outlined in Section 6 above, the LLRS includes (i) re-profiling of 
the base of the pit to create an elevated platform and (ii) implementation of a 
surface water drainage strategy, comprising construction of a surface water 
balancing pond within the north-west corner of Rookery South Pit, the 
excavation of associated surface water interceptor channels within the base of 
the Pit and provision of a pumping station to enable surface water to be 
pumped to Rookery North Pit and the Mill Brook.  The surface water drainage 
scheme has been designed to cater for floodwater influx into the Pit from the 
Mill Brook and its Tributary (the design and capacity of the surface water 
drainage scheme is discussed further in Section 10 of this report). 
8.5.3 On this basis, and within the context of Tables 1 and 3 of the NPPF Planning 
Practice Guidance, the Power Generation Plant site is categorised as Flood 
Zone 1 – Low Probability.  This Flood Zone classification has been agreed 
with the Environment Agency (ref correspondence included in Appendix C). 
Table 1 Flood Zones 
Zone 1 Low Probability 
Definition 
This zone comprises land assessed as having a less than 1 in 1000 
annual probability of river or sea flooding in any year (<0.1%). 
Appropriate uses 
All uses of land are appropriate in this zone 
FRA requirements For development proposals on sites comprising one hectare or above 
the vulnerability to flooding from other sources as well as from river and 
sea flooding, and the potential to increase flood risk elsewhere through 
the addition of hard surfaces and the effect of the new development on 
surface water run-off, should be incorporated in a FRA. This need only 
be brief unless the factors above or other local considerations require 
particular attention. 
Policy aims 
In this zone, developers and local authorities should seek opportunities 
to reduce the overall level of flood risk in the area and beyond through 
the layout and form of the development, and the appropriate application 
of sustainable drainage systems. 
Zone 2 Medium Probability 
Flood Risk Assessment 
Millbrook Power Project 
 
 
 
 
46 
Definition 
This zone comprises land assessed as having between a 1 in 100 and 1 
in 1000 annual probability of river flooding (1% – 0.1%) or between a 1 in 
200 and 1 in 1000 annual probability of sea flooding (0.5% – 0.1%) in 
any year. 
Appropriate uses 
Essential infrastructure and the water-compatible, less vulnerable and 
more vulnerable uses, as set out in Table 2, are appropriate in this zone.  
The highly vulnerable uses are only appropriate in this zone if the 
Exception Test is passed. 
FRA requirements All development proposals in this zone should be accompanied by a 
FRA. 
Policy aims 
In this zone, developers and local authorities should seek opportunities 
to reduce the overall level of flood risk in the area through the layout and 
form of the development, and the appropriate application of sustainable 
drainage systems. 
Zone 3a High Probability 
Definition 
This zone comprises land assessed as having a 1 in 100 or greater 
annual probability of river flooding (>1%) or a 1 in 200 or greater annual 
probability of flooding from the sea (>0.5%) in any year. 
 
 
Appropriate uses 
The water-compatible and less vulnerable uses of land (Table 2) are 
appropriate in this zone.  The highly vulnerable uses should not be 
permitted in this zone. 
 
The more vulnerable uses and essential infrastructure should only be 
permitted in this zone if the Exception Test is passed. Essential 
infrastructure permitted in this zone should be designed and constructed 
to remain operational and safe for users in times of flood. 
FRA requirements All development proposals in this zone should be accompanied by a 
FRA. 
Policy aims 
 
 
 
 
 
In this zone, developers and local authorities should seek opportunities 
to: 
i. reduce the overall level of flood risk in the area through the layout and 
form of the development and the appropriate application of sustainable 
drainage systems; 
ii. relocate existing development to land in zones with a lower probability 
of flooding; and 
iii. create space for flooding to occur by restoring functional floodplain 
and flood flow pathways and by identifying, allocating and safeguarding 
open space for flood storage. 
Zone 3b The Functional Floodplain 
Definition 
This zone comprises land where water has to flow or be stored in times 
of flood. 
 
Local planning authorities should identify in their Strategic Flood Risk 
Assessments areas of functional floodplain and its boundaries 
accordingly, in agreement with the Environment Agency. The 
identification of functional floodplain should take account of local 
circumstances and not be defined solely on rigid probability parameters. 
But land which would flood with an annual probability of 1 in 20 (5%) or 
greater in any year, or is designed to flood in an extreme (0.1%) flood, 
should provide a starting point for consideration and discussions to 
identify the functional floodplain.

Appropriate uses 
Only the water-compatible uses and the essential infrastructure listed in 
Table 2 that has to be there should be permitted in this zone. It should 
be designed and constructed to: 
– remain operational and safe for users in times of flood; 
– result in no net loss of floodplain storage; 
– not impede water flows; and 
– not increase flood risk elsewhere. 
 
Essential infrastructure in this zone should pass the Exception Test. 
FRA requirements 
 
All development proposals in this zone should be accompanied by a

Policy aims 
In this zone, developers and local authorities should seek opportunities 
to: 
 
i. reduce the overall level of flood risk in the area through the layout and 
form of the development and the appropriate application of sustainable 
drainage systems; 
 
ii. relocate existing development to land with a lower probability of 
flooding. 
8.5.4 The Power Generation Plant site is located within the lowest probability flood 
zone and, as such, there is no requirement to apply the sequential test.

10 Surface Water Management 
10.1 LLRS Surface Water Drainage Strategy 
10.1.1 As outlined in Section 6 above, a surface water drainage strategy will be 
implemented as part of the LLRS works.  The LLRS works are taking place 
independently of the Project and will be completed prior to the commencement 
of construction works for the Project. 
10.1.2 The principal components of the surface water drainage strategy are 
presented in Drawing 3.1, Appendix B and may be summarised as follows: 
� 
the base of the pit will have been re-profiled such that surface water run-
off sheds towards the north-west corner of the pit; 
� 
construction of a surface water balancing pond within the north-west 
corner of Rookery South Pit; 
� 
excavation of surface water interceptor channels within the base of the Pit 
to intercept surface water run-off and convey it to the attenuation pond; 
� 
surface water run-off that collects within the Rookery South Pit attenuation 
pond will be pumped to Rookery North Pit as a strategic attenuation facility 
at a rate of 100l/s, and to the Mill Brook at a rate of 23l/s (in accordance 
with the existing Consent to Discharge, EA reference PRCNF/14024); 
� 
the normal water level within Rookery North Pit will have been drawn 
down from 36m to 35m AOD to provide an additional storage volume, 
thereby allowing Rookery North to be used as a strategic attenuation 
facility in higher order rainfall events; 
� 
a gravity return connection will allow surface water to be discharged from 
Rookery North back to the attenuation pond in Rookery South at a rate of 
no more than 23l/s. 
Design Parameters 
10.1.3 The design parameters adopted for the purposes of designing the LLRS 
surface water drainage strategy are as follows: 
Impermeable Area 
10.1.4 Given the nature of the pit and its surrounding clay catchment, it was assumed 
that the base of the pit, the side slopes of the pit and the small areas of land 
draining towards the pit are 100% impermeable. The total impermeable area 
assumed was approximately 105ha, the boundary of which is shown on 
Drawing No. 3.1 contained within Appendix B.

10.1.5 The sizing of the attenuation pond was undertaken using catchment specific 
rainfall parameters derived from the Flood Estimation Handbook (FEH). 
Volumetric Run-off Coefficient 
10.1.6 A volumetric run-off coefficient (Cv) of 0.85 was adopted in the sizing of the 
attenuation pond. 
Climate Change 
10.1.7 In accordance with the NPPF and associated Planning Practice Guidance, the 
attenuation pond was sized to allow for an increase of up to 30% in rainfall 
intensity due to the effects of climate change. 
Sizing of the Attenuation Pond 
10.1.8 The attenuation pond has been sized to accommodate rainfall events up to 
and including the 1 in 100 year event plus climate change (taken as an 
increase of 30% in rainfall intensity) with a 1 in 10 year plus climate change 
event following within one week of the 1 in 100 year rainfall event. The 
attenuation pond is a ‘wet’ pond containing a 0.5m normal water depth, a 
further 2m of storage depth (total depth of water when full of 2.5m), 1 in 3 side 
slopes and a 1.0m freeboard. 
Mill Brook Floodwater Influx 
10.1.9 In addition to catering for surface water run-off arising from within Rookery 
South Pit, the attenuation pond has been designed to accommodate 
floodwater influx from the Mill Brook and its Tributary associated with the 1 in 
1000 year flood event. 
Storage Volumes 
10.1.10 In addition to assessing the quantum of surface water storage required to 
accommodate the 1 in 100 year plus climate change event, the design of the 
surface water drainage infrastructure brought forward as part of the LLRS was 
informed by consideration of ‘residual risk’ scenarios, including: 
� 
Pumping station failure and; 
� 
A 1 in 10 year plus climate change follow-on rainfall event occurring within 
one week of the 1 in 100 year plus climate change event. 
10.1.11 Storage volumes for the various design scenarios, defined as part of the LLRS 
design process, are summarised in Table 2 below:

10.1.12 As set out in the table above, the Rookery South Pit attenuation pond has 
been sized to provide adequate storage to accommodate the 1 in 100 year 
plus climate change rainfall event, followed by the 1 in 10 year plus climate 
change rainfall event (i.e. total storage for surface water run-off amounts to 
193,005m3).  Storage capacity also caters for floodwater influx from the Mill 
Brook associated with the 1 in 100 year plus climate change event (23,000m3), 
such that the total volume of storage within the pond (including freeboard) 
amounts to 216,005m3. 
10.2 Proposed Project Site Surface Water Drainage 
Generating Equipment Site 
10.2.1 Surface water run-off arising from internal roads and areas of hardstanding will 
be conveyed by a private, gravity surface water drainage network to the LLRS 
interceptor channels, ultimately outfalling to the LLRS surface water balancing 
pond.  The private, gravity surface water drainage network will be designed in 
accordance with the requirements of the Building Regulations and BS EN 752. 
Flood Risk Assessment 
Millbrook Power Project 
 
 
 
 
52 
10.2.2 Surface water run-off that may be mobilised as overland flows during extreme 
rainfall events will be conveyed by the internal roads to the LLRS drainage 
system.  Site levels will therefore be designed accordingly. 
Access Road 
10.2.3 Surface water run-off from the access road extending from Green Lane will be 
conveyed via a gravity, highway drainage network and will outfall to the LLRS 
surface water balancing pond.  Highway drainage will be designed in 
accordance with the requirements of the Design Manual for Roads and 
Bridges.  Surface water run-off that may be mobilised as overland flows during 
extreme rainfall events will be conveyed within the highway cross-section. 
Gas Connection 
10.2.4 The connection comprises a buried pipeline, such that it will not give rise to an 
increase in impermeable area within the catchment of the Mill Brook and 
impact upon the surface water run-off regime. 
10.2.5 The only permanent above ground structure associated with the gas 
connection is the Above Ground Installation (AGI) at the point of connection to 
the National Transmission System.  It is currently envisaged that surface water 
run-off arising from areas of hardstanding associated with the AGI will be 
managed/controlled using a soakaway or other similar infiltration method.  
Infiltration testing will be undertaken as part of the detailed design process. 
Electrical Connection 
10.2.6 The connection comprises an underground cable/circuit, such that it will not 
give rise to an increase in impermeable area within the catchment of the Mill 
Brook and impact upon the surface water run-off regime. 
10.2.7 The substation is the only permanent above ground structure associated with 
the electrical connection.  Surface water run-off arising from the substation will 
be conveyed to the LLRS interceptor channels, ultimately outfalling to the 
LLRS surface water balancing pond. 
10.3 Review of The Project within the context of the LLRS Surface Water 
Drainage Strategy 
10.3.1 As summarised above, the surface water drainage infrastructure brought 
forward as part of the LLRS has been designed to cater for all future 
development within Rookery South Pit, including the consented Covanta RRF 
project. 
10.3.2 In order to establish whether the Millbrook Power Project is ‘compatible’ with 
the LLRS drainage strategy (i.e. such that no further mitigation measures are 
required as part of the Project), the nature/extent of the contributing catchment 
area associated with the Project has been reviewed.  This review has 
concluded that: 
Flood Risk Assessment 
Millbrook Power Project 
 
 
 
 
53 
� 
The Generating Equipment, substation, temporary Laydown Area and 
southern part of the Access Road fall within the surface water drainage 
catchment defined for the purposes of designing the LLRS surface water 
drainage infrastructure (i.e. such that the LLRS drainage strategy caters 
for  surface water run-off arising from these areas); 
� 
The length of Access Road extending from Green Lane to the north-west 
corner of Rookery South Pit falls outside the surface water drainage 
catchment defined for the purposes of designing the LLRS surface water 
drainage infrastructure. 
10.3.3 The additional impermeable area associated with the length of Access Road 
extending from Green Lane to the north-west corner of Rookery South Pit 
equates to approximately 17,200m2 and it is proposed that surface water run-
off from this area drains to the Rookery South Pit attenuation pond.  This will 
therefore give rise to an increase in the area contributing to the pond.  The 
impact of this additional contributing area draining to the pond has been 
assessed using the MicroDrainage design software and using design 
parameters previously established in respect of the LLRS.   
10.3.4 Storage volumes for the various design scenarios, defined as part of the LLRS 
design process, and taking account of the additional impermeable area 
associated with the northern part of the Access Road, are summarised in 
Table 3 below:

29.38 
 
10.3.5 As set out in the table above, allowing for the additional impermeable area 
associated with the northern part of the Access Road, the storage volume 
required to cater for run-off associated with the 1 in 100 year plus climate 
change rainfall event, followed by the 1 in 10 year plus climate change rainfall 
event, increases from 193,005m3 to 198,283m3.  Allowing for floodwater influx 
from the Mill Brook associated with the 1 in 100 year plus climate change 
event, the total volume of storage required reduces from 216,005m3 to 
205,783m3.  This reduction in the total volume of storage required is due to the 
reduced volume of floodwater influx from the Mill Brook, defined by the 2010 
Covanta modelling study. 
10.3.6 The review set out above therefore demonstrates that the surface water 
attenuation pond brought forward as part of the LLRS offers adequate storage 
capacity to accommodate surface water run-off from the additional 
impermeable area associated with the length of Access Road extending from 
Green Lane to the north-west corner of Rookery South Pit.  On this basis, the 
Millbrook Power Project is ‘compatible’ with the LLRS drainage strategy, such 
that no further mitigation measures are required as part of The Project. 
10.4 Extreme Flooding (0.1% Probability Event) 
10.4.1 As set out in Section 8 above, the hydraulic modelling analysis has assessed 
flood risk associated with the 1 in 1,000 year event and this has shown that 
floodwater may discharge from the upper reach of the Mill Brook Tributary and 
also over the right (eastern) bank of the main branch of the Mill Brook 
immediately upstream of the culvert beneath the Bedford to Bletchley Railway. 
10.4.2 As explained above, the LLRS surface water drainage scheme has been 
designed to cater for both surface water run-off and floodwater influx into the 
Pit from the Mill Brook and its Tributary.  Table 4 below summarises the 
storage requirements associated with the 1 in 1,000 year event.

28.67 
10.4.3 As outlined above, the total volume of storage within the pond (including 
freeboard) exceeds 200,000m3.  The surface water attenuation pond therefore 
offers adequate storage capacity to accommodate both surface water run-off 
and floodwater influx into the Pit from the Mill Brook and its Tributary 
associated with the 1 in 1,000 year event. 
10.5 Pollution Control 
10.5.1 The Project includes the following potential sources of oil contamination: 
� 
Oil-filled transformers; 
� 
Lubrication systems for the Generating Equipment; 
� 
Oil storage and; 
� 
Areas of hardstanding for oil delivery vehicles. 
10.5.2 All designated oil retaining areas will include secondary containment 
measures (bunds) designed to contain 110% of the volume of oil stored. 
10.5.3 The surface water drainage system serving potentially contaminated oil 
retaining areas will pass surface water run-off through a Class 1 Full Retention 
Oil Separator (as set out in BS EN 858) prior to discharging surface water to 
the LLRS drainage system. 
10.5.4 All private surface water drains will pass surface water run-off through an oil 
interceptor prior to outfalling to the LLRS surface water drainage system. 
10.5.5 Surface water run-off arising from the access road will pass through an oil 
interceptor prior to outfalling to the LLRS surface water balancing pond.  
Highway drainage outfalls will include a penstock control to enable 
containment of contaminated run-off.

11 Climate Change 
11.1.1 Table 2 of the Environment Agency’s ‘Climate change allowances for 
planners’ guidance (September 2013) suggests that initial research has 
indicated that by 2115 peak river flows could have increased by up to 20%.  
There is much uncertainty regarding climate change but any increase in flows 
would result in more frequent and more extensive flooding. 
11.1.2 The possible effects of a 20% increase in flood flows in the Mill Brook and its 
Tributary have been assessed (Section 8 of this report).  Although the analysis 
indicates that the volume of floodwater discharge into Rookery South Pit from 
the upper reach of the Mill Brook Tributary may increase as a result of climate 
change, it has been shown that the surface water conveyance and storage 
infrastructure within the Pit offers adequate capacity to accommodate such 
changes. 
11.1.3 Table 2 of the Environment Agency’s ‘Climate change allowances for 
planners’ guidance also states that peak rainfall intensity may increase by up 
to 30% by 2115 and that the average intensity of rainfall is expected to 
increase.  Such changes could result in increased volumes of run-off from the 
site. 
11.1.4 Given the anticipated design life of the Project, and based upon the 
recommended contingency allowances set out in Table 2 of the Environment 
Agency’s ‘Climate change allowances for planners’ guidance, a 20% increase 
in peak rainfall intensity would typically be adopted for the purposes of 
designing a surface water drainage strategy to accommodate the effects of 
climate change.  However, given the nature and location of the Project, the 
highest contingency allowance of 30% increase in peak rainfall intensity has 
been adopted in this instance. 
Flood Risk Assessment 
Millbrook Power Project

12 Residual Risk 
12.1.1 Hydraulic modelling analysis indicates that floodwater may discharge into 
Rookery South Pit from a localised area along the upper reach of the Mill 
Brook Tributary during the 1 in 100 year and 1 in 1,000 year events.  
Modelling has also shown that floodwater may discharge over the right 
(eastern) bank of the main branch of the Mill Brook immediately upstream of 
the culvert beneath the Bedford to Bletchley Railway during the 1 in 1,000 
year event or as a result of a partial blockage of the culvert beneath the 
railway. 
12.1.2 However, it has been shown that the surface water drainage infrastructure 
brought forward as part of the LLRS offers adequate capacity to cater for such 
conditions.  It should also be noted that the locations at which floodwater may 
discharge from the watercourse and into the Pit are ‘remote’ from the 
Generating Equipment Site, and as such floodwater would not be expected to 
impact on sensitive power generation infrastructure. 
12.1.3 The principal residual flood risk issue in this instance relates to the 
operation/performance of the surface water drainage system.  As set out in 
Section 10, surface water run-off accumulating within the Rookery South 
attenuation pond is pumped to both Rookery North and the Mill Brook.  Should 
the pumping station fail, water levels within the attenuation pond would be 
greater than those anticipated under ‘normal’ operating conditions.  However, 
it has been shown (Table 10.2, Section 10 of this report) that the surface water 
drainage infrastructure brought forward as part of the LLRS offers adequate 
capacity to cater for a scenario where the pumping station is ‘off-line’ for up to 
three days, this providing sufficient time for ‘stand-by’ arrangements to be 
brought into effect. 
12.1.4 Notwithstanding the above, an incident management plan should be prepared 
so that visitors/operational staff are aware of the action to be taken in the 
event of floodwater/surface water affecting the Generating Equipment Site and 
associated highway access.

13 Concluding Remarks 
13.1.1 National, Regional and Local planning policy requires that: 
� 
Development is directed to sites at the lowest probability of flooding; 
� 
Development accommodates the potential impacts of climate change; 
� 
Development should not be permitted if it would be at unacceptable risk of 
flooding or create an unacceptable risk elsewhere; 
� 
Where possible, development should contribute to reduced flood risk; 
� 
New development should facilitate safe access and exit during flood 
conditions. 
13.1.2 Within this context, the Project is considered to fully comply with National, 
Regional and Local planning policy in respect of development and flood risk.  
On this basis, it is concluded that flood risk considerations do not constitute a 
barrier to the granting of a Development Consent Order (DCO) for the Project.

1.  
Background/Introduction 
 
SH explained that the purpose of the meeting was to: 
• 
provide the EA and IDB with an overview of the project; 
• 
set out and agree the design principles and parameters to 
be taken forward in respect of flood risk and surface water 
management; 
• 
agree the scope of the Flood Risk Assessment to support 
the DCO application. 
 
 
2.  
Roles/Responsibilities 
 
HB and TS confirmed the scope/extent of both the EAs and IDBs 
remit in the area. 
 
TS confirmed that the IDB was principally interested in the nature of 
the surface water pumping regime from Rookery Pit (to the Mill 
Brook watercourse bordering the western boundary of the Pit) and 
ensuring that any pumping continued in accordance with the terms 
of the existing consent to discharge (which permits pumping at a 
rate of 23l/s). 
 
It was noted that Central Beds Council, as LLFA, has a remit that 
extends to include surface water (as set out in the Flood and Water 
Management Act).  Given the current ‘transitional’ period regarding 
allocation of roles/responsibilities relating to flood risk management, 
HB confirmed that the EA would assess/review the FRA in its wider 
sense, considering flood risk associated with watercourses and 
surface water management. 
 
It was also noted that any works (permanent or temporary) to the 
watercourses bordering Rookery Pit would require consent.  
Consent applications are dealt with by the IDB on behalf of Central 
Beds Council. 
 
 
3.  
Site and Project Description 
 
SH provided a description of The Rookery (north and south - former 
clay pits) and an overview of the principal components of the project 
by reference to the information, figures, etc, included within the 
Preliminary Environmental Information Report (provided on the 
Millbrook Power website:  http://www.millbrookpower.co.uk/).

Hayley/Trevor, 
 
Please find attached a copy of the notes prepared following our meeting in respect of the above on 12th December 
2014. 
 
We would be grateful if you would confirm that the attached constitutes an accurate record of the points 
discussed/agreed, etc.  Should you consider that the notes require amending or wish to offer further comment 
regarding flood risk/water management matters, please feel free to call. 
 
Hayley – you will note that the penultimate paragraph under Item 6 (flood risk associated with the Mill Brook) 
refers to the hydraulic modelling analysis undertaken in 2010 and the fact that this assessment, submitted in 
support of the FRA, would have been reviewed/audited by the EA.  Consultation in respect of the Rookery South 
Resource Recovery Facility was dealt with under your reference   AC/2010/113063/02-L01    (IPC Application 
Reference EN01011) – we would be grateful if you would refer back to your records and confirm that the 2010 
modelling analysis was indeed reviewed and deemed ‘fit for purpose’, etc.

Hayley, 
 
Thanks for the confirmation. 
 
As discussed, PBA previously undertook a detailed assessment of the baseline environment from a flood risk 
perspective in 2010 in support of the Covanta energy from waste proposal.  We subsequently prepared the FRA in 
support of the DCO application for the Covanta facility (located within the north-west area of Rookery South 
Pit).  This included (i) hydraulic modelling to assess the nature of flood risk associated with the Mill Brook and its 
tributary and (ii) details of a surface water management strategy to serve development within the Pit.  You will note 
that Rookery Pit is subject to an ongoing Low Level Restoration Scheme (LLRS).  As these works are being 
implemented prior to construction of the Millbrook Power scheme, the LLRS therefore constitutes the ‘baseline’ for 
the purposes of EIA and preparation of the FRA (as per the Covanta scheme). 
 
The Covanta scheme was to be located in the north-west of Rookery South Pit, whereas the Millbrook Power 
scheme is located in the south-west of the Pit, so the flood risk/water management issues are fundamentally the 
same.  As far as we are aware, nothing has changed since 2010, so the 2010 technical assessment and associated 
design principles, parameters and flood risk mitigation works/strategy can be taken forward as the basis for the 
Millbrook scheme. 
 
See link below to the FRA prepared in support of the Covanta scheme – this should set the scene and provide 
adequate background ahead of our meeting on 12th Dec.

As below, the purpose of the meeting is to ‘re-cap’ on matters, ensure that any ‘new’ information is identified and 
ensure that we are all ‘on the same page’ in respect of the issues to be addressed and the scope of technical 
assessment required in respect of flood risk and wider water management matters.

Hayley Baldock at the EA is available on 12th and 15th Dec – are you available for either of these dates ? 
 
I think there would be some value in a ‘joint’ meeting (EA & IDB) if we can find mutually convenient 
dates.  Alternatively we’ll need to run with separate mtgs as we need to complete stakeholder consultation by the 
Xmas break. 
 
Thanks,

Hayley, 
 
Further to the e-mail below, I have spoken with Paul Henderson and understand that you now deal with flood risk 
matters associated with sites/proposals in the Bedford/Marston Vale area. 
 
You will note from the e-mail below that we are seeking to convene a joint meeting with both the EA and the 
Bedford Group of Drainage Boards to discuss the scope of FRA required in respect of the Millbrook Power project.  It 
would therefore be appreciated if you could confirm your availability to attend a meeting at the IDB’s Stewartby 
office during the weeks commencing 8th and 15th of December.  We understand that the Agency will levy a fee for 
pre-application advice and would be grateful if you could confirm fees for attendance at a meeting so that we may 
seek client approval in advance (we would anticipate a meeting of no more than 2hrs, plus your travel time). 
 
Trevor – apologies, we will need to cancel the meeting scheduled for this Thursday 4th Dec.  Could you confirm 
your availability for the weeks as above – thanks. 
 
Should you have any queries or wish to discuss, please feel free to call. 
 
Thanks and regards, 
 
Stuart.

Gents, 
 
PBA has been appointed to prepare the EIA in respect of the DCO application for the above.  As part of this work we 
are also preparing the Flood Risk Assessment, which will comprise an appendix to the relevant ES chapter. 
 
You may recall that PBA previously prepared the FRA in support of the DCO application for the Covanta Resource 
Recovery Facility (located within the north-west area of Rookery South Pit).  This included (i) hydraulic modelling to 
assess the nature of flood risk associated with the Mill Brook and its tributary and (ii) details of a surface water 
management strategy to serve development within the Pit.  You will note that Rookery Pit is subject to an ongoing 
Low Level Restoration Scheme (LLRS).  As these works are being implemented prior to construction of the Millbrook 
7
Power scheme, the LLRS therefore constitutes the ‘baseline’ for the purposes of EIA and preparation of the FRA (as 
per the Covanta scheme). 
 
We are progressing the technical work in accordance with the scope, design principles and parameters previously 
agreed with both the EA and IDB in respect of the Covanta scheme.  However, given the time that has elapsed since 
this work was undertaken (2010), it would seem appropriate to convene a joint meeting to ‘re-cap’ on matters, 
ensure that any ‘new’ information is identified and ensure that we are all ‘on the same page’ in respect of the issues 
to be addressed and the scope of technical assessment required in respect of flood risk and wider water 
management matters.  It would therefore be appreciated if you could confirm your availability to attend a meeting 
during the first two weeks of December (1st – 12th). 
 
Trevor/John – would it be possible to hold the meeting at your offices in Stewartby ? 
 
In terms of attendees, and in addition to yourselves, I would anticipate no more than x2 PBA staff and x1 
representative from the client team. 
 
 
Should you have any queries or wish to discuss, please feel free to call. 
 
 
Thanks and regards, 
 
Stuart.

electrical connection and gas connection were highlighted. 
 
SH explained that the project constitutes a Nationally Significant 
Infrastructure Project pursuant to the 2008 Planning Act and 
therefore requires development consent under that Act.  PBA has 
been appointed to prepare the Environmental Statement and 
associated Flood Risk Assessment in support of the application for 
a Development Consent Order (DCO). 
4.  
Low Level Restoration Scheme 
 
SH explained that The Rookery is the subject of a Low Level 
Restoration Scheme (LLRS) and that, once restored, Rookery 
South (the location of the Millbrook Power project), would be 
approximately 15m below the surrounding ground level. 
 
SH explained that the principal works associated with the LLRS 
comprise: 
 
• 
Re-profiling of the base of the pit to create a platform 
graded to fall to the north; 
• 
Implementation of a surface water drainage system, 
comprising a balancing pond, network of interceptor 
channels and pumping station; 
• 
Buttressing of the pit slopes; 
• 
Provision of access ramps; 
• 
Landscaping works/planting around the pit edge and 
balancing pond. 
 
It was noted and agreed that, as the LLRS is to be 
implemented/completed prior to any development within Rookery 
South Pit, the LLRS constitutes the ‘baseline’ for the purposes of 
the EIA and preparation of the FRA for the Millbrook Power project. 
 
 
5.  
Surface Water Management 
 
SH explained that the LLRS drainage scheme comprises/operates 
as follows: 
 
• 
Surface water collecting in the balancing pond will be 
pumped to (i) Rookery North at a rate of 100l/s and (ii) the 
Mill Brook at a rate of 23l/s (as per the terms of the existing 
Consent to Discharge); 
• 
The water level in Rookery North will be drawn down by 
approximately 1m; 
• 
Water from Rookery North will return to the balancing pond 
in Rookery South via a gravity connection at a rate of no 
more than 23l/s. 
• 
By using Rookery North as a strategic stormwater storage 
facility, the balancing pond would return to its normal water 
level approximately 12 days after the 1 in 100 year plus 
climate change event. 
 
SH explained that, in respect of design parameters, the base and 
side-slopes of Rookery South are assumed to be 100% 
impermeable and the sizing of the balancing pond has been 
undertaken using catchment-specific rainfall parameters derived 
from the Flood Estimation Handbook (FEH). 
 
 
 
 
MINUTES 
 
J:\31116 Rookery Pit Gas Power Station\Word\Meetings\141212 EA-IDB consultation mtg (flood risk).docx 
Page 3 of 4 
 
 
The balancing pond has been sized to accommodate rainfall events 
up to and including the 1 in 100 year event including climate change 
and comprises a retained water depth of 0.5m. 
 
As the LLRS design has been prepared assuming the Pit to be 
100% impermeable and the Millbrook Power project falls within the 
catchment of the Pit, it was agreed that the LLRS drainage strategy 
offers adequate capacity to accommodate surface water run-off 
from the Millbrook Power project, such that no additional mitigation 
would be required in respect of surface water run-off control. 
 
SH explained that design of the surface water strategy caters for 
residual risk scenarios comprising (i) the 1 in 100 year plus climate 
change event and a period of pumping station failure (pumps off-
line for 3 days) and (ii) a "follow-on" event - a 1 in 10 year plus 
climate change event occurring within 1 week of the 1 in 100 year 
plus climate change event.  The pond has been sized to provide 
sufficient residual capacity above that required for the 1 in 100 year 
plus climate change event to accommodate both residual risk 
scenarios. 
 
On this basis, it was agreed that the design of the drainage strategy 
is robust. 
 
In terms of details/commentary to be included within the FRA for the 
Millbrook Power project, HB agreed that a scope similar to that set 
out in the document prepared in support of the Covanta RRF 
scheme would be appropriate. 
 
6.  
Flood Risk Associated with Mill Brook 
 
SH explained that a HEC-RAS hydraulic model of the Mill Brook and 
its tributary (running along the southern fringe of Rookery South Pit) 
had been developed as part of PBA’s previous work (to inform 
design of the LLRS (2008) and the FRA for the Covanta RRF 
scheme (2010)).  The analysis had shown that floodwater would 
‘spill’ into Rookery South Pit from a localised area of the tributary, 
albeit at a relatively low rate (peak spill rate of approx. 0.2m3/s). 
 
SH explained that, as per the LLRS proposals, floodwater will be 
allowed to spill into the pit as per the “existing” situation, but will be 
“managed” by being intercepted and conveyed to the attenuation 
pond.  SH confirmed that the surface water drainage channels and 
attenuation pond being brought forward as part of the LLRS had 
been designed to accommodate floodwater influx from the Mill 
Brook tributary. 
 
In addition, it was noted that the ‘raised’ platform created by the 
LLRS works will be such that the site of the Millbrook Power project 
will be elevated above water levels within the balancing pond and 
associated drainage channels, etc. 
 
On this basis, it was agreed that the project site would be 
adequately safeguarded from flooding, such that no further 
mitigation works would be required as part of the project. 
 
In terms of the flood zone classification of the project site post 
implementation of the LLRS, it was noted that the 2010 assessment 
indicated that the raised platforms within Rookery South Pit would 
 
 
 
MINUTES 
 
J:\31116 Rookery Pit Gas Power Station\Word\Meetings\141212 EA-IDB consultation mtg (flood risk).docx 
Page 4 of 4 
 
 
be classified as Flood Zone 2.  It was agreed that the Millbrook 
Power project site could most likely be classified as Flood Zone 1 
(low probability of flooding) – the hydraulic model to be used to 
confirm. 
 
SH explained that consideration of the 1,000 year event in 2010 had 
shown that floodwater may spill over the eastern bank of the Mill 
Brook immediately upstream of the culvert beneath the railway (in 
the vicinity of the north-west corner of the Covanta RRF site).  
Given the distance from the Millbrook Power site, coupled with the 
topography across the base of the Pit following implementation of 
the LLRS, HB agreed that mitigation measures would not need to 
be brought forward as part of the Millbrook Power project.  (It was 
also noted that measures had been incorporated within the design 
of the Covanta RRF scheme to cater for this floodwater spill). 
 
The requirement to divert the lower reach of the Mill Brook tributary 
was noted and SH advised that the diverted reach had been 
designed to convey 100 year plus climate change flood flows ‘in 
bank’.  TS and HB confirmed this is an adequate design standard. 
 
TS confirmed that the IDB would deal with any consent applications 
for watercourse works on behalf of CBC. 
 
SH highlighted the fact that the hydraulic modelling analysis dates 
to 2010 and that the FEH method has evolved/been updated in the 
interim.  It was agreed that the 2010 hydrology/assessment of Mill 
Brook flood flows should be reviewed/validated.  HB agreed that, 
where the updated, 2014 analysis provides flow estimates that are 
less than or equal to the 2010 estimates, it would not be necessary 
to revisit the hydraulic modelling analysis (i.e. the 2010 modelling 
data/output could be taken forward and used to inform the FRA). 
 
It was noted that the hydraulic model files had been submitted to 
the EA as part of the 2010 Covanta RRF FRA and HB advised that 
the EA would ordinarily review/audit such work to ensure it is ‘fit for 
purpose’, etc.  HB agreed to check the EA’s records. 
 
HB advised that consideration should be given to provisions for 
maintenance of the flood risk/surface water management 
infrastructure – outline details of the options available should be set 
out in the FRA (the detail to be brought forward at a later date as 
part of conditions, etc). 
 
7.  
Summary 
 
It was agreed that little had changed in the time that has elapsed 
since PBA’s previous (2008 and 2010) assessments, such that this 
work and associated design principles/parameters, etc, could be 
taken forward as the basis for the Millbrook Power project. 
 
It was also agreed that, as the LLRS scheme and associated flood 
risk/surface water management strategy is essentially ‘fixed’ (and 
caters for the site of the Millbrook Power project) no additional flood 
risk related mitigation works will need to be brought forward as part 
of the Millbrook Power project.

1. INTRODUCTION 
 
Peter Brett Associates has been appointed by Millbrook Power Limited to prepare a Flood 
Risk Assessment (FRA) in support of an application for a Development Consent Order 
relating to the construction of a power generation plant.  The proposed plant is located in 
The Rookery, comprising two former clay pits (Rookery North and South).  The Mill Brook 
watercourse flows in a northerly direction along the western flank of Rookery South Pit and 
a tributary of the Brook, draining a catchment to the south of the Pit, joins the Mill Brook in 
the vicinity of the south-west corner of the Pit. 
 
Environment Agency floodplain maps do not extend to include the Mill Brook or its tributary 
on account of the small size of the contributing catchment areas.  The nature of flood risk 
associated with the Mill Brook and its tributary was originally assessed in 2008 in support of 
a planning application relating to the Review of Old Mineral Permissions (ROMP), which set 
out details of a Low Level Restoration Scheme for the Rookery Pits.  Flood risk was 
assessed by developing a HEC-RAS hydraulic model using topographic survey of Rookery 
South Pit and the watercourse corridor.  This study was subsequently refined and updated 
in 2010 in support of proposals for development within the north-west area of Rookery 
South Pit and following further, more detailed survey of the watercourse corridor. 
 
Following consultation with the EA and Bedford Group of Drainage Boards in December 
2014, it was agreed that the 2010 study provides the best available data in respect of flood 
risk associated with the Mill Brook and its tributary, such that it should be taken forward and 
used to inform the FRA prepared in support of the Millbrook Power Project.  However, it was 
noted that in the time that has elapsed since the 2010 study was concluded, the Flood 
Estimation Handbook (FEH) methodology and associated database (used to estimate flood 
flows for the purposes of hydraulic modelling) has been revised/updated.  It was therefore 
agreed that the 2010 assessment of flood flows should be reviewed/validated. 
 
This Technical Note sets out a summary of (i) the revised and updated FEH analysis and (ii) 
the scope of hydraulic modelling analysis undertaken as part of the 2010 study. 
 
2. HYDROLOGY 
 
A hydrological and hydraulic modelling assessment of the Mill Brook and its tributary was 
carried out in 2010.    Flood flows were estimated using the ReFH methodology and the 
appraisal found that the contributing catchment extended to include an additional area 
outside the FEH catchment boundary.  Both the catchment area and URBEXT descriptors 
were therefore amended accordingly.

Item 
Subject 
 
Both the EA and IDB have been consulted and have confirmed that there have been no 
changes within the catchment that would impact upon the hydrological analysis.  However, 
as noted above, the FEH methodology and associated database has been revised/updated 
in the time that has elapsed since the 2010 study.  Catchment hydrology has therefore been 
re-assessed to establish whether the flood flows estimated in 2010 may be taken forward 
and used to inform the FRA prepared in support of the Millbrook Power Project.   
 
Flood estimation has been based upon the Flood Estimation Handbook Statistical (FEH)

Flows have been estimated at the downstream extent of the reach of watercourse 
represented in the hydraulic model - at the culvert beneath the Bedford to Bletchley/Marston 
Vale railway line, as per the 2010 assessment (see Figure 1).  The FEH catchment was 
derived at grid reference 501085, 241335 using FEH CD-ROM version 3.  The total 
catchment area as defined by FEH is 3.49km2 (red outline shown in Figure 2) and the 
tributary catchment is 1.49km2 (green outline shown in Figure 2).

The FEH catchments were reviewed against 1:25,000 scale OS mapping, historical 
mapping and based upon site observations.  This identified two areas that fall outside the 
FEH catchment boundary and which should therefore be removed from the catchment area 
(shown as blue hatched areas on Figure 3).  These include: 
 
• 
Area to the east of the Midland Mainline railway (0.44km2) 
• 
Area within the southern part of Rookery South Pit (0.32km2)  
 
In addition, the FEH defined catchment does not include several areas which were found to 
fall within the contributing catchment of the Mill Brook (i.e. such that the catchment should 
be modified to include these areas): 
 
• 
Additional area associated with the Millbrook Vehicle Proving Ground (highlighted in 
pink in Figure 3 and totalling an area of 0.85km2) 
• 
Area located to the north of the Proving Ground and east of the Bedford to 
Bletchley/Marston Vale railway (highlighted in pink hatching and totalling an area of 
0.18km2) 
• 
Area immediately to the south of the proving ground (highlighted in pink hatching 
and totalling an area of 0.24km2) 
 
Figure 3 below shows the revised catchment area in bold red and also includes the proving 
ground highlighted in pink.  The original FEH catchments can be seen in the background.  
The revised total catchment area of the Mill Brook is 3.81km2 (revised FEH total catchment 
of 2.96km2 plus the 0.85km2 Proving Ground area) and the revised tributary catchment is 
0.86km2.  The 2010 assessment used a catchment area of 4.49km2 for the Mill Brook and 
1.49km2 for the tributary catchment.

Figure 3 – Revised catchment areas 
 
The 2010 assessment included a detailed assessment of the urban/suburban areas within 
the FEH catchment and proving ground area.  Ordnance Survey mapping was used to 
determine that approximately 2% of the proving ground area was urban and 2% was 
suburban (in accordance with FEH definitions).  Of the FEH catchment, approximately 0.8% 
of the catchment was deemed to be urban and approximately 1% of the catchment was 
deemed to be suburban. 
 
Using equation 6.2 from FEH Volume 5 (URBEXT = URBEXT + 0.5SUBURBEXT) the 
URBEXT value for the Proving Ground was estimated to be 0.03 and for the FEH 
catchment was 0.013.

There has been no change in the urban extent since the 2010 assessment (as confirmed by 
a review of up to date aerial imagery and mapping) and therefore there was no need to 
update these URBEXT values. 
 
In order to determine the updated URBEXT value for the updated total catchment at the 
downstream extent of the modelled reach, area weighting (as per the methodology outlined 
in Section 7.2.2 of FEH Volume 5) was used to combine the FEH catchment and Proving 
Ground URBEXT values based on the parameters shown in Table 1.

Using the methodology outlined in FEH Volume 5, the updated URBEXT value for the total 
catchment was estimated to be 0.0167. 
 
The other catchment descriptors (apart from DPLBAR) are not area dependent and 
therefore the revised catchment area would not result in any significant changes to the FEH 
descriptors.  The DPLBAR value based on the revised catchment area of 3.81km2 would 
decrease slightly and therefore the original FEH value was used. 
 
The key catchment descriptors are shown in Table 2 (with revised AREA and URBEXT 
values).  The SPRHOST and BFIHOST values indicate that the catchment is not 
permeable.

ReFH Flow Estimation 
The ReFH method can be used to provide peak flows and also hydrographs.  Parameters in 
the ReFH model are derived from catchment descriptors. 
 
Hydrographs were derived at the downstream extent of the reach of watercourse 
represented in the hydraulic model - at the culvert beneath the Bedford to Bletchley/Marston 
Vale railway line, as per the 2010 assessment, using an ISIS ReFH Boundary Unit.  Several 
storm durations have been considered for the 1% annual probability (1 in 100 year) event to 
identify the critical storm duration.  For this analysis, the 9 hour storm is shown to produce 
the highest peak flow using a time-step of 1 hour. 
 
Table 3 provides a summary of the peak flows estimated using the ReFH method.  The 
hydrograph outputs from ISIS are included in Appendix A.

FEH Statistical Estimation 
QMED Estimation 
QMED was calculated using the updated QMED equation for rural catchments based on 
standard FEH relationships, as follows: 
 
 
This yields QMED cds ss rural (the as rural QMED estimate for the total rural catchment based 
upon FEH catchment descriptors).  The calculated QMED cds ss rural for the downstream 
extent of the Mill Brook is 0.66m3/s.  The URBEXT2000 value is below the threshold at which 
FEH recommends an urban adjustment is made (URBEXT2000>0.03) and therefore no urban 
adjustment was applied to the QMED. 
 
The FEH highlights that the validity of the QMED value estimated simply from catchment 
descriptors can be improved by using a data transfer procedure.  EA Guidance on 
Improvements to the Flood Estimation Handbook statistical method, published in July 2008, 
identifies the need to find a single donor site to adjust the QMED estimate that is both 
hydrologically similar and geographically close.  In this instance no suitable donor stations 
were found that are hydrologically similar and geographically close (within 30km) and 
therefore a donor adjustment was not made to the QMED estimate. 
 
Derivation of Pooled Growth Curve 
 
WINFAP-FEH Version 3 and HiFlows data version 3.3.2 were used in this hydrological 
analysis.  WINFAP-FEH was used to identify hydrologically similar gauged sites, define a 
pooling group at the downstream extent of the reach and derive a flood frequency curve for 
the reach.  The initial pooling group was defined with a target of 700 station years of data 
(on account of the likelihood that a number of catchment gauging station records may need 
to be removed during the pooling group review process).  The default pooling group is 
shown in Appendix A. 
 
The pooling group was created using two HiFlows datasets: 
 
 (i)        “Sites suitable for QMED adjustment”  
 (ii)       “Sites suitable for Pooling only”

Derivation of Flood Frequency Curve 
 
The flood frequency curve provides estimates of design flood flows for a range of flood 
return periods and is derived by factoring up the estimate of QMED using the pooled growth 
curve fittings. 
 
In this instance, the default pooling group was used as a comparison to ReFH flows.   
 
In this instance the URBEXT2000 value is less than 0.03 and therefore an urban adjustment 
was not applied to the flood frequency curve.  The 1 in 1000 year flow was obtained from 
WINFAP by selecting further return periods before calculating the growth factors.  The 
resulting flood frequency curve is presented below in Table 4 along with the ReFH flow 
estimates.

Table 4 – Default Flood Frequency Curve for downstream extent of Mill Brook 
 
As the ReFH peak flows were greater than the default pooling group flows no further 
modifications to the pooling group were made and no further FEH Statistical assessment 
was completed.  In accordance with the latest EA Flood Estimation Guidelines (2015) ReFH 
is generally preferred for smaller catchments as uncertainties exist in pooling via WINFAP 
for normal (i.e. non permeable, non-urban) small catchments.

Table 5 – Comparison of ReFH peak flows (2010 and 2014 assessments) 
 
It can be seen that the flood flow estimates based upon the current (2014/2015) 
methodology and parameters are lower than those derived in 2010.   
The flow estimates summarised in Table 5 above relate to the total contributing catchment 
area taken at the culvert beneath the Bedford to Bletchley railway (i.e. comprising flows 
within the Mill Brook AND its tributary).  For the purposes of the hydraulic modelling, inflows 
are derived by areal weighting of the ‘lumped’ flow estimates.  A summary of the inflows 
derived by areal weighting for both the 2010 and 2014 assessments is presented in 
Appendix A.  It can be seen that the 2014 estimates of the tributary inflows are significantly 
lower than the 2010 estimates.  The 2014 estimates of the Mill Brook inflows are lower/the 
same as the 2010 estimates, with the exception of the 1,000 year inflow, for which the 2014 
estimate is marginally (0.07m3/s) higher.  However, this is not considered significant when

viewed in the context of confidence limits/the margin of error associated with flood flow 
estimation and hydraulic modelling. 
It is therefore concluded that the 2010 modelling study provides a ‘precautionary’ basis for 
preparing the FRA in support of the Millbrook Power Project. 
4. HYDRAULIC MODELLING 
The 2010 hydraulic assessment was undertaken using the HEC-RAS modelling software 
(Version 4.0.0) and using an ‘unsteady’ modelling approach on account of the fact that 
issues relating to floodwater storage and ‘discharge/spill’ from the watercourse system 
needed to be considered. 
The objective of the modelling was to derive a series of design flood levels and establish 
whether Rookery South Pit would be at risk of inundation as a result of flooding on the Mill 
Brook and its tributary during the 1 in 100 year and 1 in 100 year plus climate change flood 
events. 
Schematisation 
A model schematic plan is presented in Appendix B (Drawing No. 31116/3014/003) and 
shows model extents and the locations of cross-sections and hydraulic structures. 
The Mill Brook and its tributary both consist of a single channel which is represented as a 
series of river and structure cross-sections based upon topographic survey undertaken in 
2009. 
The lower reach of the Mill Brook tributary is to be diverted as part of the LLRS.  The 
diverted reach will consist of a trapezoidal channel profile with a base width of 2m, depth of 
1.5m and top width of 6m.  The diversion works will be implemented prior to construction of 
the Millbrook Power Project and details of the proposed channel configuration were 
therefore included in the HEC-RAS model. 
There are nine structures within the study area (as shown on Drawing No. 
31116/3014/003, Appendix B).  These structures are modelled as culverts, with the 
exception of Structure S2a, which is represented using a deck/roadway component within 
the model. 
Seven lateral structures (representing floodwater ‘discharge/spill’ from the watercourses) 
are included in the model (as shown on Drawing No. 31116/3014/003, Appendix B). 
The Mill Brook outfalls to Stewartby Lake approximately 400m downstream of the culvert 
beneath the Bedford to Bletchley/Marston Vale railway.  The Bedfordshire and River Ivel 
Internal Drainage Board provided peak water level data for Stewartby Lake associated with 
historic flood events.  However, the highest recorded water level within Stewartby Lake 
(35.71aOD) does not extend to influence the modelled reach of watercourse.  The 
downstream boundary of the hydraulic model is therefore based upon ‘normal depth’, 
calculated using the topographic survey. 
5. RESULTS 
The model provides a design series of flood levels for the 1 in 100 year and 1 in 100 year 
plus climate change events.  The modelling analysis indicates that floodwater may 
discharge into Rookery South Pit during the 1 in 100 year event. This discharge occurs in a 
very localised area along the upper reach of the Mill Brook tributary at a peak rate of 
approximately 0.2m3/s, giving rise to a volume of approximately 6,500m3. Floodwater 
discharge does not occur along the main branch of the Mill Brook – the minimum freeboard 
between the 100 year flood level and the discharge threshold being approximately 250-
300mm along the reach immediately upstream of the culvert beneath the Bedford to 
Bletchley/Marston Vale railway.

Subject 
During the 1 in 100 year plus climate change flood event, the model indicates that discharge 
from the upper reach of the Mill Brook tributary increases marginally, resulting in a 
discharge volume of approximately 7,500m3. Floodwater discharge does not occur along 
the main branch of the Mill Brook – the minimum freeboard between the 100 year plus 
climate change flood level and the discharge threshold being approximately 150-200mm 
along the reach immediately upstream of the Bedford to Bletchley/Marston Vale railway. 
A CD containing the model files is included in Appendix B. 
6. SENSITIVITY ANALYSIS 
Sensitivity analysis was undertaken to quantify the sensitivity of model results to (i) 
assumptions regarding model parameters and (ii) more extreme conditions than those 
considered above. 
The results associated with sensitivity testing for (i) Mannings ‘n’ plus 20% and (ii) partial 
blockage of the culvert beneath the Bedford to Bletchley/Marston Vale railway are 
summarised below. 
Mannings ‘n’ +20% 
Modelling analysis has shown that water levels may increase by up to approximately 
100mm as a result of a 20% increase in Mannings ‘n’.  This results in a marginal increase in 
the peak rate of floodwater discharge into Rookery South Pit from the upper reach of the 
Mill Brook tributary, such that the discharge volume increases by approximately 2,500m3 for 
the 100 year event. 
Structure Blockage 
The culvert beneath the Bedford to Bletchley/Marston Vale railway constitutes a constriction 
to river flows.  The potential impact of culvert blockage upon flood levels was simulated by 
blocking 50% of the opening area of the culvert.  This test indicated that the water level 
immediately upstream of the culvert would increase by approximately 0.6m, thereby giving 
rise to floodwater ‘spill’ over the eastern bank of the Mill Brook.  This increases the volume 
of floodwater discharge into Rookery South Pit by approximately 13,000m3 when compared 
to the 100 year scenario without culvert blockage.
