INTRODUCTION 
1.1 
Overview 
1.1.1 
This document is the Preliminary Environmental Information Report 
(PEIR) for the Hirwaun Power Project. It has been prepared by Parsons 
Brinckerhoff on behalf of Hirwaun Power Limited (HPL).  
1.1.2 
HPL is promoting a new thermal generating station (hereafter referred 
to as the Power Generation Plant) on land at the Hirwaun Industrial 
Estate, in Aberdare, South Wales (approximate grid reference SN 938 
061). The Project Site location is shown in Figure 1.1.  
1.1.3 
The Power Generation Plant will operate as a Simple Cycle Gas 
Turbine (SCGT) peaking plant and will be designed to provide an 
electrical output of up to 299 Megawatts electrical (MWe). The plant will 
be fuelled by natural gas, supplied to the Power Generation Plant Site 
by a new gas pipeline connecting the Power Generation Plant to the 
existing National Gas Transmission system (NTS).   
1.1.4 
Peaking plants are required to operate when there is a surge in 
demand for electricity associated with a particular event (e.g. where 
many people across the country boil kettles following the end of a 
popular television programme) or where there is a sudden drop in 
power being generated from plant which are constantly operational 
(e.g. a sudden outage). 
1.1.5 
Operating as a peaking plant, the proposed Power Generation Plant 
will also help to ‘balance out’ the grid at times of peak electricity 
demand and will help to support the grid at times when other 
technologies (e.g. wind and solar farms) cannot generate electricity due 
to their intermittent operation and reliance on weather conditions.  
Peaking plant are therefore vital in ‘evening out’ the power in the grid. 
The Power Generation Plant would operate for up to 1500 hours per 
year (as per the definition of a peaking plant defined by DECC).  
1.1.6 
The Project constitutes a Nationally Significant Infrastructure Project 
(NSIP) under the terms of the Planning Act 2008 (PA 2008) and 
therefore an application for a development consent order (DCO) is 
proposed to be made to the Secretary of State (SoS) (the proposed 
DCO Application).   
1.1.7 
The three main elements of the Project comprise:  
� 
A new Power Generation Plant, a SCGT gas fired ‘peaking’ power 
generating station capable of providing up to 299 MWe;

� 
A new electrical connection either by underground cable or 
overhead line (referred to as the ‘Electrical Connection’) to export 
electricity from the Power Generation Plant into the National Grid; 
Rhigos Substation and  
� 
A new underground gas pipeline connection (referred to as the 
‘Gas Connection’) to bring natural gas to the Power Generation 
Plant from the existing high pressure gas network NTS in the 
vicinity of the Project Site.   
1.1.8 
The proposed Power Generation Plant, Gas Connection and Electrical 
Connection together with all access requirements are referred to as the 
Project and are all integral to the generation of electricity and the 
subsequent export of that electricity to the National Grid. The proposed 
DCO Application includes the whole of the Project. 
1.2 
Structure of the PEIR 
1.2.1 
This PEIR has been prepared in distinct sections to allow the reader to 
fully understand the Project, the purpose of the document, the 
regulatory framework in which it has been prepared, and the proposed 
methodology for undertaking the Environmental Impact Assessment 
(EIA).  
1.2.2 
The PEIR is set out as follows:  
� 
Section 1 Comprises a description of the developer, a brief 
description of the Project, an introduction to the consenting regime, 
the need for and benefits of the Project, and the consultation 
strategy;  
� 
Section 2 Provides a brief description of the planning policy 
background and regulatory framework in which the PEIR has been 
prepared;  
� 
Section 3 Provides a description of the Project Site and 
surrounding area, and includes a more detailed description of the 
Power 
Generation 
Plant, 
Gas 
Connection 
and 
Electrical 
Connection, together with all access requirements;   
� 
Section 4 Provides a description of the Methodology employed in 
undertaking the EIA for the Project; 
� 
Section 5 Provides a description of alternatives which have been 
considered; and  
� 
Sections 6 to 16 then provide a description of the environmental 
assessment information which has been gathered to date under 
specific environmental topics, as well as details of the next steps 
required to complete the EIA process.

1.3 
Application for an Order Granting Development Consent 
1.3.1 
As the generation capacity of the Power Generation Plant will exceed 
50MWe it is classed as an NSIP and therefore Development Consent is 
required under the PA 2008.   
1.3.2 
Development Consent for a NSIP may only be granted by a DCO 
through an application under Section 37 of the PA 2008 to the 
Secretary of State (SoS).  Section 37 of the PA 2008 also governs the 
content of an application for a DCO, including the requirements for the 
necessary accompanying documents.  These requirements are 
specified in the Infrastructure Planning (Applications: Prescribed Forms 
and Procedure) Regulations 2009 (“APFP Regulations”).  
1.3.3 
The Infrastructure Planning (Environmental Impact Assessment) 
Regulations 2009 (the EIA Regulations) require an EIA to be carried 
out in respect of development that is classed as EIA development.  All 
development in Schedule 1 to the EIA Regulations (“Schedule 1 
development”) requires EIA.  Development in Schedule 2 to the EIA 
Regulations (“Schedule 2 development”) requires EIA if it is likely to 
have significant effects on the environment.  
1.3.4 
The definition of a Schedule 1 development includes thermal 
generating stations with a heat output of 300 MWth or more (Schedule 
1 paragraph 2(a)). 
1.3.5 
The thermal output of the Power Generation Plant will be greater than 
300MWth and therefore an EIA will be required under the EIA 
regulations
1.  
1.3.6 
Section 5(2)(a) of the APFP Regulations, requires that any 
Environmental Statement (ES) required pursuant to the EIA 
Regulations, together with any scoping or screening opinions or 
directions, must accompany the DCO Application. 
1.4 
Need for and Benefits of the Project  
1.4.1 
This section briefly summarises why the Project is needed and how it 
would contribute towards ensuring greater reliability of electricity supply 
in the UK. A fuller needs case will be presented within the DCO 
Application. 
                                                   
1 Thermal output is commonly defined as the amount of ‘useable heat’ which is produced as part of the process 
of the combustion of fuel.  Only a part of this useable heat can be converted to electrical energy, which is why 
this is a larger value than electrical output.

1.4.2 
Under Section 31 of the PA 2008 a DCO is required to authorise an 
NSIP.  In England and Wales, an onshore electricity generating station 
is considered to be a NSIP if the generating capacity is greater than 
50 MWE.  As the generation capacity of the Power Generation Plant 
will exceed this threshold, development consent is required. When 
determining the DCO Application the SoS must have regard to, inter 
alia, any relevant National Policy Statements (NPSs) designated in 
respect of that type of infrastructure. Further explanation of the 
decision-making process under the PA 2008 is set out in Section 2.3 of 
this PEIR. 
1.4.3 
The overarching NPS for Energy is NPS EN-1 which is one of the 
relevant NPSs for this Project, alongside EN-2, EN-3 and EN-5. (See 
Section 2). EN-1 sets out national policy for energy infrastructure and 
explains the need for such infrastructure. 
1.4.4 
NPS EN-1 re-affirms the transitional role of new gas generation, 
confirms that a diverse energy mix is required and that there is a 
significant need for new energy generation infrastructure to replace 
capacity that will be lost through the closure of existing large coal plant. 
Indeed it states that the decision-maker ‘should start with a 
presumption in favour of granting consent to applications for energy 
NSIPs’ (paragraph 4.1.2).   
1.4.5 
NPS EN-1 therefore establishes the general need case for energy 
NSIPs, including gas generation.  This has been preceded and followed 
by other government policy and evidence, some of which is 
summarised below to provide further context.  
1.4.6 
Paragraph 3.6.1 of NPS EN-1 confirms that gas generation will play an 
important role in the UK's energy mix, "Fossil fuel power stations play a 
vital role in providing reliable electricity supplies: they can be operated 
flexibly in response to changes in supply and demand, and provide 
diversity in our energy mix.  They will continue to play an important role 
in our energy mix as the UK makes the transition to a low carbon 
economy..."  
1.4.7 
Section 3.7 of NPS EN-1 sets out the need case for new electricity 
network infrastructure.  
1.4.8 
Paragraph 3.7.10 states that “..........there is an urgent need for new 
electricity transmission and distribution infrastructure (and in particular 
for new lines of 132 kV and above) to be provided. The [SoS] should 
consider that the need for any given proposed new connection or 
reinforcement has been demonstrated if it represents an efficient and 
economical means of connecting a new generating station to the 
transmission or distribution network, or reinforcing the network to

ensure that it is sufficiently resilient and has sufficient capacity (in the 
light of any performance standards set by Ofgem) to supply current or 
anticipated future levels of demand” (Paragraph 3.7.10). 
1.4.9 
To ensure that there is reliability of supply, it is government policy that 
the electricity generation mix needs to incorporate a balance of 
technologies that continuously and reliably produce stable and 
controllable power and that within this scenario, gas-fuelled electricity 
generating technologies can play a significant role.  Thus in the second 
Annual Energy Statement (AES) (November, 2011), the Department of 
Energy and Climate Change (DECC) directed the need to build new 
power generation infrastructure.  In line with this requirement, DECC 
acknowledged the need for gas to continue to feature strongly in the 
energy mix, and also stated that while it is important that businesses 
play their part in the transition to a low-carbon economy, it is also 
important to remain competitive. 
1.4.10 
These statements are supported by the more recent Gas Generation 
Strategy, released by DECC in December 2012
2.  The Strategy sets 
out the important role that gas generation—as a reliable, flexible source 
of electricity—will play in any future generation mix, supporting a 
secure, low-carbon and affordable electricity system.  It states that 
“Gas currently forms an integral part of the UK’s generation mix and is 
a reliable, flexible source of electricity.  Using gas as a fuel in our power 
stations currently provides a significant proportion of our electricity 
generation (around 40% in 2011)”.  
1.4.11 
Moreover, it suggests that there could be as much as 26 gigawatts 
(GW) 
of 
new 
gas 
generation 
infrastructure 
required 
if 
the 
decarbonisation target is set at 200g/CO2/kWh. It also indicates that in 
2030 we could need more overall gas capacity than we have today, 
although operating at lower load factors. The modelling shows that gas 
could play a more extensive role, with higher load factors, should the 
4th Carbon Budget be revised upwards” (Executive Summary).  
1.4.12 
The strategy also presents scenarios which indicate that up to 41 GW 
of new gas generation capacity will be needed by 2030 to underpin 
long term electricity supplies and provide back-up to nuclear and wind 
generation at times of peak demand. 
1.4.13 
In October 2012, Ofgem (the electricity and gas regulatory body) 
prepared a report entitled ‘Electricity Capacity Assessment’ which was 
submitted to the SoS and estimates a set of plausible electricity

capacity margins that could be delivered by the market over the next 
four years and the associated risks to security of supply. 
1.4.14 
One of the key findings of the Ofgem report is that electricity supply will 
decrease significantly from the current historically high levels. This is 
primarily because of a significant reduction in electricity supplies from 
coal and oil plants, which are due to close under European 
environmental legislation. An updated Electricity Capacity Assessment 
report issued by Ofgem in June 2013 has indicted that the risks to 
electricity security of supply over the next six winters have increased 
since the report in October 2012. 
1.4.15 
Furthermore, the Welsh Government (WG) publication, ‘Energy Wales 
– a Low Carbon Transition’ states that  
“Gas will be a key transitional fuel because greenhouse gas emissions 
from gas are significantly less than coal subject to the method of 
extraction.  Gas is a flexible, responsive and reliable source of energy 
which can play a key role in the transition to a genuinely low carbon 
energy system”.  
1.4.16 
In the short term, gas, nuclear and bio-energy will provide the energy to 
compensate for the intermittency in supply from renewable resources” 
(Page 10 of the Low Carbon Transition Statement). 
1.4.17 
With the large number of wind turbines that are now providing electricity 
to the National Grid and the many proposals for further wind turbines 
onshore and offshore, coupled with proposed solar farm developments 
including in South Wales, significant consideration is being given to the 
need for flexible / peaking power on the network.  Parsons 
Brinckerhoff’s “Powering the Future” report3 which maps the route to a 
low carbon economy, has predicted that up to 9,000 MW of flexible 
power would be needed by 2050 to help stabilise the National Grid due 
to the increased level of intermittent supply. 
1.4.18 
At present, thermal peaking capacity in the UK is relatively small due to 
the nature of the electricity generation mix on the Grid. Although 
recently there has been a significant increase in the number of 
proposals for flexible / peaking plant in the UK, a large proportion of 
these are focussed on small capacity (c 20MWe) liquid fuel fired plants.  
1.4.19 
Given the above, there is therefore a clear and significant requirement 
for further capacity to meet the projected need for reactive/flexible

generation.  A dedicated gas fired peaking plant at the Power 
Generation Plant Site could allow for the rapid provision of reserve 
capacity to the National Grid, thus playing a role in meeting the energy 
requirements of the UK going forward.  
1.5 
The Developer 
1.5.1 
The Developer of the proposed Project is HPL.  
1.5.2 
HPL is the Special Purpose Vehicle (SPV) which has been set up to 
develop the Project and has been established by Watt Power Limited. 
(WPL). WPL has been established to develop flexible gas fired 
generation assets to support the UK Government drive to a low carbon 
economy.  WPL is resourced through Stag Energy, a company founded 
in 2002.  The company draws on a depth of experience with a team 
that has created and delivered over 10,000 MW of power generation 
and related infrastructure projects across the globe, of which 2,500 MW 
was delivered in the UK.   
1.5.3 
Similarly, Stag Energy provides resources to WPL. Stag Energy has 
recently also provided resources to the Gateway Storage Company Ltd, 
which is developing an offshore salt cavern gas storage facility in the 
East Irish Sea.  The project has been consented by the UK 
Government and the local planning authority (Barrow-in-Furness, 
Cumbria) 
(for

1.5.4 
WPL and HPL are committed to the development of assets to support 
the UK Government drive to a low carbon economy.  WPL and HPL 
recognise the need to balance commercial benefits with the 
environmental issues and concerns of energy projects and believe this 
can be responsibly delivered at a local level. 
1.5.5 
HPL is also committed to acting in a socially and environmentally 
responsible manner.  As part of this policy, HPL will seek the views and 
concerns of the local community and have regard to them in preparing 
the proposed DCO Application. 
The Project and 
supporting 
infrastructure will be designed and developed to high quality, safety and 
environmental standards.

1.6.1 
As explained in Section 1.3, the Project is an EIA development under 
the EIA Regulations.  As a result HPL is carrying out an EIA of the 
Project.  Under Regulation 10(b) of the EIA Regulations HPL must 
consult on preliminary environmental information relating to the Project.  
That information has been compiled into this document, which is a 
PEIR.  The PEIR represents the environmental information and 
assessments which have been completed to date.  
The Consultation Process 
1.6.2 
This PEIR has been compiled to enable HPL to consult upon the 
proposed DCO Application in advance of submitting an application by 
providing up-to-date information about the Project. This pre-application 
consultation is a requirement under section 47 of the PA 2008. This 
PEIR has been published in the manner described in HPL’s Statement 
of Community Consultation (SoCC), which explains how HPL proposes 
to consult those living in the vicinity about the proposed Project.  The 
SoCC explains how feedback can be given about the proposed Project 
and the content of this PEIR.  
1.6.3 
This PEIR is intended to provide an assessment, on a preliminary 
basis, of the likely significant environmental effects of the Project. The 
proposed DCO Application is still being developed and refined. In 
particular, decisions are still to be made on the two route corridor 
options for the Gas Connection and Electrical Connection, as well as 
the layout of the plant within the Power Generation Plant Site. These 
options are described in more detail in Section 4. Feedback received 
during the consultation process will help inform the development of the 
proposed Project and the decisions on it still to be made. 
Environmental Impact Assessment 
1.6.4 
The preliminary environmental information presented in this PEIR will 
be developed further in light of the consultation responses received and 
the methodologies proposed herein as part of the EIA process.  The 
results of the EIA will ultimately be presented in an ES that will 
accompany the proposed DCO Application.  
1.6.5 
Before starting the EIA, HPL requested a Scoping Opinion from the 
SoS.  This request was made on the 31st May 2013, and was 
supported by a Scoping Report entitled ‘Hirwaun Power Project 
Environmental Impact Assessment Scoping Report’.  This Scoping 
Report is available at the Planning Inspectorates website and HPL’s 
website. It describes the key anticipated environmental issues that 
would require detailed evaluation as part of the EIA process and the 
methodologies proposed to assess these impacts. Rhondda Cynon Taf

bodies were consulted by PINS on the Scoping Opinion and 
responded. 
1.6.6 
A Scoping Opinion was subsequently issued by the SoS and this is 
also available on the Planning Inspectorates website. . The EIA 
process and this PEIR take the Scoping Opinion and the consultation 
responses provided by the SoS into account.

REGULATORY AND POLICY BACKGROUND 
2.1 
Introduction 
2.1.1 
This section of the PEIR outlines the main regulatory and policy 
framework that is relevant to the proposed Project.   
2.1.2 
Relevant EU directives are considered first, at a high level.  
2.1.3 
This section also gives an overview of the current and emerging 
policies relevant to the Project at the national, regional and local levels 
as they relate to the consideration of the likely scope of EIA.  
2.1.4 
Further description of the planning policy background and its relevance 
to the Project will be provided in the Planning Statement, which will be 
produced as a separate document to support the proposed DCO 
Application.  A summary of relevant and important planning policy will 
also be presented more fully within the ES.  
2.2 
European Union (EU) 
2.2.1 
Current EU directives of particular relevance to the Project with respect 
to environmental requirements are as follows: 
Directive 2011/92/EU on the assessment of the effects of certain public 
and private projects on the environment (the EIA Directive) 
2.2.2 
The EIA Directive ensures that plans, programmes and projects likely 
to have significant effects on the environment are made subject to an 
environmental assessment, prior to their approval or authorisation.  The 
Directive sets the thresholds for projects that require an EIA (as stated 
in Section 1.3) and also outlines the impacts on the environment to be 
assessed in the EIA process. This Directive is implemented in the 
respect of NSIPs in the UK by the EIA Regulations. 
Directive 2003/35/EC of 26 May 2003 (the Public Participation 
Directive) 
2.2.3 
The Public Participation Directive implements the obligations arising 
from the Århus Convention and amends the EIA Directive and the 
Integrated Pollution Prevention and Control (IPPC) Directive (see 2.2.4 
below) to improve public participation. 
Directive 2010/75/EU of 24 November 2010 on industrial emissions 
(integrated pollution prevention and control) (the Industrial Emissions 
Directive (IED))

2.2.4 
In December 2010 the EU adopted a Proposal for a Directive on 
industrial emissions (IED).  The IED recasts seven existing directives 
related to industrial emissions, in particular Directive 2008/1/EC of 15 
January 2008 concerning integrated pollution prevention and control 
(the IPPC Directive) and Directive 2001/80/EC of 23 October 2001 on 
the limitation of emissions of certain pollutants into the air from large 
combustion plants (the Large Combustion Plant Directive (LCPD)), into 
a single legislative instrument to improve the permitting, compliance 
and enforcement regimes adopted by Member States.  However, the 
general principles of the IPPC Directive and the LCPD Directive 
described below are retained and will remain relevant to the Project.  
2.2.5 
The purpose of the IPPC Directive was to achieve integrated 
prevention and control of pollution arising from certain potentially 
polluting processes and to ensure a high level of protection for the 
environment taken as a whole.  Measures were laid down to prevent or, 
where that is not practicable, to reduce emissions in the air, water and 
land with the introduction of emission limit values (ELV) and best 
available techniques (BAT).  With regard to power projects, combustion 
installations with a rated thermal input exceeding 50 MW are subject to 
the IPPC Directive.  The IPPC Directive is transposed into UK 
legislation via the Environmental Permitting (England and Wales) 
Regulations 2010 (as amended) and the IED is to be transposed 
through amendments to the Environmental Permitting (England and 
Wales) Regulations 2010.  An Environmental Permit will be required for 
the operation of the Power Generation Plant. 
2.2.6 
The purpose of the LCPD was to limit the emissions of certain 
pollutants into the atmosphere from large combustion processes.  The 
LCPD applied to combustion plants with a rated thermal input equal to 
or greater than 50 MW.  The emissions of nitrogen oxides (NOx), 
sulphur dioxide (SO2) and particulates were subject to the stringent 
ELVs stipulated in the LCPD.  The LCPD requirements for new plant 
are implemented in the UK regulations by the Environmental Permitting 
(England and Wales) Regulations 2010. 
Directive 1992/43/EEC of 21 May 1992 on the Conservation of natural 
habitats and of wild fauna and flora (the Habitats Directive) 
2.2.7 
The aim of the Habitats Directive is to contribute towards ensuring bio-
diversity through the conservation of natural habitats and of wild fauna 
and flora.  Measures taken pursuant to this Directive by the Member 
States are designed to maintain or restore, at favourable conservation 
status, natural habitats and species of wild fauna and flora of 
community interest whilst also taking into account economic, social and 
cultural requirements and regional and local characteristics.  The

Conservation of Habitats and Species Regulations 2010 implement the 
Habitats Directive in England and Wales. 
Directive 2009/147/EC of 30 November 2009 on the conservation of 
wild birds (the Birds Directive) 
2.2.8 
The Birds Directive provides a comprehensive scheme for the 
protection of wild bird species naturally occurring within the EU.  The 
Directive places great emphasis on the protection of habitats suitable 
for supporting endangered and migratory species, introducing a system 
of Special Protection Area designation to protect important habitats.  
The Wildlife and Countryside Act 1981 and the Conservation of 
Habitats and Species Regulations 2010 implement the requirements of 
the Birds Directive in England and Wales. 
Directive 2008/50/EC of 21 May 2008 on ambient air quality and 
cleaner air for Europe (the Ambient Air Quality Directive) 
2.2.9 
Council Directive 96/62/EC on ambient air quality assessment and 
management (the Air Quality Framework Directive) described the basic 
principles of how air quality should be assessed and managed in the 
Member States.  
Subsequent 'Daughter Directives' introduced 
numerical limits, thresholds and monitoring requirements for a variety of 
pollutants including oxides of nitrogen and sulphur dioxide to guarantee 
that there are no adverse effects with regard to human health.  The Air 
Quality Standards Regulations 2010 give effect, in England and Wales, 
to the Ambient Air Quality Directive. 
2.3 
Overview of Decision Making under the Planning Act 2008 & 
Policy Context  
2.3.1 
The Power Generation Plant, with its integral components, is 
categorised as a NSIP and therefore will be determined by the SoS 
under the regime established by the PA 2008.   
2.3.2 
Section 104 of the PA 2008, provides that in making decisions on DCO 
applications, the SoS must have regard to any relevant NPS and must 
decide applications in accordance with it unless the adverse impacts of 
the proposal would outweigh its benefits (or in certain other limited 
circumstances).  
2.3.3 
As set out in NPS EN-1, ‘this NPS, when combined with the relevant 
technology-specific energy NPS, provides the primary basis for 
decisions’ (paragraph 1.1.1) and that the SoS  ‘should start with a 
presumption in favour of granting consent to applications for energy 
NSIPs’ (paragraph 4.1.2).

- 28 - 
 
 
2.3.4 
Section 104 of the PA 2008 also requires the SoS to have regard to 
any Local Imapct Report and other matters which the SoS “thinks are 
both important and relevant to the Secretary of State’s decision”. These 
matters may include the Development Plan Documents or other 
documents in the Local Development Framework.  
2.3.5 
Indeed, Paragraph 4.1.5 of NPS EN-1 states “other matters that the 
SoS may consider both important and relevant to [his] decision making 
(see paragraph 2.3.2 above) may include Development Plan 
Documents or other documents in the Local Development Framework. 
In the event of a conflict between these or any otherf documents and 
an NPS, the NPS prevails for purposes of decision making given the 
national significance of the infrastructure”.  
2.3.6 
The proposed DCO Application will be examined by the SoS  either by 
a single commissioner or a panel, which will submit a report containing 
a recommended decision to the Secretary of State who takes the final 
decision as to whether to grant a DCO for the proposed Project.  
2.4 
National Policy Statements 
2.4.1 
The NPSs which are relevant to the consideration of the proposed DCO 
Application are: 
� 
NPS EN-1The Overarching National Policy Statement for Energy ; 
� 
NPS EN-2 National Policy Statement for Fossil Fuel Electricity 
Generating Infrastructure ;  
� 
NPS EN-4 National Policy Statement for Gas Supply Infrastructure 
and Gas and Oil Pipelines; and  
� 
NPS EN-5 National Policy Statement for Electricity Networks 
Infrastructure 
2.4.2 
NPS EN-1 contains government policy on energy and energy 
infrastructure development, representing the needs case for any 
proposal for an energy NSIP.  
2.4.3 
NPS EN-1 recognises that there is a significant need for new energy 
infrastructure.  It states that pending plant closures in the UK will 
reduce available capacity by 22 GW by 2020 as a result of tightening 
environmental legislation and older power stations approaching the end 
of their useful life (paragraphs 3.3.7 to 3.3.9).  
2.4.4 
NPS EN-1 also sets out guidance on the consideration of alternatives 
when developing a new energy generation project (paragraphs 4.4.2-
 
 
 
Hirwaun Power Project Preliminary 
Environmental Information Report

4.4.3) and guidance relating to criteria for ‘good design’ of new 
developments (Section 4.5)  
2.4.5 
Specific guidance on good design is also provided in NPS EN-2, 
including that “applicants should demonstrate good design particularly 
in respect of landscape and visual amenity (…) and in the design of the 
project to mitigate impacts such as noise and vibration, transport 
impacts and air emissions.” (Paragraph 2.3.16).  
2.4.6 
In Section 4.6 of EN-1, the consideration of Combined Heat and Power 
(CHP) is denoted as an assessment principle in itself and references to 
other guidance and viability considerations are set out.  It is stated that 
applicants should consider CHP from the earliest point and it should be 
a criterion for site selection (paragraph 4.6.7).  
2.4.7 
Section 4.8 of NPS EN-1 also sets out how applicants and the SoS 
should take the effects of climate change into account when developing 
and consenting NSIPs.  Paragraph 4.8.11 requires any adaptation 
measures to be based on the latest set of UK Climate Projections, the 
Government’s latest UK Climate Change Risk Assessment (when 
available) and in consultation with the Environment Agency (or Natural 
Resources Wales in the case of the Project). 
2.4.8 
Other assessment principles that are particularly likely to be relevant to 
energy NSIPs are set out as follows in EN-1 (relevant paragraph 
numbers given in brackets): 
� Pollution control (4.10) describes the relationship with other regimes 
(e.g. Environmental Permitting) which is essentially that the decision 
maker should be satisfied that “potential releases can be adequately 
regulated 
under 
the 
pollution 
control 
framework” 
without 
unacceptable cumulative impacts arising; 
� Safety (4.11) and Hazardous Substances (4.12): describes the 
relationship with other regimes and the general requirement that the 
decision maker will need to be satisfied that they are complied with.  
� Health (4.13): requires that an assessment of potential health 
impacts is made in relation to each element of the project, such as 
in relation to air quality, waste or noise and describing the 
relationship with other regimes, stating at 4.13.5 that where 
separate air quality regulations are (or will be) satisfied then the 
decision maker is likely to consider these effective mitigation, 
whereas for noise or other aspects it will take account of health 
concerns when setting requirements.

� Nuisance and amenity (4.14): the relationship with common law 
nuisance, statutory nuisance, and the importance to be attached by 
the SoS to their consideration during the determination process, are 
set out.  
� Security (4.15): government policy is set out as being ‘to ensure 
that, where possible, proportionate protective security measures are 
designed into new infrastructure projects at an early stage in the 
project 
development’ 
with 
documentary 
requirements 
and 
relationships to other guidance set out. 
2.4.9 
As well as generic assessment principles, EN-1 also identifies a 
generic list of impacts which could arise from an energy NSIP and 
criteria by which they should be assessed. These specific topics 
include ecology, landscape, noise and socio-economics. These topics 
are discussed in more detail when describing the preliminary 
assessment of impacts presented in this PEIR. 
2.4.10 
NPS 
EN-2 
(Fossil 
Fuel 
Electricity 
Generating 
Infrastructure) 
supplements EN-1 in providing specific Government policy on fossil fuel 
generating NSIPs such as the Project.  NPS EN-2 sets out a number of 
specific impacts that could arise from a fossil fuel generating NSIP and 
criteria by which they should be assessed. These specific topics 
include air quality, landscape and visual, noise and vibration, and water 
quality and resources. These topics are discussed in more detail when 
describing the preliminary assessment of impacts in this PEIR.  
2.4.11 
It is noted that the Gas Connection and Electrical Connection are below 
the relevant size thresholds to be categorised as NSIPs themselves. 
However, given the integral nature of these  components they will form 
part of the proposed DCO Application. Accordingly, NPS EN-4 and EN-
5 are recent and relate to a similar nature of development, they are 
likely to be important and relevant in the determination of the 
application in respect of these components. 
2.4.12 
The main provisions of these NPSs are set out below.  Policies and 
assessment criteria pertaining to particular environmental topics are set 
out in the relevant topic chapter elsewhere in this PEIR. 
2.4.13 
NPS EN-4 sets government policy on the relevant considerations and 
factors that should be taken into account as to route selection for 
developers for, inter alia, gas pipeline NSIPs. The NPS sets out a 
number of impacts that could arise from such development and criteria 
by which they should be assessed. These specific topics include

Local Planning Policy 
Rhondda Cynon Taf Local Development Plan up to 2021 (2011) 
2.6.1 
The Rhondda Cynon Taf Local Development Plan up to 2021 was 
adopted by the Council in March 2011 and sets out  “.....the framework 
for decisions to be made up until 2021 on how land is used in the 
County Borough, for example what type of development is appropriate 
or desirable and how best to protect our environment”. 
2.6.2 
The Local Development Plan provides part of the Development Plan 
against which applications under the TCPA regime are to be 
determined, and parts may be relevant and important under the PA 
2008 regime.  
2.6.3 
Section 4 of the plan sets out the Core Strategy for Rhondda Cynon Taf 
and outlines the spatial strategy for guiding all future development and 
land use in the Borough.  Section 5 sets out detailed area wide policies, 
and Section 6 outlines specific policies for the northern and southern 
areas of the Borough.  
2.6.4 
The area of Hirwaun Industrial Estate proposed for the development of 
the Power Generation Plant is designated in the Proposals Map as 
Policy CS 9 Waste Management.  The Hirwaun Industrial Estate is 
identified as a regional site that is able to accommodate a range of 
waste management options to meet the capacity requirements set out 
in the South East Wales Regional Waste Plan.  The Local Development 
Plan notes that “in identifying Hirwaun Industrial Estate as a suitable 
site for waste management, it is not the intention that the employment 
uses at the site should cease.” 
2.6.5 
Other policies of the Local Development Plan of potential relevance to 
the proposed Project are:  
� CS1 – Development in the North  
� CS9 – Waste Management

Other Relevant Policy and Guidance 
2.7.1 
The following are considered to be potentially relevant policy and 
guidance in considering the potential impact of the Project:  
� The Electricity Market Reform (2012);  
� A Low Carbon Revolution: Wales’ Energy Policy Statement (2010);  
� Environment Strategy for Wales (2006); 
� Gas Generation Strategy (2012); and 
� Turning Heads – A Strategy for the Heads of the Valleys (June 
2006).  
� Energy Wales – A Low Carbon Transition 
2.7.2 
A comprehensive review of potentially relevant policy and evidence will 
be undertaken during the pre application process. 
The Electricity Market Reform (2012) 
2.7.3 
The Electricity Market Reform (EMR) has been developed to meet 
three main objectives: 
� Ensuring the future security of electricity supplies; 
� Driving the decarbonisation of electricity generation; and 
� Minimising costs to consumers. 
2.7.4 
These measures are designed to provide both technical and economic 
encouragement for an increase in the development of low carbon 
technologies.   
2.7.5 
In terms of the proposed Project, one of the most relevant aims of the 
EMR is to provide “.... a mechanism to support security of supply, if 
needed, in the form of a Capacity Market” (Paragraph 23).  
2.7.6 
Although the EMR focuses heavily on the need for decarbonisation, 
there is also a strong focus on the need for security of supply and a mix 
of energy generation technologies on line at any one time.  The EMR

also recognises that gas fired power generation will continue to play a 
crucial role in the UK energy mix going forward.  
2.7.7 
The Energy Bill will be the primary piece of legislation to come about as 
a result of the EMR, although it is currently at Committee Stage in the 
House of Lords.  The Energy Bill seeks to enact the key drivers that are 
necessary to achieve the recommendations set out in the EMR.  
A Low Carbon Revolution: Wales’ Energy Policy Statement (2010) 
2.7.8 
In terms of energy production, the WAG reflects the UK policy position, 
the work of the UK Climate Change Commission and the UK National 
Policy Statements on Energy and Renewables through its Policy 
Statement: ‘A Low Carbon Revolution: Wales’ Energy Policy 
Statement, March 2010.’ The statement sets out a framework for 
carbon reduction in Wales, provides targets and advice to LPAs for 
implementation of policy into LDPs. 
2.7.9 
The Energy Policy Statement aims to maximise energy savings and 
energy efficiency to make producing the majority of the energy Wales 
needs from low carbon sources that are more feasible and less costly.  
Secondly the statement recognises energy needs in a modern society 
will remain considerable, and must be met securely from low carbon 
sources. 
2.7.10 
It draws on the work of: the Wales Climate Change Strategy; the 
National Energy Efficiency and Savings Plan; the Green Jobs Strategy; 
and the Ministerial Advisory Group on Economy and Transport’s report 
on “The Energy Sector”. 
2.7.11 
The statement also reflects the UK policy position, the work of the UK 
Climate Change Commission and the UK National Policy Statements 
on Energy and Renewables. 
The Environment Strategy for Wales (2006) 
2.7.12 
The Environment Strategy for Wales outlines the WAG’s long term 
strategy for the environment of Wales, setting out the strategic direction 
for the next 20 years.  The purpose of the Strategy is to provide a 
framework within which to achieve an environment that is clean, 
healthy, biologically diverse and valued by the people of Wales.  The 
WAG wish to see the Welsh environment thriving and contributing to 
the economic and social well-being and health of all of the people of 
Wales.

further developed as a result of the consultation exercise and remains 
to be confirmed in the ES that will accompany the proposed DCO 
Application.  
3.1.6 
In due course, the information in this PEIR will be added to through 
consultation and the continuing work indicated, as is necessary, to 
allow for preparation and finalisation of a comprehensive ES that will 
accompany the DCO Application in respect of the proposed Project. 
3.2 
Methodology of the Environmental Impact Assessment 
3.2.1 
In accordance with the PA 2008 and the EIA Regulations, the EIA 
process for the Project has included the following: 
� 
Establishing, through consultation, the Scope of the EIA including 
obtaining a Scoping Opinion from the SoS; 
� 
Consideration of any potential technical and environmental 
alternatives;  
� 
Establishing a comprehensive understanding of the existing 
baseline environmental conditions for the Project Site and the 
relevant study areas for each topic;  
� 
Identifying the potential environmental impacts resulting from the 
Project;  
� 
Determining how the potential environmental impacts can be 
avoided, reduced or off-set through informed design and / or further 
mitigation and how its benefits may be enhanced; 
� 
Assessing the significance of the potential environmental impacts in 
conjunction with other impacts arising from the Project and those 
from other neighbouring developments and / or sources (in-
combination and cumulative impacts); and 
� 
Proposing options as to how any significant residual impacts will be 
mitigated, managed and monitored.  
3.2.2 
A brief description of these steps is provided here. 
Establishing the Scope of the Environmental Impact Assessment 
3.2.3 
Under Section 42 (‘Duty to Consult’) of the PA 2008, there is a duty 
placed on developers to consult certain prescribed bodies as well as 
local communities.  In this respect, HPL first met Rhonda Cynon Taf 
County Borough Council (RCTCBC) to discuss the Project in April 
2011. HPL is continuing to consult with RCTCBC throughout all phases 
of the Project.

3.2.4 
Before commencing the EIA, HPL requested a Scoping Opinion from 
PINS in May 2013.  The request was supported by a Scoping 
Document that described the key anticipated environmental issues that 
would require detailed evaluation as part of the EIA process.  The 
formal Scoping Opinion was received in July 2013, and has allowed for 
agreement on the likely significant environmental impacts of the Project 
and, therefore, the aspects of the environment on which the EIA should 
focus.   
3.2.5 
The Scoping Report can be found on the Planning Inspectorates 
website and HPLs website; the Scoping Opinion can also be found on 
the Planning Inspectorates’ website.  
Establishment of ‘Worst Case Scenario’ 
3.2.6 
The Project Scoping Report, submitted to PINS in May 2013 set out a 
number of potential development alternatives to generate up to 
299MWe at the Project Site.  These development alternatives have 
now been refined since issue of the Scoping Report and SCGT has 
been identified as the preferred and most appropriate technology (see 
Section 5 of this PEIR for further details). Despite this, there are still 
several configuration options of SCGT plant available to generate up to 
299MWe at the Project  Site.  These different options mainly relate to 
the number of gas turbine generator units used at the Power Gneration 
Plant Site. Each gas turbine generator unit consists of one or two gas 
turbines venting to a single stack.  As described in Section 4 of this 
PEIR, it is possible that only one unit, of up to 299MWe is used. 
Alternatively, it may be that up to five units of up to circa 59MWe each 
are used.  The proposed DCO Application will be flexible enough to 
allow HPL to achieve a 299 MWe project by building between one to 
five gas turbine generator units. For the reasons explained in Section 5, 
it will not be possible to make a decision on this in advance of 
submitting the proposed DCO Application.  
3.2.7 
It should be noted that the other integral supporting infrastructure at the 
Power Generation Plant Site including water tanks, administration 
building, stores, electricity banking compound, gas receiving station, 
and gatehouse will remain constant, no matter how many gas turbine 
generator units are used. Additionally, the Gas Connection and 
Electrical Connection route corridor options will also remain the same.  
Both routing options for the Gas connection and both routing options 
(one underground and one overhead) for the Electrical Connection are 
considered in this PEIR. A decision on the preferred option for each will 
be made before submission of the proposed DCO Application and a 
preferred option assessed in the ES.

3.2.8 
As stated in Sections 5 and 6 of this PEIR, air quality modelling has 
indicated that a minimum stack height of 25m would be required for 
adequate dispersion of exhaust gases and to meet legislative air quality 
targets (i.e. IED).  Taking into consideration potential differences in 
technology choices available from different Original Equipment 
Manufacturers (OEMs), the requirement to fit constant emissions 
monitors (CEMS) and silencers into the stack, it is envisaged that the 
maximum height of stacks at the Power Generation Plant will be 35m. 
This height applies to all technology choices and is not dependent on 
the number of units present at the Power Generation Plant Site.  
Therefore if one gas turbine generator is used, one stack of up to 35m 
would be required and if five gas turbine generators are used, five 
stacks of up to 35m each would be required. 
3.2.9 
In accordance with PINS Advice Note 9 (Rochdale Envelope), rather 
than assess every possible iteration for the Project the assessments in 
the PEIR (and the ES when it is prepared) are based on an 
assessment of the realistic 'worst case' scenario from within the Project 
parameters. 
3.2.10 
Taking the above into consideration, it has been determined that for all 
topic areas to be addressed in the EIA apart from socio-economics, a 
realistic ‘worst case’ scenario from the perspective of environmental 
impacts would be five gas turbine generator units. However, the stack 
heights assessed in these topic areas vary (either 25m or 35m) 
depending on the nature of the topic. This is explained in each section.  
3.2.11 
The assessment is based on the continuous operation of the Power 
Generation Plant. This is an appropriate basis for the assessment 
because the pattern of any intermittent operation cannot be predicted 
with certainty. Where there is the possibility that intermittent operation 
could give rise to more significant effects than continuous operation (for 
example start-up noise) this been considered in the individual topic 
chapters.

Measurement and Establishment of Environmental Baseline 
3.2.13 
In undertaking an EIA for any project it is important to identify the 
environmental baseline for the potential receptors which may be 
impacted by the Project by e.g. noise, ecology, air quality.  This allows 
the impacts of the proposed Project to be compared and / or combined 
with the existing quality of the environment in order to ensure an 
informed assessment of the potential impacts and to allow the 
identification of the most appropriate mitigation which could be 
employed to minimise any adverse impacts.   
3.2.14 
To establish the baseline, a study area that is appropriate for each 
assessment topic is identified.  Next, a range of environmental data is 
gathered from a combination of sources in respect of the study area.  
This has included: 
� 
Documentary information on the Power Generation Plant Site, Gas 
Connection and Electrical Connection route corridors, and their 
surroundings within each relevant study area, including information 
available from the previous environmental impact assessment work 
for other projects;  
� 
Field survey information, including: Phase 2 ecological surveys; 
landscape character assessments; background noise levels; 
ground conditions / contaminated land assessments, location of 
sensitive receptors and traffic levels on the road network; and 
� 
Data held by both statutory and non-statutory consultees.  
Description of the Proposed Development and Identification of Potential 
Impacts 
3.2.15 
A full description of the Project Site and surroundings is provided in 
Section 4 of this PEIR.  The environmental topics to be assessed and

Evaluation and Quantification of Potential Impacts 
3.2.16 
To help evaluate and quantify the likely significant environmental 
effects of the Project, environmental significance criteria will be 
employed to ensure that the identified impacts are fully understood.  
Effects may be positive (i.e. beneficial) or negative (i.e. adverse). 
3.2.17 
Environmental significance criteria are important as they will help 
inform the determination by the competent authority of the overall 
acceptability of the Project.  An understanding of the significance 
criteria for all assessed impacts will be an important and relevant 
consideration in the determination of the proposed DCO Application in 
respect of the Project.   
3.2.18 
The 
significance of environmental 
effects resulting from the 
construction (including demolition), operation and decommissioning of 
the Project will generally be presented in this PEIR and the final ES 
using a series of matrices.  These will be developed to describe the 
sensitivity of receptors which have the potential to be impacted by the 
development and the magnitude of any impacts which are likely to 
arise.  The magnitude of impact and sensitivity of receptor will be cross 
referenced to give an overall significance of effect for any potential 
impact.  Where it is not possible to quantify impacts, a precautionary 
qualitative assessment will be carried out, based on available 
knowledge and professional judgement.  
3.2.19 
The operational life of the proposed Power Generation Plant is 
approximately 25 years, following which the decommissioning phase 
will take place.  Given the longevity of the proposed Project, 
assumptions have been made based on current knowledge of

3.2.20 
In order to provide a consistent approach and enable comparison of 
impacts upon different environmental components, the assessments 
generally follow the structure and use the terminology outlined below in 
Tables 3.2 – 3.4.  However, it is noted here that for some impact 
sections, significance criteria may need to differ depending on the 
conditions encountered at the Project Site.  The criteria will therefore be 
subject to further discussion with statutory consultees.  Each technical 
chapter of the ES will clearly identify and explain any specific criteria 
used. Unless otherwise stated, effects of moderate significance or 
above are considered to be significant for the purposes of the EIA 
Regulations. 
3.2.21 
Two broad types of potential mitigation measures will be described in 
the ES: embedded 
mitigation namely design/standard control 
measures, which will be used to produce an initial assessment of 
impact; and further specific mitigation, which may be introduced where 
appropriate and taken into account in the assessment of residual 
impacts.

Mitigation and Monitoring 
3.2.22 
Full consideration has been given to the potential mitigation measures 
which could be used to ensure that any potentially adverse significant 
environmental impact of the Project is minimised.   
3.2.23 
In the hierarchy of mitigation, likely significant adverse effects should, in 
the first instance, be avoided altogether; where this is not possible such 
effects should then reduced and, finally, off-set.   
3.2.24 
Significant adverse effects are best avoided by incorporating 
appropriate measures during the detailed design process.  As such, the 
iterative nature of the EIA can help to inform the development of the 
final design of the Project.  
3.2.25 
The Project has and will continue to be developed in such a way that 
the reduction and, wherever possible, elimination of any associated 
significant adverse environmental impacts are integral to the overall 
design philosophy.   
3.2.26 
Where it is not possible to avoid adverse significant environmental 
effects, potential mitigation and monitoring measures will be discussed 
in each assessment chapter.   
Indirect / Secondary and Cumulative Impacts 
3.2.27 
Indirect and secondary impacts are those which arise as a result of a 
direct / primary impact.  For example, deterioration of water quality in a 
watercourse due to an effluent discharge (which would be a direct 
impact) could have an indirect / secondary impact on aquatic 
biodiversity.  Cumulative impacts occur when a receptor is subject to

multiple impacts from multiple schemes.  Indirect / secondary impacts 
are discussed in each impact section of this PEIR.  A preliminary 
discussion of cumulative impacts is presented in Section 16.  
3.3 
Presentation of the Preliminary Environmental Impact Assessment 
in this Document 
3.3.1 
Sections 6 to 15 present the preliminary assessment of the likely 
environmental impacts associated with the development of the Project. 
These assessments are not final and still ongoing. Accordingly the 
preliminary findings presented in this PEIR are the findings as at this 
time; they are subject to refinement and change as the ES is prepared.  
Each section deals with a specific environmental topic area and has 
been broken down to include a number of sub-sections.  Typically, 
these are:   
Introduction 
3.3.2 
This sub-section will provide details of the key issues with regard to the 
specific environmental topic and impacts being considered.   
Legislative and Policy Context 
3.3.3 
This sub-section addresses relevant legislation and policy in respect of 
the topic under consideration insofar as not already addressed in 
Section 2. 
Worst Case Scenario for Assessment 
3.3.4 
This sub-section will describe the realistic 'worst case' Power 
Generation Plant scenario for the topic being assessed from within the 
proposed Project parameters described in Section 4..  
3.3.5 
Both route corridor options for the Gas Connection and Electrical 
Connection are assessed in each technical section.  
Assessment Methodology and Significance Criteria 
3.3.6 
This sub-section will provide details of the assessment methodology 
adopted for the purposes of the EIA insofar as it differs from that set out 
in this Section 3.  The assessment methodology chosen reflects the 
relevant guidelines and legislative standards.  In addition, significance 
criteria to be used to quantify the extent of the environmental impact of 
the Project will be identified and related to the generic criteria set out 
above in Tables 3.2 - 3.4.

Project.  
Preliminary Assessment of Potential Impacts 
3.3.8 
This sub-section discusses the preliminary findings of the EIA studies. 
In undertaking this assessment both quantitative and qualitative 
evaluations are necessary, in varying degrees, depending on the 
nature of the environmental impact being assessed.  The significance 
of the environmental impacts identified is addressed as appropriate 
with reference to the significance criteria established.  Unless otherwise 
stated, effects of moderate significance or above are considered to be 
significant for the purposes of the EIA Regulations. 
Potential Mitigation / Management Techniques 
3.3.9 
This sub-section will provide details of the emerging mitigation 
measures that are proposed to ensure that any potential adverse 
environmental impacts are either minimised or, wherever possible, 
avoided altogether.  Where relevant, monitoring may be identified to 
allow it to be demonstrated that the mitigation measures employed are 
effective.   
Preliminary Assessment of Residual Impacts  
3.3.10 
This section will assess, on a preliminary basis, using the information 
compiled to date by HPL, the significance of the environmental impacts 
following the application of any identified mitigation measures.  The 
section will conclude with a preliminary statement of the overall 
significance of the impact. 
Next Steps 
3.3.11 
Where information on the baseline or likely potential impacts of the 
Project is not currently available, ‘Next Steps’ are proposed in order to 
identify the assessment methodologies and or additional information 
required to provide a comprehensive description of the relevant 
environmental baseline and the potential for impact on the relevant 
receptors.

PROJECT AND SITE DESCRIPTION 
4.1 
Overview of the Project 
4.1.1 
As previously described in Section 1 of this PEIR, the proposed Project 
consists of three main elements: the Power Generation Plant, the Gas 
Connection and the Electrical Connection.  
4.1.2 
The Power Generation Plant would be situated within Hirwaun 
Industrial Estate, approximately 1.3 km north east of Rhigos, 2km west 
of Hirwaun, and 5 km west of Aberdare, in south Wales.  The 
approximate Grid Reference of the Power Generation Plant Site is SN 
938 061.  The Power Generation Plant would be located on an area of 
land which is currently occupied by a large industrial building used for 
storage and distribution – owned by International Greetings UK Ltd. 
4.1.3 
The location of the proposed Project Site is shown in Figure 1.1. The 
Power Generation Plant Site, which is within the Project Site, covers an 
area of approximately 7.5ha. However, the footprint of the Power 
Generation Plant would be smaller than this (approximately 5ha). 
Figure 4.1 shows an indicative illustration showing the position and 
layout of the Power Generation Plant.  .  This position will be refined 
prior to submission of the proposed DCO Application, having regard for 
consultation responses.   
4.1.4 
Construction of the Power Generation Plant and Gas and Electrical 
Connection will require a temporary area for equipment / materials 
laydown which will also provide an area for the assembly of large plant 
items within a reasonable distance of the construction site.  
4.1.5 
A small area to the south of the Power Generation Plant (to the south of 
Main Avenue) could be used as a laydown area for the storage of plant 
and equipment during construction. The laydown area is indicated on 
Figure 4.2.   
4.1.6 
This laydown area may also be used periodically during operation for 
any maintenance activities that require movement of large plant items.  
4.1.7 
Currently, two Gas Connection route corridor options are being 
considered (hereafter referred to as Gas Connection route corridor 
options 1 and 2). Option 1 will run from the Power Generation Plant in a 
southerly direction into Feeder 2 on the gas NTS, with an approximate 
length of 1.1 km. Option 2 would run in an easterly direction alongside 
Rhigos Road before heading south alongside the A4061. Gas 
connection route corridor option 2 would also connect into Feeder 2 
and is of a similar length.

4.1.8 
Similarly, there are two Electrical Connection route corridor options 
under consideration (hereafter referred to as Electrical Connection 
route corridor options 1 and 2). The Electrical Connection will connect 
the Power Generation Plant to a new substation, approximately 250m 
west of the Power Generation Plant Site (Rhigos Substation).  The 
substation is currently under construction by National Grid Company 
(NGC) in connection with the development of the Pen Y Cymoedd Wind 
Farm, which has recently been granted Section 36 consent (under the 
Electricity Act 1989) and deemed planning consent.  The Electrical 
Connection would either be an overhead line which would run directly 
from the Power Generation Plant in a west / north westerly direction to 
the Rhigos substation  (route corridor option 1), or an underground 
cable alongside existing roads (Main Avenue and Fourteenth Avenue) 
and into the substation (route corridor option 2)).  
4.1.9 
A decision on the preferred Gas Connection and Electrical Connection 
route corridor options will be made before the proposed DCO 
Application is submitted and feedback from consultation will also feed 
into this decision.  
4.1.10 
Figure 4.2 shows the Project Site along with Electrical Connection and 
Gas Connection route corridor options.  
4.2 
Site and Surroundings 
4.2.1 
The Power Generation Plant Site will be situated entirely within the 
Hirwaun 
Industrial 
Estate. 
The 
Industrial 
Estate 
currently 
accommodates several industrial units including a metal recycling 
facility and an industrial plant hire business. The Power Generation 
Plant Site is currently occupied by industrial buildings with hardstanding 
(owned and occupied by International Greetings UK Ltd.).  
4.2.2 
The Project is entirely within the administrative boundary of RCTCBC, 
although it is also close to the area administered by the Brecon 
Beacons National Park Authority (BBNPA).    
4.2.3 
The Power Generation Plant Site and immediate surrounding area are 
in an environment characterised by industrial buildings, hardstanding, 
scrub grassland and plantation woodland.  The Power Generation Plant 
Site (as shown on Figures 1.1, 4.1 and 4.2) is currently occupied by a 
large distribution warehouse building.   
4.2.4 
To the north west of the Power Generation Plant Site, close to the 
Rhigos Substation, the Industrial Estate gives way to marshy, 
waterlogged grassland comprising some rushes and reeds.  No 
construction is proposed on this area. Although Electrical Connection

- 57 - 
 
 
route corridor option 1 is shown to cross directly over the marshy 
grassland, this will only be the case if it is an overhead line.  
4.2.5 
The Power Generation Plant Site is accessed via Main Avenue and 
Fourth Avenue, which both run through the Hirwaun Industrial Estate.  
These roads connect to Fifth Avenue, which in turn connects to Rhigos 
Road (to the south of the Power Generation Plant Site).  The Industrial 
Estate is well served in terms of highway connections.  
4.2.6 
The road network in the vicinity of the Power Generation Plant Site can 
be seen in Figure 1.1 and is discussed in more detail in Section 13 of 
this PEIR. 
4.2.7 
Surrounding developments include the A465 ‘Heads of the Valleys’ 
Road (which runs approximately 0.1km north of the Power Generation 
Plant Site), Tower Colliery (approximately 1 km south of the Power 
Generation Plant Site) and Penderyn Reservoir ( approximately 1 km 
north of the Power Generation Plant Site). The closest residential areas 
include;   
� 
Rhigos (1.3km south west); 
� 
Hirwaun (1.4km east); 
� 
Penderyn (1.8km north); and  
� 
Aberdare (5km east).  
4.2.8 
Both Electrical Connection route corridor options are also situated 
entirely within the area administered by RCTCBC. Land over which 
Electrical Connection route corridor 1 is situated is characterised by 
minor roads, hardstanding and scrub within Hirwaun Industrial Estate. 
4.2.9 
Electrical Connection route corridor option 2 crosses over marshy, 
waterlogged ground to the west of the Power Generation plant Site. 
The closest residential properties to the Electrical Connection are the 
same as those identified for the Power Generation Plant Site.  
4.2.10 
Land over which the Gas Connection route corridor options will cross is 
initially similar to the Power Generation Plant Site (i.e. industrial in 
nature) although the final two thirds of the routes run through 
agricultural land.  The Gas Connection would run alongside the 
Hirwaun Industrial Estate, alongside roads, through some agricultural 
land, and close to industrial buildings. The Gas Connection would also 
be situated entirely within the area administered by RCTCBC.  The 
closest residential areas to the Gas Connection route corridor options 
are as for the Power Generation Plant Site and Electrical Connection 
route corridor options.

4.3 
Relevant Planning History 
4.3.1 
Hirwaun Industrial Estate was established in WWII as a Royal 
Ordnance Factory (ROF), one of four across South Wales. 
4.3.2 
The estate passed into public sector ownership, eventually coming 
under the control of the Welsh Development Agency who invested in 
the location and undertook the speculative development of smaller 
factory units around the estate.  In the 1960s, GEC Marconi established 
a TV factory at Hirwaun; in c.1974 a joint venture was entered into by 
GEC with Hitachi and in 1984 Hitachi took over the factory entirely. 
Hitachi expanded the plant with the ‘Advance Factory’ constructed in 
1988 however by 2001 the decision had been taken to close the plant.  
4.3.3 
In 2002 International Greetings UK Ltd. acquired the freehold interest in 
the entire facility and has operated a storage and distribution facility for 
its paper gift wrap product since that date. 
4.3.4 
Enviroparks were granted planning permission in 2010 to build an 
Energy from Waste (EfW) plant on a site approximately 500m north of 
the proposed Power Generation Plant Site.  The plant will process 
around 150,000 tonnes of waste per year by 2014/15. By 2016, it is 
envisaged that the plant will process around 240,000 tonnes of waste 
per year. 
4.3.5 
Land immediately to the south of the Power Generation Plant Site and 
adjacent to the potential laydown area has recently been developed by 
Green Frog Power Ltd as a 20MW Power Generation Plant. The plant 
comprises 52 x 440kW diesel generator engines which are fired on 
liquid fuel.  The plant only operates at times of peak demand or to 
balance the grid. 
4.3.6 
The Pen Y Cymoedd Wind Farm has recently been granted consent 
under Section 36 of the Electricity Act 1989 and deemed planning 
permission.  It is approximately 5km south west of the proposed Power 
Generation Plant Site at its closest point and comprises 76 turbines 
across an area of 4,680 hectares. The land ranges in altitude between 
360m and 600m AOD, with each turbine being up to 145m in height.  
Site preparation, in the form of tree felling has already begun at the 
site.  
4.3.7 
The land south of Hirwaun has been designated as a Strategic Site in 
the RCT Local Development Plan.  This land has been allocated for the 
construction of 400 dwellings, 89 acres of employment, a new primary 
school, a 2000m2 retail store, medical / community centre and informal 
recreation.  Development of the Strategic Site will be subject to a large-
scale reclamation scheme due to the fact that it overlaps with the site of

Tower Colliery, presently subject of open cast operation likely to last for 
approximately six years hence. 
4.4 
Brecon Beacons National Park (BBNP) Authority  
4.4.1 
The boundary of the BBNP lies approximately 250m north of the 
Project at its closest point.   
4.4.2 
The BBNP covers an area of 250 square miles. It was first designated 
in 1957 as an area of natural beauty and one which contains unique 
and important flora and fauna 
4.4.3 
The two statutory purposes of the National Park Authorities are to 
conserve and enhance the natural beauty, wildlife and cultural heritage 
of the Park and to promote opportunities for the enjoyment and 
understanding of its special qualities. 
4.4.4 
In April 1996, the Brecon Beacons National Park Authority (BBNPA) 
came into being. It replaced the former Brecon Beacons National Park 
Committee which had managed the Park since 1974. The National 
Park Authority has 24 members: 16 appointed by the Unitary 
Authorities and 8 appointed by the National Assembly for Wales. 
4.5 
Detailed Description of Power Generation Plant and Generating 
Technology 
4.5.1 
The Power Generation Plant will be designed to provide a total output 
of up to 299 MWe at rated site conditions, and will be fired on natural 
gas.   
4.5.2 
Previous consultation (i.e. the ‘Hirwaun Power Project Scoping Report 
(issued to PINS in May 2013)) identified four potential technology 
choices for the Power Generation Plant; Combined Cycle Gas Turbine 
(CCGT); SCGT and Reciprocating Gas Engines (RGE). The potential 
for utilising CHP opportunities at the Power Generation Plant Site using 
these technologies was also carefully considered. Since the Scoping 
Report was issued, a number of further studies have been undertaken 
to refine the technology choice.  The outcome of these studies has 
determined that an SCGT plant is the most suitable technology choice 
for a ‘peaking’ plant generating up to 299MWe at the Project Site.  
4.5.3 
The results of these studies and the design evolution of the Project are 
presented in more detail in Section 5 of this PEIR.  
4.5.4 
The main generating equipment in a SCGT plant comprises gas turbine 
generators. Each gas turbine generator consists of an inlet air filter, an 
air compressor, combustion chamber, one or two power turbines,

generator, stack and exhaust silencer.  Air will be compressed in the 
compressor of the gas turbine generator(s) and gaseous fuel injected 
into the combustion chamber(s) where the fuel will burn producing hot, 
high-pressure gases.  These gases will expand across the rotor blades 
of the gas turbine generator(s), which will drive both the compressor 
and the electrical generator(s). The hot exhaust gases are then routed 
directly to the stack and emitted to the atmosphere. The stack contains 
a silencer to reduce noise pollution. 
4.5.5 
SCGT plants usually use aero-derivative gas turbine generator(s) (i.e. 
turbines derived from the aeronautical industry), primarily because of 
their suitability to frequent start-ups, flexibility, high efficiency and high-
availability maintenance options. To achieve up to 299 MWE, HPL 
envisage using 3, 4 or 5 individual aero-derivitave GTGs.  
4.5.6 
However, ‘industrial’ type units can also be used which are typically 
larger and often more suited to longer operational hours.  They offer 
more efficiency but less flexibility. Industrial gas turbines differ from 
aeronautical designs in that the frames, bearings, and blading are of 
heavier construction. To achieve up to 299 MWe, HPL would likely use 
1 or 2 individual industrial gas turbine generators. 
Peaking Plant 
4.5.7 
As explained in Section 1 and 4.5.2 above, the Power Generation Plant 
will be designed to operate as a ‘peaking’ or flexible plant.  This means 
that the Power Generation Plant will operate for up to 1,500 hours per 
annum and only be used when it is required to even out the electricity 
grid, e.g. when there is a surge in demand for electricity associated with 
a particular event (e.g. where many people across the country boil 
kettles following the end of a popular television programme) or where 
there is a sudden drop in power being generated from plant which are 
constantly operational (e.g. a sudden outage). 
4.5.8 
Peaking plants help to ‘balance out’ the grid at times of peak electricity 
demand and also help to support the grid at times when other 
technologies (e.g. wind and solar plant) cannot generate electricity due 
to the weather conditions. Typically, peaking plants do not operate for 
long periods of time. However when they do operate, they are 
nevertheless vital in ‘evening out’ the power in the grid.  
Emissions and Stack 
4.5.9 
The exhaust gasses and waste heat produced as part of the 
combustion process will be discharged to the atmosphere by stacks. 
Typically, each gas turbine generator unit would have its own dedicated

stack. However, if the chosen configuration contains two separate 
turbines connected to one generator, the exhaust stacks from these 
individual turbines may be combined into one.  Therefore, in total, the 
Power Generation Plant will consist of between one and five gas 
turbine generator units and between one and five stacks. 
4.5.10 
The gas turbine generators will be equipped with emissions control 
abatement, which limits the production of NOx to a maximum of 
50 mg/Nm3.  Whether by water injection or dry low emission 
combustors, these techniques represent best available techniques 
(BAT) for limiting emissions of NOx to atmosphere from gas turbine 
generators without the addition of chemical solutions, such as selective 
catalytic reduction using ammonia. 
4.5.11 
A stack height sensitivity study examined differing stack heights in 
intervals from 20 m to 80 m (inclusive).  The stack height sensitivity 
considered long term and short term contributions to ground level 
concentrations of NO2. 
4.5.12 
Stack emissions will be continuously recorded to ensure correct and 
efficient operation of the plant.  Any significant deviations will be 
alarmed and corrections carried out on occurrence.  Records will be 
maintained of performance and deviation.  Full facilities for interfacing 
information, control and alarm systems will be installed so that the plant 
can be operated from the central control room via the distributed control 
system (DCS).  In the event of a fault in the gas turbine generator(s) or 
other major plant items the Power Generation Plant will shut down 
automatically in a controlled manner. 
4.5.13 
Natural gas sourced from the NTS (where sulphur content in the gas is 
generally negligible) is a clean burning fuel and does not produce the 
particulate or sulphur emissions associated with burning coal; 
consequently flue gas cleaning equipment is not required. 
4.5.14 
Further discussion of emissions control is provided in Section 6 of this 
PEIR which sets out the environmental assessments undertaken to 
date for air quality.  
Cooling 
4.5.15 
Since no cooling is required for the condensing of steam, the cooling 
requirements of SCGT plants are significantly lower than, for example, 
CCGT plants.  The auxiliary cooling requirements (for lubrication oil, 
etc.) would be met via dry air cooling through the use of fin-fan coolers 
or Air Cooled Condensers (ACC).

Maintenance 
4.5.16 
Sufficient spares will be held to ensure reliable operation of the plant.  
Materials and finishes will be selected to meet this objective and to 
ensure that the appearance of the Power Generation Plant does not 
deteriorate with time.  Periodic and routine maintenance will take place 
on average once every six months, to ensure optimal operation of the 
plant at all times.  
4.5.17 
Typically, planned maintenance would be carried out by one or two 
skilled personnel, meaning that traffic movements would be kept to a 
minimum.  
Other Power Generation Plant Items 
4.5.18 
In addition to the main gas turbine generator units at the Power 
Generation Plant Site, the following integral buildings will also be 
present:  
� 
Process Water Tanks: One or more water tanks will be required to 
store process water which will be used as make up for the gas 
turbine generators.  High purity process water will be tankered in to 
the Power Generation Plant Site and stored in water tanks.     
� 
Fire Water Tanks: The fire water storage tank will be designed to 
comply with the relevant fire regulations and will be installed 
together with fire pumps, hose reels, fire hydrants and portable 
extinguishers. 
� 
A Control Building: Required in order to monitor the plant 
operation and house plant controls. 
� 
A Workshop and Stores Building: To store certain strategic and 
routine maintenance spares and to provide a facility for carrying out 
minor maintenance of the plant. . 
� 
A Gatehouse: Needed to provide security and maintain a log of 
site attendance, deliveries etc;  
� 
A Switchyard: Required to connect the electrical infrastructure 
from the Power Generation Plant to transformers before export to 
the National Grid; and  
� 
A Gas Receiving Installation: Required to process gas coming 
from the NTS to feed into the Power Generation plant Site at the 
right flow and pressure conditions.

Gas Connection 
4.6.1 
A new gas pipeline will be required to connect the Power Generation 
Plant to the NTS in order to provide a reliable supply of fuel.  
4.6.2 
The UK National Grid Gas system is split into two parts, the NTS and 
the LTS (Local Transmission System). 
4.6.3 
The NTS represents the infrastructure designed to transmit gas large 
distances around the country, these are generally large diameter 
pipelines (> 24”/600mm) operating at high pressure (~70barg). The 
NTS is the backbone of the UK gas infrastructure and as such does not 
reach all points of mainland Britain; the load driven extremities are 
covered by the LTS. 
4.6.4 
A Gas Connection Feasibility study was undertaken for the Project in 
December 2012.  The purpose of the study was to define and evaluate 
the options available for connecting the Power Generation Plant to a 
suitable source of fuel gas, and provide a recommendation on the most 
appropriate option for this connection. 
4.6.5 
Preliminary pipeline calculations were performed, including Maximum 
Operating Pressure of the system, Maximum Incidental Pressure, Pipe 
Nominal Diameter, Design Factor, Wall Thickness, Minimum Building 
Proximity Distance and Area Classification. 
4.6.6 
A Crossing / Risk Register has been prepared for each potential 
corridor routeing.  A Level 1 Route Study has been performed for this 
report, which has analysed a specified relevant area of interest for 
archaeological, natural and built environment issues having regard to 
considerations raised in NPS EN-4.

4.6.7 
Previous consultation documents (e.g. ‘Hirwaun Power Project Scoping 
Report’ (issued to PINS in May 2013)) identified four possible 
connection points as being potentially suitable locations to connect into 
the NTS infrastructure.  All four options connect to Feeder 2, a 600mm 
high pressure steel pipeline (known as the Garway to Rhigos Pipeline) 
that passes between the village of Hirwaun and the Power Generation 
Plant Site.  No suitable connections were identified to the LTS.  
4.6.8 
Since the Scoping Report was issued, a number of further studies have 
been undertaken to refine the route corridor choice.  The outcome of 
these studies is that there are now two remaining potential options to 
connect into the NTS and two potential suitable route corridors.  
4.6.9 
The refinement studies and the reasons for discounting two of the route 
corridor options are outlined in more detail in Section 5 of this PEIR.  
4.6.10 
The Location of Feeder 2 and the two possible remaining connection 
options are shown on Figure 4.2.  
Gas Connection Route Corridor Option 1 
4.6.11 
Gas Connection route corridor option 1 is approximately 1.1 km in 
length including no major road crossings, two minor road crossings, no 
major water crossings, three minor water crossings and 0.19 km of in-
road mainlaying.  
4.6.12 
The pipeline begins at the Power Generation Plant Site heading south, 
past industrial buildings in the Hirwaun Industrial Estate, across Main 
Avenue and then under Rhigos Road; a single carriageway that runs 
along the entire south side of Hirwaun Industrial Estate.  
4.6.13 
The route continues south of Rhigos Road into fields where it crosses 
under a set of overhead lines and continues heading south east where 
it then crosses two field drains.  The route then turns east where it 
crosses under an unnamed minor road and another field drain. It then 
turns south east again, and heads towards the A4061. The route 
crosses under A4061 in an easterly direction. The route reaches the 
NTS east of the A4061 at Grid RefSN938055. 
Gas Connection Route Corridor Option 2 
4.6.14 
Gas Connection route corridor option 2 is approximately 1.25 km in 
length including no major road crossings, no minor road crossings, no 
major water crossings, one minor water crossing and 0.79 km of in-
road mainlaying.

4.6.15 
The route begins at the Power Generation Plant Site heading south, 
immediately turning east, with mainlaying required down Main Avenue. 
Mid way down Main Avenue the route passes under an overhead 
walkway. The route then continues for a short distance up Main Avenue 
before turning south east through a field and reaches Fifth Avenue.  
4.6.16 
The route then turns south, mainlaying down Fifth Avenue, the single 
carriageway road that runs along part of the eastern boundary to the 
Power Generation Plant Site.  The route then continues being 
mainlayed across the Rhigos Road/A4061 and continues heading 
south where it crosses under a set of overhead lines.  The route 
continues being mainlayed down Rhigos Road/A4061 before leaving 
the road. 
4.6.17 
The route turns into the field east of the A4061 for a short distance 
before turning back to run south, parallel to the A4061 where it crosses 
under another set of overhead lines. Shortly after crossing the 
overhead lines the route turns to the east where it connects to the NTS 
east of A4061.  
Common Elements 
4.6.18 
Both of these route corridors are shown together on Figure 4.2.  It is 
noted that this Figure shows large buffers or potential areas in which 
each route may be developed.  This is due to the fact that no detailed 
studies have yet been undertaken to assess constraints.  However, 
following more detailed studies, the route choices will be refined as the 
Project progresses and the options narrowed to a preferred single route 
corridor option.   
4.6.19 
The actual diameter of the gas pipeline would be approximately 8 
inches.  The permanent right required for the Gas Connection would be 
approximately 10m in width, whereas the construction footprint required 
would be of the order of 25m in width on agricultural land but wider at 
crossing points.  
4.6.20 
Consultation feedback will be considered in determining which corridor 
option is the most appropriate.  
4.6.21 
Connection to the NTS at any high pressure pipeline would require two 
above ground facilities to be installed, an Above Ground Installation 
(AGI), typically in the form of a Minimum Offtake Connection (MOC) 
facility, which would be owned by NGC, and a PIG Trap Facility (PTF) 
which will be owned by HPL.  The two facilities would contain the 
following pieces of equipment. 
4.6.22 
The MOC (approximately 30x30m) would contain:

� 
Remotely Operable Valve (ROV); 
� 
Control and Instrumentation Kiosk; 
� 
Electrical Supply Kiosk. 
4.6.23 
PTF (approximately 30x23m) would contain: 
� 
PIG Launching Facility; 
� 
Emergency Control Valve; 
� 
Isolation Valve; 
� 
Control and Instrumentation Kiosk; 
� 
Electrical Supply Kiosk. 
4.6.24 
The gas pipeline would be designed, constructed and tested to comply 
with the Institute of Gas Engineers’ (IGE) Recommendations on 
Transmission and Distribution Practice – IGE/TD/1: Edition 5, 2009 - 
Steel Pipelines and Associated Installations for High Pressure Gas 
Transmission (IGE/TD/1). 
4.6.25 
The standard gas pipeline wall thickness would comply with the 
requirements of IGE/TD/1, which defines the minimum safe separation 
distance between a high pressure gas pipeline and normally inhabited 
buildings / major roads / major railways.  This minimum safe separation 
distance is known as the Building Proximity Distance (BPD).  If 
normally inhabited buildings / major roads / major railways are closer 
than 1 BPD (i.e. the gas pipeline is in an area where additional 
protection is required), thicker wall steel pipe (known as proximity pipe) 
would be used.  The exact locations and lengths of where thicker wall 
steel pipe will be used will be confirmed throughout the assessment 
and detailed design stages. 
4.6.26 
The gas pipeline would be buried to a depth of cover which is in 
accordance with recognised industry standards.  For example, depths 
of cover would be: 
� 
No less than 1.2m in agricultural land; 
� 
No less than 2m under road crossings; and 
� 
No less than 1.7m under water crossings. 
4.6.27 
The gas AGI would be accessed via the A4061. A short length of 
access track would be constructed between the A4061 and the gas AGI 
in order to allow infrequent maintenance visits.

4.7 
Electrical Connection 
4.7.1 
A new connection would be required to allow electricity generated by 
the Power Generation Plant to be exported to the electricity 
transmission network. 
4.7.2 
A grid connection assessment was undertaken for the Power 
Generation Plant Site in 2012. This assessment was subsequently 
reviewed and updated.  The assessments analysed the transmission 
and distribution grid connection options and determined the available 
thermal and fault level capacity on the electrical network. Discussions 
were also held with NGC.  
4.7.3 
Following discussions with NGC it is proposed that the most suitable 
point of connection for the Project is at the new 400 kV Rhigos 
substation, which will require a dedicated 400 kV connection of 
between 250-650m in length, depending on the route chosen from the 
Power Generation Plant to the substation.  This substation is expected 
to be completed by 2016, when the nearby 256 MW Pen Y Cymoedd 
Wind Farm is also due to be connected. 
4.7.4 
Currently, there are two Electrical Connection route corridor options 
being considered for connection of the Power Generation Plant into the 
Rhigos Substation. These are as follows: 
Electrical Connection route corridor option 1:  
4.7.5 
Electrical Connection route corridor option 1 is approximately 250m in 
length and would consist of a 400 kV overhead line. The line would run 
directly west from the Power Generation plant into the Rhigos 
Substation.  
4.7.6 
Up to three pylons of approximately 35m in height would be required in 
order to support the overhead line. Up to two pylons would be situated 
within the Power Generation Plant Site and one within the Rhigos 
Substation.  
Electrical Connection route corridor option 2:  
4.7.7 
This route is approximately 650m in length. It would consist of a 400Kv 
buried underground cable. The cable would run from the Power 
Generation Plant, alongside Main Avenue, to the south of a disused 
industrial warehouse, before heading north, alongside Fourteenth 
Avenue in between disused industrial warehouse buildings before 
connecting into the Rhigos Substation.

4.7.8 
During construction, a trench of approximately 3m in width and 
between 1-2m in depth would be excavated to lay the electricity cable.  
4.7.9 
Following more detailed studies, the Electrical Connection route 
corridor options will be refined as the Project progresses and the 
options narrowed to a preferred single route corridor option".  
4.7.10 
Both electrical connection route corridor options are shown on Figure 
4.2.  
Construction, Operational and Decommissioning  
4.7.11 
Construction (including demolition) and commissioning of the Project 
will take between 18 and 36 months, depending on the final choice of 
plant selected. 
4.7.12 
The main works associated with the construction phase would be the 
demolition of existing buildings, removal of old foundations / 
hardstanding, excavation and site levelling for new foundations, 
potential piling (if required) and the installation of the Gas Connection 
and Electrical Connection. The demolition elements of the Project will 
be considered as part of the assessment of construction impacts. 
4.7.13 
The Power Generation Plant will be designed to have an operational 
life of up to 25 years, after which time it will be decommissioned or re-
powered depending on the nature of the electricity market and energy 
mix at the time. For the purposes of the EIA, it will be assumed that the 
Power Generation Plant will be decommissioned.  
4.7.14 
Decommissioning would comprise the removal of all Power Generation 
Plant items and restoration of the Power Generation Plant Site.  It is 
likely that some underground structures, including the Electrical and 
Gas connection, may be left in situ to avoid any adverse environmental 
impacts associated with their removal.  Due regard would be paid to all 
best practice guidelines on the decommissioning of projects which are 
relevant at the time. Where possible, items of plant would be re-cycled 
or re-used.

SITE SELECTION, ALTERNATIVES AND DESIGN EVOLUTION 
5.1 
Introduction 
5.1.1 
The EIA Regulations4 require that an ES should include an outline of 
the main alternatives that have been studied by the applicant and an 
indication of the main reasons for the ultimate choice of option, taking 
into account likely significant environmental impacts.  Under the EIA 
Regulations there is no requirement to assess alternatives, only a 
requirement to provide information on those alternatives that have been 
considered. 
5.1.2 
The Project has gone through several iterations and evolutions in 
design, and the site selection itself has been an iterative process.  The 
following alternatives have been considered for the Project as part of 
the design evolution process:  
� Alternative development sites;  
� Alternative layouts;   
� Alternative technologies for electricity generation; 
� Alternative options for the Electrical Connection; and 
� Alternative options for the Gas Connection. 
5.1.3 
An account of these alternatives is provided below.  
5.2 
Alternative Development Sites 
5.2.1 
In deciding upon the site for the Power Generation Plant, WPL has had 
regard to a number of factors such as those described in NPS EN-2. 
However, in line with paragraph 2.2.1 of NPS EN-2, "it is for energy 
companies to decide which applications to bring forward and the 
government does not seek to direct applicants to particular sites for 
fossil fuel generating stations." Unlike, for example, nuclear generating 
stations. 
5.2.2 
As part of a detailed feasibility assessment, WPL has looked at a range 
of sites around the UK to support power generation plants of this 
nature. The key factors considered necessary in a site were broadly 
fourfold; technical, environmental, economic, and in line with local 
planning policy.

5.2.3 
In terms of technical constraints, the size of the site (i.e. large enough 
to support a Power Generation Plant of up to 299MWe and integral 
infrastructure and the proximity of a site to appropriate gas and 
electrical connection points are both key considerations.  
5.2.4 
From an environmental perspective, the site must have due regard to 
closest sensitive receptors (to avoid unnecessary impacts from noise 
and visual disturbance), the current make up of the surrounding area 
(to limit impacts on the landscape character of the area), previous site 
uses and land quality (to avoid sterilisation of the best quality 
agricultural land or mineral assets) and proximity to sensitive ecological 
habitats.  
5.2.5 
Based on these factors, the Project Site was considered suitable for the 
siting of a 299 MWe Power Generation Plant for the following reasons:  
� 
Close proximity to the gas NTS; 
� 
Close proximity to a suitable electrical substation with spare 
capacity; 
� 
The Power Generation Plant Site is within an existing industrial 
estate; 
� 
The Power Generation Plant Site is currently covered in 
hardstanding / buildings so there is minimal potential to impact on 
the runoff rate / drainage regime; 
� 
The Project Site is surrounded by similar industrial developments 
including steel clad warehouses and a proposed EfW plant; 
� 
Compatibility with local planning policies which seek to steer new 
development and employment opportunities to Hirwaun Industrial 
Estate (e.g. the RCTCBC Local Development Plan).  
� 
The Project Site is outside of areas at risk of flooding;  
� 
The Project Site is served by a well developed road network; and  
� 
There is adequate space to develop the Power Generation Plant 
and integral infrastructure.  
5.3 
Power Generation Plant 
5.3.1 
Previous consultation documents (e.g. the Hirwaun Power Project 
Scoping Report (submitted to PINS in May 2013)) identified four 
potential technology options which could be developed to generate 
299MWe.

5.3.2 
The four options under consideration were: CCGT plant, SCGT plant 
and RGE plant. Consideration was also given to the potential utilisation 
of CHP.  
5.3.3 
Since the submission of the Scoping Report, further conceptual design 
studies and economic modelling have determined that an SCGT plant 
would be the most suitable option for a 299 MWe peaking plant at the 
Power Generation Plant Site. This has been determined based on the 
following environmental, business, and technical considerations.  
Environmental 
5.3.4 
In a CCGT plant, the hot exhaust gases are routed through a heat 
recovery steam generator (HRSG), where they are condensed to form 
steam, which then drives a steam turbine. In comparison, the hot 
exhaust gases in a SCGT plant are discharged to the atmosphere via 
the stack, with the flue gases.  This means that the flue gases 
discharged from a SCGT plant are significantly hotter than those 
discharged from a CCGT plant, and therefore the gases are much more 
buoyant.  
5.3.5 
This means that a much lower stack is required for a SCGT plant to 
achieve the same dispersion height and rate as a CCGT plant.  The 
Project Scoping Report suggested that the stack of a single unit CCGT 
plant could be up to 90m to achieve adequate dispersion in order to 
meet air quality standards.  Subsequent air quality modelling screening 
runs (described in detail in Section 6 of this PEIR) have determined that 
a suitable stack height to achieve adequate dispersion of pollutants 
from the Power Generation Plant is only 35m. This represents a 
significant overall reduction in stack height, and the associated 
landscape and visual impacts arising from the tallest structures on site. 
Further description of the Landscape and Visual assessment of the 
Project is outlined in Section 11 of this PEIR.  
5.3.6 
In comparison to RGE plant, although there is no benefit in terms of 
reduction of stack height (stack height for RGE units and SCGT units 
would be similar) the noise emissions from RGE plant are typically 
louder than for a SCGT plant. This is because RGEs operate using 
ignition of gaseous fuels and air in a specific mix which causes motion 
of a piston to generate electricity.  
5.3.7 
Furthermore, in order to generate steam for the steam cycle of a CCGT 
plant, a sizeable quantity of water would be required.  It is clear that the 
availability of water in the local area is extremely limited. There are no 
surface watercourses that would be suitable for abstractions, and the 
Project Site is not underlain by a principal aquifer.  As such, SCGT

technology is preferable in this area as the water requirement is 
significantly less, and could be met with the occasional delivery of 
water by tanker. 
Business Drivers 
5.3.8 
Compared to both RGE and CCGT plant, SCGT units typically have a 
much smaller capital cost per MW installed.  This is largely because 
CCGT plant are more complex in their operation (see below for 
technical considerations) however they are more efficient. RGE plant 
are also more flexible and allow operation on different fuels.  However, 
as explained in Section 4, the nature of the Power Generation Plant is 
that of a peaking plant which will operate for up to 1500 hours per year.  
Over this timescale, HPL considers that the benefits in efficiencies or 
flexibility which can be achieved by using a CCGT or RGE plant are 
very minimal and do not justify the additional capital costs of these 
plant. As SCGT plants are less complex in operation than CCGT or 
RGE plant, they are also cheaper to construct and maintain. 
Technical  
5.3.9 
As previously mentioned, technically, CCGT plant is more complex 
than a SCGT plant, primarily because of the presence of an HRSG and 
steam cycle. In turn, this leads to more difficult maintenance 
requirements and a much longer construction timescale because of the 
large number of interconnections.  
5.3.10 
Although CCGT plant are more efficient, due to their use of waste heat 
(around 60% compared to 40% for SCGT) this gain in efficiency  
becomes much more marginal given the limited number of operational 
hours which the Power Generation Plant will run (less than 1500).  HPL 
considers that the marginal gains in efficiency of CCGT do not 
outweigh the landscape and visual, economic and technical drivers that 
favour SCGT for peaking plants such as the Project. 
5.3.11 
Another technical advantage of SCGT plants over CCGT is that they 
have much quicker start up times than CCGT plant. This is an 
advantage because peaking plant are typically only required to operate 
for short periods of time. Therefore, a SCGT plant is able to start 
generating electricity very quickly after it starts up and thus can benefit 
from delivering power and balancing out the grid much quicker.  
5.3.12 
Typically, RGE plant come in much smaller unit sizes (up to 20MWe) 
than either SCGT or CCGT plant (one unit can be up to 299MW). 
Therefore the construction timescales and overall land take are far

greater. Maintenance on such units is also more time consuming and 
costly.  
5.3.13 
Due to the method in which fuel is combusted in RGEs, there is also 
usually a requirement for additional control of NOx emissions in order 
to meet IED guidelines. This additional NOx control would usually be in 
the form of Selective Catalytic Reduction (SCR) which would not only 
require further landtake and more maintenance, but may also require 
ammonia or urea injection to operate. This then has impacts in terms of 
environmental disposal of catalysts, as well as ammonia slip which is 
released from the stack.  
CHP 
5.3.14 
Efficient CHP plants are usually designed to meet the demands of an 
identified heat load.  Electrical power generation is utilised, where 
applicable for local process plant, and the balance exported to the grid.  
The heat demands of industrial processes are usually continuous, and 
district heating demands are also usually continuous (albeit on a 
seasonal basis).   
5.3.15 
Therefore, this is in direct contrast to the operation of a peaking plant, 
which is designed to operate intermittently and unpredictably. 
Therefore, any heat loads would be better served, and met more 
appropriately and efficiently by dedicated CHP plants, allowing the 
peaking plant to provide the necessary support to the National Grid 
Electricity Transmission System.   
5.3.16 
With this in mind, CHP has not been a significant factor in the 
technology choice of the plant. 
5.3.17 
In addition, as SCGT plant do not have any associated HRSG / steam 
turbine plant, the provision of steam from an SCGT plant would not be 
possible without the provision of additional steam raising plant / 
equipment. 
Conclusion 
5.3.18 
Following consideration of environmental, economic and technical 
drivers, HPL considers that the balance of these considerations clearly 
favours SCGT technology (without CHP) for delivery of a 299MW 
peaking plant.

5.4 
Gas Connection 
5.4.1 
The Project Scoping Report identified four potential Gas Connection 
options to connect the Power Generation plant to Feeder 2 on the NTS.  
5.4.2 
Further analysis has determined that two of these route corridor options 
are no longer feasible (options 3 and 4). Therefore, route corridor 
options 1 and 2 (as identified in Section 4 of this PEIR) are still under 
consideration for the Project. (Option 1 has been modified slightly from 
the route which was originally put forward in the Scoping Report) 
5.4.3 
Further studies revealed that Route Corridor option 4 was the least 
suitable option for the Gas Connection. This is because it passes in 
close proximity to a cemetery, was the second longest route (and 
therefore the second most expensive option) and passed close to 
Hirwaun Ponds Nature Reserve. There is also limited potential to route 
the pipeline along linear features such as field boundaries and roads. 
Therefore it had the largest potential for environmental impacts.  
5.4.4 
Route corridor option 3 was also ruled out as it is the longest (and 
therefore most costly) route. It also requires 5 minor water crossings 
and passes very close to the Hirwaun Ponds Nature Reserve and so 
therefore has the biggest potential of all of the routes to negatively 
impact on sensitive ecology and hydrology. It also has the potential to 
impact on the operations of a number of buildings on the Hirwaun 
Industrial Estate.   
5.5 
Electrical Connection 
5.5.1 
Currently, two electrical connection options are still being considered, 
as described in Section 4 of this PEIR.  
5.5.2 
As stated in the Scoping Report, it was determined at an early stage 
that should the electrical connection pass directly from the Power 
Generation Plant to the Rhigos Substation (i.e. the route currently 
shown for Electrical Connection route corridor option 1) then it would be 
an overhead line, in order to avoid direct disturbance to potentially 
sensitive ecological habitats in the Hirwaun Industrial Estate Site of 
Important Nature Conservation (SINC). 
5.5.3 
The benefits of an overhead line connection are that it would be a 
shorter and more direct route than underground. This would have 
associated cost savings. The connection of an overhead line into the 
Rhigos Substation would also be simpler than for an underground 
cable, as the connections going into the substation from the Pen Y 
Cymoedd Wind Farm would also be via overhead line.

5.5.4 
The disadvantage of an overhead line is that there would be above 
ground infrastructure, including up to three pylons and the overhead 
line itself.  This has the potential to create a landscape and visual 
impact to the surrounding area.  
5.5.5 
Although an underground cable would not have the same associated 
landscape and visual impacts as an overhead line connection, it would 
require cable trenching works, which could give rise to noise and dust 
impacts during construction. The underground cable route is also 
longer and therefore more expensive.  
5.5.6 
Further refinement studies and the results of feedback from the formal 
consultation process will help to derive a preferred option for the 
Electrical Connection.

AIR QUALITY 
6.1 
Introduction 
6.1.1 
The construction, operation and decommissioning of the Power 
Generation Plant have the potential to impact on local air quality.  
During construction (including demolition) and decommissioning, all 
elements of the Power Generation Plant have the potential to generate 
air emissions (e.g. through generation of dust) and thus impact on local 
air quality and therefore will be assessed within the EIA.  During 
operation, the only potentially significant emissions sources will 
comprise the stacks. 
6.1.2 
A preliminary assessment of the construction and decommissioning of 
both options for the Gas and Electrical route corridor options is also 
provided. However, the operation of these elements of the Project is 
not considered to have the potential to generate any impacts to air 
quality during their operation and are therefore not assessed further.   
6.2 
Legislative and Policy Context 
Ambient Air Quality Directive 
6.2.2 
Council Directive 96/62/EC on ambient air quality assessment and 
management (the Air Quality Framework Directive) described the basic 
principles as to how air quality should be assessed and managed in the 
Member States.  Subsequent Daughter Directives introduced numerical 
limits, thresholds and monitoring requirements for a variety of pollutants 
including NOx and SO2 to guarantee that there are no adverse effects 
with regard to human health.   
6.2.3 
Directive 2008/50/EC of 21 May 2008 on ambient air quality and 
cleaner air for Europe (the Ambient Air Quality Directive) merges the 
Air Quality Framework Directive with the First, Second and Third 
Daughter Directives.  The Ambient Air Quality Directive identifies 
desired maximum ground level concentrations and the date by which 
the objectives should be met and introduces new objectives for fine 
particles.   
6.2.4 
The Air Quality Standards (Wales) Regulations 2010 (the AQS 
Regulations) give effect, in Wales, to the Ambient Air Quality Directive.

Air Quality Standards Regulations 2010 
6.2.5 
The AQS Regulations specify a series of standards and objectives for 
air quality in the UK.  The objectives are summarised, as appropriate to 
the Project, in Table 6.1.

6.2.6 
Previous versions of the AQS Regulations were implemented through 
the Air Quality Strategy for England, Wales, Scotland and Northern 
Ireland (2007).  
Local Air Quality Management 
6.2.7 
The Environment Act 1995 requires local authorities to review air 
quality within their district or borough in order to determine where 
pollutant levels identified in the Air Quality Framework Directive may be 
in excess of the standards.  
6.2.8 
If pollutant levels in an area are likely to exceed statutory objectives, 
then local authorities must declare an Air Quality Management Area 
(AQMA) and draft an Action Plan to achieve the statutory objectives.  
The Department of Environment, Food and Rural Affairs (DEFRA) has 
issued technical guidance5 to local authorities to assist in undertaking 
this task.   
6.2.9 
This gives the local authority a clear picture of the sources which can 
be controlled or influenced, and aid the local authority to target more 
effectively the relative contributions of industry, transport and other 
sectors and ensure that the solutions are cost effective and 
proportionate when producing their Action Plan.

6.2.10 
As part of the on-going review and assessment process of AQMAs, a 
phased approach has been adopted to ensure that the level of local 
authority assessment is commensurate with the risk of an air quality 
objective being exceeded.  Therefore, each local authority is required to 
undertake an Updating and Screening Assessment (USA) of the 
AQMAs within their administrative area in order to identify changes 
which have occurred since the previous review and assessment that 
could potentially lead to a risk of an air quality objective being 
exceeded.  Where a risk has been identified the local authority is 
required to undertake a more detailed assessment to determine the 
likelihood of an exceedance and revise the AQMA as appropriate.   
Industrial Emissions Directive (IED) 
6.2.11 
Directive 2010/75/EU on industrial emissions (integrated pollution 
prevention and control) (IED) recast seven directives related to 
industrial emissions, in particular Directive 2008/1/EC of 15 January 
2008 concerning integrated pollution prevention and control (the 
Integrated Pollution Prevention and Control (IPPC) Directive) and 
Directive 2001/80/EC of 23 October 2001 on the limitation of emissions 
of certain pollutants into the air from large combustion plants (the Large 
Combustion Plant Directive (LCPD)), into a single legislative instrument 
to improve the permitting, compliance and enforcement regimes 
adopted by Member States. 
6.2.12 
The IPPC Directive laid down measures to prevent or, where that is not 
practicable, to reduce emissions in the air, water and land introducing 
ELVs and BAT.  The LCPD prescribed ELVs for nitrogen oxides, 
sulphur dioxide and particulates.  These are the pollutants relevant to 
the EIA of the Project. 
6.2.13 
The IED makes provisions for the continuation of the requirements and 
principles of the IPPC Directive and the LCPD and introduces new, 
more stringent, ELVs with full compliance required by 1st January 
2016. 
6.2.14 
The LCPD and IPPC Directive are implemented in England and Wales 
by the Environmental Permitting (England and Wales) Regulations 
2010 (the EP Regulations).   
Environmental Permitting (England and Wales) Regulations 2010 
6.2.15 
The Environmental Permitting (England and Wales) (EP) Regulations 
2007 sought to introduce a single streamlined environmental permitting 
and compliance regime to apply in England and Wales. They do this by 
integrating the previous regimes covering waste management licensing

and Pollution Prevention and Control.  The EP Regulations increase 
the scope of the 2007 Regulations.   
6.2.16 
Natural Resources Wales (NRW) will control and regulate the Power 
Generation Plant with respect to the emissions to air from the stack(s) 
via an Environmental Permit that will be required for the Project, under 
the EP Regulations.  The Environmental Permit will include specific 
ELVs to apply to the Power Generation Plant for the relevant pollutants 
considered within the IED.  Such limits will be based on the associated 
emissions levels (AEL) of recognised BAT as per current Environment 
Agency (EA) guidance notes and the existing EU IPPC ‘Reference 
Document on Best Available Techniques for Large Combustion Plant’ 
(2006) and the draft update of this document, ‘Best Available 
Techniques Reference Documents for the Large Combustion Plants’ 
(2013) (together, “BREF Notes”). 
The Habitats Directive 
6.2.17 
The European Habitats Directive (92/43/EEC) sets out the legal 
framework requiring EU member states to protect habitat sites 
supporting vulnerable and protected species, as listed within the 
Directive.  This Directive is transposed into UK law by the Conservation 
of Habitats and Species Regulations 2010 and requires protection of 
ecological sites including Special Areas of Conservation (SACs) and 
Special Protection Areas (SPAs).  
6.2.18 
The Habitats Directive is implemented in England and Wales by the 
Habitats and Species Regulations 2010.   
The Ambient Air Quality Directive 
6.2.19 
Across the UK, site-specific critical levels (which relate to airborne 
pollutant concentrations at ground level) and critical loads (which relate 
to deposition of materials to soils) have been set for a variety of 
protected habitats and species in order to allow the quantitative 
assessment of the condition of ecologically sensitive sites and thus the 
protection of such sites by the relevant competent authorities.   
6.2.20 
The Ambient Air Quality Directive sets ambient air quality guidelines for 
NOx for the protection of ecosystems.  This imposes a long-term 
(annual average) limit for NOx of 30 µg/m3 (critical level).  In terms of 
the limit for the protection of ecosystems, it is important to define the 
areas in which the limit is to be achieved.  Directive 2008/50/EC states 
that sampling points to determine concentrations should be:

km2.   
6.2.21 
This is mirrored in the AQS Regulations. 
National Policy Statements 
6.2.22 
As explained in Section 2, EN-1 explains the assessment principles to 
which the Secretary of State will have regard in the examination of an 
energy NSIP (such as the proposed Project), and explains the generic 
air emissions impacts with regard to energy infrastructure.  Specific 
considerations for fossil fuel generating stations are provided in the 
NPS for Fossil Fuel Generating Infrastructure (EN-2). The NPSs for 
Gas and Oil Pipelines (EN-4) and Electricity Networks Infrastructure 
(EN-5) provide specific considerations potentially relevant to the Gas 
Connection and Electrical Connection respectively.  
6.2.23 
Paragraph 5.2.4 of EN-1 states that: “Emissions from combustion 
plants are generally released through exhaust stacks.  Design of 
exhaust stacks, particularly height, is the primary driver for the delivery 
of optimal dispersion of emissions and is often determined by statutory 
requirements.” 
6.2.24 
EN-2 highlights, in paragraph 2.5.3, that the significant emissions to air 
from fossil fuel generating stations will be oxides of nitrogen and 
sulphur dioxide, whilst noting that the emissions of sulphur dioxide from 
gas-fired generating stations may be negligible. 
6.2.25 
In relation to the assessment of air quality impacts by a developer, 
paragraph 5.2.10 of EN-1 requires that the Secretary of State takes into 
account any relevant statutory air quality limits and that developers 
should work with the relevant authorities to secure appropriate 
mitigation measures to allow the proposal to succeed. 
6.2.26 
Paragraph 5.2.11 states that: “The SoS should consider whether 
mitigation measures are needed both for operational and construction 
emissions over and above any which may form part of the project 
application.  A construction management plan may help codify 
mitigation at this stage.”

National and Local Policy 
6.2.27 
Whilst the PA 2008 is clear as to the primacy of the relevant NPS, other 
national and local planning policy may be considered important and 
relevant by the Secretary of State in the determination of an energy 
NSIP. 
6.2.28 
Planning Policy Wales (PPW) sets out the land use planning policies of 
the Welsh Government.  The document presents the commitment to 
sustainable development into the planning. 
6.2.29 
In addition, the Wales Spatial Plan sets a strategic framework that 
integrates the spatial aspects of national strategies for social inclusion 
and economic development, health, transport and environment. 
6.2.30 
PPW states that: 
The goal of sustainable development is to “enable all people throughout 
the world to satisfy their basic needs and enjoy a better quality of life 
without compromising the quality of life of future generations.” 
6.2.31 
The Welsh Government has a statutory duty, under the Government of 
Wales Act 2006 (Section 79), which requires Welsh Ministers to 
promote sustainable development and publish a scheme that sets out 
how this will be achieved (the latest of which was published in 2009). 
6.2.32 
The above scheme presents a definition of sustainable development in 
Wales.  As per PPW: 
“This means enhancing the economic, social and environmental well-
being of people and communities, achieving a better quality of life for 
our own generations in ways which:  
� 
promote social justice and equality of opportunity; and  
� 
enhance the natural and cultural environment and respect its limits 
- using only our fair share of the earth’s resources and sustaining 
our cultural legacy.” 
6.2.33 
The following principles (amongst others) are noted in PPW as 
reflecting principles that the Welsh Government expects all parties 
involved in the planning system to follow: 
� 
“taking a long term perspective to safeguard the interests of future 
generations, whilst at the same time meeting needs of people 
today; 
� 
respect for environmental limits, so that resources are not 
irrecoverably depleted or the environment irreversibly damaged.

This means, for example, mitigating climate change, protecting and 
enhancing 
biodiversity, 
minimising 
harmful 
emissions, 
and 
promoting sustainable use of natural resources; and 
� 
tackling climate change by reducing the greenhouse gas emissions 
that cause climate change and ensuring that places are resilient to 
the consequences of climate change.” 
6.2.34 
PPW identifies the, “... natural heritage and valued landscapes of 
Wales are not confined to statutorily designated sites but extend across 
all of Wales - to urban areas, the countryside and the coast,” and 
states: 
“The Welsh Government’s objectives for the conservation and 
improvement of the natural heritage are to:  
� 
promote the conservation of landscape and biodiversity, in 
particular the conservation of native wildlife and habitats;  
� 
ensure that action in Wales contributes to meeting international 
responsibilities and obligations for the natural environment;  
� 
ensure that statutorily designated sites are properly protected and 
managed;  
� 
safeguard protected species, and to  
� 
promote the functions and benefits of soils, and in particular their 
function as a carbon store.” 
6.2.35 
PPW states that: “Planning and environmental management are 
separate but complementary.”  The stated objectives in this regard are 
to:  
� 
“maximise environmental protection for people, natural and cultural 
resources, property and infrastructure; and  
� 
prevent or manage pollution and promote good environmental 
practice.” 
6.2.36 
PPW requires that every local planning authority in Wales must prepare 
Local Development Plan (LDP) for its area. The LDP will be the 
development plan for each county or county borough council and each 
National Park, superseding the Unitary Development Plan (UDP) or any 
other existing development plan. 
6.2.37 
The Rhondda Cynon Taf Local Development Plan 2006-2021 was 
adopted in 2011. Policy AW10 of the Local Development Plan covers 
Environmental protection and Public Health and states the following: 
“Development proposals will not be permitted where they would cause 
or result in a risk of unacceptable harm to health and / or local amenity

because of Air pollution........... unless it can be demonstrated that 
measures can be taken to overcome any significant adverse risk to 
public health, the environment and / or impact upon local amenity. 
6.3 
Realistic Worst Case Scenario for Assessment 
6.3.1 
In respect of Air Quality, the realistic worst case scenario from within 
the proposed Project parameters (which are described in Section 4 of 
this PEIR) are set out in Table 6.2.  
6.3.2 
The reason that this represents the realistic worst case in relation to air 
quality impacts is that the buoyancy of a plume is, principally, a function 
of its temperature and volume.  Assuming the thermal efficiency of the 
units for all options of between one and five units is the same, a 
specific plant electrical output will require a specific amount of natural 
gas.  The combustion of this gas would thus result in a specific volume 
of flue gas. 
6.3.3 
The temperature of the flue gases will be similar irrespective of the 
number of installed units.  However, if the flue gases are split between 
multiple stacks, the volumetric flow rate of each plume will be reduced 
(e.g. the use of five stacks will emit 20 per cent of the total flue gas 
volume) thus reducing the buoyancy of the flue gases proportionately. 
6.3.4 
The reduction in buoyancy will limit the potential for atmospheric 
dispersion of the flue gases.  For instance, simple plume rise 
calculations indicate that the potential plume rise for emissions from 
five individual stacks would be around half that which could be 
achieved for emissions for the same total volume of flue gas but from 
two individual stacks. 
6.3.5 
Additional evidence of this is provided in this Section as the 
assessment to date has considered two of the potential options for the 
number of units to be utilised for the Project.  Therefore, the assumed 
realistic worst case scenario is considered robust.   
6.3.6 
A preliminary assessment of both options for the Gas Connection and 
the Electrical Connection is presented in this section. A decision on the 
preferred option for each will be taken following consultation.

Assessment Methodology and Significance Criteria 
6.4.1 
The assessment methodology set out below is applicable to each of the 
construction, operation and decommissioning phases.   
Construction 
Airborne Particulate Matter 
6.4.2 
A preliminary assessment of the potential impact of construction site 
dust (including dust created from demolition) has been undertaken on a 
preliminary basis within this PEIR. It is based on the Institute of Air 
Quality Management (IAQM) ‘Guidance on the Assessment of 
Construction on Air Quality and the Determination of their Significance’ 
(January 2012).  A more detailed assessment, which will be more 
rigidly underpinned by this guidance will be presented in the final ES. 
This guidance states: 
“The risk of emissions of dust (all types) from a demolition/construction 
site causing a statutory nuisance, loss of amenity and/or health or 
ecological effects will be related to: 
� 
the activities being undertaken (demolition, number of vehicles and 
plant etc.); 
� 
the meteorological conditions (wind speed, direction and rainfall); 
� 
the proximity of receptors to the activity; 
� 
the duration of the activity; 
� 
the adequacy of the mitigation measures applied to reduce or 
eliminate dust; and 
� 
the sensitivity of the receptors to dust.

- 92 - 
 
 
Emissions of dust will vary depending on the activities being 
undertaken throughout the day; and mitigation must be designed to 
respond to this.” 
6.4.3 
The preliminary assessment presented in the PEIR has focussed on an 
initial indication of the likely impacts from a ‘typical’ construction site of 
this nature. However, future assessment will incorporate a number of 
stages in order to:  
� 
screen the requirement for a more detailed assessment so that 
activities unlikely to cause significant effects are not considered 
further;  
� 
determine the risk of dust effects and hence the need for additional 
mitigation (i.e. above the standard mitigation that may be expected 
to be applied to any construction sites); and 
� 
following the definition of the mitigation, the description of the 
residual effects and their significance. 
6.4.4 
Under the above Guidance, activities on-site are divided into four types 
to reflect their different potential impacts: 
� 
Demolition; 
� 
Earthworks; 
� 
Construction; and 
� 
Laying of access roads. 
6.4.5 
The assessment methodology examines the potential dust effects with 
regards to: 
� 
Annoyance / disturbance due to dust deposition / soiling; 
� 
Harm to ecological receptors; and 
� 
Human health impact due to increase in exposure to particulate 
matter of les than 10 microns (PM10).

The IAQM Guidance adopts a risk-based approach to air quality 
associated with construction / demolition and the magnitude of any 
potential impact is assessed as being within a dust emissions class that 
is Large, Medium or Small.  These are defined based on the type of 
activity as follows:

6.4.7 
The risk-based approach  considers the significance of any potential 
impact with regards to the number / sensitivity of receptors and the 
distances to the receptors. 
6.4.8 
The results of the assessments will ultimately produce a risk level for 
the site / area of assessment which will inform the mitigation and 
management techniques that should be implemented based on the 
recommendations of “The control of dust and emissions from 
construction and demolition – Best Practice Guidance” (Greater London 
Authority, 2006). 
Construction Vehicles and Traffic 
6.4.9 
A preliminary assessment of the impact of the emissions from 
construction / demolition vehicles (both on- and off-site) is provided in 
this PEIR and is based on the methodology prescribed in the 
Department for Transport ‘Design Manual for Roads and Bridges 
(DMRB) Volume 11 Section 3, Part 1: Air Quality’ for the estimation of 
emissions from vehicles. However, this will be expanded for the final 
ES and the methodology will explicitly follow this guidance.  
Operation 
6.4.10 
For the purposes of assessing operational impacts this preliminary air 
quality impact assessment has assessed the worst case scenario, as 
presented in Table 7.1, that is: 
� 
Operation of five aero-derivative units (each of c.59 MWe) 
6.4.11 
To assess the air quality impacts that will arise during operation, the 
assessment looks at the dispersion of the flue gases from the stack(s), 
being the potentially significant sources of emissions to air. 
6.4.12 
The impacts of the emissions from the stacks have then been 
quantitatively assessed using industry standard air dispersion 
modelling techniques in accordance with the latest EA guidance, 
particularly such guidance provided by their Air Quality Modelling and 
Assessment Unit (AQMAU).

Decommissioning 
6.4.13 
The air quality impacts of decommissioning will be similar to those that 
arise for construction. The assessment of these potential impacts will 
therefore be carried out on the same basis as those arising from 
construction activities. 
Ambient Air Quality and the Protection of Human Health  
6.4.14 
The AQS Regulations specify a series of standards and objectives for 
air quality in the UK.  The objectives are summarised in Table 6.1 and 
consider pollutants that are the principal products of industrial 
combustion processes.  In the case of the combustion of natural gas in 
a power station, these are NOx and CO. Assessment of these 
pollutants therefore forms the basis for the assessment of emissions for 
the operation phase of the Project. 
6.4.15 
Oxides of nitrogen (NOx) are primarily formed by two reaction routes.  
‘Thermal’ NOx is formed by the reaction of atmospheric oxygen and 
nitrogen at the high combustion temperatures within the gas turbine 
whilst ‘prompt’ NOx is formed by the reaction of atmospheric nitrogen 
with free radicals from the fuel via a complex series or reactions.  
Assessment of NOx is important because oxides of nitrogen 
subsequently convert to NO2, in the presence of ozone in the 
atmosphere.  
6.4.16 
CO is formed by the incomplete combustion of carbon in a fuel.  
Combustion in gas turbine generators is conducted at high excess air 
rates, typically 200-300 per cent excess air.  Therefore there will be 
only very low levels of carbon monoxide or unburned hydrocarbons 
present in the flue gases from the Project (as detailed in Tables 6.6 to 
6.7).   
Protection of Vegetation and Ecosystems 
6.4.17 
As set out above, the long-term (annual average) limit for NOx of 
30 µg/m3 is the critical level for the protection of vegetation and 
ecosystems.  The location of sampling points in order to demonstrate 
compliance with this standard (and therefore areas of where this 
standard should apply) is influenced by the presence of other industrial 
installations nearby.   
6.4.18 
The limitations to the applicability of this standard are noted above.  
Nevertheless, the impact of the Power Generation Plant will be 
assessed against the above standard in order to demonstrate the 
potential impact.  This is considered particularly important given the

location with respect to the neighbouring areas afforded EU protection 
for their ecological status. 
6.4.19 
Ecological receptors (listed below) may also be sensitive to the 
deposition of nutrient nitrogen and the deposition of acidity due to 
nitrogen as a result of the process contribution to ground level 
concentrations of NOx:

vi 
Woodland Park and Pontpren (1.2km north east of the Power

6.4.20 
Atmospheric nitrogen is a source of essential nutrients for vegetation 
and the ambient concentration commonly limits growth in temperate 
ecosystems.  Increased availability of nitrogen in the air (such as 
through increases in the ambient concentrations of NOx) can have an 
effect on species composition of an area, that would favour plants / 
vegetation with a high nitrogen demand.  The increased availability of 
atmospheric nitrogen can limit the uptake of other essential nutrients 
from soils such that vegetation may be affected by reduced levels of 
potassium and magnesium. 
6.4.21 
The deposition of acidity due to nitrogen (acidification) can lead to the 
loss of alkali nutrients (such as calcium, magnesium and potassium) in 
the soils.  Increased ground level concentrations of NOx and the 
associated deposition effects can increase the rate of acidification that 
can affect all aspects of the natural environment (i.e. soils, water, flora 
and fauna). 
6.4.22 
The deposition of nutrient nitrogen and the acidity due to nitrogen as a 
result of operation of the Power Generation Plant under all 
development scenarios will be undertaken in accordance with the EA 
guidance “AQTAG 06 - Technical Guidance on detailed modelling

approach for an appropriate assessment for emissions to air” (2010).  
Critical loads (to be used as standards for the assessment of 
significance) will be obtained from the Air Pollution Information Service 
(APIS). 
Air Dispersion Modelling 
6.4.23 
Air dispersion modelling can predict the ground level concentrations 
that occur due to the emissions from an elevated stack point source 
such as the stack(s) to be incorporated as part of the Project.  This 
subsection describes the key aspects of the dispersion modelling 
process undertaken for the purposes of the EIA for the Project.   
6.4.24 
The flue gases discharged from a stack have two sources of 
momentum.  One is related to the velocity of discharge.  This is usually 
designed to be in excess of 15 m/s as this value has been found to be 
sufficient to avoid immediate downwash of the plume.  Immediate 
downwash of a plume would not allow for adequate dispersion of the 
emissions from the stack and could result in significantly elevated 
ground level concentrations of pollutants in the immediate vicinity of the 
stacks.  Whilst contributing to the dispersion of stack emissions, the 
momentum from the velocity of discharge is soon dissipated.   
6.4.25 
The second source of momentum is much more significant and is 
related to the discharge temperature of the flue gases.  The flue gases, 
being warmer than the surrounding atmosphere into which they are 
discharged, have buoyancy and thus rise.  This process continues until 
the flue gases have cooled to the same temperature as the surrounding 
air.   
6.4.26 
Mathematical models are used to calculate the effects of these two 
sources of momentum and determine the height to which the flue gases 
will rise.  This height plus the height of the stack gives an ‘effective 
stack height’.   
6.4.27 
The mathematical model then determines the dispersion of the flue 
gases from this effective stack height.  Note that the effective height 
can be many times greater than the actual stack height as constructed 
due to the large amount of heat present in the flue gases.   
6.4.28 
Dispersion occurs as a result of turbulence, and turbulence can result 
from both buoyancy effects and wind shear (also called mechanical) 
effects.   
6.4.29 
As an example of buoyancy effects, on a sunny day, solar heating 
creates turbulence by heating the ground and the air near the ground.  
The buoyancy of the heated air causes it to rise, creating turbulence.

These are the thermals used by small plane and glider pilots on sunny 
days.  These can also rapidly disperse a plume in the surrounding air.  
At night, during stable conditions, the buoyancy effect is to suppress 
rather than cause or enhance turbulence.   
6.4.30 
Wind shear as a cause of turbulence is well known to pilots as well.  
Wind shear effects, important to air pollution modelling, result from high 
(several meters per second) wind speeds near the ground.  Since the 
wind speed at the ground is zero, any high wind speeds result in 
substantial wind shear.  Wind shear dominates over buoyancy effects 
not only under high wind conditions, but also near the ground under 
any conditions.   
6.4.31 
As a result of this, two parameters are used to define the “stability” of 
the atmosphere.  The first is the friction velocity which is a measure 
wind shear.   
6.4.32 
The second parameter is a stability term called the Monin-Obukhov 
length.  As mentioned above, shear stress always dominates near the 
ground.  The height above the ground, where buoyancy effects begin to 
dominate 
(generating 
turbulence 
in 
convective 
conditions 
or 
suppressing turbulence in stable conditions) is called the Monin-
Obukhov length.  This can be thought of as a depth of the neutral (i.e. 
shear-dominated) flow. 
Dispersion Model and Inputs 
6.4.33 
ADMS 5 was used for the modelling of the dispersion being a second 
generation model developed in the UK and accepted by the EA for the 
purposes of EIA (in addition to Environmental Permit applications). 
Building Downwash 
6.4.34 
Building downwash is created by structures in the vicinity of an 
emissions source and subjects the plume from the stack(s) to wake 
effects.  The effect is generally to pull the plume down to the ground at 
locations closer to the stack(s) thereby restricting the dispersion of the 
plume and increasing the ground level concentration of pollutants and, 
potentially, the environmental impact of the Power Generation Plant.   
6.4.35 
All buildings are assumed to be located as in the indicative layouts 
shown in Figure 4.1.  The downwash effects of buildings are 
considered to be potentially significant if they are within a distance from 
the stack(s) equivalent to five times the building height and if the 
building height is greater than 40 per cent of the stack height.  As such, 
any changes to the layout of the above buildings are not likely to

significantly alter the results of the model however the buildings are 
included for completeness.   
Receptors and Additional Model Data 
6.4.36 
The 
ADMS 
model 
calculates 
time 
averaged 
ground 
level 
concentrations over any set of distances from the source.  The study 
used a 20 km by 20 km Cartesian grid with 200 m spacing to predict 
the process contributions to ground level concentrations in the 
immediate vicinity of the proposed stack location.  This grid was 
centred on the proposed centre points of the stacks at approximate grid 
reference SN 937 063.  
6.4.37 
The meteorological data used for this modelling exercise was that from 
the station at Sennybridge (approximate National Grid Reference SN 
89 42); it is considered that this data will be representative of the 
conditions experienced at the Project Site following consultation with 
the Met Office (who supplied the data).  The data period considered 
was 2008-2012 inclusive as per current guidelines for the consideration 
of recent meteorological data over five consecutive years.  For each 
year the predominant wind direction was from the south west. 
6.4.38 
Terrain effects generally occur when ground levels within 1 km of the 
stack vary by more than a third of the stack height.  Given the range of 
stack heights that have been considered as part of the stack height 
sensitivity study and the terrain in the vicinity of Hirwaun, Ordnance 
Survey Landform Panorama DTM terrain data has been included in the 
dispersion modelling exercise.

Fuel-specific Dispersion Model Inputs 
6.4.39 
Modelling will assume that the Power Generation Plant  operates at full 
load for 1500 hours per year i.e. the maximum possible operation of the 
Power Generation Plant. .  Given the proposed ‘peaking’ operating 
regime of the Project, this provides a factor of safety in that all 
combinations of meteorological conditions (e.g. wind direction, speed, 
humidity, ambient temperature, etc.) likely to be experienced at the 
Project Site have been considered. This is because despite the fact 
that the plant will not operate year round, it is not possible to predict 
with certainty when the plant could operate or for how long at any one 
time.  
6.4.40 
All emissions from the combustion of the fuel gases will be discharged 
from the main stack.  Based on the available anticipated emissions 
data, the stack diameter was optimised to ensure that the discharge 
velocity was at least 25 m/s. 
6.4.41 
The dispersion modelling inputs are shown in Tables 6.3 below.

Conversion of Oxides of Nitrogen to Nitrogen Dioxide 
6.4.42 
NOx emissions from the Power Generation Plant will consist of the 
gases NO and NO2.  It is only NO2 that is of concern in terms of direct 
health effects; however NO is a source of NO2 in the atmosphere.  The 
gases are in equilibrium in the air, with NO predominating at the stack 
exit.  The equilibrium changes as the plume disperses and is exposed 
to oxidants, such as atmospheric ozone.  The rate of conversion of NO 
to NO2 increases with rising ozone concentration and wind speed 
(turbulence and mixing effects) whilst the level of solar radiation 
controls the rate of the reverse dissociation reaction of NO2 to NO. 
6.4.43 
For assessing the impacts on air quality of emissions to atmosphere 
from sources, such as power stations, it is important that realistic 
estimates are made of how much NO would be oxidised to NO2 at all 
receptors considered. 
6.4.44 
The rate of oxidation of NO to NO2 depends on both the chemical 
reaction rates and the dispersion of the plume in the atmosphere.  The 
oxidation rate is dependent on a number of factors that include the 
prevailing concentration of ozone, the wind speed and the atmospheric 
stability. 
6.4.45 
Conversion factors are recommended for a screening / worst case 
approach by the EA AQMAU and their “Horizontal Guidance Note H1 – 
Annex (f)” (April 2010).  The guidance states that an initial air quality 
assessment should be undertaken based on 50 per cent conversion of

the 
short-term average 
NOx 
concentrations and 
100 per cent 
conversion of the long-term averages. 
6.4.46 
However, in order to determine the true impact of operation it is 
important that a realistic estimate of the actual process contribution to 
ground level concentrations of NO2 is made. 
6.4.47 
Between 1975 and 1985 about 60 sets of measurements were taken of 
the concentrations of NO and NO2 in plumes from a variety of power 
stations.  These measurements were carried out under widely varying 
weather conditions at altitudes between 200 m and 700 m.  From the 
data collected, an empirical relationship for the percentage oxidation in 
a power station plume based on downwind distance, season of the 
year, wind speed and ambient ozone concentration may be described 
by the following equation (which is sometime referred to as Janssen’s 
equation):

where x is the distance downwind (km) of the emission point and � and 
A are constants dependent on time of year and derived from the 
measurements of wind speed and ozone concentrations.   
6.4.48 
For a typical power station the peak ground level concentration of the 
oxides of nitrogen will occur within a few kilometres.  Table 6.4 shows 
the minimum, maximum and annual average estimates of NO2 in the 
plume for selected distances downwind of the plume, the figure takes 
into account the ratio of NO to NO2 in the plume on exit from the stack 
and assumes that there is sufficient ozone present to achieve 
equilibrium of the conversion reaction, as a worst case.

significant over-estimation of the actual maximum increments to ground 
level concentrations of NO2 as a result of operation of the Power 
Generation Plant.  Therefore the conversion factors from the above 
Table have been applied. 
Stack Height 
6.4.50 
As set out in Section 4 of this PEIR, a stack height sensitivity study 
examined differing stack heights in intervals from 20 m upwards.  The 
stack height sensitivity considered long term and short term 
contributions to ground level concentrations of NO2.   
6.4.51 
The stack height modelling results have been compared against the 
limits prescribed in the AQS Regulations.  The modelling results can be 
considered to be “significant” if the ground level concentrations exceed 
10 per cent of the short term objectives / EAL (up to 24 hour averages) 
and 1 per cent of the long term objectives / EAL (monthly / annual 
results etc.).   
6.4.52 
It is assumed that the plant is operating at full load for 1500 hours per 
annum therefore the worst case scenario has been considered.   
6.4.53 
The stack height study predicted the 19th highest hourly and annual 
NO2 ground level concentrations as a result of the operation of the 
Power Generation Plant.  The 19th highest hourly value is obtained with 
regard to the compliance requirements of EU and UK legislation and 
allows for abnormal weather conditions which may only occur for one 
hour during the year to be disregarded as these weather conditions 
cannot be mitigated for in any significant way. 
Significance Criteria 
Construction / Decommissioning 
6.4.54 
Tables 6.5 to 6.8 outline the matrices defined in the IAQM Guidelines. 
The matrices are used, for construction / decommissioning, as a proxy 
for the "magnitude" of the effect (as per the methodology described in 
Section 6.4). 
6.4.55 
Table 6.9 provides examples for the determination of the sensitivity of a 
receptor. 
6.4.56 
Table 6.10 outlines the significance criteria that have been used to 
assess the significance of potential air quality impacts during 
construction which has been taken from the IAQM Guidance.  The 
significance level is then used as a direct link to the mitigation 
requirements outlined in ‘The control of dust and emissions from

Whilst noting that the stack height sensitivity studies have been 
undertaken in accordance with the significance criteria set out in above, 
more detailed analysis will be undertaken for the resultant impacts as 
the EIA progresses. 
6.4.58 
In terms of NOx, the significance criteria adopted for the operational air 
quality impacts in this assessment have been derived from the criteria 
suggested by Environmental Protection UK in their document 
‘Development Control: Planning for Air Quality’ (2010).   
6.4.59 
Firstly, the magnitude of potential impact is determined via Table 6.11.

The magnitude of the potential impact is then compared against the 
absolute concentration relative to AQS Regulations objective to 
determine the significance via Table 6.12.

6.4.61 
These significance criteria are applied for the purposes of this impact 
assessment.  However, the AQS method does not distinguish between 
processes or the extent of the area of impact.  Therefore it is important 
that the results are interpreted qualitatively as well as quantitatively.

The ‘sensitivity’ for operational effects is the same as the thresholds 
shown in Table 6.9 apply to all receptors.

Baseline Conditions and Receptors 
Study Area 
Construction  
6.6.2 
The IAQM Guidelines state that: “An assessment will normally be 
required where there are sensitive receptors within 350 m of the Project 
Site and / or within 100 m of the route(s) used by construction vehicles 
on the public highway, up to 500 m from the site entrance(s).” 
Air Dispersion Modelling 
6.6.3 
The Study Area for the air quality impact assessment is shown in 
Figure 6.1. This is based on a 20 km by 20 km grid, as explained in 
Section 6.4.  It contains the following receptors: 
� 
The residential settlements nearest to the Project including: 
Hirwaun, Rhigos, Penderyn and Aberdare. These are especially 
relevant as local residences or areas where people are present for 
a large percentage of the time; 
� 
Sensitive ecological receptors within 10 km of the Project Site 
including European and Nationally Designated Sites, shown on 
Figure 6.1; and 
� 
Business / industrial occupiers of the Hirwaun Industrial Estate. 
Baseline Conditions 
6.6.4 
The baseline data is dependent on recent monitoring and other 
currently available information within the Study Area.  The Study Area 
includes land within the jurisdiction of: 
� 
RCTCBC; 
� 
BBNPA;  
� 
Neath Port Talbot County Borough Council; 
� 
Merthr Tydfil County Borough Council; and 
� 
Powys County Council. 
6.6.5 
As discussed in Section 6.1, the pollutants of concern for the Project 
are NOx and CO.  None of the above local authorities operate any 
automated air quality monitors within the Study Area; the closest 
automatic station is operated by RCTCBC at Tylorstown (approximately 
13 km south east of the Project Site).

Table 6.14 shows that there are significant levels of NO2 within 
Aberdare and Ferndale.  Air quality in the remainder of the study area 
is generally very good.   
6.6.8 
RCTCBC published the results of an USA of ambient air quality within 
its jurisdiction in August 2012. The USA report states that: 
“The Local Authority has undertaken regular assessments of local air 
quality in line with its statutory duties.  These continued review and 
assessments, including the 2012 Updating and Screening Assessment 
have identified that the vast majority of Rhondda Cynon Taf observes 
on average good levels of air quality and conforms to health based Air 
Quality Objectives set nationally 
by Regulations.  
However,

comprehensive monitoring and assessment has previously identified 
some areas of Rhondda Cynon Taf as exceeding the AQOs for 
Nitrogen Dioxide [NO2] and has previously led to thirteen Air Quality 
Management Areas being declared.” 
6.6.9 
It is noted that most of the AQMAs referred to above are outside of the 
study area, however the Aberdare Town Centre AQMA and Ferndale 
AQMA fall within the study area.  Both of these sites have been 
designated for continued exceedance of the annual mean objective for 
ground level concentrations of NO2.   
6.6.10 
The Aberdare Town Centre AQMA was declared in 2007, and 
exceedances of the AQS Regulations are considered to as a result of 
high volumes of traffic along roads between High Street and Cardiff 
Street, due to the ‘street canyon effect’
7.   The  ‘Stage 3 Detailed 
Assessment for Nitrogen Dioxide’ (Rhondda Cynon Taf County 
Borough Council, 2007) states: 
“Due to the specific canyon effect and the nature of the NO2 it is highly 
likely that dispersal will occur quickly and the effect on adjoining lightly 
trafficked streets would be minimal.  It is also likely that localised traffic 
management is a significant factor in the breach of the [AQS 
Regulations] for NO2 and therefore the area of the breach will be highly 
localised.” 
6.6.11 
The Ferndale AQMA was declared in 2009 and encompasses 
properties along High Street and Duffryn Street.  The ‘Stage 4 Further 
Assessment of Nitrogen Dioxide’ ((Rhondda Cynon Taf County 
Borough Council, 2009) states: 
“Due to the close proximity of the building facades to the kerb and a 
narrow carriageway the road is characteristic of a street canyon located 
within the Rhondda Fach valley This set of circumstances has created 
a street canyon at the bottom of a very steep sided valley, which often 
suffers from meteorological effects such as temperature inversions. 
Apart from a pelican crossing there are no fixed impediments to traffic. 
However, the commercial area of High St suffers from severe 
congestion due to waiting vehicles restricting an already narrow single 
carriageway.” 
6.6.12 
It is considered that industrial (or other) sources do not significantly 
contribute to the on-going declaration of the above AQMAs. 
                                                   
7
 A street canyon has been defined in paragraph 6.30 of LAQM.TG(03) as “a relatively narrow street with buildings on both 
sides, where the height of the buildings is generally greater than the width of the road”.

6.7 
Preliminary Assessment of Potential Impacts 
Construction / Demolition  
Power Generation Plant  
6.7.2 
During construction / demolition works, the main potential impact on air 
quality will be due to: 
� 
Airborne particulate matter (or dust) emissions from on-site 
activities; and   
� 
Emissions of NOx from traffic movements. 
Airborne Particulate Matter 
6.7.3 
Dust could be emitted during several activities associated with the 
construction / demolition works should preventative measures not be 
taken.  Dust could arise from: earth moving operations for site levelling, 
demolition of existing buildings, back filling and foundations; removal of 
spoil, site stripping, blow-off and spillage from vehicles; concreting 
operations, site reinstatement and road construction and during wind 
blow over bare dry construction areas. 
6.7.4 
Only with high wind speeds would long distance transport of dust and 
the potential for soiling of buildings occur.  In these conditions more 
dust would also be created at source.  The extent of any such 
emissions of dust is very dependent on wind speed, ground conditions, 
the prevalence of hot, dry conditions and the use of preventative 
measures. 
6.7.5 
As per the study area shown in Figure 6.1, there is understood to be 
only one residential property within the zone of influence of dust 
emissions, situated approximately 200m south of the Power Generation 
Plant Site on Rhigos Road.  However, this property is separated from 
the Power Generation Plant Site by the presence of an area of 
woodland which will reduce the overall sensitivity of this receptor to 
wind blown dust, as per the IAQM Guidelines. 
6.7.6 
Aside from this one property, the nearest housing is approximately 600 
m west of the Project boundary at Halt Close (off Rhigos Road).   
6.7.7 
The Power Generation Plant Site forms part of the Hirwaun Industrial 
Estate.  As part of the embedded mitigation measures, which will inform 
the design of the Project and will comprise of best practice working 
arrangements on UK construction sites, HPL will continue to consult 
with the potentially affected neighbours and will require its contractors 
to implement a comprehensive dust suppression / mitigation and

monitoring programme.  This mitigation programme would be detailed 
in a Construction Environmental Management Plan (CEMP) and 
adherence to these best practice working methods would be strictly 
enforced. This will prevent construction / demolition work generating 
levels of atmospheric dust which would constitute a health hazard or 
nuisance to local people or industry. 
Construction Traffic Emissions 
6.7.8 
The impacts of atmospheric emissions from road vehicles upon local 
pollution levels is a function of the number and type of vehicles together 
with the vehicle speed as it passes any particular receptor.  For 
example, local air quality will be degraded more by a vehicle that is 
stationary and idling compared with a vehicle travelling passed a 
receptor at 70 miles per hour (mph). 
6.7.9 
The potential for the significance of atmospheric emissions from 
construction traffic is dependent upon the presence of nearby receptors 
and thus members of the population who may be adversely affected by 
them.  The contribution of vehicle emissions diminishes quickly with 
distance such that their influence on local pollutant concentrations is 
considered not significant at distances greater than 200 m (Design 
Manual for Roads and Bridges (DMRB) Volume 11 Section 3, Part 1: 
Air Quality).  The number of potential receptors within this 200 m zone 
of influence from the proposed routes to the Power Generation Plant 
Site, as can be seen in Figure 1.1, is limited and it is noted that this is a 
generic assumption with the zone of influence likely to be reduced 
following a quantitative analysis of the emissions from road traffic. 
6.7.10 
Emissions levels from construction traffic at any one location will vary 
as different combinations of plant machinery are used, and throughout 
the construction phase of the Project as staffing levels and the 
construction activities / locations change.  A worst case scenario would 
be for any construction traffic to be idling at the boundary of the Project 
Site which, as above, could impact on local air quality. 
Electrical Connection Route Corridor Options (Options 1 and 2) 
6.7.11 
Currently there are two potential options for the Electrical Connection; 
either an overhead line (route corridor option 1) or underground cable 
(route corridor option 2). The construction of the Electrical Connection 
is not anticipated to generate significant dust, plant / machinery or 
traffic emissions due to the small scale of the construction / installation 
works. In the case of route corridor option 1, there will be a minimal 
amount of construction work within the Power Generation Plant Site 
boundary and the impacts would be considered as part of those 
construction works. In the case of route corridor 2, there will be a

minimal amount of excavation / trenching within the Hirwaun Industrial 
Estate and adjacent to the Power Generation Plant boundary. The 
cable would be installed between 1 and 2m below ground and in a 
corridor of no more than 3 m wide. 
6.7.12 
For both potential route corridor options there is the potential for 
generation of dust, however, in reality this can be considered as part of 
the same potential impacts as the construction of the Power Generation 
Plant, given their close proximity and that the same receptors will 
potentially be impacted.  
6.7.13 
Additionally, given that both Electrical Connection route corridor options 
will give rise to minimal construction works and they are in close 
proximity to one another, there are not considered to be differences in 
the potential impacts of the different routes.  
Gas Connection route corridor options 
6.7.14 
Movement of soils from construction activities is anticipated to lead to 
the generation of some short-term airborne soil dust however, at any 
one location, the construction activities will only occur for a short period 
of time as the active working width moves along the gas pipeline route.  
In some locations the impact will be no greater than that experienced 
by existing dust producing agricultural activity and therefore the 
significance can be considered as minor. 
6.7.15 
Emissions will also occur due to the use of diesel powered generators 
for the provision of electricity supplies.  Generators will be required to 
supply a range of essential equipment, including: welding; pumps; 
lights; and, testing equipment.  The generators will be relatively small 
and not generate sufficient emissions to compromise the AQS 
objectives and the impact is therefore predicted to be negligible. 
6.7.16 
Given the similarity of the two gas connection route corridor options, 
there are not considered to be differences in the potential impacts of 
the different routes.  
Operation 
Power Generation Plant  
6.7.17 
To determine the pollutants that should be considered as part of the 
more detailed dispersion modelling exercise, calculations have been 
undertaken using existing guidance based on the anticipated worst 
case emissions rates during normal operation and additional emissions 
parameters.  The results of these calculations showed that the 
emissions of most interest from the new plant are those of NOx.  It

should be noted however, that only a proportion of the NOx released 
will be converted to the more harmful NO2 pollutant.  The principles 
behind the NOx to  NO2 conversion are discussed in more detail in 
Section 6.4. 
6.7.18 
Combustion in gas turbine generators is conducted at high excess air 
rates, typically 200-300 per cent excess air which provides conditions 
as close to complete combustion as possible.  There are, therefore, 
very low levels of carbon monoxide or unburned hydrocarbons present 
in the products of combustion when burning natural gas (as shown in 
Tables 6.3 and 6.4). 
6.7.19 
The combustion of natural gas therefore results in the emission of flue 
gases containing carbon dioxide (CO2), water vapour (H2O), oxygen 
(O2), nitrogen (N2), CO and NOx. 
6.7.20 
A preliminary assessment of the effect of the emissions of CO suggests 
that they are not anticipated to be significant. However these will be 
examined further as part of the on-going EIA. 
Modelling Results 
6.7.21 
A conservative view of the operation of the Power Generation Plant has 
been adopted in the modelling so that a “worst case” is presented.  The 
purpose of using this approach is to ensure that the absolute maximum 
predicted impact within the potential operating regime of the Project is 
considered.   
6.7.22 
Table 6.14 and 6.15 indicates that the process contribution to annual 
average ground level concentrations for five c.59 MW units, the short-
term process contribution will be less than 10 per cent of the relevant 
AQS objective for any stack height considered within the sensitivity 
study.  However, the long-term process contribution would not be less 
than 1 per cent of the AQS objective at a stack height of less than 
25 m. These thresholds are: 
� 
1 per cent of the long-term AQS objective (40 µg/m3); or 
� 
10 per cent of the short-term AQS objective of (200 µg/Nm3),

It should be noted that the above thresholds are not designed to 
determine the acceptability of any process contribution to ground level 
concentrations and is provided for screening purposes only, thus 
determining whether further modelling and assessment is required.  It 
will thus be required to examine the anticipated process contributions 
together with the baseline data presented in Section 6.6.  
6.7.24 
The maximum predicted process contribution to ground level 
concentrations of NO2 indicated in Table 6.16 can be considered as 
extremely small based on the criteria outlined in Table 6.12.  No historic 
hourly data is available for the study area however in order for a 
process contribution of 7.0 ug/m3 to contribute to an exceedance of the 
short-term objective of 200 ug/m3, the ambient concentration would

need to peak at 193 ug/m3 which is considered unlikely based on the 
results of the published LAQM USA and Progress Reports. 
6.7.25 
In addition, the maximum predicted annual average process 
contribution to ground level concentrations of NO2 is <0.6 ug/m3 and 
the magnitude of this impact is, considered small based on the criteria 
outlined in Table 6.12. 
6.7.26 
Therefore, the potential impact on local air quality can considered to be 
of minor significance based on the preliminary assessments 
undertaken to date. 
6.7.27 
It is considered that a stack height of 205 m will provide adequate 
dispersion of the flue gases (irrespective of the type, and associated 
number, of gas turbines generators / stacks).   
Decommissioning 
6.7.28 
During decommissioning, temporary air quality impacts are likely to 
arise.  These will be similar to those described above for construction.   
6.8 
Potential Mitigation / Management Techniques 
Construction / Demolition 
6.8.2 
During construction / demolition, mitigation measures would be covered 
by the Construction Environmental Management Plan (CEMP) that will 
apply to each of the key elements of the Project.  The CEMP will 
incorporate appropriate dust mitigation measures (such as covering 
stockpiles or dowsing with water during dry, windy conditions) that will 
be approved by the relevant authorities and adopted, such that it would 
be unlikely (under most weather conditions) that any dust generated at 
the Project Site has the potential to cause nuisance to any sensitive 
receptors in the area.  The CEMP will be secured by a requirement 
attached to the DCO. 
Operation 
6.8.3 
During operation of the Project, emissions of NOx will be limited to less 
than 50 mg/Nm3 at outputs above 70 per cent load in accordance with 
the IED and the BAT AEL for the firing of natural gas in gas turbines.  
This will be ensured by the use of Dry Low NOx burners (or better).  
This is in accordance with the current EA Sector Guidance Note for 
Combustion and the BREF Notes.

Next Steps 
6.10.1 
Based on the above assessment methodology, significance criteria, 
and the initial modelling results presented in Section 6.5, a full air 
quality impact assessment will be undertaken to determine the likely 
environmental impacts of operation of the Project, both in isolation and 
in conjunction with other significant emissions sources identified 
through consultation with the relevant authorities.  
6.10.2 
The dispersion modelling will consider a study area of up to 20 km by 
20 km centred upon the central point of the proposed stacks (i.e. 10 km 
radius) and will also model all potentially sensitive receptors 
(ecologically designated sites, etc.) discretely in order to accurately 
determine the maximum, worst case impact to air quality due to 
operation of the Project.  The receptors to be considered will be 
supplemented, as appropriate, with any additional receptors highlighted 
through the consultation process. 
6.10.3 
When considering the impacts on ecologically sensitive sites within the 
study area an assessment will also be made of the process 
contributions to nutrient and acid deposition which have the potential to 
degrade the quality of an ecological site. 
6.10.4 
The impact of road traffic generated throughout all Scenarios for the 
development of the Project will be assessed using the methodology 
prescribed in the Depart for Transport “Design Manual for Roads and 
Bridges” for the estimation of emissions from vehicles. 
6.10.5 
The information presented in this Section of the PEIR will be 
supplemented to allow for preparation and finalisation of the ES.

NOISE AND VIBRATION 
7.1 
Introduction 
7.1.1 
During 
construction 
(including 
demolition), 
operation 
and 
decommissioning, all elements of the Project have the potential to 
generate noise and vibration, which may impact on sensitive receptors.  
7.1.2 
This Section presents the current status of the noise and vibration 
assessment for the Project and includes: 
� 
A description of the relevant legislative and policy context in which 
the noise and vibration assessment has been undertaken; 
� 
The existing baseline conditions against which the assessment will 
be made; 
� 
The assessment methodology used including the identification of 
specific sensitive receptors; 
� 
The significance criteria against which the potential impacts of the 
Project have been assessed; 
� 
A preliminary assessment of the potential impacts of the Project 
from noise and vibration;  
� 
Proposals for the mitigation of any anticipated significant 
environmental impacts, as appropriate; 
� 
An assessment of the residual impacts remaining after mitigation; 
and  
� 
An outline of the next steps which need to be undertaken to 
complete the assessment for the ES.  
7.2 
Legislation and Policy Context  
National Policy Statements 
7.2.2 
As explained in Section 2, NPS EN-1 explains the assessment 
principles to which the Secretary of State will have regard in the 
examination of an energy NSIP (such as the proposed Project), and 
explains the generic noise and vibration impacts with regard to energy 
infrastructure.  Specific considerations for fossil fuel generating stations 
are provided in the NPS for Fossil Fuel Generating Infrastructure (EN-
2). The NPSs for Gas and Oil Pipelines (EN-4) and Electricity Networks 
Infrastructure (EN-5) provide specific considerations potentially relevant 
to the Gas Connection and Electrical Connection respectively.  
7.2.3 
NPS EN-1 sets out the requirements for a noise assessment of an 
energy NSIP and also outlines the approach that the Secretary of State

should adopt when considering noise assessments.  Paragraph 5.11.9 
requires the Secretary of State to be satisfied that the proposals will: 
� 
Avoid significant adverse impacts on health and quality of life from 
noise; 
� 
Mitigate and minimise other adverse impacts on health and quality 
of life from noise; and 
� 
Where possible, contribute to improvements to health and quality of 
life through the effective management and control of noise. 
7.2.4 
NPS EN-2 sets out assessment principles in respect of fossil fuel 
energy generation NSIPs. It states that the Secretary of State must be 
satisfied that the principles set out at paragraph 5.11.9 of NPS EN-1 
have been satisfied and notes that mitigation for noise for such 
proposals is likely to be primarily through good design (i.e. enclosures, 
exhaust attenuation to turbines) and refers to the use of requirements 
attached to the DCO to secure relevant mitigation.   
Other National and Local Policy 
7.2.5 
Whilst the PA 2008 is clear as to the primacy of the relevant NPS, other 
national and local planning policy can be considered important and 
relevant by the Secretary of State in the determination of an energy 
NSIP. 
7.2.1 
As described in Section 2 of the PEIR, PPW sets out the land use 
planning policies of the WG and is supplemented by a series of 
Technical advice Notes (TANs). TANs prescribe the government’s 
policies on various planning issues that shape the preparation of 
development plans. The principles and objectives of TANs prescribe 
the overarching national guidance for specific individual environmental 
topics. 
7.2.2 
TAN 11 provides advice on how the planning system can be used to 
minimise the adverse impact of noise without placing unreasonable 
restrictions on development or adding unduly to the costs and 
administrative burdens of business. It outlines some of the main 
considerations which LPAs should take into account determining 
planning applications for development which will either generate noise 
or be exposed to existing noise sources. 
7.2.3 
The Rhondda Cynon Taf Local Development Plan 2006-2021 was 
adopted in 2011. Policy AW10 of the Local Development Plan covers 
Environmental protection and Public Health and states the following: 
“Development proposals will not be permitted where they would cause 
or result in a risk of unacceptable harm to health and / or local amenity

because of: noise pollution........... unless it can be demonstrated that 
measures can be taken to overcome any significant adverse risk to 
public health, the environment and / or impact upon local amenity. 
Standards and Guidance 
7.2.4 
British Standard (BS) 7445 'Description and Measurement of 
Environmental Noise' defines and prescribes best practice during 
recording and reporting of environmental noise.  This standard should 
be applied in all instances when making environmental noise 
measurements. 
7.2.5 
BS 4142 ‘Method for rating industrial noise affecting mixed residential 
and industrial areas' offers guidance on the assessment of industrial 
and commercial noise affecting residential and industrial areas.  It 
describes a method for assessing whether industrial noise is likely to 
result in complaints from nearby residents. 
7.2.6 
Environment Agency Horizontal Guidance H3 Part 2: Noise 
assessment and control. 
This document provides the principles of 
noise measurement and prediction and control of noise by design, by 
operational management techniques and abatement technologies. 
Horizontal guidance provides information relevant to all sectors 
regulated under the Environmental Permitting Regulations (EPR).   
7.2.7 
World Health Organisation (WHO) Guidelines for Community Noise - 
 This document provides advice and guideline values for noise in 
specific environments.   
7.2.8 
BS 5228 'Noise and vibration control on construction and open sites' 
gives recommendations for basic methods of noise and vibration 
control relating to construction sites and other open sites where 
construction activities are carried out.  It offers a methodology for 
predicting noise levels from construction sites and assessing its impact 
on those exposed to it. BS5228 is the industry approved code of 
practise and should be used in all cases when assessing noise from 
construction sites. 
7.2.9 
BS 6472 (2008) ‘Guide to Evaluation of Human Exposure to Vibration 
in Buildings (1 Hertz (Hz) to 80 Hz)’ presents recommended frequency 
weighted vibration spectra (for continuous vibration) and Vibration Dose 
Values (VDV) (for intermittent vibration), above which adverse 
comment is likely to occur in residential properties. 
7.2.10 
BS 7385 (1993) ‘Evaluation and Measurement for Vibration in 
Buildings’ presents guide values or limits for transient vibration, above 
which there is a likelihood of cosmetic damage.

7.3 
Realistic Worst Case Scenario for Assessment 
7.3.1 
In respect of noise and vibration, the realistic worst case scenario from 
within the proposed Project parameters (which are described in Section 
4 of this PEIR) is set out in Table 7.1 below.    
7.3.2 
The reason that the parameters identified in Table 7.1 represent the 
realistic worst case in relation to noise and vibration impacts are that an 
increasing number of separate SCGT units, each with their own 
dedicated stack will produce increasingly more noise. Noise from the 
gas turbine generator units is attenuated by the turbine casing, and so 
varies little with higher power output turbines. The main variable noise 
producing element is exhaust noise through the top of the stack. The 
stack sound power level for a typical c60MW SCGT unit is 110dB(A), 
compared to a single 100MW unit, which can have a typical sound 
power level of around 113dB(A). Therefore, the noise output from five 
separate low power SCGT units will be higher than that produced by 
one or two high power units. Similarly, the construction of five separate 
SCGT units will result in a longer construction lead time, which will 
increase the noise impact at sensitive receptors. This applies 
regardless of whether we are assessing aero-derivative or industrial 
units. 
7.3.3 
A preliminary assessment of both options for the Gas Connection and 
the Electrical Connection is presented in this section. A decision on the 
preferred option for each will be taken following consultation.

Assessment Methodology and Significance Criteria 
7.4.1 
This preliminary noise and vibration assessment focuses on seven 
noise sensitive receptor (NSR) locations. The existing baseline 
conditions at each NSR have been determined by way of an attended 
noise survey.  Discussions were held with RCTCBC to agree a study 
area, a noise survey methodology, and suitable locations for the NSR 
measurement positions.

7.4.2 
A prediction of the impact during construction / demolition is undertaken 
following the methodology of BS 5228, and information regarding the 
noise output of specific items of plant contained therein.   
7.4.3 
The noise impacts during operation are predicted using CadnaA noise 
propagation modelling software, using typical values for the proposed 
plant items, and considering directional and screening effects.   
7.4.4 
The significance of the predicted operational impact is assessed 
against the semantics of BS 4142.  
Construction (including demolition) / Decommissioning  
7.4.4.1 
The noise impacts of decommissioning will be similar to those that will 
be assessed for construction. The assessment will therefore be carried 
out on the same basis as that for those arising from construction 
activities. 
7.4.5 
Table 7.2 sets out the construction noise significance threshold taken 
from BS 5228:2009 for day, night, evening and weekend periods.

The levels are façade value LAeqs (and include noise from other 
sources).  There are various indices for expressing the noise levels 
produced by working sites.  However, the LAeq index is regarded as 
standard and has been used in this assessment. LAeq is the equivalent 
continuous sound level expressed in “A weighted” decibel terms and is, 
in general, used as a description of environmental noise.  It represents

the steady sound level, which would produce the same energy as a 
fluctuating sound, over the same period of time.   
7.4.7 
Vibration from construction / demolition activities may impact on 
adjacent buildings.  The criteria used in this assessment relate to the 
potential for cosmetic damage, not structural damage.  The principal 
concern is generally transient vibration due to impact piling.  Cosmetic 
damage is most likely to occur within the first 20 m of piling activities; 
damage is less likely to occur at greater distance.  Likely levels of 
vibration at given distances can be predicted from existing piling 
vibration data. 
7.4.8 
BS7385 establishes the basic principles for carrying out vibration 
measurements and processing the data with regard to evaluating 
vibration impacts on buildings.  Table 7.3 provides recommended peak 
particle velocity (PPV) vibration limits for transient excitation for 
different types of buildings (as set out in BS7385: Part 2, 1993).

Significance criteria for construction noise and vibration have been 
derived from BS 5228, and BS 7385.  An adapted scale for the 
description of the significance of construction noise is shown in 
Table 7.4.

Operation 
7.4.11 
BS 4142 provides a methodology for the assessment of industrial noise 
in mixed residential and industrial areas.  In this case, the standard 
suggests obtaining an assessment level by comparing the existing 
background noise levels with the 'rating level', which is the predicted 
noise output of the Power Generation Plant, corrected to account for 
any acoustic features such as tonal or impulsive noises.  The 
semantics used for assessing the likelihood of complaints due to the 
introduction of a new industrial noise source are as follows: 
� 
When subtracting the background level from the rating level, the 
greater the difference, the greater the likelihood of complaints. 
� 
A difference of around +10 dB or more indicates that complaints 
are likely. 
� 
A difference of around +5 dB is of marginal significance.

� 
If the rating level is more than 10 dB below the measured 
background noise level then this is a positive indication that 
complaints are unlikely.

Therefore the significance criteria presented in Table 7.5 has been 
adopted for the purposes of the assessment of operational noise from

It is noted here that the operation of the Gas Connection and Electrical 
Connection could also give rise to noise impacts. The gas AGI will be 
constantly operational and will give rise to a relatively small amount of 
noise similar to a low hum. Additionally, if an overhead line is chosen 
as the preferred Electrical Connection, overhead lines can sometimes 
be associated with a ‘hum’ which is noticeable when in very close 
proximity to them. Neither the gas pipeline nor an underground 
electrical connection would give rise to any noticeable noise during

conducive to successful monitoring with wind speeds less than 5 m/s.  
Roads were dry, and there was no precipitation at the time of 
measurement.  The measurement microphones were positioned in free 
field at 1.4 m above ground level and well away from any vertical 
reflective facades.  A wind-shield was used to minimise the effects of 
wind noise.  The ambient temperature was between 13°C and 21°C 
during the monitoring period.  
7.6.6 
Each measurement recorded the same five statistical parameters 
(L90,Leq,  Lmax,  L10,  Lmin.) in unweighted third octave bands, with the 
overall figure reported using the A-weighed frequency network. 
7.6.7 
All monitoring was conducted using Class 1 Sound Level Meters.  A 
field calibrator was used to calibrate and check the meter before and 
after the measurement period with no change in level recorded.   
7.6.8 
To provide a worst case background noise level to assess against the 
lowest LA90 from either the daytime or night time measurements at each 
NSR have been used.

7.7 
Preliminary Assessment of Potential Impacts 
Construction (including demolition) 
Power Generation Plant  
7.7.2 
Construction and demolition activity inevitably leads to some degree of 
noise disturbance at locations in close proximity to these activities.  It is 
however a temporary source of noise.  The noise levels generated by 
construction and demolition activities would have the potential to impact 
upon nearby noise sensitive receptors.  Noise levels at any one 
location will vary as different combinations of plant machinery are used 
and throughout construction and demolition activities and as specific 
locations of these activities locations change.   
7.7.3 
The likely construction / demolition noise levels have been predicted 
using the methodology set out in BS 5228 in conjunction with general 
information regarding proposed activities. 
7.7.4 
The noise assessment procedure, as set out in BS5228 is described 
below: 
� 
Stage 1. Obtain an activity LAeq by direct measurement of similar 
plant in the same mode of operation, or use the indicative plant 
noise sound pressure values provided in Annexes C and D of BS 
5228, these values have been measured at a distance of 10m. 
� 
Stage 2. If the distance R, in metres(m) from the point of interest 
to the geometric centre of the plant or activity is other than 10m 
subtract from the LAeq obtained in stage 1 using the following 
equation:  
�� = �� � 20������
�
10 
7.7.5 
Where:  
� 
L1 = Measured plant noise level at 10m distance 
� 
L2 = Predicted plant noise level at assessment location (NSR) 
� 
R = Distance between geometrical centre of noise source and 
assessment location (NSR) 
7.7.6 
The equation identified in stage 2 of the BS5228 noise assessment 
method has been used to calculate each separate identified plant noise 
source. This method predicts the total potential sound pressure level at 
each NSR as a result of construction activities. Each plant noise source 
has been calculated as being the shortest distance between the Project 
Site and each NSR.

Table 7.8 presents the noise levels associated with typical construction 
activities, and predicts the likely noise level contributed by each item of 
plant at each NSR.  The estimated sound pressure levels shown are 
worst-case estimates based on distance attenuation only.  
Distance Attenuation - Discussion 
7.7.8 
Distance attenuation is the term used to describe the reduction of 
sound energy in a sound wave as it travels through a medium. When a 
sound wave travels through air its intensity diminishes due to air 
pressure (absorption) and scattering. Absorption is the conversion of 
the sound energy to other forms of energy. Scattering is the reflection 
of the sound in directions other than its original direction of 
propagation.  The combined effect of absorption and scattering over 
distance is referred to as distance attenuation.  
7.7.9 
To address the changing nature of construction and demolition noise 
sources, such as different plant items being used at different times, a 
detailed construction program is needed to identify each construction 
phase. In the absence of a detailed construction program this 
assessment has been based upon all identified plant items being used 
simultaneously.  It is noted that in reality this scenario is extremely 
unlikely to occur and hence predicted noise levels are considered worst 
case.

Table 7.8 provides a construction noise prediction for the construction /

level is below the daytime limit of 65 dB(A) at all receptors. Therefore, 
based on this conservative, worst case assessment, the significance of 
the overall impact of construction noise during core hours is predicted 
to be minor at all NSR locations. 
Electrical Connection Route Corridor (Options 1 and 2) 
7.7.11 
Currently there are two potential options for the Electrical Connection, 
either an overhead line (route corridor option 1) or underground cable 
(route corridor option 2). The construction of the Electrical Connection 
is not anticipated to generate significant noise from plant / machinery or 
traffic due to the small scale of the construction / installation works. In 
the case of route corridor option 1, there will be a minimal amount of 
construction work within the Power Generation Plant Site boundary and 
the impacts would be considered as part of those construction works. In 
the case of route corridor 2, there will be a minimal amount of 
excavation / trenching within the Hirwaun Industrial Estate and adjacent 
to the Power Generation Plant Site. The cable would be installed 
around 1 m below ground and in a corridor of no more than 3 m wide. 
7.7.12 
For both potential route corridor options there is the potential for 
generation of noise during construction, however, in reality this can be 
considered as part of the same potential impacts as the construction of 
the Power Generation Plant, given their close proximity and that the 
same receptors will potentially be impacted.  
7.7.13 
Additionally, given that both Electrical Connection route corridor options 
will give rise to minimal construction works and they are in close 
proximity to one another, there are not considered to be differences in 
the potential impacts of the different routes.  
Gas Connection Route Corridor options 
7.7.14 
Construction of the Gas Connection is expected to lead to the 
generation of some short-term construction noise, primarily from the 
excavation of the trench in which the pipeline will sit.  However, at any 
one location, the construction activities will only occur for a short period 
of time as the active working width moves along the gas pipeline route.  
In some locations the impact will be no greater than that experienced 
currently with the movement of agricultural machinery. Therefore a 
preliminary assessment of the significance of noise impacts can be 
considered as minor. 
7.7.15 
Given the similarity of the two gas connection route corridor options, 
there are not considered to be differences in the potential impacts of 
the different routes.

Operation 
Power Generation Plant 
7.7.16 
The computer noise modelling software CadnaA (Version 4.1), which 
uses the ISO 9613 propagation algorithms has been used to undertake 
a provisional noise calculation.  The model estimates the contribution to 
noise levels at each NSR location, and has been created using a 
representative sound power level for the whole Power Generation 
Plant. 
7.7.17 
The model is intended to provide an indicative assessment only for the 
operational phase of the Power Generation Plant. The detailed 
operational noise modelling will be undertaken as part of the EIA, when 
full details of all plant items will be available.  
7.7.18 
As part of the detailed modelling to follow in the full EIA, a number of 
assumptions with regards to the noise control will be included on major 
plant items, as embedded mitigation. These are stated below. 
� 
The gas turbine generators and major compressors are to be 
housed in individual acoustic enclosures specified at 85 dB(A) 
Sound Pressure Level at 1 m.   
� 
Turbine filter and ventilation apertures are to be fitted with high 
performance silencers, and designed such that all sensitive 
receptors benefit from screening and/or directivity corrections. 
� 
High performance silencers will be installed in the outlet duct(s) 
between the gas turbine generators. Due to the impracticality of 
screening stack noise, discharge noise will be controlled using 
these silencers that will be tuned to attenuate low frequencies from 
the gas turbine generator exhausts. 
� 
Unit transformers and generator transformers will be housed in an 
appropriate enclosure or three sided pen, to provide full screening 
to NSRs. 
� 
All plant items shall be controlled to minimise noise of an impulsive 
or tonal nature, such that the rating level as defined in BS 4142 is 
equal to the specific noise level. 
7.7.19 
Table 7.9 presents a summary the predicted noise levels, from the 
Power Generation Plant, at each of the NSR locations.  The measured 
background noise levels (LA90) are also shown and compared to the 
BS 4142 rating level. 
7.7.20 
As part of the operational noise assessment any noise sources that are 
considered to contain acoustic features, such as being tonal, impulsive

or intermittent in nature should carry a 5 point penalty. If considered 
appropriate the 5 point penalty is added to the predicted plant noise 
LAeq to give the ‘rating level’, (as defined is BS 4142). However, the 
Power Generation Plant is intended to be used as a peaking plant. As 
such the operational noise from the plant will be inherently intermittent 
in nature, so the 5 point acoustic feature penalty has been duly applied.

Figure 7.1 shows a predicted noise contour that shows the predicted 
spread of noise levels surrounding the Project. It is noted these results 
should be considered as preliminary only, and are subject to change 
when the detailed acoustic modelling for the EIA is complete. However, 
it is considered that any change will not be significant.  
7.7.22 
Table 7.9 shows that at locations 3, 4, 5 and 6 the predicted noise 
levels from the proposed plant are minor adverse whilst at locations 1 
and 2 predicted noise levels are major adverse 
Gas Connection (Options 1 and 2) 
7.7.23 
During operation, there will be small amounts of noise generated by the 
gas AGI. This may be a low ‘hum’ noise or ‘hiss’ type of noise as the 
AGI regulates the flow of gas from the NTS to the Power Generation 
Plant.  
7.7.24 
This noise is rarely perceptible except when in very close proximity to 
the AGI. Given that there are no residential properties in close proximity 
to the proposed location for the AGI, an initial assessment is that the 
operational noise from the AGI would be negligible.  
Electrical Connection (Option 1) 
 
 
 
Hirwaun Power Project Preliminary

7.7.25 
Should an overhead electrical connection be selected (i.e. electrical 
connection route corridor option 1) then it is possible that it will produce 
a low ‘hum’ during operation caused by the flow of electricity through 
the line. However, this noise is usually imperceptible except when 
directly under the line. Additionally, the Electrical Connection would be 
very short and not in close proximity to residential properties. An initial 
assessment is therefore that the operational noise from the Electrical 
Connection would be negligible. 
Electrical Connection (Option 2) 
7.7.26 
Electrical Connection route corridor option 2 will be a buried 
underground cable. It will therefore produce no perceptible operational 
noise.  
Operational Vibration 
7.7.27 
It is predicted that vibration sources will include the following: 
� 
Balanced rotating equipment, such as turbines; 
� 
Wind induced vibrations in the stacks, to be transmitted to the 
foundations. 
7.7.28 
With the distances involved between the Project Site and NSR’s it is 
anticipated that the level of induced vibration will be imperceptible at 
the nearest sensitive receptor.  Operational vibration impacts are thus 
not assessed further. 
Decommissioning 
7.7.29 
During decommissioning, similar impacts to those described for 
construction could result from e.g. plant removal or site reinstatement. 
However, it is likely that these impacts would be less, given that some 
items would be left in situ (e.g. gas pipeline, electrical cable and buried 
foundations of the Power Generation Plant). Therefore, based on the 
very conservative and worst case construction impacts outlined above, 
a 
preliminary 
assessment 
is 
that 
the 
noise 
impacts 
from 
decommissioning all elements of the Project will not be significant.    
7.8 
Potential Mitigation / Management Techniques 
Construction / Demolition 
7.8.2 
In order to keep noise impacts from the construction / demolition phase 
to a minimum, all construction activities relating to the Power 
Generation Plant, Gas Connection and Electrical Connection would be 
carried out in accordance with the recommendations of BS 5228.  In

addition, HPL will require its appointed contractor to minimise the 
impact of construction activities through successful implementation of 
an agreed CEMP and proper communication with local residents. 
7.8.3 
Core working hours will be agreed with RCTCBC, and are specific to 
the construction site.  For power station construction sites, these are 
generally Monday to Saturday between: 0700hrs – 1900hrs.  Should it 
be necessary to work outside these core hours for certain activities this 
would be with the prior written agreement of RCTCBC. 
7.8.4 
Specific method statements and risk assessments would be required 
for all working.  In order to minimise the likelihood of noise complaints 
out of typical construction hours, the contractor would be required to 
inform and agree the works in advance with RCTCBC whilst advising 
potentially affected residents of the works to be carried out outside 
normal hours.  Furthermore, the residents would be provided with a 
point of contact for any queries or complaints. 
7.8.5 
All vehicles and mechanical plant used for construction would be fitted 
with effective exhaust silencers, and regularly maintained. 
7.8.6 
Inherently quiet plant would be used where appropriate.  All major 
compressors would be sound-reduced models fitted with properly lined 
and sealed acoustic covers which would be kept closed whenever the 
machines are in use and all ancillary pneumatic percussive tools would 
be fitted with mufflers or silencers of the type recommended by the 
manufacturers. 
7.8.7 
All ancillary plant such as generators, compressors and pumps would 
be positioned so as to cause minimum noise disturbance.  If necessary, 
temporary acoustic barriers or enclosures would be provided. 
Operation 
7.8.8 
While planning noise limits will be agreed with RCTCBC, HPL will aim 
to reduce noise emissions as far as practicable.  The following 
measures would serve to continually monitor and minimise the impact 
of noise from the Project. 
7.8.9 
Detailed design will ensure that noise is mitigated as far as possible, 
through the Project Site layout and consideration of the orientation of 
plant items associated with higher sound power levels. 
7.8.10 
A programme of continual noise monitoring, including a noise survey 
shortly following the commissioning of the new plant, shall be agreed 
with RCTCBC and implemented at regular intervals.  The aim of these 
surveys shall be to ensure that plant noise levels as measured at the

agreed NSR locations do not exceed the planning noise limits; noise 
monitoring shall be undertaken in accordance with BS 4142. 
7.8.11 
Inherently quiet plant items will be selected wherever practicable.  In 
addition to the noise control measures mentioned above high 
performance silencers will be fitted to achieve maximum noise 
attenuation on plant including gas turbine inlets and ductwork.  Acoustic 
lagging and low noise trims will be fitted to all pipe-work and noise 
generating steam valves. 
7.8.12 
High performance acoustic enclosures will be considered for all plant 
items where practicable, not overlooking smaller plant items such as 
compressors and pumps. 
7.8.13 
In the interest of maintaining neighbourly relations and residential 
amenity, HPL will give a reasonable period of notice to residents prior 
to any non-normal operations that would lead to an increase in noise 
levels.  These would be carried out between 0900 – 1700 hours during 
weekdays, wherever possible. 
7.8.14 
If any abnormal  operations occur which lead to noise levels in excess 
of the agreed planning limits (e.g. any equipment malfunction), the 
operator will inform the local authority andresidents of the reasons for 
these operations, and the anticipated emergency period. 
7.8.15 
During decommissioning, similar mitigation measures to those 
described above for construction will be implemented.

ECOLOGY 
8.1 
Introduction 
8.1.1 
The 
construction 
(including 
demolition), 
operation 
and 
decommissioning of the proposed Project has the potential to impact on 
the local ecology and biodiversity of the Hirwaun Industrial Estate and 
its environs through the loss or degradation of habitats and the 
disturbance of protected or notable species.  These potential impacts 
will therefore be assessed within the EIA.  
8.1.2 
Construction / demolition and decommissioning works associated with 
the Project have the potential to displace on-site habitats and species 
that are supported within the Project Site and adjacent areas. 
8.1.3 
During operation the emissions to air from the Project could impact on 
the air quality of ecologically sensitive sites via an increase in the 
ground level concentrations of certain pollutants and the associated 
nutrient and acid deposition.  
8.1.4 
This section of the PEIR summarises the findings of the Phase 1 
habitat surveys that have been undertaken since publication of the 
Project Environmental Impact Assessment Scoping Report and 
provides up to date information relating to the species specific Phase 2 
surveys that are ongoing. 
8.2 
Legislative and Policy Context 
8.2.1 
Relevant wildlife and countryside legislation have been used along with 
planning policy guidance and local and national Biodiversity Action 
Plans (BAP) to inform this assessment.   
8.2.2 
The key articles of relevance are: 
� 
Council Directive 92/43/EEC on the Conservation of Natural 
Habitats and Wild Fauna and Flora (Habitats Directive); 
�

Legislation 
Habitats Directive 
8.2.3 
In 1992 the then European Community adopted Council Directive 
92/43/EEC on the conservation of natural habitats and of wild fauna 
and flora, known as the Habitats Directive. The main aim of the EC 
Habitats Directive is to promote the maintenance of biodiversity by 
requiring member states to introduce protection for these habitats and 
species of European importance. The mechanism for protection is 
through designation of Special Areas of Conservation (SACs), both for 
habitats and for certain species listed within Annex II, and through 
specific protection of certain species. 
Birds Directive 
8.2.4 
EC Council Directive 79/409/EEC on the Conservation of Wild Birds 
(the Birds Directive) provides a framework for the conservation and 
management of wild birds in Europe.  In this regard, Annex I of the 
Directive lists habitat types to be protected, and Annex II specifies 
conditions under which hunting can be undertaken.  The Directive 
additionally provides for the identification and classification of Special 
Protection Areas (SPAs) for rare or vulnerable species listed in Annex I, 
and for regularly occurring migratory species. . 
Bern Convention 
8.2.5 
The Convention on the Conservation of European Wildlife and Natural 
Habitats (the Bern Convention) came into force in 1982. The principal 
aims of the Convention are to ensure conservation and protection of 
wild plant and animal species and their natural habitats (listed in

Appendices I and II of the Convention), to increase cooperation 
between contracting parties, and to regulate the exploitation of species 
(including migratory species). 
Wildlife and Countryside Act 1981 (as amended) 
8.2.6 
The Wildlife and Countryside Act 1981 (as amended) is the principal 
mechanism for the legislative protection of wildlife in Great Britain. 
However it does not extend to Northern Ireland, the Channel Islands or 
the Isle of Man. This legislation is the means by which the Bern 
Convention and (partially) the Birds Directive and Habitats Directive are 
implemented in the UK. 
Conservation of Habitats and Species Regulations 2010 
8.2.7 
In the UK, the Habitats Directive was originally transposed into law by 
means of the Conservation (Natural Habitats, & c.) Regulations 1994 
(as amended). The Regulations came into force on 30 October 1994, 
and have been amended several times. Subsequently the Conservation 
of Habitats and Species Regulations 2010 was created which 
consolidates all the various amendments made to the 1994 Regulations 
in respect of England and Wales and is commonly known as the 'The 
Habitats Regulations'. The Regulations contain five Parts and four 
Schedules, and provide for the designation and protection of 'European 
sites', the protection of 'European protected species', and the 
adaptation of planning and other controls for the protection of European 
Sites.  This legislation is the principle means by which the Habitats 
Directive and Birds Directive are implemented in the UK. 
Natural Environment and Rural Communities Act 2006 
8.2.8 
The Natural Environment and Rural Communities Act (NERC Act) 
provides that any public body or statutory undertaker in England and 
Wales must have regard to the purpose of conservation of biological 
diversity in the exercise of their functions.  The intention is to help 
ensure that biodiversity becomes an integral consideration in the 
development of policies and plans.   
 
The Protection of Badgers Act 1992 
8.2.9 
The Protection of Badgers Act 1992 makes it an offence to wilfully take, 
kill, injure or ill-treat a badger, or posses a dead badger or any part of a 
badger.  Under the Act their setts are also protected against 
obstruction, destruction, or damage in any part.  
8.2.10 
 Sett interference includes damaging or destroying a sett, obstructing 
access to a sett, and disturbing a badger whilst it is occupying a sett.

The Act defines a badger sett as ‘any structure or place, which displays 
signs indicating the current use by a badger’  
8.2.11 
 Work that may disturb badgers or their setts is illegal without a 
development licence from the relevant statutory body (i.e. Natural 
Resources Wales (NRW) in Wales).  As a precautionary principle, a 
buffer distance between a badger sett and the works will be 
determined, based upon guidance from an appropriately experienced 
ecologist.  This buffer distance should be based upon the size and 
activity levels at the sett, the topography between the sett and the 
works and the nature of the works.   
8.2.12 
The Hedgerow Regulations (1997) 
8.2.13 
 The Hedgerows Regulations (1997) make provision for the protection 
of important hedgerows in England and Wales.  The regulations affect 
hedgerows which are 20m or more in length, or connected at both ends 
to another hedgerow of any length.  
8.2.14 
 They relate to hedgerows which are on, or adjoining land used for the 
following purposes: agriculture or forestry; the breeding or keeping of 
horses, ponies or donkeys; common land; village greens; Sites of 
Special Scientific Interest (which include all terrestrial SACs, NNRs, 
and SPAs) and Local Nature Reserves.  They do not include hedges 
that are attached to, or marking the boundaries of a private house. 
8.2.15 
 It is an offence to intentionally or recklessly remove or cause or permit 
another person to remove a hedgerow or intentionally or recklessly 
remove, or cause or permit another person to remove, a hedgerow 
which is the subject of a hedgerow retention notice.   
8.2.16 
National Policy Statements 
8.2.17 
As explained in Section 2, the NPS EN-1 explains the assessment 
principles to which the SoS will have regard in the examination of an 
energy NSIP (such as the proposed Project), and explains the generic 
biodiversity impacts with regard to energy infrastructure.  Specific 
considerations for fossil fuel generating stations are provided in the 
NPS for Fossil Fuel Generating Infrastructure (EN-2). The NPSs for 
Gas and Oil Pipelines (EN-4) and Electricity Networks Infrastructure 
(EN-5) provide specific considerations potentially relevant to the Gas 
Connection and Electrical Connection Compound and Electrical 
Connection respectively. 
8.2.18 
Section 4.3 refers to the Conservation of Habitats and Species 
Regulations 2010 and the requirement to consider whether a project is

likely to have a significant effect on a European site either alone or in 
combination with other plans or projects. 
8.2.19 
Paragraph 5.3.7 states “As a general principle, and subject to the 
specific policies below, development should aim to avoid significant 
harm to biodiversity and geological conservation interests, including 
through mitigation and consideration of reasonable alternatives; where 
significant harm cannot be avoided, then appropriate compensation 
measures should be sought.” Paragraph 5.3.8 continues “In taking 
decisions, the [SoS] should ensure that appropriate weight is attached 
to designated sites of international, national and local importance; 
protected species; habitats and other species of principal importance 
for the conservation of biodiversity; and to biodiversity and geological 
interests within the wider environment.” 
8.2.20 
NPS EN-1 goes on to explain the weight to be attached to particular 
designations and notes for example that (paragraph 5.3.13) “The IPC 
[Secretary of State] should give due consideration to such regional or 
local designations. However, given the need for new infrastructure, 
these designations should not be used in themselves to refuse 
development consent.” 
8.2.21 
Paragraph 5.3.15 encourages the provision of biodiversity opportunities 
within developments. 
8.2.22 
Paragraph 5.3.18 seeks that the applicant demonstrates that 
appropriate and practicable mitigation measures are incorporated into 
the proposed development. Where this is not demonstrated, the 
examining authority and the Secretary of State “should consider what 
appropriate requirements should be attached to any consent and/or 
planning obligations entered into”.  
8.2.23 
The National Policy Statement for Fossil Fuel Electricity Generating 
Infrastructure (EN-2) does not set out specific assessment principles in 
respect of biodiversity for fossil fuel generating stations, except for the 
potential for aquatic ecology effects in respect of cooling water intake 
and exhaust, which is not relevant to the proposed Project due to the 
proposed use of SCGT technology with a low cooling water 
requirement which is likely to be supplied by tankering.  
8.2.24 
The National Policy Statement for Gas Supply Infrastructure and Gas 
and Oil Pipelines (NPS EN-4) notes the relevance of biodiversity in 
respect of the route of gas pipelines in respect of construction phase 
impacts and the potential constraint to planting near the route in future, 
and refers back to the assessment principles contained in NPS EN-1.

8.2.25 
The National Policy Statement for Electricity Networks Infrastructure 
(NPS EN-5) refers back to the assessment principles contained in NPS 
EN-1 and notes the potential impacts on birds from overhead lines. 
However as the Electricity Connection is to be an underground cable 
this is not of relevance to the proposed Project.  
Other National and Local Policy 
Planning Policy Guidance 
8.2.26 
Chapter 5 of Planning Policy Wales (2012) sets out the Welsh 
Governments overarching advice on the conservation of biodiversity 
and the coast in a planning context.  The Policy Statement sets out 
objectives for conservation that should be delivered via the planning 
process.  It includes guidance on integrating the requirements of 
development and conservation, and highlights existing measures for 
biodiversity conservation (legislation and policy) in Wales.  The 
Statement also sets out how development plans should take account of 
natural heritage conservation when being devised and implemented. 
8.2.27 
Technical Advice Note 5 of the National Assembly of Wales Planning 
Division refers to Nature Conservation and Planning TAN 5 (2009).  
TAN 5 is concerned with the protection of statutorily designated site 
and habitats, the conservation of protected and priority species and 
protecting and enhancing biodiversity and nature conservation in the 
wider countryside within Wales.    
The UK Biodiversity Action Plan (UK BAP)  
8.2.28 
 The UK Biodiversity Action Plan (UK BAP) was originally published in 
1994, and was the UK Government’s response to the Convention on 
Biological Diversity (CBD), which the UK signed up to in 1992 in Rio de 
Janeiro. The UK was the first country to produce a national biodiversity 
action plan, and the UK BAP described the biological resources of the 
UK and provided detailed plans for conservation of these resources. 
Action plans for the most threatened species and habitats were set out 
to aid recovery, and national reports, produced every three- to five-
years, show how the UK BAP is contributing to the UK’s progress 
towards the significant reduction of biodiversity loss called for by the 
CBD.   
 Rhondda Cynon Taf Local Biodiversity Action Plan (LBAP)   
8.2.29 
 RCTCBC published their Local Biodiversity Action Plan (LBAP) in 
October 2000, following an 18 month period of development involving 
an extensive partnership. Part One of the Plan includes actions to; 
raise awareness of wildlife and its importance in Rhondda Cynon Taff;

record and monitor wildlife; protect sites of wildlife value; and manage 
land and buildings for wildlife. Part two of the plan details a summary of 
the specific species and habitats within the Borough which require 
protection, and their current action plans. 
8.3 
Realistic Worst Case Scenario for Assessment 
8.3.1 
In respect of ecology, the realistic worst case scenario from within the 
proposed Project parameters (which are described in Section 4 of the 
PEIR) are set out in Table 8.1 below.    
8.3.2 
The reason that the parameters identified in Table 8.1 represent the 
realistic worst case in relation to ecological impacts are primarily 
because 5 smaller stacks will have a potentially greater impact on air 
quality (and 
therefore 
sensitive ecological receptors). Further 
discussion is provided in Section 6.3 of this PEIR. 
8.3.3 
 A preliminary assessment of both options for the Gas Connection and 
the Electrical Connection is presented in this section. A decision on the 
preferred option for each will be taken following consultation.

Assessment Methodology and Significance Criteria 
8.4.1 
The ecological features of the Project Site are being evaluated in 
accordance with guidelines provided within IEEM
8  “Guidelines for 
Ecological Impact Assessment” (2006).  This involves five key stages: 
� 
Stage 1: Consultations;  
� 
Stage 2: Baseline Studies and Evaluation of Ecological Receptors;   
� 
Stage 3: Identification of Valued Ecological Receptors;

� 
Stage 4: Identification and Characterisation of Potential Impacts;  
� 
Stage 5: Assessment of Significant Effects. 
8.4.2 
The guidance provides a framework for the evaluation of ecological 
features. It takes into account the direct biodiversity value of habitats 
and species, the indirect value of features which help support the 
ecological integrity of key features, legal protection for sites and 
species and evaluation against national and local planning guidance 
and objectives. 
8.4.3 
It should be noted that whilst the evaluation considers the presence of 
protected species that receive both legal and non-statutory protection, 
the simple presence of a species does not necessarily infer value at the 
level of protection it receives.  Therefore, the value of a site for a 
protected species is assessed taking into account the recorded level 
and type of activity, the significance of the legal protection it receives 
and the geographical context. 
Consultations 
8.4.4 
Section 8.5 details how consultations have been undertaken to date.  
Baseline Studies and Evaluation of Ecological Receptors 
8.4.5 
Baseline information regarding ecological features relevant to the  
Project Site, including all statutory and non-statutory designated sites, 
species populations, species assemblages and habitats were obtained 
from several key sources. These included desk studies and ecological 
field surveys.  Details of these studies and surveys are given below. 
8.4.6 
Extended Phase 1 Habitat Surveys 
Desk Study 
8.4.7 
A desk study was undertaken to collect records of protected and 
notable species, and habitats within the vicinity of the Project Site.  This 
desk study was undertaken as part of the AMEC Extended Phase 1 
Habitat Survey in July 2012
9. The desk study involved collation of 
records of protected species, statutory designated sites and important 
habitat features within a radius of 2 km of the Project Site.  
8.4.8 
The following organisations and web-based databases were consulted:

8.4.9 
At the time of the 2012 Amec study, HPL was undertaking its 
optioneering for the Gas Connection and Electrical Connection route 
corridor options. Accordingly, now that HPL has identified indicative 
route corridor options a separate desk study covering these options has 
been undertaken.  This desk study has used a 15 km search area for 
statutorily designated sites, 10 km for non-statutorily designated sites 
and 5 km for protected or notable species. The results of this desk 
study have determined the species specific phase 2 surveys 
undertaken for the route corridor options.  
Field Survey 
8.4.10 
Two extended Phase One Habitat Surveys have been undertaken for 
the Project.  The first was completed by AMEC in July 2012 and formed 
an appendix to the Scoping Report.  This first report considered the 
Power Generation Plant Site, but did not consider the possible Gas or 
Electrical Connection, as the potential locations of these had not yet 
been developed at that time.   
8.4.11 
The second Phase One study was carried out in May 2013, and 
surveyed the Gas Connection and Electrical connection route corridor 
options being considered at that time.  Three Gas Connection routes 
were originally considered; one has subsequently been excluded 
leaving two potential options (as identified in Section 4.6). 
8.4.12 
The extended Phase 1 habitat surveys were undertaken to assess the 
ecological value of the Project Site and record any protected or rare 
habitats.  Evidence of and potential for any notable or protected 
species on the Project Site or within the relevant surrounding area (up 
to 50 m outside the survey area boundary where visibility allowed) was 
also recorded. 
8.4.13 
The surveys followed standard methodology published by the Joint 
Nature Conservation Committee (JNCC)
10, with habitat types present

8.4.14 
Phase 2 Protected Species Surveys 
8.4.15 
The phase 1 habitat surveys and existing desk study information have 
been used to inform the scope and extent of further surveys for 
protected or otherwise notable species. 
Field Surveys 
8.4.16 
Detailed and specific Phase 2 species surveys are underway or have 
been completed for great crested newts and other amphibians, 
badgers, bats, breeding birds, reptiles, otters and water voles.  Each 
survey has been/is being undertaken in 2013 using standard 
methodologies as published in best practice guidance.  All surveys 
have been designed to confirm the presence or likely absence of the 
relevant species, and population estimates where relevant to the 
assessment.    
Badgers 
8.4.17 
The badger surveys were based on the standard approach detailed in 
Surveying Badgers (Harris et al., 1989)12 and used during the National 
Badger Survey (Cresswell et al., 1990)13.  Particular emphasis was 
placed on locating badger setts and signs of territorial activity.   
Bats 
8.4.18 
All surveys were carried out using standard methodologies as 
recommended by the Bat Conservation Trust (2012) in Bat Surveys – 
Good Practice Guidelines 2nd Edition14, and Joint Nature Conservation 
Committee (2004) Bat Workers’ Manual15.

8.4.19 
The breeding bird surveys were designed to follow the ‘Common Bird 
Census’ (CBC)16,17 methodology and were adapted to suit the Project 
Site.  A predetermined transect route was designed to take into account 
all habitats present in the vicinity of the proposals. 
Water vole

Otters 
8.4.21 
The otter survey is being undertaken using standard methodologies as 
recommended in the English Nature Otter Ecology 19 guide. 
Reptiles 
8.4.22 
The reptile surveys are being carried out following standard 
methodologies as recommended in the Herpetofauna Workers’ 
Manual20 and Froglife Advice Sheet 921’. 
Great crested newts 
8.4.23 
The great crested newt and other amphibian surveys were carried out 
using standard methodologies as recommended in the Herpetofauna

by NRW licensed ecologists. 
Identification of Valued Ecological Receptors 
8.4.24 
It is neither practical nor appropriate for an assessment of the 
ecological effects of a proposed development to consider every species 
and habitat that may be affected equally and consistently.  Instead, it is 
sensible to focus on ‘valued ecological receptors’ (VER). VERs are 
sites, species and habitats present within the ‘zone of influence’ that

are of sufficiently high value that an effect upon them could be 
considered significant.   
8.4.25 
The ES will identify VER’s and report any identified likely significant 
environmental impacts upon them.  Non-significant impacts on VER’s 
will be summarised in a separate report, in accordance with DCO 
Application requirements. 
8.4.26 
There is also the potential that the Project will have an impact on 
species which have not been deemed VERs, but receive legal 
protection requiring action to be taken to conserve them. In such cases, 
the impacts will be considered and mitigation proposed alongside 
VERs. 
8.4.27 
The value of sites, populations of species, species assemblages and 
habitats will be evaluated with reference to their: 
� 
Importance in terms of ‘Biodiversity Conservation Value’ (which 
relates to the need to conserve representatives areas of different 
habitats and the genetic diversity of species populations, rarity, 
sensitivity and resilience); 
� 
Delivery of eco-system services 
� 
Legal status; and 
� 
Local and national conservation status (taken from local and 
national policies such as UK Biodiversity Action Plan (UKBAP), and 
the RCT Local Biodiversity Action Plan (LBAP). 
 
8.4.28 
For the purposes of this assessment, sites, species populations, 
species assemblages and habitats are valued using the geographical 
scale detailed in Table 8.2.  The valuation of sites makes use of any 
established systems, with examples provided in the Table.  However, 
professional judgement has been used to attribute value to receptors 
considered to be of district value or below.

8.4.29 
The valuation of species populations, assemblages of species, and 
habitat uses a range of significance criteria. Examples of these criteria 
are described below. 
Species Population 
8.4.30 
The importance of populations is evaluated on the basis of their size, 
recognised status (e.g. published lists of species of conservation 
concern and Biodiversity Action Plan (BAP) status) and legal protection 
status where related to conservation attributes. 
8.4.31 
For example, bird populations exceeding 1 per cent of published bio-
geographic populations are considered to be of international 
importance, and those exceeding 1 per cent of published national 
populations are considered to be of national importance (where the 
former does not also apply). 
Species Assemblage 
8.4.32 
In some instances, it is species assemblages that are of importance. 
Criteria used to evaluate the importance of assemblages include SSSI 
selection criteria, as published by the Joint Nature Conservation 
Committee. 
Habitats 
8.4.33 
Criteria for the evaluation of habitats and plant communities include: 
Annex III of the EC Habitats Directive, Guidelines for the Selection of 
Biological SSSIs; and, where available, Local Authority and Wildlife 
Trust criteria for the selection of Local Sites (e.g. County Wildlife Sites). 
Legal protection status is also a consideration for certain habitats.  
Delivery of eco-system services and buffering of other sensitive 
habitats or species are also taken into account. 
8.4.34 
Within the ES, sites, species populations, species assemblages and 
habitats will be considered to be VERs if they are valued as being of 
local importance or higher.  It is considered that no significant effect 
can occur to features considered to be below local importance, except 
where a feature has high social, economic, supporting or secondary 
value.  Non-significant effects will be reported separately in accordance 
with the DCO Application process. 
8.4.35 
The description and valuation of ecological features will take account of 
any likely future changes in the absence of the proposed development.  
For example, these include: trends in the population size or distribution 
of species; likely changes to the extent of habitats; and, the effects of 
other proposed developments or land-use changes.

Identification and Characterisation of Potential Impacts 
8.4.36 
A preliminary assessment of the potential likely ecological impacts from 
the Project during construction (including demolition), operation and 
decommissioning has been undertaken in this PEIR.  A further 
characterisation of potential impacts will be provided in the ES.  In 
identifying these impacts, a number of parameters are taken into 
account. 
The parameters used to determine the nature of the impact include:  
� 
Magnitude - The size or intensity of the effect measured in relevant 
terms. For example, the number of individuals lost or gained; area 
of habitat lost or created; or, the degree of change to existing 
conditions such as noise or lighting levels. The magnitude of an 
impact is further discussed below. 
� 
Negative or Positive Effect - Whether the effect of the impact would 
result in net loss or degradation of a VER or whether it would 
enhance or improve it. 
� 
Extent - The spatial scope of the effect; for example: the physical 
area affected or the geographical pattern of the effect. 
� 
Duration - The length of time over which the effect will occur. 
� 
Reversibility - The extent to which effects are reversible, either 
spontaneously or through active mitigation. 
� 
Timing and Frequency - Consideration of the timing of events in 
relation to ecological change. Some effects may be of greater 
significance if they take place at certain times of year such as 
during the breeding bird season. The extent to which an effect is 
repeated may also be of importance. 
8.4.37 
Establishing the Magnitude of Impact - Impacts can be permanent or 
temporary, direct or indirect and can be cumulative. These factors are 
brought together to assess the magnitude of the impact on particular 
VERs and, wherever possible, the magnitude of the impact is 
quantified.  Professional judgment is then used to assign the effects on 
the receptors to one of four classes of magnitude, as defined in Table 
8.3.

TABLE 8.3: DEFINITION OF MAGNITUDE 
Magnitude 
Definition 
Severe 
A permanent or long-term impact on the 
extent, size or integrity of a site, habitat, 
species assemblage or community, population 
or group.  If adverse, this is likely to threaten 
its sustainability; if beneficial, this is likely to 
enhance its conservation status. 
Major 
A permanent or long-term impact on the 
extent or size or integrity of a site, habitat, 
species assemblage or community, population 
or group.  If adverse, this is unlikely to 
threaten its sustainability; if beneficial; this is 
likely to be sustainable but is unlikely to 
enhance its conservation status. 
Moderate 
A permanent or long-term reversible impact 
on a site, habitat, species assemblage or 
community, population or group whose 
magnitude is detectable but would not 
threaten its integrity. 
Minor 
A short-term, reversible impact on the extent 
or size or integrity of a site, habitat, species 
assemblage or community, population or 
group that is within the normal range. 
Not significant 
No impact or an impact which is beneath the 
level of perception, within normal bounds of 
variation or within the margin of error of the 
ecological assessments. 
8.4.38 
It should be noted that although the assessment of an impacts’ 
magnitude is an integral part of the methodology set out within the 
IEEM Guidelines, these guidelines do not provide the definitions set out 
in Table 8.3.  These definitions are included to provide additional clarity 
and to allow transparency over how the decision of whether an impact 
is significant have been reached.  These definitions complement the 
IEEM guidelines approach, and do not replace it. 
8.4.39 
Potential impacts are characterised initially in the absence of any 
mitigation, except where this is integral to, and embedded within the 
design of the Project, such as the inclusion of technology to reduce the 
emission of airborne pollutants from the stacks.

8.4.40 
Any additional measures specifically proposed to mitigate or 
compensate an identified impact are identified separately after the 
preliminary  Impact Assessment. 
Assessment of Significant Effects 
8.4.41 
An initial assessment of the significance of the predicted effects on 
VERs arising from the proposed Project impacts, including designed-in 
and additional mitigation measures, has been presented in this PEIR.   
8.4.42 
Effects can be either negative, positive or not significant.  Positive or 
negative effects may be either significant or non-significant depending 
on the degree of predicted impact. 
Negative 
8.4.43 
For habitat and species, a negative effect is considered to be significant 
if the favourable conservation status of a VER is compromised by the 
final design of the Project. Conservation status is defined by IEEM 
(2006) as being, for Habitats: 
8.4.44 
“Conservation status is determined by the sum of the influences acting 
on the habitat and its typical species that may affect its long-term 
distribution, structure and functions as well as the long-term survival of 
its typical species within a given geographical area.” 
8.4.45 
The IEEM (2006) definition of conservation status, for Species, is: 
8.4.46 
“Conservation status is determined by the sum of the influences acting 
on the species concerned that may affect the long-term distribution and 
abundance of its populations within a given geographical area.” 
8.4.47 
The decision as to whether the favourable conservation status of a 
VER is likely to be compromised is made using professional judgement 
based on an analysis of the predicted effects of the project (including 
consideration of the specific parameters outlined above). 
8.4.48 
A similar procedure is used by IEEM for designated sites that could be 
affected, except that the focus is on the effects on the integrity of each 
site.  This is defined as “the coherence of ecological structure and 
function, across a site’s whole area, that enable it to sustain the habitat, 
complex of habitats and / or levels of populations of species for which it 
was classified.”  
8.4.49 
This assessment is made with reference to the features for which a site 
has been classified / notified and involves combining assessments of 
the effects on the conservation status of each of these features.

Positive 
8.4.50 
A positive effect is considered to be significant if development activities 
cause: 
� 
A non-valued ecological receptor to become valued; 
� 
A VER to increase in value such that it would be considered 
important at a higher geographic scale, e.g. from Local to County 
Importance; 
� 
Restoration of favourable conservation status for a habitat / species 
population; and / or 
� 
Restoration/maintenance of the integrity of a site (where this has 
been undermined or is likely to be in the absence of the proposed 
Project intervention). 
8.4.51 
The complete significance assessment will be undertaken following full 
analysis of data (several ecological surveys are still ongoing) and will 
be presented in the forthcoming ES.  The assessment will consider the 
potential impacts from all aspects of the Project on each individually 
identified VER. 
8.4.52 
An assessment of the residual impacts, post-mitigation, will also be 
included in the ES.  This will identify proposed mitigation/compensation 
measures, and the predicted effects on VERs resulting from their 
implementation.  When assessing residual impacts, the assessment will 
consider the likelihood of mitigation being successful, the steps 
required to implement it, and any ecological or other post-development 
monitoring considered necessary to confirm mitigation is effective.

This PEIR sets out a preliminary assessment of the likely significant 
environmental effects of teh proposed Project on ecology.

8.6.4 
Blaen Cynon SAC is situated 0.4 km to the north of the Project Site.  
The primary reason for selection is the Annex II species Marsh Fritillary 
(Eurodryas aurinia) butterfly.  The SAC covers a total of 66ha and also 
includes Woodland Park and Pontpren SSSIs.   
8.6.5 
The Coedydd Nedd a Melte SAC is situated 1.4 km to the north west of 
the Project Site.  The SAC covers an area of 378ha. The primary 
reason for designation is the presence of the Annex I habitat of Tilio-
Acerion forests of slopes, screes and ravines.  The secondary 
designating feature is the presence of Annex I habitat of Old sessile 
oak with Ilex and Blechnum in the UK which is western acidic oak 
woodland. 
8.6.6 
Cwm Cadlan SAC is situated approximately 14 km from the Project 
Site.  Cwm Cadlan has the largest recorded example of Molinia 
meadows in Wales, which is an Annex I habitat and the primary reason 
for designation of the site.  The secondary designating feature is the 
presence of another Annex I habitat, Alkaline Fen.   
8.6.7 
River Usk / afon wysg SAC is situated approximately 14 km from the 
Project Site.  It is a major water course for which the primary reason for 
designation is the presence of several Annex II species, these are Sea 
lamprey (Petromyzon marinus), Brook lamprey (Lampetra planeri), 
River lamprey (Lampetra fluviatilis), Twaite shad (Alosa fallax), Atlantic 
salmon (Salmo salar), Bullhead (Cottus gobio) and Otter  (Lutra lutra). 
8.6.8 
Brecon Beacons SAC is situated approximately 14km from the Project 
Site.  Brecon Beacons SAC is designated for the presence of two 
Annex I habitats, including plant communities that colonise cracks and 
fissures on calcareous rocky slopes, and also siliceous rocky slopes.  
8.6.9 
Sites of Special Scientific Interest (SSSI) 
8.6.10 
There are 24 ecological SSSI sites within 15 km of the Project Site. 
� 
Cors Bryn-y-Gaer SSSI – is approximately 0.4 km north of the 
Power Generation Plant Site and is of special interest for lowland 
bog areas and the diversity of grassland habitats across a complex 
with wet heath and swamp; 
� 
Woodland Park and Pontpren SSSI – is divided into three blocks 
with the nearest being 1.2 km northeast of the Power Generation 
Plant Site and is designated for Marsh Fritillary butterfly;  
� 
Dyffrynoedd Nedd a Mellte Moel Penderyn SSSI – is approximately 
1.4 km north west of the Power Generation Plant Site and is of 
special interest for its extensive and diverse semi-natural 
woodland, important populations of several flowering plants and

The BBNPA is located approximately 0.4 km to the north of the 
proposed Power Generation Plant Site at its closest point.  Some 
habitats within the BBNPA may be sensitive to changes in air quality 
resulting from the construction, operational, and decommissioning 
stages of the Project. 
8.6.15 
Non Statutory Sites 
8.6.16 
The original desk study completed in 2012 had a search radius of 2 km 
from the proposed Power Generation Plant Site.  This identified eight 
Sites of Importance for Nature Conservation (SINCs).  The additional 
extended desk study includes a radius of search of 10km and is 
currently in progress, full details will be included within the ES.  The 
eight sites identified to date are listed below 
� 
Coed Wernhir SINC 
� 
Werfa Farm SINC 
� 
Rhigos Tramway SINC 
� 
Hirwaun Industrial Estate SINC 
� 
Hirwaun Pond SINC  
� 
Hirwaun Common SINC 
� 
Hirwaun Ponds (North) SINC 
� 
Hirwaun Iron Works SINC 
8.6.17 
None of the SINCs listed are within the Project Site. However, Hirwaun 
Industrial Estate SINC is located immediately adjacent to the north of 
the Power Generation Plant. Hirwaun Industrial Estate SINC supports a 
large mosaic of habitat centred around an ancient lowland peat bog, 
and provides high quality habitat for a diversity of invertebrate, reptiles, 
amphibians and bird species.  Consideration of dust, air quality and 
hydrological considerations will be important for this site, with potential 
for impacts to arise during construction / demolition, operation and 
decommissioning of the Project.  Potential effects upon this site and 
other SINC’s will be fully considered within the ES.  A specific 
construction stage Method Statement will be produced with the ES that 
will set out measures to protect the SINC during this phase of the 
Project. 
Extended Phase 1 Habitat Survey Results 
8.6.18 
The Phase 1 habitat surveys determined that the survey area contained 
a mosaic of habitats including: broadleaved semi-natural woodland, 
mixed semi-natural woodland, scrub, broadleaved scattered trees, 
semi-improved acid grassland, semi-improved neutral grassland,

Improved grassland, marshy grassland, ruderal herbs, swamp, 
introduced shrub, amenity grassland, species poor intact hedgerow, dry 
ditches, standing water, running water, wall, buildings, hard standing 
and dry shrub heath. 
8.6.19 
The majority of the Power Generation Plant and all of Electrical 
Connection route corridor option 1 comprises existing buildings and 
hardstanding, and direct loss or disturbance of semi-natural habitats 
will therefore be minimal.   
8.6.20 
Both options under consideration for the Gas Connection will result in 
some temporary disturbance of semi-natural habitats, although option 2 
passes through significant areas of hard-standing (existing roads) and 
option 2 crosses intensively grazed agricultural land.  
8.6.21 
Electrical Connection route corridor option 1 crosses over the 
waterlogged / marshy area of grassland to the north and west of the 
Power Generation Plant Site. However, as it is an overhead line there 
will be no loss of or disturbance to habitats.  
8.6.22 
Likewise, as Electrical Connection route corridor option 2 crosses 
through the Hirwaun Industrial Estate and will be buried beneath an 
area currently covered in hardstanding, there will be no loss of or 
disturbance to habitats.   
8.6.23 
The extended phase 1 habitats identified habitats that had potential to 
support a variety of protected or otherwise notable species, including: 
� 
Badgers; 
� 
Bats; 
� 
Breeding birds 
� 
Water voles 
� 
Otters 
� 
Reptiles 
� 
Great crested newts

Phase 2 Species Specific Surveys to date 
8.6.24 
As part of the Phase 2 survey effort for the proposed Project the 
following surveys have been commissioned: badger, bats, breeding 
bird, great crested newt and other amphibians, otters, water voles and 
reptile.

8.6.25 
In line with the desk study and field results from the Phase 1 Habitat 
Survey, further Phase 2 survey work for invertebrates and habitats 
(NVC) were scoped out due to the Project Site changing to avoid direct 
impacts on the Hirwaun Industrial Estate SINC. Additionally, 
invertebrate survey data was available from surveys undertaken in 
2008 and 2009 by National Grid as part of the planning application for 
the Rhigos Substation. The Phase 1 Habitat survey undertaken in 2013 
indicated that significant changes in habitats or invertebrate 
communities were unlikely to have occurred since those surveys and 
therefore the data was considered fit for purpose.   
8.6.26 
All phase 2 surveys were carried out by suitably qualified and 
experienced ecologists following current best practice at the 
appropriate time of year. Further details of these methodologies are 
provided in Section 8.4.  
8.6.27 
With respect to the Phase 2 surveys that have already been 
commissioned and are either complete or underway, a summary of the 
results to-date is provided in Table 8.4 below.  These and the final 
results will be used to inform the detailed design of the Project and any 
mitigation measures needed, with the aim of minimising impacts on the 
ecological receptors identified as far as possible, and allowing 
appropriate targeting of any enhancement measures.

optimal times of 
survey. 
A badger survey of the Power 
Generation Plant Site and Electrical 
Connection route corridor options was 
undertaken in April 2013.   
No signs of badger were noted.  No 
ecological constraints are therefore 
anticipated with regards to badgers 
although precautionary mitigation 
should be employed due to the risk, 
albeit low, of occasional through 
passage by the species.

Static bat detectors 
have been and will be

survey data. 
 
A total of four bat transect surveys 
have been completed so far.  The final 
bat transect survey will be carried out 
in September 2013 
To date very low levels of bat activity 
have been recorded across the 
Project Site.  The majority of the bat 
activity has been recorded from 
common pipistrelle (Pipistrellus 
pipistrellus) and soprano pipistrelle 
(Pipistrellus pygmaeus) bats.  A 
Myotis species of bat was record 
during the August survey. 
Bat activity within the Project Site has 
been either commuting or foraging 
activity. 
Slightly higher levels of bat activity 
were recorded during the August 
transect in comparison to the other 
months surveyed. 
 
Static bat detectors have been 
deployed on four occasions.  The data 
for this is yet to be analysed.

Relatively common species of birds 
were recorded within the survey area, 
with a less diverse avifauna recorded 
within the Hirwaun Industrial Estate 
SINC than was anticipated on the 
basis of the habitats present.  Swifts 
were observed nesting within two of 
the buildings likely to be demolished 
within the proposed footprint of the 
Power Generation Plant Site. 
 
Great crested 
newt survey 
Four surveys to 
determine presence, 
two additional surveys 
to complete population 
assessment if GCN 
are found. 
Surveys carried out in 
spring / early summer, 
with half completed 
between mid-April and 
mid-May. 
The great crested newt (GCN) 
(Triturus cristatus) presence / absence 
surveys have been completed, with 
four surveys having been completed 
within accessible ponds across the 
proposed Project Site.  No GCN were 
recorded during any of the surveys, 
although small numbers of palmate 
newts, common toad and common 
frogs were found.   
Reptiles 
Seven survey visits 
carried out over the 
course of spring – 
early summer and 
early autumn. 
Two surveys have been completed to 
date at the end of August 2013.  No 
reptiles have so far been discovered 
during the surveys  
Following completion of the reptile 
surveys in September 2013, a full 
assessment of impacts on this species

group and determination of mitigation 
requirements can be provided.  If 
reptiles are found present specific 
measures will be incorporated into the 
ES, if no reptiles are recorded there 
may still be a need for precautionary 
mitigation based on the assumed 
presence of reptiles at the Hirwaun 
Industrial Estate Sinc (as recorded 
during survey work completed by 
National Grid in 2008/2009).

Preliminary Assessment of Potential Impacts 
8.7.1 
Based on the current status of the Ecological Impact Assessment 
(EcIA), Table 8.5 describes the main potential impacts, their sources, 
pathways and the relevant ecological receptors.  These are the 
elements that are anticipated to be fully assessed as part of the EIA for 
the Project, although due to the iterative nature of EcIA, this is unlikely 
to comprise the final list.

Construction / Demolition  
8.7.2 
Due to the mobility and range of the protected and notable species 
within the local area and due to the sensitivity of designated sites and 
habitats in the local area, elements of the proposed construction / 
demolition are considered likely to impact on one or more VERs.  The 
impacts will be a mix of permanent and short term impacts and related 
to 
habitat 
disturbance 
and 
increase 
in 
construction 
related 
disturbances.  
Elements 
anticipated 
to 
require 
the 
greatest 
consideration are potential air/water-borne pollutants on the adjacent 
Hirwaun Industrial Estate SINC and the demolition of buildings known 
to be used by nesting birds and roosting bats.   
Operation  
8.7.3 
The operational phase of the Project will see some elements potentially 
impact upon local ecology, as summarised in Table 8.5.  However, 
certain elements are expected to have little impact, especially following 
the application of mitigation. Elements anticipated to require greatest 
consideration are the permanent loss of small amounts of neutral 
grassland habitats from the Power Generation Plant Site, and air 
quality effects on habitats resulting from emissions from the Power 
Generation Plant.  
Decommissioning  
8.7.4 
It is possible that during the decommissioning stage of the Project, 
there could be impacts to VERS. However, the mitigation measures 
designed to offset construction and demolition impacts would be 
designed not to attract VERS back to the operational Project Site. 
Therefore, a preliminary assessment is that the impacts experienced 
during decommissioning would be less than those for construction.  
Gas Connection (Options 1 and 2)Construction  
8.7.5 
The majority of the potential impacts associated with the proposed Gas 
Connection will be temporary in nature and related to habitat 
disturbance and increases in construction related disturbances whilst 
the pipeline is being excavated and laid.  Habitats present would be 
reinstated following installation of the pipelines, and would be restored 
to as closely match pre-existing habitats as possible (subject to any 
options for habitat enhancement that may be available and which will 
not be identified until the ES is produced). 
Operation

for Hirwaun Power 
 
- 177 - 
 
 
8.7.6 
The operational phase of the Gas Connection is anticipated to have 
negligible impact on ecological receptors. 
Decommissioning  
8.7.7 
During decommissioning of the Gas Connection (either option), no 
impacts are predicted given that it is assumed at this stage that the 
pipeline will be left in situ and no further ground disturbance will take 
place.  
Electrical Connection (Option 1) 
Construction  
8.7.8 
Electrical Connection route corridor option 1 would be an overhead line 
running approximately 250m from the Power Generation Plant into the 
Rhigos Substation. Due to the short distance of the line and close 
proximity to the Power Generation Plant, the impacts of the connection 
could be considered as part of the construction of the Power 
Generation Plant.   
Operation  
8.7.9 
The operation of the overhead line is not anticipated to have any 
impacts on ecological habitats.  
Decommissioning  
8.7.10 
As per construction, the decommissioning of Electrical Connection 
option 1 would be considered as part of the decommissioning of the 
Power Generation Plant. Therefore, only minor impacts are predicted,  
Electrical Connection (Option 2) 
Construction  
8.7.11 
Electrical Connection route corridor option 2 would be a buried 
underground cable which would be sited entirely in hardstanding on the 
Hirwaun Industrial Estate. Although there would be increases in 
disturbance to the area during construction, due to the nature of the 
location of the electrical connection, it is not anticipated to have any 
impacts on ecological receptors.  
Operation  
8.7.12 
The operation of Electrical Connection Option 2 is not anticipated to 
have any impacts on ecological habitats.

Decommissioning  
8.7.13 
During decommissioning of Electrical Connection Option 2, no impacts 
are predicted given that it is assumed at this stage that the cable will be 
left in situ and no further ground disturbance will take place.  
8.8 
Potential Mitigation Measures 
8.8.1 
Mitigation measures to limit impacts on ecology and biodiversity will be 
fully considered within the ES.  Measures that are likely to be required 
are listed below: 
� 
Production and implementation of a construction-phase Method 
Statement to minimise impacts on the Hirwaun Industrial Estate 
SINC; 
� 
Timing of demolition/vegetation clearance activities to avoid nesting 
bird season and minimise impacts on roosting bats; 
� 
Provision of replacement nesting/roosting sites for bird and bat 
species; 
� 
Sensitive clearance of habitats with potential to support reptiles and 
other protected species; 
� 
Dust-suppression measures and pollution prevention strategy 
during demolition and construction works; 
� 
A Construction Environmental Management Plan; 
� 
Pre-construction surveys to reconfirm status of key habitats and 
species; 
� 
Design and implementation of a sensitive lighting strategy for the 
Project Site that avoids light-spill onto adjacent habitats; 
� 
A programme on ecological monitoring to confirm the effectiveness 
of mitigation measures. 
8.8.2 
These specific mitigation measures will be determined once all of the 
phase 2 protected species surveys have been completed and a fuller 
picture of the potential impacts has been obtained.  Potential impacts 
on designated sites and sensitive habitats relating to air quality effects 
will be informed by the emerging results from the air quality 
assessment, as will any requirements for mitigation/monitoring in 
relation to potential air quality effects.

8.10.2 
The potential requirements for, and content of any assessment required 
under the Habitats Regulations in relation to the Blaen Cynon SAC and 
Coedydd Nedd a Melte SAC (and other Natura 2000 sites) will be 
included in this consultation.  A formal screening report is being 
produced which will identify whether Likely Significant Effects (LSE) are 
anticipated.  This will be provided to NRW and RCTCBC in due 
course.. 
8.10.3 
Based on the above assessment methodology and the initial data / 
survey results presented in this Section, significance criteria will be 
defined for the Project Site and its surroundings and a full ecological 
impact assessment will be undertaken to determine the likely impacts 
of construction / demolition, operation and decommissioning of the 
Project.  This will in turn inform a more accurate determination of the 
mitigation required to ensure the structure and function of the area’s 
nature conservation value is maintained. 
8.10.4 
The general and species-specific mitigation proposed above, together 
with on-going consultation with key stakeholders, including NRW and 
RCTCBC and others as appropriate, will be used to inform the final 
Project layout in order to minimise impacts to ecology and biodiversity, 
as far as is practicable, and to ensure suitable and sufficient 
mitigation/compensation where impacts cannot be avoided.  
8.10.5 
The EcIA will also address the potential impacts of the Gas Connection 
on VERs.  By the time the EcIA is finalised a preferred option for the 
Gas Connection route will have been selected, and the bulk of the 
assessment will focus on the selected option.  A summary of the 
ecological considerations given to the other option would however be 
included to allow comparison with the least preferred option. 
8.10.6 
The results of the Extended Phase 1 habitat survey and the Phase 2 
surveys undertaken along the selected option would be included, as 
would any mitigation measure considered necessary to limit identified 
impacts on ecological receptors.   
8.10.7 
When a greater understanding of the ecological baseline and exact 
nature of project impacts is understood, it will also be possible to 
consider opportunities for ecological enhancement as part of the final 
project design.

WATER QUALITY AND RESOURCES 
9.1 
Introduction 
9.1.1 
During 
construction 
(including 
demolition), 
operation 
and 
decommissioning of the Project, there is limited potential to generate 
discharges to local water courses and thus impact on local water 
quality.  There will be minimal water usage requirements at the Project 
Site, particularly during operation as the Power Generation Plant will 
operate with air cooling.  Neither the Gas / Electrical Connection will 
require any water to operate.  Both water quality and water usage will 
be assessed in this section and a full assessment will be carried out 
and presented in the final ES to be submitted with the proposed DCO 
Application   
9.1.2 
This section will also provide a brief summary of the main issues and 
risks posed to and from flooding.  However these will be assessed in 
detail through a separate Flood Risk Assessment (FRA) submitted as a 
separate document as part of the proposed DCO Application.  
9.2 
Legislative and Policy Context 
Water Framework Directive 
9.2.2 
EU Directive 2000/60/EC established a framework for Community 
action in the field of water policy (the Water Framework Directive 
(WFD)).  The overarching goal of the WFD is for relevant waters to 
reach "good" chemical and ecological status by 2015. Member states 
then have to maintain this standard. Provided that certain conditions 
are satisfied, in some cases the achievement of good status may be 
delayed until 2021 or 2027.   
9.2.3 
The WFD also sets goals for the progressive reduction of emissions, 
discharges and losses of Priority Substances and the cessation of 
Priority Hazardous Substances. As part of the WFD's aim to improve 
water quality by reducing specific Priority Substances, the first priority 
substances list (Decision 2455/2001/EC) was issued by the European 
Commission identifying 33 priority substances.  
9.2.4 
The Priority Substances Directive, a daughter directive of the WFD was 
introduced in 2008 and it replaced the first priority substances list. In 
2012, the European Commission put forward a proposal for a directive 
amending the WFD and the Priority Substances Directive regarding 
Priority Substances.  In July 2013, the European Parliament adopted a 
legislative resolution on the proposal. As such, a new Directive may 
emerge but is not currently in force.

9.2.5 
In the UK, a technical advisory group (WFDTAG) consisting of the UK 
environment and conservation agencies has been established to 
support the implementation of the WFD.  The WFDTAG has 
established standards for certain substances that they consider are 
concentration of a pollutant below which no harmful effects on aquatic 
organisms would be expected. 
National Policy Statements 
9.2.6 
As explained in Section 2, the Overarching NPS for Energy (EN-1) 
explains the assessment principles to which the Secretary of State will 
have regard in the examination of an energy NSIP (such as the 
proposed Project), and explains the generic water quality and 
resources impacts with regard to energy infrastructure.  Specific 
considerations for fossil fuel generating stations are provided in the 
NPS for Fossil Fuel Generating Infrastructure (EN-2). The NPSs for 
Gas and Oil Pipelines (EN-4) and Electricity Networks Infrastructure 
(EN-5) provide specific considerations potentially relevant to the Gas 
Connection and Electrical Connection respectively.  
9.2.7 
NPS EN-1 states, in Section 5.15, that “Infrastructure development can 
have adverse effects on the water environment including groundwater, 
inland surface water, transitional waters and coastal waters.”  An 
assessment of the existing conditions regarding water quality, water 
resources and physical characteristics of the water environment and 
the impacts of a proposed project is required, by paragraph 5.15.2. 
9.2.8 
EN-1 notes that activities that discharge to the water environment are 
subject to additional pollution controls and recommends that the 
Secretary of State gives increased weight to impacts on the water 
environment that would have an adverse affect on the achievement of 
the objectives of the WFD in its decision making.  Paragraph 5.15.7 
states that: “The [Secretary of State] should consider whether 
appropriate requirements should be attached to any development 
consent ... to mitigate adverse effects on the water environment.” 
9.2.9 
EN-2 Part 2 Section 2.10 states that; ‘Water quality and resource’ 
recognises that some fossil fuel generating stations such as coal-fired 
stations and CCGTs have very high water demands, whilst others such 
as open cycle gas turbines (OCGTs) have very little water demand.  
9.2.10 
EN-4 Part 2 Section 2.22 recognises that “constructing pipelines 
creates corridors of surface clearance and excavation that can 
potentially affect watercourses, aquifers, water abstraction and 
discharge points, areas prone to flooding and ecological receptors. 
Pipeline impacts could include inadequate or excessive drainage, 
interference 
with 
groundwater 
flow 
pathways, 
mobilisation

contaminants already in the ground, the introduction of new pollutants, 
flooding, disturbance to water ecology, pollution due to silt from 
construction / demolition and disturbance to species and their habitats”. 
9.2.11 
EN-4 states that where the project is likely to have effects on water 
resources or water quality an assessment of the impacts should be 
provided in line with Section 5.15 as part of the ES.  The Secretary of 
State should be satisfied that the impacts on water quality and 
resources are acceptable in accordance with Section 5.15 of EN-1.  
Environmental Permitting Regulations 2010 
9.2.12 
The Environmental Permitting (England and Wales) Regulations 2007 
sought to establish an integrated approach to Waste Management 
Licensing and Pollution Prevention and Control.  In April 2010, the 
Environmental Permitting (England and Wales) Regulations 2010 
increased the scope of the Environmental Permit to include water 
discharges and groundwater activities.  NRW will control and regulate 
the Project with respect to the discharge of any effluent from the Project 
Site via an Environmental Permit.  The permit will include specific limits 
for a range of pollutants that could be present in any effluent proposed 
to be discharged to surface waters.  These limits will be set to ensure 
that the process contribution of any pollutant within the scope of the 
WFD and the EQS Directive does not detrimentally affect the potential 
for the receiving water body to achieve good status.   
Other National and Local Policy 
9.2.13 
The Rhondda Cynon Taf Local Development Plan 2006-2021 was 
adopted in March 2011.  It sets out how the county borough will be 
developed over 15 years.  The policy sets out several Welsh Strategies 
that were considered in the development of the plan. 
9.2.14 
The Rhondda Cynon Taf Local Development Plan contains policies 
which should be considered when making a planning application.  
Those policies relevant to water resources include the following. 
Policy AW 8 – Protection and enhancement of the Natural 
Environment 
9.2.15 
This policy aims to preserve Rhondda Cynon Taf’s distinctive natural 
heritage by enhancing and protecting its features.  
Policy AW 10 – Environmental Protection and Public Health 
9.2.16 
This policy states that proposals will not be permitted where they would 
cause or result in a risk of unacceptable harm to health and /or local

amenity because of contamination, landfill gas, land instability, water 
pollution and flooding etc. unless it can be demonstrated that measures 
can be taken to overcome any significant adverse risk to public health, 
the environment and/or any impact upon local amenity. 
Standards and Guidance 
9.2.17 
The primary guidance which has been used in compiling this Section is 
the EA Horizontal Guidance Note H1 – Annexes D and E, which has

Additionally, the CIRIA Publication C532 – ‘Control of Water Pollution 
from Construction Sites’ has also been considered.

Realistic Worst Case Scenario for Assessment 
9.3.1 
In respect of potential impacts on water quality and resources, the 
realistic worst case scenario from within the proposed Project 
parameters (described in Section 4 of the PEIR) is set out in Table 9.1 
below.

9.3.2 
A larger number of smaller gas turbine generator units is considered to 
be the worst case scenario for water resources at the Power 
Generation Plant Site.  To generate the same power output at the 
Power Generation Plant Site the water requirement will be increasingly 
higher as the number of units increases. This is because there are 
more plant items for NOx abatement. There is also the requirement for 
marginally more water to wash turbine blades of five separate units 
rather than washing blades of a lower number of units.  
9.3.3 
A preliminary assessment of both options for the Gas Connection and 
the Electrical Connection is presented in this section. A decision on the 
preferred option for each will be taken following consultation.

Assessment Methodology and Significance Criteria 
Water Resources 
9.4.2 
This preliminary assessment of water resources covers all major water 
use activities for the Project.  The sources of  raw water are identified 
and the appropriate processing and storage methods are defined, 
based on the intended uses.  The reason for use and the amounts of 
water required are specified and, where appropriate, the anticipated 
effluent compositions established.

A 'basic' effluent is one where all the components have been identified 
and where the toxicity of the effluent can be explained by the chemical 
properties of the components.  The effluents anticipated to be 
discharged to surface water bodies will be described with reference to 
the Priority Substances prescribed in the WFD and EQS Directive, 
together with the additional relevant pollutants as per Appendix A and 
Appendix B of the EA Horizontal Guidance Note H1 – Annex (d). 
9.4.6 
This Section also presents high level discussions of the likely mitigation 
measures to be employed as the exact nature of all effluents, including 
drainage systems, which will be finalised during the design phase of the 
Project.  The Project will be engineered to adhere to the standards and 
limits for effluent discharge from the Power Generation Plant Area as 
prescribed in the Project’s Environmental Permit. 
Significance Criteria 
9.4.7 
The significance criteria of the potential/likely impacts of the Project on 
water quality are defined in Table 9.3.  These criteria are based on 
guidance for the assessment of the impacts of discharges to surface 
waters as outlined in the EA Horizontal Guidance Note H1 – Annex (d).

Baseline 
Surface Water Bodies 
9.6.2 
Based on the preliminary assessment to date, the main water bodies 
identified within the vicinity of the Project Site are: 
� 
Penderyn Reservoir which is around 800m north of the Power 
Generation Plant Site; 
� 
River Camnant which is culverted underneath the Power 
Generation Plant Site; 
� 
Fishing pond approximately 200m south of the Power Generation 
Plant Site; 
� 
Numerous drainage ditches and several small ponds on agricultural 
land to the south of Rhigos Road; and

� 
Hirwaun Ponds approximately 1 km east of the Power Generation 
Plant Site.  
9.6.3 
The location of these watercourses are shown on Figure 9.1. 
9.6.4 
At this stage of the EIA process the exact path of the River Camnant 
underneath the Power Generation Plant Site is not known.  This will be 
investigated further and confirmed within the ES .  A Water Framework 
Directive (WFD) Assessment will be carried out for this watercourse 
and will form an appendix to the full ES. 
9.6.5 
The river quality for the Camnant is classified as general quality 
assessment (GQA) Grade C (year 2000).  The GQA chemical 
classification system grades are defined by the level of biochemical 
oxygen demand, ammonia and dissolved oxygen in the water; grade C 
is given in Table 9.4 below.

The likely uses and characteristics of grade C water courses are as 
follows: 
� 
Potable supply after advanced treatment; 
� 
Other abstractions; 
� 
Good Cyprinid fisheries; and 
� 
Natural ecosystems, or those corresponding to good cyprinid 
fisheries. 
9.6.7 
An Envirocheck Report, which covers the Project Site detailed three 
discharge consents; two have expired and one has been revoked.  All 
three consents were granted for the same operator: British Coal 
Opencast (likely relating to the former Tower Colliery).  In all three 
cases the discharge type was trade effluent and the receiving water the 
Nant Yr Ochain. 
9.6.8 
Seven pollution incidents to controlled water have also been recorded 
within the Project Site.  None of these incidents occurred within the last 
ten years. Further details are provided in Table 9.5

No water abstractions are recorded within the proposed Project Site 
however there are two approximately 660 m south east at Tower 
Colliery Ltd. The abstraction end dates for both records are not 
supplied therefore it is assumed that abstraction continues at this 
location.   
Hydrogeology 
9.6.10 
The bedrock of the Power Generation Plant Site is classified as a 
Secondary A Aquifer.  This means the bedrock has permeable layers 
capable of supporting water supplies at a local rather than strategic 
scale, and in some cases forming an important source of base flow to 
rivers.

9.6.11 
The groundwater vulnerability across the majority of the Project Site is 
classified as low, this is due to the fact that the overlying soils have a 
low leaching potential in which pollutants are unlikely to penetrate the 
soil layer because water movement is largely horizontal or they have a 
large ability to attenuate diffuse pollutants.  Lateral flow from these soils 
contribute to groundwater recharge elsewhere in the catchment.  
However in the south west corner of the Power Generation Plant Site it 
is classified as unknown therefore a worst case scenario of high is 
assumed until proven otherwise.   
9.6.12 
The hydrogeology of the Project Site will be explored in more detail in 
Section 10 Geology, Ground Contamination and Hydrogeology. 
9.6.13 
There is a source protection zone 1 2 km to the north east of the Power 
Generation Plant Site.  A source protection zone 1 is an inner 
protection zone defined as the 50 day travel time from any point below 
the water table to the source.  This zone has a minimum radius of 50 
m.  Groundwater source protection zones show the risk of 
contamination from any activities that might cause pollution in the area.  
The closer the activity the greater the risk. 
Utilities 
9.6.14 
There is a water treatment plant located to the north of the Power 
Generation Plant Site between Fifth Avenue and the A465.  Combined 
sewers, foul sewers and existing water mains are found throughout the 
Project Site.  These utilities are mainly located along roads.  For 
example, an existing main runs along both Main Avenue and Rhigos 
Road, a combined sewer runs along the A465 and a foul sewer runs 
along Fourth Avenue and Main Avenue with a connection to Willows 
Farm. 
9.6.15 
The Penderyn Reservoir 800 m north of the Project Site is a public 
water supply reservoir under the ownership of Welsh Water.  
Flood Risk 
9.6.16 
In its response to PINS’ consultation on the Scoping Report, NRW 
states that the Project Site is in Flood Zone A.  A flood zone A is 
considered to be an area at little or no risk of fluvial or tidal / coastal 
flooding.  It is used within the precautionary framework to indicate that 
there is no need to consider flood risk further.   
9.6.17 
Nevertheless due to the size of the Project, flood risk will be explored in 
more detail within a standalone FRA which will be presented as an 
Appendix to the proposed DCO Application.

Gas Connection –water crossings 
9.6.18 
Neither of the proposed Gas Connection route corridor options require 
a crossing under a large watercourse.  Route corridor 1 requires 
crossing three  field drains.  These field drains are all located on 
agricultural land to the south and east of the Power Generation Plant 
Site.  Gas Connection route corridor option 2 requires the crossing of 
one filed drain,  
Electrical Connection –water crossings 
9.6.19 
Neither of the Electrical Connection route corridor options would cross 
any watercourses.  
9.6.20 
Route corridor option 1 would cross over a waterlogged area to the 
north and west of the Power Generation Plant Site. However, this 
would be via an overhead line and hence there would be no direct 
impact on the waterlogged area.  
9.6.21 
Route corridor 2 runs alongside existing roads in the Hirwaun Industrial 
Estate. Although direct ground disturbance would be required to 
excavate the trench for the underground cable, the route corridor is not 
in close proximity to any watercourses.  
Conceptual Site Model 
9.6.22 
Table 9.6 below, is a tabular representation of a conceptual site model 
(CSM).  The CSM is a representation of the potential pollutant linkages 
for the construction / demolition, operation and decommissioning 
phases of the Project. It is noted here that this CSM is based on the 
preliminary assessment presented in this PEIR and will be updated as 
part of the ongoing EIA studies.  
9.6.23 
The CSM  shows that potential impacts on watercourses in the vicinity 
of the Project could arise from  unknown contaminants which are 
already present within the soil and the accidental spillage of liquids 
including diesel and oil.  Potential pathways of these pollutants from the 
source to the receptor include surface water runoff and the pipeline 
crossing.  Potential receptors at the Project Site include local surface 
water courses, the secondary A aquifer, water treatment plant and site 
workers.

The table above is useful to show the potential pollutant linkages 
however it does not predict the likelihood of their occurrence.  It is 
anticipated that there is a very minimal risk that any of the pathways 
listed in the table above will be created. At this stage, it appears 
unlikely that piling would be required for foundation preparation. 
However, even if it was, due to the depth of the overlying unproductive 
strata, piling for foundations is very unlikely to reach the principal 
aquifer. Even if piling to these depths was required, mitigation 
measures, such as those set out by “Piling and penetrative ground 
improvement methods on land affected by contamination Guidance on 
pollution prevention - NGWCLC Report NC/99/73” would mean that no 
pathway for pollutants will be created.  On-site the surface water runoff 
will be captured by the surface water drainage system thus no 
contaminated runoff will be created.  These can be considered as 
embedded mitigation measures.  
9.6.25 
Other embedded mitigation measures will include the industry standard 
methods and procedures to ensure impacts from construction / 
demolition, operation and decommissioning are minimised. These 
include:  
� 
Any surface water contaminated by hydrocarbons to be passed 
through oil/grit interceptors prior to discharge;

- 197 - 
 
 
� 
Measures will be taken to ensure that no leachate, or any surface 
water that has the potential to be contaminated, will be allowed to 
enter directly or indirectly any water course, underground strata or 
adjoining land; 
� 
Water inflows to excavated areas will be minimised by the use of 
lining materials, good housekeeping techniques and by the control 
of drainage and construction materials in order to prevent the 
contamination of ground water.  Site personnel will be made aware 
of the potential impact on ground and surface water associated with 
certain aspects of the construction works to further reduce the 
incidence of accidental impacts; 
� 
Refuelling of construction vehicles and equipment will be restricted 
to a designated area with properly designed fuel tanks and bunds 
and suitable operating procedures.  
� 
Siting of stockpiles a minimal distance from watercourses to avoid 
pollution runoff and adhering to best practice working guidelines to 
avoid spillages near watercourses;  
� 
All oil and chemical storage tanks and areas where drums are 
stored will be surrounded by an impermeable bund. Single tanks 
will be within bunds sized to contain 110 per cent of capacity and 
multiple tanks or drums will be within bunds sized to contain the 
greater of 110 per cent of the capacity of the largest tank or 
25 per cent of the total tanks contents; and 
� 
During operation, NRW will set limits on the quality of water that is 
discharged from the Project Site under the Environmental Permit. 
The need, or otherwise for further, specific mitigation measures will 
be determined through the EIA process. 
9.6.26 
The British Standard Code of Practice for Earthworks BS 6031:2009 
contains detailed methods that should be considered for the general 
control of drainage on construction sites. Further advice is also 
available in the British Standard Code of Practice for Foundations 
BS 8004: 1986. These will be taken into account.  
9.7 
Preliminary Assessment of Potential Impacts 
Power Generation Plant 
Construction / Demolition  
9.7.2 
During construction and demolition, potential impacts on water 
resources could be due to: 
� 
Water use for construction / demolition activities / hygiene; and 
 
 
 
Hirwaun Power Project Preliminary

- 198 - 
 
 
� 
Creation of pathways to receptors including the Secondary A 
Aquifer and the Source Protection Zone 1.  
9.7.3 
A small amount of water will be required each day for the construction 
and demolition works (e.g. wheel washing and dust suppression) and 
hygiene.  This water will likely be brought in by tanker or the existing 
mains water supply which already serves the International Greetings 
Warehouse will be used, and therefore no surface water or 
groundwater abstraction will be required. There will therefore be no 
impact on these resources as a result of water requirement during 
construction or demolition.  
9.7.4 
Construction or demolition activities could require the disposal of water 
from the Power Generation Plant Site.  Therefore all construction 
contractors will be required, in conjunction with HPL, to reach an 
agreement with NRW with regard to detailed methods of disposal. 
9.7.5 
Based on preliminary information and similar construction sites, it is 
likely that this water will either be treated and discharged to existing site 
drainage (as used currently by the existing industrial units at the Power 
Generation Plant Site) or it will be collected and tankered away.  
9.7.6 
Construction / demolition activities, if uncontrolled, could potentially 
cause leaching to surface waters due to the creation of soil piles 
formed during excavation, levelling and other such on-site works.  
Impacts could include the potential pollution or silting up of surrounding 
watercourses.  Despite this, working to best practice construction 
methods and embedded mitigation measures, (as outlined in Section 
9.4) will mean that these impacts would not occur from construction 
activities. Their impacts would therefore be negligible.  
9.7.7 
During construction or demolition, if it is necessary to install a 
temporary diesel storage tank for onsite construction machinery, 
generators etc. on-site this will be double-skinned and/or contained with 
an impermeable bund sized to hold 110 per cent of the total tank 
contents for the prevention of releases to the environment. 
Maintenance of construction machinery, on-site, will be forbidden 
outside suitably kerbed or bunded areas to prevent the accidental 
leakage of lubricating and hydraulic fluids. Therefore the impact of 
accidental spillages during construction will be negligible.  
9.7.8 
The River Camnant is thought to be culverted under the Power 
Generation Plant Site. However, at this stage in the Project, given the 
level of assessment undertaken to date, the potential impacts on this 
river cannot be assessed with any certainty.  A Water Framework 
Directive report will be carried out on this water course and will predict 
any potential impacts.

9.7.9 
There is a peat bog / waterlogged marsh area to the north west of the 
Power Generation Plant Site, close to the location of the Rhigos 
substation. The area is known to support a wide range of floral and 
faunal species, which depend on its sensitive hydrology. No impacts on 
the hydrology of this area are anticipated as no works will take place 
within this area.  
9.7.10 
Given the above, and the lack of any surface water bodies within the 
vicinity of the Power Generation Plant Site, the preliminary findings are 
that the impacts from construction of the Power Generation Plant and 
demolition of existing buildings would be negligible.   
Operation 
9.7.11 
The largest operational demand for water in the majority of UK power 
stations is cooling.  However the Power Generation Plant will be air 
cooled therefore minimal quantities of water will be required for 
operational purposes.  
9.7.12 
Water use at the Power Generation Plant Site will be limited to potable 
water for drinking and sanitation purposes.  Domestic/sanitary water 
use will be approximately 200 litres per person per day (c. 30 m3/day).  
An existing mains water supply already provides the International 
Greetings storage and distribution warehouse with mains water for 
toilets, kitchens etc. It is therefore envisaged that this water supply will 
continue to be used during operation of the Power Generation Plant for 
the same purposes. It is likely that a similar number of construction 
workers would be employed at the Power Generation Plant Site to the 
number employed at the International Greetings facility. Therefore the 
water requirement should be similar.  
9.7.13 
The Power Generation Plant Site will be equipped with a surface water 
drainage system and a sewerage system.  The intricacies of these 
systems will be confirmed within the detailed design stage.  It is 
anticipated at this stage that the on-site sewerage system will connect 
to the main sewerage network and that the surface water drainage 
system will also drain into this network.  The surface water drainage 
system will discharge into the existing drainage network at the Power 
Generation Plant Site. It is not anticipated that an attenuation pond will 
be required as the Power Generation Plant Site will not change greatly 
in composition compared to its current condition (e.g. covered in hard 
standing and buildings) and therefore there will be very little change to 
the surface water run-off rate.  Despite this, an attenuation pond is 
shown on Figure 4.1 as the final drainage requirements are still being 
assessed, and in order to show the maximum likely extent of the Power 
Generation Plant. It is not anticipated that surface water drainage will 
require specialist treatment for oils etc.  Surface water drainage will be

uncontaminated and typical of surface water runoff from areas of hard 
standing and roads.  Before reaching the main sewerage network the 
runoff will pass through oil interceptors / filters. 
9.7.14 
Along with the existing drainage systems on the Power Generation 
Plant Site, an assessment of the potential for the application of 
sustainable urban drainage system (SUDS) at the Project will be 
investigated to improve on the current drainage regime. SUDS would, if 
feasible, be used to retain non-contaminated surface water on-site and 
released at a controlled and sustainable rate to the existing local 
drainage ditches or soakaways.  The feasibility and design of any 
SuDS will be agreed in advance with NRW. 
9.7.15 
For NOx control it is anticipated that the Power Generation plant will 
require a worst case scenario of 69 m3 per hour. Assuming a water 
tank on the Power Generation Plant Site capable of storing 6000 m3, 
there is enough capacity for up to 3.6 days continuously running the 
plant, 24 hrs per day. However, as the plant will operate in ‘peaking 
mode’ (anticipated at <1500 hrs per year) the maximum potential water 
use required for NOx control will be approximately 103,000m3 per year. 
9.7.16 
The water used for NOx control will all be used up during the process, 
and therefore no residual water will be discharged.  
9.7.17 
Due to the intermittent water demand of the Power Generation Plant, all 
water will be tankered to the Power Generation Plant Site and stored in 
water storage tanks adjacent to the administration buildings.  
9.7.18 
Occasionally (approximately monthly) it will be necessary to wash the 
blades of the air compressor section of the gas turbine to remove 
debris that has penetrated the air inlet filters and become lodged on the 
compressor blades.  This will be done at times when the performance 
of the gas turbine has degraded and will depend on the air quality in the 
vicinity of the proposed Project Site.   
9.7.19 
Washing can be done in two ways, either: 
� 
On-line washing where a fine spray of water is allowed to pass 
through the gas turbine; or, 
� 
Off-line washing where the compressor blades are rotated slowly 
through a detergent solution. 
9.7.20 
Any water generated during washing will be retained on the Power 
Generation Plant Site in a storage tank and subsequently tanked off-
site by a licensed contractor for disposal at an appropriately licensed 
disposal facility.

9.7.21 
The anticipated water requirement for washing will be of the order of 
11.5 m3 per week.  
Decommissioning 
9.7.22 
During decommissioning, temporary impacts to water quality are likely 
to arise.  These will be similar to those described above for 
construction.   
Gas Connection Route Corridor Option 1 
Construction 
9.7.23 
Gas Connection Route Corridor option 1 requires the crossing of three 
minor field drains.  The exact construction methods used to cross these 
drains has not yet been determined and it is likely that this will need to 
be done in consultation with the landowner. It could be that these fields 
drains are re-routed or it could be that the pipeline is laid under these 
drains.  However, no matter what construction method is used, due 
care and attention will be paid so that no potential pollutant pathways 
are opened up which could impact on the field drains. As for 
construction of the Power Generation Plant, best practice will be 
followed including the implementation of a CEMP.  
9.7.24 
Prior to operation, the gas pipeline will be hydrostatically tested by 
closing off the ends, filling it with water and increasing the pressure to a 
pre-determined level higher than the pressure at which it is designed to 
operate.   
9.7.25 
The water used during hydrostatic testing would likely be tankered in 
and will subsequently be discharged in accordance with approved 
method statements and discussions with NRW following hydrostatic 
testing the water may be slightly contaminated with particles such as 
small metal fragments, dust or welding deposits.   
9.7.26 
Based on the above it is considered that construction of Gas 
Connection option 1 will have a negligible impact on water quality.  
Operation  
9.7.27 
As the Gas connection would be a buried pipeline, once operational, 
the pipeline will have no impacts on any surrounding waterbodies or 
ground water.  Furthermore, there is no operational water requirement 
for this element of the Project.  
9.7.28 
As such, the findings of this preliminary assessment are that Gas 
Conection Route Corridor Option 1 would have negligible impacts on 
the Water Resources of the area.

Decommissioning  
9.7.29 
Following the decommissioning of the Power Generation Plant, it is 
anticipated that the gas connection pipe will be left in-situ, as removal 
of the pipe would cause more environmental disruption than leavingit in 
place.  
9.7.30 
As such, there are no decommissioning acivitise for this element of the 
Project which would require water and as such the impacts on Water 
Resources are negligible. 
Gas Connection Route Corridor Option 2 
Construction, operation and decommissioning 
9.7.31 
Gas Connection Route Corridor Option 2 requires crossing of one 
minor field drain.  There are not anticipated to be any significant 
differences between the impacts of the Gas Connection for 
construction, operation or decommissioning.  
Electrical Connection Route Corridor option 1 
9.7.32 
Electrical Connection route corridor option 1 does not cross any water 
bodies. It does cross over a waterlogged and marshy area to the north 
and west of the Power Generation Plant. However, route corridor option 
1 will be an overhead line and therefore no direct impacts to 
watercourses 
are 
anticipated. 
Neither 
the 
operational 
nor 
decommissioning phases require water.  
9.7.33 
Therefore there will be no impacts on wtare quality or resources 
resulting from Electrical Connection route corridor option 1.  
Electrical Connection Route Corridor option 2 
9.7.34 
Electrical Connection route corridor option 2 does not cross any water 
bodies.  Therefore there will be no  impacts on water resources as a 
result of this Electrical Connection option.  
9.8 
Potential Mitigation / Management Techniques 
Power Generation Plant 
9.8.2 
During construction / demolition mitigation measures would be covered 
by the Construction Environmental Management Plan (CEMP).  
9.8.3 
No further mitigation measures, above and beyond those outlined in 
Section 9.6 are considered necessary at this stage, although this will be 
re-assessed as part of the ES.

GEOLOGY, GROUND CONDITIONS AND HYDROGEOLOGY 
10.1 
Introduction 
10.1.1 
This section of the PEIR details the baseline geological and 
hydrogeological conditions at the Project Site and outlines the 
preliminary potential environmental impacts of the Project on these 
resources. It also details the status of the Project Site in terms of 
contamination and the risks posed to human health (particularly future 
site users). Where potentially significant impacts have been identified, 
mitigation measures have been proposed to reduce the severity of such 
impacts to an acceptable level.   
10.2 
Legislative and Policy Context 
National Policy Statements (NPS) 
10.2.2 
As explained in Section 2, the NPS EN-1 explains the assessment 
principles to which the SoS will have regard in the examination of an 
energy NSIP (such as the proposed Project), and explains the generic 
impacts with regard to energy infrastructure.  Specific considerations 
for fossil fuel generating stations are provided in the NPS for Fossil 
Fuel Generating Infrastructure (EN-2). The NPSs for Gas and Oil 
Pipelines (EN-4) and Electricity Networks Infrastructure (EN-5) provide 
specific considerations potentially relevant to the Gas Connection and 
Electrical 
Connection 
Compound 
and 
Electrical 
Connection 
respectively. 
10.2.3 
The relevant assessment principles in terms of generic impacts 
(‘Biodiversity and Geological Conservation’ and ‘Land Use including 
Open Space, Green Infrastructure and Green Belt’ and ‘Waste 
Management’) from Part 5 of NPS EN-1 (Generic Impacts) are set out 
below: 
NPS EN-1:  
Generic 
Impacts 
– 
Biodiversity 
and 
Geological 
Conservation 
10.2.4 
Under Applicant’s Assessment (Paragraphs 5.3.3 to 5.3.4): 
“Where the development is subject to an EIA the applicant should 
ensure that the ES clearly sets out any effects on internationally, 
nationally and locally designated sites of ecological and geological 
conservation importance, on protected species and on habitats and 
other species identified as being of principal importance for the 
conservation of biodiversity.....

10.2.5 
The applicant should show how the project has taken advantage of 
opportunities to conserve and enhance biodiversity and geological 
conservation interests”. 
NPS EN-1:  Generic Impacts – Land Use including Open Space, Green 
Infrastructure and Green Belt 
10.2.6 
Under Applicant’s Assessment (Paragraphs 5.10.8 to 5.10.9): 
10.2.7 
Applicants should seek to minimise impacts on the best and most 
versatile agricultural land (defined as Grades 1, 2 and 3a of the 
Agricultural Land Classification) and preferably use land in area of 
poorer quality (Grades 3b, 4 and 5) except where this would be 
inconsistent with other sustainability considerations.  Applicants should 
also identify any effects and seek to minimise impacts on soil quality 
taking into account any mitigation measures propose.  
For 
developments on previously developed land, applicants should ensure 
that they have considered the risk posed by land contamination.   
10.2.8 
Applicants should safeguard any mineral resources on the proposed 
site as far as possible, taking into account the long-term potential of the 
land use after any future decommissioning has taken place.  
NPS EN – 2 Fossil Fuel Electricity Generating Infrastructure  
10.2.9 
Paragraph 1.7.2 of NPS EN-2 states that “effects on geology and soils 
are likely to be localised and limited”. 
NPS EN-4:  Gas Supply Infrastructure and Gas and Oil Pipelines 
10.2.10 
Section 2.23 of EN-4 discusses the potential impacts on soil and 
geology and recognises the importance of understanding the 
underlying soil conditions and geology.  This section states that 
applicants should assess the stability of ground conditions via a 
desktop study and if necessary new borehole data.  It also states that 
the assessment should cover options considered for installing pipelines 
and weigh up impacts of means of installation.  
NPS EN-5 Electricity Supply Infrastructure  
10.2.11 
NPS EN-5 includes limited information regarding impacts on geology, 
although Paragraph 2.8.9 recognises that an underground line is likely 
to have more potential impacts on geology and soils than an overhead 
line.

Environmental Protection Act 1990 
10.2.12 
Part 2A of the Environmental Protection act (EPA) 1990 deals with 
contaminated land.  The contaminated land regime within Part 2A was 
first introduced in Wales on the 15th September 2001 and was inserted 
into the EPA 1990 by Section 57 of the Environment Act 1995. 
10.2.13 
The EPA 1990 defines contaminated land as “any land which appears 
to the local authority in whose area it is situated to be in such a 
condition, by reason of substance in, on or under the land, that –  
a) Significant harm is being caused or there is a significant possibility 
of such harm being caused; or  
b) Pollution of controlled waters is being or is likely to be caused.” 
10.2.14 
The contaminated land scheme provides guidance on what is 
considered to be contaminated land.  Furthermore it requires the local 
enforcing authority to require remediation of this land and to identify the 
appropriate person to bear the responsibility for this.  
Regional and Local Planning Policy 
10.2.15 
The Rhondda Cynon Taf Local Development Plan 2006-2021 was 
adopted in March 2011.  It sets out how the county borough will be 
developed over 15 years.  The policy sets out several Welsh Strategies 
that were considered in the development of the plan: 
10.2.16 
The Rhondda Cynon Taf Local Development Plan contains policies 
which should be considered when making a planning application.  
Those policies relevant to geology, ground contamination and 
hydrogeology include the following. 
Policy CS10 – Minerals 
10.2.17 
This policy states that the council will seek to protect resources without 
compromising environmental and social issues.  Techniques it will 
employ to ensure this are: 
� 
Maintaining a minimum 10 year landbank of permitted rock 
aggregate reserves; 
� 
Defining safeguarding areas for mineral resources; 
� 
Where proven resources are under threat from sterilisation by 
necessary development, the pre-working of the mineral will be 
encouraged; and

� 
Promoting efficient usage, minimising production of waste and 
promoting alternatives, amongst others. 
Policy AW 8 – Protection and enhancement of the Natural Environment 
10.2.18 
This policy aims to preserve Rhondda Cynon Taf’s distinctive natural 
heritage by enhancing and protecting its features.  
Policy AW 10 – Environmental Protection and Public Health 
10.2.19 
This policy states that proposals will not be permitted where they would 
cause or result in a risk of unacceptable harm to health and /or local 
amenity because of contamination, landfill gas, land instability, water 
pollution and flooding etc. unless it can be demonstrated that measures 
can be taken to overcome any significant adverse risk to public health, 
the environment and/or any impact upon local amenity. 
Policy AW12 – Renewable & Non-Renewable Energy 
10.2.20 
This policy states that proposals which promote the provision of energy 
will be permitted where it can be demonstrated that there is no 
unacceptable effect  upon the interests of soil conservation, agriculture, 
nature conservation, wildlife, natural and cultural heritage, landscape 
importance, public health and residential amenity.  Development 
proposals should be designed to minimise resource use during 
construction, operation and maintenance.   
Policy AW14 – Safeguarding of Minerals 
10.2.21 
The policy states that the following mineral resources shall be 
safeguarded from any development which would unnecessarily sterilise 
them or hinder their extraction: sand and gravel, coal and limestone.  
Those resources protected are detailed in a resources map contained 
within the Local Development Plan documentation.  
10.3 
Realistic Worst Case Scenario for Assessment 
10.3.1 
In respect of geology, ground conditions and hydrogeology, the realistic 
worst case scenario from within the proposed Project parameters 
(which are described in Section 4 of the PEIR) are set out in Table 10.1 
below.

10.3.2 
The different options for the configuration of the Power Generation 
Plant have little bearing on the impact to geology, ground conditions 
and hydrogeology. Five separate units will have marginally more land 
take than a smaller number of units. However, as the Power 
Generation Plant Site will need to be covered in hard standing and the 
existing buildings demolished regardless of the number of units, the 
impacts arising from the Power Generation Plant on geology, ground 
conditions 
and 
hydrogeology 
are 
similar 
for 
each 
potential 
configuration.   
10.3.3 
A preliminary assessment of both options for the Gas Connection and 
the Electrical Connection is presented in this section. A decision on the 
preferred option for each will be taken following consultation. 
10.4 
Assessment Methodology and Significance Criteria 
10.4.1 
The assessment undertaken considered both an Inner Study Area and 
an Outer Study Area.  The Inner Study Area refers to the likely Power 
Generation Plant Site footprint and “working width” of the Electrical and 
Gas Connection.  The Outer Study Area refers to a boundary of up to 
1 km from the centre of the Project Site in which potentially polluting 
activities could impact on the Project Site.   
10.4.2 
The assessment has been undertaken with a clear understanding of 
the following: 
� 
Previous land uses;  
� 
Underlying ground conditions; 
� 
Existing physical baseline conditions;  
� 
Proposals for the Project;  
� 
Importance of receptors and their sensitivity to change;  
� 
The magnitude of change likely to result from the Project; and 
� 
Potential to mitigate any impacts resulting from the Project 
10.4.3 
The previous land uses / underlying ground conditions / existing 
physical baseline conditions have been assessed with reference to the 
following:

Standards and Guidance  
10.4.4 
The following Standards and guidance have been consulted to provide 
advice on best practice mitigation measures which will be employed 
during the construction / demolition phase of the Project and the correct 
methods of assessment of potentially contaminated sites.  
10.4.5 
BS 6031 (2009) provides best practice guidance on geotechnical 
aspects of earthworks and on working practices.  The standard also 
includes recommendations and guidance for un-reinforced earthworks 
forming part of general civil engineering construction, together with 
provisions for temporary excavations such as trenches and pits.   
10.4.6 
Technical guidance relating to land contamination is presented in a 
series of documents known as the Contaminated Land Report (CLRs 1 
to 6 and 11) published by the EA.  The guidance promotes a tiered 
approach to the assessment of contamination and associated risks.  
The baseline conditions of the Project Site have been assessed with 
specific reference to CLR 11: Model Procedures for the Management of 
Land Contamination (2004).   
10.4.7 
British Drilling Association document ‘Guidance for Safe Intrusive 
Activities on Contaminated or Potentially Contaminated Land’ (BDA, 
2008).

Significance Criteria  
10.4.8 
To determine the significance of impact, Tables 10.2 and 10.3 are first 
used to (respectively) define the importance (sensitivity) of the receptor 
and the magnitude of change.  Table 10.4 is then used to determine the 
significance of the impact, taking into account the importance of the 
receptor and the magnitude of change.   
10.4.9 
In addition, a ‘Conceptual Site Model’ approach has been used to 
assess the potential risks posed by contaminants to human health 
using a ‘Source � Pathway � Receptor’ model based on the following: 
� 
Source (which describes the potential source of contamination); 
� 
Pathway (which describes the means by which contamination can 
reach and impact upon a receptor); and 
� 
Receptor (which describes the receptors who may be adversely 
affected by the presence of contamination).

Consultation 
10.5.1 
A summary of the consultation responses received to date in relation to 
geology, ground conditions and hydrogeology, and how these 
responses have been considered is provided in Table 10 in Appendix A 
of this PEIR.   
10.6 
Baseline Conditions and Receptors 
Site History 
10.6.2 
A series of historical maps have been analysed, dating between 1884 
and 2013, to assess the historical development of the Project Site.  
10.6.3 
The earliest map from 1884-1885 shows the entire proposed redline 
boundary of the Project as undeveloped open fields, surrounded by 
waterlogged, marshy ground. A railway line runs approximately 100m 
north of the Power Generation Plant Site boundary / Electrical 
Connection route corridor 1. A road runs to the south of the Power 
Generation Plant and through the northerly area of Gas Connection 
route corridors 1 and 2. It is not named on the map, but is in the current 
location of Main Avenue.  The area in the north western part of the 
Power Generation Plant Site, close to the Electrical Connection route 
corridor options is labelled as the ‘Site of a Battle’. Approximately 150m 
west of Gas Connection route corridor option 1 is an air shaft 
(presumably linked to a deep coal mine). Two expanses of water, 
Hirwaun Pond and New Pond are shown approximately 100m east of 
Gas Connection route corridor option 2 and an engine house is named 
adjacent to Gas Connection route corridor option 2.  
10.6.4 
The next maps from 1900-1905 show the route of an ‘old tramway’ 
which runs east to west across the northern part of the Gas Connection 
route corridor options, just to the south of the Power Generation Plant

Site boundary. It is shown on previous maps, but not named. A 
tramway is also shown running north to south through the eastern most 
part of Gas Connection route corridor option 2. The engine house 
shown on previous maps is now re-named as a disused brick works. 
Several springs are also shown in the vicinity of the Project Site . A 
series of small buildings are shown approximately 500m north east of 
the Power Generation Plant Site boundary and are named as Ty-
Newydd.  
10.6.5 
Maps from 1921 show the development of Penderyn Reservoir 
approximately 250m north of the Power Generation Plant Site boundary 
and a cemetery approximately 300m north west of Gas Connection 
route corridor 2.  
10.6.6 
Maps from 1951-1953 show an extensive amount of development in 
the vicinity of the Project compared with previous maps. Within the 
southern part of the Power Generation Plant Site boundary are several 
industrial buildings, although they are not named. It is highly likely that 
these buildings relate to the former use of the Power Generation Plant 
Site as a Royal Naval Armaments Storage depot (as outlined in Section 
4 of the PEIR). Typically, sensitive military sites such as these are not 
named on OS maps for security reasons. The previously unnamed road 
running through the northern part of the Gas Connection route corridors 
is now named as the A465. Within the north eastern part of the Gas 
Connection route corridor option 2 are several large industrial buildings, 
however, these are not named. There are also a number of small 
buildings present to the west of the Power Generation Plant Site 
boundary which are not named either.  
10.6.7 
By 1964, the industrial buildings are now named as Hirwaun Industrial 
Estate and are labelled as ‘works’. By 1981 the majority of the buildings 
are labelled as factories.  
10.6.8 
Maps from 2006 and 2013 show the Project Site as it currently exists.  
Landscape and Topography 
10.6.9 
The Power Generation Plant Site is predominantly flat and is currently 
occupied by a large industrial warehouse building surrounded by 
hardstanding and scrub grassland. The proposed route corridors of 
both Gas Connection options are also predominantly flat.  Route 
corridor 1 is sited predominantly on agricultural land, although it is likely 
that a total of three  minor field drains would need to be crossed.  Route 
Corridor 2 mainly runs alongside roads (Main Avenue and Rhigos 
Road) and requires one field drain crossing at the southern end of the 
route.

10.6.10 
Electrical Connection route corridor 1 would be an overhead line, which 
would pass above an area of waterlogged / marshy grassland to the 
north west of the Power Generation Plant Site. Route corridor option 2 
would run alongside roads and between buildings on the Hirwaun 
Industrial Estate. 
10.6.11 
 As shown on Ordnance Survey Maps of the area, the boundary of the 
Project Site lies between approximately 200 - 230 m Above Ordnance 
Datum (AOD) and land rises slightly from north to south across the 
redline boundary.   
Geology and Soils 
10.6.12 
At this stage, a desk based assessment using BGS 1:50,000 scale 
maps of the area has been undertaken to assess the nature and extent 
of the geological deposits underlying the Power Generation Plant Site 
and Gas and Electrical Connection route corridor options.  
10.6.13 
Previous Site investigations undertaken at the Rhigos Substation – 
adjacent to the Power generation Plant and Electrical Connection route 
corridor options have also been studied.  
Bedrock Geology 
10.6.14 
The Power Generation Plant Site, Gas Connection route corridors and 
Electrical Connection route corridor options  are all underlain by the 
‘South Wales Lower Coal Measures’ formation. This formation is 
described as Grey, (productive) coal-bearing mudstones/siltstones, with 
seatearths and minor sandstones.  
10.6.15 
In addition to the above it is noted that the bedrock underlying the 
Project Site is scattered with geological faults.  A fault is a discontinuity 
along which rock units are displaced.  The majority of these faults are 
orientated in an approximately north west to south easterly direction. 
10.6.16 
However, it is noted that geological faults are found all over the UK, 
and the presence of geological faults within these bedrock formations 
at this location is not unusual.  Due to the depth of these faults they are 
unlikely to cause subsidence within the superficial deposits.   
10.6.17 
The bedrock aquifer is classified by the Environment Agency as a 
Secondary Aquifer A.  This means the bedrock has permeable layers 
capable of supporting water supplies at a local rather than strategic 
scale, and in some cases forming an important source of base flow to 
rivers.

- 222 - 
 
 
10.6.18 
The groundwater vulnerability across the majority of the Project Site is 
classified as low, this is due to the fact that the overlying soils have a 
low leaching potential in which pollutants are unlikely to penetrate the 
soil layer because water movement is largely horizontal or they have a 
large ability to attenuate diffuse pollutants.  Lateral flow from these soils 
contribute to groundwater recharge elsewhere in the catchment.  
However in the south west corner of the Project Site it is classified as 
unknown therefore a worst case scenario of high is assumed until 
proven otherwise.   
10.6.19 
The soils at the Project Site are described below in more detail.  
Superficial Geology 
10.6.20 
Superficial deposits are the most recent, unconsolidated geological 
deposits of the Quaternary age.  The superficial deposits covering a 
small area in the centre of the Power Generation Plant Site and the 
majority of the Gas Connection route corridor options is Devensian Till 
– a diamicton which includes a mixture of clay, sands and gravels.   
10.6.21 
The majority of the Power Generation Plant Site and Electrical 
Connection route corridor options are covered by Peat deposits 
(waterlogged organic material).    
10.6.22 
Additionally, an area immediately south west of the Power Generation 
Plant Site is classed as made ground, as is an area immediately east of 
Gas Connection route corridor option 2. It is likely that these areas of 
made ground result from previous landfilling activities, which are 
discussed in more detail below.  
10.6.23 
The superficial aquifer designation across the Project Site is classed as 
‘unproductive strata’. 
Soils 
10.6.24 
The Soilscape website identifies that the soil across the majority of the 
Project Site is a slowly permeable wet and very acid upland soil with a 
peaty surface.  It has impeded drainage and low fertility.   
10.6.25 
The south west corner of the Project Site is dominated by a soil 
comprising of restored soils mostly from quarry and opencast spoil.  
This soil has variable drainage and low to moderate fertility.  The 
presence of this soil has lead to the adoption of the worst case scenario 
of high groundwater vulnerability being attributed to this area of the 
Project Site as the leaching potential of this soil is relatively unknown.

Summary 
10.6.26 
The importance of the geology and soils within the Power Generation 
Plant Site have been assessed as being of low / negligible importance 
given that the land is brownfield / hardstanding. Along Gas Connection 
Route corridor option 1 and Route corridor option 2, the soils / geology 
have been assessed as Medium for both, given that although some of 
the route may pass through greenfield land, it is not the best quality, 
most fertile agricultural land based on soils descriptions. 
10.6.27 
For Electrical Connection route corridor option 1, geology and soils are 
not considered, as this will be an overhead line and there will be no 
direct impacts outside of the Power Generation Plant Site boundary,  
10.6.28 
The geology and soils of Electrical Connection route corridor option 2 
have been assessed as being of low / negligible importance given that 
the land is brownfield / hardstanding.  
Mining and Ground Stability 
10.6.29 
A Coal Authority Report for the proposed Project Site was acquired.   
10.6.30 
No BGS mineral sites were recorded within the Project Site.  Within the 
outer study area four mineral sites were recorded within 400 m of the 
Project Site.  All of the sites have now ceased operation.  The 
commodities at these sites include opencast sandstone, underground 
coal and two sites of underground iron ore.  
10.6.31 
Two radon affected areas are highlighted within the Project Site.  The 
first area is directly to the east of the Power Generation Plant.  This 
area is classified as a radon affected area where between 1 and 3% of 
homes are above the action level
25.  The second area is directly to the 
south of the Power Generation Plant and is classified as a lower 
probability radon area where less than 1% of homes are above the 
action level.  
10.6.32 
The Envirocheck report contains some details of historical extractive 
activities.  A summary of these activities is as follows: 
                                                   
25
 Public Health England recommends that radon levels should be reduced in homes where the average is more than 200 
becquerels per metre cubed (200 Bq m
-3). This recommendation has been endorsed by the Government.  
 
This Action Level refers to the annual average concentration in a home, so radon measurements are carried out with two 
detectors (in a bedroom and living room) over three months, to average out short-term fluctuations.

� 
Extractive industries activities from 1950-1960 are marked in the

� 
Extractive industries activities 1855-1909 are marked in the south 
western corner of the Project boundary. 
� 
Extractive industries activities from 1906-1937 and 1855-1909 in 
the eastern tip of the Project boundary. 
10.6.33 
These extractive activities include, but are not limited to: unspecified 
pit, unspecified deposit material, Tir-herbert Brick Works, Well etc. 
10.6.34 
Along the western edge of the Project Site, general quarrying is marked 
on the map.  This land is also marked as potentially infilled (made 
ground). 
10.6.35 
As indicated in the consultation response Table, (Table 10 in Appendix 
A), the response provided by the Coal Authority to the Scoping Report 
stated that the Project was to be located within the development high 
risk area.  More details of coal mining in the area, taken from a Coal 
Authority Report are given below. 
Underground Coal Mining 
10.6.36 
The Coal Authority report identifies three disused mineshafts within the 
southern tip of the Project Site.  Nevertheless it states that according to 
their records the property is not within a zone of likely physical 
influence on the surface from past underground workings.  It is within 
an area where the Coal Authority believes there is coal at or close to 
the surface.  The area is in the likely zone of influence from workings in 
1 seam of fireclay at shallow depth last worked in 1856.  Fireclay was 
traditionally used for making bricks. At present the area is not within the 
likely zone of influence of any underground coal workings.  The Coal 
Authority states that the area is not one for which the Authority is 
determining whether to grant a licence or where a licence has been 
granted to remove coal using underground methods.  Nevertheless, 
reserves of coal exist in the local area which could be worked 
sometime in the future. 
Opencast Coal Mining 
10.6.37 
The Coal Authority report states that in the past the area was within the 
boundary of an opencast site from which coal has been removed.  
Currently, the Project Site lies within 200m of the boundary of the 
Tower Colliery Reclamation Site from which coal is being removed by 
opencast methods.

Ground Stability / Subsidence 
10.6.38 
No notice of the risk of the land being affected by subsidence has been 
given under section 46 of the Coal Mining Subsidence Act 1991. 
Furthermore the Coal Authority has not received a damage notice or 
claim for the area or any property within 50 m of the Project Site since 
31st October 1994. 
10.6.39 
The Coal Authority is not aware of any evidence of damage arising due 
to geological faults or other lines of weakness that have been affected 
by coal mining.   
10.6.40 
The area has been subject to remedial works, by or on behalf of the 
Authority, under its Emergency Surface Hazard Call Out Procedure.  
The nature or location of these remedial works are not known.  
10.6.41 
A large proportion of the Project Site, including the Power Generation 
Plant Site has a high potential for compressible ground stability 
hazards. 
Landfill History / Contamination 
10.6.42 
Historical landfill sites, licensed waste management facilities, local 
authority recorded landfill sites, registered waste transfer sites, 
registered treatment or disposal sites, control of major accident hazards 
sites, notifications of installations handling hazardous substances and 
planning hazardous substance consents etc. are noted within the 
Envirocheck report.   
10.6.43 
Those which appear within the Project Site are detailed below in Table 
10.5.  
10.6.44 
In addition to these potential sources of contamination, it is also 
recognised that former site uses (e.g. Royal Naval armaments storage 
depot and industrial units) also have the potential to have caused 
historic contamination at the Project Site. All potential sources of 
contamination have been considered together in the CSM in Table 
10.6.

The table details that the potential sources of onsite contamination 
include: historic mining / extractive industries activities, onsite 
contaminants of unknown composition and contaminants from existing 
surrounding installations.  Potential receptors include soils, construction 
workers, and the underlying Secondary Aquifer A with potential 
pathways to these receptors including leaching to surface water, 
dermal contact and inhalation of airborne contaminants due to 
disturbance of the soil.

The table above is useful to show the potential pollutant linkages 
however it does not predict the likelihood of their occurrence.  It is 
anticipated that there is a very minimal risk that any of the pathways 
listed in the table above will be created.  The Project is anticipated to 
incorporate Best Available Techniques (BAT) with regards to 
contaminant containment therefore they are unlikely to be leached into 
the soils. Existing unknown contaminants are unlikely to reach the 
Secondary aquifer A via a preferential pathway provided by piled 
foundations as overlying the bedrock is unproductive strata of over 10m 
in depth.

10.7 
Preliminary Assessment of Potential Impacts 
Construction and Demolition 
Power Generation Plant  
10.7.2 
During construction / demolition works the main potential impacts on 
geology, ground conditions and hydrogeology will be due to: 
� 
Disturbance of existing contamination and the creation of pathways 
to receptors; 
� 
Ground instability from previous mining activities; 
� 
Creation of pollution incidents (e.g. through improperly maintained 
equipment); and 
� 
Disturbance to or loss of important deposits of geology and soils. 
10.7.3 
The Power Generation Plant Site is an existing industrial site covered in 
buildings and hardstanding. The construction of the Power Generation 
Plant is likely to require site remediation in the form of removal of 
existing potentially contaminative materials during demolition (e.g. 
asbestos in existing buildings) upgrading of drainage systems and 
removal / covering of any ground contamination. Construction of the 
Power Generation Plant would not require the removal of any land 
currently used for agriculture. Therefore, based on the preliminary 
assessment undertaken to date (following the assessment criteria 
outlined in Tables 10.2-10.4), there is considered to be a moderate 
beneficial impact on a receptor of low sensitivity, giving an overall minor 
beneficial significance of effect.   
10.7.4 
The depth of the overlying unproductive strata at the site means that 
based on the preliminary assessment undertaken to date, it is very 
unlikely that foundations would be required to be sited within the 
secondary aquifer A. Impacts at this stage are therefore considered 
negligible, although further work will be undertaken as part of the final 
ES.  
10.7.5 
Similarly, the distance from the source protection zone of any 
construction / demolition activities (e.g. over 1.5 km away) means that 
any impacts at this stage are considered to be negligible although 
further work will be undertaken as part of the final ES.  
Electrical connection (Options 1 and 2) 
10.7.6 
The construction of Electrical Connection route corridor 1 is not 
considered to have any impact on geology, soils or hydrogeology asthe 
connection will be an overhead line. . Although some above ground

- 229 - 
 
 
infrastructure would be required, this would be sited within the Power 
Generation Plant Site boundary and no construction would take place 
outside of this, other than at the Rhigos substation.  
10.7.7 
Electrical Connection route corridor option 2 would involve the 
excavation of a narrow trench (of the order of 3m wide) alongside roads 
and in hard standing on the Hirwaun Industrial Estate. This excavation 
will have a minor adverse impact on a receptor of negligible sensitivity. 
Thereby giving rise to an overall negligible significance of effect.  
Gas Connection (Options 1 and 2) 
10.7.8 
The construction of Gas Connection route corridor option 1 will result in 
the temporary sterilisation of agricultural land.  However, this will be a 
relatively narrow corridor (maximum of 30m working width) and any 
impacts would be temporary. There is therefore considered to be a 
minor impact on a receptor of medium sensitivity, thereby giving rise to 
an overall minor significance of effect.  
10.7.9 
The construction of Gas Connection route corridor option 2 would be 
alongside roads and would therefore not result in the sterilisation of any 
agricultural land. Therefore any impacts would be negligible.  
Operation 
10.7.10 
There will be no further disturbance to the underlying soils or geology 
during operation of any elements of the Project, therefore no impacts 
are predicted during operation.  
10.7.11 
Additionally, any necessary land remediation will be undertaken as part 
of the construction phase. Hazardous materials (e.g. asbestos) will be 
removed and the Power Generation Plant Site covered in hardstanding. 
Therefore there are not anticipated to be any remaining pollutant 
linkages remaining during operation.  
10.7.12 
The biggest potential impacts during operation are the risk of ground 
stability issues (e.g. subsidence from previous mining activities and 
chemical attack of foundations).  However, in order to mitigate these 
impacts, a full intrusive ground investigation will be undertaken prior to 
construction which will, inform foundation design.  
Decommissioning 
Power Generation Plant 
10.7.13 
The impacts during decommissioning will be temporary and similar to 
those described above for construction.

10.7.14 
The concrete foundations will likely be left in the ground after 
decommissioning of the Power Generation Plant.  It is common for 
concrete foundations to remain in-situ for many years following 
decommissioning of sites since it creates less disturbance and they 
may be capable of reuse.  The environmental impact of this is predicted 
to be negligible as the foundations will be constructed of an appropriate 
grade of concrete to resist degradation from the soils and groundwater.  
The remaining ground will be reinstated to a condition deemed suitable 
to RCTCBC and HPL at the time and in line with any planning 
requirements imposed as part of the DCO. Therefore  no significant 
impacts are anticipated.  
Gas and Electrical Connection 
10.7.15 
Upon cessation of operation, the Gas and Electrical Connection will be 
disconnected from the NTS / Rhigos substation. It is currently proposed 
that the Gas Pipeline / Electrical Connection option 2 would be left 
buried underground.  They will be constructed of material to withstand 
degradation 
from 
the 
soil 
environment. 
 
Therefore, 
their 
decommissioning is considered to have a negligible impact the on 
geology and soils.  Electrical Connection option 1 would be taken 
down, and there would be no direct impact on geology and soils.  
10.7.16 
Upon cessation of operation, the AGI will likely be decommissioned and 
removed.   
10.7.17 
Impacts on geology and soils are considered to be as for construction.   
10.8 
Potential Mitigation and Monitoring Measures 
Construction / Demolition 
10.8.2 
The construction of the Project and demolition of existing buildings has 
the potential to create impacts relating to human health and 
groundwater quality.  However, providing that the confirmed mitigation 
measures are adhered to, as well as more specific measures, as set 
out below, no significant impacts are anticipated. 
10.8.3 
When assessing the potential impacts relating to the construction of the 
Project, it has been assumed that several confirmed mitigation 
measures will be applied.  These include: working in accordance with 
best practises, maintaining safe working practises and the use of 
correct and appropriate personal protective equipment (PPE).  
10.8.4 
The confirmed mitigation measures will adhere to the following 
documents:

Development of Contaminated Land (HSE, 1991); and 
� 
A Guide to Safe Working on Contaminated Sites, R132 (CIRIA, 
1996). 
10.8.5 
During construction / demolition mitigation measures would be covered 
by the Construction Environmental Management Plan (CEMP) which 
will apply to each of the key elements of the Project.  The CEMP will 
incorporate appropriate mitigation measures that will be approved by 
the relevant authorities and adopted, such that it would be unlikely that 
any impacts would arise during construction.  The CEMP will be 
secured by a requirement attached to the DCO. 
10.8.6 
Specific mitigation measures could include, for example, remediation of 
the Power Generation Plant Site, removal of contamination hotspots or 
further site characterisation and will be determined during further EIA 
works. 
Operation 
10.8.7 
There will be no impacts on geology, ground contamination or 
hydrogeology during operation therefore no mitigation measures are 
deemed necessary.   
10.8.8 
There is the potential that the soil could impact upon the operation of 
the pipeline through chemical attack.  To mitigate against this impact a 
detailed soils assessment will be carried out as part of the pipeline 
design process to ensure the grade of pipe selected is appropriate to 
resist attack.  
10.8.9 
 To prevent any impacts resulting from subsidence (e.g. due to 
underground coal mining), the design of the Gas Pipeline will embrace 
additional Performance Limits further to those included in the Pipeline 
Design Standard IGE/TD/1 for calculation of the allowable Pipeline 
Stress.   
Decommissioning 
10.8.10 
Mitigation measures implemented during decommissioning will be 
similar to those implemented during construction.

LANDSCAPE AND VISUAL IMPACTS 
11.1 
Introduction 
11.1.1 
This Section of the PEIR presents the baseline and methodology for 
the preliminary assessment of potential landscape and visual impacts 
arising from the development of the proposed Project.  
11.1.2 
The location of the Project Site and the study area for the landscape 
and visual impact assessment (LVIA) is shown on Figure 11.1. Areas 
within the study area (a 15km radius from the Project Site) with 
minimum predicted visibility, i.e. where there is no likelihood of 
significant effects, including effects on landscape character types, 
designations, viewpoints, settlements or routes have been ‘scoped out’ 
of the assessment. 
11.1.3 
Some aspects of the proposed Project are likely to have the potential to 
produce both direct and indirect impacts on the landscape resource 
(i.e. landscape elements and character) and on visual receptors during 
construction, operation and decommissioning. This Section will record 
the current baseline data, identify and describe the potential effects, 
assess their significance and consider measures to reduce or offset 
any significant negative effects.  
11.1.4 
Landscape character and resources are considered to be of importance 
in their own right and are valued for their intrinsic qualities irrespective 
of whether they are seen by people.  Effects on the landscape include 
physical changes to the landscape as well as changes to landscape 
character. It may also include effects on areas designated for their 
scenic or landscape qualities at a national, regional or local policy level. 
Effects on visual amenity relate to changes in views and the 
appearance and prominence of a development in those views. Visual 
amenity effects are perceived by people and are therefore clearly 
distinguished from, although closely linked to, effects on landscape 
character. The assessments are considered separate, although linked, 
processes. 
11.1.5 
Effects on the landscape can include physical changes to the 
landscape as well as changes to landscape character.  They may also 
include effects on areas designated for their scenic or landscape 
qualities at a national, regional or local policy level. Effects on visual 
amenity relate to changes to views, and the appearance and 
prominence of the Project in those views. 
11.1.6 
This preliminary assessment has been prepared on the basis of an 
exploratory site visit covering the immediate surroundings and 
extending to approximately 10km from the Project Site. Further site

surveys for the full landscape and visual impact assessment (LVIA) are 
being undertaken and will cover the study area as defined below. 
11.1.7 
This Section of the PEIR presents the status of the landscape and 
visual impact assessment for the Project and includes: 
� 
Relevant landscape planning policy and guidance; 
� 
The assessment methodology proposed for the LVIA including the 
identification of specific sensitive receptors; 
� 
Significance criteria; 
� 
The existing baseline conditions against which the assessment will 
be made; 
� 
An outline of potential impacts from the Project;  
� 
Possible mitigation of potential significant landscape and visual 
impacts; and 
� 
The identification of further data-gathering and consultations 
required to complete this aspect of the ES. 
11.1.8 
A preliminary cumulative assessment is presented in Section 16 of this 
PEIR. A more detailed cumulative assessment will be undertaken 
following further site surveys and will be presented in the ES.  
11.2 
Legislative and Policy Context 
European Landscape Convention 
11.2.1 
The European Landscape Convention (ELC) came into force in 2007 
and is the first international convention to focus specifically on 
landscape issues in order to protect, manage and plan landscapes in 
Europe.  The ELC defines landscape as: 
“An area, as perceived by people, whose character is the result of the 
action and interaction of natural and / or human factors.” 
11.2.2 
The ELC applies to natural, rural, urban and peri-urban areas including 
land, inland water and marine areas.  Its purpose is to promote 
landscape protection, management and planning in relation to all 
landscapes regardless of whether their quality and condition is 
considered outstanding, ordinary or degraded. 
Countryside and Rights of Way Act 2000 
11.2.3 
The Countryside and Rights of Way Act 2000 provides a statutory 
framework for protected landscapes and introduced an additional right 
of access requiring the identification of Open Access Land.

National Policy Statements 
11.2.4 
As explained in Section 2, the NPS EN-1 explains the assessment 
principles to which the SoS will have regard in the examination of an 
energy NSIP (such as the proposed Project), and explains the generic 
landscape and visual impacts with regard to energy infrastructure.  
Specific considerations for fossil fuel generating stations are provided 
in the NPS for Fossil Fuel Generating Infrastructure (EN-2). The NPSs 
for Gas and Oil Pipelines (EN-4) and Electricity Networks Infrastructure 
(EN-5) provide specific considerations potentially relevant to the Gas 
Connection and Electrical Connection Compound and Electrical 
Connection respectively. 
11.2.5 
National policy seeks to protect and enhance environmental quality 
specifically for new energy infrastructure through NPS EN-1.  It 
recognises that nationally significant infrastructure projects will have 
effects on the landscape and that the scale of such projects means 
they will be visible within many miles of the site of the proposed 
infrastructure.  
11.2.6 
Section 5.9 of NPS EN-1 requires, “The applicant’s assessment should 
include the effects during construction of the project and the effects of 
the completed development and its operation on landscape 
components and character. The assessment should include the 
visibility and conspicuousness of the project during construction and of 
the presence and operation of the project and potential impacts on 
views and visual amenity.  This should include light pollution effects, 
including on local amenity, and nature conservation”. 
11.2.7 
With regard to landscape impacts, NPS EN-1 states, “Landscape 
effects depend on the existing character of the local landscape, its 
current quality, how highly it is valued and its capacity to accommodate 
change.  All of these factors need to be considered in judging the 
impact of a project on landscape.  Virtually all nationally significant 
infrastructure projects will have effects on landscape.  Projects need to 
be designed carefully, taking account of the potential impact on the 
landscape.  Having regard to siting, operational and other relevant 
constraints the aim should be to minimise harm to the landscape, 
providing reasonable mitigation where possible and appropriate.” 
11.2.8 
With reference to visual impact NPS EN-1 states, “All proposed energy 
infrastructure is likely to have visual effects for many receptors around 
proposed sites. The [Secretary of State] will have to judge whether the 
visual effects on sensitive receptors ….. outweigh the benefits of the 
project.  The [Secretary of State] should ensure applicants have taken 
into account the landscape and visual impacts of visible plumes from 
chimney stacks and / or cooling assembly”.

11.2.9 
The following guidance is given in relation to mitigation, “Within a 
defined site, adverse landscape and visual effects may be minimised 
through appropriate siting of infrastructure within that site, design 
including colours and materials, and landscaping schemes, depending 
on the size and type of proposed project.  Materials and designs of 
buildings should always be given careful consideration.” 
11.2.10 
At Section 4.5 of NPS EN1 and paragraph 2.3.16 of NPS EN2 the 
importance of good design is set out in relation to landscape and visual 
(as well as other) impacts. 
11.2.11 
Section 2.8 of NPS EN-5 provides detail on the potential landscape and 
visual impacts specific to electricity supply infrastructure.  Paragraph 
2.8.2 states that: 
“In practice new above ground electricity lines, whether supported by 
lattice steel towers/pylons or wooden poles, can give rise to adverse 
landscape and visual impacts, dependent upon their scale, siting, 
degree of screening and the nature of the landscape and local 
environment through which they are routed”. But that “these impacts 
can usually be mitigated”.  
11.2.12 
Paragraph 2.8.4 goes on to state that the following should be followed 
when considering the route of an overhead line (based on the Holford 
Rules): 
� 
avoid altogether, if possible, the major areas of highest amenity 
value, by so planning the general route of the line in the first place, 
even if total mileage is  increased in consequence; 
� 
avoid smaller areas of high amenity value or scientific interest by 
deviation, provided this can be done without using too many angle 
towers, i.e. the bigger structures which are used when lines change 
direction; 
� 
other things being equal, choose the most direct line, with no sharp 
changes of direction and thus with fewer angle towers; 
� 
choose tree and hill backgrounds in preference to sky backgrounds 
wherever possible. When a line has to cross a ridge, secure this 
opaque background as long as possible, cross obliquely when a dip 
in the ridge provides an opportunity. Where it does not, cross 
directly, preferably between belts of trees; 
� 
prefer moderately open valleys with woods where the apparent 
height of towers will be reduced, and views of the line will be 
broken by trees;

� 
where country is flat and sparsely planted, keep the high voltage 
lines as far as possible independent of smaller lines, converging 
routes, distribution poles and other masts, wires and cables, so as 
to avoid a concentration of lines or “wirescape”; and 
� 
approach urban areas through industrial zones, where they exist; 
and when pleasant residential and recreational land intervenes 
between the approach line and the substation, carefully assess the 
comparative costs of undergrounding.  
11.2.13 
Planning Policy Wales (PPW) sets out the land use planning policies of 
the WG and is supplemented by topic based Technical Advice Notes 
(TANs). The relevant PPW & TAN policies are:  
PPW: Chapter 6: Conserving the Historic Environment (2012) 
11.2.14 
The objective of chapter 6 is to protect the historic environment, 
encompassing archaeology and ancient monuments, listed buildings, 
conservation areas and historic parks, gardens and landscapes. 
Local planning authorities should take the ‘Register of Landscapes, 
Parks and Gardens of Special Historic Interest in Wales’ into account in 
preparing their development plans.  
Technical Advice Note (TAN) 5: Nature Conservation and Planning 
(2009) 
11.2.15 
Provides advice about how the land use planning system should 
contribute to protecting and enhancing biodiversity and geological 
conservation. Sensitive landscaping and planting, the creation, 
maintenance and management of landscape features important to 
wildlife, and the skilled adaption of derelict areas can provide extended 
habitats. 
Technical Advice Note (TAN) 8: Renewable Energy (2005) 
11.2.16 
Local planning authorities should seek to maximise the potential of 
renewable energy by linking the development plan with other local 
authority strategies including the community strategy. They should also 
develop generic development control policies, which might include 
housing, employment, and rural development proposals and consider 
the implications for landscape protection, the re-use of previously 
developed land and waste management.

11.2.17 
Development plan policies should include, where appropriate, 
measures to protect trees and provide for tree planting and 
landscaping.  
Technical Advice Note (TAN) 12: Design (2009) 
11.2.18 
Tan 12 sets out the objectives of good design and aims to encourage 
good design in all aspects of development, stating that: ‘The way which 
development relates to its urban or rural landscape context is critical to 
its success’. The aim should be to achieve good design solutions, 
which maximise the natural landscape assets and minimise 
environmental impact on the landscape. It is particularly important that 
proposals to amend or create new landscape are not considered as an 
afterthought and that the long term impact of development on the 
landscape is fully understood. 
11.2.19 
Landscape design - the way in which the land will be treated (other 
than buildings) for the purpose of enhancing or protecting amenities of 
the site and the area in which it is situated; 
� Scale - of development in relation to surroundings, including height, 
width and length of each building proposed within the development; 
how the massing of the proposal contributes to the existing 
hierarchy of development to reinforce character; how the mass and 
height impacts on privacy, sunlight and microclimate; and how 
height impacts on the attractiveness and safety of neighbouring 
public space; 
� Layout of development - how the layout makes the development 
integrate with its surroundings whilst taking into consideration the 
orientation of the building to maximise energy efficiency and 
connectivity (the ways in which routes and open spaces within the 
development are provided, situated and orientated in relation to 
each other and to buildings and spaces outside the development); 
how the external area contributes towards the development and is 
used to make the development a more sustainable development; 
how is the chosen site the best location and how it links into 
adjacent uses; and 
� Appearance - (exterior design, including materials) means the 
aspects of a building or place within the development, which 
determine the visual impression of the building or place makes, 
including external built form of the development, its architecture, 
materials, decoration, lighting, colour and texture.

11.2.20 
The Rhondda Cynon Taf Local Development Plan (LDP) provides the 
development strategy and spatial policy framework over a fifteen-year 
period to 2021. The Plan is used by the Council to guide and control 
development, providing a basis for consistent and appropriate decision-
making. 
Area Wide (AW) Policies 
11.2.21 
Area Wide Policies, in conjunction with LDP Core Policies, LDP 
Strategy Specific Policies and National Planning Policies are the basis 
for the determination of planning applications for the development and 
use of land and buildings. They are intended to ensure that 
development accords with the visual and spatial objectives of the plan. 
11.2.22 
Policy AW5 – New Development: Development proposals will be 
supported where the scale, form and design of the development would 
have no unacceptable effect on the character and appearance of the 
site and the surrounding area. 
11.2.23 
Policy AW6 – Design and Placemaking: Development Proposals will be 
supported when there is a high standard of design, which reinforces 
attractive qualities and local distinctiveness and improves areas of poor 
design and layout. New or improved open spaces and more accessible 
natural green spaces will serve as valuable recreational assets to local 
communities and may encourage people from outside the community to 
visit the area. 
11.2.24 
Policy AW8 – Protection and Enhancement of the Natural Environment: 
Rhondda Cynon Taf’s distinctive natural heritage will be preserved and 
enhanced by protecting it from inappropriate development. Where 
development is permitted, planning conditions and/or obligations will be 
used to protect or enhance the natural heritage. Where the benefits of 
development outweigh the conservation interest, mitigation will be 
required to offset adverse effects (including negative effects on 
adjacent land). Development proposals will only be permitted where 
there would be no unacceptable impact upon features of importance to 
landscape or nature conservation. 
Core Policies 
11.2.25 
The Local Development Plan for Rhondda Cynon Taf is divided in two 
and advocates a different approach for development in the north and in 
the south of the borough. Hirwaun is located in the Northern Strategy 
Area, bordering the Brecon Beacons National Park. The emphasis in 
the northern area is on building sustainable communities and halting 
the process of depopulation and decline.

11.2.26 
Hirwaun has been identified as a Key Settlement area meaning it is 
geographically smaller and less strategically significant than a Principal 
Town. Nevertheless it provides important services and acts as a centre 
for commercial and community activity. These key settlements will act 
as focal points for growth in Rhondda Cynon Taf over the plan period. 
(RCT-LDP, 2011) 
11.2.27 
Policy Northern Strategy Area 8 – Land South of Hirwaun. The 
Councils vision for the Strategic Site is the enhancement of Hirwaun as 
a key settlement in Rhondda Cynon Taf, through residential, 
employment and community development, and restoration and 
enhancement of the landscape and habitats. This is relevant to the 
Hirwaun Power Project in terms of providing a context to proposed 
development in the area and the potential cumulative effects. In order 
to ensure that the various site constraints can be appropriately 
addressed at the masterplanning stage by leaving some areas 
undeveloped, the areas indicated for development on the indicative 
concept plan are significantly larger than the land area needed for the 
developments which are identified in the policy. 
11.2.28 
Policy NE 4:  Protection of Features of Natural Amenity, Landscapes 
and Biodiversity states, “Development will be permitted if it does not 
unacceptably affect features of importance to landscape or nature 
conservation, including; Trees, woodland, hedgerows, river corridors, 
ponds, wetlands, stone walls, and species rich grassland. This policy 
would apply to a range of natural environment features that although 
not formally designated, have been identified at the County Borough 
level for their intrinsic merits and need of protection. Such features 
have been identified in Council documents and strategies such as the 
LBAP and ‘Our Living Space’. Any conditions attached to permissions 
should consist of mitigation measures to minimise the harm associated 
with any development (including negative effects on adjacent land). 
Alternatively, compensation and/ or enhancement measures will be 
required from the development. 
11.2.29 
Northern Strategy Area Policies; The LDP Northern Strategy Area has 
an emphasis on building sustainable communities and halting the 
process of depopulation and decline. The natural environment has a 
major role to play in this Strategy. It is essential to conserve and 
enhance the unique and outstanding features of natural landscapes, 
habitats and other biodiversity that exist in the area. In turn, this will 
help to create communities, which have a natural environment that will 
be attractive for people to live, work and spend their recreational time. 
Furthermore, these natural features, if correctly managed, will be able 
to draw in people from outside the area, which can only help the 
economy of the area.

11.2.30 
Although there has not been major development pressure in majority of 
the Northern Strategy Area, apart from in the northern Cynon Valley in 
recent years, there will be increasing pressure in the future. Moreover, 
it is essential that the character of the area and the biodiversity that 
lives within it is not compromised in any way by piecemeal 
developments.” 
11.2.31 
Policy N-NE 1/ Policy NSA 25:  Special Landscape Areas: the County

the most important areas of high quality landscape  within the Plan area 
as Special Landscape Areas (SLA). SLA is a non-statutory designation, 
and the purpose of this policy is threefold: 
� To protect designated areas against inappropriate development 
where it is likely that there will be particular pressures for 
development or change; 
� The need to conserve and enhance distinctive and valued 
qualities and features of the landscape to avoid unacceptable 
deterioration, change or development; and 
� The need to raise awareness of this distinctive landscape and 
thereby raise standards of design to bring about positive 
change. 
11.2.32 
Policy NSA 25 identifies the location of nine SLAs where development 
will be expected to conform to the highest standards of design, siting, 
layout and materials appropriate to the character of the area. Two SLAs 
lie within the LVIA study area: 
�  Hirwaun Common, Cwm Dare & Cwm Aman; and, 
� Brecon Beacons Edge at Llwydcoed 
11.2.33 
The policy states, “Special Landscape Areas (SLAs) have been 
designated to protect areas of fine landscape quality within Rhondda 
Cynon Taf. The designation of these landscape areas has been 
undertaken at local level using a regionally agreed methodology. The 
methodology used to identify the SLAs in Rhondda Cynon Taf builds on 
the Countryside Council for Wales (now Natural resources Wales) 
LANDMAP methodology and considers factors such as:  
� 
Prominence; Spectacle – dramatic topography and views;  
� 
Unspoilt areas - Pre-industrial patterns of land use;  
� 
Remoteness and Tranquillity;

Vulnerability and sensitivity to change;  
�

11.2.34 
 In the Northern Strategy Area, SLAs have been identified to protect the 
distinctive upland / valley landscape of the area. Particular 
consideration has been given to the protection of the unspoilt valley 
slopes and ridges which form a visual backdrop to the settlements of 
the area.” 
11.2.35 
Document No. EB49, Proposals for Designation of Special Landscape 
Areas in Rhondda Cynon Taf (2008) provides the evidence base for 
SLA policies and proposals within the Local Development Plan. It 
provides an evaluation of the landscape qualities and features within 
each SLA and guidance for their protection through policies and 
management.  
Brecon Beacons National Park 
11.2.36 
The Brecon Beacons National Park is a Category V protected area as 
defined by the World Conservation Union (IUCN) in the Guidelines of 
Protected Area Management Categories. IUCN Category V protected 
areas are living and working landscapes with characteristic qualities, 
features and services that have been moulded by the interplay of 
natural forces and human activities over the course of time.  
11.2.37 
NPS EN-1 states that National Parks, together with the Broads and 
Areas of Outstanding Natural Beauty (AONBs), have been confirmed 
by the Government as having the highest status of protection in relation 
to landscape and scenic beauty. Where decisions may directly affect 
such areas, paragraph 5.9.9 requires the SoS to have regard to the 
statutory purposes of the potentially affected area/s. The statutory 
duties are provided for in Section 11A(2) of the National Parks and 
Access to the Countryside Act 1949 (National Parks), Section 17A of 
the Norfolk and Suffolk Broads Act 1988 (The Broads) and Section 85 
of the Countryside and Rights of Way Act 2000 (AONBs). 
11.2.38 
NPS EN-1 confirms that the duty to have regard to the purposes of 
nationally designated areas also applies when considering applications 
for projects outside the boundaries of these areas, which may have 
impacts within them. EN-1 confirms “That the aim should be to avoid 
compromising the purposes of designation and such projects should be 
designed sensitively given the various siting, operational, and other 
relevant constraints” (paragraph 5.9.12). 
11.2.39 
The National Park Management Plan (NPMP) 2010 – 2015 lays out 20 
year strategies and 5 year actions by and for everyone delivering its 
purposes and duty, or concerned about the Parks future. A number of

Special Qualities have been set out in the Management Plan for the 
Park and a few of these are directly relevant to landscape and visual 
amenity: 
� 
A National Park offering peace and tranquillity with opportunities for 
quiet enjoyment, inspiration relaxation and spiritual renewal. 
� 
The Parks sweeping grandeur and outstanding natural beauty 
observed across a variety of harmoniously connected landscapes. 
� 
A working, living ‘patchwork’ of contrasting patterns, colours and 
textures comprising well maintained farmed landscapes, open 
uplands, lakes and meandering rivers punctuated by small scale 
woodlands, country lanes, hedgerows and stone walls and 
scattered settlements. 
Dark Sky Policy 
11.2.40 
The Brecon Beacons National Park Authority has adopted a set of 
external lighting recommendations to ensure that there will be no 
further degradation in the quality of the night sky due to future 
developments. The landscape within the park to the north of the Project 
Site is within the Critical Buffer Zone. 
11.2.41 
The Brecon Beacons have developed external lighting guidelines for 
use by their Planning Department (and by Developers). Application of 
these guidelines to all future development applications will ensure there 
is no further light pollution. 
Turning Heads – A Strategy for the Heads of the Valleys (2006)  
11.2.42 
Turning Heads is a regeneration strategy for the area called the ‘Heads 
of the Valleys’ and includes Hirwaun at the western end. A key 
environmental objective for the programme is an attractive and well 
used natural, historic and built environment setting the context for 
regeneration. 
11.2.43 
Strategic Programme No. 2 seeks to implement a number of key 
landscape scale environmental enhancements, concentrating on key 
corridors and gateways such as the A465 Heads of Valleys Road and 
approaches to the former Ebbw Vale Steelworks and Hirwaun. The 
focus is on areas that are visually unattractive or derelict, acquiring 
sites if necessary to ensure the early removal of eyesores. The plan 
aims to protect, enhance and manage the natural and semi natural 
environment, its resources and its biodiversity. Along with this a 
comprehensive design code to encourage consistent standards of 
urban and landscape design is being implemented.

Cynon Valley River Park 
11.2.44 
The River Park runs along the Cynon Valley between Abercynon to 
Hirwaun and has connections / links with Mountain Ash, Aberaman, 
Cwmdare and Aberdare. The Park works to the following vision. ‘..the 
value of the floodplain as a natural feature to be recognised, the 
positive use and management of the floodplain to be encouraged and 
reflect its value for natural processes, for wildlife, for heritage and for 
people. 
11.3 
Realistic Worst Case Scenario for Assessment 
11.3.1 
In respect of landscape and visual effects, the realistic worst case 
scenario from within the proposed Project parameters (which are 
described in Section 4 of the PEIR) are set out in Table 11.1 below. 
11.3.2 
The reason that the parameters identified in Table 11.1 represent the 
realistic worst case in relation to landscape and visual effects are: 
� 
Larger stack heights increase the likelihood of visual impact; and 
� 
Higher number of stacks increases the likelihood of visual impact. 
11.3.3 
A preliminary assessment of both options for the Gas Connection and 
the Electrical Connection is presented in this section. A decision on the 
preferred option for each will be taken following consultation.

Assessment Methodology and Significance Criteria 
The Scope of the Assessment 
11.4.1 
The purpose of the LVIA is to describe and evaluate separately 
potential landscape and visual effects that would arise from the Project. 
It is an iterative process. For the purpose of this assessment, impacts 
that are assessed on a preliminary basis as being either moderately 
adverse or beneficial or above will be considered significant in terms of 
 
 
 
Hirwaun Power Project Preliminary

the Environmental Impact Assessment (England & Wales) Regulations 
2011.  Although slight adverse or beneficial and neutral impacts would 
not be considered significant, they remain worthy of consideration 
throughout both the design and the decision making process. 
11.4.2 
Landscape character and associated resources are considered to be of 
importance in their own right and are valued for their intrinsic qualities 
irrespective of whether they are seen by people.  Impacts on visual 
amenity as perceived by people, are therefore clearly distinguished 
from, although closely linked to, impacts on landscape character.  
Landscape and visual assessments are therefore separate although 
linked processes. 
11.4.3 
The sequence of the LVIA is as follows:  
Baseline Studies 
Landscape context 
Landscape receptors and sensitivity 
Visual composition, receptors and sensitivity 
� 
Landscape and Visual Impact Assessment 
Potential impacts arising from the development 
Mitigation 
Evaluation of significance of landscape effects 
Evaluation of significance of visual effects 
Appraisal of compliance with planning policy 
Assessment of cumulative effects 
Conclusions 
11.4.4 
The aim of the final assessment is to establish the following: 
� 
A clear understanding of the Project Site and its wider landscape 
setting, identifying its landscape character, resources, value and 
sensitivity to the proposed development; 
� 
An assessment of the composition, character and aesthetic value 
of views from visual receptors including occupiers of residential 
properties and people using amenity landscapes, and the  
sensitivity of views;  
� 
The nature of the different development scenarios and mitigation 
measures; and 
� 
The potential direct and indirect effects of the proposal on the 
landscape resource (i.e. landscape elements and character) and on 
visual receptors.

� 
This preliminary assessment has also covered these points, 
although, being a preliminary assessment, the ES will present the 
assessment in more detail.  
11.4.5 
This preliminary assessment includes: 
� 
A review of all relevant documents and landscape planning policy 
and guidance; field survey to assess baseline landscape character 
and views; 
� 
A description of the key features associated with each development 
scenario that would alter the characteristics of the landscape and 
visual baseline;  
� 
Generic and site specific mitigation; and 
� 
Separate assessment of the predicted significance of residual 
effects on the landscape resource / character and visual amenity in 
relation to each development scenario, and compliance with 
landscape policy. 
11.4.6 
The assessment looks at potential effects arising during the 
construction (including demolition), operation and decommissioning 
stages and considers: 
� 
Landscape character and resources, including effects on the 
aesthetic values of the landscape caused by changes in the 
elements, characteristics, character and qualities of the landscape;  
� 
Designated landscapes, registered parks and gardens, and 
recreational interests;   
� 
Visual amenity, including effects upon potential viewers and 
viewing groups caused by changes in the appearance of the 
landscape as a result of the Project; and  
� 
Cumulative effects arising in combination with those developments 
with planning permission but not yet constructed and those 
developments submitted for planning permission but which have 
not yet been granted planning permission, and those developments 
which are committed to come forward (i.e. supported in a 
development plan.  
Spatial Scope 
11.4.7 
The Project Site and Study Area are shown on Figure 11.1.  The Study 
Area for visual effects has been determined by a Zone of Theoretical 
Visibility (ZTV) within a 15km radius of the centre of the Project Site, to 
identify approximately where the Project could have an adverse effect 
on visual amenity.

11.4.8 
The Study Area is broken down and landscape impacts addressed as 
follows: 
� 0 to 3km radius area (inner study area) selected for assessment of 
impacts on landscape character at a local level, designated 
landscapes, landscape features and visual amenity. 
� 0 to 15km study area (outer study area) selected for broader 
assessment of impacts on landscape character with reference to 
National Character Areas and the Brecon Beacons National Park. 
Relevant long distance effects on visual amenity will also be 
addressed. 
Temporal Scope 
11.4.9 
Although no detailed site studies have been undertaken to date for 
assessment of landscape and visual impacts, an initial site visit has 
been made to the Study Area.  Further, detailed studies are being 
undertaken to establish the landscape and visual baseline.  Landscape 
and visual impacts will be assessed for the construction / demolition 
phase, at operation, and at decommissioning. Visual impacts will be 
assessed for the winter situation when the screening effect of 
vegetation will be least effective.   
Standards & Guidelines 
11.4.10 
The methodology for the assessment is based on current best practice 
and guidance from the following sources: 
� 
Guidelines for Landscape and Visual Impact Assessment (GLVIA), 
3rd Edition, 2013, published by the Landscape Institute / Institute of 
Environmental Management and Assessment;

Illustrative Tools 
11.4.11 
The following graphic information will be produced to illustrate visual 
aspects of the Project  
Visibility Maps (ZTV)

11.4.12 
Separate computer generated Zone of Theoretical Visibility (ZTV) maps 
will be produced for the main structures and the stacks to assist in 
viewpoint selection and to appreciate the potential influence of the 
development in the wider landscape. 
11.4.13 
The ZTVs will indicate areas from which it might be possible to secure 
views to part or parts of the Project. However, use of ZTV mapping 
needs to be qualified on the following basis: 
� There are a number of areas within the ZTV maps from where there 
is potential to view parts of the proposal, but which comprise land 
where the general public do not have access; 
� A ZTV map does not account for the effects of screening and 
filtering of views as a result of intervening features, such as 
buildings, trees and hedgerows; and 
� A ZTV map does not account for the likely orientation of a viewer – 
for example when travelling in a vehicle. 
11.4.14 
The combined effect of these limitations means that ZTV mapping 
tends to over-estimate the extent of visibility – both in terms of the land 
area from which the Project is visible and the extent of visibility of the 
structures from a particular viewpoint. 
11.4.15 
The use of this type of ZTV map is considered good practice and 
should be considered as a tool to assist in assessing the visibility of the 
Project. A ZTV map does not present an absolute measure of visibility 
and do not represent the “visual impact” of the Project. 
11.4.16 
The ZTVs will be compiled using Ordnance Survey Landform Profile 
data comprising spot heights and contours (within a 10m resolution) to 
produce a Digital Terrain Model (DTM). The DTM will be overlaid on a 
1:50,000 Ordnance Survey base maps to provide details of locations 
and landmark features, which may affect the extent of visibility or 
provide screening in the landscape.  
11.4.17 
The ZTVs will be calculated using landform data, the proposed layout 
of the development, height options (buildings or stack), the centre of 
the ZTV, the radius from the Project Site centre, the resolution of the 
final output, the view height of the receptor, and the resolution of the 
landform data. For greater accuracy a calculation was built into the 
model to make corrections for the curvature of the earth.

11.4.18 
Photograph and photomontage images will be produced to illustrate an 
observer’s view of the existing site and Project from each of the 
viewpoint locations agreed with RCTCBC and BBNPA.  
11.4.19 
All photographs will be taken with a digital equivalent of a 35mm SLR 
camera, with 50mm focal length lens, mounted on a level panoramic 
head tripod. They will record a 90 degree angle of view to illustrate the 
full extent of the proposals within the local landscape that would be 
experienced at each viewpoint. The photographs will be merged to 
create a panorama and the resulting digital photographic data will also 
be used to produce the photomontages. 
Wireframes  
11.4.20 
The proposal will be shown from the selected viewpoints in wireframe 
format. Ordnance Survey Landform Profile data with a 50m resolution 
will be used to construct the landform seen in the wireframe view. 
Proposed structures, other nearby built development / structures and 
viewpoint location coordinates will be added to the DTM. Since the 
LVIA will assess the maximum case scenario, the wireframes will be 
constructed to show stacks up to a height of 35m.  The wireframe views 
will be taken from a set viewer height of 2m above the terrain model 
(the terrain model has an accuracy of 3m at grid points). 
Photomontages 
11.4.21 
Once the pre-prepared images had been imported and the wireframe 
views overlaid onto the photographs, photomontages of the proposed 
structures will be rendered (white) and blended using Adobe Photoshop 
software to produce a realistic view. Other large scale development, 
such as the existing wind turbines, will be added to the DTM and the 
horizontal spacing and vertical dimensions of these structures matched 
when visible in the panorama. The images will be correctly scaled to 
the correct angle for the final output image size and transferred into 
CAD software to produce the images that are presented in this PEIR 
chapter.  
Nature of Receptor 
Gathering Baseline Data 
11.4.22 
Baseline data, alongside the description of the Project, forms the basis 
for the identification and description of the changes that will result in the 
landscape and visual amenity of the area. The landscape resource 
needs to be understood in terms of its constituent elements, its 
character and the way this varies spatially, geographic extent, history, 
condition, the way the landscape is experienced, and the value

attached to it. A landscape receptor is a defined aspect of the 
landscape resource that has the potential to be affected by a proposal. 
11.4.23 
The visual baseline establishes the area in which the Project may be 
visible, the different groups of people who may experience views of the 
Project, the places where they will be affected and the nature of the 
views and visual amenity at those points. Visual receptors are 
individuals and/ or defined groups of people who have the potential to 
be affected by a proposal. 
11.4.24 
Baseline studies for assessing landscape and visual effects require a 
mix of desk study and field work to identify and record the character of 
the landscape and the elements, features and aesthetic and perceptual 
factors, which contribute to it. The use of Landscape Character 
Assessments is an important element of establishing the current 
baseline and potential forces for change. LANDMAP has been used for 
this assessment as it covers the necessary local area and evaluates 
each area in terms of its five key aspects, geological landscape, 
landscape habitats, historic landscape, cultural landscape, and visual 
and sensory landscape. 
11.4.25 
As explained in Section 3.2 of this PEIR,  the “Rochdale Envelope 
Approach” has been used, whereby the assessment considers the 
worst or maximum case scenario in terms of the size and scale of the 
Project  including relevant mitigation associated with design.  
Approach to Assessing Significant Effects 
11.4.26 
To predict and describe the potential effects on the landscape and 
visual resource, baseline information is combined with the different 
components of the Project at all its different stages (construction / 
demolition, operation and decommissioning). 
11.4.27 
The assessment will take into account the spatial and temporal nature 
of potential effects:  
� 
Direct effects are those imposed on landscape elements on the site 
(those that occur within the Project Site) as a direct result of 
development, such as the loss of existing trees or other vegetation;  
� 
Indirect and secondary effects may occur some distance from the 
Project Site (outside of the Project Site, but within the Study Area) 
as a consequence of the development occurring, such as the 
removal of screen vegetation which would allow views in from 
surrounding areas; 
� 
Cumulative effects occur when additional developments of similar 
type appear in an area.

� 
Short, Medium or Long Term describes the duration of an effect; 
and 
� 
Permanent or temporary relates for example to additional effects 
during construction compared to the permanent change caused by 
the Project. 
11.4.28 
Adverse effects are those that cause detriment to the pre-development 
situation, Beneficial effects are those that restore or improve the 
landscape, and neutral effects might change the existing situation, but 
on balance make the situation neither better nor worse. 
Sensitivity 
11.4.29 
Sensitivity is a term applied to specific receptors, combining 
judgements of the susceptibility of the receptor to the specific type of 
change or development proposed and the value related to that 
receptor. The overall sensitivity of the landscape can be defined as 
embracing a combination of the sensitivity of the landscape resource 
(in terms of both its character as a whole and the individual elements 
contributing to character) and the visual sensitivity of the landscape.  
11.4.30 
LANDMAP also includes evaluation scores, which are defined as in 
Table 11.2 below: 
Table 11.2 LANDMAP Evaluation

importance 
Outstanding 
International or national

Tables 11.3 and 11.4 describe differing degrees of sensitivity ranging 
between low to high. 
Table 11.3: Landscape Sensitivity (as recorded in LANDMAP)  
Sensitivity Description 
High 
Important / highly valued landscape recognised by

Sensitivity Description 
and 
The qualities for which the landscape is valued are in 
good condition, with a clearly apparent and distinctive 
character. This distinctive character is susceptible to 
relatively small changes.  
Medium 
Landscape of moderately valued characteristics 
reasonably tolerant of changes; 
Landscape is not recognised by national or regional 
designation; 
The landscape is relatively intact, with a distinctive 
character. and 
The landscape is reasonably tolerant of change. 
Low 
Relatively degraded or low value landscape with no 
designations; 
Landscape integrity is low, with a landscape in poor 
condition and a degraded character; and 
 The landscape has potential capacity to accommodate 
significant change. 
11.4.32 
Visual sensitivity is assessed in terms of a combination of factors such 
as views, visibility, the number and nature of people perceiving the 
landscape and the scope to mitigate visual impact. Sensitivity is not 
absolute; it will vary according to the character of the existing 
landscape and the extent and nature of the Project.

Sensitivity Description 
landscape could elevate viewer sensitivity to highest 
level. 
Medium 
Viewers with moderate interest in their environment, and 
discontinuous and/or irregular viewing periods. Such 
receptors would include: 
Road or rail users – travellers and passengers of moving 
vehicles.  
Users engaged in outdoor sport or recreation other than 
appreciation of the landscape (i.e., hunting, shooting, 
golf, water-based activities)  
Users of secondary footpaths or footpaths that may be 
already impacted by intrusive features. 
Low 
Small number or low sensitivity of viewers assumed. 
Viewers with a passing interest in their surroundings and 
momentary viewing periods.  Such receptors include: 
Drivers/travellers and/or passengers of moving vehicles 
including trains. 
People at their place of work, including agricultural 
workers and other non-motorised users on most roads 
or those already impacted by intrusive features. 
Magnitude 
11.4.33 
Each effect on a receptor needs to be assessed in terms of its size or 
scale, the geographical extent of the area influenced, and its duration 
and reversibility. The assessment will consider the magnitude of 
change the Project would exert on the receptor because of:  
� 
The proximity of the Project to the receptor – generally the 
magnitude of effect reduces with increasing distance as it 
progressively exerts less influence; 
� 
The extent to which the Project can be seen, and the extent to 
which landform, woodland, buildings etc. intervene; and 
� 
The visibility of the Project and its resulting effects on character. 
11.4.34 
The assessment of the magnitude of potential visual impacts is an 
assessment of the extent of change upon visual amenity as a direct 
result of the Project, and depends upon several factors including: 
� 
The scale of change in the view with respect to the loss and/ or 
addition of new features;

� 
The degree of contrast, or integration of / compatibility with any 
new features with existing features in the view; 
� 
The duration of the effect (temporary or permanent, intermittent or 
continuous).  Temporary effects are considered to be less 
significant than longer term or permanent effects; 
�

The dominance of the impact feature in the view, and 
� 
Seasonal variation.  
11.4.35 
It is assumed that the visual effects of the Project will reduce as viewing 
distance increases.  The magnitude of visual effects at any given 
distance will vary according to a range of factors.  They include the 
extent of the new buildings and structures that would be visible; their 
position in the view; the presence of other conspicuous features; and 
the extent to which views of the Project would be screened or filtered 
by intervening landform or by landscape elements such as trees, 
woodlands, hedgerows, or built structures; and the extent of mitigation 
planting. 
11.4.36 
The assessment will assume that the change would be seen in clear 
visibility and under appropriate lighting conditions and considers: 
� 
The attributes of the landscape where the Project would be sited 
(i.e. the scale and character of the landscape in which it would be 
viewed; the presence or absence of landscape features; and the 
scale / enclosure of the landscape within the field of view); 
� 
The design and siting of the Project itself; and 
� 
The atmospheric conditions prevalent at the time of viewing. 
11.4.37 
Criteria used to assess the magnitude of predicted landscape and 
visual amenity effects range from No Change/ Negligible to Major and 
are set out below in Table 11.5

Significance of Effect 
11.4.38 
The two principal criteria determining significance are the sensitivity of 
the receptor to change as a result of the Project, and the magnitude of 
the impact or effect.  In order to come to an overall conclusion on the 
significance of landscape and visual effects, the separate judgements 
about the sensitivity of the landscape receptors and the magnitude of 
the landscape effects need to be combined. The assessment will 
combine the sensitivity of the receptors with the predicted magnitude of 
impact in order to establish the significance of the landscape and visual 
effects as shown in Table 11.6.

Non-statutory Landscape Designations 
Special Landscape Areas 
The following two SLAs lie within the Study Area: 
11.6.13 
The Hirwaun Common SLA lies in north west of Rhondda Cynon Taf 
from the county boundary south of Rhigos, extending eastward along 
tops and slopes of upper Cynon Valley and side valleys to Cwm Aman. 
The hillsides and tops of Hirwaun Common are very prominent from the 
A465 and Brecon Beacons National Park. The landscape comprises 
mainly traditional open common land and dramatic crags and steep 
hillsides affording spectacular views from Rhigos road and Graig road. 
11.6.14 
The Brecon Beacons Edge at Llwyncoed SLA lies in the north eastern 
sector of Rhondda Cynon Taf, immediately adjacent to the Brecon 
Beacons National Park boundary. To the north west are Penywaun and 
Llwydcoed form the edges to the south and forestry to the east. It 
provides an important setting for the National Park and provides a 
buffer zone to settlements and industry. 
The Site and Surrounding Area 
Site Context 
11.6.15 
The Project Site lies entirely within the jurisdiction of RCTCBC. The 
Project Site is located close to the Brecon Beacons National Park, 
administered by the BBNPA. 
11.6.16 
Hirwaun is located four miles north west of Aberdare in Rhondda 
Cynnon Taff, South Wales. The village sits to the north of the Heads of 
the Valleys Road (A465), within the County Borough of Rhondda 
Cynon Taf and on the southern edge of the Brecon Beacons National 
Park. 
11.6.17 
Land surrounding the Project Site is characterised by a mixture of 
industrial units, scrub grassland, intensively grazed agricultural land 
and plantation woodland. The A465 ‘Heads of the Valleys’ Road runs 
approximately 100m north of the Project Site and the Tower Colliery is 
approximately 1km south of the Project Site. The closest residential 
receptors to the Project Site include: 
� 
Rhigos (1.3km south west); 
� 
Hirwaun (1.4km east);

� 
Penderyn (1.8km north); and  
� 
Aberdare (5km east).  
11.6.18 
Although the area immediately surrounding the proposed Power 
Generation Plant is characterised by industrial development, the wider 
landscape is made up of open countryside with rolling hills and 
agricultural landholdings. 
Land Use and Vegetation 
11.6.19 
The Power Generation Plant Site / Electrical Connection route corridor 
options are dominated by land which is currently occupied by a large 
industrial building currently used for storage and distribution. The area 
immediately adjacent to the Power Generation Plant Site is also used 
for miscellaneous industrial/ commercial use and can be characterised 
as a former works site. Amenity planting along Main Avenue and along 
the site fence and within the grounds has matured or is in decline. 
Conifer plantations provide screening on the external boundaries. 
11.6.20 
Land on which the Gas Connection would be sited is characterised by 
intensively grazed agricultural land and the A4061 road.  
11.6.21 
In the wider countryside, field hedgerows are varied. Around the large 
arable fields on the valley floor they are often gappy, with few 
hedgerow trees. Some boundaries having been grubbed up to form 
large field sizes, leaving ditches and the occasional solitary tree. On the 
restored land around Rhigos the hedges have been designed to include 
a range of species and are well kept, thick and provide a distinctive 
field boundary linking small wooded copses.  
11.6.22 
Higher up on the valley sides, boundaries are marked by stone walls 
with single old stunted hawthorns or the occasional oak tree. The fields 
are pasture grazed predominantly by sheep and on the higher land the 
boundaries have been lost and the fields merge seamlessly with open 
moor land vegetation. Broadleaf copses link together to form small 
areas of woodland, especially on the south facing slopes of Penderyn. 
11.6.23 
The area of the Brecon Beacons National Park closest to the Project 
Site can be categorised as an enclosed and relatively settled pastoral 
landscape. Ancient woodlands surround the streams and waterfalls. 
Between the valleys are ridges of higher land with a more open quality 
and long views. 
Landform and Drainage 
11.6.24 
The topography of the surrounding landscape comprises a U-shaped 
valley with steep slopes in gently S-dipping Pennant sandstones

(Upper Carboniferous), containing well-preserved glacial cirques in 
Cwm Dare & Craig y Bwlch. The lower slopes underlain by Productive 
Coal Fm mudstones covered by extensive boulder clay and patches of 
peat, infilling glacial lakes at Hirwaun Ponds.  
11.6.25 
Located in South Wales the River Cynon is one of the largest tributaries 
of the River Taff. Arising in the Brecon Beacons it is supplemented by a 
number of small streams as it passes through Hirwaun. The river 
passes in a south easterly direction through Aberdare before eventually 
meeting up with the River Taff at Abercynon. Following the closure of 
the coal industry and the demolition of the smokeless fuel plant, the 
quality of the river has improved dramatically. 
Public Rights of Way & Recreation 
11.6.26 
There are no public rights of way or open access land within the Project 
Site. 
11.6.27 
There are two large areas of Open Access Land within the Study Area. 
Hirwaun Common lies to the south of the estate and occupying a large 
swathe of north facing hillside above the Tower Colliery coal mine. The 
other area lies within the Brecon Beacons National Park to the north 
east of the estate (still within Hirwaun Parish) and takes in Mynydd-y-
glog, part of the Fforest of Fawr. 
11.6.28 
One long distance recreational trail, the Coed Morgannwg Way, passes 
through Hirwaun Common and Dare Country Park. 
11.6.29 
The Penderyn Quarry Line runs along the former quarry railway line 
that linked the limestone quarry to the ironworks and now provides a 
local recreational route. It is currently under consideration as a branch 
of the National Cycle Route 46 (Neath to Hereford) which is under 
development. 
11.6.30 
Whilst Hirwaun Industrial Estate is open to vehicles, cyclists and 
pedestrians it does not have any dedicated public footpaths. The estate 
is linked to Hirwaun by pavements adjacent to main roads. Several 
public footpaths link the west of the industrial estate with Rhigos, Bryn 
and Cefn Rhigos. To the south, the land is reclaimed colliery land and a 
public right of way has been included within the restoration scheme. 
This footpath runs east west between Bryn in the west and Hirwaun in 
the east. To the north west the industrial estate is connected by a 
public footpath to Pwll-y-Crochan Waterfall and the waterfalls north of 
Pontneddfechan.  Another footpath runs north from the industrial estate 
between Penderyn Reservoir and Pantcefnffordd onto the village of 
Penderyn.

Settlement 
11.6.31 
Hirwaun is situated on a ridge above the Neath and Cynon Valleys. 
Access can be gained via two streets leading of the main A465 Heads 
of the Valleys Road. Brecon Road from the eastern roundabout on the 
outskirts of the village and Rhigos Road from the western edge of the 
village converge onto the High Street, which forms the main cluster of 
retail, services and community facilities. 
11.6.32 
The villages of Rhigos and Bryn lie to the west of the Project Site and 
has recently had a number of new housing developments in the village. 
The hamlets of Cefn Rhigos and Cwm-Hwnt lie to the west of the 
village. The closest residential receptor to the Project Site is along 
Rhigos Road, approximately 150m to the south of the Power 
Generation Plant Site. This property is predominantly separated from 
the Power Generation Plant Site by industrial units, landform and 
vegetation. Large residential areas in the area include Rhigos / Bryn 
(1.3km south west) and Hirwaun (1.4km east). Further away are 
Penderyn (1.8km north) and Aberdare (5km east). The villages of 
Rhigos and Bryn lie to the west of the Project Site and have recently 
had a number of new housing developments in the village. The hamlets 
of Cefn Rhigos and Cwm-Hwnt lie further to the west. 
Infrastructure 
11.6.33 
The Heads of the Valleys Road, the A465 trunk road, lies close to the 
Project Site. Connecting Neath to Abergavenny it forms part of the 
strategic transport corridor across south Wales linking the Midlands and 
northern England to west Wales and Ireland. As part of the National 
Transport Plan the A465 dualling scheme will improve the length 
between Abergavenny and Hirwuan to dual 2-lane standard. The 
section of the route nearest to Hirwuan is scheduled for completion by 
2020. 
Landscape character 
11.6.34 
The baseline study includes a detailed appraisal of the landscape, 
within a 0-3km Study Area with a higher level appraisal of landscape 
character up to 15km. Information has been gathered through a 
combination of desk studies and field survey 
Local Landscape Character 
11.6.35 
LANDMAP is the national information system, devised and managed by 
NRW, for taking landscape into account in decision making. Landscape 
characteristics within the vicinity of the Project Site are described with 
reference to the following 5 constituent Aspect data sets in LANDMAP:

� 
Visual  & Sensory: identifies perceptual landscape qualities as well 
as including information on individual physical attributes of landform 
and land cover, and the relationships between them; 
� 
Geological Landscape: identifies those landscape qualities which 
are linked to the control or influence exerted by bedrock, surface 
processes, landforms and hydrology; 
� 
Landscape Habitats: Identifies the characteristics and spatial 
relationships of habitats and vegetation; 
� 
Historic landscape: Identifies those qualities that depend on key 
historic land uses, patterns and features; and 
� 
Cultural Landscape: includes information on the relationship 
between people and places, meaning of places to people, how 
landscape has shaped people’s actions and how people’s actions 
have shaped the landscape. 
11.6.36 
The comparative landscape evaluations assigned to each aspect area 
within the 5 data sets provides additional information to aid the 
assessment of the sensitivity of the landscape. Value does not 
necessarily equate with suitability or lack of suitability for a particular 
development and forms part of the underlying information from which 
the evaluation can be derived. 
11.6.37 
Table 11.8 provides extracted information from LANDMAP for all 
aspect areas directly affected by, or intervisible with the Project at 
classification level 3 or 4. It sets out a description of each area, an 
evaluation score (including reasoning) which reflects the value placed 
on that area, and any landscape management guidelines for the area, 
which indicates the direction of change desired. 
11.6.38 
Aspect areas within which the Project is proposed, and those adjacent, 
are most likely to undergo change. However, distant aspect areas 
where views form part of the area’s key characteristics, or to which the 
landscape of the site serves as an important backdrop, may also be 
affected. Although this may normally be an issue for the Visual and 
Sensory layer, other qualities such as those in historical and cultural 
landscapes may also be affected at some distance. These effects will 
be examined in the ES LVIA and detailed consideration will be given to 
aspect areas with an evaluation of High or Outstanding.

from the upland massif of the 
Fforest Fawr cutting through the 
limestone upland. Between them is 
a low ridge, which has rock outcrops 
and common land in places. This is 
more open with larger fields and 
little woody vegetation. The 
landcover is dominated by pasture 
with riparian deciduous woodland, 
particularly on steep slopes, and 
grown out hedgerows, all of which 
contribute to an enclosed, sheltered 
landscape. Some of the woodland is 
grazed, eliminating understorey and 
allowing clear views. Rectilinear

Hirwaun is situated on a ridge above 
the Neath and Cynon Valleys. It was 
an early centre of ironworking, being 
the first place in Wales where iron 
was smelted using coke. The 
Ironworks was established in1757 on 
the site of an earlier charcoal-fuelled 
furnace. The settlement is surrounded 
by evidence of coal mining – in 
modern times, mostly open cast. 
Inside the settlement street patterns

externally, the image of Hirwaun to 
passers-by is conveyed by the bulk of 
the pair of high-rise tower blocks,

Landscape Character - Designated Landscapes 
11.6.39 
The designation of landscapes indicates a recognised value placed by 
society on a landscape. There are no landscape designations covering 
the Project Site. Table 11.9 below sets out the baseline information for 
relevant designated landscapes and the reasons for their designation. 
11.6.40 
Section 14 of the PEIR provides further baseline information on Areas 
of Landscapes of Historic Interest in Wales, Parks and Gardens of 
Historic Interest and non-statutory historic landscapes. 
11.6.41 
With reference to Table 11.9 below, landscape character information is 
derived from the Brecon Beacons National Park landscape Character 
Assessment, Fiona Fyfe Associates, August 2012. 
11.6.42 
The 
SLAs below are located 
within Rhondda Cynon 
Taf’s 
administrative area. The information In Table 11.9 is derived from the 
Proposals for Designation of Special Landscape Areas in Rhondda 
Cynon Taff – Statement of Value (2008). It describes the specific 
qualities for which each area is valued which underpin the relevant 
policies in the Local Development Plan.

Brecon 
Beacons 
National Park  
The Brecon Beacons National Park is located 
approximately 0.2km north of the Project Site at its 
nearest point and continues beyond the Study Area 
boundary. 
The Park contains some of the most spectacular and 
distinctive upland landforms in southern Britain. The bulk 
of the area is underlain by Old Red Sandstone, rocks of 
Devonian age and these form the characteristic north 
and north east facing escarpments, including the Black 
Mountain in the western area. The older Ordovician and 
Silurian rocks of Mid Wales cross into the north western 
corner of the Park, giving a landscape of southwest-
northeast trending ridges and valleys. Coal Measures 
outcrop along the Park’s southern boundary. 
Two landscape character types within the National Park 
lie within the LVIA study area: 
Landscape Character Area 3: FForest Fawr (LCA3) 
Broad Landscape Type :Uplands 
 
Summary description: 
“ A bleak, upland moorland landscape, the character of 
which is locally influenced by its past use as a royal 
hunting ground and more recent estate ownership, 
apparent through the drystone boundary walls, estate 
corrages, shelterbelts and former rabbit farms. Remains 
of prehistoric and medieval occupation, and later 
industrial archaeological sites, are visible in the 
landscape. Away from the occasional roads which run 
across the area, it feeld tranquil, and with a sense of 
remoteness and relative wildness. Its distinctiveflat-
topped summits and steep northern escarpment are 
prominent in views from the north.” 
The overall management strategy for LCA3 is to protect 
and enhance special qualitites of the landscape including 
tranquillity, remoteness and relative wildness, and its 
historic fetures, long views and open skylines.

Southern Valleys (LCA4) 
Broad Landscape Type: Upland Valleys 
Summary description: 
“The predominantly limestone geology of his LCA 
creates its characteristic rough texture and grey colour, 
appearing in the crags, walls andbuildings of this 
enclosed and relatively settled pastoral landscape. 
Ancient woodlands surround the streams and 
spectacular waterfalls which are found in the south of the 
LCA, flowing in deep fern-filled gorges. Between the 
valleys are ridges of higher land with a more open quality 
and long views. The dark green of the extensive blocks 
of conifers in the south of the area contrasts with the 
surrounding grasslands.” 
The overall management strategy for LCA4 is to maintain 
and enhance the special qualities of the landscape, in 
particular its historic features and magnificent waterfalss, 
resisting development which would impact on views from 
the area..

understanding of landscape character should include the historic 
landscape.  
11.6.44 
The Hirwaun Industrial Estate came about three years after the 
outbreak of the Second World War. The part of Hirwaun Wrgant 
Common lying between the main Cardiff to Swansea main road and the 
Great Western railway line was requisitioned for the construction of a 
Royal Ordnance Factory. The factory, known as Royal Ordnance 
Factory Number 26, was built between May 1941 and February 1942 
and specialised in small arms ammunition manufacture.  It covered an 
area of 1.7km east to west by 1.0km. At the end of the war, in 1945, the 
Board of Trade took over the site for use as an industrial estate. 
11.6.45 
Within the wider area, the visually imposing northwards-facing 
escarpments and adjoining dramatic mountain masses of the Black 
Mountains, the Brecon Beacons, Fforest Fawr and Mynydd-y-glôg 
together form a vast natural ridge and physical barrier that divides mid-
Wales from the south. 
11.6.46 
East Fforest Fawr and Mynydd-y-glôg Historic Landscape Areas (lying 
to the north east of the Project Site) comprise an extensive area of 
unimproved moorland and rough grazing. The land is subdivided into 
generally large irregularly-shaped enclosures defined by dry stone 
walls. When viewed from the south near Hirwaun Common, the historic 
landscape area forms the mid distance view, with the Brecon Beacons 
in the far distance. 
11.6.47 
The area is rich in archaeological evidence, which points to quite 
intense occupation and land use with evidence of early agriculture and 
prehistoric and medieval settlement. By the early medieval period the 
area formed part of the cantref (hundred) of Cantref Mawr in the 
kingdom of Brycheiniog, which had emerged as one of the early British 
kingdoms in Wales by the 7th to 8th century AD. The kingdom was 
conquered by the Norman baron, Bernard de Neufmarché, in the late 
12th century and continued to be administered as a marcher lordship 
until the 16th century.  
11.6.48 
The greater part, if not the whole of the historic landscape area formed 
part of one of the largest hunting preserves in Wales, belonging to the 
lords of Brecknock known as Fforest Fawr or the Great Forest of 
Brecknock stretching for about 20 kilometres from east to west and 12 
kilometres from north to south (about 12 miles by 8 miles), called the 
Forestya de Brechonie (‘Forest of Brecon’) by the 1160s and 1170s. In 
documents of the early 17th century it is named as Forest y Brenin 
(‘King’s Forest’), the area having been forfeited to Henry VIII by the 
Duke of Buckingham in 1521.

11.6.49 
Fforest Fawr remained Crown property until the sale of the central part 
of the area in 1819. The unenclosed moorland within the historic 
landscape area was unaffected by this sale, however, and is still mostly 
Common Land/ Open Access Land. The historic landscape area falls 
wholly within the Brecon Beacons National Park.  
11.6.50 
Greater awareness of the surviving archaeological remains was a 
major factor in the inclusion of the East Fforest Fawr and Mynydd-y-
glog historic landscape area in the Register of Landscapes of Special 
Historic Significance in Wales, published under the auspices of Cadw, 
the Countryside Council for Wales and ICOMOS UK in 2001.  
11.6.51 
The historic landscape area now also falls within the Fforest Fawr 
Geopark, established to promote both the geological heritage and 
economic development of the area and granted recognition by the 
UNESCO Global Geopark Network in 2005. 
Visual Amenity 
Visual Receptors 
11.6.52 
Visual receptors, such as users of buildings, recreational spaces, 
footpaths and transport routes, have differing sensitivities to their visual 
environment. Generally, this is dependent upon their interest in the 
visual environment, their viewing opportunity and duration, and the 
context of the views. These factors may be expressed in terms of: 
� The value of the view/ viewpoint reflects the intrinsic character and 
scenic qualities of its location and context. Where recognised 
through the designation of an area, such as a National Park, 
National Scenic Area, value is increased, while the presence of 
detracting features in a view will generally reduce value. Higher 
value views/viewpoints are likely to be more sensitive to change; 
� The importance of the viewpoint – as indicated by some form of 
recognition, e.g. as noted in a guidebook, marked on the ground by 
a sign or other visible feature. The provision of facilities e.g. seating, 
parking, footpath may also indicate a location of higher importance. 
Views gained from locations where people gather outdoors may 
also be of higher importance; and  
� Viewers’ expectations, occupation and activities when experiencing 
the view.

Whilst the valley floor is extensive, it’s gently undulating and many local 
and distant views of the Project Site are screened by intervening 
buildings, vegetation and topography. However, from elevated positions 
such as the valley sides and plateau edges, panoramic views across 
the valley are possible from several locations.

Settlement/Residential 
11.6.54 
The Project Site is located on the outskirts of Hirwaun, within the 
County Borough of Rhondda Cynon Taf. Other villages in the locality 
include Penywaun, Rhigos and Croesbychan. There are a number of 
small hamlets in the area including Cefn Rhigos and Cwm-Hwnt. 
11.6.55 
The closest residential properties to the development are those in Halt 
Close, located off the Rhigos Road. The housing development includes 
a range of medium sized detached dwellings. 
Road & Public Rights of Way 
11.6.56 
The A465 passes to the north of the Project  Site on an elevated 
embankment dividing the Hirwaun Industrial Estate. With the planned 
upgrade of the Heads of the Valleys Road, it may result in higher 
volumes of traffic passing the Project Site. However, much of the 
Project Site is screened from road users by vegetation alongside the 
highway and within the industrial estate. Views are partial and in many 
cases, only the occasional glimpse of the area is available. 
11.6.57 
Road users along driving north along the A4061towards Hirwaun have 
extensive views out across the Hirwaun Valley and beyond to Mynydd-
y-glog in the mid distance (other side of the valley) and then beyond to 
the Brecon Beacons. Those using the A4059 will have much more 
restricted views of the Project Site due to vegetation and the natural 
topography screening the Project Site. 
11.6.58 
Local B Roads and trackways will have a variety of views of the Project 
Site. Many of the views from these roads are curtailed by local 
vegetation or buildings. 
11.6.59 
Important visual amenity considerations include public footpaths in the 
area and any Open Access Land (such as Hirwaun Common and 
Mynydd-y-glog).

carried out to identify useful viewpoints for the impact assessment. In 
all, 13 viewpoints (noted below as preliminary Viewpoints - (pVP) were 
visited. These locations were initially selected as they provided a range 
of appropriate receptors, provided good coverage of the local area and 
seemed likely to provide views of the Project Site. However, once out 
on site it was clear that much of the Project Site is not visible or only 
partially visible from key receptor points. 
11.6.61 
Therefore the list of viewpoints in the PEIR is only preliminary and will 
be further refined/ added to following discussions with NRW, RCTCBC 
and BBNPA. Following initial discussions with NRW and BBNPA a 
further 8 additional viewpoints (apVP) were identified to provide a wider 
coverage of the area. However, these have not yet been visited in the 
field. All 21 viewpoints are identified on Figure 11.3. A final agreed list 
of viewpoints will subsequently be used for the full assessment and for 
a selection of supportive photomontages. The field survey work will be 
undertaken during the winter season so that any intervening deciduous 
vegetation will be in its winter state without leaves. 
11.6.62 
The following description for the Preliminary Viewpoints are for the 
purposes of better understanding the local context. The additional 
preliminary viewpoints have not been visited in the field and are 
therefore not included in the descriptions.  An agreed set of viewpoints 
will be used for the actual assessment and fully described in the 
Environmental Statement.  
Preliminary Viewpoints 
11.6.63 
Thirteenth Avenue pVP1 is located at the junction of Thirteenth 
Avenue and Rhigos Road. At this point, the industrial estate is a mix of 
scattered offices and manufacturing units both in use and in a 
redundant state. There is no clear view of the Project Site as the 
natural topography and tall pine trees screen views to the east. 
11.6.64 
Sixteenth/Seventeenth Avenue pVP2 is located at the north western 
edge of Hirwaun Industrial Estate, at the junction of Sixteenth and 
Seventeenth Avenue. From the viewpoint there are views across 
scrubland with industrial units to the north and south. There is no clear 
view as the natural topography and tall pine trees help to screen the 
Project Site.

11.6.68 
Mount Pleasant pVP5 – No View.  
11.6.69 
Cemetery pVP6 is located within the Cemetery grounds, just off the 
A4059. The site is dominated by mature trees running along access 
roads forming avenue style planting. In the foreground a coal loading 
bay and conveyor unit dominate the view. The adjacent landscape is 
open pasture and scrub which forms part of the Blaen Cynon Special 
Area of Conservation. There is no clear view of the Project Site due to 
the natural topography and vegetative screening.

11.6.71 
Farmstead pVP13 – No View.  
11.6.72 
Pantcefnffordd pVP7 – No View.  
11.6.73 
SW Pantcefnffordd pVP8 is located in open countryside south west of 
Pantcefnffordd with clear views of Hirwaun and the valley below. The 
surrounding landscape consists of a country lane running through 
moorland and pasture with oak woodland (stunted) and scattered 
hawthorn. The white roofs of Hirwaun Industrial Estate are clearly 
visible from the viewpoint.  
11.6.74 
Smiths Avenue pVP9 – No View.  
11.6.75 
Gliding Club pVP10 – No View. 
Viewpoints for consultation 
11.6.76 
In addition to the list of preliminary agreed viewpoints above, a series of 
preliminary 
photomontages 
have 
been 
produced, 
showing 
a 
representation of how the Power Generation Plant may look from a 
range of locations around the Project Site. These photomontages are 
shown in Figures 11.5 – 11.11.  
11.6.77 
Although not all of these photomontages will be used in the final 
assessment, they nevertheless give a preliminary indication of how 
visible the Power Generation Plant is likely to be from a range of 
different locations.

Preliminary Assessment of Potential Impacts 
Key features of the proposed Project. 
11.7.1 
There are three key elements to the Project; the Power Generation 
Plant, the Gas Connection, and the Electrical Connection.  
Power Generation Plant 
11.7.2 
The Power Generation Plant comprises gas turbine generators, cooling 
equipment; workshops and stores; water tanks; administration and 
control building; gas receiving station; auxiliary boiler, transformers, 
gatehouse and various other buildings and associated equipment.  The 
‘worst case scenario’ which has been used for assessing the Power 
Generation Plant in this preliminary LVIA is set out in Table 11.1.  
11.7.3 
Construction / demolition and commissioning will take between 18 and 
36 months, depending on the final choice of plant configuration 
selected.  
11.7.4 
The main works associated with the construction / demolition phase 
would be the demolition of existing buildings, removal of old 
foundations / hardstanding, excavation and site levelling for new 
foundations and, potential piling (if required).  
11.7.5 
A small laydown area to the south of the main Power Generation Plant 
Site (to the south of Main Avenue) could be used as a laydown area for 
the storage of plant and equipment during construction. 
11.7.6 
Indicative dimensions of all plant items are provided in Table 4.1. 
11.7.7 
The key visual effects arising from the Power Generation Plant will be 
during the operational phase and will be in relation to the gas turbine 
generators and their associated stacks 35m high. Although the Power 
Generation Plant Site is already well screened by trees on the existing 
industrial estate, the stacks are likely to be visible from locations in and 
around the Project Site as well as from further afield.  
11.7.8 
Views from the southern side of the valley looking into the National 
Park will have the stacks in the foreground. These views into the 
National Park (in particular from the open access areas of Hirwaun 
Common) are the most significant and it will be important to protect the 
special qualities of the Park as viewed from outside the boundaries of 
the National Park. However, as these long distance views of the 
National Park are only obtainable from an elevated position, the view of 
the stacks will be from above. Therefore the stacks and buildings will 
be viewed from above and appear to have diminished height against

the background. An important visual element will be that the buildings 
and stacks will not be seen against the sky, but will be seen against a 
backdrop of other industrial buildings and roads and general woodland/ 
screen planting.  
11.7.9 
Views from the north side of the valley are from within the National 
Park. Recreational receptors within the Park are an important 
consideration as the amenity of key routes for walking, cycling and 
horse riding should not be detrimentally affected by development on 
this southern fringe. The open access areas of Moel Penderyn and 
Mynydd-y-glog will afford views along and across the Cynon Valley. 
Whilst the views to the south will be dominated by the hills overlooking 
the valley, the remnants of open cast coal mining, the infrastructure 
passing along the valley floor such as roads; former railway; overhead 
powerlines; and industrial units, all contribute towards an industrial/ 
peri-urban landscape within the valley. Therefore the significance of the 
visual effects of the power plant on views to the south will be much 
reduced due to the disturbed landscape surrounding the Project Site. 
Sources of potential impact during construction / demolition 
11.7.10 
The construction and commissioning of the Power Generation Plant will 
include all areas required for the permanent works as well as temporary 
construction areas. During this time potential adverse temporary 
landscape and visual effects will arise from the following activities: 
� 
Site clearance, removal of vegetation and topsoil stripping from the 
Project Site;  
� 
Earthworks to construct platforms and excavate foundations; 
� 
Construction of an internal road for access to the buildings and 
storage area; 
� 
Movement of construction / demolition related traffic including 
delivery and removal of materials to and from site, off-site road 
traffic including workers travelling to and from site; 
� 
General construction / demolition activities including the movement 
of large scale construction equipment, i.e. tower cranes, smaller 
cranes, batching plants drilling rigs etc; site compounds and 
temporary buildings required for construction and parking on site 
materials stockpiles; presence of temporary hoardings and 
protective fencing; temporary hoardings and protective fencing; and 
signage;  
� 
Construction site lighting, in particular during the winter months;  
� 
Construction of the Power Generation Plant and any other ancillary 
buildings; and

� 
Construction of the permanent perimeter security fence. 
11.7.11 
In addition there will be impacts associated with the construction of 
other infrastructure such as the Gas and Electrical Connection.  
Construction impacts would be similar to those described above. They 
would be temporary and would not require extensive areas of 
hardstanding.  
Sources of potential impact during operation 
11.7.12 
The following long term actions will contribute to the landscape and 
visual effects from the Project:   
� 
The introduction of the Power Generation Plant and permanent 
structures associated with the Gas and Electrical Connection. .  
The final layout proposal will incorporate a degree of flexibility with 
respect to the actual sizing and siting of buildings / structures; 
� 
The creation of new hard and soft landscape elements associated 
with the Power Generation Plant; 
� 
Increased vegetation cover following tree and shrub mitigation 
planting; 
� 
New perimeter security fencing along the boundary of the Project 
Site;  
� 
Operational traffic; and 
� 
Increased lighting.  
Sources of potential impact during decommissioning 
11.7.13 
Temporary landscape and visual impacts similar to those described for 
construction are likely to arise during decommissioning.   
Gas Connection (Options 1 and 2) 
11.7.14 
The Gas Connection comprises a new gas pipeline that connects the 
Power Generation Plant with Feeder 2 on the National Transmission 
System. The gas pipeline would be buried to a depth of cover, which is 
in accordance with recognised industry standards. For example, depths 
of cover would be: No less than 1.2m on agricultural land, No less than 
2m under road crossings; and No less than 1.7m under water 
crossings. The route of this pipeline is shown on Figure 4.2.  
11.7.15 
Two possible connection points have been identified as being potential 
locations to connect into the NTS Infrastructure.

Prepared by Parsons Brinckerhoff 
October 2013

- 304 - 
 
11.7.16 
Connection to the National Transmission System would require the 
installation of a Minimum Offtake Connection (MOC) facility of around 
30m x 30m and a Pipeline Inspection Gauge Trap facility (PTF) of 
around 30m x 23m, which would be located within the Power 
Generation Plant Site.  
11.7.17 
Technical advice would be sought from National Grid to establish 
planting restrictions in the vicinity of all above and below ground 
structures prior to developing the landscape strategy.  
11.7.18 
Hedge planting could be undertaken directly across the pipeline where 
visual screening is required and where it is necessary to gap up a field 
boundary hedge. Planting in these locations is undertaken using 
shallow rooting species including hawthorn, blackthorn, elder, hazel 
and privet. Dense mass planting cannot be undertaken within 10m of a 
pipeline, although individual specimens or a row of trees could be 
planted between 6 and 10m of it. Plant species should be selected from 
their list of suitable species. 
11.7.19 
Given the similarity of the landscape in which the two options are being 
proposed, there are not anticipated to be significant differences 
between the two options.  
11.7.20 
Visual amenity effects associated with the gas pipeline will be minimal 
as the pipeline will be underground. In sensitive landscapes the 
construction of an underground pipeline can have noticeable impacts 
on landscape features such as hedges, trees and leave crop marks in 
fields. Route Option 1 for the gas pipeline may have some minor effects 
on the landscape where it crosses hedge boundaries, but these 
crossings will be replanted and are unlikely to leave significant residual 
effects. Route Option 2 will have no landscape impact as it follows an 
existing road for the majority of its length.    
Electrical Connection (Options 1 and 2) 
11.7.21 
The Electrical Connection comprises a new 400kV underground cable 
or overhead line, running west from the boundary of the Power 
Generation Plant Site to the new Rhigos Substation (due 2016). A new 
banking compound would also be required, This would be situated 
within Power Generation Plant Site. 
11.7.22 
It is possible that the connection would be via underground cable 
(option 2) or overhead line (option 1). If an overhead line is required it is 
likely to have tower heights ranging between 35m and 45m depending 
on design requirements and have a span of approximately 250m. 
Detailed technical advice would be sought from National Grid prior to

developing the planting proposals. An overhead line may be considered 
preferable in order to avoid direct impacts on sensitive habitat land.  
11.7.23 
Should an underground cable be selected then this would be buried 
along its entire length. Therefore, an underground cable may be 
preferable to limit visual impact.  
11.7.24 
Electrical Connection route corridor option 1 will pass through the 
western part of the Hirwaun industrial estate. As it would be passing 
through an industrial landscape there will be no sensitive landscape 
receptors. However, the overhead lines would be viewed from the wider 
landscape and be visible from within the National Park. This effect 
would be tempered by a backdrop of existing infrastructure and 
buildings and in some views, partial screening by vegetation.  
11.8 
Possible Mitigation 
11.8.1 
Mitigation of adverse environmental impacts can be achieved by 
avoidance, reduction, remedying of, or compensation.  Primary 
mitigation measures form an intrinsic part of the Project design through 
an iterative process.  Secondary mitigation measures are those that are 
designed to address specifically the remaining (residual) adverse 
effects of the final development proposals.   
11.8.2 
Mitigation in the form of landscaping and the planting of trees and 
shrubs will be developed during the design of the building and 
structures and will be presented in the ES. Planting constraints are 
likely to exist in the vicinity of the Project Site. They may include buried 
archaeology, ecological habitats, and underground or overhead 
services. Mitigation planting will be developed to fulfil ecological 
objectives and enhance biodiversity where possible. The landscape 
strategy will comprise proposals for planting and its subsequent 
management for a minimum period of 5 years to ensure the landscape 
objectives are achieved successfully. 
11.8.3 
As part of the iterative design process for the development, primary 
mitigation relating to the design, layout, selection of materials and 
colours for the SCGT structures and associated infrastructure will be 
reviewed following this preliminary assessment. Planting to screen 
views from highly sensitive receptors will be incorporated into the 
Project Site landscape strategy where practical. 
Construction / Demolition 
11.8.4 
During construction / demolition, the following measures would be 
included in the CEMP:

- 306 - 
 
� Limiting land clearance and occupation to the minimum necessary 
for the works; 
� Temporary protection of vegetation and other vulnerable features to 
be retained in accordance with current industry standards and 
recognised best practice;  
� Temporary storage of topsoil and any other material considered of 
value for retention. Where practical stores would be sited to screen 
the construction works from highly sensitive receptors; 
� Design and layout of construction areas to reduce adverse impacts 
arising from the temporary security fencing and lighting;  
� Agreed site access routes; 
� Restricting construction site lighting outside normal working hours 
to the minimum required for workforce and public safety and 
security. Directional luminaries to be used to limit unwanted light 
spill; 
� Maintenance of tidy and contained site compound; 
� Temporal measures including the removal of all temporary 
structures and stockpiles when no longer required, and prompt 
reinstatement of temporary construction areas; 
� Spreading of topsoil, reseeding and planting within the Project Site 
and adjoining areas that are to be reinstated as soon as possible 
after sections of work are complete; and 
� Management of all reinstated area in accordance with a 5 year 
aftercare plan to ensure full and successful establishment of the 
planting to the approval of the planning authority.  
Operation 
11.8.5 
During operation, mitigation would include:  
� The high quality design of the proposed buildings, structures and 
perimeter security fencing; 
� Structure / hedgerow planting on the perimeter of the Power 
Generation Plant Site to reduce views of ground level operational 
activities;

� Planting with native species of trees and shrubs similar to those 
present nearby, using local provenance stock wherever possible, in 
order to enhance biodiversity and connect habitats to form an 
ecological network; 
� Amenity planting at the Power Generation Plant Site entrance using 
a proportion of large size trees for immediate effect; and 
� The design of external lighting to reduce trespass, glare and 
spillage and by restricting usage to the minimum periods required. 
Decommissioning 
11.8.6 
Decommissioning would comprise the removal of all Power Generation 
Plant items and restoration of the Project Site. Similar mitigation 
measures to those described above for construction would be 
implemented during decommissioning.   
11.9 
Preliminary Assessment of Residual Effects 
11.9.1 
On the basis of the preliminary environmental information and 
assessment described above, taking into account potential mitigation 
measures, a preliminary assessment is that there are unlikely to be 
significant impacts on the landscape or visual amenity of the area from 
construction / demolition, operation or decommissioning of the Project.  
11.9.2 
The Power Generation Plant Site is already well screened and 
additional screen planting is likely to be used as landscaping mitigation. 
The Project Site is currently industrial in nature and the Power 
Generation Plant Site is occupied by a large storage and distribution 
warehouse. There would therefore not likely be a significant change to 
the baseline.   
11.10 
Next Steps 
11.10.1 
A full landscape and visual impact assessment (LVIA) will be 
undertaken in accordance with the assessment methodology and 
significance criteria, to determine potential significant landscape and 
visual impacts and to develop appropriate mitigation. 
11.10.2 
Further consultation will be undertaken with RCTCBC and the BBNPA 
to select viewpoints to be assessed in the LVIA. Photomontages of the 
Project will be produced from selected viewpoints in consultation with 
the local planning authorities.

WASTE MANAGEMENT AND HEALTH 
12.1 
Introduction 
12.1.1 
This Section of the PEIR addresses the waste management strategy 
and potential public health impacts of the proposed Project.  
12.1.2 
At present, it is anticipated that the main potential impacts to human 
health arising from the proposed Project will result from changes to 
local air quality during the construction / demolition, operation and 
decommissioning stages. However, as with any project of this 
magnitude, there are also potential impacts arising from contaminated 
land, site run-off and noise impacts.  
12.1.3 
The biggest potential impacts regarding waste management will be 
from site preparation and demolition of existing buildings.  
12.1.4 
The results of preliminary technical assessments relating to specific 
environmental impacts are presented in Sections 6 to 11 and 13 to 14 
of this PEIR.  This section will consider these assessments and aims 
to: 
� 
identify impacts arising from the generation of waste during the 
construction / demolition, operational and decommissioning stages 
of the Project and assess the significance of these impacts and 
how they can be mitigated; and  
� 
describe other potential impacts arising from the Project which may 
be detrimental to human health and how these impacts can be 
mitigated. 
12.2 
Legislative and Policy Context 
National Policy Statements 
12.2.1 
NPS EN-1sets out assessment principles that are particularly likely to 
be relevant to energy NSIPs. In relation to waste and health related 
impacts it states: 
� 
Safety (paragraph 4.11) and Hazardous Substances (4.12): 
describes the relationship with other regimes and the general 
requirement that the decision maker will need to be satisfied that 
they are complied with.  
� 
Health (4.13): requires that an assessment of potential health 
impacts is made in relation to each element of the proposed 
Project, such as in relation to air quality, waste or noise and 
 
 
 
 
Hirwaun Power Project Preliminary 
Environmental Information Report 
 
HPP PEIR HIR4200PBENVRPTR30.docx 
Prepared by Parsons Brinckerhoff

- 312 - 
 
describing the relationship with other regimes, stating at 4.13.5 that 
where separate air quality regulations are (or will be) satisfied then 
the decision maker is likely to consider these effective mitigation, 
whereas for noise or other aspects it will take account of health 
concerns when setting requirements.  
� 
Waste Management (5.14): requires that waste is managed 
through the ‘waste hierarchy’, explains the relationship with the 
environmental permitting (EP) regime, and sets assessment 
principles to be used by the Secretary of State in determining a 
DCO Application for an energy NSIP.  These include the 
suggestion of a site waste management plan within the application, 
demonstrating that waste volumes are minimised, the impacts of at 
least the first five years of operation are assessed, and that waste 
is properly managed.  
Other National and Local Policy 
12.2.2 
Whilst the PA 2008 is clear as to the primacy of the relevant NPS, other 
national and local planning policy can be considered important and 
relevant by the Secretary of State in the determination of energy NSIP. 
12.2.3 
At a regional level (South East Wales), the Regional Waste Plan 
provides a long term strategic waste management strategy and land-
use planning framework for the sustainable management of waste and 
recovery resources in South East Wales.  One of its aims amongst 
others is to minimise the adverse impacts on the environment and 
human health. 
12.2.4 
At a local level, waste policy is addressed through the Rhondda Cynon 
Taf Council Local Development Plan (LDP) which was adopted in 2011.  
The council identifies that there needs to be a reduction in waste 
produced throughout the region, and a greater emphasis on re-using 
and recycling waste materials needs to be employed.  
12.2.5 
The council sets out its core strategy on waste in CS 9, and its area 
wide (North and South) policies in AW 2 sustainable locations, AW 4 
Community infrastructure and planning obligations.   
12.2.6 
These seek to protect humans and the wider environment from waste 
and pollutants by avoiding developments that could have adverse 
effects on both human and environmental receptors and where 
possible mitigate any possible effects by situating such developments 
in areas more suited to dealing with waste streams and pollutants.

12.3 
Realistic Worst Case Scenario for Assessment 
12.3.1 
In respect of waste management and health, the realistic worst case 
scenario from within the proposed Project parameters (which are 
described in Section 4 of the PEIR) are set out in Table 12.1 below.  
12.3.2 
The reason that the parameters identified in Table 12.1 represent the 
realistic worst case in relation to waste management and health 
impacts are that a greater number of gas turbine generator units will 
give rise to more waste during operation (e.g. more filters, more waste 
water from blade washing) and, as described in Sections 6 and 7 of this 
PEIR, give rise to the largest potential impacts in terms of air quality 
and noise, which, in turn has the potential for more detrimental impacts 
on human health.  
12.3.3 
A preliminary assessment of both options for the Gas Connection and 
the Electrical Connection is presented in this section.  A decision on the 
preferred option for each will be taken following consultation.

Assessment Methodology and Significance Criteria 
12.4.1 
The assessment methodology and significance criteria used in this 
section differ for each of the potential impacts considered. They are set 
out in detail in Sections 6-11 and 13-14 of this PEIR. Where the 
methodology differs for determining impacts specific to human health, 
these have been stated.   
12.5 
Consultation  
12.5.1 
A summary of the consultation responses received to date in relation to 
waste management and health and how these have been considered is 
provided in Table 12 in Appendix A of this PEIR.

12.6 
Baseline Conditions and Receptors 
12.6.1 
In terms of waste generation, the Power Generation Plant Site is within 
an area currently occupied by a large industrial building. As part of the 
construction / demolition works, the existing building, foundations and 
some of the associated hardstanding will need to be removed and 
disposed of. Some of the existing buildings which will be demolished as 
part of the construction of the Power Generation Plant are known to 
contain asbestos.  
12.6.2 
There is also the potential that, due to former site uses, land on which 
the Power Generation Plant is sited has been contaminated. Previous 
intrusive site investigations undertaken at the site of the Rhigos 
Substation recorded areas of made ground and deposits of ‘waste’ 
although no elevated concentrations of contaminant were recorded in 
comparison to CLEA guidelines.  
12.6.3 
For health impacts, the specific receptors for each area of impact 
considered within this PEIR (Sections 6 to 11 and 13 to 15) are 
discussed in those sections.   
12.6.4 
In general, for public health impacts to be realised, the following must 
exist: 
� 
A source of (e.g.) contamination, dust or nuisance noise;  
� 
A pathway; and 
� 
A human receptor.  
12.6.5 
Given the nature of the Project, there are potential sources of 
contamination (e.g. stack emissions may result in a change in air 
quality).  Therefore, to minimise public health impacts, the sources 
must be controlled and / or pathways to receptors must be blocked.  
12.6.6 
Receptors can become exposed to contamination via dermal contact, 
oral contact or inhalation of a contaminated medium. Receptor 
sensitivity varies in relation to health, age and duration of exposure. 
12.6.7 
In this Section, potential receptor groups refer only to human receptors 
that could potentially come into contact with contaminants resulting 
from the Project:  These receptors include: 
� 
Residents of surrounding towns / villages; 
� 
Adjacent commercial users; 
� 
Recipients of agricultural produce;

� 
Recreational users (e.g. users of public rights of way); and  
� 
Users of transport infrastructure.  
12.6.8 
Surrounding towns and villages include: 
� 
Rhigos (1.3km south west); 
� 
Hirwaun (1.4km east); 
� 
Penderyn (1.8km north); and  
� 
Aberdare (5km east).  
12.6.9 
Adjacent commercial users include other businesses within the 
Hirwaun Industrial Estate.  
12.6.10 
Section 4 of this PEIR provides further details of the proposed Project 
Site and its surroundings.   
12.7 
Air Quality 
12.7.1 
Section 6 of this PEIR provides a description of the preliminary 
assessment of the air quality impacts of the proposed Project 
undertaken as part of the EIA process.   
12.7.2 
The identified primary pollutants of concern from an air quality 
perspective are: 
� 
Dust (PM10 and PM2.5) during construction / demolition activities; 
and 
� 
Oxides of nitrogen (NOx) during operation. 
12.7.3 
Elevated levels of these pollutants could cause negative health impacts 
to human receptors. Children are particularly susceptible with regards 
to elevated NOx concentrations. 
12.7.4 
DEFRA provides health bandings for concentrations of air pollutants 
likely to induce public health impacts in susceptible individuals26. These 
can be used as guidelines against which the human health impact of 
emissions to air can be assessed.  For PM10 and NOx, details are 
provided in Table 12.2.

Additionally, the AQS Regulations specify a series of standards and 
objectives for air quality in the UK.  The objectives are summarised in 
Section 6 of this PEIR.   
Construction and Demolition  
Whole Project 
12.7.6 
During construction and demolition, dust emissions from the proposed 
Project will not be more significant than those normally encountered on 
construction sites.  The dust particles that may be emitted during 
construction would be of large diameter and would therefore tend to 
resettle on the ground within 100 m to 500 m of the source; 
approximately 70 per cent of the dust would generally settle out of the 
atmosphere within 200 m, and less than 10 per cent could be expected 
to remain at a distance of 400 m.  This is reflected in the distance-
related significance criteria presented in Section 6 of this PEIR.

12.7.7 
In order to limit any impacts, a CEMP will be prepared prior to 
construction, which will be prepared in accordance with the outline 
CEMP to be produced as an Appendix to the final EIA.  This will require 
HPL and its contractors to implement a comprehensive dust 
suppression / mitigation and monitoring programme, based on ‘The 
control of dust and emissions from construction and demolition – Best 
Practice Guidance’ (Greater London Authority, 2006).   
12.7.8 
The implementation of these mitigation measures, as appropriate to the 
level of risk for each area / activity within the construction site (and the 
access roads to the site) will ensure that the impact of dust emissions 
from the construction site will not be significant. This will prevent 
construction work generating levels of atmospheric dust and emissions 
which would constitute a health hazard or nuisance to local people or 
industry. 
Operation  
Power Generation Plant 
12.7.9 
To accommodate all operating scenarios for the Power Generation 
Plant, a stack height of at least 25 m would be required in order to 
ensure adequate dispersion of the principal emissions from the Power 
Generation Plant.   
12.7.10 
The preliminary results of the air dispersion modelling studies are 
presented in Section 6 of this PEIR which presents the anticipated 
maximum process contribution to ground level concentrations of the 
identified pollutants as a result of operation of the Power Generation 
Plant, together with an assessment of the significance of the resulting 
total predicted environmental concentration. 
12.7.11 
Based on the bandings shown in Table 12.2 and the anticipated air 
quality impacts (including the maximum predicted environmental 
concentration) of the Power Generation Plant detailed in Section 6 it is 
extremely unlikely that the Power Generation Plant will have any 
adverse public health impacts with respect to air quality.   
12.7.12 
Furthermore, in order that the Power Generation Plant operates in 
accordance with the appropriate legislation and guidance, and to avoid 
air quality reaching prolonged unsafe levels, the Power Generation 
Plant will be designed in accordance with the Best Available 
Techniques as outlined in the ‘Reference Document on Best Available 
Techniques for Large Combustion Plant’ (EU IPPC Bureau, 2006) and 
the Environment Agency (EA) Sector Guidance Note ‘How to comply 
with your environmental permit: Combustion Activities (EPR 1.01)’

(2009). This will be addressed through the Environmental Permit for the 
proposed Project. 
12.7.13 
The air quality assessment will also address the potential for impacts 
arising from increased vehicle movements as a result construction of 
the Project.  
Gas and Electrical Connection (Options 1 and 2) 
12.7.14 
The operation of the Gas and Electrical Connection (both options for 
each) are not considered to have the potential to give rise to any 
impacts on air quality. There will be no emissions resulting from their 
operation.  
Decommissioning  
Power Generation Plant 
12.7.15 
Works to decommission the structures within the Power Generation 
Plant Site will be similar to those for construction.  Therefore, the 
assessment undertaken for the construction phase is capable of acting 
as a proxy in each case for the demolition and decommissioning of the 
proposed Project.  The air quality assessment has adopted this 
approach.  Therefore, it is anticipated that the air quality impacts from 
decommissioning on public health will be similar to those for 
construction. 
Gas and Electrical Connection (Options 1 and 2) 
12.7.16 
Decommissioning of the Gas and Electrical Connection are not 
anticipated to have any impacts on human health as a result of 
changes to air quality. It is likely that the Gas Connection and Electrical 
Connection route corridor option 2 will be left in situ and no further 
ground disturbance will be caused. For Electrical Connection Option 1 
the overhead line will be removed and can be considered part of the 
overall decommissioning of the Power Generation Plant.  
Conclusion 
12.7.17 
Based on the results of the above assessments, it can be concluded 
that the proposed Project will result in no likely significant effects on 
public health with respect to air quality.

Section 7 of this PEIR provides details of the preliminary noise and 
vibration impact assessment undertaken for the proposed Project.

12.8.2 
The existing baseline conditions at NSRs in the vicinity of the proposed 
Project have been established by way of an attended noise survey as 
outlined in Section 7.   
12.8.3 
In order to determine the study area for the noise impact assessment, 
RCTCBC were consulted in order to agree a baseline noise survey 
methodology for the EIA for the Project.  These discussions identified 
the nearest residential properties that could potentially be affected by 
noise generated during construction / demolition, operation and 
decommissioning of the Project, and considered to be noise sensitive 
receptors (NSR).  These are set out below in Table 12.3.

Construction and Demolition  
Whole Project  
12.8.4 
Construction / demolition activity inevitably leads to some degree of 
noise disturbance at locations in close proximity to the construction 
activities.  It is however a temporary source of noise.  Noise levels at 
any one location will vary as different combinations of plant and 
machinery are used, and throughout the construction of the proposed 
Project as the construction / demolition activities and locations change. 
12.8.5 
The outline construction noise assessment identifies that the predicted 
cumulative construction level is below the daytime limit of 65 dB(A), 
and the evening and weekend limit of 55 dB(A) at all receptors.  
Therefore, the significance of the overall impact of construction noise is

predicted to be minor at all NSR locations, as stated in Section 7 of this 
PEIR.  
12.8.6 
Noise generating activities during construction and demolition will also 
be subject to the approved CEMP.  This will be secured by a 
requirement for the submission to and approval by RCTCBC of a 
CEMP (an outline of which will be produced as an Appendix to the final 
ES).  In addition, a requirement attached to the DCO will control noise 
levels at residential locations, and provide for the monitoring of noise 
levels at these locations during construction / demolition. 
Operation 
Power Generation Plant  
12.8.7 
The computer noise modelling software CadnaA (Version 4.1), which 
uses the ISO 9613 propagation algorithms has been used to undertake 
a provisional noise calculation.  The model estimates the contribution to 
noise levels at each NSR location, and has been created using a 
representative sound power level for the whole Project. 
12.8.8 
The model is intended to provide an indicative assessment only for the 
operational phase of the Project.  
12.8.9 
The detailed operational noise modelling will be undertaken as part of 
the EIA, when full details of all plant items will be available.  
12.8.10 
The predicted noise levels at sensitive receptors from the Project are 
used to inform the BS 4142 operational noise assessment. 
12.8.11 
The semantics used for assessing the likelihood of complaints due to 
the introduction of a new industrial noise source are as follows: 
� 
When subtracting the background level from the rating level, the 
greater the difference, the greater the likelihood of complaints. 
� 
A difference of around +10 dB or more indicates that complaints 
are likely. 
� 
A difference of around +5 dB is of marginal significance. 
� 
If the rating level is more than 10 dB below the measured 
background noise level then this is a positive indication that 
complaints are unlikely. 
12.8.12 
Table 7.9 shows that at locations 3, 4, 5 and 6 the predicted noise 
levels from the proposed plant are minor adverse whilst at locations 1 
and 2 predicted noise levels are major adverse. It is noted that the

operational noise predictions are subject to change following the 
detailed noise modelling that will be undertaken during the EIA. 
12.8.13 
A requirement attached to the DCO will require that an acoustic design 
report will be submitted to and approved by RCTCBC prior to 
commencement of construction / demolition.  This will ensure that the 
proposed Project incorporates noise-minimising measures by design.  
A requirement will provide for the on-going monitoring of noise at the 
boundary of the proposed Project Site to ensure that the specified 
noise levels for operation are met. 
Gas Connection (Options 1 and 2) 
12.8.14 
As stated in Section 7.7, there may be a very slight noise produced by 
the AGI associated with the Gas Connection. However, this will be 
barely perceptible and will not cause any impacts to human health.  
Electrical Connection Option 1 
12.8.15 
Should an overhead line be selected as the preferred Electrical 
Connection, there may be a very slight noise produced by electricity 
flowing through the line. However, this will be barely perceptible and 
will not cause any impacts to human health. 
Electrical Connection Option 2 
12.8.16 
Should an underground cable be chosen as the preferred connection 
option, there would be no perceptible noise produced during operation 
of the connection.  
Decommissioning 
Whole Project  
12.8.17 
Works to decommission the Power Generation Plant will be similar to 
those for construction.  Therefore, the assessment undertaken for the 
construction phase is capable of acting as a proxy in each case for the 
demolition and decommissioning of the proposed Project.   
Conclusion 
12.8.18 
Based on the results of the above noise and vibration assessments, it 
can be concluded that that the proposed Project will have no adverse 
effects during the construction phase. The preliminary results of the 
operational noise assessment suggest that noise impacts will range 
from minor to moderate adverse.

12.9 
Water Quality and Resources 
12.9.1 
Section 9 – Water Quality and Section 10 – Geology, Ground 
Conditions and Hydrogeology provide the water quality and resources 
impact assessments to date.  The public could be exposed to 
contaminated water via: 
� 
The recreational use of contaminated water;  
� 
Drinking contaminated drinking water; or, 
� 
Consuming agricultural produce which has come into contact with 
contaminated water.  
12.9.2 
Children and the elderly will be most vulnerable to negative health 
effects. 
12.9.3 
Exposure to contaminated water can have a wide range of health 
impacts.  For example, acute level exposure to Poly-aromatic 
hydrocarbons (PAHs) leads to red blood cell damage which can lead to 
anaemia and a suppressed immune system27.  
12.9.4 
Drinking water and surface water quality standards can be used to 
assess the safety of contamination levels.  For example, the maximum 
allowable concentration of PAHs in drinking water is 0.1 µg/l, with 
anything above this concentration deemed unsafe if ingested28.  
Construction and Demolition  
Whole Project  
12.9.5 
Several construction / demolition activities could require the disposal of 
water from the proposed Project Site including wheel washing facilities, 
welfare facilities and water used for dowsing (e.g. of cutting operations 
or stockpiles) and surface water runoff, as well as de-watering activities 
as a result of e.g. foundation excavation.   
12.9.6 
Construction activities may, if uncontrolled, potentially cause changes 
to surface water drainage due to the creation of soil piles formed during 
on-site excavation, levelling and other such on–site works.  Impacts 
would be associated with the potential to alter the efficiency /

performance of the existing land drainage systems both on-site and in 
the vicinity of the proposed Project Site.   
Operation 
Power Generation Plant  
12.9.7 
During the operation of a SCGT power plant which incorporates air 
cooling, the use of operational water is minimal, as water is not 
required for the generation of steam or for cooling.  
12.9.8 
As such, the water at the Project Site during operation will be primarily 
for maintenance and domestic sanitation, with a small quantity required 
for NOx control. 
12.9.9 
This domestic / sanitary water will be discharged to a drainage system. 
Where appropriate, this drainage will be passed through oil interceptors 
and sediment traps which will be removed from site for disposal by a 
suitably licensed contractor. 
12.9.10 
There will be no uncontrolled discharge to neighbouring watercourses. 
12.9.11 
The proposed Project Site will be predominantly covered with hard 
standing and surface water from any potentially contaminated areas will 
be retained on-site.   
12.9.12 
The design of the surface and foul water drainage scheme will be 
subject to approval by NRW prior to commencement of construction. 
12.9.13 
Access to the Power Generation Plant Site will be strictly controlled and 
security measures will incorporate suitable fencing and the use of 
security cameras.  These measures will be put in place to ensure 
controlled access Project such that no unauthorised persons will come 
into contact with any potentially contaminated materials.  Therefore no 
potential pathway exists to impact on public health from contaminated 
water on-site. 
12.9.14 
Given the depth and low hydraulic transitivity of the superficial deposits 
overlying the Secondary aquifer A in the area, the potential for 
contaminated water percolating beneath the proposed Project Site into 
the Aquifer is considered negligible.  
12.9.15 
The handling and storage of chemicals, fuels, oils and lubricants on-site 
for the purposes of operation will be controlled by a requirement.  This 
provides for the submission to and approval of handling and storage 
details to RCTCBC prior to commencement of operation of the 
proposed Project.

Gas and Electrical Connection (Options 1 and 2) 
12.9.16 
During operation, neither of the Gas Connection or Electrical 
Connection options require water. There will therefore be no impacts on 
water quality, resources or human health from operation of the 
connection.  
Decommissioning  
Whole Project 
12.9.17 
Works to decommission the Power Generation Plant and structures will 
be similar to those for construction.  Therefore, the assessment 
undertaken for the construction phase is capable of acting as a proxy 
for the demolition and decommissioning of the proposed Project. 
12.9.18 
The geology and land contamination assessment has adopted this 
approach.  Therefore, the surface water quality impacts from 
decommissioning on public health will be similar to those for 
construction.   
Conclusion 
12.9.19 
Based on the results of the above assessments, it can be concluded 
that the proposed Project will result in no significant adverse public 
health impacts with respect to surface water quality. 
12.10 
Geology and Land Contamination 
12.10.1 
Section 10 – Geology, Ground Conditions and Hydrogeology provides 
the impact assessment to date.  No ground investigations have been 
undertaken at the Project Site. However, given the previous site uses 
and the results of ground investigations at the adjacent Rhigos 
Substation development, there is the potential for contamination to be 
present at the Project Site.  This will be investigated in more detail as 
the EIA progresses.  
12.10.2 
Soil guideline values can be found on the NRW website29; these 
provide guideline daily and mean exposures to contaminants according 
to land-use (residential, allotment and commercial) and could be used 
as guidelines against which soil samples could be compared to ensure 
the safety of future users.

Construction / Demolition 
Whole Project 
12.10.3 
During construction / demolition, the existing soil conditions could 
potentially negatively impact upon construction workers.  However, 
potential impacts to health (arising from oral, inhalation or dermal 
contact with potential contaminants within the made ground) are 
negated by the implementation of the confirmed mitigation measures 
(as set out in Section 10 of this PEIR) at all times.  The most relevant of 
these confirmed measures is the appropriate use of PPE at all times.  
For the Power Generation Plant Site, when breaking ground, this PPE 
is likely to include gloves, mask, overalls and eye protection. 
12.10.4 
Additionally, an outline CEMP will include a suggested protocol to 
follow in the event of construction workers discovering contaminated 
material. 
12.10.5 
Potential impacts to public health (human receptors outside of the 
construction site) will be avoided by implementation of a Site Waste 
Management Plan, to be secured by a requirement.  Measures will also 
be implemented to prevent the escape of contaminants.  This will be 
secured by the CEMP, which must be approved by RCTCBC / NRW 
prior to commencement of construction / demolition. 
12.10.6 
Successful implementation of the mitigation measures discussed above 
and in Section 10 will result in there being no significant public health 
impact with regards to land contamination. 
Operation 
Whole Project 
12.10.7 
The proposed Project Site will predominantly comprise buildings and / 
or areas of hardstanding.  A small part of the proposed Project Site 
may be landscaped but no areas of exposed (unvegetated) soils will 
remain and any landscaped areas will be covered with 600 mm of clean 
cover.   
12.10.8 
Therefore the potential pathway between any ground contaminants and 
site users will be broken.  It is considered that the potential for direct 
contact (dermal, oral or inhalation) with any remaining contaminants 
present beneath the surface is extremely low for future site operatives.

Works to decommission the Power Generation Plant and structures on 
the proposed Project Site will be similar to those for construction. 
Therefore, the assessment undertaken for the construction phase is 
capable of acting as a proxy in each case for the demolition and 
decommissioning of the Project.  The geology and land contamination 
assessment has adopted this approach.   
12.10.10 
Therefore, the geology and land contamination impacts from 
decommissioning on public health will be similar to those for 
construction.   
Conclusion 
12.10.11 
Based on the results of the above assessments, it can be concluded 
that that the proposed Project will result in no significant public health 
impacts with respect to geology and contamination.  
12.10.12 
The Power Generation Plant Site is an existing industrial site covered in 
buildings and hardstanding. The construction of the Power Generation 
Plant is likely to require site remediation in the form of removal of 
existing potentially contaminative materials (e.g. asbestos in existing 
buildings) upgrading of drainage systems and removal / covering of any 
ground contamination. Construction of the Power Generation Plant 
would not require the removal of any land currently used for agriculture. 
Therefore, based on the preliminary assessment undertaken to date 
(following the assessment criteria outlined in Tables 10.2-10.4), there is 
considered to be a moderate beneficial impact 
12.11 
Waste 
12.11.1 
In terms of waste generation, the Power Generation Plant Site is within 
an area currently occupied by a large industrial building. As part of the 
construction works, the existing building, foundations and some of the 
associated hard standing will need to be removed and disposed of. 
Some of the existing buildings which will be demolished as part of the 
construction of the Power Generation Plant are known to contain 
asbestos.  
12.11.2 
There is also the potential that, due to former site uses, land on which 
the Power Generation Plant is sited is contaminated.  
12.11.3 
The pathways for waste from the proposed Project to impact upon 
human receptors will potentially be through: 
� 
Inhalation of emissions from waste; and

� 
Dermal contact / ingestion of leachate from waste that could 
contaminate soils.  
12.11.4 
The proposed Project will operate in full accordance with the Waste 
Framework Directive, the EPR and the Waste (England and Wales) 
Regulations 2011 (where relevant).  HPL, at all phases of the Project, 
will seek to apply the waste hierarchy as part of their waste prevention 
and management policy. 
12.11.5 
The waste hierarchy consists, in order of preference, of: 
� 
Prevention; 
� 
Re-use; 
� 
Recycling; 
� 
Other recovery (e.g. energy recovery); and 
� 
Disposal. 
Construction / Demolition 
Whole Project 
12.11.6 
A CEMP will be produced, which provides for the submission of 
construction method statements for approval by the local authority prior 
to commencement of construction, secured by a requirement attached 
to the DCO.  
12.11.7 
Measures will include, amongst others, the stockpiling of excavated 
spoil and testing for Waste Acceptance Criteria, to determine whether it 
can be re-used on- or off-site, and the testing and removal, as 
appropriate, of any water from de-watering activities which will be 
handled by a suitably licensed waste contractor. 
12.11.8 
The CEMP will ensure that all construction waste will be dealt with in a 
manner that complies with relevant legislation and (upon leaving the 
Project Site) waste will be treated and disposed of by suitably licensed 
contractors.  Where hazardous waste is transported from the proposed 
Project Site, it will be handled in accordance with relevant regulations, 
and, where necessary, be transported in sealed tankers.  
12.11.9 
Any asbestos present in the existing buildings at the Power Generation 
Plant Site which are to be demolished as part of the construction works 
will be removed and disposed of by a suitably licensed asbestos 
contractor. All works would be subject to a detailed working method 
statement and work would adhere to the “Control of Asbestos 
Regulations 2012” and associated guidance.

Operation 
Whole Project 
12.11.10 
A feature of the gas turbine generator technology to be incorporated in 
the proposed Project is that waste generated should be minimal and 
will be restricted to the following:   
� 
General office wastes;  
� 
Used GT air intake filters (typically replaced annually); 
� 
Used ion exchange resins or used RO membranes (typically 
replaced every 5 to 10 years); 
� 
Separated oil / sludge from oil / water separators; and 
� 
Used oil, chemicals or chemical containers.   
Waste Classifications 
12.11.11 
There are a number of steps required in order to determine if a waste is 
hazardous or non-hazardous, as described in the EA “Technical 
Guidance WM2 - Interpretation of the definition and classification of 
hazardous waste” (2013). 
12.11.12 
The revised Waste Framework Directive (rWFD) (2008/98/EC) provides 
a Europe-wide definition of hazardous waste as, “a waste possessing 
one or more of the 15 hazardous properties set out in Annex III of the 
rWFD,” and requires the correct management and regulation of such 
waste.  Waste classification is based on the European List of Waste 
(Commission Decision 2000/532/EC) (formerly the European Waste 
Catalogue) and the ‘hazardous properties’ provided in Annex III of the 
rWFD. 
12.11.13 
There are three categories of entries in the List of Waste (LoW): 
� 
Absolute entries are automatically considered hazardous; 
� 
Mirror entries are linked entries that are considered hazardous (or 
non-hazardous) if they contain “dangerous substances” and the 
waste 
possesses 
properties 
specified 
in 
Regulation 
(EC) 
1272/2008 on the classification, labelling and packaging of 
substances and mixtures; and 
� 
Non-Hazardous entries are neither absolute or mirror entries. 
12.11.14 
For the wastes identified in Paragraph 12.9.6, the relevant entries of 
the LoW are presented in Table 12.3.

removed from site by suitably licensed contractors that have the capacity to process such items. 
Waste Storage and Disposal 
12.11.15 
In addition, building waste will be produced.  In order to facilitate the 
implementation 
of 
the 
Waste 
Framework 
Directive 
during 
decommissioning, much of the structures and equipment for the 
proposed Project will be made of materials suitable for recycling as far 
as is practicable.  For example, a large proportion of the buildings will 
be constructed of pre-fabricated steel and will therefore be of interest to 
scrap metal merchants.   
12.11.16 
Only small quantities of potentially hazardous waste will be stored on-
the Project Site at any time, and any such substances will be held in 
secured containers to prevent contaminant migration.  Closed storage 
facilities or suitable dampening techniques will be utilised within the 
Project where emissions of dust etc. from waste are possible.  All 
mitigation measures will be in full accordance with industry good 
practices. 
12.11.17 
All waste will be dealt with in a manner that complies with the relevant 
regulations and (upon leaving the Project Site) waste will be treated 
and disposed of by suitably licensed contractors.   
Decommissioning 
Whole Project 
12.11.18 
A full Environmental Departure Audit will be carried out prior to 
decommissioning.  
This will examine, in detail, all potential 
environmental risks existing at the proposed Project Site and make 
comprehensive recommendations for any remedial action required to 
remove such risks.

12.11.19 
The decommissioning process will be in full accordance with the 
prevailing legislation, guidance will be followed and the departure audit 
will be complied with.  
12.11.20 
Following completion of the demolition, a Final Environmental 
Departure Audit will be carried out to ensure that all remedial work has 
been completed successfully; the audit reports will be made available 
to any future users of the Project Site. 
Conclusion 
12.11.21 
Based on the results of the above assessments, it can be concluded 
that that the proposed Project will result in no adverse public health 
impacts with respect to waste.  
Potential Mitigation Measures  
12.11.22 
In order to limit impacts to human health resulting from air quality, 
noise, or contamination, mitigation measures which are set out in 
Sections 6, 7, 9 and 10 of this PEIR are considered to be appropriate to 
mitigate any impacts to human health.  
12.11.23 
In terms of potential impact from waste, the following mitigation 
measures will be applied: 
� 
Any substances will be held in secured containers to prevent 
contaminant migration.  Closed storage facilities or suitable 
dampening techniques will be utilised within the Project where 
emissions of dust etc. from waste are possible.  All mitigation 
measures will be in full accordance with industry good practices. 
� 
All waste will be dealt with in a manner that complies with the 
relevant regulations and (upon leaving the site) waste will be 
treated and disposed of by suitably licensed contractors. 
� 
A CEMP will be produced, which provides for the submission of 
construction / demolition method statements 
� 
Measures will include, amongst others, the stockpiling of excavated 
spoil and testing for Waste Acceptance Criteria, to determine 
whether it can be re-used on- or off-site, and the testing and 
removal, as appropriate, of any water from de-watering activities 
which will be handled by a suitably licensed waste contractor. 
� 
The CEMP will ensure that all construction waste will be dealt with 
in a manner that complies with relevant legislation and (upon 
leaving the site) waste will be treated and disposed of by suitably 
licensed contractors.  Where hazardous waste is transported from

the proposed Project Site, it will be handled in accordance with 
relevant regulations, and, where necessary, be transported in 
sealed tankers.  
� 
Any asbestos present in the existing buildings at the Power 
Generation Plant Site which are to be demolished as part of the 
construction works will be removed and disposed of by a suitably 
licensed asbestos contractor. All works would be subject to a 
detailed working method statement and work would adhere to the 
“Control of Asbestos Regulations 2012” and associated guidance.  
12.12 
Preliminary Assessment of Residual Effects 
12.12.1 
On the basis of the preliminary environmental information and 
assessment described above, taking into account potential mitigation 
measures, there are not predicted to be likely significant effects on 
waste management and public health as a result of the proposed 
Project.

TRAFFIC, TRANSPORT AND ACCESS 
13.1 
Introduction 
13.1.1 
This Section considers the likely impacts of the Project on the local 
transport network. A Transport Assessment (TA) will be prepared as a 
separate document to accompany the proposed DCO Application.  This 
Section will report on the relevant findings at this preliminary stage of 
the assessment. 
13.2 
Legislative and Policy Context 
13.2.1 
The following describes the existing policy and existing transport 
infrastructure. 
13.2.2 
The TA will be prepared in accordance with the Department for 
Transport’s Guidance on Transport Assessments which present a 
framework for assessing development in the context of its impact on 
their transportation assets. 
National Policy Statements 
13.2.3 
As explained in Section 2, the NPS EN-1 explains the assessment 
principles to which the SoS will have regard in the examination of an 
energy NSIP (such as the proposed Project), and explains the generic 
traffic and transport impacts with regard to energy infrastructure.  
Specific considerations for fossil fuel generating stations are provided 
in the NPS for Fossil Fuel Generating Infrastructure (EN-2). The NPSs 
for Gas and Oil Pipelines (EN-4) and Electricity Networks Infrastructure 
(EN-5) provide specific considerations potentially relevant to the Gas 
Connection and Electrical Connection respectively. 
13.2.4 
Whilst the PA 2008 is clear as to the primacy of the relevant NPS, other 
national and local planning policy can be considered important and 
relevant by the SoS in the determination of an energy NSIP. 
13.2.5 
Section 5.13 of the National Policy Statement (NPS) for Energy EN-1 
considers the impacts of traffic and transport.  Paragraph 5.13.2 states 
that ‘The consideration and mitigation of transport impacts is an 
essential part of the Government’s wider policy objectives for 
sustainable development’, therefore, it is necessary for projects that are 
likely to have significant transport implications a Transport Assessment 
and if appropriate a Travel Plan should be included.   
13.2.6 
The NPS states that where substantial impacts arise on the 
surrounding transport infrastructure, applicants should seek to mitigate 
them, including during the construction phase. The Infrastructure

Planning Commission may attach requirements where there is likely to 
be substantial HGV traffic, to control HGV numbers, parking and 
disruption.    
Guidance on Transport Assessments (March 2007) 
13.2.7 
This document leads on from the PPG13 document, providing 
information on how to prepare a TA. 
13.2.8 
The paper outlines the need for the TA to encourage sustainable 
access and mitigate residual impacts of vehicles. It states that the goal 
of a TA is to estimate the impacts of the development and improve 
accessibility and safety for all modes, putting the focus on using public 
transport, walking and cycling. 
Planning Policy Wales, Edition 5, November 2012 
13.2.9 
Planning Policy Wales (PPW) sets out the land use planning polices of 
the Welsh Government (WG) and is supplemented by a series of 
technical advice notes.  
13.2.10 
Transport guidance is outlined in Chapter 8 of the document.  The 
guidance follows the guiding principle that new development should 
wherever possible be “accessible in the first instance by walking and 
cycling, then by public transport and then finally by private motor 
vehicles” (PPW5, para. 8.1.3). 
13.2.11 
A brief overview of the transport objectives are set out below: 
� 
Locating development where there is good access by public 
transport, walking and cycling 
� 
Locate developments near related uses to enable multi-purpose 
trips, thus reducing the number and length of journeys 
� 
Supporting the provision of high quality public transport 
� 
Supporting necessary infrastructure improvements 
� 
Promoting sustainable transport options for freight, commerce and 
also rural areas 
� 
Ensuring that transport is accessible to all, taking into account the 
needs of disabled and other less mobile people 
Technical Advice Note 18 (Transport) 
13.2.12 
TAN 18 was published by the WG in March 2007 and is a 
supplementary document to Planning Policy Wales (PPW). It provides

guidance on issues relating to sustainable development through 
transport. 
13.2.13 
By integrating land use planning and transport, TAN 18 can help the 
WG achieve its wider sustainable goals, such as: 
� 
Promoting resource and travel efficient settlement patterns 
� 
Support the provision of high quality public transport 
� 
Demand management through road user charging and workplace 
parking levy 
� 
Road traffic reduction   
� 
Ensure that major travel generating developments are easily 
accessible by a range of transport modes from nearby residential 
areas   
� 
Inclusive mobility and access for disabled people 
� 
Public transport integration across a wider area 
13.2.14 
With particular relevance to the Project, TAN 18 states that new 
developments or major alterations to existing developments must 
include appropriate provision for pedestrians (including those with 
special access and mobility requirements), cyclists, public transport, 
and traffic managements and parking provision. 
13.2.15 
In addition, developments that may incur an increase in travel demand 
should consider the potential for changing existing unsustainable travel 
through a coordinated approach to the development plan application 
and transport improvement.   
Wales Transport Strategy (2008) 
13.2.16 
The Wales Transport Strategy ‘One Wales: Connecting the Nation’ was 
published in April 2008 by the WG. The main goal of this legislation is 
to  ‘promote sustainable transport networks that safeguard the 
environment while strengthening our country’s economic and social 
life’. 
13.2.17 
The following are identified as key points within the strategy: 
� 
Integrate local public transport with any new developments 
� 
Improve access to education, training, and lifelong learning 
� 
Improve access to shops and leisure facilities

Wales Infrastructure Investment Plan 
13.2.18 
The WG is responsible for planning, constructing, and maintaining all of 
Wales’ 1000 miles of Trunk Roads and 75 miles of Motorways’. The 
Wales Infrastructure Investment Plan (WIIP) for Growth and Jobs ‘sets 
out the WG strategic investment priorities’ through to 2014/15. 
13.2.19 
The priorities relevant to the proposed Project are: 
� 
Economic growth – addressing urban congestion and improving 
access to key areas 
� 
Improving inter-modal transport links 
� 
Delivering more efficient and economical public services 
� 
Improving the quality of the educational estate, particularly schools 
CSS Wales Parking Standards (2008) 
13.2.20 
The standards outlined within this document aim to achieve ‘a 
transparent and consistent approach to the provision of parking, 
submission of travel plans and sustainability considerations that will 
inform developers, designers and builders what is expected of them 
and from them at an early stage of the development process’. 
13.2.21 
Information is contained within the document relating to Industry and 
Industrial Warehousing although no reference is made to construction 
phases of these developments. 
South East Wales Transport Alliance Regional Transport Plan  
13.2.22 
South East Wales Transport Alliance (SEWTA), which includes ten 
constituent councils, produced a 15 year long Transport Plan in 2010, 
and thus details the regional transport strategy from 2010 to 2025. The 
vision of the plan is to develop a ‘modern, accessible, integrated and 
sustainable transport system for South East Wales which increases 
opportunity, promotes prosperity for all and protects the environment’. 
(SEWTA Regional Transport Plan, Page 18). 
13.2.23 
The Regional Transport Plan outlines thirteen main objectives, grouped 
under five headings, which are presented below.

RCTCBC Local Development Plan up to 2021 
13.2.25 
The current transport policy relating to development in the County 
Borough is stated in the RCTCBC Local Development Plan (LDP), 
adopted in March 2011 and covers the period up to 2021.  This local 
development plan will be the basis for judging planning applications 
over that period.   
13.2.26 
The vision of the RCTCBC: “working together to enable individuals and 
communities to achieve  their  full  potential,  in  terms  of  both  their  
work  and social life.” 
13.2.27 
The sections of ‘Policy CS 1 – Development in the North’ directly 
relevant to transport are: 
� 
Promoting accessibility by securing investment in new roads, public 
transport improvements, walking and cycling; and 
� 
Promoting and enhancing transport infrastructure services to 
support growth and investment 
13.2.28 
‘Policy CS 8 – Transportation’ sets out the strategic routes in the 
County Borough which any proposals will be expected to safeguard 
and contribute towards the development of. The LDP also emphasises 
the importance of public transport improvements and walking and 
cycling provision when considering the transport needs of any proposal. 
13.2.29 
The Northern Strategic Area Policy ‘NSA 3 – Development in the key 
settlement of Hirwaun’ highlights the potential for residential, 
commercial and community development in the town, and the fact that 
any such growth must be supported by appropriate local services and 
infrastructure in order to meet present and future needs. The report 
also identified the need to create sustainable access to employment 
opportunities and to encourage the sustainable use and improvements 
of the transportation network.

A465 (Heads of the Valleys Road) - Dualling Scheme (Welsh 
Government website) 
13.2.30 
This major project is part of the National Transport Plan and is intended 
to improve links to businesses and communities, ease traffic 
congestion and improve safety. The scheme comprises widening of 
approximately 40km of the A465 between Hardwick Roundabout at 
Abergavenny and the existing roundabout to the west of Hirwaun. 
13.2.31 
The last section of the scheme is within close proximity of the proposed 
power station; however construction has not yet started. It also does 
not yet have a programme date, but is planned to commence in time for 
completion in 2020.  
13.2.32 
The TA will consider the proposed network changes including any 
overlap of construction phasing for the Project and the A465 
construction.

Realistic Worst Case Scenario for Assessment 
13.3.1 
In respect of traffic, transport and access, the realistic worst case 
scenario from within the proposed Project parameters (which are 
described in Section 4 of the PEIR) are set out in Table 13.1 below.    
13.3.2 
The reason that this represents the realistic worst case in relation to 
traffic, transport and access impacts is that the more gas turbine 
generator units required, the more deliveries are required during 
construction.  Five is the maximum number of units being considered 
for this Project. More units will also generate the most vehicle 
movements during operation for maintenance visits etc.  
13.3.3 
A preliminary assessment of the traffic impacts and residual effects of 
both options for the Gas Connection (Corridor 1 and 2) and the 
Electrical Connection (Corridor 1 and 2) has been undertaken and 
there are no material differences in their impacts on traffic and 
transport. A decision on the preferred option for each will be taken 
following consultation.

Assessment Methodology and Significance Criteria  
Transport Assessment Scope 
13.4.2 
A meeting was held with the Local Highways Authority and the South 
Wales Trunk Road Agent in September 2013 in order to discuss the 
scheme with these Authorities and the potential impacts of the Project 
and the available data sources to assist with the assessment. 
13.4.3 
At the time of writing, the content of the provisional TA is still being 
scoped with these authorities. It was agreed at the meeting that the 
scope of the TA would include a number of assumptions about the 
Project given the limited level of detail that is known about the exact 
construction methods, as they are dependent on the final choice of 
technology. At this stage, it is anticipated that the proposed structure of 
the TA is: 
� 
Introduction - Describing the scale and location of the Project. 
� 
Policy Context - highlighting how the Project fits with national, 
regional and local policy, and identifying policies that will guide the 
content of the TA.  
� 
Existing Conditions - details on the surrounding transport network, 
including committed development and infrastructure in the local 
area, and the spatial and temporal scope of the traffic impacts.  
� 
Assessment Methodology - a description of the data collection, use 
of existing data sources, trip generation and trip distribution 
methodologies used, and a summary of the assessment outcome. 
� 
Link and Junction Capacity Analysis - an assessment of the 
capacity of the links across the network. 
� 
Road Safety Analysis - an assessment of the study area accident 
record. 
� 
Environmental Impacts – an assessment of transport against 
sensitive receptors.

13.4.4 
During the scoping process, it was indicated that there will need to be 
consideration of the transport impacts for the construction / demolition, 
operational and decommissioning phases of development, and as such 
these shall be considered within the TA chapter. 
13.4.5 
The TA will establish the existing capacity and speed conditions around 
the Project Site and assess network and corridor performance in 
relation to a number of receptors. This will be based on data collected 
on site and existing data. 
13.4.6 
The TA will present the findings of trip estimates from the Project, the 
mode split of all trips, and the likely distribution across the transport 
network. Forecasting of baseline traffic data will be carried out to 
establish a ‘do minimum’ scenario for a future year. 
13.4.7 
The impact of the Project will be established by adding trips associated 
with the Project to the ‘do minimum’ scenario to create a ‘do something’ 
and the impacts will be presented in the TA. If necessary, mitigation 
measures will be proposed to reduce the number of trips, or provide 
capacity to cater for these additional trips. 
13.4.8 
A Travel Plan will be created and adopted in which sustainable 
transport will be promoted throughout the life cycle of the Project. 
Study Area 
13.4.9 
The Study Area used for this assessment is approximately a 5km 
radius from the centre of the Project Site.  
Environmental Impacts 
13.4.10 
Potential environmental impacts are likely to be most significant for 
receptors within the local community, and employees at the Project, 
although any user of the highway network or of the local public rights of 
way around the Project could be impacted. 
13.4.11 
The likely effects of the Project in environmental terms will be evaluated 
in accordance with the Institute of Environmental Assessment’s (IEA) 
‘Guidelines for the Environmental Assessment of Road Traffic’ (1993). 
This evaluation will be informed by the findings of the TA.

13.4.12 
The proposed scheme may cause potential effects to both motorised 
and non-motorised users and it will be ensured that effects for all 
modes of transport are considered and kept to a minimum. 
13.4.13 
As further work is progressed in the full TA, the transport related 
environmental effects (as defined by IEA guidelines) will be assessed 
for the following factors: 
� 
Traffic flows 
� 
Delay 
� 
Road safety 
� 
Intimidation and fear 
� 
Severance 
� 
Pedestrian amenity 
13.4.14 
The effects of traffic in relation to noise and vibration, and air quality will 
be considered in relevant sections of the EIA. 
13.4.15 
The following describes how these effects may be caused, the 
consequences, and how the significance of these effects can be 
measured. 
Traffic Flows 
13.4.16 
The Project is expected to result in changes in traffic flow for each of 
the construction, operation and decommissioning phases. 
13.4.17 
Changes can be considered as having a negative effect if there is a 
larger traffic flow, which can result in congestion, delay, severance and 
a polluted, unattractive and stressful environment. A larger traffic flow 
could be caused by an increase in vehicle demand, or through an 
increase in the number of HGVs. 
13.4.18 
Changes may also have a positive effect, if the consequence of the 
Project is a reduced traffic flow. This, for example, could be the 
outcome of one development which presently generates a high volume 
of traffic being replaced with a much less traffic intense development. 
Reduced traffic flows can result in an improvement in congestion, delay 
and overall amenity of the environment. 
13.4.19 
IEA provides guidance on how the magnitude of changes in traffic flow 
should be determined, as shown in Table 13.3.  
Table 13.3: Criteria Defining Magnitude of Change in Traffic Flow

Magnitude

Considerable change in condition

Medium 
Readily apparent change in

Low 
Perceptible change in conditions (30-
60%) 
Very Low 
No discernible change in conditions 
(0-30%) 
13.4.20 
The overall significance of change is categorised based on the 
sensitivity of the receptor as shown in Table 13.4. For many effects, 
there are no simple rules or formulae which define thresholds of 
significance and there is, therefore, a need for interpretation and 
judgement on part of the assessor, backed-up by data or quantified 
information wherever possible. Consultation with stakeholders will 
enable determination of the sensitivity of each receptor.

13.4.21 
The positive or negative effect of changes may therefore vary across 
receptors, with some road links experiencing a positive impact or being 
of low sensitivity, whereas others may have high sensitivity and high 
magnitude of impact and these will be identified accordingly.  
13.4.22 
Effects of moderate significance or above are considered to be 
significant for the purposes of the EIA Regulations.

for Hirwaun Power 
 
- 347 - 
 
Delay 
13.4.23 
An increase in delay, i.e. time spent in traffic queues is a negative 
effect that has repercussions in terms of pollution, accessibility, 
severance, and driver stress. Increases in delay can be the result of 
junctions and links operating above capacity, or due to the 
implementation of speed restrictions. 
13.4.24 
A decrease in delay is a positive effect that can lead to reductions in 
pollution and stress and improvements to accessibility and severance. 
A decrease would most likely be the result of improved junction 
capacity, either as a result of reduced traffic flow or a reengineered 
junction. 
Road Safety 
13.4.25 
The Project may have road safety implications, either in terms of an 
improvement or deterioration of the effect. Road safety has further 
implications in terms of driver stress, intimidation and fear, and 
severance. 
13.4.26 
Analysis within the TA will be able to provide a qualitative assessment 
of the quantity and cause of accidents and identify any patterns that 
may be exacerbated or mitigated by the Project. 
Intimidation and Fear 
13.4.27 
Intimidation and fear can be caused by a wide range of factors 
including location, highway layout, level of crime, and driver stress. 
However as discussed in the IEA guidelines, there are no commonly 
agreed thresholds for estimating these from other measurable factors. 
13.4.28 
Therefore a qualitative judgement, based on content of the TA including 
the site audit and non-motorised user assessment would be used to 
determine the intimidation and fear effect of the Project. 
Severance 
13.4.29 
The IEA guidelines describe severance as a perceived division that can 
occur within a community when it becomes separated by a major traffic 
artery. This, for example, may be a pedestrian unable to cross a road 
as a result of a large volume of traffic, or the loss of a public right of 
way or cycle lane. 
13.4.30 
It will be possible, using the Site Audit and Non-motorised User 
Assessment sections of the TA to provide a qualitative assessment of 
the effect the Project has on severance.

Pedestrian Amenity 
13.4.31 
Pedestrian Amenity is defined within the IEA guidelines as the ‘relative 
pleasantness of a journey’. This is affected by traffic flow, traffic 
composition, pavement width and separation from traffic. 
13.4.32 
A qualitative assessment of the effect of the Project on pedestrian 
amenity can be given using the Site Audit and Non-motorised User 
Assessment included in the TA, with particular consideration given to 
any key public rights of way identified during the stakeholder 
consultation process.

A preliminary assessment of the likely impacts listed above for each of 
the elements of the Project and each project phase is presented below.

Rail Services 
13.6.7 
Aberdare is the nearest railway station, approximately 7km south west 
of the Project Site and is an important local transport hub .  The rail 
station can be accessed using the bus services above, but it is 
approximately 180m  from the bus stop on Duke Street in Aberdare to 
the Station. 
13.6.8 
Rail services are managed by Arriva Trains Wales.  A half hourly 
service operates to Cardiff, from which it is possible to catch trains to 
London, Bristol, the North and Swansea, as well as other local 
services. 
Parking Provision 
13.6.9 
Car parking will be provided within the compound of the Power

Fifth Avenue forms an arc running north-south from Rhigos Road 
towards the underpass of the A465 where it then runs parallel with the 
A465 before it joins with Halt Road at the west of the Industrial Estate. 
The road has a 30mph speed limit for the majority of its length. Fifth 
Avenue has a roundabout junction with Main Avenue (described below) 
on which the Power Generation Plant Site is located. 
13.6.15 
Main Avenue is also a local road within Hirwaun Industrial Estate that 
runs east-west through the centre of the industrial estate and is the 
road on which the Power Generation Plant Site is proposed. It has the 
same speed limit as Fifth Avenue at 30mph. At the opposite end to its 
junction with Fifth Avenue, Main Avenue meets Thirteenth, Fourteenth 
and Sixteenth Avenue, all of which are a similar standard.  
Junctions 
13.6.16 
Consideration will be given to the assessment of junctions within the 
area and will be identified in collaboration with RCTCBC and SWTRA 
at a later stage. 
Access 
13.6.17 
Access to the Power Generation Plant and Electrical Connection for 
both construction and operational vehicles will be from Main Avenue via 
an existing gated access for International Greetings UK Ltd. A view

An initial review of accident data shows that there were 16 accidents 
between 2009 and 2011 in the study area.  There were no accidents 
along Rhigos Road or Main Avenue.  There was a serious collision 
between two vehicles on Fifth Avenue.   
13.6.20 
There is a cluster of slight accidents at the A465 / A4059 roundabout 
which would be expected at a junction of this type.

Preliminary Assessment of Impacts 
Transport Impacts 
13.7.2 
A preliminary assessment of the likely impacts for each of the elements 
of the Project is presented below. 
Power Generation Plant 
Construction / Demolition 
13.7.3 
There is likely to be an increase of traffic on the A465/ A4059/ A4061, 
Rhigos Road, A4061/ Fifth Avenue Roundabout and the Fifth Avenue 
and Main Avenue Roundabout as construction workers travel to and 
from the Project Site and HGV’s access the Project Site.  
13.7.4 
There will be up to 250 construction workers present at the Project Site 
at the peak in construction workforce. Assuming that an average of two 
construction workers travel in each car, this will result in a maximum of 
125 vehicle trips to and from the Project Site every day.

13.7.5 
However, this would be for a very short period (around 2-3 months) of 
the overall construction period and therefore a preliminary assessment 
is that any impacts are likely to be minor.  
13.7.6 
Abnormal loads are unlikely to cause any significant impacts on the 
road network as routes, delivery times and street furniture assessments 
will be planned to accommodate abnormal loads and this will be agreed 
with RCTCBC and SWTRA officers prior to undertaking. 
Operation 
13.7.7 
There will be minimal impacts during the operation as operational staff 
numbers will be low (of the order of 15 full time employees) and the 
delivery and removal of goods to the Project Site are also expected to 
be very low.  
Decommissioning 
13.7.8 
The decommissioning stage will be similar to the construction phase in 
that a number of construction staff will be required to decommission the 
Power Generation Plant. Therefore, there is likely to be an increase of 
traffic on the A465/ A4059/ A4061, Rhigos Road, A4061/ Fifth Avenue 
Roundabout and the Fifth Avenue and Main Avenue Roundabout as 
construction workers travel to and from the Project Site and HGV’s 
access the Project Site.  
Gas Connection route corridor option 1 
Construction 
13.7.9 
The number of construction workers required to construct the Gas 
Connection Route 1 will be low in relation to the Power Generation 
Plant. As such, there is likely to be limited impacts associated with 
additional trips on the network. There will be some additional traffic 
caused by the arrival and departure of construction workers and HGV’s 
delivering and removing goods from the corridor, however, this is 
anticipated to be low.  There will be temporary traffic management in 
place on Main Avenue and the Rhigos Road to reduce the impact of 
traffic and to ensure safety on site.     
Operation 
13.7.10 
Maintenance vehicles are expected to be very infrequent and are not 
anticipated to cause any detriment to the local transport network.

Decommissioning 
13.7.11 
The decommissioning stage will generate very few vehicle movements, 
as it is likely that the Gas Connection will be left in situ. Some elements 
of the AGI may be removed, although there are not anticipated to be 
any impacts on the traffic network.   
Gas Connection route corridor option 2 
Construction 
13.7.12 
The number of construction workers required to construct the Gas 
Connection Corridor Option 2 will be low in relation to the Power 
Generation Plant. As such, there is likely to be limited impacts 
associated with additional trips on the network. There will be some 
additional traffic caused by the arrival and departure of construction 
workers and HGV’s delivering and removing goods from the corridor, 
however, this is anticipated to be low. There will be temporary traffic 
management in place on Main Avenue and Fifth Avenue to reduce the 
impact of traffic and to ensure safety on site. The impacts of this are 
likely to be negligible.     
Operation 
13.7.13 
Maintenance vehicles are expected to be infrequent and are not 
anticipated to cause any detriment to the local transport network. 
Access to the Gas Connection route corridor option 2 will be via Main 
Avenue, Fifth Avenue and Rhigos Road.   
Decommissioning 
13.7.14 
The decommissioning stage will generate very few vehicle movements, 
as it is likely that the Gas Connection will be left in situ. Some elements 
of the AGI may be removed, although there are not anticipated to be 
any impacts on the traffic network.   
Electrical Connection route corridor option 1 
Construction 
13.7.15 
The number of construction workers required to construct  Electrical 
Connection Option 1 will be low in relation to the Power Generation 
Plant. As such, there is likely to be limited impacts associated with 
additional trips on the network. There will be some additional traffic 
caused by the arrival and departure of construction workers and HGV’s 
delivering and removing goods from the corridor. The impacted roads 
are A465/ A4059/A4061 Roundabout, Rhigos Road, A4061/ Fifth

Decommissioning 
13.7.17 
The decommissioning stage will be similar to the construction phase in 
that a number of construction staff will be required to decommission 
Electrical Connection Option 1. However, as with construction, the 
number of workers required to decommission the Connection will be 
low and as such, there is likely to be limited impacts associated with 
additional trips on the network. 
 Electrical Connection route corridor option 2 
Construction 
13.7.18 
The number of construction workers required to construct Electrical 
Connection route corridor option 2 will be low in relation to the Power 
Generation Plant. As such, there is likely to be limited impacts 
associated with additional trips on the network. There will be some 
additional traffic caused by the arrival and departure of construction 
workers and HGV’s delivering and removing goods from the corridor. 
The impacted roads are the A465/ A4059/A4061 Roundabout, Rhigos 
Road, A4061/ Fifth Avenue Roundabout and the Fifth Avenue and Main 
Avenue Roundabout. 
Operation 
13.7.19 
Maintenance vehicles are expected to be infrequent and are not 
anticipated to cause any detriment on the local transport network. 
Access to the Electrical Connection Compound will be via Main Avenue 
and Fourteenth Avenue. 
Decommissioning 
13.7.20 
The decommissioning stage will generate very few vehicle movements, 
as it is likely that Electrical Connection route corridor option 2 will be left

Once further work has been undertaken for the EIA, it will be possible 
to identify highway works, or provision for non-motorised users based 
on the findings of the assessment.

Next Steps 
13.10.1 
The lead objective of the traffic and transportation input to the EIA is to 
determine the impact of all phases of the Project on users of all modes 
of transport. This will make it possible to develop appropriate mitigation 
measures that will minimise adverse transportation impacts for those 
impacted. 
13.10.2 
To achieve this objective, the following assessments will be undertaken 
as part of the next stage of the assessment: 
� 
Identification of the scope and boundary of construction works, 
Project Site operations and Project decommissioning. This will 
include details on enabling highways works, staff arrangements, 
types of vehicles, and means of access. 
� 
Estimation of the number of trips generated during peak periods for 
each development phase. These will be derived from use of the 
TRICS database where appropriate, or will alternatively be based 
on staffing and construction/service vehicle requirements. 
� 
Assessment of traffic growth on the transport network in the study 
area. This would involve use of a gravity model to establish the 
origin and destination of Project traffic. It would be necessary to 
compare the 2013 base year with a future year do nothing scenario 
(without  the Project) and a future year do something scenario (with 
the Project). 
� 
Link Capacity Analysis of key corridors to the Project. This will 
identify the need for any road improvements. 
� 
A Non-Motorised User Assessment will provide a qualitative 
assessment of the impacts faced by non car users, i.e. an 
assessment of the Project impact on Pedestrian Amenity and 
Severance. 
� 
A review of accident data to identify any safety issues and offer 
mitigation, where appropriate. 
� 
A review of any other planned developments in the area that may 
co-coincide with the Project 
13.10.3 
A review of the access arrangements for Abnormal Loads and any 
temporary mitigation measures required to enable their travel to the 
Project Site

ARCHAEOLOGY AND CULTURAL HERITAGE 
14.1 
Introduction 
14.1.1 
The 
construction 
(including 
demolition), 
operation 
and 
decommissioning of the proposed Project have the potential to impact 
upon both surface and buried archaeological assets, as well as the 
setting and appreciation of assets of Cultural Heritage importance, 
including surrounding Listed Buildings, Scheduled Monuments and 
Conservation Areas. 
14.1.2 
At this PEIR stage of the assessment, an archaeological Desk Based 
Assessment (DBA) has been undertaken which investigates all 
historical records within 1km of the centre of the proposed Project Site 
(the study area)  
14.1.3 
This Section presents the findings of the DBA and provides a summary 
of the remaining work that is planned prior to completion of the ES. 
14.2 
Legislative and Policy Context 
National Policy Statements 
14.2.2 
As explained in Section 2, the NPS EN-1 explains the assessment 
principles to which the SoS will have regard in the examination of an 
energy NSIP (such as the proposed Project), and explains the generic 
historic environment impacts with regard to energy infrastructure. 
Specific considerations for fossil fuel generating stations are provided 
in the NPS for Fossil Fuel Generating Infrastructure (EN-2). The NPSs 
for Gas and Oil Pipelines (EN-4) and Electricity Networks Infrastructure 
(EN-5) provide specific considerations potentially relevant to the Gas 
Connection and Electrical Connection Compound and Electrical 
Connection respectively. 
14.2.3 
NPS EN-1 at section 5.8 sets out assessment principles relevant to 
energy NSIPs in relation to the historic environment. . 
14.2.4 
Paragraph 5.8.1 of the NPS states that the construction, operation and 
decommissioning of energy infrastructure has the potential to result in 
adverse impacts on the historic environment. The following paragraph 
(5.8.2) defines the historic environment as including all aspects of the 
environment resulting from the interaction between people and places 
through time, including all surviving physical remains of past human 
activity, whether visible, buried or submerged, landscaped and planted 
or managed flora. Those elements of the historic environment that hold 
value to this and future generations because of their historic,

archaeological, architectural or artistic interest are called heritage 
assets. The policy states that a heritage asset may be any building, 
monument, site, place, area or landscape, or any combination of these. 
The sum of the heritage interests that a heritage asset holds is referred 
to as its significance. 
14.2.5 
Paragraph 5.8.3 discusses statutory designated heritage assets and 
suggests such categories are: a World Heritage Site; Scheduled 
Monument; Protected Wreck Site; Protected Military Remains, Listed 
Building; Registered Park and Garden; Registered Battlefield; 
Conservation Area; and Registered Historic Landscape (Wales only). 
14.2.6 
Paragraph 5.8.4 goes on to highlight that there are heritage assets with 
archaeological interest that are not currently designated as scheduled 
monuments, but which are demonstrably of equivalent significance. 
These include those that have yet to be formally assessed for 
designation; those that have been assessed as being designatable but 
which the SoS has decided not to designate, and those that are 
incapable of being designated by virtue of being outside the scope of 
the Ancient Monuments and Archaeological Areas Act 1979. 
Furthermore, in Paragraph 5.8.5 the policy considers that the absence 
of designation for such heritage assets does not indicate lower 
significance. If the evidence before the SoS indicates to it that a non 
designated heritage asset of the type described in 5.8.4 may be 
affected by the proposed development then the heritage asset should 
be considered subject to the same policy considerations as those that 
apply to designated heritage assets. 
14.2.7 
In paragraph 5.8.6 the section concludes that the SoS should also 
consider the impacts on other non-designated heritage assets, as 
identified either through the development plan making process (local 
listing) or through the SoS decision making process on the basis of 
clear evidence that the assets have a heritage significance that merits 
consideration in its decisions, even though those assets are of lesser 
value than designated assets. 
14.2.8 
The policy considers (Paragraph 5.8.8) that as part of the applicant's 
assessment the applicant should provide a description of the 
significance of the heritage assets affected by the proposed 
development and the contribution of their setting to that significance. 
The level of detail should be proportionate to the importance of the 
heritage assets and no more than is sufficient to understand the 
potential impact of the proposal on the heritage asset. As a minimum 
the applicant should have consulted the relevant Historic Environment 
Record and assessed the heritage assets themselves using expertise 
where necessary according to the proposed development's impact.

14.2.9 
Paragraph 5.8.9 is concerned with heritage assets with an 
archaeological interest and states that the applicant should carry out 
appropriate desk-based assessment and, where such desk-based 
research is insufficient to properly assess the interest, a field 
evaluation.  
Other National and Local Policy 
14.2.10 
The Rhondda Cynon Taf Local Development Plan (2011) sets out  
“...the framework for decisions to be made  up until 2021 on how land is 
used in the County Borough, for example what type of development is 
appropriate or desirable and how best to protect our environment”. The 
Local Development Plan provides part of the Development Plan against 
which applications under the TCPA regime are to be determined, and 
parts may be relevant and important under the PA 2008 regime. One 
policy is relevant and is outlined below:  
“Policy AW8 – Protection and Enhancement of the Natural 
Environment: Development proposals which impact upon sites of 
architectural and/ or historical merit and sites of archaeological 
importance will only be permitted where it can be demonstrated that the 
proposal would preserve or enhance the character and appearance of 
the site.” 
14.2.11 
The Supplementary Planning Guidance (2011) provides more specific 
advice on all aspects of the ‘The Historic Built Environment’ including 
Conservation 
Areas, 
Listed 
Buildings, 
Scheduled 
Monuments, 
archaeology, historic parks and gardens and historic landscapes. For 
archaeology, the following applies: 
“Where an archaeological site is identified as present, consideration will 
be given to the extent, nature, condition and importance of any such 
site. Sufficient information should be made available to determine the 
impact of the proposed development on the archaeological resource. 
Where appropriate, conditions will placed on planning permissions to 
ensure the archaeological resource is appropriately surveyed, 
preserved and recorded. Mitigation measures should also be put in 
place where appropriate.” 
14.2.12 
The Study Area also covers part of the Brecon Beacons National Park, 
which has specific policies relating to the historic environment. This 
includes the Brecon Beacons National Park Authority Local Plan, which 
was adopted in 1999. It contains three policies relating to archaeology: 
“Policy CL8: Development proposals which would have an adverse 
effect on the remains or the settings of nationally important sites of 
 
 
 
 
Hirwaun Power Project Preliminary

- 372 - 
 
archaeological interest and of Scheduled Ancient Monuments will not 
be permitted.” 
“Policy CL9: Development proposals which would have an adverse 
effect on historic landscapes, sites and features of archaeological 
interest or of local cultural importance and their settings will only be 
permitted where:  
� 
the effect is minimal;  
� 
archaeological remains can be protected in situ by appropriate 
design and siting; or  
� 
the benefits of the proposals outweigh any adverse effects.” 
“Policy CL10: Where important archaeological remains are known to 
exist or may exist within an area for archaeological evaluation, the 
Authority will require the archaeological implications of development 
proposals to be evaluated before planning applications are determined. 
Planning permission will not be granted where the Authority deems 
such evaluation to be inadequate.” 
14.2.13 
Deposit Local Development Plan (2010). As this plan follows the 
policies in PPW for listed buildings, scheduled monuments, world 
heritage sites, conservation areas and historic parks and gardens, the 
only different policy is as follows: 
“Policy 49 Areas of Archaeological Evaluation: Where important 
archaeological remains are known to exist or may exist within an area 
for archaeological evaluation, the archaeological implications of 
development proposals shall be evaluated before planning applications 
are determined. Planning permission will not be granted where the 
evaluation is deemed inadequate.” 
Approach 
Standards and Guidance 
14.2.14 
The Hirwaun Power Project Scoping Report (Parsons Brinckerhoff 
2013) proposed the undertaking of a Desk-based Assessment (DBA), 
and consequently this document has been written in accordance with 
the relevant professional guidelines - Institute for Archaeologists (IfA) 
and English Heritage (IfA 2012a Standard and Guidance for 
Archaeological Desk-based Assessments; IfA 2012b Code of Conduct; 
English Heritage 2006 Management of Research Projects in the 
Historic Environment (MoRPHE)).

Study Area 
14.2.15 
This DBA has focused on the Project Site, although historic information 
for the immediate surrounding area (hereafter known as the Study 
Area) has been considered in order to provide an essential contextual 
background. In accordance with the Scoping Study and in consultation 
with the Glamorgan and Gwent Archaeological Trust, this extends for 
approximately 1km from the outer limits of the Project Site.  
Terminology  
14.2.16 
The technical terminology applied to the assessment process in this 
document is based on that contained within the Cultural Heritage 
Section (Volume 11, Section 3, Part 2) of the Design Manual for Road 
and Bridges (DMRB) issued by the Highways Agency in 2007. This has 
been widely adopted throughout the heritage industry as a baseline. 
However, the terminology has been enhanced as appropriate 
throughout this report. 
14.2.17 
Cultural heritage comprises scheduled monuments, listed buildings, 
parks and gardens, battlefields, conservation areas, earthworks and 
buried archaeological remains. For the ease of presentation in this 
document cultural heritage features are referred to as Heritage Assets, 
and additionally for the purposes of clarity a minor distinction is made 
between standing remains and buried archaeology. 
Aims 
14.2.18 
The DBA will study the historic environment within the agreed study 
area. It will consist of an analysis of data in order to identify the likely 
Heritage Assets, their significance, character of the study area and 
consideration of the setting of the Heritage Assets, and the nature, 
extent and quality of the known or potential archaeological, historic, 
architectural and aesthetic interest. Significance is to be judged in a 
local, regional, national or international context as appropriate (IfA 
2012a). 
Objectives 
14.2.19 
The specific objectives of this DBA are to: 
� 
Assess the potential for Heritage Assets to survive within the 
Project Site; 
� 
Assess the importance  of the known or potential Heritage Assets;

� 
Identify the potential impact of proposed or predicted changes on 
the significance of the assets and their settings; 
� 
Provide strategies for further evaluation where the nature, extent or 
significance of the resource is not sufficiently well defined; 
� 
Assess the potential cumulative impacts of this development with 
other reasonably foreseeable planned developments.  
� 
Suggest strategies to conserve the significance of the Assets and 
their settings, and; 
� 
Present proposals for archaeological mitigation. 
14.3 
Realistic Worst Case Scenario for Assessment 
14.3.1 
In respect of archaeology and cultural heritage, the realistic worst case 
scenario from within the Project parameters (which are described in 
Section 4 of the PEIR) are set out in Table 14.1 below. 
Table 14.1 - Worst case parameters for the proposed Project 
considered within this assessment 
Parameters 
Details 
Power Generation Plant 
Number of gas turbine units 
5 (~ 59 MWe) 
Number of stacks 
5 
Height of Stacks 
35m 
Unit type 
Aero derivative 
14.3.2 
The reason why this configuration has been chosen is that it represents 
the maximum number of stacks possible (e.g. 5) at their greatest height 
(35m).  This is therefore considered to represent the greatest potential 
visual impact on the setting of cultural heritage assets.  The various 
scenarios have little difference in terms of ground take or impacts on

14.4.1 
The principal sources of information consulted were historical and 
modern maps, although published and unpublished secondary sources 
were also reviewed. The following repositories were consulted during 
the data-gathering process:  
� 
Glamorgan and Gwent Historic Environment Record (HER); 
� 
Royal Commission on Ancient and Historical Monuments Wales 
(coflein); 
� 
Aberdare Local Studies Library for a literature review of publicly 
available data including reports on any cultural heritage or 
archaeological work conducted in or near the study area; and 
� 
Historical maps including Ordnance Survey. 
Site Visit  
14.4.2 
The Project Site was visited in order to assess its character, identify 
visible historic features and assess possible factors which may affect 
the survival or condition of known or potential assets. A photographic 
record was compiled as a part of the site visit and shown in Plates 
14.5-14.12. 
14.4.3 
All of the Heritage Assets identified through the data collection and the 
site visit are described in detail in the gazetteer (Appendix B). Their 
location is shown on Figure 14.1. 
Setting of the Assets  
14.4.4 
The Project Site and its 1km Study Area were visited in order to allow a 
preliminary assessment of the potential for indirect impacts on the 
setting of the Heritage Assets. At this stage a drive through of the 
relevant landscape was undertaken, and an outline photographic 
archive compiled. The general topography was noted, as was the 
presence of any large areas of plantation, and building complexes such 
as housing estates, industrial plant, and so forth. However, due to the 
preliminary nature of this assessment a worst-case scenario is 
presented. This outline assessment has highlighted the need for further 
more detailed assessment of setting at a later stage as appropriate. 
14.4.5 
Initially, the significance of the Heritage Assets is judged in a 
neighbourhood, local, regional, national and international context, 
which results in the cultural value or sensitivity of the asset being 
determined along with the appropriate form of mitigation (Table 14.2 
below). Once the value is established then the archaeological, historic, 
architectural and aesthetic interests are discussed.

Such sites are likely isolated 
findspots, place names or 
cropmarks identified on aerial 
photographs.   
14.4.6 
Table 14.2 is a general guide to the attributes of Cultural Heritage 
Assets and it should be noted that not all the qualities listed need be 
present in every case and professional judgement is used in balancing 
the different criteria.  
14.4.7 
In order to consider the archaeological and historic significance in 
particular, an additional set of criteria are employed which relate to the 
SoS criteria for assessing the national importance of monuments, as 
contained in Annex 1 of the policy statement on scheduled monuments 
produced by the Department of Culture, Media, and Sport (2010). 
These criteria relate to period, rarity, documentation, group value, 
survival/condition, fragility/vulnerability, diversity, and potential and are 
presented in Section 14.6. The consideration of the significance of 
statutory designated assets including listed buildings is reflected in their 
Grade, and so it is not necessary to apply the criteria mentioned to this 
type of Heritage Asset. 
14.4.8 
In order to assess the potential impact of any future development on 
built heritage or buried archaeological remains, consideration has been 
afforded to: 
� 
Assessing in detail any impact and the significance of the effects 
arising from any future development of the Project Site; 
� 
Reviewing the evidence for past impacts that may have affected 
the archaeological sites of interest identified during the desk-based 
assessment; 
� 
Outlining suitable mitigation measures, where possible at this 
stage, to avoid, reduce, or remedy adverse impacts. 
14.4.9 
Key impacts have been identified as those that would potentially lead to 
a change to the Heritage Asset. Each potential impact has been 
determined as the predicted deviation from the baseline conditions, in 
accordance with current knowledge of the Project Site. The impact is 
assessed in terms of the sensitivity or value of the asset to the 
magnitude of change or potential scale of impact during the Project. 
The magnitude, or scale of an impact is often difficult to define, but will 
be termed as substantial, moderate, slight, or negligible, as shown in 
Table 14.3, below.

Prehistoric Period (30,000 BC – AD 43): Early human activity in South 
Wales is attested with the discovery of an Upper Palaeolithic burial in a 
cave at Paviland in the Gower Peninsula approximately 40km to the 
south-west of the Study Area (Walker 2011). Mesolithic flint tools have 
been found at two sites in Penderyn parish approximately 1km to the 
north of the Study Area. Together with pollen sample evidence, it 
suggests that the sites were seasonally occupied by hunter-gatherers

traversing the landscape in search of resources (Selwood 2000: 12). 
Numerous Mesolithic flint implements and manufacture waste have 
been found in the surrounding area of the Study Area including a 
possible temporary settlement approximately 1km to the south 
(PRN04591m). Further Microlithic findspots have been identified to the 
south and south-west of the Study Area (e.g. PRN00925w, 
PRN01686w, PRN01787m). 
14.6.3 
Within Glamorganshire, the Neolithic is typified by chambered tombs 
and long barrows, which have mainly been identified during upland 
surveys (Evans and Lewis 2003: 6). Several findspots of Neolithic flints 
have been recovered, particularly to the south of the Study Area (e.g. 
PRN01652m, PRN01649m, PRN01769m). A Neolithic hut settlement 
was excavated at Cefn Glas in 1973 (PRN01764), which is located 
approximately 2km to the south of the Study Area.  
14.6.4 
During the Bronze Age, Glamorganshire was characterised by cairns in 
the uplands and barrows in the lowlands (Evans and Lewis 2003: 8). 
Bronze Age earthworks, cairns and barrows have been recorded 
approximately 1km to the north-west of the Study Area (e.g. 
PRN04523m, PRN00010m, PRN00003m, PRN04524m) and also 
2.5km to the south-west at PRN00713w and PRN04125m.  
14.6.5 
Whilst no Heritage Assets dating to the Iron Age have been identified 
within the Study Area, there is evidence for Iron Age activity in the 
wider area. Hillforts were typical Iron Age defensive structures located 
on high ground. An Iron Age hillfort (PRN01107m) has been identified 
within the vicinity of the Study Area at Craig y Ddinas, approximately 
1.5km to the north-west. It has been suggested that it was only 
occupied temporarily during times of stress (Selwood 2000: 13). An 
Iron Age coin attributed to the Durotriges (PRN01687w) was recorded 
approximately 2.5km to the south-west of the Study Area. Evidence for 
Iron Age settlement has been recorded 1km to the south of the Study 
Area, where enclosures have been identified (PRN00022m). In 
addition, Iron Age settlement evidence is known further south at 
PRN00019m, PRN00020m and PRN 00021m, which contained hut 
circles. Whilst this settlement site was originally thought to be Iron Age 
and was scheduled as such, CADW now suggest that it may be post-
medieval in date. 
14.6.6 
Romano-British Period (AD43 - AD410): A Roman fort was uncovered 
at Neath, which is approximately 15km south-west of Hirwaun. A 
Roman Road runs from Neath to the fort at Brecon (Selwood 2000: 13), 
approximately 3km to the west of the Study Area. No Heritage Assets 
dating to the Romano-British period have been identified within the 
Study Area.

14.6.7 
Early Medieval Period (AD 410 – AD 1066): During the eighth century, 
Hirwaun was part of a territory known as Morgannwg (land of Morgan), 
which lay between the Rivers Usk and Tawe and was ruled by Morgan 
ab Athrwys, (Selwood 1977). In the ninth and tenth centuries, this 
kingdom was besieged by the Kings of Gwynedd, Dyfed and Mercia, 
along with periodic attacks from the Vikings. By the eleventh century, 
Cadwgan ap Meurig, the then King of Morgannwg, conceded defeat 
against Gruffydd ap Llewelyn, the King of Gwynedd and Dyfed. 
Gruffydd was later killed in 1063 by King Harold of England. Further 
conflict emerged with the Normans, who built castles at Chepstow and 
Monmouth and conquered most of Gwent. Hirwaun later came under 
the control of Gwrgant ab Ithel, who was reputed to have left an area of 
moorland four miles in length and two miles in width to the common 
people for the free grazing of animals. This land was later known as 
Hirwaun Common. A battle between Iestyn ap Gwrgant (son of 
Gwrgant ab Ithel) and Rhys ap Tewdwr is said to have taken place on 
Hirwaun Common and this is supported by OS mapping (1921) in 
which a site of a battle is annotated (See Plate 2, below). However, 
there is no evidence to support this and it is believed that it was a later 
invention (Selwood 1977: 16-17). 
14.6.8 
An early medieval inscribed stone was found just outside the south-
eastern edge of the Study Area (PRN01275m), which may date to the 
late 
fifth 
century 
based 
on 
epigraphic 
evidence. 
A 
dyke 
(PRN02262.0m) has been identified approximately 1.5km to the south 
of the Study Area. This has been attributed to the Anglo-Saxon period, 
although its precise origins are unknown. It runs from Hirwaun 
Common cliff southwards along the boundary between Rhigos and 
Aberdare parishes. It may have functioned as a boundary marker.  
14.6.9 
Late Medieval Period (AD 1066 – AD 1540): In 1537, John Leland, an 
English antiquarian, travelled to Hirwaun and noted the horses on the 
Common, which were a famous special breed of ponies used until the 
nineteenth century. Leland also mentions there was ‘good corn’ in 
Rhigos indicating that the land was used for arable farming as well as 
for rough pasture (Selwood 1977: 25). Documentary evidence from the 
parish of Penderyn indicates that the inhabitants practised a mixed 
form of agriculture and their main income was livestock, especially 
cattle (Selwood 2000: 37). 
14.6.10 
Post-Medieval Period (AD 1540 – c1750): During the reign of Elizabeth 
I, the Earl of Pembroke was the landowner of much of Glamorgan 
(Selwood 1977: 25). After the death of the seventh Earl his daughter, 
Charlotte inherited the land. In 1703, she married Thomas the first 
Viscount of Windsor and Hirwaun Common became part of the Windsor 
estate (Selwood 1977: 48). Documentary evidence from the sixteenth 
and seventeenth centuries records the presence of several mills

bordering Hirwaun Common, two of which were in Rhigos. These 
comprised textile and corn mills (Selwood 1977: 38). 
14.6.11 
Industrial Period (c1750 – 1901): During the latter half of the eighteenth 
century, the lands at Hirwaun passed from the Windsor estate to the 
Earl of Bute (Selwood 1977: 48). There was increased pressure for 
land due to an increase in population leading to the encroachments of 
common land (Selwood 1977: 42), such as Hirwaun Common. Whilst 
Hirwaun Common had been used for agricultural purposes, the middle 
of the eighteenth century witnessed the discovery of mineral wealth.  
14.6.12 
Such is the importance of iron and coal to the history and development 
of the Cynon Valley and Hirwaun, and which still has an impact on 
modern period industry, that some detail of the Hirwaun Iron Works and 
the coal industry is presented below. Hirwaun Iron Works is a 
Scheduled Monument and lies within 1km of the Study Area. 
14.6.13 
Lloyd in his account of the South Wales Iron Works (1906) states that 
as early as 1720 iron ore was being transported by packhorse from 
Hirwaun to a small furnace in Brecon. The Brecon furnace was 
acquired by Thomas Maybery in 1753 and eventually passed to his son 
John Maybery. 
14.6.14 
It took John Maybery, an enterprising ironmaster, just a few short years 
to appreciate the potential wealth of Hirwaun, which was rich in iron 
ore, coal and limestone. In 1757 he leased the mineral rights from the 
landowner - the Lord Windsor. The lease indenture dated 22nd 
November 1757 provides an interesting insight into the infrastructure 
associated with mineral extraction "...to dig for, search, raise and land 
all mines of iron ore or coal that could or might be found in or upon a 
certain common, Tyr Wain Wrgan...with liberty of making ditches, 
gutters, levels, drains, dams and ponds for sourcing and raising the 
same...." (Lloyd 1906, 12). The indenture also offers a brief view of 
local life "....the tenants of the said Lord Windsor of a certain hamlet 
called Rhigos....granted to dig for and raise coal and carry away the 
same...and upon the common of Hirwain Wrgan for burning and making 
of lime to manure the lord's lands...". Further details within the 
indenture hint at the potential mineral wealth that had attracted John 
Maybery to the common "...and to dispose of 200 dozen horseloads of 
iron ore per year in any way thought proper...". This was in addition to 
that worked at the furnace and was presumably sent to Brecon. 
14.6.15 
Although the mineral rights were agreed with Lord Windsor, Maybery is 
recorded as having purchased land in the parish of Penderyn for the 
purposes of constructing a furnace from a different source (ibid). 
However, slightly later in 1760 the lease agreement is amended; John 
Maybery renegotiated the terms of his lease with the Dowager Lady

Windsor to include various relatives and, in particular, his brother-in-law 
John Wilkins. In accordance with this revised lease the freehold land is 
handed over to the Windsor family. The lease also provides an early 
account of the proposed layout of the iron works "...furnace and works, 
mine yard...with free liberty to set up, erect and build so many furnaces, 
blast furnaces, forges, mills, engines, store-houses, coal-houses, 
yards, courts...for the placing and keeping of ore, coal, coke and 
charcoal...and the melting and manufacturing...and at all times to bore, 
dig, search, work for, raise and land all such coal, culme, kennell, slack, 
iron mine and iron ore, turf or peat as might be found..." 
14.6.16 
The iron works rapidly developed and proved profitable to such an 
extent that in 1764 Maybery and Wilkins extended their operations to 
Tredegar. Unfortunately ten years later, issues in America greatly 
affected the iron business and in 1775 they parted with Tredegar. The 
Hirwaun works were leased for a fixed period to John Wasse and 
Willliam King, the latter a Bristol glass maker (Lloyd 1906, 14). The 
terms of the lease agreed to "...fix the water wheel and finish the new 
road to the Bryngwyn coal works..." This is the beginning of a thirty year 
period of new leases and iron masters. The most notable of these was 
Anthony Bacon (1780), a Cyfarthfa ironmaster, whose sons are 
documented as having disposed of the iron works at Cyfarthfa to 
Richard Crawshay. Jeremiah Homfray and a number of associates took 
over the works in 1803 and worked it until they became bankrupt in 
1814, at which time the iron works was dismantled. 
14.6.17 
Hirwaun was given a new lease of life in 1817 when William Crawshay 
(II) of Cyfartha purchased the works. In 1820 four new blast furnaces 
were erected and a range of calcining furnaces was built. Following the 
decline of the iron industry in the late nineteenth century, and after a 
period of being worked as a forge and foundry, the works closed in 
1900 (LLoyd 1906, 15). 
14.6.18 
At a time when the iron industry was in decline the Cynon Valley 
prospered from the growth of the coal industry, which by the middle of 
the nineteenth century had spread down the valley following new and 
deeper pits. The valley lies within the South Wales coalfield which is an 
elongated geological basin formed of carboniferous rocks and extends 
90 miles from St Brides Bay in the west (Pembrokeshire) to Pontypool 
in the east (Monmouthshire). The following account of the coal mining 
industry in the valley leans heavily on Cynon Coal History of a Mining 
Valley (Cynon Valley Historical Society, 2009). Tower Colliery is a 
Grade II Listed Building that lies to the south of the Study Area. 
14.6.19 
The above account suggests that the early coal industry was limited to 
levels driven into the hillsides in the north of the valley followed by 
small and relatively shallow pits. Where local conditions allowed larger

drift mines were opened. The southwards dip of the coal seams being 
greater than the fall of the valley floor required deeper pits, and so the 
lower part of the valley had to wait upon developments in the 
technology of winding, pumping and ventilation (CVHS 2009, 13). 
14.6.20 
By the seventeenth century local landowners were aware that the coal 
lying under their lands was an asset and references to leases of this 
period exist. In 1631 reference is made to the "liberty to dig cole 
therein" at Tir Wayne Wrgan (Hirwaun Common) and in 1612 a small 
pit was opened at Rhiogos (op cit, 16). 
14.6.21 
The first important stimulus to the coal industry was the emergence of 
the local iron industry, and the discovery that coal could be used to 
smelt iron if it was first converted to coke (Abraham Darby 1709). 
However, the first coke-fired blast furnace did not arrive in Wales until c 
1760 and at Hirwaun Ironworks. Coal was also used in the puddling 
furnaces and to fuel the blast engines. Other minor and more local uses 
during this period included malting and domestic use (op cit, 17). The 
remoteness of north Glamorgan and the absence of good roads made 
marketing difficult, and entailed the costly use of packhorses (ibid). 
Transportation improved when the first canals and their associated 
tramroads were built around the end of the eighteenth century. This led 
to a demand for better roads and Turnpike Trusts were set up, such as 
the Merthyr Turnpike Trust, which constructed the road between 
Merthyr and Glyn Neath crossing Hirwaun Common in 1800 (Selwood 
1977: 91). The route of this road was altered in 1840, which ran along 
the western edge of Hirwaun Common. 
14.6.22 
A further major development to the industry was the famous four feet 
seam which was reached in the mid-nineteenth century. This particular 
coal was of such high quality that it was superior to that of Newcastle. 
This met an increasing demand for coal from the merchant steam 
vessels. It was during this period that the great expansion of coal 
mining in the Cynon Valley began. By 1840 four pits had been sunk; in 
1843 three further pits followed; one more in 1844, two in the 
subsequent year, and two the year after that. By 1860 there were an 
additional 17 pits (CVHS 2009, 27). 
14.6.23 
The Cynon Valley collieries began to transport coal by tramroads to the 
Aberdare canal which had opened in 1812. However the depression in 
the iron industry of 1814 saw the closure of this vital transport link. 
Fortunately, following his purchase and renovation of the Hirwaun 
Ironworks William Crawshay took a controlling interest in the canal 
which thereafter continued to play a large part in the transportation of 
coal (op cit, 28). By 1841 Merthyr and Cardiff had been connected by 
the Taff Vale Railway at Abercynon. Although the advent of the railway 
meant the eventual ruin of the canal, the increased demand for coal

provided enough business for both the railway and the canal (op cit, 
29). 
14.6.24 
The late 1900s and early twentieth century was a turbulent time in the 
coal industry with strikes taking their toll. However, the South Wales 
steam coal was still much sought after and this was further boosted by 
the First World War, although demand for coal production resulted in a 
shortage of mining equipment and the working out of pits. The period 
following the war was also one of prosperity, but this was short-lived 
and the number of men employed by the industry fell from 20,000 to 
10,000 by 1937 (op cit, 173). The demand grew again with the on-set of 
WWII but the available man power fell as young miners joined the 
armed forces or worked in alternative industries such as the Hirwaun 
Royal Ordnance Factory (HA06) thus creating a shortage of labour and 
the subsequent establishment of the Bevin Boys (op cit, 179).  
14.6.25 
The fall of France took away 70% of the UK’s coal market, and further 
loss of men to the industry resulted in an acute shortage of coal. In 
1940 industrial scale opencast coal mining was introduced into the UK 
by the Department of Board and Trade. One of the earliest opencast 
sites opened under the provisions of the Defence of the Realm Act 
1939 was Ffyndaf on the northern edge of Hirwaun Common. At the 
beginning of the 1970s further sites were opened including Rhigos. 
Ffyndaf was revisited and came to within 200 yards of Tower Colliery 
(1km to the south of the Study Area). Despite the widespread decline of 
deep mining and almost total closure by the 1990s, cast mining 
continues in the valley on Hirwaun Common (op cit, 181). 
14.6.26 
Modern (post-1901): Hirwaun Industrial Estate was established during 
WWII for the construction of Royal Ordnance Factory No. 26 (HA06). It 
was built between May 1941 and February 1942 and specialised in 
small arms ammunition manufacture. It covered an area 1.7km east to 
west by 1km. In 1945 the Board of Trade took over the site for use as 
an industrial estate and it is still used as such today. The site has been 
extensively rebuilt and there is little evidence of wartime use apart from 
the general road layout, some minor buildings and derelict sections of 
concrete roadway; nearby at Hirwaun Ponds railway halt, air-raid 
shelters provided for factory workers still stand. 
14.6.27 
In the 1960s, GEC Marconi established a TV factory at Hirwaun; in c 
1974 a joint venture was entered into by GEC with Hitachi and in 1984 
Hitachi took over the factory entirely. Hitachi expanded the plant with 
the ‘Advance Factory’ constructed in 1988 however by 2001 the 
decision had been taken to close the plant. In 2002 International 
Greetings Plc acquired the freehold interest in the entire facility and has 
operated a storage and distribution facility for its paper gift wrap 
product since that date.

Previous Archaeological Investigations  
14.6.28 
An archaeological watching brief was undertaken at Hirwaun Industrial 
Estate in 2011, although no archaeological features, deposits or finds 
were identified (Dunning 2011). An Environmental Impact Assessment 
was carried out in 2008 at Enviroparks Hirwaun, which includes 
Hirwaun Industrial Estate (Enviroparks Ltd 2008). Several field visits 
have also been undertaken to specific sites, including Caer-llwyn 
cottage (HA04) in 1979 and Tappenden’s tramroad east and west 
(HA08) in 2005. This latter visit revealed that only 20% of the entire 
tramroad survives with some original features still in situ (Roberts and 
Jones 2006). 
Historical Development of the Scheme Area  
14.6.29 
The earliest 1:2,500 Ordnance Survey (OS) map (1899) and the 
subsequent 1900 edition (Insert 14.1) depict agricultural land, which 
was part of Hirwaun Common. A ‘Site of Battle’ is annotated here, 
which may have been the location for an eleventh century battle. The 
maps show several buildings just to the north of Rhigos Road, which 
are labelled as ‘Twyn Bryn-hir’. Also outlined are the routes of several 
old tramways (HA08) and an old gravel pit. A ‘tumuli’ (HA07) is also 
noted in the north-east corner of the maps.

By the publication of the 1962-1964 1:2,500 OS map (Insert 14.3), the 
Royal Ordnance Factory has become Hirwaun Industrial Estate 
(HA06), although a number of the Royal Ordnance Factory buildings 
are extant. The tramways (HA08) are now labelled as dismantled as 
new infrastructure has been built. Twyn Bryn-hir is shown as one 
structure and woodland has been planted surrounding it, apart from the 
south, where it is bounded by Rhigos Road.

the factory from the previous map. For example, the main factory 
building on Main Avenue has been expanded to the west and a building 
has been demolished to the east of this building. Instead, a further five 
main factory structures have been built between the main factory 
building and Fourth Avenue, along with several smaller buildings. This 
expansion was carried out by Hitachi in 1988 with further structures 
added and others demolished. It is similar in plan to the modern OS 
mapping (2013), although there have been changes to the buildings to 
the immediate east of the proposed Power Generation Plant more 
recently. The structure at Twyn Bryn-hir is still extant on this map, along 
with its surrounding woodland, which survives today. Other Heritage 
Assets can still be seen, such as Hughes’s Patch (HA03), Caer-llwyn 
cottage (HA04), Bryn-y-gaer farmstead, which has ‘ruins’ annotated 
next  to  it  (HA11), Hirwaun Ponds (HA12), and the mineral railway 
(HA13).

Historic Landscape Characterisation  
14.6.35 
Historic landscape characterisation has been undertaken and the Study 
Area covers several regions, including Cefn Cadlan, Cwm Cadlan, 
Dyffryn Hepste, Rhondda Uplands and Rhondda Fawr, as detailed 
below:  
� 
Cefn Cadlan includes extensive moorland with important traces of 
prehistoric settlement, land use and burial together with a 
scattering of post-medieval and recent sheepfolds and small 
disused 
quarries 
and 
associated 
limekilns 
(http://www.cpat.org.uk/projects/longer/histland/fforest/1202.htm).  
� 
Cwn Cadlan comprises an upland valley with a diffuse and 
dispersed pattern of farms and abandoned farms and generally 
small irregular fields of medieval and earlier origin together with 
some larger areas of enclosed grazing on the moorland edge, 
along with field boundaries formed by drystone walls and hedges 
(http://www.cpat.org.uk/projects/longer/histland/fforest/1199.htm).  
� 
Dyffryn Hepste is also an upland valley with a coherent and well-
preserved pattern of dispersed farms and generally small irregular 
fields of medieval and earlier origin with boundaries formed by 
drystone walls and hedges, together with some larger areas of 
enclosed 
grazing 
on 
the 
moorland 
edge 
(http://www.cpat.org.uk/projects/longer/histland/fforest/1201.htm).  
� 
The Rhondda Uplands contains a mountain sheepwalk, partially 
forested, multi-period and multi-functional landscape. This includes 
prehistoric 
settlement 
and 
a 
funerary 
landscape, 
early 
communication corridor, Roman and medieval military structures, 
early 
medieval administrative 
boundaries, medieval 
upland 
settlement, post-medieval industrial landscape, relict upland 
agricultural landscape, documentary and place name evidence 
(http://www.ggat.org.uk/cadw/historic_landscape/Rhondda/English/
Rhondda_030.htm).  
� 
The Rhondda Fawr has enclosed valley sides comprising a largely 
relict medieval/post-medieval agricultural landscape, distinctive 
field boundaries, prehistoric funerary landscape and settlement, 
upland 
medieval 
agriculture 
and 
settlement, 
post-medieval 
agriculture and farmsteads (predominantly longhouse regional 
types), documentary evidence for both medieval/post-medieval 
agricultural practice and settlement, extensive industrial landscape 
with features dating from the early phases of mineral extraction 
(http://www.ggat.org.uk/cadw/historic_landscape/rhondda/english/R

Importance of the Heritage Assets 
14.6.37 
The assessment has identified a total of 16 heritage assets within the 
1km Study Area. Three Heritage Assets have been recorded within the 
Project Site (HA06, HA08 and HA09), although only one (HA06) lies 
within the proposed Power Generation Plant. Table 14.7, below, 
highlights the cultural value of the Heritage Assets.

Where assets do not possess a statutory designation, their significance 
has been determined with reference to the SoS criteria for assessing 
the national importance of monuments, as contained in Annex 1 of the

policy statement on scheduled monuments (DCMS, 2010). These 
criteria 
relate 
to 
period, 
rarity, 
documentation, 
group 
value, 
survival/condition, fragility/vulnerability, diversity, and potential. The 
definition of these criteria is presented in Table 14.8, below. 
Table 14.8: Definition of Criteria used to determine Archaeological 
Importance 
Criteria 
Definition 
Period 
Heritage Assets that characterise a category of 
asset or period. 
Rarity 
This should take account of all aspects of the 
distribution of a particular class of Heritage 
Asset, both in a national and a regional 
context.  
Documentary 
Evidence 
The significance of a Heritage Asset may be 
enhanced by the existence of records of 
previous investigation or, in the case of more 
recent assets, by the supporting evidence of 
contemporary written records 
Group Value 
The value of a single Heritage Asset (such as 
a field system) may be greatly enhanced by its 
association with related contemporary assets 
(such as a settlement and cemetery) or with 
assets of different periods. 
Survival/Condition 
The survival of an asset’s archaeological 
potential both above and below ground is a 
particularly important consideration and should 
be assessed in relation to its present condition 
and surviving features.  
Fragility/Vulnerability Highly important archaeological evidence from 
some field monuments can be destroyed by a 
single ploughing or unsympathetic treatment; 
there are also existing standing structures of 
particular form or complexity whose value can 
again be severely reduced by neglect or 
careless treatment. 
Diversity 
Some Heritage Assets may possess a 
combination of high quality features, others a 
single important attribute. 
Potential 
On occasion, the nature of the evidence 
cannot be specified precisely but it may still be

possible to document reasons anticipating its 
existence and importance. This is usually 
confined to buried remains rather than 
upstanding Heritage Assets. 
14.6.39 
Similarly, where Heritage Assets do not have statutory designation their 
historical and aesthetic importance is determined though the use of the 
criteria defined below (Table 14.9). The aesthetic criteria do not relate 
to buried archaeological remains as these are not visible above ground. 
The criteria are generally applied to non-designated buildings and 
structures, and to places (which are not considered here). 
Table 14.9: Definition of Historical and Aesthetic Importance 
Criteria 
Definition 
Historical 
This originates from the ways in which past 
people, events and aspects of life can be 
connected through a place to the present. This 
may include illustrative value, such as its 
connection to an important development, such as 
technology, or associative value, such as the 
connection to an important event or person. 
Aesthetic 
This is derived from the ways in which people 
draw sensory and intellectual stimulation from a 
place or building. These may be related to the 
design of a place, for example, through defensive 
reasons, or the informal development over time, 
such as the relationship of structures to their 
setting. 
14.6.40 
The consideration of the importance of listed buildings is reflected in 
their Grade and so it is not necessary to apply the criteria shown above 
to this type of Heritage Asset. Grade I listed buildings are those which 
are considered to be of exceptional national architectural or historic 
importance. Grade II* listed buildings are of particular national 
importance and special interest. Both Grade I and II* listed buildings 
are of great importance to the nation’s built heritage and their 
importance will generally be beyond dispute. Grade II listed buildings 
are usually designated for their architectural and historic interest. They 
are usually of a more local or regional significance and make up around 
95 per cent of all listed buildings.   
Statement of Importance 
14.6.41 
The Heritage Assets within the 1km Study Area (HA01, HA03-HA09, 
HA11-HA16) have been considered using the criteria, with the results

below. Whilst those Heritage Assets located outside the Project Site will 
not be directly impacted upon, the proposed Project has the potential to 
impact on these assets in a visual manner. Two Heritage Assets have 
not been assessed: the findspot of a Bronze Age spearhead (HA02) is 
not assessed as it is no longer in situ and cannot be impacted upon by 
any development. The Listed Building (HA10) does not need to be 
considered here as it is already a designated asset. 
14.6.42 
Period: The majority of the Heritage Assets identified within the Study 
Area are typical Post-medieval industrial features of South Wales, such 
as the colliery (HA03), railway (HA13) and bridges (HA01, HA14). The 
Bronze Age cairnfields (HA05 and HA07) are also characteristic of 
Bronze Age burial patterns in South Wales. 
14.6.43 
Rarity: None of the Heritage Assets are considered to be rare. 
14.6.44 
Documentary Evidence: The iron works, collieries and associated 
features, such as railways and tramroads in South Wales have been 
well-documented in the literature and through cartographic sources. 
Published research also exists for the Bronze Age landscape of this 
area. Other details could be discerned through further documentary 
research, but it is likely that this would not alter the results set out in 
this report. 
14.6.45 
Group value: The Post-medieval Heritage Assets (HA01, HA03, HA04, 
HA08-HA09, HA11-HA16) are linked through their date and the 
majority of them are associated with industry, apart from HA04 and 
HA11, which comprise a house and a farmstead. Heritage Assets 05 
and 07 are linked as they are both Bronze Age burial sites. 
14.6.46 
Survival/Condition: The early period assets (HA05 and HA07) have 
been disturbed and are fragile in nature. The later assets are much 
more stable in nature and survive in relatively good condition, such as 
the extant buildings at the Royal Ordnance Factory site (HA06) and 
industrial sites, such as the bridges (HA01, HA14), the colliery (HA03) 
the tramroad (HA08), the ponds (HA12) and water pump (HA16). A 
number of industrial buildings are also still extant including HA04, 
HA09 and HA15. 
14.6.47 
Fragility/Vulnerability: The buildings related to the Royal Ordnance 
munitions factory (HA06) are vulnerable to any development and the 
toll house (HA09).  
14.6.48 
Diversity: The post-medieval/industrial period features are diverse in 
that they include collieries and iron works and associated features, 
along with infrastructure, such as roads, bridges, railways and 
tramways (HA01-HA03, HA08, HA09, HA12-HA16).

14.6.49 
Potential: Within the proposed Power Generation Plant Site, there is 
potential for buried archaeological remains dating to WWII and possibly 
earlier. Within the Project Site, parts of Hirwaun Common have 
remained agricultural for centuries and there is potential for buried 
archaeology from any period, although particularly from the Bronze Age 
considering the wealth of cairnfields in the vicinity, and later coal mining 
related activities.  
14.7 
Preliminary Assessment of Potential Impacts 
14.7.1 
Current planning policy guidance for the historic environment, 
embodied in PPW (Cymru 2012), advises that Heritage Assets are an 
irreplaceable resource. It has been the intention of this study to identify 
the archaeological and heritage significance and potential of the Study 
Area, and assess the impact of the proposed Project, thus allowing the 
policy stated in PPW (Cymru 2012) to be enacted upon. 
Buried remains 
Power Generation Plant  
14.7.2 
The extent of any previous disturbance to buried archaeological 
remains is an important factor in assessing the potential impact of the 
proposed scheme of development. As Hirwaun Industrial Estate was 
originally a WWII Royal Ordnance munitions factory (HA06), it is likely 
that any buried remains were disturbed during its construction. Prior to 
the construction of the munitions factory, the land was used for 
agricultural and mineral extraction purposes for centuries.  
Gas Connection route corridor option 1 
14.7.3 
Land under which Gas Connection route corridor option 1 is sited has 
remained as undeveloped agricultural land as far as the earliest maps 
go back. The land was formerly part of Hirwaun Common. There is 
potential, therefore, for the survival of buried archaeology in these 
areas, particularly relating to mineral extraction, as this has not been 
disturbed. Any groundworks associated with development have the 
potential to impact directly on these assets. 
Gas Connection route corridor option 2 
14.7.4 
The majority of Gas Connection route corridor option 2 runs alongside 
roads, which may have previously impacted on any buried archaeology 
present. However, the roads are relatively recent additions to the 
landscape (approximately 1940s to 1950s). Prior to these roads the 
land was agricultural and also part of the Hirwaun Common. There is 
potential, therefore, for the survival of buried archaeology in these

areas, particularly relating to mineral extraction, as this has not been 
disturbed. Any groundworks associated with development have the 
potential to impact directly on these assets. 
Electrical Connection route corridor option 1 
14.7.5 
Land under which Electrical Connection route corridor option 1 is 
situated has not previously been the subject of any development. 
However, as this connection option will be an overhead line, and the 
only ground disturbance will be with the Power Generation Plant Site / 
Rhigos Substation there is not considered to be any potential to impact 
on buried archaeology. However, as this connection option will be 
clearly visible and will require support from up to three pylons of 
approximately 35 m in height, there is the potential that it could have 
impacts on the setting of above ground heritage assets. These potential 
impacts are explored in more detail below, along with the potential 
setting impacts of the Power Generation Plant.  
Electrical Connection route corridor option 2 
14.7.6 
As with the Power Generation Plant, Electrical Connection route 
corridor option 2 is situated within the Hirwaun Industrial Estate. It is 
therefore likely that any buried remains were disturbed during its 
construction  
Built Heritage:  
Power Generation Plant and Electrical Connection route corridor option 
1.  
14.7.7 
A number of buildings within the industrial estate almost certainly date 
to the Royal Ordnance Factory (HA06). The setting is largely industrial 
with a rural backdrop. 
14.7.8 
Tower Colliery, a Grade II Listed Building, was visited in order to 
assess the setting of this asset. There was no direct line of sight from 
Tower Colliery and therefore there would be no impact on the setting. 
Hirwaun Ironworks is a Scheduled Monument, which was visited, but 
again, no direct line of sight to the Project was witnessed due to a large 
plantation of mature trees. 
14.7.9 
Other points of interest in the surrounding area were also visited on a 
site assessment including Cefn Rhigos, Rhigos, Ty Newydd and Llygad 
Cynon. The only place where there is potential for visibility is from 
Rhigos, although the land is undulating and there are plantations of 
trees, which would obscure the view and protect the setting.

14.7.10 
The setting of any built heritage within the Study Area may also be 
impacted upon visually by the Project, such as the toll house (HA08), 
Caer llwyn cottage (HA04), Trebanog Fach (HA10), Bryn-y-gaer 
farmstead (HA11) and the cairnfields (HA05 and HA07). As visual 
impact may extend further than 1km, a larger Study Area will consider 
this in the forthcoming Cultural Heritage Section of the EIA. 
14.7.11 
One Heritage Asset (HA06) lies within the proposed Power Generation 
Plant Site and will be impacted upon should any development take 
place. A further two Heritage Assets comprise a toll house and a tram 
road (HA08 and HA09), which lie within the Project Site and may also 
be impacted upon should any development take place. 
14.7.12 
Following on from the above considerations, the significance of direct 
impacts on the Heritage Assets within the proposed Power Generation 
Plant Site and by the Electrical Connection route corridor option 1 has 
been determined as slight for HA06, although this would rise to 
moderate if the extant buildings were to be demolished. For the 
Heritage Assets within the Project Site, HA08 and HA09 are 
considered to have a neutral/slight significance of impact.  
14.7.13 
The significance of indirect impacts on the Heritage Assets within the 
1km Study Area is considered to have a neutral/slight impact for all 
Heritage Assets. See Table 14.10 below for full details.

Gas Connection route corridor options 1 and 2 and Electrical 
Connection route corridor option 2 
14.7.14 
Given that both gas connection route corridor options will be mainly 
buried, the pipeline will not have any impacts on above ground heritage 
assets. The AGI will be a relatively small structure, screened by 
vegetation. It is unlikely that it will give rise to any setting impacts on 
above ground heritage assets. Considering its relatively close proximity 
to the Power Generation Plant, the same assets as listed in Table 
14.10 could potentially be impacted by the AGI. However as the AGI 
would be far smaller and less intrusive than the Power Generation 
Plant, at this preliminary stage there are not considered to be any 
impacts to the setting of above ground heritage assets.  
14.7.15 
Electrical Connection route corridor option 2 would be buried for its 
entire length. The only above ground infrastructure would be within the 
Power Generation Plant Site and Rhigos substation. Therefore there is 
considered to be no potential for impacts on the setting of above 
ground assets due to Electrical Connection route corridor option 2.   
Mitigation Strategy  
14.7.16 
Current legislation draws a distinction between archaeological remains 
of national importance and other remains considered to be of lesser 
significance. Those perceived to be of international or national 
importance may require preservation in situ, whilst those of lesser 
significance 
may 
undergo 
preservation 
by 
record, 
where 
Regional/County or Local/Borough significance can be demonstrated. 
14.7.17 
One Heritage Asset (HA06) lies within the proposed Power Generation 
Plant Site, which will be directly impacted upon should any 
development take place. As this Heritage Asset comprises a former 
WWII Royal Ordnance Factory, it is recommended that a photographic 
and interpretative survey of any buildings relating to the Royal 
Ordnance Factory are subject to a building investigation of a sufficient 
level to allow a descriptive record and interpretation to be compiled. 
The Heritage Assets that lie within the Project Site (HA08 and HA09) 
may also be affected by the Project and it is recommended that a low-
level of building investigation should be carried out on the toll house 
(HA09) if it is to be directly impacted upon. Any parts of the tramroad

(HA08) that would be affected would need to be recorded also,

SOCIO-ECONOMICS 
15.1 
Introduction 
15.1.1 
The construction, operation and decommissioning phases of the 
Project have the potential to impact on the local area’s: labour market; 
community facilities and tourism sector. 
15.1.2 
Work completed for this PEIR includes a socio-economic policy review 
and baseline profile.  A description of the proposed approach to the 
socio-economic assessment will be sent to key consultees.  A 
preliminary assessment of anticipated impacts is outlined in this PEIR 
based on the initial analysis.  Further work is planned and findings will 
be reported in the final socio-economic chapter as part of the ES.  
15.2 
Legislative and Policy Context 
National Policy Statements 
15.2.2 
As explained in Section 2, NPS EN-1 explains the assessment 
principles to which the SoS will have regard in the examination of an 
energy NSIP (such as the proposed Project), and explains the generic 
socio-economic impacts with regard to energy infrastructure.  Specific 
considerations for fossil fuel generating stations are provided in the 
NPS for Fossil Fuel Generating Infrastructure (EN-2). The NPSs for 
Gas and Oil Pipelines (EN-4) and Electricity Networks Infrastructure 
(EN-5) provide specific considerations potentially relevant to the Gas 
Connection and Electrical Connection Compound and Electrical 
Connection respectively. 
15.2.3 
NPS EN-1 acknowledges that “the construction, operation and 
decommissioning of energy infrastructure may have socio-economic 
impacts at local and regional levels”. At paragraph 4.2.2 it states that in 
addition to an ES prepared in accordance with the European 
Environmental Impact Assessment Directive “the IPC will find it helpful 
if the applicant sets out information on the likely significant social and 
economic effects of the development, and show how any likely 
significant negative effects would be avoided or mitigated. This could 
include employment, equality, community cohesion and well-being.” 
15.2.4 
NPS EN-1 states that where the proposed Project is likely to have 
socio-economic impacts at local or regional levels, the applicant should 
undertake and include in their application an assessment of relevant 
socio-economic impacts, which may include the creation of jobs and 
training opportunities; the provision of additional local services and 
improvements to local infrastructure, including the provision of 
educational and visitor facilities; effects on tourism; and the impacts of

a changing influx of workers during the different phases of the energy 
infrastructure. 
15.2.5 
It further notes that in making a decision on an energy NSIP the SoS 
may attribute limited weight to assertions of socio-economic impact that 
are not supported by evidence and may take into account mitigation 
such as planning obligations and particular options as to phasing the 
development in relation to impacts.   
15.2.6 
NPS EN-2 Fossil Fuel Electricity Generating Infrastructure should be 
considered alongside NPS EN-1. It emphasises the benefits of a low 
carbon economy including the likely “positive effects on the Economy 
and Skills, and Health and Well-being as secondary benefits and 
positive effects in the medium/long term on climate change.” 
15.2.7 
NPS EN-4 Gas Supply Infrastructure and Gas and Oil Pipelines sets 
out policy for route selection for gas supply infrastructure and gas 
pipelines, along with likely impacts of their construction, commissioning 
and operation. 
15.2.8 
NPS EN-5 factors that should be taken into account related to route 
selection for developers, along with likely impacts of their construction, 
commissioning and operation. 
15.2.9 
While only a number of the impacts raised in the NPSs are considered 
likely to be relevant to the proposed Project, the socio-economic  
assessment may also take into account any relevant positive provisions 
the developer has made or is proposing to make to mitigate impacts 
(for example through planning obligations) and any legacy benefits that 
may arise as well as any options for phasing development in relation to 
the socio-economic impacts, to enable them to be considered by the 
SoS for the purposes of decision-making. 
Other National and Local Policy 
15.2.10 
Whilst the Planning Act 2008 is clear as to the primacy of the relevant 
NPS, other national and local planning policy can be considered 
important and relevant by the SoS in the determination of an energy 
NSIP. 
15.2.11 
The 2012 Gas Generation Strategy highlights that gas-fired power 
stations are relatively cost effective and quick to build.  It states that 
these plants can “offer employment opportunities throughout the 
country”. 
15.2.12 
The UK Low Carbon Transition Plan states, “Coal and gas will remain 
important to ensure our electricity supply is reliable and secure as we

- 417 - 
 
move towards greater dependence on intermittent renewable sources 
like wind” 
15.2.13 
Chapter 12 of Planning Policy Wales30 (PPW) is concerned with the 
provision of infrastructure and services. It emphasises the importance 
of infrastructure projects to Wales: 
“Adequate and efficient infrastructure, including services such as 
education and health facilities along with water supply, sewers, waste 
management, 
electricity 
and 
gas 
(the 
utilities) 
and telecommunications, is crucial for the economic, social and 
environmental sustainability of all parts of Wales. It underpins 
economic competitiveness and opportunities for households and 
businesses to achieve more socially and environmentally desirable 
ways of living and working”. 
15.2.14 
The Project is efficient in that it provides energy when renewable 
resources are in short supply. Gas resources are an efficient and 
reliable way to move towards a low carbon economy. 
15.2.15 
Energy Wales: A Low Carbon Transition (2012:10) places importance 
on gas supply “in order to compensate for the intermittency in supply 
from renewable resources”. In addition, “Gas is a flexible, responsive 
and reliable source of energy which can play a key role in the transition 
to a genuinely low carbon energy system”.  
15.2.16 
Economic Renewal: A New Direction (July 2010) recognises the need, 
in these challenging economic conditions, to improve energy resources 
and productivity. The need for a secure energy supply is highlighted as 
being of importance.  The proposed development will provide increased 
security in the energy supply.  
15.2.17 
Rhondda Cynon Taf Local Development Plan up to 2021 notes that the 
Project Site is in the Northern Strategy area.  Hirwaun Industrial Estate 
is designated as an important employment site (NSA 14.2). Therefore, 
the council will support the employment use of the site in order to 
promote economic growth of the area. The area is also designated as a 
strategic waste site in the Plan (CS9.2).  However, the investment and 
construction of a gas-fired power station is substantially higher than 
most waste infrastructure projects.  Moreover, gas-fired power stations 
have employment densities, during construction and operation, which 
are generally higher than waste projects.  Therefore, the economic 
benefits of gas-fired power stations are usually greater than waste 
infrastructure schemes.

Realistic Worst Case Scenario for Assessment 
15.3.1 
In respect of Socio-economics, the realistic worst case scenario from 
within the proposed Project parameters (which are described in Section 
4 of the PEIR) are set out in Table 15.1 below.

Number of gas turbine units 
1 (~ 299 MWe) 
15.3.2 
The different options for the configuration of the Power Generation 
Plant have little bearing on the impact to socio-economics. However, it 
is recognised that installing only 1 gas turbine generator at this site will 
have a marginally lower construction and operational workforce than 
installing a greater number of units.  
15.3.3 
A preliminary assessment of both options for the Gas Connection and 
the Electrical Connection is presented in this section. A decision on the 
preferred option for each will be taken following consultation. 
15.4 
Assessment Methodology and Significance Criteria  
15.4.1 
The approach adopted in undertaking this preliminary assessment of 
potential impacts on socio-economics, tourism and community 
infrastructure is summarised below. 
Guidance  
15.4.2 
The assessment follows UK Government guidelines and best practice. 
The methodology used to estimate impacts follows guidance set out in 
the HM Treasury’s Green Book31 and English Partnerships (EP) 
Additionality Guide, as well as taking into account the Department for 
Business Innovation and Skills research on additionality.32

15.4.3 
The following study areas have been used in this assessment, which 
have been defined in the methodology consultation exercise with 
consultees:   
� 
Socio-economic study area - The study area for the socio-
economic assessment is based on drive time catchment areas 
from the Project.  The ‘local area’ is defined within a 30 minute 
drive time, ‘wider area’ within a 45 minute drive time, and ‘wider 
region’ within a 60 minute drive time.  
� 
Tourism study area - The study area for the tourism 
assessment is defined by a 15 km radius from the Project Site.  
Facilities or notable points of focus of visitor attraction within this 
area have been reviewed.  Any significant tourism facilities 
located just outside the boundary have also been included.   
� 
Community Infrastructure study area - As proximity is likely to 
be the main determinant of impacts and their scale, the status 
(or catchment) of the community facility receptors in an area 
determines the scale and significance of any impacts.  Hirwaun 
is classed as a Key Settlement in the local plan33. Although in 
recent years there has been growth, this growth has not been 
supported by an increase in local services and facilities. The 
community facilities in Hirwaun are of small scale and are 
limited
34. Its community facilities therefore are likely to only serve 
a restricted area, not extending to settlements of similar or larger 
size, effects will tend to be limited to receptors within the local 
area. For this assessment, this is taken to be within a 5km radius 
of the Project Site.   
Approach 
15.4.4 
The main stages of the approach are as follows:  
Review available data/information 
15.4.5 
Data and information from national, regional and local databases has 
been reviewed, identifying information gaps and requirements for data

Comparative analysis 
15.4.6 
Data and information regarding the predicted and/or experienced socio-
economic effects of similar projects was examined.  
Baseline 
15.4.7 
The Study Area’s socio-economic position has been described using 
standard indicators. This provides a baseline from which potential 
impacts can be assessed: 
� 
Economic: the area has been described using a combination of: 
standard sources and indicators: research available at study 
area level; and research into the business and labour market 
structure of the local economy. 
� 
Tourism: the area’s visitor attraction has been profiled including: 
visitor attractions; visitor accommodation; tourism volume and 
value; and the local tourism economy. 
� 
Social: Indices of deprivation and demographic structure have 
been examined.  An audit of community infrastructure has been 
prepared. 
� 
Policy Context: planning, economic development and other 
relevant policy has been reviewed to identify related economic, 
social and regeneration objectives which the Project may affect 
(whether contributing to their realisation or otherwise). 
Assessment of potential economic impacts 
15.4.8 
A detailed assessment of likely effects on the local, regional and 
national economy during construction / demolition, operation and 
decommissioning of the proposed Project is being prepared. This will 
assess the scale of:  
� 
Direct economic impacts: jobs and GVA that are wholly or largely 
related to construction, decommissioning, and operation and 
maintenance of Project; 
� 
Indirect economic impacts (positive and negative): jobs and GVA 
generated in the study area in the chain of suppliers of goods and 
services to the direct activities; 
� 
Induced economic impacts: jobs and GVA created by direct and 
indirect employees’ spending in the study area or in the wider 
economy; and 
� 
Wider economic (catalytic) impacts (positive and negative): 
employment and income generated in the economy related to the

wider role of the proposed Project in influencing economic activities 
(including wider socio-economic effects).  
Assessment of potential tourism impacts 
15.4.9 
Tourism and recreational behaviour will only be detrimentally affected 
by a development where the effects of that proposed development 
either changes the visitor/user pattern in terms of numbers, and /or 
their patterns of expenditure for the worse.  As such, opportunities for 
tourist and visitor expenditure, any potential variation in expenditure or 
visitor numbers, and consequent effects on turnover or employment are 
of key importance to understanding tourism impacts. 
15.4.10 
A business survey will be carried out to gain a more detailed 
understanding of the local tourism economy and its current 
performance.  Businesses that will be contacted include key visitor 
accommodation providers, leisure activity providers and other relevant 
tourism businesses. 
15.4.11 
Facilities or notable points of focus in the Study Area have been 
identified.  Based upon the proposed Project’s anticipated visibility, 
comment is provided on the likelihood of the proposed Project 
influencing visitor and tourist attitudes and behaviour towards these 
visitor facilities and locations.  
15.4.12 
The significance of tourism impacts will be determined through an 
understanding of the sensitivity of a receptor and the anticipated 
magnitude of effect.   
Assessment of potential community infrastructure impacts 
15.4.13 
An assessment of the likely significant effects on local, regional and 
national community receptors during construction, operation and 
decommissioning of the proposed Project is being carried out. This 
assessment 
includes 
an 
audit 
of 
community 
infrastructure 
facilities/receptors within the local area and its associated effects (i.e. 
effects on local schools, local authority services and other 
infrastructure).  
Mitigation measures 
15.4.14 
Where impacts are assessed as significant adverse, mitigation 
measures are outlined.  As with impact identification, mitigation 
measures will be described discretely to address construction, 
operation and decommissioning impacts. 
15.4.15 
For the purposes of the assessment, moderate impacts and above are 
considered as significant.

Conclusions on cumulative and residual effects 
15.4.16 
An initial assessment of cumulative effects is presented in Section 16 of 
this PEIR. A preliminary assessment of residual impacts is presented in 
Section 15.10.  
15.4.17 
In addition to quantitative and qualitative assessment, impact 
significance is defined by the combination of the sensitivity of receptors 
and the magnitude of impacts on them. Criteria specific to socio-
economic factors have been adopted in defining the hierarchies of 
receptor sensitivity and impact magnitude. 
Determining socio-economic sensitivity of effect 
15.4.18 
For economic impacts and effects (including employment), the 
availability of labour and skills is critical in accommodating the 
demands, needs and requirements of the proposed development. 
Adequate capacity results in a low sensitivity, while limited capacity 
results in a high sensitivity.   
15.4.19 
The key socio-economic indicators in relation to the criteria include: 
� 
the proportion of skilled workforce in the study area relative to 
national averages;  
� 
educational attainment levels in relation to national averages; 
� 
the 
proportion 
of 
employment 
in 
relevant 
sectors 
(i.e. 
manufacturing and construction workers) in the Study Area; 
� 
the availability of labour (including the unemployed workforce); and  
� 
relevant education and training provision, including  existing and 
proposed programmes provided by institutions serving the Study 
Area 
Table 15.2 - Socio-economics Sensitivity Criteria  
Sensitivity  
Example 
Very High 
There is no availability of labour and skills in the area’s 
workforce (this is dependent on specific project 
requirements and the degree to which they can be met 
in the Study area). 
The Project would lead to labour market pressure and 
distortions (i.e., skills and capacity shortages, import of 
labour,wage inflation). 
High  
There is low/limited availability of labour and skills in 
the area’s workforce (The Project would lead to labour 
market pressure and distortions (i.e., skills and 
capacity shortages, import of labour, wage inflation).

Where an effect would not be discernible; and/or 
where fewer than 10 jobs would be created or lost 
within the Study Area. 
and/or 
Effects would be temporary (i.e. experienced for less 
than one year). 
Determining socio-economic magnitude of effect 
15.4.20 
A level of impact magnitude has been ascribed based on the 
information on the Project’s socio-economic outputs and the baseline 
structure of the area. In economic terms, the key socio-economic 
receptors are: participants in the labour force; and the level of 
occupational skills available in the study area. 
15.4.21 
The magnitude of the effect of potential socioeconomic impacts is 
assessed against the thresholds shown in Table 15.3.

Sensitivity of tourism receptor 
15.4.22 
Impact significance is determined through an understanding of the 
sensitivity of a receptor and the anticipated magnitude of effect.  In 
considering the level of tourism sensitivity, the standing of the receptor 
or resource is the defining factor. This is established against: 
� 
Tourism business’ relative attraction to customers from outside the 
Study Area and the Projects’ potential to influence broader 
perceptions of the area.  Where a majority of trade is non-local this 
is more likely to be the case; and 
� 
The relative importance of tourism as a business sector. Where 
tourism is more important relative to other sectors, impacts may 
have the potential to generate broader impacts. Similarly, where it 
is of relatively low significance, impacts on tourism and related 
sectors are unlikely to generate a high level of adverse impact 
across the broader economy. 
15.4.23 
The main factors relevant to the consideration of tourism receptor 
sensitivity are outlined in Table 15.4.

Socio Economic and Labour Market Sensitivity 
15.6.12 
The socio-economic profile outlined above indicates that there is a 
constrained supply of labour and skills. The Project may lead to labour 
market pressure and distortions (i.e. wage inflation, skills and capacity 
shortages, import of labour). 
15.6.13 
The overall sensitivity of the labour market is considered to be low/ 
medium.  
Tourism Context  
15.6.14 
This section provides a tourism profile of Wales specifically the South 
East in terms of visitor and tourist trends, tourism volume and value, 
visitor 
patterns, 
visitor 
accommodation 
occupancy 
rates 
and 
expenditure patterns.  The most up-to-date sources of information have 
been used.  Where possible, figures for RCTCBC have been provided 
in preference to the wider South East area as the Project is located in 
this council area. 
Wales Key Visitor Attractions and Activities 
15.6.15 
The Welsh Government carries out an annual survey of patronage 
popular visitor attractions in Wales.  Table 15.17 details the top 10 
unpaid and paid visitor attractions, with The LC and the Wales 
Millennium Centre the most popular paid and unpaid attractions 
respectively. Only one attraction, the Cyfarthfa Castle Museum, is 
located within close proximity (i.e. within 15km) of the Project.

Domestic Staying Trips Nights and Spend 
15.6.18 
The South East region between 2008 and 2010 has been in significant 
decline in regard to domestic tourism.  Between 2008 and 2010 the 
number of trips fell by 24%. The number of nights stayed was down by 
30% and overall domestic spend reduced by 26%.  Whereas, the other 
regions in Wales all experienced an increase trips, nights stayed and 
spend over the same period.   
15.6.19 
In 2010 North Wales was the most popular and significant domestic 
tourism destination.  It accounted for over a third of trips, nights stayed 
and spend whereas the South East region accounted for less than a 
fifth in all these categories.  The neighbouring South West region also 
accounted for more trips, nights and spend than the South East.

Overseas Trips Nights and Spend 
15.6.22 
Insert 15.1 shows that in terms of overseas tourism, visitor numbers to 
Rhondda Cynon Taff have fluctuated between 2006 and 2012.  In this 
period the area went from a high of 20,000 visitors in 2008 to a low of 
7,700 visitors in 2009.  This fall in visitor number can be expected due 
to the economic climate at the time and more people choosing to 
holiday at home.  However, the area has noted an increase in visitor 
numbers in the most recent recorded period of 2012.   
15.6.23 
In 2012 Rhondda Cynon Taff only accounted for 3% of trips in the 
South East region.  The majority of trips in the region are to Cardiff 
which accounts for 70% of trips.  The area of Newport accounts for a 
tenth of trips.    This shows that other areas in the South East are more 
popular for overseas tourists.

Overseas Visitor Spend 
15.6.28 
Overseas visitor spend in Rhondda Cynon Taff has fluctuated between 
2006 and 2012.  Spend fell significantly from a high of £8.5 million in 
2008 to a low of £1.3 million the next year.  Most recently overseas 
visitor spend has been rising in the area. 
15.6.29 
In total visitor spend in the South East Wales region in 2012 was £167 
million.  Rhondda Cynon Taff accounts for only 5% of spend in the 
wider region.  Whereas Cardiff (£113 million), Monmouthshire (£14 
million), Newport (£13 million) and Bridgend (£9 million) all account for 
more overseas visitor spend in the South East region.   This again 
highlights the fact that Rhondda Cynon Taff is not one the main 
overseas visitor destinations in the South East area.

Profile of Tourism Business  
15.6.30 
Table 15.22 shows the number of tourism related businesses within 
5km and 15km of the Project Site by category in 2003 (earliest year 
available) and 2008.  The composition of tourism businesses remained 
relatively constant within 5km of the Project Site whilst there has been 
an increase in wider 15km area.  In the 5km area there has been a 3% 
increase in tourism related businesses between 2003 and 2008. In the 
15km area there has been a 12% increase in tourism related 
businesses. This suggests that the area closest to the Project Site is 
not as tourism orientated as the wider 15km area. 
15.6.31 
As of 2008, there were 724 tourism related businesses in the 15km 
study area and 103 businesses within 5km of the Project Site.  The 
majority of businesses in these areas were either bars or restaurants.

Insert 15.5 shows the concentration of tourism businesses per super 
output area42 within a 15 km radius from the proposed Project Site.  
Merthyr Tydfil and Aberdare have the highest concentrations of 
tourism related businesses (46-100) within the 15km radius of the 
Project Site. These consist of businesses such as restaurants, bars 
as well as recreational activities. Areas to the west and south west of 
the Project Site have low concentrations of tourism businesses. To 
the north tourism businesses are present in the area, but not at a 
large scale.   Nearby areas outside the 15km radius such as 
Swansea have much higher concentrations of tourism-related 
businesses.

� 
In terms of domestic tourism, the South East Region has recently 
been in decline.  Domestic visitor numbers, nights and spend have 
fallen by a least a quarter between 2008 and 2010.  Whereas all 
other regions in the South East have experienced growth in their 
domestic tourism markets; 
� 
North Wales attracts significantly more visits, nights and spend 
than the South East;  
� 
Rhondda Cynon Taff accounts for only a small proportion of 
domestics day trips and spend when compared to other local 
authority areas in Wales; 
� 
Despite having a recent increase in overseas visitor trips, nights 
and spend, the Rhondda Cynon Taff area is not a major overseas 
tourist destination in South East Wales.  Areas such as Cardiff and 
Newport attract more visitors;   
� 
The immediate 5km area around the Development has 
approximately 100 tourism related businesses.  The majority of 
which are bars and restaurants; and 
� 
Overall there is a fairly low tourism business density in the 15km 
area around the development.  Other neighbouring areas outside 
the 15km, such as Swansea, have higher tourism densities.  This 
implies that the area in relative close proximity to the Development 
is not a primary tourist destination in the South East of Wales. 
Tourism Sensitivity 
15.6.33 
The tourism profile outlined above indicates that tourism is not a 
significant sector in the local area. Therefore, tourism is considered to 
be of low sensitivity to the proposed Project. 
Community infrastructure audit 
15.6.34 
Within 5km of the Project Site there are a range of community 
infrastructure such as schools, libraries, care homes, hospitals, 
community centres and parks.  This includes the following facilities. 
Education

1 Nursery School 
�

Preliminary assessment of Potential Impacts 
Socio-economic  
15.7.2 
The Project will deliver positive socio-economic impacts through:  
� 
employment creation; and  
� 
capital expenditure and worker spending in the local economy. 
15.7.3 
These effects, with the exception of decommissioning employment 
(negligible) have been assessed to be of minor positive significance 
(Table 15.23).  No adverse socio-economic impacts or effects are 
identified through the assessment.

assessment, there is no requirement for any mitigation measures at this 
stage. 
15.9 
Preliminary Assessment of Residual Effects 
15.9.1 
On the basis of the preliminary environmental information and 
assessment described above there are not predicted to be likely 
significant effects on socio-economics, tourism and recreation and 
community infrastructure as a result of the proposed Project. 
15.10 
Next Steps 
15.10.1 
Building from this initial assessment the following steps be undertaken 
in the next phase of socio-economic analysis: 
� A mapping of the ZTV analysis against tourism and recreational 
receptors in the area to gain a better understanding of the potential 
visual impact of the assessment; 
� Detailed estimates of the economic impact of the construction and 
operation of the proposed Project and the construction of the gas and 
electricity components; and 
� An impact assessment of the community facilities.

understanding of other developments currently planned for the area.  It 
draws on the assessment of impacts provided in sections 6 to 15. 
16.1.2 
A more detailed assessment of these impacts will be provided in the ES 
that will accompany the proposed DCO Application.   
16.1.3 
Cumulative impacts can be defined as either: 
� Type 1 Cumulative Impacts: These are combined effects of 
different types of impact on a single receptor. For example: dust, 
noise and visual impacts resulting from construction and operation 
of the proposed Project and other reasonably foreseeable future 
developments; or 
� Type 2 cumulative impacts: These are the same type of impact 
from the proposed Project and reasonably foreseeable future 
developments which may individually be insignificant, but could be 
cumulatively significant.  For example: cumulative traffic impacts 
during construction.   
16.1.4 
This section presents the current and reasonably foreseeable future 
developments considered as part of this preliminary cumulative impact 
assessment. They are listed and described in Table 16.1.  
16.1.5 
For the purposes of this assessment, reasonably foreseeable future 
developments have been defined as those which;  
� 
are consented but not yet built;  
� 
are not yet consented but in the planning system; and  
� 
are committed to come forward (i.e. supported in a development 
plan)

Cumulative Impact 
The construction phases of the Project with the other listed developments are unlikely to co-incide. Construction 
of the Project and operation of the other developments may give rise to air quality impacts, although these will be 
very different in nature (e.g. construction dust vs emissions) and therefore, there are unlikely to be cumulative 
impacts.  
Noise and 
Vibration

Description, 
Proposed 
Mitigation and

Cumulative Impact 
Cumulative impacts may arise due to: noise and vibration generating equipment / plant which is used during the 
construction the Project - together with noise and vibration emissions from nearby operation of Enviroparks 
Hirwaun, the Hirwaun Energy Centre and Ferraris Bakery. There are not anticipated to be any significant sources 
of noise from operation of the Rhigos Substation, Solar PV development or residential housing development. This 
will be investigated within the ES.  
 
It is noted here that the preliminary assessment of construction noise impacts from the Project alone was judged 
to be minor.

Description, 
Proposed 
Mitigation and

Cumulative Impact 
Water use during construction is likely to be from the mains water supply which currently supplies the International 
Greetings UK site. There are therefore not anticipated to be any impacts to water quality. Although both Gas 
Connection route corridor options cross minor field drains, it is not anticipated that any of the other developments 
listed will impact on these field drains.

Description, 
Proposed 
Mitigation and 
Likely Residual 
Cumulative Impact 
As the main impact on geology, contamination and agriculture from the construction of the proposed Project 
would be the sterilisation of Agricultural Land, the only cumulative impact would be an increased loss of greenfield 
land in the area following the construction of the Rhigos substation. However, neither land on which the Gas 
Connection route corridor options, nor the Rhigos Substation are sited is considered to be land of the best quality. 
Additionally, the developments together would only take relatively small quantities of land. Therefore, any 
cumulative impacts are considered minor.

the other developments is not anticipated to be significant. As it is unlikely that the construction phases of the 
Project and other developments will run in parallel, no cumulative impacts are anticipated.

Although the construction phase of the developments listed above are unlikely to coincide with the construction of 
the Project, cumulative impacts could arise between the construction phase of the Project and the operational 
phase of Enviroparks Hirwaun (which requires deliveries of waste) Hirwaun Energy Centre (also requiring 
deliveries of fuel), Ferraris Bakery (requiring deliveries of food) and the residential housing development (from 
increased traffic from residents). These impacts will be further investigated as part of the ES.

There is the potential for cumulative impacts to arise from the operation of the Power Generation Plant in 
conjunction with the operation of the Enviroparks Hirwaun development and the Hirwaun Energy Centre 
development. For example, these could include the cumulative impact from the simultaneous release of stack 
emissions. These will be fully investigated at the EIA stage.   
Operation of Rhigos substation, Ferraris’ Bakery, the solar PV development and the residential housing 
development will not give rise to air quality impacts, therefore, there will be no cumulative impacts.   
 
It is noted here that the preliminary assessment of operational air quality impacts from the Project alone was
