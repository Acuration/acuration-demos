Safety Performance
Drax Power – Generation
Generation
•
37% of generation from biomass in H1 2015
•
Third biomass unit now operating with over 
85% biomass burn
•
First biomass unit major outage underway 
Fuel procurement
•
Increase in international (low nitrogen) coal
•
Good progress with near-term biomass volumes
•
Lower biomass volumes contracted from 2016
- CfD would underpin acceleration of long-term 
supply chain development
Commodity markets
•
Continued weak commodity markets
•
Low gas prices – power markets remain weak
•
International coal remains weak

•
DECC external expert study underway
•
Biomass can contribute to lower overall costs
- Reserve, back-up, transmission and 
infrastructure costs
- System costs for 3 Drax units would be £3bn less 
than equivalent offshore wind generation in 2020(1)

API2 is the main reference price (including cost, freight and insurance) for steam coal to be delivered to 
Amsterdam, Rotterdam and Antwerp. API4 is the reference price for steam coal to be delivered free on board 
(“FOB”) to Richards Bay, South Africa. API6 is the reference price for steam coal to be delivered FOB to 
Newcastle, Australia.
AVERAGE ACHIEVED PRICE
Power revenues divided by volume of net sales (includes imbalance charges).
BM
BALANCING MECHANISM
The mechanism through which the System Operator can call upon additional generation/consumption or reduce 
generation/consumption, through market participants’ bids and offers, in order to balance the system minute by 
minute.
CESP
COMMUNITY ENERGY SAVING PROGRAMME
CESP was created as part of the Government's Home Energy Saving Programme. It required gas and electricity 
suppliers and electricity generators to deliver energy saving measures to domestic consumers in specific low 
income areas of Great Britain. CESP came into force on 1 September 2009. The CESP obligation period ran 
from 1 October 2009 to 31 December 2012.

walls.
EBITDA

OPTED-IN / OPTED-OUT
An opted-in plant is a power station that has elected to comply with the LCPD emissions standards. Opted-out 
plant has not elected to comply and is therefore only permitted to run for 20,000 hours and must in any event 
close by the end of 2015.
ADVANTAGED FUELS
Fuel that gives a price advantage against standard bituminous coals. Such fuels include, off specification coals 
and petcoke.
RO
RENEWABLES OBLIGATION
The obligation placed on licensed electricity suppliers to deliver a specified amount of their electricity from 
eligible renewable sources. 
ROC
RENEWABLES OBLIGATION CERTIFICATE
The obligation requires licensed electricity suppliers to ensure that specified and increasing amounts of the 
electricity they supply are from renewable sources. Eligible generators of electricity using renewable energy 
sources receive a pre-specified number of ROCs per MWh of renewable power generation dependant on date of 
commission and technology. These certificates can then be traded.

Low gas spreads resulted in gas plant 
capacity withdrawn / considered for closure
•
All opted-out coal plant now closed
- Ironbridge converted to biomass until Dec-15
•
Announced closures of Ferrybridge and 
Longannet by March 2016
•
Oil-fired plant closing prior to full utilisation 
of running hours

Data Source: National Grid
Oil prices at six year low
•
Driven by over supply
•
Increased US shale production
•
OPEC unwilling to give up market share
•
Lower oil prices filtering through to gas contracts 
with an oil-indexation element
LNG prices under pressure 
•
Lower oil price filtering through to LNG prices
•
Spread between Asia and Europe has narrowed 
•
Europe has become more competitive, resulting in 
year on year increase in LNG deliveries to UK 
•
Japanese nuclear remain constrained (limited 
number returning in 2015)
Rough storage
•
Due to a fault capacity at the UK’s largest storage 
facility has been reduced by 25% 
- Partly off-set by a reduced reserve requirement
•
Market now more exposed during prolonged 
cold spells this winter

UK Indigenous Coal Production vs. Net Imports
Seaborne market remains oversupplied
•
Atlantic market supported during H1 2015 by 
supply issues in Russia and Colombia
Strength of the US$ has protected some 
producers from weak coal prices 
•
Currency benefits biggest where producers are 
less exposed to US$ denominated costs
China imports falling, with India now 
the growth focus
•
Chinese seaborne steam coal imports 44% 
lower year to date
•
Chinese stocks remain high 
•
Indian demand up 35% YoY
UK domestic coal production under pressure 
from low international prices
•
Closure of Hatfield mine
