Energy Transition Readiness Index
A new report from the REA, commissioned by Eaton and Drax.

Summary

2
The global climate is changing due to growing emissions of greenhouse gases, largely caused by our demand for 
energy.  Public and political support for action is increasing. Consequently, the global energy sector is undergoing a 
fundamental transition, driven by decarbonisation, decentralisation and digitisation.  The rapid growth of renewable 
electricity, allied with smart distributed energy technologies and new business models, together with greater political 
commitment and customer engagement, is driving changes to energy markets to facilitate this transition. 
Importantly, the rapid growth in variable renewable electricity generation has meant that power systems and markets 
must be more flexible to compensate for the greater volatility in this generation and keep the balance with customer 
demand.  The need for this flexibility, especially from distributed energy resources, is essential to facilitate the energy 
transition. Such flexibility resources are forecast to grow significantly in the future - electricity markets are key to 
enabling this investment and growth. 
The energy transition, enabled by flexibility market reform, is already well underway in many European countries, 
enabled by public policy, regulation, power markets, and technology, but the pace of progress varies.  We have engaged 
with experts across nine Northern European countries to assess and compare the current status of electricity flexibility 
markets in each country.
We scored each country’s electricity market in the assessment according to its progress against: 
• Open market access for flexibility services
• Socio-political support for the energy transition
• Ability to exploit new technologies and business models
The overall results of this analysis are shown in the following ranking:
The report shows that the Netherlands and the Scandinavian countries are more advanced in exploiting new distributed 
flexibility resources while Germany, Great Britain and France are slower.
Key features of the higher-ranking countries are that they benefit from flexibility markets that:
• allow fair, transparent, and easy access to all participants, addressing conflicts of interest and other barriers. 
• provide market certainty and sufficient visibility on returns to support capital investments by flexibility providers. 
• are supported by clear policy direction and the exploitation of available technologies. 
However, all countries appear relatively weak on strategies for developing electric vehicle infrastructure and markets 
with vehicle to grid flexibility services.

REA Introductory remarks
Flexibility is key to integrating more renewable energy and smart 
clean tech onto the system and delivering the UK’s ambitions: the 
cheaper “net-zero” energy system we need.  In the UK, Government 
and Ofgem have made progress in the past few years but the 
perception is that this has started to slow and renewed impetus, 
especially on the development of effective markets, is necessary. 
 
The blackout of 9th August in the UK brought the changing energy 
system into sharp focus but the fact that energy storage responded 
so quickly to events helped manage the impact on the system and 
indicates the possibilities such services provide. 
 
We are confident that with appropriate actions and renewed vigour, 
the system transition to be more smart, more decentralised and 
ultimately more secure and of course decarbonised will see the UK 
start to move up the Scorecard.

Conclusions
Approach to evaluation
Electricity sector flexibility services offer major new 
investment opportunities, and strongly support the key 
goals of decarbonisation, decentralisation and digitisation. 
Flexibility is commonly defined as the extent to which 
generation and demand can quickly respond to a changing 
power system and market conditions. Flexibility services 
provide valuable support to stabilise grid operations, 
balance supply and demand and ensure that system 
frequency and voltage stays within operational limits 
especially when unexpected changes occur. 
The demand for flexibility services is increasing as vast 
new sources of variable renewable energy are added and 
This paper sets out the results of a review of nine 
European flexible power markets. We have presented an 
index of market attractiveness for new investors in flexible 
power, ranking the countries in terms of their relative 
attractiveness.  The study has used publicly available 
information and interviews with an expert panel to 
determine the scores against detailed ideal state criteria.
Each of these markets has different characteristics 
- for example Great Britain and Ireland do not have 
synchronous connections with each other or with 
European electricity markets, resulting in different 
requirements for flexibility services. There are also 
Netherlands 
A strong socio-political commitment to the energy transition that 
in particular enables flexible distributed energy resources, new 
technologies and business models.  
Finland, Sweden, Denmark, Norway
A strong commitment to renewables and the energy transition. 
The Nordic markets have advanced flexibility trading 
arrangements, including for distributed energy. Norway scores 
slightly lower than the other Nordic markets as it can cover many 
of its flexibility needs through its large hydro capacity, curtailing 
the development of arrangements for distributed flexibility. 
Ireland 
With major renewable energy penetration on a small energy 
system with limited interconnection, Ireland is actively reforming 
its energy markets to enable distributed energy resources.
In performing our evaluation, the key questions that have been asked are:
• Do the regulatory and market arrangements enable or restrict new investment in flexibility services?
• Is the socio-political background supportive or an impediment to investment?
• Are measures in place to help develop and deploy flexibility technologies?
These questions have been structured into the following assessment framework, which examines the key factors in 
each area.  
Market access
• Regulation enables fair access 
for all providers
• Trading - markets are open and 
effective
• Transaction costs are fair for 
flexibility
Socio-political support
• Flexibility needs are recognised
• Supportive political and public 
consensus
• Public policy and regulation 
aligned
Technology potential
• Grid accessibility
• EV Infrastructure deployment 
enabled
• Digitisation enabled
• Innovation enabled

replace the large synchronous fossil-fuel generators that 
have mainly provided these services in the past. Power 
systems must be able to operate in circumstances where 
renewable energy output may vary significantly from hour 
to hour. 
But as these generators are being displaced by renewable 
energy generation with more volatile outputs, new 
providers of flexibility services are emerging, including 
distributed generation, energy storage, and demand 
response.  These new providers can face challenges to 
investment and deployment because of barriers such as 
limitations to access flexible power markets.  
different generation characteristics. Norway benefits 
from a very large volume of flexible hydro generation, 
France has a sizeable supply of power from its nuclear 
plant, whereas other countries have different levels 
of renewable electricity capacity.  Some countries are 
reliant on interconnector imports for flexibility. There 
are different market designs, product definitions, and 
operational practices as well. 
While there are significant differences between markets, 
our analysis has considered the attractiveness of each 
market from the perspective of new investors and how 
they might perceive the attractiveness of each individual 
market, seeking to take the differences into account.
Germany 
A strong commitment to the energy transition and distributed 
energy resources and encouraging new technologies. But change 
to market structures to enable distributed flexibility is slow.  
Great Britain 
A strong policy commitment to decarbonisation, encouraging 
new technologies and business models. But regulatory and 
market change to enable flexible distributed energy is complex 
and slow. 
France 
Today, hydro generation and interconnectors offer significant 
volumes of flexibility, but as the share of renewables 
in the energy mix grows and nuclear capacity declines, 
more distributed flexibility will be needed. There is lack of 
transparency in the provision of some of the flexibility services. 
Certain balancing services are met through the mandatory 
participation from large generators, rather than competitively 
procured from the market.
Transition factors
Each individual item has been scored and used to present an overall score and ranking.  Some key observations are 
set out below, with further detailed analysis explaining the scoring criteria and rationale for the scores given to each 
country in the annex at the end of this report.
This report shows that readiness for the energy transition  
and the development of flexibility markets is at different 
stages of maturity in different countries for the key areas we 
have assessed:
Market factors 
In high scoring countries, regulatory arrangements and market 
rules allow a wide range of distributed flexibility resources 
to participate in a variety of markets, but in lower scoring 
countries, there are often unclear rules, conflicts, and market 
access barriers, thereby hindering development.
Market trading arrangements range from transparent markets 
that allow different contract terms and volumes that enable 
flexibility and aggregation, to those where trading of flexibility 
is limited. 
In high scoring countries, market transaction costs are 
equitable with other technologies, whereas in lower scoring 
countries, these can penalise flexibility and present a barrier.
Socio-economic factors
In high scoring countries, there is a clear roadmap for the 
electricity market transition involving all key participants, 
whereas in lower scoring countries the roadmap and roles of 
individual industry participants is less clear.
In addition, in high scoring countries, there is a clear public 
social and economic acceptance of the energy transition and of 
the costs and mitigations involved. In lower scoring countries, 
this may not be so well understood or accepted. 
In high scoring countries, there is a strong political 
commitment to a zero-carbon economy, and this is translated 
into a strong regulatory framework that will deliver the 
objectives particularly in the area of flexibility. The lower 
scoring countries have weaker commitments to deliver the 
regulatory reform necessary to incentivise investment in 
flexibility resources.
 
Technology factors
In high scoring countries, the grid network is easily able to 
integrate new distributed flexibility resources, whereas lower 
scoring countries will have technical or operational barriers 
that inhibit the application of distributed flexibility services.  
For EV infrastructure, high scoring countries may be expected 
to have a clear roadmap for providing EV charging signals 
and bi-directional charging so that EVs can participate in the 
flexibility market. However, progress appears relatively slow 
across all countries resulting in average to low scores.
In high scoring countries, digital technologies i.e. 
communications, dispatch, smart meters, data standards, 
and IT systems across markets, are a key enabler for 
flexibility markets. In lower scoring markets not all this digital 
infrastructure is in place.
Finally, good performing countries have a clear route for 
technology innovation to participate in flexibility markets 
perhaps using regulatory sandboxes, whereas in lower 
performing countries there are often barriers to new 
technologies.    
In summary, this assessment has shown that there are 
many challenges that may delay the introduction of 
flexibility services and put the achievement of the energy 
transition at risk. All countries in this assessment are 
clearly addressing the problems but it is evident that some 
are further ahead than others in achieving this goal.

Annex - Individual country 
Our approach 
The scoring and ranking of each country have been carried out by scoring a series of questions against each of the sub-
elements listed for our three key transition factors defined above.
The scores range from 5 (green), which shows the most ideal state, to 1 (red) which shows the least ideal state.  The table 
also shows overall country averages across all the sub-elements (set out below each column) which have been used to derive 
the country rankings.

6. Ireland  
Overall, in Ireland there is a good political and public 
consensus around the energy transition, especially on 
the need for decarbonisation.  This is supported by good 
progress on market and technology developments.
This results in the following average scores for each of the 
main three evaluation categories.
 
Market factors 
Ireland has high levels of wind generation and therefore high 
variability, driving a significant requirement for flexibility 
services. 
Balancing and flexibility markets are run by the TSO and are 
open and accessible to mainly industrial scale participants. 
There is good participation of generation and demand 
response providers for a variety of products. 
There is a Single Electricity Market (I-SEM) on the island of 
Ireland and market trading arrangements. This market is 
being developed to allow aggregation and different contract 
terms and volumes to be traded as elsewhere in Europe.  
Socio-economic factors
In Ireland, there is a clear roadmap for the electricity market 
transition involving all key participants, together with a 
clear public social and economic acceptance of the energy 
transition. 
5. Norway  
There are many similarities between the Nordic countries and 
their approach to flexibility development. 
In Norway, there is a strong political and public consensus 
around the energy transition and decarbonisation. This is 
supported by the closely aligned market regimes across the 
countries and proven flexibility service trading through a 
common electricity market. 
 
Market factors 
Balancing and flexibility markets are open and accessible to 
a wide range of participants and technologies. There is good 
participation of generation and demand response providers 
across a variety of products. 
Market trading arrangements provide open and flexible 
markets that allow aggregation and different contract terms 
and volumes to be traded.  
Norway scores slightly lower than the other Nordic countries 
as it can cover its flexibility needs through its large hydro 
capacity, reducing the relative requirement to develop 
detailed arrangements for distributed flexibility. However, 
this is expected to change as electric vehicle rollout increases. 
Socio-economic factors
In Norway, there is a clear roadmap for the electricity market 
transition involving all key participants, together with a 
7. Germany  
Overall, in Germany there is a strong political and public 
consensus around the energy transition ‘Energiewende’ 
to a low carbon energy system.  This is supported by good 
progress on market/technology developments across a very 
large electricity market.
This results in the following average scores for each of the 
main three evaluation categories.
 
Market factors 
Regulatory arrangements and market rules previously 
restricted distributed flexibility resources from participating 
in a variety of markets.
These arrangements are in the process of being changed 
to allow more open access to markets for alternative 
technologies, aggregation and flexible contract terms.
Socio-economic factors
There is a clear roadmap for the electricity market transition 
involving all key participants, together with a clear public 
social and economic acceptance of the energy transition and 
of the costs involved. 
There is a strong political commitment to the Energiewende, 
and this is translated into a strong regulatory framework that 
8. Great Britain 
In Great Britain, there is a good political and public consensus 
around the need for the energy transition, but this has not 
translated fully into regulatory and market change. 
There is good progress on developing new technologies but 
there are barriers to implementation. 
This results in the following average scores for each of the 
main three evaluation categories.
 
Market factors 
Markets are generally open to all forms of flexibility. 
Aggregation is enabled in most of the balancing services 
and wider access to the Balancing mechanism is expected in 
December 2019. 
Since 2018, GB DNOs have been tendering and procuring 
for various flexibility services to help solve congestion in the 
local electricity grids. In 2019, all GB DNOs published jointly a 
roadmap setting out the steps they intend to take to enable a 
smarter and more flexible energy system.
However, the market is highly fragmented and complex with 
specific products essentially targeted to specific technologies. 
Major improvements are planned to include charging, access 
and product reforms, but implementation is slow which gives 
rise to market uncertainty. 
Socio-economic factors
There is a strong political commitment to decarbonisation 
and the energy transition, with a Net Zero target for 2050 
having recently been passed into legislation.  There is 
evidence of good public support.

Technology factors
The grid network is strong and can integrate new distributed 
flexibility resources. These may become increasingly needed 
to balance new demand from electric vehicle rollout.   
Norway is a leader in EV rollout, but progress is slower in 
providing EV charging signals and bi-directional charging so 
that EVs can participate in the flexibility market.

Technology factors
The grid network can integrate new distributed flexibility 
resources but has some technical or operational barriers.  
Progress is slow in providing EV charging signals and bi-
directional charging so that EVs can participate in flexibility 
markets. 
Development of digital technologies e.g. smart meters helps 
to enable flexibility markets. 
There is support for technology and business model 
innovations to participate in flexibility markets, but potential 
for more to be done.
The GB’s regulatory framework will need to be further 
aligned with this new target and to deliver the associated 
transition and flexibility changes and objectives. 
Technology factors
The grid network has technical/operational constraints 
in several regions, which can delay access by distributed 
energy resources. In the future, with the right network access 
framework, distributed energy resources may play a more 
important role in optimising future grid investment needs.
Progress is slow in providing EV charging signals and bi-
directional charging so that EVs can participate in flexibility 
markets. 
Delays to deployment of digital technologies such as smart 
meters and open data standards may constrain flexibility 
markets.
There is good support to enable technology and business 
model innovations to test their participation in flexibility 
markets.
9. France  
Overall, in France there is a good political and public 
consensus around the energy transition, especially on 
the need for decarbonisation.  This is supported by good 
progress on market and technology developments.
This results in the following average scores for each of the 
main three evaluation categories.
Market factors 
France’s growth in renewables means that distributed 
flexibility needs will increase in future. 
Regulatory arrangements and market rules allow trading of 
distributed flexibility resources. Independent generation and 
demand providers and aggregators can participate in most 
products and markets. 
France scores slightly lower than other countries mainly 
because of lack of transparency in some of the flexibility 
services, as well as the fact that certain balancing services 
are met through the mandatory participation from large 
generators, rather than competitively procured from the 
market. 
Socio-economic factors

Technology
There is a strong political commitment to the energy 
transition with a clear regulatory framework that should 
deliver decentralised energy and flexibility objectives. 
Technology factors
The grid network can easily integrate new distributed 
flexibility resources.  
While EV development plans have commenced, more 
progress is needed in providing EV charging signals so that 
EV’s can participate in flexibility markets. 
Development of digital technologies e.g. smart meters helps 
to enable flexibility markets. 
There is good support for technology and business model 
innovations to participate in flexibility markets.
