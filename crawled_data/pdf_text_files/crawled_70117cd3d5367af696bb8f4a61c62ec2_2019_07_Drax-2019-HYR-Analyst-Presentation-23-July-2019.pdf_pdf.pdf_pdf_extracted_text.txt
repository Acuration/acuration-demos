ENABLING A ZERO CARBON, 
LOWER COST ENERGY FUTURE
Absolute increase in demand for electricity
Decarbonisation of heating and transport
Globally 70-85% of electricity from intermittent renewables by 2050(1)
>15% from complementary flexible sources – biomass, hydro, storage
How Drax is helping
Renewable biomass generation and supply chain
Flexible generation to support the energy system
Giving customers control of their energy

BIOMASS HAS AN IMPORTANT ROLE TO PLAY

ENABLING A ZERO CARBON, LOWER COST ENERGY FUTURE
Supports forest growth and health
Commercially managed forestry consumes more CO2 than unmanaged
Supports long-term investment in forest stocks
Opportunity for large-scale carbon negative generation
Committee on Climate Change (CCC)
• Biomass with Carbon Capture and Storage (BECCS) required to deliver UK target
Attractive option subject to appropriate regulatory framework
Growing demand for flexible, low-carbon and renewable energy sources
Biomass is an important source of system stability and security of supply
The only large-scale flexible renewable source of power
Process to reduce biomass cost to <£50/MWh by 2027
“We have assumed overall bio resource 
available to the UK of around 200 TWh… 
…This is equivalent to around 10% of UK 
primary energy consumption in 2050. Of 
this, 173 TWh goes into BECCS in 2050, 
providing 51 MtCO2 of removals.” 
“We previously recommended that the 
first CCS cluster should be in operation 
by 2026, with two clusters by 2030. For a 
net-zero target it is very likely that more 
will be needed”
CCC ‘Net Zero’ Report, May 2019
