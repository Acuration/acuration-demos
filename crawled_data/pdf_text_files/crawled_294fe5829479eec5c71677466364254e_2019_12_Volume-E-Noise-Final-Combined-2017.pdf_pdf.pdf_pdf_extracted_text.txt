Introduction 
1.1 
Background 
1.1.1 
Peter Brett Associates LLP (PBA) has been commissioned to prepare a noise and vibration 
assessment for the Millbrook Power Project ‘the Project’.  
1.1.2 
The Project is for a 299MW gas fired peaking power generation plant within the Rookery South 
Pit, a former clay pit, which is located to the north of Millbrook in Central Bedfordshire.  
1.1.3 
In order to support the noise assessment, two noise surveys have been undertaken. This report 
presents the survey methodology and results of the surveys. 
1.1.4 
Whilst every effort has been made to ensure that this report is easy to understand, it is technical 
in nature. To assist the reader, an explanation of the terminology used in this report is contained 
within Appendix A. 
1.2 
Noise Sensitive Receptors 
1.2.1 
Five noise sensitive receptors (NSR) have been identified in the vicinity of the Project Site. 
These are the closest residential receptors to the Power Generation Plant Site and associated 
construction and decommissioning activities. The NSR’s are summarised in Table 1.1. 
Table 1.1: Description of noise sensitive receptors 
Receptor 
Description 
South Pillinge Farm 
This NSR is located to the west of the Project Site. It is the closest 
NSR to the Power Generation Plant Site and the Electrical 
Connection. It will be affected by the construction, operation and 
decommissioning of the Power Generation Plant, Electrical 
Connection and Gas Connection. 
Pillinge Cottages 
This NSR is located to the south west of the Project Site. Noise 
levels at South Pillinge Farm have been deemed representative of 
the noise levels at Pillinge Cottages due to their close proximity. 
Moreteyne House 
This NSR is located to the south west of the Project Site. Noise 
levels at South Pillinge Farm have been deemed representative of 
the noise levels at Moreteyne House due to their close proximity. 
Lower Farm 
This NSR is located to the south of the Project Site. It is the closest 
NSR to the Above Ground Installation associated with the Gas 
Connection to the National Transmission System. It will be affected 
by the construction and decommissioning of the Gas Connection. 
Manor Farm 
This NSR is located to the east of the Project Site. It is the closest 
NSR to an alternative Gas Connection option which is no longer 
under consideration.

Environmental Sound Sources 
1.3.1 
The Project Site is bound to the east and west by the Midland Main Line and Marston Vale Line 
railways which are a dominant noise source at the NSRs.  
1.3.2 
Additionally, Station Lane, Houghton Lane, Millbrook Road and the B530 dual carriageway pass 
the NSR locations and are deemed to be a dominant source of road traffic noise. 
1.3.3 
The wider road network includes the A421 dual carriageway which runs to the north west of the 
Project Site and the M1 motorway which runs to the south west of the Project Site. 
1.3.4 
Figure 1 shows the indicative locations of the NSR, the railway lines, the existing overhead line,

Methodology 
2.1 
Consultation with Central Bedfordshire Council 
2.1.1 
The Public Protection Officer (PPO) at Central Bedfordshire Council (CBC) agreed (verbally) in 
August 2014 that one noise measurement location at South Pillinge Farm would be sufficient 
for the purposes of the 2014 Preliminary Environmental Information Report (2014 PEIR). 
2.1.2 
The PPO was contacted in November 2014 to confirm the noise survey locations in order to 
support the full noise and vibration assessment.  
2.2 
Baseline Noise Survey – August 2014 
2.2.1 
A baseline noise survey was undertaken between 14 and 18 August 2014 in order to determine 
the ambient and background noise levels at South Pillinge Farm and support the preliminary 
noise assessment included in the 2014 PEIR.  
2.2.2 
An unattended environmental noise measurement was undertaken in the garden of South 
Pillinge Farm. The sound level meter was located approximately 6 m to the north east of the 
farmhouse with the microphone positioned approximately 1.4 m above ground level. The 
approximate location of the sound level meter is shown in Figure 2 and labelled LTA1.  
2.2.3 
A minimum sampling frequency (logging period) of 15 minutes was used for a continuous survey 
period of four days. 
2.2.4 
Table 2.1 provides details of the instrumentation used during the August 2014 survey.

A windshield was fitted over the microphone at all times during the survey period. 
2.2.7 
The weather conditions throughout the measurement period were considered to be suitable for 
environmental noise surveys (overcast with low wind speed). 
2.3 
Baseline Noise Survey – November 2014 
2.3.1 
A further baseline noise survey was undertaken between 21 and 26 November 2014 to 
determine the ambient and background noise levels at the nearest noise sensitive receptors to 
the proposed infrastructure and construction works.

Noise Survey Results 
3.1 
Noise Climate 
South Pillinge Farm – August 2014 
3.1.1 
During the site visits associated with the noise survey undertaken in August 2014, the dominant 
sound sources were deemed to be distant road traffic, and local wildlife and farm animals. 
South Pillinge Farm – November 2014 
3.1.2 
Construction work associated with the low level restoration scheme was underway during the 
November 2014 noise survey at South Pillinge Farm.  
3.1.3 
On Friday 21 November, during commencement of the survey, construction activities were 
being undertaken immediately adjacent to the survey location. Activities included the extraction 
and transportation of materials from the permitted extraction area to the south of the Rookery 
South Pit. At the time of the survey, the northern half of the temporary earth bund had been 
constructed around the Rookery South Pit. The residents of South Pillinge Farm confirmed that 
construction activities are not undertaken over the weekend. 
3.1.4 
The survey was not abandoned due to untypical conditions as evening, night-time and weekend 
measurements were still considered to be recorded under typical conditions (with the exception 
of the heavy rainfall on Sunday 23 November). Historically, noise levels measured during these 
periods are the lowest noise levels. In order to inform the assessment of operational noise, the 
typical measured LA90,15mins background noise levels will be used.  
3.1.5 
In addition, the duration of the LLRS works were expected to extend beyond the timescales of 
the preparation of the ES. 
3.1.6 
As the noise survey results which were measured in August 2014 are considered to have been 
undertaken during typical conditions, these will also be used to inform the assessment of 
operational, construction and decommissioning noise for the ES.   
3.1.7 
On Wednesday 26 November, when the equipment was collected, construction activities were 
being undertaken in the pit areas. Construction noise was considerably quieter compared to the 
commencement of the noise survey. The types of activities being undertaken were unable to be 
identified without access onto the site.  
3.1.8 
During the site visit on Wednesday 26 November, other noise sources noted comprised distant 
road traffic including emergency sirens on local roads, aircraft, trains passing by on the Midland 
Main Line (which were also visible from the survey location), and natural noise sources including 
birdsong and running water from the nearby brook. 
Lower Farm – November 2014 
3.1.9 
The dominant noise sources at Lower Farm were deemed to be road traffic on Houghton Lane 
and train pass bys on the Midland Main Line to the east of the survey location.  
3.1.10 Additionally, distant road traffic was noted with natural noise sources including tree movements 
and birdsong. A number of local businesses operate out of the existing farm buildings to the 
north of the farmhouse which received a mix of HGV and LGV deliveries during site attendance.

Appendix A  
Acoustics Terminology 
Noise 
Ambient Noise 
Total encompassing sound in a given situation at a given time, usually composed of 
sound from many sources far and near. 
Background 
Noise 
In BS 4142 this is defined as the A-weighted sound pressure level that is exceeded by 
the residual sound at the assessment location for 90% of a given time interval, T (LA90,T) 
Daytime 
Extrapolated from BS 8233 as the period 07:00-23:00 hours (as night-time is 23:00-
07:00 hours) or defined in BS 5228-1 as the period 07:00-19:00 hours. 
Decibel (dB) 
A unit of level derived from the logarithm of the ratio between the value of a quantity 
and a reference value. It is used to describe the level of many different quantities.  For 
sound pressure levels the reference quantity is 20 uPa.  The threshold of normal 
hearing is in the region of 0 dB and 140 dB is the threshold of pain. A change of 1 dB 
is only perceptible under controlled conditions. 
LAx 
Denotes use of frequency weighting ‘A’ which differentiates between sounds of 
different frequency (pitch) in a similar way to the human ear.  A weighted 
measurements broadly agree with people’s assessment of loudness. 
Evening 
Defined in BS 5228-1 as the period 19:00-23:00 hours. 
LA10,T 
The A-weighted noise level exceeded for 10% of the measurement period, T.  It gives 
an indication of the upper limit of fluctuating noise such as that from road traffic.  LA10,18h 
is the arithmetic average of the 18 hourly LA10,1h values from 06:00-24:00. 
LA90,T 
The A-weighted noise level exceeded for 90% of the measurement period, T.  This is 
defined in BS 4142 as the background noise level. 
LAeq,T 
The equivalent continuous sound level – the sound level of a notionally steady sound 
having the same energy as a fluctuating sound over a specified measurement period 
(T).  LAeq, T is used to describe many noises and can be measured directly with an 
integrating sound level meter. 
LAmax, 
The highest A-weighted noise level recorded during a noise event.  The time weighting 
(slow or fast) should be stated.  
Night-time 
Defined in BS 8233 and BS 5228-1 as the period 23:00-07:00 hours. 
LOAEL 
Lowest Observed Adverse Effect Level 
SOAEL 
Significant Observed Adverse Effect Level
