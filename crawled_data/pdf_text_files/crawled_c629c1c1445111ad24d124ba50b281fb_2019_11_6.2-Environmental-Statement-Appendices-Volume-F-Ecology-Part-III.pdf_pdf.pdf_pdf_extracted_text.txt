Introduction
1.1
Introduction
1.1.1
AECOM was commissioned to undertake a suite of ecological survey work to
inform the Abergelli Power Project (the “Project”).
1.1.2
The Project Site is located near to the village of Felindre, Swansea, as shown in
Figure 1.1, and the central grid reference for the Site is SN 6528 0143. A full
description of the Project is provided in Chapter 3: Project and Site Description of
the Environmental Statement.
1.1.3
The Preliminary Ecological Appraisal Report (Appendix 8.1) identified that surveys
for otter Lutra lutra and water vole Arvicola amphibius were required at the Project
Site.
1.1.4
This baseline report outlines the presence of otter and water vole within the otter
and water vole survey area and outlines initial recommendations for further
surveys, mitigation and enhancement.
1.1.5
The otter and water vole survey area encompasses all suitable and accessible
watercourses within the Project Site boundary and within a 100 m radius from the
Project Site boundary, as shown on Figure 1.1.
1.1.6
Previous surveys have been undertaken by BSG Ecology and supported the 2014
ES Ecology Chapter which are presented in the ES Appendix 8.14.
1.2
Objectives of the Survey
1.2.1
The objectives of this survey were:
·
To identify any designated nature conservation sites within or in the vicinity of
the Project Site boundary that have the potential to support otter and water
vole;
·
To identify any known records and/or populations of otter or water vole in the
vicinity of the Project Site boundary;
·
To record and map evidence of otter and water vole;
·
To make an initial ecological assessment of the Project Site boundary in
respect to otter and water vole;
·
To highlight any initial potential ecological constraints in respect to otter and
water vole;
·
To outline further survey work that may be required; and,
·
To make initial suggestions for mitigation, compensation and enhancement of
the natural features identified on the within the Project Site boundary in respect
to otter and water vole.

1.3
Legislation
a)
Otter Legislation
1.3.1
Otters are a European Protected Species under The Conservation of Habitats and
Species Regulations 2010 (as amended), known as the ‘Habitats Regulations’,
making it an offence to:
·
deliberately capture, injure or kill an otter;
·
deliberately disturb an otter; and
·
damage or destroy a breeding site or resting place of an otter.
1.3.2
Disturbance is defined as that which is likely to impair their ability:
·
to survive, to breed or reproduce, or to rear or nurture their young, or
·
in the case of animals of a hibernating or migratory species, to hibernate or
migrate; or
·
to affect significantly the local distribution or abundance of the species to which
they belong.
1.3.3
Under the Wildlife and Countryside Act 1981(as amended) it is illegal to:
·
intentionally or recklessly disturb any otter while it is occupying a structure or
place which it uses for shelter or protection;
·
intentionally or recklessly obstructs access to any structure or place used by an
otter for shelter or protection; and,
·
sell, offer or expose for sale any otter.
1.3.4
A Natural Resources Wales licence would be required for any works likely to
constitute an offence in respect to otters.
b)
Water Vole Legislation
1.3.5
The water vole is listed on Schedule 5 of the Wildlife and Countryside Act 1981 (as
amended), for which the following are offences:
·
Intentional killing, injuring or taking;
·
Intentionally or recklessly damaging/destroying a place of shelter/protection;
·
Intentionally or recklessly disturbing an animal in its place of shelter/protection;
·
Intentionally or recklessly obstructing access to its place of shelter/protection;
and,
·
Possession (live or dead, including derivatives), sale and offering for sale.
1.4

1.4.2
All AECOM Ecologists who worked on this Project are members of (at the
appropriate level) the Chartered Institute of Ecology and Environmental
Management (CIEEM) and follow their code of professional conduct (CIEEM, 2013)
when undertaking ecological work.
2.
Methodology
2.1
Desk study
2.1.1
The objective of the desk study is to review the existing information available in the
public domain concerning species and habitats to identify the following:
·
Internationally and nationally designated sites for otter and water vole, up to 2
km from the Site using the Multi Agency Geographic Information for the
Countryside (MAGIC) website (www.magic.gov.uk);
·
Otter and water vole records and records of locally designated sites for otter
and water vole up to 2 km from the Site, using the South East Wales
Biodiversity Records Centre (SEWBReC);
·
The Section 7 list of Principal Importance for Conservation of Biological
Diversity in Wales was reviewed for inclusion of otter and water vole; and,
·
Aerial photographs and Ordnance Survey (OS) maps were reviewed to identify
features of ecological interest surrounding the Site, nearby areas of ecological
interest and features connecting these habitats (hedgerows, watercourses,
railway lines).
2.1.2
The reports of previous surveys undertaken by BSG Ecology were provided by the
client and were reviewed.
2.2
Otter Survey
2.2.1
The Phase 1 Habitat map (Appendix 8.1) and OS mapping were used to identify
watercourses within the Project Site boundary and within a 100 m radius of the
Project Site boundary.
2.2.2
Surveys for otter were conducted by AECOM ecologists on 18 July 2017 under
suitable weather conditions. A detailed visual search of the watercourses within the
otter survey area was undertaken.
2.2.3
Searches for otter activity were undertaken following guidance provided in
Monitoring the otter Lutra lutra (Chanin and Smith, 2003). The survey methodology
involved recording all evidence of otter activity, which is detailed below.
·
Holt entrances – holes characteristically in river banks or under tree roots at
river edges.
·
Couch – typically an above-ground nest-like structure used as a resting place;
·
Footprints – five toes which arch around the front of a large pad. In soft ground
claw marks and webs between toes may show. Often seen in sand or soft mud
deposits along rivers and under river bridges;
·
Otter trails through vegetation – otters use the same routes within their territory
to access rivers, so the paths are usually worn leading down the banks to the
Abergelli ES 2018 – OTTER AND WATER VOLE SURVEY REPORT

6
river and may have a ‘slide’ at the end of well-worn mud as they slide into the
water;
·
Spraint – found in prominent locations adjacent or along a river, for example on
tree stumps, large rocks and ledges under bridges. Sometimes otters may build
a ‘castle’ of soft mud or sand along a river to spraint on top of. Spraints are
made up of clearly visible fish bones and scales, with some other small bones,
fur, feather and insect fragments sometimes present. Fresh spraint is usually
black, tarry and sticky.  It has a distinctive sweet-musky odour, which is not
unpleasant;
·
Anal jelly – a jelly-like secretion that smells strongly of otter and can vary in
colour from pale brown, greenish to amber; and
·
Other signs – for example, occasionally remains of dead otters can be seen on
roads.
2.3
Water Vole Survey
2.3.1
The Phase 1 Habitat map (Appendix 8.1) and OS mapping were used to identify
watercourses within the Project Site boundary and with a 100m radius of the
Project Site boundary.
2.3.2
Surveys for water vole were conducted by AECOM ecologists on two separate
visits on the 28th June 2017 and 29th September 2017. This is to allow for variations
in habitat suitability across the season and because water voles are increasingly
being shown to utilise different areas at different times of year. A detailed visual
search of the watercourses within the water vole survey area was undertaken.
2.3.3
The survey methodology used was in accordance with the Water Vole
Conservation Handbook (Strachan and Moorhouse, 2011). This consisted of
identifying the extent and distribution of water vole through searches of both banks
(where possible) of watercourses for field signs indicating recent activity (i.e.
feeding stations and latrines), as well as signs of past and potentially present
activity (i.e. burrows). Where conditions allowed, a surveyor walked in the
watercourse channel to check for field signs along the water’s edge.
2.3.4
The survey methodology involved recording all evidence of water vole activity,
which is detailed below.
·
Faeces – these are 8 – 12mm long and 4 – 5mm wide, with a smooth ‘tic tac’
like shape, varying in colour from green to black, and odourless with a putty-like
texture;
·
Latrines – found throughout the territory, often comprising a pile of flattened
droppings, with fresh droppings on top, used to mark range boundaries or
favoured spots close to burrows;
·
Feeding stations – comprise a neat pile of chewed feeding remains, often
comprising lengths of vegetation up to 10cm long, showing the marks of the
two large incisors;
·
Burrows – these are typically wider than they are high, with a diameter of 4 –
8cm, and are usually located along the water’s edge;
Abergelli ES 2018 – OTTER AND WATER VOLE SURVEY REPORT

·
Lawns – around burrows there is often an area of grazed vegetation,
surrounded by taller vegetation, these are most often produced when the
female is nursing young;
·
Nests – these comprise a large ball of shredded material, often woven into the
bases of rushes and reeds, and are normally found in areas where the water
table is high, such as wetlands;
·
Footprints – as with other rodents, the footprints of the fore foot, show four toes
in a star arrangement, with the hind foot showing five toes.  The size of
footprints for the hind foot is 26-34mm; and,
·
Runways – these are low tunnels within the vegetation, often adjacent to the
water’s edge; and
2.3.5
The presence of water vole can also be confirmed by sightings and from the
characteristic ‘plop’ of the water vole entering the water, which acts as a warning to
other voles.
2.3.6
Latrines are indicators of territorial behaviour, which in turn generally correlates with
water vole breeding activity. For the presentation of water vole distribution data,
sections of the ditch where latrines were identified would be illustrated as “Breeding
Activity”, and sections of the ditch where evidence other than latrines was identified
would be illustrated as “Non-Breeding Activity”.
2.4
Limitations
2.4.1
Biological records can be received from a wide variety of sources and may or may
not be comprehensive and accurate. However, if assessed in conjunction with a
survey, they can contribute to a robust ecological assessment of a site.
2.4.2
There was heavy rain the night before the second survey on the 29th September
2017 which had the potential to wash away spraint or faeces evidence.
2.4.3
Two watercourses (Afon Llan and a tributary of the Afon Llan) were not accessible
at the time of survey due to dense vegetation obscuring the view of the banks, and
land access permissions. These watercourses were partially viewed and were
assessed as having suitability to support both species. There is potential for signs
of both species to have gone unrecorded.

undertaken by BSG
Ecology
An otter spraint was identified during the previous surveys (ES
Appendix 8.14), the location of which is approximately 500m east
of the Project Site boundary and the watercourse on which it was
found flows through the Project Site.
Holes, that were likely to be mammal burrows, were observed.
The holes have the right dimensions to allow use by water voles
but did not show signs of current occupation. No latrines,
footprints or grazing lawns were observed during the survey (ES
Appendix 8.14).

Conclusions
5.1
Otter
5.1.1
A total of thirteen watercourses within the otter survey area were suitable for
supporting commuting otter and two watercourses were suitable for supporting
foraging otter, holt and couch creation. One potential couch was identified with a
trampled vegetation track leading to it which suggested occasional use by a
mammal. Two mammal tracks were identified; these may have been fox or another
mammal. No spraints, holts, footprints, anal jelly or other signs were identified
during the surveys.
5.1.2
Due to the confirmed presence of otter upstream from the Project Site in 2015 and
the presence of spraints and a footprint from a nearby pond in May 2017 it can be
concluded that otters are still active in the locality. As such it is likely that otters use
the suitable watercourses (numbers 10, 11, 12, 14, 15, 41, 43 and 45) within the
otter survey area and Project Site boundary for occasional forging, commuting,
resting and holt creation (although no evidence of holts was identified during the
survey).
5.2
Water Vole
5.2.1
Four watercourses that had potential for supporting water vole were recorded within
the water vole survey area (15, 43, 46 and 48). Two of these (15 and 45) had
limited potential for water vole due to the relative isolation of these watercourses
within the landscape (i.e. not connected to watercourses with potential to support
water vole). However, it should be noted that some watercourses could not be
adequately surveyed due to dense vegetation and therefore signs may have been
missed. Burrows suitable for water vole were found (watercourses 15 and 43) but
there was no evidence of current occupancy. It was therefore not possible to
determine if the burrows had been excavated by brown rat or water vole. There
were no records of water vole from SEWBReC, and it appears likely that water vole
are absent from the water vole survey area.
5.3
Recommendations
a)
Recommendations for Further Surveys
5.3.1
A full assessment of required further surveys has been made during EcIA and
reported in the ES. At this stage the following recommendations have been made:
·
Due to the time that would have elapsed between the otter and water vole
survey and the proposed construction start date it is recommended that a pre-
construction survey for otters and water voles is undertaken on suitable
watercourses to check for activity or any newly created holts or couches, or
burrows. The survey will focus on watercousres and water bodies likely to be
impatcted by the propsed works.

b)
Recommendations for Mitigation
5.3.2
A full series of recommendations for mitigation at construction and operation has
been undertaken for the EcIA and reported in the S. Further recommendations may
be made as a result of the outcome of the pre-construction survey. At this stage the
following key recommendations have been made:
·
An exclusion area of 100 m will be established around any newly identified otter
holts and resting places prior to works commencing and further advice will be
sought from Natural Resources Wales.
·
An exclusion area of 10 m will be established around any newly identified
owater vole burrows prior to works commencing and further advice will be
sought from Natural Resources Wales.
·
Access to open-water habitats must be safeguarded at all times; effects to
newly identified established otter paths and traditional routes between such
areas (such as field drains) during the construction phase should be minimised.
·
Habitat loss should be compensated – particularly key habitat types for the
species.
·
A buffer should be in place during construction to prevent pollution and/or run
off into the watercourses/water bodies.
c)
Recommendations for Biodiversity Enhancement
5.3.3
A full series of recommendations for biodiversity enhancement has been made
during the EcIA and reported in the ES. Further recommendations may be made as
a result of the outcome of the pre-construction survey. At this stage the following
precautionary recommendations have been made:
·
Habitat restoration or enhancement works.

INTRODUCTION
1.1
Overview
1.1.1
Parsons Brinckerhoff has been commissioned by Abergelli Power Ltd
(ALP) to undertake a BS5837: 2012 “Trees in Relation to Design
Demolition and Construction – recommendations” (BS5837)
arboriculture survey in relation to the proposed 299MW gas-fired
‘peaking’ plant at Abergelli Farm Felindre, near Swansea (hereafter
referred to as ‘the Project’).
1.2
Context
1.2.1
The Arboriculture Survey Report is required in support of an application
for Development Consent as an Appendix to the Environmental
Statement (ES) for the Project.
1.3
Purpose
1.3.1
The purpose of this report is to assess all qualifying trees, groups of
trees, hedges and woodland (individuals with a stem diameter of at
least 75mm measured at 1.5m above ground level) within the survey
areas (identified as “project site” within the Tree Constraints Plan at
appendix D)and those where the Root Protection Areas (RPA) may be
affected by the Project as defined in BS5837
1.3.2
Parsons Brinckerhoff Ltd carried out the BS5837 Arboriculture Survey
between 17th and 19th September 2014 and on 18th November 2014.
1.4
Planning and Legislative Context
1.4.1
This report has been carried out in accordance with the most recently
published (30th April 2012) BS5837 which updates the previous
BS5837 of 2005 by:
· 
Taking account of current practice regarding planning for the
management, protection and planting of trees in the vicinity of
structures, and for the protection of structures near trees;
· 
Updating the guidance in relation to building regulations; and
· 
Recognising the contribution that trees make to climate change
adaptation.
1.4.2
Trees are a material consideration in the UK planning system, and
existing trees are an important factor on construction sites, whether on
or near the working areas. BS 5837 2012 Arboriculture reports are
intended to assist decision-making, by ensuring consideration is given
Abergelli Power BS5837 Arboriculture
Survey Report
Arboriculture Report
Prepared by Parsons Brinckerhoff
November 2014
for Abergelli Power
- 10 -
to existing and proposed trees in the context of design, demolition and
construction.
1.4.3
The primary source of protection afforded to trees is through the
application of Tree Preservation Orders (TPO) as part of the Town and
Country Planning (Tree Preservation) (England) Regulations 2012
which came into effect on April 6th 2012. There are two offences under
this Act:
· 
in contravention of tree preservation regulations: cut down, uproot
or wilfully destroy a protected tree; or to damage, top or lop it
wilfully in such a manner as to be likely to destroy it; or to cause
and permit any such activity; and
· 
to carry out any other works in contravention of tree preservation
regulations.
1.4.4
It has been confirmed that there are no tree preservation orders with
the survey site.
1.4.5
 In recent years greater weight has been added to the protection of
ancient and veteran trees within our landscape. This is reflected in the
recent update to Planning Policy Wales which states “Ancient and Semi
Natural woodlands are irreplaceable habitats of high biodiversity value
which should be protected from development that would result in
significant damage” (paragraph 5.2.9).
1.4.6
 The Forestry Act of 1967 requires any person wishing to fell trees to
apply for a felling licence before those works are undertaken. There are
many exemptions to this requirement that often reflect good forest and
woodland management and other exemptions that may be reasonably
expected such as dead, diseased or dangerous trees. Exemptions are
also afford to works required to facilitate planning consent

METHODOLOGY
2.1
Survey
2.1.1
The trees on the survey site qualifying for survey were inspected and
classified, by a competent arboriculture consultant with regard to
BS5837.  The trees were classified in accordance with BS5837: 2012
tree quality assessment categories A, B, C and U, as set out in Table 1
and 2 of the British Standard. Qualifying trees are defined as individual
trees with a stem diameter of at least 75 mm measured at 1.5 m above
ground level.
2.1.2
All trees within the survey site were inspected from ground level using
the Visual Tree Assessment (VTA) method. VTA assessment is a non-
invasive method for ascertaining the physiological and structural
condition of trees. The method requires the use of a Thor 10 nylon
acoustic mallet, and a wire probe.
2.1.3
The VTA was undertaken on the above ground portion of the trees. No
aerial inspection, sampling, or excavations for the purpose of soil or
root analysis were undertaken. Binoculars were used to inspect the
upper parts of the tree canopy from ground level, if required.
2.1.4
To allow the assessment of trees on site to be completed in a
practicable way and to best reflect the tree population on site, where
trees formed groups either aerodynamically, through mutual support or
by forming a screen or other such feature they have been recorded as
such. This is a widely used method and is supported by Section 4.4.2.3
of BS 5837: 2012.
2.2
Survey Limitations
2.2.1
Trees are large dynamic organisms, influenced by a variety of
environmental variables, whose health and condition can change
rapidly.  Due to the changeable nature of trees and other site and
environmental considerations which may influence the trees, this
report, and any recommendations made within it are valid for a period
of 12 months from the date of the site survey (November 2014).
2.2.2
Although comments and recommendations on the safety of particular
trees may have been made, this survey is not a tree hazard
assessment and should not be used as such.
2.2.3
Any management recommendations have been made in accordance
with BS 3998: 2010 “Tree Works – Recommendations” and industry
best practice. Works have been recommended in accordance with any
statutory obligations owed by the land owners or occupiers.

RESULTS
3.1
Overview
3.1.1
None of the trees within the survey site were found to be of such poor
condition that urgent remedial work was required.
3.1.2
The hedge recorded as part of this survey was not made the subject of
detailed assessment for their importance in relation to the Hedgerow
Regulations.
3.2
Site Context
3.2.1
Many of the trees within the survey site were of reasonable but not
outstanding quality. Due to the relatively low hedges and open field
systems mature trees are locally prominent in the landscape.
3.2.2
The following features were recorded during the survey and recorded in
the Tree Survey Schedule in Appendix A and plotted on the Tree
Constraints Plan in Appendix D:
· 
Woodlands 1 and 2;
· 
Groups 1 to 6;
· 
Hedge 1; and
· 
Trees 922 to 924.
3.2.3
Where access was not possible, trees were listed as A to C. These
trees were not tagged and stem diameters were estimated using
neighbouring trees as a reference.
3.3
Notable Features
3.3.1
Woodland 1 is designated as Ancient Woodland and a Site of
Importance for Nature Conservation (SINC). It is relatively open
woodland with birch as the dominant species in most areas. Many of
the birch trees are in full maturity and will start to decline over the next
20 to 30 years. This is due to the fungal pathogen Piptoporus betulinus
(birch strop fungi) which is dormant in birch trees for most of their life
becoming active when the tree suffers a wound or bark lesion. The
fruiting body of this fungi is clearly visible on many of the birch within
this woodland.  It is important to note that the decline of the birch within
the woodland is not a sign of ill health or poor quality within the
woodland. The decline of the birch will make way for the oak and ash
within the woodland to succeed and form woodland with greater
longevity.

3.3.2
Woodland 2 to the south of the National Grid Access Road is
designated as Ancient Woodland and a SINC. However, it is of
relatively low quality with the oldest individuals within the woodland
being no more than 80 or 90 years old and the majority being under 50
years old. The woodland would benefit from management and creation
of a more structured woodland edge.
3.3.3
The trees to the north of the National Grid Access Road at this location
(within Group 1) are also located within Ancient Woodland and a SINC.
They are of greater quality individually than those within the Woodland
2 and when considered as parts of the hedge form a linear feature
providing connectivity east to west. The existing National Grid Access
Road extends in places to almost 2 m under the saplings, bramble and
leaf litter that has accumulated at the edge of the clear area.
3.3.4
Many of the individual trees on site such as those within groups 5 and 6
have grown from former hedge lines or are formed from outgrown
hedge trees. Browsing by horses has caused bark damage in some
areas.
3.3.5
Groups 3, 4 and 6 will require pruning and in some cases minor felling
to allow construction traffic pass safely without causing damage to the
vehicles or vegetation. Pruning should be carried out in accordance
with Section 154 of the Highway Act 1980 to a height of 5.2m above the
carriage way.  These works are not considered to be a significant
impact.

CONCLUSION
4.1.1
The presence of trees on the Project Site is not considered to be an
obstruction to the Project. Careful consideration of trees at all stages of
the development process will ensure that existing trees of high
retention value are retained and protected throughout the Project.
Suitable mitigation for any tree loss should be designed into the Project
from the outset.
4.1.2
The Tree Constraints Plan (TCP), in Appendix D, will be used as a tool
to inform the Project design, the practicalities of implementing the
Project throughout construction and the final landscaping / mitigation
planting.
4.1.3
Table 1 of BS 5837 (shown in Appendix B) defines Category C trees as
“Trees of low quality with an estimated remaining life expectancy of at
least 10 years, or young trees with a stem diameter below 150mm”.
With this point in mind, Category C trees can potentially be removed if
suitable justification is given and appropriate mitigation provided.
4.1.4
British Standard 5837 provides a specification for protective fencing as
shown in Appendix C. Although this fencing is perfectly suitable for
individual significant trees it is not always practical for large areas of
fencing. With this in mind it is recommended that for large areas
fencing constructed of wooden post and netting with appropriate
signage may be used.

Summary 
1.1 
Abergelli Power Limited (APL) is promoting a new Power Generation Plant on agricultural land 
within Abergelli Farm north of Swansea in the City and County of Swansea (approximately at 
National Grid Reference 265284, 201431).   
1.2 
The Power Generation Plant would operate as a Simple Cycle Gas Turbine (SCGT) peaking plant 
and would be designed to provide an electrical capacity of up to 299 Megawatts (MW).  It would be 
fuelled by natural gas, supplied by a new underground gas pipeline connecting the Power 
Generation Plant to the existing National Grid Gas (NGG) National Transmission System (NTS).   
1.3 
BSG Ecology has been appointed as the ecological consultant to undertake a preliminary 
ecological appraisal, which includes a desk study and Extended Phase 1 Habitat Survey. This 
preliminary survey will inform the subsequent need for further, targeted surveys of protected and 
otherwise notable species and habitats.  
1.4 
The preliminary ecological survey has identified two European designated sites within 10km, five 
statutory designated sites for ecology (four Sites of Special Scientific Interest (SSSIs) and one 
Local Nature Reserve (LNR)) within 5km, and twenty-three non-statutory designated Sites of 
Importance for Nature Conservation (SINC) within 2km of the Survey Site boundary. Three of the 
SINCs are partially within the Survey Site boundary, and a further two are adjacent. Much of the 
woodland on the Survey Site is also designated as Ancient Woodland. Direct impacts on SINCs 
and Ancient Woodland within and close to the Survey Site boundary could occur, depending on the 
final layout of the Power Generation Plant.     
1.5 
Three Section 421 habitats (‘lowland mixed deciduous woodland’, ‘purple moor-grass and rush 
pasture’ and ‘ponds’) are present within the Survey Site.  
1.6 
There is habitat in the Survey Site that has the potential to support European Protected Species 
(EPS) including bats, great crested newts Triturus cristatus, dormouse Muscardinus avellanarius 
and otter Lutra lutra.  There are also habitats suitable for nationally protected species such as 
reptiles and water voles Arvicola amphibius. Information on badgers is contained in a confidential 
version of this report.   
1.7 
The following surveys are recommended to inform the ecology baseline chapter of the 
Environmental Statement and full details are provided in Section 5: 
 
Extended Phase 1 habitat survey of inaccessible land at the south-west end of the Survey Site 
and new land that has been identified since the survey was carried out – an access route to 
the west of the site. 
 
A National Vegetation Classification (NVC) botanical survey of marshy grassland and 
woodland that may be affected within the Survey Site as well as any areas identified as SINCs 
within or adjacent to the site; 
 
A survey of invasive plant species within the Survey Site; 
 
Roped access survey of trees identified as having potential to support bat roosts and internal 
and external building inspections, where trees/buildings may be affected directly or indirectly 
by the Project. Inspection surveys should include surveys for barn owls. Subsequent dusk 
emergence / dawn return to roost surveys should be undertaken if roosting potential or 
evidence of roosting is found; 
 
Bat activity surveys including walked transects and automated bat detector surveys; 
 
A survey for otter and water vole along water courses within the Survey Site; 
 
Dormouse surveys in areas of woodland and scrub within the Survey Site; 
                                                      
1 Species referred to within The Natural Environment and Rural Communities Act 2006 (NERC 2006) as species of 
principal importance for the conservation of biodiversity in Wales which are listed on the Natural Resources Wales 
website. The Welsh Assembly Government must take steps to “further the conservation” of these species under Section 
42 of the NERC ACT 2006.

Introduction 
Site Description 
2.1 
The Phase 1 Habitat Survey Site (hereafter referred to as the ‘Survey Site’), in which the Project 
would be located, consists of approximately 150 ha of pastoral farmland primarily grazed by 
horses. The Survey Site is contained within the red line boundary shown in Figure 1 and is centred 
at National Grid Reference 265284, 201431. The nearest town is Felindre, which is located 
approximately 2 km to the north of the Survey Site, with Swansea approximately 5 km to the south.   
2.2 
The Survey Site is largely agriculturally improved pasture with several areas of marshy grassland, 
particularly in the north, south and north-western ends of the Survey Site. The fields are bounded 
by fences, running along the line of defunct hedgerows, and often accompanied by ditches. There 
is a block of broadleaved woodland on the eastern boundary of the Survey Site and areas around 
the marshy grassland to the west of the Survey Site, and around Felindre Gas Compressor Station 
and the two National Grid 400kV electrical substations that lie at the south-west end of the Survey 
Site.  The habitats in the surrounding landscape are similar to those within the Survey Site 
boundary – a mixture of improved and marshy grassland interspersed with occasional patches of 
woodland. 
2.3 
The Survey Site boundary is shown on Figures 1a, 1b, 2a and 2b (photographs of the Survey Site 
are found in Appendix 2).  
Description of Project 
2.4 
APL is promoting a new Power Generation Plant within Abergelli Farm.  The Power Generation 
Plant would operate as a Simple Cycle Gas Turbine (SCGT) peaking plant and would be designed 
to provide an electrical capacity of up to 299 Megawatts (MW).  It would be fuelled by natural gas, 
supplied by a new underground gas pipeline connecting the thermal generating station to the 
existing National Grid Gas (NGG) National Transmission System (NTS).   
2.5 
BSG Ecology has been appointed as the ecological consultant to undertake a preliminary ecology 
survey, which includes a desk study and Extended Phase 1 Habitat Survey. This preliminary 
ecological survey will inform the subsequent need for further, targeted surveys of protected and 
otherwise notable species and habitats. These baseline surveys will be included in an appendix to 
an ecology chapter of an Environmental Statement, which is presently intended for submission, as 
an integral part of the Development Consent Order (DCO) Application. 
Aims of Study 
2.6 
BSG Ecology was commissioned to undertake a preliminary ecological appraisal of the Survey Site 
within which the Project would be located. The main aims of this report are to: 
 
present the findings of the desk study and site surveys; 
 
assess the potential for the Survey Site to support protected or otherwise notable species; 
 
set out the legislative and/or policy protection afforded to any habitats present or any species 
potentially associated with the Survey Site; and 
 
provide recommendations for any further surveys necessary to inform a subsequent ecology 
chapter for an Environmental Statement for the site.

Methods 
Desk Study 
3.1 
Existing ecological information for the Survey Site and its surrounding area was requested from the 
South East Wales Biodiversity Records Centre (SEWBReC).  Information on European designated 
sites was requested from within 10 km with information on national statutory designated sites was 
requested covering the Survey Site and land up to 5 km from the Survey Site boundary and 
information regarding non-statutory designated sites and records of protected2 or notable species 
(particularly those identified as priority or Section 42 species and/or of local conservation 
importance or LBAP3 species) was requested covering the Survey Site and land up to 2 km from 
the Survey Site boundary. Information on locally designated Sites of Importance for Nature 
Conservation (SINC) within 2 km of the Survey Site boundary was requested from the Swansea 
Council Ecologist. In addition, on-line resources including the Multi Agency Geographic Information 
for the Countryside (MAGIC, www.magic.gov.uk) website and aerial photography of the area were 
also reviewed. 
Field Survey 
Phase 1 Habitat Survey 
3.2 
The initial field survey was undertaken by Anna Gundrey MCIEEM and Matthew Hobbs MCIEEM 
on 24 February 2014. The Project Site boundary and therefore the Survey Site was subsequently 
extended after a design review, and a second field survey was carried out by Stephanie Boocock 
MCIEEM on 14 April 2014 of the additional area. Habitats within the Survey Site, and up to at least 
50m from the Survey Site boundary, were identified and described following standard JNCC Phase 
1 Habitat Survey methodology as detailed in the Phase 1 Habitat Survey Handbook (JNCC, 2010). 
This uses a system of codes to describe different habitat types based on the dominant vegetation 
present, which are recorded by means of habitat maps and target notes. All plant names in this 
report follow The New Flora of British Isles (Stace, 2010). 
3.3 
The survey was extended to give particular consideration to the potential of the habitats present to 
support protected species or species of local conservation importance; recorded as incidental 
information as part of the target notes. 
3.4 
It should be noted that species lists derived from the target notes are not necessarily an exhaustive 
inventory of all species occurring at a site.  They are intended to illustrate the character of habitats 
present, general species richness of a particular area, and draw attention to any species that may 
be considered uncommon or unusual.   
3.5 
Weather conditions during both surveys were clear and largely dry. 
Habitat Suitability Index 
3.6 
During the February field survey a Habitat Suitability Index (HSI) assessment (Oldham et al., 2000) 
of all ponds/water bodies within a 500m radius of the Survey Site (where access was possible) was 
undertaken. In the case of this survey, a wider buffer than 250m was used because of the high 
number of ponds within 250 and 500m of the Survey Site. The additional information collected is 
useful to provide context of how ponds within or in proximity to the Survey Site may connect with 
habitat available for newts in the surrounding landscape, and also to give greater confidence to the 
assessment carried out on each pond.  
3.7 
Information on the physical features and characteristics of each pond were collected in order to 
allow a great crested newt Habitat Suitability Index (HSI) score to be derived for each pond by 
applying the scoring system developed by the Herpetological Conservation Trust (HCT, 2008). The 
suitability index is calculated by allocating scores to features associated with each pond; these

include features such as size, quality of surrounding habitat and presence of fish. These scores are 
then used to calculate the overall HSI for each pond as a number between 0 and 1, with 0 being 
the least suitable and 1 being the most suitable. The HSI score allows each pond to be placed in 
one of five categories defining its suitability for great crested newts as follows: 
 
<0.5  
 
= poor 
 
0.5 – 0.59 
= below average 
 
0.6 – 0.69 
= average 
 
0.7 – 0.79 
= good 
 
>0.8 
 
= excellent 
Tree Assessment 
3.8 
All the trees on site were examined for their potential to support roosting bats, graded according to 
the scale provided in the Bat Conservation Trust survey guidelines (Hundt, 2012), and summarised 
in Table 1 below.  Those that were rated Category 2 and above were described and their locations 
recorded on a GPS.

Limitations to Methods 
3.9 
Although records secured through the desk study and supplied by third parties provide useful 
background information for initial ecological assessment, they often comprise individual records 
supplied by members of the public or are the result of ad hoc surveys. The data trawl information 
can therefore help to inform the likelihood of a particular species being present in the area, but 
should not be relied upon to definitively determine presence or absence of individual species. 
3.10 
The first site visit was undertaken at a sub-optimal time of year (February) for a survey of this type, 
being outside the main growing season, when the greatest variety of plants is in evidence.  
However the habitats on site are readily identifiable to an experienced botanist, and those that 
require further survey work in order to confirm their quality have been identified.  In addition, a 
robust assessment of the Survey Site’s potential to support protected species could also be made. 
Therefore, it is considered that the timing of the survey in this instance is not a significant constraint 
with regard to the findings of this assessment. The second survey on the 14th April was undertaken 
at a time when most plant species are evident and was less constrained in this respect. 
3.11 
Most parts of the Survey Site were accessed and surveyed. Some of the ponds outside of the 
Survey Site could not be accessed (see Figures 2a and 2b) as they were located on private land 
and access was denied to a number of them. Ponds within 250-500m of the Survey Site, where 
accessible, were inspected to gather contextual information and enough have been inspected to 
allow suitable additional background information to be gathered.  
3.12 
The extreme south-west end of the Survey Site could not be surveyed as the land here is in a 
separate ownership and access had not been granted by land owners at the time of survey.  The 
route of the access track (that leads west to the B4489) was added to the Survey Site boundary 
after the April Phase 1 visit, so this was also not included in the survey. A recommendation has 
been made below to survey the remainder of the Survey Site as soon as access has been granted.

Results and Interpretation 
4.1 
In this section the results of the desk study and fieldwork are brought together. The implications of 
these results are then considered.  
4.2 
Figures 1a (the northern part of the site) and 1b (the southern part of the site) illustrate the results

Designated Sites 
Statutory 
4.3 
There are two Special Areas of Conservation (SAC)4 designated under the EC Habitats Directive 
within 10km. One of these, Camarthen Bay and Estuaries SAC, has has been afforded multiple 
designations and is referred to under the umbrella term European Marine Site (EMS)5 which 
comprises the SAC, and is also split into two Special Protection Areas (SPA)6 and two Ramsar 
Wetlands of International Importance (Ramsar)7 the details of each designation are provided 
below. There are also four statutory protected Sites of Special Scientific Interest (SSSI) and one 
Local Nature Reserve (LNR) within 5km of the Survey Site. These are described in Table 2 below.

4 Special Areas of Conservation (SACs) are strictly protected sites designated under the EC Habitats Directive. Article 3 
of the Habitats Directive requires the establishment of a European network of important high-quality conservation sites 
that will make a significant contribution to conserving the 189 habitat types and 788 species identified in Annexes I and II 
of the Directive (as amended). 
5 The term 'European Marine Site' (EMS) (as defined by the Habitats Regulations) refers to those marine areas that area 
both Special Areas of Conservation (SACs) and Special Protection Areas (SPAs). For management advice see 
http://www.severnestuary.net/asera/docs/Regulation%2033%20Advice.pdf 
6 Special Protection Areas (SPAs) are strictly protected sites classified in accordance with Article 4 of the EC Birds 
Directive, which came into force in April 1979. They are classified for rare and vulnerable birds (as listed on Annex I of 
the Directive), and for regularly occurring migratory species. 
7 Ramsar sites are wetlands of international importance designated under the Ramsar Convention.

 Non-statutory 
4.5 
There are 23 Sites of Interest for Nature Conservation (SINC) within 2 km of the Survey Site. 
These are described in Table 3 below and their locations are shown on Figure 3.  Three SINCs lie 
partially within the Survey Site boundary. Rhyd-Y-Pandy Valley Grasslands is a large SINC, which 
includes three fields that lie within the north-east corner of the Survey Site.  Warn Garn Wen is also 
an extensive SINC which includes the marshy grassland that lies within the western boundary of 
the Survey Site.  Llety Morfil SINC is a collection of three areas of ancient woodland  with some 
areas of marshy grassland, that includes the woodland on the eastern boundary of the site and at 
the south-west end of the Survey Site.   
4.6 
There are two SINCs located adjacent to the boundary.  Rhos Fawr SINC is a block of land 
immediately to the north of the Site boundary, and Felindre Grasslands SINC lies adjacent to the 
southern tip of the proposed access route.   
4.7 
Most of the woodland within the Survey Site is also designated as Ancient Woodland (See Figure 
3).

Habitats 
4.8 
The Survey Site is roughly an ‘L’ shape, with the majority of the Survey Site running approximately 
north-south and the foot of the ‘L’ branching off to the south-west around either side of Felindre 
Gas Compressor Station and the two National Grid 400kV electrical substations. The topography 
drains the land to the south with the highest elevation in the Survey Site along the northern 
boundary (approximately 140m above ordnance datum (aod). The land slopes away to the south 
and the lowest elevation is around the Felindre Gas Compressor Station and the two National Grid 
400kV electrical substations (approximately 80m aod). The land is predominantly pastoral 
farmland, mostly agriculturally improved but with significant areas of marshy grassland.  The fields 
are grazed by horses and sheep and are largely bounded by fences with occasional trees, scrub 
and one defunct hedgerow.  There are numerous water courses on site, mostly in the form of 
ditches along field boundaries, but also four streams; one which runs along the eastern boundary 
of the Survey Site; another that runs north-west from the woodland in the eastern part of the site; a 
stream that runs through the marshy grassland to the west; and another around Felindre Gas 
Compressor Station and the two National Grid 400kV electrical substations. There is a small 
woodland on the eastern boundary of the Survey Site and the land around Felindre Gas 
Compressor Station and the two National Grid 400kV electrical substations is also largely wooded. 
There are also copses and stands of mature trees around the edges of the marshy grassland in the 
north-western part of the site, as well as along field boundaries in the northern part of the site. 
Improved grassland 
4.9 
The majority of the land on site is agriculturally improved grassland (Photo 1, 2a).  This was all 
grazed short when surveyed, and consists of abundant perennial rye-grass Lolium perenne, and 
varying quantities of common grassland herbs such as white clover Trifolium repens, common 
mouse ear Cerastium fontanum, and dandelion Taraxacum fontanum agg.   
Marshy grassland 
4.10 
There are marshy grassland fields at TN3, TN3a, TN4a, TN5, TN9a, TN13a and TN21a and a 
block of marshy grassland at the southern end of the Survey Site.  Although all fit within the same 
Phase 1 category, the habitats in these fields vary across the Survey Site.  The field at TN3 (Photo 
2) had a short, close-grazed sward when surveyed.  It has numerous tussocks of soft rush Juncus 
effusus and frequent sedge species.  These include common sedge Carex.nigra and glaucous 
sedge C. flacca.  Other species noted include creeping bent Agrostis stolonifera, a cinquefoil 
Potentilla sp., creeping buttercup Ranunculus repens and sharp-flowered and/or jointed rush 
Juncus actutiflorus / J. articulatus.  
4.11 
The field at TN5 (Photo 3) was also grazed extremely short, when surveyed, to the point where 
individual species are difficult to distinguish.  Soft rush is frequent, along with purple-moor grass 
Molinia caerulea, sheep’s fescue Festuca ovina and a sedge species (not possible to identify to 
 
Abergelli Power Project - Phase 1 survey report

18/06/2014 
species level).  Heather Calluna vulgaris and bilberry Vaccinium myrtillus plants are occasional and 
there are patches of sphagnum moss Sphagnum sp. present. 
4.12 
The fields marked TN3a, TN4a and TN13a, are wet semi-improved grassland, with marshy species 
such as lesser spearwort Ranunculus flammula, sedges, soft rush and water figwort Scrophularia 
aquatica. 
4.13 
The fields marked TN20 all have over 25% soft rush which places them in the ‘marshy grassland’ 
category, but the intervening grassland is agriculturally improved, with abundant perennial rye-
grass and frequent white clover.  The fields marked TN21 and TN22 (Photo 4) have a much higher 
cover of soft rush - approximately 75% in TN21 and 100% in TN22 and intervening species are 
more typical of wet grassland, such as creeping bent Agrostis stolonifera, creeping buttercup and 
Yorkshire fog Holcus lanatus.   
4.14 
Areas of purple-moor grass dominated vegetation, which also falls into the ‘marshy grassland’ 
category are present at TN14 (Photo 5), TN9a and TN21a where the purple moor grass is 
dominant with very occasional cross-leaved heath Erica tetralix and heather plants in evidence and 
scattered willow Salix sp. scrub. At TN9a additional species recorded include soft rush, bracken, 
common haircap moss Polytrichum commune, unidentified sphagnum moss, heather, cross-leaved 
heath and bilberry along the margins with some birch and willow regeneration in small scattered 
copses. TN21a (Photo 4a) is a large field which is superficially similar to that at TN9a but appears 
to have been managed.   Purple moor-grass is not as dominant with numerous patches of bare 
earth and young ling and cross-leaved heath plants.  In addition hare’s-tail cotton grass Eriphorum 
vaginatum, (Photo 1a) deergrass Trichophorum germanicum and lousewort Pedicularis sp. are 
common. 
Semi-improved Grassland 
4.15 
The field to the south of the woodland at TN10 appears to be slightly less agriculturally improved, 
having a lower cover of perennial rye-grass, and a wider range of grasses such as Yorkshire fog, 
crested dog’s tail Cynosurus cristatus and creeping and common bent Agrostis capillaris.  The field 
is nevertheless species-poor. There are also two species-poor semi-improved fields in the north-
east corner of the site (TN3a, TN13a, Photo 3a). 
Woodland and scrub 
4.16 
There is a block of broadleaved woodland along the eastern boundary of the Survey Site at TN10.  
The western end is on a hill, and is dry with widely-spaced trees and a grazed grassland ground 
flora including species such as Yorkshire fog, common mouse-ear and creeping buttercup.  The 
trees here are small to medium-stemmed with very little understory, and include birch Betula 
pendula, crab-apple Malus sylvestris, holly Ilex aquifolium and pedunculate oak Quercus robur.  
The hill slopes down steeply to the east, where a stream delineates a lower, wetter area of 
woodland.  Here the tree species composition is similar but the understorey is much thicker with 
bramble predominating.  On wetter areas, where the bramble thins out, carpets of opposite-leaved 
golden-saxifrage Chrysosplenium oppositifolium are present.  There are also extensive areas of 
purple moor-grass dominated ground flora with sphagnum moss species also present. 
4.17 
To the north of this woodland there is a thin strip of deciduous woodland running along the banks of 
a stream running north to south at TN42. The species composition includes occasional birch, 
willow, ash and holly. There is an understory made up largely of gorse with bramble scrub and soft 
rush grading into improved grassland to the east.   
4.18 
Another relatively extensive area of broad-leaved woodland is present at the south-west end of the 
Survey Site around Felindre Gas Compressor Station and the two National Grid 400kV electrical 
substations.  This forms a strip to the south and a more continuous block to the north of Felindre 
Gas Compressor Station and the two National Grid 400kV electrical substations. The woodland is 
generally quite wet, with alder Alnus glutinous and willow species frequent along with pedunculate 
oak, birch and holly.  The trees are growing close together and are generally small-stemmed and 
straggly.  The understorey is dense bramble and ground flora was largely absent when surveyed, 
although where the woodland opens out, for example around the margins of Felindre Gas 
Compressor Station and the two National Grid 400kV electrical substations, soft-rush dominated 
marshy grassland is present. 
 
Abergelli Power Project - Phase 1 survey report 
 
11 
18/06/2014 
4.19 
There are also patches of deciduous woodland around the edges of the marshy grassland on the 
block of land to the west of the road that runs through the Survey Site. At TN6a there is a small 
wooded spur with tree species including oak, birch, holly, hawthorn and an understorey dominated 
by brambles and including ivy Hedera helix, creeping bent, Yorkshire fog, soft rush, hard fern 
Blechnum spicant, scaly male fern Dryopteris affinis, and bracken Pteridium aquilinum.  AtTN23a 
there is a wooded copse comprised of young birch and willow with an understorey of bramble 
scrub.  The ground flora incudes nettle, lady fern Athyrium filix-femina, scaly male fern Dryopteris 
affinis and wood false brome Brachypodium sylvaticum. A continuous area of scrub is present to 
the south of the woodland at TN10 and around the pond at TN15.  These areas are quite wet and 
include willow species (including grey and goat willow Salix cinerea, S. caprea), alder and bramble.  
At TN15 the scrub merges into stands of purple moor grass that are present around the pond. 
There are also blocks of scrub to the south of Abergelli Farm, along the stream that runs along the 
eastern boundary, at the northernmost point of the Survey Site, and within the marshy grassland to 
the west.  Scattered scrub (mostly common gorse Ulex europaeus) is present along some fence 
lines, and there is a bramble scrub-covered bund at TN4.   
4.20 
Many of the trees within the Survey Site are along site boundaries and are remnant hedgerow 
stools, as described in the section below. 
Boundary features 
4.21 
All boundaries on site are fences, except one length of species-poor hedgerow running north of 
Abergelli Farm.  The fences often run along the line of defunct hedges (Photo 1).  These generally 
take the form of a degraded stone-faced hedge banks, with occasional small sections of overgrown 
hedge.  The overgrown hedges include mature standard trees, large coppice stools and clumps of 
bramble and gorse scrub.  Species present include pedunculate oak, holly, birch, ash Fraxinus 
excelsior, hazel Corylus avellana and hawthorn Crataegus monogyna. 
4.22 
Some of the fields on site have overgrown margins where the vegetation is less trampled and 
grazed along the fence line.  For example the northern boundary of the improved field to the north 
of the field marked TN3 has a ditch lined with purple moor-grass and gorse, and further east along 
this boundary fence bracken is frequent.  The western boundary of the field marked TN22 has 
purple moor-grass and heather growing along the fence.   
Water Courses 
4.23 
There are numerous small water courses within the Survey Site.  These are mostly ditches along 
field boundaries (TN22a, Photo 5a), but there is also some larger streams. The block of marshy 
grassland to the west is criss-crossed by numerous ditches, which were largely dry or with marshy 
bases when visited in April.  There is also a stream that runs through this block of land – this is 
shaded by flanking woodland, with a stone bed and shallow banks.  Another stream (Photos 8, 9 
and 6a) runs south-east through the Survey Site and splits into smaller tributaries through the 
woodland at TN10. There are also small watercourses present around the margin of Felindre Gas 
Compressor Station and the two National Grid 400kV electrical substations.  All features that were 
visited in February had flowing water, reflecting a period of prolonged wet weather preceding the 
survey. Aquatic vegetation is not apparent in any of the water courses, but marginal vegetation 
includes frequent soft rush, occasional purple moor-grass and scattered gorse and bramble.   
Water Bodies 
4.24 
There are four water bodies within the Survey Site. The pond at TN15 (Pond17 – see 4.39) is 
approximately 10m in diameter, shallow, and completely covered in an unidentified sedge species.  
It has a small tree-covered island in the centre.  The pond is ringed by small willow and alder trees.  
The surrounding vegetation is dominated by purple moor-grass with occasional heather and cross-
leaved heath plants, with densely growing small trees and scrub (grey willow, bramble and alder).  
A small pond immediately to the south is shown on OS maps.  This was not apparent amongst the 
scrub, but there were small patches of standing water (including wheel ruts) within purple moor 
grass in this area. 
4.25 
A small pond is present at TN19 (P18 – see 4.39) adjacent to an electricity pylon.  The pond is 
approximately circular and 5m in diameter.  It is in woodland and completely surrounded by small 
saplings.  There was no evidence of marginal or emergent aquatic vegetation when surveyed. 
 
Abergelli Power Project - Phase 1 survey report 
 
12 
18/06/2014 
4.26 
Two ponds are also present immediately to the west of TN30a (Ponds 11 and 12).  Pond 12 is 
approximately 10m in diameter, open and unshaded with both aquatic and marginal vegetation 
present.  It appears to be an extension of two field drains that meet at this point.  Pond 11 is a 
small wet depression containing no vegetation. 
Invasive Species 
4.27 
Japanese knotweed Fallopia japonica was noted on at least two locations on the block of land to 
the west of the road that runs through the site.  At Target Note 15a several stands of the species 
were noted on an embankment to a large raised area.  At Target Note 18a a stand of the species 
was noted on a bend in the stream. There are also several stands of this species growing on the 
edge of the road that leads into Abergelli Farm from the west. These extend just beyond the 
western site boundary and into the Survey Site. 
4.28 
Himalayan balsam Impatiens glandulifera was also noted in two areas.  Abundant seedlings of the 
species were noted in the wooded copse at Target Note 23a and on an area of deciduous 
woodland at Target Note 28a.  
Protected Species and Species of Conservation Importance 
4.29 
This section presents the protected species records provided by SEWBReC along with any 
evidence of the species, or potential for it to be present gathered during the field survey.  Where 
relevant it also evaluates the potential for the Survey Site to support Section 42 species identified 
within the desk study area.  The legislation and policy relevant to each species or species group is 
described in Appendix 6. 
Bats 
4.30 
There were 126 bat records provided by SEWBREC from the 2 km radius search area. Of these 
the majority were recorded during bat transects carried out to inform a separate unrelated 
development proposal, named ‘Felindre development site in the records’ approximately 1 km to the 
south west of the Survey Site boundary.  
4.31 
The bat species recorded from the desk study include brown long-eared bat Plecotus auritus, 
common pipistrelle Pipistrellus pipistrellus, Natterer’s bat Myotis nattereri, noctule Nyctalus noctula, 
and whiskered bat Myotis mystacinus. There were also unidentified Pipistrellus sp. and records 
where the bat species was not specified. 
4.32 
There are four bat roosts amongst the records provided. The closest of these is a record of 50 
unspecified bat species 1.8 km to the south-east of the Survey Site at Ynystawe, Swansea from 
1992.  The next closest is a night / feeding roost of an unspecified species 1.9 km south west of the 
Survey Site boundary in Tredegar-Fawr farm buildings from 1998. A record of a roost of 87 
whiskered bats also comes from approximately 1.9 km to the north west of the Survey Site 
boundary in Felindre, Swansea from 1993. The fourth record is a roost of 70 bats of unspecified 
species, 2.5 km to the south east of the Survey Site in Ynysforgan, Swansea from 1993.   
4.33 
There are a number of buildings associated with Abergelli Farm that fall within the Survey Site.  
These are all situated along the road that runs between the Water Treatment Works to the north of 
the Survey Site and Felindre Gas Compressor Station and the two National Grid 400kV electrical 
substations to the south.   Abergelli Farm consists of a rendered brick-built building (Photo 26) with 
a tiled pitched roof.  It has overhanging eaves with wooden soffits.  The associated stable block 
(Photo 27) is of the same construction with an ‘L’-shaped footprint.  Opportunities for roosting bats 
are fairly limited as the buildings appear to be in good condition, although gaps in the woodwork 
around the eaves would allow entry into the soffits. 
4.34 
At TN4 is a small concrete bunker (Photo 31) within an area of waste land.  It is formed of 2 m high 
brick walls with a flat roof formed from concrete sleepers.  There is an open doorway on the south 
elevation and a 30 cm x 30 cm hole at the top of the west-facing wall.  This has some potential to 
support roosting bats. 
4.35 
Immediately to the north (Photo 29) and south (Photo 28) of Abergelli Farm are large barns 
constructed of corrugated metal and asbestos.  Potential for roosting bats in these buildings is low.   
 
Abergelli Power Project - Phase 1 survey report 
 
13 
18/06/2014 
There are also two brick-built sheds with corrugated metal/asbestos pitched roofs (Photo 30) 
adjacent to the northern barn which may have greater potential to support bats, having some gaps 
in the brickwork that could allow entry in to the buildings. 
4.36 
Further south, to the south of TN25a, is a pair of houses set within plots of hard-standing and 
amenity grassland.  These are newly built and in good condition with no opportunities for roosting 
bats. 
4.37 
There are 21 trees on or within 50 m of the Survey Site that have the potential to support roosting 
bats.  Of these two have been classed as Category 1 (with definite suitable features that may 
support larger roosts of bats – see Table 1), and the remainder are Category 2 (with some limited 
roost features – see Table 1).  The locations of the trees (T1-21) are illustrated in Figures 2a and

4.38 
The northern end of the Survey Site offers limited foraging and commuting potential for bats.  The 
boundaries are fences and short sections of remnant hedgerows and the fields are closely grazed.  
The block of marshy grassland, woodland and scrub to the west of the road that runs through the 
Survey Site, and the wooded stream that runs along the eastern boundary offer more potential, and 
both areas have good wooded connections with a network of hedgerows, tree-lines and marshy 
pastures off-site.  The damp wooded area around Felindre Gas Compressor Station and the two 
National Grid 400kV electrical substations at the south-west end of the Survey Site also offers 
foraging potential and connects to off-site blocks of woodland to the north and south that may be 
good habitat for bats. 
4.39 
It is concluded that the Survey Site is likely to have moderate value for bats.  There are a few 
potential roosting opportunities, and some  areas (woodland and marshy grassland) of the Survey 
Site which offer foraging opportunities, but the Survey Site as a whole does not have good linear 
commuting features and the majority of the habitats (tightly grazed improved grassland) are of low 
foraging value. 
Great crested newt  
4.40 
There were no records for great crested newts provided by SEWBREC within 2 km of the Survey 
Site. 
4.41 
Nineteen ponds have been identified within 500 m of the Survey Site boundary with the aid of aerial 
photographs and OS maps.  Of these, two were identified within the Survey Site boundary (Pond 
17 turned out to be a single pond when surveyed) and eight within 250 m of the Survey Site. An 
additional two on-site ponds (Ponds 11 and 12) were found during a reptile survey on 21 May 2014 
in the marshy grassland in the north-west of the Survey Site that had not previously been seen 
during any other survey, as well as one within 100 m of the Survey Site boundary during the first 
February Phase 1 survey (Pond 18). An HSI assessment was carried out on the seven ponds that 
were accessible within 500 m of the Survey Site boundary during the first Phase 1 survey visit.  
This included the two on-site ponds (P17 and P18); one pond within 100 m of the Survey Site 
boundary (P16); and the remainder are those ponds within 500 m of the Survey Site boundary for 
which access was possible (P07, P08, P09 and P10). Figures 2a and 2b shows which ponds were 
surveyed and which were inaccessible, either on private land or not accessible given the presence 
of horses8. 
4.42 
Table 4 below summarises the results of the HSI, and Appendix 4 gives more detailed results.

4.43 
The Survey Site lies in a part of the country where the distribution of great crested nested newts is 
patchy, with the species largely absent to the west of the Survey Site. Whilst this might reduce the 
probability that great crested newts would be present on site, it does not rule out their presence.  
There are a number of ponds in and around the Survey Site, and suitable habitat for newts in their 
terrestrial phase, including old hedge banks, marshy grassland and woodland within the Survey 
Site.  Those ponds surveyed, whilst most did not have a ‘good’ or ‘excellent’ HSI score, do have 
potential to provide breeding habitat for great crested newts and the possible presence of the 
species on site should be considered further. In addition the cluster of inaccessible ponds within 
the grounds of the water treatment works (to the north-west of the Survey Site) are likely to be of 
similar ‘good’ quality as Pond 08 (which was visible through the gate). 
 
Dormouse 
4.44 
SEWBReC did not provide any records of dormouse Muscardinus avellanarius. The woodland 
areas on the eastern boundary, at the south-west end and within the marshy grassland in the 
north-west of the Survey Site do not provide optimum dormouse habitat although they are suitable 
for the species. Most of the woodland consists of relatively immature trees with little hazel 
understorey, limited foraging opportunities for this species and a lack of connectivity in the canopy. 
However, these areas of woodland have good connections to a complex of woodland and thick 
hedgerows to the west, south and east, and consequently could potentially form part of a wider 
network of dormouse-supporting habitat. There are a number of recent examples of dormouse 
occurring in sub-optimal habitat, such as coniferous plantation and species-poor hedges, in south 
and mid-Wales and their presence should not be ruled out if the habitat is sub-optimal but still has 
clear potential to support the species, as in this case. 
4.45 
Figures 2a and 2b illustrate which areas of the Survey Site have the highest potential to support 
dormouse. 
Otter 
4.46 
There are a number of water courses on site, most of which are ditches, but also a small stream 
running from north-west to south-east along the centre and eastern flank of the Survey Site and 
through the woodland in the centre of the Survey Site.  SEWBReC provided 32 records of otter 
within the 2 km search radius, all recorded between 1991 and 2013. The closest record to the 
Survey Site is 0.5 km to the south west from the River Llan.  At its closest point the River Llan is 
approximately 0.3 km south of the southern Survey Site boundary, and it links to the Survey Site 
via the stream running through the woodland in the centre of the Survey Site.  None of the water 
courses on site are likely to provide good foraging opportunities because of their size, but they may 
offer lying up sites for otter, and it is possible that individuals might use the water courses to 
commute along from time to time. 
Water Vole 
4.47 
No evidence of water voles was noted along the water courses on site when surveyed in February 
and April, although February is a time of low activity for the species, when field signs may not be 
evident.  The water courses that were visited in February all had flowing water in them when 
 
Abergelli Power Project - Phase 1 survey report 
 
15 
18/06/2014 
surveyed, following a prolonged period of extremely wet weather during the winter.  It is likely that 
many of these are usually dry or hold only a small amount of water and this was confirmed during 
the April survey. As such they do not provide good habitat for water voles. The stream that runs 
along the eastern boundary of the site; however, does provide suitable habitat for water vole, 
particularly at TN41-43. At TN43, a number of vole tunnels and holes were seen along the western 
side of the bank in long tussocks of grass, although it was not possible to ascertain which species 
had made them.   
4.48 
Water voles have been present in the vicinity: SEWBReC provided three records of water vole from 
the River Llan approximately 1.9 km from the Survey Site boundary, all from 1996.  This River is 
hydrologically linked to the Survey Site (see otter section above), so it is possible, if any of the 
water courses retain water, particularly those linked to the River Llan, that water voles could be 
present on site.  
Reptiles 
4.49 
There were 12 records of reptiles provided by SEWBReC, between 1998 and 2010. These 
included records of all the common reptile species: adder Vipera berus, grass snake Natrix natrix, 
common lizard Zootoca vivipara, and slow worm Anguis fragilis. The closest record is of a common 
lizard, approximately 0.8 km to the west of the Survey Site boundary. Most records are from the 
south-west side of tinplate workings near to Bryn Whilach Farm, approximately 1 km to the 
southwest of the Survey Site boundary. 
4.50 
There are several areas of the Survey Site that provide suitable habitat for common reptile species 
(see Figures 2a and 2b).  This includes areas of marshy grassland to the south of the Survey Site, 
mounds of wood to the south of the woodland at TN10 (Photo 11), scrubby woodland fringes 
(Photo 12) and overgrown field margins either along remnant hedge banks or ditch banks. In 
addition a common lizard was seen during the April Phase 1 survey in the marshy grassland area 
in the north-west of the site and this area is particularly suitable for reptiles providing high quality 
habitat for foraging, sheltering and basking. 
Badger 
4.51 
Information on badgers is provided in a confidential version of this report. 
Birds 
4.52 
During the Phase 1 survey a number of common woodland and farmland bird species were 
recorded and these are listed in Appendix 5. The trees and woodland on site may provide nesting 
habitat for a range of common bird species.  The marshy grassland on site could also provide 
nesting habitat for ground-nesting bird species. The Survey Site does not appear to be of particular 
importance for wintering birds with no notable aggregations of common species or any rarer 
species recorded during the walkover survey, except for a red kite Milvus milvus seen in flight over 
the Survey Site (see below) in both February and April.  
4.53 
SEWBReC provided a number of records of ground nesting birds in the search area.  These 
included records for Eurasian curlew Numenius arquata, northern lapwing Vanellus vanellus and 
skylark Alauda arvensis. The closest of these records are located at the tinplate workings site near 
to Bryn Whilach Farm, approximately 1 km to the southwest of the Survey Site boundary.  There 
was one record of curlew, located at the Lliw reservoir, 1 km north of the Survey Site boundary.  
 
Schedule 1 Birds 
4.54 
SEWBReC provided 21 records of barn owl Tyto alba. The closest of these records is 0.7 km to the 
west of the Survey Site boundary from 1997, with the nearest breeding record 3 km to the south 
west near Penllergaer Woods in 2000.  It is possible that some of the farm buildings within the 
Survey Site may support breeding barn owl, although no trees were found that appear, from a 
ground level inspection, to have sufficiently large cavities to support nesting barn owls. The marshy 
fields at the southern end of the Survey Site, although probably sub-optimal, could provide habitat 
for field vole Microtus agrestis (a preferred prey species) given the thick, tussocky structure of 
some parts of the sward. The marshy grassland in the north-west of the Survey Site provides 
 
Abergelli Power Project - Phase 1 survey report 
 
16 
18/06/2014 
optimal foraging habitat for barn owls due to its extensive areas of tussocky grassland that may 
support breeding field voles Microtus agrestis, their preferred prey species. 
4.55 
A red kite was noted circling above the field at TN3 and also over Abergelli Farm.  Red kites 
generally breed in valley woodlands of which there is extensive habitat to 2-3 km to the east and 
west of the Survey Site.  It is considered likely that the Survey Site is part of a much wider area of 
potential foraging habitat for the species. SEWBReC provided 54 records for red kite between 1999 
and 2013. 
Terrestrial Invertebrates 
4.1 
SEWBReC provided 40 records of Section 42 terrestrial invertebrate species. The species 
recorded are marsh fritillary, dingy skipper Erynnis tages, narrow-bordered bee hawk-moth 
Hemaris tityus, and small pearl-bordered fritillary Boloria selene. Twenty-nine of the records are of 
marsh fritillary; the closest of these is located approximately 0.7 km west of the Survey Site 
boundary in 2009. This location also contains the closest of the four dingy skipper records, as well 
as the closest of the five small pearl-bordered fritillary records and the only narrow-bordered bee 
hawk-moth record. 
4.2 
The marshy grassland to the west provides suitable habitat for marsh fritillaries, although the food 
plant devil’s-bit scabious Succisa pratensis was not noted in any quantity during the April survey.  
Of the other Section 42 species recorded from the desk study, suitable habitat is present for 
narrow-bordered bee hawk-moth Hemaris tityus, which largely relies on devil’s bit scabious, like 
marsh fritillary. For dingy skipper, there are few areas of bare ground, where this species prefers to 
bask and no areas where its usual food plant, bird’s foot trefoil Lotus corniculatus, is found in any 
quantity. Small pearl-bordered fritillary is reliant on violets (Viola spp.) as its foodplant and violets 
have not been recorded during either Phase 1 survey (the April survey was well timed to record 
them in flower).  It is unlikely that either of these latter two species is present.  
4.3 
Other habitats that may be suitable for diverse assemblages of terrestrial invertebrates include the 
areas of broad-leaved ancient woodland at Target Note 10, for example, which represents a fairly 
extensive area of semi-natural habitat that may be important for terrestrial invertebrates, 
particularly Lepidoptera (notably moths) and beetles (Coleoptera); which are both strongly 
represented in wooded habitats.   
Aquatic Invertebrates 
4.4 
No records of Section 42 aquatic invertebrate species were provided by SEWBReC, and it is 
unlikely that any of the ponds on or close to the site support unusual or diverse assemblages of 
aquatic invertebrates.

Recommendations 
5.1 
For the purposes of this report it has been assumed at this stage that direct impacts will potentially 
occur across the Survey Site, and that indirect impacts will need to be considered beyond this, 
within the ‘zone of influence’ that will vary dependent on the receptor (habitat, protected species, 
designated site) concerned.  The recommendations presented below are based on preliminary 
assumptions of the potential impacts and the corresponding requirement to confirm presence / 
absence, and where present the distribution and abundance of protected and otherwise notable 
species or habitats that may occur within the Survey Site and a zone of influence surrounding it. 
Statutory Designated Sites  
5.2 
Nant Y Crimp SSSI, Penplas Grasslands SSSI and Cadle Heath LNR are located within 5 km of the 
Survey Site boundary. These sites are designated for their habitat interest and as all are over 2 km 
from the Survey Site, direct impacts resulting from the development are considered unlikely.  Nant 
Y Crimp SSSI also has a colony of marsh fritillary butterflies. The larval food plant (devil’s-bit 
scabious) for this species was found in small patches in the western area of marshy grassland 
during the Phase 1 survey, so this species may be present.  However this assessment will need to 
be reviewed once a botanical survey (see below) of the western block of marshy grassland has 
been carried out.  
 
Habitat Regulations Assessment 
5.3 
Consultation with the Planning Authority, Natural Resources Wales and PINS will determine the 
requirement for a screening exercise (under the Habitat Regulations) that considers the proximity 
of potentially sensitive ecological receptors (notably European protected sites, but potentially 
extended to SSSIs) within a search area that may extend to or beyond a 5 km radius of the Survey 
Site (for example, Camarthen Bay and Estuary SAC, Crymlyn Bog SAC, SPA and Ramsar, and 
Burry Inlet SPA and Ramsar all lie within 10 km of the Survey Site), and whether these could be 
affected by CO, NOX and NO2 emissions as well as nitrogen and acid deposition. 
5.4 
The requirement for further surveys or desk based investigation will be determined following review 
of the scoping opinion (and consultation) on this matter. 
Non-statutory Designated Sites  
5.5 
Three SINCs lie partially within the site boundary and could therefore be directly affected by the 
proposed development.  Indirect impacts could also potentially occur on those sites lying adjacent 
or close to the boundary.   
5.6 
The woodland on site that falls within Llety-Morfil SINC and the southern part of Waun Garn Wen 
SINC is also designated as Ancient Woodland and as such is irreplaceable.  Direct impacts on this 
resource may therefore also occur as a result of the proposals. 
Habitats 
5.7 
The marshy grasslands within the Survey Site potentially qualify as a Section 42 habitat ‘purple 
moor-grass and rush pastures’.  The area to the west of Abergelli Farm is also a SINC.  These 
habitats require a NVC botanical survey at an appropriate time of year (June/July) to establish their 
ecological value and inform the level of mitigation required to compensate if they are to be lost or 
modified as a consequence of the Project. The marshy grassland in the north-west of the site is 
potentially of high ecological value, and this needs to be confirmed through botanical and other 
Phase 2 survey work.  The semi-improved grasslands in the north-east corner of the site, whilst not 
having obvious high botanical value, are included within a larger SINC.  As such it is recommended 
that a botanical survey is carried out on these areas to establish their value in the wider context of 
the SINC, and therefore the likely mitigation that would be required for their loss. 
5.8 
‘Lowland mixed deciduous woodland’ is also a Section 42 habitat. The woodland on site all falls 
into this category and the majority of the resource also falls within a SINC and is designated as 
 
Abergelli Power Project - Phase 1 survey report 
 
18 
18/06/2014 
Ancient Woodland.  A botanical survey of these areas in spring/early summer when the ground 
flora is in evidence would allow an evaluation of their ecological value to be made.  
5.9 
There are no other habitats on site of high intrinsic ecological value.  The improved grassland 
habitat is common and widespread in south Wales and of minimal ecological value. In addition, all 
(bar one species poor example) of the hedgerows on the Survey Site are defunct. 
Invasive species 
5.10 
Japanese knotweed and Himalayan balsam have both been noted on the Survey Site.  It is 
recommended that a walkover survey of the Survey Site is carried out once access is available to 
all areas, including the proposed access route to map all locations where these species are 
growing.  This should be done within the period June - July when both species are most in 
evidence.  
5.11 
If work is to take place in any areas where these species are present, a Management Plan will 
need to be drawn up detailing the methods that will be used to remove these species under 
controlled conditions as detailed by the Environment Agency (The Knotweed Code of Practice 
2003 and guidance on Environment Agency website). 
Protected Species and Species of Conservation Importance 
Bats 
Trees and Buildings 
5.12 
Twenty one trees within the Survey Site have been identified as having potential to support 
roosting bats.  If these trees are to be removed or modified, it is recommended that a roped-access 
tree survey is carried out in order to confirm whether any of the features initially identified support 
roosting bats or have the potential to do so.  Where the potential for bats to roost in the tree is 
confirmed then emergence/re-entry (at dusk and/or dawn) survey may need to be carried out to 
confirm the likely use of the tree by roosting bats, and the status of any roost present. If a bat roost 
is confirmed, either through emergence/re-entry survey or through roped-access survey a 
European Protected Species (EPS) Licence is likely to be required before the tree can be felled.  
5.13 
It is recommended that all buildings to be directly or indirectly affected by the Project (if any) should 
be inspected for signs of roosting bats and features with the potential to support roosting bats, 
where access allows. 
5.14 
If signs of roosting bats or features with the potential to be used by roosting bats are identified 
during these inspection surveys, further survey in the form of dusk emergence/ dawn re-entry 
surveys may be required. The level of survey effort required will depend on the potential that the 
building or tree has been assigned in these initial inspection surveys. These further surveys (if 
required) should be undertaken in accordance with current best practice guidance (Hundt, 2012) at 
a time of year when breeding roosts may be present (i.e. between mid-May and mid-August). 
Activity Survey 
5.15 
The areas of marshy grassland, woodland and streams on site potentially provide good foraging 
habitat for bats.  It is recommended that bat activity surveys are carried out in order to inform an 
assessment of the Survey Site’s value for bats and to guide the evolution of the Project and 
mitigation accordingly.  Following the guidance provided in Hundt (2012), this would involve two 
walked transect routes (given the size of the Survey Site) carried out monthly between April and 
October, as specified in the guidelines.  An automated survey using four static bat detectors (two 
per transect route) recording for at least three nights would also be carried out. Rather than 
deploying detectors at four locations every month, it is recommended that surveys are carried out 
at four locations for three months and another four locations for the other four months so that half 
the locations would be surveyed in April, June, August and October and the other four in May, July 
and September. This would increase the spatial coverage of the Survey Site but ensure that 
sampling was undertaken at each location in spring, summer and autumn to allow a robust 
seasonal comparison to be made.  
 
Abergelli Power Project - Phase 1 survey report

18/06/2014 
 
Great Crested Newt 
5.16 
The presence of four ponds on site with several more in the vicinity of the Survey Site, and the 
occurrence of suitable terrestrial habitat on site indicate that great crested newts could potentially 
be using the Survey Site. This should be established through further targeted survey work. 
5.17 
Section 5.4 of the GCN Mitigation Guidelines (English Nature, 2001) recommends that: 
“For a common situation, where a plot of land containing a pond is proposed for development, the 
pond itself should be surveyed, and other ponds up to 500m away should also be checked, if it is 
thought likely that great crested newt populations centred on these ponds would be affected by 
changes to the plot.” 
5.18 
Natural England guidance(2001) is further developed in the GCN Method Statement which states 
that:  
‘The decision on whether to survey depends primarily on how likely it is that the development would 
affect newts using those ponds. For developments resulting in permanent or temporary habitat loss 
at distances over 250m from the nearest pond, carefully consider whether a survey is 
appropriate.…. normally appropriate only when all of the following conditions are met: 
1. 
maps, aerial photos, walk-over surveys or other data indicate that the pond(s) has potential to 
support a large great crested newt population,  
2. 
the footprint contains particularly favourable habitat, especially if it constitutes the majority available 
locally,  
3. 
the development would have a substantial negative effect on that habitat, and 
4. 
there is an absence of dispersal barriers.’ 
5.19 
The second piece of guidance, which supersedes the first, specifies that all four conditions should 
be met for surveys to be required of ponds beyond 250m of the Survey Site boundary.  In this case, 
condition 1. is not met as there is no indication from desk study data or the HSI assessment that 
any of the ponds is likely to support a large population of GCN or that they provide particularly 
suitable habitat (condition 2.) with no ponds within 250m of the Survey Site recording better than an 
‘average’ score on the HSI assessment.  
5.20 
As a consequence, it is recommended that all ponds within 250m (not 250-500m) would need to be 
further surveyed. This would initially involve four surveys within the period mid-March to mid-June 
to establish presence/absence (with at least two surveys during mid-April to mid-May), with an 
additional two surveys (six in total) required to estimate population size if newts are found during 
the first four surveys.   
 
Dormouse 
5.21 
If the woodland on the Survey Site is to be removed, damaged or significantly modified, it is 
recommended that dormouse surveys are carried out with the aim of establishing whether the 
species is present on site, and therefore whether a EPS Licence will be required before woodland 
can be cleared or significantly modified. It is recommended undertaking a dormouse survey, 
following methods based on those prescribed in best practice guidance (Bright et al. 2006). The 
surveys will involve the use of dormouse boxes in areas of woodland and nest tubes in cluttered 
environments where boxes cannot be used. The survey will be designed to detect the presence or 
absence of dormice rather than to provide an abundance estimate or monitor a population of the 
species. Surveys would be carried out monthly during April-November. 
 
Otter and Water Vole 
5.22 
Otter usage of the Survey Site is likely to be occasional although there are suitable resting/lying up 
places present along the eastern stream corridor within the Survey Site.  Mitigation measures to 
avoid potential killing or injury to individuals during the construction and decommissioning phases 
should be considered, for example covering open workings overnight.   
 
Abergelli Power Project - Phase 1 survey report 
 
20 
18/06/2014 
5.23 
A survey for water voles along the banks of the water courses on site should be carried out as a 
precautionary measure to establish whether the species is likely to be present on site and to design 
mitigation accordingly.  This would involve one visit and should be carried out ideally in spring 
when field signs are likely to be most in evidence but the vegetation has not grown up to obscure 
them. It will also be possible to carry out additional checks for signs of otter at the same time as the 
water vole survey, for completeness. The survey would be carried out in accordance with best 
practice guidelines (Chanin (2003) and Strachan et al., (2011), respectively). 
 
Reptiles 
5.24 
A reptile survey should be carried out on the Survey Site to establish the presence/absence of 
reptiles, the species present and the approximate population size. The survey will be conducted 
using artificial refuges (e.g. roofing felt and tin) to aid in the detection of reptiles and assessment of 
their distribution and abundance, following good practice guidance, including that set out in the 
Herpetofauna Worker’s Manual (Gent & Gibson, 2003) and Reptile Survey Guidance (Froglife, 
1999). This requires a minimum of seven visits conducted at an appropriate time of year (either 
spring/early summer and/or late summer/early autumn) during suitable weather conditions. 
 
Badger 
5.25 
 Information on badgers is provided in a confidential version of this report. 
 
Breeding Birds 
5.26 
Breeding bird surveys of the Survey Site should be carried out with the aim of establishing the 
ecological value of the breeding bird population and to inform mitigation measures. Farmland birds 
(occurring both within the Survey Site and a buffer of up to 50m) would be the main target of the 
survey. Territory mapping surveys based on the British Trust for Ornithology’s Common Bird 
Census (CBC) methodology will be undertaken.  These would be conducted on three occasions 
during the breeding season.  It is recommended that an initial visit is carried out in mid-April, 
followed by additional visits in May and June. 
5.27 
The Phase 1 survey was partly conducted in winter with an experienced ornithologist (Matt Hobbs) 
part of the survey team. As there was no evidence of notable aggregations of common species or 
habitat that may support rarer species it is considered that there is no justification for carrying out 
targeted wintering bird surveys.  
Barn owls 
5.28 
It is recommended that all buildings and mature trees on site to be directly or indirectly affected by 
the Project (if any) should be inspected for signs of roosting or nesting. Signs to be searched for 
include: nest debris, barn owl pellets, white splashes from barn owl droppings and live or dead barn 
owls themselves (Barn Owl Trust, 2012). Barn owl roost inspections can be conducted all year 
round. 
Terrestrial Invertebrates 
5.29 
The block of marshy grassland to the west, provides potential habitat for marsh fritillary butterflies 
due to the presence of their food plant, devil’s-bit scabious. As such a survey of adults during late 
May/June and also the larval webs should be carried out in mid-August to mid-September. Both 
surveys would involve walking transects over the marshy grassland, the former noting adult marsh 
fritillary butterflies and the latter checking all patches of the food plant for larval webs and larvae 
and following standard methods9. 
5.30 
The woodland at Target Note 10, for example represents a fairly extensive area of semi-natural 
habitat that may be important for terrestrial invertebrates; which are both strongly represented in 
wooded habitats.  If the woodland at TN10 is to be affected by the Project it is proposed that further 
survey will be appropriate that targets both Lepidoptera (notably moths) and beetles (Coleoptera).

Abergelli Power Project - Phase 1 survey report 
 
21 
18/06/2014 
A moth survey should also be undertaken of the marshy grassland area in the north-west of the 
site. 
5.31 
Survey of Lepidoptera should involve two night-time moth surveys to be undertaken in late spring 
and mid-summer. Trapping using Skinner or Robinson moth traps fitted with mercury vapour bulbs 
is most suitable in terms of attracting an extensive and variable moth fauna. Lights should be 
switched on at dusk and remain lit until dawn the following day.  The traps should be checked 
periodically throughout the night to log any new arrivals.  Any species hard to identify from external 
markings alone, and those requiring further confirmation, should be retained and dissected if 
necessary to ascertain their identity with the use of a stereoscopic microscope. 
5.32 
For beetles, a method should be developed that follows Natural England (ISIS) protocol (Drake et 
al., 2007) to sample beetle assemblages directed at woodland habitats, via hand searches, sweep 
netting and pitfall trapping. To align with the Lepidoptera surveys, this can be undertaken in late 
spring/early summer and mid/late summer/early autumn. Subsequent laboratory identification will 
be required for many of the specimens collected. 
5.33 
Analysis of the results should use the ISIS protocol to determine whether any broad or specialist 
assemblage types of Lepidoptera and / or Coleoptera are present. Consideration should also be 
given to any rare, scarce or nationally threatened species present, including Section 42 species.  
Aquatic Invertebrates 
5.34 
On the assumption that watercourses will be affected by the Project, it may be appropriate to 
undertake an assessment of water quality, compliant with the Water Framework Directive (WFD). A 
main aim of the WFD is to prevent deterioration in the status of aquatic ecosystems, protect them 
and improve the ecological condition of waters. The requirement for such an assessment would be 
driven in consultation with Natural Resources Wales. Should such an assessment be required it 
may be appropriate to assess the ecological quality and surface water chemistry of watercourses to 
be affected. 
5.35 
To determine ecological quality kick-sampling for aquatic invertebrates should be undertaken at 
selected locations along the ditch / stream, and the Biological Monitoring Working Party (BMWP) 
score applied to inform an assessment of water quality and species present. This survey is best 
undertaken in spring or autumn in swift flowing waters, or in summer in stationary ditches or those 
with a slow flow. All macro-invertebrates should be identified to species level in order to determine 
the presence of any scarce or nationally notable species. 
5.36 
To determine water chemistry status a single water sample should be extracted at three locations; 
within the Survey Site and upstream and downstream of this. Samples should be dispatched to a 
UKAS accredited laboratory for subsequent analysis, to cover a standard range of parameters 
including: Biological Dissolved Oxygen, Total Suspended Solids, nutrient composition (e.g. nitrite 
as nitrogen, total oxidised nitrogen, total ammoniacal nitrogen, total phosphorus), hardness, 
calcium, alkalinity, conductivity and pH. 
5.37 
The condition of the watercourse can subsequently be analysed by recording and comparing the 
aggregated number of taxa, and average score per taxon from the sampling points along the 
watercourse within, upstream and downstream from the Survey Site. The statistical model (RICT) 
developed for WFD classification would be used to calculate the Ecological Quality Ratio (EQR) 
that compares observed with expected results for a watercourse of the same type. The EQR is 
then used to identify the Biological Status of the watercourse which is separated into five bands 
(Bad to High) required by the WFD. 
5.38 
It may also be necessary to undertake invertebrate surveys of any ponds that are likely to be 
affected by the development proposals. These are likely to involve surveys of aquatic beetles in 
June and August 
Un-surveyed Land 
5.39 
There are a number of small parcels of land that have not yet been surveyed in the southern part of 
the site. These are indicated on Figure 1b and will be surveyed once access has been arranged. 
The Phase 1 report will be updated once these surveys are complete.

Appendix 1: Target Notes 
February Survey 
1. A spring running into a wet ditch.  The ditch has a muddy base with sweet-grass Glyceria sp. and soft rush 
the dominant plant species.  Frog spawn was present. 
2. A wet ditch fenced on either side.  The ditch meets a spring which runs into it flowing southwards.  The 
ditch has steeply sloping grassy banks, is open and unshaded with great willow herb Epilobium hirstum and 
soft rush present.  A newly planted hedge runs along the south side – gapping up a defunct hedge.  Also, 
occasional large coppices of holly were recorded. 
3. Marshy grassland with abundant soft rush.   The sward is grazed very short by horses. Frequent patches 
of sedge species were recorded including common sedge and glaucous sedge.  Other species noted include 
sharp-flowered rush and/or jointed rush (difficult to separate in winter and when closely grazed), cinquefoil 
species, daisy and creeping bent.   
4. A small concrete bunker with wasteland area.  The concrete bunker is formed of 2m high brick walls with a 
flat roof formed from concrete sleepers.  There is an open doorway on the south elevation and a 30cm x 
30cm hole at the top of the west-facing wall.  No evidence of bats was recorded. The surrounding land is 
compacted course aggregate which is becoming colonised with common grassland species.  There is an 
earth bund around the south-east and north-east boundary, topped with dense bramble and gorse scrub. 
5. An area of marshy grassland which is very closely grazed.  Occasional heather and bilberry plants and 
patches of sphagnum moss were recorded. Purple moor grass is frequent and forms dominant tussocks at 
the north end of the field.  Other species include sheep’s fescue and a sedge species.   
6. An area of marshy grassland dominated by soft rush.  The field was not entered as it is outside the 
ownership boundary, but inspection from the roadside suggests that rushes are interspersed with 
agriculturally improved grassland. 
7. A wet ditch running through the middle of the field containing fast flowing water with orange discolouration. 
The ditch is overgrown with bramble and joins another ditch on its eastern boundary, which is lined with 
purple moor grass, greater willowherb, and soft rush.  The surrounding field is agriculturally improved with 
patches of soft rush. 
8. A derelict stone farmhouse with only the bottom halves of walls still present.  Patches of rubble and 
overgrown vegetation are present, which may provide good habitat for reptiles. 
9. A stream lined with trees, which is fast-flowing with a stony substrate. 
10. An area of broadleaved woodland.  The western end is on a hill, which slopes steeply down to the east.  
This end (delineated by a stream running north-south) is dry with widely spaced trees and a grazed 
grassland ground flora (Yorkshire fog, common mouse-ear, and creeping buttercup were the most prominent 
species) and very little understorey was noted.  The eastern end is much wetter, with carpets of opposite-
leaved golden-saxifrage, extensive areas of purple moor-grass dominated ground flora with some sphagnum 
moss species.  The understorey is thicker here and is predominantly bramble.   Tree species include birch, 
crab-apple, holly and pedunculate oak.  Most specimens are small-medium in size. 
11 and 12. These Target Notes relate to evidence of badger activity and are provided in a confidential 
version of this report. They are also omitted from Figures. 
13. A ditch along a line of small-medium trees (beech, holly, pedunculate oak) and a fence. Bilberry is 
growing along the fence. 
14. A marshy grassland field with abundant soft rush tussocks.  The area indicated by this target note is 
dominated by purple moor-grass with occasional cross-leaved heath and scattered small trees/scrub.  
15. A shallow pond (less than 10cm deep), approximately 10m in diameter, completely covered in a sedge 
species (only dead leaves were evident so identification was not possible) and with a small tree-covered 
island in the centre.  The pond is ringed by small trees.  The surrounding vegetation includes purple moor-
grass with occasional heather and cross-leaved heath and densely growing small trees and scrub (willow 
species, bramble and alder.  A small pond immediately to the south is shown on OS maps.  This consisted of 
small patches of standing water (including wheel ruts) within marshy (rushes, purple moor grass) vegetation. 
16.  A strip of land around the gas station, which is higher than the surrounding land.  There is a gravel strip 
immediately surrounding the boundary fence then a steep slope covered in soft-rush dominated grassland.  
At the base of the slope is a mosaic of marshy rush-dominated grassland with dense bramble scrub and wet

woodland.  The woodland consists of closely spaced, small and straggly trees composed largely of holly, 
pedunculate oak, birch, willow and alder.     
17. A patch of marshy grassland almost totally dominated by soft rush.  Small patch of bulrush were found 
towards centre of field.  The field is surrounded by encroaching scrub and straggly woodland. 
18.  An area of wet woodland with dense bramble understorey.  The species present and structure are as for 
Target Note 16.  Wet underfoot. 
19. A small pond within woodland fed by a stream.  No emergent/marginal vegetation was in evidence and 
the pond is surrounded by small saplings. 
20. Marshy grassland fields consisting of more than 25% soft rush.  The intervening grassland is 
agriculturally improved, including perennial rye-grass Lolium perenne, common mouse-ear and white clover 
Trifolium repens.   
21. An area of marshy grassland with approximately 75% soft rush cover. The intervening grassland is semi-
improved. 
22. An area of marshy grassland almost totally dominated by soft rush.  The western boundary fence has 
heather and purple moor-grass growing along it.

Appendix 6: Summaries of Relevant Legislation, Policy and Other 
Instruments 
National Planning Policy  
6.2 
Technical Advice Note (TAN) 5 provides Welsh Assembly Government advice about how the land 
use planning system in Wales should contribute to protecting and enhancing biodiversity and 
geological conservation.   
6.3 
It follows that the TAN provides guidance to local planning authorities on: the key principles of 
positive planning for nature conservation; nature conservation and Local Development Plans; 
nature conservation in development management procedures; development affecting protected 
internationally and nationally designated sites and habitats; and, development affecting protected 
and priority habitats and species. 
6.4 
Planning considerations with regard to habitats and species are of greatest relevance to the 
Abergelli Farm proposal.  For a full account, the TAN should be referred to, but some of the key 
principles are summarised as follows: 
i. 
When dealing with cases where a European protected species of plant or animal may be affected, 
a local planning authority needs to have regard to the requirements of the Habitats Directive in the 
exercise of its functions. 
ii. 
The TAN refers to the Wildlife and Countryside Act 1981 (as amended), which makes it an offence 
(with certain limited exceptions and in the absence of a licence) to intentionally to kill, injure or take 
any wild bird, or to damage, take or destroy the nest of any wild bird whilst that nest is being built or 
in use, or to take or destroy its eggs.  Further offences apply to species listed under Schedule 1 of 
the Act. 
iii. 
The above Act also affords protection to wild animals of the species listed in Schedule 5, and to 
wild plants listed in Schedule 8, most of which are not European protected species.  Actions that 
are likely to result in an offence are identified; 
iv. 
With regard to badger, Meles meles, the TAN refers to the provisions of the Protection of Badgers 
Act, 1992; 
v. 
The TAN makes reference to Sections 40 and 42 of the Natural Environment and Rural 
Communities Act 2006, which place a duty on the Welsh Assembly Government to have regard to 
the purpose of conserving biodiversity (see Section 1.10 of this report); 
vi. 
In section 2.4 it is noted that when deciding planning applications that may affect nature 
conservation, local planning authorities should protect wildlife and natural features in the wider 
environment, with appropriate weight attached to priority habitats and species in Biodiversity Action 
Plans; 
vii. 
When determining planning applications, planning authorities should ensure that all material 
considerations are taken into account, that decisions are informed by adequate information about 
the potential effects of development on nature conservation, and that the range and population of 
protected species is sustained; 
viii. 
Planning applications should demonstrate a step-wise approach to avoid harm to nature 
conservation, minimise unavoidable harm by mitigation measures, offset residual harm by 
compensation measures and look for new opportunities to enhance nature conservation. 
UK Post-2010 Biodiversity Framework 
6.5 
The Environment Departments of all four governments in the UK work together through the Four 
Countries Biodiversity Group.  Together they have agreed, and Ministers have signed, a framework 
of priorities for UK-level work for the Convention on Biological Diversity.  Published on 17 July 
2012, the 'UK Post-2010 Biodiversity Framework' covers the period from 2011 to 2020.  
 
Abergelli Power Project - Phase 1 survey report 
 
41 
18/06/2014 
6.6 
Most work which was previously carried out under the UK Biodiversity Action Plan (UK BAP) is now 
focussed in the four countries of the UK through the new framework.  The UK BAP partnership no 
longer operates but includes detailed Action Plans for priority habitats and species, which are still in 
use and of relevance. The list of priority habitats and species included within the UK BAP list is 
equivalent to the list of Section 42 habitats and species.  
6.7 
The UK BAP is supported by a series of Local Biodiversity Action Plans (LBAPs), usually set up on 
a local authority administrative boundary basis. Each LBAP identifies those habitats and species 
considered to be most important in that area (usually referred to as priority habitats and species). 
Commonly, an LBAP will identify a number of habitats and species for which “action plans” have 
been prepared. The Swansea LBAP is was created in 2005 but is unavailable as it is under review. 
Wildlife Legislation 
6.8 
Legislation of most relevance to this assessment includes the following: 
Natural Environment and Rural Communities (NERC) Act 2006  
6.9 
Section 40 of the Natural Environment and Rural Community Act (NERC) 2006 sets out the duty 
which public authorities have to conserve biodiversity. Section 40 States that: “every public 
authority must, in exercising its functions, have regard, so far as is consistent with the proper 
exercise of those functions, to the purpose of conserving biodiversity”. The term Public Authority 
includes local authorities and local planning authorities. 
6.10 
Paragraph 40(3) goes on to state that “conserving biodiversity includes, in relation to a living 
organism or type of habitat, restoring or enhancing a population or habitat”. 
6.11 
Paragraph 42(1) states that “the Secretary of State must, as respects Wales, publish a list of the 
living organisms and types of habitat which in the Secretary of State’s opinion are of principal 
importance for the purpose of conserving biodiversity”. This replaces a similar reference to the list 
that was found in Section 74 of the Countryside and Rights of Way Act 2000 (the CRoW Act). 
The Wildlife and Countryside Act 1981 (as amended by the Countryside and Rights of Way 
Act 2000) 
Protection afforded to birds 
6.12 
Section 1 of the Wildlife and Countryside Act 1981 (WCA) prohibits the intentional killing, injuring or 
taking of any wild bird and the taking, damaging or destroying of the nest (whilst being built or in 
use) or eggs.  Section 1 also prohibits disturbing any bird listed on Schedule 1 of the Act whilst at 
or near the nest and prohibits disturbing the dependent young of such birds. 
Protection afforded to other animals 
6.13 
Species listed on Schedule 5 that may be of relevance to this site include GCNs, bats, otter, water 
vole and all species of reptiles.  The places of shelter used by otter and water vole are protected, 
but reptiles are protected from killing and injury only. 
Protection afforded to Sites of Special Scientific Interest (SSSIs) 
6.14 
Section 28 allows for the creation of SSSIs by the government (through Natural Resources Wales 
in Wales) where Natural Resources Wales (NRW) “is of the opinion that any area of land is of 
special interest by reason of any of its flora, fauna, geological or physiographical features.” 
6.15 
Section 28G specifies the duty of specific public authorities (including local authorities) to further 
the conservation and enhancement of the features by reason of which the site is designated and 
also to notify NRW of operations likely to damage such features in order that NRW may consent to 
or refuse permission for such operations.

The Conservation of Habitats and Species Regulations 2010 
6.16 
The Conservation of Habitats and Species (Amendment) Regulations 2012 consolidates the 
various amendments that have been made to the Regulations. The original (1994) Regulations 
transposed the EC Habitats Directive on the Conservation of Natural Habitats and of Wild Fauna 
and Flora (Council Directive 92/43/EEC) into national law. 
6.17 
“European protected species” (EPS) are those which are present on Schedule 2 of the 
Conservation of Habitats and Species Regulations 2010. They are subject to the provisions of 
Regulation 41 of those Regulations. All EPS are also protected under the Wildlife and Countryside 
Act 1981 (as amended). Taken together, these pieces of legislation make it an offence to: 
a) Intentionally or deliberately capture, injure or kill any wild animal included amongst these 
species; 
b) Possess or control any live or dead specimens or any part of, or anything derived from a these 
species; 
c) Deliberately disturb wild animals of any such species; 
d) Deliberately take or destroy the eggs of such an animal; or 
e) Intentionally, deliberately or recklessly damage or destroy a breeding site or resting place of 
such an animal, or obstruct access to such a place. 
6.18 
For the purposes of paragraph (c), disturbance of animals includes in particular any disturbance 
which is likely— 
a) to impair their ability— 
I. 
to survive, to breed or reproduce, or to rear or nurture their young, or 
II. 
in the case of animals of a hibernating or migratory species, to hibernate or migrate; or 
6.19 
To affect significantly the local distribution or abundance of the species to which they belong. 
6.20 
Although the law provides strict protection to these species, it also allows this protection to be set 
aside (derogated) through the issuing of licences. The licences in England are currently determined 
by NE for development works. In accordance with the requirements of the Regulations (2012), a 
licence can only be issued where the following requirements are satisfied: 
a) The proposal is necessary ‘to preserve public health or public safety or other imperative 
reasons of overriding public interest including those of a social or economic nature and 
beneficial consequences of primary importance for the environment’; 
b) ‘There is no satisfactory alternative’; and 
c) The proposals ‘will not be detrimental to the maintenance of the population of the species 
concerned at a favourable conservation status in their natural range’. 
6.21 
EPS that may be relevant to this proposal include GCNs, bats, dormouse and otter. 
Invasive Species Legislation 
6.22 
Japanese knotweed and Himalayan balsam are both listed on Part 2, Schedule 9 of the Wildlife 
and Countryside Act 1981 (as amended).  Section 14 of the Act states that it is an offence for a 
person to plant or otherwise cause to grow in the wild any species listed on Part2, Schedule 9.  The 
Environmental Protection Act 1990 contains a number of legal provisions concerning ‘controlled 
waste’.  Any soil or plant material contaminated with Japanese knotweed that is to be discarded is 
classified as controlled waste.

Summary 
1.1 
Abergelli Power Limited (APL) is promoting a new Power Generation Plant with its associated Gas 
and Electricity Connections (the ‘Project’) on agricultural land within Abergelli Farm, north of 
Swansea in the City and County of Swansea (approximately at National Grid Reference 265284, 
201431). 
1.2 
The preliminary ecological appraisal1 identified records of otter Lutra lutra and water vole Arvicola 
amphibius within 2 km of the Project Site boundary, and suitable habitat to support these species 
within the Project Site boundary at the time of the survey (hereafter referred to as the ‘Survey 
Site’). APL commissioned BSG Ecology to undertake an otter and water vole survey of streams 
and wet ditches within the 150 ha of pastoral farmland at and around Abergelli Farm in June 2014 
within the Survey Site, to inform and support an application for Development Consent for the 
Project. 
1.3 
All accessible ponds, streams and wet ditches within the Survey Site boundary were surveyed for 
field signs of use by otter and water vole. 
1.4 
There are water courses on Survey Site that could provide resting places and commuting routes for 
otter. A single fresh spraint was recorded during the survey. This was observed on a rock in the 
stream that runs along the eastern boundary of the Survey Site. 
1.5 
Holes, that were likely to be mammal burrows, were observed at six points along two streams 
within the Survey Site. The holes have the right dimensions to allow use by water voles, but did not 
show signs of current occupation. No latrines, footprints or grazing lawns were observed during the 
survey.

Introduction 
2.1 
Abergelli Power Limited commissioned BSG Ecology to undertake an otter and water vole survey 
in May/June 2014 to inform and support an application for Development Consent for the Project 
described below.  
Site Description 
2.2 
The Survey Site consists of approximately 150 ha of pastoral farmland, primarily grazed by horses. 
The extent of the Survey Site is shown in (Figure 1, Appendix 1) and is centred at National Grid 
Reference 265284, 201431. The nearest settlement is Felindre, which is located approximately 2 
km to the north of the Survey Site, with Swansea approximately 5 km to the south.    
2.3 
The Survey Site is largely agriculturally improved pasture with several areas of marshy grassland, 
particularly in the north, south and north-western ends of the Survey Site. The fields are bounded 
by fences, running along the line of defunct hedgerows, and often accompanied by ditches. There 
is a block of broadleaved woodland on the eastern boundary of the Survey Site and other areas of 
woodland around the marshy grassland to the west of the Survey Site, and around Felindre Gas 
Compressor Station and the two National Grid 400 kV electrical substations that lie at the south-
west end of the Survey Site. The habitats in the surrounding landscape are similar to those within 
the Survey Site boundary – a mixture of improved and marshy grassland interspersed with 
occasional patches of woodland. 
2.4 
There are a number of water courses within the Survey Site as described below: 
 
A stream corridor with small tributaries fed by springs and surface runoff along the 
eastern boundary of the Survey Site, which feeds into the River Llan to the south.  
 
A wooded stream runs along the north western boundary.  
 
Several small streams and wet ditches run through the woodland surrounding the 
Felindre Gas Compressor Station and the two National Grid 400 kV electrical substations. 
 
Drainage ditches border many of the pasture fields. 
Description of Project 
2.5 
APL is promoting a new Power Generation Plant with associated Gas and Electricity Connections 
within Abergelli Farm.  The Power Generation Plant would operate as a Simple Cycle Gas Turbine 
(SCGT) peaking plant and would be designed to provide an electrical capacity of up to 299 
Megawatts (MW).  It would be fuelled by natural gas, supplied by a new underground gas pipeline 
connecting Power Generation Plant to the existing National Grid Gas (NGG) National Transmission 
System (NTS). It would also connect to the National Grid Electrical Transmission System (NETS) 
via underground cable or overhead lines. 
2.6 
BSG Ecology has been appointed as the ecological consultant to undertake an ecology survey, 
which includes a desk study and Extended Phase 1 Habitat Survey as well as a range of Phase 2 
surveys, including an otter and water vole survey. These baseline surveys will be included in an 
appendix to an ecology chapter of an Environmental Statement, which is intended for submission in 
support of the application for Development Consent. 
Aims of Study 
2.7 
The aims of the otter and water vole survey within the Survey Site were to: 
 
Assess where water courses within the Survey Site have the potential to support otter and 
water vole. 
 
Establish the likely presence/absence of each species and, if present, their distribution 
throughout the relevant watercourses.

Methods 
Desk Study 
3.1 
Existing ecological information for the Survey Site and the surrounding area was requested from 
the South East Wales Biodiversity Records Centre (SEWBReC).  Information on European and 
nationally protected2 species, including otter and water vole, was requested covering the Survey 
Site and land up to 2 km from the Survey Site boundary. In addition, on-line mapping and aerial 
photography of the area was also reviewed in May 2014 to identify watercourses that might be 
present within the Survey Site. 
Scoping Survey 
3.2 
A Phase 1 habitat survey was carried out by BSG Ecology in February 2014 and updated in April 
and July 20143. During the Phase 1 habitat survey it was noted that a number of watercourses 
within the Survey Site had the potential to support otter and water vole, although no field signs 
were observed. The ponds within the Survey Site were also assessed at this time, and no field 
signs of otter or water vole were noted. 
Field Survey 
3.3 
The otter and water vole survey included two visits to cover water courses within the Survey Site. 
The first visit covered the north of the Survey Site and was conducted on 20 May 2014 by Anna 
Gundrey MCIEEM and Rachel Taylor ACIEEM. The second visit covered the south of the Survey 
Site and was conducted on 26 June 2014 by Rachel Taylor ACIEEM and Caitlin McCann. All 
accessible water courses were inspected for field signs of otter and water vole. In addition, Rachel 
Taylor ACIEEM and Caitlin McCann surveyed the ponds within the Survey Site while undertaking 
great crested newt Triturus cristatus presence/absence surveys in May 20144.  
Otter 
3.4 
The otter survey was carried out on all accessible water courses within the Survey Site. Survey 
methods followed those recommended in Chanin (2003)5. 
3.5 
The water courses, including the channel and banks, were systematically surveyed for signs of 
otter such as droppings (‘spraints’), runs and footprints.  All areas that were accessible were 
surveyed, and particular attention was given to suitable sprainting areas such as large, flat rocks or 
areas where otters were likely to leave the water course.  Otter spraint can be distinguished from 
other mammal droppings, such as mink, by its distinctive musky smell and the presence of fish 
bones.  Mink scats tend to be twisted in appearance and are smaller.   
3.6 
Signs of, or potential for, permanent dwellings (‘holts’) or resting places for otters were also 
recorded.  Holts and resting places include structures such as cavities in roots of bank side trees, 
piles of logs or flood debris, drains and caves.  Otters can also use resting places above ground in 
reed beds and dense scrub such as bramble Rubus fruticosa and blackthorn Prunus spinosa.   
Water Vole 
3.7 
All water courses that were accessible were surveyed within the optimal period for finding water 
vole (late April to early October). This is in line with survey standards set out in The Water Vole 
Conservation Handbook6. The water courses, including the channel and banks, were

systematically surveyed for signs of water vole such as latrines (a communal area of droppings), 
feeding stations and grazed lawns, burrows (wider than high, diameter 4-8 cm), runs and footprints.   
3.8 
In addition, an assessment was made of whether individual water courses have potential to support 
water vole. The Water Vole Conservation Handbook describes favourable water vole habitat as 
having: wide swathes of riparian vegetation to provide both food and shelter; easily penetrable 
earth banks; and slow flowing, relatively deep (over 1 m) slow flowing water courses.  Factors such 
as shallow water or over-shading by trees are generally unfavourable to water voles. 
Classification of Areas Surveyed for Otter and Water Vole 
3.9 
Target notes (TN) were used to describe the characteristics of the water courses surveyed and to 
record any field signs that were observed. These were mapped (Figure 1, Appendix 1) and the 
target notes included (Appendix 2). In order to further illustrate the findings of the survey, the 
streams and ditches were categorised as follows: 
3.10 
Habitat considered unsuitable for use by otter/water vole – water courses with some or all of 
the following characteristics: no/low water levels; shaded; little vegetation; poached banks; no 
suitable resting places; no field signs of otter or water vole. 
3.11 
Habitat considered suitable for use by otter/water vole – water courses with some or all of the 
following characteristics: permanent flow of water; vegetation on banks; minimal shading; suitable 
resting places present; signs of otter/water vole. 
3.12 
Photographs are included showing the characteristics of water courses within the Survey Site 
(Appendix 3).

Results  
Otter 
Desk Study 
4.1 
SEWBReC provided 32 records of otter within the 2 km search radius, all recorded between 1991 
and 2013. The closest record to the Survey Site is 0.5 km to the south west of the River Llan.  At its 
closest point the River Llan is approximately 0.3 km south of the southern Survey Site boundary, 
within the same surface water catchment, and it links to the Survey Site via the stream running 
through the woodland in the centre of the Survey Site. 
Field Survey 
4.2 
A single fresh otter spraint was found in the stream that runs along the eastern boundary of the 
Survey Site (see TN3, Figure 1, Appendix 1; and Appendix 2). At this point the stream is 
approximately 15 cm deep and with a bed of mud, gravel and rocks, the eastern bank is 
approximately 2 m high and sheer with over hanging trees. The western bank has an 
approximately 45 degree grass slope and is approximately 1.5 m high. 
4.3 
No other signs were observed that confirm otter presence in the other water courses within the 
Survey Site.  
4.4 
The stream that runs along the eastern boundary of the Survey Site also had deep overhangs 
created by the root system of the mature hedge and trees on the east bank. These have potential 
to be used as resting places by otter (see Figure 1, Appendix 1). However, foraging opportunities 
for otters are likely to be limited due to the low water levels (20-30 cm), which would make the 
watercourse less suitable for fish, and therefore foraging otters.   
Water Vole 
Desk Study 
4.5 
SEWBReC provided three records of water vole, within a 2 km search radius. These records were 
from the River Llan approximately 1.9 km from the Survey Site boundary, all from 1996.  This River 
is in the same surface water catchment as watercourses present in the Survey Site, so it is 
possible that water voles could move along water courses that are linked to the River Llan (see 
section 4.1 above). 
Field Survey 
4.6 
During the surveys many of the ditches that had contained water during the first Phase 1 habitat 
survey (in February after a very wet winter) had completely dried out by the time of the otter and 
water vole surveys in May and June 2014. The remaining water courses were fast running and 
shallow. The banks of the streams were often over-shaded with encroaching bramble and gorse or 
had steep, bare banks.  
4.7 
No field signs were observed during the surveys that clearly establish the presence of water vole. 
Some burrows were noted that had dimensions suitable for use by water vole and/or bank vole 
Myodes glareolus and rats, but did not exhibit signs of current use (see TNs 1. 2, 4, 5 and 7). 
However, no associated latrines, footprints or grazing lawns were observed at any of these 
locations, Figure 1, Appendix 1; Appendix 2). There was also no evidence of associated burrows 
below the water line, which is typical of water vole burrows. The holes were therefore considered 
unlikely to be used by water vole and are more likely to have been created by another species of 
small mammal, such as bank vole Myodes glareolus, or been created by water vole but 
subsequently abandoned.

4.8 
No water vole field signs were observed at the ponds within the Survey Site during the great 
crested newt presence/absence surveys in May 20147. 
Incidental Sightings 
In addition to signs of otter and water vole presence recorded during the survey, some signs of 
badger activity were also noted and are included here for completeness. A single hole badger sett 
was found at TN9, with digging and a fresh latrine recorded at TN8.  
Limitations of Study 
4.9 
Some of the southern stretch of the stream along the eastern boundary of the Survey Site had 
extensive bramble and scrub along the banks, with low over-hanging branches and debris in the 
stream itself. This impeded the view of the surveyors along this stretch. However, a large stretch of 
the northern section of the same stream was also surveyed without issue, and therefore this 
limitation should not affect the overall results of the survey. Areas that were inaccessible, or for 
which the visibility was limited due to extensive scrub, are also indicated on the map (Figure 1, 
Appendix 1).

Appendix 2: Target Notes (TN) 
 
Stream at TN1 - The stream is wooded, mostly shaded with shallow bramble covered banks. The 
stream bed is stony, water fast moving and shallow. This provides a sheltered corridor through 
which otter may commute, but no obvious resting places or signs of otter use were observed. 
 
1. 
At TN 1 there is a vertical 1m high bare mud bank on the western side of the stream. The stream is 
approximately 10 cm deep at this point. There is a hole 1 m above the water which had dimensions 
suitable for use by water vole and/or bank vole/rat. No other field signs were observed.  
 
To the south of TN1 is a marshy field with a network of ditches - At the time of survey (May) these 
ditches were dry or contained very little water and had steep banks with very little or no vegetation. 
 
Stream at TN2 to TN10 – The stream is relatively unshaded, with a bed of mud, gravel and rocks. 
The water depth ranges from approximately 10 cm to 20 cm where pools form. It is fast flowing and 
appears clean. The eastern bank is approximately 2 m high and sheer. It is topped by a mature 
hedge the root system of which form a number of deep overhangs by the side of the stream. The 
west bank has an approximately 45 degree grassed slope.  
 
2. 
A hole was found in the vertical east bank, approximately 20 cm above the waterline, which had 
dimensions suitable for use by water vole and/or bank vole/rat. No other field signs were observed. 
3. 
A fresh otter spraint was found on a large, flat stone in the middle of the stream. 
4. 
A pair of holes was found in the east bank approximately 1.5 m from the water line, which had 
dimensions suitable for use by water vole and/or bank vole/rat. No other field signs were observed. 
5. 
A possible otter resting place on east bank. No otter field signs were observed. A 15 cm diameter 
hole was found leading into a cavity under the tree root bole, approximately 2 m above the water 
line. Approximately 3 m to the south of this there are three further holes, 1 m above the waterline 
on the eastern bank with dimensions that would allow use by water vole and/or bank vole/rat. No 
water vole field signs were observed.  
6. 
Tributary of the main stream, this is a narrow brook that has dried out at its northern end. It is over 
shaded by scrub, no field signs for otter or water vole were observed. 
7. 
There is a particularly deep over-hang in the east bank under a root bole. Basal rocks are moss 
free on top suggesting that it may be regularly accessed; however no field signs of otter were 
observed. This has good potential as a resting place for otter. On the west bank, above a culvert 
pipe that runs into the stream from the brook at TN6 there are two holes with dimensions that 
would allow use by water vole and/or bank vole/rat. No other field signs of water vole were 
observed. 
8. 
A deep cavity in the eastern bank along the waterline good provides a potential resting place for 
otter. No otter field signs were observed. On the top of the west bank opposite the cavity are a 
number of fresh patches of badger digging and a fresh badger latrine. 
9. 
A hole was found in the east bank 2 m above the water line; dimensions suggest that this is a 
badger sett. There is a mammal run into the field to the east.  
10. 
The stream becomes very shaded at this point, and the eastern bank is largely undercut providing 
several potential resting places for otter. No field signs were observed.  
 
Damp ditch/brook at TN11 to TN12 – to the north of TN11 this is a dry to damp ditch that has 
mainly bare banks, with some areas over-grown by bramble. It is open to horses and sheep and 
the land around the ditch is poached. No signs of otter or water vole were observed and this 
section is considered unsuitable for use by either species. To the south of TN11 the amount of 
water in the ditch gradually becomes greater until it forms a narrow brook, approximately 10 cm in 
depth.  
 
11. 
The brook is very over-grown with gorse and bramble, the banks are approximately 1 m high and 
the water is quick moving and shallow. There is a fenced culvert 10 m to the north which is partially 
blocked by debris from a fallen tree on the eastern bank. No field signs of otter or water vole were 
observed.  
12. 
The brook is shallow and fast moving with low grassy banks, over grown by bramble and nettle in 
large sections. No signs of otter or water vole were observed. South of this location the stream runs 
through woodland and connects to the stream along the eastern boundary of the Survey Site.  
 
 
 
 
Stream at TN13 to TN18 – The southern section of the stream previously described in TN2 to 
TN10. The banks are lined with trees and a scrub understorey of predominantly bramble, the 
stream is approximately 10 cm – 20 cm deep with a rocky bed. The bank is approximately 1 – 2 m 
high and undercut in places. The extensive scrub impeded the surveyors’ ability to access the 
stream, however the length was walked and notes made when a good view was available. 
  
13. 
The stream is narrow, with a bare bank approximately 1 m on each side. It is encroached by 
bramble and gorse and is largely over shaded. No signs of otter or water vole were observed.  
14. 
A shallow ditch extending north-west of the stream, it is dry at the northern end, the banks and low 
and poached by horses. The south end contains a small amount of slow moving water and is 
overgrown with bramble.  
15. 
A similar ditch to TN14, this is dry to the north and the banks are poached by horses. No signs of 
otter or water vole were observed.  
16. 
The stream is wide, and fast moving, approximately 10 cm in depth. The banks are approximately 1 
m high and covered by bramble. There is some undercutting of the bank, although not deep 
enough to provide resting opportunities for otter. No signs of otter or water vole were observed.  
17. 
The stream is narrow and fast moving, approximately 15cm deep, banks are steep and bare 
topped with bramble. No signs of otter or water vole were observed. 
18. 
The stream is wide and fast flowing, approximately 20 cm deep. Root boles of trees along the 
western bank provide resting opportunities for otter. The eastern bank is low with a stone beach 
where the stream bends. No signs were observed however access was limited due to bramble and 
a fence on the western bank.  
 
Ditches and stream at TN19 to TN21 – ditches run along the edge of sheep pasture, most of 
these are dry with bare banks. A small brook runs from the edge of the woodland through the 
pasture and extends south outside of the site boundary.  
 
19. 
This is a dry sheep poached ditch. No signs of otter or water vole were observed.  
20. 
A shallow brook, approximately 10cm in depth with a 50cm high grassy bank to the west and trees 
along the eastern bank. There are fox runs along the western side. No signs of otter or water vole 
were observed.  
21. 
A nearly dry ditch, small trickle of water runs over a muddy bed. The banks are low and bare, the 
ditch is over shaded by trees which line each side. No signs of otter or water vole were observed. 
  
Water courses in and around wet woodland and National Grid land at TN22 to TN26 – There 
are shallow ditches along the edges of the woodland, with small streams running in the interior of 
the woodland. The streams are approximately 10 cm deep, containing leaf litter and debris. The 
banks are steep with little vegetation other than nettle.  
 
22. 
Very narrow, over-shaded steam with fast moving, shallow water. There is bramble encroaching on 
both banks. No signs of otter or water vole were observed.  
23. 
Slow flowing woodland ditch with little water, and a large amount of leaf litter and debris. The banks 
are low with no vegetation. No signs of otter or water vole were observed. The ditch to the north of 
this point becomes inaccessible.  
24. 
Similar to the ditch at TN23 this ditch is shallow with slow moving water and completely over 
shaded by the woodland, with large amounts of leaf litter. No otter or water vole signs were 
observed.  
25. 
Small stream along the east edge of the field to the east of the Felindre Gas Compressor Station. 
Fast flowing, shallow (15 cm) with gravel and rock bed. Wide mammal run down to the stream at 
this point, though to be used by the sheep resident in the field. No signs of otter or water vole were 
observed.  
26. 
A dry ditch at the time of survey, shaded by trees and full of leaf litter.

Summary 
1.1 
Abergelli Power Limited (APL) is promoting a new Power Generation Plant with associated Gas 
and Electricity Connections (the ‘Project’) on agricultural land within Abergelli Farm north of 
Swansea in the City and County of Swansea (approximately at National Grid Reference 265284, 
201431). 
1.2 
The Preliminary Ecological Appraisal (PEA) (BSG Ecology, 2014) did not identify records of 
dormouse Mucardinus avellanarius within 2 km of the Project Site boundary, but habitat suitable for 
supporting dormouse was found within the Project Site boundary at the time of the Extended Phase 
1 Habitat survey (referred to as the ‘Survey Site’). 
1.3 
APL commissioned BSG Ecology to undertake a presence/absence survey for dormouse in 
suitable woodland, hedgerow and scrub habitats within 150 ha of pastoral farmland within the 
Survey Site, to inform and support an application for Development Consent for the Project. The 
dormouse survey was undertaken between June and November 2014. 
1.4 
The survey did not record any dormouse in the areas surveyed.  Sufficient visits were undertaken 
to determine the likely absence of this species from the Survey Site in line with best practice 
guidance for survey. 
1.5 
All accessible woodland, hedgerow and scrub habitats within the Survey Site boundary were 
included in the survey.

Introduction 
2.1 
Abergelli Power Limited (APL) commissioned BSG Ecology in May 2014 to undertake a dormouse 
survey to inform an application for Development Consent for the Project described below.  
2.2 
APL is promoting a new Power Generation Plant with its associated Gas and Electricity 
Connections (the ‘Project’) on agricultural land within Abergelli Farm, north of Swansea in the City 
and County of Swansea (approximately at National Grid Reference 265284, 201431).  
Site Description 
2.3 
The Survey Site consists of approximately 150 ha of pastoral farmland, primarily grazed by horses. 
The extent of the Survey Site is shown in Figure 1 in Appendix 1 and is centred at National Grid 
Reference 265284, 201431. The nearest settlement is Felindre, which is located approximately 2 
km to the north of the Survey Site, with Swansea approximately 5 km to the south.    
2.4 
The Survey Site is largely agriculturally improved pasture with several areas of marshy grassland, 
particularly in the north, south and north-western extents of the Survey Site. The fields are bounded 
by fences, running along the line of defunct hedgerows, and often accompanied by ditches. There 
is a block of broadleaved woodland on the eastern boundary of the Survey Site and other areas of 
woodland around the marshy grassland to the west of the Survey Site, and around Felindre Gas 
Compressor Station and the two National Grid electrical substations that lie at the south-west end 
of the Survey Site. The habitats in the surrounding landscape are similar to those within the Survey 
Site boundary which comprise a mixture of improved and marshy grassland interspersed with 
occasional patches of woodland. 
Description of Project 
2.5 
APL is promoting a new Power Generation Plant with associated Gas and Electricity Connections 
within Abergelli Farm.  The Power Generation Plant would operate as a Simple Cycle Gas Turbine 
(SCGT) peaking plant and would be designed to provide an electrical capacity of up to 299 
Megawatts (MW).  It would be fuelled by natural gas, supplied by a new underground gas pipeline 
connecting Power Generation Plant to the existing National Grid Gas (NGG) National Transmission 
System (NTS). It would also connect to the National Grid Electrical Transmission System (NETS) 
via underground cable or overhead lines. 
2.6 
BSG Ecology has been appointed as the ecological consultant to undertake ecology surveys, 
which include a desk study and Extended Phase 1 Habitat Survey as well as a range of Phase 2 
surveys, including a dormouse survey. These baseline surveys will be included in an appendix to 
the ecology chapter of an Environmental Statement, which is intended for submission in support of 
the application for Development Consent. 
Aims of Study 
2.7 
The aims of the dormouse survey were to identify whether dormouse are present in woodland, 
hedgerow and scrub habitats within the Survey Site boundary using standard survey methods (as 
specified in Section 3).

Methods 
Desk Study 
3.1 
Existing ecological information for the Survey Site and its surrounding area was requested from the 
South East Wales Biodiversity Records Centre (SEWBReC). Information on protected1 species, 
including dormouse, was requested covering the Survey Site and land up to 2 km from the Survey 
Site boundary. In addition, on-line mapping and aerial photography of the area were also reviewed 
to identify areas of suitable habitat that might be present outside of the Survey Site that could be 
connected to habitats within the Survey Site, or support off-site populations that maintain linkages 
through habitats in the Survey Site. 
Scoping Survey 
3.2 
A Preliminary Ecological appraisal (PEA) was carried out by BSG Ecology in February 2014 and 
updated in April and July 2014 (BSG Ecology, 2014). As part of the PEA woodland, hedgerow and 
scrub habitats were assessed with regard to their suitability to support dormouse in terms of woody 
species diversity and structure. The connectivity of woodland habitats within the wider landscape 
was also considered. 
Field Survey 
3.3 
The survey was undertaken in accordance with the best practice survey guidance as set out in 
English Nature’s Dormouse Conservation Handbook (English Nature, 2006). Under this guidance it 
is stated that to determine presence/absence within a woodland that a minimum of 50 nest tubes at 
a spacing of 15-20 m intervals need to be put out in suitable habitats for several months, and these 
tubes then need to be checked monthly for indications of use by dormouse. The indications of use 
include finding animals in residence within the tube during the survey or finding a nest 
characteristic of the species. Dormouse typically make neat nests comprising tightly woven 
honeysuckle bark (or similar), along with green leaves, normally hazel, though other species are 
used. This differs from the nest of other small mammals which are typically much messier and lack 
a distinct structure. 
3.4 
Each month receives a score based on the probability of dormouse occupying the tubes in that 
month. For a survey to be considered valid a total of 20 or more points are required. The score per 
month is illustrated in Table 1 below.

3.5 
A total of 143 tubes were deployed in woodland, scrub, and hedgerow habitats across the Survey 
Site with 110 tubes deployed in May and June.  Due to difficulties in gaining access permission for 
the access road the deployment in this area was undertaken later in June. The tubes were 
deployed as follows:  
 
55 tubes were deployed on 9 May 2014, the locations of which are shown in red on the Plan 
provided as Figure 1: 
 
A further 55 tubes were deployed on 4 June with the locations shown in green on Figure 1; 
and 
 
When access to the National Grid land was obtained, a further 33 tubes were deployed along 
the access road on 24 June.  The locations of these tubes are shown in blue on Figure 1. 
Limitations of study 
3.6 
The Survey Site was surveyed with a sufficient number and density of tubes to comply with best 
practice guidance on dormouse survey. Most tubes were deployed within the Survey Site between 
June to November inclusive, which scores 20 points under best practice guidance. 20 points is the 
minimum number of points required for a survey to be considered valid. 
3.7 
Some of the tubes (33) were not deployed until 24 June. This was due to late permission to survey 
the National Grid Access road margins. This led to the areas of suitable dormouse habitat adjacent 
to the National Grid access road being surveyed from July, rather than June. This area is a small 
part of the wider habitat within the Survey Site that was identified as having the potential to support 
dormouse. The road margins here are connected to other blocks of woodland and scrub in the 
western and, to a lesser extent (as habitat connections are fragmented in the middle part of the 
Survey Site) the eastern part of the Survey Site and are considered to be contiguous with these 
areas and therefore part of the same dormouse survey area. The results of the survey are clear 
and robust enough to conclude that dormouse is likely to be absent from the Survey Site, 
regardless of the lack of one month of data from a small section of the site, and this is not 
considered to be a significant constraint.

Results  
Desk Study 
4.1 
There were no records of dormouse provided by SEWBREC within 2 km of the Survey Site. 
4.2 
The lack of records in the immediate surrounds of the Survey Site does not necessarily indicate the 
absence of dormouse. A lack of records can be due to a lack of survey, which in turn could be a 
based on former assumptions of dormouse habitat requirements. In recent years dormice have 
been recorded in habitats previously discounted as unsuitable, meaning that survey for this species 
in sub-optimal habitats is currently recommended.  
Scoping Survey 
4.3 
The Survey Site was assessed for its suitability to support dormouse during the PEA survey. It was 
found to support numerous fragments of woodland, some of which are designated as Ancient 
Woodland, as well as several treelines that follow stream corridors or are remnants of former 
wooded areas that have been cleared historically. 
4.4 
The habitats within the Survey Site were assessed as being sub-optimal for dormouse for the 
following reasons: 
 
There is a very low occurrence of hazel Corylus avellana within the Survey Site, along with a 
low diversity of other woody species present on the Survey Site. Dormice typically require a 
variety of woody species to ensure, year round availability of food; 
 
Many of the woodlands have been grazed and lack a well-developed understorey, typically 
required by dormouse; and   
 
The Survey Site lacks hedgerows, with most of the field boundaries comprising post and wire 
fences.  Some tree lines are present, where hedgerows have become defunct though a lack of 
active management. Some small areas of hedgerow are present along the National Grid 
access road and these were included in the survey. The lack of hedgerows reduces the 
suitability of the Survey Site as hedgerows typically serve to provide habitat linkages between 
small woodlands such as those found on the Survey Site and its wider surrounds.

Field Survey  
4.5 
The first survey was carried out on 25 June which excluded the 33 tubes put out the day before 
along the National Grid Access Road.  The 33 tubes not included on 25 June were first surveyed 
on 9 July after having been left to “bed in”2.  The second survey (on 9 July included all the tubes 
and was undertaken on 23rd and 24 of July.  The surveys were carried out by Niall Lusby CMIEEM 
(licence number 53084:OTH:SA:2014) and Gareth Lang (licence number (44285:OTH:SA:2013).

2 Bed in – this phrase is used to describe a period of time that the tubes are left before the first survey is 
carried out. During this time the scent of humans disappears from the tube, and dormice are more likely to 
use them.

Summary 
1.1 
Abergelli Power Limited (APL) is promoting a new Power Generation Plant with its associated Gas 
and Electricity Connections (the ‘Project’) on agricultural land within Abergelli Farm north of 
Swansea in the City and County of Swansea (approximately at National Grid Reference 265284, 
201431). 
1.2 
APL commissioned BSG Ecology to undertake a breeding bird survey within 150 ha of pastoral 
farmland at and around Abergelli Farm in 2014, to inform and support an application for 
Development Consent for the Power Generation Plant.  
1.3 
Breeding birds were surveyed by walking along field boundaries and tracks within the Survey Site 
at a slow pace to enable all birds detected to be located, identified and recorded. Frequent stops 
were made to listen and scan for singing and calling birds. The Survey Site was visited on three 
occasions, once during each of April, May and June. A constant search effort was employed during 
each survey visit, with all habitat types being approached to within approximately 50 m.  
1.4 
Nine bird species of principal importance for nature conservation’ as referred to in S42 of the 
NERC Act 2006 (S42)1 (cuckoo Cuculus canorus, grasshopper warbler Locustella naevia dunnock 
Prunella modularis, house sparrow Passer domesticus, linnet Carduelis cannabina, lesser redpoll 
Carduelis cabaret, skylark Alauda arvensis, song thrush Turdus philomelos, and tree pipit Anthus 
trivialis) were considered likely to breed on site. All nine S42 species recorded within the Survey 
Site are also red-listed species of conservation concern in Wales (RSPB, 2009), with the exception 
of dunnock (which is amber-listed).  An additional seven amber-listed species, bullfinch Pyrrhula 
pyrrhula, mistle thrush Turdus viscivorus, meadow pipit Anthus pratensis, reed bunting Emberiza 
schoeniclus, common redstart Phoenicurus phoenicurus, whitethroat Sylvia communis and willow 
warbler Phylloscopus trochilus were also considered to have bred. 
1.5 
No territories of species listed under Schedule 1 Part 1 of the Wildlife & Countryside Act 1981 (as 
amended) (Schedule 1 species) were recorded, although two Schedule 1 species were recorded 
during the surveys, as follows. A pair of red kite Milvus milvus was recorded mobbing a peregrine 
falcon Falco peregrinus over the Felindre Gas Compressor Station land during survey in May. A 
pair of kites was also recorded flying over the eastern boundary in the northern compartment of the 
Survey Site during the same survey day. Given the timing of the records, and that at least one pair 
were recorded during survey it is likely that red kite breed locally but that the single record of 
peregrine referred to a transient bird. No evidence was found to suggest breeding of either species 
occurred within the Survey Site during 2014. 
                                                      
1 The Natural Environment and Rural Communities Act 2006 (NERC 2006) required the Welsh Assembly Government 
(WAG), based on advice from the Countryside Council for Wales (now part of Natural Resources Wales), to identify 
species and habitats of principal importance for the conservation of biodiversity in Wales.  Section 42 of The NERC Act 
requires the WAG to take steps to “further the conservation” of these species/habitats.

Introduction 
2.1 
Abergelli Power Limited (APL) commissioned BSG Ecology to undertake a breeding bird survey to 
inform and support an application for Development Consent for the Project described below.  
Site Description  
2.2 
The Survey Site consists of approximately 150 ha of pastoral farmland primarily grazed by horses. 
The extent of the Survey Site is shown in Figure 1 and is centred at National Grid Reference 
265284, 201431. The nearest settlement is Felindre, which is located approximately 2 km to the 
north of the Survey Site, with Swansea approximately 5 km to the south.    
2.3 
The Survey Site is largely agriculturally improved pasture with several areas of marshy grassland, 
particularly in the north, south and north-western ends of the Survey Site. The fields are bounded 
by fences, running along the line of defunct hedgerows, and often accompanied by ditches. There 
is a block of broadleaved woodland on the eastern boundary of the Survey Site and other areas of 
woodland around the marshy grassland to the west of the Survey Site, and around Felindre Gas 
Compressor Station and the two National Grid 400 kV electrical substations that lie at the south-
west end of the Survey Site.  The habitats in the surrounding landscape are similar to those within 
the Survey Site boundary – a mixture of improved and marshy grassland interspersed with 
occasional patches of woodland. 
Description of Project 
2.4 
APL is promoting a new Power Generation Plant with associated Gas and Electricity Connections 
within the Survey Site.  The Power Generation Plant would operate as a Simple Cycle Gas Turbine 
(SCGT) peaking plant and would be designed to provide an electrical capacity of up to 299 
Megawatts (MW).  It would be fuelled by natural gas, supplied by a new underground gas pipeline 
connecting the Power Generation Plant to the existing National Grid Gas (NGG) National 
Transmission System (NTS).  It would also connect to the National Grid Electrical Transmission 
System (NETS) via underground cable or overhead lines. 
2.5 
BSG Ecology has been appointed as the ecological consultant to undertake an ecological survey, 
which includes a desk study and Extended Phase 1 Habitat Survey as well as a range of Phase 2 
surveys, including a breeding bird survey.  These baseline surveys will be included in an appendix 
to an ecology chapter of an Environmental Statement, which is intended for submission, as an 
integral part of the application for Development Consent. 
Aims of Study 
2.6 
The survey work undertaken at Abergelli Farm between April and June 2014 aimed to establish: 
 
The number of species present on the Survey Site or the immediate surrounding habitat; 
 
The number of territories held by each species, and 
 
Whether the Survey Site or the immediate surrounding habitat is used by bird species of high 
conservation interest, including: 
a. 
Species protected under Schedule 1 of the Wildlife and Countryside Act 1981 (as 
amended); 
b. 
Species listed on Annex 1 of the Council Directive 79/409/EEC on the Conservation of 
Wild Birds; 
c. 
Species listed in Section 42 of the Natural Environment and Rural Communities Act 
(NERC 2006) as species of principal importance for the conservation of biodiversity in 
Wales; 
d. 
Species listed in the Swansea Local Biodiversity Action Plan (LBAP); and 
 
Abergelli Power Project – Breeding Bird Survey Report

10/03/2015 
e. 
Species listed as having a Red or Amber population status2 (RSPB, 2009). 
 
                                                      
2 Seven quantitative criteria are used to assess the population status of each bird species and to categorise it on the red, 
amber or green list of conservation concern (species that are red-listed are of greatest conservation concern whereas 
those that are green-listed are not considered to be of particular conservation priority or (in a few cases) have insufficient 
data to be robustly categorised). Criteria considered are: global conservation status; evidence of recent decline; evidence 
of historical decline; an unfavourable European conservation status; rarity (in terms of breeding numbers); restricted 
(localised) distribution; and whether a species is considered to be of international conservation importance (featuring in 
the list of birds in Annex 1 of the Birds Directive 1979).  When considering whether a species is added to the red or the 
amber list, factors such as the extent of decline and range contraction are considered.

Methods 
Desk Study 
3.1 
Existing ecological information for the Survey Site and its surrounding area was requested from the 
South East Wales Biodiversity Records Centre (SEWBReC). Information on designated sites was 
requested from within 10 km for European sites, 5 km for nationally designated sites and 2 km of 
the Survey Site for non-statutory sites. The latter search radius was also used for information on 
protected3 or notable species (particularly those identified as S42 species and/or of local 
conservation importance or LBAP4 species), including birds. In addition, an initial study of on-line 
aerial photographs, topographical, and Ordnance Survey maps was made using web-based 
resources including: Where’s the path?5, Google Maps6 and Google Earth Version 6 (Google Inc, 
2010). This, together with the results from a preliminary ecological appraisal7 carried out in 
February 2014 and updated in April 2014, resulted in a detailed understanding of the habitats and 
features on the Survey Site along with an indication of the bird community potentially present. 
Field Survey 
3.2 
The method used was adapted from the British Trust for Ornithology (BTO) Common Bird Census 
(CBC) as described by Gilbert et al. (1998), Although eight to ten visits are usually undertaken for 
CBC sites being monitored over the long term, it is generally accepted that for the purposes of 
assessing potential environmental impacts, three visits are sufficient to describe the value of a 
Survey Site for breeding birds and give an approximation of the number of breeding bird territories 
present within a Survey Site (e.g. SNH, 20058). Breeding birds were surveyed by walking along 
field boundaries and tracks within the Survey Site at a slow pace to enable all birds detected to be 
located, identified and recorded. Frequent stops were made to listen and scan for singing and 
calling birds.  All habitat features were approached to within approximately 50 m, except in horse 
pasture fields. Transects were not walked across closely grazed pasture fields, as it was possible 
to easily view birds by scanning from field boundaries (due to the lack of vegetation and small field 
sizes) and to avoid disturbing horses that were kept in many of them at the time of the survey. Bird 
locations were mapped using standard two-letter British Trust for Ornithology (BTO) codes, and 
bird activity was recorded using standard BTO behaviour codes (Marchant 1983).  
3.3 
The breeding status of birds recorded was categorised as either ‘holding territory’ or ‘showing other 
evidence of breeding’. Birds presumed to be holding territory were those recorded in song. Other 
evidence of breeding included observations of: 
 
Distraction display or injury feigning; 
 
Used nests or eggshells found (occupied or laid within the survey period); 
 
Recently fledged young or downy young; 
 
Adults entering or leaving a nest site in circumstances indicating an occupied nest or an adult 
sitting on nest; 
 
Adults carrying food for young or faecal sacs; 
 
Nest containing eggs; and 
 
Nest with young seen or heard. 
3.4 
The presence of house sparrow near a suitable nesting building was also taken as evidence for 
breeding in this species.

3.5 
The results of the three breeding bird territory mapping surveys were combined to create a single 
map showing all birds considered to be holding territory (Figures 1a and 1b in Appendix 1). BTO 
codes for each species illustrated in Figure 1a and 1b are provided in Table 2 (below). Where a 
bird was observed in the same location during more than one survey visit, and this is judged to be 
the same individual bird, only one registration of that bird is shown on the map. Where more than 
one individual of the same species is shown in close proximity, these are individual birds seen 
simultaneously during a single survey. Note the locations of presumed territories do not represent 
specific nest locations. 
3.6 
The Survey Site was divided into two survey compartments due to its size; the first covered the 
north of the Survey Site (the land north of the gallops that runs from the houses at Abergelli Farm 
to the south-east corner of the Survey Site), and the second covered the south of the Survey Site 
(the land south of the gallops).  Three survey visits were made to each compartment; one in each 
of late April, late May and mid-June.  Table 1 below provides details of the duration and weather 
conditions during surveys.

3.7 
The Felindre Gas Compressor Station and the National Grid electrical substation compounds to the 
south-west of the Survey Site were not entered, due to lack of access. The compounds can be 
viewed adequately from the fence and there is very little suitable habitat for breeding birds within 
these compounds. The land immediately beyond the northern and eastern Survey Site boundaries 
was also not entered. The surveyor(s) scanned areas of adjacent habitat by walking paths and field 
edges and made use of local vantage-points to record species present around the access 
restricted areas. This enabled the entire site to be sampled without trespassing. 
3.8 
In late June, all buildings within the Survey Site, with the exception of those within the National Grid 
compounds referred to above, were inspected for barn owl Tyto alba presence or other evidence of 
presence, such as pellets, nests, or faecal matter. The buildings were primarily visited to inspect for 
bat roosts and the methods are described in detail in the bat roost inspection report. Anecdotal 
evidence from the land owner prior to inspection suggested that none of the buildings were in use 
or had historically been used by barn owl. All trees within the Survey Site were also inspected from 
ground level for evidence of use by bats and barn owl. A sub-set of these trees were identified for 
further roped-access (tree-climbing) survey that involved internal and external inspection of these 
trees. Full details of these surveys are provided in the bat survey report. 
3.9 
The maps from the three visits were combined.  For species where definitive evidence of breeding 
was not obtained, professional judgement (based on a range of factors including knowledge of 
habitat requirements, local status and/or repeat sightings) was used to conclude whether breeding 
was likely.  A precautionary approach was taken, with species suspected to have bred being 
plotted as having done so. 
Survey Limitations 
3.10 
It was not possible to gain access to the access road to the south-west of the Felindre Gas 
Compressor Station and the two National Grid 400 kV electrical substations and also the land 
immediately surrounding these areas during the breeding bird surveys, as shown in Figure 1b. It is 
unlikely that this is a significant constraint to the surveys as the areas that could not be surveyed 
contain similar habitats to those within the areas that were surveyed and it is unlikely that they 
support any additional species that are protected or notable.

Results  
Desk Study Data 
4.1 
A full list of the European designated sites within 10 km, national statutory designated sites within 5 
km, and non-statutory designated sites within 2 km of the Survey Site boundary is provided in the 
preliminary ecological appraisal.  Sites that include a cited ornithological interest are described 
below. 
Statutory Sites of Nature Conservation Importance 
4.2 
Carmarthen Bay and the tidal estuaries that extend from it, approximately 7.2 km west of the 
Survey Site, has been afforded multiple designations and is referred to under the umbrella term 
European Marine Site (EMS9) which includes the Carmarthen Bay area and Estuaries Special Area 
of Conservation (SAC10), and the Burry Inlet Special Protection Area (SPA11). This area also 
contains a Ramsar Wetland of International Importance (Ramsar12). The boundaries of each of 
these sites are not contiguous but all fall within the EMS site. The details of each designation are 
provided below.  
4.3 
The Burry Inlet SPA and Ramsar, located approximately 9.7 km west south-west of the Survey 
Site, is classified for large numbers of overwintering wildfowl and waders that feed in the 
saltmarshes and on the intertidal mud and sand. 
4.4 
The SPA has been classified as it supports important overwintering populations of eleven migratory 
species of waterfowl and an assemblage of 34,962 wintering water fowl including common 
shelduck Tadorna tadorna, Eurasian wigeon Anas penelope, Eurasian teal Anas crecca, northern 
pintail Anas acuta, shoveler Anas clypeata, Eurasian oystercatcher Haematopus ostralegus, grey 
plover Pluvialis squatarola,  red knot Calidris canutus, dunlin Calidris alpina alpina, Eurasian curlew 
Numenius arquata, and common redshank Tringa totanus.  The SPA includes extensive areas of 
intertidal sand and mud-flats, large sand dune systems and the largest continuous area of 
saltmarsh in Wales. 
4.5 
The spring and autumn population of common redshank, and wintering population of northern 
pintail, Eurasian oystercatcher, and red knot are qualifying features for the Burry Inlet Ramsar 
designation. 
4.6 
The Carmarthen Bay and Estuaries SAC, located approximately 7.2 km to the west, is designated 
for its ‘Sandbanks which are slightly covered by sea water all the time’, ‘Estuaries’, ‘Mudflats and 
sandflats not covered by water at low tide’, ‘Large shallow inlets and bays’, ‘Salicornia and other 
annuals colonising mud and sand’, and ‘Atlantic salt meadows’. 
Non-Statutory Sites 
4.7 
There are 23 Sites of Interest for Nature Conservation (SINC) within 2 km of the Survey Site. 
These are described in detail in the preliminary ecological appraisal.  Three SINCs lie partially 
within the Survey Site boundary, of which two have cited ornithological interest. 
4.8 
Rhyd-Y-Pandy Valley Grasslands is a large SINC, which includes three fields that lie within the 
north-east corner of the Survey Site. The site is designated for its wet woodland and woodland with 
                                                      
9 The term ‘European Marine Sites’ (EMS) collectively describes Special Areas of Conservation (SACs) and Special 
Protection Areas (SPAs) that are covered by tidal waters and protect some of our most important marine and coastal 
habitats and species of European importance. 
10 SACs are strictly protected sites designated under the EC Habitats Directive in order to conserve the 189 habitat 
types and 788 faunal species identified in Annexes I and II of the Directive (as amended).  They do not afford protection 
to birds directly (although are often subject to various other designations that do have an ornithological component and 
often offer protection to habitats of value to a range of bird species).   
11 SPAs are internationally important sites classified in accordance with Directive 79/409/EEC on the conservation of wild 
birds (commonly referred to as the Bird Directive).   
12 Ramsar sites are wetlands of international importance designated under the Ramsar Convention.

4.14 
The Penllergaer Forest SINC is designated for its range of woodland types, purple moor grass and 
rush pasture, reedbeds and watercourses.  Species of bird listed on the SINC form include 
Northern goshawk, common kingfisher Alcedo atthis, lesser redpoll, common cuckoo, lesser 
spotted woodpecker Picoides minor, common grasshopper warbler, common crossbill Loxia 
curvirostra, red kite, house sparrow, wood warbler Phylloscopus sibilatrix, green woodpecker, 
willow tit, common bullfinch, common starling and song thrush. It is unclear what the status of these 
species on the SINC is. 
4.15 
Penllegaer to Llangyfelach Tunnel and Railway Line SINC is also designated for its range of 
woodland types, purple moor grass and rush pasture, scrub and watercourses. Species of bird 
listed on the SINC form include tree pipit, lesser redpoll, common bullfinch, and song thrush. It is 
unclear what the status of these species on the SINC is. 
4.16 
Most of the woodland within the Survey Site is also designated as Ancient Woodland. 
Species Data 
4.17 
SEWBReC provided 21 records of barn owl. The closest of these records is 0.7 km to the west of 
the Survey Site boundary from 1997, with the nearest breeding record 3 km to the south west near 
Penllergaer Woods in 2000. The most recent record is from approximately 3.7 km north-west of the 
Survey Site in April 2013. An additional 5 records were provided for the last 10 years, the nearest 
of which was recorded in 2007, approximately 2 km south-west of the Survey Site,   
4.18 
A red kite was noted circling above a field in the north-west corner of the Survey Site and also over 
Abergelli Farm during the Phase 1 Survey in April 2014. SEWBReC provided 54 records for red 
kite between 1999 and 2013, the record nearest the Survey Site being approximately 150 m to the 
east.

4.19 
SEWBReC provided a number of records of ground nesting birds in the search area.  These 
included records for Eurasian curlew, northern lapwing and skylark.  A total of 63 records of 
lapwing were provided from between 2000 and 2009, all south of the Survey Site.  The closest of 
these records are located at the tinplate workings site near to Bryn Whilach Farm, approximately 1 
km to the south-west of the Survey Site boundary.  There was one record of curlew from 2011, 
located at the Lliw Reservoir, 1 km north of the Survey Site boundary.

13 The number of territories where other evidence was found to confirm breeding is indicated. Other evidence of breeding 
was considered to include observations of adults carrying nesting material or food, adults being repeatedly alarmed or 
engaging in territorial disputes, and families including juveniles accompanied by adults. The presence of house sparrow 
near a suitable nesting building was also taken as evidence for breeding in this species.

Twenty eight species of passerine were noted holding breeding territories on the Survey Site. An 
additional two species, lesser redpoll and house sparrow, were observed showing other evidence 
of breeding. 
4.24 
No passerine species listed under Schedule 1 Part 1 of the Wildlife & Countryside Act 1981 (as 
amended)14 were recorded. 
4.25 
Nine S42 species (cuckoo, dunnock, grasshopper warbler, house sparrow, linnet, lesser redpoll, 
skylark, song thrush, and tree pipit) were considered likely to breed on the Survey Site. All nine 
S42 species recorded within the Survey Site are also listed in the Swansea LBAP15, and are red-
listed species of conservation concern in Wales (RSPB Undated), with the exception of dunnock 
(which is amber-listed).  An additional seven amber-listed species, bullfinch, mistle thrush, meadow 
pipit, reed bunting, redstart, whitethroat and willow warbler were also considered to have bred. 
4.26 
Willow warbler was the most abundant breeding species on the Survey Site. Large numbers of 
territories were also held by other passerines typical of a lowland farmland mosaic habitat including 
chiffchaff, chaffinch, robin and wren. Of the S42 species recorded, dunnock and song thrush were 
most abundant, with territories widely distributed across the Survey Site. The abundance of willow 
warbler, dunnock and song thrush on the Survey Site may be attributed to the relatively wide-
ranging habitat preferences of these generalist species (and the tendency of the former two 
species to breed in scrub).  
4.27 
The presence of ground nesting species (skylark and meadow pipit) within the Survey Site reflects 
the fact that much of the Survey Site is grazed pasture. However, the distribution of these species 
was localised, only being recorded in the pasture fields in the north-west of the Survey Site. Other 
species recorded on the pasture habitat during survey in April include stonechat, for which two 
territories were recorded, and northern wheatear Oenanthe oenanthe which were likely to have 
been on passage and not remained to breed on site (see Incidental Records below). Stonechat and 
wheatear were not recorded during breeding bird surveys in May and June.  
4.28 
Grasshopper warbler was associated with marshy areas in the north-western part of the Survey 
Site which reflect the species’ breeding habitat preferences. The species was only recorded during 
survey in April. No further records were made during dusk bat surveys or moth trap surveys carried 
out on the Survey Site during 2014. All registrations of cuckoo were beyond the Survey Site 
boundary. These were recorded near Lletty’r Bugail, approximately 300 m north of the Survey Site 
and at Waun y Garn-wen, and approximately 100 m west of the Survey Site, during survey in April 
                                                      
14 Schedule 1 birds receive full protection under the Wildlife and Countryside Act 1981 (as amended), In addition to the 
protection from killing or taking that all birds, their nests and eggs have under the Act, Schedule 1 birds and their young 
must not be disturbed at the nest. 
15 Based on the 2005 consultation draft of the Swansea LBAP. The forthcoming replacement to this plan will be expected 
to reflect Section 42 Species and Habitats more closely.

and near a pond, north of Cefn-betingau, approximately 100 m east of the Survey Site during 
survey in May.  
4.29 
House sparrow colonies were recorded at the barn north of Abergelli Farm during all survey visits 
and at the Abergelli Farm buildings during the survey in May and June. The individual count was 26 
during the visit in April, 20 during the survey in May and 18 during the survey in June. Therefore, 
the number of breeding pairs within the Survey Site is likely to be between nine and 13. 
4.30 
A family of lesser redpoll were observed in scrub bordering the marshy grassland to the west of the 
Survey Site during the survey in June. Two birds were also recorded in this area during the survey 
in April. No further evidence of breeding in this species was recorded. Observations of single 
individuals were made near the Felindre Gas Compressor Station and National Grid electrical 
substation during survey in May and June. 
4.31 
Three tree pipit territories were recorded during survey. These were recorded immediately south of 
the gallops at the centre of the Survey Site in May and around the fringes of marshy grassland in 
the western part of the Survey Site and in the scrub line on the north-east corner of the Survey Site 
in June. Tree pipit were recorded during all survey visits, with flocks of up to 14 observed over the 
marshy grassland in the western part of the Survey Site during survey work in May. A family of tree 
pipit were recorded on a field boundary in the south-east corner of the Survey Site in June. Two 
pairs of tree pipit were observed immediately south of the gallops at the centre of the Survey Site in 
June. It is likely that these records are of breeding pairs. 
4.32 
Indicative central territory locations are shown on Figures 1a and 1b in Appendix 1. 
Non-Passerines 
4.33 
Red kite were recorded during surveys in April and May. A bird was noted flying over the houses at 
Abergelli Farm and over the pasture in the northern part of the Survey Site during the survey in 
April. Two red kites were recorded mobbing a peregrine falcon over the Felindre Gas Compressor 
Station land during the survey in May. An apparent pair was also recorded flying over the eastern 
boundary in the northern compartment of the Survey Site during the same survey day. Given the 
timing of the records, and that at least one pair was recorded during the survey in May it is likely 
that red kite breed locally. However, no evidence was found to suggest breeding occurred within 
the Survey Site during 2014.  
4.34 
Red kite are listed under Schedule 1 Part 1 of the Wildlife & Countryside Act 1981 (as amended) 
and Annex 1 of the Council Directive 79/409/EEC on the Conservation of Wild Birds making it an 
offence to intentionally or recklessly disturb birds at, on or near an ‘active’ nest, or to directly 
threaten birds, such as deliberately kill or capture birds, destroy their nests or take their eggs. 
4.35 
A peregrine falcon was observed flying over the Felindre Gas Compressor Station and National 
Grid electrical substation during survey in May. There is limited suitable breeding habitat within the 
Survey Site for peregrine falcon, and therefore this species is only likely to visit the Survey Site to 
forage on an occasional basis. Electricity pylons within the Survey Site were scanned from the 
ground for the presence of peregrine (and corvid) nests. No evidence of crow nests, which are 
sometimes appropriated by peregrine were found. Peregrine falcon is listed under Schedule 1 Part 
1 of the Wildlife & Countryside Act 1981 (as amended). 
4.36 
It is possible that some of the farm buildings within the Survey Site may support breeding barn owl, 
although no trees were found that appear, from a ground level inspection, to have sufficiently large 
cavities to support nesting barn owls. The marshy fields in the north-west and at the southern end 
of the Survey Site could provide habitat for field vole Microtus agrestis (a preferred prey species) 
given the thick, tussocky structure of some parts of the sward. There was no evidence that barn 
owl breed within the Survey Site, and are unlikely to have done so in the recent past due to lack of 
droppings in the buildings and anecdotal evidence to this effect from the landowner. No signs of 
barn owl presence were found during building inspections and no birds were recorded during the 
breeding bird surveys.

Incidental Records 
4.37 
Species recorded during other survey work in the bird breeding season but not recorded during 
breeding bird surveys are described below. 
4.38 
Ten male and two female wheatear were observed on the horse pasture in the northern part of the 
Survey Site during a bat transect recce on 24 April 2014, and were presumably transient migrant 
birds.  
4.39 
Young tawny owls Strix aluco were heard calling near the houses in the western part of the Survey 
Site during a moth survey on 16 June, with birds of unknown age heard during a second survey on 
13 August 2014. This suggests that tawny owl bred on the Survey Site in 2014, presumably in the 
woodland block immediately to the south-west of Abergelli Farm, although much of the woodland 
within the Survey Site is suitable nesting habitat for this species. No further observations of tawny 
owl were made. A goshawk (female) was observed flying over the Survey Site at dusk on 16 June, 
and a sparrowhawk Accipiter nisus, was recorded roosting in a tree near the aforementioned 
houses on 13 August. 
4.40 
Red kite were observed flying over the marshy grassland in the western part of the Survey Site 
during a dormouse survey on 29 May, and near Abergelli Farm during bat transect surveys on 22 
May and 17 July 2014.Single red kites flying over the Survey Site were also recorded during Phase 
1 habitat surveys on 24 February 2014 and 14 April 2014. 
4.41 
A spotted flycatcher Muscicapa striata was recorded in the hedge-line near the two houses on 17 
June 2014. Spotted flycatcher is a S42 species of principal importance in Wales, is listed in the 
Swansea LBAP and is a red-listed species of conservation concern in Wales (RSPB, 2009).

Summary 
1.1 
Abergelli Power Limited (APL) is promoting a new Power Generation Plant with its associated Gas 
and Electricity Connections (the ‘Project’) on agricultural land within Abergelli Farm north of 
Swansea in the City and County of Swansea (approximately at National Grid Reference 265284, 
201431). 
1.2 
A Habitat Suitability Index (HSI) assessment for great crested newts Triturus cristatus (GCN) was 
carried out at accessible ponds as part of the preliminary ecological appraisal of the Project Site at 
the time of the survey (hereafter referred to as the ‘Survey Site’). The results of the HSI 
assessment are set out in the Preliminary Ecological Appraisal (BSG, June 2014). APL 
subsequently commissioned BSG Ecology to undertake a presence/absence survey for GCN of 
ponds within 150 ha of pastoral farmland at and around Abergelli Farm in May 2014, to inform and 
support an application for Development Consent for the Project.  
1.3 
Owing to the size and nature of the Survey Site, and the lack of GCN records in the desk study 
search area, it was recommended that a survey for GCNs be conducted for all ponds within the 
Survey Site boundary and within 250 m of the Survey Site boundary. A total of five ponds were 
surveyed including three within the Survey Site and a further two within 250 m of the Survey Site 
boundary. It was not possible to access a number of ponds, which included: 
 
seven ponds outside of the Survey Site but within 250 m of the Survey Site boundary; and 
 
a further four ponds between 250m and 500m from the Survey Site boundary that formed part 
of a cluster of ponds, the remainder of which were within 250m of the Survey Site boundary. 
1.4 
The survey did not record any GCNs in the ponds surveyed, although palmate newts Lissotriton 
helveticus were recorded in three ponds and smooth newts Lissotriton vulgaris were recorded in 
two ponds. As a consequence, further surveys to establish the population size class of GCN were 
not necessary and were not undertaken.

Introduction 
 
2.1 
Abergelli Power Limited commissioned BSG Ecology to undertake a presence/absence GCN 
survey in May 2014 to inform and support an application for Development Consent for the Project 
described below.  
Site Description 
2.2 
The Survey Site consists of approximately 150 ha of pastoral farmland primarily grazed by horses. 
The extent of the Survey Site is shown in Figure 1 in Appendix 1 and is centred at National Grid 
Reference 265284, 201431. The nearest settlement is Felindre, which is located approximately 2 
km to the north of the Survey Site, with Swansea approximately 5 km to the south.    
2.3 
The Survey Site is largely agriculturally improved pasture with several areas of marshy grassland, 
particularly in the north, south and north-western ends of the Survey Site. The fields are bounded 
by fences, running along the line of defunct hedgerows, and often accompanied by ditches. There 
is a block of broadleaved woodland on the eastern boundary of the Survey Site and other areas of 
woodland around the marshy grassland to the west of the Survey Site, and around Felindre Gas 
Compressor Station and the two National Grid 400 kV electrical substations that lie at the south-
west end of the Survey Site.  The habitats in the surrounding landscape are similar to those within 
the Survey Site boundary – a mixture of improved and marshy grassland interspersed with 
occasional patches of woodland. 
Description of Project 
2.4 
APL is promoting a new Power Generation Plant with associated Gas and Electricity Connections 
within Abergelli Farm.  The Power Generation Plant would operate as a Simple Cycle Gas Turbine 
(SCGT) peaking plant and would be designed to provide an electrical capacity of up to 299 
Megawatts (MW).  It would be fuelled by natural gas, supplied by a new underground gas pipeline 
connecting the Power Generation Plant to the existing National Grid Gas (NGG) National 
Transmission System (NTS).  It would also connect to the National Grid Electrical Transmission 
System (NETS) via underground cable or overhead lines. 
2.5 
BSG Ecology has been appointed as the ecological consultant to undertake an ecology survey, 
which includes a desk study and Extended Phase 1 Habitat Survey as well as a range of Phase 2 
surveys, including presence / absence survey for GCNs. These baseline surveys will be included in 
an appendix to an ecology chapter of an Environmental Statement, which is intended for 
submission, in support of the application for Development Consent. 
Aims of Study 
2.6 
The aims of the GCN survey were to identify whether GCNs are present in the ponds within the 
Survey Site and those within 250 m of the Survey Site boundary using standard survey methods 
(as specified in Section 3).

Methods 
Desk Study 
3.1 
Existing ecological information for the Survey Site and its surrounding area was requested from the 
South East Wales Biodiversity Records Centre (SEWBReC).  Information on protected1 species, 
including GCNs, was requested covering the Survey Site and land up to 2 km from the Survey Site 
boundary. The National Biodiversity Network Gateway2 was also checked for records for 1 x 1 km 
grid squares in which GCN records have occurred. In addition, on-line mapping and aerial 
photography of the area were also reviewed to identify ponds that might be present within the 
Survey Site and 500 m of the boundary based on recommendations made in the Natural England 
(formerly English Nature) GCN Mitigation Guidelines3 (the selection of an appropriate buffer 
distance for survey is explained in more detail below). 
Scoping (HSI) Survey 
3.2 
A Preliminary Ecological Appraisal was carried out by BSG Ecology in February 2014 and updated 
in April 20144. As part of this survey, all accessible ponds within 250 m of the Survey Site were 
visited and assessed against the criteria of Oldham et al. (2000)5. This was to establish the 
likelihood of their use by GCNs using a Habitat Suitability Index (HSI), and to identify the scope of 
the GCN presence/absence field survey described below.  
3.3 
The information collected during the HSI assessment provides context of how ponds within or in 
proximity to the Survey Site may connect with habitat available for newts in the surrounding 
landscape, and also to give greater confidence to the assessment carried out on each pond.  
3.4 
Information on the physical features and characteristics of each pond within 250 m of the Survey 
Site was collected, to enable an HSI score to be derived for each pond, by applying the scoring 
system developed by the Herpetological Conservation Trust (HCT, 2008)6. Where a cluster of 
ponds was found (P01-P08; see Figure 1) with some ponds within 250 m of the Survey Site and 
some ponds beyond this distance, the intention was to carry out an HSI on all ponds within the 
cluster (although lack of access prevented this in this case).   
3.5 
The HSI is calculated by allocating scores to features associated with each pond including features 
such as size, quality of surrounding habitat and presence of fish. These scores are then used to 
calculate the overall HSI for each pond as a number between 0 and 1, with 0 being the least 
suitable and 1 being the most suitable. The HSI score allows each pond to be placed in one of five 
categories defining its suitability for GCNs as follows: 
 
<0.5  
 
= poor 
 
0.5 – 0.59 
= below average 
 
0.6 – 0.69 
= average 
 
0.7 – 0.79 
= good 
 
>0.8  
 
= excellent 
3.6 
In addition, there are a number of wet ditches present within the Survey Site and within 250 m of 
the Survey Site boundary. All of the wet ditches are narrow (<1 m width) and did not hold more 
than a few centimetres of water during February – June 2014 despite an exceptionally wet winter.

They are not thought to provide suitable habitat for GCNs and presence / absence surveys are not 
considered to be required for these waterbodies.  
Field Survey 
3.7 
Following the initial HSI assessment (see above) four GCN survey visits were undertaken within 
the period mid-March to mid-June to establish presence/absence (with at least two surveys during 
mid-April to mid-May), with an additional two surveys (six in total) required to estimate population 
size if GCN were found during the first four surveys. The GCN field survey work was undertaken in 
2014 and was completed in accordance with the Natural England (2001) GCN Mitigation 
Guidelines.  
3.8 
In determining the distance at which presence/absence survey of ponds would take place, Natural 
England guidance has been considered and an approach developed that is proportionate to the 
likelihood of encountering GCNs (Note that where a survey is conducted in Wales, Natural 
Resources Wales advise that the Natural England guidance is consulted.) 
3.9 
Natural England guidance on geographical limits of survey is discussed in Section 5.4 of the GCN 
Mitigation Guidelines which recommends that:  
“For a common situation, where a plot of land containing a pond is proposed for development, the 
pond itself should be surveyed, and other ponds up to 500 m away should also be checked, if it is 
thought likely that great crested newt populations centred on these ponds would be affected by 
changes to the plot.” 
3.10 
Natural England guidance is further developed in the GCN Method Statement7  which states that:  
“In keeping with a proportionate and risk-based approach, surveys need reasonable boundaries. 
The great crested newt mitigation guidelines explain that surveys of ponds up to around 500m from 
the development might need to be surveyed. The decision on whether to survey depends primarily 
on how likely it is that the development would affect newts using those ponds. For developments 
resulting in permanent or temporary habitat loss at distances over 250m from the nearest pond, 
carefully consider whether a survey is appropriate. Surveys of land at this distance from ponds are 
normally appropriate when all of the following conditions are met: (a) maps, aerial photos, walk-
over surveys or other data indicate that the pond(s) has potential to support a large great crested 
newt population, (b) the footprint contains particularly favourable habitat, especially if it constitutes 
the majority available locally, (c) the development would have a substantial negative effect on that 
habitat, and (d) there is an absence of dispersal barriers.” 
3.11 
The approach that has been taken for these field surveys is consistent with the above guidance 
and advice from Natural England. Where access was available, presence/absence surveys for 
GCN were carried out on all ponds within 250 m of the Project Site. The exception to this were 
pond clusters that are interconnected to each other (less than 250 m apart) and which therefore 
could be considered to be part of the same population (should GCN be found). However, no such 
ponds (P01-P08 and P012-P014) were accessible as shown on Figure 1. As explained in the 
limitations section below, it is not considered to be a significant constraint to the findings of the 
survey that some ponds could not be accessed. 
Limitations of study 
3.12 
The GCN field surveys were undertaken within the recommended survey period and in suitable 
weather conditions apart from the torchlight survey and egg search on 19/05/2014 where heavy 
rain occurred leaving some ponds turbid, making survey less effective for a short period. 
Nevertheless, the surveys were considered to be effective despite the reduced visibility. 
3.13 
Two ponds (P07 and P08) located within the Water Treatment Works to the northwest of Project 
Site that were classified during the HSI assessment as being of ‘average’ or ‘good’ value for GCNs 
could not be surveyed due to access not being granted by landowners. In addition, access was not 
granted by landowners to Ponds P01, P02, P03, P04, P05, P06, P12, P13 and P14, which would 
have been surveyed for presence/absence of GCN, had access been possible.

3.14 
In considering the significance of not surveying the inaccessible ponds both within and beyond 250 
m from the Project Site, it is useful to examine the results of the presence / absence surveys for 
those ponds that could be surveyed, as well as the results of the desk study, which places the 
Survey Site into a wider context (see 4.1). The presence/absence survey did not reveal the 
presence of GCNs in any of the five ponds surveyed, although three of the ponds supported 
smooth and /or palmate newts and were also thought to provide suitable habitat for GCNs. This 
included all ponds within the Survey Site, three of which were of ‘average’ suitability as derived 
from the Habitat Suitability Assessment. The Survey Site is on the edge of the known range of 
GCN and the lack of desk study records within 2 km of the Survey Site is consistent with this, as is 
a search of the National Biodiversity Network website where the closest record of GCN was 
approximately 7.5 km from the Survey Site.  
3.15 
The conclusion that may be drawn is that since suitable ponds within the Survey Site were not 
occupied by GCNs, and no GCN records have been located within 7 km of the Survey Site, it is 
unlikely that GCNs are present in the inaccessible ponds. Notwithstanding this, if any of the ponds 
that were not surveyed (most are beyond 250 m from the Survey Site) did indeed support GCNs, it 
is likely that they would be present in such low numbers and at a sufficient distance from the 
Survey Site as to be unaffected by the Project. A Natural England funded research report into 
trapping efficiency on sites where GCNs are present (Cresswell and Whitworth, 2004) supports this 
assertion. It arrives at the conclusion that very few animals were captured at distances greater than 
100 m from a breeding pond. As a consequence, it is not considered to be a significant constraint 
to the findings of the survey that some ponds could not be surveyed.

Results  
Desk Study 
4.1 
No records of GCNs within 2 km of the Survey Site were returned by SEWBReC.  The closest 1 x 1 
km Grid Square in which GCN records have occurred is ca. 7.5 km to the south-east of the Survey 
Site, near Llandarcy8. 
Scoping survey 
4.2 
Twelve ponds were identified within 250 m of the Survey Site boundary with the aid of aerial 
photographs and OS maps.  Of these, two (P16 and P17) were identified within the Survey Site 
boundary, 10 (P05, P06, P07, P08, P09, P10, P12, P13, P14, and P15) were located within 250 m 
of the Survey Site and another four (P01, P02, P03, and P04) beyond 250m of the Survey Site but 
forming part of a cluster of ponds (with P05-P08) within the Water Treatment Works to north-west 
of the Survey Site. An additional on-site pond (P11) was found whilst carrying out other survey 
work on 21 May 2014 in the marshy grassland in the north-west of the Survey Site. An HSI 
assessment was carried out on the seven ponds that were accessible within 250 m of the Survey 
Site boundary during the first Phase 1 survey visit (in February).  This included: the two on-site 
ponds (P16 and P17); one pond within 100 m of the Survey Site boundary (P15); and ponds within 
250 m of the Survey Site boundary for which access was possible (P07, P08, P09 and P10). An 
HSI assessment was also carried out on P11 following its discovery in May 2014.

The Survey Site lies in a part of Wales where the distribution of GCNs is patchy, with the species 
largely absent to the west of the Survey Site. Whilst this reduces the probability that GCNs would 
be present within the Survey Site, it does not rule out their presence.  There are a number of ponds 
in and around the Survey Site, and suitable habitat for newts in their terrestrial phase, including old 
hedge banks, marshy grassland and woodland within the Survey Site.  Accordingly, whilst the 
ponds surveyed did not have a ‘good’ or ‘excellent’ HSI score, they did have potential to provide 
breeding habitat for GCNs.  
4.6 
The scoping exercise concluded that surveys should be carried out on all ponds within 250 m of the 
Survey Site boundary, except P09, which was a small recession with a small amount of water in 
February and completely dry in April. In addition the cluster of inaccessible ponds within the 
grounds of the water treatment works (to the north-west of the Survey Site) are likely to be of 
similar ‘good’ quality as Pond 08 (which was visible through the gate) and it was concluded that 
surveys of this cluster of ponds (including P01, P02, P03 and P04) should also be carried out 
following the rationale explained in Section 3.7.

4.7 
GCN presence-absence surveys were carried out on Ponds P10, P11, P15, P16, and P17. P15 
dried out completely between the first and second visits and was only surveyed once. The ponds 
within the Water Treatment Works (P01-P08), including four ponds beyond 250m from the Survey 
Site could not be surveyed: access to these ponds was denied on grounds of Health & Safety. In 
addition, access was denied to the cluster of three ponds (P12-P14) to the east of the Survey Site. 
The land surrounding these ponds contains Japanese Knotweed Fallopia japonica (an invasive 
species) and is subject to an exclusion and treatment programme which precludes access to third-
parties due to the risk of spreading the plant. 
4.8 
Surveys between May 12th and May 22nd were carried out by Stephanie Boocock MCIEEM under 
the class licence (WML-CL08) with assistance from Caitlin McCann, Owain Waters and Rachel 
Taylor. For Pond 11, which was identified late during other surveys, the third and fourth visits were 
carried out by Matthew Hobbs MCIEEM under license number (52219:OTH:SA:2014) with 
assistance from Rachel Taylor and Gareth Lang. On each visit, weather conditions, including air 
temperature were recorded. Table 1 gives details of the surveys.

The likely absence of GCNs was established for all five ponds surveyed in 2014 the four presence / 
absence surveys. Additional surveys to make a population size class assessment were not 
required (following Natural England 2001).

Summary 
1.1 
Abergelli Power Limited (APL) is promoting a new Power Generation Plant with its 
associated Gas and Electricity Connections (the ‘Project’) on agricultural land within 
Abergelli Farm, north of Swansea in the City and County of Swansea (approximately at 
National Grid Reference 265284, 201431). 
1.2 
A desk study undertaken as part of the Preliminary Ecological Appraisal (PEA) returned 
records of the common reptile species: adder Vipera berus, grass snake Natrix natrix, 
common lizard Zootoca vivipara and slow worm Anguis fragilis within 2 km of the Project 
Site boundary. Suitable habitat to support these species was identified within the Project 
Site boundary at the time of the survey (hereafter referred to as the ‘Survey Site’).  
1.3 
APL commissioned BSG Ecology to undertake a reptile survey of all suitable habitat for 
reptiles within the Survey Site boundary. Habitats selected for survey included marshy 
grassland areas, scrubby woodland edges, overgrown field margins either along remnant 
hedge or ditch banks.  
1.4 
Seven surveys visits were carried out during August and September 2014, during which 
the presence of common lizard and grass snake was confirmed within the Survey Site. 
1.5 
317 refugia were deployed in 33 ha of habitat identified as being suitable to support 
reptiles within the Survey Site, achieving a density of 9.6 refugia per ha. The Survey Site 
was split into four Areas in order to describe the distribution of reptile records 
1.6 
A peak count of 50 common lizard was recorded on 26 August 2014; common lizard was 
recorded in all areas surveyed, with highest numbers recorded in Areas 1 and 3 in the 
marshy grassland areas in the north-west of the Survey Site and the east of the Survey 
Site respectively.  The presence of juveniles and gravid females confirms breeding on the 
Survey Site.   
1.7 
A peak count of five grass snake was recorded during the survey on 26 August 2014.  All 
observations of grass snake were made in Area 3, in the marshy grassland close to the 
pond in the east of the Survey Site.  The presence of juvenile animals suggests that a 
breeding population is present on the Survey Site.

Introduction 
2.1 
Abergelli Power Limited (APL) commissioned BSG Ecology to undertake a reptile survey 
in May/June 2014 to inform and support an application for Development Consent for the 
Project described below. 
Site Description 
2.2 
The Survey Site consists of approximately 150 ha of pastoral farmland, primarily grazed 
by horses. The extent of the Survey Site is shown on Figures 1a and 1b, Appendix 1 as 
illustrated by the red line boundary. It is centred at National Grid Reference 265284, 
201431. The nearest settlement is Felindre, which is located approximately 2 km to the 
north of the Survey Site, with Swansea approximately 5km to the south. 
2.3 
The Survey Site is largely agriculturally improved pasture with several areas of marshy 
grassland particularly in the north, south and north-western extents of the Survey Site. 
The fields are bounded by fences, running along the line of defunct hedgerows, and often 
accompanied by ditches. There is a block of broadleaved woodland on the eastern 
boundary of the Survey Site and other areas of woodland around the marshy grassland to 
the west of the Survey Site, and around Felindre Gas Compressor Station and the two 
National Grid 400kV electric substations that lie at the south-west end of the Survey Site. 
The habitats in the surrounding landscape are similar to those within the Survey Site 
boundary – a mixture of improved and marshy grassland interspersed with occasional 
patches of woodland. 
Description of Project 
2.4 
APL is promoting a new Power Generation Plant with associated Gas and Electricity 
Connections within Abergelli Farm. The Power Generation Plant would operate as a 
Simple Cycle Gas Turbine (SCGT) peaking plant and would be designed to provide an 
electrical capacity of up to 299 Megawatts (MW). It would be fuelled by natural gas, 
supplied by new underground gas pipelines connecting the Power Generation Plant to 
the existing National Grid Gas (NGG) National Transmission System (NTS). It would also 
connect to the National Grid Electrical Transmission System (NETS) via underground 
cables or overhead lines. 
2.5 
BSG Ecology has been appointed as the ecological consultant to undertake ecology 
surveys, which include a PEA as well as a range of Phase 2 surveys, including a reptile 
survey. These baseline surveys will be included in an appendix to an ecology chapter of 
an Environmental Statement, which is intended for submission in support of the 
application for Development Consent.  
Aims of Study 
2.6 
The aims of the reptile survey within the Survey Site were to: 
 
Assess where habitats within the Survey Site have the potential to support reptiles; and 
 
Establish the likely presence/absence of each species and, if present, their distribution within 
the Survey Site.

Methods 
Desk Study 
3.1 
Existing ecological records for European and nationally protected2 species, including 
reptiles was requested from the South East Wales Biodiversity Records Centre 
(SEWBReC).  Records were provided for the Survey Site and a 2km buffer area beyond 
the Survey Site boundary. On-line mapping and aerial photography of the area was also 
reviewed in May 2014 to identify potential reptile habitat present within the Survey Site. 
Scoping Survey 
3.2 
During the PEA carried out by BSG Ecology in February 2014, which was subsequently 
updated in April and July 2014, habitats within the Survey Site that had the potential to 
support common species of reptile were identified. The following areas were identified as 
containing habitats suitable to support reptiles: 
 
Area 1: An extensive area of marshy grassland / wet modified bog in the north-west of the 
Survey Site and a smaller area of road verge on the edge of semi-improved marshy grassland; 
 
Area 2: Areas of overgrown grassland, open ground and scrub as well as overgrown field 
margins along either remnant hedge banks or ditches in the north-east of the Survey Site;  
 
Area 3: Wood piles, overgrown banks, scrubby woodland fringes and marshy grassland  areas 
in the east of the Survey Site, as well as dry grassland and scrub bordering the gallops in the 
centre of the Survey Site; and 
 
Area 4: Dry grassland and scrub along the periphery of the Felindre Gas Compressor Station 
and the two National Grid 400kV electric substations, as well as areas of marshy grassland on 
the periphery of these habitats, in the south-west extent of the Survey Site. 
3.3 
The areas assessed as being suitable for reptiles are shown on Figures 1a and 1b in 
Appendix 1. 
Field Survey 
3.4 
The reptile survey was undertaken in accordance with best practice guidance, as set out 
in the Herpetofauna Worker’s Manual (Gent et al., 2003) and guidelines for reptile survey 
published by Froglife (1999). A total of seven visits were made to each refugia during late 
August and September 2014.   This period is within the optimum survey period for 
reptiles. 
3.5 
A survey was carried out to establish the likely presence/absence of each reptile species 
and, if present, their distribution through the Survey Site. This included the placement of 
317 artificial refugia comprising of 50 x 50 cm roofing felt sections, which were placed 
within suitable habitats within the Survey Site (shown on Figures 1a and 1b in Appendix 
1). In total approximnately 33 ha (approximately 22% of the total Survey Site area) of 
suitable reptile habitat was identified within the Survey Site, this means that the survey 
attained a refugia density of 9.6 refugia per hectare which approaches the upper limit of 
the guideline density of 5-10 refugia per hectare of suitable reptile habitat (Froglife, 1999). 
3.6 
Best practice guidance recommends that refugia are allowed to “bed in” for a minimum of 
one week before the survey commences. The “bedding in” period allows vegetation to die 
back beneath the refugia creating a close fit to the ground and allowing the development 
of suitable humidity and temperature conditions. It also allows time for reptiles to locate 
and become accustomed to the refugia. Refugia in Area 1 were deployed on 16 April 
2014, and the remainder of the refugia deployed on 11 August 2014.  The first survey 
visit was undertaken on 22 August giving a minimum bedding in period of 11 days.  
3.7 
During each survey, refugia were approached carefully so that any reptiles basking on 
top of them could be observed before they were disturbed by the surveyor. Once the 
 
Abergelli Power Project – Reptile Survey Report 
 
8 
10/03/2015 
refugia had been inspected for basking reptiles, the refugia were carefully lifted and 
checked for any reptiles sheltering underneath.  
3.8 
Some areas initially assessed as being suitable for reptiles were not included in the 
refugia survey either due to a change in landuse such as ploughing or due to the regular 
grazing by horses as the presence of horses means that the refugia were at risk of 
trampling, with an inherant risk of injury to reptiles sheltering underneath, Figures 1a and 
1b reflect this with some areas of suitable habitat not containg artificial refugia as part of 
the survey. 
Direct Observation 
3.9 
The surveyors made visual searches whilst on site by slowly walking between refugia and 
watching for signs of movement. Any existing refugia (e.g. pieces of wood, stones) were 
also checked where appropriate. A supplimentary direct observation survey aims to 
eliminate bias towards recording those reptile species more likely to use refugia.  
Reptile Survey Details  
3.10 
Surveys were conducted during optimum weather conditions, generally dry, with low 
wind, lightly overcast or hazy sunshine, and a temperature range of 9-18°C (Froglife, 
1999; Gent & Gibson, 20031). This temperature range includes the optimum temperature 
ranges for recording most of the widespread UK species of reptile (see Table 1, below).  
3.11 
Due to the large number of refugia and the extent of the Survey Site, surveys were often 
completed by two surveyors in one day or by one surveyor over two days (subsequent 
days where weather was permitting).

Limitations to Methods 
3.12 
The survey method is designed to identify the presence or likely absence of common 
reptile species and to provide an indication of the abundance of reptiles present within the 
Survey Site. However it is possible that the survey may have only recorded a small 
sample of the populations present, and that if a reptile species occurs at a low density, it 
may have been missed. 
3.13 
On two survey visits (Visit 4 on 3 September and Visit 5 on 11 September) the average 
temperature for the survey was slightly higher than is recommended (both averaged 18.5 
°C) for surveying. It is not considered to have affected the overall result of the survey, as 
the common species of reptile that were recorded on site are known to bask at higher 
temperatures (Gent & Gibson, 2003). In addition, the numbers of reptiles recorded were 
similar to numbers recorded during the other surveys, with the 4th and 6th highest total 
counts of reptiles recorded during these surveys.

Results  
Desk Study 
4.1 
SEWBReC provided 12 records of reptiles, between 1998 and 2010. These included 
records of all the common reptile species: adder, grass snake, common lizard, and slow 
worm. The closest record is of a common lizard, approximately 0.8 km to the west of the 
Survey Site boundary. Most records are from the south-west side of the tinplate working 
near to Bryn Whilach Farm, approximately 1 km to the southwest of the Survey Site 
boundary. 
Field Survey 
4.2 
Reptiles were recorded during refugia checks and visual searches on site. Details of the 
timing of surveys and weather conditions are provided in Table 2.

4.3 
A summary of the survey results is provided in Table 3 below and the full results are 
presented in Appendix 2. The locations where reptiles were recorded is presented in 
Figures 1a and 1b in Appendix 1. Two common species of reptile were recorded at the 
Survey Site; common lizard and grass snake. No other reptile species were recorded.  
The majority of records were associated with artificial refugia and where direct 
observation of reptiles were made during the surveys, the closest refugia number was 
used to indicate the sighting location.  
Common Lizard  
4.4 
A total of 163 adult and juvenile common lizard observations were recorded during the 
seven survey visits, with a peak count of 50 recorded during the second visit on 26 
August 2014 (Survey No. 2).  
4.5 
Area 1 was surveyed with 38 refugia and the highest numbers of common lizard were 
recorded from this area, with 58 recorded over the seven visits, and a peak count of 22 
on 28 August 2014 (Survey No. 3). All of these records were from the extensive area of 
marshy grassland / wet modified bog with no observations of any reptiles made along the 
road verge also included in Area 1.   
4.6 
Area 2 was surveyed with 65 refugia and a total of 36 common lizard observations were 
recorded during the seven visits, with a peak count of 15 on 28 August 2014 (Survey No. 
3). The animals recorded were fairly evenly distributed across the habitats included in this 
area, although most records were from the eastern half of this area.

4.7 
Area 3 was surveyed with 89 refugia and a total of 51 common lizard observations were 
recorded during the seven survey visits with a peak count of 23 on 26 August 2014 
(Survey No. 2). The majority of the records were from the marshy grassland on the 
eastern boundary of the Survey Site, with occasional records along the gallops track.  
4.8 
Area 4 was surveyed with 125 refugia and a total of 18 common lizard observations were 
recorded during the seven surveys with a peak count of seven on 26 August 2014 
(Survey No. 2).  
4.9 
During the course of the survey both male and female common lizard were recorded with 
some of the females being gravid, which confirms that there is a breeding population 
present on the Survey Site. 
Grass snake 
4.10 
In total ten observations were recorded for grass snake during the course of the survey 
with a peak count of five recorded on 26 August 2014 (Survey No. 2).  All observations of 
grass snake were made in Area 3 in the marshy grassland close to the pond. 
4.11 
Juvenile grass snake were recorded along with adults which is suggestive that a breeding 
population is present on the Survey Site, however as grass snake are a wide ranging 
species and the location of the animals recorded on site was close to the Survey Site 
boundary; the presence of juveniles does not necessarily confirm that breeding takes 
place on site. 
Other species 
4.12 
Common toad Bufo bufo was found across the Survey Site with a total of 51 records 
made for this species and a peak count of 17 recorded on 28 August 2014 (Survey No. 
3). 
4.13 
Common frog Rana temporaria was recorded once on 26 August 2014 (Survey No. 2). 
Large numbers of recently emerged juvenile common frog were observed during the 
refugia collection on 16 September 2014. These sightings were made in the areas of 
marshy grassland and were not associated with the artificial refugia.

Summary 
1.1 
Abergelli Power Limited (APL) is promoting a new Power Generation Plant with its associated Gas 
and Electricity Connections (the ‘Project’) on agricultural land within Abergelli Farm, north of 
Swansea in the City and County of Swansea (approximately at National Grid Reference 265284, 
201431). 
1.2 
The preliminary ecological appraisal1 identified that invasive species of plants, as listed under Part 
II of Schedule 9 of the Wildlife and Countryside Act (WCA), 1981 (as amended) (specifically 
Japanese Knotweed Fallopia japonica and Himalayan balsam Impatiens glandulifera), are present 
on the Survey Site in a number of areas. The report recommended that a detailed survey to map 
the distribution of any invasive species should be carried out to inform any management measures 
that would need to be implemented to remove or control the spread of these species during the 
construction and operation of the Project.  
1.3 
APL commissioned BSG Ecology to undertake an invasive survey of streams and wet ditches 
within the 150 ha of pastoral farmland at and around Abergelli Farm in June 2014 within the Survey 
Site, to inform and support an application for Development Consent for the Project.  
1.4 
The Survey Site was surveyed in July 2014 by an ecologist from BSG Ecology.  All accessible 
areas of the Survey Site were walked with areas of dense scrub assessed from the perimeter of the 
scrub, and the presence of five species included under Part II were recorded within the Survey 
Site: Japanese knotweed, Himalayan balsam, rhododendron Rhododendron ponticum, floating 
pennywort Hydrocotyle ranunculoides and montbretia Crocosmia x crocosmiiflora. 
1.5 
Of the five species Himalayan balsam and Japanese knotweed were the most widespread within 
the Survey Site.

Introduction 
2.1 
APL commissioned BSG Ecology to undertake an invasive species survey in May 2014 to inform 
and support an application for Development Consent for the Power Generation Plant. 
Site Description 
2.2 
The Survey Site consists of approximately 150 ha of pastoral farmland, primarily grazed by horses. 
The extent of the Survey Site is shown in Figure 1 in Appendix 1 and is centred at National Grid 
Reference 265284, 201431. The nearest settlement is Felindre, which is located approximately 2 
km to the north of the Survey Site, with Swansea approximately 5 km to the south.    
2.3 
The Survey Site is largely agriculturally improved pasture with several areas of marshy grassland, 
particularly in the north, south and north-western ends of the Survey Site. The fields are bounded 
by fences, running along the line of defunct hedgerows, and often accompanied by ditches. There 
is a block of broadleaved woodland on the eastern boundary of the Survey Site and other areas of 
woodland around the marshy grassland to the west of the Survey Site, and around Felindre Gas 
Compressor Station and the two National Grid 400 kV electrical substations that lie at the south-
west end of the Survey Site. The habitats in the surrounding landscape are similar to those within 
the Survey Site boundary – a mixture of improved and marshy grassland interspersed with 
occasional patches of woodland. 
Description of Project 
2.4 
APL is promoting a new Power Generation Plant with associated Gas and Electricity Connections 
within Abergelli Farm.  The Power Generation Plant would operate as a Simple Cycle Gas Turbine 
(SCGT) peaking plant and would be designed to provide an electrical capacity of up to 299 
Megawatts (MW).  It would be fuelled by natural gas, supplied by a new underground gas pipeline 
connecting Power Generation Plant to the existing National Grid Gas (NGG) National Transmission 
System (NTS). It would also connect to the National Grid Electrical Transmission System (NETS) 
via underground cable or overhead lines. 
2.5 
BSG Ecology has been appointed as the ecological consultant to undertake an ecology survey, 
which incorporates a desk study and Extended Phase 1 Habitat Survey as well as a range of 
Phase 2 surveys, including a survey for invasive species.  The methods and results of baseline 
surveys will be provided as appendices to an ecology chapter of an Environmental Statement, 
which is intended for submission, in support of the application for Development Consent. 
Background to Survey 
2.6 
For the purposes of this survey, invasive plant species are defined as those species of non-native 
plants included in part II of Schedule 9 of the WCA 1981 (as amended).   
2.7 
Since its creation in 1981, part II of Schedule 9 of the WCA (as amended) 1981, pertaining to 
invasive plants, has undergone many revisions, to the extent that the original four species has now 
been expanded to include over 30 invasive plant species. 
2.8 
The Phase 1 survey of the Survey Site was carried out in three phases, in February 2014 and 
updated in April 2014, and July 2014.  The timing of the first two surveys during the winter and 
early spring meant that the presence of some of the Schedule 9 species was missed as the 
vegetative parts of the plants (growing above ground) can be absent during the colder months of 
the year, with the plant persisting, over winter, below ground as rhizomes or lying dormant in the 
seed bank.  Because of this it was recommended in the Phase 1 survey report that a dedicated 
invasive species survey should be undertaken within the main botanical survey season (May to 
September) to attempt to map the distribution and extent of Schedule 9 species within the Survey 
Site.

Aims of Study 
2.9 
The aim of the survey is to confirm the presence and identify the locations of species of plant 
included under Schedule 9 of the WCA (as amended) 1981.

Methods 
3.1 
No standard method exists for invasive plant species survey; and the survey was based on an 
ecological walkover survey approach, whereby all accessible areas of the Survey Site were walked 
by the surveyor in daylight hours, with a visual search for the target species undertaken.  
3.2 
Particular focus was also given to areas where the target species were most likely to be found, for 
example water courses, areas of disturbed ground and tracks where imported material may have 
been used or where fly-tipping or movements of vehicles or machinery could have led to the spread 
of these species.  
3.3 
Where found to be present, the species and location were recorded using a handheld GPS. The 
locations of individual plants, small clusters and large clusters of plants found during the walkover 
survey are provided in Figure 1. The locations are representative and do not necessarily provide 
mapping of the exact extent of each species or the precise location of each individual plant.  
Limitations of Study 
3.4 
The scale of the Survey Site and the presence of dense areas of scrub or woodland understorey in 
some areas mean that it is possible that small stands or individual plants of invasive species could 
have been missed during the walkover survey.  In addition, the presence of horses in some fields 
restricted access to some areas of the Survey Site although these areas were assessed using 
binoculars and it is likely, given the heavily grazed nature of these fields, that most invasive plant 
species would have been visible using binoculars. It is considered that the majority of the Survey 
Site was surveyed adequately and that overall the distribution of invasive species across the 
Survey Site has been mapped accurately.  
3.5 
The mapping produced in support of the report is based on point locations taken using a handheld 
GPS device which is subject to varying degrees of accuracy depending on satellite coverage and 
other factors.  Further to this the GPS locations recorded were for the main aggregation of each 
plant species at each location.   Each point therefore does not represent full coverage of the 
species at each point.  Any invasive plant management plan should take account of this with up to 
date, detailed surveying by a qualified land surveyor undertaken to provide accurate extents of 
species coverage. The distribution of each invasive plant species will, inevitably, change from year 
to year to a greater or lesser extent and these locations should be re-checked as necessary.

Results 
4.1 
Five species of plant included on Part II of Schedule 9 of the WCA 1981 were recorded during the 
survey: Japanese knotweed; Himalayan balsam; rhododendron; floating pennywort; and 
montbretia.  The locations and extents of these species are shown on Figure 1. 
4.2 
The most frequently recorded species were Japanese knotweed and Himalayan balsam.   
4.3 
Japanese knotweed was found to be strongly associated with roads and trackways on the Survey 
Site as well as the area of inert landfill in the north-west half of the Survey Site.  This perennial 
species is typically spread through the movement of contaminated soils or through spreading of 
vegetative parts through flailing of hedges or movement of other machinery. 
4.4 
Himalayan balsam is an annual plant that is typically found in wetter habitats, although it will 
tolerate drier conditions.  It is strongly associated with woodland, stream corridors and ditches 
across the Survey Site. 
4.5 
Rhododendron is restricted to woodlands with a small patch occurring in the marshy grassland 
area in the north-west of the Survey Site.  Montbretia was recorded in two locations alongside 
roads, which is a typical location for this species to be found in given that it is often spread from the 
fly tipping of garden waste. 
4.6 
Floating pennywort was found in one of the Survey Site ponds in the south-east of the Survey 
Site2.

APPENDIX 8.12 - SPECIES SPECIFIC LEGISLATION
1.1
Badgers
1.1.1
Badgers are protected under the Protection of Badgers Act (1992) on
animal welfare grounds rather than nature conservation value.  It is an
offence to wilfully take, kill, injure or ill-treat a badger, or possess a
dead badger or any part of a badger.  Under the Act their setts are also
protected against obstruction, destruction or damage.
1.2
Otters
1.2.1
Otters are fully protected under Schedule 2 of the Habitats Regulations
which define “European protected species of animals” and also receive
partial protection under the WCA.
1.2.2
Taken together the Act and Regulations make it illegal to: deliberately
kill, injure, capture, disturb otters (whether in a resting place or not);
damage, destroy or obstruct access to a resting place used by an otter;
possess or transport an otter or any part of an otter, unless acquired
legally; sell, barter or exchange or advertise for such purposes an otter
1.2.3
Activities that could result in impacts on otters should be modified to
avoid/minimise the likelihood of an impact occurring in the first
instance.  If impacts are unavoidable then the works may need to be
carried out under a European Protected Species development licence,
granted under the Habitats Regulations.
1.2.4
Otters are also a Species of Principal Importance in Wales as identified
under Section 42 of the NERC Act 2006.
1.3
Water voles
1.3.1
Water voles are fully protected under the WCA.  It is an offence to
possess, control or sell water voles or to intentionally or recklessly kill,
injure or take water voles.  It is also an offence to intentionally or
recklessly damage, destroy or obstruct access to a place that water
voles use for shelter or protection or disturb water voles whilst using
such a place.  No licensing regime exists for development activities that
may result in an infringement of the legislation.
1.3.2
Current guidance from NRW states that where development activities
may result in unavoidable impacts on water voles, developers will need
to be confident that their activities are “the incidental result of an
otherwise lawful operation”, and that all steps that could reasonably be
taken to avoid, minimise, mitigate and (if necessary) compensate for
impacts have been taken.
- 2 -
1.4
Dormice
1.4.1
Dormice are protected under the WCA (in respect of section 9(4)(b)
and (c) and (5) only) and are listed in Schedule 2 of the Habitats
Regulations.  Under the current legislation it is illegal to intentionally or
deliberately kill, injure or capture dormice, deliberately disturb dormice
(whether in a nest or not); or to damage, or destroy dormouse breeding
sites or resting places.
1.4.2
Any activity that would result in a contravention of the above legislation
would likely require a European Protected Species (EPS) licence from
the relevant statutory body (NRW).
1.5
Bats
1.5.1
All native UK bat species are protected by UK law under Schedule 5
and 6 of the WCA, and under Schedule 2 of the Habitats Regulations.
It is illegal to deliberately capture, injure or kill a bat or to intentionally or
recklessly disturb bats.  It is also illegal to damage, destroy or
intentionally or recklessly obstruct access to a breeding or resting place
used by a bat.  Under Part 2 of the Habitats Regulations, SACs can be
designated to further protect barbastelle (Barbastella barbastellus),
Bechstein’s (Myotis bechsteinii), lesser horseshoe (Rhinolophus
hipposideros) and greater horseshoe bats (Rhinolophus
ferrumequinum).
1.5.2
Several species of bats are listed under Section 42 of the NERC Act
2006 as Species of Principal Importance.  Species include the greater
horseshoe bat, lesser horseshoe bat, barbastelle, common pipistrelle
(Pipistrellus pipistrellus), soprano pipistrelle (Pipistrellus pygmaeus),
noctule (Nyctalus noctula), Bechstein’s bat and brown long-eared bat
(Plecotus auritus).  Furthermore, five bat species (common pipistrelle,
barbastelle, Bechstein’s bat, greater horseshoe bat, lesser horseshoe
bat) are listed as priority species in the Swansea BAP.
1.6
Breeding birds
1.6.1
All birds, their nests and eggs are protected by the WCA.  It is an
offence to intentionally kill, injure, or take any wild bird, or take or
destroy an egg of any wild bird.  It is also an offence to damage or
destroy the nest of any wild bird (whilst being built, or in use).
1.6.2
Birds listed under Schedule 1 of the WCA are afforded additional
protection with regard to intentional or reckless disturbance while nest
building, or at a nest containing eggs or young, and disturbance of the
dependent young of such a bird is also an offence away from the nest.
- 3 -
1.7
Great crested newts
1.7.1
GCN are fully protected under Schedule 2 of the Habitats Regulations,
and receive partial protection under the WCA Schedule 5.  It is illegal to
deliberately capture, injure or kill GCN, to intentionally disturb GCN or
to otherwise disturb them in their place of shelter, or to deliberately take
or destroy the eggs of GCN.  It is also illegal to damage, destroy or
intentionally or recklessly obstruct access to a breeding site or resting
place used by GCN.  All life stages of GCN are afforded the same level
of protection.  The legislation also makes it an offence to possess,
transport, sell or exchange, or offer to sell or exchange GCN.
1.8
Reptiles
1.8.1
The four common reptile species, adder, grass snake (Natrix natrix),
common lizard and slow worm, are protected under Schedule 5 of the
Wildlife and Countryside Act (1981, as amended) against intentional
killing, injuring and trade.  All species of reptile are listed as Species of
Principal Importance in Wales.
1.8.2
The natural range of the rarer species (smooth snake (Coronella
austriaca) and sand lizard (Lacerta agilis) does not include this part of
South Wales, and thus they are not considered further in this
assessment.  Sand lizard is listed as priority species under the
Swansea BAP (coastal areas).
1.9
Terrestrial and Aquatic Invertebrates
1.9.1
The WCA lists around 70 invertebrate species on Schedule 5 with
various levels of protection according to the rarity of the species.
Species with full protection under the Act include the marsh fritillary
butterfly, southern damselfly, mole cricket, fairy shrimp, medicinal leech
and freshwater pearl mussel, amongst many others.  Three
invertebrate species are protected under the Conservation of Habitats
and Species Regulations (2010, as amended) large blue butterflies,
Fisher's estuarine moths and little whirlpool ramshorn snails.  Section
42 of the NERC Act (2006) also lists several invertebrate species as
species of principal importance in Wales.
