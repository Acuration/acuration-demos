Chairman’s introduction  
In perspective  
Back in 2012, we declared our intention to convert three of our six generating units to burn sustainable 
biomass in place of coal by the end of 2016. The transformation work is now well advanced with two units 
converted and the third scheduled to be converted in the time frame indicated.  
Our transformation extends beyond the conversion works at Drax Power Station, both upstream and 
downstream. The benefit of a presence in the upstream supply market is significant, in the southern 
US our two wood pellet plants are in commissioning and our port facility is “pellet-ready”.  
Downstream the continued attraction of renewable power amongst businesses keen to meet their own 
sustainability commitments has seen our retail sales increase. Our commitment to becoming a 
leading provider of sustainable power is as strong as it has always been. 
We offer a source of power which is sustainable, secure and reliable, cost-effective and low carbon. 
We continue to see future value for our business and our shareholders in our biomass strategy, and 
we are on track to deliver that. 
We also take very seriously our responsibility to the communities where our operations are based. 
This is well illustrated by our visitor programme at Drax Power Station where we hosted more than 
12,500 visitors in 2014. 
Earnings and dividend 
Our earnings (EBITDA(1)) for 2014 at £229 million were broadly level with those in 2013 (£230 million). 
In accordance with our dividend policy, the Board proposes a final dividend in respect of 2014 of 7.2 
pence per share, equivalent to £29 million. This would give total dividends for the year of £48 million 
(2013: £71 million). 
Board changes 
As announced in September 2014, I shall be retiring from the Board at the Company’s AGM this 
coming April. I have served on the Board for some nine years and I have been privileged to be its 
Chairman for the last seven. During that time Drax has seen tremendous change, from a business 
with purely electricity generation interests to a growing Group with interests along the electricity and 
biomass supply chain. 
It has been an exciting journey for everyone involved and I have every confidence that the Group has 
a successful future ahead of it. I am delighted in the choice of my successor, Phil Cox CBE. Phil has 
significant experience of the power sector and is no stranger to the boardroom.  
We have an effective Board with good and complementary skills, knowledge and experience across 
all directors, both executive and non-executive, and Phil is well placed to lead them. I wish him and 
the Group every success.  
Our people 
As always my final say is about the people at Drax. I have enjoyed getting to know many during the 
last nine years and I have valued the time I have spent with them. What is common throughout the 
Group is the unfaltering support and commitment of everyone. My sincere thanks and very best 
wishes go to all staff across the Group.

Chief Executive’s statement 
Review of the year 
Our main priority in 2014 was the delivery of our biomass transformation project. For the business and 
our shareholders, 2014 proved to be a very difficult year as various regulatory risks materialised and 
we faced a notable deterioration in commodity market conditions. Despite these challenges I am able 
to report very good progress in our transformation into a predominantly renewable electricity provider. 
We are on track to deliver according to the plan we initially laid out in 2012. 
Our vision for Drax is to be a bold, customer oriented power generation and retail business, driven by 
biomass innovation. In moving towards achieving our vision, we made good progress during 2014 on 
our biomass supply chain construction projects in the US, our biomass conversion project at Drax 
Power Station, and our growth in electricity sales to businesses.  
Earnings 
Our earnings for 2014 reflect our progress in delivering reliable biomass-fired generation as the 
earning potential of our coal-fired generation fell following the near doubling of the UK carbon tax. At 
£229 million, EBITDA is roughly level with last year (2013: £230 million).  
Securing sustainable biomass supplies 
Sustainability is critical to our biomass strategy. All our biomass, whether in raw fibre or pellet form, is 
procured against our own robust sustainability criteria. These include requirements for high 
greenhouse gas emission reduction, habitats and biodiversity protection, as well as due consideration 
to the important socio-economic factors in the source areas. A programme of independent audits 
verifies that all our suppliers comply with our sustainability criteria.  
The dynamics of the forest industry are sometimes misunderstood. Demand for wood helps keep land 
in forest and incentivises investments in new and more productive forests, all of which have significant 
carbon benefits. Our calculations show that the range of sustainable biomass materials we have burnt 
over the last few years has a low carbon footprint. In 2014, the average greenhouse gas emissions 
from burning biomass were 34gCO2/MJ; significantly below 79gCO2/MJ which is the maximum to be 
permitted under the UK Government’s framework for sustainability requirements for biomass that are 
expected to become mandatory later this year. 
Our developments in the US are an important part of our biomass sourcing strategy. They help us to 
optimise the biomass supply chain which is still in its infancy, particularly in the southern US which is 
the main source of our biomass. The main drivers for our upstream investments are twofold: securing 
the timely delivery of reliable wood pellet supplies to Drax Power Station and consolidating third party 
and own supplies to secure more efficient and cost effective delivery logistics. 
Our two, 450 thousand tonnes per annum wood pellet plants – Amite (Mississippi) and Morehouse 
(Louisiana) – have now entered into commissioning. Our port facility at Baton Rouge (Louisiana) is 
now ready to receive and despatch wood pellets to the UK. We continue to evaluate further upstream 
development opportunities in the US. 
Aside from our investments to secure a self-supply of sustainable biomass, we have made good 
progress towards securing near-term volumes of wood pellets from suppliers in the market with more 
than six million tonnes contracted for April 2015 to March 2016. We continue our negotiations for 
additional longer term volumes to support our third unit conversion. 
Biomass conversion 
In 2012, we embarked on our plan to convert three of our six generating units to burn sustainable 
biomass in place of coal, with a target to secure fuel for all three converted units by the end of 2016. 
We are on schedule to meet that target. Our second generating unit was converted to burn biomass in 
October 2014, after running as an enhanced co-firing unit, that is, burning at least 85% biomass, for 
five months.  We plan to convert a third unit to biomass in the 12 month window from 1 July 2015. 
Coal-fired generation performance  
As in previous years, we delivered strong generation output from our coal-fired units. We were able to 
continue to deliver additional value to the business through providing flexible generation output and 
balancing services to the System Operator, National Grid, in support of system stability and security.

Health and safety 
In the UK, our safety performance remains industry-leading. During 2014, we undertook a significant 
amount of project work and a single planned outage on one of our generating units. All work was 
completed without a worse than first aid injury. 
In 2013, the safety performance in the US at our construction sites was weaker than safety 
performance of our UK operations. During last year we worked hard to drive improvements at these 
US sites to meet our UK standards. Together with our contractors we made good progress during the 
year. However, our achievements were marred by the tragic death of a sub-contractor towards the 
end of the year. Excellent safety management has always been at the centre of our management 
ethos. The incident serves as a poignant reminder of the importance of strong safety systems and 
controls in the construction and operation of large plant. 
Retail performance 
Selling our output through our retail business, Haven Power Limited (“Haven Power”) continues to 
provide us with a credit-efficient route to market for our power sales compared to the wholesale 
electricity market. It also provides a good route to market for the Renewables Obligation Certificates 
and Levy Exemption Certificates earned when we generate renewable power.  
During 2014, Haven Power delivered another year of substantial growth in a highly competitive 
market with retail sales 46% higher, in volume, than in 2013. 
An excellent standard of customer service is central to our proposition for our retail operations. We 
are a consistent high performer in the Datamonitor Energy Buyers Survey and have a good renewals 
record. 
We have been working to minimise the risk that we face from the implementation of a price freeze, as 
announced by the Labour Party at its 2013 Party conference, should the Party come to power 
following May’s General Election. Apart from a small number of customers that take supply on default 
terms, all of Haven’s customers are supplied under fixed term contracts. We do not believe that this 
form of contract is the primary target of the proposed freeze. 
Regulatory framework  
The regulatory framework is a key influencing factor on our business. At the start of 2014 we had 
expected to be awarded two early contracts for difference or investment contracts (in line with the 
new, forthcoming contracts for difference regime) to support our second and third unit conversions.  
In April, the government concluded that the second unit was no longer eligible for such a contract. We 
mounted a legal challenge and the High Court found in our favour. However, the government 
appealed that judgment and won. We subsequently converted our second unit under the Renewables 
Obligation (“RO”). 
The investment contract for our third unit conversion has been executed, but is subject to EU State 
Aid clearance which is still under review. 
In June, Ofgem referred the electricity wholesale and retail markets to the Competition and Markets 
Authority ("CMA"); the main focus being on supply competition in the residential market. The CMA 
initiated a market investigation to determine whether any feature, or combination of features, of these 
markets prevents, restricts or distorts competition in the sector. If it concludes that there are issues 
that need addressing, it has wide ranging powers to impose remedies. The CMA’s updated issues 
statement, published in February 2015, reported no finding of major competition concerns in the 
generation sector. We expect the CMA to conclude its inquiry during 2015. We are cooperating fully 
with the CMA’s investigation.  
In November, we reached a settlement agreement with Ofgem regarding non-compliance with our 
obligation under the Community Energy Saving Programme. The settlement, worth £28 million, will 
see up to £20 million benefit vulnerable energy consumers through a programme of work to be 
developed by the charity, National Energy Action.  
 
8 
 
In December, the Government published a consultation on changes to the grandfathering policy for 
future biomass and co-firing conversion projects under the RO. The changes proposed would apply to 
all such projects except those already awarded with an investment contract, for example, our third unit 
conversion as mentioned above. The outcome of that consultation will have no impact on Drax’s base 
strategy of converting three generating units to burn sustainable biomass in place of coal and 
becoming a predominantly biomass-fuelled power generator. However, if the consultation proposals 
are upheld, it will reduce our options for the conversion of a fourth unit. 
Also in December, the first capacity market auction was held. The market is designed to ensure 
security of electricity supply by providing a payment for reliable sources of capacity. Two of Drax 
Power Station’s coal units were successful in the auction, with the capacity required for delivery in 
2018/19.  
Looking ahead 
We are on track to complete our transformation into a predominantly biomass-fuelled power provider 
in 2016. The case for a three unit conversion is robust and we are committed to full execution of this 
project. 
We remain convinced that sustainable biomass has an important and strategic role to play in the 
future energy mix of the UK. Not only does biomass bring the benefit of significant carbon savings 
over fossil fuels, but it does so without jeopardising the security of supply characteristics traditionally 
associated with fossil fuel technology.  
The financial benefit of biomass generation from converted coal units is very significant. Independent 
economic analysis by Frontier Economics estimates that, if our biomass transformation project 
converting three of the six generating units at Drax Power Station to burn biomass in place of coal 
was replaced by offshore wind in 2020, the cost to the economy would be £3.4 billion more.  
We trust that, over time, the significant benefits of biomass conversion as an attractive renewable will 
underpin support for further generating unit conversions at Drax. 
We remain alert to future strategic opportunities and will continue to review options that build on the 
wider strengths and competences of the Group with the potential to generate value for our 
shareholders. 
As ever, it is a complex picture for our stakeholders to evaluate, but I am confident that our 
transformation will deliver an attractive future for the business and our shareholders, whilst delivering 
a significant amount of cost effective renewable power to UK consumers and making a meaningful 
contribution to the UK’s 2020 climate change targets.

Operational and financial performance 
Introduction 
In a year during which trading and regulatory conditions have been challenging, EBITDA for the year 
to 31 December 2014 was £229 million, compared to £230 million in 2013.  
We have continued to make good progress with our biomass transformation project, having converted 
our first unit in May 2013. We modified a second unit in May 2014 to operate as an enhanced co-firing 
unit, burning at least 85% of its fuel from biomass, which was subsequently fully converted to biomass 
in October. Both biomass units continue to perform very well and are operating in line with plans. 
A third of our generation capacity is now biomass-fired, with biomass representing 29% of our overall 
fuel mix in 2014, compared to 12% in 2013. As a result, carbon (CO2) emissions and the associated 
cost of allowances purchased under the EU-ETS have fallen year-on-year. The transformation is 
providing significant earnings protection to the Group, compared to being a solely coal-fired 
generator. 
Our coal-fired generation remains subject to increases in the cost of carbon incurred through the UK 
carbon price support (”CPS”) mechanism, first introduced in April 2013. CPS rates increased by 93% 
with effect from April 2014, adding £56 million to our cost of fuel in 2014. As a result, the overall cost 
of carbon increased compared to the previous year. 
Our capital investment plans remain on schedule and budget. The new on-site biomass facilities at 
Drax Power Station are now fully commissioned and fuelling our two converted units. In the US Gulf, 
we continue to expect commercial operations to commence at our first pellet plant and port facility in 
the first quarter of 2015, with commercial operations following at the second plant in the second 
quarter. This continued investment in our transformation is reflected in capital expenditure of £201 
million for 2014 (2013: £286 million). 
Our retail business, Haven Power Limited (“Haven Power”), has continued to deliver strong sales 
growth in highly competitive markets, with 11.8TWh of sales in the year ended 31 December 2014, 
compared to 8.1TWh in 2013. 
The expected increase in ROC assets and biomass stocks arising from increased biomass generation 
has resulted in a reduction in cash generated from operations from £171 million in 2013 to £127 
million. We have utilised available agreements to accelerate ROC cash flows in 2014 where possible. 
Our balance sheet remains robust. In May 2014, we agreed a new £100 million private placement 
with M&G Investments, which complements our existing financing structure secured in previous years 
and provides additional liquidity to the Group. 
With £325 million of loans drawn down, net debt at 31 December 2014 was £99 million (2013: net 
cash of £71 million).  
At the forthcoming Annual General Meeting, the Board will recommend a final dividend for 2014 of 7.2 
pence per share, taking total dividends for the year to £48 million.

Commodity markets 
The margins of our generation business are driven by commodity market movements and the timing 
of our fuel purchases and power sales. The key profit drivers are those commodities that make up the 
dark green and bark spreads, being power, coal, carbon and biomass. 
The trends in commodity prices witnessed in the last few years are described in the following 
paragraphs and illustrated in the accompanying charts. 
Power and gas 
Following a period of relative stability through 2013 and early 2014, power prices reduced 
substantially through the second half of 2014. The gas market continues to drive power prices. 
Limited Japanese nuclear generation, in the aftermath of the Fukushima disaster, continued to 
provide support to Japanese liquefied natural gas (“LNG”) demand. However, growth in new LNG 
supplies and a relatively mild winter, led to muted gas demand and increasing stored inventories, 
resulting in some price pressure in the second half of the year.  
International LNG and oil-indexed European gas prices came under pressure due to a falling oil 
market. Weaker than expected global demand and increased supplies driven by the prevalence of US 
production coupled with key OPEC oil producers not making supply cuts caused a crash in global oil 
prices – down 50% during the second half of 2014.  
Coal  
Market prices for international coal have continued to fall steadily as the global coal market remains 
oversupplied. Delivered prices have also fallen as a result of lower global freight rates. 
During summer 2014 UK coal demand from power generators was down 31% year-on-year and 
indigenous coal production is under pressure with two of the remaining deep mines expected to close 
by the end of 2015. China seabourne coal demand has fallen year-on-year, with growth focus now on 
India. 
With prices falling, producers focussed on reducing production costs and increasing output to improve 
efficiencies. The strengthening of the US dollar during the year also supported many exporting 
nations. 
Carbon 
A downward trend in market prices for EU-ETS carbon allowances continued through 2012 and 2013.  
Carbon prices spiked early in 2014 due to the introduction of the much-debated “back-loading” 
(postponing the sales of 900mt of emissions allowances to 2019/20 in order to restrict current 
supplies) in an attempt to alleviate the over-supply in the market. However, the over-supply of 
allowances resulting from the European recession and emission reductions persists and as a result 
prices fell back to pre-back loading levels almost immediately.  
Political intervention remains the key driver for carbon prices and further possible measures, such as 
discussions around the market stability reserve proposed for phase four of the EU-ETS in 2021, drove 
a steady rise in carbon prices over the second half of 2014. 
Biomass  
The majority of biomass used for large scale power generation is imported from North America and 
Europe and accordingly is priced in US dollars, Canadian dollars or euros. Movements in these 
exchange rates, set out in the chart to the left, therefore drive the changes in biomass costs during 
the period.  
Our extensive foreign currency hedging programme provides some protection from these fluctuations 
in exchange rates.  
Dark green spread and bark spread 
As a result of falling gas and power prices throughout the second half of 2014 and an increase in 
carbon prices, dark green spreads reduced from the levels seen earlier in the year and in 2013. The 
increase in carbon price support (“CPS”), a levy on coal deliveries, from April 2014 continued to 
reduce margins for coal-fired generators. 
11 
 
The fall in power prices also impacted bark spreads, which fell steadily during the year. The US dollar 
strengthened against sterling, increasing the overall cost of fuel to UK generators. Looking forward, if 
soft power markets persist bark spreads could fall further as the cost of fuel does not fall in line with 
weaker power and gas prices. 
However, bark spreads were stronger than dark green spreads throughout the period and further 
increases in CPS from April 2015 will continue to erode the competitive position of coal-fired plant.  
The performance of our coal operations and the dark green spreads we can achieve remain important 
to our earnings. However, as we progress our biomass strategy, with a third unit due to be high 
biomass from the second half of 2015, the value of renewable support and the bark spread will 
increasingly drive our profitability.

(1) Includes £34 million (2013: £28 million) for fuel sales. 
The generation gross profit for the year ended 31 December 2014 was £433 million, compared to 
£430 million in 2013. Dark green spreads, which currently account for the majority of our gross profit, 
were weaker in 2014, but good operational performance and the increasing influence of biomass in 
our fuel mix means profitability was slightly higher than in 2013. 
The introduction of the UK CPS mechanism from April 2013 has added a levy to our coal purchases 
and, as expected in its first full year of operation, which saw a rate increase applicable from April 
2014, continued to erode the profitability of our coal generating plant. 
However, with biomass now accounting for 29% of fuel burnt (by energy content), this was mitigated 
somewhat by the reduced cost of CO2 emissions allowances purchased under the EU-ETS. This 
reinforces the economic case for the strategy we have developed to become a predominantly 
biomass-fuelled power generator.

Revenue 
Total generation revenue for the year ended 31 December 2014 was £2,450 million, compared to 
£1,780 million in 2013. 
Our generation business recognises revenue when it sells power into the wholesale market, or to 
Haven Power (see Retail, below). Intra-group sales totalled £735 million (2013: £468 million). We can 
meet our power delivery obligations either by generating the power ourselves or by buying power from 
the market. We purchase power from the market either when it is more economical to do so, or to 
meet delivery obligations that cannot be covered by generation. 
Power purchases of £710 million (2013: £334 million) are included within cost of sales and the 
associated revenue within power sales. Increasing retail sales (see Retail, below) have increased our 
power delivery obligations which, along with falling market power prices during 2014 has resulted in a 
substantial increase in the amount of power we have purchased from the market. As prices fall, the 
overnight power price drops below our marginal cost of production more frequently at the point of 
delivery. 
Increasing levels of intermittent generation (principally wind and solar) on the electricity system in the 
UK, which contributes to falling power prices and increased grid charges, is also providing 
opportunities to capitalise on the flexibility of the Drax plant through balancing and system support 
activities.

Excluding the cost of power purchased in the market, our power sales revenue of £1,369 million was 
higher than the equivalent comparative for 2013 (£1,335 million). This increase reflects both a 
0.5TWh increase in net power sold (electrical output) and a small increase in the average achieved 
electricity price from £51.0 per MWh to £51.3 per MWh, despite a fall in market prices during the year. 
The timing of our power sales hedges has provided protection from recent power market weakness. 
Generation revenue also includes sales of ROCs and LECs of £315 million (2013: £63 million). With 
two units now fully converted and biomass now accounting for 29% of our fuel mix (2013: 12%) we 
are entitled to considerably more ROCs and LECs from our renewable generation. 
The timing of ROC sales is driven by a combination of Renewables Obligation deadlines and 
commercial considerations. Increasingly, we are able to utilise available agreements (described in 
more detail in Financing and cash flow management) to monetise ROC sales, accelerating the 
recognition of sales as well as the associated cash flows. 
This trend, in addition to the greater entitlement to ROCs and LECs described above, is demonstrated 
in the table at the foot of the opposite page.  
It is the value of ROC and LEC support earned in any given period, rather than the income received 
for those sold, that drives the bark spreads achieved. This support is recognised in the income 
statement as a reduction in fuel costs in the month the associated biomass is burned – matching the 
benefit against the cost of the biomass.

Cost of sales 
Our fuel costs are driven by a combination of market prices at the time of securing the fuel and the 
mix of different fuels burnt during the period.

Total fuel costs in respect of generation for the year ended 31 December 2014 were £1,225 million 
(2013: £946 million). 
The average gross cost of fuel, before the impact of carbon allowances, CPS and ROC support, was 
£40.3 per MWh in 2014 compared with £32.1 per MWh in 2013, reflecting the increasing proportion of 
biomass in our fuel mix. 
Following the conversion of our first unit to run on biomass in April 2013, we modified a second unit to 
run as an enhanced co-fired unit in May 2014, burning up to 85% biomass, which was subsequently 
fully converted in October.  
Within cost of sales, net biomass costs are made up of the cost of the fuel delivered to site less the 
value of renewable support received. The cost of the fuel includes raw material and delivery costs. 
The renewable support reflects the value assigned to ROCs and LECs earned through generating 
electricity from burning biomass, that value being derived from prevailing market prices for ROCs and 
LECs at the point of generation. The value of the renewable support therefore reduces the net cost of 
biomass.  
When renewable support is taken into account, the average cost of fuel for the year is £26.8 per 
MWh, compared to £26.6 per MWh in 2013. 
Coal remains the largest component of our fuel mix and as a result the cost of the UK carbon tax 
introduced in April 2013, which was subject to a 93% rate increase from April 2014, has continued to 
add to our fuel costs. The total cost in respect of CPS in 2014 was £118 million, compared to £62 
million in 2013,  
However, as our proportion of generation from biomass increases our requirement to purchase 
emissions allowances under the EU-ETS reduces. In 2014 our emissions reduced to 16.6 million 
tonnes (with allowances purchased at an average price of £4.6 per tonne) from 20.3 million tonnes 
last year (with allowances purchased at an average price of £6.1 per tonne), a saving of £47 million 
year-on-year. 
When we sell ROCs and LECs, to a third party or Haven Power, the value previously recognised as a 
reduction in fuel costs and held in our balance sheet is recognised as a cost of sale. The cost of 
ROCs and LECs sold in 2014 is £314 million (2013: £62 million), with the increase compared to last 
year reflecting both increased generation and our ability to accelerate sales using ROC agreements 
as described above. 
When it is more economical to do so, we can meet our power delivery obligations (created through 
forward sales of power in prior periods) by buying power from the market. Power purchases in 2014 
totalled £710 million (2013: £334 million). 
Generation cost of sales also includes grid charges of £82 million (2013: £70 million) which continue 
to increase as the level of intermittent generation on the UK electricity system impacts system 
balancing costs.

Generation operating performance 
Health and safety 
2014 saw another year of significant project activity at Drax Power Station, with the modification of a 
second unit to run as an enhanced co-firing unit from May and its subsequent conversion in October 
alongside a single major scheduled planned outage. Against this backdrop our safety performance in 
the UK remains industry-leading, with no worse than first aid injuries during annual major planned 
outages at Drax Power Station for two years. 
In the US, substantial progress has been made on the construction of two pellet plants and a port 
facility. We have worked hard this year, with our contractors, to improve safety standards at these 
sites and bring them in to line with performance levels at our UK operations. 
Regrettably, as noted in the Chief Executive’s statement, the tragic death of a sub-contractor at one of 
our US construction sites in the year stands as a reminder to the critical importance of strong safety 
standards and culture. The safety of all of our employees and contractors across the Group is of 
paramount importance and has always been at the centre of our management ethos. 
The Group’s lost time injury rate and total recordable injury rate (“TRIR”) in 2014 were 0.06 and 0.33 
respectively, compared to 0.09 and 0.29 in 2013. Despite the increase in TRIR, which was related to 
our US construction programme, our performance continues to be in the upper quartile amongst coal 
power plants 
Plant operational performance 
Biomass 
When initially converted in April 2013, our first biomass unit was materially constrained by the use of 
temporary fuel storage, handling and distribution systems. The commissioning of our bespoke 
systems late last year has largely overcome these start-up issues. 
With two converted units at the end of the year, both running fully on our bespoke receipt, storage and 
handling infrastructure, biomass now represents 29% of our electrical output, having increased from 
2.9TWh in 2013 to 7.9TWh in 2014. Both units are performing well and to plan, delivering 630MW of 
capacity on a consistent basis. 
We have made good progress with biomass unit optimisation. In addition, we completed a successful 
grid flexibility test during 2014. As a result, we expect to undertake greater system balancing activities 
from biomass units, enhancing potential value streams. 
Outage activity in the year included a one-month outage to modify the second unit for enhanced co-
firing from May and a further outage ahead of full conversion from October, in addition to scheduled 
routine maintenance and fuel trials. The first biomass unit, which has now been running for over 18 
months, ran very reliably throughout 2014. 
Our maintenance regime includes a major planned outage for each of our six units once every four 
years. Consequently, there is an irregular pattern to planned outages and associated expenditure, 
since in two of the four years two units will each undergo a major planned outage. In 2015, our first 
converted biomass unit will undergo a major planned outage. 
Coal 
We have continued to realise good operating performance from our remaining coal units. Generation 
from coal fired capacity was 18.8TWh (2013: 23.3TWh) in 2014, the reduction from the prior period 
caused by biomass conversion activity described above. 
A single major planned outage took place on coal units in 2014, compared to two in the previous year. 
There are no major outages planned for coal-generating units in 2015.

Strategic value 
The strategic value of Haven Power, the Group’s retail business, is in providing an alternative credit-
efficient route to market for power, ROCs and LECs. 
ROCs earned by the generation business from burning biomass can be utilised by the retail business 
through its sales of power. In 2014, Haven Power utilised 36% of ROCs generated by Drax. In 
addition, where Haven Power supplies Renewable or Levy Exempt Power this utilises the LECs 
earned by burning biomass. Such sales account for over half of Haven Power’s volumes. 
With our growth targets for the business, Haven Power should utilise all the ROCs generated from 
one of our converted units and a substantial proportion of the LECs from the three planned unit 
conversions. 
In selling power into the retail market, rather than wholesale, the Group swaps collateral risk for credit 
risk, which is more controllable. Haven Power actively manages credit risk by assessing the financial 
strength of its customers and applying rigorous credit management processes, reflected in very low 
bad debt experience to date. 
We continue to have a strong focus on cash collection and working capital. This focus, combined with 
the growth at Haven Power, has again resulted in the retail business being a net contributor of cash to 
the Group. 
Revenue 
Movements in key financial metrics for Haven Power are underpinned by continued good volume 
growth. Haven Power delivered net sales volume growth of 46% this year to 11.8TWh from 8.1TWh in 
2013. 
Haven Power has built its business on a good service reputation, which has supported the achieved 
growth and has resulted in an excellent renewals performance in the I&C sector. 
As a result of this growth, revenue increased to £1,090 million at an average price of £92.4 per MWh 
(2013: £751 million at an average price of £92.7 per MWh).  
Much of Haven’s sales growth continues to be from the larger but more competitive I&C market. Many 
larger I&C customers are signed up to flexible contracts where the customer decides when to fix the 
price of their power, or leave it to day or month ahead prices. As a result, the declining wholesale 
power price in 2014, has contributed to the reduced average price for retail sales. 
With over 13TWh of sales already contracted for the next 12 months we expect Haven to continue to 
grow in the future, with our proven infrastructure providing the foundation from which future growth 
can be achieved. 
 
 
16 
 
Cost of sales 
Total power purchases increased to £629 million in 2014 (2013: £455 million), primarily as a result of 
the increase in sales volumes described above. Haven purchases most of its power requirement from 
Drax Power Station, with all non-long term intra-group purchases made at market equivalent prices. 
Accordingly, the average price paid of £53.3 per MWh has fallen slightly from £56.2 per MWh in 2013 
reflecting changes in the wholesale market over the period. 
In addition to the cost of purchasing power, cost of sales comprise third party costs including grid 
charges, the cost of meeting our obligations under the Renewables Obligation small-scale Feed-in-
Tariff schemes and the cost of LECs required to deliver Renewable or Levy Exempt Power to our 
customers. Grid charges include costs of distribution, transmission and system balancing.  
The rates charged by the network and system operators have increased compared to 2013. 
Distribution costs increased by 9% on average in April 2014 and Transmission costs increased by 
15% on average for the same period. As described under Generation above, the increase in 
intermittent generation on the UK electricity system has driven an increase in system balancing costs. 
As a result, total grid charges for 2014 were £253 million, equivalent to £21.4 per MWh sold (2013: 
£168 million, equivalent to £20.8 per MWh sold). 
In April 2014 the costs of the Renewables Obligation increased from £8.66 per MWh to £10.57 per 
MWh sold, an increase of over 22%. Small-scale Feed-in-Tariff costs also increased by 30% in the 
second quarter of 2014 compared to the same period last year. 
Approximately half of the power sold by Haven is levy exempt. Accordingly the associated total cost of 
LECs sold has increased year-on-year as sales volumes grow. 
Total third party costs, at £445 million, represented 41% of the overall costs of supply (2013: £280 
million, 38% of the overall costs of supply). 
Gross margin 
The markets in which Haven Power operates have been very competitive in both the current and prior 
period. It is these challenging trading conditions that drive the gross margin performance of the retail 
business. 
As noted above, revenues from flexible sales contracts have reduced due to the falling wholesale 
power price in the year. Conversely, rising third party costs put further pressure on the margins 
achievable on fixed-price sales. 
The majority of the growth achieved at Haven Power over recent years has come from the more 
competitive I&C market, which typically has a lower gross margin than the SME market. 
Taking all of these factors into account, retail gross margin for 2014 was £17 million compared to £16 
million in 2013.

Group operating and administrative expenses 
Group operating and administrative expenses before depreciation were £220 million for the year 
ended 31 December 2014 compared to £215 million in 2013, the increase reflecting investment in our 
US-based pellet production operation as it approaches commercial operations. 
In addition, we invested £3 million into the White Rose Carbon Capture and Storage (“WRCCS”) 
project during the year. The project is at the midpoint of a two-year Front-End Engineering and Design 
process. We have committed to provide a further £1 million of funding to enable the project to 
conclude this process, with a final investment decision expected in 2016. 
Further costs associated with Retail Market Reform added £1 million to the cost base of Haven Power 
in 2014, compared to the previous year. 
Despite these incremental costs, the result for the year demonstrates our continued commitment to 
strong operational cost control. The chart to the left of this page illustrates good year-on-year 
performance in managing the underlying cost base of the Group, with low inflation in underlying costs, 
after allowing for a single major outage in 2014 (2013: double major outage). 
Group EBITDA 
Group EBITDA, (earnings before interest, taxation, depreciation and amortisation), which excludes 
the impact of unrealised gains and losses and the one-off settlement of CESP (see below), is our 
primary financial performance indicator. Changes in EBITDA are primarily driven by factors 
influencing the gross margin. 
Despite challenging market conditions and absorbing additional carbon costs through CPS, our gross 
margin improved modestly this year as a result of, the increasing influence of our biomass 
transformation, good operational performance at Drax Power Station, and continued growth at Haven 
Power. 
 
18 
 
However, investment in our cost base to support our US operations as they approach commercial 
operations and the increasing costs of meeting regulatory requirements in both generation and retail 
mean our EBITDA is in line with last year at £229 million. 
Looking forward, we remain committed to our plan to convert a third unit to biomass; however our 
trading environment is challenging and the expected trajectory of CPS may continue to erode the 
margins achieved by our remaining coal-fired plant.  
Community Energy Saving Programme (“CESP”) 
In November 2014 we reached a settlement agreement with Ofgem regarding non-compliance with 
our obligations under the Community Energy Saving Programme (”CESP”). The settlement requires 
us to contribute a total of £28 million, which will see up to £20 million benefit vulnerable energy 
consumers through a programme of work to be developed with the charity National Energy Action. 
A further £5 million fine will be payable and £3 million delivered as further consumer redress 
measures. 
The objective of CESP was to deliver energy saving measures to domestic energy users in specified 
low-income areas of Great Britain. 
We voiced our concerns at the outset regarding the inclusion of independent generators in the 
scheme given their lack of experience in delivering the energy efficiency schemes requested and lack 
of any direct relationships with domestic electricity consumers. 
For these reasons, we outsourced our obligation to a third party provider operating within the sector. 
Unfortunately, the chosen provider failed to deliver the obligation in full and, despite procuring 
additional measures, we did not comply with our obligations under the scheme by the end of the 
obligation period. 
We have agreed a settlement with the third party for breach of contract in this regard, which will result 
in Drax receiving settlement of £5 million in cash and the third party delivering the consumer redress 
measures described above. 
The net impact of these settlements to Drax is therefore a cash cost of £20 million, which as a 
material one-off item which is non-operational in nature, has been excluded from our underlying 
performance measures, including EBITDA, in line with previous policy. 
Depreciation 
Depreciation was £81 million for the year ended 31 December 2014, compared to £65 million in 2014. 
The commissioning of our biomass storage, handling and distribution systems at Drax Power Station 
late in 2013 drives the majority of this increase. As we progress our biomass transformation and the 
US supply chain investments come online in 2015, depreciation charges will continue to increase. 
Unrealised gains and losses on derivative contracts 
A key component of the Group’s risk management strategy is the use of forward contracts to secure 
and de-risk the future cash flows of the business. 
The Group uses forward contracts in two ways – forward purchases and sales of physical 
commodities to secure market level dark green and bark spreads on future sales, and the use of 
financial contracts (either currency exchange contracts or contracts underpinned by commodity prices 
which are settled financially, rather than by delivery of physical goods) to fix sterling cash flows. 
As we progress our biomass transformation, we have entered into an extensive hedging programme 
to support our biomass procurement activities and secure the sterling cost of biomass. This has 
included forward contracts for the purchase of physical biomass, the use of financial products to fix 
variable elements of indexation – notably oil-linked – within these contracts, and foreign exchange 
contracts to secure the sterling cash flows. This programme covers all contracted and a substantial 
proportion of un-contracted but forecast purchases. 
 
19 
 
This programme, in conjunction with the established hedging strategy for our coal operations, 
provides a significant degree of protection from adverse market price movements. 
The unrealised gains and losses recognised in the income statement reflect changes in the fair value 
of forward commodity and financial contracts that do not qualify for the own-use exemption or as 
hedges (from an accounting perspective, even though the contracts represent an economic hedge) 
under International Financial Reporting Standards. 
The fair value of a forward contract is primarily derived with reference to prevailing market prices at 
the start and end of the period. The location of the unrealised gains and losses arising on our portfolio 
of those contracts within the 2014 financial statements is summarised in the table below:

Accounting treatment is determined by the availability of the own use exemption or the hedge relationship being designated as and 
meeting the definition of an effective hedge under IFRS. Where neither of these items apply, unrealised gains and losses are 
recognised in the income statement. 
Unrealised gains recognised in the income statement of £66 million this year (2013: unrealised losses 
of £110 million) principally reflect the strengthening US dollar, relative to sterling, during the period 
which improved the value of our contracted position relative to prevailing market rates. These gains 
were offset to an extent by unrealised losses on financial oil contracts, utilised in securing the element 
of biomass costs linked to oil price indices, as global oil prices fell significantly in the final quarter of 
the year. 
In considering these movements it is important to recognise that profitability is driven by our strategy 
to deliver market level dark green and bark spreads, not by the absolute price of any single 
commodity at a given date. The unrealised gains and losses on forward contracts represent a subset 
of our total forward contracted position, driven by accounting regulations, and are not indicative of 
future financial performance. Accordingly we exclude these gains and losses from our key underlying 
performance measures. 
Interest 
Net finance costs for the year ended 31 December 2014 were £29 million compared to £23 million in 
2013. 
The £6m increase in net finance costs reflects the additional costs associated with financing our 
biomass transformation. This includes interest on our borrowings which are described in further detail 
in the Liquidity and capital resources section below. 
20 
 
Profit before tax  
The profit before tax for 2014 is £166 million, compared to £32 million in the previous year. 
The settlement of CESP, additional depreciation and interest charges have resulted in an incremental 
pre-tax charge of £41 million in 2014; however the increase in pre-tax profits has been driven by 
unrealised gains on derivative contracts of £66 million, compared to unrealised losses of £110 million 
last year. 
Underlying profit before tax, which excludes the impact of unrealised gains and losses and the one-off 
effect of the CESP settlement in 2014, amounted to £120 million compared to £142 million in 2013. 
The £22 million reduction is primarily attributable to additional depreciation and interest charges.

The 2014 tax charge of £37 million, compares to a £20 million tax credit in 2013. The increase 
principally reflects the increase in profit before tax in 2014 versus 2013, which was driven primarily by 
the unrealised gains recognised in respect of derivative contracts this year (2013: unrealised losses).  
The 2013 tax credit included non-recurring tax credits of £22 million relating to reductions in UK 
corporation tax rates, and £7 million in respect of research and development claims agreed with 
HMRC.

derivatives contracts and settlement of CESP, as described above) is 20% in 2014, in line with the 
standard rate of corporation tax in the UK as expected. The comparable underlying rate in 2013 was 
0%, driven by the non-recurring tax credits described above. 
Cash taxes paid during the year were £16 million (2013: £18 million), principally reflecting lower 
underlying profit before tax. These payments were offset by tax refunds in settlement of prior years, 
bringing net taxes paid in 2014 to £14 million (2013: £11 million). 
Profit after tax and earnings per share 
Profit after tax for the year ended 31 December 2014 was £129 million, compared to £51 million in 
2013, driving basic earnings per share of 32 pence in 2014, compared to 13 pence in 2013. 
Underlying profit after tax, which strips out the impact of unrealised gains and losses on derivative 
contracts and the settlement of CESP in 2014, was £96 million (2013: £142 million) resulting in 
underlying earnings per share of 24 pence per share (2013: 35 pence per share). 
The reduction in underlying earnings per share in 2014 reflects the impact of increased depreciation, 
interest and tax charges described above. This is the basis for dividend distributions.

Cash generated from operations 
Cash generated from operations of £127 million in 2014, compared to £171 million in 2013, 
incorporates an increase in working capital of £84 million, driven primarily by rising biomass stocks. 
This was compounded by increased ROC and LEC assets of £45 million, following the conversion of 
our second biomass unit in the year. As noted above, the value of our ROCs and LECs generated is 
held in the balance sheet until the assets are sold to a third party – the timing of which is driven by RO 
deadlines and commercial considerations. This outflow was only partially offset by the inflows from 
reductions in carbon assets as our emissions decrease. 
Net cash flows from operating activities 
2014 taxes paid relate to settlement of the 2013 liability and 2014 payments on account, and are 
shown net of £2 million of refunds in relation to previous years. Such credits were greater in 2013, 
arising from the research and development claims agreed with HMRC, reducing overall tax payable in 
the prior period. As noted above, our underlying tax charge for the 2014 was in line with standard 
rates of corporation tax in the UK. 
22 
 
Net cash used in investing activities 
Purchases of property, plant and equipment of £200 million in 2014 (2013: £302 million) are reflective 
of the significant amount of investment across the business as we continue to progress our biomass 
transformation.  
Net cash flows from financing activities 
In order to support our biomass transformation we completed and drew down a further £100 million in 
loan facilities during 2014 (2013: £125 million), as described in Financing and cash flow management. 
Net cash 
From £287 million at 31 December 2013 the decrease in cash and cash equivalents of £66 million 
during the year leaves cash and short-term investments of £221 million at 31 December 2014. 
Increased borrowings have been used to support cash generated from operations in funding the 
capital investment programme. As such net debt (after deducting borrowings) at 31 December 2014 
of £99 million compared to net cash of £71 million in 2013. 
Financing and cash flow management 
In May 2014, we agreed a new private placement for £100 million with various funds managed by 
M&G Investments. This complements our existing term loan facilities secured in 2012 and 2013 and 
enhances the existing financing structure by providing additional liquidity to the Group and ensuring a 
smooth profile of debt maturities. Furthermore, the all-in cost of the new facility is very competitive. 
The financing structure also incorporates the £75 million amortising term loan facility with Friends Life, 
underpinned by a guarantee from HM Treasury under the Infrastructure UK Guarantee Scheme, 
agreed last year, a £50 million amortising term loan from the Green Investment Bank, a £100 million 
amortising term loan facility with the M&G UK Companies Financing Fund and a £400 million working 
capital and letter of credit facility. The term loans have varying maturity profiles ranging from 2017 to 
2025. As envisaged under the terms of the original agreement, the working capital and letter of credit 
facility has been extended for one year and is now due to mature in April 2017. 
In addition, a commodity trading facility allows us to transact prescribed volumes of commodity trades 
at attractive prices without the requirement to post collateral. This facility continues to operate well, 
offering trading counterparties uncapped access to the security package available to our senior 
lenders. 
Overall, the financing structure is a key component of the steps we have taken over the past few 
years to restructure our business, financing and trading arrangements to enable Drax to both invest to 
strengthen and secure the potential of the business, whilst being able to operate comfortably at a sub-
investment grade level. 
As described above, ROCs and LECs earned from renewable generation can drive significant working 
capital absorption, with the associated cash income typically received up to 12 months after burning 
the associated biomass. At the end of 2013 we executed an £80 million ROC monetisation agreement 
with Lloyds Bank Commercial Finance Ltd, expanding our capability to enhance cash flows by selling 
ROC receivables. The agreement has been utilised during the year to accelerate over £50 million of 
cash from ROC sales to third parties. We have recently concluded further similar agreements with 
HSBC and Lloyds, taking the total of ROC monetisation agreements in place to £200 million. We 
continue to explore ways to further enhance our ROC cash flows. 
Capital expenditure 
Fixed asset additions were £201 million in the year ended 31 December 2014, compared to £286 
million in 2013. This includes £125 million on our biomass transformation project (2013: £228 million), 
which is now mostly focussed on our US developments following the commissioning of the on-site 
facilities at Drax Power Station in late 2013. 
Total capital expenditure to date on the biomass transformation project, with two units complete, 
necessary supporting infrastructure in place and significant progress with the two US pellet plants and 
port facility, amounts to approximately £550 million. We expect to spend a further £130 million over 
the period to 2017 concluding these projects and ensuring compliance with the requirements of the 
Industrial Emissions Directive (IED), bringing total development expenditure to £650-£700 million, in 
line with our original guidance. 
23 
 
Our lead case investment for IED compliance remains unchanged, incorporating the implementation 
of low nitrogen oxide burners and Selective Non-Catalytic Reduction technology across all units. 
At Drax Power Station, the on-site infrastructure and systems that underpin our transformation 
strategy are now in place and provide us with the ability to unload rail wagons efficiently, store up to 
300 thousand tonnes of biomass on-site and deliver it directly to the combustion systems of converted 
units. 
In the US, our port facility is now “pellet-ready” and both pellet plants have entered a commissioning 
phase. We continue to expect commercial operations at our first pellet plant in the first quarter of 
2015, with commercial operations at the second pellet plant following in the second quarter. Both 
plants are expected to reach full capacity six months later.  
Other information 
Going concern 
The Group’s business activities, together with the factors likely to affect future developments, 
performance and position including principal risks and uncertainties are set out in the Chief 
Executive’s statement, this Operational and financial performance review and the Principal risks and 
uncertainties section which follows. Our cash flows and borrowing facilities are described above.  
We have significant headroom in our banking facilities, a recent history of cash generation, strong 
covenant compliance, and good visibility in near-term forecasts, due to our progressive hedging 
strategy. Our Business Plan takes account of our capital investment plans and reasonably possible 
changes in trading performance, including sensitivity analysis on downside scenarios. The Plan 
demonstrates that we expect to be able to operate within the level of our current banking facilities 
over the period under review. 
Accordingly, the directors have a reasonable expectation that the Group has adequate resources to 
continue in operational existence for the foreseeable future, and continue to adopt the going concern 
basis of accounting when preparing these financial statements. 
Seasonality of borrowing 
Our business is seasonal with higher electricity prices and despatch in the Winter period and lower 
despatch in the Summer months, when prices are lower and plant availability is affected by planned 
outages. 
Accordingly, cash flow during the Summer months is materially reduced due to the combined effect of 
lower prices and output, while maintenance expenditures are increased during this period due to 
major planned outages. The Group’s £400 million working capital and letter of credit facility assists in 
managing the cash low points in the cycle where required (see Financing and cash flow 
management). 
Future developments 
The market outlook for 2015 remains challenging. We will continue to see the erosion of dark green 
spreads as the cost of carbon increases following the CPS trajectory set by government. Our dark 
green spreads will also be impacted by changes to gas and power prices, which remain uncertain. 
Lower power prices will also impact bark spreads, where the fuel price is less variable and will not fall 
in line with revenues received. The timing of our hedges provide protection for a limited period, 
following which any persisting market weakness will impact our future financial results. 
We remain committed to our strategy to convert three units to biomass with the funding platform 
already in place to deliver this. Our capital expenditure projects to support this ambition remain on 
schedule and on budget and are set to deliver a stronger, more robust business. In 2016 we will have 
converted three units to biomass, providing cost-effective, low carbon renewable energy. 
As noted in the Chief Executive’s statement, two of our coal generating units were successful in the 
first capacity market auction in December 2014, with capacity payments expected to commence in 
2018. 
24 
 
The White Rose CCS project is now half way through its feasibility study, which is on schedule to 
complete towards the end of 2015. Drax has committed to provide a further £1 million of funding over 
this period.

Distributions 
Distribution policy 
The Board has committed to distribute 50% of underlying earnings (being profit attributable to equity 
shareholders adjusted to exclude the after tax impact of unrealised gains and losses on derivative 
contracts and the one-off CESP settlement in 2014) in each year. Underlying earnings for the year 
ended 31 December 2014 were £96 million. 
Dividends paid 
On 17 February 2014, the Board resolved, subject to approval by shareholders at the Annual General 
Meeting (“AGM”) on 23 April 2014, to pay a final dividend for the year ended 31 December 2013 of 
8.9 pence per share (£36 million). The final dividend was paid on 16 May 2014. 
On 28 July 2014, the Board resolved to pay an interim dividend for the six months ending 30 June 
2014 of 4.7 pence per share (£19 million), representing 50% of underlying earnings for the period. 
The interim dividend was paid on 10 October 2014. 
Dividends proposed 
At the forthcoming AGM the Board will recommend to shareholders that a resolution is passed to 
approve payment of a final dividend for the year ended 31 December 2014 of 7.2 pence per share 
(£29 million), payable on or before 15 May 2015. 
Shares will be marked ex-dividend on 23 April 2015.

Principal risks and uncertainties 
A structured approach to risk management 
The effective management of risks within the Group underpins the delivery of our key priorities. 
The Group has a comprehensive system of governance controls in place to manage risks. Policies 
have been established in key areas of the business such as trading, treasury, production and health 
and safety to ensure that these risks are managed in a controlled manner and in accordance with the 
policies set by the Board. 
Commodity market price risk 
Context 
The commodity markets in which we trade are inherently volatile, and generation remunerated 
through the Renewables Obligation increases the risk in relation to the ROC market.  
Risk 
 We are exposed to the effect of fluctuations in commodity prices, particularly the price of electricity and 
gas, the price of coal and sustainable biomass (and other fuels), the price of CO2 emissions allowances 
and the market price of ROCs. 
Potential impact 
 Low dark green or bark spreads resulting in lower margins and reduced financial performance. 
 Volatility in financial results. 
Associated key priorities 
Maximise the value of the Drax business 
Examples of mitigating activities 
 Well understood progressive hedging strategy with forward power and ROC sales combined with 
corresponding purchases of fuel and CO2 emissions allowances when profitable and appropriate to do 
so. 
 Applications for conversions under the CfD regime which, if approved, remove potential income volatility 
associated with those units. 
Counterparty risk 
 
Context 
Continued uncertainty in the global economy and cautious economic growth potentially impact on the 
financial strength of our counterparties. 
Risk 
 We rely on third party suppliers for the delivery of fuel and other goods and services. We purchase a 
significant quantity of our fuel under contracts with a number of large UK and international suppliers, so 
are exposed to the risk of non-performance by these suppliers. 
 We enter into fixed price and fixed margin contracts for the sale of electricity to a number of 
counterparties, including non-domestic consumers via our retail business, so are exposed to the risk of 
failure of one or more of these counterparties. 
Potential impact 
 Additional costs associated with securing fuel and other goods and services from other suppliers. 
 Failure to secure fuel from other suppliers resulting in limitation of operations. 
 Adverse effect on cash flow and earnings arising from the failure of one or more of the counterparties to 
whom we sell power. 
Associated key priorities 
Maximise the value of the Group 
26 
 
Examples of mitigating activities 
 Diversified fuel supply in terms of source and counterparties. 
 Diversified logistics routes. 
 Target to optimise holding of fuel stocks. 
 Close monitoring and reporting of concentration risk in suppliers and power counterparties. 
 Full suite of power counterparties with strong credit ratings. 
 Power trading contracts generally include provisions that force counterparties to post collateral where 
their credit rating drops, subject to certain restrictions. 
 Close monitoring and reporting of potential credit and collateral risk. 
Regulatory and political risk 
Context 
The government’s market reform agenda is driven predominantly by the need to move to a 
sustainable, low carbon energy sector which delivers affordable supplies to customers whilst 
maintaining security of supply over the longer term. Laws and regulations are many and complex, are 
frequently changing, and becoming ever more stringent, particularly in relation to environmental 
matters. 
Risk 
 Changes to the current renewable support regime could adversely impact our biomass strategy. 
 Renewable support regime expires in 2027. 
 Further financial disincentives such as the CPS mechanism, could further erode the competitiveness of 
coal-fired plant. 
 The EU, UK and local environmental and health and safety laws and regulations affect our operations 
including limits on emissions to air and water, noise, soil/groundwater contamination, waste, and health 
and safety standards. 
Potential impact 
 Less funding available for plant retrofit/investment costs to meet increasingly stringent environmental 
requirements. 
 Lower load factors/generation levels. 
 Adverse effect on financial results and cash flows. 
Associated key priorities 
Deliver our biomass strategy 
Drive Group operational excellence 
Examples of mitigating activities 
 Briefing, representation and engagement at EU and UK level. 
 Development of abatement and alternative generation options. 
 Apply for conversions under the CfD regime and grandfathered ROC regime to provide increased 
certainty over future revenue streams. 
 Continue to promote and lobby the benefits of biomass, seek to secure support beyond current regime 
window. 
 Pricing of biomass contracts to allow for adverse commodity market movements. 
 Regular third party assurance over system effectiveness. 
 Strong safety culture and related training. 
27 
 
Biomass market risk  
Context 
The biomass market is developing and investment in the supply chain is required. 
Risk 
 We could fail to secure sustainable biomass supplies and/or logistics arrangements which meet our 
hurdle return rates and operational requirements. 
 Most of the sustainable biomass that we can procure is priced in foreign currency which increases our 
exposure to fluctuations against sterling and poses a risk to profitability. 
Potential impact 
 Inability to progress the biomass growth strategy.  
 Adverse effect on financial results and cash flows. 
Associated key priorities 
Deliver our biomass strategy 
Examples of mitigating activities 
 Contract with suppliers where a robust operational plant and logistics infrastructure is already in place; 
work with new suppliers to help develop such infrastructure. 
 Invest in the supply chain whilst in its infancy to ensure security and timing of supplies. 
 Hedge currency exposures or secure contracts in sterling to the extent that it is appropriate. 
Plant operating risk  
Context 
Maintaining plant integrity is critical to securing stable and safe operation. 
Risk 
 Plant failure may be caused by the underperformance or outright failure of plant, transmission assets or 
other equipment and components including the IT systems used to operate the plant or conduct trading 
activities. The duration of the resultant forced outages is influenced by the lead time to manufacture and 
procure replacement components and to carry out repairs. 
 As we progress our plans to convert to a predominantly biomass-fuelled generator, we are exposed to a 
broader range, and increased level, of technical risk. Whilst successful first conversion of a unit to 
biomass has been achieved, further units are planned. 
 Good progress has been made on our US investments however, project execution risk remains. 
Potential impact 
 Personnel injury. 
 Lower revenues. 
 Increased costs and contractual penalties. 
 Adverse effect on financial results and cash flows. 
Associated key priorities 
Drive Group operational excellence 
Deliver excellent people leadership across our operations 
Examples of mitigating activities 
 Comprehensive risk-based plant investment and maintenance programme. 
 Maintaining a trained and competent workforce. 
 Strong health and safety culture. 
 Target to optimise holding of spare components for use in the event of plant failure, particularly long lead 
time items. 
28 
 
 Business continuity plan for IT systems. 
 Ensure adequate insurance in place to cover losses from plant failure where possible. 
 Significant amounts of research and development work have been undertaken in terms of handling and 
burning biomass. 
Power and renewables market liquidity risk 
Context 
Liquidity in the power and ROC markets is dependent on there being a sufficient number of 
counterparties willing to trade actively. 
Risk 
 The market structure and consolidation of the existing generation and supply businesses in the UK could 
result in a reduction in the number of active participants in the market with whom we are able to trade 
power and other commodities, including ROCs. 
Potential impact 
 Inability to hedge short to medium-term exposure to electricity prices through wholesale market trading. 
 Increased exposure to short-term market volatility. 
 Inability to sell all of our electricity output, or ROCs. 
 Lower revenues and increased costs to achieve trading objectives. 
 Adverse effect on financial results and cash flows. 
Associated key priorities 
Grow our retail business 
Maximise the value of the Group 
Deliver our biomass strategy 
Examples of mitigating activities 
 Grow direct sales through Haven Power, our electricity supply business. 
 Initiatives to be active and responsive make Drax an attractive business partner. 
 Oppose structural changes that impact our market access, such as clearing and margining. 
 Work with other independent generators (via Independent Generators Group) to achieve positive market 
and regulatory changes to improve liquidity. 
 Secure longer-term structured deals when profitable to do so. 
 Application for conversions under the CfD regime which, if approved, reduce our reliance on the liquidity 
of the ROC market.

Notes to the consolidated financial statements 
1. General information 
The consolidated financial information for Drax Group plc (the "Company") and its subsidiaries 
(together "the Group") set out in this preliminary announcement has been derived from the audited 
consolidated financial statements of the Group for the year ended 31 December 2014 (the "financial 
statements"). 
This preliminary announcement does not constitute the full financial statements prepared in 
accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards ("IFRSs"). The financial statements were 
approved by the Board of directors on 23 February 2015. Statutory accounts for 2013 have been 
delivered to the Registrar of Companies and those for 2014 will be delivered in due course. 
The report of the auditors on the financial statements was unqualified, did not draw attention to any 
matters by way of emphasis without qualifying their report, and did not contain a statement under 
Section 498 (2) or (3) of the Companies Act 2006 or equivalent preceding legislation. 
2. Basis of preparation 
The financial statements have been prepared in accordance with IFRSs adopted by the European 
Union and therefore the consolidated financial statements comply with Article 4 of the EU IAS 
Regulations. 
The financial statements have been prepared on a going concern basis, and on the historical cost 
basis, except for certain financial assets and liabilities that have been measured at fair value. 
3. Summary of significant accounting policies 
The principal accounting policies adopted in the preparation of these financial statements are set in 
the 2014 Annual report and accounts. These policies have been consistently applied to both years 
presented. 
4. Taxation 
The tax charge/(credit) reflects the estimated effective tax rate on profit before tax for the Group for 
the year ended 31 December 2014 and the movement in the deferred tax balance in the year, so far 
as it relates to items recognised in the income statement. 
Current tax is provided at amounts expected to be paid (or recovered) using the tax rates and laws 
that have been enacted or substantively enacted by the balance sheet date. 
Deferred tax is the tax payable or recoverable on the difference between the carrying amounts of 
assets and liabilities in the balance sheet and the corresponding tax bases used in the computation of 
taxable profits. Deferred tax liabilities are recognised for all taxable temporary differences and 
deferred tax assets are recognised to the extent that it is considered more likely than not that taxable 
profit will be available against which deductible temporary differences can be utilised. 
In light of the complex nature of the CESP settlement, there is currently uncertainty as to the likely 
level of any tax deduction available for the net settlement cost, on this basis no tax relief has been 
recognised in respect of this matter in these financial statements.

7.2 pence per share (equivalent to approximately £29.0 million) payable on or before 15 May 2015. 
The final dividend has not been included as a liability as at 31 December 2014.

6. Earnings per share 
Earnings per share (“EPS”) represents the amount of our earnings (post-tax profits) that are 
attributable to each ordinary share we have in issue. Basic EPS is calculated by dividing our earnings 
by the weighted average number of ordinary shares that were in issue during the year. Diluted EPS 
demonstrates the impact if all outstanding share options (such as those to be issued under our 
employee share schemes, that are expected to vest on their future maturity dates, were exercised 
and treated as ordinary shares as at the balance sheet date. 
In addition to EPS, we calculate underlying EPS as it reflects the figures upon which our annual 
dividends are calculated (note 5). Underlying EPS removes the post-tax effect of fair value 
movements on derivative contracts and the CESP settlement, incurred in 2014 only, from earnings. 
Multiplying underlying basic EPS by 50% will give the total dividends per share for the period. 
Reconciliations of the earnings and weighted average number of shares used in the calculations are 
set out below:

7. Borrowings 
Borrowings are chiefly comprised of bank loans with fixed maturity repayment profiles between 2016 
and 2025.  
Maximising the value of the group… In April 2013, we agreed a new £75 million amortising term 
loan facility with Friends Life, underpinned by a guarantee from HM Treasury under the Infrastructure 
UK Guarantee Scheme. This replaced £50 million of the £100 million facility with the UK Green 
Investment Bank. 
In May 2014, we agreed a new private placement for £100 million with various funds managed by 
M&G investments.  
The new loan facilities, which were fully drawn at the year end, enhance the financing structure 
executed in previous years by providing additional liquidity and a smoother profile of debt maturities. 
The Group measures all debt instruments, whether financial assets or financial liabilities, initially at 
the fair value, which equates to the principal value, of the consideration paid or received. Subsequent 
to initial measurement, debt instruments are measured at amortised cost using the effective interest 
method. Transaction costs (any such costs incremental and directly attributable to the issue of the 
financial instrument) are included in the calculation of the effective interest rate and are, amortised 
through the income statement over the life of the instrument. 
Fees paid on the establishment of loan facilities are recognised as transaction costs of the loan to the 
extent that it is probable that some or all of the facility will be drawn down. In this case, the fee is 
deferred until the draw-down occurs. 
Analysis of borrowings 
Borrowings at 31 December 2014 and 31 December 2013 consisted principally of amounts drawn 
down against bank loans.

Fuel that gives a price advantage against standard bituminous coals. Such fuels include pond fines, 
off-specification coal and petcoke. 
Ancillary services 
Services provided to National Grid used for balancing supply and demand or maintaining secure 
electricity supplies within acceptable limits. They are described in Connection Condition 8 of the Grid 
Code. 
Availability 
Average percentage of time the units were available for generation. 
Average achieved price 
Power revenues divided by volume of net sales (includes imbalance charges). 
Balancing mechanism 
The sub-set of the market through which the System Operator can call upon additional

Contracts for difference (CfD) 
A mechanism to support investment in low-carbon electricity generation. The CfD works by stabilising 
revenues for generators at a fixed price level known as the “strike price”. Generators will receive 
revenue from selling their electricity into the market as usual. However, when the market reference 
price is below the strike price they will also receive a top-up payment from suppliers for the additional 
amount. Conversely if the reference price is above the strike price, the generator must pay back the 
difference. 
Dark green spread 
The difference between the power price and the cost of coal and carbon. 
EBITDA
