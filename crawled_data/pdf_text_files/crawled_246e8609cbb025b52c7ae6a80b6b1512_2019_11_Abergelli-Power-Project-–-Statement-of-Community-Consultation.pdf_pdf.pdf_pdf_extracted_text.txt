This Statement of Community Consultation is published in connection with a 
proposed gas-fired power station, including its integral gas and electrical 
connections, at Abergelli Farm (the Project). It explains how individuals living and 
working locally, as well as other interests such as local businesses and local 
civic/community organisations, can comment on the proposals to construct and 
operate the Project.  The Project Site is situated north of Swansea in the City & 
County of Swansea (north of M4, Junction 46), approximately 1km southeast of 
Felindre, 750m south-west of Llwyncelyn and 1.5km north of Llangyfelach.   
 
APL: location plan and application boundary 
The Project is being promoted by Abergelli Power Limited (APL), a company 
established by Watt Power Limited. Watt Power is seeking to develop gas fired 
power stations at Abergelli Farm and elsewhere in the UK to support the UK 
Government’s drive to a low carbon economy. 
  
APL has consulted City & County of Swansea Council as the local planning authority 
about the content of this Statement of Community Consultation and has had regard 
to the council’s response.

The capacity of the proposed Project will be in excess of 50 MW of electricity. As 
such, it is classified as a Nationally Significant Infrastructure Project (NSIP) under 
the Planning Act 2008. This requires a Development Consent Order (DCO), granted 
under the Planning Act 2008 (as amended by the Localism Act 2011 and the Growth 
and Infrastructure Act 2013 – hereafter referred to as ‘Planning Act 2008 (as 
amended)’), to build and operate, granted by the Secretary of State for Energy & 
Climate Change. 
 
The Statement of Community Consultation is part of a consultation process that APL 
is carrying out before it makes a formal application to the Secretary of State for a 
DCO. 
 
A consultation/communication plan has previously been developed and is available 
from APL or via its website www.abergellipower.co.uk. 
 
This Statement explains: 
• 
Some details about the Project; 
• 
How APL is publishing preliminary environmental information about the Project; 
• 
How APL is going to consult local people and communities about the Project 
and what activities will be undertaken to give them access to information about 
the proposal and help them to understand what particular aspects of the Project 
may mean to them, enabling them to provide informed feedback; 
• 
How people can become involved in shaping the Project before a DCO 
Application is submitted by putting forward their views to influence the Project, 
particularly regarding specific options under consideration; and 
• 
How people can provide feedback to APL from consultation activities and 
ensure that they are informed about the Project.  
 
The Project 
The key details of the proposed Project are: 
 
 
September 2014 
3 
• 
The construction of a Power Generation Plant with a rated electrical output of 
between 50 and 299 MW. The plant will have up to 5 stacks each up to 40m in 
height. The plant will have a dedicated access road.  
• 
The site for the Power Generation Plant covers an area of approximately 6 ha;  
• 
The Power Generation Plant will produce electricity from natural gas; 
• 
Construction of a new underground electrical connection  (up to 1km in length) 
to the National Grid and the construction of a new  underground pipeline (up to 
1.4km in length) to bring natural gas to the Power Generation Plant from the 
National Transmission System;  
• 
Creation of approximately 150 jobs during a construction period lasting two 
years and 15 permanent jobs once commercial operations have begun;    
• 
It responds to the UK Government’s need for new gas generation in order to 
underpin the country’s energy security and its transition to a low-carbon 
economy; 
• 
The station would emit about 50% less carbon dioxide (CO2) than an equivalent 
sized coal-fired power plant, and is designed to operate flexibly so that it can 
respond quickly and efficiently to short-term variation in customer demand and 
intermittent output from wind power generation; and 
• 
It is acknowledged that during construction and operation there is potential for 
adverse effects on some local communities and the environment, for example 
noise and traffic during the construction phase and the visual effects of the of 
the new stacks.  An Environmental Impact Assessment (EIA) is being 
undertaken to understand and seek to minimise these and other potential effects 
of the Project’s construction and operation. More information on this process is 
provided below. The EIA process is also considering the potential positive 
effects of the operation of the Project. 
 
The Planning Process 
DCO applications for NSIPs are submitted to the Planning Inspectorate which will 
process and examine the application before making a recommendation to the 
relevant Secretary of State. The final decision on the application is made by the 
Secretary of State and if it is successful, a DCO will be made.  
 
 
September 2014 
4 
The Government's policies in relation to NSIPs are set out in National Policy 
Statements (NPSs). The Project has been developed with regard to the relevant 
Energy NPSs, in particular EN-1 (Energy), EN-2 (Fossil Fuel Electricity Generating 
Infrastructure) and EN-5 (Electricity Networks Infrastructure).  EN-1 states that "gas 
will continue to play an important role in the electricity sector- providing vital flexibility 
to support an increasing amount of low-carbon generation and to maintain security of 
supply".   
 
When determining a DCO Application, the Secretary of State must have regard to 
the relevant NPSs and must make a decision in accordance with these unless 
she/he is satisfied that the adverse impact of the Project would outweigh its benefits.  
  
When considering whether to accept an application for examination, the Planning 
Inspectorate must be satisfied that the applicant has undertaken effective pre-
application consultation.  Pre-application consultation is essential in allowing APL to 
understand and seek to minimise the effects of the Project and to allow a thorough 
examination by the Planning Inspectorate. APL is required to submit a Consultation 
Report with its application for a DCO.  This report will include details of the local 
community feedback received, explain how APL has had regard to the feedback and 
will detail how APL has complied with the consultation requirements of the Planning 
Act 2008 (as amended). 
 
The community consultation described in this statement is carried out under Section 
47 of the Planning Act 2008 (as amended). It is in addition to consultation that will be 
carried out with specific statutory consultees (such as statutory nature conservation 
bodies) and those with relevant interests in land (including owners and occupiers 
within the Project boundary) under Section 42 of the Planning Act 2008 (as 
amended). It is also in addition to wider publication of the proposed Project under 
Section 48 of the Planning Act 2008 (as amended).

Environmental Information & Impacts 
The Project will be designed and developed to meet or exceed current quality, safety 
and environmental standards and efforts will be made to minimise its impact on the 
local environment, both during its construction and its operation.  The extent and 
scale of the Project and APL’s proposals to mitigate its impacts will be amongst the 
issues considered by the Planning Inspectorate on behalf of the Secretary of State. 
 
Because of the nature and size of the Project, APL is undertaking an EIA. Therefore, 
the Project is classed as an EIA development. The EIA considers the potential 
impacts of the Project including: air quality; noise and vibration; ecology; water 
quality and resources; geology, ground conditions and agriculture; landscape and 
visual; traffic, transport and access; cultural heritage and archeology; and socio-
economics.  
 
APL has consulted with various statutory bodies concerning the scope of the EIA, 
including local authorities, Natural Resources Wales (NRW), the South Wales Trunk 
Road Agency, and utility providers. A request for a Scoping Opinion was submitted 
to the Planning Inspectorate on June 25th 2014, accompanied by a Scoping Report. 
The Scoping Report outlines which environmental topics will be covered by the EIA 
and how the assessments will be undertaken. The Planning Inspectorate issued its 
formal Scoping Opinion on 1st August 2014.  
 
All 
documents 
are 
available 
on 
the 
Abergelli 
Power 
website 
(www.abergellipower.co.uk) and via the dedicated section on the Planning Portal 
website: http://infrastructure.planningportal.gov.uk/projects/wales/abergelli-power/ 
 
As part of the pre-application consultation materials on the proposed Project, APL 
will publish a Preliminary Environmental Information Report (PEIR) and an 
associated non-technical summary (NTS).  The PEIR will present the information 
gathered to date and provide the results of APL’s preliminary findings of the 
assessment of the likely significant environmental effects of the Project.  It will not 
set out the final findings but will include information on provisional mitigation 
measures.  During consultation, APL will make available details on landscaping 
proposals and other measures to mitigate the Project’s impact.  APL will provide 
 
 
September 2014 
6 
copies of the PEIR and its associated NTS to City & County of Swansea Council as 
the local planning authority. Both documents will also be made available at: 
Swansea Central Library; local libraries; at public exhibitions held as part of the 
consultation process and on the APL website.  
 
When the EIA process is complete and APL submits its application for a DCO, it will 
be accompanied by an Environmental Statement. This will report on the likely 
significant environmental effects of the Project identified in the EIA and will explain 
the mitigation measures to avoid or reduce these.  
 
Public Consultation 
The views of the local community about the Project are important.  In June 2014, 
APL carried out a non-statutory consultation process sharing its initial plans with the 
public at three exhibitions held in Clydach, Felindre and Tircoed.  At the exhibitions 
and since, APL has received and responded to comments on the Project and its 
impact on the environment, local communities and the local economy.    
 
a. 
What are we now consulting on and when? 
In the statutory phase of consultation commencing in Autumn 2014, APL will seek 
views on the preliminary environmental information presented about the Project as 
well as on other key elements of the Project. Only after responses have been 
considered will the design be finalised and the application for a DCO be submitted. 
Responses will be invited on: 
 The preliminary findings of the assessment as to the likely significant 
environmental effects of the Project; 
 The proposed route option(s) for accessing the Project; and 
 The indicative layout of the power generation plant within the Project site. 
The consultation explained in this Statement will run for 35 days ending on 16th 
November 2014. Comments about the Project must be received by APL by this date.   
 
b. 
Who will we consult with? 
 
 
September 2014 
7 
The Planning Act 2008 (as amended) states that those ‘living in the vicinity of the 
land’ should be consulted.  APL has discussed the scope of the consultation with 
City & County of Swansea as the local planning authority, and has identified and 
agreed the Consultation Zones that form the basis of the community consultation.  
 
APL will carry out its consultation activities in two areas: a Core Consultation Zone 
(CCZ) that equates to an approximate radius of 3.5km from the Project Site and an 
Outer Consultation Zone (OCZ) that equates to a radius of approximately 8km.   
 
The CCZ has been designed to include the main population areas in the vicinity of 
the Project Site that have the potential to be affected by the Project and expected to 
have the greatest interest in the Project   The zone includes the villages of Clydach, 
Felindre, Llangyfelach and Tircoed, and all or parts of the following community 
council areas: Clydach, Llangyfelach, Mawr, Morriston, Mynyddbach, Penllergaer 
and Pontlliw & Tircoed. 
 
Proposed Core Consultation Zone – approx. 3.5 km radius from the Project 
Site 
 
 
 
September 2014 
8 
Communities within the OCZ will be informed about the Project (via newspaper 
advertisements, posters, media coverage and contact with local elected members 
and community councils in the OCZ and other relevant local organisations) and 
given the opportunity to comment on the plans.  The outer zone includes the main 
population area of the city of Swansea.   
 
APL does not anticipate that the communities and businesses which lie within the 
OCZ will be significantly impacted by the Project’s construction and operation 
although APL recognises that they may be interested in it.  Outside the two zones, 
there may well be others interested in APL’s plans. They will also be reached 
through local/regional newspaper advertising and media coverage (print, broadcast 
and social media). Feedback that is received within the consultation period will be 
considered. 
 
c. 
 How will we consult?  
APL will seek and receive people’s views through a number of activities: 
• 
Public exhibitions will be held at Clydach, Felindre, Llangyfelach and Tircoed 
within the CCZ. Feedback forms, allowing people to provide their views on the 
Project, will be available at these exhibitions; 
• 
A leaflet or letter will be delivered to households, businesses and institutions in 
the CCZ, and made available at local council offices, local libraries and other 
venues as appropriate. The leaflet will also be distributed to those groups that 
are defined as “hard to reach” (for example, the elderly, the young and minority 
groups). It will give background on the Project, the consultation process 
(including exhibitions) and how individuals can engage in it. The leaflet will be 
made available at libraries and council offices in the OCZ; 
• 
Copies of the leaflet, the SoCC, the Preliminary Environmental Information 
Report and its Non-Technical Summary as well as other information about the 
Project will be available to be inspected at the following locations:
