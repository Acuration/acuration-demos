Introduction 
1.1 
Preamble 
Peter Brett Associates LLP (PBA) has been instructed by Millbrook Power Ltd (the Client) to 
undertake a Phase 1 Ground Condition Assessment for an area of land that lies within and 
around the Rookery South clay pit, approximately 1km to south of the village of Stewartby, in 
Marston Vale, Bedfordshire. This report has been prepared to support a Development 
Consent Order (DCO) application to develop the application area for the construction of a 
proposed gas fired electricity peaking plant. 
1.2 
Background 
The Rookery South clay pit (comprising an area of approximately 95 ha) and adjoining 
Rookery North clay pit (approximately 70 ha), were previously used for clay extraction from 
the Oxford Clay Formation to use in brick manufacture at the Stewartby Brickworks. The 
former clay pits have been largely worked out, with basal levels in the Rookery South pit left 
largely as they were after excavation apart from some minor areas of reworked ground and 
partial buttressing of the pit edge side slopes to improve their stability. At the time of writing 
this report the Rookery South pit was disused and partially flooded. A site layout plan is 
presented as Figure 2. 
Clay extraction ceased in 1986 and a programme of restoration has been proposed for the 
Rookery South pit as a whole by the current site owner O&H Properties Limited. The proposed 
low level restoration scheme (LLRS) will be implemented prior to the development of the site 
and will involve the use of soils, overburden and a proportion of the remaining clay reserves to 
re-profile the base of the pit, and buttress the side slopes to improve their stability. These 
restoration works are described in more detail in Section 1.5 below.  
The wider site area has been the subject of several previous ground investigations and reports 
compiled by PBA and others. The following sections of the report draw upon previous studies 
and site investigation information primarily from the following reports:

Objectives 
This report presents a Phase 1 ground condition assessment comprising a desk study, site 
walkover and Tier 1 preliminary qualitative contamination risk assessment and land instability 
appraisal. 
The objective of the Phase 1 is to identify the likely ground conditions and environmental 
setting that might have associated environmental liabilities or which may affect 
redevelopment, as well as appraising the likely geological or geotechnical hazards at the site. 
The Phase 1 desk study and site inspection report is the minimum requirement under the 
National Planning Policy Framework for land potentially affected by contamination or 
instability. This will be considered a brownfield development. 
It should be noted that this Phase 1 assessment is a land condition assessment and does not 
purport to be an ecological, flood risk or archaeological survey and additional specific surveys 
may be required to support a planning application. Guidance on the use of this report is 
provided in Section 8. 
1.4 
Site Location and Setting 
The application land area lies partly within and to the south of the Rookery South clay pit, 
approximately 1km to south of the village of Stewartby, in Marston Vale, Bedfordshire. 
The application area includes a section of land within the Rookery South clay pit that it is 
understood will house the power generating equipment (The Generating Equipment Site). 
Adjacent to the north of this there is a small temporary Laydown area that will be used during 
the construction process. The total Operation and Laydown (Construction) area is around 13 
hectares. 
The application area also includes a vehicular access corridor road (The Access Route). It 
runs in a southerly direction from Green Lane along the western perimeter of the Rookery 
North pit and then descends via an access ramp in the north-western corner of Rookery South 
pit. It then traverses south at a low level within the base of Rookery South pit to meet the 
northern boundary of the Generating Equipment Site. The road will be some 1.5km in length. 
A large parcel of agricultural land bounding the south of the clay pit is included within the wider 
application area. This land comprises approximately 215 hectares that will be utilised for a 
Electrical Connection to the existing 400kV overhead line and a link to the National 
Transmission System (NTS) gas pipeline, located some 1.2km to the southeast of the 
Generating Equipment Site site (The Electrical Connection Area). The Electrical Connection 
routes have not been fully defined and will occupy narrow corridors of land somewhere within 
this Electrical Connection area. 
The remaining parts of the wider Rookery South clay pit bound the immediate northern and 
eastern boundaries of the operation area, with agricultural land located further to the east of 
the London to Sheffield (mainline) railway that bisects the site running in a north to south 
direction. The western boundary of the wider application site is largely bounded by the 
Bedford to Bletchley (‘Marston Vale’) railway line and Marston Vale Millennium Country Park, 
with Millbrook Vehicle Proving Ground located further to the south west.

South Pillinge Farm is located to the immediate southwest of the Generating Equipment Site. 
This site is currently accessed via a track leading from Green Lane 1.2km to the north of the 
proposed Generating Equipment Site. The Operation area is centred at National Grid 
Reference (NGR) TL 012 406. A site location plan is presented as Figure 1. 
A site layout plan, annotated with features discussed in this report is presented as Figure 2.  
1.5 
Low Level Restoration Scheme (LLRS) 
Before development of the subject site it is understood that the proposed LLRS for Rookery 
South will be implemented and will therefore form the baseline conditions for the Project Site. 
Planning Permission has been granted for the LLRS under application numbers 
BC/CM/2000/9 and BC/CM/2000/8. In summary the LLRS for the Rookery South pit will 
comprise:  
1) Topsoil stripping from an area to the immediate south of Rookery South pit to enable 
further overburden and clay extraction from this area. 
2) Excavation of soils, overburden and clay from the southern area to provide engineered 
clay fill and restoration soils for the re-profiling and buttressing works around the pit 
edges. 
3) Re-profiling of the base of Rookery South pit, graded to falls, utilising clay won from the 
southern area, resulting in topographic levels in the vicinity of the proposed Generating 
Equipment Site of approximately 30m – 31m AOD. 
4) Construction of a new vehicular access track into the southwestern corner of the pit to 
provide low level access to the pit. 
5) Buttressing of slopes on the southern, eastern and northern sides of the Rookery South 
pit to provide a slope stabilisation solution to existing slopes. 
6) Provision of surface water management ditches in the reprofiled pit base discharging to an 
attenuation pond located in northwest corner of Rookery South pit. The surface water 
ditches and attenuation pond will include habitat mitigation and enhancement measures. 
7) Provision of pumping station to enable discharge of collected waters from the attenuation 
pond to Stewartby Lake with additional provision of a pumped emergency flow to Rookery 
North and reverse flow drainage 
1.6 
Proposed Development 
It is understood the project site will comprise: 
� 
A new Power Generation Plant in the form of a Simple Cycle Gas Turbine (SCGT) 
peaking power generating station, fuelled by natural gas with a rated electrical output of 
up to 299 Megawatts (MW). The Power Generation Plant comprises: 
1. Generating equipment including up to five gas turbine generators, up to five exhaust 
gas flue stacks  and balance of plant, which are located within the Generating 
Equipment Site (together the "Generating Equipment"); 
2. A new purpose built access road from Green Lane to the Generating Equipment Site 
(the "Access Road");  
3. A temporary construction compound required during construction only (the "Laydown 
Area");

electricity and subsequent export of that electricity to the NETS. The land upon which the 
Project would be developed, or which would be required in order to facilitate the development 
of the Project, is referred to as the ‘Project Site’ The Project is described in more detail in 
Section 2, including the options currently under consideration for the Gas Connection and 
Electrical Connection. 
The Power Generation Plant Site is located primarily on land within former clay pits known as 
‘The Rookery’, with the Gas and Electrical Connections extending from The Rookery into 
adjacent agricultural land. 
1.7 
Methodology and Report Format 
The PBA methodology for ground condition contamination assessment is presented in 
Appendix 1. 
The underlying principle is the evaluation of pollutant linkages in order to assess whether the 
presence of a source of contamination could potentially lead to harmful consequences. A 
pollutant linkage consists of the following three elements: 
� 
A source of contamination or hazard that has the potential to cause harm or pollution; 
� 
A pathway for the hazard to move along / generate exposure; and 
� 
A receptor which is affected by the hazard.  
For each potential pollutant linkage identified the risk is estimated through consideration of the 
magnitude of the potential consequences and the likelihood or probability of an event 
occurring. 
This report is divided into chapters identifying potential sources (hazard identification), 
potential pathway and receptor identification and risk estimation and assessment. 
The ground stability assessment includes a review of all the available historical ground 
investigation information relating to the proposed application site and published information 
relating to the geoenvironmental setting. The primary geotechnical objective of this study was 
to undertake an assessment of the geotechnical constraints present at the proposed 
application site in accordance with NPPF in order to assist with informing the DCO application 
for future redevelopment of the site.

Land Use Information 
2.1 
Introduction 
This section presents a summary of current and historical land uses on and immediately 
adjacent to the Project Site. Land use is used to inform the hazard identification element of the 
risk assessment. 
The current land use information is based on a walkover inspection undertaken by PBA on the 
4th August 2014. Photographs taken during the site walkover (Plates 1 to 6) are presented in 
Appendix 2.  
The historical land use information is based largely on archive information held by PBA, 
supplemented by Ordnance Survey maps and aerial photography provided by Landmark and 
presented in Appendix 3. 
The main features noted during the site walkover are marked on the Site Layout Plan (Figure 
2). 
For simplicity and ease of reading, the site descriptions have been split into three sections; the 
site of the generating equipment and laydown area (Generating Equipment Site) in the base of 
the Rookery South Pit, the Access Route providing connectivity between the Generating 
Equipment Site and Green Lane, and the area of the Electrical Connections adjacent to the 
south of the clay pit (Electrical Connection Area). 
2.2 
Current Land Use 
2.2.1 
On-Site – Generating Equipment Site (Generating Equipment Site, Laydown Area)  
The Generating Equipment Site of the site lies within the base of the Rookery South clay pit. 
The pit is currently some 15m lower than the natural surrounding ground level. The base of 
the pit in this area is roughly level and sparsely vegetated, with no features of note observed 
within the excavation. The southern part of the site area includes the southern bank of the clay 
pit, which is again sparsely vegetated. The western bank lies immediately beyond the western 
boundary of this part of the site, and comprises a split level pit edge slope. 
2.2.2 
On-site – Access Route  
The Access Route to the Generating Equipment Site is located in the base of the Rookery 
South pit at its southernmost extent. The access road then turns west and curves to the north 
and runs along the western site boundary between Rookery North Pit lake and the Bedford to 
Bletchley railway line, that is currently occupied by an access track and a hedgerow running 
alongside the railway line. The Access Route meets Green Lane at its northernmost extent. 
2.2.3 
On-Site – Electrical Connection Area  
The section of the site currently comprises agricultural land located adjacent to the south and 
southeast of the Rookery South clay pit. The land comprises around sixteen discrete fields. At 
the time of the walkover the land was mainly cropped with wheat.  
The land rises to the crest of a hill some 600m to the south of the clay pit with maximum 
elevation of around 71 mAOD. This higher ground generally runs in a northwest/southeast 
direction, with land falling to the north towards the clay pit.  
The London, Midland and Scottish mainline railway line runs through the central parts of this 
site area in a north-south direction. Millbrook Road also crosses the eastern portion of this site

area, orientated in a northeast-southwest direction; Millbrook Road crosses the mainline 
railway some 400m to the north of the southern site boundary.  
33kV electricity pylons cross part of the Electrical Connection area. These enter along the 
central southern boundary of the site some 100m to the west of the railway. The pylons run in 
a north-westerly direction and exit the site boundary immediately to the south of South Pillinge 
Farm.  
Two small watercourses (drainage ditches) are marked on the OS map as flowing through this 
land, one parallel to the west of the railway and another 500m to the west of the railway

Summary of On-Site Historical Land Use 
2.3.1 
Electrical Connection Area 
� 
The earliest available historical map (1883/1884) shows the Electrical Connection area to be 
undeveloped and comprise around twenty agricultural fields. The London, Midland and Scottish 
Railway is shown to bisect the eastern part of this land orientated in a north-south direction. 
Millbrook Road is marked within the eastern part of this area crossing the railway line via a bridge 
within the southeast corner. A small house and a well are marked close to the southern boundary 
adjacent to the east of Millbrook Road. Several drains running along field boundaries and tracks 
cross the area as well as two footpaths. An area of woodland in the south-western quadrant 
occupies approximately a fifth of the site area. Around eight small ponds are present within the 
eastern third of the site, possibly for livestock purposes. 
� 
The next available map dated 1901 shows few on-site land-use changes. A small (70m x 100m) 
area of raised land labelled as ‘Rises’ is marked adjacent to the west of the railway line, close to 
the Millbrook Road bridge crossing. It is unclear from the map what this is used for.

� 
No further on-site land-use changes could be identified until the map dated 1978, whereby 
electricity pylons and associated cables are marked crossing this part of the site. The route of the 
pylons enters the site along the central part of the southern boundary and exits along the western 
boundary, 200m to the south of South Pillinge Farm. 
� 
On the map dated 1990 the small ponds are no longer marked, and are assumed to have been 
infilled 
� 
The 2006 map indicates that some of the field boundaries have been removed to make way for 
larger fields. The field drainage is more clearly marked with a drain running from close to the 
railway bridge in a northerly direction to the edge of the Rookery South clay pit, then tuning in a 
westerly direction towards South Pillinge Farm. 
� 
The 2014 map shows no changes in land-use except for a ‘mast’ that is shown to have been 
erected adjacent to the east of the railway in the north of the site area. 
2.3.2 
Generating Equipment Site 
� 
The earliest available map indicates this area of the site falls within the boundaries of four 
agricultural fields. Two farm tracks originating from South Pillinge Farm cross this area.  
� 
No land use changes are marked in this area of the site until the map dated 1982. This map 
shows that this part of the site and the extreme north of the Electrical Connection area is occupied 
by a clay pit, extending beyond the north of the site area and forming part of the wider Rookery 
South clay pit.  
� 
By 2006 the clay pit is marked as disused with no features whatsoever marked within this part of 
the site, understood to now occupy part of the base of the clay pit. 
2.3.3 
Access Road 
� 
The earliest available map (1883) shows the proposed route of the access road to run alongside 
the Bedford Branch of the London and Northwest Railway, through four agricultural fields. No 
further features of note are marked within this site area. 
� 
No changes in on-site land use are marked until the map dated 1982. This area of the site now 
lies wholly within the clay pits of Rookery South and Rookery North (marked as disused). A 
conveyor and an access track are marked running along the western pit boundary, these fall within 
the boundary of the access road where it follows this part of the site. An electrical substation is 
also marked within this area located some 300m to the south of Green Lane adjacent to the 
access track. 
� 
The Map dated 2006 indicates that the part of the site which falls within the Rookery North pit is 
occupied by water, expected to be the flooded base of the clay pit. The conveyor remains along 
the western boundary although it is now shown to run in an easterly direction at the junction of the 
Rookery South and Rookery North pits. The base of the Rookery South pit is not shown to be 
flooded at this time. 
� 
The next available map (2014) shows little change in the land use of this part of the site. Some 
water is now shown within the base of the Rookery South pit, and this is shown to underlie the 
eastern extent of this access road. 
2.4 
Summary of Notable Off-Site Historical Land Uses 
� 
The earliest available Ordnance Survey maps from 1889 – 1892 show that the proposed 
application site was situated in open agricultural land. The railway lines that border the Rookery 
Pits were already constructed at this time and Millbrook Station had been developed (700m to the 
southwest of the Generating Equipment Site) in association with the western railway line. The

Morteyns Arms Inn was also present adjacent to the station at this time. The settlement of 
‘Wooton Pillinge’ is marked approximately 1.2km north of the proposed application site, and to the 
north of that, the early stages of the Pillinge Brickworks are shown (approx 1.8km N of the 
Generating Equipment Site). A group of buildings labelled as ‘Pillinge Farm South’ were located 
400m to the southwest of the Generating Equipment Site and ‘Magpie Hall’ was situated 400m to 
the east of the Generating Equipment Site. A number of footpaths and land drains ran across the 
area. 
� 
The maps from 1901 show some small developments at the Millbrook Station with construction of 
a ‘goods shed’. The ‘Pillinge Brickworks’ are shown to have undergone expansion, with two new 
clay pits shown adjacent to the railway line. Two semi-detached properties, marked as ‘Pillinge 
Cottages, are also shown on the 1901 maps approximately 150m south of Pillinge Farm South. 
� 
A ‘Brickworks’ is first noted on the 1902 map approximately 500m to the north of the Green Lane. 
Expansion of this brickworks site takes place over the subsequent decades, with an engine house 
marked by 1927. The clay pits adjacent to the west of the brickworks site are shown to have 
expanded and have reached their maximum extent by 1927. Significant expansion of the site is 
shown on the map dated 1938 with the Pillinge Brickworks site now renamed as the Stewartby 
Brickworks occupying a large area of land to the north of Green Lane. Continued expansion is 
shown up until the map dated 1983. By 1983 the site occupies an area of some 700m x 1800m 
with numerous chimneys, tanks kilns and conveyors marked. The Brickworks site now bounds the 
land adjacent to the north of Green Lane, some 50m to the north of the northern boundary of the 
proposed access road for the subject site. 
� 
The 1938 maps show the start of construction of the village of Stewartby immediately to the north 
of Rookery North (1.2km N of the Generating Equipment Site).  
� 
The commencement of clay extraction from Rookery North occurred in around 1960 with 
excavations starting in the north and progressing southwards. The excavations within Rookery 
North were nearing completion at the southern extent of the pit by the early 1970’s. Further 
excavations progressed on the southern side of the central causeway within the Rookery South Pit 
and continued up until about 1986.  
� 
Station Road was constructed in the early 1970s, connecting the town of Millbrook (to the south of 
the Generating Equipment Site) with Millbrook Station (to the southwest of the Generating 
Equipment Site). 
� 
South Pillinge Farm was extended with construction of seven new outbuildings in the late 1970s. 
Pillinge Cottages (two semi detached properties), situated 140m south of the farm buildings, and 
an electrical sub-station, situated 250m north of the farm buildings, were also constructed at this 
time.  
� 
Anecdotal accounts and review of historical aerial photographs suggest that the Rookery North pit 
was partially backfilled during the period from about 1971 to 1997. The Envirocheck report has 
indicated that the Rookery North pit was licensed as a ‘co-disposal landfill’. Further details 
provided by the Environment Agency have indicated that non-hazardous organic waste from a 
variety of local industrial sources were mixed with surface waters from the Rookery Pit and 
‘Callow’ deposits (see Section 5) and pumped into the base of the pit. The licensed area for these 
operations covered all of the Rookery North pit and the northern third of the Rookery South pit. A 
copy of the Environment Agency plan showing the extent of the licence boundary shows details of 
the waste sources as follows: non-notifiable mineral wastes (including ‘neosid’ ferrite sludge, lime 
and water from water softening treatments and Hargreaves fertiliser waste), food wastes (from 
Coca Cola, Rosa Poultry, Telfers and Unilever), leather wastes and gelatine wastes from ‘Croda’. 
� 
The 1983 maps show expansion of the village of Stewartby and the Stewartby Brickworks, to the 
north of the proposed application site. The brick pit adjacent to the Stewartby Brickworks is now 
shown to be partly occupied by land  .and development of a large open area marked as a ‘vehicle 
proving ground’ 750m to the southwest of the proposed application site. The pits previously 
excavated to the northwest of the proposed application site are shown to be flooded and are

marked as ‘Stewartby Lake’. Just to the south of Stewartby Lake, and to the west of the proposed 
application site, an additional lake is present. This area was further altered in the period between 
1999 and 2008 when additional lakes had been created as wetland habitats (the ‘Marston Vale 
Millennium Country Park’). 
� 
An engineering works is noted some 250m to the southeast of the site boundary of the Electrical 
Connection area, marked within Reddings’s Wood. Further expansion is shown on the map dated 
1978 along with a factory. By 1990 several new buildings have been constructed, with the site now 
marked as an Engineering Research Establishment.

Environmental Setting 
3.1 
Geology  
3.1.1 
Geological Map and Regional Geology 
According to the British Geological Survey (BGS) Geological Maps (1:50,000 Sheet 203 and 
1:10,000 Sheet TL 04 SW) the solid geology of the area generally consists of the following 
sequence of strata: 
� 
The Peterborough Member of the Oxford Clay Formation (highly plastic fossiliferous 
clay);  
� 
Underlain by the Kellaways Formation (sandy clays and clayey sands of the Kellaways 
Sand Member with an underlying stiff shelly clay called the Kellaways Clay Member);  
� 
Underlain by the Cornbrash Formation (limestone) and the Blisworth Clay Formation and 
Blisworth Limestone Formation at depth.  
In the area of the proposed electrical Electrical Connection apparatus in the south of the site 
the geological map records unworked Oxford Clay comprising the Stewartby Member and the 
Weymouth Member which underlies the vast majority of this area. The Peterborough Member 
of the Oxford Clay is shown to outcrop in the northwest corner of the Electrical Connection 
area. 
Small sections of the site area are indicated by the map as having superficial Quaternary 
Valley Gravel and Alluvium present, associated with former and current streams adjacent to 
the east of the railway line, albeit some of these deposits may have been removed by the 
more recent clay extraction works. A further tract of alluvial deposits is shown on the 
geological map being present adjacent to the east of South Pillinge Farm. Quaternary head 
deposits comprising clay, silt, sand and gravel are also marked in some parts of the site, 
namely along the southwestern boundary adjacent to south Pillinge Farm and another area in 
the southeast of the Electrical Connection area adjacent to Millbrook Road, and along Ampthill 
Road. 
Superficial Deposits and weathered Oxford Clay were unsuitable for the brickmaking process 
and this material was removed and cast back into the pit. Locally it was called Callow and for 
the purposes of this report is called Callow, when in-situ, and Callow Clay Fill, when disturbed 
and placed at a new location. The Callow Clay Fill sometimes contains brick fragments 
because broken brick rubble was used for making temporary pads and machinery stands. 
Generally excavations left around 0.5 to 1.0m of remnant Oxford Clay in the base of the pit 
overlying the Kellaways Sand, although this was dependant on the workmanship of the 
machine operators and in places the layer of remnant clay is thicker or absent. 
The unweathered Oxford Clay was called Knotts by the local brickmaking industry. The Oxford 
Clay Formation supported a major brickmaking industry locally because its high organic 
content reduced the amount of fuel required to ‘fire’ the clay, and its carbonate content was 
ideally suited to brickmaking. 
Historical clay extraction from the Rookery Pit has resulted in ground levels in the base of the 
pit some 15m – 25m lower than the surrounding ground. 
3.1.2 
Site Specific Ground Conditions from Previous Ground Investigations 
Information on the ground conditions from within the site have been taken from CL Associates 
(2000) and with reference to wider BGS records, and other studies undertaken by PBA in the 
vicinity of the site within Rookery South and North pits including PBA (2009b) and PBA (2011).

Copies of the exploratory hole records that fall within or close to the site area are presented in 
Appendix 4.  
Electrical Connection Area 
Exploratory hole records for this area are only present in the northwestern corner of this part 
of the site. The records from within this area confirm the presence of ‘reworked topsoil’ 
comprising soft brown slightly sandy slightly gravelly clay to around 0.2m bgl. This was 
reportedly underlain by weathered Oxford Clay comprising soft and firm light orange brown 
mottled slightly sandy clay proven to around 3.5m bgl . This was underlain by Oxford Clay 
recorded as firm dark green brown laminated very silty clay proven in the boreholes to depths 
of between 13.8m bgl (BH4) and 20.5m bgl (BH6). The Kellaways Formation was identified 
underlying the Oxford Clay, recorded as interbedded dark grey sand and firm grey green clay 
with occasional shell fragments. The Kellaways Formation was proven to between 19.75m bgl 
and 24.65m bgl in the areas investigated. The Cornbrash Formation recorded as dark grey 
fine to medium grained muddy limestone was identified underlying the Kellaways Formation, 
and was proven to a maximum depth of 24.9m bgl (BH6). 
Generating Equipment Site and Access Road  
On the basis of the available exploratory hole records, the strata thicknesses in the base of 
the pit are expected to be variable, although consistent in terms of sequencing. Made Ground 
in the form of Callow Clay fill was reported in several of the exploratory holes proven to a 
maximum depth of 4.70m in TP14, the base of the Made Ground was not proven in this 
location. In general the thicknesses of Made Ground (recorded as reworked clay comprising 
firm grey brown slightly gravelly cobbly clay) appear to be greater towards the centre of the pit. 
Where the exploratory holes are closer to the edges of the pit, the thicknesses of Made 
Ground are less or it is altogether absent. In BH13 Made Ground was recorded to a depth of 
0.45m bgl, underlain by Oxford Clay proven to a depth of 4.0m bgl. This was underlain by the 
Kellaways Formation proven to 8.4m bgl, and then by the Cornbrash Formation proven to a 
depth of 8.8m bgl. The base of the Cornbrash was not proven. 
Since the base of the pit is roughly level, on the basis of the exploratory hole records it is 
anticipated to be underlain by a thickness of either around 4m of Callow Clay or remnant 
Oxford Clay or a combination of the two depending on the location within the base of the pit.  
3.1.3 
Slope Stability 
Rookery South 
At the time of the site walkover the majority of the western face of the Rookery South pit was 
observed to be formed at angles of 1Vertical(V):2Horizontal(H) to 1V:3H. The slope here rises 
from the base of the pit at approximately 26m AOD to 28m AOD to a bench level at 
approximately 38m AOD. The upper bench is approximately 30m in width, with a second slope 
further westwards rising to the perimeter level at approximately 42m AOD at an angle of 
approximately 1V:2.5H.  
On the northern section of the western face, in the vicinity of the proposed access ramp, the 
slope profile is formed at characteristically lower gradients. The toe of the slope is situated 
along the same alignment as the section further south but the width of the upper bench is 
reduced from 30m to approximately 12m. The resultant slope is at a lower gradient than that 
further south and is formed at angles of 1V:3.5H to 1V:4H. 
Inspection of the western pit face has not revealed the presence of significant failures other 
than minor slope wash and sloughing in the exposed face in places. 
Rookery North 
Within the Rookery North pit the southern and eastern pit faces have all been modified by the 
placement of sludge fill material covered with Callow Clay Fill in the base of the pit, forming 
shallow gradient slopes of around 1V:16H, that fan out from apparent deposition locations in

the south-eastern parts of the pit. These deposits typically extend part way up the pit faces but 
in the south-eastern corner of the pit, the bank of deposits extends up to the level of the 
central causeway at approximately 52m AOD. The western and north-western faces, where 
they boarder to the access road, appear to be at their as cut angles of approximately 1V:2H to 
1V:3H. However, the full height of these faces is obscured by the water body in the pit and 
only the Callow faces can be seen. 
Several small scale failures were noted within the exposed Callow faces along the central 
parts of the northern wall, i.e to the east of the new junction and access road. These small 
scale features have resulted in near vertical back scars of typically 1m – 2m in height. These 
failures coincide with the water levels within the lake and appear to represent a wave cut 
platform formed as a result of wave erosion affecting the stability of the Callow material. 
3.1.4 
Naturally Occurring Geological Hazards 
An assessment of potential geological hazards that may give rise to instability or adverse 
foundation or construction conditions as supplied by the British Geological Survey (BGS) from 
their National Geoscience Information Service (NGIS) are presented in the Envirocheck 
Report reproduced in Appendix 3. The generic assessment is generated automatically based 
on digital geological maps and the scope and the accuracy is limited by the methods used to 
create the dataset and the excavations and landform modifications undertaken at the site. The 
BGS dataset is therefore only relavent for the search area. 
The information contained in the Groundsure Report has been reviewed and where 
considered necessary reassessed considering the specific information available for the site. 
The modified assessment of the potential for geological hazards to be present on the site is 
summarised in Table 3.1 below.

PBA would generally agree with the above assessments indicating that the site generally has 
a low or very low potential for being affected by the majority of geological hazards.  
The exceptions to this are hazards associated with landslide ground stability which are 
anticipated to be related to the slopes of the Rookery South clay pit that cross part of the 
subject site.  
Given the implementation of the Low Level Restoration Scheme before commencement of the 
project, this risk will be reduced to the level of very low through the regrading of the side 
slopes of the pit to a slope angle that will provide long term stability. 
Compressible ground stability hazards are highlighted as moderate owing to the presence of 
callow clay fill within the base of the clay pit. Some of this fill will be in its ‘as placed’ un-
engineered condition and will be susceptible to long term consolidation settlement under its 
self-weight and/or any surface applied loads. Some engineered fill will be placed over the 
areas of callow clay fill to deliver the LLRS. PBA would tend to agree with this assessment on 
the basis of the exploratory hole records present within the site footprint, that suggest variable

proportions of compressible callow clay fill up to 4m thick may underlie parts of the Generating 
Equipment Site. 
3.1.5 
Radon 
The Indicative Radon Atlas of England from Public Health England indicates the site is located 
in an area where no radon protective measures are necessary in the construction of new 
dwellings or extensions. 
3.1.6 
Natural and Non-Coal Mining Cavity Records – Cavity Searches 
A search of the PBA Natural and Non-Coal Mining Cavities Databases indicates that there are 
no known cavity locations within 2000m of the site boundary. 
3.2 
Hydrogeology 
According to the Environment Agency website, the Oxford Clay, Kellaways Clay and the 
Blisworth Clay Formations are classified as Unproductive Strata, with the Cornbrash 
Formation a Secondary A Aquifer and the Blisworth Limestone Formation and Kellaways Sand 
a Principal Aquifer. 
The clayey deposits of the Callow Clay Fill, Oxford Clay, Kellaways Clay and Blisworth Clay 
Formation have been shown to be of extremely low permeability and can be considered as 
being aquicludes. Whilst the Kellaways Sand and Cornbrash Formation are classified as Minor 
Aquifers, they have been shown by extensive investigation for the brickmaking, landfill/waste 
deposition industry and other developments, to be insignificant for water resources purposes 
in this region due to their limited thickness, low permeability and poor water quality. These 
formations are considered herein to act as aquitards. The Blisworth Limestone Formation has 
been shown to be of a slightly higher permeability but also of naturally poor water quality.  
The elevation of the base of the pit inside the development area is between 27m and 30m 
AOD, and once the LLRS has been implemented the base of the pit is expected to lie between 
31.6m and 31.0m AOD. Piezometric levels underlying the pit floor have been recorded at 
approximately 28m AOD to 29.5m AOD in the Kellaways Sand, approximately 27m AOD – 
29.5m AOD in the Cornbrash Formation and approximately 30m AOD – 32m AOD in the 
Blisworth Limestone Formation. Although there is no evidence at all to suggest that hydraulic 
uplift (or heave) caused by groundwater pressures has occurred in the pit base in the past, 
assessments of the potential for hydraulic uplift have shown that the factor of safety is 
acceptable and there is no risk of heave occurring once the LLRS has been implemented. 
These assessments are given in PBA 2009 and PBA 2009b. 
A summary of the permeabilities of the strata underlying the site and the respective 
groundwater elevations are presented in Table 3.2 below.

Hydrology – Summary of Surface Water Monitoring Results 
Assessment of the quality of the surface water bodies in the vicinity of Rookery Pit has been 
undertaken since 1999. During this time surface water samples have been taken from the 
lakes in Rookery South and Rookery North, Harrowden Brook, Elstow Brook, the drainage 
ditches to the south (the Mill Brook tributary) and west (Mill Brook watercourse) of the site and 
Stewartby Lake to the west of the proposed application site. A summary of the historical data 
is presented in the PBA (2009b) report. 
Monitoring of the surface water quality within the lake in Rookery South, previously 
undertaken by CLA in 1999 – 2000, recorded elevated sulphate levels (1,500mg/kg – 
2,000mg/kg) and electrical conductivity levels (2,800µS/cm – 3050µS/cm) but no other 
determinants tested were significantly elevated against the screening criteria such as 
cyanides, metals and potential organic contaminants. Similar conditions were recorded within 
the lake in the Rookery North pit at the same time. Monitoring of the surface waters within the 
ditches and brooks surrounding the Rookery Pits, undertaken at the same time, recorded 
similar conditions, albeit that the sulphate concentrations and electrical conductivity values 
were generally lower than within the lakes. 
Monitoring of the surface water quality within Elstow Brook and the lakes in the Rookery North 
and Rookery South pits and the Stewartby Lake has been undertaken on four occasions by 
PBA (in June – August 2008, January 2009 and April 2011) as part of a study of the wider 
Marston Vale area. Water samples were analysed for suspended soils, copper, lead, zinc, 
phosphorus, dissolved oxygen, Biological Oxygen Demand, sulphate, ammonia, chloride, 
electrical conductivity, nitrate, pH and Total Petroleum Hydrocarbons. The results showed 
similar characteristics as the data collected previously by CLA, with electrical conductivity 
levels and sulphate concentrations elevated within the lakes on the Rookery North and 
Rookery South pits but lower concentrations within the surrounding water bodies. Based upon 
the recorded BOD and ammonia results, water quality would be classified as Class A (very 
good) according to the Environment Agency GQA scheme. 
3.5 
Landfill Records 
According to the Envirocheck Report there is a landfill marked within the footprint of the 
Rookery North and the northern third of the Rookery South pits. The licence is held by London 
Brick Landfill Ltd at Rookery Clay Pit. Input dates were between 1971 and 1987 with 
deposited waste including industrial and household waste and liquid sludge. No other landfills 
are noted within 500m of the site boundary. 
Previous investigations confirm that the Rookery South pit was not used for landfilling of 
household waste or liquid sludge, although the base of the pit has been proven to be 
underlain by a variable thickness of reworked clay in the form of Callow Clay Fill. It is 
understood a small area in the northeast corner of the Rookery South pit is underlain by a 
greater thickness of reworked clay that forms a lobe shaped feature. Extensive investigation of 
this feature (PBA 2011) suggests that it is inert and comprises reworked Callow Clay Fill, and 
does not include liquid wastes, sludges or household waste. Its origins are not entirely clear; 
however it is possible that this feature formed as a result of a land slip or from deposited clay 
overburden. 
Previous testing undertaken on the Callow Clay fill and lobe feature in Rookery South (PBA 
2011) indicates that the materials are inert in nature with low concentrations of potential 
contaminants with regard to the proposed end-use.  
The Stewartby Landfill site is marked some 50m to the northwest of the location of the access 
road. EA records suggest this site last received waste in 1986 and the site received inert, 
household, industrial, commercial and special wastes.

Baseline Conditions - Groundwater Analysis 
4.1 
Introduction 
On the 18th and 19th November 2014 the Project Site was visited to obtain surface water and 
groundwater samples from several locations in order to assess the surface water and 
groundwater quality. 
Samples were obtained from the following locations and strata/source:

It was not possible to obtain water samples from boreholes BH8, BH2, BH3 and BH4, because 
the installations at these locations were lost/destroyed and consequently samples could not be 
recovered. 
4.2 
Rationale 
4.2.1 
Laboratory Selection 
Geoenvironmental testing was performed by Derwentside Environmental Testing Services 
(DETS). The designated laboratory is one of two approved by PBA and which holds UKAS 
certification and has MCERTS and/or ISO accreditation for the majority of tests scheduled.   
Analytical testing for potential contaminants that might be associated with the past use of the 
site were scheduled on groundwater and surface water samples recovered from the site. In 
addition reference was also made with the historic testing undertaken at the site to  
A total of 12 water samples were taken from the nine boreholes and three surface water 
locations.  Table 5.2 details the geoenvironmental water testing scheduled by PBA.

A dedicated length of 13mm Waterra tubing was used in each of the boreholes sampled to 
mitigate the potential for cross contamination.

The standpipes were purged (where possible) to ensure representative sampling of the 
groundwater body by removing three well volumes; this included both the volume of water 
within the standpipe itself and the volume contained within any filter pack placed around the 
standpipe.  
Each groundwater sample consisted of two glass vials, a one litre glass bottle and a one litre 
plastic bottle. 
As the water samples being obtained were considered to potentially contain volatile 
hydrocarbons, contact time with air was kept to a minimum. The sample was immediately 
sealed with no headspace and stored in a cool box.  
The water samples were stored in cool boxes containing ice packs pending transportation.  
The samples were transported to the laboratory (by overnight courier) on the day after 
collection.

In general the groundwater elevations within the Kellaway Sands are broadly similar to the 
available historic data. The groundwater elevations in the base of the pit are around 
28.7mAOD and are consistent with the previous records. In BH102 which is located on the 
split level pit edge slope, the groundwater elevations recorded in November 2014 are around 
0.9m lower than those recorded during the last monitoring visit in 2009.  
BH206 which is screened within the Cornbrash Formation in the base of the pit recorded a 
broadly similar elevation to that recorded in 2009 at around 23.5m AOD. 
Boreholes BH5, BH6 and BH12 are located around the perimeter of the Rookery South pit and 
are screened within the Kellaways Sand. The recent groundwater elevations recorded are 
around 0.7m lower during the recent round than the elevations recorded in 2009, although are 
broadly comparable.

The rationale for selection of generic assessment criteria routinely used by PBA has been 
used and a copy is presented in Appendix 5.   
The groundwater bodies underlying the site locally are not abstracted for potable use and the 
site is subsequently not within a groundwater source protection zone. Test 2 Screening criteria 
for groundwater have therefore been selected as the screening criteria for groundwater 
impacts on a surface water body. 
4.4.2 
Review of Historical Testing Results 
In general, groundwater quality in the Kellaways Sand, the Cornbrash Formation and the 
Blisworth Limestone Formation in the region has been identified as being poor with saline 
conditions reported from the majority of reports and investigations (PBA, 2009b).  
Historical monitoring of water quality within the Kellaways Formation and the Blisworth 
Limestone Formation (undertaken on 15 occasions during the period February 2000 – 
November 2002 by CLA within the monitoring boreholes installed as part of the CLA (2000) 
investigations) has confirmed that the quality of the groundwater within the Kellaways 
Formation and the Blisworth Limestone Formation is similar in nature, and is generally poor 
with elevated concentrations of electrical conductivity, chloride, sulphate, ammoniacal 
nitrogen, boron and zinc when compared to the relevant assessment criteria at the time. 
The historical groundwater monitoring data was supplemented by groundwater samples taken 
from the Kellaways Formation as part of the PBA 2010 investigation from a total of three 
locations on two occasions. In general, the recent 2010 quality data was similar to that 
previously recorded by CLA. During the PBA 2010 investigation, hydrocarbon analysis of the 
groundwater retained from the Kellaways Formation from BH103 (on one occasion) recorded 
a concentration of 0.026mg/l. A subsequent sample was taken from the same borehole and 
the result showed a concentration below the detection limit. It is likely that the initial 
concentration was the result of remnant dilute drilling fluid within the borehole at the time of 
sampling on the first occasion, which has now been removed by the sampling and purging 
process.

The results from the recent groundwater monitoring are included within Appendix 5. In general, the 
recent groundwater quality data is broadly similar to the available historic data from 2010 with the 
exception of BOD, COD, Total Suspended Solids, Total Dissolved Solids, EPH and PAH 
concentrations which were all generally higher in BH103, BH104 and BH105 and during the recent 
sampling round.  
� 
Generally the samples had low concentrations of inorganics with none of the samples 
exceeding any of the adopted screening criteria. 
� 
One concentration of Flouranthene within BH206 exceeded the adopted screening 
criterion for the protection of controlled waters. 
� 
Concentrations of Extractable Petroleum Hydrocarbons (EPH) were generally recorded at 
low concentrations at the site (<100µg/l). The exceptions to this are slightly elevated EPH 
concentrations within BH5, BH102 and particularly within BH206 which recorded an EPH 
concentration of 2739µg/l. BH206 is screened within the Cornbrash Formation and the 
sample contained a very high sediment content reflected by a suspended solids 
concentration of 100000mg/l. It is expected that this entrained sediment content has 
originated from the organic rich Oxford Clay, and consequently this is reflected in the 
results. There are no known hydrocarbon sources in the vicinity of the site and as such 
the slightly elevated EPH concentrations in these boreholes are not expected to be 
noteworthy or reminiscent of anthropogenic contamination within the groundwater 
beneath the site.  
� 
Concentrations of individual PAH compounds were generally not recorded above the 
laboratory method detection level in any of the samples analysed. The one exception to 
this is a concentration of Fluoranthene (3.4µg/l) in BH206 that exceeded the screening 
criterion of 0.1µg/l. This sample also contains and elevated EPH concentration expected 
to be a result of a high sediment content entrained within the sample. It is not expected 
that this exceedance is significant or noteworthy.  
In summary, the quality of the groundwater recorded is considered to be naturally occurring 
and typical of baseline conditions in similar geological settings. There are no indicators of 
anthropogenic contamination.

Tier 1 Preliminary Risk Assessment 
5.1 
Introduction 
The methodology developed and adopted by PBA for the assessment of ground conditions is 
presented in Appendix 1. In accordance with guidance presented in CLR 11 (EA Model 
Procedures for the Management of Land Contamination) we adopt a staged approach to risk 
assessment and this report presents a preliminary Tier 1 assessment. 
The underlying principle to ground condition assessment is the identification of pollutant 
linkages in order to evaluate whether the presence of a source of contamination could 
potentially lead to harmful consequences.  
5.2 
Conceptual Site Model 
The Tier 1 Preliminary Risk Assessment includes the development of a conceptual site model 
(CSM). The CSM describes the types and locations of potential contamination sources, the 
identification of potential receptors and the identification of potential transport/migration 
pathways. 
For a pollutant linkage to be identified a connection between all three elements (source-
pathway-receptor) is required. 
5.3 
Geoenvironmental Hazard Identification 
5.3.1 
On-Site - Electrical Connection Area 
This part of the site is currently occupied by agricultural farmland, and historical map evidence 
suggests this has always been the case. Given the intended use of this part of the site to 
provide an electrical and gas Electrical Connection there are not anticipated to be any 
pollutant linkages present, since no significant plausible contamination sources have been 
identified and the end use will not introduce any new receptors.  
The risk assessment has therefore only been taken forward for the Generating Equipment Site 
and the Access Road, where new plant, infrastructure and potential human heath receptors 
are expected to be introduced.  
5.3.2 
On-site – Generating Equipment Site and Access Road 
The site is in the southwest corner of a much larger former clay pit. The brickworks 
manufacturing operation was located approximately 1.3km north of the site, and consequently 
any potential contamination sources linked to the process of manufacturing and firing of bricks 
are expected to be located far enough away to not affect the subject site. 
A notable thickness of Callow Clay Fill (CCF) typically around 2.5m thick, but possibly in 
excess of 4.7m thick has been confirmed to be present across the Generating Equipment Site. 
This CCF has been recorded to take the form of reworked clay with occasional brick 
fragments and is consequently not expected to contain any significantly elevated 
concentrations of potential contaminants. Whilst contamination testing data is not available 
from the exploratory holes within the Generating Equipment Site itself, data is available from 
other exploratory holes within the Rookery South pit. The results of contamination testing 
undertaken by both CLA 2000 and by PBA 2009b for the consented Covanta RRF scheme are 
considered to be representative of the Generating Equipment Site because the historical and 
geographical setting of the Generating Equipment Site is identical to that of the wider pit area. 
Testing from the exploratory holes immediately adjacent to the Generating Equipment Site did 
not show any evidence of elevated concentrations of potential contaminants.

FINAL.docx 
23 
Whilst there is the potential for small pockets of sporadic and discreet localised contamination 
to be present within the CCF, it is considered that the frequency and magnitude of any such 
localised contamination will be very small based upon the currently available information. 
Experience in contaminated land assessment by PBA of many other brickmaking sites from 
the same era in the former London Brick Company (LBC) landholding has indicated that the 
historical industrial activity of clay excavation and casting back of overburden, with 
reprofiling/landscaping carried out at these sites does not in itself give rise to significant levels 
of land contamination.  
The potential for contamination to be present based on the past and present site use is 
assessed as classification score ‘1’; Very Low. (see Table 1, Appendix 1). 
5.3.3 
Ground gases 
The previous ground investigations have not encountered any significant quantities of organic 
materials within the deposits underlying the proposed application site; however the Oxford 
Clay Formation is known to contain clay of a high organic content. Together with the presence 
of CCF beneath the site area, there is expected to be a potential for the low concentrations of  
ground gases in the form of carbon dioxide. However, due to the very low permeability of the 
Oxford Clay Formation, the potential for any ground gases to migrate to the surface, or 
laterally, is considered to be low. 
5.3.4 
Groundwater 
In general, groundwater quality in the Kellaways Sand, the Cornbrash Formation and the 
Blisworth Limestone Formation in the region has been identified as being poor with saline 
conditions reported from the majority of reports and investigations. In particular the 
Environmental Quality Standard (EQS) screening criteria have been exceeded for 
Ammoniacal Nitrogen, Boron, conductivity and Chloride. The concentrations recorded are 
considered to be naturally occurring and typical of baseline conditions in similar geological 
settings, and not a result of the on-site ground conditions. There are no indicators of 
anthropogenic contamination, and hydrocarbons have not been recorded above the screening 
criteria in the more recent analyses undertaken. 
5.3.5 
Surface Water  
Similarly, previous testing undertaken on the surface waters that form part of the wider site 
area indicate that elevated sulphate and electrical conductivity levels are present in the 
surface waters at the site. These were the only parameters that exceeded the screening 
criteria, and based on the results of the BOD and ammonia results the surface water quality 
would be assessed a Class A (Very Good) according to the Environment Agency CQA 
Scheme.  
In general, the surface water monitoring data largely reflects the chemistry of the groundwater 
data and shows that whilst naturally occurring substances are elevated within any relatively 
static water bodies (e.g Rookery North and Rookery South lakes), no significant 
anthropogenic contamination of the surface waters is occurring. 
5.3.6 
Off-Site 
The application area lies within a predominantly agricultural setting and consequently potential 
off-site sources of contamination were generally not identified. The exception to this is the 
Pillinge (Stewartby) Brickworks site and the Stewartby Landfill (which lie adjacent to the 
northern site boundary of the access road), the railway lines and sidings and South Pillinge 
Farm.  
Millbrook Vehicle Proving Ground is located adjacent to the southwest boundary of the 
Electrical Connection area; however there are no records of any pollution incidents arising

from this facility within the Envirocheck Report. Furthermore, the distance of these sources 
from the site boundary in conjunction with the expected low permeability of the underlying 
geology means that any off-site contamination (if present) is not likely to affect the subject site, 
because there are not expected to be any feasible transmission pathways.  
Given the observations made during the previous investigations and the groundwater and 
surface water quality data that has been previously collected from the wider Marston Vale 
area, it is considered that the risk to the application site associated with potential off-site 
contamination to be present based on the past and present off-site land-use is assessed as 
classification score ‘1’; Very Low. (see Table 1, Appendix 1).

5.5 
Risk Estimation 
Risk estimation involves predicting the likely consequence (what degree of harm might result) 
and the probability that the consequences will arise (how likely the outcome is). The table in 
Appendix 6 summarises the estimated risks for the identified pollutant linkages.  
When there is a pollutant linkage (and therefore some measure of risk) it is necessary to 
determine whether the risk matters and therefore whether further action is required. Risk 
estimation involves predicting the likely consequence (what degree of harm might result) and 
the probability that the consequences will arise (how likely the outcome is).  
The table in Appendix 6 presents an assessment of consequence and probability for each 
potential pollutant linkage identified. Based on the information available, and assuming a worst 
case scenario, the estimated risks have been designated as follows: 
� 
Human Health Future Users – Very Low 
� 
Human Health Construction Workers – Very Low 
� 
Groundwater – Very Low  
� 
Surface Water – Very Low  
� 
Buildings / Services – Very Low 
During construction phase the underlying ground will be exposed and there is an enhanced 
short term risk. 
The highest estimated risk of Very Low for human health is a function of: 
� 
The relative absence of any likely potential sources of contamination. 
� 
The relativeley low sensitivity of the proposed end use with regard to human health. 
� 
The low sensitivity of the environmental setting surrounding the site.  
A very low risk is defined as where ‘there is a low possibility that harm could arise to a 
receptor. In the event of such harm being realised it is not likely to be severe.’ 
5.5.1 
Ground Gases 
It is anticipated that the risks to human health arising from naturally occurring ground gases in 
the clay beneath the site will be low to moderate, and it is anticipated (subject to testing) that 
any confined spaces may require gas protection measures and/or passive ventilation. 
5.6 
Risk Evaluation  
Possible pollutant linkages are determined using professional judgement. If a linkage is 
considered possible, it is considered that this represents a potentially ‘unacceptable risk’ and 
therefore requires further consideration. This may be through remediation or mitigation or 
through further tiers of assessment. 
5.7 
Confidence and Uncertainty  
Based on the known current and historical land uses, the overall potential for significant or 
widespread contamination to be present on the site is considered to be Very Low. Based on 
the available information on ground conditions, the potential for any deleterious material 
producing hazardous ground gases to be present is considered to be Low to Moderate.

not likely to be site-wide gross contamination it is considered plausible, but unlikely, that there 
may be potential small scale, sporadic and discrete localised sources of contamination 
present on site that have not been identified as part of the current and previous studies.  An 
intrusive investigation would be required to provide actual ground condition data to confirm the 
presence/absence of contamination.

Preliminary Geotechnical Assessment 
6.1 
Introduction 
The following assessments have been undertaken in accordance with the NPPF, in order to 
determine whether the land is potentially unstable and identify any appropriate remedial, 
preventative or precautionary measures, as required. The assessments include consideration 
of the potential for unstable slopes, ground compression and shrinkage/heave in the context of 
the proposed development and the local geographical environment. 
The following sections of the report are based upon the geological / geotechnical information 
that has been collated from previous ground investigations and published information.  
6.2 
Implications of Proposed Low Level Restoration Scheme (LLRS) 
It is recognised that the proposed LLRS will take place prior to commencement of the 
development. The LLRS will include regrading levels within the base of the pit by cut and 
placement of engineered fill, including the winning of clay fill from parts of the wider area. The 
earthworks in the base of the pit will be undertaken by placing Oxford Clay Fill in layers to 
raise ground levels and produce a fall across the pit towards an attenuation pond in the 
northern part of the Rookery South pit. It is proposed that the resulting topographic levels 
beneath the Generating Equipment Site will be approximately 31.8m AOD – 31.2m AOD, 
which equates to a limited thickness of fill above current levels of circa 0.5m in places and cut 
of up to 1.2m. 
6.3 
Potential Ground Settlement 
Historically the Callow Clay Fill was placed in the base of the pit without any compaction or 
surcharge control measures having been implemented, and will have settled under its self-
weight ever since. Parts of the Rookery South Pit have previously become inundated with 
water, albeit these are largely located in areas away from the proposed Generating Equipment 
Site, but may affect the access route in the base of Rookery South pit. These deposits may 
therefore currently be present in a relatively soft and compressible nature. Any new fill placed 
in the base as part of the LLRS will therefore induce additional consolidation settlement of the 
underlying historical Callow Clay Fill. 
PBA have previously undertaken detailed research and analysis of the potential for 
settlements to be induced by loading of historical Callow Clay Fill in the base of similar pits 
excavated in the Oxford Clay. Assessments have included one dimensional consolidation 
analysis in the laboratory and monitoring of in-situ settlements caused by surcharge loading. 
Results of one-dimensional consolidation testing showed Mv values, which describe the total 
magnitude of settlement, generally in the range 0.3 m2/MN to 0.4 m2/MN. Corresponding Cv 
values, which describe the time required for settlement to occur, ranged from 0.2 m2/year to 
1.4 m2/year. It has, however, been recognised that the Cv values from consolidation tests 
show considerable variation and estimates of the time required for settlement to occur are 
sensitive to these variations. Back-analysis of the in-situ settlement recorded in association 
with the construction of an earth embankment over Callow Clay Fill estimated actual Cv values 
in the range 1.6 m2/year to 3 m2/year.  
Utilising relatively conservative values, with an Mv value of 0.4 m2/Mn and a Cv value of 2 
m2/year, preliminary calculations show that for 0.5m of engineered fill placed over 2.5m 
Callow Clay Fill total settlements of about less than 20mm can be expected. In areas where 
thicker deposits of Callow Clay Fill have been recorded, or alternatively where thicker deposits 
of engineered fill will be placed, larger settlements will take place. It is, however, recognised 
that some areas of relatively thick Callow Clay Fill form topographic high points and will 
therefore require less engineered fill in order to produce the required platform levels.

The currently envisaged programme for the placement of engineered fill as part of the LLRS 
and the subsequent development works suggests that construction will commence almost 
immediately after completion of the earthworks for the LLRS in the Generating Equipment Site 
and will be largely completed within 12 months. Given this timescale, settlement of the Callow 
Clay Fill induced by placement of any residual engineered fill will not be fully mobilised prior to 
construction and recognition of such should therefore be made in respect of the design of 
hard-surfacing and infrastructure not founded upon deeper naturally occurring materials, 
particularly in respect of any differential settlement that might occur. It may be necessary to 
incorporate mitigation measures into the design such as ground improvement or geogrid re-
inforcement to stiffen the ground present. 
Particular attention will need to be given to any areas where the characteristics and 
thicknesses of the underlying deposits vary across short distances such as at the edges of the 
pit. Here, there may be a considerable thickness on unimproved Callow Clay Fill banked 
against the relatively incompressible natural ground forming the steep original pit edge. 
Infrastructure such as roads, pavements and utilities could be at risk from unacceptably high 
magnitudes of differential settlement and careful consideration should be made of this risk in 
their design.  
6.4 
Access Road and Green Lane Junction 
The proposed development includes for provision of a new vehicular access junction from 
Green Lane into the existing open access area adjacent to the north-western corner of the 
Rookery North pit. In order to facilitate the required turning arcs for large construction vehicles 
the access road may pass relatively close to the perimeter crest of the pit. The design of the 
access road must therefore include assessment of the slope angle, the distance between the 
road and the slope and the resultant slope stability.  
Improvements to the slope profile within Rookery North pit in the north-western corner 
following further bathymetric surveys and stability analysis have been submitted and approved 
as part of the discharge of the LLRS planning conditions. 
6.5 
Foundations 
The ground conditions on the proposed application site are, in general, expected to form a 
suitable platform for the construction of proposed facility. For very lightly loaded elements of 
the proposed facility and elements that are able to tolerate differential movements, shallow 
spread footings constructed within the remaining Oxford Clay, and possibly in the overlying 
Callow Clay Fill and engineered development platform fill, could be an appropriate option.  
6.6 
Floor Slabs and Pavements 
Based upon the expected ground conditions present on the Generating Equipment Site, 
comprising Callow Clay Fill overlain by a limited thickness of engineered fill placed in the base 
of the pit as part of the LLRS, it is expected that lightly loaded ground bearing floor slabs and 
pavements constructed on a suitable depth of capping/sub-base and reinforced by geogrid as 
necessary will prove adequate.  
However, given the relatively soft nature of the Callow Clay Fill, any heavily loaded floor slabs 
will either need to be suspended on to piles or the ground will require improvement before the 
slabs are cast. Potential ground improvement techniques could include preloading and 
surcharging of the Callow Clay Fill in order accelerate the settlements, or improvement of soft 
materials by in-situ ground improvement techniques, such as the installation of vibratory stone 
or concrete columns. It should be recognised; however, that surcharging is a process that 
requires a certain period of time for porewater pressures to dissipate and for primary 
settlements to take place and it may be necessary to install additional drainage such as 
vertical sand drains for this to take place during an acceptable timescale.

6.7 
Clay Volume Change Potential 
Due to the highly plastic nature of the Oxford Clay, and the Callow deposits derived from it, 
the soils are liable to shrink or swell in response to changes in moisture content. Such 
changes in moisture content can occur due to seasonal or climatic effects but more commonly 
structural damage can occur when trees and hedgerows remove moisture from the soil at 
depth. Conversely removal of trees can cause swelling and structural damage as the soils re-
saturate. 
Guidance on foundation design in such circumstances is given in BRE Digests 240, 241, 242, 
298 and 412, and also in NHBC Standards Chapter 4.2, which can be applied as equally as 
appropriate to industrial buildings as houses. The historical laboratory testing on the soils 
present indicates that the in-situ Callow deposits exhibit a high volume change potential whilst 
the Callow Clay Fill and the Knotts exhibit a generally moderate volume change potential. It is 
recommended that a high volume change potential is assumed for those fill deposits that will 
be placed into the base of the pit as part of the LLRS. Particular attention will need to be given 
to the design of any foundations within the tree root zone of influence of the extensive tree 
screen proposed as part of the landscaping of the proposed application site. 
NHBC Chapter 4.2 recommends that for foundations outside of the zone of influence of any 
proposed trees or shrubs a minimum foundation depth of 1.0m should be adopted for high 
volume change potential soils. For any foundations inside the potential zone of influence of 
any proposed trees or shrubs foundation depths of 1.5m are appropriate, providing that 
absolute limits are agreed within the planting schedules to exclude any tree planting a certain 
distance to the foundations. The reader is referred to the NHBC guidance for further details 
regarding the zone of influence identified for a variety of different tree species. 
6.8 
Chemical Attack on Buried Concrete 
It should be recognised that the Oxford Clay is known to be sulphate and pyrite bearing and 
can therefore be corrosive to buried concrete. Groundwater and surface water monitoring data 
has also indicated that the waters present at the proposed application site are characterised 
by high chloride and high sulphate concentrations. It is recommended that checks on site 
specific conditions should be made prior to construction and the mix design of buried concrete 
should follow the recommendations of BRE Special Digest 1: Concrete in Aggressive ground 
(2005). Generally a design sulphate class of DS4 is required in Oxford Clay terrain and 
subject to groundwater considerations an ACEC class of AC-4 is adopted for mobile 
groundwater conditions. 
6.9 
Slope Stability 
A number of both small scale and large scale instability features have been noted within the 
Callow and Knotts slopes of the strata in the side walls of the Rookery South pit. The length of 
side wall adjacent to the proposed location of the Generating Equipment Site is however 
formed at slacker angles with a bench of 30m width formed part-way down the slope. Here the 
original pit edges have been modified in the earlier stages of a former restoration programme 
that was not fully implemented. The gradient of the slopes on this face are formed at angles of 
approximately 1V:3H to 1V:2H . The overall profile is formed at approximately 1V:4.5H.  
The results of a survey of the slope condition on motorway earthworks (Perry, 1989) indicates 
that slopes greater than 2.5m high, constructed using material sourced from the Oxford Clay 
Formation, should have a gradient no steeper than 1V:3.5H to limit the risk of slope failure to 
less than 1 per cent within 20 years of construction. Where the slopes are formed at a gradient 
steeper than 1V:3.5H, weathering and progressive softening of the near-surface soils on the 
slope may result in shallow translational and flow movements through the soils near the base 
of the root system of the vegetation on the slope. For slopes at about 1V:2.5H, the risk of such 
failures occurring within about 10 years of construction was reported to be about 20%.

In the western parts of the Generating Equipment Site, the proposed slope gradient as a result 
of the LLRS earthworks will provide a resultant slope gradient equivalent to approximately 
1V:3.5H.  
6.10 Potential for Hydraulic Uplift 
When the piezometric pressure in a relatively permeable stratum exceeds the confining 
overburden pressure of the relatively impermeable strata overlying it, then there is a 
theoretical risk of heave or hydraulic uplift. However, the inherent strength and cohesion of the 
confining strata (rather than just its downward acting mass) can also contribute to the resisting 
downward forces acting against the uplift. Therefore with essentially impermeable deposits 
(remnant Oxford Clay and Callow Clay Fill) overlying slightly more permeable deposits 
(Kellaways Sand), and with relatively high piezometric levels recorded in boreholes around the 
perimeter of the proposed application site, there might be a risk that hydraulic uplift may occur 
in the pit base where the thickness of the overlying impermeable deposits has been reduced 
by excavation works and overburden pressures therefore reduced. It should be noted that 
hydraulic uplift has not occurred in this pit although the theoretical possibility remains. 
Previous groundwater monitoring undertaken at the proposed application site has shown that 
piezometric levels within the Kellaways Sand are at, or close to, the topographic levels 
currently present within the base of the pit. However, the permeability of the Kellaways Sand 
has been shown by historical investigations to be relatively low (2.4 x 10-6 m/s to 5.1 x 10-7 
m/s) and the potential for significant hydraulic pressure to build up is therefore considered to 
be very low. 
Calculations of the potential for basal heave have been undertaken using stratigraphical 
information collected during historical ground investigations undertaken at the proposed 
application site by CL Associates in 2000 (CLA, 2000) and maximum recorded piezometric 
levels based on hydrogeological information collected during groundwater monitoring 
undertaken by CLA between 2000 and 2002 and by PBA in June and September 2008. The 
factor of safety against the potential for heave to occur as a result of piezometric pressures 
within the Kellaways Sand, Cornbrash Formation and the Blisworth Limestone Formation, has 
been calculated by comparing the uplift pressure from each respective groundwater body, 
measured at boreholes located within the base of the pit, to the vertical overburden pressure 
applied by the overlying deposits based on the proposed basal formation levels at these 
locations. The results show that a factor of safety against basal heave of 1.5 or more is 
present and basal heave is therefore considered unlikely to occur.  
The proposed regrading works included as part of the LLRS will result in a platform at 
approximately 31m AOD – 31.8m AOD. These works will effectively require placement of up 
fill in places but removal of soil in other areas where ground levels are currently slightly higher 
than the proposed platform levels. In general, comparing the depth to the Kellaways Sand 
Formation, recorded during previous ground investigations, with the proposed development 
platform level indicates that the Kellaways Sand will be overlain by approximately 5m – 10m of 
very low permeability in-situ Oxford Clay and re-worked Callow Clay fill and basal heave is 
considered highly unlikely to occur. 
6.11 Surface Water Disposal 
The Oxford Clay and underlying Kellaways Sand are of a very low permeability and there is 
therefore no scope for the use of infiltration drainage within the proposed application site. As a 
result, the LLRS includes development of a surface water attenuation pond and associated 
pumping station in order to control the surface waters within the pits.  
It is understood that the drainage of the proposed application site will be via a series of 
surface water interceptor channels flowing under gravity to the surface water attenuation 
pond. Levels within the attenuation pond will be controlled by stage pumping any accumulated 
waters via an existing culvert into Mill Brook and ultimately Stewartby Lake.

Conclusions and Recommendations 
7.1 
Conclusions 
The Project Site spans several different parts of the Rookery South site, and includes a large 
Electrical Connection area that falls outside the clay pit adjacent to the south of the pit. The 
Generating Equipment Site of the site falls within the southwest corner of the Rookery South 
clay pit that provided clay to the nearby Stewartby brickworks. It is understood that clay 
extraction from this area ceased in 1986. The remaining parts of the Project Site lie to the 
south of the clay pit and comprise agricultural land that forms part of the Electrical Connection 
area. Evidence from historical maps suggests that this land has always been in agricultural 
use. 
From a review of the available desk based information it is likely that Callow Clay Fill in the 
form of reworked clay underlies the base of the clay pit in the Project Site. Indications are that 
this could be in excess of 4.5m deep in some parts although more typically around 2.5m thick. 
Chemical testing data is not available on this from within the actual site area, although records 
from samples taken elsewhere within the wider confines of Rookery South Pit indicate that the 
material is typical of reworked clay with rare inclusions of brick, and consequently this is not 
expected to represent a potential source of contamination.  
With regard to the Electrical Connection area, there are not expected to be any new receptors 
introduced, since the area will only be used to provide a below ground gas and above ground 
electricity Electrical Connection. Furthermore there are not expected to be any notable on-site 
or plausible off-site sources of contamination in this area, potential hazards associated with 
ground contamination have therefore not been identified in this part of the site, and hence the 
risk assessment for this area has not been taken forward.   
Whilst it is possible that the reworked Callow Clay Fill within the base of the clay pit may 
contain isolated, discrete and localised elevated concentrations of potential contaminants, this 
is considered unlikely on the basis of the testing carried out elsewhere on the site. 
Furthermore the low sensitivity of the proposed end-use in this area means that even if any 
localised contamination were present, it is unlikely that any pollutant linkages between the 
end-users and the ground will be active.  
Nevertheless, the presence of Callow Clay fill and the organic rich Oxford Clay Formation 
could represent a possible low level Carbon Dioxide ground gas source that could migrate to 
the ground surface via permeable pathways in the reworked ground, or via anthropogenic 
caused during construction. 
Potential pollutant linkages have been identified within the Generating Equipment Site of the 
site only. Using the information on potential sources (contaminant types), receptors and 
exposure pathways the estimated risks for the identified pollutant linkages have been 
assessed as Very Low in all cases (human health and controlled waters). The exception to 
this is risk associated with naturally occurring ground gas (carbon dioxide) within the 
underlying clay, further investigation will be required to assess this risk, and it should not be 
ruled out that some form of mitigation in the form of gas protection measures may be required. 
It is therefore considered that the site is unlikely to be designated as “contaminated land” 
under Part IIA. 
Possible pollutant linkages have been identified in the Generating Equipment Site and Access 
Road only, but these risks have been assessed to be Very Low. It is considered that the risks 
can be managed and reduced to an acceptable level through a combination of mitigation, 
remediation, design and adoption of good practice measures during construction.

7.2 
Geotechnical Conclusions 
It is recognised that the proposed LLRS will take place prior to commencement of the 
development. The LLRS will include regrading levels within the base of the pit by cut and 
placement of engineered fill, including the winning of lay fill from parts of the wider site area. 
The earthworks in the base of the pit will be undertaken by placing Oxford Clay Fill in layers to 
raise ground levels and produce a fall across the pit towards an attenuation pond in the 
northern part of the Rookery South pit. It is proposed that the resulting topographic levels 
beneath the Generating Equipment Site will be approximately 31.8m AOD – 31.2m AOD, 
which equates to a limited thickness of fill above current levels of circa 0.5m in places and cut 
of up to 1.2m. In the western parts of the Generating Equipment Site, the proposed slope 
gradient as a result of the LLRS earthworks will provide a resultant slope gradient equivalent 
to approximately 1V:3.5H to limit the risk of slope failure to less than 1 per cent within 20 years 
of construction. 
The ground conditions on the proposed application site are, in general, expected to form a 
suitable platform for the construction of proposed facility. For very lightly loaded elements of 
the proposed facility and elements that are able to tolerate differential movements, shallow 
spread footings constructed within the remaining Oxford Clay, and possibly in the overlying 
Callow Clay Fill and engineered development platform fill, could be an appropriate option.  
It should be recognised that the Oxford Clay is known to be sulphate and pyrite bearing and 
can therefore be corrosive to buried concrete. Generally a design sulphate class of DS4 is 
required in Oxford Clay terrain and subject to groundwater considerations an ACEC class of 
AC-4 is adopted for mobile groundwater conditions. 
7.3 
Recommendations 
It is recommended that a Geotechnical Ground Investigation is carried within the Generating 
Equipment Site to inform the foundation design of the proposed infrastructure within the 
Generating Equipment Site of the site. The ground investigation should primarily target the 
parts of the site that fall within the base of the clay pit to ascertain the nature and extent of the 
Callow Clay Fill present. 
Given the anticipated low level of contamination risk throughout the application area and its 
proposed end-use, it is anticipated that the requirement to carry out a bespoke Phase 2 
geoenvironmental intrusive investigation is not required. It is not expected that a ground 
investigation of any type will be required for the Electrical Connection area owing to the lack of 
feasible contamination hazards and receptors within this part of the site.  
It may however be prudent to obtain soil samples for geoenvironmental screening during the 
geotechnical ground investigation in the Generating Equipment Site, and to simultaneously 
install groundwater/gas monitoring standpipes during these works. This should be followed up 
by a robust groundwater/gas monitoring programme. It is expected that any requirement for 
contamination testing be satisfactorily dealt with by planning conditions incorporated in any 
granted Outline Planning Consent. 
It is nevertheless recommended that a programme of groundwater and surface water 
monitoring is carried out for the site to provide information on the current baseline conditions 
prior to construction at the site.

PBA Methodology for Assessing Land Contamination in England 
Revision December 2014 
Page 1 of 8 
 
 
1 
Introduction 
This document defines the approach adopted by PBA 
in relation to the assessment of land contamination in 
England.  The aim is for the approach to (i) be 
systematic and objective, (ii) provide for the 
assessment of uncertainty and (iii) provide a rational, 
consistent, transparent framework.  
 
When preparing our methodology we have made 
reference to various technical guidance documents and 
legislation referenced in Section 7 of which the 
principal documents are (i) Contaminated Land 
Statutory Guidance (Defra 2012), (ii) the Model 
Procedures for the Management of Contamination 
(CLR 11) (EA 2004), (iii) Contaminated land risk 
assessment: A guide to good practice (C552) (CIRIA 
2001) and (iv) National Planning Policy Framework 
(DCLG 2012). 
 
2 
Dealing with Land Contamination 
Government policy on land contamination aims to 
prevent new contaminated land from being created and 
promotes a risk based approach to addressing 
historical contamination.  With regard to historical 
contamination, regulatory intervention is held in reserve 
for land that meets the legal definition and cannot be 
dealt with through any other means, including through 
planning.  Land is only considered to be “contaminated 
land” in the legal sense if it poses an unacceptable risk.  
 
UK legislation on contaminated land is principally 
contained in Part 2A of the Environmental Protection 
Act, 1990 (which was inserted into the 1990 Act by 
section 57 of the Environment Act 1995). Part 2A was 
introduced in England on 1 April 2000 and provides a 
risk-based 
approach 
to 
the 
identification 
and 
remediation of land where contamination poses an 
unacceptable risk to human health or the environment. 
In 2004 the Model Procedures for the Management of 
Contamination (CLR 11) were published providing 
guidance on how the statutory requirements were to be 
delivery.  The approach, concepts and principles for 
land contamination management promoted by CLR 11 
are applied to the determination of planning 
applications. 
 
Other legislative regimes may also provide a means of 
dealing with land contamination issues, such as the 
regimes for waste, water, environmental permitting, and 
environmental damage. Further, the law of statutory 
nuisance 
may 
result 
in 
contaminants 
being 
unacceptable to third parties whilst not attracting action 
under Part 2A or other environmental legislation. 
 
2.1 
Part 2A 
The Regulations and Statutory Guidance that 
accompanied the Act, including the Contaminated Land 
(England) Regulations 2006, has been revised with the 
issue 
of 
The 
Contaminated 
Land 
(England) 
(Amendment) Regulations 2012 (SI 2012/263) and the 
Contaminated Land Statutory Guidance for England 
2012.  
 
Part 2A defines contaminated land as “land which 
appears to the Local Authority in whose area it is 
situated to be in such a condition that, by reason of 
substances in, on or under the land that significant 
harm is being caused, or there is a significant 
possibility that such harm could be caused, or pollution 
of controlled waters is being, or likely to be, caused”.   
 
Harm is defined as “harm to the health of living 
organisms or other interference with the ecological 
systems of which they form part, and in the case of 
man, includes harm to his property”.   
 
For the purposes of Part 2A, land is contaminated if it 
poses a significant possibility of significant harm 
(SPOSH).   
 
Part 2A provides a means of dealing with unacceptable 
risks posed by land contamination to human health and 
the environment, and under the guidance enforcing 
authorities should seek to find and deal with such land. 
It states that “under Part 2A the starting point should be 
that land is not contaminated land unless there is 
reason to consider otherwise. Only land where 
unacceptable risks are clearly identified, after a risk 
assessment has been undertaken in accordance with 
the Guidance, should be considered as meeting the 
Part 2A definition of contaminated land”. Further the 
guidance makes it clear that “regulatory decisions 
should be based on what is reasonably likely, not what 
is hypothetically possible”. 
 
The overarching objectives of the Government’s policy 
on contaminated land and the Part 2A regime are: 
 
“(a) 
To identify and remove unacceptable risks to  
 human health and the environment. 
(a) 
To seek to ensure that contaminated land is 
made suitable for its current use. 
(b) 
To ensure that the burdens faced by 
individuals, companies and society as a whole 
are 
proportionate, 
manageable 
and 
compatible with the principles of sustainable 
development”. 
 
The enforcing authority may need to decide whether 
and how to act in situations where decisions are not 
straight forward, and where there is uncertainty. “In so 
doing, the authority should use its judgement to strike a 
reasonable balance between: (a) dealing with risks 
raised by contaminants in land and the benefits of 
remediating land to remove or reduce those risks; and 
(b) the potential impacts of regulatory intervention 
including financial costs to whoever will pay for 
remediation, health and environmental impacts of 
taking action, property blight, and burdens on affected 
people”. The authority is required to “take a 
precautionary approach to the risks raised by 
contamination, whilst avoiding a disproportionate 
approach given the circumstances of each case”. The 
aim is “that the regime produces net benefits, taking 
account of local circumstances”. 
 
The guidance recognises that “normal levels of 
contaminants in soils should not be considered to 
cause land to qualify as contaminated land, unless 
there is a particular reason to consider otherwise”. 
 
Normal levels are quoted as: 
“a)   
natural presence of contaminants’ such as 
from underlying geology ‘that have not been 
shown to pose an unacceptable risk to health 
and the environment 
b)   
…low level diffuse pollution, and common 
human activity…” 
PBA Methodology for Assessment of Potentially Contaminated Land 
Revision December 2014 
Page 2 of 8 
 
 
Similarly the guidance states that significant pollution of 
controlled waters is required for land to be considered 
contaminated and the “fact that substances are merely 
entering water” or “where discharge from land is not 
discernible at a location immediately downstream” does 
not constitute contaminated land. 
 
To help achieve a more targeted approach to 
identifying and managing contaminated land in relation 
to the risk (or possibility) of harm to human health, the 
revised Statutory Guidance presented a new four 
category system for considering land under Part 2A, 
ranging from Category 4, where there is no risk that 
land poses a significant possibility of significant harm 
(SPOSH), or the level of risk is low, to Category 1, 
where the risk that land poses a significant possibility of 
significant harm (SPOSH) is unacceptably high.  
 
For land that cannot be readily placed into Categories 1 
or 4 further assessment is required.  If there is a 
sufficiently strong case that the risks are of sufficient 
concern to cause significant harm/pollution or have the 
significant possibility of significant harm/pollution the 
land is to be placed into Category 2.  If the concern is 
not met land is considered Category 3. 
 
The technical guidance clearly states that the currently 
published SGV and GAC’s represent “cautious 
estimates of level of contaminants in soils” which 
should be considered “no risk to health or, at most, a 
minimal risk”. These values do not represent the 
boundary between categories 3 and 4 and “should be 
considered to be comfortably within Category 4”. 
 
At the end of 2013 technical guidance in support of 
Defra’s revised Statutory Guidance (SG) was published 
(CL:AIRE 2013) which provided:  
• A methodology for deriving C4SLs for four generic 
land-uses 
comprising 
residential, 
commercial, 
allotments and public open space; and  
• A demonstration of the methodology, via the 
derivation of C4SLs for six substances – arsenic, 
benzene, benzo(a)pyrene, cadmium, chromium (VI) 
and lead.  
 
2.2 
Planning 
The Local Planning Authority (LPA) is responsible for 
the control of development, and in doing so it has a 
duty to take account of all material considerations, 
including contamination.   
Section 11, Paragraph 109 of the National Planning 
Policy Framework (NPPF) (DCLG 2012) states the 
planning system should contribute to and enhance the 
natural and local environment by “preventing both new 
and existing developments from contributing to or being 
put at unacceptable risk from, or being adversely 
affected by unacceptable levels of soil, air, water 
pollution” and “remediating and mitigating despoiled, 
degraded, derelict, contaminated and unstable land, 
where appropriate”.  Paragraphs 120 and 121 describe 
the policy considerations the Government expects LPA 
to have in regard to land affected by contamination 
when preparing policies for development plans and in 
taking decisions on applications. 
For planning purposes, the NPPF requires that the 
assessment of risks arising from contamination and 
remediation requirements should be considered on the 
basis of the current environmental setting, the current 
land use, and the circumstances of its proposed new 
use  The NPPF stipulates that planning policies and 
decisions should ensure that “the site is suitable for its 
new use taking account of ground conditions and land 
instability, including from natural hazards or former 
activities from previous uses and any proposals for 
mitigation including land remediation or impacts on the 
natural environment arising from that remediation”; and 
that “after remediation, as a minimum, land should not 
be capable of being determined as contaminated land 
under Part 2A of the Environmental Protection Act 
1990; and adequate site investigation information, 
prepared by a competent person, is presented.” 
 
The level at which contamination is deemed to be 
unacceptable, or, gives rise to adverse effects under a 
planning context has not been identified but is 
envisaged to be more precautionary than the level 
required to detrmine land as contaminated under Part 
2A. 
 
In paragraph 121 the developer is required to ensure 
that land, after development, is not capable of being 
determined as contaminated land under Part 2A of the 
EPA 1990.  
 
The principal planning objective is to ensure that any 
unacceptable risks to human health, buildings and 
other property and the natural and historical 
environment from the contaminated condition of the 
land are identified so that appropriate action can be 
considered and taken to address those risks.  In order 
to grant a planning permission the Local Planning 
Authority (LPA) has to be satisfied that there is 
sufficient information about the condition of the land, its 
impacts and the availability of viable remedial options. 
NPPF Paragraph 21 states that “planning policies and 
decisions should also ensure that adequate site 
investigation information, prepared by a competent 
person, is presented”. Site investigation information is 
further defined in the NPPF Glossary page 56 and that 
also states that investigations should be carried out in 
accordance with established procedures, including 
BS10175 (BSI 2011) that in turn links procedure to the 
requirements of CLR11. 
A key distinction between the Soil Guideline Values 
(SGVs) and the C4SLs is the level of risk that they 
describe. As described by the Environment Agency 
(2009a):  
“SGVs are guidelines on the level of long-term human 
exposure to individual chemicals in soil that, unless 
stated otherwise, are tolerable or pose a minimal risk to 
human health.” 
 
A letter from Lord de Mauley dated 3rd September 
2014 provides more explicit direction to local authorities 
on the use of the C4SL in a planning context. The letter 
identifies four key points:  
1) that the screening values were developed expressly 
with the planning regime in mind 
2) their use is recommended in DCLG’s planning 
guidance 
3) soil concentrations below a C4SL limit are 
considered to be ‘definitely not contaminated’ under 
Part llA of the 1990 Environmental Protection Act and 
pose at most a ‘low level of toxicological concern’ and 
4) exceedance of a C4SL screening value does not 
mean that land is definitely contaminated, just that 
further investigation may be warranted.

2.3 
Building Control 
The building control department of the local authority or 
private sector approved inspectors are responsible for 
the operation and enforcement of the Building 
Regulations (DCLG 2010) to protect the health, safety 
and welfare of people in and around buildings. 
Approved Document C requires the protection of 
buildings and associated land from the effects of 
contamination, to be applied (non-exclusively) in all 
changes of use from commercial or industrial premises, 
to residential property. 
3 
Approach 
CLR 11 recommends a phased or tiered approach to 
risk assessment with the three tiers being:- 
� 
Tier 1 - preliminary – a qualitative assessment 
forming part of a Phase 1 report,  
� 
Tier 2 - generic - a quantitative assessment using 
published criteria to screen site specific ground 
condition data forming part of a Phase 2 report 
� 
Tier 3 - detailed – a quantitative assessment 
involving 
the 
generation 
of 
site 
specific 
assessment criteria 
 
Each tier of risk assessment comprises the following 
four stages:- 
 
1. 
Hazard Identification – identifying potential 
contaminant sources on and off site; 
2. 
Hazard Assessment – assessing the potential for 
unacceptable risks by identifying what pathways 
and receptors could be present, and what pollutant 
linkages could result (forming the Conceptual Site 
Model (CSM)); 
3. 
Risk Estimation – estimating the magnitude and 
probability of the possible consequences (what 
degree of harm might result to a defined receptor 
and how likely); and 
4. 
Risk Evaluation – evaluating whether the risk 
needs to be, and can be, managed.   
 
A PBA Phase 1 report normally comprises a desk 
study, walkover and Tier 1 risk assessment (the project 
specific offer defines the actual scope of work). This is 
the minimum requirement as defined by the NPPF, 
pp56. At Tier 1 the PBA approach to risk estimation 
involves identifying the magnitude of the potential 
consequence (taking into account both the potential 
severity of the hazard and the sensitivity of the 
receptor) and the magnitude of the likelihood i.e. the 
probability (taking into account the presence of the 
hazard and the receptor and the integrity of the 
pathway).  This approach is promoted in current 
guidance such as R&D 66 (NHBC 2008). 
 
The PBA approach is that if a pollution linkage is 
identified then it represents a potential risk which 
requires 
further 
consideration 
and 
either 
(1) 
remediation / direct risk management or (2) further tiers 
of assessment.   
 
A PBA preliminary Phase 2 report comprises an 
intrusive 
investigation 
to 
collect 
site 
specific 
information, a Tier 2 quantitative generic risk 
assessment and a refinement of the CSM using the site 
specific data.  Depending on the findings further 
investigation and/or progression to Tier 3 risk 
assessment and the generation of site specific 
assessment criteria may be required. 
 
The PBA methodology provides an estimate of the level 
of risk, it does not identify a risk level at which the risk 
is considered “significant” and/or “unacceptable” as this 
is dependant on the view of the individual / stakeholder. 
For example; to a risk adverse stakeholder even a risk 
level of “very low” may be considered unacceptable 
and as such this stakeholder may require risk 
management options to be implemented. 
 
4 
Identification of Pollutant Linkages and 
Conceptual Site Model (CSM) 
For all Tiers the underlying principle to ground condition 
assessment is the identification of pollutant linkages in 
order to evaluate whether the presence of a source of 
contamination could potentially lead to harmful 
consequences.  A pollutant linkage consists of the 
following three elements:- 
 
• 
A source/hazard – a substance or situation which 
has the potential to cause harm or pollution; 
 
• 
A pathway – a means by which the hazard moves 
along / generates exposure; and 
 
• 
A receptor/target – an entity which is vulnerable to 
the potential adverse effects of the hazard. 
 
The Conceptual Site Model identifies the types and 
locations of potential contaminant sources/hazards and 
potential 
receptors 
and 
potential 
migration/transportation pathway(s).  The CSM is 
refined as the assessment progresses through the 
Tiers. 
 
4.1 
Hazard Identification  
 
A hazard is a substance or situation that has the 
potential to cause harm.  Hazards may be chemical, 
biological or physical (e.g. explosive gases).   
 
At Tier 1 the potential for hazards to be present is 
determined from consideration of the previous or 
ongoing activities on or near to the site in accordance 
with the criteria presented in the Table 1.  
 
Based on the land use information Potential 
Contaminants of Concern (PCOC) are identified.  The 
PCOC direct the scope of the collection of site specific 
data and the analytical testing selected for subsequent 
Tiers. 
 
At Tier 2 the site specific data is screened using 
published assessment criteria (refer to PBA document 
entitled Rationale for the Selection of Tier 2 
Assessment Criteria).  In general, published criteria 
have been developed using highly conservative 
assumptions and therefore if the screening criterion is 
not exceeded then the PCOC is eliminated as a 
potential Hazard.  It should be noted that exceedance 
does not necessarily indicate that a site is 
contaminated and/or unsuitable for use only that the 
PCOC is retained as a potential Hazard.  Published 
criteria are generated using models based on 
numerous and complex assumptions.  Whether or not 
these assumptions are appropriate in a site-specific 
context requires confirmation on a project by project 
basis and would form part of a Tier 3 assessment. 
 
When reviewing or assessing site specific data PBA

data with a critical concentration (CL:AIRE/CIEH 2008) 
which presents a structured process for employing 
statistical techniques for data assessment purposes.  
The benefit of the statistical tool is uncertainty is 
quantified and decisions are made knowing the 
strength of the evidence.  Correct decision probability is 
a function of sample size, difference in the mean and 
the critical concentration, variation in measured values 
and the significance level. 
 
4.2 
Receptor and Pathway Identification 
For all Tiers the potential receptors (for both on site and 
adjoining land) that will be considered are: 
• 
Human Health – including current and future 
occupiers, construction and future maintenance 
workers, and neighbouring properties/third parties;  
• 
Ecological systems; *1 
• 
Controlled waters *2 – including surface water and 
groundwater; 
• 
Property, Animal or Crop (existing or proposed) - 
including buildings, service lines and pipes, crops, 
livestock, pets, woodland; and 
• 
Archaeological sites and ancient monuments. 
 
*1 International or nationally designated sites (as defined in the 
statutory guidance (Defra Circular 04/12)) “in the local area” will 
be identified as potential ecological receptors.  A search radius 
of 1, 2 or 5km will be utilised depending on the site specific 
circumstances (see also pathway identification). The 
Environment Agency has published an ecological risk 
assessment framework (EA 2008) which promotes (as opposed 
to statutorily enforces) consideration of additional receptors to 
include locally protected sites and protected or notable species. 
These additional potential receptors will only be considered if a 
Phase 1 habitat survey, undertaken in accordance with 
guidance (JNCC 1993), is commissioned and the data provided 
to PBA.  It should be noted that without such a survey the Tier 
1 risk assessment may conclude that the identification of 
potential ecological receptors is inconclusive (refer to PBA 
Specification for Phase 1). 
 
*2 the definition of “pollution of controlled water” was amended 
by the introduction of Section 86 of the Water Act 2003.  For 
the purposes of Part 2A groundwater does not include waters 
above the saturated zone and our assessment does not 
therefore 
address perched water other than where 
development causes a pathway to develop. 
 
If a receptor is taken forward for further assessment it 
will be classified in terms of its sensitivity, the criteria 
for which are presented in Table 2.  Table 2 has been 
generated using descriptions of environmental receptor 
importance/value given in various guidance documents 
including R&D 66 (NHBC 2008) and Transport Analysis 
Guidance (based on DETR 2000). Human health and 
buildings classifications have been generated by PBA 
using the attribute description for each class. 
 
The exposure pathway and modes of transport that will 
be considered are presented in Table 3. 
 
4.3 
Note regarding Ecological Systems  
The Environment Agency (EA) has developed an 
ecological risk assessment framework which aims to 
provide a structured approach for assessing the risks to 
ecology from chemical contaminants in soils (EA 2008). 
In circumstances where contaminants in water 
represent a potential risk to aquatic ecosystems then 
risk assessors will need to consider this separately.  
 
The framework consists of a three tiered process:- 
 
• 
Tier 1 is a screening step where the site soils 
chemical data is compared to a soil screening 
value (SSV) 
• 
Tier 2 uses various tools (including surveys and 
biological testing) to gather evidence for any harm 
to the ecological receptors 
• 
Tier 3 seeks to attribute the harm to the chemical 
contamination 
 
Tier 1 is preceded by a desk study to collate 
information about the site and the nature of the 
contamination to assess whether pollutant linkages are 
feasible.  The framework presents ten steps for 
ecological desk studies and development of a 
conceptual site model as follows.   
 
1 Establish Regulatory Context 
2 Collate and Assess Documentary Information 
3 Summarise Documentary Information 
4 Identify Potential Contaminants of Concern 
5 Identify Likely Fate Transport of Contaminants 
6 Identify Potential Receptors of Concern 
7 Identify Potential Pathways of Concern 
8 Create a Conceptual Site Model 
9 Identify Assessment and Measurement Endpoints 
10 Identify Gaps and Uncertainties 
 
The information in a standard PBA Phase 1 report 
covers Steps 1 to 4 inclusive.  Step 5 considers fate 
and transport of contaminants and it should be noted 
that our standard report adopts a simplified approach 
considering only transport mechanisms.  A simplified 
approach has also been adopted in respect of Steps 6 
and 7 receptors (a detailed review of the ecological 
attributes has not been undertaken) and pathways (a 
food chain assessment has not been undertaken). 
Step 9 is outside the scope of our standard Phase 1 
report. 
 
It should be noted that the Tier 1 assessment for 
ecological systems (i.e. where designated sites are 
identified) as part of a Phase 1 report will assess the 
viability of the mode of transport given the site specific 
circumstances not specific pathways.   
 
The Tier 1 risk assessment may conclude that the risk 
to potential ecological receptors is inconclusive (see 
PBA Specification for Phase 1).

4.4 
Note regarding Controlled Waters 
Controlled Waters are rivers, estuaries, coastal 
waters, lakes and groundwaters, but not perched 
waters.   
The Water Framework Directive (WFD) (2000) aims 
to protect and enhance the quality of surface 
freshwater, groundwaters and dependent eco 
systems, estuaries and coastal waters. The WFD 
was transposed into UK law in 2003 (Statutory 
Instruments 2003). Member states must aim to reach 
good chemical and ecological status as defined in 
the Directive by 2015.     
The Ground Water Daughter Directive (GWDD) was 
enacted by the Groundwater Regulations (2009), 
which were subsumed by the Environmental 
Permitting Regulations (2010) which provide 
essential clarification including on the four objectives 
specifically for groundwater quality in the WFD:- 
• 
Achieve ‘Good’ groundwater chemical status 
by 2015, commonly referred to as ‘status 
objective’; 
• 
Achieve Drinking Water Protected Area 
Objectives; 
• 
Implement measures to reverse any 
significant and sustained upward trend in 
groundwater quality, referred to as ‘trend 
objective’; and 
• 
Prevent or limit the inputs of pollutants into 
groundwater, commonly referred to as ‘prevent 
or limit’ objectives 
The Water Act 2003 (Commencement No.11) Order 
2012 amends the test for 'contaminated land' which 
relates to water pollution so that pollution of 
controlled waters must now be "significant" to meet 
the definition of contaminated land. 
 
River Basin Management Plans (RBMP) have been 
developed for the 11 River Basin Districts in England 
and Wales.  These were released by Defra in 2009 
(Defra 2009). 
 
These RBMP’s establish the current status of waters 
within the catchments of the respective Districts and 
the current status of adjoining waters identified.  As part 
of a Tier 2 risk assessment water quality data is 
screened against the WFD assessment criteria. 
Compare to the RBMP’s current status of waters for the 
catchment under consideration would form part of a 
Tier 3 assessment.

Risk Estimation 
Risk estimation classifies what degree of harm might 
result to a receptor (defined as consequence) and how 
likely it is that such harm might arise (probability).   
At Tier 1 the consequence classification is generated 
by multiplying the hazard classification score and the 
receptor sensitivity score.  This approach follows that 
presented in the republished R&D 66 (NHBC 2008).   
 
The criteria for classifying probability are set out in 
Table 4 and have been taken directly from Table 6.4 
CIRIA C552 (CIRIA 2001).  Probability considers the 
integrity of the exposure pathway. 
 
The consequence classifications detailed in Table 5 
have been adapted from Table 6.3 presented in C552 
and R&D 66 (Annex 4 Table A4.3). 
 
The Tier 1 risk classification is estimated for each 
pollutant linkage using the matrix given in Table 6 
which is taken directly from C552 (Table 6.5). 
Subsequent Tiers refine the CSM through retention or 
elimination of potential hazards and pollutant linkages.   
6 
Risk Evaluation 
In order to put the Tier 1 risk classification into context 
the likely actions are described in Table 7 which is 
taken directly from C552 (Table 6.6). Subsequent Tiers 
identify potential risk management options through 
remediation and/or mitigation measures. 
 
Unless the initial assessment clearly demonstrates that 
the risk from contamination can be satisfactorily 
reduced 
to 
an 
acceptable 
level, 
further 
site 
investigations and risk assessment will be needed 
before the application can be determined.

Table 4: Classification of Probability 
Classification 
Definition 
High likelihood 
There is a pollution linkage and an event either appears very likely in the short-term and 
almost inevitable over the long-term, or there is already evidence at the receptor of harm / 
pollution. 
Likely 
There is a pollution linkage and all the elements are present and in the right place, which 
means that it is probable that an event will occur.  Circumstances are such that an event is 
not inevitable, but possible in the short-term and likely over the long-term. 
Low likelihood 
There is a pollution linkage and circumstances are possible under which an event could 
occur.  However, it is by no means certain that even over a longer period such event would 
take place, and is less likely in the shorter-term. 
Unlikely 
There is a pollution linkage but circumstances are such that it is improbable that an event 
would occur even in the very long-term.

Table 7: Description of Risks and Likely Action Required 
Risk Classification 
Description 
Very high risk 
There is a high probability that severe harm could arise to a designated receptor from an identified 
hazard, OR, there is evidence that severe harm to a designated receptor is currently happening.  
This risk, if realised, is likely to result in a substantial liability. Urgent investigation (if not undertaken 
already) and remediation is likely to be required in the short term. 
High risk 
Harm is likely to arise to a designated receptor from an identified hazard.  Realisation of the risk is 
likely to present a substantial liability. 
Urgent investigation (if not undertaken already) is required and remedial works may be necessary in 
the short-term and are likely over the longer-term. 
Moderate risk 
It is possible that harm could arise to a designated receptor from an identified hazard.  However, it is 
either relatively unlikely that any such harm would be severe, or if any harm were to occur it is more 
likely that the harm would be relatively mild. 
Investigation (if not already undertaken) is normally required to clarify the risk and to determine the 
potential liability.  Some remedial works may be required in the longer-term. 
Low risk 
It is possible that harm could arise to a designated receptor from an identified hazard, but it is likely 
that this harm, if realised, would at worst normally be mild. 
Very low risk 
There is a low possibility that harm could arise to a receptor.  In the event of such harm being 
realised it is not likely to be severe.

Introduction
Copyright Notice
 
 
The Environment Act 1995 has made site sensitivity a key issue, as the legislation pays as much attention to the pathways by which contamination could spread, and to the 
vulnerable targets of contamination, as it does the potential sources of contamination. 
For this reason, Landmark's Site Sensitivity maps and Datasheet(s) place great emphasis on statutory data provided by the Environment Agency and the Scottish 
Environment Protection Agency; it also incorporates data from Natural England (and the Scottish and Welsh equivalents) and Local Authorities; and highlights 
hydrogeological features required by environmental and geotechnical consultants. It does not include any information concerning past uses of land. The datasheet is 
produced by querying the Landmark database to a distance defined by the client from a site boundary provided by the client. 
In the attached datasheet the National Grid References (NGRs) are rounded to the nearest 10m in accordance with Landmark's agreements with a number of Data 
Suppliers.

Introduction
Copyright Notice

Peter Brett Associates Copyright Notice
Radon Potential dataset Copyright Notice
The Environment Act 1995 has made site sensitivity a key issue, as the legislation pays as much attention to the pathways by which 
contamination could spread, and to the vulnerable targets of contamination, as it does the potential sources of contamination. 
For this reason, Landmark's Site Sensitivity maps and Datasheet(s) place great emphasis on statutory data provided by the Environment 
Agency and the Scottish Environment Protection Agency; it also incorporates data from Natural England (and the Scottish and Welsh 
equivalents) and Local Authorities; and highlights hydrogeological features required by environmental and geotechnical consultants. It does not 
include any information concerning past uses of land. The datasheet is produced by querying the Landmark database to a distance defined by 
the client from a site boundary provided by the client. 
In the attached datasheet the National Grid References (NGRs) are rounded to the nearest 10m in accordance with Landmark's agreements 
with a number of Data Suppliers.
© Landmark Information Group Limited 2014. The Copyright on the information and data and its format as contained in this Envirocheck®

Published 1883 - 1884
Source map scale - 1:10,560
The historical maps shown were reproduced from maps predominantly held 
at the scale adopted for England, Wales and Scotland in the 1840`s. In 1854 
the 1:2,500 scale was adopted for mapping urban areas; these maps were 
used to update the 1:10,560 maps. The published date given therefore is 
often some years later than the surveyed date. Before 1938, all OS maps 
were based on the Cassini Projection, with independent surveys of a single 
county or group of counties, giving rise to significant inaccuracies in outlying 
areas. In the late 1940`s, a Provisional Edition was produced, which updated 
the 1:10,560 mapping from a number of sources. The maps appear 
unfinished - with all military camps and other strategic sites removed. These 
maps were initially overprinted with the National Grid. In 1970, the first 
1:10,000 maps were produced using the Transverse Mercator Projection. The
revision process continued until recently, with new editions appearing every 
10 years or so for urban areas.

at the scale adopted for England, Wales and Scotland in the 1840`s. In 1854 
the 1:2,500 scale was adopted for mapping urban areas; these maps were 
used to update the 1:10,560 maps. The published date given therefore is 
often some years later than the surveyed date. Before 1938, all OS maps 
were based on the Cassini Projection, with independent surveys of a single 
county or group of counties, giving rise to significant inaccuracies in outlying 
areas. In the late 1940`s, a Provisional Edition was produced, which updated 
the 1:10,560 mapping from a number of sources. The maps appear 
unfinished - with all military camps and other strategic sites removed. These 
maps were initially overprinted with the National Grid. In 1970, the first 
1:10,000 maps were produced using the Transverse Mercator Projection. The
revision process continued until recently, with new editions appearing every 
10 years or so for urban areas.

10k Raster Mapping
Published 2006
Source map scale - 1:10,000
The historical maps shown were produced from the Ordnance Survey`s 
1:10,000 colour raster mapping. These maps are derived from Landplan 
which replaced the old 1:10,000 maps originally published in 1970. The data 
is highly detailed showing buildings, fences and field boundaries as well as all
roads, tracks and paths. Road names are also included together with the 
relevant road number and classification. Boundary information depiction 
includes county, unitary authority, district, civil parish and constituency.

VectorMap Local
Published 2014
Source map scale - 1:10,000
VectorMap Local (Raster) is Ordnance Survey's highest detailed 'backdrop' 
mapping product. These maps are produced from OS's VectorMap Local, a 
simple vector dataset at a nominal scale of 1:10,000, covering the whole of 
Great Britain, that has been designed for creating graphical mapping. OS 
VectorMap Local is derived from large-scale information surveyed at 1:1250 
scale (covering major towns and cities),1:2500 scale (smaller towns, villages 
and developed rural areas), and 1:10 000 scale (mountain, moorland and 
river estuary areas).

Source map scale - 1:2,500
SUSI maps (Supply of Unpublished Survey Information) were produced 
between 1972 and 1977, mainly for internal use at Ordnance Survey. These 
were more of a `work-in-progress' plan as they showed updates of individual 
areas on a map. These maps were unpublished, and they do not represent a 
single moment in time. They were produced at both 1:2,500 and 1:1,250 
scales.

Large-Scale National Grid Data
Published 1993
Source map scale - 1:2,500
'Large Scale National Grid Data' superseded SIM cards (Ordnance Survey's 
'Survey of Information on Microfilm') in 1992, and continued to be produced 
until 1999. These maps were the fore-runners of digital mapping and so 
provide detailed information on houses and roads, but tend to show less 
topographic features such as vegetation. These maps were produced at both 
1:2,500 and 1:1,250 scales.

Published 1883
Source map scale - 1:2,500
The historical maps shown were reproduced from maps predominantly held 
at the scale adopted for England, Wales and Scotland in the 1840`s. In 1854 
the 1:2,500 scale was adopted for mapping urban areas and by 1896 it 
covered the whole of what were considered to be the cultivated parts of Great
Britain. The published date given below is often some years later than the 
surveyed date. Before 1938, all OS maps were based on the Cassini 
Projection, with independent surveys of a single county or group of counties, 
giving rise to significant inaccuracies in outlying areas.

SUSI maps (Supply of Unpublished Survey Information) were produced 
between 1972 and 1977, mainly for internal use at Ordnance Survey. These 
were more of a `work-in-progress' plan as they showed updates of individual 
areas on a map. These maps were unpublished, and they do not represent a 
single moment in time. They were produced at both 1:2,500 and 1:1,250

Published 1976
Source map scale - 1:2,500
SUSI maps (Supply of Unpublished Survey Information) were produced 
between 1972 and 1977, mainly for internal use at Ordnance Survey. These 
were more of a `work-in-progress' plan as they showed updates of individual 
areas on a map. These maps were unpublished, and they do not represent a 
single moment in time. They were produced at both 1:2,500 and 1:1,250 
scales.

'Large Scale National Grid Data' superseded SIM cards (Ordnance Survey's 
'Survey of Information on Microfilm') in 1992, and continued to be produced 
until 1999. These maps were the fore-runners of digital mapping and so 
provide detailed information on houses and roads, but tend to show less 
topographic features such as vegetation. These maps were produced at both 
1:2,500 and 1:1,250 scales.

Published 1976
Source map scale - 1:2,500
SUSI maps (Supply of Unpublished Survey Information) were produced 
between 1972 and 1977, mainly for internal use at Ordnance Survey. These 
were more of a `work-in-progress' plan as they showed updates of individual 
areas on a map. These maps were unpublished, and they do not represent a 
single moment in time. They were produced at both 1:2,500 and 1:1,250 
scales.

'Large Scale National Grid Data' superseded SIM cards (Ordnance Survey's 
'Survey of Information on Microfilm') in 1992, and continued to be produced 
until 1999. These maps were the fore-runners of digital mapping and so 
provide detailed information on houses and roads, but tend to show less 
topographic features such as vegetation. These maps were produced at both 
1:2,500 and 1:1,250 scales.

Bedfordshire
Published 1925
Source map scale - 1:2,500
The historical maps shown were reproduced from maps predominantly held 
at the scale adopted for England, Wales and Scotland in the 1840`s. In 1854 
the 1:2,500 scale was adopted for mapping urban areas and by 1896 it 
covered the whole of what were considered to be the cultivated parts of Great
Britain. The published date given below is often some years later than the 
surveyed date. Before 1938, all OS maps were based on the Cassini 
Projection, with independent surveys of a single county or group of counties, 
giving rise to significant inaccuracies in outlying areas.

Large-Scale National Grid Data
Published 1993
Source map scale - 1:2,500
'Large Scale National Grid Data' superseded SIM cards (Ordnance Survey's 
'Survey of Information on Microfilm') in 1992, and continued to be produced 
until 1999. These maps were the fore-runners of digital mapping and so 
provide detailed information on houses and roads, but tend to show less 
topographic features such as vegetation. These maps were produced at both 
1:2,500 and 1:1,250 scales.

Introduction
Copyright Notice
 
 
The Environment Act 1995 has made site sensitivity a key issue, as the legislation pays as much attention to the pathways by which contamination could spread, and to the 
vulnerable targets of contamination, as it does the potential sources of contamination. 
For this reason, Landmark's Site Sensitivity maps and Datasheet(s) place great emphasis on statutory data provided by the Environment Agency and the Scottish 
Environment Protection Agency; it also incorporates data from Natural England (and the Scottish and Welsh equivalents) and Local Authorities; and highlights 
hydrogeological features required by environmental and geotechnical consultants. It does not include any information concerning past uses of land. The datasheet is 
produced by querying the Landmark database to a distance defined by the client from a site boundary provided by the client. 
In the attached datasheet the National Grid References (NGRs) are rounded to the nearest 10m in accordance with Landmark's agreements with a number of Data 
Suppliers.

Soils of Low Leaching Potential - Soils in which pollutants are unlikely to 
penetrate the soil layer because water movement is largely horizontal or they 
have large ability to attenuate diffuse pollutants. Lateral flow from these soils 
contribute to groundwater recharge elsewhere in the catchment

Published 1884
Source map scale - 1:10,560
The historical maps shown were reproduced from maps predominantly held 
at the scale adopted for England, Wales and Scotland in the 1840`s. In 1854 
the 1:2,500 scale was adopted for mapping urban areas; these maps were 
used to update the 1:10,560 maps. The published date given therefore is 
often some years later than the surveyed date. Before 1938, all OS maps 
were based on the Cassini Projection, with independent surveys of a single 
county or group of counties, giving rise to significant inaccuracies in outlying 
areas. In the late 1940`s, a Provisional Edition was produced, which updated 
the 1:10,560 mapping from a number of sources. The maps appear 
unfinished - with all military camps and other strategic sites removed. These 
maps were initially overprinted with the National Grid. In 1970, the first 
1:10,000 maps were produced using the Transverse Mercator Projection. The
revision process continued until recently, with new editions appearing every 
10 years or so for urban areas.

Published 1901 - 1902
Source map scale - 1:10,560
The historical maps shown were reproduced from maps predominantly held 
at the scale adopted for England, Wales and Scotland in the 1840`s. In 1854 
the 1:2,500 scale was adopted for mapping urban areas; these maps were 
used to update the 1:10,560 maps. The published date given therefore is 
often some years later than the surveyed date. Before 1938, all OS maps 
were based on the Cassini Projection, with independent surveys of a single 
county or group of counties, giving rise to significant inaccuracies in outlying 
areas. In the late 1940`s, a Provisional Edition was produced, which updated 
the 1:10,560 mapping from a number of sources. The maps appear 
unfinished - with all military camps and other strategic sites removed. These 
maps were initially overprinted with the National Grid. In 1970, the first 
1:10,000 maps were produced using the Transverse Mercator Projection. The
revision process continued until recently, with new editions appearing every 
10 years or so for urban areas.

Source map scale - 1:2,500
The historical maps shown were reproduced from maps predominantly held 
at the scale adopted for England, Wales and Scotland in the 1840`s. In 1854 
the 1:2,500 scale was adopted for mapping urban areas and by 1896 it 
covered the whole of what were considered to be the cultivated parts of Great
Britain. The published date given below is often some years later than the 
surveyed date. Before 1938, all OS maps were based on the Cassini 
Projection, with independent surveys of a single county or group of counties, 
giving rise to significant inaccuracies in outlying areas.

SUSI maps (Supply of Unpublished Survey Information) were produced 
between 1972 and 1977, mainly for internal use at Ordnance Survey. These 
were more of a `work-in-progress' plan as they showed updates of individual 
areas on a map. These maps were unpublished, and they do not represent a 
single moment in time. They were produced at both 1:2,500 and 1:1,250 
scales.

'Large Scale National Grid Data' superseded SIM cards (Ordnance Survey's 
'Survey of Information on Microfilm') in 1992, and continued to be produced 
until 1999. These maps were the fore-runners of digital mapping and so 
provide detailed information on houses and roads, but tend to show less 
topographic features such as vegetation. These maps were produced at both 
1:2,500 and 1:1,250 scales.

Published 1925
Source map scale - 1:2,500
The historical maps shown were reproduced from maps predominantly held 
at the scale adopted for England, Wales and Scotland in the 1840`s. In 1854 
the 1:2,500 scale was adopted for mapping urban areas and by 1896 it 
covered the whole of what were considered to be the cultivated parts of Great
Britain. The published date given below is often some years later than the 
surveyed date. Before 1938, all OS maps were based on the Cassini 
Projection, with independent surveys of a single county or group of counties, 
giving rise to significant inaccuracies in outlying areas.

Large-Scale National Grid Data
Published 1993
Source map scale - 1:2,500
'Large Scale National Grid Data' superseded SIM cards (Ordnance Survey's 
'Survey of Information on Microfilm') in 1992, and continued to be produced 
until 1999. These maps were the fore-runners of digital mapping and so 
provide detailed information on houses and roads, but tend to show less 
topographic features such as vegetation. These maps were produced at both 
1:2,500 and 1:1,250 scales.

Introduction
Copyright Notice
 
 
The Environment Act 1995 has made site sensitivity a key issue, as the legislation pays as much attention to the pathways by which contamination could spread, and to the 
vulnerable targets of contamination, as it does the potential sources of contamination. 
For this reason, Landmark's Site Sensitivity maps and Datasheet(s) place great emphasis on statutory data provided by the Environment Agency and the Scottish 
Environment Protection Agency; it also incorporates data from Natural England (and the Scottish and Welsh equivalents) and Local Authorities; and highlights 
hydrogeological features required by environmental and geotechnical consultants. It does not include any information concerning past uses of land. The datasheet is 
produced by querying the Landmark database to a distance defined by the client from a site boundary provided by the client. 
In the attached datasheet the National Grid References (NGRs) are rounded to the nearest 10m in accordance with Landmark's agreements with a number of Data 
Suppliers.

Published 1883 - 1884
Source map scale - 1:10,560
The historical maps shown were reproduced from maps predominantly held 
at the scale adopted for England, Wales and Scotland in the 1840`s. In 1854 
the 1:2,500 scale was adopted for mapping urban areas; these maps were 
used to update the 1:10,560 maps. The published date given therefore is 
often some years later than the surveyed date. Before 1938, all OS maps 
were based on the Cassini Projection, with independent surveys of a single 
county or group of counties, giving rise to significant inaccuracies in outlying 
areas. In the late 1940`s, a Provisional Edition was produced, which updated 
the 1:10,560 mapping from a number of sources. The maps appear 
unfinished - with all military camps and other strategic sites removed. These 
maps were initially overprinted with the National Grid. In 1970, the first 
1:10,000 maps were produced using the Transverse Mercator Projection. The
revision process continued until recently, with new editions appearing every 
10 years or so for urban areas.

Source map scale - 1:2,500
The historical maps shown were reproduced from maps predominantly held 
at the scale adopted for England, Wales and Scotland in the 1840`s. In 1854 
the 1:2,500 scale was adopted for mapping urban areas and by 1896 it 
covered the whole of what were considered to be the cultivated parts of Great
Britain. The published date given below is often some years later than the 
surveyed date. Before 1938, all OS maps were based on the Cassini 
Projection, with independent surveys of a single county or group of counties, 
giving rise to significant inaccuracies in outlying areas.

Published 1993
Source map scale - 1:2,500
'Large Scale National Grid Data' superseded SIM cards (Ordnance Survey's 
'Survey of Information on Microfilm') in 1992, and continued to be produced 
until 1999. These maps were the fore-runners of digital mapping and so 
provide detailed information on houses and roads, but tend to show less 
topographic features such as vegetation. These maps were produced at both 
1:2,500 and 1:1,250 scales.

Source map scale - 1:2,500
The historical maps shown were reproduced from maps predominantly held 
at the scale adopted for England, Wales and Scotland in the 1840`s. In 1854 
the 1:2,500 scale was adopted for mapping urban areas and by 1896 it 
covered the whole of what were considered to be the cultivated parts of Great
Britain. The published date given below is often some years later than the 
surveyed date. Before 1938, all OS maps were based on the Cassini 
Projection, with independent surveys of a single county or group of counties, 
giving rise to significant inaccuracies in outlying areas.

Published 1988
Source map scale - 1:2,500
The SIM cards (Ordnance Survey's `Survey of Information on Microfilm') are 
further, minor editions of mapping which were produced and published in 
between the main editions as an area was updated. They date from 1947 to 
1994, and contain detailed information on buildings, roads and land-use. 
These maps were produced at both 1:2,500 and 1:1,250 scales.

'Large Scale National Grid Data' superseded SIM cards (Ordnance Survey's 
'Survey of Information on Microfilm') in 1992, and continued to be produced 
until 1999. These maps were the fore-runners of digital mapping and so 
provide detailed information on houses and roads, but tend to show less

1:2,500 and 1:1,250 scales.

Client Details
For ease of identification, your site and buffer have been split into Slices, 
Segments and Quadrants.  These are illustrated on the Index Map opposite 
and explained further below.
Each slice represents a 1:10,000 plot area (2.7km x 2.7km) for your site and 
buffer.  A large site and buffer may be made up of several slices (represented
by a red outline), that are referenced by letters of the alphabet, starting from 
the bottom left corner of the slice "grid". This grid does not relate to National 
Grid lines but is designed to give best fit over the site and buffer.
A segment represents a 1:2,500 plot area.  Segments that have plot files 
associated with them are shown in dark green, others in light blue.  These are
numbered from the bottom left hand corner within each slice.
A quadrant is a quarter of a segment.  These are labelled as NW, NE, SW, 
SE and are referenced in the datasheet to allow features to be quickly located
on plots.  Therefore a feature that has a quadrant reference of A7NW will be 
in Slice A, Segment 7 and the NW Quadrant.

Disposal
From the issue date of this test certificate, samples will be held for the following times prior to disposal :-
Soils - 1 month, Liquids - 2 weeks, Asbestos (test portion) - 6 months
Key: G-Glass P-Plastic B-Bottle�
DETS cannot be held responsible for the integrity of samples received whereby the laboratory did not undertake the sampling. In this instance samples received may 
be deviating. Deviating Sample criteria are based on British and International standards and laboratory trials in conjunction with the UKAS note 'Guidance on 
Deviating Samples'. All samples received are listed above. However, those samples that have additional comments in relation to hold time and/or inappropriate 
containers are deviating due to the reasons stated. This means that the analysis is accredited where applicable, but results may be compromised due to sample 
deviations. If no sampled date (soils) or date+time (waters) has been supplied then samples are deviating. However, if you are able to supply a sampled date (and 
time for waters) this will prevent samples being reported as deviating where specific hold times are not exceeded and where the container supplied is suitable.

Page 1 of 16 
Revision 12 December 2014 
1 Introduction 
A Tier 2 Risk Assessment is a quantitative 
assessment using published (generic) criteria to 
“screen” the site-specific contamination testing 
data and identify potential hazards to specific 
receptors.   
The aim of this document is to present an 
explanation for the selection of the assessment 
criteria routinely used by PBA when undertaking a 
Tier 2 risk assessment.  This document is divided 
into general introductory text and sections on soils, 
waters and soil gases.  This document should be 
read in conjunction with another entitled “PBA 
Methodology 
for 
Assessment 
of 
Land 
Contamination” which summarises the legislative 
regime and our approach to ground contamination 
and risk assessment. 
2 General Notes 
Any deviation from the routine criteria and/or 
selection of criteria for parameters not covered in 
this document will be described in the report text.  
The 
report 
will 
also 
comment 
on 
the 
appropriateness of the routine criteria for project 
objectives or ground conditions. 
Any PBA interpretation of contamination test 
results is based on a scientific and engineering 
appraisal.  The perceptions of, for example, 
banks, insurers, lay people etc are not taken into 
account. 
Any tables included in this document are 
produced for ease of reference to the criteria, 
they do not in any way replace the documents 
of origin (which are fully referenced) and 
which should be read to ensure appropriate 
use and interpretation of the data.  
SGV/GAC provide an aid to decision-making, but 
they do not replace the need for sound 
professional judgement in risk assessment (EA, 
2006b). 
3 Criteria for Assessing Soil 
Results 
3.1 Potential Harm to Human Health  
Defra has yet to produce a comprehensive list of 
assessment criteria that on its own, would be 
sufficient to enable the assessment of the 
potential risks posed by soil contaminants (to 
human health).  A number of industry-driven 
initiatives 
have 
developed 
to 
generate 
contaminated land assessment criteria.  This has 
led to the publication of a series of non-statutory 
non-Governmental contaminated land assessment 
criteria.  It should be noted that the published 
DEFRA guidance is also non-statutory. 
The criteria routinely used by PBA as Tier 2 soil 
screening values for the protection of human 
health are the Governmental Soil Guidance 
Values (SGVs) and various non-Governmental 
Generic Assessment Criteria (GAC),  these 
criteria are presented in Table 1. 
Both the Governmental and non Governmental 
sets of criteria have been generated using the 
Contaminated Land Exposure Assessment model 
(CLEA) and supporting technical guidance (EA, 
2009a, 2009b, 2009c). 
PBA has reviewed these publications and consider 
that 
the 
non-Governmental 
criteria 
are 
authoritative and robust, and therefore we will 
refer to such criteria until such time that DEFRA 
derive and publish Governmental SGVs to replace 
the non Governmental GACs. 
It is important to note that because the GACs are 
not published by the UK Government, they may be 
subject to challenge by a regulatory body or their 
representative.  If the use of the GACs is 
challenged, it may be necessary to carry out 
modelling to generate site-specific assessment 
criteria. 
Soil Guideline Values (SGVs) - Governmental 
The first series of SGVs were generated using a 
probabilistic version of the CLEA model.  
However, on 22 July 2008 DEFRA announced the 
withdrawal of these SGVs and revised SGVs have 
been calculated using a fully deterministic version 
of the CLEA model.  
The CLEA model has been developed to calculate 
a tolerable daily soil intake (TDSI) using a set of 
ten exposure pathways (Ingestion (outdoor soil, 
indoor dust, homegrown vegetables and soil 
attached to homegrown vegetables), Dernmal 
Contact (outdoor soil and indoor dust) and 
Inhalation (outdoor dust, indoor dust, outdoor 
vapours and indoor vapours)).  There are 
exposure pathways not included in the CLEA 
model such as the permeation of organics into 
plastic water supply pipes. 
The presence and/or significance of each of the 
potential exposure pathways is dependant on the 
land use being considered.  The model uses 
standard land use scenarios as follows:- 
Residential – habitation of a dwelling up to two 
storeys high with various default material and 
design parameters, access to either private or 
nearby community open space with soil track back 
to form indoor dust.  Assumes ingestion of 
homegrown produce. 
Allotments – the model has default parameters 
for use and consumption of vegetables but not 
animals or their products (eggs). 
Industrial/commercial – assumes office or light 
physical work in a permanent three storey 
structure with breaks taken outside and that the 
site is NOT covered in hardstanding

Rationale for Selection of Criteria for Tier 2 (Generic) Land Contamination Assessment

Governmental 
SGVs generated for organic compounds are 
dependent on the amount of organic matter 
present in the soil as organic matter acts to 
immobilise organic contaminants.  The SGVs for 
BTEX compounds and phenol assume that the 
‘host’ soil has 6% organic matter.  UK soils often 
have organic matter concentrations below 6% and 
that it may therefore not be conservative to use 
the published SGVs when assessing the potential 
risks from these chemicals.  The on-line 
Contaminated Land Strategies Digest (CLSD) 
formed a consortium of ten practitioners (including 
representatives from local authorities), to prepare 
generic assessment criteria for a number of 
contaminants at more conservative organic matter 
contents of 1% and 3% for the same end uses.  
The consortium also reproduced the SGVs using 
the EA’s latest CLEA model and latest CLEA 
guidance and PBA independently verified the 
results published using CLEA v1.06.  These 
criteria will be used by PBA where appropriate.  
In addition the CLSD consortium derived GACs for 
selected substances for an additional end use, 
that being residential without plant uptake (CLSD, 
2009). 
In July 2009, GAC for 82 substances were 
published 
by 
the 
Chartered 
Institute 
of 
Environmental Health (CIEH) (LQM and CIEH, 
2009) using the then current version of the CLEA 
software v1.04.  These GAC replace those 
generated in 2006 using the original version of the 
model CLEA UK beta.  
In January 2010, GAC for 35 substances were 
published by the Environmental Industries 
Commission (EIC), Association of Geotechnical 
and Geoenvironmental Specialists (AGS) and 
Contaminated 
Land: 
Applications 
in 
Real 
Environments (CL:AIRE), (CL:AIRE, 2010) using 
the then current version of the CLEA software 
v1.05.  These substances are more rarely found to 
be contaminants of concern during contaminated 
land investigations and hence are not routinely 
tested for. The CL:AIRE GAC are not reproduced 
in Table 1 but may be utilised as required.  
Note on Appropriate Use of SGV/GAC The 
SGVs and GACs generated using the CLEA 
model are based on numerous and complex 
assumptions.  The appropriateness of these 
assumptions in a site-specific context requires 
confirmation on a project by project basis. 
In general, SGVs/GACs have been developed 
using highly conservative assumptions and 
exceedance does not indicate that a site is 
statutorily 
contaminated 
and/or 
necessarily 
unsuitable for use in the planning context.  Current 
guidance (Defra 2012) provides new clarity on the 
assessment of risk where soil concentrations 
exceed the SGV.  The guidance introduces a four 
stage classification system where Category 1 sites 
are obviously contaminated and Category 4 sites 
uncontaminated as defined by EPA 1990. Outside 
of 
these 
categories 
further 
specific 
risk 
assessment is required to determine if the site 
should fall into Category 2 contaminated or 
category 3 uncontaminated.  Category 4 screening 
values are considered to be more pragmatic than 
the current published SGV/GAC criteria but still 
strongly precautionary with the aim of allowing 
rapid identification of sites where the risk is above 
minimal but still low/acceptable (within the context 
of Part 2A).  
At the end of 2013 technical guidance in support 
of Defra’s revised Statutory Guidance (SG) was 
published (CL:AIRE 2013) which provided:  
• A methodology for deriving C4SLs for four 
generic 
land-uses 
comprising 
residential, 
commercial, allotments and public open space 
(POS); and  
• A demonstration of the methodology, via the 
derivation of C4SLs for six substances – arsenic, 
benzene, benzo(a)pyrene, cadmium, chromium 
(VI) and lead.  
 
The C4SL tables for each of the six substances 
are reproduced as Tables 6 to 11 in this 
document.  For all tables HCV refers to Health 
Criteria 
Value 
and 
LLTC 
Low 
Level 
of 
Toxicological Concern. 
A letter from Lord de Mauley dated 3rd September 
2014 provides more explicit direction to local 
authorities on the use of the C4SL in a planning 
context. The letter identifies four key points:  
1) that the screening values were developed 
expressly with the planning regime in mind 
2) their use is recommended in DCLG’s planning 
guidance 
3) soil concentrations below a C4SL limit are 
considered to be ‘definitely not contaminated’ 
under Part llA of the 1990 Environmental 
Protection Act and pose at most a ‘low level of 
toxicological concern’ and 
4) exceedance of a C4SL screening value does 
not mean that land is definitely contaminated, just 
that further investigation may be warranted.  
 
PBA will use the criteria for lead and may use the 
other criterion, depending on site specific 
conditions. 
Note on Mercury, Chromium and Arsenic 
Assessment The analytical testing routinely 
undertaken 
by 
PBA 
determines 
total 
concentration, however, the toxicity depends on 
the form of the contaminant (species).     
If a source of Mercury, Chromium or Arsenic is 
identified or the total concentration exceeds the 
relevant worst case speciated criteria it will be 
Rationale for Selection of Criteria for Tier 2 (Generic) Land Contamination Assessment  
Page 3 of 16 
Revision 12 Issued December 2014 
 
desirable/necessary to undertake additional 
speciated testing and further assessment. 
Note on Lead The published SGV for lead was 
withdrawn and not replaced.  The lowest C4SL for 
each end use scenario will be used. 
Note on Asbestos  
Asbestos in soil and made ground is currently 
under review by a number of bodies. There are no 
current published guidance values for asbestos in 
soil other than the waste classification values 
given in the EA’s Technical Guidance WM2, 
Hazardous Waste – Interpretation of the definition 
and classification of hazard waste (3d Edition, 
2013). This guidance is only appropriate for soils 
that are being discarded as waste. 
Testing for asbestos will be carried out on 
selected samples of made ground encountered 
during investigation, initially samples will be 
subjected to an asbestos screen and, if asbestos 
is found to be present, subjected to quantification. 
The reader is directed to the report text for 
guidance on the approach adopted in respect to 
any asbestos found to be present. Further 
guidance is also available in the 2014 CIRIA 
publication C733, Asbestos in soil and made 
ground: a guide to understanding and managing 
risks.. 
3.2 Potential Harm to the Built Environment  
Land contamination can pose risks to buildings, 
building materials and services (BBM&S) in a 
number of ways. Volatile contaminants and gases 
can accumulate and cause explosion or fire. 
Foundations and buried services can be damaged 
by corrosive substances and contaminants such 
as steel slags can create unstable ground 
conditions through expansion causing structural 
damage.  PBA use the following primary guidance 
to assess the significance of soil chemistry with 
respect to its potential to harm the built 
environment. 
i)

Resistance to Contaminants and Moisture. 
(DCLG 2010);  
ii) Concrete in aggressive ground SD1 (BRE 
2005);  
iii) Guidance for the selection of water supply 
pipes to be used in brownfield sites (UKWIR 
2011); 
iv) Protocols published by agreement between 
Water UK and the Home Builders Federation 
providing supplementary guidance which 
includes the Risk Assessment for Water 
Pipes (the ‘RA’) (Water UK 2014). 
v) Performance

Materials 
in 
Contaminated Land report BR255 (BRE 
1994). 
vi) Risks of Contaminated Land to Buildings, 
Building Materials and Services. A Literature 
Review - Technical Report P331 (EA 2000). 
vii) Guidance on assessing and managing risks to 
buildings from land contamination - Technical 
Report P5 035/TR/01 (EA 2001). 
3.3 Potential to Harm Ecosystems, Animals, 
Crops etc  
The criteria routinely used by PBA as Tier 2 
screening values to assess the potential of soil 
chemistry to harm ecosystems are taken from the 
following guidance and summarised in are given in 
Table 2. 
i) 
Ecological Risk Assessment (ERA) Science 
Report Series SC070009, published by the 
Environment Agency, Bristol (EA, 2008); 
ii) The Restoration and Aftercare of Metalliferous 
Mining Sites for Pasture and Grazing (ICRCL 
70/90, 1990); and 
iii) Code of Practice for Agricultural Use of 
Sewage Sludge 2nd Edition (DOE, 2006). 
iv) BS 3882:2007 Specification for topsoil and 
requirements for use.  Unless stated in the 
report the assessment is solely for phytotoxic 
parameters and additional assessment is 
required to determine suitability as a growing 
medium. 
4 Criteria for Assessing Liquid 
Results 
4.1 Potential Harm to Human Health  
The criteria routinely used by PBA as Tier 2 water 
screening values (Table 3) are taken from the 
Water Supply (Water Quality) Regulations (Defra 
2010).  It should be noted that some of the 
prescribed concentrations listed in the Water 
Supply Regulations have been set for reasons 
other than their potential to cause harm to human 
health.  The concentrations of iron and 
manganese are controlled because they may taint 
potable water with an undesirable taste, odour or 
colour or may potentially deposit precipitates in 
water supply pipes. 
4.2 Potential to Harm Controlled Waters  
Controlled Waters are rivers, estuaries, coastal 
waters, lakes and groundwaters.  .  Water in the 
unsaturated zone is not groundwater but does 
come within the scope of the term “ground waters” 
as used and defined in the Water Resources Act 
1991. It will continue to be a technical decision for 
the Environment Agency to determine what is 
groundwater in certain circumstances for the 
purposes of the Regulations.  The approach 
adopted by PBA considers the objectives of the 
Water Framework Diredctive (WFD) and the 
Groundwater Daughter Directive (GWDD) (refer to 
PBA Methodology). 
Rationale for Selection of Criteria for Tier 2 (Generic) Land Contamination Assessment  
Page 4 of 16 
Revision 12 Issued December 2014 
 
When assessing ground condition data the aim is 
to 
identify 
whether 
there 
could 
be 
an 
environmentally significant input to groundwater.  
An 
environmentally 
insignificant 
input 
into 
groundwater would be one that could not have any 
effect on (i) any of the receptors noted in the 
Water Framework/GWDD definition of pollution (ii) 
the chemical status of a groundwater body; or (iii) 
could give rise to a significant and sustained rising 
trend in the concentrations of pollutants in 
groundwater as noted in those directives.  PBA 
uses the approach presented in Groundwater 
Protection Policy and Practice (GP3) (EA 2013).  
The criteria routinely used by PBA as Tier 2 
screening values (Tables 3, 4 and 5) are taken 
from directions to the Environment Agency (EA 
2010).  Reference is also made to Directive 
2013/39/EU 
(12 
August 
2013) 
amending 
Directives 2000/60/EC and 2008/105/EC as 
regards priority substances in the field of water 
policy.  While the Directive has yet to be 
transposed, it is intended that the standards it sets 
will apply for the purposes of the second cycle of 
river basin plans.   
The 
2014 
Water 
Framework 
Directive 
implementation in England and Wales: new and 
updated 
standards 
to 
protect 
the 
water 
environment - Directions to the Environment 
Agency relating to the Groundwater Directive 
(Directive 2006/118/EC)  informs interested 
parties of the  new and updated environmental 
standards to be used in the second cycle of Water 
Framework Directive (2000/60/EC) river basin 
management planning process in England and 
Wales. It also presents new and updated 
assessment criteria for biological elements that 
must be monitored to assess the ecological status 
of surface water bodies. This document does not 
cover any standards and biological assessment 
criteria that are unchanged for second cycle. The 
document should be read alongside the draft 
updated Ministerial Guidance to the Environment 
Agency and Natural Resources Wales on River 
Basin Management Planning which refers to the 
standards in Chapter 9. The relevant Directions to 
the Environment Agency and Natural Resources 
Wales (referred to hereafter as the Agencies) will 
be updated to give legal effect to the standards 
(currently not updated). 
 
 
5 Criteria for Assessing Gas 
Results 
PBA use the following primary guidance on gas 
monitoring methods and strategy, the assessment 
of risk posed by soil gases (including Volatile 
Organic Compounds (VOCs)) and mitigation 
measures/risk reduction during site development. 
i) 
BS 8576:2013 – Guidance on Ground Gas 
Investigations: Permanent gases and Volatile 
Organic Compounds (VOCs). (BSI 2013) 
ii) A pragmatic approach to Ground Gas Risk 
Assessment. CL:AIRE Research Bulletin 
RB17 (Card 2012) 
iii) The VOCs Handbook. C682 (CIRIA 2009). 
iv) Assessing risks posed by hazardous gases to 
buildings C665 (CIRIA 2007); 
v) Guidance on evaluation of development 
proposals on sites where methane and carbon 
dioxide are present. (NHBC 2007); and 
vi) Code of practice for the characterization and 
remediation from ground gas in affected 
developments BS 8485 (BSI 2007)  
Gas and borehole flow data are used to obtain the 
gas screening value (GSV) for methane and 
carbon dioxide. The GSV is used to establish the 
characteristic 
situation 
and 
to 
make 
recommendations for gas protection measures for 
buildings if required. 
Radon  
PBA use the following primary guidance to assess 
the significance of the radon content of soil gas. 
i) 
Radon: guidance on protective measures for 
new dwellings. Report BR211 (BRE, 2007); 
and 
ii) Radon Atlas of England, R290 (NRPB, 1996).

1. 
Former SGVs for lead were derived using empirically based methods, as opposed to CLEA 
2. 
Exposure parameters as described in Section 3.5.7 of main report. 
3. 
Estimated intake that would lead to geomean blood lead concentration in 0 to 7 year old child using IEUBK. 
4. 
Estimated intake that would lead to geomean blood lead concentration in adult using ALM. 
5. 
Estimated intake that would lead to geomean blood lead concentration in adult using Carlisle & Wade. 
6. 
The LLTC of 5 ug.dL-1 is based on CDC's target blood lead concentration in children for all exposure to lead and therefore 
thus LLTC has been treated as a "threshold". Consequently, mean daily intake from non soil sources has been included in 
the CLEA model inputs for derivation of this C4SL.

Risk estimation establishes the magnitude and probability of the possible consequences (what degree of harm might result and how likely). 
The criteria for classifying probability and consequence are set out in Tables 3 and 4 of the PBA methodology.
