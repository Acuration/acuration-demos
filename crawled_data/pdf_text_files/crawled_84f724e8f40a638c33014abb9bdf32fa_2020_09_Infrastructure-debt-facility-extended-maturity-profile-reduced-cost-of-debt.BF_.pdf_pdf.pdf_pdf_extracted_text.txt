Infrastructure debt facility – extended maturity profile, reduced cost of debt 
 
Drax Group plc (“Drax” and, together with its subsidiaries, the “Group”), the ultimate parent of 
Drax Finco plc) is pleased to announce that it has agreed a new infrastructure term loan facilities 
agreement (the “Agreement”) that provides committed facilities of approximately £160 million 
with a range of maturities between 2024 and 2030(1), further extending Drax’s debt maturity 
profile. 
 
The facilities have an average margin of 2.07%(2). Taken together with Drax’s existing borrowing, 
including a carbon-linked ESG(3) facility which was recently extended to 2025, this Agreement 
further reduces the Group’s all-in cost of debt below 4%. 
 
The Agreement also includes an option for Drax to obtain up to a further £75 million of facilities, if 
agreed between Drax and its lenders. If utilised, these additional facilities could have a maturity 
of up to 2030. 
 
The facilities under this Agreement also have a delayed draw(4) and proceeds are expected to be 
used in the ordinary course of business.
