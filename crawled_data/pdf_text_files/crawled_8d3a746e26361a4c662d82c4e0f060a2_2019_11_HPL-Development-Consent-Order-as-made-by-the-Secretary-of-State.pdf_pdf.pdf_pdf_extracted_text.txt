the land referred to in paragraph (1) of article 16 (compulsory acquisition of land) and paragraph 
(1) of article 20 (compulsory acquisition of rights etc.) as may be required for any purpose for 
which that land may be acquired under that provision instead of acquiring the whole of the land. 
(2) Where the undertaker acquires any part of, or rights in, the subsoil of land under paragraph 
(1), the undertaker is to not be required to acquire an interest in any other part of the land. 
(3) Paragraph (2) does not prevent article 24 (acquisition of part of certain properties) from 
applying where the undertaker acquires a cellar, vault, arch or other construction forming part of a 
house, building or manufactory. 
Acquisition of part of certain properties 
24.—(1) This article applies instead of section 8(1) of the 1965 Act (other provisions as to 
divided land) (as applied by section 125 of the 2008 Act) where— 
(a) a notice to treat is served on a person (“the owner”) under the 1965 Act (as so applied) in 
respect of land forming only part of a house, building or manufactory or of land 
consisting of a house with a park or garden (“the land subject to the notice to treat”); and 
(b) a copy of this article is served on the owner with the notice to treat. 
(2) In such a case, the owner may, within the period of 21 days beginning with the day on which 
the notice was served, serve on the undertaker a counter-notice objecting to the sale of the land 
subject to the notice to treat which states that the owner is willing and able to sell the whole (“the 
land subject to the counter-notice”). 
(3) If no such counter-notice is served within that period, the owner is to be required to sell the 
land subject to the notice to treat. 
(4) If such a counter-notice is served within that period, the question whether the owner is 
required to sell only the land subject to the notice to treat is to be, unless the undertaker agrees to 
take the land subject to the counter-notice, referred to the tribunal. 
(5) If on such a reference the tribunal determines that the land subject to the notice to treat can 
be taken— 
(a) without material detriment to the remainder of the land subject to the counter-notice; or 
(b) where the land subject to the notice to treat consists of a house with a park or garden, 
without material detriment to the remainder of the land subject to the counter-notice and 
without seriously affecting the amenity and convenience of the house, 
the owner is to be required to sell the land subject to the notice to treat. 
(6) If on such a reference the tribunal determines that only part of the land subject to the notice 
to treat can be taken— 
(a) without material detriment to the remainder of the land subject to the counter-notice; or 
(b) where the land subject to the notice to treat consists of a house with a park or garden, 
without material detriment to the remainder of the land subject to the counter-notice and 
without seriously affecting the amenity and convenience of the house, 
the notice to treat is to be deemed to be a notice to treat for that part. 
(7) If on such a reference the tribunal determines that— 
(a) the land subject to the notice to treat cannot be taken without material detriment to the 
remainder of the land subject to the counter-notice; but 
(b) the material detriment is confined to a part of the land subject to the counter-notice, 
the notice to treat is to be deemed to be a notice to treat for the land to which the material 
detriment is confined in addition to the land already subject to the notice, whether or not the 
additional land is land which the undertaker is authorised to acquire compulsorily under this 
Order. 
 
18
(8) If the undertaker agrees to take the land subject to the counter-notice, or if the tribunal 
determines that— 
(a) none of the land subject to the notice to treat can be taken without material detriment to 
the remainder of the land subject to the counter-notice or, as the case may be, without 
material detriment to the remainder of the land subject to the counter-notice and without 
seriously affecting the amenity and convenience of the house; and

PART 7 
MISCELLANEOUS AND GENERAL 
Application of landlord and tenant law 
32.—(1) This article applies to— 
(a) any agreement for leasing to any person the whole or any part of the authorised 
development or the right to operate the same; and 
(b) any agreement entered into by the undertaker with any person for the construction, 
maintenance, use or operation of the authorised development, or any part of it, 
so far as any such agreement relates to the terms on which any land which is the subject of a 
lease granted by or under that agreement is to be provided for that person’s use. 
(2) No enactment or rule of law regulating the rights and obligations of landlords and tenants 
prejudices the operation of any agreement to which this article applies. 
(3) Accordingly, no such enactment or rule of law applies in relation to the rights and 
obligations of the parties to any lease granted by or under any such agreement so as to— 
(a) exclude or in any respect modify any of the rights and obligations of those parties under 
the terms of the lease, whether with respect to the termination of the tenancy or any other 
matter; 
(b) confer or impose on any such party any right or obligation arising out of or connected 
with anything done or omitted on or in relation to land which is the subject of the lease, in 
addition to any such right or obligation provided for by the terms of the lease; or 
(c) restrict the enforcement (whether by action for damages or otherwise) by any party to the 
lease of any obligation of any other party under the lease. 
Cases in which land is to be treated as not being operational land 
33. Development consent granted by this Order insofar as it relates to numbered work 2 
described in Schedule 1 is to be treated as specific planning permission for the purposes of section 
264(3)(a) of the 1990 Act (Cases in which land is to be treated as not being operational land). 
 
23
Defence to proceedings in respect of statutory nuisance 
34.—(1) Where proceedings are brought under section 82(1) of the Environmental Protection 
Act 1990 (summary proceedings by persons aggrieved by statutory nuisances)(a) in relation to a 
nuisance falling within paragraph (g) of section 79(1) of that Act (noise emitted from premises so 
as to be prejudicial to health or a nuisance) no order is to be made, and no fine may be imposed, 
under section 82(2) of that Act if— 
(a) the defendant shows that the nuisance— 
(i) relates to premises used by the undertaker for the purposes of or in connection with 
the construction or maintenance of the authorised development and that the nuisance 
is attributable to the carrying out of the authorised development in accordance with a 
notice served under section 60 (control of noise on construction sites), or a consent 
given under section 61 (prior consent for work on construction sites) or 65 (noise 
exceeding registered level), of the Control of Pollution Act 1974(b); or 
(ii) is a consequence of the construction or maintenance of the authorised development 
and that it cannot reasonably be avoided; or 
(b) the defendant shows that the nuisance is a consequence of the use of the authorised 
development and that it cannot reasonably be avoided. 
(2) Section 61(9) (consent for work on construction site to include statement that it does not of 
itself constitute a defence to proceedings under section 82 of the Environmental Protection Act 
1990) of the Control of Pollution Act 1974 and section 65(8) of that Act (corresponding provision 
in relation to consent for registered noise level to be exceeded), is not to apply where the consent 
relates to the use of premises by the undertaker for the purposes of or in connection with the 
construction or maintenance of the authorised development.

the owner of the land by reason of its severance from other land of the owner, or injuriously 
affecting that other land by the exercise of the powers conferred by this or the special Act.”. 
5. For section 8 of the 1965 Act (provisions as to divided land) there is substituted the following 
section— 
“8.—(1) Where in consequence of the service on a person under section 5 of this Act of a 
notice to treat in respect of a right over land consisting of a house, building or manufactory 
or of a park or garden belonging to a house (“the relevant land”)—

purchased or the restrictive covenant imposed without seriously affecting the 
amenity or convenience of the house to which that land belongs, 
the Hirwaun Generating Station Order 2015 (“the Order”) ceases, in relation to that person, 
to authorise the purchase of the right and be deemed to authorise the purchase of that 
person’s interest in the whole of the relevant land including, where the land consists of such 
a park or garden, the house to which it belongs, and the notice is deemed to authorise the 
purchase of that person’s interest in the whole of the relevant land including, where the land 
consists of such a park or garden, the house to which it belongs, and the notice is deemed to 
have been served in respect of that interest on such date as the tribunal directs. 
(2) Any question as to the extent of the land in which the Order is deemed to authorise the 
purchase of an interest by virtue of subsection (1) of this section must be determined by the 
tribunal. 
(3) Where in consequence of a determination of the tribunal that it is satisfied as 
mentioned in subsection (1) of this section the Order is deemed by virtue of that subsection 
to authorise the purchase of an interest in land, the acquiring authority may, at any time 
within the period of 6 weeks beginning with the date of the determination, withdraw the 
notice to treat in consequence of which the determination was made; but nothing in this 
subsection prejudices any other power of the authority to withdraw the notice.”. 
6. The following provisions of the 1965 Act (which state the effect of a deed poll executed in 
various circumstances where there is no conveyance by persons with interests in the land), that is 
to say— 
(a) section 9(4) (failure by owners to convey); 
(b) paragraph 10(3) of Schedule 1 (owners under incapacity); 
(c) paragraph 2(3) of Schedule 2 (absent and untraced owners); and 
(d) paragraphs 2(3) and 7(2) of Schedule 4 (common land), 
are modified as to secure that, as against persons with interests in the land which are expressed to 
be overridden by the deed, the right which is to be compulsorily acquired or the restrictive 
covenant which is to be imposed is vested absolutely in the acquiring authority. 
7. Section 11 of the 1965 Act (powers of entry) is modified as to secure that, as from the date on 
which the acquiring authority has served notice to treat in respect of any right it has power, 
exercisable in equivalent circumstances and subject to equivalent conditions, to enter for the 
purpose of exercising that right or enforcing that restrictive covenant (which is deemed for this 
 
42
purpose to have been created on that date of service of the notice); and sections 12 (penalty for 
unauthorised entry) and 13 (entry on warrant in the event of obstruction) of the 1965 Act are 
modified correspondingly. 
8. Section 20 of the 1965 Act (protection for interests of tenants at will, etc.) applies with the 
modifications necessary to secure that persons with such interests in land as are mentioned in that 
section are compensated in a manner corresponding to that in which they would be compensated 
on a compulsory acquisition under this Order of that land, but taking into account only the extent 
(if any) of such interference with such an interest as is actually caused, or likely to be caused, by 
the exercise of the right or the enforcement of the restrictive covenant in question. 
9. Section 22 of the 1965 Act (protection of acquiring authority’s possession where by 
inadvertence an estate, right or interest has not been got in) is modified as to enable the acquiring 
authority, in circumstances corresponding to those referred to in that section, to continue to be 
entitled to exercise the right acquired, subject to compliance with that section as respects 
compensation.

PART 1 
FOR THE PROTECTION OF NATIONAL GRID 
Application 
1. For the protection of National Grid as referred to in this Part of this Schedule the following 
provisions shall, unless otherwise agreed in writing between the undertaker and National Grid, 
have effect. 
Interpretation 
2. In this Part of this Schedule—

Grid to enable National Grid to fulfil its statutory functions in a manner no less efficient than 
previously; 
“apparatus” means 
(a) electric lines or electrical plant as defined in the Electricity Act 1989(a), belonging to or 
maintained by National Grid; 
(b) mains, pipes or other apparatus belonging to or maintained by National Grid for the 
purposes of gas supply; 
“authorised development” has the same meaning as in article 2 of this Order and (unless 
otherwise specified) for the purposes of this Schedule shall include the use and maintenance of 
the authorised development; 
“commence” has the same meaning as under section 56 of the 1990 Act and means the earliest 
date on which any material operation comprised in the authorised development begins to be 
carried out and commencement shall be construed to have the same meaning; 
“functions” includes powers and duties; 
“in” in a context referring to apparatus or alternative apparatus in land includes a reference to 
apparatus or alternative apparatus under, over, across, along or upon such land; 
“National Grid” means either—

as the context shall require; 
“plan” or “plans” include all designs, drawings, specifications, method statements, soil 
reports, programmes, calculations, risk assessments and other documents that are reasonably 
necessary properly and sufficiently to describe and assess the works to be executed. 
3. Except for paragraphs 4 (apparatus in streets subject to temporary prohibition or restriction), 
8, 9 (retained apparatus: protection), 10 (expenses) and 11 (indemnity) this Schedule does not 
                                                                                                                                       
(a) 1989 (c.29). 
 
46
apply to apparatus in respect of which the relations between the undertaker and National Grid are 
regulated by the provisions of Part 3 of the 1991 Act. 
Apparatus of National Grid in streets subject to temporary prohibition or restriction 
4. Notwithstanding the temporary prohibition or restriction under the powers of article 11 
(temporary prohibition or restriction of use of streets), National Grid shall be at liberty at all times 
to take all necessary access across any such street and/or to execute and do all such works and 
things in, upon or under any such street as may be reasonably necessary or desirable to enable it to 
maintain any apparatus which at the time of the prohibition or restriction was in that street. 
Acquisition of land 
5.—(1) Regardless of any provision in this Order or anything shown on the land plans or 
contained in the book of reference to the Order the undertaker must not acquire any land interest 
or apparatus or override any easement or other interest of National Grid otherwise than by 
agreement (such agreement not to be unreasonably withheld). 
(2) The undertaker and National Grid agree that where there is any inconsistency or duplication 
between the provisions set out in this Schedule relating to the relocation and/or removal of 
apparatus/including but not limited to the payment of costs and expenses relating to such 
relocation and/or removal of apparatus) and the provisions of any existing easement, rights, 
agreements and licences granted, used, enjoyed or exercised by National Grid as of right or other 
use in relation to the apparatus then the provisions in this Schedule shall prevail. 
Removal of apparatus 
6.—(1) If, in the exercise of the agreement reached in accordance with paragraph (5) or in any 
other authorised manner, the undertaker acquires any interest in any land in which any apparatus is 
placed, that apparatus must not be removed under this Part of this Schedule and any right of 
National Grid to maintain that apparatus in that land shall not be extinguished until alternative 
apparatus has been constructed, and is in operation to the reasonable satisfaction of National Grid 
in accordance with sub-paragraphs (2) to (5) inclusive. 
(2) If, for the purpose of executing any works comprised in the authorised development in, on, 
under or over any land purchased, held, appropriated or used under this Order, the undertaker 
requires the removal of any apparatus placed in that land, it must give to National Grid 56 days’ 
advance written notice of that requirement, together with a plan of the work proposed, and of the 
proposed position of the alternative apparatus to be provided or constructed and in that case (or if 
in consequence of the exercise of any of the powers conferred by this Order National Grid 
reasonably needs to remove any of its apparatus) the undertaker shall, subject to sub-paragraph 
(3), afford to National Grid to their satisfaction (taking into account paragraph 7 sub-paragraph (1) 
below) the necessary facilities and rights for— 
(a) the construction of alternative apparatus in other land of the undertaker; and 
(b) subsequently for the maintenance of that apparatus. 
(3) If alternative apparatus or any part of such apparatus is to be constructed elsewhere than in 
other land of the undertaker, or the undertaker is unable to afford such facilities and rights as are 
mentioned in sub-paragraph (2), in the land in which the alternative apparatus or part of such 
apparatus is to be constructed, National Grid must, on receipt of a written notice to that effect from 
the undertaker, take such steps as are reasonable in the circumstances in an endeavour to obtain 
the necessary facilities and rights in the land in which the alternative apparatus is to be constructed 
save that this obligation shall not extend to the requirement for National Grid to use its 
compulsory purchase powers to this end unless it elects to so do. 
(4) Any alternative apparatus to be constructed in land of the undertaker under this Part of this 
Schedule shall be constructed in such manner and in such line or situation as may be agreed 
between National Grid and the undertaker. 
 
47
(5) National Grid must, after the alternative apparatus to be provided or constructed has been 
agreed, and subject to the grant to National Grid of any such facilities and rights as are referred to 
in sub-paragraph (2) or (3), proceed without unnecessary delay to construct and bring into 
operation the alternative apparatus and subsequently to remove any apparatus required by the 
undertaker to be removed under the provisions of this Part of this Schedule. 
Facilities and rights for alternative apparatus 
7.—(1) Where, in accordance with the provisions of this Part of this Schedule, the undertaker 
affords to National Grid facilities and rights for the construction and maintenance in land of the 
undertaker of alternative apparatus in substitution for apparatus to be removed, those facilities and 
rights shall be granted upon such terms and conditions as may be agreed between the undertaker 
and National Grid and must be no less favourable on the whole to National Grid than the facilities 
and rights enjoyed by it in respect of the apparatus to be removed unless agreed by National Grid. 
(2) If the facilities and rights to be afforded by the undertaker and agreed with National Grid 
under paragraph 7 sub-paragraph (1) above in respect of any alternative apparatus, and the terms 
and conditions subject to which those facilities and rights are to be granted, are less favourable on 
the whole to National Grid than the facilities and rights enjoyed by it in respect of the apparatus to 
be removed and the terms and conditions to which those facilities and rights are subject in the 
matter shall be referred to arbitration and, the arbitrator shall make such provision for the payment 
of compensation by the undertaker to National Grid as appears to the arbitrator to be reasonable 
having regard to all the circumstances of the particular case. In respect of the appointment of an 
arbitrator under this sub-paragraph (2), article 39 of the Order shall apply. 
Retained apparatus: protection of National Grid as Gas Undertaker 
8.—(1) Not less than 56 days before the commencement of any authorised development 
authorised by this Order that involves activities or works specified in National Grid’s 
“Specification for safe working in the vicinity of National Grid, High pressure Gas pipelines and 
associated installation requirements for third parties T/SP/SSW22” that are within the proximities 
described therein to any apparatus the removal of which has not been required by the undertaker 
under paragraph 6 sub paragraph (2) or otherwise, the undertaker must submit to National Grid a 
plan. 
(2) In relation to works which will be situated on, over, under or within 15 metres measured in 
any direction of any apparatus to which sub-paragraph (1) applies, or (wherever situated) impose 
any load directly upon any such apparatus or involve embankment works within 15 metres of any 
such apparatus, the plan to be submitted to National Grid under sub-paragraph (1) shall show— 
(a) the exact position of the works; 
(b) the level at which these are proposed to be constructed or renewed; 
(c) the manner of their construction or renewal including details of excavation, positioning of 
plant etc.;

(3) The undertaker must not commence any works to which sub-paragraph (2) applies until 
National Grid has given written approval of the plan so submitted. 
(4) Any approval of National Grid required under sub-paragraph (3)— 
(a) may be given subject to reasonable conditions for any purpose mentioned in sub-
paragraph (5) or (7); 
 
48
(b) must not be unreasonably withheld. 
(5) In relation to a work to which sub-paragraphs (1) and (2) applies, National Grid may require

reasonable requirements as may be made in accordance with sub-paragraphs (4), (5), (7) and/or (8) 
by National Grid for the alteration or otherwise for the protection of the apparatus, or for securing 
access to it, and National Grid shall be entitled to watch and inspect the execution of those works. 
(7) Where National Grid requires protective works to be carried out either themselves or by the 
undertaker (whether of a temporary or permanent nature) such protective works shall be carried 
out to National Grid’s satisfaction prior to the commencement of any authorised development (or 
any relevant part thereof) and National Grid must give 56 days’ notice of such works from the date 
of submission of a plan in line with sub-paragraph (1) or (2) (except in an emergency). 
(8) If National Grid in accordance with sub-paragraph (5) or (7) and in consequence of the 
works proposed by the undertaker, reasonably requires the removal of any apparatus and gives 
written notice to the undertaker of that requirement, paragraphs 1 to 3 and 6 to 7 shall apply as if 
the removal of the apparatus had been required by the undertaker under paragraph 6 sub-paragraph 
(2). 
(9) Nothing in this paragraph shall preclude the undertaker from submitting at any time or from 
time to time, but in no case less that 56 days before commencing the execution of any works, a 
new plan, instead of the plan previously submitted, and having done so the provisions of this 
paragraph shall apply to and in respect of the new plan. 
(10) The undertaker shall not be required to comply with sub-paragraph (1) where it needs to 
carry out emergency works as defined in the 1991 Act but in that case it must give to National 
Grid notice as soon as is reasonably practicable and a plan of those works and shall— 
(a) comply with sub-paragraph (5), (6) and (7) insofar as is reasonably practicable in the 
circumstances; and 
(b) comply with sub-paragraph (11) at all times.

Danger from underground services”. 
Retained apparatus: protection of National Grid as Electricity Undertaker 
9.—(1) Not less than 56 days before the commencement of any authorised development under 
this Order that is near to, or will or may affect, any apparatus the removal of which has not been 
required by the undertaker under paragraph 6 sub-paragraph (2) or otherwise and to which sub-
paragraph (2)(i) or (2)(ii) applies, the undertaker must submit to National Grid a plan and seek 
from National Grid details of the underground extent of their electricity tower foundations. 
(2) In relation to works which will or may be situated on, over, under or within (i) 15 metres

(5) Any approval of National Grid required under sub-paragraph (1), (2) or (3)— 
(a) may be given subject to reasonable conditions for any purpose mentioned in this sub-
paragraph or sub-paragraph (8); 
(b) must not be unreasonably withheld. 
(6) In relation to a work to which sub-paragraph (1), (2) or (3) applies, National Grid may 
require such modifications to be made to the plans as may be reasonably necessary for the purpose 
of securing its system against interference or risk of damage or for the purpose of providing or 
securing proper and convenient means of access to any apparatus. 
(7) Works executed under sub-paragraph (1), (2) or (3) must be executed only in accordance 
with the plan, submitted under sub-paragraph (1) or as relevant sub-paragraph (2), (3) or (5), as 
amended from time to time by agreement between the undertaker and National Grid and in 
accordance with such reasonable requirements as may be made in accordance with sub-paragraph 
(5), (6), (8) and/or (9) by National Grid for the alteration or otherwise for the protection of the 
apparatus, or for securing access to it, and National Grid shall be entitled to watch and inspect the 
execution of those works. 
(8) Where National Grid require any protective works to be carried out either themselves or by 
the undertaker (whether of a temporary or permanent nature) such protective works must be 
carried out to the undertakers’ satisfaction prior to the commencement of any authorised 
development (or any relevant part thereof) and National Grid must give 56 days’ notice of such 
works from the date of submission of a plan in line with sub-paragraph (1), (2), (3) or (5) (except 
in an emergency). 
(9) If National Grid in accordance with sub-paragraph (6) or (8) and in consequence of the 
works proposed by the undertaker, reasonably requires the removal of any apparatus and gives

the removal of the apparatus had been required by the undertaker under paragraph 6 sub-paragraph 
(2). 
(10) Nothing in this paragraph shall preclude the undertaker from submitting at any time or from 
time to time, but in no case less than 56 days before commencing the execution of any works, a 
 
50
new plan, instead of the plan previously submitted, and having done so the provisions of this 
paragraph shall apply to and in respect of the new plan. 
(11) The undertaker shall not be required to comply with sub-paragraph (1) where it needs to 
carry out emergency works as defined in the 1991 Act but in that case it must give to National 
Grid notice as soon as is reasonably practicable and a plan of those works and shall— 
(a) comply with sub-paragraph (6), (7) and (8) insofar as is reasonably practicable in the 
circumstances; and 
(b) comply with sub-paragraph (12) at all times. 
(12) At all times when carrying out any works authorised under the Order comply with National 
Grid’s policies for development near over headlines ENA TA 43-8 and the Health and Safety 
Executive’s guidance note 6 “Avoidance of Danger from Overhead Lines”. 
Expenses 
10.—(1) Subject to the following provisions of this paragraph, the undertaker shall pay to 
National Grid on demand all charges, costs and expenses reasonably anticipated or incurred by 
that undertaker in, or in connection with, the inspection, removal, relaying or replacing, alteration 
or protection of any apparatus or the construction of any new apparatus which may be required in 
consequence of the execution of any such works as are referred to in this Schedule including 
without limitation— 
(a) any costs reasonably incurred or compensation properly paid in connection with the 
acquisition of rights or the exercise of statutory powers for such apparatus including 
without limitation in the event that National Grid elects to use compulsory purchase 
powers to acquire any necessary rights under paragraph 6 sub-paragraph (3) all costs 
incurred as a result of such action; 
(b) in connection with the cost of the carrying out of any diversion work or the provision of 
any alternative apparatus; 
(c) the cutting off of any apparatus from any other apparatus or the making safe of redundant 
apparatus; 
(d) the approval of plans; 
(e) the carrying out of protective works, plus a capitalised sum to cover the cost of 
maintaining and renewing permanent protective works; 
(f) the survey of any land, apparatus or works, the inspection and monitoring of works or the 
installation or removal of any temporary works reasonably necessary in consequence of 
the execution of any such works referred to in this Schedule. 
(2) There must be deducted from any sum payable under sub-paragraph (1) the value of any 
apparatus removed under the provisions of this Schedule and which is not re-used as part of the 
alternative apparatus, that value being calculated after removal. 
(3) If in accordance with the provisions of this Part of this Schedule— 
(a) apparatus of better type, of greater capacity or of greater dimensions is placed in 
substitution for existing apparatus of worse type, of smaller capacity or of smaller 
dimensions; or 
(b) apparatus (whether existing apparatus or apparatus substituted for existing apparatus) is 
placed at a depth greater than the depth at which the existing apparatus was situated, 
and the placing of apparatus of that type or capacity or of those dimensions or the placing of 
apparatus at that depth, as the case may be, is not agreed by the undertaker or in default of 
agreement settled by arbitration in accordance with article 39 (arbitration) of the Order to be 
necessary, then, if such placing involves cost in the construction of works under this Part of 
this Schedule exceeding that which would have been involved if the apparatus placed had 
been of the existing type, capacity or dimensions, or at the existing depth, as the case may be, 
the amount which apart from this sub-paragraph would be payable to National Grid by virtue 
of sub-paragraph (1) shall be reduced by the amount of that excess save where it is not 
 
51
possible in the circumstances to obtain the existing type of operations, capacity, dimensions or 
place at the existing depth in which case full costs shall be borne by the undertaker. 
(4) For the purposes of sub-paragraph (3)— 
(a) an extension of apparatus to a length greater than the length of existing apparatus shall 
not be treated as a placing of apparatus of greater dimensions than those of the existing 
apparatus; and 
(b) where the provision of a joint in a pipe or cable is agreed, or is determined to be 
necessary, the consequential provision of a jointing chamber or of a manhole shall be 
treated as if it also had been agreed or had been so determined. 
(5) An amount which apart from this sub-paragraph would be payable to National Grid in 
respect of works by virtue of sub-paragraph (1) shall, if the works include the placing of apparatus 
provided in substitution for apparatus placed more than 7 years and 6 months earlier so as to 
confer on National Grid any financial benefit by deferment of the time for renewal of the 
apparatus in the ordinary course, be reduced by the amount which represents that benefit. 
Indemnity 
11.—(1) Subject to sub-paragraphs (2) and (3), if by reason or in consequence of the 
construction of any works authorised by this Schedule or in consequence of the construction, use, 
maintenance or failure of any of the authorised development by or on behalf of the undertaker or 
in consequence of any act or default of the undertaker (or any person employed or authorised by 
him) in the course of carrying out such works (including without limitation works carried out by 
the undertaker under this Schedule or any subsidence resulting from any of these works), any 
material damage is caused to any apparatus or alternative apparatus (other than apparatus the 
repair of which is not reasonably necessary in view of its intended removal for the purposes of 
those works) or property of National Grid , or there is any interruption in any service provided, or 
in the supply of any goods, by National Grid , or National Grid becomes liable to pay any amount 
to any third party, the undertaker shall— 
(a) bear and pay on demand the cost reasonably incurred by National Grid in making good 
such damage or restoring the supply; and 
(b) indemnify National Grid for any other expenses, loss, demands, proceedings, damages, 
claims, penalty or costs incurred by or recovered from National Grid, by reason or in 
consequence of any such damage or interruption or National Grid becoming liable to any 
third party as aforesaid. 
(2) The fact that any act or thing may have been done by National Grid on behalf of the 
undertaker or in accordance with a plan approved by National Grid or in accordance with any 
requirement of National Grid as a consequence of the authorised development or under its 
supervision shall not (subject to sub-paragraph (3)) excuse the undertaker from liability under the 
provisions of this sub-paragraph (1) where the undertaker fails to carry out and execute the works 
properly with due care and attention and in a skilful and workman like manner or in a manner that 
does not materially accord with the approved plan or as otherwise agreed between the undertaker 
and National Grid. 
(3) Nothing in sub-paragraph (1) shall impose any liability on the undertaker in respect of— 
(a) any damage or interruption to the extent that it is attributable to the neglect or default of 
National Grid, its officers, servants, contractors or agents; and 
(b) any authorised development and/or any other works authorised by this Schedule carried 
out by National Grid as an assignee, transferee or lessee of the undertaker with the benefit 
of the Order pursuant to section 156 of the 2008 Act subject to the proviso that once such 
works become apparatus (“new apparatus”), any works yet to be executed and not falling 
within this sub-paragraph 3(b) shall be subject to the full terms of this Schedule including 
this paragraph 11 in respect of such new apparatus. 
(4) National Grid must give the undertaker reasonable notice of any such claim or demand and 
no settlement or compromise shall be made without first consulting the undertaker and considering 
their representations. 
 
52
(5) National Grid must use its reasonable endeavours to mitigate in whole or in part and to 
minimise any costs, expenses, loss, demands, and penalties to which the indemnity under this 
paragraph 11 applies. If requested to do so by the undertaker, National Grid shall provide an 
explanation of how the claim has been minimised. The undertaker shall only be liable under this 
paragraph 11 for claims reasonably incurred by National Grid. 
Enactments and agreements 
12. Nothing in this Part of this Schedule shall affect the provisions of any enactment or 
agreement regulating the relations between the undertaker and National Grid in respect of any 
apparatus laid or erected in land belonging to the undertaker on the date on which this Order is 
made. 
Co-operation 
13. National Grid and the undertaker must each use their best endeavours to co-ordinate with the 
other party on the timing and method of execution of any works carried out under the Order or this 
Schedule (including, for the avoidance of doubt, pursuant to paragraph 6 sub-paragraph (2) and 
paragraphs 8 or 12) in the interests of safety and the efficient and economic execution of the 
authorised development and taking into account the need to ensure the safe and efficient operation 
of the other party’s operations. 
Access 
14. If in consequence of the agreement reached in accordance with paragraph 5 sub-paragraph 
(1) or the powers granted under this Order the access to any apparatus is materially obstructed, the 
undertaker shall provide such alternative means of access to such apparatus as will enable 
National Grid to maintain or use the apparatus no less effectively than was possible before such 
obstruction. 
Arbitration 
15. Save for differences or disputes arising under paragraph 6(2), 6(4), 7(1), 8 and 9 any 
difference or dispute arising between the undertaker and National Grid under this Schedule shall, 
unless otherwise agreed in writing between the undertaker and National Grid, be determined by 
arbitration in accordance with article 39 (arbitration) of the Order.

PART 2 
FOR THE PROTECTION OF WESTERN POWER DISTRIBUTION 
16. For the protection of WPD as referred to in this Part of this Schedule the following 
provisions, unless otherwise agreed in writing between the undertaker and WPD, have effect. 
17. In this Part of this Schedule— 
“alternative apparatus” means alternative apparatus adequate to enable WPD to fulfil its 
statutory functions in a manner not less efficient than previously; 
“alternative rights” means all and any necessary legal easements, consents, or permissions 
required by WPD in order to permit or authorise a diversion; 
“apparatus” means electric lines or electrical plant as defined in the Electricity Act 1989, 
belonging to or maintained by WPD; 
“diversion” means an alteration to the WPD Network in order to enable or facilitate the 
authorised development; 
“WPD” means Western Power Distribution (South Wales) PLC (company number 02366985) 
whose registered office is at Avonbank, Feeder Road, Bristol BS2 0TB; 
“WPD Network” means WPD’s distribution network operated pursuant to its distribution 
licence issued pursuant to section 6 of the 1989 Act; and 
for the avoidance of doubt, all other terms are as defined in Part 1 of the Order. 
18. This Part of this Schedule does not apply to apparatus in respect of which the relations 
between the undertaker and WPD are regulated by the provisions of Part 3 of the 1991 Act. 
19. Regardless of any provision in this Order or anything shown on the land plans, the 
undertaker must not acquire any apparatus otherwise than by agreement. 
20.—(1) If, in the exercise of the powers conferred by this Order, the undertaker acquires any 
interest in any land in which any apparatus is placed, that apparatus must not be removed under 
this Part of this Schedule and any right of WPD to maintain that apparatus in that land must not be 
extinguished until alternative apparatus has been constructed and is in operation to the reasonable 
satisfaction of WPD. 
(2) If, for the purpose of executing any works in, on or under any land purchased, held, 
appropriated or used under this Order, the undertaker requires the removal of any apparatus placed 
in that land, it must give to WPD written notice of that requirement, together with a plan and 
section of the work proposed. 
(3) If alternative apparatus or any part of such apparatus is to be constructed as a consequence of 
the removal of apparatus placed on the land referred to in sub-paragraph 20(2), WPD must on 
receipt of a written notice to that effect from the undertaker, as soon as reasonably possible use its 
reasonable endeavours to obtain the alternative rights in other land in which the alternative 
apparatus is to be constructed. 
(4) WPD must, after the alternative apparatus to be provided or constructed has been agreed or 
settled by arbitration in accordance with article 39 of the Order and after the grant to WPD of any 
alternative rights, proceed without unnecessary delay to construct and bring into operation the 
alternative apparatus and subsequently to remove any apparatus required by the undertaker to be 
removed under the provisions of this Part of this Schedule. 
(5) In respect of apparatus on plots numbered 1_MS and 3_MS in the book of reference and land 
plans— 
(a) if requested by the undertaker, WPD must remove any of its apparatus within a building 
on those plots (or relocate such apparatus as applicable) within 56 days of the undertaker 
making such a request, unless factors outside the control of WPD prevent such a removal 
or relocation within the 56 day time period (for the avoidance of doubt the 56 day period 
 
54
shall only begin once all necessary consents and permissions for the relevant removal or 
relocation have been granted); and 
(b) WPD and the undertaker may agree for the undertaker to remove or relocate as applicable 
any of such apparatus; and 
(c) following the removal or relocation by WPD or the undertaker (as applicable) under sub-
paragraph 20(5)(a) or 20(5)(b), the undertaker may demolish such building(s). 
21.—(1) Not less than 28 days before starting the execution of any works in, on or under any 
land purchased, held, appropriated or used under this Order that are near to, or will or may affect 
any apparatus the removal of which has not been required by the undertaker under paragraph 
20(2), the undertaker must submit to WPD a plan, section and description of the works to be 
executed. For the avoidance of doubt, if any works referred to require any diversion or require 
WPD to obtain any alternative rights, the undertaker shall give WPD sufficient notice to obtain 
any such alternative rights and shall not commence works of the type described unless or until any 
such alternative rights have been obtained. 
(2) Those works must be executed only in accordance with the plan, section and description 
submitted under sub-paragraph 21(1) and in accordance with such reasonable requirements as may 
be made in accordance with sub-paragraph 21(3) by WPD for the alteration or otherwise for the 
protection of the apparatus, or for securing access to it. 
(3) Any requirements made by WPD under sub-paragraph 21(2) must be made within a 
reasonable period beginning with the date on which a plan, section and description under sub-
paragraph 21(1) are submitted to it. 
(4) If WPD in accordance with sub-paragraph 21(3) and in consequence of the works proposed 
by the undertaker, reasonably requires the removal of any apparatus and gives written notice to the 
undertaker of that requirement, paragraphs 16 to 20 apply as if the removal of the apparatus had 
been required by the undertaker under paragraph 20(2)). 
(5) Nothing in this paragraph precludes the undertaker from submitting at any time or from time 
to time, but in no case less than the reasonable period provided for in sub-paragraph 21(3) before 
commencing the execution of any works, a new plan, section and description instead of the plan, 
section and description previously submitted, and having done so the provisions of this paragraph 
apply to and in respect of the new plan, section and description. 
(6) The undertaker is not required to comply with sub-paragraph 21(1) in a case of emergency 
but in that case it must give to WPD notice as soon as is reasonably practicable and a plan, section 
and description of those works as soon as reasonably practicable subsequently and must comply 
with sub-paragraph 21(1)) in so far as is reasonably practicable in the circumstances. 
22.—(1) Subject to the following provisions of this paragraph, the undertaker must repay to 
WPD the proper and reasonable expenses reasonably incurred by WPD in, or in connection with, 
the inspection, removal, alteration or protection of any apparatus. 
(2) The value of any apparatus removed under the provisions of this Part of the Schedule is to be 
deducted from any sum payable under sub-paragraph 22(1), that value being calculated after 
removal. 
(3) If in accordance with the provisions of this Part of this Schedule— 
(a) apparatus of better type, of greater capacity or of greater dimensions is placed in 
substitution for existing apparatus of worse type, of smaller capacity or of smaller 
dimensions; or 
(b) apparatus (whether existing apparatus or apparatus substituted for existing apparatus) is 
placed at a depth greater than the depth at which the existing apparatus was, and the 
placing of apparatus of that type or capacity or of those dimensions or the placing of 
apparatus at that depth, as the case may be, is not agreed by the undertaker or, in default 
of agreement, is not determined by arbitration in accordance with article 39 of the Order 
to be necessary, then, if such placing involves cost in the construction of works under this 
Part of this Schedule exceeding that which would have been involved if the apparatus 
placed had been of the existing type, capacity or dimensions, or at the existing depth, as 
 
55
the case may be, the amount which apart from this sub-paragraph would be payable to 
WPD by virtue of sub-paragraph (1) is to be reduced by the amount of that excess. 
(4) For the purposes of sub-paragraph 22(3)— 
(a) an extension of apparatus to a length greater than the length of existing apparatus is not to 
be treated as a placing of apparatus of greater dimensions than those of the existing 
apparatus; and 
(b) where the provision of a joint in a cable is agreed, or is determined to be necessary, the 
consequential provision of a jointing chamber or of a manhole is to be treated as if it also 
had been agreed or had been so determined. 
(5) An amount which apart from this sub-paragraph would be payable to WPD in respect of 
works by virtue of sub-paragraph 22(1) must, if the works include the placing of apparatus 
provided in substitution for apparatus placed more than 7 years and 6 months earlier so as to 
confer on WPD any financial benefit by deferment of the time for renewal of the apparatus in the 
ordinary course, be reduced by the amount which represents that benefit. 
23. The undertaker will indemnify WPD and keep them indemnified in respect of any losses, 
costs, claims or liabilities arising out of, or as a consequence of anything done under this Part of 
this Schedule.

PART 3 
FOR THE PROTECTION OF ELECTRICITY, GAS, WATER AND SEWERAGE 
UNDERTAKERS 
24. For the protection of the utility undertakers referred to in this Part of this Schedule (save for 
National Grid, which is protected by and as defined in Part 1 of this Schedule, WPD, which is 
protected by and as defined in Part 2 of this Schedule and DCC, which is protected by and as 
defined in Part 7 of this Schedule), the following provisions have effect, unless otherwise agreed 
in writing between the undertaker and the utility undertakers concerned. 
25. In this Part of this Schedule— 
“alternative apparatus” means alternative apparatus adequate to enable the utility undertaker in 
question to fulfil its statutory functions in a manner not less efficient than previously; 
“apparatus” means— 
(a) in the case of an electricity undertaker, electric lines or electrical plant (as defined in the

(b) in the case of a gas undertaker, any mains, pipes or other apparatus belonging to or 
maintained by a gas transporter for the purposes of gas supply; 
(c) in the case of a water undertaker— 
(i) mains, pipes or other apparatus belonging to or maintained by that utility undertaker 
for the purposes of water supply; and 
(ii) any water mains or service pipes (or part of a water main or service pipe) that is the 
subject of an agreement to adopt made under section 51A of the Water Industry Act 
1991(a); 
(d) in the case of a sewerage undertaker— 
(i) any drain or works vested in the utility undertaker under the Water Industry Act 
1991; and 
(ii) any sewer which is so vested or is the subject of a notice of intention to adopt given 
under section 102(4) of that Act or an agreement to adopt made under section 104 of 
that Act, 
and includes a sludge main, disposal main (within the meaning of section 219 of that Act) 
or sewer outfall and any manholes, ventilating shafts, pumps or other accessories forming 
part of any such sewer, drain or works, and includes any structure in which apparatus is 
or is to be lodged or which gives or will give access to apparatus; 
“functions” includes powers and duties; 
“in”, in a context referring to apparatus or alternative apparatus in land, includes a reference to 
apparatus or alternative apparatus under, over or upon land; and 
“utility undertaker” means— 
(a) any licence holder within the meaning of Part 1 of the Electricity Act 1989; 
(b) a gas transporter within the meaning of Part 1 of the Gas Act 1986(b),

(d) a sewerage undertaker within the meaning of Part 1 of the Water Industry Act 1991, 
for the area of the authorised development, and in relation to any apparatus, means the utility 
undertaker to whom it belongs or by whom it is maintained. 
                                                                                                                                       
(a) 1991 (c.56). Section 51A to the 1991 Act was inserted by section 92(1) of the Water Act 2003(c.37). 
(b) 1986 (c.44). A new section 7 was substituted by section 5 of the Gas Act 1995 (c.45), and was further amended by section 
76 of the Utilities Act 2000 (c.27). 
 
57
26. This Part of this Schedule does not apply to apparatus in respect of which the relations 
between the undertaker and the utility undertaker are regulated by the provisions of Part 3 of the 
1991 Act. 
27. Regardless of the temporary prohibition or restriction of use of streets under the powers 
conferred by article 11 (temporary prohibition or restriction of use of streets), a utility undertaker 
is at liberty at all times to take all necessary access across any such street and to execute and do all 
such works and things in, upon or under any such street as may be reasonably necessary or 
desirable to enable it to maintain any apparatus which at the time of the prohibition or restriction 
was in that street. 
28. Regardless of any provision in this Order or anything shown on the land plans, the 
undertaker must not acquire any apparatus otherwise than by agreement. 
29.—(1) If, in the exercise of the powers conferred by this Order, the undertaker acquires any 
interest in any land in which any apparatus is placed or over which access to any apparatus is 
enjoyed or requires that the utility undertaker’s apparatus is relocated or diverted, that apparatus 
must not be removed under this Part of this Schedule, and any right of a utility undertaker to 
maintain that apparatus in that land and to gain access to it must not be extinguished, until 
alternative apparatus has been constructed and is in operation, and access to it has been provided, 
to the reasonable satisfaction of the utility undertaker in question in accordance with sub-
paragraphs (2) to (7). 
(2) If, for the purpose of executing any works in, on or under any land purchased, held, 
appropriated or used under this Order, the undertaker requires the removal of any apparatus placed 
in that land, the undertaker must give to the utility undertaker in question written notice of that 
requirement, together with a plan and section of the work proposed, and of the proposed position 
of the alternative apparatus to be provided or constructed and in that case (or if in consequence of 
the exercise of any of the powers conferred by this Order a utility undertaker reasonably needs to 
remove any of its apparatus) the undertaker must, subject to sub-paragraph (3), afford to the utility 
undertaker the necessary facilities and rights for the construction of alternative apparatus in other 
land of the undertaker and subsequently for the maintenance of that apparatus. 
(3) If alternative apparatus or any part of such apparatus is to be constructed elsewhere than in 
other land of the undertaker, or the undertaker is unable to afford such facilities and rights as are 
mentioned in sub-paragraph (2), in the land in which the alternative apparatus or part of such 
apparatus is to be constructed, the utility undertaker in question must, on receipt of a written 
notice to that effect from the undertaker, as soon as reasonably possible use reasonable endeavours 
to obtain the necessary facilities and rights in the land in which the alternative apparatus is to be 
constructed. 
(4) Any alternative apparatus to be constructed in land of the undertaker under this Part of this 
Schedule must be constructed in such manner and in such line or situation as may be agreed 
between the utility undertaker in question and the undertaker or in default of agreement settled by 
arbitration in accordance with article 39 (arbitration). 
(5) The utility undertaker in question must, after the alternative apparatus to be provided or 
constructed has been agreed or settled by arbitration in accordance with article 39 (arbitration), 
and after the grant to the utility undertaker of any such facilities and rights as are referred to in 
sub-paragraph (2) or (3), proceed without unnecessary delay to construct and bring into operation 
the alternative apparatus and subsequently to remove any apparatus required by the undertaker to 
be removed under the provisions of this Part of this Schedule. 
(6) Regardless of anything in sub-paragraph (5), if the undertaker gives notice in writing to the 
utility undertaker in question that it desires itself to execute any work, or part of any work, in 
connection with the construction or removal of apparatus in any land controlled by the undertaker, 
that work, instead of being executed by the utility undertaker, must be executed by the undertaker 
without unnecessary delay under the superintendence, if given, and to the reasonable satisfaction 
of the utility undertaker. 
(7) Nothing in sub-paragraph (6) authorises the undertaker to execute the placing, installation, 
bedding, packing, removal, connection or disconnection of any apparatus, or execute any filling 
 
58
around the apparatus (where the apparatus is laid in a trench) within 600 millimetres of the 
apparatus. 
30.—(1) Where, in accordance with the provisions of this Part of this Schedule, the undertaker 
affords to a utility undertaker facilities and rights for the construction and maintenance in land of 
the undertaker of alternative apparatus in substitution for apparatus to be removed, those facilities 
and rights must be granted upon such terms and conditions as may be agreed between the 
undertaker and the utility undertaker in question or in default of agreement settled by arbitration in 
accordance with article 39 (arbitration). 
(2) If the facilities and rights to be afforded by the undertaker in respect of any alternative 
apparatus, and the terms and conditions subject to which those facilities and rights are to be 
granted, are in the opinion of the arbitrator less favourable on the whole to the utility undertaker in 
question than the facilities and rights enjoyed by it in respect of the apparatus to be removed and 
the terms and conditions to which those facilities and rights are subject, the arbitrator must make 
such provision for the payment of compensation by the undertaker to that utility undertaker as 
appears to the arbitrator to be reasonable having regard to all the circumstances of the particular 
case. 
31.—(1) Not less than 28 days before starting the execution of any works in, on or under any 
land purchased, held, appropriated or used under this Order that are near to, or will or may affect, 
any apparatus the removal of which has not been required by the undertaker under paragraph 
29(2), the undertaker must submit to the utility undertaker in question a plan, section and 
description of the works to be executed. 
(2) Those works must be executed only in accordance with the plan, section and description 
submitted under sub-paragraph (1) and in accordance with such reasonable requirements as may 
be made in accordance with sub-paragraph (3) by the utility undertaker for the alteration or 
otherwise for the protection of the apparatus, or for securing access to it, and the utility undertaker 
is entitled to watch and inspect the execution of those works. 
(3) Any requirements made by a utility undertaker under sub-paragraph (2) must be made within 
a period of 21 days beginning with the date on which a plan, section and description under sub-
paragraph (1) are submitted to it. 
(4) If a utility undertaker in accordance with sub-paragraph (3) and in consequence of the works 
proposed by the undertaker, reasonably requires the removal of any apparatus and gives written 
notice to the undertaker of that requirement, paragraphs 24 to 30 apply as if the removal of the 
apparatus had been required by the undertaker under paragraph 29(2). 
(5) Nothing in this paragraph precludes the undertaker from submitting at any time or from time 
to time, but in no case less than 28 days before commencing the execution of any works, a new 
plan, section and description instead of the plan, section and description previously submitted, and 
having done so the provisions of this paragraph apply to and in respect of the new plan, section 
and description. 
(6) The undertaker is not required to comply with sub-paragraph (1) in a case of emergency but 
in that case it must give to the utility undertaker in question notice as soon as is reasonably 
practicable and a plan, section and description of those works as soon as reasonably practicable 
subsequently and must comply with sub-paragraph (2) in so far as is reasonably practicable in the 
circumstances. 
32.—(1) Subject to the following provisions of this paragraph, the undertaker must repay to a 
utility undertaker the reasonable expenses incurred by that utility undertaker in, or in connection 
with, the inspection, removal, alteration or protection of any apparatus or the construction of any 
new apparatus which may be required in consequence of the execution of any such works as are 
referred to in paragraph 29(2). 
(2) There is to be deducted from any sum payable under sub-paragraph (1) the value of any 
apparatus removed under the provisions of this Part of this Schedule, that value being calculated 
after removal. 
(3) in accordance with the provisions of this Part of this Schedule— 
 
59
(a) apparatus of better type, of greater capacity or of greater dimensions is placed in 
substitution for existing apparatus of worse type, of smaller capacity or of smaller 
dimensions; or 
(b) apparatus (whether existing apparatus or apparatus substituted for existing apparatus) is 
placed at a depth greater than the depth at which the existing apparatus was, 
and the placing of apparatus of that type or capacity or of those dimensions or the placing of 
apparatus at that depth, as the case may be, is not agreed by the undertaker or, in default of 
agreement, is not determined by arbitration in accordance with article 39 (arbitration) to be 
necessary, then, if such placing involves cost in the construction of works under this Part of 
this Schedule exceeding that which would have been involved if the apparatus placed had 
been of the existing type, capacity or dimensions, or at the existing depth, as the case may be, 
the amount which apart from this sub-paragraph would be payable to the utility undertaker in 
question by virtue of sub-paragraph (1) is to be reduced by the amount of that excess. 
(4) For the purposes of sub-paragraph (3)— 
(a) an extension of apparatus to a length greater than the length of existing apparatus is not to 
be treated as a placing of apparatus of greater dimensions than those of the existing 
apparatus where such extension is required in consequence of the execution of any such 
works as are referred to in paragraph 29(2); and 
(b) where the provision of a joint in a cable is agreed, or is determined to be necessary, the 
consequential provision of a jointing chamber or of a manhole is to be treated as if it also 
had been agreed or had been so determined. 
(5) An amount which apart from this sub-paragraph would be payable to a utility undertaker in 
respect of works by virtue of sub-paragraph (1), if the works include the placing of apparatus 
provided in substitution for apparatus placed more than 7 years and 6 months earlier so as to 
confer on the utility undertaker any financial benefit by deferment of the time for renewal of the 
apparatus in the ordinary course, is to be reduced by the amount which represents that benefit. 
33.—(1) Subject to sub-paragraphs (2) and (3), if by reason or in consequence of the 
construction of any of the works referred to in paragraph 29(2), any damage is caused to any 
apparatus (other than apparatus the repair of which is not reasonably necessary in view of its 
intended removal for the purposes of those works) or property of a utility undertaker, or there is 
any interruption in any service provided, or in the supply of any goods, by any utility undertaker, 
the undertaker must— 
(a) bear and pay the cost reasonably incurred by that utility undertaker in making good such 
damage or restoring the supply; and 
(b) make reasonable compensation to that utility undertaker for any other expenses, loss, 
damages, penalty or costs incurred by the utility undertaker, 
by reason or in consequence of any such damage or interruption. 
(2) Nothing in sub-paragraph (1) imposes any liability on the undertaker with respect to any 
damage or interruption to the extent that it is attributable to the act, neglect or default of a utility 
undertaker, its officers, servants, contractors or agents. 
(3) A utility undertaker must give the undertaker reasonable notice of any such claim or demand 
and no settlement or compromise is to be made without the consent of the undertaker which, if it 
withholds such consent, has the sole conduct of any settlement or compromise or of any 
proceedings necessary to resist the claim or demand. 
34. Nothing in this Part of this Schedule affects the provisions of any enactment or agreement 
regulating the relations between the undertaker and a utility undertaking in respect of any 
apparatus laid or erected in land belonging to the undertaker on the date on which this Order is 
made. 
 
 
60
PART 4 
FOR THE PROTECTION OF OPERATORS OF ELECTRONIC 
COMMUNICATIONS CODE NETWORKS 
35.—(1) For the protection of any operator, the following provisions have effect, unless 
otherwise agreed in writing between the undertaker and the operator. 
(2) In this Part of this Schedule— 
“the 2003 Act” means the Communications Act 2003(a); 
“conduit system” has the same meaning as in the electronic communications code and 
references to providing a conduit system are to be construed in accordance with paragraph 
1(3A)(b) of that code; 
“electronic communications apparatus” has the same meaning as in the electronic 
communications code; 
“the electronic communications code” has the same meaning as in Chapter 1 of Part 2 of the 
2003 Act(c); 
“electronic communications code network” means— 
(a) so much of an electronic communications network or conduit system provided by an 
electronic communications code operator as is not excluded from the application of the

(b) an electronic communications network which the Secretary of State is providing or 
proposing to provide; 
“electronic communications code operator” means a person in whose case the electronic 
communications code is applied by a direction under section 106 of the 2003 Act; and 
“operator” means the operator of an electronic communications code network.

undertaker shall submit to DCC written notice together with a draft specification. 
(2) DCC shall examine the draft specification submitted under sub-paragraph 52(1) and give its

draft specification (including the proposed commencement date and anticipated completion date) 
within 28 days from the date of receipt (and in the event of amendments the process in this sub-
paragraph 52(2) shall be repeated where those amendments are not accepted). For the avoidance of 
doubt, DCC’s proposed amendments may include such reasonable requirements for the alteration 
(including but not limited to the extension of DCC apparatus) or otherwise for the protection of

(3) Once approved under sub-paragraph 52(2), the draft specification shall become the 
specification and the works shall be executed only in accordance with the specification and such 
 
66
reasonable requirements as may be made in accordance with sub paragraph 52(2) and DCC shall

paragraph 52(2) to DCC apparatus, and if DCC opts to do so it shall— 
(a) agree the scope and timings of the works with the undertaker (and the undertaker shall not 
unreasonably withhold or delay its agreement to the same);

any public sewer or drain vested in DCC unless otherwise agreed with DCC. 
(8) Only DCC is permitted to make openings into and/or connections with and/or carry out any 
works on or within any public water main vested in DCC unless otherwise agreed with DCC. 
(9) Where DCC apparatus will be affected by the works the undertaker must determine the exact 
location of DCC apparatus prior to any works being carried out by the undertaker and the 
undertaker should contact DCC where trial holes are required. 
(10) Any affected DCC apparatus which is no longer required by DCC but is not removed shall 
be transferred to the undertaker by way of a deed of transfer from DCC at the undertaker’s 
expense and on such terms as DCC reasonably requires. 
Suspension of works 
53. DCC shall be entitled to instruct the undertaker to suspend the works if in DCC’s reasonable 
opinion the actions of the undertaker, or those of its contractor(s) or subcontractor(s) in carrying 
out the works, have caused damage to any DCC apparatus and/or are likely to cause or result in 
damage to any DCC apparatus and/or have caused or are likely to cause damage to the 
environment arising as a result of damage to DCC apparatus. In the event of such instruction being 
given by DCC— 
(a) the undertaker shall procure that it and its contractor(s) and subcontractor(s) shall 
forthwith suspend or cease the works having due regard to health and safety factors and 
shall discuss and agree with DCC the remedial actions required prior to resuming the 
works; 
(b) the undertaker and DCC shall act reasonably and without delay in discussing and 
agreeing any remedial actions required prior to resuming the works; 
(c) DCC shall submit to the undertaker within 3 days following the suspension, a written 
notice specifying the reasons for suspending the works; 
 
67
(d) in the event that DCC fails to supply the written notice within 3 days of suspension 
DCC’s instruction to suspend the works shall be void and the undertaker shall be entitled 
to recommence the works; and 
(2) DCC shall commence, carry out and complete any remedial works pursuant to sub-paragraph 
53(a), as soon as reasonably practicable and DCC shall give the undertaker notice immediately 
upon completion of such remedial works and on receipt of such notice the undertaker shall be 
entitled to resume the works. 
(3) DCC shall be entitled to reclaim all reasonable costs of all remedial works undertaken in 
accordance with this paragraph 53. 
54.—(1) In the event that either the undertaker or DCC (for the purpose of this paragraph 54 
“the party” or together “the parties”) wishes to take any action which would impact on the ability 
of the undertaker to carry out the development or DCC to carry out its statutory functions, the 
parties shall use reasonable endeavours to cooperate with one another in order to align work 
streams so to minimise or avoid disruption to the other party’s works. In respect of the references 
to ‘work’ and ‘works’ in this sub-paragraph 54(1), to the extent that this refers to ‘work’ or 
‘works’ to be undertaken by DCC, the definition of works in paragraph 49 of this Part does not 
apply. 
(2) Subject to paragraph 55, differences or disputes arising between the undertaker and DCC 
under this Schedule shall, unless otherwise agreed in writing between the undertaker and DCC, be 
determined by arbitration in accordance with article 39 (arbitration) of the Order. 
Emergency Works 
55.—(1) The undertaker is permitted to carry out emergency works provided that it first notifies 
DCC of the proposed emergency works. For the avoidance of doubt, in the event that DCC suffers 
any loss, cost or damage as a result of the emergency action taken by the undertaker without prior 
notification the indemnity in paragraph 57 shall apply. 
(2) DCC shall at all times be permitted to carry out any emergency works in relation to its DCC 
apparatus within the Order Limits in accordance with Part II Schedule 6 WIA 1991. 
(3) Emergency works required in order for DCC to fulfil its statutory functions under sub-
paragraph 55(2) shall take precedence over works to be carried out by the undertaker and, in such 
circumstances, the undertaker shall reschedule its works accordingly. 
(4) In respect of the references to ‘work’ and ‘works’ in this paragraph 55, to the extent that this 
is ‘work’ or ‘works’ to be undertaken by DCC, the definition of works in paragraph 49 of this Part 
does not apply. 
Insurance 
56. The undertaker shall not commence any works under paragraph 52(1) to this Part unless and 
until the undertaker has procured acceptable insurance. 
Damage to DCC apparatus 
57.—(1) Subject to sub-paragraphs 57(3), (4) (5) and (6), the undertaker shall indemnify and 
hold harmless DCC against all claims demands costs damages expenses penalties and losses which 
DCC may have or sustain or become liable for in consequence of works under paragraph 52(1) to 
this Part in respect of— 
(a) the commencement, carrying out, execution or retention of the works or any breach of 
this Part relating to the performance of the works and shall pay compensation for loss, 
damage or injury caused by the actions or default of the undertaker, its contractors, 
subcontractors, licensees, agents and invitees relating to the performance of the works; 
and 
(b) damage to the environment caused by the undertaker during any works including but not 
limited to pollution and/or contamination; and 
 
68
(c) any breach of any stipulation or otherwise of any deeds of grant (or any renewal of any of 
the deeds of grant made on substantially the same terms provided that DCC has supplied 
the undertaker with a copy of the new document) arising from the works; and 
(2) Subject to sub-paragraphs 57(3), (4), (5) and (6), the undertaker shall bear and pay the costs 
reasonably incurred by DCC in making good damage to DCC apparatus or restoring an 
interruption in the supply provided by DCC. 
(3) Nothing in sub-paragraph 57(1) shall impose any liability on the undertaker with respect to 
any damage or interruption to the extent that it is attributable to the act, neglect or default of DCC, 
its officers, servants, contractors or agents. 
(4) DCC shall give the undertaker reasonable notice of any such claim or demand and no 
settlement or compromise shall be made without the consent of the undertaker. . 
(5) Nothing in this Part shall affect the provisions of any enactment or agreement regulating the 
relations between the undertaker and DCC in respect of any DCC apparatus laid or erected in land 
belonging to the undertaker on the date on which the Order is made. 
(6) DCC must use its reasonable endeavours to mitigate in whole or in part and to minimise any 
costs, expenses, loss, demands, and penalties to which the indemnity under this paragraph 57 
applies. If requested to do so by the undertaker, DCC shall provide an explanation of how the 
claim has been minimised. The undertaker shall only be liable under this paragraph 57 for claims 
reasonably incurred by DCC.

undertaker to the appointed person, the relevant planning authority and any requirement consultee 
on the date specified by the appointed person (the “specified date”), and the appointed person 
must notify the appeal parties of the revised timetable for the appeal on or before that day. The 
revised timetable for the appeal must require submission of written representations to the 
appointed person within ten (10) business days of the specified date but must otherwise be in 
accordance with the process and time limits set out in sub-paragraph (2)(c)-(e). 
(5) On an appeal under this paragraph, the appointed person may— 
(a) allow or dismiss the appeal, or 
(b) reverse or vary any part of the decision of the relevant planning authority (whether the 
appeal relates to that part of it or not), 
and may deal with the application as if it had been made to him in the first instance. 
(6) The appointed person may proceed to a decision on an appeal taking into account only such 
written representations as have been sent within the relevant time limits. 
(7) The appointed person may proceed to a decision even though no written representations have 
been made within the relevant time limits, if it appears to him that there is sufficient material to 
enable a decision to be made on the merits of the case. 
(8) The decision of the appointed person on an appeal is to be final and binding on the parties, 
and a court may entertain proceedings for questioning the decision only if the proceedings are 
brought by a claim for judicial review. 
(9) If an approval is given by the appointed person pursuant to this Schedule, it is deemed to be 
an approval for the purpose of Schedule 1 of this Order as if it had been given by the relevant 
planning authority. The relevant planning authority may confirm any determination given by the 
appointed person in identical form in writing but a failure to give such confirmation (or a failure to 
give it in identical form) is not be taken to affect or invalidate the effect of the appointed person’s 
determination. 
(10) Save where a direction is given pursuant to sub-paragraph (11) requiring the costs of the 
appointed person to be paid by the relevant planning authority, the reasonable costs of the 
appointed person must be met by the undertaker. 
(11) On application by the relevant planning authority or the undertaker, the appointed person 
may give directions as to the costs of the appeal parties and as to the parties by whom the costs of 
the appeal are to be paid. In considering whether to make any such direction and the terms on 
which it is to be made, the appointed person must have regard to Welsh Government Circular 
NAFWC 07/2003 Planning (and analogous) Appeals and Call-in Procedures or any circular or 
guidance which may from time to time replace it.
