Value of Bioenergy with Carbon 
Capture and Storage (BECCS) to 
the UK Decarbonisation Pathway
A vital contribution to UK decarbonisation
2
Drax is the largest decarbonisation project in Europe.       
Now we want to go further.
•
Drax has already transformed its power station near Selby, North 
Yorkshire to become the largest decarbonisation project in 
Europe, having converted it to use sustainable biomass instead 
of coal.
•
Now we have ambitions to go further by using bioenergy with 
carbon capture and storage (BECCS) to permanently remove 
millions of tonnes of CO2 each year from the atmosphere.
•
Drax has kickstarted the planning process to build this vital 
negative emissions technology, which will make a significant 
contribution to efforts to address climate change whilst creating 
thousands of new jobs and supporting a post-covid economic 
recovery.
•
We have a unique window of opportunity to deliver a crucial 
element of the UK’s decarbonisation infrastructure. 
The need for negative emissions
3
To prevent harmful climate change, 
reducing emissions won’t be enough.
•
To reach net zero we need to reduce emissions across 
each sector of the global economy.
•
But by 2050 a significant volume of emissions will still 
be emitted by hard-to-decarbonise sectors such as 
agriculture, aviation and certain heavy industries.
•
To tackle climate change and reach net zero, we need to 
remove carbon dioxide from the atmosphere in order 
to compensate for any residual emissions.
•
According to the Climate Change Committee’s (CCC) 6th
Carbon Budget, BECCS in power will need to remove 
16-39 million tonnes of CO2 a year by 2050 to meet net 
zero targets. The first phase of BECCS at Drax could 
deliver 8 million tonnes of CO2 by 2030.

•
In its “Balanced Pathway” scenario, the ​CCC estimates 58 
million tonnes per year (mtpa) of negative emissions will 
be needed from greenhouse gas removals by 2050, of 
which 19mtpa will come from BECCS in power.
•
BECCS in power is deployed from 2027 in all CCC scenarios.
•
CCC scenarios have up to 39mtpa of greenhouse gas 
removals from BECCS power  by 2050.

BECCS-Power is needed to operate a decarbonised power grid

All National Grid’s Net Zero Future Energy Scenarios 
deploy BECCS by 2028 and see a rapid increase in capacity 
in the 2030s 
•
This enables the power sector to be net zero by the 
early-mid 2030s.
•
National Grid has committed to being able to run a zero 
carbon grid by 2025.  To achieve this, it needs reliable 
sources of low carbon power.
•
BECCS provides valuable power system services, such as 
inertia and voltage control, which are increasingly 
important as National Grid manages a power system 
with more intermittent renewables.

Without early deployment of BECCS,                                         
the UK’s path to Net Zero is much more challenging
•
Emissions have fallen by 40% in the last 3 decades – mostly from 
easy to achieve reductions in the power sector. 
•
Emissions will have to fall more quickly than the 4th and 5th carbon 
budgets to achieve the 6th carbon budget and net zero.  This will 
require more action and engagement from individuals in society.  
Today…
•
Less than 5% of the energy used for heating homes and 
buildings is low carbon 
•
99% of all miles driven on UK roads are in vehicles with petrol 
and diesel engines
•
Deploying BECCS in 2027 would enable the Government to 
achieve the step change in emissions required to get from the 4th
to the 5th and 6th carbon budgets, providing headroom if other 
sectors of the economy prove harder and slower to decarbonise.

Optimal build-out 
and the role of BECCS-Power
The role and value 
of the Drax-BECCS project
•
Baringa were engaged by Drax to analyse the system value of Bioenergy with CCS (BECCS) both within the power sector and for whole system 
decarbonisation, as part of meeting the UK’s Net Zero targets.  
•
They explored the role of BECCS-Power in driving cost-optimal pathways to meet net zero using three scenarios: Central, Downside and Upside, to test 
the role of BECCS-Power under different conditions. 
•
Key assumptions were aligned with published UK Government and Climate Change Committee (CCC) sources, in particular benchmarking results with 
analysis seen in the recent CCC 6th Carbon Budget publication.
•
The analysis aimed to answer the following key questions:
•
Drax is progressing plans to deploy carbon 
capture and storage on two of its biomass 
units, which would capture 8 million tonnes 
of CO2 per year by 2030. This means Drax 
could deliver 40% of the CCC’s Balanced 
Pathway 2050 BECCS power target by 2030.
•
With an effective negative emissions policy 
and investment framework, the first BECCS 
unit could be operational by 2027. 
•
In all scenarios, the decarbonisation 
pathway is lower cost if Drax-BECCS is 
deployed in 2027.
•
There are additional innovation and 
learning benefits from the early deployment 
of Drax-BECCS.
•
Without Drax BECCS in 2027, it will cost the 
UK £13bn more to achieve the 5th carbon 
budget, and over £26bn more to achieve 
net zero. This is the equivalent of 
approximately £30 per year for each 
household in the UK, to reach net zero.
•
If you don’t deploy Drax in 2027 you have to 
spend more money sooner, because of the 
lead times for deployment to build more 
wind, solar and storage 2021-27.
•
If you don’t deploy Drax in 2027, the UK will 
be more reliant on measures that require 
consumer action in heat and transport –
both of which are much more challenging to 
achieve than a single large negative 
emissions project.
•
Negative emissions are required to offset 
residual emissions from hard to abate 
sectors such as agriculture, aviation and 
certain heavy industries.
•
Engineered solutions such as BECCS-Power 
can make a major contribution.
•
The Government’s 68% NDC commitment, 
alongside the findings of the CCC 6th carbon 
budget and the National Grid Future Energy 
Scenarios Report, all reinforce that net zero 
is only achievable through negative 
emissions and BECCS-Power in the UK. 
Executive Summary | Baringa Findings
The case for negative 
emissions is clear
Achieving the 5th carbon budget and 
net zero is significantly more 
expensive without Drax BECCS

in the late 2020s is ‘no regrets’
The need for negative emissions | Baringa Analysis

Negative emissions are critical to 
achieving Net Zero.
•
Negative emissions are required to offset residual 
emissions across the economy.  Engineered solutions 
such as BECCS-Power can make a major contribution. 
•
Baringa analysis suggests there is strong demand for 
CO2 removals (50-80MT CO2) in additional to LULUCF 
to offset residual emissions from sectors that are 
harder to decarbonise. 
•
BECCS-Power provides a large portion of negative 
emissions in all cases, even in scenarios where 
conditions for BECCS-Power are less favourable
compared to other BECCS negative emission routes.

Achieving Net Zero is significantly more expensive without BECCS at Drax 
in 2027
10
It is much more challenging and more expensive to 
achieve the 5th carbon budget and net zero without early 
deployment of BECCS
•
If the option to build Drax BECCS in 2027 is not taken, it will cost 
the UK £13bn more to achieve the 5th carbon budget, and over 
£26bn more to achieve net zero.
•
If you don’t deploy Drax in 2027 you have to spend more 
money sooner, because of the lead times for deployment – you 
have to build more wind, solar and storage in the period 2021-
27.
•
If you don’t deploy Drax in 2027, the UK will be more reliant on 
measures that require consumer action in heat and transport –
both of which are much more challenging to achieve than a 
single large negative emissions project delivered by a private 
company.

The deployment of BECCS-Power drives 
cost-optimal pathways to meet net zero.
•
BECCS-power is deployed in all scenarios – with 2-
10GW of capacity in 2050 – providing 13-73 MTpa of 
negative emissions. This compares with the 5-12GW 
of capacity forecast by National Grid FES in 2050, and 
the central and downside scenarios are broadly in 
line with the 16-39 MTpa of negative emissions from 
BECCS-power suggested by the CCC. 
•
Running BECCS at high load factors will provide 
strategically important benefits, including:
o Banking negative emissions to mitigate the risk 
of underperformance in other sectors
o Providing a valuable source of firm, reliable 
negative carbon power to complement 
intermittent renewable technologies
Capacity of BECCS-Power Installed
*When converted to BECCS, Drax units are derated from 630 MW to 460 MW
•
Two Drax biomass units* are converted to BECCS in 2027-29 in all three 
scenarios. An additional 1 – 9 GW of new build BECCS is added from 2030 – 2050.
•
In all cases, it is cost-effective to run the BECCS capacity at high load factors for a 
significant part of the pathway. In the last 10 years, some biomass is used for to 
BECCS hydrogen production, and BECCS in power operates more flexibly to 
complement intermittent renewables.
12
Overall electricity demand doubles by 2050, 
with generation dominated by renewables
•
Managing a grid with an increasing proportion of 
intermittent generation is a challenge. 
•
National Grid has committed to being able to run a zero 
carbon power system from 2025.
•
Low and negative carbon technologies that provide inertia 
and other ancillary services, such as BECCS, are 
increasingly important.
•
As the proportion of intermittent generation increases 
further towards 2050, BECCS is able to operate flexibly to 
help balance supply and demand.

In all scenarios, the decarbonisation pathway is 
lower cost if BECCS at Drax is deployed in 2027
BECCS at Drax in the late 2020s is a ‘no regrets’ option
Drax BECCS is deployed in all scenarios – with between 1 and 9GW of additional 
new build capacity required by 2050.
The opportunity cost of not having the Drax-BECCS project is driven by both the lower 
cost of the Drax project compared to new build as well as the value of facilitating 
power sector and broader decarbonisation earlier in the pathway, particularly given 
the UK’s challenging target of a 68% reduction in emissions by 2030. 
•
Without BECCS at Drax, system costs rise significantly, 
ranging from £12-32bn across the pathway. By not 
deploying Drax BECCS in 2027, the system is unable to 
deploy any BECCS Power until the 2030s.
•
There are additional innovation and learning benefits from 
the early deployment of Drax-BECCS:
o
Conversion of Drax’s existing biomass units can pave the way 
to a substantial programme of new build BECCS and other 
negative emissions technologies, with the optimum pathway 
being refined as technologies mature and costs evolve.  
o
Drax-BECCS can also provide an important “anchor project” 
for development of the CO2 Transmission & Storage 
infrastructure as part of the Humber CCS cluster.
