IEA Bioenergy – Selected Highlights From 2017
1. 
Technology Roadmap: Delivering Sustainable Bioenergy
As part of its series of technology roadmaps, the IEA had published 
two documents relating to bioenergy; one on biofuels for transport 
(2011) and one on bioenergy for heat and power (2012). The aim 
of this project was to produce a single roadmap encompassing 
bioenergy for transport, heat and power, which would update 
the previous publications in light of developments in policy and 
technology and allow a holistic approach taking account of the 
fact that some of the key issues around feedstock availability 
and sustainability were relevant for all sectors. The roadmap was 
produced as a joint effort between the IEA Secretariat and the IEA Bioenergy TCP, with 
inputs from a range of other expert organisations including OECD, FAO, IRENA and the 
European Commission. In the Roadmap, modern bioenergy plays an essential role in the 
International Energy Agency (IEA) 2°C Scenario (2DS), providing nearly 17% of final 
energy demand in 2060 compared to 4.5% in 2015. Bioenergy provides almost 20% of 
the cumulative carbon savings to 2060. It would be difficult to replace this important 
contribution. To play this important role, bioenergy must be produced and used in a 
sustainable way – significantly reducing greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions compared to 
fossil fuels and helping to achieve sustainable development goals. The report is available 
at http://www.iea.org/publications/freepublications/publication/Technology_Roadmap_

The role of industrial biorefineries in a low-carbon economy
Workshop held in collaboration with 
the IEA IETS TCP
The transformation to a low carbon-
economy requires a change in the whole 
system. An important contribution will 
be required from industry in terms 
of energy conservation and shifting 
to renewable feedstocks. Industrial 
biorefineries play a central role in this 
process towards efficient and low-
carbon production systems. A clear time 
perspective is needed, as the societal 
conditions and surrounding systems for 
industrial production will also change.

IETS TCP examined the role of industrial biorefineries in the transformation to a low-
carbon economy, with a number of successful examples and interactive discussions with 
the audience on how such transition could be realised. It was an excellent example of the 
added value of collaboration between TCPs and resulted in a jointly produced workshop

Bioenergy for sustainable development
This paper is the result of a collaboration involving IEA Bioenergy, IRENA and FAO. 
It originated from a joint workshop involving IEA Bioenergy, GSE, FAO and IRENA, 
which was held in Rome in May 2016 on the theme Mobilising sustainable bioenergy 
supply chains: opportunities for agriculture. Some key messages from the workshop 
and the paper include the following:
• bioenergy can play an important and constructive role in achieving the UN 
Sustainable Development Goals and implementing the Paris Agreement 
on Climate Change, thereby advancing climate goals, food security, better 
land use and sustainable energy for all.
• there are several options for sustainable bioenergy expansion, including 
sustainable intensification and landscape planning, sustainable forest management, 
using waste and organic residues (respecting soil conditions), restoring degraded or 
marginal lands and reducing losses in the food chain.
• multi-functional land uses can be promoted, also in developing countries, providing 
sufficient food and animal feed, as well as biomass for energy and other valuable bio-
based products.
• bioenergy is part of a larger bioeconomy. The attitude towards biomass production 
for food, bioenergy and other purposes should evolve from single end-use orientation 
to integrated production systems.

BIO-CCS and Bio-CCUS in climate change 
mitigation and extended use of biomass raw 
material

What is Bio-CCU and Bio-CCS?
What is Bio-CCS?
The term Bio-CCS describes concepts that combine biomass use with carbon capture 
and storage. As opposed to fossil CCS, which only decreases the rate of CO2 entering the 
atmosphere to nearly zero at best, Bio-CCS has the potential to achieve net removal of 
CO2 from the atmosphere. By binding atmospheric carbon during growth of biomass and 
subsequently capturing CO2 from the biomass conversion process for permanent storage 
in geological formations carbon is extracted from the carbon cycle. Provided that the 
biomass use is sustainable, Bio-CCS has the potential to generate net negative emissions, 
and can remove historic CO2 emissions from the atmosphere and offset CO2 emission from 
sectors more challenging to decarbonise. The terminology in the literature is not fully 
consistent. Both Bio-CCS and BECCS (bioenergy and carbon capture and storage) are 
being used interchangeably. However, Bio-CCS usually has a wider context, including for 
instance biochemical production, whereas BECCS is literally referring to applications in 
the energy sector.
Figure 1. Conceptual comparison of carbon flows in fossil energy, bioenergy and Bio-CCS processes

What is carbon capture and utilisation (CCU)?
Carbon capture and utilisation refers to the use of pure CO2 or CO2-containing gas 
mixtures as a feedstock to produce fuels, chemicals and materials. When fuels, chemicals 
and materials are produced using low-carbon energy sources, these products could displace 
their fossil counterparts and reduce net carbon emissions to the atmosphere.
The CO2 molecule is at the lowest energy potential and the conversion of CO2 into fuels 
or chemicals is highly energy-intensive. Consequently, the effectiveness of the whole CCU 
system as a climate mitigation option mainly depends on two conditions:
• Whether the energy input for CO2 conversion originates from low-carbon or fossil 
sources
• Whether the CO2 utilised as feedstock comes from a fossil or atmospheric source
In traditional, fossil resources based processes, carbon and energy originate from the same 
source. CCU enables different inputs for energy (e.g. electricity) and carbon (CO2). In this 
context, carbon originating from the atmosphere (mixture of biogenic and fossil), captured 
either through direct air capture or by sustainable biomass is defined as atmospheric 
carbon. Fossil carbon is defined as carbon originating from fossil sources such as oil, 
gas and coal, whose extraction from below ground and whose anthropogenic use adds 
more CO2 to the atmosphere unless permanently stored.
Figure 2. CCU is fundamentally different from CCS
5
CCU and climate impact
For CCU to be able to offer neutral emission solutions and have an impact as a climate 
mitigation measure there are two essential requirements:
• Low-carbon/carbon neutral energy input for CO2 conversion
• The carbon used as feedstock needs to be atmospheric
Unless these two prerequisites are met, fossil CO2 will eventually reach the atmosphere, 
either by producing energy from fossil sources for the conversion of CO2 to products or 
when releasing fossil CO2 contained in the product at the end of its lifetime. With few 
exceptions, CCU delays CO2 emissions on average by ~6 years (average of all products). 
For hydrocarbon fuel this average delay is less than a year. In order to have a climate 
impact, the delay should be at least in the order of centuries (>>100 years). CCU only has 
positive climate impact if it enables a higher amount of low carbon input (solar, wind, etc.) 
to the system than without CCU. If electricity can be used in the system as electricity, the 
efficiency is far better than going through a CCU cycle, and less input to the entire system 
is needed. This means, that it is more effective to replace fossil electricity with the new 
renewable electricity than to use it in other sectors via CCU with lower cyclic efficiency. 
When low carbon electricity cannot be absorbed by the system (where the electricity 
sector is more or less decarbonised), CCU can act as a means to indirectly electrify the 
system in addition to serving as a means for energy storage, if that is required to balance 
the electricity generation and demand. This means that CCU itself is not a means to lower 
GHG emissions. It can be a tool to decarbonise the input to the system, which indirectly 
(by replacement) lowers GHG emissions. Whether this leaves more oil in the ground, and 
in that case how much, determines the impact of CCU on climate change.
Why do we need Bio-CCUS?
Paris Agreement and climate change
A business as usual projection of the current energy consumption trends indicates 
a cumulative CO2 emission of 4,200 Gt until the end of the century. This translates into 
a global temperature increase of up to 3-4.5°C. Already at 1.5°C global temperature rise 
there is a risk of climate change affecting unique biodiversity systems and causing weather 
extremes. With an increase in global temperature of 3°C or higher these risks escalate, leading 
to higher local and global risk and more extreme effects in terms of large scale disruption.
Currently 174 of 197 parties to the convention have ratified the Paris Agreement. The 
agreement entered into force in November 2016. The main intention of the agreement is to 
unite all nations in a joint effort to mitigate climate change. The primary method to achieve 
this is to limit the global temperature increase to “well below 2°C above pre-industrial 
levels and to pursue efforts to limit the temperature increase even further to 1.5°C [1].” 
The goal of limiting the global temperature increase will be met through following up on 
national implementation efforts and contributions to achieve the purpose of the agreement.
6
Carbon budget and emission scenarios
With the successful ratification of the Paris Agreement we are taking another important 
step towards reducing greenhouse gas emissions and mitigating climate change. However, 
we do face challenges ahead. The cumulative CO2 emissions from the latter half of the last 
century until the present have consumed a large share of the carbon budget available when 
aiming at a 2°C limitation in global temperature increase.
The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) [2] has estimated that in 
order to stay below 2°C we have around 1,000 – 1,600 Gt left in the carbon budget. 
This corresponds to a CO2eq. concentration of 450-500 ppm in 2100. At a concentration 
of less than 500 ppm the IPCC considers it likely that we can stay below 2°C over the 21st 
century. For comparison, the probability of restricting the global temperature increase by 
1.5°C is already small, and limited to an atmospheric concentration of CO2 of a maximum 
of 450 ppm. As a direct result of the Paris Agreement the IPCC is currently preparing a 
special report on the impacts of global warming of 1.5°C above pre-industrial levels and 
related global greenhouse gas pathways. The report is expected to be published in 2018.
Currently, there is no one single technology that can stop and possibly reverse the effects 
of increased CO2 concentrations in the atmosphere. Nevertheless, bioenergy and negative 
CO2 emissions represent a possible mitigation tool. The IPCC and the IEA identify CCS as 
a significant climate mitigation tool. Bio-CCS plays an important role in the CCS portfolio, 
both as a technology that can extract CO2 from the atmosphere and as a market tool that 
can promote large-scale commercialisation of CCS. Bio-CCS is considered to be a crucial 
factor to limit the global temperature increase to 1.5°C, and scenarios without Bio-
CCS options tend not to achieve this target or else offer solutions that will be extremely 
expensive.
Numerous emission projection scenarios have been developed in an attempt to forecast the 
CO2 emissions in the future. Most of these scenarios are in agreement, recognising the tight 
carbon budget for achieving a 2°C limitation of global temperature increase. The majority 
of the scenarios incorporate negative emissions and typically consist of four distinct 
phases; (I) emission peak around 2020-2030, (II) steep emission reductions from 2030-
2060, (III) carbon neutrality from 2060-2080, and (IV) zero or negative emissions from 
2080. In addition, most scenarios showing a 2°C limitation that include negative emissions 
allow for overshooting the carbon budget in mid-century and subsequently using negative 
emissions to return to the carbon budget limit, see Figure 1 [3].
7
Figure 3. CO2 emission pathways and remaining carbon budget. Figure from van Vuuren [3], 
based on data from the IPCC AR5 database.
The last few years have seen a radical transformation in the global energy market, 
especially in terms of electricity demand. Renewable energy sources continue to penetrate 
the electricity market. In 2016 alone half of the growth in global electricity demand was 
supplied by renewable electricity and the sales of electric cars increased by 40%. The 
energy sector is currently the largest overall source of greenhouse gas emissions, being 
responsible for 60 – 70% of total global GHG emissions.
The IEA has previously developed a series of scenarios outlining alternative energy 
system pathways, including different emission trajectories, in an attempt to predict the 
resulting average global temperature increase. In the scenario simulations various energy 
technologies have been optimised in order to predict the potential of driving down CO2 
emissions while simultaneously providing sufficient energy services to society.
Traditionally the 2°C Scenario (2DS) has been the main focus, depicting the energy 
system deployment consistent with limiting the temperature increase to 2°C. Achieving 
the 2DS restricts the total cumulative global energy-related CO2 emissions to 1,000 Gt 
by 2100. This includes reducing CO2 emissions by up to 60% (compared with 2013) by 
2050. The total global CO2 emissions in 2013 were approximately 32 Gt, which translates 
into a reduction in CO2 emissions the next roughly 30 years of more than 19 Gt CO2, or 
more than 0.5 Gt per year starting immediately (IEA, 2016). This number, which is just 
below 2% of the total annual CO2 emissions may seem low, and reaching the 2DS is 
still technically possible, provided that the reductions start immediately. This time scale 
poses challenges. Even though the energy system is transforming quickly the increased 
penetration of renewable energy into the energy system will most probably not be able 
to make up for this reduction in such a short time frame.
8
In the recently published Energy Technologies Perspectives 2017 (IEA, 2017) the IEA 
takes a new approach towards the scenario development. The new baseline scenario, the 
Reference Technology Scenario (RTS), takes into account the pledges made in the Paris 
Agreement. In the new RTP, CO2 emissions will continue to increase towards 2040 and 
somewhat beyond, but by 2050 the emission trajectory will even out. The new 2DS is 
still central to the future projections. The 2DS optimises the energy system to cut the 
CO2 emissions to less than 1/3 of today by 2060. In addition, the modelling horizon has 
been extended from 2050 to 2060. As illustrated in Figure 1, the major CO2 emission 
reduction options in the 2DS consist of energy efficiency and renewable energy, these 
together providing 75% of the CO2 emission reduction. CCS accounts for 14%, which is an 
increase from the previous edition of the 2DS where CCS contributed 12% of the emission 
reduction (IEA [a], 2016). CO2 capture from both the power sector and industrial sectors 
are included in the CCS technology area, including also BECCS and Bio-CCS.
Figure 4. Updated IEA 2°C Scenario in Energy Technology Perspectives 2017.
The new ETP also presents a new, additional scenario; Beyond 2°C Scenario (B2DS). 
This scenario is more ambitious than the 2DS. In the B2DS all the available technologies 
are exploited to the maximum practical limit. The realisation of the B2DS would allow 
for a CO2 neutral energy sector by 2060. Also in the B2DS the main technology areas 
include energy efficiency and renewable energies, totalling almost half of the contribution 
needed. However, the shares of both energy efficiency and renewable energies decline in 
the B2DS. The reason is that in the 2DS there are still CO2 emissions being released to the 
atmosphere as the reduction potential of the abatement technologies in the 2DS are not 
pushed to the limit as in the B2DS. In the 2DS the less expensive technology areas have 
been applied first, which results in the renewable energy option being the best option. The 
B2DS exhibits a more significant reduction pathway, exploring alternatives that were too 
challenging and complex for the 2DS, such as CCS from industrial sectors like cement 
production and iron and steel production. As a result, the role of CCS as an emission 
reduction technology becomes much more important in the B2DS.
9
Figure 5 The IEA Beyond 2°C Scenario in Energy Technology Perspectives 2017.
Bio-CCS is included in the IEA scenarios. Negative emissions have two principal roles;
• Compensate for residual emissions in sectors where direct mitigation is difficult 
or cost-prohibitive, and
• Counterbalance near-term carbon budget “overshoot”, which increases with 
more ambitious reduction targets
According to the IEA, negative emissions are needed in order to achieve net-zero emissions 
by 2060. In the 2DS negative emissions start to contribute before 2020, while in the B2DS 
negative emissions will be effective already at present. Both power production and biofuel 
production (other transformation) play an important role in achieving negative emissions, 
especially in the B2DS. The cumulative negative emissions of these two sectors amount to 
70-75 Gt. This translates into a power production coefficient of -10 g CO2/kWh in 2060, 
which will be an important measure for removing CO2 from the atmosphere.
Figure 6 Negative emissions in IEA scenarios.
10
The implementation of Bio-CCS and negative emissions is not on track to realise the 
emission reductions required in order to meet the 2DS or B2DS targets, mainly as a result 
of the absence of policy incentives. The implementation of Bio-CCS combines challenges 
from two already challenging sectors; the biomass sector demanding sustainable bioenergy 
feedstock and the CCS sector where infrastructure could pose a major obstacle, especially 
for small bioenergy installations that have no possibility for developing CCS infrastructure.
Sustainability of Bio-CCS
The negative emission potential of Bio-CCS is not clear-cut and it remains critical to 
look at the sustainability of biomass utilisation. Sustainability issues regarding the use 
of biomass are related to social, environmental and economic factors.
Water, energy, carbon and land are all factors that need to be taken into consideration 
when accounting for the sustainability of Bio-CCS. Different types of biomass and crops 
can represent large variations in footprint, depending on yields and fertiliser input. The 
use of biomass involves the potential for direct and indirect land use changes. Direct land 
use change is a result of, for instance, clearing of land and is directly tied to the type of 
land being utilised for bioenergy production. Implementing CCS in, for instance, biofuel 
production requires energy, and the emissions from this energy production may be just as 
high as in the original process. Implementing CCS in biomass-fired power plants will reduce 
their efficiency. In order to replace this energy the total feedstock rate to the plant increases 
and the result may not be as negative as first imagined. The situation is illustrated in Figure 
7 where two different combined heat and oxy-CFB power plants with CCS were compared 
to a power plant operated with fossil fuel. In CCS1 the parasitic load caused by the CCS 
plant has been replaced with electricity produced with coal, and in CCS2 with electricity 
produced based on the Finnish average, which has a lower emission factor.
Figure 7. Example of GHG impact from Bio-CCS
11
It is fundamental for net negative CO2 emissions from Bio-CCS systems that the 
biomass utilised has been grown and harvested in a sustainable manner. Emissions 
induced as a result of land use changes (direct or indirect) during production of biomass 
for bioenergy can render the negative emissions from Bio-CCS smaller than the total 
net CO2 capture. Furthermore, in relation to slow rotation biomass (e.g. forests), it is 
important to understand the ongoing scientific debate on the climate impacts. The CO2 
released in combustion of slow rotation biomass will spend some time in the atmosphere 
before being sequestered back to growing plants. During this period in the atmosphere the 
CO2 will have a warming effect. As a consequence of this temporal scale, it could be argued 
that the net negative emission effect is not immediate, but will only be achieved once the 
carbon is fixed in the biomass again, see Figure 8.
Figure 8 Carbon sequestration over time
The carbon breakeven time, or the time required for the system to reach carbon neutrality, 
depends on land type and crop type and can vary significantly. On average, the carbon 
breakeven time for energy crops is around 4-30 years.
Another important issue is the so called foregone carbon sequestration, meaning the 
lower carbon sequestration of forests in intensive harvesting scenarios compared to less 
intensive harvests. From an atmospheric point of view, this lost carbon sequestration can 
be considered similar to carbon emissions and the resulting impact could be attributed 
to the products produced from biomass. The use of residual biomass is often considered 
sustainable and the best option for the climate as the residues could otherwise decay 
quite rapidly and release the carbon anyway. The situation is illustrated in Figure 9.
12
Figure 9 The effect of additional wood harvesting on the carbon balance on landscape level
Biomass production, transport and processing also impact the carbon footprint of the 
biomass feedstock. In particular, the utilisation of nitrogen based fertilisers has a double 
impact on the carbon footprint, from both the CO2 released during the production of 
the chemical, and the emissions of N2O after application on the field. Direct land use 
changes (LUC) for cropland is moderate as this is typically low carbon debt land, but 
on the other hand the effect of indirect land use change (ILUC) for cropland on the 
carbon footprint can be significant. The carbon intensity of a power plant decreases with 
increased biomass co-firing and higher CO2 capture rates. However, this effect can be offset 
and even be carbon positive when accounting for the entire supply chain including LUC 
and ILUC. For instance, under certain supply chain conditions (high direct and indirect 
land use change, drying and pelletisation, long transport distance) 50% co-firing of a 
woody biomass such as willow will no longer be a carbon negative option. This serves to 
underscore the importance of a thorough, case-by-case assessment of BECCS projects [4].
To illustrate the effect of an optimistic scenario of Bio-CCS on land use and fresh water 
consumption the sequestration of 50 Mt CO2/a would require 0.05–2 Mha land annually, 
7–150 billion m3 water (compared to the total agricultural withdrawal of water in Europe 
of 334 billion m3) and between 11 and 223 x 500 MW Bio-CCS units. The total land use 
required for limiting the global temperature warming to 2°C is estimated at 500 Mha for 
growing bioenergy. Currently, around 4,500 Mha is used for food production [5].
Biomass potential is a key question when discussing Bio-CCS. An analysis of the amount 
of biomass required after 2050 in the different IPCC scenarios ranges from 25 EJ/a 
up to more than 350 EJ/a. Utilisation of primary energy for bioenergy purposes may be 
sustainable up to 100 EJ/a. Higher rates of primary energy utilisation may interfere with 
forestry and farm land and we might see a need for changes, and above 300 EJ/a there 
might even be potential for conflict. This begs the question whether the planet can sustain 
a society based on 50% or more bioenergy, taking into account the growing population on 
earth, and whether it is realistic to use as much biomass as some of the scenario models 
suggest. Adding to the utilisation of biomass is the final storage of captured CO2. A quick 
calculation shows that even for a moderate Bio-CCS scenario the number of wells can 
amount up to 10,000.
13
Role of Bio-CCUS
Bio-CCS does not allow us to peak later
Without social acceptance there are few incentive mechanisms to drive the development 
of Bio-CCS. A general misunderstanding among the public is that Bio-CCS and the 
production of energy crops is competing for land and resources with food production and 
forest development. There is also a perception that especially Bio-CCS could even prevent 
large scale implementation of renewable energy. Another critical misconception is that Bio-
CCS offers a possibility for using negative emissions as a delaying tactics or a quick fix for 
continuing business as usual. It is important to recognise that negative emissions are not 
a licence to continue the current trajectory. Negative emissions may offer the possibility 
to temporarily overshoot the carbon budget, but it is not a tool to postpone the time when 
we need to take action to reduce emissions. This impression is especially unfortunate if it 
reaches policy makers, who might oppose development of the technologies. The significant 
gap between the current situation and where we need to be in terms of climate mitigation 
changes requires additional emission reduction pathways as well. Bio-CCS has a key role 
in curbing CO2 emissions and can be an important remedy in a transition period towards 
cleaner renewable energy systems, but it is not the only means that should be included in 
the climate change mitigation toolbox.
Changing trends in carbon capture and electricity production
Recent years have seen a shift in carbon capture from carbon capture and storage 
(CCS) towards carbon capture and utilisation (CCU). This shift is driven by the lack 
of internationally binding agreements to significantly reduce CO2 emissions, including 
functional emission trading systems and emerging economic opportunities. In North 
America both fossil and biogenic CO2 is used for enhanced oil recovery (EOR) and 
development is driven by the demand side. Over several years the EOR business has 
supported the development of the CCS and CCU technologies, resulting in existing 
infrastructure such as pipeline systems that is vital to new investments. In Europe, on 
the other hand, the situation is radically different. CCS is for the most part a stranded 
discussion, except in Norway where the infrastructure for storage is to a large extent 
existing. Europe has abundant biomass resources and biogenic CO2 emissions. However, 
these facilities are often significantly smaller than the typical coal-fired power plants in 
North America providing CO2 for EOR. Since EOR is not a big business in Europe the 
European model is dependent on a situation where everything fits together in a business 
case. As a result, a more probable pathway for implementing bio-CC(U)S in Europe would 
be based on decentralised installations with isolated electricity and CO2 resources.
14
In addition to the economic driver, timing is another argument concerning the renewable 
electricity market. Much of the renewable electricity currently produced is concentrated 
far away from consumers. With production rates reaching several terawatts the lack 
of gridlines and suitable and sufficient electricity storage, electricity is in some cases 
produced in excess. This could be an advantage in the implementation of Bio-CCU 
technologies by transforming excess electricity into energy storage that can be easily 
transported to consumers. Another important driver is the end use; CO2 used as feedstock 
for fuels will have a larger demand than chemicals, materials and mineralisation.
Industrial implementation of (Bio-)CCUS under the current market conditions and policy 
scenarios will be expensive. However, changes in these conditions may facilitate large-scale 
implementation in certain sectors. These first movers in Europe will most probably be 
restricted to certain locations with ideal boundary conditions for businesses based on CO2 
capture. One important aspect to consider will be the supply of hydrogen. Several terawatts 
of excess hydrogen are currently combusted annually to produce heat and electricity. 
Investing in electrolysers to make use of the excess electricity and convert it back to 
hydrogen would not be feasible at the moment. As a result, industrial processes that 
today burn hydrogen or carbon monoxide, for instance in the steel industry and chemical 
industry, could be suitable first movers. Important features for scaling up the technologies 
will among other issues be the ability to manufacture large-scale key components such as 
electrolysers. Large scale production will drive down costs. Whether Bio-CC(U)S itself will 
drive implementation is another aspect. The oil and gas industry has been at the forefront 
concerning development of CCS for a long time, yet still fuel manufacturers who see a 
business possibility are thought to drive the implementation of Bio-CC(U)S in the short 
term. In the longer term, policies and regulations instigated by the growing urge to reduce 
emissions and even realise negative emissions would need to become the main driver for 
wide Bio-CC(U)S deployment.
Next steps for Bio-CCUS
The shift in the discussion from Bio-CCS to Bio-CCU is mainly based on development 
driven by industry, this being based on commercial interest. One major reason for this in 
Europe is the limitations of the EU ETS and the lack of recognition for negative (biogenic) 
CO2 emissions in the trading system. As a result, with the current low price of CO2 there is 
no incentive to invest in Bio-CCS.
Liquid fuels from CCU can replace oil derivatives in both light and heavy-duty transport. 
In addition, CO2-derived fuels could offer a dispatchable service to the grid in an energy 
system where the main renewable energy sources are intermittent. This enables a flexible 
grid system during high and low load periods. Liquid CO2-derived fuel also offers a 
sustainable alternative to for example the transport sector that is more resistant to change 
and where electrification is more challenging. However, economics is a major concern for 
Bio-CCS and Bio-CCU. In Bio-CCU the CO2-derived product can pay for the capture and 
for the CO2 avoidance cost, but the emission reduction potential is weaker than for Bio-
CCS as the CO2 used in Bio-CCU will in any case be emitted back to the atmosphere.
15
One key question is what the EU will do in terms of regulations that govern the use of 
CO2, and some of the open elements in the REDII will be a key factor in this development. 
In order for the industry to be able to create business cases from Bio-CCU the EU must 
incentivise production of sustainable fuels from CCU as they scale rapidly without side-
effects. How life-cycle analysis is applied to carbon capture and energy transformation 
is also a key to business models.
Bio-CCU is claimed to be an enabler for Bio-CCS, by setting the scene for industrial 
CO2 capture and providing infrastructure that can be further developed. However logical 
this assertion may sound, the reality is not quite that simple. Bio-CCU could probably 
contribute to increased understanding of industrial CO2 capture from biomass-based 
industries. On the other hand, permanent storage is one of the most prominent bottlenecks 
for Bio-CCS, and Bio-CCU would not facilitate the storage infrastructure that is needed 
for large scale Bio-CCS. Another point of debate with Bio-CCU in general and Bio-CCU 
as an enabler for Bio-CCS is the urgency in reducing emissions and mitigating climate 
change. It has been shown above that a reduction in emissions and realising negative 
emissions needs to start before long. As a consequence, there is no time to wait for Bio-
CCU to pave the way for Bio-CCS. Based on this, the latest shift in focus away from Bio-
CCS to Bio-CCU could be an unfortunate diversion from the real aim – to mitigate climate 
change.
Conclusions
As the potential of Bio-CC(U)S is very much bound to the availability and usage of 
biomass raw materials, the sustainability of the raw materials is of the essence. The current 
biomass flows and potentials set the initial limits for the wider deployment of Bio-CC(U)
S. Efficient utilisation of constrained resources is an essential question, when the target 
is to optimise the impact at the system level, from the society point of view. One objective 
is to offer suggestions as to whether deployment really leads to the desired impact on the 
CO2 concentrations in the atmosphere. As biomass can be used in many ways, the primary 
purpose of utilisation and products containing biogenic carbon also add up to this. When 
biomass is utilised for products other than energy, the impact on the environment and 
economy differs. The opportunities with these solutions, realistic potential and the main 
threats related to Bio-CC(U)S need to be discussed in the light of sustainability and 
economic potential.
16
Concepts and terms such as CCU, CCS, Bio-CCU and Bio-CCS are used interchangeably, 
sometimes incorrectly, in general discussion and therefore need clarification. The 
justifications of technologies differ. If the driver is GHG emission reduction, only storage 
can result in the removal of CO2 from the atmosphere on a life cycle basis. The average 
lifetime of utilisation products is in the order of 6 years (less than a year for fuels). In 
order to have a direct climate mitigation impact, the carbon molecule would need to be 
isolated from the atmosphere for at least ~100 years. Hence, the only GHG impact CCU 
can provide is indirect. This means that if applying CCU technology would leave more 
fossil resources underground than without CCU, or if more sustainable energy input to 
the system is generated than without CCU, CCU will be positive from the climate change 
mitigation perspective. If the electricity system is more or less decarbonised, a significant 
role for CCU can be in balancing the intermittent nature of some renewable energy sources 
(RES) and in indirectly electrifying other, more hydrocarbon dependent sectors.
In order to be able to invest in and realise Bio-CCS and negative emissions, some major 
prerequisites include: Policy instruments and market conditions: Accounting for negative 
emissions in emission trading systems (Bio-CCS), or otherwise enabling the development 
of business cases (Bio-CCU). These will be indispensable for industries to invest in carbon 
negative technologies

I n t e r n a t i o n a l  E n e r gy  A g e n cy
The International Energy Agency (IEA) is an autonomous organisation which works to 
ensure reliable, affordable and clean energy for its 29 Member Countries and beyond. Founded 
in response to the 1973-74 oil crisis, the IEA’s initial role was to help countries co-ordinate a 
collective response to major disruptions in oil supply through the release of emergency oil stocks 
to the markets. While this continues to be a key aspect of its work, the IEA has evolved and 
expanded. It is at the heart of global dialogue on energy, providing authoritative and unbiased 
research, statistics, analysis and recommendations. Today, the IEA’s four main areas of focus are:
• Energy security: Promoting diversity, efficiency, flexibility and reliability for all fuels 
and energy sources;
• Economic development: Supporting free markets to foster economic growth and eliminate 
energy poverty;
• Environmental awareness: Analysing policy options to offset the impact of energy production 
and use on the environment, especially for tackling climate change and air pollution; and
• Engagement worldwide: Working closely with partner countries, especially major 
emerging economies, to find solutions to shared energy and environmental concerns.
Objectives
• Secure member countries’ access to reliable and ample supplies of all forms of energy; 
in particular, through maintaining effective emergency response capabilities in case of 
oil supply disruptions.
• Promote sustainable energy policies that spur economic growth and environmental 
protection in a global context – particularly in terms of reducing greenhouse-gas 
emissions that contribute to climate change.
• Improve transparency of international markets through collection and analysis of energy data.
• Support global collaboration on energy technology to secure future energy supplies and 
mitigate their environmental impact, including through improved energy efficiency and 
development and deployment of low-carbon technologies.
• Find solutions to global energy challenges through engagement and dialogue with 
non-member countries, industry, international organisations and other stakeholders.
Organisation
The IEA is an autonomous agency based in Paris. The main decision-making body is the Governing 
Board, composed of energy ministers from each Member Country or their senior representatives. 
A Secretariat, with a staff of energy experts recruited on a competitive basis primarily from 
OECD Member Countries, supports the work of the Governing Board and subordinate bodies. The 
Secretariat is headed by an Executive Director appointed by the Governing Board. The Secretariat 
collects and analyses energy data, organises high-level workshops with world experts on new 
topics and themes, assesses Member and non-Member Countries’ domestic energy policies and 
programmes, makes global energy projections based on differing scenarios, and prepares studies 
and concrete policy recommendations for governments on key energy topics.
Members
Australia, Austria, Belgium, Canada, the Czech Republic, Denmark, Estonia, Finland, France, Germany, 
Greece, Hungary, Ireland, Italy, Japan, Korea, Luxembourg, the Netherlands, New Zealand, Norway, 
Poland, Portugal, the Slovak Republic, Spain, Sweden, Switzerland, Turkey, the United Kingdom 
and the USA. The European Commission also participates in the work of the IEA.

Introducing IEA Bioenergy
Welcome to this Annual Report for 2017 from IEA Bioenergy.
IEA Bioenergy is the short name for the international bioenergy collaboration under the 
auspices of the International Energy Agency – IEA. A brief description of the IEA is given 
on the preceding page.
Bioenergy is energy derived from biomass. Biomass is defined as material which is directly or 
indirectly produced by photosynthesis and which is utilised as a feedstock in the manufacture 
of fuels and substitutes for petrochemical and other energy intensive products. Organic waste 
from forestry and agriculture, and municipal solid waste are also included in the collaborative 
research, as well as broader ‘cross-cutting studies’ on techno-economic aspects, environmental 
and economic sustainability, systems analysis, bioenergy trade, fuel standards, greenhouse gas 
balances, barriers to deployment, and management decision support systems.
The IEA Technology Collaboration Programme (TCP) on Bioenergy, which is the ‘umbrella 
agreement’ under which the collaboration takes place, was originally signed in 1978 as IEA 
Forestry Energy. A handful of countries took part in the collaboration from the beginning. In 
1986 it broadened its scope to become IEA Bioenergy and to include non-forestry bioenergy 
in the scope of the work. The number of participating countries has increased during the 
years as a result of the steadily increasing interest in bioenergy worldwide. By the end of 
2017, 23 parties participated in IEA Bioenergy: Australia, Austria, Belgium, Brazil, Canada, 
Croatia, Denmark, Finland, France, Germany, Ireland, Italy, Japan, the Republic of Korea, the 
Netherlands, New Zealand, Norway, South Africa, Sweden, Switzerland, the United Kingdom, 
the USA, and the European Commission.
IEA Bioenergy is now 40 years old and is a well-established collaborative agreement. All 
OECD countries with significant national bioenergy programmes are now participating in 
IEA Bioenergy, with very few exceptions. The IEA Governing Board has decided that the 
Technology Collaboration Programmes may be open to non-Member Countries, i.e., for 
countries that are not Members of the OECD. For IEA Bioenergy, this has resulted in a 
number of enquiries from potential participants, and as a consequence new Members are 
expected. Three non-Member Countries currently participate in IEA Bioenergy – Brazil, 
Croatia, and South Africa.
The work within IEA Bioenergy is structured in a number of Tasks, which have well defined 
objectives, budgets, and time frames. The collaboration which earlier was focused on Research, 
Development and Demonstration is now increasingly also emphasising Deployment on a large-
scale and worldwide. There were 11 ongoing Tasks during 2017:
• Task 32: Biomass Combustion and Co-firing
• Task 33: Gasification of Biomass and Waste
20
• Task 34: Direct Thermochemical Liquefaction
• Task 36: Integrating Energy Recovery into Solid Waste Management Systems
• Task 37: Energy from Biogas
• Task 38: Climate Change Effects of Biomass and Bioenergy Systems
• Task 39: Commercialising of Conventional and Advanced Liquid Biofuels 
from Biomass
• Task 40: Sustainable Biomass Markets and International Bioenergy Trade 
to Support the Biobased Economy
• Task 41: Bioenergy Systems Analysis
• Task 42: Biorefining in a Future BioEconomy
• Task 43: Biomass Feedstocks for Energy Markets
Members of IEA Bioenergy are invited to participate in all of the Tasks, but each Member 
is free to limit its participation to those Tasks which have a programme of special interest. 
The Task participation during 2017 is shown in Appendix 1.
A progress report for IEA Bioenergy for the year 2017 is given in Sections 1 and 2 of this 
Annual Report.

Progress Report
1. THE EXECUTIVE COMMITTEE
Introduction and Meetings
The Executive Committee (ExCo) acts as the ‘board of directors’ of IEA Bioenergy. 
The committee plans for the future, appoints persons to do the work, approves the budget, 
and, through its Members, raises the money to fund the programmes and administer the 
Agreement. The Executive Committee also scrutinises and approves the programmes of work, 
progress reports, and accounts from the various Tasks within IEA Bioenergy. Other functions 
of the ExCo include publication of an Annual Report, production of newsletters and webinars, 
and maintenance of the IEA Bioenergy website. In addition the ExCo produces technical and 
policy-support documents, and organises workshops and study tours for the Member Country 
participants.
The 79th ExCo meeting took place in Gothenburg, Sweden on 16-18 May with 43 
participants. The 80th ExCo meeting was held in Baden, Switzerland on 18-20 October and 
there were 30 participants. Simone Landolina represented IEA Headquarters at ExCo80.
Kees Kwant of The Netherlands chaired both ExCo meetings in 2017 with Jim Spaeth of the 
USA in the role of Vice-chair. At ExCo80, Jim Spaeth was elected as Chair and Paul Bennett 
of New Zealand was elected as Vice-chair for 2018.
Secretariat
The ExCo Secretariat is currently based in Dublin, Ireland under the Secretary, 
Pearse Buckley. The fund administration for the ExCo Secretariat Fund and Task 
funds is consolidated with the Secretariat, along with production of ExCo publications 
and newsletters, and maintenance of the website.
The contact details for the Executive Committee can be found in Appendix 7 and 
for the Secretariat on the back cover of this report. The work of the ExCo, with some 
of the achievements and issues during 2017, is described below.
22
Implementing Agreement
The current term of the IEA Bioenergy Technology Collaboration Programme (TCP) ends 
on the 29th February 2020.
Contracting Parties/New Participants
A complete list of the Contracting Parties to IEA Bioenergy is included in Appendix 3.
Estonia has still to formally sign the Agreement and this is expected to happen early in 2018. 
There are ongoing discussions with China, India, Mexico, and Poland with a view to engaging 
them in IEA Bioenergy.
Supervision of Ongoing Tasks, Review and Evaluation
The progress of the work in the Tasks is reported to the Executive Committee twice per year 
at the ExCo meetings. The ExCo has continued its policy to invite Task Leaders to each ExCo 
meeting so that they can make presentations on the progress in their Task and programme of 
work personally. This has improved the communication between the Tasks and the Executive 
Committee and has also increased the engagement of the ExCo with the Task programmes.
The work within IEA Bioenergy is regularly evaluated by the IEA Committee for Energy 
Research and Technology (CERT) via its Renewable Energy Working Party (REWP) and 
is reported to the IEA Governing Board.
Approval of Task and Secretariat Budgets
The budgets for 2017 approved by the Executive Committee for the ExCo Secretariat Fund 
and for the Tasks are shown in Appendix 2. Total funds invoiced in 2017 were US$1,775,200, 
comprising US$253,100 of ExCo funds and US$1,522,100 of Task funds. Appendix 2 also 
shows the financial contributions made by each Member Country and the contributions to 
each Task. Very substantial ‘in-kind’ contributions are also a feature of the IEA Bioenergy 
collaboration but these are not shown because they are more difficult to recognise in 
financial terms.
23
Fund Administration
The International Energy Agency, Bioenergy Trust Account, at the Bank of Ireland Global 
Markets in Dublin is working well. The Trust Account consists of a Call Deposit account and 
a Fixed Deposit account both of which bear interest. The Call Deposit account is accessed 
electronically while the Fixed Deposit account is accessed through the Bank’s dealers. Both 
accounts are denominated in US dollars. The currency for the whole of IEA Bioenergy is US 
dollars. Details for making payments are provided with each invoice.
The main issues faced in fund administration are slow payments from some Member Countries 
and fluctuations in exchange rates. As of 31 December 2017, there was US$77,200 of 
Member Country contributions outstanding.
At ExCo78, unanimous approval was given to the appointment of KPMG, Dublin as 
independent auditor for the ExCo Secretariat Fund until 31 December 2018. The audited 
accounts for the ExCo Secretariat Fund for 2016 were approved at ExCo79.
The Tasks also produce audited accounts. These are prepared according to guidelines specified 
by the ExCo. The accounts for the Tasks for 2016 were approved at ExCo79, except for Tasks 
38. The accounts for Task 38 were approved at ExCo80.
The audited accounts for the ExCo Secretariat Fund for the period ended 31 December 2017 
have been prepared and these will be presented for approval at ExCo81 in Ottawa.
Task Administration and Development
Task Participation
In 2017 there were 99 participations in 10 Tasks. Please see Appendix 1 on page 107 for a 
summary of Task Participation.
There were four active projects under Task 41 and three Inter-Task projects in 2017 – see 
below under ‘Strategic Fund/Strategic Outputs’.
Strategic Planning and Strategic Initiatives
Strategic Plan
The Strategic Plan 2015-2020 continues to be the guiding document for the IEA Bioenergy 
work programme. Work on a new strategic plan for the period 2020-2025 is set to begin and 
in view of this the Executive Committee approved a working group at ExCo80 in Baden.
24
Technical Coordinator
During 2017, the Technical Coordinator continued with his work of facilitating increased 
collaboration between the Tasks. In this context he has attended a number of Task meetings 
and associated conferences. He has maintained an updated schedule of deliverables and 
worked with the Task Leaders to achieve deadlines. He has also continued to organise the 
webinars, which have become an important forum for dissemination of IEA Boenergy outputs. 
The Technical Coordinator has played a key role in the organisation of ExCo workshops 
at ExCo79 (in conjunction with the IEA IETS TCP) and ExCo80 (external workshop in 
conjunction with the Swiss Federal Office of Energy). In particular, prior to the ExCo80 
internal workshop in preparation for the new triennium, he organised a survey of the broad 
stakeholder community to inform the workshop discussions. He has been very active in 
engagement with IEA Headquarters and with other international organisations including 
FAO, IRENA, GBEP, Biofuture Platform, Mission Innovation and SEforALL. The Technical 
Coordinator was a contributor to the Technology Roadmap: Delivering Sustainable Bioenergy, 
which was produced by the IEA in collaboration with IEA Bioenergy in 2017.
Communication Strategy
Communications is an important part of IEA Bioenergy activity and the Executive 
Committee has maintained its focus on the communication strategy through the work of 
the Communications’ Team. Some of the outcomes are presented here. The Twitter following 
has continued to increase steadily and the Communications Team has continued to consider 
ways to further enhance this development. The use of webinars as a dissemination tool has 
continued with five webinars in 2017 – (i) Algae Bioenergy State of Technology review, (ii) 
The European wood pellet market for small scale heating, (iii) Bioenergy & grid balancing, 
(iv) Integrated Bioenergy Hybrids – Flexible Renewable Energy Solutions and (v) The 
Hotspots of the Global Wood Pellet Industry and Trade 2017. Two-page summaries of Task 
reports have been produced and uploaded to the website alongside the main reports. Another 
new feature that has been added to the website is the pro-active material, which has been 
uploaded under FAQ. The first topic covered under this dealt with the question “Is energy 
from woody biomass positive for the climate?” – see http://www.ieabioenergy.com/iea-
publications/faq/.
Strategic Fund/Strategic Outputs
At ExCo53 it was agreed that from 2005, 10% of Task budgets would be reserved for ExCo 
approved work. The idea was that these ‘Strategic Funds’ would be used to increase the policy-
relevant outputs of IEA Bioenergy.
25
Progress with strategic initiatives has continued. The summary and conclusions from the 
ExCo78 workshop ‘Drop-in biofuels for international marine and aviation markets’ has been 
published and can be download at http://www.ieabioenergy.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/
ExCo78-Drop-in-biofuels-for-marine-and-aviation-markets.pdf; the summary and conclusions 
from the ExCo79 workshop ‘The role of industrial biorefineries in a low-carbon economy’ 
has been published and can be downloaded at http://www.ieabioenergy.com/wp-content/

Task 41 Project 5: Bio-CCS/CCUS: This two-year project is continuing with a workshop 
on Market-driven future potential of Bio-CC(U)S in 2017. Summary reports for all the 
workshops are available at http://task41project5.ieabioenergy.com/publications/market-
driven-future-potential-bio-ccus/.
Task 41 Project 6: Bioenergy and Grid Storage: This project has been completed and the 
report has been published at http://www.ieabioenergy.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/IEA-
Bioenergy-Bioenergy-in-balancing-the-grid_master_FINAL-Revised-16.02.17.pdf.
Task 41 Project 7: Bioenergy RES Hybrids: This project has been completed and the report 
published at http://task41project7.ieabioenergy.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/IEA-
Bioenergy-RES-hybrids-FINAL-report.pdf.
Task 41 Project 8: Bioenergy Roadmap 2017: This collaborative project between IEA 
Bioenergy and IEA has been completed and the report has been published at http://www.iea.
org/publications/freepublications/publication/Technology_Roadmap_Delivering_Sustainable_
Bioenergy.pdf.
Inter-Task Project: Bioenergy Success Stories: The project template has been finalised and 
ten success stories have been selected and developed. It is expected that they will be published 
on the IEA Bioenergy website early in 2018.
Inter-Task Project: Measuring, governing and gaining support for sustainable bioenergy 
supply chains: In 2017, the project (http://itp-sustainable.ieabioenergy.com/) achieved 
a number of important goals, including the publication of a series of peer reviewed papers 
and case studies. The case studies included one looking at biogas production in Germany 
and another on forestry, linking measurement and governance. An international workshop 
was held in Gothenburg in May 2017 and a 40-page workshop summary has been published 
and is available at http://itp-sustainable.ieabioenergy.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/
Intertasks-Sustainability.-Workshop-summary-05.12.2017.pdf. The project has an upcoming 
workshop in Copenhagen in April 2018 on the topic “Governing sustainability of bioenergy, 
biomaterial and bioporduct supply chains from forest and agricultural landscapes” – 
http://www.ieabioenergy.com/ieaevent/governing-sustainability-of-bioenergy-biomaterial-and-
bioproduct-supply-chains-from-forest-and-agricultural-landscapes/.
26
Inter-Task Project: Fuel pre-treatment of biomass residues in the supply chain for thermal 
conversion: The goal of the project (http://itp-fueltreatment.ieabioenergy.com/) is to expand 
the biomass resource base. It seeks to demonstrate this with examples. The structure of six 
case studies has been agreed. It has been decided that the proposed fourth case study on 
torrefaction for dry liquefaction was not suitable and this has been replaced with a case study 
on leaching of herbaceous biomass. All six case studies are nearing completion, after which 
the policy report and pre-treatment database will be produced. The project is expected to 
finish in the second quarter of 2018.
ExCo Workshops
At ExCo79 in May a successful workshop was held on the topic of ‘The role of industrial 
biorefineries in a low-carbon economy’. This workshop was organised in collaboration with 
the IEA Industrial Energy-Related Technologies and Systems (IETS) TCP. In October at 
ExCo80 a successful workshop on the topic of ‘Bioenergy grid integration’ was organised 
in collaboration with the Swiss Federal Office of Energy.
Seminars, Workshops, and Conference Sessions
A large number of seminars, workshops, and conference sessions are arranged every year 
by individual Tasks within IEA Bioenergy. This facilitates effective exchange of information 
between the participants and information transfer to stakeholders. These meetings are 
described in the progress reports from the Tasks later in this Annual report. The papers 
presented at some of these meetings are listed in Appendix 4. Examples of this outreach are:
• Task 33 organised a workshop on “Fluidized Bed Conversion of Biomass and Waste” 
in Skive, Denmark in October 2017 together with IEA-FBC (Fluidized Bed Conversion) 
TCP
• Task 38 organised a workshop on “Climate impacts of bioenergy systems” 
in Gothenburg, Sweden in May 2017 together with Chalmers University
• Task 43 organised a joint seminar on “From resource to sustainable business” 
with Grebe project (Interreg-EU) in Joensuu, Finland in February 2017.
Collaboration with International Organisations and Implementing Agreements
Advanced Motor Fuels Implementing Agreement
IEA Bioenergy and the Advanced Motor Fuels (AMF) Technology Collaboration Programme 
continue to maintain close communications. This is facilitated, particularly through the work 
of Task 39 which can often be linked to AMF activities. The work programmes of the two 
TCPs are reviewed regularly to identify opportunities for collaboration.
27
GBEP
The collaboration in the framework of GBEP Activity Group 6 has been completed 
and included the joint report Examples of Positive Bioenergy and Water Relationships 
- see http://www.globalbioenergy.org/fileadmin/user_upload/gbep/docs/2015_events/
AG6_workshop_25-26_August_2015/AG6_Examples_of_Positive_Bioenergy_and_Water_
Relationships_Final.pdf. Two new activity groups – ‘Activity Group 7 – Biogas’ and ‘Activity 
Group 8 Advanced Biofuels’ – are being developed by GBEP and IEA Bioenergy is considering 
opportunities to collaborate in these areas.
FAO
The collaboration with FAO under the MoU signed in 2000 is continuing with discussions 
on areas for collaboration.
IRENA
The collaboration with IRENA is continuing with both organisations reviewing outputs 
from each other’s work programmes and regularly monitoring opportunities for potential 
cooperation.
SEforALL
IEA Bioenergy is collaborating with SEforALL on the Biofuels Below 50 Initiative through 
Task 39. Other areas are being examined including resource work that would involve Task 43.
Biofuture Platform/Mission Innovation
IEA Bioenergy has ongoing discussions with both the Biofuture Platform and Mission 
Innovation to investigate appropriate collaboration. The Technology Roadmap: Delivering 
Sustainable Bioenergy was launched at a Mission Innovation meeting in Ottawa in November 
2017.
Promotion and Communication
The effective communication of IEA Bioenergy activities and information to stakeholders, in 
particular to decision makers, is a key priority of ExCo, which is re-emphasised in the new 
Strategic Plan 2015-2020. The wide range of promotional material available through the 
Secretariat includes Annual reports, technical brochures, copies of IEA Bioenergy news, the 
new Strategic Plan, strategic papers, and workshop proceedings. The IEA Bioenergy website 
is central to this publishing activity.
28
The 2016 Annual report included the special colour section on “Integrated bioenergy hybrids 
– Flexible renewable energy solutions ”. Some copies from the original print run of 600 
remain, with substantially increased distribution in electronic format.
The newsletter ‘IEA Bioenergy News’, which is distributed in June and December each year 
following the ExCo meetings, continues to be widely circulated. Two issues were published in 
2017. As a special theme the first issue featured bioenergy in Sweden and the second issue 
featured bioenergy in Switzerland. The newsletter is also produced in electronic format and 
is available from the IEA Bioenergy website. A single page electronic newsletter covering 
recent ExCo and Tasks’ activities was also produced and distributed at the end of March 
and September 2017. A free subscription to the Agreement newsletters is offered to all 
interested and there is a wide distribution outside of the normal IEA Bioenergy network.
Two contributions under the banner of ‘IEA Bioenergy Update’ were provided to the journal 
Biomass and Bioenergy in 2017 bringing the total to 63. This initiative provides excellent 
access to bioenergy researchers as the journal finds a place in major libraries worldwide.
Interaction with IEA Headquarters
There is continuing contact between the IEA Bioenergy Secretariat, and IEA Headquarters 
in Paris and active participation by ExCo representatives in relevant meetings. The 
Chairman, Technical Coordinator, Secretary, and key Task Leaders have worked closely 
with Headquarters staff at both administrative and technical levels. In 2017 the Technical 
Coordinator was involved with IEA Headquarters in the production of the Technology 
Roadmap: Delivering Sustainable Bioenergy. He has also reviewed the IEA Medium-Term

2. PROGRESS IN 2017 IN THE TASKS
TASK 32: Biomass Combustion and Co-firing
Overview of the Task
Task 32 aims to stimulate expansion of biomass combustion and co-firing for the production 
of heat and power on a wider scale. The widespread interest in the work of the Task illustrates 
the relevance of biomass combustion and co-firing in society. Combustion applications vary 
from domestic woodstoves to industrial combustion technologies, dedicated power generation 
and co-firing with conventional fossil fuels.
Biomass combustion technologies are commercially established with high availability and a 
multitude of options for integration with existing infrastructure on both large and small-scale 
levels. Nevertheless, there are still a number of challenges for further market introduction, 
the importance of which varies over time. The areas covered by the Task through different 
activities in the current triennium are:
• WP1. Decentralised heat production
• WP2. Efficient industrial combustion and CHP
• WP3. Near zero emissions from industrial combustion
• WP4. Co-firing and full conversion
• WP5. Low grade fuels and fuel pretreatment
• WP6. Climate impact of biomass combustion and bio-CCS
• WP7. Dissemination and outreach
The specific actions of Task 32 involve collecting, sharing, and analysing the policy aspects 
of results of international/national R&D programmes in the above areas. The results of 
these actions are disseminated in workshops, reports, handbooks, databases etc. In addition, 
a number of specifically designed, strategic actions are carried out by the Task to catalyse 
this process.
While most of the above areas are of a technical character, Task 32 also addresses non-
technical issues on fuel logistics and contracting, environmental constraints and legislation, 
public acceptance and financial incentives. An example is the policy report on renewable heat, 
which is currently being drafted.
Participating countries: Austria, Belgium, Canada, Denmark, Germany, Ireland, Italy, Japan, 
the Netherlands, Norway, South Africa, Sweden, and Switzerland.

Sub-Task Leader for Industrial Combustion: Claes Tullin, SP, Sweden
Sub-Task Leader for Small Scale Combustion: Thomas Nussbaumer, Verenum, 
Switzerland
Operating Agent: Ir Kees Kwant, NL Agency, the Netherlands
The Task Leader directs and manages the work programme, assisted by sub-task leaders 
for specific areas. A National Team Leader from each country is responsible for coordinating 
the national participation in the Task.
For further details on Task 32, please refer to Appendices 2, 4, 5 and 6; the Task website 
task32.ieabioenergy.com and the IEA Bioenergy website www.ieabioenergy.com under 
‘Our Work: Tasks’.
Progress in R&D
Task Meetings and Workshops
In 2017, the Task organised two internal meetings and two workshops. The internal meetings 
were used to monitor progress in different Task activities and plan and reflect on new Task 
activities. Another important aspect of the Task meetings is that actual developments on 
application of biomass combustion are shared amongst the member countries of the Task, 
thereby facilitating an important learning effect.
Workshops are a proven concept to gather and disseminate information in a structured 
and effective manner. Normally, invited speakers present the latest insights on one aspect 
of biomass combustion and/or co-firing, and thereby provide expert information for the 
participants. These workshops are usually organised in conjunction with high profile bioenergy 
conferences to attract as wide an audience as possible. The results of the workshops are 
reported and published on the Task website, and key results are fed back to both the Task 
participants and the ExCo for evaluation and further dissemination.
In Jan 2017, Task 32 organised a workshop as part of the Central European Biomass 
Conference in Graz, Austria on the topic of real life emissions from boilers and stoves. 
The workshop showed that the new load cycle methods that have been developed for 
logwood stoves and pellet boilers in the framework of recent research programmes, better 
reflect real life emissions than actual test methods. It was therefore concluded that efforts 
should be made together with industry and national governments, to introduce such methods.
32
In June 2017, Task 32 met at the European Biomass Conference in Stockholm. The meeting 
was combined with a field trip to the Mälarenergie WtE plant in Västerås. The site houses 
the largest waste fired CFB boiler in the world (130 MWth/50MWe), fuelled with about 
480 ktons of SRF produced from household waste annually.
In September 2017, Task 32 co-organised a workshop and associated field trip on ‘Biomass 
Co-firing and Full Conversion’ as an integral part of the Wood Pellets Association Conference 
in Ottawa, Canada. The workshop itself was attended by approx. 100 participants representing 
pellet production, power production, research and policy making. A number of recent, good 
examples on full biomass conversion were presented, such as the Atikokan and Thunder Bay 
plants by Ontario Power Generation. Shortly after the workshop these plants were also visited. 
The workshop and field trip illustrated that it is possible to fully convert a typical pulverised 
coal fired power plant to wood pellets or black pellets, and showed the consequences of these 
different approaches in terms of CAPEX, OPEX and operational performance. In the recent 
10-15 years, Task 32 has been addressing the opportunities for biomass co-firing, with or 
without thermal pretreatment, and is committed to continue doing so in the coming years.
Several other workshops will take place in this triennium. All workshop reports can be 
downloaded from the Task 32 website. Reports from internal Task meetings are available 
to member countries only, using login credentials.
Work Programme
The progress achieved during 2017 is shown below:
Technical report on particle emission measurement techniques for boilers and stoves
This report aims to summarise the opportunities of different particle emission measurement 
techniques and provide recommendations as to which method should be used in future. The 
report was delayed but will be endorsed at the next Task meeting (June 2018).
Policy paper with background report on the health impact of combustion aerosols
In June 2017 a policy paper with background report was published on emission factors 
and health related impacts of emissions from various biomass fired stoves and boilers. 
This is generally considered as one of the key issues related to small scale combustion. The 
report gives a clear overview on differences in emissions and health impacts between various 
combustion appliances. The policy paper, which provides an easy to read statement from Task 
32 on this topic, was published. A webinar was held on 22 March 2018 to further elaborate 
the content of the report.
33
Strategic study on the potential for renewable heat from biomass boilers, including options 
for optimal technical integration of biomass boilers with other renewable energy forms 
for heat (for policy makers and equipment manufacturers).
This study provides insights into how biomass can be optimally used to provide heat in the 
future energy system. It provides good examples of conducive policy cases that helped in 
realising relevant projects. The work is co-funded by the Swedish Energy Authority. The 
project will be finalised in 2018.
State of the art report on application of biomass combustion based CHP with case studies 
and identification and assessment of innovative developments (for potential end users)
This report will provide insight into the success factors for application of biomass CHP on the 
basis of actually built installations. It will also provide insight into new developments on small 
scale CHP technologies. The actual work started in 2017 and will be finalised in 2018.
Report on consequences of real life operation on boiler performance (efficiency and 
emissions (for policy makers)
This project recognises that the real life emissions from biomass boilers and stoves can be 
significantly higher when compared to optimal circumstances. The project evaluates new 
measurement methods for stoves and boilers through two separate reports for boilers and 
stoves (to be published in 2018). A workshop on the same topic was also held in Graz, Jan 
2017.
Workshop on options for co-firing in existing and new power plants (for power producers)
As part of the Wood Pellets Association Conference in Ottawa, Canada (Sept 2017), Task 32 
organised a session on biomass co-firing and full conversion. The workshop provided an update 
on recent developments in biomass co-firing in particularly in North America and Europe.
Review on the implication of high percentage co-firing on fly ash utilisation 
(for policy makers and traders)
This review provides an analysis of current uses of biomass ashes and provides 
recommendations for improved use. For various countries, analyses were performed in 2017. 
The report will be finalised in July 2018.
Updated co-firing database (for utilities)
This database contains information on coal fired power plants with experience in biomass co-
firing. As in other years, a number of records were updated or added in 2017.
34
Inter task project to evaluate the costs/benefits for fuel pretreatment of biomass residues 
in the supply chain for thermal conversion (with task 33, 34, 36, 40 and 43)
This is a project jointly carried out with Task 33, 34, 36, 40 and 43, under the guidance 
of Task 32. It consists of six case studies that describe how pretreatment of biomass can 
make the fuel supply chain more cost effective and efficient, or help to broaden the resource 
base. In addition, good examples of new companies converting biomass from one form to 
another will be included as a new database module in the existing IEA Bioenergy Technology 
database. In 2017, progress was made in the case studies. In 2018 these will be finalised, 
together with a policy synthesis report.
Website
The Task website (www.ieabioenergytask32.com) was relocated to http://task32.ieabioenergy.
com. It attracts about 4,000 visitors every month and is one of the key tools for information 
dissemination. Main products that are being downloaded from the website are publications 
and meeting reports, the database on experience with biomass co-firing in different power 
plants, and the databases on the composition of biomass and ash from actual combustion 
plants. The website is updated on a regular basis. Task participants and ExCo Members can 
obtain access to a secured section of the website which includes internal reports and work 
in progress.
Collaboration with Other Tasks/Networking
The Task collaborates directly with industry and through industrial networks such VGB 
Powertech. Within the IEA family, interaction is also solicited with other Bioenergy Tasks or 
other Technology Collaboration Programmes such as the IEA District Heating and Cooling 
TCP and the Clean Coal Centre. Market relevance is also enhanced by the active involvement 
of ExCo Members in the selection of Task participants, based on their national programmes. 
Several power companies are currently directly involved in the Task. Effective coordination is 
achieved through joint events, and the exchange of meeting minutes and reports.
Deliverables
The following milestones were achieved in 2017. Organising and minuting of two Task 
meetings. Organising and reporting of a workshop on “Practical test methods for small-
scale furnaces”; Organising and reporting of a workshop on “Biomass Co-firing and Full 
Conversion”; Publication of a report on ‘Aerosols from biomass combustion’, and a policy 
statement on ‘the need for reduction of particle emissions’. Further there was updating of 
the international overview of initiatives for biomass co-firing; and maintenance of the Task 
website. The Task also produced progress reports and audited accounts for the ExCo.
35
TASK 33: Gasification of Biomass and Waste
Overview of the Task
The objectives of Task 33 are (1) to promote commercialisation of biomass gasification, 
including gasification of waste, to produce fuel and synthesis gases that can be subsequently 
converted to substitutes for fossil fuel based energy products and chemicals, and lay 
the foundation for secure and sustainable energy supply; (2) to assist IEA Bioenergy 
Executive Committee activities in developing sustainable bioenergy strategies and policy 
recommendations by providing technical, economic, and sustainability information for 
biomass and waste gasification systems.
Participating countries: Austria, Denmark, Germany, Italy, The Netherlands, Norway, Sweden, 
Switzerland and USA.
Task Leader: Professor Kevin Whitty, University of Utah, USA
Operating Agent: Jim Spaeth, U.S. Department of Energy, USA
The Task Leader directs and manages the work program. A National Team Leader from 
each country is responsible for coordinating the national participation in the Task.
For further details on Task 33, please refer to Appendices 2, 4, 5 and 6; the Task website 
task33.ieabioenergy.com and the IEA Bioenergy website www.ieabioenergy.com under “Our 
Work:Tasks.”
Progress in R&D
Task Meetings and Workshops
The first Task 33 meeting for 2017 was held 2-4 May in Innsbruck, Austria and it was 
organised by Task 33 and Vienna University of Technology. MCI hosted the workshop. 
The task business meeting was held on the first day and a workshop entitled “Small scale 
gasification for CHP” was held on the second day. The third day included technical tours 
to the SynCraft industrial biomass gasification-based CHP system in Innsbruck and GE 
Jenbacher’s manufacturing facility in Jenbach.
The second Task 33 meeting was held 23-25 October 2017 in Skive, Denmark, by Task 33 
jointly with IEA FBC and was hosted by EA Energyanalyse. The Task business meeting was 
held during the first day and a workshop “Fluidized bed conversion of biomass and waste” was 
held the second day. Technical tours, on the third day, were conducted to the thermal biomass 
gasification plant in Skive and to the test centre for large wind turbines in Østerild, Denmark.
36
Both meetings and workshops were well attended and provided very good opportunities for 
valuable information exchange. All presentation can be found at the Task 33 website.
Work Scope, Approach and Industrial Involvement
The scope of work for the current triennium is built upon the progress made in the previous 
triennia. In the previous years, information exchange, investigation of selected sub-task 
studies, promotion of coordinated RD&D among participating countries, selected plant visits, 
and industrial involvement in technical workshops at Task meetings have been very effective. 
These remain the basic foundations for developing and implementing a program of work that 
addresses the needs of the participating countries.
Furthermore, the aim is to increase the number of countries participating in Task 33. 
Australia, Brazil, Canada, France, Japan, Spain and the UK, for example, are very active in 
thermal biomass gasification and their membership would be profitable for all participants.
The Task monitors the current status of key operations and R&D efforts relating to biomass 
and waste gasification, and identifies hurdles to advance further development, operational 
reliability, and economics of gasification systems. The Task meetings provide a forum to 
discuss the technological advances and issues critical to scale-up, system integration, and 
commercial implementation of these processes. These discussions lead to selection of sub-task 
studies and/or technical workshops that focus on advancing the state-of-the-art technology 
and identify the options to resolve barriers to technology commercialisation.
The Task has continued the practice of inviting industrial experts to the Task workshops 
to present their practical experiences and to discuss the options for development of critical 
process components to advance state-of-the-art biomass and waste gasification systems. The 
interaction with industry provides the opportunity for the National Team Leaders (NTLs) to 
evaluate refinements to existing product lines and/or processes. Academic experts are also 
invited to share information and foster cooperation in order to address and support basic 
research needs.
37

Observations from Workshop 1: Small scale gasification for CHP
The workshop took place in Innsbruck, Austria and was organised by IEA Bioenergy Task 33 
and Vienna University of Technology. The workshop, which focused on Small scale gasification 
for combined heat and power production, was hosted by MCI.
The workshop program was divided into following sessions:
Session I:
Small scale gasification for CHP – experience reports
Session II:
Byproducts from thermal gasification
The first session began with an overview of small scale gasification in Germany, Austria and 
Switzerland given by FEE, followed by an experience report given by Urbas. There were also 
innovative technologies presented during the workshop such as entrained flow gasification by 
MEVA, the WoodRoll technology by Cortus Energy, staged gasification by Ronda Engineering 
and early commercialisation plant by CMD Engine. An interesting presentation on utilisation 
of special gases with gas was given by a representative of GE Jenbacher.
The second session started with an overview on byproducts from thermal gasification 
such as bio-char and ash, which could be used as a valuable fertiliser. During this session, 
the technology of SynCraft was described as well as modular gasification of torrefied biomass 
by Torrgas. The quality of ash from thermal gasification of sewage sludge and biomass for use

All presentations as well as a summary workshop report can be found at the IEA Bioenergy 
Task 33 website (task33.ieabioenergy.com).
The site visits to SynCraft in Innsbruck and GE Jenbacher in Jenbach took place 
on the 4th May 2017.
SynCraft (www.syncraft.at) is a supplier of turn-key wood power plants based on floating bed 
gasification, it was founded in 2009. GE Jenbacher (www.ge.com) manufactures gas engines 
and cogeneration modules.
Observations from Workshop 2: Fluidized bed conversion of biomass and waste
Fluidised bed technology is well-suited for thermal processing of solid fuels such as biomass 
and waste. Combustion and gasification, in particular, are demonstrated technologies 
and today there are many commercial installations processing biomass-based feedstock 
in fluidised bed reactors. The following table offers an overview of the presentations 
given at the workshop.

41
The workshop on Fluidized Bed Conversion of Biomass and Waste was jointly organised by 
IEA Bioenergy Task 33 (Gasification of Biomass and Waste) and IEA-FBC (Fluidized Bed 
Conversion) and included 15 presentations from experts on R&D, implementation, challenges 
and successes of fluidised bed processing. Over 40 experts from 16 countries all over the 
world participated in the workshop. All the workshop presentations are available online 
at the Task 33 website and a workshop report will be published soon.
The participants of the workshop had a possibility to visit Skive gasification plant as well 
as Østerild – National Test Centre for Large Wind Turbines on the second day. The bubbling 
fluidised bed gasification plant in Skive was designed to utilise wood pellets and/or chips. 
The gasifier is operated at a maximum of 2 bar over pressure and temperature of 850°C. 
Air is used as a gasification medium and olivine as a fluidised bed material. The product 
gas generated has a heating value of about 5 MJ/kg. The Wind Test Centre Østerild, which 
is operated by DTU, was established with seven test stands during 2012 and allows for 
erection of wind turbines of up to 250 meters.
Website and database
The Task website (www.task33.ieabioenergy.com) is the most important tool for 
dissemination of information and results from this Task. Descriptions of the gasification 
process and a description of the Task including the contact data of national experts are 
provided. Within 2 weeks after each Task meeting, all presentations in PDF form (Country 
Reports, Workshop presentations) can be found on the Task website. The Minutes are posted 
on the member’s area of the website as soon as all Task members provide their feedback. The 
summaries of the workshops can be found on the website in a Report form.
A Google-map based interactive database of implementations of gasification plants has 
been incorporated into the Task website. At the moment, there are over 150 gasification 
facilities, mostly in member countries, registered in the database. The database is interactive, 
which means that the technology, type, and status of the gasifiers can be chosen to filter all 
the gasification facilities registered in the database. The possibility to filter also based on 
the feedstock/raw material was recently added to the database. The database is updated 
regularly and provides a good overview on gasifiers throughout the world.
In 2016 a status report on thermal biomass gasification in member countries was completed. 
The report includes the description of the technology, synthesis gas applications and a list 
of all biomass gasification facilities in member countries, which are active in the Task 33 
database. At the end of 2018/beginning of 2019 an update of the status report is planned.
42
Deliverables
The Task deliverables include planning and conducting two semi-annual Task meetings 
focused on the workshops selected by the Task participants, involving academic and industrial 
experts; the preparation and distribution of workshop reports and newsletter; updating 
and publishing country reports; conducting joint studies, conferences, and workshops with 
related Tasks, Annexes, and other international bodies to address mutually beneficial issues; 
and preparation of periodic progress, financial and annual reports as required by the IEA 
Bioenergy Executive Committee (ExCo).
TASK 34: Direct Thermochemical Liquefaction
Overview of the Task
The objective of Task 34 is to facilitate commercialisation of liquid fuels from biomass 
as energy carriers. Of particular interest are fast pyrolysis and hydrothermal processing to 
maximise liquid product yield and production of renewable fuel oil and transportation fuels. 
The Task contributes to standardisation efforts of these energy intermediates, the resolution 
of critical technical areas and disseminating relevant information particularly to industry and 
policy makers. The scope of the Task is to monitor, review, and contribute to the advancement 
of issues that will permit more successful and more rapid implementation of biomass 
liquefaction technology, including identification of opportunities to provide a substantial 
contribution to bioenergy.
The Task scope includes all steps in a process of liquid fuels production from biomass 
extending from reception of biomass in a raw harvested form to delivery of a marketable 
product as liquid fuel, heat and/or power, chemicals and char by-product. The technology 
review may focus on the thermal conversion and applications steps, but implementation 
requires the complete process to be considered. Process components as well as the total 
process are therefore included in the scope of the Task, which will cover optimisation, 
alternatives, economics, and market assessment.
The work of the Task aims at concerns and expectations of stakeholders such as:
• Conversion technology developers
• Bio-oil/biocrude application developers
• Equipment manufacturers
• Bio-oil users
• Chemical producers
• Utilities providers
• Policy makers
• Decision makers
• Investors
• Planners
• Researchers
43
Industry is actively encouraged to be involved as Task participants, as contributors to 
Workshops or Seminars, as Consultants, or as technical reviewers of Task outputs to ensure 
that the orientation and activities of the Task match or meet their requirements. At least three 
of the existing National Task Leaders (NTL) have continuing and close relationships with 
industrial partners that are currently commercialising liquefied biomass as energy carriers 
in Finland, the Netherlands, and Canada.
Participating countries: Canada, Finland, Germany, Netherlands, Sweden, New Zealand, 
Norway, and USA
Task Leader: Mr Alan Zacher, Pacific Northwest National Laboratory, USA
Operating Agent: Mr Jim Spaeth, US Department of Energy, USA
A National Team Leader from each country is responsible for coordinating the national 
participation in the Task. 
For further details on Task 34, please refer to Appendices 2, 4, 5 and 6; the Task website 
task34.ieabioenergy.com and the IEA Bioenergy website www.ieabioenergy.com under 
‘Our Work: Tasks’.
Work Programme and Progress in 2017
National team leaders were engaged in a number of formalised and informal 
collaborations that they leveraged to provide value to the member countries of IEA 
Bioenergy, the international thermal liquefaction research community, as well as the interests 
of the individual member states. Is some cases, Task meetings were held in conjunction with 
both international and regional Bioenergy meetings and workshops in order to capitalise 
on value to the Task and to having the opportunity to influence and support planning and 
research in thermal liquefaction for us in renewable energy. Task work in 2017 included Task 
meetings, providing support to standards development for thermally liquefied biomass energy 
carriers, providing information resources to support growing commercialisations work in some 
member countries, providing IEA thought leadership through Task participation in Bioenergy 
workshops, and continued information dissemination to stakeholders through Task periodicals, 
publications, and web resources.
The collaborative efforts in the DTL Task 34 consists of influence and guidance of 
standardisation efforts, publications and outreach, Task meetings, technical seminars, 
technical tours, and Task projects, in addition to management and ExCo support actions. 
The work efforts in 2016 included:
• Task meetings coinciding with guidance and support of Bioenergy workshops 
and conferences in member countries.
44
• Publication of the PyNe newsletter to highlight current research, collaborations, 
and successes in Bioenergy through thermal liquefaction of biomass.
• The prior Round Robin on bio-oil production of various biomasses and technologies 
was published in the form of a journal article to provide comprehensive detail around 
the conclusions that were disseminated as posters previously. This was published in 
Energy and Fuels for dissemination to the dedicated research community. Additionally, 
as the stakeholder audience is wider than the researchers that subscribe and follow 
detailed journals, the results were summarised in the IEA Bioenergy 2-page format to 
provide free access to the conclusions and recommendations and published on the Task 
and main IEA Bioenergy websites.
• Development of standards and norms for bio-oil intermediates has continued in 
both Europe and the US with Task member input to the standardisation committees. 
Current progress is detailed in PyNe newsletter during 2017.
• The Task website has made the full transition from the prior PyNe servers that 
have been the face of this collaboration in its evolution from the Pyrolysis Network, 
ThermalNET, and Task 34 under IEA bioenergy. The old website was shuttered in 2017 
and redirected to http://task34.ieabioenergy.com bringing a modern face and focus to 
the biomass liquefaction community.
• Reporting and publicising ongoing collaborations and research in Bioenergy in the form 
of sharing of country reports by country representatives at Task meetings. This serves 
as a method for identifying and forming alignments between research organisations 
at member states to advance research and commercialisation efforts.
• Updates are being maintained to the web-based demo plant database developed 
by Bioenergy 2020+
Workshops and associated Task Meetings
There were two primary meetings that were held and associated with regional and 
international workshops and sites. The first was in Sweden and the second in Canada.
Luleå/Piteå, Sweden and Gothenburg, 15-17 May 2017
The first Task 34 meeting of 2017 was commenced in Luleå/Piteå, Sweden and carried 
on to Gothenburg to be adjacent to ExCo79, and provide Task influence and participation in 
the Advanced Biofuels Conference (ABC) in Gothenburg. The programme included a number 
of technical tours of the vibrant Swedish biofuels industry. Attending were Fernando Preto 
(Canada), Anja Oasmaa (Finland), Kristin Onarheim (Finland), Nicolaus Dahmen (Germany), 
Bert van de Beld (Netherlands), Ferran de Miguel Mercader (New Zealand), Magnus 
Marklund (Sweden), and Alan Zacher (US). Country reports were given by all NTLs.
45
Discussions began with the Round Robin status and progress. A historical perspective 
was presented by USA on the outcome of all 24 years of PyNe and Task 34 Rounds Robin. 
Identified unanswered questions with respect to most needed analytical methods and the 
need for expansion of similar work to encompass bio-crudes (from hydro- and solvo-thermal 
liquefaction). Finalised RR approach as comparative analyses of bio-oils and bio-crudes based 
on unanswered questions from prior RR. Request was made to summarise the Historical 
Perspective into an IEA Bioenergy format two-page summary.
Direct Thermochemical Liquefaction (DTL) systematisation scheme was presented by 
Germany for use in preparing a new DTL brochure and to replace the technology tree 
and organisational scheme for the Task 34 website.
Publication Strategy session was held to critique the transferred Task 34 website 
for revision, identified topics for future 2-page summaries, determined the format 
for upcoming DTL brochure, and identified input for PyNe41.
Informal workshop and research review was held with BOBIC (Bothnia BioIndustries 
Cluster) by Ulf Westerberg at the Piteå Science Park, and with RISE ETC with research in 
biomass liquefaction and characterisation as well as future upgrading presented and reviewed. 
Technical tours and Site Visits included:
• Liquefaction, characterisation, and upgrading facilities at RISE ETC.
• External tour of the forestry and wood processing facilities in and around Piteå
• In-depth examination and tour of the entire LTU GreenFuels gasification synthesis plant
• Tour of the SunPine tall diesel factory
• Tour of the PREEM refinery
• Tour of Volvo
• Tour of Södra cell
This was a rare experience expressing the full usage chain of biofuels in Sweden for 
forestry related biofuels from biomass growth, processing, fuels extraction, upgrading, 
and end use. From this NTLs participated in various aspects of the ABC in Gothenburg 
including a “Biofuels in Aviation and Maritime Transport” session hosted by Magnus 
Marklund of Task 34 session along with presentations from Task 34 NTLs Nicolaus 
Dahmen, Alan Zacher, Fernando Preto, as well as an industrial contribution from Martin 
Porsgaard. Topics included strategies for hydrotreating, needs for upgrading to conventional 
transportation fuels, critical factors for operating IC engines on bio-oils, and progress 
and hurdles towards getting biofuels in the air. Proceedings are available at https://
advancedbiofuelsconference.org/
46
HTP-Forum Liepzig, Germany, 12-13 September 2017
The Task co-chaired the HTP-Forum on hydrothermal processing in Germany in September. 
While the event was primarily to attract regional stakeholders on advancing hydrothermal 
processing, an international session was added to reflect on the international state-of-the-
art. In this session, Nicolaus Dahmen reported on the work of Task 34 along with it recent 
adjustments and focus to include hydrothermal and solvo-thermal liquefaction approaches 
in addition to the historical focus on Pyrolysis.
The organisers of the HTP-Forum are looking to prepare a report for the IEA Bioenergy 
PyNe newsletter that will be included with PyNe41 or PyNe42 depending on when it can 
be completed.
Ottawa, Canada, 28 November – 2 December 2017
The second Task meeting of 2017 was held in Ottawa Canada coinciding with Task 
involvement in two other external Bioenergy conferences, Bioenergy for the Future 
and the Scaling Up 2017 conference, and then followed by an Analytical Workshop 
at CanmetENERGY. The programme included technical tours of a number of bioenergy 
operations at Canmet, but the hoped for tour of the commercialised Ensyn pyrolysis 
production facility in Renfrew, Ontario could not be arranged. Member countries were 
represented by Fernando Preto (Canada), Kristin Onarheim (Finland), Axel Funke 
(Germany), Bert van de Beld (Netherlands), Ferran de Miguel Mercader (New Zealand), 
Magnus Marklund (Sweden), and Alan Zacher (US). ExCo was represented by Alex MacLeod 
(Canada) and Jim Spaeth (USA).
The first event was the Bioenergy for the Future, part of the Mission Innovation where Task 
34 participated in the rollout of the Bioenergy Roadmap supported by IEA Bioenergy. Task 
input to this had been coordinated by Fernando Preto.
Following this the Task provided speakers and interactions at the Scaling Up 2018 
conference in Ottawa. The Task and IEA Bioenergy were represented in various Question 
and Answer panels, which made up the bulk of this interactive bioenergy event. The panels 
covered the range of subject matter experts including environmental, research, policy, financing, 
commercialisation, and recruiting future talent, all with the common theme that there is a 
need to push biofuels towards scale-up immediately to have meaningful impact on our global 
renewable energy due to the lengthy period that is required to bring technologies to market. 
Discussions centered around ideas on how to advance scale-up of Bioenergy and removing or 
avoiding barriers that would reduce or delay successful adoption of biomass energy.
The Task also organised and led an Analytical Workshop for thermochemical liquefaction 
technologists in Canada and from the gathered international representatives. A number of 
different technologies were represented in the spectrum of conversion of biomass and to 
transportable energy intermediates, upgradable intermediates, as well as direct energy 
47
use. Included in the mix were inputs from a broad range of biomass, waste feedstocks, 
and potential energy intermediates that provided valuable insight into the all-of-the-above 
approach that Canada is considering in the search for renewable energy. Discussions 
involved assessing analytical needs, existing gaps in understanding of biomass and energy 
carriers and considering additional and new standardisation, with unique contributions from 
Ottawa ministry for the environment, towards the importance of standardisation to allow 
for permitting of bioenergy technologies to regulatorily differentiate them from hazardous 
waste incinerators that could conceivably attempt to operate abusing a bioenergy permitting 
process. The discussions from this workshop were used by the Task to target and refine the 
Round Robin approach and capture additional insights on challenges that the international 
thermal liquefaction research community must address to enable wider adoption.
The proceedings included a technical tour of the wide variety of large scale research and 
capabilities at Canmet. This included examination of the biomass handling and transportation, 
multiple pilot scale fast pyrolysis systems for production of bio-oil intermediates, 
demonstration scale system for biomass gasification, multiple systems for biomass and bio-
oil direct combustion for thermal energy, shakedown of small scale heat and power biomass 
energy systems for remote communities, and slurry-phase catalytic hydrotreating and 
hydrocracking of bio-oil intermediates to hydrocarbons for transportation fuels.
The series of events provided an opportunity to plan and advance the Task collaborations, to 
have Task influence on the international dialogue on Bioenergy within Canada, and to harvest 
additional pathways to collaboration on advancing and scaling-up biomass energy through 
direct thermochemical liquefaction.
Newsletter
In 2017 the PyNe newsletter was produced twice to publicise and highlight ongoing 
research and collaborations in member countries. Continuing the tradition of the last 
21 years, the newsletter was used as a vehicle to provide information on current research 
and commercialisation efforts in liquefied biomass energy carriers. A mixture of pyrolysis 
and pressure liquefaction research was featured in both issues. PyNe40 also provided a 
retrospective of the previous 20 years of influence that the Pyrolysis Network and the IEA 
Bioenergy have served in advancing bioenergy and reducing barriers to commercialisation. 
PyNe41 featured ongoing collaborations in Europe as well as the fruit of standardisation 
efforts in Europe.
A new distribution service was utilised in 2017 to enable analytics for determining readership 
and impact of the distribution, as well as an opportunity for IEA Bioenergy ExCo to survey 
the Pyrolysis Network for input for future Task structure and focus. The newsletter is now 
circulated to participants via the Task 34 website in electronic format. Along with historical 
archives going back to its inception in the 1990s.
48
Website/Dissemination
The Task 34 website is an important mechanism for information and technology transfer. The 
website was fully transitioned to the IEA Bioenergy servers. The old PyNe website has now been 
shuttered, and traffic has been redirected to the new server. The Task is continuously updating 
the format and information with more recent technical information and progress along with 
incorporating resources around the new focus on DTL. This is still a work in progress.
Deliverables
Deliverables for 2017 included: Publication of the Round Robin in Energy and Fuels, 
publication of the two-page stakeholder summary of the Round Robin on IEA Bioenergy, 
reporting to the ExCo (Annual Report, progress reports, and audited accounts); updating 
of the Task website on bioenergy servers; Two task newsletters PyNe40 and PyNe41; 
organisation and minutes of Task meetings.
TASK 36: Integrating Energy Recovery into Solid Waste 
Management Systems
Overview of the Task
In 2012 the World Bank estimated that there is around 1.3 billion tonnes of waste produced 
per annum globally and that this will grow to 2.2 billion tonnes/year by 2025. They attributed 
this rise in waste production to increased urbanisation in developing and emerging economies 
and the increase in per capita production of waste as a result of this trend. This trend is a 
considerable challenge for many countries. To meet the challenge there will need to be intensive 
legislative, managerial and institutional changes, including the introduction of strategic 
direction aimed at decreasing and controlling waste production; and the development of 
recycling, reduction and re-use as well as energy technologies to decrease the impact of waste. 
IEA Bioenergy Task 36 investigates the interface between waste management and energy 
recovery. Our prime aim is to understand the implications of technical and policy changes in the 
waste area that impact the integration of energy into solid waste management; and to provide 
support by disseminating and exchanging information on these developments.
Waste production varies markedly across the world, in terms of composition and quantity. 
Strategies and solutions that are appropriate in one region may not be right elsewhere. 
The consequence of this is that countries have different approaches to challenges in waste 
arisings, reflected in different mixtures of treatment and disposal. Nevertheless there are also 
common themes. Uppermost in these are concerns relating to the increasing quantities of 
waste needing to be treated and the impact of landfilling mixed wastes on the environment. In 
some regions additional pressures arise from decreasing available landfill void space. This 
49
is driving policy makers to examine alternatives to landfill, including reduction and recycling 
of waste, and recovery of value from waste, commonly encompassed in the ‘Waste Hierarchy’, 
which is governed by a set of principles dedicated to minimising the impacts of waste and 
improving resource use. In some regions there are calls for ‘zero waste to landfill’ and for 
policy to encourage the circular economy or ‘smart waste management’. These moves are 
most advanced in the European Union and other regions where landfill is expensive or scarce. 
Elsewhere, notably in North America and Australia, countries continue to rely on landfill, 
but in these countries there are also increasing pressures to reduce waste production and to 
recycle or recover where possible, leading to increased interest in recovery of energy from the 
residual waste. Globally these policy pressures have led to a proliferation of research work on 
waste management, including policy development, environmental systems analysis, technology 
development and economic drivers. Whilst this has assisted in the development of more 
sophisticated waste management systems, in many cases it has also delayed deployment of 
energy recovery systems (specifically for residual wastes), in particular due to confused policy 
making, public awareness (and opposition) and uncertainty over environmental performance 
and technology performance.
Against this background decision makers continue to require guidance and information 
on waste and resource management systems that are environmentally and economically 
sustainable. Task 36 provides a unique opportunity to draw together information on how 
systems, policies and technologies are being applied in different countries to provide 
guidance for decision makers on key issues.
Participating countries: France, Germany, Italy, Singapore (observer), and Sweden.
Task Leader: Mr. Inge Johansson, RISE Research Institutes of Sweden, Sweden
Operating Agent: Dr. Åsa Forsum, Swedish Energy Agency, Sweden
The Task Leader directs and manages the work programme. A National Team Leader from 
each country is responsible for coordinating the national participation in the Task.

‘Our Work: Tasks’.
Progress in R&D
Task meetings and workshops
The Task’s core work was undertaken as structured Task meetings, each of which was 
accompanied with a themed workshop. The aim of these workshops is to allow Task members 
to present work on the nature of the issues concerned within their own country; to invite 
speakers to present work of relevance and to allow discussion of the issues presented.
50
The first workshop focused on the circular economy and what role Waste-to-Energy 
could play. Paris, January 2017. The workshop was arranged at Ademe.
Workshop aim:
Today there is a general agreement that the linear approach to resource management that 
have been dominating for quite a while, is not sustainable. The wish for a more circular 
economy where resources are reused and recycled in an efficient manner is discussed both on 
a political and a societal level. The aim of the workshop was to discuss what implications this 
has on bioenergy/energy from waste
Workshop outcomes:
When the circular economy is illustrated, it is often depicted as one loop for inorganic 
technical materials and one loop for organics (mainly food). The illustrations seldom cover the 
upcoming biomaterials that are used and not necessarily fit into the “normal” bio loop. These 
materials are becoming more and more important when discussing the bio economy and must 
not be forgotten.
The role of waste-to-energy is normally depicted as something to be minimised in the circular 
economy. In an ideal circular economy that might also be the case – even though all recycling/
recovery operations still need energy to function. The function to act as a kidney in society, 
destroying toxic substances as well as concentrating other toxic elements to be disposed of 
in a safe manner will continue to be important for the foreseeable future. The lifespan of 
products means that there are a large stock of undesirable substances, already built up in 
society, that will need to be treated when they become waste. The conclusion was that there 
will be a role for waste to energy in the circular economy – although that role might be 
different from today. The presentations from the workshop are available at the homepage. 
(www.task36.ieabioenergy.com).
The second workshop dealt with the potential of using Alternative thermal treatments 
for feedstock recycling, Karlsruhe, December 2017.
Workshop aim:
There are quite a number of limitations on mechanical recycling of materials for example. 
The content of unwanted chemical substances in wood or plastics is one of those major 
limitations. Thermochemical recycling (feedstock recycling) could be a solution to that and 
the aim was to give an overview of such methods.
51
Workshop outcomes:
Although gasification and pyrolysis of waste today mainly acts as two stage combustion 
processes there is potential to use the technologies to convert the value chain into a value 
cycle and generate new valuable resources. However there are large challenges when looking 
at the demand for processes that can handle feedstock flexibility, which is needed to achieve 
economics of scale. This demand gives rise to challenges for most parts of a plant (thermal 
conversion step, cleaning step and synthesis step). During the workshop more general 
presentations were mixed with insights into the challenges and possibilities seen from the 
view of different technical suppliers. The presentations are available at the homepage. (www.
task36.ieabioenergy.com)
Task Meetings and site visits
January 2017, task meeting in Paris together with a site visit to Isséane
June 2017, Task meeting in Stockholm together with a site visit to Mälarenergi
December 2017, Task meeting in Karlsruhe together with a site visit to the Bioliq® plant 
at KIT
Deliverables
The deliverables for the Task in 2017 have included presentations from the workshops and 
minutes from the Task meetings. The first newsletter was published late in 2017. The Task also 
prepared two progress reports for ExCo together with the annual report.
Website
The website (task36.ieabioenergy.com) is the key tool used for dissemination of information 
from the Task. It provides access to the latest publications produced by the Task, including the 
presentations from the workshop. The website also provides access to past reports, articles, 
case studies and presentations at workshops associated with Task meetings. In addition, it 
provides a ‘members only’ forum, to allow rapid access to the latest drafts of documents and 
to information on Task meetings. During 2017 there were about 1600 visitors to the site. 
Where the country of origin is known, the most page views were from users in the USA, China, 
UK, Canada and Germany. There was a significant increase in traffic after the first newsletter 
was published late in 2017.

TASK 37: Energy from Biogas
Overview of the Task
The main objective of the Task 37 work programme is to address the challenges related to 
the economic and environmental sustainability of biogas production and utilisation. While 
there are thousands of biogas plants in OECD countries, operation in the vast majority of 
cases can only be sustained with the help of subsidies to be able to compete with the fossil 
energy industrial sector. There is a clear need to enhance many of the process steps in the 
biogas production chain, particularly at small farm-scale, in order to reduce both investment 
and operating costs and to increase income.
The approach of Task 37 involves the review and exchange of information and promotion 
of best practices for all steps of the process chain for anaerobic digestion (AD) of biomass 
residues and energy crops for the production of biogas as a clean renewable fuel for use either 
directly in combined heat and power generation or after up-grading to biomethane where it 
replaces natural gas. In addition, there is growing interest in the use of biogas and biomethane 
to help stabilise power grids that are increasingly fed from variable sources of generation like 
wind and solar.
The Task also addresses utilisation of the residues of the AD process, the digestate, and 
the quality management methods for conversion to high quality organic fertiliser. The scope 
of the work covers biogas production at small and large farm-scale, in waste water treatment 
plants and treatment of the biodegradable fraction of municipal waste (biowaste), energy 
crops and algae.
Only recently have the environmental performance of biogas production and utilisation 
been assessed in detail. Recent studies have identified key sources of emissions of greenhouse 
gases at various stages of the biogas production chain. Task 37 has addressed emissions and is 
directing attention to environmental sustainability of biogas production and utilisation and is 
working towards defining best practices for emissions reduction.
Through the work of the Task, communication between RD&D programmes, relevant industrial 
sectors and governmental bodies is encouraged and stimulated. Continuous education is 
addressed through dissemination of the Task’s publications in workshops, conferences and 
via the website. Information and data collected by the Task is used increasingly for providing 
support to all levels of policy making and the drafting of standards in Member Countries.
Participating countries: Australia, Austria, Brazil, Denmark, Finland, France, Germany, 
Ireland, Korea, the Netherlands, Norway, Sweden, Switzerland, and the United Kingdom.
53
Task Leader: Prof Jerry D Murphy, MaREI Centre, Environmental Research Institute, 
University College Cork, Ireland
Operating Agent: Matthew Clancy, Sustainable Energy Authority of Ireland, Dublin, 
Ireland
The Task Leader directs and manages the work programme. National Team Leaders are 
responsible for coordinating the national participation in the Task and for coordinating 
specific topics in the work programme.
For further details on Task 37, please refer to Appendices 2, 4, 5 and 6; the Task website 
http://www.task37.ieabioenergy.com and the IEA Bioenergy website www.ieabioenergy.com 
under ‘Our Work: Tasks’.
Progress in R&D
In 2017 the work programme consisted of the following Topics:
• Preparation of technical reports;
• Collaboration with other Tasks;
• Country Reports and Databases;
• Success Stories and Case Studies;
• Website, Newsletters and Webinars;
• Task Meetings and Workshops;
• Deliverables of Task 37 in 2017.
Preparation of Technical Reports
The progress on the content of new technical brochures/reports is summarised below.
Methane Emissions
This report is now published with a date of December 2017. We have also published the 2 
page summary. These are available on line. This is a long detailed report, which describes 
and assesses methodologies for assessing fugitive methane emissions from biogas facilities, 
the main sources of emissions, how to minimise such emissions and the impact of these 
emissions on the sustainability of biogas systems. It was also the subject of a webinar 
with an audience in excess of 400 in January 2018.
54
Two conference presentations were made based on this report:

“Methane emissions from biogas plants – methods for determination results and 
relevance for greenhouse gas balances”” 15th International Water Association 
Anaerobic Digestion 17 – 20 October 2017, Beijing China
• Alessandro Agostini, J. Liebetrau, T. Clauß, T. Reinelt, Jerry Murphy. Evaluation 
of the impact of methane emissions on the carbon footprint of biogas plants. 4th

Parchi del Garda, Italy
• Jan Liebetrau (2018) Emissions from Biogas plants – methods for measurement, 
results and overall evaluation, Conference of the European biogas association, 
January 24-26 Antwerp
Food Waste Digestion Systems
The emphasis of this report will be on how food waste digestion can be done successfully, 
within the circular economy. It is crucial to define what we mean by food waste and 
distinguish from biowaste. Collection systems (frequency of collection, size of bin, 
contamination) have a significant impact on the feedstock. Mono-digestion of food waste 
is dominant in UK. Scale varies up to 130,000 t/a. Circular economies using hub and 
pod concept balancing nutrients between urban and rural farming are of great interest. 
Digestate from food waste is fairly pure as it comes from food we would have eaten. Quality 
assurance is important. Food waste biorefining through carboxylate platform or through C1 
fermentation of gaseous products of AD is also of interest. The report will include for some 
case studies
Grid Injection and Greening of the Gas Grid
This report will be published in February 2018 and exists as an advanced draft. The report 
deals with the Green Gas Commitment including 6 European Gas Grids who have an ambition 
of substituting 100% of natural gas with green renewable gas by 2050. The report discusses 
how such an industry will evolve. It will discuss the gas grid, gas quality and the role of the 
gas grid in the future. It will discuss why biogas would be used to produce biomethane instead 
of CHP. It will set out the importance of green gas in supplying renewable energy in transport 
and in renewable heat such as for industries on the gas grid. The potential route to green gas 
and scale of the potential industry may be outlined by member countries.
A paper was published based on this report:
• Wall, M.D., McDonagh, S., Murphy, J.D. 2017. Cascading biomethane energy systems 
for sustainable green gas production in a circular economy. Bioresour. Technol. https://
doi.org/10.1016/j.biortech.2017.07.115
55
A conference presentation was made based on this report:
• Jerry D Murphy, David Wall (2017) “ Use of circular economy and cascading 
bioenergy systems in ensuring sustainable biogas production ” 15th International 
Water Association Anaerobic Digestion 17 – 20 October 2017, Beijing China
Local applications of anaerobic digestion towards integrated sustainable solutions
The objectives are to provide information on cost effective biogas technologies. The target 
Group is NGOs. The report will detail a number of proposed exemplars from across the world. 
The concept of what sustainability actually means for these biogas plants will be discussed. This 
will include the conflicts between small simple digesters utilising the proximity principle (with 
potential for methane slippage) and large industrial digesters with high levels of sophistication.
The Role of Anaerobic Digestion and Biogas in the Circular Economy
Anaerobic digestion systems tend to form parts of circular economies. It is difficult to 
compare anaerobic digestion to a wind turbine. Biogas is more than a fuel and without 
biogas and anaerobic digestion a number of processes would not be sustainable. Anaerobic 
digestion is a multi-process system including waste treatment, environmental improvement, 
renewable energy production and biofertiliser production. Anaerobic digestion processes 
can be considered scavenger type systems producing biogas from a large variety of wet 
organic wastes, residues and feedstocks. Biogas is an incredibly flexible end product having 
applications in renewable electricity, heat and transport fuel. Innovative systems will be 
described. Seaweed biogas may have a role in multi-trophic aquaculture. Micro-algae may 
scrub CO2 from a bioenergy power plant and provide feed for a biogas plant. Anaerobic 
digestion has applications in liquid biofuel and biorefinery systems.
Veracity and Applicability of Biomethane Potential Assay Results
The BMP assay is a limited test in which the inoculum is usually twice the quantity of the 
substrate. This has the tendency to mask limitations in the feedstock such as non-ideal C/N 
ratios and lack of micronutrients. The importance of inoculum in the BMP result will be 
discussed and whether the inoculum is suitable for the feedstock. It may be prudent to allow 
for acclimatisation when the substrate is different to the substrate in the system, which 
produced the inoculum. Different BMP systems can yield different BMP results. Neither 
does the BMP assay give data on optimal organic loading rate and operating conditions for a 
digester. It may be more beneficial (but also more costly) to undertake continuous digestion 
of the substrate over a period of time to give specific methane yields (SMY) corresponding to 
different organic loading rates (OLR) and hydraulic retention times (HRT).
Biomethane as a transport fuel
This will be a short report yielding up to date data on assessment of modern natural gas 
vehicle engines. It is suggested that the report be renamed “Experiences in Biomethane 
Buses.” Potentially this may be published in 2019.

TASK 38: Climate Change Effects of Biomass and Bioenergy 
Systems
Overview of the Task
Bioenergy is promoted as a low-carbon renewable fuel, and has been identified to play 
an important role in achieving climate stabilisation by the Intergovernmental Panel on 
Climate Change (IPCC). However, the value of bioenergy in climate change mitigation 
has been challenged with increasing vigour over recent years, by various academic 
and environmental groups. These concerns have fuelled an on-going debate about the 
appropriate role for bioenergy in climate policy, particularly in Europe and the USA.
61
The primary goal of IEA Bioenergy Task 38 on Climate Change Effects of Biomass and 
Bioenergy Systems is to promote the sustainable use of biomass and bioenergy through 
improved understanding of the climate change effects of biomass production and utilisation 
for energy. Task 38 devises and promotes standard methodology for quantifying the 
climate change effects of bioenergy systems. Our objective is to support decision makers 
in government and industry, in the development of climate change mitigation strategies 
involving sustainable bioenergy.
Participating countries: Australia, Finland, France, Germany, Sweden, and USA
Task Leader: Annette Cowie, New South Wales Department of Primary Industries/
University of New England, Australia
Task Manager: Miguel Brandão, Royal Institute of Technology, Stockholm, Sweden
Operating Agent: Mark Brown, Bioenergy Australia, Australia
The Task Leader directs and manages the work programme, with the assistance of the Task 
Manager. A National Team Leader from each country is responsible for coordinating national 
participation in the Task by each participating country.
For further details on Task 38, please refer to Appendices 2, 4, 5 and 6; the Task 38 website 
http://task38.ieabioenergy.com and the IEA Bioenergy website www.ieabioenergy.com under

Task 38 Forest Modelling workshop: Växjö (Sweden) 10th January
The workshop focused on divergent results for the climate change effects of bioenergy 
from forest systems from two studies in Finland and Sweden. The workshop included 
discussion to clarify details of the methods and draw out key factors that influence the 
results. General discussion then considered the strengths and weaknesses of the approaches 
of the two studies, and identified aspects for which further information is required, to gain 
a more complete understanding of the results of each study. The group then summarised the 
points of difference identified, and finally noted some ideas for future work.

Joint Task 38 and Chalmers University on climate impacts of bioenergy systems: 
Gothenburg (Sweden) 16th May
Task 38 and Chalmers University of Technology co-hosted a workshop on the climate 
impacts of bioenergy systems, stimulated in part by concerns raised in a recent report by 
Chatham House: “Woody Biomass for Power and Heat: Impacts on the Global Climate”. 
Climate scientists, energy system modellers and life cycle assessment experts presented their 
work, and exchanged views on research methods and knowledge gaps. The objectives for the 
workshop were to advance scientific understanding of the climate effects of bioenergy. Major 
issues discussed included:
• how bioenergy contributes to the global carbon budget
• short-term vs long-term emission-reduction targets
• how climate effects of bioenergy should be assessed
Task 38 Business Meeting: Angers (France) 6th and 8th November

the climate effects of bioenergy–Choice of reference system. Renewable and Sustainable 
Energy Reviews.
 
This paper discusses the importance of the reference system in evaluating the climate 
effects of bioenergy and presents guidance on choosing the most appropriate reference 
system according to the purpose of the study, with particular focus on the land use 
reference. A decisions tree is presented to aid researchers and decision-makers in

Life Cycle Assessment: What, How, and Why? In: Abraham, M.A. (Ed.), Encyclopedia 
of Sustainable Technologies. Elsevier, pp. 277–284. 
65
 
This book chapter published in Elsevier Encyclopedia for Sustainable Technologies 
provides guidance on conducting consequential life cycle assessment.
The following paper is nearing completion:
3. Metrics for quantifying climate effects of bioenergy
 
This paper demonstrates the differences between different metrics used to quantify 
climate effects of GHG emissions and sequestration. GHG emissions, including those 
of biomass and bioenergy systems, are traditionally quantified using the cumulative 
radiative forcing of greenhouse gas emissions (using GWP100 to combine impacts of 
different gases) as the indicator, but other indicators could be used such as global 
temperature potential or others metrics that take various approaches to differentiating 
impacts based on timing of emissions and removals. The paper uses three simplified 
bioenergy systems to illustrate the effects of using different metrics.
LCA methods and models
Several papers are under preparation addressing: (1) tools used in policy implementation 
for GHG emissions in Europe, United States, and Canada; (2) other environmental impacts 
for commercial biofuels; and (3) prospective models used in conjunction with technology 
development evaluation. This work was commenced in collaboration with Task 39 and has 
been expanded under the Inter-task project “Measuring, governing and gaining support for 
sustainable bioenergy supply chains”.
Inter-task Projects
Measuring, governing and gaining support for sustainable bioenergy supply chains
Annette Cowie and Göran Berndes (Task 43) are co-leading Objective 1, which will provide 
an overview of calculation methods & tools to assess the sustainability of various biomass 
and bioenergy supply chains and discuss pros and cons of a global, uniform or harmonised 
framework. Helena Chum is coordinating the comparison of tools for assessing biofuels. 
Annette Cowie is assessing the applicability of sustainability criteria to biomass supply chains 
based on invasive scrub, a common issue in the world’s drylands. Miguel Brandão is working 
with Task 43 members to examine the evidence for iLUC associated with ethanol production 
in the US.
Website/Communication
Task Website
The Task 38 website (http://task38.ieabioenergy.com/) is the repository of publications 
and other material produced by Task 38 and predecessor task “Greenhouse Gas Balances 
of Biomass and Bioenergy Systems”.
66
Information on the site includes:
• publications of Task 38 including statements on timing of emissions, sustainability 
of bioenergy

• guidance on methods for quantifying greenhouse gas balance of bioenergy systems
• FAQ page
• case studies (identified by both country and process)
• contact details of national team leaders.
Collaboration with Other Tasks
Intertask projects (see above).
Within the inter-Task project “Measuring, governing and gaining support for sustainable 
bioenergy supply chains” (led by Task 40) Task 38 is co-leading Objective 1, with Task 43, 
and Task 38 is working with Task 39 to review GHG assessment tools for liquid biofuels.
Task 38 is also contributing to the Bio-CCUS and iLUC projects.
Joint publications:
The following reports were commissioned and published jointly with Task 43:
• Bernier P and Bright R. – Albedo effects of biomass production: A review 
 
This report reviews recent findings on the extent to which changes in albedo 
can enhance or diminish the climate change benefits of bioenergy. The albedo effect 
is dependent on the latitude, and the bioenergy system (woody or annual crop, and 
its management).
• Stendahl, Repo A, Hammar T & Liski J – Climate impact assessments of forest 
bioenergy affected by decomposition modelling 
 
This report compares the Q and Yasso models, that are used to model decomposition 
of forest litter. The study found that the choice of the decomposition model results in 
different quantitative estimates. However, the decomposition model choice does not 
lead to diverging conclusions about the warming impact of extracting forest residues 
for bioenergy.
• Annette Cowie worked with Göran Berndes Task 43 and Martin Junginger (Task 40) 
and Fabiano Ximenes (NSW DPI) to prepare a response to Chatham House report 
“Woody Biomass for Power and Heat: Impacts on the Global Climate”. The response 
was published by IEA Bioenergy.

Deliverables
Apart from the wide range of deliverables mentioned above, the Task also produced 
progress reports and audited accounts for the ExCo, and minutes of the Task meetings, and 
a the “Task focus” section for the IEA Bioenergy December Newsletter. In addition, individual 
Task members published scientific papers that were informed by interactions with Task 
members, and some of these outputs were formally reviewed by Task 38 members.
TASK 39: Commercialising Conventional and Advanced Liquid 
Biofuels from Biomass
Task 39 continues to play a key role in facilitating the commercialisation of liquid 
biofuels from biomass. While cost competitive production economics remain challenging 
within a relatively low oil price environment and in the absence of carbon pricing, the past 
year has seen ongoing progress in the development of advanced biofuel technologies.
The Task actively follows and supports the development of biofuels, and in 2017 increased 
its focus on biofuels for non-road heavy transport, particularly for the marine sector and 
especially for the aviation sector, as this is an area where significant industry engagement is 
happening. The continued use of aviation biofuels (biojet) is tracked on the International Civil 
Aviation Organisation’s (ICAO) Global Framework for Aviation Alternative Fuels website and 
shows, impressively, that to date 100,000 commercial flights have used some proportion of 
biojet fuels. While only one commercial facility, AltAir in California, regularly produces biojet 
fuels (via upgrading of oleaginous feedstocks), five pathways to biojet fuels are now certified 
under ASTM with more expected to be certified in the future.
The Task also continues to be active in monitoring the technology/commercialisation space, 
where the crucial role that policy plays, and will continue to play, is increasingly apparent as 
the world strives to decrease emissions from all transport sectors, especially aviation which 
is is growing the fastest. The key role and challenge of policy is particularly evident in the 
international aviation and marine sectors that fall under international jurisdiction, as domestic 
policies for these sectors can be limited and poorly coordinated with one another. While 
progress has been made in the various conversion technologies to show the technical ability to 
produce marine and aviation biofuels from renewable bio-based feedstocks, the right policies 
69
will be essential to advance commercialisation and market penetration of these types of drop-
in biofuels. Some of the Task’s work in 2017, which will likely continue into the 2019-2021 
triennium has been focussed on the opportunities for biofuels in the marine shipping sector and 
assessing the state of development of drop-in biofuels for marine applications.
Overview of the Task
The goal of Task 39 is to facilitate the commercialisation of liquid biofuels, especially 
liquid biofuels from biomass, with a focus spanning conventional and advanced technologies, 
including “drop-in” biofuels and algae-based biofuels. Through a coordinated focus on 
technology, commercialisation, sustainability, policy, markets and implementation, the Task 
assists participants in their efforts to develop and deploy biofuels. These biofuels include 
cellulosic ethanol, biomass-based diesel, renewable aviation fuel (“biojet”), etc., produced 
through various technology routes such as oleochemical, biochemical, thermochemical and 
hybrid technologies. It also continues to identify and pursue opportunities for comparative 
technical assessment and support for policy development. The success of the Task has been, 
in large part, a direct result of providing a forum for integrated discussions of these topics, 
aided by the active involvement of participants from industry, government and academia. The 
Task continues to lead and coordinate activities in three main program areas:
• Technology and Commercialisation with a focus to:
� develop and commercialise improved, cost-effective bio-based processes for the 
generation of advanced renewable biofuels, particularly “drop-in” biofuels from 
biomass;
� work with other IEA Bioenergy Tasks to develop and commercialise improved, cost-
effective thermochemical-based processes, such as the Fischer-Tropsch process for 
converting syngas to synthetic diesel and other advanced biofuels; and
� understand advancements and challenges in ‘next-generation’ liquid biofuel 
technologies, including biomass-to-hydrogen and algae-to-biofuel processes.
• Policy, Markets, Implementation and Sustainability encompassing issues that 
address policy/legislative/regulatory and infrastructure concerns and needs regarding 
expanding conventional and advanced liquid biofuels; and to provide information and 
analyses on policies, markets, and implementation issues (including regulatory and 
infrastructure development) that will help participants foster commercialisation of 
renewable low carbon liquid biofuels as a replacement for non-renewable fossil-based 
fuels, by continuing the deployment of conventional (so-called first generation) biofuels 
and supporting development of advanced (so-called 2nd generation) biofuels and 
‘future-generation’ biofuels.
• A Multifaceted Communication Strategy to facilitate knowledge transfer, 
dissemination of information, outreach to stakeholders, and coordination with 
related groups both within IEA Bioenergy and externally.
70
The Task structure allows participants to work together in a comprehensive manner on 
prioritised issues and challenges identified across the broad area of liquid/transportation 
biofuels.

Progress in R&D
Task Meetings and Workshops
Task 39 remains highly active in terms of both business meetings (which involve significant 
knowledge exchange between participants in the form of Country Reports) as well as special 
sessions hosted in conjunction with established biofuels-related events. In 2017, the Task 
held two formal business meetings (Gothenburg, Sweden in May and Brussels, Belgium in 
September).
71
The first Task business meeting of 2017 was held in Gothenburg, Sweden on 15 May 2017, 
in conjunction with the Advanced Biofuels Conference held in Gothenburg, Sweden from 17-
19 May. This well attended meeting focused on report updates, review of ongoing progress/
meeting deliverables and future planning. It also included presentations from several high 
profile, local researchers including Professors Goran Berndes (Sustainability of Bioenergy 
Systems) and Lisbeth Olsson (Biofuels research), both from Chalmers University. Tomas 
Ekbom, Sweden’s national team leader to the Task, presented on Sweden’s impressive history 
of accomplishments in developing biofuels and also its current situation. Michael Persson 
gave a presentation on bioenergy in Denmark. To try to enhance inter-Task cooperation, Prof. 
Berndes representing Task 43 discussed potential collaboration projects such as: how might 
the nature, amount and sustainability of a biomass resource influence the ease of establishing 
a biomass-to-biofuels process? It is hoped that Tasks 39 and 43 will be able to establish joint 
work in this area in the next triennium.

well-attended meeting was generously hosted by the European Commission‘s (EC) ExCo 
member Kyriakos Maniatis at the EC’s meeting rooms. Twenty-six attendees comprising 
Task 39 members and visiting guests took part in an stimulating and valuable two days 
of presentations and discussions about liquid biofuels developments around the globe. 
This meeting was especially noteworthy and enhanced by the participation of a distinguished 
visitor/observer delegation, which included representatives from India and China as well as 
from the Renewable Energy Group (REG), a large North American-based FAME biodiesel 
and HVO/renewable diesel producer, and (S&T)2 Consultants, a Canadian life cycle analysis 
(LCA) modeling consultancy. Indian delegates included Mr. Sandeep Poundrik (Joint 
Secretary, Ministry of Petroleum and Natural Gas), Dr. Y.B. Ramakrishna (Chair, Biofuels 
72
Working Group, Ministry of Petroleum and Natural Gas) and Dr. Arvind Lali (DBT-ICT, 
Biofuels Advisor to Ministry of Science and Technology). Dr. Huili Zhang (Professor, 
Beijing University of Chemical Technology) represented China.
Among the Task’s highly informative activities for its membership are annual country 
report presentations from each participant highlighting and providing insights into recent 
developments in biofuels production and deployment occurring in Task 39 member countries 
and also in other important countries like China and India where significant amounts of 
biofuels are produced and used today and aspirations for expanded production and use 
are growing. These country report presentations, which included excellent reports on 
developments in China (by Prof. Zhang) and in India (by Mr. Sandeep and Dr. Lali), took 
up almost the entire first day of the meeting. This stimulated productive discussion and 
information exchange between meeting attendees, again demonstrating that these annual 
country reports remain one of invaluable benefits of Task membership. In this case, the 
positive momentum for development of advanced biofuels now occurring in both China and 
India were welcome news to representatives from elsewhere in the world where progress on 
development and deployment of advanced liquid biofuels has slowed.
The most recent IEA World Energy Outlook projects that China and India will become major 
global users of transportation fuels as their large economies continue to develop and grow. 
In coming years, both of these countries will likely play important roles in developing “green” 
transportation options as their economies and infrastructure are further developed. This 
is one of the reasons IEA Bioenergy is actively courting both of these countries to join the 
IEA Bioenergy TCP. We were thus especially honored to have representatives from both India 
and China as guests/observers at this meeting, actively participating and providing valuable 
contributions to the Task’s deliberations. To build on this encouraging development, Task 39 will 
hold its next business meeting in Beijing, China, in April 2018, in a further effort to encourage 
China and India to join IEA Bioenergy and Task 39 for the next triennium (2019-2021).
The Brussels Task 39 business meeting also benefited from the participation of 
representatives of REG and (S&T)2 Consultants, especially during discussions on scoping 
Phase 2 of the Task’s on-going LCA model comparison project (in which leading LCA models 
– GHGenius for Canada, GREET for US, BioGrace for EU, and VSB for Brazil – are being 
assessed and harmonised). One topic discussed in detail is the accuracy and usefulness of 
biofuels’ LCAs, which vary widely. Greater harmonisation among and confidence in/validation 
of LCA models is needed. Groups such as REG, (S&T)2 Consultants, the California Air 
Resources Board (CARB), as well as LCA expertise within Task 39 membership, are agreed 
that the public and policy makers need to be confident in the accuracy of LCA models being 
used to assess the overall “sustainability” of biofuels.
73
Task 39 also cosponsored an industry session on May 3, 2017 at the 39th Symposium 
on Biotechnology for Fuels and Chemicals held in San Francisco. This session was entitled, 
Progress in the Commercialization of Advanced Biorefineries, and included the following 
presentation and speakers.
Presentations and speakers included:
• Research and deployment of bioenergy production from algae, a state of technology 
review. Lieve M.L. Laurens, Melodie Chen-Glasser and James D. McMillan, National 
Renewable Energy Laboratory, Golden, CO, USA.
• What is restricting implementation of advanced biorefineries in Scandinavia? 
Ola Wallberg, Lund University, Lund, Sweden
• Using captive fiber to reduce the carbon intensity of 1st gen ethanol processes. 
Brandon Emme, Chris Gerken and Jesse Spooner, ICM, Inc, St. Joseph, MO, USA.
• Problems handling corn stover in pioneer biorefineries and proposed solutions. 
Quang A. Nguyen, Neal A. Yancey and Kevin L. Kenney, Idaho National Laboratory, 
Idaho Falls, ID, USA.
• Customized enzyme cocktails – A Novozymes update on use of tailored biocatalysts in 
the first commercial scale biorefineries Sarah Teter, Novozymes, Inc., Davis, CA, USA.
In addition, on July 12, 2017, Jim McMillan gave an overview presentation on the task at 
the Bioeconomy 2017 conference held near Washington DC, within the international plenary 
session “Catalyzing A Global Advanced Bioeconomy” organised and chaired by US ExCo 
member Jim Spaeth.
The active participation of most country team leaders and representatives at many of the 
Task 39 meetings is evidence of the value the Task 39 network plays in facilitating excellent 
international information exchange.
Work Programme
The programme-of-work for the Task included the following elements:
Technical Aspects of Advanced Biofuels
Advanced biofuels remain a topic of key importance for decarbonising the transport 
sector. The Task continues to focus on cellulosic ethanol production and commercialisation, 
however production of drop-in biofuels has become a more prominent focus in recent years 
as conversion technologies have advanced because drop-in fuels offer a direct replacement 
for petroleum fuels, requiring no changes to infrastructure.
74
The need for drop-in biofuels is especially relevant in industries such as aviation where 
no other alternatives to dramatically lowering carbon emissions exist. The Task’s “drop-in 
biofuels report” (Karaztos et al., 2014; available at Task 39 and IEA Bioenergy websites) 
and ongoing updates to this report – most recently to explore biofuels opportunities in the 
marine shipping sector – assess the potential and challenges of these advanced biofuels across 
the whole spectrum of feedstock conversion technology pathways – oleochemical, biochemical, 
thermochemical and hybrid routes to biofuels. As these technologies develop from research 
and development through to pilot, demonstration and commercialisation, Task 39 monitors 
these developments and develops update reports to disseminate information to the biofuels 
community as an objective observer to give biofuels and transport sector stakeholders, 
including governments and policy makers, the information and data necessary to support 
decision-making.
The mounting need for renewable aviation biofuels (“biojet”) to reduce emissions in the 
aviation industry is a specific area that has moved to the forefront internationally. This is 
driven by voluntary initiatives from aviation organisations, OEMs such as Boeing, as well as by 
airlines investing in new technologies and entering into offtake agreements for biojet fuels. Task 
39 has a critical role in monitoring, evaluating and reporting on developments in this sector, 
in addition to providing guidance on essential policy to foster and facilitate biojet development 
and deployment. In addition, the role of biofuels in the international shipping and marine sector 
has become important as a way of reducing emissions contributed by this industry, which is 
facing more stringent sulfur emissions regulations going forward. The most recent update 
to the drop-in biofuels report is a special report on the opportunities for biofuels for marine 
applications completed during 2017 (Hsieh and Felby, 2017; available at Task 39 website).
Briefs on reports completed or advanced during 2017 follow:
Report on “Biofuels for the marine shipping sector” (Hsieh and Felby, 2017): 
The merchant shipping sector is one of the mayor players in world trade, as more than 
80% of all goods are transported via international shipping routes. This sector annually 
consumes more than 330 Mt of fuels and accounts for 2-3% of global CO2, 4-9% of SOx, 
and 10-15% of NOx emissions. This report is written for biofuel providers and technology 
developers with the aim of providing an overview of biofuels opportunities within the shipping 
sector; the technologies, fuels and regulations associated with the supply and consumption of 
fuels for marine applications. The different biofuel technologies and their supply potentials 
are presented and discussed. The report demonstrates that significant opportunities for 
biofuels exist within this sector. Co-authored by Chia-wen Carmen Hsieh and Claus Felby of 
the University of Copenhagen and reviewed by Task 39 country representatives, this report 
was completed in late 2017 and is now available on the Task 39 website.
75
Survey on Advanced Fuels for Advanced Engines with IEA’s Advanced Motor Fuels 
TCP (AMF): This report surveys the following advanced biofuels/biofuels categories: HVO, FT 
fuels, DME, OME, methanol, lignocellulosic ethanol, Bio-LNG and LBG. The report examines 
the fuel properties of these advanced biofuels, chemical reactions among advanced fuel 
components and additives, and known health and toxicity effects. The final draft of the report 
has been reviewed and at the time of this writing the authors are incorporating the final edits 
into the report. This report is expected to become available to the public during 2018.
The Task also published some of the work from the drop-in biofuel report in a peer reviewed 
journal: (S. Karatzos, J.S. van Dyk, J.D. McMillan, J. Saddler (2017) Drop-in biofuel 
production via conventional (lipid/fatty acid) and advanced (biomass) routes. Part I – Biofuels, 
Bioproducts and Biorefining). (View online at Wiley Online Library (wileyonlinelibrary.com); 
DOI: 10.1002/bbb.1746; Biofuels, Bioprod. Bioref. (2017). Part II of this review, now in 
early draft, focuses on the potentials for refinery integration and co-processing of bio-based 
intermediates into petroleum refinery operations.
The Task continues to update its database of advanced biofuels production facilities 
(http://demoplants.bioenergy2020.eu/), and on-going activity led by Dina Bacovsky, Austria’s 
national team leader. This demoplants database provides up-to-date information on over 100 
companies’ biofuels production facilities, which encompasses a wide variety of biochemical, 
thermochemical, and hybrid conversion approaches to producing biofuels. It remains difficult to 
obtain and maintain detailed and accurate, up-to-date information from many of the companies 
as their various processing technologies scale up and approach commercialisation. It remains 
particularly challenging to closely follow the development of production facilities in countries 
such as China and India that are not (yet) part of the IEA Bioenergy network. This is part of the 
motivation for the Task’s ongoing efforts to recruit these countries to join the IEA Bioenergy TCP.
Policy, Regulatory, Infrastructure and Sustainability Issues of Biofuels
The overall objective of this component of the Task is to provide governments and policy 
makers with information that will help them identify and eliminate non-technical barriers 
to deploying liquid biofuels. The Task continues to compile country-specific information on 
biofuels development such as biofuels usage, regulations and regulatory changes, major 
changes in policies affecting the development, deployment or use of biofuels, and related items. 
At at least one Task business meeting each year, time is allocated for country representatives 
to present updates on developments in their respective countries or regions. Country report 
presentations along with the meeting minutes and other presentations from these business 
meetings are posted in the ‘members only’ section of the Task website. The Task’s periodic 
“Implementation Agendas” report update compiles all of the country specific information into 
a single document and documents recent trends in policy development, including compare and 
constrast of policy effectiveness in different global regions. This report is substantially updated 
and revised at least once per triennium. Through this effort, the Task maintains its role as a 
central source of relevant policy and regulatory information on biofuels.
76
Policy plays a key role in advancing (or hindering) the development and deployment of 
biofuels globally, and lack of stable policy in recent years has had a large detrimental impact 
on investment in and expansion of the industry. It is also clear that the aviation industry 
represents a unique sector as a highly international industry and will require a different 
policy approach to support development of biojet fuels. As biojet fuel is the only long-term 
solution for the aviation industry to meet its emission reduction targets, establishing a stable, 
commercial supply of biojet volumes has become imperative. However, even as technologies 
continue to develop and mature, strong policies at national and international levels will be 
essential to achieve this important objective.
Biofuels can play an important role in reducing emissions from transportation (air, marine 
and road transport) to meet long-term climate goals. However, not all biofuels offer the same 
emissions reduction potentials and the analysis of emission reduction potential of different 
feedstock and technology combinations has become vital to accurately assess the carbon 
intensity and sustainability of biofuels. However, lack of standardisation of assessment 
methodologies hampers this area. While many life cycle analysis (LCA) models are available, 
they often give substantially different results for the same scenario or quite similar scenarios, 
and the Task’s on-going work (joint with Task 38) in comparing LCA models and providing 
reliable information on emission reduction potential forms an essential component of 
the Task’s current trienneium plan of work. In 2016-2017, the Task initiated work to 
systematically compare and harmonise leadling LCA models being used in the EU and 
Americas via a multiple phase project being led by Antonio Bonomi, Brazil’s national team 
leader. Phase 1 of this project, which focused on assessing models for commercial ethanol 
production in the Americas and EU, was completed in 2017; peer-reviewed publications 
documenting this work are forthcoming. Phase 2 of the project will focus on assessing models 
for commercial production of biodiesel (FAME) and renewable diesel production in the 
Americas and EU, with completion targeted for later in 2018.
Newsletter
The Task published three newsletters in 2017 (Issues #45-47), profiling biofuels developments 
in Korea, China, and Africa respectively. These newsletters provide information about Task 
activities and international events related to biofuels. The newsletter has an active distribution 
list of about 2,000 individuals worldwide and copies are routinely downloaded from the 
Task website. The country (or continent) specific feature article in each newsletter provides 
a unique source of information to biofuel stakeholders worldwide and we regularly receive 
requests for permission to republish these reports in other magazines e.g. Oils and Fats.
77
Website
The Task continues to build its influence within the international community working in the 
liquid biofuels arena. The Task’s website is visited regularly and routinely receives enquires 
that are typically handled by the Task coordinators and webmaster, or referred to experts 
within the Task 39 network. Specific website statistics are reported in the Progress Reports 
submitted to ExCo.
Collaboration with Other Tasks/Networking
The Advanced Fuels in Advanced Engines project is a collaboration with IEA AMF and the 
next phase of the Comparison of GHG Models for Advanced Biofuels project is being carried 
out in conjunction with Task 38. Task 39 also has and will continue to collaborate with IEA 
HQ in updating relevant IEA reports. Task 39 also works with the International Renewable 
Energy Agency (IRENA) on reviewing of reports that are relevant to our expertise.
Deliverables
The deliverables for the Task in 2017 included: organisation of two business meetings during 
the year; two bi-annual progress reports and audited financial accounts (submitted to ExCo); 
development and maintenance of the Task 39 website; three newsletters; the update to the 
Task 39 Advanced Biofuel Demonstration Database; a completed report on “Biofuels in 
Marine and Shipping”; and completion of a final draft of the “Advanced Fuels in Advanced 
Engines” survey report. The full library of Task reports, country specific reports, etc. are 
available through the Task website (http://task39.ieabioenergy.com). These are detailed 
in the Appendix.
TASK 40: Sustainable International Bioenergy Trade: 
Securing Supply and Demand
Overview of the Task
There is increasing need to develop biomass resources and exploit biomass production 
potentials in a sustainable way and to understand what this means in different settings. 
In 2011, the European Commission started to stimulate the further development of the 
biobased economy1, which has shown promising developments in the last four years, in 
particular investments in technological innovation in several member countries. However, 
more efforts still need to be made in the establishment of European standards and the 
related certification of biobased products. The UNFCCC Conference of the Parties, or COP 21 
1 http://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/PDF/?uri=CELEX:52012DC0060&from=EN 
78
has come up with historical decisions2 to reaffirm the goal of limiting global temperature 
increase to well below 2 degrees Celsius and to establish binding commitments by all parties 
to make nationally determined contributions as well as to pursue domestic measures aimed 
at achieving them. The European Union (EU) has committed at the end of 2016 to cut 
GHG emissions by at least 40% by 20303 (from 20% in 2020) while modernising the EU’s 
economy and delivering jobs and growth for all European citizens as well as achieving global 
leadership in renewable energies.
In view of these perspectives, biomass markets have possibilities to grow, although, they 
are still immature and vulnerable. Many biomass markets, e.g. solid biofuels, rely on policy 
support and incentives. Currently, negotiations are ongoing in the EU between parliament, 
council and commission on the sustainability requirements of various forms of bioenergy. 
The outcome of these negotiations will to a large extent determine the future of biomass 
deployment in general, and also affect the possibilities to trade biomass internationally. At 
the same time, a recent meta-analysis of scenarios of integrated assessment models (co-
authored by Task 40 members4) shows that substantial deployment and trade of both solid 
and liquid biomass will be required to meet stringent targets to limit global temperature 
increase to below 2 degrees. Therefore, it is important to develop both supply and demand 
for biomass, and energy carriers derived from biomass, in a balanced way and to avoid 
distortions and instability that can threaten much-needed investments in biomass production, 
and infrastructure and conversion capacity. Understanding how this is best organised 
and managed needs further investigation. International biomass markets (industrial and 
residential) have been mapped and assessment of technological development and policy 
effects has also been carried out by Task 40. The analyses, statistics, and modelling exercises 
undertaken so far still have some limitations.
The core objective of the Task is ‘to support the development of a sustainable, international, 
bioenergy market, recognising the diversity in resources, and biomass applications’. Developing 
a sustainable and stable, international, bioenergy market is a long-term process. The Task 
aims to provide a vital contribution to policy making decisions by market players, policy 
makers, international bodies, and NGO’s. It does this by providing high quality information 
and analyses, and overviews of developments. It will also provide a link between different 
sectors, and act as a clearing-house for information through targeted dissemination activities.
The Task Leaders direct and manage the work programme. National Team Leaders from each 
country are responsible for coordinating the national participation in the Task.

Progress in R&D
Task Meetings and Workshops
The Task organised two Task meetings in 2017: Task 40 meetings were held in Copenhagen 
in May and in London in October respectively. The meeting programme, study reports and 
updates are provided at the dedicated page for Task 40 members under Task 40 website 
http://task40.ieabioenergy.com/.
Future Meetings and Workshops
On 12-13th March 2018, Task 40 will organise an internal meeting in Brussels, Belgium. 
At the end-of-triennium IEA Bioenergy conference, Task 40 will have another Task meeting in 
San Francisco in early November 2018. On the 7th November, IEA Bioenergy will organise a 
conference with the involvements of all committed Tasks. Task 40 is proposed to lead sections 
1 and 3 (with contributions from other Task members of 38 and 43) on Biomass mobilisation 
& sustainability governance. In addition, Task 40 members are –as part of the inert-task 
project on sustainable bioenergy supply chains – organising workshops at two conferences 
in April and May 2018, both in Copenhagen. We are also currently still exploring the option 
to organise a short session to inform members of the European parliament about the work 
of Task 40 on biomass sustainability.
80
Work Programme and Outputs
As outlined in the 2013-2015 work programme, the core objective of the Task is: 
‘to support the development of sustainable, international bioenergy markets and international 
trade, recognising the diversity in resources and biomass applications’. The work programme 
in the 2016-2018 period consists of the following five topics:
1. Mobilisation of sustainable biomass resources for the international market 
across different regions in the world.
2. Analysis of the future market demand for biomass from the broader biobased 
economy perspective.
3. Sustainability and certification.
4. Support of business model development for biomass supply and value chains.
5. Assisting the development and deployment of advanced analysis tools to improve 
the understanding of potential future market developments, implications and impacts 
of policies.
Regarding the budget, Task 40 has received a higher budget than originally anticipated 
(as a result of a higher number of countries participating in the Task). The current budget 
is distributed to carry out the on-going and proposed studies. The 2017 budget closure has 
a surplus of about $186,000. However, a large part of this budget will be earmarked for 
the Inter-tasks Sustainability project in 2018.
In 2017, the Task has participated in two IEA Bioenergy webinars and published two reports. 
The webinars The European Wood Pellet For Small-Scaling Heating and The Hotspots 
of the Global Wood Pellet Industry and Trade 2017 have reached a broad audience and 
received positive feedbacks from stakeholders attending the events. The two published reports 
are Socio-economic assessment of forestry production for a developing pellet sector: The 
case of Santa Catarina in Brazil and The Global Wood Pellet Industry and Trade Study 
2017. All reports and webinar presentations are available for free download from the Task 
40 website http://task40.ieabioenergy.com/.
Report: Socio-economic assessment of forestry production for a developing pellet sector: 
The case of Santa Catarina in Brazil.
Improvement of socio-economic conditions is a relevant goal for the further development 
of biomass and bioenergy production and trade. The production of woody biomass depends 
mostly on forestry related sectors. This report assesses the forestry sector in a part of 
Brazil, which has grown strongly and shows positive socioeconomic developments, explained 
by the close relationship between the forestry industry and the local communities. Selected 
criteria, index and indicators to assess the socio-economic impacts were applied in a selected 
region in Santa Catarina, Brazil. Data was gathered from industry and government sources 
and combined with primary data gathered from in-depth interviews and visits to the region. 
The results show that in Santa Catarina, there is availability of resources from the forestry 
production, but the pellet production sector is yet only developing and mainly for regional 
81
use. From a socio-economic point of view, the research has shown that the wood and 
forest sector plays a crucial role in the Lages region, through jobs and income creation, by 
contributing to local GDP, and other multiplier effects on the local economy.
Report: Global Wood Pellet Industry and Trade study 2017
The Global Wood Pellet Industry and Trade study 2017 provides a comprehensive overview 
of wood pellet markets in over 30 countries, providing information on regulatory frameworks, 
production capacities, consumption and price trends, trade, logistics and country specific 
standardisation aspects. The global wood pellet market has increased dramatically since 
2011, with an average increase rate of 14% per year. New countries have entered the market 
for both pellet production (such as those from South-East Europe) and pellet consumption 
(such as East Asia). Also the global wood pellet trade increased. Intercontinental flows are 
dominated by the trade relation between the U.S. and the UK, while the non-industrial use 
is still mainly an intra-European business.
On-going and New Topics (2017-2018)
The projects listed below are all currently ongoing and will be finalised over the course 
of 2017 or in early 2018.
• Socio-economic assessment of the US supply chains of imported biomass (pellets) 
to the EU: The EU objectives to reduce emissions under the Renewable Energy 
Directive (RED) (EC, 2009) and the objectives of pushing forward the green economy 
in the EU have indicated that biomass exports for electricity, heat and biomaterials is 
expected to increase in the next 20 years. There are only a few studies conducted to 
better understand the socio-economic implications of biomass production and use for 
specific supply chains feeding the European market and, in particular, assessing the 
impacts on smallholders or on communities. To tackle this knowledge gap, this report 
proposed to conduct a detailed assessment of socio-economic impacts of the biomass 
production and conversion supply chain with the EU biomass market target. Two case 
studies have been developed: one for Brazil, a potential supplier of solid biomass, and 
the other for the US, which is the largest exporter to the EU. The Brazilian case study 
has already been published and the US case study will be soon finalised. A framework 
to conduct the study had been developed and an assessment of the socio-economic 
impacts based on previous work was conducted by the researchers.
• Transboundary flows of biomass waste streams: Martin Junginger, Daniela Thrän, 
Olle Olsson, Jussi Heinimö and the MSc student Pranav Dadhich have written the 
report investigating how much solid (biomass) waste feedstock is being transported 
for energy purposes around Europe in the years of 2010-2015, and the underlying 
drivers, incentives and implications. Currently the report is being further developed 
and a future outlook is considered. Also the current country-specific sections need 
to be further reviewed. The final report is planned to be published in mid 2018.
82
• Global biomass trade for energy: Svetlana Proskurina has led an effort to update 
global biomass trade statistics, which has resulted in two scientific publications in 
the journal BioFPR (accepted for publication in 2018) with Task 40 co-authors 
Martin Junginger and Jussi Heinimö. The two papers deal with 1) statistical and 
methodological considerations and 2) production and trade streams of wood 
pellets, liquid biofuels, industrial roundwood and emerging energy biomass.
Task 40 members are also preparing a final proposal for a study on the marginal potential 
for long-term sustainable/viable wood pellet supply chains. This study will be carried out over 
the course of 2018.
Website
The website http://task40.ieabioenergy.com/ has been officially launched since September 
2016 and it is now under the management of IEA Bioenergy organisation. The trademark 
bioenergytrade.org is planned to be retained in the upcoming 10 year period. The Task website 
is a key tool for dissemination of information. In 2017, the average number of unique visitors 
was about 1,400 per month, similar to the number of visitors in the previous years.
Regarding the top downloaded 10 documents, the updated Global Wood Pellet Industry and 
Trade Study 2017 is ranked the top report of the Task 40 readers. The top 10 downloads in 
2017 (until 31 December) are presented below and it can be concluded that Task 40 readers 
are interested by Task studies on biomass trade and technological development for processing 
biomass.
83
Collaboration with Other Tasks/Networking
Collaboration with both IEA Bioenergy Tasks and external partners is important, therefore 
the Task has been continuing this effort in 2017. The Intertask Sustainability project has been 
running since January 2016 with various IEA Bioenergy Tasks including Task 40 members. 
Under the lead of Task 40, this InterTasks project has brought together and synthesises 
part of the work done by the individual Tasks. Preliminary results of the InterTasks were 
presented in an international workshop in Gothenburg, Sweden in May 2017. Final results of 
the Intertask will be presented in an international conference in San Francisco in November 
2018 and several other conferences. Also, a high number of scientific articles have already 
been published as project outcomes.
Deliverables
Deliverables in 2017 included two webinars, two main reports, one newsletter 
(circulation to 1500 subscribers), minutes from two Task meetings, two progress reports 
and audited accounts to the ExCo. These are detailed in Appendix 4.
84
TASK 41: Bioenergy Systems Analysis
Overview of the Task
The objective of the Task is to supply various categories of decision makers with scientifically 
sound and politically unbiased analyses needed for strategic decisions related to research 
or policy issues. The target groups are particularly decision makers in Ministries, national 
or local administrations, deploying agencies, etc. Depending on the character of the projects 
some deliverables are also expected to be of direct interest to industry stakeholders. Decision 
makers, both public and private, have to consider many aspects, so the Task needs to cover 
technical, economic, and environmental data in its work. The Task’s activities build upon 
existing data, information sources, and conclusions. It does not intend to produce new 
primary scientific data.
The Task differs from the other Tasks in that it does not have networking as one of its 
prime objectives, nor do the Task’s activities have continuous and repeating components, 
e.g., biannual meetings, country updates, etc. The work programme has a pronounced project 
emphasis with each project having very specific and closely defined objectives. Because of 
its special character in terms of participation, financing and cross-cutting orientation, the 
Task aims to be a valuable resource and instrument to the ExCo serving the ExCo with 
highly qualified resources to carry out projects, involving several parties (e.g., other Tasks 
and organisations) as requested by the ExCo. Due to the close contact with the other Tasks, 
Task 41 is intended to develop into a platform for joint Task work and a catalyst for proposals 
from the Tasks to the ExCo.
A project leader directs and manages the work of each project. For new projects an 
appropriate project leader is appointed by the project participants acting through the 
Executive Committee. The ExCo Member from each participating country acts as the national 
Team Leader and is responsible for coordinating national input to the projects undertaken.
For further details on Task 41, please refer to Appendices 2, 4 and 5; and the IEA Bioenergy 
website www.ieabioenergy.com under ‘our Work: Tasks’.
85
Progress in R&D
Work Programme
The work programme is comprised of a series of projects. Each project has its own budget, work 
description, timeframe, and deliverables and is approved by the participants. The focus is on the 
needs of the participants by way of project outputs. Four projects were active in 2017 as follows:
Project 5: Bio-CCS and Bio-CCUS in Climate Change Mitigation
This two-year special project has been set up in order to fully define concepts of Bio-CCS 
and Bio-CCU, and to define their realistic significance in the medium and long term. Two 
workshops were held in 2016 and one was held in 2017 (http://task41project5.ieabioenergy.
com/iea-publications/). One final workshop will be held in 2018 prior to project completion 
with a final report.
Participating countries: The European Commission, Finland, The Netherlands and Norway
Status: Expected completion in 1st quarter of 2018
Project 6: Bioenergy in balancing the grid and providing storage options
This project aimed to identify those areas in the grid system where bioenergy in 
balancing the grid and providing storage options could play a strategic role, and to 
promote the commercialisation of a diverse set of such bioenergy applications and 
processes. In addition, it sought to identify and disseminate sound business models for 
practical, cost-effective and environmentally friendly ways to facilitate the transformation 
of the electricity grid based to a large extent on bioenergy technologies.
Participating countries: The European Commission and Finland
Status: The project has been completed with the publication of a final report in February 
2017 – see http://www.ieabioenergy.com/publications/bioenergys-role-in-balancing-the-
electricity-grid-and-providing-storage-options-an-eu-perspective/
Project 7: Bioenergy RES Hybrids
This one-year project (http://task41project7.ieabioenergy.com/iea-publications/) looked at 
some of the ways that bioenergy could be integrated with other renewable energy sources 
to achieve one or more of flexible generation, flexible storage of variable renewable energy 
(VRE) and increased overall efficiency of biomass use. The project developed a series of key 
findings for domestic applications, utility scale and district heating and cooling networks, 
industry and farm scale applications.
Participating countries: Austria, the European Commission, Finland and Germany
Status: The project has been completed with the publication of a final report in April 2017 – 
see http://www.ieabioenergy.com/publications/integrated-bioenergy-hybrids-flexible-renewable-
energy-solutions/
86
Project 8: Bioenergy Roadmap 2017
This one-year project involved the development of a roadmap on Bioenergy of the IEA 
Secretariat and the IEA Bioenergy Technology Collaboration Programme. The aim was to 
produce a single roadmap encompassing bioenergy for transport, heat and power. This would 
allow a holistic approach taking account of the fact that some of the key issues around 
feedstock availability and sustainability were relevant for all sectors.
Participating countries: European Commission and The Netherlands
Status: The project has been completed with the publication of a final report in November 
2017 – see http://www.ieabioenergy.com/publications/technology-roadmap-delivering-

TASK 42: Biorefining in a Future BioEconomy
www.iea-bioenergy.task42-biorefineries.com
Overview of the Task
Biorefining in the Circular Economy & BioEconomy
Biorefining, the sustainable processing of biomass into a range of marketable biobased 
products and bioenergy/biofuels, is an innovative and efficient approach to use available biomass 
resources for the synergistic co-production of power, heat and biofuels alongside food and feed 
ingredients, pharmaceuticals, chemicals, materials, minerals and short-cyclic CO2.
The Circular Economy is defined as an economy that is restorative and regenerative 
by design, and which aims to keep products, components and materials at their highest 
utility and value at all times, distinguishing between technical and biological-cycles [Ellen 
MacArthur Foundation]. The Circular Economy mainly focuses on the efficient use of finite 
resources and ensures that these resources are reused as long as possible. Biorefining is 
one of the key enabling strategies of the Circular Economy, closing loops of raw biomass 
materials (re-use of agro-, process- and post-consumer residues), minerals, water and carbon. 
Therefore, biorefining is the optimal strategy for large-scale sustainable use of biomass in 
the BioEconomy. It will result in cost-competitive co-production of food/feed ingredients, 
biobased products and bioenergy combined with optimal socio-economic and environmental 
impacts (efficient use of resources, reduced GHG emissions, etc.).
87

Circular Economy [IEA Bioenergy Task42].
Biorefineries – current status and expected developments
Biorefining is not a fully new approach. Thousands of years ago the production of vegetable 
oils, beer and wine already required pre-treatment, separation and conversion steps; whereas 
paper production started around 100 AD. Industrial conventional biorefineries are currently 
still mainly found in the food and paper sectors.
Within recently constructed biorefineries, bioenergy/biofuel based facilities are more common. 
In these, heat, power and biofuels are the main products, and both agro and process residues 
are used to produce additional biobased products. In product based biorefineries, higher-value 
food and feed ingredients, pharmaceuticals, chemicals, fibrous materials (e.g. pulp, paper) 
and/or fertilisers are the main products, with low-quality agro and process residues used for 
the production of bioenergy and less commonly, biofuels. Product based biorefineries are 
mainly found in the food, feed and dairy, and pulp and paper industries at the current time.
Assessing the number of biorefinery facilities currently in operation globally is 
challenging. However, over 100 commercial, demonstration and pilot facilities have been 
identified in the participating countries (www.task42.ieabioenergy.com); whereas in 2017 
over 220 facilities have been identified Europe-wide by Nova Institut (GER) and the 
European Biobased Industries Consortium (more information, see: www.biconsortium.eu).
5 BioEconomy (BE): An economy that encompasses the production of renewable biological resources and 
their conversion into food, feed, fibres, materials, chemicals, fuels, energy and minerals through efficient and 
innovative technologies [European BioEconomy Alliance]. The Biobased Economy (BbE) is the BE without 
the food/feed sectors.
88
Figure 2. Biorefineries in Europe 2017 [Nova Institute/BIC, 2017].
It is expected that within the next 10-20 years the use of biomass for non-food/feed 
applications will shift from an energy to a more product-based approach. However, over the 
longer-term part of the biomass resources is still expected to be used for the production of 
advanced biofuels for transport (heavy duty road transport, aviation and shipping).
In the short-term (up to 2025) advanced biorefineries may be introduced in a variety 
of market sectors, mainly by means of upgrading of existing infrastructures, reducing both 
initial investment costs and the time-to-market. Bioenergy will play both an initiating and 
central role for the market deployment of these advanced biorefineries:
• Certified sustainable biocommodities that are now being developed and mobilised 
for energy applications in the mid/longer-term will also be available as raw materials 
for the biorefinery facilities ensuring sustainable biomass supply.
89
• Industrial bio-transportation fuel production facilities and digestion facilities can 
be further upgraded to integrated biorefineries co-producing fuels and added-value 
biobased products to optimise their overall sustainability, i.e. increase their financial 
market competitiveness.
• Low-quality value chain residues, i.e. residues that cannot be reused for added-value 
applications in an economically attractive way, like agro-residues, process residues 
and post-consumer residues, will be used for bioenergy production.
A portfolio of new biorefining concepts – i.e. whole crop biorefineries, lignocellulosic feedstock 
biorefineries, oleo-chemical biorefineries, green biorefineries, thermochemical biorefineries, 
micro and macro algae (marine) biorefineries and next generation hydrocarbon biorefineries – 
is currently being developed. These concepts are expected to be implemented into the market 
in the medium-term (2025-2030). However, the current economic conditions (low oil price, 
credit crisis, recessions in part of the world) might cause severe delays in their market 
deployment.
A very important non-technical barrier for the market deployment of product-based 
biorefineries is the availability of sufficient amounts of sustainable biomass resources. 
Product-based biorefineries can accelerate their market deployment by using both the 
certification expertise and logistical infrastructures that are currently being developed 
and set-up for the use of sustainable biobased commodities for energy purposes.
Towards 2050, the portfolio of product based biorefinery concepts could expand further. 
Lignocellulosic feedstock, herbaceous (green), oleo-chemical and marine (microalgae and 
seaweeds) biorefineries may enter the market. However, expansion will require further 
technology development as product-based biorefinery facilities are generally less technically 
mature than bioenergy/biofuel alternatives. In addition, current policy support is more 
favourable towards bioenergy and biofuels than the production of biobased products. 
As such, facilitating the market development of product-based biorefineries is likely 
to require more widespread policy frameworks to support biobased products.
However, since such materials are generally higher-value products than bioenergy and biofuels, 
expanding markets for biobased products will be a key factor in product-driven refinery 
expansion. Initiatives to support industry development include: a Biorefineries Roadmap in 
Germany in 2012, a Strategic Biomass Vision 2030 in the Netherlands, and ongoing funding 
for innovative biorefinery projects from the US Department of Energy (DOE). Deployment 
in Europe should be boosted by the Bio-Based Industries Joint Undertaking, a partnership 
between the European Union and the private sector to invest USD 4.1 billion in innovative 
technologies and biorefineries to produce biobased products from biomass wastes and 
residues. In addition, the European Commission’s Circular Economy package includes biomass 
and biobased products as a priority sector and outlines the promotion of support to innovation 
in the BioEconomy.
90
Bioenergy markets will play a central role in facilitating the growth of product based 
biorefineries through the development of sustainability certification processes and biomass 
fuel and feedstock supply chains. In addition, biofuel and biogas plants offer potential 
for upgraded and integrated biorefineries co-producing fuels and added-value biobased 
products, with such facilities benefiting from diversified product streams and increased 
market competitiveness. Furthermore, even in the context of wider deployment of product 
based biorefineries, lower-value biomass feedstock, such as agricultural and post-consumer 
residues that are less suitable for economic biobased product manufacture are likely to 
remain destined for bioenergy markets.
Aim of IEA Bioenergy Task 42 – Biorefining in a future BioEconomy
The aim is to facilitate the commercialisation and market deployment of environmentally 
sound, socially acceptable, and cost-competitive biorefinery systems and technologies, and 
to advise policy and industrial decision makers accordingly. Task42 provides an international 
platform for collaboration and information exchange between industry, SMEs, GOs, NGOs, 
RTOs and universities concerning biorefinery research, development, demonstration and 
policy analysis. This includes the development of networks, dissemination of information, and 
provision of science-based technology analysis, as well as support and advice to policy makers, 
involvement of industry, and encouragement of membership by countries with a strong 
biorefinery infrastructure and appropriate policies. Gaps and barriers to deployment will be 
addressed to successfully promote sustainable biorefinery systems market implementation.
91
Challenges to be tackled
• Develop industry legitimacy, including social acceptance and a level-playing 
field, for sustainable biomass use.
• Global sustainable biomass sourcing and development of an international trading 
market, incl. the development of biocommodities.
• Internalisation of externalities (CO2-price).
• Multi-sectorial stakeholder involvement in the deployment of sustainable value 
chains, incl. industrial symbiosis of full sustainable biomass use for Food and Non-food, 
and improved communication (still separate languages food/non-food and cultivation/
processing).
• Technology development and biorefinery scale-up using best practices, 
i.e. for lignocellulosic-based biorefineries, herbaceous and aquatic biomass 
based biorefineries, protein-based biorefineries, food/non-food flexible biorefineries, 
mobile/decentralised biorefineries, integral Bio Industrial Complexes, etc.
• Unlock available expertise and industrial infrastructure energy/fuel, agro/food, 
material and chemical manufacturing sectors.
• Standardisation/regulation of biobased products (BBPs).
• Develop the necessary human capital by training students and other stakeholders 
to become the biorefinery experts of tomorrow

Workshop “The role of industrial biorefineries in al low-carbon economy” 
– Gothenburg, Sweden
This workshop was organised on the 16th of May by the Technology Collaboration 
Programmes IEA Bioenergy Task 42 and IEA IETS, and hosted by Chalmers University 
of Technology and the Swedish Energy Agency. The workshop covered both strategic 
biorefinery developments and how to overcome deployment barriers. All workshop 
introducing slide-decks are available for downloading at the website of Task 42.

Figure 4. Joint IEA Bioenergy Task 42/IETS workshop on Industrial Biorefineries in Gothenburg, Sweden
The results of the Workshop were reported on by the Technical Coordinator of IEA Bioenergy 
in cooperation with IEA IETS, and the coordinator of Task 42, and the final report is 
available at the Task 42 website. The major messages resulting from this workshop are:
1. IEA scenario calculations have shown that efficient and sustainable use of biomass 
will be the key driver to reach 2050-2060 GHG-emission reduction targets, 
and the uptake of biorefineries at industrial level will be required to achieve this.
2. Co-production of biobased products and bioenergy by industrial symbioses can 
have the highest impact on both meeting the climatic goals and economic growth.
3. Both governmental facilitation, communication and education will be needed to support 
large-scale market deployment.

Biorefinery Systems – Analysis and assessment of biorefining in the whole value chain
The Biorefinery Expert System [D1] is currently being developed by the University of Graz 
(AT) with the input of all Task 42 NTLs. A full draft version of the system is currently in 
operation, and will be used in 2017 to deliver some case-study based Biorefinery Fact Sheets 
[D2]. Both a report describing the system and the factsheets will be put on the Task 42 
website for further dissemination in 2018. The Canadian NTL (CanmetENERGY, Natural 
Resources Canada) has developed a TEE-assessment tool at a national level, that can be 
used for the assessment of biorefineries in the pulp and paper section (more information: 
eric.soucy@canada.ca). Concerning upgrading of industrial infrastructures to integrated 
biorefineries [D3], due to time and budget constraints, in this triennium the activity will be 
limited to the Gothenburg workshop co-organised with IEA IETS. This subject will be further 
picked-up in the 2019 – 2021 work programme, probably in close collaboration with IEA 
IETS.
98
Product Quality – Reporting on related biobased products/bioenergy standardisation, 
certification and policy activities at national, European and global levels
The international developments in biomass standardisation and certification are monitored 
in this triennium by our German NTL. The results are reported in slide-decks that are made 
available at the Task 42 website. During 2018 the information in the slide-decks of 2016-
2018 will be assessed and reported in a short summarising report.
Concerning the assessment of the role of bioenergy and biorefining in a Circular Economy 
[D5] the workshop in Brussels in September 2017 was organised, where representatives of 
IEA Bioenergy, FAO, OECD, EERA Bioenergy, ETIP Bioenergy, IRENA, JRC, and DOE were 
invited to present their views and activities in this field (slides see Task 42 website). A further 
event is expected to be organised linked to EUBCE2018 in Copenhagen (Denmark) to further 
inform each other on running activities, and to identify activities to be performed together.
Further, Task 42 (German NTL) participates as an observer in the Joint Tasks Project on 
Sustainable Supply Chains [D6], bringing in biobased products related data, wherever needed.
Evolving BioEconomy – Analysing and advising on perspectives of biorefining 
in a Circular BioEconomy
Together with EC DG JRC and the EU BBI JTU, our Italian NTL (ENEA) has set-up and 
distributed a questionnaire to monitor the evolving BioEconomy worldwide. Reactions are 
currently being assessed by these parties. Based on the replies, ENEA will analyse the current 
deployment of biorefineries within this frame work, and will come-up with a summarising 
report [D7], that will be made available at the Task 42 website, in the 1st half of 2018.
No activities dealing with Biorefinery Success Stories [D8] took place in 2017.
Communication, Dissemination and Training – Knowledge exchange by stakeholder 
consultation, reporting and lecturing
Updated extensive Country Reports [D9] were produced by Australia, Germany and the US, 
and are available for downloading from the Task 42 website. The others will come-up with 
updated ones in 2018.
Concerning Task 42 Reports, the report on Proteins for Food/Feed and Industrial 
Applications [D11] was delivered in 2016, the report on Biobased Fibrous Materials [D12] 
is ready in draft and will be made available in March 2018, and the report on Biobased 
Chemicals [D10] (update) will be prepared and published in 2018.
Other Task-related information (brochures, leaflets, newsletters, papers etc.) are available 
at the Task 42 website: www.task42.ieabioenergy.com.
99
Collaboration with Other Tasks/Networking
Within this 2016-2018 triennium the following collaborations were foreseen:
• Biorefinery expert system development: EC DG JRC; no cooperation yet
• Biorefinery factsheets: T34 (liquefaction), Task 37 (biogas), Task 39 (biofuels), ongoing
• Role of Bioenergy in Circular Economy: Task 36 (solid waste management); EERA 
Bioenergy, ETIP Bioenergy etc., ongoing
• BioEconomy Monitoring: FAO, OECD, EC DG JRC, ongoing
• Sustainable supply chains: Task 40 coordinated JTP, ongoing
• Biorefinery Success Stories: Task 40 coordinated JTP, no cooperation yet
• Biorefinery Country Reporting: IEA Bioenergy/Energy 2020+, ongoing
• Thematic Stakeholder Workshops: Industrial Biorefineries (IEA-IETS), finalised
Earlier this triennium, a joint analysis brought together 
expertise from three IEA Bioenergy Tasks, namely Task 34 
on Pyrolysis, Task 40 on International Trade and Markets, 
and Task 42 on Biorefineries. The underlying hypothesis 
of the work was that BioEconomy Market Developments 
potentially can benefit from lessons learned and developments 
observed in modern bioenergy markets. The question was not 
only how the BioEconomy can be developed, but also how 
it can be developed sustainably in terms of economic and 
environmental concerns. The results of this analysis resulted 
in the book “Developing the Global BioEconomy”. Both the 
conclusions and book ordering details can be found at the 
IEA Task 42 website.

TASK 43: Biomass Feedstocks for Energy Markets
Overview of the Task
The work of the Task in the current triennium addresses issues critical to mobilising 
sustainable bioenergy supply chains, including all aspects of feedstock production, its markets 
and environmental, social and economic impacts. The objective is to promote sound bioenergy 
development that is driven by well-informed decisions by land owners, businesses, governments 
and others. This is achieved by collecting, analysing, and sharing technical and non-technical 
information related to biomass feedstock supply and providing relevant actors with timely 
and topical analyses, syntheses and information.
The Task has a global scope and includes commercial, near-commercial and promising 
feedstock production systems in agriculture and forestry. The primary focus is on land use 
and land management of biomass production systems. The Task work builds upon the work of 
the previous triennium and seeks new opportunities for collaboration with other Tasks as well 
as organisations outside IEA Bioenergy. The Task also interacts with other research networks 
and programmes that have workplans in the same areas.
Participating countries (as in Dec 2017): Australia, Belgium, Canada, Croatia, Denmark, 
European Commission, Finland, Germany, Ireland, the Netherlands, Norway, Sweden, and 
the USA
Task Leader: Associate Professor Ioannis Dimitriou, Swedish University of Agricultural 
Sciences, Sweden
Work Package leaders: Göran Berndes, Chalmers University of Technology; Mark 
Brown, University of the Sunshine Coast; Hans Langeveld, Bioenergy Research; Tat Smith, 
University of Toronto
Task Secretary: Assistant Professor Sally Krigstin, University of Toronto, Canada
Operating Agent: Dr Åsa Forsum, Swedish Energy Agency, Sweden
The Task leader, together with the Work Package (WP) leaders, manages the work of the 
Task. A Steering Committee (SC), consisting of the Task Leader, WP leaders and the National 
Team Leaders (NTLs), is responsible for reviewing progress and making overall priorities. 
Each NTL forms a national team of experts that support the NTL in making national 
contributions to the collaboration. Other associated experts are also involved.

Work Programme
The objective of the Task work is to promote sound bioenergy development that is driven 
by well-informed decisions by land owners, businesses, governments and others. This will 
be achieved by collecting, analysing, and sharing technical and non-technical information 
related to biomass feedstock supply and providing relevant actors with timely and topical 
analyses, syntheses and information. The work of the Task addresses issues critical 
to mobilising sustainable bioenergy supply chains, including all aspects of feedstock 
production, its markets and environmental, social and economic impacts.
Studies integrating several disciplines are conducted to analyse trade-offs, compatibility 
and synergies between food, fibre and energy production systems and the bio-economy. 
The Work Programme is organised in three WPs that are each organised in a set of Task 
Activities. Research priorities include Landscape management and design for bioenergy 
and the bio-economy (WP1); Developing effective supply chains for sustainable bioenergy 
deployment (WP2); Governance sustainability of bioenergy supply chains (WP3). The Task 
also participates in three strategic inter-Task projects run in the 2016-2018 triennium: i) 
Measuring, governing and gaining support for sustainable bioenergy supply chains; ii) Fuel 
pretreatment of biomass residues in the supply chain for thermal conversion; iii) Bioenergy 
Success Stories.
The three WPs represent the main elements to achieve the general Task objectives. Specific 
focus areas and associated work and activities have been outlined within each WP. Topics 
addressed are critical for deployment of sustainable biomass supply chains and many are 
relevant for more than one WP as exemplified in the following figure:
103
WP1 aims at supporting landscape management and design for bioenergy and the bio-
economy, by expanding the knowledge base required for sustainable expansion of biomass 
production systems that also contribute positively to biodiversity and the generation of other 
ecosystem services. The work takes a landscape level approach to deployment of biomass 
production for bioenergy and integration of this objective with ownership and societal 
objectives for existing land use and associated systems. The WP activities address the below 
overarching questions, which are relevant for both agricultural and forestry systems and 
reflect that agriculture and forestry activities often co-exist and shape the landscape together.
Which are the most suitable areas for production and/or extraction of various biomass 
feedstocks? How can biomass feedstock production systems be located, designed and 
managed to increase resource use efficiency, avoid/mitigate negative and promote positive 
environmental, economic, and social effects? How can outcomes be optimised to meet the 
goals of individual stakeholders and society as a whole, including environmental, economic, 
and social goals? How can analysis and assessment inform participatory processes engaging 
land owners, policy makers, and other stakeholders in further developing and re-defining goals 
and plans for landscape management and designs?
A number of feedstock systems and landscapes are analysed and compared with each other 
and with relevant reference systems, e.g., cultivation of conventional food/feed crops and 
forest management to produce saw timber and pulpwood. The feedstock alternatives, their 
location in the landscape, and the needed management systems vary in how they perform 
relative to different stakeholder objectives (e.g., biomass yields, economy, nutrient use 
efficiency, energy efficiency, water quality, soil quality, biodiversity and GHG balances). 
Comparison with stakeholders’ preferences, existing guidelines and regulations will help 
clarify benefits and trade-offs related to choices and alternatives.
The aim of WP2 is to identify opportunities, strategies and practices for improved supply 
chains and supply chain technology to support large-scale bioenergy deployment. WP2 
synthesises and advances state-of-the-art knowledge on biomass supply chains to increase 
understanding, development and deployment of effective, efficient and sustainable biomass 
production, harvest, and delivery options. The roles of technologies and of logistics and other 
management aspects are analysed in varying regulatory and policy contexts. Particular 
attention is given to integration and interaction between biomass supply chains and the 
operating and regulatory environment in which they are set, and how that impacts the 
efficient, sustainable production and use of the biomass resource. The WP is organised around 
four main activities: Biomass resource assessment and system mapping; technology learning 
and systems mapping; integration of natural resources and energy systems; and integration 
of biomass supply chains with existing forest and agricultural supply chains.
The aim of WP3 is to identify how public or private regulatory systems governing the 
sustainability of land use and bioenergy supply chains can be improved in terms of abilities to 
monitor, assess and promote the achievement of economic, social, and environmental goals while 
104
considering the perspectives of land owners, biomass users, and the society as a whole. WP3 
examines the interactions among sustainability governance, bioenergy supply chain deployment 
and climate change. WP3 uses field research, modelling, reviews, syntheses of scientific 
knowledge, assessments of existing and emerging governance systems, and surveys to determine 
the views and experiences of different stakeholder groups with sustainability governance. The 
work intends to inform development of governance from local to international levels, and 
focuses on the following activities: Improving legitimacy, including effectiveness and efficiency, 
of governance developed to address sustainability of biomass and bioenergy at different scales; 
advancing governance mechanisms and science-based assessment of GHG balances and climate 
effects of LULUCF activities associated with biomass and bioenergy systems.
The work within the different WPs is interrelated and conducted in close co-operation with 
the WPs; findings in activities of one WP affect the baselines of other activities and therefore 
close collaboration is a prerequisite to successfully tackle the great number of open questions 
that the Task has identified and aims to answer.
Website
The Task website (http://task43.ieabioenergy.com/) has been updated in line with changes of 
the IEA Bioenergy website. Extensive information concerning the Task 43 work is available 
and updated constantly.
Collaboration with Other Tasks/Networking
As mentioned above, Task 43 is involved in three Inter-task projects: i) Measuring, 
governing and gaining support for sustainable bioenergy supply chains (Leader: Martin 
Junginger, Task 40), Bioenergy success stories (Leader: Uwe Fritsche, Task 40); Fuel 
pretreatment of biomass residues in the supply chain for thermal conversion (Leader: Jaap 
Koppejan, Task 32). Concerning the inter-Task project “Measuring…” Göran Berndes (Task 
43) and Annette Cowie (Task 38) coordinate the work of Objective 1 while Tat Smith and 
Inge Stupak (both Task 43) coordinate the work of Objective 2. Several Task 43 members 
(including Biljana Kulisic and Ioannis Dimitriou) are involved in the work of Objective 3. In 
the “Pretreatment” intertask, there will be involvement of Task 43 collaborators in two sub-
case studies: Wolter Elbersen in ag-residues leaching and potential, and Antti Asikainen and 
Évelyne Thiffault in forest residues.
There has been extensive collaboration with GBEP-AG6 on Bioenergy and Water and Task 
43; one workshop and one webinar in collaboration with GBEP-AG6 have taken place in 
2017 and further activities in 2018 are planned. Göran Berndes (WP1 leader) serves as 
chair of AG6 and several other Task 43 members are also engaged in AG6.
The collaboration of Task 43 with FAO is developing in several levels: the Bioenergy 
and Food Security (BEFS RA) division at FAO has been invited and participated in 
105
our workshops aiming at closer collaboration e.g. on sustainability assessment issues, and 
discussions in order to co-organise a workshop with FAO in the third or fourth quarter of 
2018 have been taken place during 2017 (with Olivier Dubois).
Task 43 has been collaborating with several networks worldwide who are engaged in the 
same topics and has co-organised several events in 2017 (see list above) which resulted in 
several publications (see list below). Collaboration with the Biofuelnet Canada community 
has occurred during the workshop with Grebe, and the ambition is to continue with this 
co-operation in the future. The same is valid for Task 43’s co-operation with USDA-FS, Oak 
Ridge National Laboratory and other National Labs and their collaborating organisations, 
with several common activities planned in the coming years that address topics that 
are central for Task 43 and collaboration plans are discussed. An example is Task 43’s 
collaboration with the Woody Crops network and the co-organisation of the International 
Short Rotation Woody Crops Conference 2018. Discussions in 2017 have resulted in the 
organisation of a joint conference in July 22-26 2018 in Rhinelander, WI, USA between Short 
Rotation Woody Crops Operations Working Group, the Poplar and Willow Council of Canada, 
the IUFRO Working Party 2.08.04 (Physiology and Genetics of Poplars and Willows), 
the IUFRO Working Party 1.03.00 (Short Rotation Forestry), the IEA Task 43 (Biomass 
Feedstocks for Energy Markets) and the IPC Environmental and Ecosystem Services Working 
Party (http://www.woodycrops.org/).
Networks such as CAR-ES (CeRntre of Advanced Research on Environmental Services from 
Nordic Forest Ecosystems), which brings together Nordic and Baltic forest researchers 
with the aim to provide scientific knowledge on the impacts of forest management, and the 
SNS “Effects of bioenergy production from forests and agriculture on ecosystem services 
in Nordic and Baltic landscapes” bring Task 43 researchers (Bentsen, Berndes, Dimitriou, 
Stupak, and others) with several research and research projects in the area. Discussions in 
2017 have resulted in the organisation of a Joint IEA Bioenergy Task 43, SNS-NKJ and 
CAR-ES conference in governing, documenting and measuring sustainability of bioenergy and 
biomaterials supply chains from forest and agricultural landscapes which will take place from 
the 17-19 April 2018 at the University of Copenhagen.
The collaboration between Task 38 and Task 43 members is continuous in terms of common 
work within reports (example “Forest biomass, carbon neutrality and climate change 
mitigation” that has been published by the European Forest”), in the intertask projects but 
also in Task 43 activities such as the iLUC activity involving members of Task 38 (Annette 
Cowie; Miguel Brandao). Additionally, concrete collaboration has been initiated with Task 40 
via the Task 43 activity “Exploring novel regional and landscape-based approaches to govern 
sustainability of bioenergy and biomaterials supply chains” starting in autumn 2017 involving 
Rocio Diaz-Chavez from Task 40.
