EXECUTIVE SUMMARY
Introduction
Watt Power commissioned Parsons Brinckerhoff Ltd to undertake a Preliminary Risk
Assessment of Abergelli Power Project, South Wales to form a baseline geo-
environmental assessment to enable the completion of Chapter 10, Geology, Ground
Conditions and Hydrogeology of the Environmental Statement.
Site History
The Project Site and surrounding area has remained predominantly grass fields and
with areas of woodland and marshland stretching back from the earliest historical data
from 1876 to the present day.
A gravel pit was present from 1896, and identified as ‘old’ in 1913. Other significant
historical land uses surrounding the Project Site, include Abergelli Colliery, and
associated buildings identified from 1935, and disused from 1964, a spoil heap adjacent
the colliery was identified from 1964.  The location of this spoil heap was identified as
an embankment in 2002.  This is likely to be associated with the landfilling works and
associated landfill extension which took place in the 1990’s. The National Grid
‘Swansea North’ substation in the western of the Project Site is evident on the historical
maps from 1991 to current day.
Geology
‘Made Ground’ is only likely to be present in areas where there are structures and
hardstanding associated with previous development, i.e. the landfill and surrounding the
colliery farm buildings.
The British Geological Survey on-line viewer and GroundSure GeoInsight Report
indicates that the area within the Project Site boundary is underlain by superficial
deposits of glacial till (predominantly clay), and glaciofluvial deposits of sand and
gravel.  There are also pockets of alluvium and peat present locally across the Project
Site.  The bedrock geology consists of the Grovesend Formation comprising
mudstones, siltstones, with well-developed coals, and minor lithic sandstones overlying
the Swansea Member.  There are two coal seams that were were worked from Abergelli
Colliery, these are known as the Swanse  Four Feet and Craigola.
Across the Project Site there are a number of historical ground working features,
including spoil / refuse heaps, a colliery and old gravel pits. The workings have included
the production of sand and gravel, and the working of coal seams underground.
Hydrogeology &
Hydrology
The superficial deposits that cover the Project Site are classified as unproductive strata
associated with the glacial till, and a Secondary A Aquifer associated with the
glaciofluvial deposits. The bedrock is classified as a Secondary A Aquifer. The
Environment Agency website and GroundSure Report indicate that the Project Site is
not situated within a groundwater Source Protection Zone (SPZ), with no SPZs are
located within 1km of the Project Site. The groundwater vulnerability has a varying
classification, from low to high leaching potential, dependent on the geology across the
Project Site.
There is one licenced groundwater abstraction on the Project Site, associated with
Abergelli Farm, used for general farming and domestic purposes. This is not currently
used.  There are an additional 16No. groundwater abstraction licences within 2km of
the Project Site.
The closest potable water supply is from the Lower Lliw Reservoir approximately 1km
north of the Project Site.
There are numerous drainage ditches, springs and small ponds present across the
Project Site that drain into the Afon Llan.  The Afon Llan flows in a south westerly
direction to the west and south of the Project Site, discharging into the Loughor Estuary.
Another watercourse, the Afon Lliw located 1.3km north of the Project Site also
discharges into the Loughor Estuary.
A pollution incident dated May 2007 relating to inert materials and wastes close to the
northern entrance to the Project Site caused significant impact to the water
environment.

Conceptual Site
Model
The identified potential sources include the waste in the landfill and landfill extension,
Abergelli Colliery, and water treatment processes that took place where the landfill is
now located, and landfill and ground gases associated with these historic land uses.
Other possible on Project Site sources include possible fertilisers from agricultural
practises, and leaks and spills from associated machinery.
Human receptors have been identified based on the proposed current and end land use
including residents of dwellings within the vicinity of the Project Site, site workers and
construction workers during the Project construction works.  Controlled water receptors
have been identified as both the bedrock and superficial deposits that underlie the
Project Site that are classified as Secondary A aquifers.  The abstraction well on the
Project Site for Abergelli Farm, and the various surface water bodies across the Project
Site are also considered controlled water receptors.
Potential pathways have been identified from these sources to residents, workers and
controlled waters.
Conclusions and
Recommendations
In order to provide further information to assess the potential ‘pollutant linkages’, a
ground investigation will be carried out at detailed design stage to assess soil, ground
gas and groundwater conditions at the Project Site.
Analytical data will then be used to undertake risk assessments to assess potential
risks to human health and controlled waters.  The ground investigation will obtain
information on ground instability hazards, including the depth and extent of any peat
horizons. It will also focus on potential underground mine workings using mine
abandonment plans.  This information will then be used to complete a mining risk
assessment and interpretative geotechnical report.

2.2
Geological Information
2.2.1
The geology of the Project Site has been reviewed with reference to the
following sources:
· 
BGS Digital Geological map of Great Britain at 1:50,000 scale
www.bgs.ac.uk/geoindex; viewed on 30th July 2014;
· 
The GroundSure GeoInsight Report (geological conditions, hazards
and mining hazards) (GS-1587648 29th July 2014), Appendix A;

2.2.2
On the basis of the above, the ground conditions beneath the Project
Site are likely to comprise the following:
Made Ground
2.2.3
Made Ground is not indicated on BGS records.  It is only likely to be
present in areas where there are structures and hardstanding
associated with previous development, i.e. the landfill and surrounding
the colliery farm buildings within the vicinity of the Project Site.

2.2.4
If present, the stratum would be of unknown provenance and could
include a range of materials such as colliery spoil.
Superficial Deposits
2.2.5
The superficial deposits located across the Project Site comprise
predominantly of glacial till (a diamicton; predominantly clay) and
glaciofluvial deposits of sand and gravel. There are also pockets of
alluvium and peat present locally within the Project Site boundary.  The
mapped peat is located north west of Abergelli Farm, and within the
north eastern corner of the Generating Equipment Site and Laydown
Area, see the excerpt of a superficial geology map in Appendix A.  The
likely permeability of the superficial deposits range from very low (within
the clays) to very high (within the sand and gravel) across the Project
Site.
2.2.6
There are records of three boreholes formed within the Project Site
boundary held by the British Geological Survey (BGS); only one of
these is currently available for viewing online1 and presented in
Appendix B. The record has a reference of SN60SE24 and is located
east of Abergelli Farm (NGR 265200, 201600), in an area mapped as
being underlain by Devensian glaciofluvial deposits of sand and gravel.
2.2.7
The superficial deposits recorded on the log comprise yellow brown
gravelly clay down to 6 metres below ground level (m bgl), overlying a
grey brown clayey gravelly sand, clayey sand and sandy clay down to
15.8 m bgl of likely glaciofluvial deposits that is underlain by firm yellow
clay becoming stiff grey gravelly clay that is likely to be glacial till;
proven to a maximum depth of 16.8 m bgl.  Traces of coal were
identified at 10.7 m bgl within the clayey sand.
Bedrock Geology
2.2.8
The bedrock geology underlying the Project Site consists of the
Grovesend Formation from the Westphalian stage of the Carboniferous
period, comprising “argillaceous mudstones and siltstones, with well-
developed coals, and minor lithic sandstones”2.  This is the youngest
unit in the South Wales coalfields.  The lower boundary “is placed at
the base of the Swansea Four Fee Coal of the Swansea district” “where
it overlies mudstone seatearth” at the top of the Swansea Member.
2.2.9
The north eastern corner of the Project Site consists of the Swansea
Member, also from the Westphalian stage, comprising “green-grey
pennant sandstone, with thin mudstone / siltstone and seat earth
interbeds and mainly thin coals”.  The lower boundary of the Swansea

Member “is placed at the base of the Golden Seam (Swansea Three
Feet or Graigola) (Woodland et al., 1957), where the coal rests on
mudstone seatearth within the Pennant Sandstone Formation”. This
geological formation is overlain conformably by the Grovesend
Formation.
2.2.10
There are many faults identified within the region of the Project Site.
The faults predominantly run from north west to south east, with the
downthrow (displacement) noted to the west-south west.  There is no
information of the dip angle on the geological maps.
2.2.11
There was a ‘Slant’ identified at Abergelli Colliery, which provided
access to both the Graigola and Swansea Four feet coal seams.  At a
slightly higher latitude than Abergelli Colliery the Swansea Four Feet
and Brynwhilach Two Feet seams are identified with fault offsetting
both seams.
2.2.12
The permeability of the bedrock geology ranges from low to high,
depending on the degree of fracturing.  There are nine faults across the
Project Site, two of which have been observed, according to BGS
records, and the others inferred either as a normal fault or along a coal
seam.  An excerpt from the geology map is provided in Appendix A.
Soils and Agriculture
2.2.13
There are two different soil classification areas across the Project Site.
The predominant soil classification is described as “slowly permeable,
wet, very acidic upland soils with a peaty surface”.  The soils are
described as “low fertility” and land cover is described as “moorland
rough grazing and forestry”.  The precipitation “drains to the stream
network”. It is noted in the source information that overgrazing of this
unit could lead to accelerated run-off and soil erosion3.
2.2.14
Through the centre and north eastern section of the Project Site, the
soils are described as “freely draining, slightly acid loamy soils”.  The
soils are of “low fertility”, with “arable and grassland” land cover and
precipitation “drains to local groundwater and rivers”.  There is potential
for groundwater contamination with these soils, comprising nitrate,
siltation and nutrient enrichment of streams from soil erosion.
2.2.15
The agricultural land classification for the land within and surrounding
the Project Site is grade 4 (“poor quality agricultural land”)4 “with severe
limitations which significantly restricts the range of crops and / or level

of yields, mainly suited to grass with occasional arable crops”5.  The
Project Site is known to be utilised as improved grazing for sheep and
horses, with small areas of marshy grassland and woodland copses
interspersing the improved grassland to the north and east. The
importance of this resource is considered low.
Ground Workings and Mineral Resources
2.2.16
According to the GroundSure GeoInsight Report (Appendix A), based
on historical mapping there have been a number of historical surface
ground working features on the Project Site.  These comprise refuse
heaps, a colliery, old gravel pits, unspecified pits and a pond.
2.2.17
The GroundSure GeoInsight Report has identified a gravel pit at
Abergelli Fach that produced sand and gravel. There are also a number
of surface mineral workings, including sand and gravel, sand,
sandstone and one underground deep coal working within 1km of the
Project Site.  All operations have a “ceased” status (i.e. they are no
longer active workings).
2.2.18
The Project Site is not within an area of tin or clay mining, or brine or
gypsum extraction.
Underground Coal Mining
2.2.19
A review of the GroundSure GeoInsight Report identified Abergelli
Colliery which is located adjacent to the Project Site approximately 500
m north of Abergelli Farm.  A coal pit, shaft, colliery, and mine spoil
heap have all been identified on historical mapping at locations
extending to between 480 m and 1 km from the Project Site boundary
(i.e. off-Project Site).
2.2.20
Further details on Abergelli Colliery are presented in the Coal Authority
Mining Report (Appendix C) and are summarised below.
2.2.21
The Project Site is in the likely zone of influence from workings in three
seams of coal, from shallow to a depth of 380 m.  The Coal Mining
Report indicates the coal seams were last worked in 19866.
2.2.22
There are two mine entries close to the Project Site, one of which is
located in the vicinity of Abergelli Colliery (north of Abergelli Fach
Farm). The other is located south of the National Grid’s ‘Swansea
North’ electrical substation at NGR 264970, 200800.  There is no
record of any treatment to the mine entries.

2.2.23
The Project Site is currently not in an area for which the Coal Authority
is determining to grant a licence to remove coal using underground
methods, where a licence has been granted or in an area that is likely
to be affected at the surface from any planned future workings.
However, reserves of coal exist and could be worked in the future.
Opencast Coal Mining
2.2.24
The Coal Authority report states that the Project Site is not within the
boundary of an opencast site from which coal has been removed by
opencast methods, and does not lie within 200 m of a boundary of an
opencast site.  It also states that the Project Site is not within 800 m of
the boundary of an opencast site for which the Coal Authority are
determining whether to grant a licence to remove coal by opencast
methods, or for which a licence to remove coal has been granted.
Ground Stability / Subsidence
2.2.25
The Coal Authority Mining Report (Appendix C) indicates that no notice
of the risk of the land being affected by subsidence has been given
under section 46 of the Coal Mining Subsidence Act 1991.
2.2.26
Abergelli Farm has been subject to remedial works, by or on behalf of
the Coal Authority under its emergency surface hazard call out
procedures. No further information was provided, however two damage
notices or claims for alleged subsidence damage were made in June
1995 and November 1996.
2.2.27
Geological hazards at the site identified in the GroundSure GeoInsight
Report are detailed within Table 2.3.

2.2.28
The high hazard associated with compressible ground is mapped and
presented within the GroundSure GeoInsight Report and is presumably
associated with the peat. One of the high hazard areas is situated in
the location of the Generating Equipment Site, along the eastern
boundary, and the other to the west and north west of Abergelli Farm.
2.2.29
Consideration of this hazard will be made in the design of any ground
works (including site investigation, earthworks, de-watering) and
foundation design.
2.3
Hydrogeological Information
2.3.1
The hydrogeology of the site has been reviewed with reference to the
following sources:
· 
GroundSure EnviroInsight report dated 29th July 2014 (Appendix
A); and
· 
Environment Agency Website ‘What’s in your backyard’
(http://www.environment-agency.gov.uk/) 30th July 2014.
2.3.2
The aquifer classifications associated with the superficial geology
comprise “unproductive strata” for the glacial till and “secondary A
aquifer” for the glaciofluvial deposits.
2.3.3
The bedrock geology has been classified as a Secondary A aquifer.
2.3.4
Unproductive strata are rock layers or drift deposits with low
permeability that have negligible significance for water supply or river
base flow.
2.3.5
Secondary A aquifers are permeable layers capable of supporting
water supplies at a local rather than strategic scale, and in some cases
forming an important source of base flow to rivers.
2.3.6
The BGS archived borehole log identified a water strike at 10.7m bgl
(ground level was 113m AOD). However, there was no information
regarding the resting water level in this borehole.
2.3.7
The GroundSure EnviroInsight Report has identified areas susceptible
to groundwater flooding within 50 m of the Project Site.  This is
associated with superficial deposits, where shallow unconsolidated
sedimentary aquifers overlie unproductive strata.  The susceptibility to
groundwater flooding is potentially at the surface, which means that
given the geological conditions in the area, groundwater flooding
hazard should be considered in all land-use planning decisions.  The

APL-6 2 0(App10 1)-PB-ENV-STAT-FV
Prepared by Parsons Brinckerhoff
March 2015
for Abergelli Power Ltd
- 20 -
BGS confidence rating of this groundwater flooding is classified as
'high'.
2.3.8
Groundwater quality in the study area has been assessed against the
objectives of the Water Framework Directive (WFD). According to the
EA website the current quantitative quality is good and is predicted to
remain so in 2015. The current chemical quality is poor and expected to
remain so in 2015.
Licenced Groundwater Abstractions
2.3.9
The GroundSure EnviroInsight Report has identified one groundwater
abstraction licence on the Project Site, associated with Abergelli Farm.
The licence number is 22/59/4/0027 with groundwater used for general
farming and domestic purposes.  The version start date was
01/02/1993, as there is no end date, it has been assumed to be still
active.
2.3.10
There are an additional 16 No. groundwater abstraction licences within
2 km of the Project Site all used for general farming and domestic
purposes.  The location of licensed groundwater abstractions within the
vicinity of the site are presented in Figure 10.1 of the Environmental
Statement.
Groundwater Vulnerability
2.3.11
The Project Site does not lie within a groundwater Source Protection
Zone (SPZ).
2.3.12
Groundwater vulnerability has been identified from the GroundSure
EnviroInsight Report with a varying classification across the Project
Site; i.e. from low to high leaching potential.
2.3.13
Low soil vulnerability is described as soils in which pollutants are
unlikely to penetrate the soil layer because either water movement is
largely horizontal, or they have the ability to attenuate diffuse
pollutants. High soil vulnerability is described as coarse or moderately
shallow soils which readily transmit non-adsorbed pollutants and liquid
discharges but have some ability to attenuate adsorbed pollutants
because of their clay or organic matter content.
Discharge Consents to Groundwater
2.3.14
There have been three discharge consents on the Project Site, all now
expired or revoked:
· 
Discharging to land associated with Abergelli Farm in 1987;

- 21 -
· 
The National Grid Gas Compressor Station, discharging sewage to
an unnamed land drain, effective between 2007 and 2010; and
· 
Trade discharges (site drainage) to the Afon Llan, revoked in 2011.
2.3.15
Further details of other discharge consents within 500 m of the Project
Site boundary is presented in the GroundSure EnviroInsight Report.
2.4
Hydrological and Drainage Information
2.4.1
There are a number of small watercourses within the vicinity of the
Project Site that drain to the Afon Llan, along with a number of springs
and small ponds.
2.4.2
The Afon Llan flows in a south westerly direction to the west and south
of the Project Site, discharging into the Loughor Estuary.  In addition,
another watercourse, the Afon Lliw is located approximately 1.3 km
north of the Project Site and also discharges into the Loughor Estuary.
2.4.3
Artificial water features include the Felindre water treatment works with
covered reservoir situated immediately north of the Project Site, and
the Lower Lliw reservoir situated approximately 1.1 km north of the
Project Site.
2.4.4
The closest potable water supply is from the Lower Lliw Reservoir
approximately 1 km north west of the Project Site.  The original start
date of abstraction was 09/08/1989.
Flood Risk
2.4.5
The GroundSure EnviroInsight Report indicates that the southern tip of
the scoping boundary is located in an area at risk from flooding with an
estimated annual probability of between 1 in 1000 (0.1%) and 1 in 100
(1%) from rivers (i.e. Flood Zone 2 and 3). However, the Project Site is
not located within an area at risk from flooding.
2.4.6
According to the British Geological Survey (BGS) there are areas within
50 m of the Project Site that are susceptible to groundwater flooding.
This is associated with shallow unconsolidated sedimentary aquifers
which overlie unproductive aquifers (Superficial Deposits flooding).
Licensed Surface Water Abstractions
2.4.7
According to the GroundSure EnviroInsight Report there are no surface
water abstractions within the Project Site boundary. However, there is
one licensed surface water abstraction within 825 m east of the Project
Site used for “lake and pond throughflow”, sourced from the Afon Llan.

Discharge Consents to Surface Water
2.5
There are no active discharge consents to surface water; however
there are seven consents which have either expired or have been
surrendered.
Recorded Pollution Incidents
2.5.2
According to the GroundSure EnviroInsight Report there have been
three pollution incidents within the Project Site. Two were related to
atmospheric pollutants and effects, causing a minor impact to air in
2002 situated in the National Grid Gas Plc.  The third was related to
inert materials and wastes described as soils and clay causing a
significant impact to the water environment.  The incident was dated
May 2007 and located on the northern boundary of the Project Site.
2.6
Recorded Landfill Sites
2.6.1
The GroundSure EnviroInsight Report and Environmental Agency data
indicate one authorised landfill and an adjacent historic “Landfill
Extension” located within the Project Site boundary, presented in
Figure 10.1. This is named the Abergelli Fach Farm landfill and its
current status is ‘closed’.  The total void space was calculated at
75,000m3, with a total tonnage of 142,500t. The landfill was only able to
accept non-biodegradable wastes.
2.6.2
The Landfill Extension is reported to have accepted inert waste.  The
planning application for this extension was granted in 1997.  National
Resources Wales (NRW) have provided the Working Plan and
associated drawings for the landfill which were dated March 1994
(Appendix D).  The total void space was calculated at 99,898m3, with a
total tonnage of 179,816t.
2.6.3
The Working Plan described the land as low lying, and poorly drained.
Approximately three quarters of the landfill area was covered by a mine
soil dump from Abergelli Colliery.  This mine waste was removed
leaving a layer of well compacted mine waste over the majority of the
landfill area.  The area of ground that was covered by the mine spoil
was used for drying out of water treatment sludge (aluminium sulphate)
though ceased when the landfill became operational.  No further
information on this operation is known.
2.7
Recorded Animal Burial Grounds
2.7.1
Information obtained from CCS indicates there was no local cull of
animals in Swansea, Neath Port Talbot or Carmarthenshire during the

been recorded at the Project Site.
2.8
Pollution Controls
2.8.1
There is one Integrated Pollution Prevention and Control (IPPC) permit
located within the Project Site boundary.  This is for the Gas
Compressor Station for the combustion of any fuel held by National
Grid Gas Plc.
2.9
Sensitive Land Uses
2.9.1
There are two areas of ancient woodland within the Project Site.  One
area of ancient woodland is located north east of the Generating
Equipment Site and another to the south of the Access Road.  Further
detail is provided within the Ecology Chapter of the Environmental
Statement (Chapter 8).

· 
Contamination associated with the historic landfill and landfill
extension;
· 
Contamination associated with the historic colliery, including
aluminium sulphate sludge; and
· 
Contamination from agricultural land use including leaks/spills from
machinery.
2.13
Preliminary Conceptual Site Model
2.13.1
On the basis of the information summarised above, a preliminary
conceptual site model (CSM) has been developed for the Project Site.
The CSM identifies potential contaminants, receptors (both on and off-
site) and exposure pathways that may be present. The identification of
such potential “pollutant linkages” is a key aspect of the evaluation of
potentially contaminated land.
2.13.2
An approach based on CIRIA report C552 has been adopted within this
report. For each of the pollutant linkages, an estimate is made of;
· 
The potential severity of the risk; and
· 
The likelihood of the risk occurring.
2.13.3
Table 2.6 presents the classification of the severity of the risk.
Table 2.6: Severity of Risk
Severe
Acute risks to human health;
Major pollution of controlled waters(watercourses or
groundwater)
Medium
Chronic (long-term) risk to human health;
Pollution of sensitive controlled waters (surface waters or
aquifers)
Minor
Requirement for protective equipment during site works to
migrate health effects;
Damage to non-sensitive ecosystems or species
2.13.4
The probability of the risk occurring is classified according to criteria
given in Table 2.7.
Table 2.7: Probability of Risk Occurring
High Likelihood
Pollutant linkage may be present, and risk is almost certain
to occur in the long term, or there is evidence of harm to the
receptor.
Likely
Pollutant linkage may be present, and it is probable that the

risk will occur over the long term.
Low Likelihood
Pollutant linkage may be present and there is a possibility of
the risk occurring, although there is no certainty that it will
do so.
Unlikely
Pollutant linkage may be present but the circumstances
under which harm would occur are improbable.
2.13.5
An overall evaluation of the level of risk is gained from a comparison of
the severity and probability as presented in Table 2.8.

2.13.6
Potential “pollutant linkages” associated with the Project are detailed
within Table 2.9.
2.13.7
It should be noted that the identification of potential “pollutant linkages”
does not indicate that they are significant in any way or that the Project
Site is unsuitable for its current/proposed use. It does however act as a
way of focusing future data collection at the Project Site and identifying
any key potential risks associated with the Project Site.
2.13.8
The risks to construction workers associated with the Project Site are
considered 
negligible 
with 
embedded 
mitigation 
taken 
into
consideration, such as PPE and following best practice procedures.
2.13.9
The current conservative assessment is based on a desk study and will
be confirmed through intrusive investigation prior to detailed design.
2.13.10
It should also be noted that potential risks associated with ground
instability are not incorporated into the assessment.

The majority of the development area will comprise

There is potential for landfill gases to be present within
the landfill and landfill extension. The gas generation
is anticipated to be low as the landfill was licenced to
only receive inert and nonbiodegradeable waste. This
needs to be considered as buried structures will be
constructed to the east of the landfills. The exposure
durations are limited and the receptor class is less
sensitive; the generating equipment site is relatively
distant from the landfill hence the “Low” classification.

identified
Moderate /
Low
There is potential for natural ground gases to be
present within the peat stratum mapped in localised
areas within the Project Site. The gas generation is
anticipated to be moderate to low in these areas and
this currently vents naturally.
Construction
workers
Moderate /
Low
Construction workers may potentially disturb the peat
habitat during the construction works; this is
particularly relevant with sub-surface construction
activities where ground gas may accumulate.

CONCLUSIONS AND RECOMMENDATIONS
3.1
Conclusions
3.1.1
APL commissioned Parsons Brinckerhoff to undertake a preliminary
risk assessment (desk study) as part of the geology, ground conditions
and hydrogeology chapter for the Environmental Statement of Abergelli
Power Project.
3.1.2
The geological and hydrogeological conditions have been investigated
and described on the basis of the available published information.
3.1.3
Following a review of information relating to the site and surrounding
area, a number of discrete potential ‘pollutant linkages’ have been
identified at the Project Site.
3.1.4
Potential sources from the previous use of the site are localised and
include an historic landfill and landfill extension, a colliery and historic
water treatment processes associated with the mine, a potentially
backfilled gravel pit, and agricultural use including potential animal
burials.
3.2
Recommendations
3.2.1
In order to provide further information for this assessment to assess the
potential ‘pollutant linkages’, a focused intrusive ground investigation is
recommended.
3.2.2
This would likely be incorporated into the site-wide ground investigation
and include exploratory holes (boreholes and trial pits) to investigate
soil and groundwater conditions at the Project Site, and to characterise
the deposits in each of the areas identified as a potential source of
contamination.
3.2.3
The ground investigation would also obtain information on ground
instability hazards, including the depth and extent of any peat horizons.
It will also focus on potential underground mine workings using mine
abandonment plans.  This information will then be used to complete a
mining risk assessment and interpretative geotechnical report.
3.2.4
Sampling of soils, groundwater and surface water will be carried out for
chemical analysis to establish the presence/absence of any
contamination and allow the assessment of the significance through the
completion of a risk assessment.
3.2.5
Ground gas monitoring will also be required in the area due the
increased potential for gas generation from coal workings, the landfill or
peat areas.

10. Contacts
This section of the report provides contact points for statutory bodies and data providers that may be able to provide 
further information on issues raised within this report. Alternatively, GroundSure provide a free Technical Helpline 
(08444 159000) for further information and guidance.
Note: Maps
Only certain features are placed on the maps within the report. All features represented on maps found within this 
search are given an identification number. This number identifies the feature on the mapping and correlates it to the 
additional information provided below. This identification number precedes all other information and takes the fol-
lowing format -Id: 1, Id: 2, etc. Where numerous features on the same map are in such close proximity that the num -
bers would obscure each other a letter identifier is used instead to represent the features. (e.g. Three features which 
overlap may be given the identifier “A” on the map and would be identified separately as features 1A, 3A, 10A on the 
data tables provided). 
Where a feature is reported in the data tables to a distance greater than the map area, it is noted in the data table as 
“Not Shown”. 
All distances given in this report are in Metres (m). Directions are given as compass headings such as N: North, E: East, 
NE: North East from the nearest point of the study site boundary.

Minor Aquifer/High Leaching 
Potential
H2
Deep, permeable, coarse textured 
soils which readily transmit a wide 
range of pollutants because of 
their rapid drainage and low 
attenuation potential.
0
On Site
Minor Aquifer/Low Leaching 
Potential
L
Soils in which pollutants are 
unlikely to penetrate the soil layer 
because either water movement is 
largely horizontal, or they have the 
ability to attenuate diffuse 
pollutants.

6.4 Areas benefiting from Flood Defences
Are there any areas benefiting from Flood Defences within 250m of the study site?
No
6.5 Areas benefiting from Flood Storage
Are there any areas used for Flood Storage within 250m of the study site?
No
6.6 Groundwater Flooding Susceptibility Areas
6.6.1 Are there any British Geological Survey groundwater flooding susceptibility areas within 50m of the 
boundary of the study site?
 
Yes
Does this relate to Clearwater Flooding or Superficial Deposits Flooding?
Superficial Deposits Flooding
Notes: Groundwater flooding may either be associated with shallow unconsolidated sedimentary aquifers 
which overlie unproductive aquifers (Superficial Deposits Flooding), or with unconfined aquifers (Clearwater 
Flooding).
6.6.2 What is the highest susceptibility to groundwater flooding in the search area based on the underlying 
geological conditions?
 
Potential at Surface
Where potential for groundwater flooding to occur at surface is indicated, this means that given the geological 
conditions in the area groundwater flooding hazard should be considered in all land-use planning decisions. It is 
recommended that other relevant information e.g. records of previous incidence of groundwater flooding, 
rainfall, property type, and land drainage information be investigated in order to establish relative, but not 
absolute, risk of groundwater flooding.
6.7 Groundwater Flooding Confidence Areas
What is the British Geological Survey confidence rating in this result?
High
Notes: Groundwater flooding is defined as the emergence of groundwater at the ground surface or the rising of 
groundwater into man-made ground under conditions where the normal range of groundwater  levels is 
exceeded.
The confidence rating is on a threefold scale - Low, Moderate and High. This provides a relative indication of the 
BGS confidence in the accuracy of the susceptibility result for groundwater flooding. This is based on the 
amount and precision of the information used in the assessment. In areas with a relatively lower level of 
confidence the susceptibility result should be treated with more caution. In other areas with higher levels of 
confidence the susceptibility result can be used with more confidence.

8. Natural Hazards
Findings
8.1 Detailed BGS GeoSure Data
BGS GeoSure Data has been searched to 50m. The data is included in tabular format. If you require further 
information on geology and ground stability, please obtain a  GroundSure GeoInsight, available from  our 
website. The following information has been found:
8.1.1 Shrink Swell
What is the maximum Shrink-Swell** hazard rating identified on the study site?
Very Low
The following natural subsidence information provided by the British Geological Survey is not represented on 
mapping:
Hazard
Ground conditions predominantly low plasticity. No special actions required to avoid problems due to shrink-swell clays. No special ground 
investigation required, and increased construction costs or increased financial risks are unlikely due to potential problems with shrink-swell clays.
8.1.2 Landslides
What is the maximum Landslide* hazard rating identified on the study site?
Low
The following natural subsidence information provided by the British Geological Survey is not represented on 
mapping:
Hazard
Possibility of slope instability problems after major changes in ground conditions. Consideration should be given to stability if changes to drainage 
or excavations take place. Possible increase in construction cost to reduce potential slope stability problems. Existing property  no significant 
�
increase in insurance risk due to natural slope instability problems.
8.1.3 Soluble Rocks
What is the maximum Soluble Rocks* hazard rating identified on the study site?
Null - Negligible
Soluble rocks are not present in the search area. No special actions required to avoid problems due to soluble 
rocks. No special ground investigation required, and increased construction costs or increased financial risks 
are unlikely due to potential problems with soluble rocks.

8.1.4 Compressible Ground
What is the maximum Compressible Ground* hazard rating identified on the study site?
High
The following natural subsidence information provided by the British Geological Survey is not represented on 
mapping:
Hazard
Very significant potential for compressibility problems. Avoid large differential loadings of ground. Do not drain or de-water ground near the 
property without technical advice. For new build  consider possibility of compressible ground in ground investigation, construction and building 
�
design. Consider effects of groundwater changes. Construction may not be possible at economic cost. For existing property  probable increase in 
�
insurance risk from compressibility especially if water conditions or loading of the ground change significantly.
8.1.5 Collapsible Rocks
What is the maximum Collapsible Rocks* hazard rating identified on the study site?
Very Low
The following natural subsidence information provided by the British Geological Survey is not represented on 
mapping:
Hazard
Deposits with potential to collapse when loaded and saturated are unlikely to be present. No special ground investigation required or increased 
construction costs or increased financial risk due to potential problems with collapsible deposits.
8.1.6 Running Sand
What is the maximum Running Sand** hazard rating identified on the study site?
Low
The following natural subsidence information provided by the British Geological Survey is not represented on 
mapping:
Hazard
Possibility of running sand problems after major changes in ground conditions. Normal maintenance to avoid leakage of water-bearing services or 
water bodies (ponds, swimming pools) should reduce likelihood of problems due to running sand. For new build  consider possibility of running sand
�
 
into trenches or excavations if water table is high or sandy strata are exposed to water. Avoid concentrated water inputs to site. Unlikely to be an 
increase in construction costs due to potential for running sand. For existing property  no significant increase in insurance risk due to running sand 
�
problems is likely.

Low
Possibility of running sand problems after major changes in ground conditions. Normal 
maintenance to avoid leakage of water-bearing services or water bodies (ponds, 
swimming pools) should reduce likelihood of problems due to running sand. For new 
build - consider possibility of running sand into trenches or excavations if water table is 
high or sandy strata are exposed to water. Avoid concentrated water inputs to site. 
Unlikely to be an increase in construction costs due to potential for running sand. For 
existing property - no significant increase in insurance risk due to running sand 
problems is likely.
