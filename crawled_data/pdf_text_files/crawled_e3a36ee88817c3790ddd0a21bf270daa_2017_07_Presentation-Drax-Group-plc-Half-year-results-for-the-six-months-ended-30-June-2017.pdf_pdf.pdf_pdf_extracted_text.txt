BM
BALANCING MECHANISM
The mechanism through which the System Operator can call upon additional generation/consumption or 
reduce generation / consumption, through market participants’ bids and offers, in order to balance the system 
minute by minute.
EBITDA
Earnings before interest, tax, depreciation, amortisation and material one-off items that do not reflect the 
underlying trading performance of the business.
ELV
EMISSION LIMIT VALUES
One of the mechanisms available to implement the LCPD. This sets annual limits on the emissions of NOX, 
SO2 and particulate which will be incorporated into the forthcoming PPC permit.
EUA
EU ALLOWANCE
European Union Allowances, the tradable unit under the EU ETS. Equals 1 tonne of CO2.
EU ETS
EU EMISSIONS TRADING SCHEME
Trading Scheme within the European Union. The first compliance phase ran from 2005-07, the second 
compliance phase continued from 2008-12 and the third phase is proposed to run from 2013-2020.
I&C
INDUSTRIAL & COMMERCIAL
IED
INDUSTRIAL EMISSIONS DIRECTIVE
European Parliament and the Council directive on industrial emissions is the main EU instrument regulating 
pollutant emissions from industrial installations.
NOx
Nitrogen oxides, emissions of which are regulated under the LCPD.
RO
RENEWABLES OBLIGATION
The obligation placed on licensed electricity suppliers to deliver a specified amount of their electricity from 
eligible renewable sources. 
ROC
RENEWABLES OBLIGATION CERTIFICATE
The obligation requires licensed electricity suppliers to ensure that specified and increasing amounts of the 
electricity they supply are from renewable sources. Eligible generators of electricity using renewable energy 
sources receive a pre-specified number of ROCs per MWh of renewable power generation dependant on 
date of commission and technology. These certificates can then be traded.

SMALL MEDIUM ENTERPRISE
TRIR
TOTAL RECORDABLE  INJURY RATE
TRIR is calculated on the following basis (lost time injuries + worse than first aid injuries) /
hours worked * 100,000.
