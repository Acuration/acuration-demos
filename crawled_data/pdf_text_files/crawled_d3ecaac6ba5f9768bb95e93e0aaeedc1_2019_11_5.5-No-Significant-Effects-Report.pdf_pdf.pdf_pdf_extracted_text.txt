No Significant Effects Report 
1.1 
Introduction 
a) Background 
1.1.1 
This report represents a Habitats Regulations Assessment (HRA) Screening 
Document prepared as part of the Environmental Impact Assessment for Abergelli 
Power Project (hereafter referred to as the ‘Project).  
1.1.2 
The report is designed to serve two key functions: 
 
To assist Abergelli Power Limited (APL, hereafter referred to as the Applicant) 
by making it easier to undertake and consult on a Habitat Regulations 
Assessment; and,  
 
To act as a confirmatory checklist that can be used to ensure that the relevant 
information needed for a Habitats Regulations Assessment has been 
undertaken. 
b) The Habitats Directive and Habitat Regulations  
1.1.3 
The need for an assessment of impacts on Natura 2000 sites (the collective name 
for European designated sites, including Special Protection Areas (SPA) and 
Special Areas of Conservation (SAC)) is set out within Article 6 of the Habitats 
Directive, and transposed into UK law by the Habitats Regulations.  The ultimate 
aim of the Habitats Directive 1992 is to “maintain or restore, at favourable 
conservation status, natural habitats and species of wild fauna and flora of 
Community interest” (Article 2(2)).  This aim relates to habitats and species, not the 
European Sites themselves, although the European Sites have a significant role in 
delivering favourable conservation status. 
1.1.4 
It is a requirement of the Habitats Directive 1992 and the Conservation of Habitats 
and Species Regulations 2017 (the 'Habitats Regulations' (Plate 1.1)) that plans 
and projects are subject to ‘Appropriate Assessment’ if it is likely that they will lead 
to significant adverse effects on a Natura 2000 site, either alone or in combination 
with other plans or projects. It is the duty of the competent authority (the Secretary 
of State in relation to the Project) to make the determination as to whether 
significant adverse effects are likely and, if necessary, to then undertake the 
Appropriate Assessment. The promoter of the Project can be asked to supply 
information to inform those assessments and decisions.  
1.1.5 
The Habitats Directive applies the precautionary principle to European Sites. 
Consent should only be granted for plans and projects once the relevant competent 
authority has ascertained either that no likely significant effects will arise or 
(through the Appropriate Assessment) that there will be no adverse effect on the 
integrity of the European Site(s) in question.  Where an appropriate assessment 
has been carried out and results in an assessment of adverse effects on integrity, 
or if uncertainty remains, consent must only be granted if there are no alternative

solutions and there are imperative reasons of over-riding public interest (IROPI) for 
the development, and compensatory measures have been secured.  
1.1.6 
Throughout this report, the term 'Habitat Regulations Assessment' is used to refer 
to the overall procedure required by the Habitat Regulations, as described above.   
1.1.7 
All the European sites referenced in this document are shown in Figure 1.  
Plate 1.1: The legislative basis for Appropriate Assessment 
1.1.8 
This report has been prepared having regard to all relevant case law relating to the 
Habitats Regulations – in particular, the recent European Court of Justice case of 
People Over Wind, Peter Sweetman v Coillte Teoranta (C-323/17) has been taken 
into account as it directly concerns the approach to screening under the Habitats 
Regulations (the stage prior to appropriate assessment).  
1.1.9 
The case held that "it is not appropriate, at the screening stage, to take account of 
the measures intended to avoid or reduce the harmful effects of the plan or project 
on that site" (paragraph 40). This establishes that 'mitigation measures' cannot be 
taken into account at the screening stage, but it is important to note that not all 
mitigation measures are excluded from consideration – only those "intended to 
avoid or reduce the harmful effects of the… project on that site" (emphasis added). 
Mitigation measures which are (for example) intended to avoid effects on a local 
watercourse and which is not part of the European site, can be taken into account.  
1.1.10 Where mitigation measures are mentioned in this report, they are therefore ones 
which may reduce or avoid harmful effects on certain (local) habitats or species, but 
they are not relied on to avoid or reduce harmful effects on the European sites 
discussed below. Such measures will, at most, ensure that a conclusion of no LSE 
in respect of a European site reached separately, is confirmed.  
Habitats Directive 1992 
Article 6 (3) states that: 
“Any plan of project not directly connected with or necessary to the 
management of the site but likely to have a significant effect thereon, either 
individually or in combination with other plans or projects, shall be subject to 
appropriate assessment of its implications for the site in view of the site’s 
conservation objectives.” 
Conservation of Habitats and Species Regulations 2017 
Regulation 63 states that: 
“A competent authority, before deciding to … give any consent for a plan or 
project which is likely to have a significant effect on a European site … must 
make an appropriate assessment of the implications… for that site in view of 
that site's conservation objectives… The competent authority may agree to 
the plan or project only after having ascertained that it will not adversely affect 
the integrity of the European site”.

1.1.11 Preparation of this report has involved reference to Planning Inspectorate Advice 
Note Ten: Habitat Regulations Assessment relevant to Nationally Significant 
Infrastructure Projects (November 2017).  
1.1.12 PINS Advice Note Ten requires an evaluation of the potential for the Project to 
require other consents which could also require Habitats Regulations Assessment 
by different competent authorities, and a statement as to whether the DCO 
boundary of the project overlaps with devolved administrations or other European 
Economic Area (EEA) States.  
1.1.13 It is confirmed that the DCO boundary of the project does not overlap with areas of 
devolved administrations or with those of other EEA States.  
1.1.14 The following competent authorities will need to conduct an HRA:  

the Secretary of State, in relation to the DCO application; and,
•
Natural Resources Wales (NRW), in relation to the environmental permit
application.

1.1.19 The need and alternatives for the Project are discussed in detail Chapter 5 
Alternatives Considered of the ES (Ref. 1.1).  
1.1.20 The detailed decommissioning methodology cannot be finalised until immediately 
prior to decommissioning, but would be in line with relevant legislation and policy at 
that time.

1.1.21 The working assumption has been made for the purposes of this assessment that
after 25 years, the Generating Equipment would be removed and the Generating
Equipment Site re-instated to a similar condition as before construction; below
ground structures would remain in situ so as to avoid unnecessary disturbance of
above ground habitats and/or species.  Any decommissioning phase would be likely
to be of a similar duration to construction i.e. 22 months.
1.1.22 A working assumption has been used that the Electrical Connection and Gas
Connection would be decommissioned after 25 years. Elements of the Gas
Connection and Electrical Connection may be left in situ as this is likely to cause
less environmental effects than removal. This would be the case for the Gas 
Pipeline, for example.

Designated Sites Scoped into HRA Screening
1.2.1 
Table 1-3, Table 1-4 and Table 1-5 provide a description of all the Natura 2000 sites
within 10km of the Power Generation Plant and which are scoped into the HRA
Screening.  The tables set out the distance of the relevant Natura 2000 site from
the proposed stack, and justification for inclusion in the HRA Screening. This
approach is in line with the consultation response received from NRW (email dated
13 September 2017).

Crymlyn Bog SAC and Ramsar
6.7km south-east
Crymlyn Bog, which covers approximately 299ha, comprises floodplain-valley mire
located within a lowland coastal context and is the most extensive wetland of its type in
Wales. The mire features a complex mosaic of vegetation types, supporting examples of
swamp, tall herb fen, fen meadow and carr communities. The site supports an
exceptionally wide range of rich and poor fen communities, some of which bear a close
floristic affinity to certain floodplain mires in East Anglia. The presence of significant areas
of saw sedge (Cladium mariscus) swamp is notable in extensive stands of this uncommon
vegetation type, occurring at only three other sites in Wales. Crymlyn Bog is part of a
larger inter-estuarine complex which includes the adjacent Pant y Sais fen.
SAC
Annex I habitats that are a primary reason for selection of this site:

Transition mires and quaking bogs; and,

Calcareous fens with Cladium mariscus and species of the
Caricion davallianae.
Annex I habitats present as a qualifying feature, but not a primary

Carmarthen Bay and Estuaries SAC 
7km west 
Carmarthen Bay and Estuary is an example of a large estuarine site covering 
approximately 66,092ha on the south coast of Wales, encompassing the estuaries of the 
Rivers Loughor, Tâf and Tywi (coastal plain estuaries) and the Gwendraeth (a bar-built 
estuary). Carmarthen Bay is also an example of an extensive shallow bay which varies 
considerably in salinity, wave action, tides, and sediment types and therefore has a wide, 
varied range of flora and fauna associated with each of the zones. The estuary complex 
includes the sandbank of Helwick Bank, which is a linear shallow subtidal sandbank that 
is unusual in being highly exposed to wave action and tidal action, as well as several 
other smaller sandbanks in relatively shallow waters. The site also includes extensive 
areas of intertidal mudflats and sandflats as well as being a representative of pioneer 
glass wort (Salicornia spp.) saltmarsh which has a full transition sequence to upper salt-
meadow and important sand dune habitats. 
Annex I habitats that are a primary reason for selection of this site:  

Sandbanks which are slightly covered by sea water all the
time;

Estuaries;

Mudflats and sandflats not covered by seawater at low tide;

Large shallow inlets and bays;

Salicornia and other annuals colonizing mud and sand; and,


Burry Inlet SPA and Ramsar 
8.6km south-west 
Burry Inlet is a large estuarine complex covering approximately 6,628ha and located 
between the Gower Peninsula and Llanelli in South Wales. It includes extensive areas of 
intertidal sand- and mud-flats, together with large sand dune systems at the mouth of the 
estuary. The site contains the largest continuous area of saltmarsh in Wales (2,200ha). 
The estuary experiences wide tidal fluctuations (about 8m) which have the consequence 
of exposing a large extent of intertidal sediments on a regular basis. These are mostly 
sandy, but muddy substrates are to be found in more sheltered areas. The Burry Inlet 
regularly supports large numbers of overwintering wildfowl and waders that feed in the 
saltmarshes and on the intertidal areas.

Screening for Likely Significant Effects 
a) Identification of Potential Impacts
1.3.1 
All potential impacts from all stages of the Project have been considered. The 
potential pathways from all stages of the Project have been considered but the 
following pathways have been scoped out due to the design of the project, 
embedded mitigation detailed in the ES (Ref. 1.1), or the distance between the 
Project Site and the Natura 2000 sites making the pathway or effect unfeasible:  

Noise – As stated in Chapter 7: Noise and Vibration of the ES, the loudest
noise during construction of the Project will be 92 dB at source and operation of
the Project 55 dB at the Project Site Boundary. At a distance of over 6 km (for
the nearest Natura 2000 site) this will reduce to well below existing ambient
levels and will be inaudible.  There are no Likely Significant Effect (LSE) on
Natura 2000 sites within 10 km associated with noise;

Vibration – As stated in Chapter 7: Noise and Vibration of the ES, in the
absence of specific information on likely construction activities and plant, a
qualitative assessment based upon professional judgement has been
undertaken.  Given the significant distance to residential receptors, this
qualitative judgement made is that no significant vibration (medium or high
magnitude impacts) is expected to result at residential NSRs from construction
and therefore further assessment is scoped out.  Given that the nearest Natura
2000 site is over 6 km from the nearest residential receptor it can be concluded
that there will be no LSEs on Natura 2000 sites within 10 km during all stages
of the Project associated with vibration;

Construction dust and vehicle movements – Fine particulate in the size range
of PM10 generated by construction activities and vehicle emissions can travel
up to 1 km from a construction site if not adequately controlled, with larger dust
particles travelling much shorter distances. The nearest Natura 2000 site is
over 6 km away from the Project Site and, as such, there will be no LSEs on
any Natura 2000 sites within 10km associated with dust;

Direct habitat loss or fragmentation – There will be no construction or
requirement to remove any habitat within any Natura 2000 site, as such there
will be no LSEs on Natura 2000 sites within 10 km associated with direct
habitat loss or fragmentation;

Direct disturbance to species – There will be no construction or requirement to
remove any habitat within any Natura 2000 site, as such there will be no LSEs
on a Natura 2000 site within 10 km associated with direct disturbance to
species;

Alteration of management – The Project will not cause the alteration of site
management actions at any Natura 2000 site within 10 km, as such there will
be no LSEs on Natura 2000 sites associated with alteration of management;

Increase in lighting – The nearest Natura 2000 site is over 6 km from the
Project Site and as such light spill will not measurably increase onto Natura
2000 sites within 10 km. There will be no LSEs on Natura 2000 sites within 10
km associated with lighting from the Project. ; and

Spread of invasive species –There will be no construction within, or
requirement to access, any Natura 2000 site.  The spread of invasive species
into Natura 2000 sites will not be caused by the Project. There will be no LSEs
on Natura 2000 sites associated with spread of invasive species.

1.3.2 
The potential pathways by which the Project could impact the qualifying features of 
each Natura 2000 sites are as follows: 

Potential changes in water quality from construction of the Project, resulting in
effects on habitats in Carmarthen Bay and Estuaries SAC and Burry Inlet SPA
and Ramsar; and,

Potential changes in air quality from operation of the Project, resulting in effects
on habitats in Crymlyn Bog SAC and Ramsar, Carmarthen Bay and Estuaries
SAC and Bury Inlet SPA and Ramsar.
1.3.3 
Crymlyn Bog SAC and Ramsar site is not hydrologically connected to the Project 
Site. As such effects associated with water quality on Crymlyn Bog SAC and 
Ramsar site have been scoped out of any further assessment.  
b)
Potential Impacts on Water Quality
1.3.4 
There is the potential for the Project to result in changes to water quality that could 
subsequently affect the habitats within the Natura 2000 sites identified above. 
There is a hydrological connection between the Project Site and Carmarthen Bay 
and Estuaries SAC and Burry Inlet SPA and Ramsar via the Afon Llan. Leaving the 
Project Site the Afon Llan flows for approximately 12 km before reaching the Afon 
Lliw and flowing into the Natura 2000 sites.   
1.3.5 
It envisaged that temporary toilets with appropriate foul waste facility will be in 
place during construction and maintenance operation and all foul waste generated 
during this period will be taken off-site for disposal at appropriate facilities by 
specialist contractors. Accordingly, no impact on water receptors is likely.  
1.3.6 
During operation the Project will either be unmanned or have a maximum of two 
toilets on site with approximately three shifts of five workers in a 24 hour period.  A 
manned site will contribute nitrogen to Carmarthen Bay and Estuaries SAC and 
Burry Inlet SPA and Ramsar.  
1.3.7 
Connection to a public sewer is not deemed feasible. The drainage strategy has 
considered the use of either septic tanks within the site or a package sewage 
treatment plants for foul effluent. However, package treatment plants are the 
preferred option, subject to detailed design following completion of ground 
investigations. The choice of one or other of these disposal methods is not 
considered to have a material effect on the impact assessment. Due to the small 
quantity of foul water generated during operations, it is anticipated that treated 
water can be discharged via infiltration (soakaway) on site. In line with standard 
design practice, the foul water drainage system will be positioned to minimise the 
risk of inundation by floodwaters. Where there is an inadequate unsaturated zone 
beneath the site, the option of discharging to local watercourses will be adopted. 
Any discharges will be subject to the Environmental Permitting Regulations and will 
need to meet quality criteria set by NRW.  
1.3.8 
Chapter 9 (Water Quality and Flood Risk) of the ES (Ref. 1.1) identifies the 
sensitivity of the surface water and/or groundwater receptors (i.e. the tributary to 
 Abergelli Power Project – No Significant Effects Report

AECOM 
1-15 
the east of the Afon Llan and/or Carmarthen Carboniferous Coal Measures 
groundwater body beneath the Project Site) likely to receive foul effluent from the 
Project Site as Medium. Taking into account the quantity of treated foul 
waste/wastewater likely to be generated from the packaged sewage treatment plant 
and dilution properties of these receiving receptors, the magnitude of pollution 
impacts from discharges is considered to be Negligible. Hence, the significance of 
effect is considered to be Negligible. There is considered to be no LSE associated 
with wastewater discharges resulting from the operation of the Project on 
Carmarthen Bay and Estuaries SAC and Burry Inlet SPA and Ramsar.  
1.3.9 
The embedded measures included in the construction and operation as a matter of 
course cover drainage and following best practice and guidelines, controlling 
pollution, storage of potential pollutants, and precautionary measures to limit the 
likelihood and effects of pollution incidents and/or runoff. These are deployed as 
standard to protect any surface watercourse. Similarly, the Project Site drainage will 
include filter drains / swales or oil interceptors as necessary to remove pollutants 
and all necessary treatment will take place within the Project Site before it is 
discharged to the existing watercourses. They directly assist in avoiding effects on 
local watercourses (not Natura 2000 sites) and assist in strengthening the 
conclusion reached already that there will be no LSEs on any Natura 2000 sites 
within 10 km associated with water pollution. 
1.3.10 Potential effects during decommissioning are likely to be the same as for 
construction and will be controlled similarly. There are considered to be no LSEs 
associated with water quality resulting from the decommissioning phase of the 
Project.  
c)
Potential Impacts on Air Quality
1.3.11 Transport related emissions are most relevant to sites within 200 m of a major road. 
The Design Manual for Roads and Bridges (DMRB) (Ref. 1.3) identifies 200 m as 
the distance beyond which the contribution of traffic emissions to local pollutant 
concentrations is considered to be negligible.  There are no roads within 200 m of 
any Natura 2000 site that are forecast to receive anything other than a nominal 
short term change in vehicle flows as a result of the construction and operation of 
the Project.  There are considered to be no LSEs associated with traffic emissions 
related air quality as a result of the construction or operation phases of the Project.  
1.3.12 Potential effects of traffic related emissions during decommissioning are likely to be 
the same as for construction. There are considered to be no LSEs associated with 
traffic emission related air quality resulting from the decommissioning phase of the 
Project.   
1.3.13 There is the potential for the Project to result in changes to air quality that could 
subsequently affect the habitats within the Natura 2000 sites identified above.  The 
air quality assessment, Chapter 6 of the Project ES (Ref. 1.1), sets out predicted 
changes in concentrations of emissions associated with the construction, 
operational and decommissioning phases of the development.

1.3.14 The analysis is summarised in the matrices in Appendix B.  
1.3.15 There are two measures of particular relevance in this assessment. The first is the 
concentration of oxides of nitrogen (known as NOx) in the atmosphere. The main 
importance is as a source of nitrogen, which is then deposited on adjacent habitats 
either directly (known as dry deposition, including directly onto the plants 
themselves) or washed out in rainfall (known as wet deposition). The deposited 
nitrogen can then have a range of effects, primarily growth stimulation or inhibition1, 
but also biochemical and physiological effects such as changes to chlorophyll 
content. NOx may also have some effects which are un-related to its role in total 
nitrogen intake (such as the acidity of the gas potentially affecting lipid 
biosynthesis) but the evidence for these effects is limited and they do not appear to 
occur until high annual concentrations of NOx are reached. The guideline 
atmospheric concentration of NOx advocated by Government for the protection of 
vegetation is 30 micrograms per cubic metre (µgm-3), known as the Critical Level 
(Ref. 1.4). This is driven by the role of NOx in nitrogen deposition and in particular 
in growth stimulation and inhibition. If the total NOx concentration in a given area is 
below the critical level, it is unlikely that nitrogen deposition will be an issue, unless 
there are other sources of nitrogen (e.g. ammonia). If it is above the critical level 
then local nitrogen deposition from NOx could be an issue and should be 
investigated. 
1.3.16 The second important metric is a direct determination of the rate of the resulting 
nitrogen deposition. Calculating nitrogen deposition rates has the advantage of 
being habitat specific and, for many habitats, of being directly relatable to 
measurable effects on the ground through scrutiny of published dose-response 
relationships. In contrast, the NOx critical level is entirely generic and cannot be 
related to dose-response relationships. Unlike NOx, the nitrogen deposition rate 
below which current evidence suggests that effects should not arise is different for 
each habitat. The rate (known as the Critical Load) is provided on the UK Air 
Pollution Information System website (www.apis.ac.uk) and is expressed as a 
quantity (kilograms) of nitrogen over a given area (hectare) per year (kgNha-1yr-1). 
More recently, there has also been research compiled2 which investigates nitrogen 
dose-response relationships in a range of habitats.  
1.3.17 For completeness, rates of acid deposition were also calculated. Acid deposition 
derives from both sulphur and nitrogen. It is expressed in terms of kiloequivalents 
(keq) per hectare per year. The thresholds against which acid deposition is 
assessed are referred to as the Critical Load Function. The principle is similar to 
that for a nitrogen deposition Critical Load.  
1 The addition of nitrogen is a form of fertilization, which can have a negative effect on habitats over time by encouraging more 
competitive plant species that can force out the less competitive species that are more characteristic of such habitats.

1.3.18 The LSEs are assessed in relation to aerial pollutant concentrations (NOx only) and 
the resultant change in acid and nitrogen deposition at Natura 2000 sites within 
10km of the proposed stack.  
1.3.19 Table 1-6 presents the process contribution (PCs) from the proposed Project (worst 
case) and the resultant acid and nitrogen deposition rates in comparison to the 
relevant critical loads for each of the Natura 2000 sites identified within 10km of the 
Project Site.  The worst case has been assumed to be the maximum number of 
hours that the plant can operate and a stack height of 35 m.  The Power 
Generation Plant is a peaking site and will therefore only operate during periods of 
high power demand.  It is therefore anticipated that the site will normally operate for 
1,500 hours per year, but may operate for up to a maximum of 2,250 hours per 
year, as secured by a DCO Requirement in the draft DCO (Document Reference 
3.1).  The maximum number of hours that the plant can operate will be set out in 
the site's Environmental Permit and this operating period cannot be exceeded.  A 
minimum stack height of 35 m has been proposed by APL for the proposed Project 
and a maximum height of 45 m. Air quality modelling informed the minimum and 
maximum stack height as presented in ES Appendix 6.1. The assessment of 
impacts at ecological receptors has, therefore, used a stack height of 35 m as this 
represents the worst-case in terms of dispersion.   
1.3.20 For Natura 2000 sites where habitats are not the designated feature for the site (for 
example, an SPA with a designated feature of Oystercatcher), the effects of air 
quality have been assessed for the habitat on which the species or assemblage is 
reliant (for example, saltmarsh).  
1.3.21 In April 2017 a High Court judgment3 (colloquially known as the Ashdown Forest 
judgment) partially quashed the Lewes District and South Downs National Park 
Joint Core Strategy in England. This was on the basis that the HRA supporting the 
Joint Core Strategy only considered its own contribution in determining whether 
there would be a likely significant air quality effect on Ashdown Forest SPA. The 
judge ruled that the HRA had thus explicitly failed to undertake any form of 
assessment ‘in combination’ and that this was in contravention of the Conservation 
of Habitats and Species Regulations 2010 (now repealed and replaced by the 2017 
Regulations).  Previously, air quality impact assessments enabled likely significant 
effects to be immediately dismissed without further consideration if the contribution 
of the project in question fell below 1% of the critical level (for NOx) or critical load 
(for nitrogen deposition). In that context no assessment ‘in combination’ was 
required. However, in light of the above High Court judgment, this HRA does not 
rely on the use of that 1% threshold to dismiss the need to consider ‘in combination’ 
effects. 
1.3.22 The information in Table 1-6 and 1-7 is based on the air quality modelling provided 
by the Applicant with a stack height of 35m (the worst case as noted above). The 
results of the modelling are set out in Appendix A, Table 1-9, Table 1-10 and Table

1-11 in which the worst case has been provided for each relevant Nature 2000 site 
using the receptor most sensitive to acid and nitrogen for each site.  
1.3.23 In the tables below, nitrogen and acid deposition are rounded up to two decimal 
places to avoid false precision4. As such, the lowest deposition rates are reported 
as ‘< 0.01 kgN/ha/yr’ and represent negligible deposition.  
4 Convention dictates that the number of significant figures used in the presentation of data should be limited to what is warranted by the 
precision of those data.

Summary of Likely Significant Effects Screening 
a) Water Quality
1.4.1 
Due to the standard-practice use of mobile welfare facilities during construction and 
operational maintenance, there will be no inputs of treated wastewater and runoff 
and/or pollution during construction and operational maintenance.  
1.4.2 
During operation discharges from the package treatment plant will be controlled via 
an Environmental Permit. There will be very low levels of discharges due to the low 
numbers of people on Site during operation. The discharges will disperse over a 
long distance before entering Carmarthen Bay and Estuaries SAC and Burry Inlet 
SPA and Ramsar. 
1.4.3 
There will be no LSEs on any Natura 2000 sites within 10 km associated with water 
quality.   
b) Air Quality
1.4.4 
Only NOx has been modelled as an emitted pollutant; no other relevant pollutants 
are expected (such as sulphur dioxide).  Impacts due to emissions of sulphur 
dioxide and, by inference deposition of sulphur, have been scoped out of the 
assessment since natural gas is an inherently low sulphur fuel. However, 
background levels of sulphur deposition are considered in the assessment of 
acidification.  
1.4.5 
For all receptors, the annual (long-term) average and 24hr (short-term) average 
PEC (Predicted Environmental Concentration i.e. the total concentration including 
the Project) for NOx is forecast to be well below the critical level of 30 
micrograms/cubic metre (for long-term NOx) and 75 micrograms/cubic metre (for 
short-term NOx). Since the critical level will not be breached there are no grounds 
to conclude a likely significant effect based on atmospheric concentrations alone.  
i.
Nitrogen Disposition
1.4.6 
Considering the forecast change in nitrogen deposition rates due to the Project, the 
PC is extremely small being less than 0.01kgN/ha/yr in all instances. This is so 
small that it effectively represents no forecast change in nitrogen deposition, 
compared to the baseline.  
1.4.7 
For Carmarthen Bay and Estuaries SAC and Burry Inlet SPA and Ramsar site, 
where the current background levels for nitrogen are within the critical loads for the 
most sensitive receptor or most sensitive habitat on which a receptor is reliant at 
each of the sites, these increases are concluded not to have a LSE on either site.  
1.4.8 
For Crymlyn Bog SAC and Ramsar the background level is already in exceedance 
of the critical load for nitrogen for the most sensitive receptor or most sensitive 
habitat on which a receptor is reliant at the site. However, the increase arising from 
Abergelli Power Station – No Significant Effects Report 
Prepared for:  Abergelli Power Limited  
AECOM 
1-22 
the Project is deemed to be so small that it can be concluded the increase will not 
have a LSE on the site.  
1.4.9 
In published data on nitrogen dose-response relationships (Ref. 1.5) it has been 
shown that no habitats studied to date are responsive to such small incremental 
changes in nitrogen deposition. For example, Table 21 of Caporn et al 2016 (Ref. 
1.5) list all investigated habitats including heathland, bogs, sand dunes and acid 
grassland. Even the most sensitive habitat presented in the table (sand dunes) 
required a dose of at least 0.1 kgN/ha/yr (an order of magnitude greater than the 
PC of the Project) to effect a change in species richness (defined as a reduction of 
at least 1 species), even at a very low background deposition rate of 5 kg/ha/yr. 
Most habitats studied required a considerably greater dose at low background 
rates. Habitats that were studied that are pertinent to this Project included bog 
(raised and blanket). Bog is the most sensitive out of all the receptors for the 
Natura 2000 sites with a critical load of 5 – 10 kgN/ha/yr.  
1.4.10 The studies also indicate that the effect of adding a given amount of nitrogen is not 
simple, linear and additive as is often assumed but depends heavily on the existing 
nitrogen deposition. As such the response of vegetation to nitrogen deposition is far 
more subtle that the ‘black and white’ critical load concept suggests. In bog, for 
example, at background deposition rates of 15 – 20kgN/ha/yr an increase of 
3.3kgN/ha/yr would be required to reduce species richness by one species. Note 
that this does not mean any species would be ‘lost’ from the affected area, just that 
one species would occur at a reduced frequency. The study illustrates the fairly 
subtle effect of nitrogen deposition at moderately high background rates.  
1.4.11 Although woodland and fen are not included in the report in terms of deriving dose-
response relationships the report indicates that the same broad pattern of response 
can be applied to fen and woodland habitats (at least at woodland edges which will 
be more exposed to pollutants).  
1.4.12 As such, the extremely small PC of than 0.01kgN/ha/yr would have no perceptible 
effect on any of the habitats within any of the Natura 2000 sites.  
ii.
Nitrogen Acid Deposition
1.4.13 None of the receptors for Carmarthen Bay and Estuaries SAC are sensitive to 
nitrogen acid deposition.  
1.4.14 For Crymlyn Bog SAC and Ramsar the PC is less than 0.01keqH+/ha/yr and so low 
as to be effectively zero. Although the background level is above the critical load for 
the most sensitive receptor, any increase less than 0.01keqH+/ha/yr will not cause 
a measurable exceedance of the critical load for nitrogen acid at the site. 
1.4.15 For Burry Inlet SPA and Ramsar the PC is less than 0.01keqH+/ha/yr and so low as 
to be effectively zero. Furthermore, the background level is below the critical load 
for the most sensitive receptor, and as such any increase less than 
0.01keqH+/ha/yr will not cause an exceedance of the critical load for nitrogen acid 
at the site.

In-Combination Effects 
1.5.1 
The Conservation of Habitats and Species Regulations 2017 state that when 
considering whether a specific plan or project is likely to have a significant effect on 
a Natura 2000 Site, consideration should be given to the effect of the proposal 
alone and in-combination with other plans and projects. Part of the HRA process is 
to identify the plans, programmes and projects that could have in-combination 
effects. The PINS Advice Note Ten: Habitat Regulations Assessment relevant to 
Nationally Significant Infrastructure Projects (January 2016) states that in 
assessing in-combination effects the following projects should be considered:  

Projects that are under construction;

Permitted application(s) not yet implemented;

Submitted application(s) not yet determined;

All refusals subject to appeal procedures not yet determined;

Projects on the National Infrastructure’s programme of projects5; and

Projects identified in the Swansea Unitary Development Plan  and emerging
development plans (Swansea Deposit Local Development Plan) with
appropriate weight being given as they move closer to adoption, recognising
that much information on relevant proposals will be limited and the degree of
uncertainty which may be present.
1.5.2 
The projects which have been researched are shown in Table 1-8 below.  Table 1-
12 in Appendix C provides the results of a screening exercise for each of the 
developments to demonstrate that there are no Likely Significant Effects from the 
Project in-combination with other projects. The Table 1-12 briefly summarises the 
level of data or information available in relation to each project, which in all cases is 
limited. On the basis of the information available, using professional judgment and 
adopting the precautionary principle, it is considered that the screening exercise is 
robust.

a) Water Quality
1.5.3 
There are no inputs during construction in relation to water quality from the Project 
that can act in combination with other projects and this will be the same for 
decommissioning.  
1.5.4 
The inputs from Project wastewater discharges during operation are likely to be so 
small as to be well within the natural daily fluctuations of the nutrient levels within 
the Carmarthen Bay and Estuaries SAC and Burry Inlet SPA and Ramsar and 
therefore immeasurable in-combination with other projects. There is considered to 
be no LSE as a result of wastewater discharges from the Project acting in-
combination with wastewater discharges from other projects.  
b) Air Quality
1.5.5 
Transport related emissions are most relevant to sites within 200 m of a major road. 
The Design Manual for Roads and Bridges (DMRB) (Ref. 1.3) identifies 200 m as 
the distance beyond which the contribution of traffic emissions to local pollutant 
concentrations is considered to be negligible.  There are no roads within 200 m of 
any Natura 2000 site that are forecast to receive anything other than a nominal 
short term change in vehicle flows as a result of this Project.    
1.5.6 
There will be extremely low traffic flows expected as part of the construction and 
operation of the Project, and the operational traffic flows from the Project will not 
make a significant contribution to any in-combination effects and will be within the 
average daily variations of traffic flows.  
1.5.7 
A number of projects are likely to contribute to local pollutant concentrations 
through traffic emissions – using M4 Junction 46 and the B4489. However, there 
are no Natura 2000 sites located within 200 m of these locations.   
1.5.8 
There is no opportunity for a LSE as a result of traffic emissions from the Project 
acting in-combination with traffic emissions from other projects.  
1.5.9 
Projects with point source emissions have been considered for the in-combination 
assessment where deposition of those emissions may be geographically coincident 
with this Project.  Two projects have been identified to be included in the in-
combination assessment:

associated works.

LDP Policies RP7 and RP8, paragraph 2.14.28 (Preferred Locations). Former
Tip Site, Felindre. Preferred areas for new waste management facilities include
the former Tip site at Felindre. The site at Felindre is identified specifically for
the potential to accommodate a Combined Heat and Power (CHP) Facility
which could provide heat or power for adjacent proposed developments.
1.5.10 The planning application for the Land at Abergelli emergency standby electricity 
generation facility was refused on 16 October 2015. The applicant has stated that 
there is no intention of resubmitting the application or to appeal of the decision 
notice (and the time for submitting an appeal has now expired).  
1.5.11 The Former Tip Site, Felindre Combined Heat and Power (CHP) Facility is a 
preferred location in the Deposit Local Development Plan policy, and is therefore at 
an early stage in the (potential) consenting process. As such no planning 
application or background information is available to undertake in-combination air 
quality modelling or assessment.  The Deposit Local Development Plan is currently 
at Examination and as a result only limited weight can be attached to the allocation.  
1.6 
Conclusion 
a)
Introduction
1.6.1 
This section summarises the potential effects of the proposed Project and 
considers whether the requirement to proceed to Stage Two of the HRA process 
(Appropriate Assessment) is triggered in relation to the proposed Project.  
1.6.2 
An Appropriate Assessment is necessary when the screening exercise concludes 
that a project, alone or in combination with other plans or projects, is likely to give 
rise to significant effects on a Natura 2000 site. When required, an Appropriate 
Assessment considers the impact of the project on the integrity of the Natura 2000 
site having regard to the site’s conservation objectives.  
b)
Potential Effects
1.6.3 
There are no LSEs on Natura 2000 sites within 10 km of the proposed development 
associated with water quality – as a result of wastewater discharges, pollution or 
runoff - or air quality – nitrogen and nitrogen acid deposition as a result of NOx 
emissions - from the proposed Project alone or in-combination with projects.  
1.6.4 
No other impacts arising from the construction, operation or decommissioning of 
the Project have the potential to have an impact on any Natura 2000 sites.  
1.6.5 
Therefore the Appropriate Assessment – Stage Two of the HRA – process is not 
required.

1.6.6 
The Applicant remains committed to consultation with NRW and will continue to 
discuss the air quality aspects of the proposed development in the period before 
Examination of the DCO application. It is the Applicant's intention to agree a 
Statement of Common Ground with NRW covering the matters included in this 
report and it is proposed that further meetings and dialogue will take place as 
necessary between the Applicant and NRW with that objective.

Evidence supporting conclusions: 
 
a. Section 1.3.8 and Section 1.4.1 of the No Significant Effects Report states that the embedded mitigation for construction (to 
be secured under the Construction Environmental Management Plan (CEMP)) will include measures to control pollution, 
storage of potential pollutants, and precautionary measures will help to limit the likelihood and effects of pollution incidents 
and/or runoff in line with best practice and guidelines. The drainage strategy for the Project Site will include filter drains / 
swales or oil interceptors as necessary to remove pollutants and all necessary treatment will take place within the Project 
Site before it is discharged to the existing watercourses. There are deemed to be no Likely Significant Effects on the features 
as a result of pollution and/or runoff generated during construction.  
b. Section 1.3.7 and Section 1.4.1 of the No Significant Effects Report states that during construction and operational 
maintenance temporary toilets with appropriate foul waste facility will be in place and all foul waste generated during this 
period will be taken off-site for disposal at appropriate facilities. No impact on water receptors is expected and there are 
deemed to be no Likely Significant Effects on the features as a result of wastewater generated during construction and 
operational maintenance. 
c. There is a hydrological connection between the Project Site and Carmarthen Bay and Estuaries SAC  via the Afon Llan. 
Leaving the Project Site, the Afon Llan flows for approximately 12 km before reaching the Afon Lliw and flowing into the 
Natura 2000 site.  
HRA Screening Matrices for Abergelli Power Project 
 
 
Appendix 1 Screening Matrices 
Page 6 
Sections 1.3.5 and 1.4.2 of the No Significant Effects Report state that the drainage strategy has considered the use of 
either septic tanks within the site or a package sewage treatment plants for foul effluent. However, package treatment 
plants are the preferred option, subject to detailed design following completion of ground investigations.  
Due to the small quantity of foul water generated during operation, it is anticipated that treated water can be discharged via 
infiltration (soakaway) on site. The foul water drainage system will be positioned to minimise the risk of inundation by 
floodwaters.  
Where there is an inadequate unsaturated zone beneath the site, the option of discharging to local watercourses will be 
adopted. Any discharges will be subject to the Environmental Permitting Regulations and will meet quality criteria set by 
NRW.  
Chapter 9 (Water Quality and Flood Risk) of the Environmental Statement (Abergelli Power Project Environmental 
Statement, AECOM, 2018) states that given the quantity of treated wastewater likely to be generated from the packaged 
sewage treatment plant and dilution properties of the receiving receptors, the magnitude of pollution impacts from 
discharges is considered to be Negligible.  
There are deemed to be no Likely Significant Effects associated with wastewater discharges resulting from the operation of 
the Project on the designated site features.  
d. Sections 1.1.17 – 1.1.19 detail the decommissioning phase of the Project. Section 1.3.9 states that potential effects on 
water quality during decommissioning are likely to be the same as for construction and will be controlled similarly. There are 
considered to be no Likely Significant Effects associated with water quality resulting from the decommissioning phase of the 
Project. 
e. Table 1-8 provides a list pf projects that have the potential to act in combination with the Project. Table 1-12 provides the 
results of a screening exercise for each of the projects to demonstrate that the effects from the Project acting in-
combination with the projects are not significant. The Table briefly summarises the level of data or information available in 
relation to each project, which in all cases is limited.  
f. Section 1.5.3 of the No Significant Effects Report states that there are no inputs during construction in relation to water 
quality from the Project that can act in combination with other projects, this is likely the same for decommissioning.  
g. Section 1.5.4 of the No Significant Effects Report states that the inputs from Project wastewater discharges during operation 
are likely to be so small as to be within the natural daily fluctuations of the nutrient levels within the Carmarthen Bay and 
Estuaries SAC and therefore immeasurable in-combination with other projects. There is considered to be no Likely 
Significant Effect as a result of wastewater discharges from the Project acting in-combination with wastewater discharges 
from other projects. 
h. Section 1.3.10 states that there are no roads within 200 m of any Natura 2000 site that are forecast to receive anything 
other than a nominal short term change in vehicle flows as a result of the construction and operation of the Project.

Transport related emissions are most relevant to sites within 200 m of a major road. The Design Manual for Roads and 
Bridges (DMRB) identifies 200 m as the distance beyond which the contribution of traffic emissions to local pollutant 
concentrations is considered to be negligible. There are considered to be no Likely Significant Effects associated with traffic 
emissions related air quality as a result of the construction or operation phases of the Project.  
i. Potential effects of traffic related emissions during decommissioning are likely to be the same as for construction. There are 
considered to be no Likely Significant Effects associated with traffic emission related air quality resulting from the 
decommissioning phase of the Project.  
j. Sections 1.5.6 – 1.5.8 state there will be extremely low traffic flows expected as part of the construction and operation of 
the Project, and the operational traffic flows from the Project will not make a significant contribution to any in-combination 
effects and will be within the average daily variations of traffic flows. A number of projects are likely to contribute to local 
pollutant concentrations through traffic emissions - using M4 Junction 46 and the B4489. However, there are no Natura 
2000 sites located within 200 m of these locations.  This is likely to be the same for decommissioning. There is no 
opportunity for a Likely Significant Effect as a result of traffic emissions from the Project acting in-combination with traffic 
emissions from other projects.  
k. Table 1-6, Table 1-7, Table 1-9, Table 1-10 and Table 1-11 of the No Significant Effects Report show the potential effects of 
NOx, nitrogen and nitrogen acidity on the most sensitive receptor of Carmarthen Bay and Estuaries SAC. Section 1.4.6 – 
1.4.7 states that the process contributions are extremely small for nitrogen (<0.01kgN/ha/yr) and the current background 
levels for nitrogen are within the critical loads for the most sensitive receptor at the site the increase is concluded not to 
have a LSE on the site. Section 1.4.13 states that none of the receptors for the site are sensitive to nitrogen acidity 
deposition.  
l. 
Table 1-8 and Sections 1.5.9 – 1.5.11 provide a summary of the projects and plans provided by the local authority for an in-
combination assessment. One project that was refused planning has point source emissions; the promoter has stated they 
do not intend to resubmit the application or to appeal against the refusal. There is a point source emitter within the Local 
Development Plan; however there is no information on the plan since it is a preferred location only and as such it is not 
possible to obtain air quality data. It is concluded that there are no point source emitters that would contribute to an in-
combination effect with the emissions from the proposed Project.

Evidence supporting conclusions: 
 
a. Section 1.3.8 and Section 1.4.1 of the No Significant Effects Report states that the embedded mitigation for construction (to 
be secured under the Construction Environmental Management Plan (CEMP)) will include measures to control pollution, 
storage of potential pollutants, and precautionary measures will help to limit the likelihood and effects of pollution incidents 
and/or runoff in line with best practice and guidelines. The drainage strategy for the Project Site will include filter drains / 
swales or oil interceptors as necessary to remove pollutants and all necessary treatment will take place within the Project 
Site before it is discharged to the existing watercourses. There are deemed to be no Likely Significant Effects on the features 
as a result of pollution and/or runoff generated during construction.  
b. Section 1.3.7 and Section 1.4.1 of the No Significant Effects Report states that during construction and operational 
maintenance temporary toilets with appropriate foul waste facility will be in place and all foul waste generated during this 
period will be taken off-site for disposal at appropriate facilities. No impact on water receptors is expected and there are 
deemed to be no Likely Significant Effects on the features as a result of wastewater generated during construction and 
operational maintenance. 
c. There is a hydrological connection between the Project Site and Burry Inlet Ramsar via the Afon Llan. Leaving the Project 
Site, the Afon Llan flows for approximately 12 km before reaching the Afon Lliw and flowing into the Natura 2000 site.  
Sections 1.3.5 and 1.4.2 of the No Significant Effects Report state that the drainage strategy has considered the use of 
either septic tanks within the site or a package sewage treatment plants for foul effluent. However, package treatment 
plants are the preferred option, subject to detailed design following completion of ground investigations.  
Due to the small quantity of foul water generated during operation, it is anticipated that treated water can be discharged via 
infiltration (soakaway) on site. The foul water drainage system will be positioned to minimise the risk of inundation by 
floodwaters.  
Where there is an inadequate unsaturated zone beneath the site, the option of discharging to local watercourses will be 
adopted. Any discharges will be subject to the Environmental Permitting Regulations and will meet quality criteria set by 
NRW.  
Chapter 9 (Water Quality and Flood Risk) of the Environmental Statement (Abergelli Power Project Environmental 
Statement, AECOM, 2018) states that given the quantity of treated wastewater likely to be generated from the packaged 
sewage treatment plant and dilution properties of the receiving receptors, the magnitude of pollution impacts from 
discharges is considered to be Negligible.

Appendix 1 Screening Matrices 
Page 19 
There are deemed to be no Likely Significant Effects associated with wastewater discharges resulting from the operation of 
the Project on the designated site features.  
d. Sections 1.1.17 – 1.1.19 detail the decommissioning phase of the Project. Section 1.3.9 states that potential effects on 
water quality during decommissioning are likely to be the same as for construction and will be controlled similarly. There are 
considered to be no Likely Significant Effects associated with water quality resulting from the decommissioning phase of the 
Project. 
e. Table 1-8 provides a list pf projects that have the potential to act in combination with the Project. Table 1-12 provides the 
results of a screening exercise for each of the projects to demonstrate that the effects from the Project acting in-
combination with the projects are not significant. The Table briefly summarises the level of data or information available in 
relation to each project, which in all cases is limited.  
f. Section 1.5.3 of the No Significant Effects Report states that there are no inputs during construction in relation to water 
quality from the Project that can act in combination with other projects, this is likely the same for decommissioning.  
g. Section 1.5.4 of the No Significant Effects Report states that the inputs from Project wastewater discharges during operation 
are likely to be so small as to be within the natural daily fluctuations of the nutrient levels within Burry Inlet Ramsar and 
therefore immeasurable in-combination with other projects. There is considered to be no Likely Significant Effect as a result 
of wastewater discharges from the Project acting in-combination with wastewater discharges from other projects. 
h. Section 1.3.10 states that there are no roads within 200 m of any Natura 2000 site that are forecast to receive anything 
other than a nominal short term change in vehicle flows as a result of the construction and operation of the Project. 
Transport related emissions are most relevant to sites within 200 m of a major road. The Design Manual for Roads and 
Bridges (DMRB) identifies 200 m as the distance beyond which the contribution of traffic emissions to local pollutant 
concentrations is considered to be negligible. There are considered to be no Likely Significant Effects associated with traffic 
emissions related air quality as a result of the construction or operation phases of the Project.  
i. Potential effects of traffic related emissions during decommissioning are likely to be the same as for construction. There are 
considered to be no Likely Significant Effects associated with traffic emission related air quality resulting from the 
decommissioning phase of the Project.  
j. Sections 1.5.6 – 1.5.8 state there will be extremely low traffic flows expected as part of the construction and operation of 
the Project, and the operational traffic flows from the Project will not make a significant contribution to any in-combination 
effects and will be within the average daily variations of traffic flows. A number of projects are likely to contribute to local 
pollutant concentrations through traffic emissions - using M4 Junction 46 and the B4489. However, there are no Natura 
2000 sites located within 200 m of these locations.  This is likely to be the same for decommissioning. There is no 
opportunity for a Likely Significant Effect as a result of traffic emissions from the Project acting in-combination with traffic 
emissions from other projects.

k. Table 1-6, Table 1-7, Table 1-9, Table 1-10 and Table 1-11 of the No Significant Effects report show the potential effects of 
NOx, nitrogen and nitrogen acidity on the most sensitive habitat on which a receptor of Burry Inlet Ramsar is reliant. Section 
1.4.6 – 1.4.7 states that the process contributions are extremely small for nitrogen (<0.01kgN/ha/yr) and the current 
background levels for nitrogen are within the critical loads for the most sensitive receptor at the site the increase is 
concluded not to have a LSE on the site. Section 1.4.15 states that the process contribution for nitrogen acidity deposition is 
so low (<0.01keqH+/ha/yr) that it will not cause an exceedance of the critical load for nitrogen acidity at the site.  
l. Table 1-8 and Sections 1.5.9 – 1.5.11 provide a summary of the projects and plans provided by the local authority for an in-
combination assessment. One project that was refused planning has point source emissions; the promoter has stated they 
do not intend to resubmit the application or to appeal against the refusal. There is a point source emitter within the Local 
Development Plan; however there is no information on the plan since it is a preferred location only and as such it is not 
possible to obtain air quality data. It is concluded that there are no point source emitters that would contribute to an in-
combination effect with the emissions from the proposed Project.

Appendix C HRA Cumulative Assessment Screening Table 1-12 
Projects considered for the in-combination assessment are presented in Table 1-8.  The following table (Table 1-12) provides the results of a screening exercise for each of the projects to demonstrate 
that the effects from the Project acting in-combination with the projects are not significant. The Table summarises the level of data or information available in relation to each project, which in all cases 
is limited. On the basis of the information available, using professional judgment and adopting the precautionary principle, it is considered that the screening exercise is robust.
