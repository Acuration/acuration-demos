Welcome to the first edition of the Electric Insights Quarterly, a new report to inform the 
debate on Britain’s electricity system.
The sector is undergoing unprecedented changes from obligations to decarbonise, pressure 
to keep bills down and fears about ‘keeping the lights on’. We are seeing old coal driven off 
the system, new nuclear given the go-ahead, prices reaching new highs and lows, and clean 
energy overtaking fossil fuels for the first time. It is an exciting, but challenging, time for this 
130 year old system.
Electric Insights contributes to these important topics by bringing to life the wealth of raw 
data that are made publicly available by National Grid and Elexon, who run the electricity 
network and balancing market respectively. It will focus on supply and demand, prices, 
emissions, the performance of the various generation technologies and the network that 
connects them.
Electric Insights will be published once a quarter, and is backed up by an interactive website 
www.ElectricInsights.co.uk which provides live data from 2009 until the present. The data 
sources and methodology used in Electric Insights are listed in full on the website.
This project was commissioned by Drax Group, owners of Drax Power Station in Yorkshire, 
once the UK’s largest source of CO2 emissions and now the largest biomass-fuelled station  
in Europe. It is delivered independently by a team of academics from Imperial College London, 
facilitated by the College’s consultancy company - Imperial Consultants.

This issue focusses on the period July to September 2016 and looks at the rise of clean 
energy, how it has halved CO2 emissions in the last five years, and the impacts this is having. 
For the first time, low-carbon energy sources have produced more than half of Britain’s 
electricity, fuelled by the dramatic rise of renewable energy. Wind, solar and biomass have 
grown to supply 20% this quarter.
Combined with renewed competition from gas as fuel prices fall, this has pushed coal almost 
completely off the system. This time four years ago coal supplied 38% of Britain’s electricity; 
this quarter year it was just 3%. Coal provided a smaller share than either wind, solar or 
biomass, a symbolic moment in the transition towards clean energy.
As a result, per-unit carbon emissions from electricity consumption are at their lowest ever. 
Each unit of electricity now contains less than half the carbon it did four years ago, falling 
to a low of 221 kg of CO2 per megawatt hour. This pace of decarbonisation is a welcome 
surprise, coming well ahead of the UK’s legal requirements to reduce emissions.
The rise of intermittent renewables is dramatically changing the way the electricity system 
works. The operating patterns of conventional plants are having to change, and the 
‘breathing space’ for flexible plants is being eroded during times of low demand and high 
renewable output. This is being seen in wholesale market prices, with this quarter seeing 
both the highest price for several years (£802/MWh) when supply was tight during the 
September heatwave, and an all-time low price of –£99/MWh due to surplus renewables.
Rising low-carbon generation, falling coal and emissions and volatile prices – is this the ‘new 
normal’ for British electricity?

This quarter saw a major milestone quietly creep up on the industry: for the first time 
more than half of Britain’s electricity came from low-carbon sources. The share of nuclear, 
biomass, hydro, wind, solar and French imports peaked at 50.2%. This share has risen 
gradually from just 20% in 2010 and the trend is showing no signs of slowing down, although 
high-carbon generation will be greater in the winter months due to higher demand.
Nuclear provided the largest share, at 26%. Renewables provided a further 20%, spurred  
on by continued growth in capacity. Britain now has over 26 GW of wind and solar installed, 
a six-fold increase on six years ago; while biomass has increased from nothing to 2 GW.
Britain imported 7% of its electricity this quarter. Three-fifths of this came from France, 
where 94% is produced from nuclear and renewables, and so deserves to be classed as low-
carbon. The remainder came from the Netherlands and Ireland, which are still predominantly 
powered by coal and gas.

With the rise of clean energy and the switch from coal to gas, the carbon intensity of 
Britain’s electricity is at an all-time low. Emissions are down a third from this time last year 
and 56% lower than four years ago. During Q3, electricity consumption released 15 MT of 
CO2, around two tonnes per second.
Three quarters of emissions came from burning gas and 14% from burning coal. The rest 
were released abroad either in producing electricity we imported (8%) or producing and 
transporting biomass fuel (2%). The charts below show the amount of CO2 released by each 
technology, comparing Q3 2012 with 2016. The height of each block shows the carbon 
content per unit of electricity generated – coal releases more than twice the carbon of gas, 
which releases more than three times as much as biomass.* The width of each block shows 
how much electricity they produced each quarter. Putting these together, the area of each 
coloured block relates to the total emissions.
Most striking is the switch from coal to gas. Emissions from gas are up 55% in absolute 
terms, but this has pushed down coal output to give a considerable net saving. The total Q3 
output from fossil fuels also fell 32% over these four years, from 46 to 31 TWh. Demand fell 
7% over the four years so less output was needed, and the growth of low-carbon biomass 
and zero-carbon wind and solar can be seen to the right.

ago. Each grid square represents 1 million tonnes of CO2 released:
Footnotes:
* We report the supply chain emissions of biomass, but not of coal and gas for the sake of simplicity. In reality, emissions from producing 
and transporting fossil fuels increase the carbon intensities shown in the chart by around 10% for coal and 25% for gas.

Britain’s electricity was completely coal-free for nearly six days over the last quarter. Coal 
plants have been pushed off the system by competition from gas, nuclear and renewables. 
May the 5th 2016 was a historic day, the first time since 1881 that Britain burnt no coal to 
produce its electricity. Far from being a one- off, this has continued to become the norm 
over summer.
Coal plant utilisation has fallen to its lowest ever levels, producing just 7% of their maximum 
capacity – less than half the productivity of Britain’s solar panels over the quarter. Coal 
output normally swings with the seasons, falling in summer when demand (and gas prices) 
are at their lowest, and when plants go offline for their annual maintenance.
A quarter of Britain’s coal stations shut down over the last 12 months due to clean air 
legislation or to stem their financial losses. The plants which remain still ran with utilisation 
around 30 percentage points lower than in previous years.
After five years being cheaper, generating electricity from coal is now more expensive than 
from gas. While international gas prices have been falling for the last two years, so has the 
price of coal, and the switch is largely due to the UK’s Carbon Price Floor, which rose to  
£18/TCO2 last year. Without that boost over the (much lower) EU carbon price, gas would 
still be around 20% more expensive than coal (per MWh output) and emissions would 
undoubtedly be higher.
While very little coal has been needed during the summer months, some fear that the system 
will find it harder to cope during times of winter stress without these dispatchable plants.

Average electricity prices over the quarter remained stable at £37/MWh, but from hour 
to hour they are becoming more volatile. Negative power prices are happening more 
frequently, and this quarter saw the highest power prices for several years.
The price of electricity on the wholesale spot market has been falling gradually from a high 
of £56/MWh in 2013, whereas the cost of balancing the system has doubled over the same 
period to £2.75/MWh this quarter.
Britain saw its first negative power prices during the summer of 2015, following in the 
footsteps of Germany and Denmark which have seen negative prices since 2008 and 2009. 
This quarter saw 45 trading periods with zero or negative prices – twice as many as during 
the whole of 2015. These ranged down to –£99/MWh, and mostly occurred on weekend 
afternoons with high wind and solar output.
At the other extreme, Thursday 15th of September was notable as it saw the highest 
peak prices in 3 years. Evening peak prices rose above £200/MWh for three days in a row, 
culminating in a price of £802/MWh on the 15th. Such prices are not unheard-of; they were 
a regular feature in the 2000s, and are a signal to investors to build more capacity.
The likely cause: difficult circumstances coming together at once. Demand was high due to the 
unexpected Indian summer, wind output was low, and several thermal plants were offline for 
maintenance. The cost of bringing on extra coal and gas units to meet evening demand was 
higher than usual, as they were required at short notice and for only a short period of time.

The move from dispatchable fossil towards weather-dependent renewables is forcing 
the power system into new territory. Britain experienced its lowest ever demand net of 
renewables, due to high wind and low demand overnight on Sunday 21st of August.
At its minimum, less than 13 GW came from synchronous generators, the spinning turbines 
that act as shock absorbers for the system. Of this, only 4.7 GW were flexible plants (i.e. 
non-nuclear). Prior to 2013, this minimum had never fallen below 10 GW. Renewables are 
reducing the need for conventional supply, while consumption is falling 1.5% per year.
The chart below compares September 25th in 2011 and 2016: both Sundays which averaged 
15.5–16°C. Demand was 3 GW lower in 2016 because of improving efficiency and other 
societal changes. Solar PV reduced net demand by a further 5.5 GW at its peak, pulling 
daytime demand down to levels previously seen overnight.
The resulting shape of net demand (red line), which dispatchable generators must follow, is 
very different from five years ago. The daytime peak from 8 AM to 10 PM has been replaced 
by a much shorter evening peak starting at 4 PM. 10 GW of dispatchable plant had to ramp 
up in the afternoon, but these were only needed for six hours instead of 12 hours or more, 
meaning they have to charge more per hour to recover their start-up costs.

The last twelve months saw 3.2 GW of new wind and solar farms come online and a quarter 
of the country’s coal capacity go offline. Ironbridge, Ferrybridge and Rugeley closed, as did 
Longannet – the last coal plant in Scotland.
Nuclear capacity also fell slightly as Wylfa retired. Output from gas and nuclear was up on 
this quarter last year, with nuclear plants recording their highest availability for seven years. 
Coal output plummeted as a result.
The average capacity factor of wind was around a third lower than its long-term average, 
and for solar it was around a third above its average. This is typical for the time of year as 
summer has the lowest wind speeds and highest sunshine hours.
