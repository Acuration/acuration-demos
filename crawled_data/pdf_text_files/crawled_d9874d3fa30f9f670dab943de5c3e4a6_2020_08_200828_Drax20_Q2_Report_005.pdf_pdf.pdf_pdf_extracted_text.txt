1. Headlines
Electricity under lockdown: cheaper, cleaner, but harder to 
control. April, May and June saw daily life heavily restricted 
for most of the Great British public. Millions of people were 
furloughed or working from home, with shops shuttered up 
and down the country. This complete reworking of society 
continued to have unprecedented impacts on the power 
system (see right).
It has been said that COVID is giving the energy sector a 
glimpse at its future. Reduced mobility shows how mass 
uptake of EVs may rock the oil industry. The slump in oil 
demand butted up against brittle and inflexible producers 
to force oil prices negative for the first time in history. 
Similarly, lower electricity demand combined with exceptional 
weather to propel renewables to their greatest ever share of 
electricity, forcing down prices, emissions and the need for 
nuclear and fossil fuels.
The spot-market value of Britain’s electricity halved over the 
last 12 months, as demand remained depressed and wholesale 
prices hit their lowest in a decade.
Britain’s electricity over the last quarter was also the cleanest 
it has ever been. Carbon emissions were one-third lower than 
this time last year, and the carbon intensity of electricity fell 
to an all-time low of 18 g/kWh on the Spring Bank Holiday. 
May was also the first ever month when absolutely no 
electricity was generated from coal. The longest zero-coal run 
was smashed, lasting for 67 days straight.
For the first time, Britain’s solar panels supplied more than 
10% of Britain’s electricity demand over a month during May. 
Lower demand combined with higher renewable generation 
meant National Grid ESO had to spend more than ever on 
keeping the system stable. Balancing prices have shot up 
from being just 5% of wholesale prices to 20%.

2. Electricity prices plummet
Power prices have fallen to their lowest in nearly two 
decades. Prices are down by two-thirds over the last two 
years, reaching a minimum of just £22/MWh over the month 
of May. Britain spent £1.3 billion less on electricity supply over 
the second quarter of this year compared to last year. The total 
cost of generation (based on wholesale prices plus balancing 
charges) fell from £3.0 to £1.7 billion over the three months.
Oil prices halved over the last year, going from $60 a barrel 
during Q2 of 2019 down to just $28 averaged over the last 
quarter. Gas prices fell 58% over the same period, but while a 
third of Britain’s electricity comes from natural gas, fuel isn’t 
the only thing to affect power prices.
Lower demand for electricity drives its price lower. When 
fewer power stations are needed, only the most efficient (and 
cheapest) ones stay online. When pushed to the extreme, 
National Grid must ask renewables and even nuclear reactors 
to reduce their output to avoid instability. And just as  
US oil prices turned negative briefly in April due to excess 
production, oversupply of electricity routinely forces power 
prices below zero.
The chart at the bottom of this page illustrates this effect. 
At times when less than 10 GW of conventional, dispatchable 
generators were needed, prices plummeted below zero. 
There is of course a lot of scatter (in some hours prices went 
negative at 14 GW, sometimes they were still positive at 7 
GW), but the trend is clear.

demand’ (demand minus wind 
and solar output) and power

COVID has resulted in demand being around 4 GW lower across 
this quarter than we would expect without lockdown. This has 
a relatively small effect on prices when demand less renewable 
output is moderate. Moving from a net demand of 22 to 18 GW 
lowers prices by around £6/MWh. But when demand is low 
and renewable output is high (e.g. a windy Sunday evening, or 
a sunny weekend at midday), it has a much more pronounced 
effect. Moving from a net demand of 12 to 8 GW instead lowers 
prices by more than £40/MWh.
Using this trend, we model that if demand had not been 
suppressed by COVID restrictions, power stations would have 
earned 35% more for each MWh they generated. Prices would 
have still fallen from last year because of movements in fossil 
fuel and carbon prices. That said, if demand had not been 
reduced due to COVID, we estimate prices would have only 
fallen from £42 to £32/MWh, rather than down to £23/MWh. 
The direct impact of reduced demand (reduced sales) meant 
power stations sold £320m less electricity during the last 
quarter than the same quarter last year. However, the effect 
of lower demand pushing down prices had a larger impact, 
cutting the market value of this electricity by a further £450m.
This reduced value of generation amounts to around £50 per 
household over the last three months. But who actually sees 
those savings? Very few people have electricity tariffs that 
change every half hour to track the wholesale market, so 
households are not benefitting from lower prices yet. The kind 
of hedging offered by having a fixed tariff means consumers 
are paying more at the moment than they could be, but on 
the flipside they pay less per unit of electricity when prices 
are higher, such as during harsh winters. Electricity suppliers 
typically also buy their power in advance at fixed rates, so they 
will not be seeing much of the saving either. If prices continue 
to stay low, new contracts will be signed at lower rates, and 
the savings will begin to pass through.

3. Solar eclipses coal
May saw Britain’s solar panels produce more than ever, while every coal power station spent 
the whole month sitting idle. Solar panels supplied an average of 2.7 GW of power during May, 
surpassing 10% of the month’s electricity demand. Growing output from renewables, along 
with suppressed demand saw no coal power stations operate for 67 days straight.
Britain experienced unusually good weather, with sunshine levels during spring rivalling some 
of the best summers on record. Much of this was down to favourable conditions, a large patch 
of high pressure blocked incoming storms. Britain’s lockdown also had an influence, as greatly 
reduced traffic on our roads meant less air pollution, and fewer flights meant less contrails in 
the sky, both of which absorb or scatter some of the incoming sunlight.
Britain also saw its first ever full month with zero electricity generated from coal. All of the 
country’s coal power stations had turned off as of midnight on 10th April, and stayed offline 
until 10pm on 16th June, some 67 days later. One plant then ran for three hours (producing just 
25 MW) as part of routine maintenance. No electricity was produced from coal during 92% of 
the hours this quarter.
This collapse in coal output means Britain’s power system gets to celebrate its first ‘zero-coal 
anniversary’: at the start of July it had clocked up 8,760 hours without any coal – equivalent to 
a full year. It has taken four years to reach this point, since the first zero-coal hour back in May 
2016, but it will most certainly take less time before we reach the second anniversary.

4. How to count carbon emissions
Reduced demand, boosted renewables, and the near-total abandonment of coal pushed last 
quarter’s carbon emissions from electricity generation below 10 million tonnes. Emissions 
are at their lowest in modern times, having fallen by three-quarters compared to the same 
period ten years ago. The average carbon emissions fell to a new low of 153 grams per kWh of 
electricity consumed over the quarter. 
The carbon intensity also plummeted to a new low of just just 18 g/kWh in the middle of the 
Spring Bank Holiday. Clear skies with a strong breeze meant wind and solar power dominated 
the generation mix. Together, nuclear and renewables produced 90% of Britain’s electricity, 
leaving just 2.8 GW to come from fossil fuels. 
National Grid and other grid-monitoring websites reported the carbon intensity as being  
46 g/kWh at that time. That was still a record low, but very different from the Electric Insights 
numbers. So why the discrepancy? 
These sites report the carbon intensity of electricity generation, as opposed to consumption. 
Not all the electricity we consume is generated in Britain, and not all the electricity generated 
in Britain is consumed here. Should the emissions from power stations in the Netherlands 
‘count’ towards our carbon footprint, if they are generating power consumed in our homes? 
Earth’s atmosphere would say yes, as unlike air pollutants which affect our cities, CO2 has the 
same effect on global warming regardless of where it is produced.
On that Bank Holiday afternoon, Britain was importing 2 GW of electricity from France 
and Belgium, which are mostly powered by low-carbon nuclear. We were exporting three-
quarters of this (1.5 GW) to the Netherlands and Ireland. While they do have sizeable shares of 
renewables, they also rely on coal power. 
Britain’s exports prevented more fossil fuels from being burnt, whereas the imports did not 
as they came predominantly from clean sources. So, the average unit of electricity we were 
consuming at that point in time was cleaner than the proportion of it that was generated 
within our borders. We estimate that 1,190 tonnes of CO2 were produced here, 165 were 
emitted in producing our imports, and 730 avoided through our exports.

In the long-term it does not particularly matter which of these measures gets used, as the mix 
of imports and exports gets averaged out. Over the whole quarter, carbon emissions would 
be 153g/kWh with our measure, or 151 g/kWh with production-based accounting. But, it does 
matter on the hourly timescale, consumption based accounting swings more widely.
This speaks to the wider question of decarbonising the whole economy. Should we use 
production or consumption based accounting? With production (by far the most common 
measure), the UK is doing very well, and overall emissions are down 32% so far this century. 
With consumption-based accounting it’s a very different story, as emissions have only fallen 
by 13%.1 This is because we import more from abroad, everything from manufactured goods to 
food to data when streaming music and films online.
Either option could allow us to claim we are zero carbon through accounting conventions. 
On the one hand (production-based accounting), Britain could be producing 100% clean 
power, but relying on dirty imports to meet its entire demand – that should not be classed as 
zero carbon as it’s pushing the problem elsewhere. On the other hand (consumption-based 
accounting), it would be possible to get to zero carbon emissions from electricity consumed 
even with unabated gas power stations running. If we got to 96% low carbon (1300 MW of 
gas running), we would be down at 25 g/kWh. Then if we imported fully from France and sent 
electricity to the Netherlands and Ireland, we’d get down to 0 g/kWh. 
Regardless of how you measure carbon intensity, it is important to recognise that Britain’s 
electricity is cleaner than ever. The hard task ahead is to make these times the norm rather 
than the exception, by continuing to expand renewable generation, preparing the grid for 
their integration, and introducing negative emissions technologies such as BECCS (bioenergy 
with carbon capture and storage).

Both figures are between 2000 and 2016 (the latest year for which data are available). Territorial-based emissions fell from 742 to 502 MtCO2, while consumption-
based emissions fell 898 to 783 MtCO2. Source: The CCC.

5. The cost of staying in control
The cost of keeping Britain’s power system stable has 
soared, and now adds 20% onto the cost of generating 
electricity. The actions that National Grid takes to manage 
the power system have typically amounted to 5% of 
generation costs over the last decade, but this share has 
quadrupled over the last two years. In the first half of 2020, 
the cost of these actions averaged £100 million per month.
Supplying electricity to our homes and workplaces needs 
more than just power stations generating electricity. Supply 
and demand must be kept perfectly in balance, and flows of 
electricity around the country must be actively managed to 
keep all the interconnected components stable and prevent 
blackouts. National Grid’s costs for taking these actions  
have been on the rise, as we reported over the previous  
two summers; but recently they have skyrocketed. 
At the start of the decade, balancing added about £1/MWh to 
the cost of electricity, but last quarter it surpassed £5/MWh 
for the first time (see below). Balancing prices have risen 
in step with the share of variable renewables. The dashed 
line below shows that every extra percent of electricity 
supplied by wind and solar adds 10 pence per MWh to the 
balancing price. Last quarter really bucks this trend though, 
and balancing prices have risen 35% above the level expected 
from this trend. The UK Energy Research Centre predicted 
that wind and solar would add up to £5/MWh to the cost of 
electricity due to their intermittency, and Britain has now 
reached this point, albeit a few years earlier than expected.
This is partly because keeping the power system stable is 
requiring more interventions than ever before. With low 
demand and high renewable generation, National Grid is 
having to order more wind farms to reduce their output, at a 
cost of around £20 million per month. They even had to take 
out a £50+ million contract to reduce the output from the 
Sizewell B nuclear reactor at times of system stress.

A second reason for the price rise is that National Grid’s costs of balancing 
are passed on to generators and consumers, who pay per MWh. As demand 
has fallen by a sixth since the beginning of the coronavirus pandemic, the 
increased costs are being shared out among a smaller base. Ofgem has 
stepped in to cap the balancing service charges at a maximum of £10/MWh 
until late October. Their COVID support scheme will defer up to £100 million of 
charges until the following year.
For a quarter of a century, the electricity demand in Great Britain ranged 
from 19 to 58 GW.1 Historically, demand minus the intermittent output of wind 
and solar farms never fell below 14 GW. However, in each month from April to 
June this year, this ‘net demand’ fell below 7 GW. Just as a McLaren sports car 
is happier going at 70 than 20 mph, the national grid is now being forced to 
operate well outside its comfort zone. 
This highlights the importance of the work that National Grid must do towards 
their ambition to be ready for a zero-carbon system by 2025. The fact we are 
hitting these limits now, rather than in a few years’ time is a direct result of 
COVID. Running the system right at its limits is having a short-term financial 
impact, and is teaching us lessons for the long-term about how to run a leaner 
and highly-renewable power system.

6. Capacity and production statistics
Four-tenths of Britain’s electricity came from renewables 
last quarter, while coal supplied just 1/500th. Coal’s share has 
fallen from over a fifth just five years ago. The prospect of zero 
coal over a whole quarter now seems quite real.
Electricity output from wind, solar and biomass were each up 
more than 10% on this quarter last year. Combined with lower 
demand, this pushed fossil fuels off the system. Gas output 
was down a third, and coal all but disappeared, supplying just 
0.1 TWh over the three months. 
To underline this role reversal, the average capacity factor of 
Britain’s renewables was 27% versus just 24% for fossil-fuelled 
power stations. This mirrors the wider trend of coal power 
station capacity factors falling worldwide. 
Falling demand and prices also reduced Britain’s trade deficit 
in electricity. We imported less power from our neighbours, and 
exported twice as much compared to this quarter last year.

7. Power system records
Britain’s solar farms and biomass power stations had a record-breaking 
quarter. The 30th of May saw solar power provide a third of the country’s 
electricity demand at its peak. Biomass also reached new highs, supplying 
a sixth of electricity demand the previous night. Meanwhile, demand fell to 
its lowest levels this century, falling below 17 GW on the 28th of June. Coal 
power stations had their first full month of zero output, and natural gas hit 
its highest ever share of demand, exceeding 70% of electricity generated on 
the 16th of June. All in all, 38 of the 200 records we track were broken over the 
past quarter.
The tables below look over the past decade (2009 to 2020) and report the 
record output and share of electricity generation, plus sustained averages 
over a day, a month and a calendar year.1 Cells highlighted in blue are records 
that were broken in the second quarter of 2020. Each number links to the 
date it occurred on the Electric Insights website, allowing these records to be
