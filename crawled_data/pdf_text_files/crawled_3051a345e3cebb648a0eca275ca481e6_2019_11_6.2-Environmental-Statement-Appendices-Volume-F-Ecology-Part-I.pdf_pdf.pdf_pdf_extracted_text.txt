Introduction
2.1
Introduction
2.1.1
AECOM was instructed by Abergelli Power Limited (APL) to carry out a Preliminary
Ecological Appraisal (PEA) of the Abergelli site, hereafter referred to as ‘the Project
Site’. The central grid reference for the Project Site is SN 6528 0143 and the
boundary of the Project Site is shown on Figure 1.
2.1.2
This PEA was commissioned to identify whether there are known or potential
ecological receptors (nature conservation designations, and protected and notable
habitats and species) that may constrain or influence the design and
implementation of the Project. The approach applied when undertaking this PEA
pays due regard to the Guidelines for Preliminary Ecological Appraisal published by
the Chartered Institute of Ecology and Environmental Management (Ref. 3). The
PEA addresses relevant wildlife legislation and planning policy as summarised in
Section 2 of this report.
2.1.3
In order to deliver the PEA, a desk study and an extended Phase 1 Habitat Survey
were undertaken by an appropriately experienced ecologist, to identify ecological
features within the Project Site and the wider potential zone of influence of the
Project. The potential zone of influence was defined with reference to the project
description provided by APL as shown as the habitats surveyed on Figure 1.
Additional details are provided in Section 3: Methodology.
2.2
Proposed Development
2.2.1
The Project Site is located near to the village of Felindre, Swansea, as shown in
Figure 1.1 of the ES, and the central grid reference for the Project Site is
SN65280143. The Project Site is approximately 30.66 ha. A full description of the
development is provided in Chapter 3: Project and Site Description) of the ES.
2.2.2
The development will require the removal of hedgerows, semi-natural broadleaved
woodland, rows of trees, scrub, running water, ponds, hardstanding, marshy
grassland, semi-improved grassland, improved grassland, and trees with potential
for roosting bats.
2.2.3
It is understood that construction is programmed to commence no sooner than
2020/2021.
2.3
Objectives
2.3.1
The objectives of the PEA were:
·
Identify designated nature conservation sites on or within proximity to the
Project Site;
·
Identify known records of protected or notable species within proximity to the
Project Site;
Abergelli ES 2018 – PRELIMINARY ECOLOGICAL APPRAISAL (NON-CONFIDENTIAL)

·
Identify and categorise the main habitats and features of ecological interest
present within the Project Site ;
·
Appraise the potential for protected or notable species of fauna and flora;
·
Provide advice on potential ecological constraints and opportunities on or within
proximity to the Project Site;
·
Identify the requirement for further habitat and species surveys;
·
Make recommendations for requirements to avoid and mitigate ecological
impacts as well as opportunities for biodiversity enhancements; and,
·
Provide a map showing the Phase 1 habitats on the Project Site and features of
ecological interest.
2.3.2
The purpose of this report is to support the submission of a Development Consent
Order (DCO) application. The report identifies the scope of further work (where
necessary) that would be required to support a DCO application. High level
recommendations are made on potential options for the avoidance, mitigation or
compensation of the potential impacts of the Project (where known) on the
identified ecological receptors, and of potential enhancements to the biodiversity
and ecosystem services. A full assessment of potential effects and mitigation will be
made during the Ecological Impact Assessment (EcIA).
2.4
Wildlife Legislation and Planning Policy
Wildlife Legislation
2.4.1
There are several different acts of legislation and regulations which refer to the
protection of wildlife. These are summarised in Appendix A. In particular, the
legislation relating to possible protected species on the Project Site is outlined. This
is a brief summary of the legislation and is not to be regarded as a definitive legal
opinion. When dealing with individual cases, the client is advised to consult the full
texts of the relevant legislation and obtain further legal advice.
2.4.2
The following wildlife legislation is potentially relevant to the Project:
·
The Wildlife and Countryside Act (WCA) 1981 (as amended);
·
The Countryside and Rights of Way (CRoW) Act 2000;
·
The Conservation of Habitats & Species Regulations 2010 (as amended);
·
Environment (Wales) Act 2016;
·
The Hedgerow Regulations 1997; and,
·
The Protection of Badgers Act 1992.
2.4.3
The above legislation has been considered when planning and undertaking this
PEA using the methods described in Section 3, when identifying potential
constraints to the Project, and when making recommendations for further survey,
design options and mitigation, as discussed in Section 5. Compliance with
legislation may require the attainment of relevant protected species licences prior to
the implementation of the Project.

National Planning Policy
Planning Policy Wales (8th Ed. January 2016)
2.4.4
Planning Policy Wales (PPW) sets out the land use planning policies of Welsh
Government. It provides the policy framework for the preparation of Local
Development Plans. Chapter 5, Conserving and Improving the Natural Heritage
and Coast, outlines Welsh Government’s objectives for the conservation and
improvement of natural heritage.
Technical Advice Note 5 (TAN5) Nature Conservation and Planning (2009)
2.4.5
The Planning Policy Wales (PPW) is supplemented by a series of Technical Advice
Notes. TAN 5 provides guidance on how the land use planning system should
contribute to protecting and enhancing biodiversity and geological conservation.  It
provides advice on areas including the key principles of positive planning for nature
conservation, nature conservation in Local Development Plans and development
management procedures. It also provides advice on development affecting
designated sites and habitats, in addition to protected or priority habitats and
species.
2.4.6
Key Principles include that the town and country planning system in Wales should
integrate nature conservation into all planning decisions; that the town and country
planning system should look for development to provide a net benefit for
biodiversity conservation with no significant loss of habitats or populations of
species, locally or nationally and that they should ensure that the UK’s international
and national obligations for site, species and habitat protection are fully met in all
planning decisions.
Local Planning Policy
2.4.7
Local Development Plans (LDPs) must be produced by every Local Planning
Authority in Wales. Any development proposal will be tested against the policies
within the LDP. The LDPs follow the planning guidance provide in PPW, including
biodiversity and natural heritage policies. These include protecting designated sites
and other areas of importance for biodiversity conservation; safeguarding protected
species and priority species, including those listed in local biodiversity action plans
and retaining, creating and enhancing features of importance for biodiversity
conservation where appropriate.
2.4.8
Relevant local planning policies for City and County of Swansea (CCS) are detailed
in the adopted City and County of Swansea Unitary Development Plan.
2.4.9
CCS has also submitted the Swansea Local Development Plan 2010 – 2025 to the
Secretary of State for Examination in public. This is an emerging development plan,
and is not part of the statutory development plan. However, its policies are a
material consideration. :

2.4.10 Appendix A provides a summary of relevant local planning policies. For the precise
wording of each specific policy please refer back to the source document. This
planning policy has been considered when assessing potential ecological
constraints and opportunities identified by the desk study and field surveys; and,
when assessing requirements for further survey, design options and ecological
mitigation, as described in Section 6.
2.5
Quality Assurance
2.5.1
This survey and subsequent report was undertaken in line with AECOM’s
Integrated Management System (IMS). Our IMS places great emphasis on
professionalism, technical excellence, quality, environmental and Health and Safety
management. All staff members are committed to establishing and maintaining our
certification to the international standards BS EN ISO 9001:2008 and 14001:2004
and BS OHSAS 18001:2007. In addition our IMS requires careful selection and
monitoring of the performance of all sub consultants and contractors.
2.5.2
All AECOM Ecologists who worked on this project are members of (at the
appropriate level) the Chartered Institute of Ecology and Environmental
Management (CIEEM) and follow their code of professional conduct (Ref. 4) when
undertaking ecological work.
3.
Methodology
3.1
Desk Study
3.1.1
The objectives of the desk study are to review the existing information available in
the public domain concerning species and habitats to identify the following:
·
Internationally, nationally and locally designated sites, up to 2 km from the
Project Site using the Multi Agency Geographic Information for the Countryside
(MAGIC) website (www.magic.gov.uk);
·
Protected and Priority species records and records of locally designated sites
up to 2 km from the Project Site, using the South East Wales Biodiversity
Records Centre (SEWBReC);
·
Special Areas of Conservation (SACs) and Sites of Special Scientific Interest
(SSSIs) designated for bats within a 10 km radius of the Site in accordance
with Bat Conservation Trust (Collins, 2016) recommendations;
·
Section 7 list of Species and Habitats of Principal Importance for Conservation
of Biological Diversity in Wales;
·
Ancient Semi-Natural Woodland (ASNW), Plantation on Ancient Woodland Site
(PAWS), Restored Ancient Woodland Site (RAWS) or Ancient Woodland Site
of Unknown category (AWSU) within or adjacent to the Project Site boundary
using LLE dataset (http://lle.gov.wales/home);
·
Tree Protection Orders (TPO’s) from Swansea Council; and,
·
Aerial photographs and Ordnance Survey (OS) maps were reviewed to identify
features of ecological interest surrounding the Project Site including ponds
within 500 m, nearby areas of ecological interest and features connecting these
habitats (hedgerows, watercourses, railway lines).

3.1.2
The reports of previous surveys undertaken by BSG Ecology and WSP/Parsons
Brinckerhoff (WSP/PB) were provided by the client and were reviewed (Ref. 5).
3.2
Extended Phase 1 Habitat Survey
3.2.1
A Phase 1 Habitat Survey (Ref. 6) of the Project Site was undertaken by two
suitably experienced ecologists of AECOM on the 18th and 19th May 2017.
3.2.2
The survey involved a site walkover and preliminary assessment of key habitats,
land use and ecological features. The main habitats present were recorded using
standard Phase 1 Habitat Survey methodology as described in the Handbook for
Phase 1 Habitat Survey: A technique for Environmental Audit (JNCC, 2010). The
plant species defining the habitat types on the Project Site were recorded.
Evidence of any invasive plant species subject to legal controls was recorded. The
Project Site was assessed for its potential to support protected or notable species
in order to identify potential ecological constraints and to guide recommendations
for further surveys.
3.3
Assessment of Bat Potential
3.3.1
During the Phase 1 Habitat Survey, where access allowed, trees and buildings
throughout the Project Site were classified into categories dependent on the
presence of features suitable as bat roost habitat.
3.3.2
Due to the size of the Project Site and the number of trees present within the
Project Site boundary, it was not possible to make an assessment of every tree.
However a number of trees were assessed during the Phase 1 Habitat Survey and
the details of these are provided in Table 3-1 below. Trees within area of woodland
present within or close to the Project Site boundary were not individually assessed
but the woodlands were given an overall rating, based on species composition and
age, of their likelihood to support roosting bats and/or the need for further
assessment.
3.3.3
The assessment was conducted via an external appraisal from the ground using
binoculars where necessary. Table 3-1 provides descriptions of the categories for
buildings and trees.
3.3.4
Habitats on-site were classified into categories dependent on the presence of
features suitable for bats to commute and forage. Table 3-2 provides descriptions
for commuting and foraging habitats.

3.4
Limitations
3.4.1
Biological records can be received from a wide variety of sources and may or may
not be comprehensive and accurate. However, if assessed in conjunction with a
Phase 1 Habitat survey, they can contribute to a robust ecological assessment of a
site.
3.4.2
Due to the size of the Project Site, it was not possible to assess every tree or
building for its potential to support bats.
3.4.3
Some areas adjacent to but outside of the Project Site boundary were not
accessible at the time of survey and as such these habitats were surveyed from the
road at a distance.
3.4.4
Some areas within the Project Site boundary were not accessible due to the
presence of horses; these habitats were surveyed at a distance.
3.4.5
There is potential for trees and/or buildings with the potential to support roosting
bats to have gone unrecorded due to time and access restrictions. It is possible that
some species, including invasive non-native plant species may not have been
recorded due to access limitations.

Previous Surveys
The client provided AECOM with the reports of previous surveys
undertaken by BSG Ecology and WSP/PB within the Site (Ref. 5, and
Appendices 8.3 and 8.8 of the ES). It was noted that the current red
line boundary of the Site is now smaller than the red line boundary
used by BSG Ecology and WSP/PB. However, the current red line
boundary is within the same area as the previous red line boundary
provided to BSG Ecology and WSP/PB and therefore the surveys
undertaken would have captured the current Project Site boundary.
A summary of the previous protected and priority species surveys are
detailed below:

July to October and may have gone unrecorded. It
stated that there may still be suitable areas within
the Project Site in which devil’s bit scabious may
be found (Ref. 5).
Devil’s bit scabious typically grows in damp
meadows and marshes and along woodland rides
and riverbanks.
Areas of semi-improved neutral grassland and
marshy grassland are present within the Project
Site. Therefore there is the potential for devil’s bit
scabious to be present, however it is considered
that even if this plant is now present within the
Project Site it is unlikely to be in any great number
and therefore it is considered unlikely that marsh
fritillary butterfly will be present.

the trees within area of woodland are of a suitable
age and size to support bat roost potential
features.
Four buildings (outside of the Project Site

Ecological Constraints and Indicative Potential Impacts
5.1.1
The constraints and potential impacts listed here do not include consideration of
further surveys which have been recommended in Section 6. The results of further
surveys may change the likely potential impacts.
5.1.2
The indicative potential impacts of the Project on habitats and protected species
are outlined below; potential impacts will be assessed fully during the Ecological
Impact Assessment (EcIA).
5.1.3
The development proposals are for proposed 299 MW Open Cycle Gas Turbine
power station. The development will require the removal of vegetated habitats
including hedgerows, semi-natural broadleaved woodland, rows of trees, scrub,
hardstanding, marshy grassland, improved grassland, and trees.
5.2
Indicative Potential Impacts
5.2.1
Without mitigation, during construction and operation the following indicative
potential impacts are anticipated:
·
Habitat loss, severance and fragmentation;
·
Loss and/or disturbance of breeding and resting sites of protected species;
·
Disturbance, injury or killing of protected and priority species during site
clearance and construction works;
·
Disturbance, injury or killing of protected and priority species during operation
where protected species are retained within the Project Site;
·
Disturbance from noise and vibration (if piling is required);
·
Pollution to land and/or water as a result of run off of sediments, chemicals, fuel
or oil;
·
Degradation of habitats and designated site habitats due to increases in
nutrients from operational emissions;
·
Spread of invasive species; and,
·
External lighting disturbance.

Further Surveys and Recommendations
6.1
Further Surveys
6.1.1
Further surveys for protected species are recommended so that the baseline data
can be used to inform the EcIA. Surveys will be programmed and completed with
sufficient time ahead of DCO application submission and the results can be used to
inform the Project design. Certain species can only be surveyed for at certain times
of year and without consideration this has potential to cause project delays.
6.1.2
Recommendations for further surveys are based on the current information
available and will be subject to consultation with relevant consultees and local
authority officers. Further surveys are recommended for the following species:
a) Hedgerows
6.1.3
Hedgerows proposed to be removed as part of the development should be
assessed by a suitably qualified ecologist to determine if they are classified as an
Important hedgerow under the Hedgerow Regulations, 1997 (Ref. 1). The optimal
times for hedgerow surveys are April – early-June, whilst the woodland ground flora
is still present.
b) Tree Preservation Orders
6.1.4
No TPOs are to be removed as part of the Project. However the TPOs may be
impacted by the works. TPO trees that may be impacted by the Project should be
identified and the appropriate Root Protection Zones should be set up during
construction.
c) Invertebrates
6.1.5
As the habitats on the Project Site have not changed significantly since the
invertebrate survey conducted in 2014 it is recommended that the consultation is
undertaken with Natural Resources Wales (NRW) and the local planning authority
to discuss the requirement for additional invertebrate surveys.
6.1.6
Should an update to the 2014 survey data be required by the NRW and the local
planning 
authority 
it 
should 
be 
undertaken 
by 
a 
suitably 
qualified
ecologist/entomologist to determine if the habitats proposed to be removed as part
of the development support any protected and/or priority invertebrate species,
including the marsh fritillary butterfly.
d) Great Crested Newts
6.1.7
It is recommended that surveys for great crested newts are undertaken on suitable
ponds within the Project Site boundary, and within 500 m of the Project Site
boundary to determine if they are present in the area.
Abergelli ES 2018 – PRELIMINARY ECOLOGICAL APPRAISAL (NON-CONFIDENTIAL)
Prepared for: Abergelli Power Limited
AECOM
37
e) Reptiles
6.1.8
It is recommended that
presence/absence
surveys for reptiles should be
undertaken in areas of suitable habitat using artificial refugia.
6.1.9
Grass snake and common lizard have previously been identified on Project Site
(see Table 4-1).
f)
Breeding Birds
6.1.10 It is recommended that breeding bird surveys should be undertaken within suitable
areas of habitat within the Site to assess presence, population and activity of birds.
Particular focus will be paid to protected and/or priority species breeding in areas of
suitable habitat and will include ground nesting birds, in particular lapwing, in areas
of marshy and semi-improved grassland.
g) Bats
6.1.11 The Bat Survey Guidelines (Ref. 2) requires surveys to consider potential roosts
(trees, buildings and structures) within the Zone of Influence (ZoI) of a project. For
the Generating Equipment Site in consideration of construction noise and vibration,
and operational lighting to COMAH regulations the ZoI has been set to a 50m
radius from the Project Site boundary, and for the rest of the Site set to potential
roosts within and adjacent to the Project Site boundary.
Tree Assessments
6.1.12 If broadleaved semi-natural woodland, rows of trees and /or individual trees within
the ZoI and Project Site are to be removed or illuminated by external lighting a
preliminary ground level roost assessment should be undertaken on all trees within
the area which will be affected.
Building and Structure Assessments
6.1.13 Buildings and/or structures within the vicinity of the Project Site should be assessed
for their potential to support summer roosting and winter hibernating bats.
Bat Roost Survey
Trees
6.1.14 Any trees to be removed or disturbed (disturbance can include lighting, crown
lifting, limb removal, noise and vibration) which have been assessed as having low
potential to support roosting bats will not be subject to further surveys, but
precautionary measures may be appropriate during felling or pruning activities.
6.1.15 Any trees to be removed or disturbed which have been assessed as having
moderate or high potential to support roosting bats may require a further Potential

6.1.16 To establish roost presence or likely absence up to three manual surveys
(dusk/dawn) are to be completed following the Bat Survey Guidelines (Collins,
2016). The climbed inspection can count towards one of the three manual surveys.
Buildings and Structures
6.1.17 Any buildings or structures assessed as having potential to support roosting bats
may require an internal inspection, winter hibernations survey, and/or will require
presence/absence surveys to be undertaken if they are to be disturbed as part of
the Project (disturbance can include lighting, renovation works, noise and
vibration).
6.1.18 To establish roost presence or likely absence up to three manual surveys
(dusk/dawn) are to be completed following the Bat Survey Guidelines (Ref. 2).
6.1.19 At least three surveys are needed to support a European Protected Species
License application if a roost is to be destroyed or disturbed.
Activity Survey
6.1.20 To ascertain the presence and/or level of bat activity on the Project Site, activity
surveys (including walked transects and automated/static activity surveys) are
recommended to be completed following the Bat Survey Guidelines (Ref. 2).
Transect Surveys
6.1.21 This comprises two site visits a month, for each month between April and October
inclusive for walked transects. Transects will incorporate all areas of suitable
habitat. Particular focus will be on commuting bats using the hedgerows and tree
lines. The transect route will depend on suitable and safe access. Due to the size of
the Project Site it is anticipated that the Project Site will be covered by two walked
transect routes.
Automated/Static Activity Surveys
6.1.22 This comprises three remote detector locations per transect with data to be
collected on five consecutive nights per month, for each month between April and
October inclusive.  The devices will be placed out and retrieved after each session.
Recordings are then analysed in the office.
h) Hazel Dormouse
6.1.23 Suitable habitat for supporting dormice was recorded within woodland, hedgerows
and dense scrub. No records of dormice were returned from the local records
centre. Surveys for dormice were undertaken by BSG Ecology in 2014 (Appendix
8.8 of the ES) and no evidence of dormice was found.

Prepared for: Abergelli Power Limited
AECOM
39
6.1.24 The habitats on-site with the potential to support dormice are not considered to
have changed since 2014, Therefore AECOM consider that no further surveys for
dormice are necessary. However, a consultation with NRW and the local planning
authority will be required to determine if this approach is appropriate. There may be
a requirement to undertake further surveys for dormice in areas of suitable habitat
on-site.
6.1.25 Should a dormouse survey need to be completed to ascertain presence or likely
absence at the Project Site, the survey will follow the guidelines set out in the
Dormouse Conservation Handbook Second Edition (Ref. 10).
6.1.26 Nest tubes will be positioned within areas of scrub woodland and along hedgerows
suitable to support dormouse. The tubes will be checked monthly using a surveyor
possessing a NRW dormouse handling licence for the presence of dormice and
also for signs of recently constructed dormouse nests.
6.1.27 Based on survey methodologies provided in Ref. 10, it is recommended that
surveys commence in May and are undertaken on a monthly basis until September.
As shown in Table 6-1 below, each survey month is given an Index of Probability
based on the likelihood of dormouse being present and active in each month. A
minimum score of 20 is required to assume absence from the Site.

6.1.28 If dormice are confirmed present within the woodland on site then an application for
a European Protected Species License (EPSL) will need to be made from NRW to
allow works to be undertaken that would otherwise be in breach of legislation. The
EPSL will contain a Method Statement describing how the works will proceed (likely
to include timing of works, working methods and hand searching by a licensed
ecologist) and mitigation measures. If an EPSL is required then the survey must
include a survey in May to inform a population size class assessment, due to the
timing of this PEA this would need to be undertaken in May 2018.
i)
Badger
6.1.29 Badger setts have previously been identified on Project Site (see Table 4-1).
Badger setts were identified and the sensitive information is contained within a
confidential version of this report. A badger survey should be undertaken in areas of
suitable habitat above the water table within and up to 50 m from the Project Site
boundary for badger setts and signs.
6.1.30 Badger tunnels can extend up to 30 m from the entrance holes and are located
between 0.2 m and several metres below the surface, depending on the soil and
topography. Any works, in particular heavy machinery and ground breaking works,
that takes place within 30 m of an active badger sett has the potential to cause a
collapse of a sett and disturb, harm or kill a badger. Light work, such as hand
digging has the potential to cause disturbance within 10 m of a sett.
6.1.31 Works likely to damage or destroy a badger sett will require a license to close the
sett prior to works commencing.
6.1.32 Further surveys and a pre-works check for newly created badger setts may be
required.
j)
Otter and Water Vole
6.1.33 An otter and water vole survey should be undertaken along watercourses and
ditches at least 100 m from the Project Site boundary (where access allows) to
ascertain presence and distribution.
k) Invasive Non-Native Plant Species
6.1.34 Invasive non-native plant species were identified during the Phase 1 Habitat
Survey. A survey for invasive non-native species should be undertaken in areas
that could not be accessed during the Phase 1 Habitat Survey.

6.2
Recommendations for Further Work
a) Habitat Regulations Assessment – Screening
6.2.1
A search should be undertaken for any Natura 2000 sites situated within the 10 km
study area. A Habitat Regulations Assessment (HRA) screening assessment should
be undertaken to ascertain if the development proposals would have a Likely
Significant Effects (LSE) on any Natura 2000 sites alone or in-combination with
other projects, and therefore identifying whether an Appropriate Assessment (AA) is
required. Consultation with NRW is recommended at early stages to discuss the
proposals and suitable mitigation measures should these be required.
6.2.2
A HRA screening assessment was undertaken in 2015 by Parsons Brinckerhoff and
concluded no LSE. It is recommended that the report is reviewed and, if deemed
appropriate, consultation undertaken with NRW to ascertain whether the report can
be used to support the DCO application. However, a new in-combination
assessment will be required as there is a likelihood that new projects have been
planned or built since the 2015 report was written.
6.3
Recommendations for Consultation
6.3.1
Development plans are likely to require the removal of SINC habitats and TPO
trees, and may impact upon a number of protected and/or priority species, and
designated sites. The following is a list of bodies that should be consulted:
·
CCS Ecologist;
·
CCS Officer;
·
Natural Resources Wales; and,
·
Local wildlife groups.

6.4
Recommendations for Mitigation and Enhancement
6.4.1
A detailed list of recommendations has not been completed. Further
recommendations will be made as a result of the further surveys and as part of the
EcIA.
6.4.2
The mitigation hierarchy should be considered and implemented when designing a
new development.
a) Mitigation Hierarchy
1. Enhance positive impacts and opportunities;
2. Avoidance – Alternative site or technology, or timing to eliminate impact;
3. Minimise – Actions during design construction and operation to minimise or
eliminate impacts; and
4. Compensation – Used as last resort to offset impacts.
b) Habitat Loss, Severance and Fragmentation
6.4.3
Avoid removal of habitats where possible. The following are of particular
importance as they are listed as priority habitats under the Section 7 of the
Environment (Wales) Act 2016. The Act places a duty on public authorities to ‘seek
to maintain and enhance biodiversity’ of types of habitat included in on the Section
7 list, and encourage others to take such steps:
·
Woodland;
·
Semi-improved grassland;
·
Marshy grassland;
·
Standing water; and,
·
Hedgerows.
c) Loss and/or Disturbance of Breeding and Resting sites of Protected Species
6.4.4
Further surveys will confirm the presence of any breeding or resting sites.
Disturbance, destruction, or obstruction of breeding or resting sites for European
Protected Species (EPS) and certain nationally protected species, such as badger,
will require a licence from NRW. Compensatory habitat/sites, mitigation,
supervision of works and post construction monitoring would likely be required.
d) Disturbance, Injury and Killing during Construction
·
To reduce the risk of killing and injury to individual reptiles when vegetation is
cleared it is recommended that a programme of translocation and mitigation
based on a high population is undertaken prior to any site clearance.
·
Removal or maintenance of habitats that have the potential to support breeding
birds should take place outside of the breeding bird season (removal between
the 1st September and end of February). There is a potential for a clash
between the removal of vegetation to avoid impacts on birds and impacts on
reptiles. This will need to be managed and planned once timings are known.
Abergelli ES 2018 – PRELIMINARY ECOLOGICAL APPRAISAL (NON-CONFIDENTIAL)

AECOM
43
The provision of bird boxes, such as swift boxes, typical garden bird boxes,
sparrow terraces and barn owl boxes will provide supplementary nesting sites.
·
Any new lighting design should avoid lighting of habitats with the potential to
support wildlife (such as vegetated habitats or buildings) and/or adjacent
habitats. Suggestions for mitigating external lighting and achieving the lighting
recommendations above are outlined in the best practice guidance by the Bat
Conservation Trust (Ref. 11 and Ref. 12) and are applicable to several other
nocturnal species.
·
A vehicle traffic assessment should be completed to understand the likely
impacts on habitats and species.
·
A noise and vibration assessment as a result of piling should be completed to
understand the likely impacts on species.
·
Excavations, if left unfilled overnight, should be covered to avoid animals
becoming trapped or excavations fitted with a scaffolding board ramp to allow
any trapped animals to exit.
e) Pollution to Land and/or Water
·
Appropriate measures should be in place to: control pollution and disturbance
during construction and adhere to applicable published guidelines. These
measures should be detailed and implemented via a Construction Management
Plan (CMP) and appropriate Toolbox Talks.
f)
Disturbance during Operation including Litter and Predation by Pets
·
Areas set aside for wildlife (for example reptile receptor areas, woodland,
diverse grassland planting) should be protected for the lifetime of the Project
Site and should have management plans in place which are followed to protect
and maintain the areas. For example, without active management through
successional change grassland will turn to dense scrub which would make an
area less suitable for reptiles.
·
A Habitat Management Plan should be created for operation of the Project Site.
g) Spread of Invasive Species
·
Invasive plants should be treated and removed from the Project Site as part of
the Project. The removal of the plants from the Project Site will be of benefit to
the biodiversity within the Project Site and the local area.
·
Prevent the tracking of vehicles over or otherwise disturbing areas of invasive
plant growth or areas of soil contaminated with the remains (roots, seeds, and
rhizomes).
·
Have an appropriate management plan in place during construction and
operation to help prevent/limit any re-growth or re-introduction of invasive
species that could be spread by works or invasive grounds maintenance
activities, such as flailing and use of tractors or frequent trampling by people.

h) Biodiversity Enhancements
6.4.5
The National Planning Policy Framework (March, 2012) and the Environment
(Wales) Act 2016, requires that developments enhance biodiversity, as well as just
mitigating impacts.
6.4.6
A detailed list of recommendations has not been completed. Further
recommendations can be made as a result of the further surveys and at EcIA stage.
6.4.7
Suggested potential enhancement measures for the Project Site are provided
below.
·
Implement a sympathetic management regime for the vegetation within the
Project Site to increase the conservation value and biodiversity of the Project
Site;
·
Use locally native species within the planting and landscaping deign, and
species that are of a benefit to invertebrates; and,
·
Include the provision of bird nesting features within the landscaping design.

Appendix A Wildlife Legislation and Local Planning Policy
8.2
Legislation – Habitats
8.2.1
A variety of sites are designated in the UK, under Conventions, Directives and
Regulations for their nature conservation importance and interest. The general aim
of these designations is to conserve and protect ecological resources, as well as
raising awareness and understanding. Other non-statutory sites are afforded some
protection through local plans. The following outlines the most common statutory
and non-statutory designations:
Designation
Brief Description
Special Areas of
Conservation
(SAC)
SACs are sites selected to conserve the natural habitat types and
species of wild flora and fauna listed in the Annexes of the Habitats
Directive (further information regarding the Habitats Directive is set out
in more detail in Table 8.3 below).  They are the best areas to
represent the range and variety of habitats and species within the
European Union (EU).
Special Protection
Area (SPA)
SPAs are strictly protected sites for the most important habitats for rare
and migratory birds within the EU classified in accordance with Article
4 of the Birds Directive information regarding the Birds Directive is set
out in more detail in Table 8.3 below).
Ramsar Sites
Ramsar Sites are wetlands of international importance. Ramsar Sites
are protected, through the planning system, under the Wildlife and
Countryside Act 1981 (as amended), and the Countryside and Rights
of Way Act 2000 through their notification as SSSIs and through other
regulatory systems addressing water, soil and air quality.
National Nature
Reserve (NNR)
NNRs are nationally important areas of wildlife habitat and geological
formations in Britain.  NNRs are designated and protected under the
National Parks and Access to the Countryside Act 1949 and the
Wildlife and Countryside Act 1981 (as amended). They receive
additional protection under the Countryside and Rights of Way Act
2000.  They are managed for the benefit of nature conservation.
Site of Special
Scientific Interest
(SSSI)
A SSSI is a site of at least national importance for nature conservation
designated under the Wildlife and Countryside Act 1981 (as amended)
due to its special interest in terms of flora, fauna or geological or
physiographical features.  Protection afforded to SSSI’s was
strengthened by the Countryside and Rights of Way Act 2000.  It
should be noted that under the Countryside and Rights of Way Act
2000 owners of SSSIs must give Natural Resources Wales (NRW)
written notice before they begin any of the operations listed in the
notification as likely to damage the special interest features, or if they
allow others to carry out these activities.  None of the listed operations
can be carried out without NRW’s consent.
County Wildlife
Site (Local site)
A County Wildlife Site is a non-statutory site designated by a local
authority as being of local nature conservation value.
Ancient Woodland
Ancient Woodland is a term applied to woodlands which have existed
from at least Medieval times to the present without ever having been
Abergelli ES 2018 – PRELIMINARY ECOLOGICAL APPRAISAL (NON-CONFIDENTIAL)

Designation
Brief Description
Inventory
cleared for uses other than wood or timber production.  A convenient
date used to separate ancient and secondary woodland is about the
year 1600. In special circumstances semi-natural woods of post-1600
but pre-1900 origin are also included.
Wildlife Trust
Reserve
These non-statutory sites are managed by the Wildlife Trusts with the
purpose of conserving wildlife.
8.3
Legislation – Protected Species
8.3.1
In addition to habitats, a number of species have been afforded protection through
international/European and national law. Other species are considered to contribute
to our ‘quality of life’. Although these species do not benefit from legal protection,
they can be material considerations in the planning process. The table below
outlines the key forms of protection afforded to species. The Countryside and
Rights of Way Act, the Wildlife and Countryside Act 1981 (as amended), The
Protection of Badgers Act 1992 and the Conservation of Habitats and Species
Regulations 2017 are the main legislative framework for protection of wild animals
in the UK. Schedule 1 of the Wildlife and Countryside Act 1981 (as amended)
covers birds, Schedule 5 covers other animals and Schedule 8 covers plants.
8.3.2
Species including bats, otters and great crested newts are listed under Schedule 2
of the Conservation of Habitats and Species Regulations 2017. Badgers are
protected under their own Act: The Protection of Badgers Act 1992. Activities
affecting protected species must usually be conducted under licence obtained from
the appropriate body (in Wales, this is Natural Resources Wales).
8.3.1
Developers must be able to show that all reasonable measures have been taken to
ensure that protected species are not subject to disturbance.  The habitats which
regularly support the Conservation of Habitats and Species Regulations
2017Schedule 2 species, the Wildlife and Countryside Act 1981 (as amended)
Schedule 1 species and some Wildlife and Countryside Act 1981 (as amended)
Schedule 5 species are also protected from disturbance and destruction. Again, all
reasonable precautions should be taken to ensure that this does not happen. The
Countryside and Rights of Way Act 2000 has strengthened enforcement powers
and introduced a new offence of “reckless disturbance” that applies to both
protected sites and species. Error! Reference source not found. below provides

8.3.2
Legislation
Brief Description
The Habitats Directive
The Habitats Directive 1992 (Directive 92/43/EEC sets out the
legal framework requiring EU member states to protect habitat
sites supporting vulnerable and protected species, as listed
within the Directive. The need for an assessment of impacts on
Natura 2000 sites (the collective name for European designated
sites, including SPAs and SACs) is set out within Article 6 of the

Legislation
Brief Description
Directive. The Directive is transposed into UK law through the
Conservation of Habitats and Species Regulations 2017) (the
"Habitats Regulations") and the Wildlife & Countryside Act 1981
(as amended).
The Birds Directive
The Directive on the Conservation of Wild Birds (Directive
2009/147/EC (the codified version of Council Directive
79/409/EEC as amended)) provides a framework for the
protection, management and control of all species of naturally
occurring wild birds in the European territory of Member States,
including the UK. The provisions of the Birds Directive are
transposed into UK law by the Conservation of Habitats and
Species Regulations, 2017 and the Wildlife & Countryside Act
1981 (as amended).
Wildlife and Countryside
Act (1981) (as
amended)
The Wildlife and Countryside Act 1981 (as amended) is the
principal mechanism for the legislative protection of wildlife in
Great Britain. This legislation is the means by which the
Convention on the Conservation of European Wildlife and
Natural Habitats (Bern Convention) and (partially) the Birds
Directive and the Habitats Directive are implemented in the UK.
The Countryside and Rights of Way Act 2000 has strengthened
this legal protection (see below).
A small number of plant species are listed under Schedule 9 of
the Wildlife and Countryside Act 1981, as amended, which
includes species such as Japanese knotweed (Fallopia
japonica), Himalayan balsam (Impatiens glandulifera),
montbretia (Crocosmia x crocosmiiflora), giant hogweed
(Heracleum mantegazzianum) and some cotoneaster species
(Cotoneaster sp.).  It is illegal to plant or to cause these plants to
grow in the wild, and legal disposal methods for vegetation and
soil subject to disturbance or clearance from a site must be
used.
Convention on
Biological Diversity and
the Countryside and
Rights of Way Act 2000
The Countryside and Rights of Way Act 2000 provides a
statutory framework for biodiversity conservation. The Act
places a duty on Government Departments and the National
Assembly for Wales to have regard for the conservation of
biodiversity and maintain lists of species and habitats for which
conservation steps should be taken or promoted, in accordance
with the Convention on Biological Diversity.
Schedule 9 of the Act amends SSSI provisions of the Wildlife
and Countryside Act 1981, including provisions to change SSSIs
and providing increased powers for their protection and
management. The provisions extend powers for entering into
management agreements; place a duty on public bodies to
further the conservation and enhancement of SSSIs; increases
penalties on conviction where the provisions are breached; and
introduce a new offence whereby third parties can be convicted

Legislation
Brief Description
for damaging SSSIs.
Schedule 12 of the Act amends the species provisions of the
Wildlife and Countryside Act 1981, strengthening the legal
protection for threatened species. The provisions make certain
offences 'arrestable' and create a new offence of reckless
disturbance.
The UK Biodiversity Action Plan (BAP) was published in 1994,
and was the UK Government’s response to the Convention on
Biological Diversity (CBD), which the UK signed up to in 1992. It
provides the framework for fulfilling the UK’s responsibilities
towards the Convention on Biological Diversity.  Conservation of
biodiversity (the variety of life on earth) is an essential element
of sustainable development.
Environment (Wales)
Act 2016
The Environment (Wales) Act puts in place the legislation
needed to plan and manage Wales’ natural resources in a more
proactive, sustainable and joined-up way.  Part 1 relates to the
sustainable management of natural resources.  This ensures
that the way in which the use of and the impacts on natural
resources do not result in long term decline.  The aim is to
sustainably manage natural resources in a way and rate that
meets the needs of present and current generations without
compromising the needs of future generations.
The Act also contains at section 7, a duty for the Welsh Ministers
prepare and publish a list of the living organisms and types of
habitat which in their opinion are of principal importance for the
purpose of maintaining and enhancing biodiversity in relation to
Wales. This section replaces the duty in section 42 of the NERC
Act 2006.
Protection of Badgers
Act 1992
The Protection of Badgers Act 1992 makes it an offence to
wilfully take, kill, injure or ill-treat a badger, possess a dead
badger or any part of a badger. Sett interference includes
damaging or destroying a sett, obstructing access to a sett, and
disturbing a badger whilst it is occupying a sett. The Act defines
a badger sett as ‘any structure or place, which displays signs
indicating the current use by a badger’ and Natural England
takes this definition to include seasonally used setts.
Work that may disturb badgers or their setts is illegal without a
development licence from the relevant statutory body (in this
case Natural Resources Wales).
The Hedgerow
Regulations 1997
The Hedgerow Regulations (1997) make provision for the
protection of important hedgerows in England and Wales. The
regulations affect hedgerows which are 20m or more in length,
or connected at both ends to another hedgerow of any length.
They relate to hedgerows which are on, or adjoining land used
for the following purposes: agriculture or forestry; the breeding or

Brief Description
keeping of horses, ponies or donkeys; common land; village
greens; and SSSIs (They do not include hedges that are
attached to, or marking the boundaries of a private house.
It is an offence to intentionally or recklessly remove or cause or
permit another person to remove a hedgerow or intentionally or
recklessly remove, or cause or permit another person to remove,
a hedgerow which is the subject of a hedgerow retention notice.

Local Planning Policy
8.4.1
The table below provides a summary of relevant local planning policies found in the
Swansea Unitary Development Plan. For the precise wording of each specific
policy please refer back to the source document.
Planning Policy
Purpose /Relevant Sections
SP1 Creating a
Quality Environment
Sustainable development will be pursued as an integral principle of
the planning and development process.
Development proposals designed to a high quality and standard,
which enhance townscape, landscape, sense of place, and
strengthen Swansea Waterfront identity, will be favoured.
SP2 - Creating a
Quality Environment
The countryside will be protected and conserved, with green
wedges shaping the urban form and safeguarding the distinctive
interplay of town and country. Village character will be protected.
SP3 - Creating a
Quality Environment
The natural, built, and cultural heritage of the County will be
protected and enhanced to safeguard from materially harmful
development.
Siting and Location -
EV2
The siting of new development should give preference to the use of
previously developed land over greenfield sites, and must have
regard to the physical character and topography of the site and its
surroundings by:
i. Avoiding locations that would have a significant adverse impact on
prominent buildings, landscapes, open spaces and the general
locality, including loss of visual amenity,
ii. Effectively integrating with the landscape, seascape or coastline
by utilising topography to integrate into the contours of the site and
avoiding conspicuous locations on prominent skylines and ridges,
iii. Retaining important views into and out of the site,
iv. Taking into account and where possible retaining site features
including existing buildings, topography, landscape, archaeological
and water features, trees and hedgerows, and, where appropriate:
v. Undertaking, at the earliest opportunity, an assessment of
species and habitats on site and, where planning permission is
granted, implementing any necessary mitigation measures,
ix. Determining whether the proposal would be at risk from flooding,

AECOM
53
Planning Policy
Purpose /Relevant Sections
increase flood risk off-site, or create additional water run-off,
xiii. Having full regard to existing adjacent developments and the
possible impact of environmental pollution from those
developments, as well as the creation of any environmental
pollution to the detriment of neighbouring occupiers (including light,
air and noise).
Rural Development -
EV21
In the countryside non residential development will only be
permitted where it can be demonstrated that:
iii. It is an appropriate development associated with farm
diversification, sustainable tourism and recreation, or nature
conservation and does not adversely affect the viability of an
established farm unit.
Rural Development -
EV22
The countryside throughout the County will be conserved and
enhanced for the sake of its natural heritage, natural resources,
historic and cultural environment and agricultural and recreational
value through:
i. The control of development, and
ii. Practical management and improvement measures.
Sites of International
Importance - EV25
Development, alone or in combination with other plans or projects,
which is likely to adversely affect the integrity of a European
protected site (SAC, Marine SAC, SPA and Ramsar Sites) and is
not directly connected with or necessary to the management of the
site, will not be permitted unless:
i. There are imperative reasons of over-riding public interest,
including those of a social or economic nature, which are sufficient
to override the reasons for designation, and
ii. There is no alternative solution.
Where such development is permitted, planning conditions and/or
obligations will be used to secure all compensatory measures
necessary to ensure that the overall coherence of the European
Site is protected.
SSSIs and National
Nature Reserves -
EV27
Development that significantly adversely affects the special
interests of sites designated as SSSIs and NNRs will not be
permitted unless the need for the development is of such
significance that it outweighs the national importance of the
designation.
Where development is permitted, planning conditions and/or
obligations will be used to protect and enhance those interests and
where necessary provide effective mitigation and compensatory
measures.
Sites of Local
Importance - EV28
Within locally designated areas the natural heritage will be
preserved and enhanced wherever possible.
Development that would significantly adversely affect the special
interest of Local Nature Reserves will not be permitted unless the
need for the development is of such significance that it outweighs
the importance of the designation.

54
Planning Policy
Purpose /Relevant Sections
Development that would significantly adversely affect SINCs or
RIGs, or which would not provide for appropriate compensatory or
mitigation measures will not be permitted, unless it can be
demonstrated to meet appropriate social or economic needs where
the benefits in such terms would outweigh the harm to the feature
concerned.
Where development is permitted which would damage the nature
conservation value of the site, such damage will be kept to a
minimum, and appropriate mitigation or compensatory measures
sought.
Trees, Woodland
and Hedgerow
Protection - EV30
Protection and improved management of woodlands, trees and
hedgerows which are important for their visual amenity, historic
environment, natural heritage, and/or recreation value will be
encouraged, with priority being given to:
i. Protecting the remaining areas of ancient semi natural woodland
and planted ancient woodland sites,
ii. Promoting new planting with species appropriate to the location,
where there is no conflict with other land uses or nature
conservation interests, and
iii. Ensuring that where management involves commercial felling
and replanting, protection of amenity interests is achieved.
Environmental
Enhancement -
EV32
Environmental improvement schemes will be implemented at a
number of locations shown on the Proposals Map. These are
intended to:
i. Improve visual appearance, natural heritage value and recreation
potential,
ii. Improve the setting of industrial, commercial and residential
developments and transport corridors, and
iii. Maintain, extend and improve the quality of the urban
greenspace network in line with the aims of the ‘Greening the City’
strategy
Protection of
Controlled Waters -
EV34
Development proposals that may impact upon the water
environment will only be permitted where it can be demonstrated
that they would not pose a significant risk to the quality and or
quantity of controlled waters.
Initiatives that lead to improvements in the quality of surface water
will be approved subject to satisfactory ecological and visual
safeguards.
Protection of
Controlled Waters -
EV35
Development that would have an adverse impact on the water
environment due to:
i. Additional surface water run off leading to a significant risk of
flooding on site or an increase in flood risk elsewhere, and/or
ii. A reduction in the quality of surface water run-off,
will only be permitted where it can be demonstrated that appropriate
alleviating measures can be implemented.
Sustainable drainage systems (SUDS) will be encouraged wherever

55
Planning Policy
Purpose /Relevant Sections
they would be effective and practicable, so as to ensure that
development does not increase run off, and potentially damage
important landscape features and protected species and habitats.
Where SUDS are not provided then any conventional drainage
system utilised must improve the status quo.
Air, Noise and Light
Pollution EV40
Development proposals will not be permitted that would cause or
result in significant harm to health, local amenity, natural heritage,
the historic environment or landscape character because of
significant levels of air, noise or light pollution.

implications of development proposals within areas
susceptible to flooding and preventing development that
unacceptably increases risk, and,
vi. Maintaining ecological resilience.
ER 
2 
Strategic 
Green
Infrastructure Network
Development will be required to maintain or enhance the
extent, quality and connectivity of the County’s multi-
functional 
green 
infrastructure 
network, 
and 
where
appropriate:
i. Create new interconnected areas of green infrastructure
between the proposed site and the existing strategic
network;

and/or,
iii. In instances where loss of green infrastructure is
unavoidable, provide mitigation and compensation for the
lost assets.
ER 6 Designated Sites of
Importance 
for 
Nature
Conservation
Development will not be permitted that would result in a
likely significant adverse effect to sites of international or
national nature conservation importance.
Development that would affect locally designated sites of
nature 
conservation importance 
should maintain 
or
enhance the nature conservation interest of the site. Where
this cannot be achieved development will only be permitted
Abergelli ES 2018 – PRELIMINARY ECOLOGICAL APPRAISAL (NON-CONFIDENTIAL)
Prepared for: Abergelli Power Limited          
AECOM
56
where it can be demonstrated that:
i. The need for the development outweighs the need to
protect the site for nature conservation purposes;
ii. There is no satisfactory alternative location for the
development that avoids nature conservation impacts; and,
iii. Any unacceptable harm is kept to a minimum by effective
avoidance measures and mitigation, or where this is not
feasible compensatory measures must be put in place to
ensure that there is no overall reduction in the nature
conservation value of the area.
ER 8 Habitats and Species
Development proposals that would have a significant
adverse effect on the continued viability of habitats and
species, including those identified as priorities in the UK or
Swansea Local Biodiversity Action Plan, will only be
permitted where:
i. The need for development outweighs the nature
conservation importance of the site;
ii. The developer demonstrates that there is no satisfactory
alternative location for the development which avoids
nature conservation impacts;
iii. Effective mitigation measures are provided by the
developer; And,
iv. Any unavoidable harm is minimised by effective
mitigation to ensure that there is no reduction in the overall
nature conservation value of the area. Where this is not
feasible, compensation measures designed to conserve,
enhance, manage and, where appropriate, restore natural
habitats and species must be provided.
ER 9 Ecological Networks and
Features of Importance for
Biodiversity
Development proposals will be expected to maintain,
protect and enhance ecological networks and features of
importance for biodiversity. Particular importance will be
given to maintaining and enhancing the connectivity of
ecological networks which
enable the dispersal and
functioning of protected and priority species.
Development proposals that could result in a significant
adverse effect on the connectivity of ecological networks
and features of importance for biodiversity will only be
permitted where:
i. The need for the development outweighs the nature
conservation value of the site;
ii. It can be demonstrated that there is no satisfactory
alternative location for the

Summary
1.1
Abergelli Power Limited (APL) is promoting a new Power Generation Plant with its associated Gas
and Electricity Connections (the ‘Project’) on agricultural land within Abergelli Farm, north of
Swansea in the City and County of Swansea (approximately at National Grid Reference 265284,
201431).
1.2
As part of the preliminary ecological appraisal1 for the Survey Site, a request was made to the
South East Wales Biodiversity Records Centre (SEWBReC) and Swansea Council for information
on designated sites and protected or otherwise notable species on and around the Project Site
boundary at the time of the survey (hereafter referred to as the ‘Survey Site’). The information
collected during the preliminary ecological appraisal and the desk study was used to identify those
areas of the Survey Site that required a more detailed botanical survey (National Vegetation
Classification (NVC)). The map of Sites of Importance for Nature Conservation (SINCs) provided
by Swansea Council revealed that three SINCs, which contain habitats of potentially high botanical
value, lie within the Survey Site boundary. APL commissioned BSG Ecology to undertake an NVC
survey of woodlands and grasslands within the 150 ha of pastoral farmland within the Survey Site
in June and July 2014, to inform and support an application for Development Consent for the
Project.
1.3
The land within the Survey Site that is designated as SINC along with some additional fields that
were identified as being potentially ‘habitats of principal importance for nature conservation’ as
referred to in Section 42 of the NERC Act 2006 (S42) were selected for inclusion in the NVC
survey.
1.4
The surveys were carried out on 11th June 2014 by Anna Gundrey MCIEEM (woodland), 23rd and
25th June 2014 by Vilas Anthwal MCIEEM (woodland) and 30th June and 1st July 2014 by
Thomas Flynn (grasslands and mires). The complex of habitats around the gas compressor station
was visited again on 12 September 2014 to confirm the boundaries of some habitats; and on 14
November 2014 Niall Lusby rechecked the woodland canopy composition in survey area WL1 (see
Figure 2). The surveyors are all suitably qualified botanists and experienced NVC surveyors.
1.5
The surveyors found that the land selected for survey included:

Four woodland communities / sub-communities –
o
W1 Salix cinerea – Galium palustre woodland;
o
W6e Alnus glutinosa – Urtica dioica woodland, Betula pubescens sub-community;
o
W7 Alnus glutinosa – Fraxinus excelsior – Lysimachia nemorum woodland; and
o
W10 Quercus robur – Pteridium aquilinum – Rubus fruticosus woodland.

Five mire communities / sub-communities –
o
M15b Scirpus cespitosus – Erica tetralix wet heath, typical sub-community;
o
M23a Juncus effusus/acutiflorus - Galium palustre rush-pasture, Juncus acutiflorus
sub-community;
o
M23b Juncus effusus/acutiflorus - Galium palustre rush-pasture, Juncus effusus sub-
community;
o
M25a Molinia caerulea – Potentilla erecta mire, Erica tetralix sub-community; and
o
M25c Molinia caerulea – Potentilla erecta mire, Angelica sylvestris sub-community.

Two neutral grassland NVC communities / sub-communities –
o
MG6a Lolium perenne – Cynosurus cristatus grassland, typical sub-community; and
o
MG10a Holcus lanatus – Juncus effusus rush pasture, typical sub-community.

Introduction
2.1
Abergelli Power Limited commissioned BSG Ecology to undertake a National Vegetation
Classification (NVC) survey during 2014 to inform and support an application for Development
Consent for the Project described below.
Site Description
2.2
The Survey Site consists of approximately 150 ha of pastoral farmland, primarily grazed by horses.
The extent of the Survey Site is shown on Figure 1 and is centred at National Grid Reference
265284, 201431. The nearest settlement is Felindre, which is approximately 2 km to the north of
the Survey Site, with Swansea approximately 5 km to the south.
2.3
The Survey Site is largely agriculturally improved pasture with several areas of marshy grassland,
particularly in the north, south and north-western extents of the Survey Site. The fields are
bounded by fences, running along the line of defunct hedgerows, and often accompanied by
ditches. There is a block of broadleaved woodland on the eastern boundary of the Survey Site and
areas around the marshy grassland to the west of the Survey Site, and around Felindre Gas
Compressor Station and the two National Grid 400 kV electrical substations that lie at the south-
west end of the Survey Site.  The habitats in the surrounding landscape are similar to those within
the Survey Site boundary – a mixture of improved and marshy grassland interspersed with
occasional patches of woodland.
Description of Project
2.4
APL is promoting a new Power Generation Plant with associated Gas and Electricity Connections
within Abergelli Farm.  The Power Generation Plant would operate as a Simple Cycle Gas Turbine
(SCGT) peaking plant and would be designed to provide an electrical capacity of up to 299
Megawatts (MW).  It would be fuelled by natural gas, supplied by a new underground gas pipeline
connecting the Power Generation Plant to the existing National Grid Gas (NGG) National
Transmission System (NTS).  It would also connect to the National Grid Electrical Transmission
System (NETS) via underground cable or overhead lines.
2.5
BSG Ecology has been appointed as the ecological consultant to undertake ecology surveys,
including a desk study and Extended Phase 1 Habitat Survey as well as a range of Phase 2
surveys, including a NVC survey. These baseline surveys will be included in an appendix to an
ecology chapter of an Environmental Statement, which is intended for submission, as an integral
part of the application for Development Consent.
Aims of Study
2.6
The aims of this study are as follows:

Identify habitats on the Survey Site that are potentially sensitive or important, either because
of their ecological designation or the plant community that is present; and

In order to fully describe such habitats, undertake a National Vegetation Classification (NVC)
survey to classify those plant communities present in the identified areas.

Methods
Desk Study
3.1
As part of the Preliminary Ecological Appraisal (PEA) for the Survey Site2, a request was made to
the South East Wales Biodiversity Records Centre (SEWBReC) and Swansea Council for
information on designated sites and protected or otherwise notable species on and around the
Survey Site.
3.2
Of relevance to this report was the data provided by Swansea Council on locally-designated SINCs
and the botanical data provided by SEWBReC from within a 2km radius of the Survey Site
boundary.
3.3
The information collected during the PEA was used to identify those areas of the Survey Site that
required a detailed botanical survey.
3.4
These areas were selected for more detailed botanical survey on the basis that either they were
identified as NERC Act Section 42 habitats of principal importance for biodiversity (see Appendix
2), and / or they lie within a SINC boundary for which habitats are a qualifying feature, and/or they
are identified on the Ancient Woodland Inventory for Wales.
Field Survey
3.5
Each parcel of land included in the survey was initially walked by the surveyor to map the broad
community types with the aid of aerial photographs. Quadrats (measuring 2 m x 2 m for grassland
and 50 m x 50 m for woodland canopy (with multiple 4 m x 4 m quadrats for field layer and ground
flora as dictated by the complexity of the woodland stands) were then marked out in blocks of
vegetation that were considered representative of each community type. In the case of narrow
linear habitats (two over-mature hedge banks and a narrow strip of woodland) it was very difficult to
identify quadrats so whole lengths were surveyed and species’ cover values were recorded
accordingly.
3.6
The number of quadrats employed in each type or area of vegetation was related to the level of
floristic variability present. For uniform areas of vegetation, one or several quadrats were
employed. For vegetation exhibiting more variability, larger numbers of quadrats (up to six in this
survey) were employed. The number of quadrats utilized for each vegetation type reflected the
surveyors’ judgement of the number required to sufficiently capture the floristic variation present. In
addition, the identification of plant communities is a two stage process with broad communities
identified in the field, and more definitive identifications of community and sub-community occurring
later, after data analysis. Therefore the numbers of quadrats associated with the final plant
community categories is variable. All plant species present within quadrats were recorded, along
with estimates of their cover values. Cover values were recorded using the Domin scale of Rodwell
et al. (1991) (see Appendix 3).  The lists of species generated were evaluated against the keys and
community accounts in the relevant British Plant Community Volume3 to establish the closest fit to
a National Vegetation Classification (NVC) community.
Survey Limitations
3.7
Access to parts of sites G2 and G3, as shown on Figure 1, was limited by impenetrable vegetation.
This limited the number of quadrats that could be employed in these areas. It is possible that the
data obtained in these areas may not be representative, particularly with respect to identifying the
presence or absence of rare or notable species. One or more quadrats were placed in the more
open parts of areas G2 and G3, but quadrat data was not collected from the dense scrub. The
dense scrub was assigned to an NVC category by the surveyor in the field, based on the
surveyor’s judgement and experience. Because the surveyor was an experienced botanist with

considerable experience of NVC surveys, this approach to the survey of areas G2 and G3 is not
considered to have affected the aims and value of the survey. The general character of the
vegetation and the typical/abundant species in these areas were determined with a high level of
confidence and any limitations are not considered to be significant.
3.8
Because of the very narrow and limited extent of the cover of vegetation at WL9, WL11, and a part
of WL13, the survey was conducted using the whole compartment as the quadrat. In places there
is a limited canopy but the dominant species were clear and communities have been assigned with
a reasonably high level of confidence. The assigned communities are consistent with adjacent
patches of woodland.

4.1
SEWBReC did not provide any records of notable botanical species on the Survey Site.
4.2
The map of SINCs provided by Swansea Council revealed that three SINCs lie within the Survey
Site boundary.  These are Rhyd-Y-Pandy Valley Grasslands SINC, Waun Garn Wen SINC and
Llety Morfil SINC. Brief descriptions of the habitats present in each SINC are provided below and
summarised from citations provided by Swansea Council:

Rhyd-Y-Pandy Valley and Grasslands: Wet woodland and woodland with assemblage of
ancient woodland indicator species, scrub, purple moor grass Molinia caerulea and rush
pasture, lowland meadow, neutral grassland, scrub, reed bed and water course habitats;

Waun Garn Wen: Purple moor grass and rush pasture, wet woodland, scrub and watercourse
habitats; and

Llety Morfil: Wet and ancient semi-natural woodland, purple moor grass and rush pasture,
and scrub habitats.

Vegetation Community Descriptions
MG6a Lolium perenne – Cynosurus cristatus grassland, typical Sub-Community
4.7
This is the major permanent pasture type on moist free draining neutral soils in lowland Britain.  It
is generally species-poor and grass-dominated.  Typical species include perennial rye-grass
Lolium perenne, crested dog’s-tail Cynosurus cristatus, red fescue Festuca rubra and common
bent Agrostis capillaris.  Broad-leaved plants are generally sparse and consist of common and
widespread species, such as common mouse-ear Cerastium fontanum, ribwort plantain Plantago
lanceolata, white clover Trifolium repens and creeping buttercup Ranunculus repens.
4.8
A large proportion of the Survey Site is MG6a grassland which, because of its ubiquity, was not
included in the NVC survey area.  However, some fields that meet this classification are included
within the survey area because they lie within a SINC boundary.  These are in G4 and G5.  The
MG6a grassland within G4 is a typical community with perennial rye-grass, crested dog’s-tail and
Yorkshire fog Holcus lanatus being the main grasses; and broad-leaved species including white
clover, daisy Bellis perennis and ribwort plantain.
4.9
The MG6a grassland at G5 includes more moisture-tolerant species such as marsh thistle Cirsium
palustre, marsh bedstraw Galium palustre and sharp-flowered rush Juncus acutiflorus, as well as
the more typical perennial rye-grass and white clover.  Of particular note was whorled caraway
Carum verticillatum, a species with very local distribution (confined to the extreme west of Britain),
which is more usually found in M23/M25 mire habitats (see below).
MG10a Holcus lanatus – Juncus effusus rush pasture, typical sub-community
4.10
This is a neutral grassland community with prominent tussocks of soft rush Juncus effusus in and
amongst species-poor shorter grassland.  Broad-leaved species are generally few in number, but
creeping and meadow buttercup Ranunculus acris can be abundant along with common species
such as white clover, common sorrel Rumex acetosa, and cuckoo flower Cardamine pratensis.
4.11
This community is found in G4, G5 and G6. The MG10a grassland at G5 is in a close association
with MG6a (above).  One field has a central wetter area of MG10a grassland within a larger area of
MG6a, whilst another is a continuum between the two communities.  It has frequent perennial rye-
grass and cock’s-foot Dactylis glomerata indicative of MG6a, but also abundant soft rush and
Yorkshire fog. A number of plants of whorled caraway (see paragraph 3.9 above) were also noted.
4.12
The MG10a grassland at G4 also forms a continuum from adjacent slightly drier MG6a habitats.  It
has abundant soft rush and Yorkshire fog, with smaller proportions of creeping buttercup, fleabane
Pulicaria dysenterica and selfheal Prunella vulgaris.
4.13
The grassland in G6 is heavily disturbed having apparently been mown, harrowed and sprayed to
remove the rushes.  However, the constant species of MG10a such as soft rush, Yorkshire fog,
creeping bent Agrostis stolonifera and creeping buttercup are still in evidence.
M15b Scirpus cespitosus – Erica tetralix wet heath, typical sub-community
4.14
This is a community of moist acid peats and peaty soils in the western parts of Britain.  It is
generally characterized by a mixture of varying quantities of purple moor-grass, deer grass
Trichophorum cespitosum (Scirpus cespitosus), cross-leaved heath Erica tetralix and heather
Calluna vulgaris.
4.15
A large block of the M15b typical sub-community is present on G1.  Purple moor grass and cross-
leaved heath are both abundant here, with frequent deer grass and heather.  Other species include
common hair grass
Eriophorum angustifolium, small amounts of hare’s-tail cotton grass
Eriophorum vaginatum, heath milkwort Polygala serpyllifolia and marsh lousewort Pedicularis
palustris.
Abergelli Power Project – NVC Survey Report

M23 Juncus effusus/acutiflorus - Galium palustre rush-pasture and two sub-communities
(M23a Juncus acutiflorus sub-community; and M23b Juncus effusus sub-community)
4.16
This community is defined by the presence of an abundance of soft rush and/or sharp-flowered
rush amongst mesophytic herbs widely occurring in moister agricultural grasslands.  It is not a
species-rich community, but a diverse range of species can occur amongst the dominant rushes.
4.17
In the habitats present on site, there is mostly a similar proportion of both rushes present, but
where soft rush is predominant, and purple moor-grass and whorled caraway are absent, the
Juncus effusus sub-community M23b has been assigned. This sub-community represents a
transition from the drier MG10 rush pasture community described above.  Commonly occurring
species in this sub-community include Yorkshire-fog, velvet bent Agrostis canina, tufted hair grass
Deschampsia cespitosa, creeping buttercup, marsh bedstraw and marsh thistle. Where sharp-
flowered rush is dominant or abundant, or purple moor-grass is abundant, the Juncus acutiflorus
sub-community M23a has been assigned.
4.18
The M23 community is present on G1 – G5. On G1 there is an area of M23a at the southern tip of
the surveyed area.  It includes typical M23 species such as velvet bent, soft and sharp flowered
rushes, marsh bedstraw and Yorkshire fog, as well species more typical of the M15b wet heath to
which it lies adjacent –
purple moor grass, tormentil Potentilla erecta and heath rush Juncus
squarrosus. This is a fairly grassy, probably relatively dry example of this community. The local
abundance of purple moor-grass suggests affinity with the M23a sub-community, and this
vegetation has therefore been mapped as M23a.
4.19
On G2 the M23b sub-community is present within (and in mosaic with) extensive areas of scrub.
Much of this area was inaccessible because of the dense scrub cover.  The M23b areas surveyed
has abundant soft rush cover, with creeping bent, wild angelica Angelica sylvestris, greater bird’s-
foot trefoil Lotus pedunculatus and ragged robin Lychnis flos-cuculi.  Species more typical of
scrubby margins were also present in some quantity, including bramble, rosebay willowherb
Chamerion angustifolium, greater willowherb Epilobium hirsutum and hemp agrimony Eupatorium
cannabinum.
4.20
G3 is similar to G2, consisting of a wetter area surrounded by, and in mosaic with, an extensive
area of scrub.  The M23b community here is overwhelmingly dominated by soft rush, with
occasional wild angelica and bulrush Typha latifolia.
4.21
The M23 community on G4 lies along the gallops and is present in association with MG6a, MG10a,
and M25 communities.  Soft and sharp-flowered rush are both present in some quantity, along with
marsh bedstraw, greater bird’s-foot trefoil, creeping buttercup, white clover and lesser spearwort
Ranunculus flammula. Because of the abundance of sharp-flowered rush, the M23 community has
been identified as M23a.
4.22
The two fields on the northern and eastern edges of G5 are classified as M23a and M23b.  The
field to the north has an abundance of soft rush with occasional sharp-flowered rush and so is
classified as M23b.   It also has abundant creeping bent and frequent marsh bedstraw and greater
bird’s-foot trefoil and small quantities of wild angelica, Yorkshire fog and tormentil.  Purple moor
grass is occasionally present.  The eastern field has an abundance of both soft and sharp-flowered
rush and Yorkshire fog and greater bird’s-foot trefoil are both frequent and there are smaller
quantities of velvet bent, sweet vernal grass Anthoxanthum odoratum, marsh bedstraw and
creeping buttercup. While the field could probably be assigned to the wider M23 community, it is
worth noting that this area was mown prior to the survey. However, the unmown parts were
relatively species-rich and a cautious assessment of the M23 community as M23a has been made.
M25a Molinea caerulea – Potentilla erecta mire, Erica tetralix sub-community
4.23
This community is characterised by the overwhelming dominance of purple moor grass, which
distinguishes it from the M23 community described above.  Other species are limited in number
and abundance.  Soft rush and sharp-flowered rush can be frequent, but tormentil is the only
broad-leaved species that occurs regularly.
4.24
A large block of the Erica tetralix M25a sub-community is present on G1 and a smaller patch of this
community is present on G4.  On G1 purple moor grass is dominant, with small amounts of
tormentil, cross-leaved heath, soft and sharp-flowered rush, bilberry Vaccinium myrtillus, devil’s-bit
scabious Succisa pratensis and deer grass.
Abergelli Power Project – NVC Survey Report
10
17/11/2014
4.25
The patch of M25a on G4 is overwhelmingly dominated by purple moor-grass, with no other
species recorded.
M25c Molinea caerulea – Potentilla erecta mire, Angelica sylvestris sub-community
4.26
The patch of M25 on G5 lies adjacent to a stream, and has a lower dominance of purple moor-
grass, although it is still the most abundant species, and forms distinct tussocks.  Other species
present include soft rush, marsh bedstraw, greater bird’s-foot trefoil and wild angelica. The
abundance of wild angelica suggests affinity with the M25c Angelica sylvestris sub-community, and
this vegetation has therefore been classified as this.
W1 Salix cinerea – Galium palustre woodland
4.27
This community has a canopy dominated by grey willow Salix cinerea, with scattered silver birch
and alder occasionally present.  The field layer is variable but often consists of mosaics of more
open areas over undulations in wetter and drier ground.  Common species are marsh bedstraw,
water mint Mentha aquatica and soft rush.
4.28
This community is found in mosaic with M23b (see above) on survey areas G2 and G3.
The
dominant woody species is grey willow, mixed with hazel Corylus avellana and bramble.  Other
species present include soft rush, hemp agrimony and foxglove Digitalis purpurea.
W6e Alnus glutinosa – Urtica dioica woodland, Betula pubescens sub-community
4.29
This classification brings together a variety of canopies dominated by alder, willows Salix spp., and
silver birch.  The field layer is generally species-poor, with nettle Urtica dioica being the only
constant. The Betula pubescens sub-community has a greater dominance of downy birch, with an
understorey of bramble and honeysuckle Lonicera periclymenum and scattered broad-buckler fern
Dryopteris dilatata and patchily abundant nettle.
4.30
This sub-community is present at WL4, WL5 and WL7.  Here the sparse canopy consist largely of
downy birch and grey willow, with rowan Sorbus aucuparia, sycamore Acer pseudoplatanus, and
pedunculate oak also present in small numbers. Bramble is frequent in the understorey.
The
ground flora is dominated by the invasive species Himalayan balsam, which fills a niche usually
occupied by nettle. Nettle also remains frequent, and other species occasionally present include
cleavers Galium aparine, yellow pimpernel Lysimachia nemorum, creeping soft grass Holcus mollis
and ivy Hedera helix.
W7 Alnus glutinosa – Fraxinus excelsior – Lysimachia nemorum woodland
4.31
This community tends to have an open and irregular canopy of trees with alder being the only
woody constant.  The most frequent understorey species are hazel, hawthorn and grey willow; and
the ground flora includes creeping buttercup, rough meadow grass Poa trivialis, Yorkshire fog and
yellow pimpernel.
4.32
The W7 community is found on survey areas WL16 (where it forms a mosaic with rush pasture and
W10 woodland) and WL17. On these areas, pedunculate oak and grey willow form the canopy,
with lower-growing alder, holly Ilex aquifolium and grey willow making up the understorey.
Bramble scrub is abundant, and the ground flora is sparse. The ground flora includes ivy, soft rush
and marsh bedstraw.
W10 Quercus robur – Pteridium aquilinum – Rubus fruticosus Woodland
4.33
This is essentially oak woodland, with pedunculate oak being the commonest tree.  Birch (usually
silver birch, but also downy birch) is also frequently present.  Holly, rowan and sometimes beech
Fagus sylvatica occur, and alder may be present on wetter areas.
The understorey generally
includes frequent bramble and honeysuckle.  The ground flora can include bluebell Hyacinthoides
non-scripta, creeping soft grass Holcus mollis and bracken, and ferns such as male fern Dryopteris
filix-mas and broad-buckler fern.

The W10 community is found on survey areas WL1, WL2, WL3, WL6, WL8, WL9, WL10, WL11,
WL12, WL13, WL14, WL15 and WL16. In WL9, 11, and 13 the canopy is very narrow, in places
only one tree deep. More generally in the W10 areas, pedunculate oak is the dominant canopy
tree, with downy birch also frequent.  The understorey includes rowan, grey willow and holly, and

also abundant bramble.  The ground flora includes frequent ivy, with scattered broad-buckler fern,
lady fern Athyrium filix-femina and hard fern Blechnum spicant.
Creeping bent, common bent,
bluebell Hyacinthoides non-scripta, creeping buttercup and soft rush are amongst other species
occasionally present.
4.35
In survey area WL1, the W10 woodland has a relatively sparse and uniform open canopy. Part of
WL1 follows a high voltage overhead power line, and presumably tall vegetation is regularly
cleared from this area. The canopy here is particularly open and the understorey has a high level of
rowan. The field layer in WL1 is dominated by grasses (such as Yorkshire fog and rough meadow-
grass Poa trivialis), with some woodland species (such as bluebell, and foxglove), and (in places)
indicators of damp ground (wavy bitter-cress Cardamine flexuosa and creeping buttercup). This
field layer shows some similarity with MG10 rush pasture, except for the absence of rushes
(Juncus sp.); and with MG9 grassland, except for the absence of tufted hair-grass Deschampsia
cespitosa. The poor fit with plant communities described in the NVC may result from the on-going
management in this area. Here, the vegetation is considered to be sparse W10 woodland with a
grass-dominated field layer.
Presence of NERC Act Section 42 habitats
4.36
Table 3 summarises the results of the survey by survey area, with reference to the presence or
otherwise of NERC Act Section 42 habitats. This has been determined by reference to the
document “UK Biodiversity Action Plan Priority Habitat Descriptions”4 which was used as a
reference to draw up the Section 42 list.

Appendix 2 - Legislation
Natural Environment and Rural Communities (NERC) Act 2006
Section 40 of the Natural Environment and Rural Community Act (NERC) 2006 sets out the duty which
public authorities have to conserve biodiversity. Section 40 States that: “every public authority must, in
exercising its functions, have regard, so far as is consistent with the proper exercise of those functions, to
the purpose of conserving biodiversity”. The term Public Authority includes local authorities and local
planning authorities.
Paragraph 40(3) goes on to state that “conserving biodiversity includes, in relation to a living organism or
type of habitat, restoring or enhancing a population or habitat”.
Paragraph 42(1) states that “the Secretary of State must, as respects Wales, publish a list of the living
organisms and types of habitat which in the Secretary of State’s opinion are of principal importance for the
purpose of conserving biodiversity”. This replaces a similar reference to the list that was found in Section 74
of the Countryside and Rights of Way Act 2000 (the CRoW Act).

Summary
1.1
Abergelli Power Limited (APL) is promoting a new Power Generation Plant with its associated Gas
and Electricity Connections (the ‘Project’) on agricultural land within Abergelli Farm, north of
Swansea in the City and County of Swansea (approximately at National Grid Reference 265284,
201431).
1.2
As part of the Preliminary Ecological Appraisal (PEA) (BSG Ecology, 2014a) for the Project Site
(hereafter referred to as the ‘Survey Site’), a request was made to the South East Wales
Biodiversity Records Centre (SEWBReC) and Swansea Council for information on designated sites
and protected or otherwise notable species within 2 km of the ‘Survey Site’. The desk study
provided 40 records of four Lepidoptera1 ‘species of principal importance for nature conservation’
as referred to in Section 42 of the NERC Act 2006 (S42), within 2 km of the Survey Site, including
29 records of marsh fritillary butterfly Euphydryas aurinia. In addition, the desk study revealed that
three Sites of Importance for Nature Conservation (SINC) lie within the Survey Site boundary and
contain some potentially valuable habitats for invertebrates, with S42 invertebrate species recorded
at two of them. The PEA confirmed the presence of several potentially valuable habitats for
invertebrates, particularly woodland, marshy grassland, watercourses and ponds.
1.3
APL commissioned BSG Ecology to undertake invertebrate surveys of suitable habitats within the
Survey Site boundary. Surveys were carried out during June-September 2014 for moths, marsh
fritillary (adult and larval stages), terrestrial Coleoptera2, and aquatic macroinvertebrates3 (in ponds
and watercourses). The purpose of the surveys was to inform and support an application for
Development Consent for the Project.
1.4
A total of 384 species were recorded from the Survey Site. One species is Red Data Book
(insufficiently known4), two are nationally scarce and fourteen are S42 species. The results of each
survey is summarised as follows:

Terrestrial Coleoptera survey: 150 species were recorded during two surveys (in July and
September). These included 112 species of Coleoptera, 20 of which are saproxylic5 species
(see 3.6) although none are indicative of continuous saproxylic habitat, which may be taken as
an indicator of the quality of ancient woodland habitat;

Marsh fritillary survey: This species was not recorded during surveys for adult or larval stages,
although seven butterfly and two day-flying moth species were observed. These included one
S42 species;

Moth survey: 118 species of moth were recorded during two night-time surveys. Three locally
notable species (see 4.36) were recorded and 13 S42 species;

Pond survey: 48 species of aquatic macroinvertebrates were recorded during the survey of
Ponds 11 and 16, with the highest diversity of species recorded at Pond 11. No scarce or
threatened aquatic invertebrates were identified within the samples; and

Watercourse survey: all of the watercourses sampled were of very good quality. 59 species
were recorded with no scarce or threatened aquatic invertebrates identified within the samples.

Introduction
2.1
Abergelli Power Limited commissioned BSG Ecology to undertake an invertebrate survey in 2014
to inform and support an application for Development Consent for the Project described below.
Site Description
2.2
The Survey Site consists of approximately 150 ha of pastoral farmland primarily grazed by horses.
The extent of the Survey Site is shown in Figure 1 (Figures are located in Appendix 1) and is
centred at National Grid Reference 265284, 201431. The nearest settlement is Felindre, which is
located approximately 2 km to the north of the Survey Site, with Swansea approximately 5 km to
the south.
2.3
The Survey Site is largely agriculturally improved pasture with several areas of marshy grassland,
particularly in the north, south and north-western extents of the Survey Site. The fields are bounded
by fences, running along the line of defunct hedgerows, and often accompanied by ditches. There
is a block of broadleaved woodland on the eastern boundary of the Survey Site and other areas of
woodland around the marshy grassland to the west of the Survey Site, and around Felindre Gas
Compressor Station and the two National Grid 400 kV electrical substations that lie at the south-
west end of the Survey Site.  The habitats in the surrounding landscape are similar to those within
the Survey Site boundary comprising a mixture of improved and marshy grassland interspersed
with occasional patches of woodland.
Description of Project
2.4
APL is promoting a new Power Generation Plant with associated Gas and Electricity Connections
within Abergelli Farm.  The Power Generation Plant would operate as a Simple Cycle Gas Turbine
(SCGT) peaking plant and would be designed to provide an electrical capacity of up to 299
Megawatts (MW).  It would be fuelled by natural gas, supplied by a new underground gas pipeline
connecting the Power Generation Plant to the existing National Grid Gas (NGG) National
Transmission System (NTS).  It would also connect to the National Grid Electrical Transmission
System (NETS) via underground cable or overhead lines.
2.5
BSG Ecology has been appointed as the ecological consultant to undertake ecology surveys,
including a PEA as well as a range of Phase 2 surveys, including invertebrate surveys. These
baseline surveys will be included in an appendix to an ecology chapter of an Environmental
Statement, which is intended for submission, in support of the application for Development
Consent.
Aims of Study
2.6
The aims of the invertebrate survey were to indicate the quality of habitats present on the Survey
Site that are potentially important for invertebrates; and to identify whether any notable species
(e.g. rare, scarce or nationally threatened species of invertebrate, including S42 species), are
present and if present, to indicate their likely distribution across the Survey Site.

Methods
Desk Study
3.1
Existing ecological information for the Survey Site and its surrounding area was requested from the
South East Wales Biodiversity Records Centre (SEWBReC). Information on protected6 or notable
species (particularly those identified as S42 species and/or of local conservation importance or
LBAP7 species), including invertebrates, was requested covering the Survey Site and land up to 2
km from the Survey Site boundary. In addition, on-line resources including the Multi Agency
Geographic Information for the Countryside (MAGIC, www.magic.gov.uk) website8 and aerial
photography of the area were also reviewed.
Habitat Potential Assessment
3.2
During the Extended Phase 1 Habitat Survey of the Survey Site, carried out to inform the PEA,
which was undertaken in three phases (in February, April and July 2014), consideration was given
to the suitability of the Survey Site to support important invertebrate communities as well as
protected and/or notable invertebrate species. Full details of the PEA are provided in the PEA
report (BSG Ecology, 2014).
3.3
As part of this assessment, notes were made of the habitats present, which included observations
of features that might limit invertebrate interest as well as those which might be of particular value
for invertebrates. In particular, emphasis was placed on the following features (where present):

Mature open grown trees and veteran trees: especially those with large volumes of standing
dead wood;

Woodland edge and scrub: especially where there is a diverse vegetation structure and
species composition;

Species-rich grassland: especially that in association with scrub, with a high proportion of
plants providing nectar and pollen, and with a varied vegetation structure;

Early successional habitat: (e.g. cliff faces, quarries, eroded banks, periodically disturbed bare
or sparsely vegetated ground) especially on free-draining ground where there is a high
proportion of exposed bare earth; and

Wetland: including watercourses (e.g. streams, ditches, flushes and seepages), standing water
or waterbodies (e.g. ponds, lakes and swamp) and associated terrestrial habitat (e.g. wet heath
and marshy grassland).
3.4
A number of habitats were identified during the survey with the potential to support important
invertebrate communities (which are described further in the results section). Subsequent
invertebrate surveys were designed, to target key indicator groups of invertebrates within the
survey area that may be associated with woodland and marshy grassland in particular, namely
Coleoptera (terrestrial beetles) and Lepidoptera (marsh fritillary butterfly and moths). In addition,
two ponds (see Figure 1: Pond 11 and Pond 16) and three watercourses (see Figure 2) within the
Survey Site were identified as of potential value to aquatic invertebrates.
3.5
The results of these targeted surveys can be used to assess the main groups of invertebrate
present within the Survey Site, and to provide an indication of the relative species diversity within
the targeted groups.
Targeted Survey for Coleoptera
3.6
Features within the Survey Site that provided the most suitable habitat for this taxonomic order
were selected for targeted survey.  Surveys for beetles focussed on woodland and woodland edge

Protection of Badgers Act.

habitats within the Survey Site as a number of the woodland areas are listed on the Ancient
Woodland Inventory for Wales and one of the aims of the survey was to identify whether the beetle
fauna present within the Survey Site is indicative of high quality ancient woodland. The assessment
of whether woodland is ancient and/or is of high quality to invertebrates can be indicated by
surveying the saproxylic beetle fauna. The presence of a particular species or a high diversity of
such species can indicate the continuity of woodland on a site. This has been used in the
formulation of an Index of Ecological Continuity (Alexander, 2004) based on the scores assigned to
180 species of Coleoptera taken as ‘indicative of continuity of saproxylic habitats’ from a more
general list of 700 saproxylic species. Across the four main areas of woodland on the Survey Site
(Woodlands 1-4; see Figure 1) the following sampling methods were employed: pitfall traps, sweep
netting, beating, hand searching and sieving. These methods are described below. Whilst
Coleoptera formed the focus of the survey, incidental records of other invertebrate taxa were also
taken. Surveys were conducted on 10 July 2014 by Don Stenhouse FRES and on 18 September
2014 by Jim Fairclough MCIEEM, both suitably qualified entomologists.
Pitfall Traps
3.7
Two or three pitfall traps were set out in each of the four woodlands within the Survey Site (shown
on Figure 1).  The number of traps in each woodland was dependent on the availability of suitable
locations for trapping and the size and quality of the habitat. Pitfall trapping involved the use of
circular plant pot trays (24 cm diameter x 5 cm depth) that were sunk into a circular hole that had
been excavated using a spade.  The trays were installed such that the tray rims were flush with the
surrounding ground level.  Preserving fluid, comprising 1 part ethylene glycol (antifreeze) to 3 parts
water, was poured into the trays until they were half full.  A drop of detergent was added to the fluid
to break the surface tension and a layer of mesh (aperture size 2 cm x 1 cm) was balanced over
the tray to prevent capture of small mammals, amphibians and reptiles. The traps were operational
between 10 and 28 July 2014 as well as between 9 and 18 September 2014. Pitfall trapping is
considered to be an effective method for the sampling of ground dwelling beetles, particularly those
belonging to the family Carabidae (ground beetles).
Sweep Netting
3.8
Sweep netting involved walking at a steady pace and passing a heavy duty entomologist’s sweep
net back and forth through scrub and understorey vegetation in a figure of eight motion. This
method is particularly suitable for capturing phytophagous (foliage-feeding) families such as
Curculionidae (weevils), Chrysomelidae (leaf or flea beetles), Nitidulidae (pollen beetles) and
Cantharidae (soldier beetles).
Beating
3.9
Beating is an appropriate technique for extracting beetles from overhanging branches. This method
involves placing a beating tray beneath a branch before delivering several sharp blows to the
branch and sending any dislodged invertebrates into the beating tray for inspection. This method
may uncover a diverse array of beetle families that are similar to those found during the sweeping,
and may additionally produce Cerambycids (longhorn beetles) or Elaterids (click beetles), many of
which are associated with dead wood habitats.
Hand-searching and Sieving
3.10
Hand searching under logs and bark of dead trees, as well as grass tussocks and pleurocarpous
(spreading and branched) mosses is a useful additional technique of extracting invertebrates by
hand. In addition, samples of rotten wood, leaf/grass litter or moss were sieved into a white tray to
extract additional samples. This technique is particularly appropriate to aid detection of small, often
obscure beetles such as Staphylinidae (rove beetles), Anobiidae (wood-boring beetles) and
Cryptophagidae (silken fungus beetles).
Weather Conditions
3.11
For the first survey the weather had been warm and settled in the preceding weeks with some rain
in the days immediately preceding the survey. On the first survey visit, conducted on 10 July 2014,
the weather was dry, sunny and warm (maximum temperature 22°C), with a light wind.
Abergelli Power Project – Invertebrate Survey Report

20/11/2014
3.12
For the second survey, conditions in the week preceding the survey were dry and warm. On the
second survey visit, conducted on 18 September, the weather was overcast but dry with a light
wind and a temperature of 19°C.
3.13
The weather during both periods of pitfall trapping was generally warm and dry.
Sample Sorting and Identification
3.14
Whilst some species could be identified in the field, the majority of specimens were stored in 70%
methanol solution for subsequent identification, using a stereoscopic microscope with the aid of
identification literature. Don Stenhouse carried out identification of all terrestrial invertebrate
samples collected from the Survey Site.
Targeted Survey for Marsh Fritillary
Survey for Adult Butterflies
3.15
On 7 and 17 June 2014, Matthew Hobbs MCIEEM, an experienced butterfly surveyor, visited the
Survey Site to conduct a walked butterfly transect survey following standard methods described
below, with a focus on recording marsh fritillary butterfly in its adult stage.
3.16
A transect route was selected to cover an area of marshy grassland in the north-west of the Survey
Site that forms part of the Waun Garn Wen SINC. Marsh fritillary butterfly has apparently not been
previously recorded within this SINC, as no desk study records were received and the species is
not mentioned in the SINC citation. However, some areas of the marshy grassland habitat
comprise the National Vegetation Classification (NVC) habitat type, M25 Molinia caerulea –
Potentilla erecta mire9. This habitat supports a number of devil’s bit scabious Succisa pratensis
plants within the sward. Marsh fritillary larvae will only feed on scabious plants (with devil’s bit
scabious the most important larval host plant) and this species is the only scabious species present
within the Survey Site. As such, this is the only area that has the potential to support a breeding
population of marsh fritillary within the Survey Site and is the only area that was surveyed. The
area that the transect route covered is shown on Figure 1. The methodology used for the survey
adapted the protocol used within the UK Butterfly Monitoring Scheme (UKBMS)10, as follows:

Timed counts were made between 10:00 and 16:30 hours, and only carried out in warm, bright
and dry weather, with no more than moderate winds;

A transect route was devised (Figure 1), which was split into sections, each section being of
similar length and covering discreet ‘field’ or habitat types;

Each section was walked at a slow, steady pace counting all butterflies seen within a fixed
distance, 2.5 m either side of the transect line and 5 m ahead;

Care was taken to maintain a steady pace and avoid waiting at favoured hotspots to improve
the count and bias the results;

Butterfly numbers and percentage of sunshine in each section were recorded using the
standard UKBMS proforma. Wind speed was estimated using the Beaufort scale (0 - no wind, 6
- very strong wind); and

During surveys, species of butterfly other than marsh fritillary and day-flying moths were also
recorded.
3.17
During the two surveys on 7 and 17 June, the wind speed was measured as 3 and 2 respectively
(light wind) and the average temperature was 16°C and 21°C respectively.
Survey for Larvae
3.18
A second stage of surveys for marsh fritillary, which involved looking for larval webs of this species,
was undertaken on 20 August 2014, by Greg Chamberlain MCIEEM, an experienced marsh
fritillary surveyor. The survey followed standard methods derived from the UK Butterfly Monitoring

Scheme (UKBMS)11. The survey involved walking 2-5 m strip width transects across the marshy
grassland within the Waun Garn Wen SINC which encompassed a similar area to the one used in
the surveys for adult marsh fritillary described above. The survey took into account any devil’s bit
scabious plants that had been recorded in the transect area during other surveys. Following the
adult surveys in June, access was no longer available to the northern part of the area surveyed for
adults and the larval surveys were restricted to the southern area, where devil’s bit scabious had
not been recorded. During the June survey no examples of this plant were recorded and no further
surveys were scheduled for marsh fritillary larvae.
Targeted Survey for Moths
3.19
Night-time moth surveys were undertaken twice, on 16 June and 14 August 2014. The first survey
was conducted by Owain Gabb MCIEEM and Matthew Hobbs MCIEEM, both ecologists competent
in moth survey and identification, with the second undertaken by Owain Gabb, with Caitlin McCann
assisting. A single 125W Robinson moth trap (using a mercury vapour bulb) and two 40W heath
traps (using actinic bulbs) were used during both surveys, with the aim of attracting the greatest
number and variety of moths. The traps were positioned on both occasions in habitat areas within
the Survey Site that were expected to give the greatest range of species (see Figure 1 for trap
locations).

Trap M1: the first heath trap was located in an area of dry heath and rush pasture in the west
of the Survey Site;

Trap M2: the Robinson trap was located on a sloping track close to horse-grazed pasture,
woodland, scrub, neutral grassland and ruderal vegetation; and

Trap M3: the second heath trap was located on a track bordered with scrub and neutral
grassland in horse-grazed pasture between two areas of woodland.
3.20
Weather conditions during the survey on 16 June were good with a temperature range of 13-18⁰C,
with no rain and little or no wind. On 13 August, conditions were again good with a temperature
range of 14-18⁰C with a light wind and no rain.
3.21
The lights were switched on approximately 20 minutes before dusk and remained lit until they were
switched off after dawn.  The Robinson trap was powered via mains electricity (and an extension
lead) from a house on site, and the two heath traps by external 12V leisure batteries (and timer
switches).
3.22
The Robinson trap was manned for the first few hours of darkness to capture moths drawn to the
light but not entering the trap, with the other traps visited periodically.  The traps were
systematically emptied, and all moths determined to species level the following morning.
3.23
A number of micro-moths were externally determined / verified by Barry Stewart, one of the three
authors of The Moths of Glamorgan (Gilmore et al., 2014), on the day following each survey.
Targeted Survey of Ponds
3.24
The survey focussed on two of the three ponds present within the Survey Site (Ponds 11 and 16)
(for numbering of ponds please see Figure 1 in the great-crested newt survey report (BSG Ecology,
2014b)). A third pond (Pond 17) was not surveyed as it was thought to be suboptimal for aquatic
invertebrates due to shading, lack of vegetation and very shallow water levels. The survey was
undertaken on 28 July 2014 by Dr Jessica Frame MCIEEM and Rachel Taylor ACIEEM, both
skilled freshwater ecologists.
3.25
Benthic macroinvertebrates were collected at the two ponds using standard 3-minute kick sample
methodology (Biggs et al., 1998) using a 1 mm mesh hand net. One minute of hand searching (of
rocks, logs, leaf packs and other submerged debris) was then carried out in search of invertebrates
(e.g. caddis fly larvae (Trichoptera), pond skaters (Gerrida) and whirligig beetles (Gyrinida) that
might otherwise have been missed during the net sampling.
3.26
Invertebrates were separated from detritus and bed material in the field and preserved immediately
in 70% Industrial Methylated Spirit (IMS) for subsequent laboratory analysis.

3.27
A number of water quality parameters, including pH, dissolved oxygen, conductivity and total
dissolved solids were also recorded at each pond.
3.28
The weather during the survey was warm (18°), dry, with intermittent sun and a light wind. The
location of each of the ponds surveyed is shown in Figure 1.
Targeted Survey of Watercourses
3.29
Surveys of watercourses were carried out on 19 September 2014 by Jim Fairclough and Rachel
Taylor, both skilled freshwater ecologists. The survey techniques used at each sampling point are
described in detail below.
Sample point selection
3.30
To be effective, biological sampling should ideally use watercourses with a range of habitats that
are most likely to yield a diverse invertebrate community sensitive enough to detect changes in
biological water quality. Accordingly, sampling locations included reaches of approximately 10
linear metres, typically centred on a shallow fast-moving section of the stream (riffle), across which
a sample was collected.
Sample collection
3.31
At each sample point, one minute of hand searching (of rocks, logs, leaf packs and other
submerged debris) was carried out in search of invertebrates (e.g. caddis larvae, pond skaters or
whirligigs) that might otherwise have been missed during the subsequent kick sampling.  Three
minutes of kick sampling was then carried out for each sample point.  Pond nets were used for
sampling and these conformed to Environment Agency standards (1 mm mesh and 0.5 m deep).
Care was taken to avoid deep accumulations of soft sediment because this makes sample sorting
extremely difficult.  Similarly, the netting of large volumes of plant material was avoided.
Sample sorting and identification
3.32
The sample was placed into a sorting tray and all invertebrates were placed in a collection jar for
identification in the laboratory. The tray was carefully checked to ensure that no species were
missed. Specimens were stored in 70% methanol solution.  Any necessary species identification
was carried out by a suitably experienced entomologist (Dr Jessica Frame) using a stereoscopic
microscope with the aid of identification literature.
Water Quality Assessment
3.33
Assessment of aquatic invertebrate composition and diversity is recognised as an effective way of
measuring the water quality and habitat quality of wetland habitat. A common method for the
assessment of water quality is the Biological Monitoring Working Party (BMWP) index.  This gives
a score to freshwater habitat based upon the number of families of invertebrates found in a sample.
3.34
The BMWP works on the basic principle that freshwater pollution levels affect invertebrate families
differently.  Thus, certain families that are most susceptible to pollution score maximum points.
These include many families belonging to the mayflies (Ephemeroptera), stoneflies (Plecoptera)
and caddis (Trichoptera).  Conversely, those families tolerant of polluted waters score the fewest
points, and include families such as the leeches (Hirudinea), worms (Oligochaeta), chironomid
midges (Diptera) and the freshwater hog-louse (Isopoda).  Accordingly, cleaner watercourses,
which have higher water quality, score the highest number of points, whilst polluted watercourses
score the lowest.  In the mid-1990s, Walley and Hawkes carried out a computer-based revision of
the BMWP Scoring System, using data from the 1990 River Quality Survey of England and Wales
(Walley and Hawkes, 1996, 1997).  This is thought to be a more objective approach to allocating
BMWP scores which would lead to a more accurate reflection of the impacts of pollution on
invertebrate fauna.  For the purposes of this report the revised scores have been calculated.
3.35
An alternative way of expressing the BMWP score is by measuring the Average Score per Taxon
(ASPT).  This is obtained by dividing the BMWP score by the number of scoring families.  This
score is sometimes preferred to the BMWP score, since it eliminates any discrepancies associated
with ‘recorder effort’.  As with the BMWP score, the higher the ASPT per sample the cleaner the
Abergelli Power Project – Invertebrate Survey Report

watercourse.  The cleanest waters might therefore have an ASPT close to ‘10’, whilst the most
polluted waters lie closer to ‘1’.  In general terms an ASPT greater than the ‘benchline’ mark of ‘5’ is
indicative of a watercourse in reasonable condition. Water quality monitoring can be carried out
using the same scoring index each time and comparing the results.
Laboratory Identification
3.36
All aquatic macroinvertebrate individuals (excluding fly larvae and worms) collected in the field
were identified to species-level under a stereoscopic microscope (up to 70 x magnification) using
the most up-to-date identification keys available. Identification of aquatic macroinvertebrates was
completed by Dr Jessica Frame of BSG Ecology.
Survey Limitations
3.37
It was not possible to access the northern part of the marshy grassland in the north-west of the
Survey Site after July and therefore larval surveys for marsh fritillary were not carried out in this
area. This is the only area that devil’s bit scabious was recorded in the Survey Site and is the only
area where there was potential for marsh fritillary to occur. Since the restrictions to land access
were applied the Project Site has been subsequently refined due to changes in the design of the
Project and the Project Site no longer includes this area.
3.38
No other constraints to the efficacy of the surveys were recorded.

Results
Desk Study
4.1
SEWBReC provided 40 records of Section 42 Lepidoptera species. The species recorded are
marsh fritillary, dingy skipper Erynnis tages, narrow-bordered bee hawk-moth Hemaris tityus and
small pearl-bordered fritillary Boloria selene. Twenty nine of the records are of marsh fritillary; the
closest of these is located approximately 0.7 km west of the Survey Site boundary in 2009. This
location also contains the closest of the four dingy skipper records, as well as the closest of the five
small pearl-bordered fritillary records and the only narrow-bordered bee hawk-moth record. The
results of the Habitat Potential Assessment (below) include a discussion regarding whether suitable
habitats to support any of these species are present within the Survey Site.
Habitat Potential Assessment
4.2
The results of the desk study were taken into account to assess whether there is suitable habitat
for the Lepidoptera species within 2 km of the Survey Site and whether further survey for any of
these species was justified. The marshy grassland in the north-west of the Survey Site provides
broadly suitable habitat for marsh fritillary (see 3.14), although the food plant devil’s-bit scabious
was only noted in small patches in M25 grassland during the NVC survey (see Figure 1).  Of the
other Section 42 species recorded from the desk study, suitable habitat is present for narrow-
bordered bee hawk-moth, which also largely relies on devil’s bit scabious. The methods employed
during the marsh fritillary transect surveys (see 3.1.5) included recording of day-flying moths such
as this species. For dingy skipper, there are few areas of bare ground, where this species prefers
to bask and no areas where it’s usual egg-laying food plant, bird’s foot trefoil Lotus corniculatus, is
found in any quantity. Small pearl-bordered fritillary is reliant on violets (Viola sp.) as its egg-laying
plant, and violets have not been recorded during the PEA (the April survey was timed to record
them in flower).  It is unlikely that either of these latter two species are present within the Survey
Site.
4.3
Much of the Survey Site is pastoral farmland. The fields are grazed by horses and sheep, and are
largely bounded by fences with occasional trees, scrub and defunct hedgerows. These areas were
discounted from further study on the basis of the habitat being of poor suitability for invertebrates.
Only common and widespread species might be expected to occur in association with such habitat.
4.4
Away from these areas, there are four key habitats that have the potential to be important for
assemblages of invertebrates, including those that are rare, scarce or nationally threatened. These
are:

The area of marshy grassland in the north-west of the Survey Site, which contains a mosaic of
habitats, including M25 grassland, that has the potential to support marsh fritillary;

Several areas of woodland within the Survey Site, most of which are included on the Ancient
Woodland Inventory for Wales and are also SINCs;

Numerous watercourses on site, mostly in the form of ditches along field boundaries, and also
four streams; and

The two ponds (Ponds 11 and 16) within the Survey Site.
4.5
These habitats formed the main focus of the targeted surveys and are described below.
Marshy grassland
4.6
Most areas of marshy grassland within the Survey Site were degraded due to grazing pressure and
were not identified as providing potentially high quality habitat for invertebrates. However, the
marshy grassland habitat in the north-west of the Survey Site forms part of the Waun Garn Wen
SINC and is of higher quality.
4.7
This area was composed of mire (dominated by purple moor grass Molinia caerulea) to the north,
with wet heath to the south and rush pasture around the margins. The northern area was
characterised by the dominance of purple moor grass, which distinguishes it from the rush pasture

described below.  Other species were limited in number and abundance.  Soft rush Juncus effusus
and sharp-flowered rush Juncus acutiflorus can be frequent, but tormentil Potentilla erecta is the
only broad-leaved species that occurred regularly. Other potential food and nectar plants for
invertebrates included cross-leaved heath Erica tetralix, bilberry Vaccinium myrtillus, devil’s-bit
scabious, marsh bedstraw Galium palustre, greater bird’s-foot trefoil and wild angelica Angelica
sylvestris.
4.8
The southern area was largely wet heath, characterised by a mixture of varying quantities of purple
moor-grass, deer grass Trichophorum cespitosum, cross-leaved heath and heather Calluna
vulgaris. Other species included wavy hair grass Deschampsia flexuosa, small amounts of hare’s-
tail cotton grass Eriophorum vaginatum, heath milkwort Polygala serpyllifolia and marsh lousewort
Pedicularis palustris.
4.9
Around the fringes of this area there were pockets of rush pasture, which were defined by the
presence of an abundance of soft rush and/or sharp-flowered rush amongst mesophytic herbs
widely occurring in moister agricultural grasslands. This was not a species-rich habitat, but other
species present included marsh bedstraw and marsh thistle Cirsium palustre, ragged robin Lychnis
flos-cuculi, bulrush Typha latifolium, and lesser spearwort Ranunculus flammula. Species more
typical of scrubby margins were also present, including bramble Rubus fruticosus agg., rosebay
willowherb Chamerion angustifolium, great willowherb Epilobium hirsutum and hemp agrimony
Eupatorium cannabinum.
4.10
This area was also crossed by wet ditches and contained areas of young woodland and small trees
scattered around the edges of the habitat mosaic. It formed part of a much larger area of similar
habitats (mostly contained within the Waun Garn Wen SINC) that extend to the west.
4.11
This combination of habitats may provide an important reservoir for invertebrates within the wider
landscape, where it is intensively farmed. The grassland habitat is complemented by ruderal
vegetation, stands of bracken Pteridium aquilinum, wet ditches, trees and scrub; the combination of
which should provide complex transitional zones that are often rich in invertebrates, due to the
structural diversity they create and the variety of foraging opportunities they provide. The added
height and often permanency of features such as grass and sedge tussocks, scrub and trees offers
important refuges for invertebrates especially during winter when penetrating frosts may otherwise
have adverse consequences.
Woodland
4.12
There were several areas of woodland within the Survey Site. There was a block of broadleaved
woodland along the eastern boundary of the Survey Site (Woodland 4; Figure 1).  The western end
being on a hill, and is dry with widely-spaced trees and a grazed grassland ground flora including
common grassland species. The trees here were small to medium-stemmed with very little
understorey, and included: silver birch Betula pendula, crab-apple Malus sylvestris, holly Ilex
aquifolium and pedunculate oak Quercus robur. Dead wood and bracket fungi were also present,
which can provide suitable habitat for a range of saproxylic invertebrates. The hill slopes down
steeply to the east, where a stream delineates a lower, wetter area of woodland.  Here the tree
species composition was similar but the understorey was more dense, with bramble predominating.
There were also extensive areas of ground flora that were dominated by purple moor-grass with
Sphagnum moss species also present.
4.13
Another relatively extensive area of broad-leaved woodland was present at the south-west end of
the Survey Site around Felindre Gas Compressor Station and the two National Grid 400kV
electrical substations (Woodland 1; Figure 1).  This formed a strip to the south and a more
continuous block to the north of Felindre Gas Compressor Station and the two National Grid 400kV
electrical substations. The woodland was generally quite wet, with alder Alnus glutinous and willow
species Salix spp. frequent along with pedunculate oak, birch and holly.  The trees were growing
close together and were generally small-stemmed and straggly.  The understorey was comprised
of dense bramble, whilst the ground flora was largely absent. Where the woodland opened out, for
example around the margins of Felindre Gas Compressor Station and the two National Grid 400kV
electrical substations, soft-rush dominated marshy grassland was present. This woodland is listed
as ancient woodland but lacks most features of ancient woodland habitat, including significant dead
wood and diverse understorey layers that would be suitable for supporting a diverse invertebrate
fauna. To the north, Woodland 2 (Figure 1) was dominated by semi-mature oak, alder, willow and
birch with a thick bramble understorey.
Abergelli Power Project – Invertebrate Survey Report
12
20/11/2014
4.14
There were also patches of deciduous woodland around the edges of the marshy grassland on the
block of land to the west of the road that runs through the Survey Site (Woodland 3). Tree species
were largely immature and included oak, birch, holly, hawthorn Crataegus monogyna and an
understorey dominated by bramble, but also including ivy Hedera helix, creeping bent Agrostis
stolonifera, Yorkshire fog Holcus lanatus, soft rush, hard fern Blechnum spicant, scaly male fern
Dryopteris affinis and bracken.  The ground flora included nettle Urtica dioica, lady fern Athyrium
filix-femina, wood false brome Brachypodium sylvaticum and abundant Himalayan balsam
Impatiens glandulifera. There was some dead wood present in this area of woodland but it lacked
features characteristic of ancient woodland habitat that would be suitable for supporting a diverse
invertebrate fauna.
Watercourses
4.15
There were numerous small water courses within the Survey Site.  These were mostly ditches
along field boundaries, but there were also some larger streams. The block of marshy grassland to
the west was criss-crossed by numerous ditches, which were largely dry or with marshy bases
when visited in April. There was also a stream that flowed through this block of land – this was
shaded by flanking woodland, with a stone bed and shallow banks. These were all deemed
unsuitable for survey at the time of watercourse sampling in September.
4.16
Another stream flowed south-east through the Survey Site and was split into smaller tributaries
through Woodland 4 (See Figures 1 and 2). It was overgrown with scrub in many places and was
shallow and fast-flowing with riffles and pools along its uniform bank structure and stony bed. This
stream exhibited local detritus but there was no sewage present. No macrophyte cover was found
and in the most heavily shaded sample point (See Figure 2; Sample Point 3) a brown trout Salmo
trutta (parr) was caught during a standard kick sample.
4.17
Another larger stream flowed along the eastern boundary of the Survey Site.  This was relatively
unshaded, with a bed of mud, gravel and rocks. The upstream portion of this watercourse was
approximately 1.5 m in width and the water depth ranged from approximately 10 cm to 20 cm
where pools formed.
It was fast flowing and appeared to be clean as there was no turbidity,
detritus or sewage. Another brown trout (parr) was caught during kick sampling at Sample Point 1
(See Figure 2). Further downstream where two additional kick samples were taken (Sample Points
5 & 6), the stream widened and formed a wide pool at Sample Point 6. The stream had moderate
shade and slight turbidity, was surrounded by scrub and trees and had a substrate of pebbles,
sand and silt.
4.18
There were also small watercourses present around the margin of Felindre Gas Compressor
Station and the two National Grid 400kV electrical substations. These streams were on average 0.5
m wide and 0.3 m deep with the average bank height being 0.4 m. The first stretch sampled
(Sample Point 7) was heavily impinged upon by bank vegetation, mostly scrub that covered the
majority of its length (see Image 14). The flow in this watercourse was low both upstream and
downstream with only riffles over a substrate of gravel and silt. Pastoral land sits on either side of
both streams.
4.19
All features that were visited in February had flowing water, reflecting a period of prolonged wet
weather preceding the survey. This was not the case when sampling took place in September.
Aquatic vegetation was not apparent in any of the watercourses, but marginal vegetation included
frequent soft rush, occasional purple moor-grass and scattered gorse Ulex europaeus and
bramble.
4.20
Watercourses can support rich and varied assemblages of invertebrates adapted to highly
specialised niches across the reach of a watercourse.  Taxonomic orders including Ephemeroptera
(mayflies), Plecoptera (stoneflies), Trichoptera (caddisflies), Odonata (dragonflies), Diptera (true
flies) and aquatic Coleoptera tend to be well represented in such habitats, especially where water
quality appears to be unimpaired.
Ponds
4.21
Although neither Pond 11 nor 16 forms part of a wider cluster of ponds or other waterbodies, both
were located in good quality habitat, either surrounded by marshy grassland and scrub (Pond 11)
or between woodland and neutral grassland (Pond 16). There is likely to be a wide range of
Abergelli Power Project – Invertebrate Survey Report
13
20/11/2014
species potentially associated with such ponds, including (but not limited to): snails (Gastropoda),
diving beetles (Dytiscidae), water beetles (Hydrophilidae), dragonflies and caddisflies.
Targeted Surveys
4.22
Overall, a total of 384 species were recorded during the targeted invertebrate surveys, the results
of which are fully described in the following sections.
Coleoptera
4.23
From the first survey 150 specimens were examined and 95 invertebrate species were identified.
Coleoptera was the dominant order recorded with 70 species recorded, reflecting the search
emphasis, with Hemiptera making up the majority of other records. Hemiptera were taken more as
incidental material and have been included for completeness.
During the second survey, 71
species were recorded. Coleoptera was the dominant order recorded with 46 species (four of which
were also recorded during the first survey), with Hemiptera well represented at 13 species and a
small number of incidental records, such as millipedes, making up the rest. The full list of
Coleoptera species recorded within the four woodlands surveyed is displayed in tabular format in
Appendix 2.
4.24
The four woodlands produced 19 saproxylic species from the first survey with one more species
added from the second survey visit. These species are all included in the general list of Alexander
(2004) with none indicative of continuous saproxylic habitat, which may be taken as an indicator of
the quality of ancient woodland habitat.
4.25
Combining results for the two sample sets results in a list of 150 species, 75% of which are in the
target order, Coleoptera. A total of 20 saproxylic species were recorded, representing 2.8% of the
700 species regarded as saproxylic by Alexander (2004).
4.26
The results of the survey were analysed by measuring the number of locally rare, nationally notable
and IUCN red list / RDB species.
4.27
Overall, the majority of the insects recorded are widely distributed and common, with 15 regarded
as more local, and two of notable status. These notable species are discussed further in Table 1
below.

between the Severn and the Wash.
Marsh Fritillary
Survey for Adult Butterflies
4.28
Seven butterfly and two day-flying moth species were observed during the transect surveys. Marsh
fritillary was not recorded. A summary of the transect survey results are shown in Table 2 below
and the area walked during the transect survey is shown in Figure 1.

4.29
The diversity of butterfly species is typical for a site of this type and location. The numbers of
butterflies recorded were low with the large majority recorded in a narrow strip of flower-rich habitat
in the southernmost part of the area that was surveyed. In general, a lack of flowering nectar-rich
plants during the surveys is likely to have led to the low abundance of butterflies recorded. The
species recorded are generally considered to be common and widespread across south Wales.
4.30
Small heath is the only species recorded that is a S42 species. Although widespread and common
and found in a fairly wide variety of habitats with its main food plants being grasses
(particularly Bents (various) (Agrostis spp.), Fescues (various) (Festuca spp.) and Meadow-grasses
(various) (Poa spp.)), this species has undergone a 10 year decline of 28% (Butterfly Conservation,
2011). None of the S42 butterfly or day-flying moth species recorded from the desk study were
recorded during the surveys.
Incidental sightings
4.31
In addition to the Lepidoptera species recorded above, seven green hairstreak Callophrys rubric
butterflies were recorded while deploying reptile refugia on 16 May in the transect survey area. This
species, although widespread, is relatively localised in distribution in Britain.
Survey for Larvae
4.32
No devil’s bit scabious plants were recorded during the first survey, and therefore a second survey
was not carried out (see 3.18). Marsh fritillary larvae are considered to be absent from the area in
which the survey was carried out.
Moths
4.33
The night-time surveys produced 118 taxa of moth in total (see Appendix 3).
4.34
The macro moth fauna of Glamorgan is well recorded, with hectads12 in Swansea and the Gower
Peninsula being very well covered in a vice-county13 context. Micro Lepidoptera are notably under
recorded, however, which makes robust assessment of apparent abundance based on the number
of records and/or their geographical spread within the vice-county impossible for many species
(Gilmore et al., 2014).
4.35
Gilmore et al. (2014) provide a detailed summary of the number of records, by species, for all
moths in Glamorgan.  For macro moths, the authors attribute an assessment of abundance (very
rare, rare, scarce, uncommon, common etc.) based on the number of records, qualified by further
12 A 10 km x 10 km square often used for biological recording.
13 A vice-county is a geographical division of the British Isles used for the purposes of biological recording
and other scientific data-gathering. Glamorgan contains a single vice-county (number 41), which is split into
a number of hectads, that sub-divide the vice-county into smaller recording units.
Abergelli Power Project – Invertebrate Survey Report

information with regard to how widespread the species is based on the number of hectads it has
occurred in.
4.36
None of the macro moths recorded on the Survey Site was less frequent than ‘very local’, at the
vice-county level.  The most notable species were map-winged swift Hepialus fusconebulosa, and
marbled brown Drymonia dodonaea. Prior to the survey, map-winged swift had been recorded on
200 previous occasions in the vice-county, and in 25 of the 40 10 km hectads that fall within
Glamorgan.  Marbled brown had occurred on 186 previous occasions and in 17 hectads: it is a very
localised species in Glamorgan which only occurs regularly on the Gower Peninsula and in
northern districts of the vice-county.  It is associated with native oak species.
4.37
There was one locally notable micro moth species, the grass veneer Crambus uliginosellus.  This is
a localised species of damp grassland, bogs and fens.  It was recorded at the heath trap in the
area of marshy grassland in the north-west of the Survey Site (M1).  Gilmore et al. (2014) state that
there have been 15 previous records of this species at the vice-county level, and that the species
has been noted in six hectads on Gower and at Crymlyn Bog.
4.38
Thirteen moth species collected were noteworthy due to their status as S42 species. Table 3,
below gives more detailed information about each species and their habitat requirements.

years; research
needed (JNCC,
2010)
Waring & Townsend (2003) state that this species is
common throughout Great Britain. Gilmore et al. (2014)
confirm this remains the case in Glamorgan.  The moth
is associated with grasses, and there are patches of tall
grassland along tracks, roads and on waste ground
within the Survey Site.
Garden 
tiger
Arctia caja
S42: Decline of
86% 
over 
35
years; research
needed (JNCC,
2010)
This species has become scarce in eastern Glamorgan,
but remains common in the south and west, particularly
on the coast (Gilmore et al., 2014).  Waring & Townsend
(2003) indicate that the species could be being affected
by both the general ‘tidying up’ of the countryside and
climatic change.
Latticed 
heath
Chiasmia
clathrata
S42: Decline of
87% 
over 
35
years;
research
needed (JNCC,
2010)
Waring & Townsend (2003) state that this species is
common and well distributed in West Wales (much of
England and Southern Scotland).  Gilmore et al. (2014)
indicate that it is common and widespread in southern
Glamorgan.
Broom 
moth
Melanchra pisi
S42: Decline of
77% 
over 
35
years; research
needed (JNCC,
2010)
Waring & Townsend (2003) state that this species is
common throughout Great Britain, being most abundant
on heather moorland.  Gilmore et al (2014) note that the
moth is frequently encountered in all parts of the vice-
county other than the Vale of Glamorgan.  Locally, the
favoured larval food plant is bracken.
Shoulder-striped
wainscot
Mythimna comma
S42: Decline of
72% 
over 
35
years; research
needed (JNCC,
2010)
Waring & Townsend (2003) state that this species is
common in southern Britain.  Gilmore et al. (2014)
confirm that this status remains relevant to Glamorgan.
The larvae feed on a range of grasses.
White 
ermine
Spilosoma
lubricipeda
S42: Decline of
77% 
over 
35
years; research

Waring & Townsend (2003) state that this species is
common and very well distributed throughout Britain.
Gilmore et al. (2014) confirm this status for Glamorgan.
The larvae feed on a range of herbaceous plants.
Buff 
ermine
Spilosoma luteum
S42: Decline of

Blood 
vein
Timandra comae
S42: Decline of
79% 
over 
35
years; research
needed (JNCC,
2010)
According to Waring & Townsend (2003), this species is
common across England and Wales. The moth is
associated with a variety of herbaceous plants, but
docks in particular, so it would have been well suited to
the field margins and woodland within the Survey Site.
Gilmore et al. (2014) state that it is common throughout
Glamorgan.
Cinnabar
Tyria
jacobaeae
S42: Decline of
83% 
over 
35
years; research
needed (JNCC,
2010)
Waring & Townsend (2003) state that this species is
common across England and Wales, and Gilmore et al.
(2014) confirm that this remains its status in Glamorgan.
The moth is almost exclusively associated with common
ragwort Jacobaea vulgaris and there are some small
patches of this plant within the Survey Site, many of
which hold larvae of this species.
Ear 
moth 
agg.
Amphipoea
oculea
S42:
Declined
by 71% over the
last 35 years;
research
needed (JNCC,
2010)
There are four species of ear moth that could account
for the records.  These can only be distinguished based
on dissection of genitalia.  All have a localised
distribution, and even the commonest
Amphipoea
oculea typically occurs at low density in the UK.
Amphipoea crinanensis has not been recorded in the
vice-county to date.
The three ear moths that have been recorded in
Glamorgan are all either uncommon or rare in the
county.  However their relative abundance (in relation to
each other) is currently unknown (Gilmore et al., 2014).
Based on the habitat present, and the altitude of the site
however, the records are most likely to refer to
Amphipoea oculea as opposed to A. fucosa paludis or A.
lucens. A. oculea is considered an uncommon but
widespread resident in the county.
Small 
phoenix
Ecliptopera
silaceata
S42: 
Declined
by 77% over the
last 35 years;
research
needed (JNCC,
2010)
Waring & Townsend (2003) state that this species is
common throughout mainland Britain, the Inner Hebrides
and Ireland.
Gilmore et al. (2014) state that it is a
common, widespread resident in Glamorgan, and found
in a range of habitats.
Dusky 
thorn
Ennomos
fuscantaria
S42: 
Declined
by 98% over the
last 35 years;
research

2010)
A common resident that is fairly generally distributed and
often frequent in England and Wales.  It occurs
wherever the foodplant, ash Fraxinus excelsior is found
(Waring & Townsend, 2003).
In Glamorgan the species is found throughout southern
areas, but is more localised in northern districts.
Rosy 
rusticI
Hydraecia
micacea
S42: 
Declined
by 86% over the
last 35 years;
research

Occurs in a wide range of habitats including gardens,
waste ground, pasture, fens, marshes and woodland
rides.  It is common and well distributed in Britain and
Ireland (Waring & Townsend, 2003).
It is a common, widespread resident in Glamorgan
(Gilmore et al., 2014)

Forty eight different species were recorded during the pond survey. Pond 11 supported the highest
diversity of aquatic macroinvertebrates, with total of 46 taxa recorded.  Pond 16 supported a more
moderate diversity of 32 taxa. The samples were generally dominated by beetles (21 unique taxa),
followed by bugs (11 unique taxa). No scarce or threatened aquatic invertebrates were identified
within the samples. A complete list of all the macroinvertebrate taxa recorded at each of the ponds
can be found in Appendix 5.

The samples were analysed to at least family level as required to obtain a BMWP/ASPT score for
the stream sections sampled; where possible species were also recorded for completeness and so
that any rare species collected would be identified. The BMWP/ASPT score is then given a quality
rating (Table 6 below). The scores and ratings calculated for the sample points are recorded in
Table 7 (below), and a complete macroinvertebrate taxa list is provided in Appendix 5, Table 2.

The scores for the spring-fed stream (Sampling points 2-4) improve with each step downstream,
but water quality was generally good. There is an increase in distance from the edge of the stream
to the pastoral fields further downstream, from no buffer to a 10 m buffer with trees and scrub. This
Abergelli Power Project – Invertebrate Survey Report

may be a reason for the improving scores, as there is less risk of sediment deposition / spray drift
from adjacent fields when a buffer is present.

Executive Summary
1.1.1
AECOM were commissioned to undertake Great Crested Newt Surveys on ponds
identified as suitable to support GCN within the Project Site and within 500 m of the
Project Site. The Project Site is approximately 30.66 ha and located near to the
village of Felindre, Swansea.
1.1.2
The Abergelli Power Project development proposals are for a proposed 299MW
Open Cycle Gas Turbine power station.
1.1.3
The Abergelli Power Project comprises the following principal elements:
·
A new Power Generation Plant;
·
A new integral Electrical Connection; and,
·
A new integral Gas Connection.
1.1.4
The Power Generation Plant, Gas Connection and Electrical Connection together
are referred to as the Project.
1.1.5
The Project will require the partial removal of terrestrial and aquatic habitat suitable
to support GCN.
1.1.6
It is understood that construction is programmed to commence no sooner than
2020/2021
1.1.7
The GCN is protected under European law through Annexes II and IV of the EC
Habitats Directive (Council Directive 92/43/EEC). Protection is given to all life
stages (e.g. adults, sub-adults, larvae, and eggs). This is implemented into UK law
under section 41 of the Conservation of Habitats and Species Regulations, 2010
where it is listed as a European protected species under Schedule 2. GCN is an
Environment (Wales) Act 2016 Section 7 Priority Species.
1.1.8
A total of 26 ponds were identified within proximity of the Project Site.
1.1.9
A Habitat Suitability Index (HIS) Assessment was undertaken an all ponds within
500m of the Site and ponds outside of the 500 m but clustered with ponds within
the 500m of the Project Site boundary. Further surveys were undertaken, where
appropriate, following the results of the HSI Assessment.

1.1.10 Following the HSI Assessment, off the 26 ponds identified, two were classed as
poor (a further survey was undertaken on one of these) nine were dry and seven
were not accessible and therefore could not be surveyed. A combination of manual
and eDNA surveys were undertaken on nine ponds.
1.1.11 No great crested newts were identified during the manual surveys and the eDNA
surveys undertaken were all returned with a negative result. The manual surveys
ceased once the results of the eDNA surveys had been received. Common
amphibians were identified during the surveys.
1.1.12 Of the seven ponds that were not accessible. These are considered unlikely to
support great crested newts given the lack of GCN records from the local records
centre and the absence of GCN identified in other ponds during the surveys
1.1.13 No further surveys for great crested newts are required and there will be no impact
on great crested newts as part of the Project.
1.1.14 The Project will require the removal of three ponds (Ponds 16, 22 and 23). Pond 22
currently supports palmate newts and is likely to support other amphibians
including frogs and toads as well as a range of generalist aquatic invertebrates.
Pond 16 was dry. Pond 23 could not be assessed but if it contains water has the
potential to support generalist aquatic invertebrates and common amphibians.
1.1.15 Where the scheme design allows, ponds, swales or water bodies, should be
considered to mitigate the loss of the ponds and enhance the Site for common
amphibians.
1.1.16 Log piles and hibernacula could be created in suitable areas of habitat (such as
grassland and scrub/woodland edges), to enhance the area for amphibians.

Introduction
2.1.1
AECOM were commissioned to undertake Great Crested Newt (GCN) Surveys on
ponds identified as suitable to support GCN within the Abergelli site and within
proximity of the Abergelli site (hereafter referred to as the ‘Project Site’). An Habitat
Suitability Index (HSI) Assessment was undertaken an all ponds, where access
allowed, within 500 m of the Site and ponds outside of the 500m but clustered with
ponds within the 500 m of the Project Site boundary. Further surveys were
undertaken following the HSI Assessment.
2.2
The Project
2.2.1
The Project Site is located near to the village of Felindre, Swansea, as shown in
Figure 1.1, and the central grid reference for the Project Site is SN65280143. A full
description of the development is provided in Chapter 3: Project and Site
Description of the ES.
2.3
Great Crested Newt Ecology
2.3.1
GCNs are one of the two European Protected Species of amphibian found in the
UK.
2.3.2
GCNs, like all British amphibians, rely on water bodies for breeding but otherwise
spend much of their lives on land. They are ectotherms and have permeable skins,
so most movement occurs when the air temperature is above approximately 5ºC
and there is, or has recently been rain.
2.3.3
Adults and immature newts spend the winter in places where they will be protected
from frost and flooding. Whilst on land outside of the hibernation period, GCNs will
also take refuge to shelter from extremes of weather; hence during the day they will
often rest in dense vegetation, under refuges or underground. Adult GCNs normally
begin moving from their over-wintering land sites between February and April, with
some adult newts not reaching the desired water body until May, but this is very
weather dependant. Not all life-stages enter water over the course of a year;
immature newts (or efts) may spend all year on land until they reach breeding
condition.
2.3.4
Upon reaching the pond, the peak courtship and egg-laying period is normally from
mid-March to mid-May. The larvae hatch out after about three weeks, and then take
another two to three months to complete larval development. The larvae emerge
from the pond upon completion of metamorphosis and enter the eft land stage. This
move usually begins in early August and lasts for about two months. Adult newts
generally leave the breeding ponds from late May onwards, a movement which
occurs gradually with most newts having left by August but some staying until
October or even remaining over winter.

2.3.5
GCNs in a given area often form a metapopulation (a series of sub-populations that
are linked by dispersal of individuals). Newt populations function in this way since
they depend on habitats which vary in quality over time, and where the distribution
of suitable habitats often changes. This metapopulation concept complicates the
study and conservation of this species, since impacts to a single pond may have
knock-on effects on newts in nearby ponds. GCNs commonly move between ponds
that are up to 250 m from each other but are known to range up to 500 m from
breeding ponds in some cases.
2.3.6
English Nature (Ref. 1) lists the following pond characteristics as being favourable
for GCN populations:
·
Surface area between 100 and 300 m2;
·
Variable depth, but preferably not so deep that aquatic and emergent
vegetation is unable to take root. A maximum depth around 4 m is acceptable;
·
Substantial cover of submerged and marginal vegetation;
·
Open areas to facilitate courtship behaviour;
·
Good populations of invertebrates and other amphibians as prey;
·
Ponds in clusters rather than in isolation;
·
Absence of shading on the south side;
·
Absence of fish; and
·
Absence of waterfowl.
2.4
Great Crested Newt Legislation
2.4.1
The GCN is protected under European law through Annexes II and IV of the EC
Habitats Directive (Council Directive 92/43/EEC). Protection is given to all life
stages (e.g. adults, sub-adults, larvae, and eggs). This is implemented into UK law
under section 41 of the Conservation of Habitats and Species Regulations, 2010
where it is listed as a European protected species under Schedule 2, which in
summary makes it an offence to:
·
Deliberately take (capture), injure or kill a GCN. (In a court, 'deliberately' would
probably be interpreted as someone who, although not intending to take, injure
or kill a GCN, performed the relevant action, being sufficiently informed and
aware of the consequence his/her action will most likely have.);
·
Deliberately disturb a GCN in a way that would affect its ability to survive, breed
or rear young, hibernate or migrate or significantly affect the local distribution or
abundance of the species;
·
Damage or destroy a breeding site or resting place of a GCN;
·
Possess or control any live or dead specimen or anything derived from a GCN;
and,
·
Intentionally take or destroy the eggs of a GCN.
2.4.2
The GCN is also given full protection under Section 9 of the Wildlife and
Countryside Act 1981 (as amended) through its inclusion on Schedule 5. In
summary, the legislation makes it an offence to:
·
Intentionally or recklessly take (capture), injure or kill a GCN;
·
Intentionally or recklessly disturb a GCN;
Abergelli ES 2018 – GREAT CRESTED NEWT SURVEY REPORT
Prepared for: Abergelli Power Limited
AECOM
8
·
Intentionally or recklessly damage or destroy, or obstruct access to, any
structure or place which a GCN uses for shelter or protection or intentionally or
recklessly disturb a GCN while it uses such a place; and,
·
Possess or advertise/sell/exchange a GCN (dead or alive) or any part of a
GCN.
2.4.3
The inclusion of this species on Annex II of the Habitats Directive also means that a
Special Area of Conservation (SAC) can be designated as a protected area due to
a significant presence of this species.
2.4.4
The Natural Environment and Rural Communities (NERC) Act (2006), as amended,
puts an obligation on public bodies to have regard, so far as is consistent with the
proper exercise of their functions, to the purpose of conserving biodiversity. Under
the terms of the Act, conserving biodiversity includes restoring or enhancing
populations and/or habitats. The local planning authority (LPA) or other determining
authority must therefore consider the effects of planning applications upon
biodiversity and how it can be mitigated for or enhanced.
2.4.5
In addition, Government Circular ODPM 06/2005: “Biodiversity and Geological
Conservation – Statutory Obligations and their Impact within the Planning System”
sets out further detail on how species and habitats should be considered during
planning applications.
2.4.6
GCN is an Environment (Wales) Act 2016 Section 7 Priority Species. These are the
species found in Wales which were identified as requiring action under the UK BAP
and which continue to be regarded as conservation priorities under the UK Post-
2010 Biodiversity Framework. As such, it is targeted for measures necessary to
support its conservation status in the UK.
2.5
Quality Assurance
2.5.1
The surveys and subsequent report was undertaken in line with AECOM’s
Integrated Management System (IMS). Our IMS places great emphasis on
professionalism, technical excellence, quality, environmental and Health and Safety
management. All staff members are committed to establishing and maintaining our
certification to the international standards BS EN ISO 9001:2008 and 14001:2004
and BS OHSAS 18001:2007. In addition our IMS requires careful selection and
monitoring of the performance of all sub consultants and contractors.
2.5.2
All AECOM Ecologists who led surveys and completed the reporting for this project
are members of (at the appropriate level) the Chartered Institute of Ecology and
Environmental Management (CIEEM) and all follow their code of professional
conduct (CIEEM, 2013) when undertaking ecological work.

Methodology
3.1
Desk Study
3.1.1
A full desk study was not undertaken to establish the number of ponds within the
Project Site and within 500 m of the Project Site as the client provided AECOM with
the location and number of ponds identified by WSP/PB in March 2017 (Appendix
8.17).
Previous Surveys
3.1.2
The client provided AECOM with a copy of GCN surveys undertaken at the Project
Site by BSG Ecology in 2014 (ES Appendix 8.17).
3.2
Habitat Suitability Assessment
3.2.1
The client provided AECOM with a list of 23 ponds, 19 of these had been subject to
a HSI assessment undertaken by WSP/PB in March 2017. Where access allowed,
these ponds were visited by AECOM in May 2017 to check the assessment score.
3.2.2
HSI is a tool used to assess the likelihood that a water body will support GCN. It
incorporates ten suitability indices (SI), all of which are factors thought to affect the
suitability of a water body to support GCN, such as the quality of the water and the
presence / absence of different predators (particularly fish and waterfowl). Each
variable is assessed separately and then mathematically combined to provide a
numerical index, between 0 and 1 (Ref. 3). The HSI Categorisations is described in
Table 3-1 below.
3.2.3
The following equation is used (Ref. 3):
HSI = (SI1*SI2*SI3*SI4*SI5*SI6*SI7*SI8*SI9*SI10).

3.3
Manual Surveys
3.3.1
Manual GCN surveys were undertaken on ponds (where access allowed) with a
score of below average or above.  GCN surveys were undertaken paying due
regard to Natural England’s Great Crested Newt Standing Advice (Ref. 3) and
Froglife’s Great Crested Newt Conservation Handbook (Ref. 1). GCN Surveys were
undertaken by an appropriately licenced ecologist and in suitable weather
conditions. Manual surveys ceased once a negative eDNA sampling result had
been received. The manual surveys that were undertaken were carried out within
the Natural Resources Wales (NRW) approved survey season window.
3.3.2
Four GCN manual survey visits are required to establish GCN presence/ absence
within the period mid-March to mid-June (with at least two surveys during mid-April
to mid-May). An additional two surveys (six in total) are required to estimate GCN
population. Three out of five survey techniques are required on each of the ponds
surveyed. A combination of four survey techniques were utilised as appropriate.
Torchlight searching, bottle trapping, egg searching and netting. All manual survey
methods were undertaken by at least one NRW GCN licence holder. A description
of the survey techniques used is as follows:
a)
Torching
3.3.3
The water body was thoroughly searched using torch light between dusk and
midnight. The surveyor walked slowly around the perimeter of the water body once
(where access was possible), checking for newts in the torch beam every 2 – 3 m,
paying particular attention to marginal vegetation and potential display areas on the
pond bottom. Care was taken with the torch to minimise disturbance to the newts
and other wildlife which may have been present (e.g. nesting birds). To allow
comparison between ponds, the same power of torch (between 100,000 –
1,000,000 candlepower) was used on every occasion.
b)
Bottle Trapping
3.3.4
Bottle traps were set around the margin of the water body in the evening and left
overnight to catch adults during the breeding season. Traps were set at an
appropriate density of one trap per two metres of shoreline dependent upon
individual site variations. The guidelines set out by Natural England, Froglife, and
the Herpetofauna Workers Manual was followed strictly to ensure the welfare of
trapped newts and other aquatic organisms.
c)
Egg Searching
3.3.5
Submerged and floating aquatic vegetation was checked by the surveyor in order
to locate great crested newt eggs. Egg searches are terminated when presence of
great crested newt eggs is confirmed. This method is unreliable for population
estimates. Terminated egg searches where great crested newt eggs have been
identified avoids excess damage to the eggs by minimising impacts of predation
and UV light.

AECOM
11
d)
Netting
3.3.6
A sturdy dip-net with a 2 – 4 mm mesh was used for netting for fifteen minutes per
50m of pond shoreline.
3.4
eDNA Sampling
3.4.1
eDNA sampling was undertaken following the methodologies provided in Biggs et al
(Ref. 5). eDNA kits were purchased from SureScreen. Water sampling was
undertaken by at least one NRW GCN licenced surveyor per pond. Water samples
were taken from 20 locations around each pond as described in the instructions
provided by SureScreen and in Ref. 5. Samples were stored in accordance with the
instructions provided by SureScreen and returned to SureScreen for analysis. Care
was taken at all steps in the procedure to avoid contamination of samples.
3.4.2
The following NRW GCN licenced surveyors were used to undertake the manual
and eDNA surveys:
3.4.3
Clare Morgans GradCIEEM, Ben Walsh ACIEEM and Jack Muskett GradCIEEM.
3.5
Limitations
a)
Pond Access
3.5.1
Of the 26 ponds identified, seven were not accessible. Six of these were not
accessible due to land access restrictions (Ponds 12-14, 18, 23 and 24) and one
was surrounded by a large, tall area of dense bramble vegetation (Pond 10) and
therefore could not be surveyed. (see Section 4.1.2, Table 4-1).
3.5.2
Ponds 12-14 and 18 are located close to each other approximately 400-500 m east
of the Project Site boundary. There is the possibility that these ponds may support
GCN, although this is considered unlikely given the lack of GCN records from the
local records centre and the absence of GCN identified in other ponds during the
surveys.
3.5.3
Pond 10 is not considered likely to support GCN. It has previously been surveyed
and no evidence of GCN was found (ES Appendix 8.17). No records of GCN were
returned from the local records centre. Ponds 9 and 21 which are within close
proximity were deemed not suitable to support GCN and no evidence of GCN was
found in Pond 19a.
3.5.4
Pond 23 is not considered likely to support GCN given the lack of GCN records
from the local records centre and the absence of GCN in other ponds within a 500
m radius.
3.5.5
Pond 24 is located to the west of the Project Site and may support GCN, although
this is considered unlikely given the lack of GCN records from the local records
centre and the absence of GCN identified in other ponds during the surveys.
b)
Manual Surveys

AECOM
12
3.5.6
The three required manual survey methods were not undertaken on Ponds 1b, 4,
11 and 19b (see Section 4.1.2, Table 4-1 and Section 4.2, Table 4-4) due to a
combination of health and safety issues and dense vegetation.
3.5.7
Ponds 1b and 4 are within a cluster of ponds to the north west of the Project Site.
No evidence of GCN was identified for Pond 7 and Pond 8 which is within this
cluster of ponds and therefore the manual survey limitation is not deemed
significant.
3.5.8
Pond 11 has previously been surveyed and no evidence of GCN was found (ES
Appendix 8.17). Therefore the manual survey limitation is not deemed significant.
3.5.9
On the first survey visit to Pond 19b, the water level had dropped making it
impossible to bottle trap. Torching was attempted but not possible due to the low
water level and vegetation cover. Egg searching was not possible as the access
was restricted to the vegetation due to deep soft mud. Pond 19b is connected to
Pond 19a. Pond 19a was deemed poor as part of the HSI assessment. However,
due to the limitation to the surveys on Pond 19b, manual surveys and an eDNA
survey were undertaken on Pond 19a. No evidence of GCN was returned for Pond
19a and therefore the manual survey limitation on Pond 19b is not deemed
significant.
3.5.10 Manual surveys were not undertaken on Pond 17, as AECOM did not gain land
access permission to the pond within the required survey season time. However,
once granted it was possible to eDNA sample Pond 17 within the approved survey
season window.
3.5.11 A summary of the manual survey and eDNA limitations is given in Table 3-2.
c)
eDNA Sampling
3.5.12 eDNA surveys were undertaken on all ponds, where access allowed, of below
average category and above, with the exception of Ponds 19a and 19b. On the first
manual survey visit to Pond 19b, the water level had dropped and deep soft mud
was exposed on the edges making it unsuitable for eDNA sampling.  As Pond 19b
is connected to Pond 19a, the decision was taken to proceed with an eDNA survey
on Pond 19a despite it being categorised as Poor. As the GCN eDNA result
returned for Pond 19a was negative, it was assumed that Pond 19b was also
negative as the two ponds are connected.
3.5.13 The eDNA sampling was restricted due to accessibility on Ponds 1b, 4 and 11
caused by dense vegetation and soft, deep mud. Approximately only 5% of the
perimeter of the pond was accessible to sample (see Table 3-2 and  Table 4-5).
Usually a GCN eDNA water sample which has been taken from such a restricted
area reduces the confidence in any negative result returned as GCN eDNA can be
patchy depending upon where the animals have been in the pond.

3.5.14 However on this occasion, given the lack of evidence of GCN within other ponds in
close proximity of Ponds 1b, 4 and 11 and the previous survey undertaken on Pond
11 which returned no results for GCN (ES Appendix 8.17). The eDNA limitation on
Ponds 1b, 4 and 11 is not deemed significant.

Results
4.1
Desk Study
4.1.1
WSP/PB identified a total of 23 ponds within 500 m of the previous Project Site
boundary and undertook a HSI assessment on 19 of these, 16 of which were
considered suitable to support GCN (see Table 4-1).
4.1.2
The Preliminary Ecological Appraisal (PEA) undertaken by AECOM in May 2017
(ES Appendix 8.1) identified a further two ponds within 500 m of the Project Site
(See Table 4-1 Pond 23 and 24).
4.1.3
The WSP/PB (ES Appendix 8.13) and the AECOM PEA (ES Appendix 8.1) desk
study highlighted that no GCN records were returned within 2 km of the Project Site
from the local records centre.
a)
Previous Surveys
4.1.4
The GCN surveys undertaken by BSG Ecology in 2014 did not identify any GCN
from the ponds surveyed (ES Appendix 8.17). Palmate newts Lissotriton helveticus
and smooth newts Lissotriton vulgaris were identified.
b)

Manual Surveys
4.2.1
Following the AECOM updated HSI assessment, manual surveys were
undertaken on all ponds, where access allowed, of below average category
and above (with the exception of Pond 19a see Section 3.5). Access to Pond
17 was granted at a later stage than the other ponds and part of the manual
survey season was missed. Therefore manual surveys were not undertaken
on this pond. eDNA sampling was undertaken on Pond 17 (see Section 4.3).
4.2.2
The results of the surveys are shown in Table 4-2 and the weather conditions
are shown in Table 4-3. No GCN were recorded during any of the manual
surveys. Other amphibians were present in the ponds including palmate
newts, frogs and toads and a range of aquatic invertebrates including diving
beetle, dragonfly nymphs and pond skaters.
4.2.3
Weather conditions were considered favourable during all of the surveys as
shown in Table 4-3. The manual surveys ceased once the results of the
eDNA surveys had been received.
4.2.4
In 2014 manual surveys were undertaken by BSG Ecology on Ponds 10, 11
and 15-17 and no GCN were identified (ES Appendix 8.17).

#Details for ponds which had less than the three required manual survey methods are given in Section 3.5 and in the limitations section in Table 4-1.
**A dead water shrew was found in one of the bottle traps in Pond 7, therefore bottle trapping ceased for Ponds 7 and 8 and the netting technique was used for future surveys (see
Section 3.5)

Ecological Constraints and Indicative Potential Impacts
5.1.1
The indicative potential impacts of the Project on habitats and protected
species are outlined below; potential impacts will be assessed fully during
the Ecology Impact Assessment (EcIA).
5.1.2
No GCN were identified within nine ponds surveyed (Ponds 1b, 4, 7, 8, 11,
17, 19a, 19b and 22). The local records centre did not return any records of
GCN within 2 km of the Project Site. Previous surveys of ponds 10, 11, 15,
16 and 17 by BSG Ecology in 2014 did not identify the presence of GCN (ES
Appendix 8.17). Therefore, it is considered unlikely that any GCN will be
present within any of the ponds that were not surveyed or within 500 m of
these ponds in surrounding habitat given the absence of GCN from all
nearby ponds, and it is considered that there will be no impacts on GCN.
5.1.3
The Project will require the removal of three ponds (Ponds 16, 22 and 23).
Pond 22 currently supports palmate newts and is likely to support other
amphibians including frogs and toads, as well as a range of generalist
aquatic invertebrates. Pond 16 was dry. Pond 23 could not be assessed but
if it contains water has the potential
to support generalist aquatic
invertebrates and common amphibians. Removal of the ponds will result in
loss of habitat for a small number of common amphibians and common
aquatic invertebrates.
6.
Further Surveys and Recommendations
6.1
Further Surveys
6.1.1
No further surveys are recommended.
6.2
Recommendations for Mitigation and Enhancement
6.2.1
The Project will require the removal of three ponds (Ponds 16, 22 and 23).
Pond 22 currently supports palmate newts and is likely to support other
amphibians including frogs and toads as well as a range of generalist
aquatic invertebrates. Pond 16 was dry. Pond 23 could not be assessed but
if it contains water has the potential to support generalist aquatic
invertebrates and common amphibians.
6.2.2
Where the scheme design allows, ponds, swales or water bodies, should be
considered to mitigate the loss of the ponds and enhance the Project Site for
common amphibians.
6.2.3
If a waterbody is included in the scheme design this should be managed
specifically for amphibians and not stocked with fish. The waterbody could
include planting of marginal and floating vegetation. The waterbody and any
bankside vegetation should be managed to control over shading.

6.2.4
Log piles and hibernacula could be created in suitable areas of habitat (such
as grassland and scrub/woodland edges), to enhance the area for
amphibians.

Reptile Survey Report
1.1
Introduction
1.1.1
AECOM was commissioned to undertake a suite of ecological survey work to
inform the Abergelli Power Project (the “Project”).
1.1.2
The Project Site is located near to the village of Felindre, Swansea, as shown in
Figure 1, and the central grid reference for the Site is SN 6528 0143. A full
description of the Project is provided in Chapter 3: Project and Site Description.
1.1.3
The Preliminary Ecological Appraisal Report (AECOM, June 2017) identified that
surveys for reptiles were required within areas of suitable habitat at the Project Site.
1.1.4
This report outlines the presence of reptiles within the reptile survey area and
outlines initial recommendations for further surveys, mitigation and enhancement.
1.1.5
The reptile survey area encompasses all suitable habitats accessible within the
Project Site boundary, as shown on Figure 2.
a)
Objectives of this Survey
1.1.6
The objectives of this survey were:
·
To identify any designated nature conservation sites within or in the vicinity of
the Project Site boundary that have the potential to support reptiles;
·
To identify any known records and/or populations of reptiles in the vicinity of the
Project Site boundary;
·
To record and map evidence of reptiles;
·
To make an initial ecological assessment of the Project Site boundary in
respect to reptiles;
·
To highlight any initial potential ecological constraints in respect to reptiles;
·
To outline further survey work that may be required; and,
·
To make initial suggestions for mitigation, compensation and enhancement of
the natural features identified on the within the Project Site boundary in respect
to reptiles.
1.2
Legislation
1.2.1
British reptiles are protected under Schedule 5 of the Wildlife and Countryside Act
1981 (as amended).
1.2.2
For sand lizard Lacerta agilis and smooth snake Coronella austriaca all parts of
Section 9 apply. This prohibits:
·
intentional killing;
·
injuring or taking (capture. etc);
·
possession;
·
intentional disturbance whilst occupying a 'place used for shelter or protection'
and destruction of these places; and,

·
trade (i.e. sale, barter, exchange, transporting for sale and advertising to sell or
to buy).
1.2.3
For the four widespread species of reptile, namely the common lizard Zootoca
vivipara, slow-worm Anguis fragilis, grass snake Natrix helvetica helvetica and
European adder Vipera berus, only part of sub-section 9(1) and all of sub-section
9(5) apply. These prohibit:
·
intentional killing;
·
injuring; and,
·
trade (i.e. sale, barter, exchange, transporting for sale and advertising to sell or
to buy).
1.3

All AECOM Ecologists who worked on this project are members of (at the
appropriate level) the Chartered Institute of
Ecology and Environmental
Management (CIEEM) and follow their code of professional conduct (CIEEM, 2013)
when undertaking ecological work.
1.4
Methodology
a) Desk study
1.4.1
The objective of the desk study is to review the existing information available in the
public domain concerning species and habitats to identify the following:
·
Internationally and nationally designated sites for reptiles, up to 2 km from the
Project Site using the Multi Agency Geographic Information for the Countryside
(MAGIC) website (www.magic.gov.uk);
·
Reptile records and records of locally designated sites for reptiles up to 2 km
from the Project Site, using the South East Wales Biodiversity Records Centre
(SEWBReC);
·
The Section 7 list of Principal Importance for Conservation of Biological
Diversity in Wales was reviewed for inclusion of reptiles; and,
·
Aerial photographs and Ordnance Survey (OS) maps were reviewed to identify
features of ecological interest surrounding the Project Site, nearby areas of
ecological interest and features connecting these habitats (hedgerows,
watercourses, railway lines).
1.4.2
The reports of previous surveys undertaken by BSG Ecology were provided by the
client and subsequently reviewed.

AECOM 1-6
b) Reptile Presence / Likely Absence Survey
1.4.3
The Phase 1 Habitat map (AECOM, 2017) and OS mapping were used to identify
habitat suitable for supporting reptiles within the Project Site boundary.
1.4.4
The reptile survey methodology paid due regard to reptile survey guidelines
provided by Froglife Advice Sheet 10 (Froglife, 1999) and the Herpetofauna
Workers’ Manual (Gent, T and Gibson, S, 1998).
1.4.5
Artificial refugia (approximately 0.5 m x 0.5 m square sheets of heavy-duty mineral
roofing felt – known as ‘reptile survey mats’) were placed in suitable locations within
suitable habitat (e.g. sunny areas adjacent denser vegetation and south facing) on
the 21st August 2017. These were left for 10 days to ‘bed-in’, until the start of
September when the suitable reptile survey period started.
1.4.6
A total of 99 reptile survey mats were placed within an area of 3.8 ha. This exceeds
the minimum density of 10 per hectare recommended in guidelines provided by
Froglife, 1999.
1.4.7
Figure 1 shows the Phase 1 Habitat map used to assess suitable reptile habitat.
Figure 2 shows the location of the reptile survey mats.
1.4.8
Reptile survey mats were checked on seven subsequent occasions in suitable
weather conditions (within a constant temperature range of between 10 – 20°C,
rain and windy conditions are usually unsuitable, sunny spells after rain can be
suitable (Froglife, 1999)). Each reptile survey mat was initially inspected from a
suitable distance to identify any reptiles that may be present basking on top of the
reptile survey
mats, without causing disturbance. The refugia were then
approached quietly and carefully, and lifted swiftly to examine the ground beneath;
any reptiles present were noted. During each survey, other artificial debris (such as
waste wood, plastic sheeting) and other naturally occurring habitat features likely to
be used by reptiles (such as small logs) were also checked for the presence of
reptiles.
1.4.9
Surveys were completed by suitably qualified ecologists with at least five years’
experience of ecological consultancy and with experience completing reptile
surveys.
1.4.10 The weather conditions were considered largely suitable for undertaking reptile
surveys. Weather conditions and survey dates are shown in Table 1.2.

AECOM 1-7
c) Evaluation
1.4.11 In order to assess the value of any given reptile population, two assessment
methodologies may be applied. Nationally, the guidelines for the selection of Sites
of Special Scientific Interest (JNCC, 1989) provide criteria for identifying nationally
important populations of reptiles. The methodology developed by Froglife (1999)
used in the identification of Key Reptile Sites can be used to evaluate reptile
populations at a local or regional level.
1.4.12 To qualify as a Key Reptile Site, a site must meet at least one of the following
criteria:
·
Supports three or more reptile species;
·
Supports two snake species;
·
Supports an exceptional population (see Table 1.1) of one species;
·
Supports an assemblage of species scoring at least 4 (see Table 1.1); or,
·
Does not meet any of the previous criteria, but is of particular regional
importance due to local rarity.

1.5
Limitations
1.5.1
Biological records can be received from a wide variety of sources and may or may
not be comprehensive and accurate. However, if assessed in conjunction with a
survey, they can contribute to a robust ecological assessment of a site.
1.5.2
Several areas of habitat suitable for supporting reptiles within the Project Site
boundary could not be surveyed using artificial refugia due to the presence of
grazing livestock. Artificial refugia would pose a health and safety risk to the
livestock as well as posing a risk of trampling to sheltering reptile utilising the
artificial refugia. These areas lacked features where reptiles might be easily
observed and as such a walkover survey of these areas was not deemed
appropriate. There is the potential for reptiles to have gone unrecorded in these
areas. These areas have been indicated on Figure 2.
1.5.3
The survey method is designed to identify the presence or likely absence of
common reptile species. There is the potential for the survey to have recorded a
small sample of the populations present and if a reptile species occurs at a low
density it may have been missed.

Previous Surveys
undertaken by BSG
Ecology, 2014
Common Lizard
A total of 163 adult and juvenile common lizard observations were
recorded, with a peak count of 50 recorded on one survey visit.
Observations were across the survey area within the Project Site
boundary. During the course of the survey both male and female
common lizard were recorded with some of the females being
gravid, which confirmed that there was a breeding population
present. (Appendix 8.5 of the ES).
Grass Snake
In total ten observations were recorded for grass snake with a
peak count of five recorded on one survey visit. The majority of
observations of grass snake were made in the area of marshy
grassland close to a pond. Juvenile grass snake was recorded
along with adults which suggested a breeding population present.
As grass snake are a wide ranging species and the location of the
animals recorded were near to the boundary, the presence of
juveniles could not necessarily confirm that breeding was taking
place within the Project Site boundary (Appendix 8.5 of the ES).

Conclusions
a) Project Site Assessment
1.7.1
The desk study confirmed the presence of slow-worm, grass snake, adder and
common lizard within 2 km, and the presence of grass snake and common lizard
within the Project Site boundary.
1.7.2
During the 2017 reptile survey a total of 51 adult and juvenile common lizard
observations were recorded, with a peak count of 6 adults recorded on one survey
visit. Observations of common lizard were recorded from across the reptile survey
area within the Project Site boundary. The majority of records were from the verges
either side of the grassy track running through the centre of the Project Site and
from the semi-improved neutral grassland present around the National Grid site.
1.7.3
During the course of the reptile survey male, female and juvenile common lizards
were recorded, which confirmed that there was a breeding population present
within the Project Site boundary.
1.7.4
No grass snakes were identified within the reptile survey area including the area
with the highest abundance during the 2014 surveys (Appendix 8.5 of the ES).
However, there is the potential for grass snake to be present within the Project Site
boundary and to have gone unrecorded since:
·
grass snake are wide ranging;
·
Pond 16, where the majority of the 2014 records were from was mostly dry
throughout the 2017 reptile survey period, making the areas less suitable for
supporting grass snake; and,
·
the area in the north of the reptile survey area where grass snake were
recorded in 2014 could not be accessed for survey in 2017 due to grazing
livestock.
1.7.5
As such, it should be assumed grass snake is likely to be present at low densities
within the Project Site boundary and surrounding habitat.
b) Population and ‘Key reptile Site’ Criteria
1.7.6
Based on the survey results and the criteria laid out in Table 1.1, the Project Site
supports a ‘Good population’ of common lizard.
1.7.7
The Project Site does not meet the criteria for a ‘Key Reptile Site’.
c) Amphibian Species
1.7.8
Common toads were recorded under the reptile survey mats across the reptile
survey area, including juvenile and adults and as such it can be assumed that
common toad is breeding within or near to the Project Site boundary.

Recommendations
d)
Recommendations for Further Surveys
1.8.1
It is anticipated that no further surveys will be required.
e) Recommendations for Mitigation
1.8.2
At this stage the following key recommendations have been made:
·
Prior to construction commencing, areas within the Project Site boundary that
are suitable for supporting reptiles or are known to support reptiles should
undergo an exclusion fencing and translocation programme, including habitat
management, to move reptiles out of construction zones into suitable habitat
thereby limiting harm, injury or killing;
·
As part of the translocation programme, a suitable receptor site will need to be
identified to accept the reptiles translocated from the areas impacted by
construction phase activities and operational footprint of the Project.
·
The receptor site will need a population survey for reptiles undertaken to
ascertain it’s suitability for holding greater numbers of reptiles, this may be
possible within the Order Limits and it is proposed to discuss the findings of this
report with CCS and NRW and identify an area within the existing Order Limits.
An area of suitable or sub-optimal habitat can be utilised within the Project Site
boundary. If the area is sub-optimal, habitat management works will be
required to increase its suitability for reptiles with the aim to create structurally
diverse habitats. These will include:
o
Areas of cover to provide shelter and protection from predators;
o
Open areas in sunny spots and south facing slopes to provide areas for
basking; and
o
Mosaic of structural diversity including areas with different plant species,
age and height.
·
In addition, there must be:
o
Connectivity of habitats to allow movement between hibernating, foraging
and basking areas and to allow dispersal of populations; and
o
Inclusion of habitat edges and transitional zones including woodland
edges and grassland/scrub interface.
·
Habitat management works may take up to two years, depending on the
current condition of the area, to allow habitats to grow and develop these
features suitable for supporting reptile; and,
·
A Method Statement for the translocation and habitat management programme
should be written by a suitability experienced ecologist and agreement of the
Method Statement sought from the county ecologist.
f)
Recommendations for Biodiversity Enhancement
1.8.3
At this stage the following precautionary recommendations have been made:
·
Consider reptiles in the landscaping of the Project Site where possible.
·
Create artificial habitat features including:
o
Log and brash piles – to create cover, provide structural diversity and
enhance prey availability; and
Abergelli ES 2018 – REPTILE SURVEY REPORT
Prepared for: Abergelli Power Limited              
AECOM
1-15
o
Artificial hibernacula – create piles of rocks, logs, rubble etc. Some of this
should be buried below ground. Southward facing and well drained
locations are the most successful.
o
Basking sites – create south facing banks in open areas.
·
Manage the Project Site boundary under client ownership for reptiles.
Appropriate techniques should be adopted to prevent succession change in
areas of suitable habitat.

Breeding Bird Survey Report
1.1
Introduction
1.1.1
AECOM was commissioned to undertake a suite of ecological survey work to
inform the Abergelli Power Project (the “Project”), and support the Environmental
Statement (ES).
1.1.2
The Project Site is located near to the village of Felindre, Swansea, as shown in
Figure 1, and the central grid reference for the Project Site is SN65280143. A full
description of the development is provided in Chapter 3 (Project and Site
Description).
1.1.3
The Preliminary Ecological Appraisal Report (AECOM, 2017) identified that surveys
for breeding birds were required at the Project Site.
1.1.4
This baseline report describes the status of breeding birds within the breeding bird
survey area and makes initial indications of potential effects and outlines initial
recommendations for further surveys, mitigation and enhancement.
1.1.5
The breeding bird survey area encompasses all suitable and accessible areas of
woodland, hedgerows and scrub within proximity of and within the Project Site
boundary, as shown on Figure 1.
1.1.6
Previous surveys have been undertaken by BSG Ecology is provided in the ES
Appendix 8.16.
a)
Objectives of the Study
1.1.7
The objectives of this study were:
·
To identify any designated nature conservation sites within or in the vicinity of
the Project Site boundary that have the potential to support notable breeding
bird species or assemblages;
·
To identify any known records of breeding birds in the vicinity of the Project Site
boundary;
·
To record and map evidence of breeding bird activity;
·
To make an initial ecological assessment of the value of the Project Site to
breeding birds;
·
To highlight any initial potential ecological constraints related to breeding birds;
·
To outline further survey work that may be required; and,
·
To make initial suggestions for mitigation, compensation and enhancement of
the natural features identified within the Project Site with respect to the
breeding bird assemblage.

1.2
Legislation
1.2.1
There are several different acts of legislation and regulations which refer to the
protection of wildlife. Legislation with particular relevance to birds is outlined below.
1.2.2
This is a brief summary of the legislation and is not to be regarded as a definitive
legal opinion. When dealing with individual cases, the client is advised to consult
the full texts of the relevant legislation and obtain further legal advice.
b)
Statutory Legislation
1.2.3
Key legislation for birds in the UK includes:
·
Council Directive 79/409/EEC on the conservation of wild birds (the EC Birds
Directive); and,
·
Wildlife and Countryside Act 1981 (as amended) [WCA].
1.2.4
Annex 1 of the EC Birds Directive lists rare and vulnerable species of regularly
occurring or migratory wild birds that are subject to special conservation measures.
The Directive also provides for the designation of SPAs for the protection of these
species, which form part of the Natura 2000 network of sites protected by European
wildlife legislation.
1.2.5
Part 1 of the WCA sets out how the provisions of the Convention on the
Conservation of European Wildlife and Natural Habitats (the 'Bern Convention'), the
EC Birds Directive and the EC Habitats Directive are implemented in Great Britain.
Under Part 1, Section 1 of the WCA it is an offence to:
·
Kill, injure or take any wild bird intentionally;
·
Take, damage or destroy the nest of any wild bird while that nest is in use or
being built; and,
·
Take or destroy the egg(s) of any wild bird.
1.2.6
Schedule 1 of the WCA lists a number of species which, in addition to the
provisions listed above, are protected by special penalties at all times, including
against disturbance when breeding.
1.2.7
The WCA requires the prosecuting authority to prove that an offence was
intentional, however the Countryside and Rights of Way (CROW) Act 2000
strengthens the provisions of the WCA by introducing an additional offence of
“reckless” disturbance, which means that ignorance of the presence of a protected
species cannot be used as a reliable defence should a breach of the WCA be
committed.  The Natural Environment and Rural Communities (NERC) Act 2006
strengthens the WCA further with respect to the protection of the nests of certain
birds listed on Schedule Z1A, even when they are not in use.  The NERC Act also
offers additional protection to birds released into the wild as part of a repopulation
programme and provides minor amendments to the WCA with respect to captive
birds.

1.2.8
The Environment (Wales) Act 2016 strengthens the duty previously applied under
the Natural Environment and Rural Communities Act (2006) placed on planning
authorities to have due regard to biodiversity when making decisions. A number of
species of bird are listed on the Environment (Wales) Act 2016 Section 7 Priority
Species. These are the species found in Wales which were identified as requiring
action under the UK Biodiversity Action Plan (BAP) and which continue to be
regarded as conservation priorities under the UK Post-2010 Biodiversity
Framework. As such, it is targeted for measures necessary to support its
conservation status in the UK.
c) Non Statutory Policy
1.2.9
The RSPB (2009) and Eaton et al. (2009) have published lists of Birds of
Conservation Concern (BoCC). Red List species are those whose breeding
population or range is rapidly declining (50% or more in the last 25 years), recently
or historically, and those of global conservation concern. Amber List species are
those whose breeding population is in moderate decline (25 – 49% in the last 25
years), rare breeders, internationally important and localised species and those of
unfavourable conservation status in Europe.
1.2.10 These lists confer no legal status; however they are useful when assessing the
significance of predicted impacts and determining the level of mitigation that may
be required when birds are affected by development or any other activity.
Furthermore, inclusion on the Red List is a factor in determining the species which
may be added to the list of species of principal importance under the Environment
(Wales) Act.
1.3
Quality Assurance
1.3.1
This survey and subsequent report was undertaken in line with AECOM’s
Integrated Management System (IMS).
Our IMS places great emphasis on
professionalism, technical excellence, quality, environmental and Health and Safety
management. All staff members are committed to establishing and maintaining our
certification to the international standards BS EN ISO 9001:2008 and 14001:2004
and BS OHSAS 18001:2007.
In addition, our IMS requires careful selection and
monitoring of the performance of all sub-consultants and contractors.
1.3.2
All AECOM Ecologists who worked on this project are members of (at the
appropriate level) the Chartered Institute of Ecology and Environmental
Management (CIEEM) and follow their code of professional conduct (CIEEM, 2013)
when undertaking ecological work.
1.4
Methodology
a)
Desk Study
1.4.1
The objective of the desk study is to review the existing information available in the
public domain concerning species and habitats to identify the following:
Abergelli ES 2018 – BREEDING BIRD SURVEY REPORT
Prepared for: Abergelli Power Limited
AECOM
6
·
Internationally and nationally designated sites for birds, up to 2 km from the
Project Site using the Multi Agency Geographic Information for the Countryside
(MAGIC) website (NE, 2017);
·
Bird records and records of locally designated sites for breeding birds up to 2
km from the Project Site, using the South East Wales Biodiversity Records
Centre (SEWBReC);
·
Bird species within the Section 7 list of Principal Importance for Conservation of
Biological Diversity in Wales;
·
Features of ecological interest surrounding the Project Site, nearby areas of
ecological interest and features connecting these habitats (hedgerows,
watercourses, railway lines) using aerial photographs and Ordnance Survey
(OS) maps.
1.4.2
The reports of previous surveys undertaken by BSG Ecology were provided by the
client and were reviewed (ES Appendix 8.16).
b)
Breeding Bird Survey
1.4.3
The Project Site was visited on two occasions to identify the presence and status of
breeding birds within the Project Site. Surveys were undertaken paying due regard
to guidance provided in Breeding Bird Survey (BBS) methodology. All parts of the
Project Site were visited on foot to within 50 m where visibility extended or closer
where visibility was needed for example in woodlands or behind hedgerows.
Surveys were carried out on days with little or no wind, rain or mist in order to
maximise the potential for detection of birds and to avoid the possibility of bird
activity being suppressed by inclement weather conditions. Surveys were
completed by personnel with experience of the likely species assemblage for this
geography and habitat type. Survey dates, personnel and weather conditions are
shown in Table 1.1.
1.4.4
Species were identified by sight or sound and details of behaviour and activity was
recorded. A range of optical equipment including binoculars and telescope were
used as required and to minimise disturbance to potentially breeding species. A
species list of common passerine birds was compiled for the site; details of activity
and behaviour were made. The results were analysed to assess the status of the
birds on site as one of the following:
·
Non-breeding – Flyover or species observed within unsuitable breeding habitat;
·
Possible breeding – Species observed in breeding season in suitable nesting
habitat;
·
Probable breeding – Pair observed in suitable nesting habitat in breeding
season, territorial behaviour observed on at least two occasions, courtship and
display observed, observed visiting probable nest site, agitated behaviour or
anxiety calls from adults or nest building observed; or
·
Confirmed breeding – Used nest or eggshells, distraction display/injury feigning
observed, recently fledged young, adults on nest, adult carrying faecal sac or
food, nest containing eggs or nest with young seen/heard.

Limitations
1.5.1
BBS methodology was not followed in its entirety; species and activity were
recorded on a base map and species list and locations and behaviours recorded.
This gave a broad assessment of species present, potential for breeding and
potential ornithological constraints at the site. Territory mapping was not undertaken
since the surveys started in the later part of the breeding season and many species
had fledged and were recorded through the presence of dependent (or recently
independent) young as breeding.
1.5.2
The second survey visit on 14 June included an evening survey of the northern part
of the Site followed by a dusk walkover of marshy grassland in the south of the
Project Site looking for evidence of crepuscular species. The intention was to
complete the survey of the remainder of the Project Site the next morning (15 June)
from dawn onwards but the survey was unable to be completed due to a persistent
threat to surveyor safety.
1.5.3
There is potential for some birds to be missed or to go unnoticed due to the nature
of breeding bird surveys and possibility of birds not vocalising and/or being present
in dense vegetation. When combined with previous surveys and given the relatively
simple nature of habitats it is considered that the current BBS provides an accurate
assessment of the ornithological value of the Project Site to breeding birds.
1.5.4
There were no further limitations to this survey.

Surrounding Land
Use
The Project Site is located to the north of Junction 46 of the M4
Motorway close to the village of Felindre, Swansea.
The Project Site has agricultural fields to the east, south and
north. Areas of woodland are located to the south, east and west
of the Site. Areas of the National Grid Compound with associated
roads and buildings are partially within and adjacent to the Project
Site boundary.
A water treatment works is located in the north
west outside of the Project Site boundary.
Previous Surveys
undertaken by BSG
Ecology
The client provided AECOM with the reports of previous surveys
undertaken in 2014 by BSG Ecology within the Site (ES Appendix
8.16).  The red line boundary included within these reports is
different to the 2017 Project Site boundary.
It was noted that the 2017 Project Site boundary is smaller than
the red line boundary used by BSG Ecology in 2014.  However,
the current Project Site boundary is within the same area as the
2014 red line boundary provided to BSG Ecology and therefore
the surveys undertaken would have captured the current Project
Site area.
The 2014 BSG Ecology Breeding Bird Survey Report identified 30
species of birds breeding within the Project Site and an additional
23 species using the Project Site or flying over. The surveys were

Breeding Bird Survey Results
1.6.2
A breeding bird survey was conducted at the Project Site on two occasions during
May and June 2017. The results are summarised in Table 1.3. Birds were
considered to be confirmed breeding if either direct evidence of nesting was found
(active nest or adult bird carrying food or faecal pellet) or if males were observed
displaying territorial behaviour (singing, calling or aggression) in suitable habitat for
breeding on each visit. An assemblage of common birds typical of the habitats on
Project Site was recorded. No Annex 1 or Schedule 1 birds were recorded.
1.6.3
Out of a total of 45 species recorded only swift was definitely not breeding within
the Project Site boundary. Twelve species listed on Section 7 were recorded all of
which may have been breeding within the Project Site boundary or immediate
surrounds: bullfinch, cuckoo, dunnock, house sparrow, lapwing, lesser redpoll,
linnet, reed bunting, skylark, song thrush, starling and tree pipit.  Ten species are
also listed on the BoCC Red list: cuckoo, house sparrow, lapwing, lesser redpoll,
linnet, mistle thrush, skylark, song thrush, starling and tree pipit. Eight further
species were recorded which are listed on the BoCC Amber List: bullfinch,
dunnock, meadow pipit, redstart, reed bunting, swift, tawny owl and willow warbler.

Conclusions
1.7.1
The Site supports a varied assemblage of breeding birds typical of the size, habitat
types and regional location. The surveys undertaken in both 2014 and 2017
produced very similar results which is unsurprising considering that the habitats
and management practices have changed little between the two surveys.
1.8
Preliminary Recommendations
a)
Recommendations for Further Surveys
1.8.1
A full assessment of required further surveys has been made during EcIA and
reported in the ES.
At this stage it is anticipated that further surveys should be
undertaken in early 2018 in order to fully assess the assemblage of species using
the Project Site earlier in the season.
b) Recommendations for Mitigation
1.8.2
A full series of recommendations for further surveys and mitigation at construction
and operation has been undertaken for the EcIA.
Mitigation should focus on
avoiding removal of habitat within the bird breeding season of March – August
inclusive and to ensure that replacement landscape planting seeks to provide
alternative habitat for those species present.

c) Recommendations for Biodiversity Enhancement
1.8.3
A full series of recommendations for biodiversity enhancement has been made
during the EcIA and reported in the ES. At this stage the following preliminary
recommendations have been made for general biodiversity enhancements:
·
Provide nesting boxes in woodland and buildings for a range of species
including house sparrow, starling and tawny owl; and,
·
Improve the availability of breeding and foraging habitat within the Project Site
by planting new scrub, hedgerows, and infilling current gaps in hedgerows with
whips and creating green corridors. It is recommended to use native species.
