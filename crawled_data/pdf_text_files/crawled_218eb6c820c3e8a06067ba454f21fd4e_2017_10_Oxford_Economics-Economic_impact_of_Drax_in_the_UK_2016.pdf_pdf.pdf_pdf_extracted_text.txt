EXECUTIVE SUMMARY 
Drax Group plc is a large British energy company. It has three principal 
activities: generating electricity, providing electricity, gas and energy services to 
businesses, and processing compressed wood pellets for use in electricity 
production. 
Drax Power Station is the largest power station in the UK, a nationally 
significant energy asset, supplying enough electricity for six million 
homes. In recent years, half of the power station has been converted to use 
compressed wood pellets instead of coal. In doing so, it has become the 
country’s single largest source of renewable power, generating 16 percent of 
Great Britain’s renewable electricity in 2016. 
Haven Power and Opus Energy, both part of the Drax Group, are leading 
retail companies that together supply energy to over 340,000 British 
business meters. Along with Billington Bioenergy, a supplier of wood pellets 
for renewable heat, these companies work closely with their customers to help 
them use energy sustainably and more efficiently.  
Through generating and selling energy, Drax Group supports a 
significant volume of employment and economic activity across the UK. 
This report quantifies Drax Group’s economic contribution in 2016 by analysing 
the direct, indirect and induced impact of the Group’s operations. 
In total, Drax Group’s operations contributed nearly £1.7 billion to UK 
GDP in 2016. This figure includes the value created by the Group’s production 
and supply of wholesale energy, the activity across the Group’s supply chain 
that is attributable to its demand for inputs, and the wages that its staff (and 
suppliers’ staff) spend in the wider consumer economy. 
One-quarter of this GDP impact, equivalent to £419 million, was generated 
in the Yorkshire and the Humber region, home of Drax Power Station. The 
Group also contributed a sizeable economic impact in the regions where Haven 
Power and Opus Energy are based. Their operations in Cardiff, Ipswich, 
Northampton and Oxford helped to generate a £633 million GDP impact (38 
percent of the Group’s total in 2016) across the East Midlands, East of 
England, South East and Wales. 
In addition to these contributions to economic output, 18,500 jobs across 
the UK were supported by Drax Group in 2016. One-third of this 
employment impact, equivalent to 6,000 jobs, was felt in the north of England, 
highlighting the Group’s importance to employment across the region.

1. INTRODUCTION 
Drax Group plc commissioned Oxford Economics to investigate its economic 
impact in the UK in 2016.1 This analysis is an update of research undertaken 
previously by Oxford Economics for Drax, published in September 2016, that 
quantified the Group’s economic impact during 2015. 
1.1 DRAX GROUP 
Drax Group is a large British energy company that is playing an important role 
in the UK’s transition towards a low-carbon future. In recent years, half of Drax 
Power Station—a nationally significant energy asset—has been converted to 
use sustainably-sourced wood pellets instead of coal. In doing so, it has 
become the single largest source of renewable power in the country, 
generating 16 percent of the UK’s total renewable electricity in 2016. 
In December 2016, Drax announced its new business strategy, focusing on 
providing greater flexibility to the country’s electricity grid to complement the 
rise in intermittent wind and solar generation. This flexibility will be provided 
through Drax Power Station and the construction of a number of new rapid-
response gas-fired power stations across the country. 
As part of this new strategy, Drax also completed its acquisition of Opus 
Energy in February 2017. Through this acquisition, Drax’s retail business will 
supply more British companies with gas and electricity and work with them to 
use energy more efficiently.2 
The Group’s three principal activities are generating electricity; supplying 
energy and energy services to businesses; and making compressed wood 
pellets for use in electricity production. Drax has several businesses working 
across the energy sector in the UK, that are considered in this report. We 
present results broken down into the following entities: 
• 
Drax Power, Drax’s generation business that owns and operates Drax 
Power Station in North Yorkshire. In our analysis, the activities of the 
Group’s head office are included within this entity; 
• 
Haven Power, a leading supplier of energy to industrial and 
commercial users; 
• 
Opus Energy, one of the largest suppliers of energy to small and 
medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) in the UK; 
• 
Billington Bioenergy, which supplies wood pellets to homes and non-
domestic users who use bioenergy for renewable heat.  
Drax employs over 2,000 people across offices in Cardiff, Ipswich, Liverpool, 
London, Oxford, Northampton and Selby.  
                                                      
1 The economic impact of Drax Biomass Inc., Drax’s subsidiary based in the United States, falls outside the remit 
of this study. 
2 This analysis includes an assessment of Opus Energy’s economic impact during 2016, despite its acquisition by 
Drax Group not being completed until 2017.

1.2 METHODOLOGICAL OUTLINE 
Oxford Economics assessed the economic benefits of Drax Group using a 
standard means of analysis, called an economic impact assessment. Three 
‘core’ channels of impact are considered: termed the direct, indirect and 
induced impact. These can be understood as follows: 
• 
Its direct impact relates to the Group’s own activities, such as the 
GDP it generates and its direct employment. When assessing the 
impact of investment (as in the latter two areas of the study) the direct 
impact describes the output and jobs supported among firms directly 
contracted to deliver the investment programmes. This includes 
construction, as well as the businesses providing other inputs such as 
manufactured goods, transportation and technical services; 
• 
Its indirect impact encapsulates the activity and employment 
supported in the Group’s, or contractors’ supply chains as a result of 
their procurement of goods and services; and, 
• 
Its induced impact, comprising the wider economic benefits that arise 
when employees within the Group and contractors, and their supply 
chain spend their earnings, for example in local retail and leisure 
establishments. 
Fig. 1.  The channels of Drax Group’s economic impact 
 
These economic impacts can be measured in one of three ways: 
• 
GDP, or more specifically, the Group’s gross value added (GVA) 
contribution to GDP; 
• 
Employment meaning the number of people employed, measured on a 
headcount basis; and, 
• 
Tax revenue, the estimated fiscal contribution resulting from corporate 
activity and employment sustained by the Group. 
The calculations undertaken to quantify these impacts draw upon data supplied 
by Drax Group. The modelling is conducted using an Input-Output (I-O) based 
model of the UK economy, and regional modules describing the economies of 
its constituent nations and regions. This model was constructed by Oxford 
Economics, using macroeconomic, employment and tax data published by the 
Office for National Statistics (ONS) and HMRC.

2. RESULTS 
2.1 DIRECT IMPACT 
The entities comprising Drax Group contributed £301 million to UK GDP 
during 2016. This is equivalent to the sum of the gross profits it earned, and the 
gross wages paid to its workers, and represents a rise of 6.1 percent relative to 
2015.  
The Group also employed some 2,011 workers in 2016, measured as the 
average of monthly employment levels during the year. 
Fig. 1: Direct impact of Drax Group, by entity, 2016 
 
In addition to these GVA and employment contributions, the Group directly 
generated around £93 million in tax revenues.  
This total is made up of Corporation Tax and business rates paid by the Group, 
and product-specific taxes (such as carbon costs and Waste Levy) levied on 
the Group’s activities. Also included are the labour taxes of its direct workforce, 
such as income tax, and employers’ and employees’ National Insurance 
Contributions (NICs).  
2.2 INDIRECT IMPACT 
The Group’s indirect impact on the UK economy is driven by its procurement of 
goods and services from other domestic businesses. In order to avert double-
counting, this indirect impact excludes the spending between the various 
entities of Drax Group. The economic benefits of this spending are already 
captured within the direct impact, discussed above. 
Drax Group’s external spending reached £872 million in 2016. Fig. 2 below 
sets out the industries across which this external procurement was distributed.

Fig. 2: Group external procurement in the UK, by sector, 2016 
 
In order to meet the intermediate demands of Drax Group, these businesses 
make purchases from their own suppliers, and so on down the supply chain. 
The sum of all these supply chain interactions produces the indirect impact, 
that ripples out across the regions and nations of the UK.  
The Group’s indirect impact supported £908 million in GVA during 2016, 
while supporting over 10,300 jobs throughout the UK. The Group’s very 
large jobs contribution (relative to its own direct employment) reflects the 
capital-intensive nature of its activities: power generation involves spending 
vast sums with industries that have relatively more labour-intensive 
characteristics. 
The Group’s indirect GVA impact in 2016 is estimated to be around 40 percent 
larger than it was in 2015, while its indirect employment impact rose by around 
a third (34 percent) year-on-year. These increases are primarily driven by the 
addition of Opus Energy to the Group. Fig. 3 below sets out the geographic 
distribution of the indirect GVA and employment impacts. 
In addition, an estimated £234 million in tax revenues were indirectly 
generated by the Group in 2016. This figure is made up of the taxes on 
profits, purchases and wages that are attributable to Drax Group’s domestic 
supply chain activity.

2.3 INDUCED IMPACT 
Drax Group paid £114 million in gross employee compensation during 
2016. This figure encompasses wages and salaries, pensions contributions, 
share-based payments and compensation costs (where relevant).  
This remuneration supported household consumption across all regions of the 
UK, as shown in Fig. 4 below. The following analysis rests upon the simplifying 
assumption that salary income is spent in the region where the recipient 
employee is resident.  
Fig. 4: Wages and salaries paid by Drax Group, by region of employee 
residence, 2016 
 
A portion of these salaries are spent in the consumer economy, for example in 
retail and leisure outlets. In addition, the wages paid to employees of firms 
within Drax Group’s supply chains also support further consumption spending. 
Further, in order to meet this induced demand, retail and leisure businesses 
draw upon their supply chains, producing a further supply-chain effect that is 
also a part of Drax Group’s induced impact. These factors explain why the 
Group’s induced impact is much broader (in geographic terms) than the 
distribution of its direct wage payments.  
We estimate that Drax Group’s induced GVA impact reached £464 million 
in 2016. Its induced impact also supported 6,100 jobs across all nations and 
regions of the UK, as illustrated in Fig. 5 below.  
This induced activity was also associated with tax revenues of £135 
million. This sum encompasses all the taxes on profits, wages and 
procurement discussed previously; while also including the VAT accrued as a 
result of Drax Group’s induced consumption impact.

2.4 TOTAL IMPACT 
By adding the three channels discussed above, we arrive at our estimates for 
the total impact of Drax Group’s activities during 2016. This can be considered 
the Group’s ‘footprint’ on the UK economy in that year.   
Fig. 6: Total impact of Drax Group, by entity, 2016 
 
We estimate that Drax Group’s activities generated around £1.7 billion in 
GVA during 2016, whilst supporting around 18,500 jobs. In doing so, the 
Group supported an estimated £462 million in revenues for the Exchequer.
