Dear Shareholder,
Annual General Meeting (AGM) 
I am pleased to enclose the Notice of the AGM of Drax Group plc (the Company or Drax), which will be held at 11.30am on Wednesday 
22 April 2020 at Grocers’ Hall, Princes Street, London EC2R 8AD. The Notice of the AGM is set out in Part B on pages 3 and 4.
Your vote is important to us and, if you are unable to attend the meeting, we would encourage you to vote either by submitting your 
enclosed proxy form or electronically as explained on pages 10 to 13.
Explanatory notes
The explanatory notes to the Resolutions set out in the Notice of the AGM are in Part C on pages 6 to 9. There will also be an 
opportunity for shareholders to ask questions at the meeting, appropriate to the business of the AGM.
Annual Report and Accounts
A copy of the Company’s Annual Report and Accounts for the year ended 31 December 2019 is now available on our website at 
www.drax.com. Our website is the principal means by which we communicate with our shareholders. As well as the Annual Report 
and Accounts, you can find further information including the latest news, press releases, investor presentations and dividend history. 
You can sign up for news alerts about Drax on our website www.drax.com, by selecting ‘Subscribe’.
If you have requested to receive a hard copy of the Annual Report and Accounts, this is enclosed. If you no longer wish to receive  
a hard copy, and instead wish to receive communications electronically, please contact our registrars, Equiniti, on 0371 384 2030 
from within the UK or +44 121 415 7047 from outside the UK. 
Proposed new Directors’ Remuneration Policy (Policy)
The Policy sets out the Company’s forward-looking policy on Directors’ remuneration and is subject to a binding shareholder vote 
by ordinary resolution at least once every three years. Drax has continued to evolve since the last full review of the Directors’ 
Remuneration Policy in 2017. The Group has a broader position in the energy market following the biomass conversion programme 
and the acquisitions in the Customers business and, more recently, in Generation. 
To ensure that our approach to remuneration supports the strategy, in 2019 the Remuneration Committee undertook a full review 
of the existing policy, taking into account the Group’s strategy, shareholder feedback and the new provisions in the Corporate 
Governance Code. Our principal aims are to ensure that executive pay is closely linked to Group performance, underpins our 
purpose of enabling a zero carbon, lower cost energy future, and better aligns reward with delivering the strategy.
Following this review, we are inviting you to approve our proposed new Policy this year, further details of which can be found on 
pages 91 to 102 of the Annual Report and Accounts.

Resolution 1
To receive and adopt the Company’s Annual Report and 
Accounts
The directors are required to present to the meeting the Annual 
Report and Accounts for the financial year ended 31 December 
2019. This includes (i) the audited accounts; (ii) the Directors’ 
report; (iii) the strategic report; and (iv) the report of the auditor 
of the Company on the audited accounts and the auditable part 
of the Directors’ Remuneration Report. A separate resolution 
seeks approval by the shareholders of the Directors’ 
Remuneration Report, which vote is advisory in nature.
Resolution 2
Directors’ Remuneration Report
Resolution 2 seeks shareholder approval for the annual 
statement to shareholders by the Chair of the Remuneration 
Committee and the Annual Report on Remuneration which can 
be found on pages 86 to 114 of the Annual Report and Accounts. 
The Annual Report on Remuneration gives details of the 
implementation of the Company’s existing Directors’ 
Remuneration Policy in terms of the payments and share awards 
made to the Directors in connection with their performance and 
that of the Company during the year ended 31 December 2019. 
This vote is advisory and will not affect the way in which the 
Directors’ Remuneration Policy has been implemented.
The Company’s auditor during the year, Deloitte LLP, has audited 
those parts of the Directors’ Remuneration Report that are 
required to be audited and their report may be found on pages 
121 to 128 of the Annual Report and Accounts.
Resolution 3
Directors’ Remuneration Policy
Resolution 3 seeks shareholder approval for the Directors’ 
Remuneration Policy. 
The Remuneration Committee believes that the proposed 
changes strengthen the alignment of executive remuneration 
with delivery of the business strategy and shareholder value. 
A summary of the key changes to the Policy are highlighted 
below. For further information on the proposed Policy, please 
see pages 91 to 102 of the Annual Report and Accounts.
Element 
Change
Rationale
Salary
No proposed changes to existing approach.
N/A
Pension
The incumbent Executive Directors have voluntarily agreed 
to a reduction in their pension contributions to align with 
the contribution of new joiners to the wider workforce 
(currently 10% of salary) from 1 January 2023.
Pension contributions for new Executive Directors will be 
aligned with those available to other new joiners in the wider 
workforce on appointment.
Alignment of pensions with the wider workforce is in line 
with the provisions of the UK Corporate Governance Code 
(the Code). 
Annual Bonus
The maximum bonus opportunity for the Group CEO will 
increase from 150% to 175% of salary and for other Executive 
Directors from 140% to 150% of salary.
Split between:
1. Financial element (105% of salary for Group CEO, 90% of 
salary for other Executive Directors) – performance based on 
a smaller number of financial and operational metrics, paid in 
cash; and
2. Strategic element (70% of salary for Group CEO, 60% of 
salary for other Executive Directors) – performance based on 
a smaller number of strategic and other non-financial metrics, 
paid in shares. 
At least 40% of the bonus will be deferred into shares 
(currently 35%), vesting after three years and subject to a 
two-year holding period. If 40% deferral is not attained by the 
strategic element, a proportion of the financial element will 
be deferred into shares in order to achieve this minimum level 
of deferral.
The proposed structure simplifies the bonus plan by 
reducing the number of performance metrics. Splitting 
the bonus into a financial cash element and a strategic 
deferred shares element responds to shareholder 
concerns on the existing structure and clarifies the  
role each component plays in supporting the business 
strategy, whilst also providing a deferral in shares  
which contributes to a philosophy of driving long-term 
performance and growth in returns to shareholders.
The maximum annual bonus opportunity will increase  
by 25% of salary for the Group CEO and by 10% for other 
Executive Directors to reflect the increased level of 
deferral, as well as the longer vesting and holding period 
applicable to this deferred element. For example, the level 
of maximum deferral for the Group CEO has increased 
from 52.5% of salary under the current Policy to 75% of 
salary under the proposed Policy, and therefore the vast 
majority (22.5% of salary) of the increase in maximum 
opportunity is delivered in shares which are subject to  
a five year combined vesting and holding period. The 
maximum cash bonus is broadly unchanged. This change 
places a greater emphasis on alignment with long-term 
shareholder value.
Malus and clawback provisions are in line with corporate 
governance best practice.
Part C 
Explanatory notes to the Notice of the AGM
6
Drax Group plc Notice of Annual General Meeting 2020
Element 
Change
Rationale
LTIP
The maximum opportunity to be increased from 175% to 200% 
of salary for the Group CEO only. The maximum opportunity 
for other Executive Directors will remain at 175% of salary.
The Group Scorecard element is removed from the LTIP.
Performance will be measured against the following metrics:
1. Cumulative Adjusted EPS* – 50% weighting
2. Relative TSR (FTSE 350) – 50% weighting
The two-year post vesting holding period will be retained.
*Details of the EPS target for the proposed grants in 2020 
will be notified to shareholders via RNS in March 2020, 
ahead of the 2020 AGM, and will be applicable in the event 
that the new Policy is approved by shareholders.
The increase in the Group CEO’s opportunity ensures  
that where Group performance is strong then total 
remuneration levels will be competitive against the market.
At the 2017 Policy review, some shareholders expressed 
concern at the use of the Group Scorecard in both the 
annual bonus and LTIP. We have responded to that 
feedback. The proposed structure removes this 
duplication, replacing the current 50% weighting on  
the Group Scorecard with Cumulative Adjusted EPS.  
This aligns with the general shareholder preference  
for financial-only metrics on long-term incentives.
Introducing a Cumulative Adjusted EPS measure with 
50% weighting ensures Executive Directors are focused 
on driving earnings performance of the business, which  
is a major factor in delivering value to shareholders. The 
Committee is confident that the introduction of this 
metric provides a greater link between reward outcomes 
and the shareholder experience over the longer term.
Shareholding 
requirement 
The shareholding requirement for the Group CEO will 
increase from 200% to 250% of salary, and will be 200% for 
the other Executive Directors. A post-cessation shareholding 
requirement, equal to the in employment shareholding 
requirement (or the shareholding on departure if lower) will 
be introduced for Executive Directors and will apply for two 
years after cessation of employment.
Increased shareholding requirement for the Group CEO 
achieves greater alignment with shareholders.
Ensures that Executive Directors’ interests remain aligned 
with shareholders to implement a strategy which delivers 
value for the longer term beyond their departure, in line 
with the requirements of the Code. It also facilitates 
implementation of clawback.
If resolution 3 is approved, the Directors’ Remuneration Policy 
will be effectively immediately following the 2020 AGM. If 
shareholders do not approve the revised Remuneration Policy 
for any reason, the Company will continue to make payments  
to Directors and former Directors (in their capacity as Directors) 
under the existing Directors’ Remuneration Policy approved  
on the 25 April 2018 and will seek shareholder approval for a 
revised policy at the 2021 AGM.
Resolution 4
To approve the final dividend
Resolution 4 seeks shareholder approval to pay the final 
dividend of 9.5 pence per ordinary share, which is recommended 
by the Directors for payment to those shareholders who are on 
the register of members of the Company at 4.30pm on 24 April 
2020. If approved by shareholders at the AGM, the final dividend 
will be paid on 15 May 2020.
Resolutions 5 to 12
To elect and re-elect the directors
In accordance with the recommendations of the UK Corporate 
Governance Code, each of the Directors will retire and offer 
themselves for re-election by shareholders. 
John Baxter, who was appointed to the Board following the 
2019 AGM on 17 April 2019, will offer himself for election by 
shareholders.
The skills and experience for each of the Directors are set out  
in Part F of this Notice (and on pages 64 to 65 of the Annual 
Report and Accounts).
The Board has determined that, in its judgement, all of the 
Non-Executive Directors being proposed for election or 
re-election are independent in character and judgement, and 
there are no relationships or circumstances which are likely  
to affect, or could appear to affect, their judgement.
During the year, the Board completed an externally-led 
evaluation of its performance and individual Directors. 
Following that evaluation, the Chair is satisfied that the 
performance of each Director standing for election or re-
election continues to be effective and that each Director 
continues to demonstrate commitment to the role. A separate 
assessment of the performance of the Chair was conducted, led 
by the Senior Independent Director, which concluded that the 
performance of the Chair continues to be effective, and the 
Chair continues to demonstrate commitment to the role and 
has the time required to devote to the performance of the 
function of Chair. More information about this can be found  
on page 74 of the Annual Report and Accounts.

Drax Group plc Notice of Annual General Meeting 2020
Resolutions 13 and 14
Reappointment of auditor and determination of their 
remuneration
The Company must appoint or re-appoint an auditor at every 
general meeting at which accounts are presented and it is 
normal practice for the Company’s Directors, acting through the 
Audit Committee, to be authorised to determine the auditor’s 
remuneration. Deloitte LLP has advised its willingness to 
continue in office as auditor of the Company.
Resolution 15
Political donations and expenditure
Part 14 of the Companies Act 2006 (the Act) contains 
restrictions on companies making political donations or 
incurring political expenditure. 
Drax is a politically neutral organisation and did not make any 
political donations in 2019. 
It is not the policy of the Company to make donations to political 
parties, and the Directors have no intention of changing that 
policy. However, the Act defines political donations and political 
expenditure terms very widely. This means that activities that 
form part of the normal relationship between the Company  
and bodies concerned with policy review, law reform and other 
business matters affecting the Company, which might not be 
thought to be political expenditure in the usual sense, could 
require shareholders’ consent under the Act. 
In view of the broad wording adopted in the Act, and the Board’s 
wish to avoid any inadvertent infringement of it, it is seeking 
shareholders’ consent for the Company, and any wholly owned 
subsidiary company, to incur total annual expenditure for such 
purposes, in order that the Company may continue to engage 
with regulators and policymakers without inadvertently 
breaching the applicable legislation. Further information on 
how the Company engaged with political parties in 2019 can be 
found on pages 27 and 117 of our Annual Report and Accounts. 
At the 2019 AGM there were significant votes against the 
resolution to make political donations. In response to this, and 
after consulting with our larger shareholders, we published our 
Political Engagement Policy, which is available on our website at 
www.drax.com. 
We will also be reducing the aggregate limit from £300,000  
to £125,000 in the 12-month period ending on the anniversary  
of the conclusion of the AGM. This authority will not be used  
to make political donations as they are normally understood, 
including contributions towards any general political party 
expenses or in connection with general election campaigns. 
It is the intention that the Company will seek to renew this 
authority, if appropriate, at each subsequent AGM. 
Further information on our stakeholder engagement relating  
to political donations can be found on page 27 of our Annual 
Report and Accounts.
Resolution 16
Authority of directors to allot shares
The authority given to the Directors to allot further shares in  
the capital of the Company requires the prior authorisation  
of the shareholders in general meeting under Section 551 CA 
2006. Upon the passing of Resolution 16 the Directors will have 
authority (pursuant to paragraph (a) of the Resolution) to allot 
shares up to an aggregate nominal value of £15,805,697, which 
is approximately one-third of the issued ordinary share capital 
as at 6 March 2020 (being the latest practicable date before the 
publication of this Notice). This authority will expire immediately 
following the AGM in 2021 or on 30 June 2021, whichever is  
the earlier.
In addition, in accordance with the Investment Association 
Share Capital Management Guidelines (which set out the 
expectations of institutional investors in relation to, among 
other things, the authority of directors to allot shares), upon  
the passing of Resolution 16, the Directors will have authority 
(pursuant to paragraph (b) of the Resolution) to allot ordinary 
shares in connection with a rights issue in favour of ordinary 
shareholders up to a maximum nominal value of £31,611,394,  
as reduced by the nominal amount of any shares issued under 
paragraph (a) of Resolution 16.
This amount (before any reduction) represents approximately 
two-thirds of the Company’s issued ordinary share capital as  
at 6 March 2020 (being the latest practicable date before  
the publication of this Notice). This authority will also expire 
immediately following the next AGM or on 30 June 2021, 
whichever is the earlier. As a result, if Resolution 16 is passed, 
the directors could allot shares representing up to two-thirds  
of the Company’s current issued share capital pursuant to a 
rights issue.
The Directors will continue to seek to renew these authorities  
at each AGM, in accordance with current best practice from 
time to time. The Directors have no current plans to exercise 
this authority except in connection with employee share plans.
As at 6 March 2020, being the latest practicable date before 
publication of this Notice, the Company held 13,841,295 equity 
securities in treasury.

Drax Group plc Notice of Annual General Meeting 2020
Resolution 17
Disapplication of pre-emption rights
If the Directors wish to exercise the authority under Resolution 
16 and offer shares (or sell any shares which the Company may 
purchase and elect to hold as treasury shares) for cash, the CA 
2006 requires that, unless shareholders have given specific 
authority for the waiver of their statutory pre-emption rights, 
the new shares must be offered first to existing shareholders  
in proportion to their existing shareholdings. In certain 
circumstances, it may be in the best interests of the Company 
to allot new shares (or to grant rights over shares) for cash 
without first offering them to existing shareholders in 
proportion to their holdings.
Resolution 17 would authorise the Directors to do this by 
allowing the Directors to allot shares for cash (i) by way of a 
rights issue (subject to certain exclusions), (ii) by way of an open 
offer or other offer of securities (not being a rights issue) in 
favour of existing shareholders in proportion (as nearly as may 
be) to their shareholdings (subject to certain exclusions) and (iii) 
otherwise than under (i) or (ii), up to an aggregate nominal value 
of £2,370,855 which is equivalent to approximately 5% of the 
issued ordinary share capital of the Company on 6 March 2020 
(being the latest practicable date prior to the publication of this 
Notice). The Resolution also applies to the sale and re-issue of 
ordinary shares held as treasury shares by the Company. 
If approved by the shareholders, the authority contained in 
Resolution 17 will expire on the earlier of the conclusion of the 
next AGM or on 30 June 2021. The Directors intend to renew 
such power at successive AGMs in accordance with current 
best practice.
The Directors have no current plans to exercise this authority 
except in connection with employee share plans (but they 
consider its approval to be appropriate in order to preserve 
maximum flexibility for the future).
In addition, and in line with best practice, the Company has not 
issued more than 7.5% of its issued share capital on a non-pre-
emptive basis over the last three years. In accordance with  
the Pre-Emption Group’s Statement of Principles regarding 
cumulative usage of authorities, the Directors do not intend  
to issue more than 7.5% of the issued ordinary share capital of 
the Company (excluding treasury shares) for cash on a non-
preemptive basis in any rolling three-year period without prior 
consultation with shareholders.
As at 6 March 2020, being the latest practicable date before  
the publication of this Notice, the Company held 13,841,295 
equity securities in treasury.
Resolution 18
To authorise the Company to purchase its own shares
Resolution 18 is to authorise the Company to buy back up to 
41,047,718 ordinary shares. The authority would expire at the 
conclusion of the 2021 AGM or, if earlier, on 30 June 2021. The 
directors intend to seek renewal of this power at subsequent 
AGMs in accordance with current best practice.
Resolution 18 specifies the maximum number of ordinary shares 
which may be purchased (representing 10% of the Company’s 
issued ordinary share capital as at 6 March 2020) and the 
maximum and minimum prices at which they may be bought, 
exclusive of expenses, reflecting the requirements of the CA 
2006 and the Listing Rules.
The Directors have no present intention of exercising this 
authority other than with a view for use in relation to the 
Company’s share plans or where it is appropriate to conduct 
buy backs to return value to shareholders. The granting of this 
authority should not be taken to imply that any ordinary shares 
will be purchased, other than in relation to the above. Except  
in relation to the above, no purchase of ordinary shares will be 
made unless it is expected that the effect will be to increase 
earnings per share and the Directors consider it to be in the  
best interests of shareholders. 
Under the CA 2006, the Company is allowed to hold its own 
shares in treasury following a buy back, instead of having to 
cancel them. This gives the Company the ability to re-issue 
treasury shares quickly and cost-effectively (including pursuant 
to the authority under Resolution 16 above) and provides the 
Company with additional flexibility in the management of its 
capital base.
Such shares may be re-sold for cash but all rights attaching to 
them, including voting rights and any right to receive dividends, 
are suspended whilst they are held in treasury. If the Directors 
exercise the authority conferred by Resolution 18, the Company 
will have the option of either holding in treasury or of cancelling 
any of its own shares purchased pursuant to this authority and 
will decide at the time of purchase which option to pursue.
The total number of options to subscribe for, and awards over, 
shares, outstanding at 6 March 2020, being the last practicable 
date before the publication of this Notice was 7,925,293. This 
represents approximately 1.93% of the issued share capital at 
that date. If the Company was to buy back the maximum 
number of ordinary shares permitted pursuant to this 
Resolution then the total number of options to subscribe for 
ordinary shares, outstanding at 6 March 2020, would represent 
approximately 2.15% of the reduced share capital.
 
Explanatory notes to the Notice of the AGM continued

Drax Group plc Notice of Annual General Meeting 2020
Resolution 19
To approve the new 2020 Long Term Incentive Plan (LTIP) 
Resolution 19 seeks shareholder approval for the LTIP. The 
principal terms of the LTIP are summarised in the appendix  
to this Notice of AGM.
If approved, the LTIP will replace the current Peformance Share 
Plan and will be the long-term incentive plan under which it  
is intended that awards of shares will be made annually to 
Executive Directors and selected senior executives. 
The maximum value of shares that can be awarded to a 
participant in any financial year is 200% of the individual’s 
salary, or in exceptional circumstances on recruitment 300%.  
As explained in the notes to Resolution 3, on page 6, the 
performance metrics will be relative TSR (FTSE-350) and 
Cumulative Adjusted EPS. 
The Remuneration Committee believes that this combination 
will provide a greater link between reward outcomes and the 
shareholder value over the longer term. A two–year holding 
period will continue to apply to vested awards granted to 
Executive Directors under the LTIP.
Resolution 20
To allow general meetings to be held on 14 clear days’ notice  
in certain circumstances
Resolution 20 is a resolution to allow the Company to hold 
general meetings (other than AGMs) on 14 clear days’ notice. 
The Shareholders’ Rights Regulations state that the notice 
period required for general meetings of the Company is 21 days, 
unless shareholders approve a shorter notice period, which 
cannot, however, be less than 14 clear days. AGMs will continue 
to be held on at least 21 clear days’ notice.
In order to preserve the Company’s ability to call general 
meetings (other than an AGM) on 14 clear days’ notice, 
Resolution 20 seeks such approval. The shorter notice period 
would not be used as a matter of routine for such meetings,  
but only where the flexibility is merited by the business of the 
meeting and is thought to be to the advantage of shareholders 
as a whole.
The CA 2006 requires that, in order to be able to call a general 
meeting on less than 21 clear days’ notice, the Company must 
make a means of electronic voting available to all shareholders 
for that meeting. The Company provides this facility (see 
paragraph 10 of Part D on page 11 of this document for the 
Company’s arrangements for electronic proxy appointments).

Part D 
Administrative notes relating to the AGM 
Entitlement to attend and vote
1. Pursuant to regulation 41 of the Uncertificated Securities 
Regulations 2001 (as amended) and for the purposes of 
Section 360B CA 2006, the Company specifies that only 
those shareholders registered on the register of members at 
6.30pm on the day two business days before the date of the 
meeting (the Specified Time) (or if the meeting is adjourned 
to a time more than 48 hours after the Specified Time, by 
6.30pm on the day which is two business days prior to the 
time of the adjourned meeting) shall be entitled to attend 
and vote thereat in respect of the number of shares 
registered in their name at that time. If the meeting is 
adjourned to a time not more than 48 hours after the 
Specified Time, that time will also apply for the purposes of 
determining the entitlement of members to attend and vote 
(and for the purposes of determining the number of votes 
they may cast) at the adjourned meeting. Changes to the 
Register after the relevant deadline shall be disregarded  
in determining rights to attend and vote.
2. If you have sold or transferred all your shares, this booklet 
and any accompanying documents (but not the personalised 
Form of Proxy or Form of Direction) should be passed to  
the person through whom the sale or transfer was made  
for transmission to the purchaser or transferee.
Appointment of proxies
3. If you are a member of the Company, at the time set out in 
note 1 above, you are entitled to appoint one or more proxies 
to exercise all or any of your rights to attend, speak and vote 
at the meeting. Completion and return of a Form of Proxy 
will not prevent a member from attending in person and 
voting at the meeting. If a member appoints more than one 
proxy to attend the meeting, each proxy must be appointed 
to exercise the rights attached to a different share or shares 
held by that member.
 
If a member wishes to appoint more than one proxy and so 
requires additional proxy forms, the member should contact 
the Company’s Registrars, Equiniti Limited, at Aspect House, 
Spencer Road, Lancing, West Sussex BN99 6DA or by using 
their telephone helpline service on 0371 384 2030 from 
within the UK or +44 121 415 7047 from outside the UK. 
Lines are open from 8.30am to 5.30pm, Monday to Friday 
– excluding public holidays in England and Wales.
4. A proxy does not need to be a shareholder of the Company 
but must attend the meeting for the member’s vote to be 
counted. Your proxy could be the Chair, another director of 
the Company or another person who has agreed to attend 
to represent you. Details of how to appoint the Chair or 
another person (or persons) as your proxy using the Form  
of Proxy are set out in the notes to the Form of Proxy. 
Appointing a proxy does not preclude you from attending 
the meeting and voting in person.
5. You can only appoint a proxy using the procedures set out  
in these notes and the notes on the Form of Proxy. A Form  
of Proxy is enclosed. To be effective, the Form of Proxy must 
be completed and signed and, together with the power of 
attorney or authority, if any, under which it is signed (or a 
duly certified copy of any such power or authority) must  
be lodged with the Company’s Registrars not later than 48 
hours, excluding non-business days, before the time of the 
meeting or must be lodged using the CREST proxy voting 
services (see note 7 below). Return of a completed Form of 
Proxy will not preclude a member from attending and voting 
personally at the meeting.
6. In the case of joint holders, where more than one of the joint 
holders purports to appoint a proxy, only the appointment 
submitted by the most senior holder will be accepted. 
Seniority is determined by the order in which the names of 
the joint holders appear in the Register in respect of the joint 
holding (the first-named being deemed the most senior).
7. CREST members who wish to appoint a proxy or proxies by 
utilising the CREST electronic proxy appointment service 
may do so for the meeting and any adjournment(s) thereof 
utilising the procedures described in the CREST Manual 
(available via www.euroclear.com). CREST personal 
members or other CREST sponsored members, and those 
CREST members who have appointed a voting service 
provider(s), should refer to their CREST sponsor or voting 
service provider(s), who will be able  
to take the appropriate action on their behalf. In order for  
a proxy appointment or instruction made using the CREST 
service to be valid, the appropriate CREST message (a 
CREST Proxy Instruction) must be properly authenticated  
in accordance with Euroclear UK & Ireland Limited’s 
specifications and must contain the information required 
for such instructions, as described in the CREST Manual.
11
Drax Group plc Notice of Annual General Meeting 2020
 
The message, regardless of whether it constitutes the 
appointment of a proxy or an amendment to the instruction 
given to a previously appointed proxy must, in order to be 
valid, be transmitted so as to be received by the issuer’s 
agent (Equiniti Limited CREST participant ID RA19) by the 
latest time(s) for receipt of proxy appointments specified  
in note 5 above. For this purpose the time of receipt will be 
taken to be the time (as determined by the timestamp 
applied to the message by the CREST applications Host) 
from which the issuer’s agent is able to retrieve the message 
by enquiry to CREST in the manner prescribed by CREST. 
After this time any change of instructions to proxies 
appointed through CREST should be communicated to the 
appointee through other means. CREST members and, 
where applicable, their CREST sponsors or voting service 
providers should note that Euroclear UK & Ireland Limited 
does not make available special procedures in CREST for any 
particular messages. Normal system timings and limitations 
will therefore apply in relation to the input of CREST Proxy 
Instructions. It is the responsibility of the CREST member 
concerned to take (or, if the CREST member is a CREST 
personal member or sponsored member or has appointed a 
voting service provider(s), to procure that his or her CREST 
sponsor or voting service provider(s) take(s)) such action as 
shall be necessary to ensure that a message is transmitted 
by means of the CREST system by any particular time.
 
In this connection, CREST members and, where applicable, 
their CREST sponsors or voting service providers are 
referred, in particular, to those sections of the CREST 
Manual concerning practical limitations of the CREST 
system and timings www.euroclear.com.
 
The Company may treat as invalid a CREST proxy instruction 
in the circumstances set out in Regulation 35(5)(a) of the 
Uncertificated Securities Regulations 2001 (as amended).
8. A vote withheld is not a vote in law, which means that the 
vote will not be counted in the calculation of votes for or 
against the Resolution. If you either select the 
“discretionary” option or if no voting indication is given, your 
proxy will vote or abstain from voting at his or her discretion. 
Your proxy will vote (or abstain from voting) as he or she 
thinks fit in relation to any other matter which is put before 
the meeting.
9. If you are not a member of the Company but you have  
been nominated by a member of the Company to enjoy 
information rights, you do not have a right to appoint any 
proxies under the procedures set out in this “Appointment  
of proxies” section. Please read the section “Nominated 
persons” below.
Appointment of proxy electronically
10. Alternatively, members may register the appointment of  
a proxy for the meeting electronically by accessing the 
website www.sharevote.co.uk. You will need your Voting ID, 
Task ID and Shareholder Reference Number (this is the 
series of numbers printed on your Proxy Form). Alternatively, 
if you have already registered with Company’s Registrar’s 
online portfolio service, Shareview, you can submit your 
Proxy Form at www.shareview.co.uk using your usual user 
ID and password. Full instructions are given on both 
websites, which are operated by the Company’s Registrars.
 
The proxy appointment and any power of attorney or other 
authority under which the proxy appointment is made must 
be received by the Company’s Registrars not less than 48 
hours, excluding non-business days, before the time for 
holding the meeting or adjourned meeting or (in the case  
of a poll taken otherwise than at or on the same day as the 
meeting or adjourned meeting) for the taking of the poll  
at which it is to be used. Please note that any electronic 
communication sent to the Company or to the Company’s 
Registrars that is found to contain a computer virus will  
not be accepted. The use of the internet service  
in connection with the AGM is governed by the Company’s 
Registrars’ conditions of use set out on the Sharevote 
website, www.sharevote.co.uk, and may be read by logging 
on to that site. If you want to appoint more than one proxy 
electronically, please contact the Company’s Registrars  
on 0371 384 2030 from within the UK or +44 121 415 7047

Website giving information regarding the meeting
11. A copy of this Notice and other information required by 
Section 311A CA 2006 can be found on the Company’s 
website www.drax.com.
Changing proxy instructions
12.  To change your proxy instructions simply submit a new 
proxy appointment. You will need to request a new Form  
of Proxy from the Company’s Registrars, Equiniti Limited,  
by contacting them at Aspect House, Spencer Road, Lancing, 
West Sussex BN99 6DA or by using their telephone helpline 
service on 0371 384 2030 from within the UK or +44 121 415 
7047 from outside the UK. Lines are open from 8.30am to 
5.30pm, Monday to Friday – excluding public holidays in 
England and Wales. Note that the cut-off time for receipt  
of Forms of Proxy (see note 5 above) also applies in relation 
to amended instructions; any amended proxy appointment 
received after the relevant cut-off time will be disregarded 
and you will be required to vote at the meeting, if you wish 
to change your vote.
13. If you submit more than one valid proxy appointment in 
respect of a single share, the appointment received last 
before the latest time for the receipt of proxies will take 
precedence.

Drax Group plc Notice of Annual General Meeting 2020
Nominated persons
14. Any person receiving a copy of this Notice of Meeting as a 
person nominated by a member to enjoy information rights 
under Section 146 of the CA 2006 (CA 2006) (a Nominated 
Person) should note that the provisions in this Notice 
concerning the appointment of a proxy or proxies to attend 
the meeting in place of a member, do not apply to a 
Nominated Person as only shareholders have the right to 
appoint a proxy. However, a Nominated Person may have  
a right under an agreement between the Nominated Person 
and the member by whom he or she was nominated to be 
appointed, or to have someone else appointed, as a proxy  
for the meeting. If a Nominated Person has no such proxy 
appointment right, or does not wish to exercise it, he or  
she may have a right under such an agreement to give 
instructions to the member as to the exercise of voting 
rights at the meeting. If you are a person who has been 
nominated under Section 146 of CA 2006 to enjoy 
information rights:
• you may have a right under an agreement between you 
and the member of the Company who has nominated  
you to have information rights (Relevant Member) to be 
appointed or to have someone else appointed as a proxy 
for the meeting; and
• if you either do not have such a right or if you have such  
a right but do not wish to exercise it, you may have a right 
under an agreement between you and the Relevant 
Member to give instructions to the Relevant Member  
as to the exercise of voting rights. Nominated Persons 
should also remember that their main point of contact  
in terms of their investment in the Company remains the 
member who nominated the Nominated Person to enjoy 
information rights (or, perhaps the custodian or broker 
who administers the investment on their behalf). 
Nominated Persons should continue to contact that 
member, custodian or broker (and not the Company) 
regarding any changes or queries relating to the 
Nominated Person’s personal details and interest in the 
Company (including any administrative matter). The only 
exception to this is where the Company expressly 
requests a response from a Nominated Person.
Voting
15.  Voting on each of the Resolutions to be put to the AGM  
will be by poll, so that all shares voted are included, whether 
or not the shareholder is able to attend the meeting. The 
results of the voting at the meeting and the number of  
proxy votes cast for and against and the number of votes 
abstained in respect of each of the Resolutions proposed  
at the meeting will be announced to the London Stock 
Exchange as soon as practicable following the meeting  
and also will be published on the Company’s website  
www.drax.com.
Issued shares and total voting rights
16.  As at 6 March 2020, being the latest practicable date prior 
to the publication of this Notice, the Company’s issued share 
capital comprised 410,477,184 ordinary shares of 11 16/29 
pence each. Each ordinary share carries the right to one 
vote at a general meeting of the Company. The Company 
holds 13,841,295 shares in treasury, therefore the total 
number of voting rights in the Company is the 396,635,889.
17. This Notice, together with information about the total 
numbers of shares in the Company in respect of which 
members are entitled to exercise voting rights at the 
meeting as at 6 March 2020, being the latest practicable 
date prior to the publication of this Notice and, if applicable, 
any members’ statements, members’ resolutions or 
members’ matters of business received by the Company 
after the date of this Notice, will be available on the 
Company’s website www.drax.com.
Website publication of audit concerns
18. Under Section 527 CA 2006, members meeting the 
threshold requirements set out in that Section have the 
right to require the Company to publish on a website a 
statement setting out any matter relating to the audit of the 
Company’s accounts (including the auditor’s report and the 
conduct of the audit) that are to be laid before the meeting; 
or any circumstance connected with an auditor of the 
Company ceasing to hold office since the previous meeting 
at which annual accounts and reports were laid in 
accordance with Section 437 CA 2006.
 
The Company may not require the members requesting any 
such website publication to pay its expenses in complying 
with Sections 527 or 528 CA 2006. Where the Company is 
required to place a statement on a website under Section 
527 CA 2006, it must forward the statement to the 
Company’s auditor not later than the time when it makes the 
statement available on the website. The business which may 
be dealt with at the meeting includes any statement that 
the Company has been required under Section 527 CA 2006 
to publish on a website.

Corporate representatives
19. Any corporation which is a member can appoint one or more 
corporate representatives who may exercise on its behalf  
all of its powers as a member provided that it does not do  
so in relation to the same shares.
Questions at the meeting
20. Any member attending the meeting has the right to ask 
questions. The Company must cause to be answered any 
question relating to the business being dealt with at the 
meeting put by a member attending the meeting. However, 
members should note that no answer need be given in the 
following circumstances:
• if to do so would interfere unduly with the preparation of 
the meeting or would involve a disclosure of confidential 
information;
• if the answer has already been given on a website in the 
form of an answer to a question; or
• if it is undesirable in the interests of the Company or the 
good order of the meeting that the question be answered.
Electronic address
21. Any electronic address provided either in this Notice or  
in any related documents (including the Form of Proxy)  
may not be used to communicate with the Company for  
any purposes other than those expressly stated.

the AGM will start promptly at 11.30am. Please bring the 
Attendance Card which is attached to the Form of Proxy

right to attend, speak and vote and will speed up your 
admission to the meeting.
23. You may be asked to provide proof of identity (such as  
a current driving licence or passport), as well as your 
attendance card from your Form of Proxy. If you do not

Drax Group plc Notice of Annual General Meeting 2020
This appendix sets out the principal terms of the Drax Group plc 
Long Term Incentive Plan 2020 (LTIP) which is being put to 
shareholders at the AGM for approval by resolution 19. The rules 
of the Plan are broadly consistent with those under the Drax 
Group plc Performance Share Plan but have been revised to 
reflect developments in governance, to accord with the 
remuneration policy which is separately being voted on by 
shareholders at the AGM and feedback from shareholders 
during the initial consultation process.
The LTIP is a discretionary executive share plan and is intended 
to be operated for selected directors and senior employees  
of the Company and its subsidiaries (the Group). The Board  
of directors of the Company or a duly authorised committee, 
normally the Remuneration Committee, (the Board) will 
supervise the operation of the LTIP. LTIP awards may be granted 
in such form as determined by the Board including conditional 
rights to acquire shares, options or forfeitable shares which are 
subject to restrictions.
Eligibility: All employees (including executive directors) of the 
Group are eligible for selection to participate in the LTIP at the 
discretion of the Board. 
Timing of grants: Awards may be granted under the LTIP during 
the 42 days beginning on: (i) the date of shareholder approval of 
the LTIP; (ii) the day after the announcement of the Company’s 
results, including a preliminary announcement, for any period; 
(iii) any day on which the Board determines that circumstances 
are sufficiently exceptional to justify the grant of the award  
at that time; or (iv) the day after the lifting of any dealing 
restrictions which prevented the grant of awards at any of the 
other times described. No LTIP awards may be granted more 
than 10 years from the date when the LTIP was approved by 
shareholders.
Individual limit: The Board may grant awards over ordinary 
shares of the Company to eligible employees with a maximum 
total market value in any financial year of up to 200% of the 
relevant individual’s annual base salary. This limit does not apply 
to awards granted under the LTIP to facilitate the recruitment 
of participants, for which a separate limit of up to 300% of the 
relevant individual’s annual salary applies, while neither limit 
applies to buy-out awards (as permitted for Executive Directors 
under the Directors’ Remuneration Policy).
Overall plan limits: The LTIP may operate over new issue shares, 
treasury shares or shares purchased in the market. The rules of 
the LTIP provide that, in any period of 10 calendar years, not 
more than 10% of the Company’s issued ordinary share capital 
may be issued under the LTIP and under any other employees’ 
share scheme operated by the Company. In addition, the rules  
of the LTIP provide that, in any period of 10 calendar years, not 
more than 5% of the Company’s issued ordinary share capital 
may be issued under the LTIP and under any other executive 
share scheme adopted by the Company. Shares issued out  
of treasury under the LTIP will count towards these limits  
for so long as this is required under institutional shareholder 
guidelines. Awards which are renounced or lapse shall be 
disregarded for the purposes of these limits.
Performance conditions: The Board may impose performance 
conditions on the vesting of LTIP awards. Where performance 
conditions are specified for LTIP awards, the underlying 
measurement period for such conditions will ordinarily be  
three financial years. The proposed performance conditions  
for the first grant of LTIP awards are set out in the Directors’ 
Remuneration Policy which is being put to shareholders for 
approval at the AGM and shall be 50% cumulative adjusted  
EPS based and 50% TSR based.
Any performance conditions applying to LTIP awards may  
be varied, substituted or waived if the Board considers it 
appropriate, provided the Board considers that the new 
performance conditions are reasonable and (except in the  
case of waiver) are not materially less difficult to satisfy than 
the original conditions.
Vesting: LTIP awards will normally vest on the third anniversary 
of the date of grant of the award to the extent that any 
applicable performance conditions have been satisfied and  
to the extent permitted following any operation of malus or 
clawback, provided that the participant remains employed  
by the Group. The Board has discretion to adjust the level of 
vesting upwards or downwards from the level achieved under 
the performance conditions. LTIP awards granted as options 
will normally remain exercisable for a period determined by  
the Board at the date of grant which shall not exceed 10 years 
from grant.

The Drax Group plc Long-term Incentive Plan 2020 
17
Drax Group plc Notice of Annual General Meeting 2020
Malus and clawback: The Board may decide, at the vesting of  
an LTIP award or at any time before, that the number of shares 
subject to the award shall be cancelled or reduced (including  
to nil) or additional conditions may be imposed on the award  
on such basis that the Board in its discretion considers to be  
fair and reasonable in the following circumstances:
• the Board forms the view that the Company or a Group 
company materially misstated its financial results for 
whatever reason;
• the Board forms the view that in assessing any performance 
target and/ or any other condition imposed on an award was 
based on an error, or on inaccurate or misleading information 
or assumptions;
• a participant acts in a way that amounts to fraud or 
misconduct (as determined by the Board); 
• a material failure of risk management of the Company, a 
Group company or a business unit of the Group; 
• the Company or any Group company or business of the Group 
becomes insolvent or otherwise suffers a corporate failure so 
that the value of the Company’s shares is materially reduced 
provided that the Board determines following an appropriate 
review of accountability that the participant should be held 
responsible (in whole or in part) for that insolvency or 
corporate failure; or
• any other circumstances arise which the Board, acting fairly 
and reasonably, considers justify the reduction of the award 
(for example, a participant has by act or omission contributed 
to serious reputational damage to the Group).
In addition, if such an event occurs for an LTIP award in the two 
years following the vesting, the Board may apply clawback to 
the relevant vested award in the circumstances set out above. 
Clawback may be effected, among other means, by requiring the 
transfer of shares, payment of cash or reduction of LTIP awards 
or awards under other incentive plans operated by the Company.
Dividend equivalents: In respect of any award granted under 
the LTIP, the Board may decide that participants will receive a 
payment (in cash and/or additional shares) equal in value to any 
dividends that would have been paid on the shares which vest 
under that award by reference to the period between the time 
when the relevant award was granted and the time when the 
relevant award vested. This amount may assume the 
reinvestment of dividends and exclude or include special 
dividends or dividends in specie.
Holding period: The Board may at the date of grant impose a 
holding period in respect of shares which have vested under  
the LTIP (and normally also to any cash or assets (other than 
ordinary dividends) deriving from them) for up to two years 
following the vesting period. Ordinarily such holding period  
will only apply to executive directors, but may in the discretion 
of the Board apply to other participants. The duration of such 
holding period in respect of executive directors will be 
determined by reference to the Remuneration Policy in place 
from time to time. 
Cessation of employment: Except in certain circumstances,  
set out below, an LTIP award will lapse immediately upon a 
participant ceasing to be employed by or holding office with  
the Group.
If a participant so ceases because of their ill-health, disability, 
retirement with the agreement of their employer, redundancy, 
the participant being employed by a company which ceases  
to be a Group company or being employed in an undertaking 
which is transferred to a person who is not a Group company  
or in other circumstances at the discretion of the Board (each a 
Good Leaver Reason), their LTIP award will ordinarily vest on the 
date when it would have vested if they had not so ceased to be 
a Group employee or director, subject to the satisfaction of any 
applicable performance conditions measured over the original 
performance period and the operation of malus or clawback.  
In addition, unless the Board decides otherwise, vesting will be 
pro-rated to reflect the reduced period of time between grant 
and the participant’s cessation of employment as a proportion 
of the normal vesting period.
If a participant ceases to be a Group employee or director for  
a Good Leaver Reason, the Board can alternatively decide that 
their LTIP award will vest early when they leave. If a participant 
dies, a proportion of their LTIP award will normally vest on the 
date of their death. The extent to which a LTIP award will vest in 
these situations will be determined by the Board at its absolute 
discretion taking into account, among other factors, the period 
of time the LTIP award has been held and the extent to which 
any applicable performance conditions have been satisfied at 
the date of cessation of employment and the operation of malus 
or clawback. In addition, unless the Board decides otherwise, 
vesting will be pro-rated to reflect the reduced period of time 
between grant and the participant’s cessation of employment 
as a proportion of the normal vesting period.
LTIP awards of Good Leavers which are in the form of options 
and which have vested may be exercised for a period of 6 
months following vesting (or such longer period as the Board 
determines) and will otherwise lapse at the end of that period. 
LTIP options which have vested may normally be exercised for  
a period of 12 months following death and will otherwise lapse 
at the end of that period.
18
Drax Group plc Notice of Annual General Meeting 2020
Corporate events: In the event of a takeover, scheme of 
arrangement, or winding-up of the Company, LTIP awards will 
vest early. The proportion of a LTIP award which vests shall be 
determined by the Board taking into account, among other 
factors, the period of time the LTIP award has been held by the 
participant and the extent to which any applicable performance 
conditions have been satisfied at that time. LTIP awards which 
are in the form of options and which have vested may be 
exercised for a period of 6 months measured from the relevant 
event (or in the case of takeover such longer period as the Board 
determines) and will otherwise lapse at the end of that period.
In the event of a demerger, distribution or any other corporate 
event, the Board may determine that LTIP awards shall vest. The 
proportion of a LTIP award which vests will be determined by 
the Board taking into account, among other factors, the period 
of time the LTIP award has been held by the participant and the 
extent to which any applicable performance conditions have 
been satisfied at that time. LTIP awards which are in the form  
of options that vest in these circumstances may be exercised 
during such period as the Board determines and will otherwise 
lapse at the end of that period.
If there is a corporate event resulting in a new person or 
company acquiring control of the Company, the Board may 
alternatively decide that LTIP awards will not vest or lapse but 
will be replaced by equivalent new awards over shares in the 
new acquiring company.
Awards not transferable: Awards granted under the LTIP are  
not transferable other than to the participant’s personal 
representatives in the event of their death.
Variation of capital: If there is a variation of the Company’s 
share capital or in the event of a demerger or other distribution, 
special dividend or distribution, the Board may make such 
adjustments to awards granted under the LTIP including the 
number of shares subject to awards and the option exercise 
price (if any), as it considers to be fair and reasonable.
Alternative settlement: At its discretion, the Board may decide 
to satisfy awards granted under the LTIP with a payment in cash 
or shares equal to any gain that a participant would have made 
had the relevant award been satisfied with shares.
Rights attaching to shares: Except in relation to the award of 
forfeitable restricted shares, shares issued and/or transferred 
under the LTIP will not confer any rights on any participant until 
the relevant award has vested or the relevant option has been 
exercised and the participant in question has received the 
underlying shares. Any shares allotted when an option is 
exercised or an award vests will rank equally with shares then  
in issue (except for rights arising by reference to a record date 
prior to their issue). A participant awarded forfeitable shares 
subject to restrictions will have the same rights as a holder  
of shares in issue at the time that the participant acquires  
the shares, except to the extent set out in the agreement  
with the participant relating to those shares.
Amendments: The Board may, at any time, amend the provisions 
of the LTIP in any respect. The prior approval of the Company  
in general meeting must be obtained in the case of any 
amendment to the advantage of participants which is made  
to the provisions relating to eligibility, individual or overall limits, 
the persons to whom an award can be made under the LTIP,  
the adjustments that may be made in the event of any variation 
to the share capital of the Company and/or the rule relating to 
such prior approval.
However, shareholder approval is not required for any minor 
amendment to benefit the administration of the LTIP, to take 
account of the provisions of any proposed or existing legislation 
or to obtain or maintain favourable tax, exchange control or 
regulatory treatment for participants, the Company and/or  
its other Group companies. Amendments may not normally 
adversely affect the rights of participants except where 
participants are notified of such amendment and the majority 
of participants approve such amendment.
Overseas plans: The Board may, at any time, establish further 
plans based on the LTIP for overseas territories. Any such plan 
shall be similar to the LTIP, as relevant, but modified to take 
account of local tax, exchange control or securities laws.  
Any shares made available under such further overseas plans 
must be treated as counting against the limits on individual  
and overall participation under the LTIP.
Benefits not pensionable: Benefits received under the LTIP are 
not pensionable.
