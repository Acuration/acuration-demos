DATA PROTECTION PRINCIPLES
We will comply with data protection law. 
This says that the personal information we hold about you must 
be:
 
1. 
Used lawfully, fairly and in a transparent way.
 
2. 
 Collected only for valid purposes that we have clearly 
explained to you and not used in any way that is 
incompatible with those purposes.
 
3. 
 Relevant to the purposes we have told you about and 
limited only to those purposes.
 
4. 
Accurate and kept up to date.
 
5. 
 Kept only as long as necessary for the purposes we 
have told you about. 
 
6. 
Kept securely.
HOW WE’LL USE INFORMATION ABOUT YOU
We will only use your personal information when the law allows 
us to.  Most commonly, we will use your personal information in 
the following circumstances:
•  Where we need to enter into a contract of employment with 
you or where we need to perform under an employment 
contract with you*;
•  Where we need to comply with a legal obligation, for 
example, to ensure we make any reasonable adjustments 
under disability law**;
•  Where you give us consent, for example, when we are 
collecting diversity data***; and/or
•  Where it is necessary for our legitimate interests (or those of 
a third party) and your interests and fundamental rights do 
not override those interests, for example, carrying out surveys 
about applicant experience****. 
We may also use your personal information in the following 
situations, which are likely to be rare:
•  Where we need to protect your vital interests (or someone 
else’s interests), for example, if you are involved in a serious 
accident and we need to provide health information to the 
accident responders;
•  Where it is needed in the public interest or for official 
purposes, for example where we carry out equalities 
monitoring.
Situations in which we’ll use your personal information
The situations in which we will process your personal 
information are listed below. We have indicated by asterisks 
the purpose or purposes for which we are processing or will 
process your personal information, as well as indicating which 
categories of personal information are involved.
Some of the above grounds for processing will overlap and there 
may be several grounds which justify our use of your personal 
information.
THE KIND OF INFORMATION WE COLLECT
To decide whether to shortlist you as an applicant and to 
contact you in relation to your application*/**, we will need to 
collect the following information about you up to and including 
the shortlisting stage of the recruitment process:
•  Your name and contact details (e.g. address, home and 
mobile phone numbers, email address);
• Your curriculum vitae/resume;
•  Details of your qualifications, experience, employment history 
(including job titles and salary); 
•  Whether you have worked on Smart Systems as part of your 
employment (where applicable); and

information.

Drax Applicant Privacy Notice
If we decide to invite you to attend an interview, in certain 
circumsances we may need to collect the following personal 
information about you (you will be notified in advance):
•  Your nationality and immigration status and information 
from related documents, such as your passport or other 
identification and immigration information**;
•  Copies of documents containing your name, address and 
date of birth to enable us to verify your identity*; and
• A copy of your driving licence*/** if relevant for your role.
After we have made a conditional job offer, we will need to 
collect the following personal information about you to allow us 
to make our final decision as to whether to recruit you*/**:
•  Information about your previous academic and/or 
employment history from references obtained about you 
from previous employers and/or education providers;
•  Information regarding your academic and (where relevant) 
professional qualifications; and
•  Information regarding your unspent criminal convictions 
obtained through a DBS Basic Check, if required for your role.
Dependant upon your job role, we are under a statutory 
obligation to collect information from you regarding your 
criminal record, your nationality and immigration status and 
information from related documents, and a copy of your driving 
licence to enable us to verify your right to work in the United 
Kingdom**. 
If your application is successful, we will use the information 
provided above to the extent necessary to administer your 
employment*. Further details about how we will process your 
personal information pursuant to your employment will be 
provided in our Employee Privacy Policy.
HOW IS YOUR PERSONAL INFORMATION 
COLLECTED?
We will collect personal information about employees, workers 
and contractors through the application and recruitment 
process, either directly from candidates or sometimes from an 
employment agency or background check provider. We may 
sometimes collect additional information from third parties 
including former employers, credit reference agencies or other 
background check agencies. If we do so, you will be provided 
with more specific information at the time. 
POINTS TO NOTE
Your personal contact details will be stored in case of 
emergency.  Such emergencies include but are not limited 
to notifying you that the location of the planned interview or 
testing is not accessible, for example, due to bad weather and 
advising you that due to an incident, normal operations are 
suspended or being managed elsewhere***.
If you do not provide personal information
If you do not provide certain information when requested we 
may be prevented from complying with our legal obligations 
(such as to ensure the health and safety of our workers or to 
verify your right to work in the UK).
Change of purpose
We will only use your personal information for the purposes 
for which we collected it, unless we reasonably consider 
that we need to use it for another reason and that reason is 
compatible with the original purpose. 
HOW WE USE SENSITIVE PERSONAL 
INFORMATION
You may volunteer and we may also receive from you 
information that we could store and use. The following 
“special categories” of more sensitive personal information if it 
relates to your potential employment with us:
•  Information about your health, including any medical 
condition, health and sickness records;
•  Information about your race or ethnicity, religious beliefs or 
sexual orientation;
• Trade union membership, where appropriate;
• Information about criminal convictions and offences. 
“Special categories” of particularly sensitive personal 
information require higher levels of protection. We need 
to have further justification for collecting, storing and 
using this type of personal information. We may process 
special categories of personal information in the following 
circumstances:
•  Where we need to carry out our legal obligations, for 
example, complying with health and safety obligations and 
in line with our Privacy Policy;
•  Where it is needed in the public interest, for example, 
equal opportunities monitoring and in line with our Privacy 
Policy;
•  Where it is needed to assess your working capacity on 
health grounds, subject to appropriate confidentiality 
safeguards;
•  Where it is needed to help us drive equal opportunity for 
all.
•  In limited circumstances, with your explicit written 
consent.
Less commonly, we may process this type of information 
where it is needed in relation to legal claims or where it is 
needed to protect your interests (or someone else’s interests) 
and you are not capable of giving your consent, or where you 
have already made the information public.
Our obligations as a potential employer
We may use personal data about your physical or mental 
health, or disability status, to ensure your health and safety on 
our site and to provide appropriate adjustments.
Do we need your consent?
We do not need your consent if we use special categories 
of your personal information in accordance with our written 
policy (our Privacy Policy) to carry out our legal obligations or 
exercise specific rights in the field of employment law. 
In limited circumstances, we may approach you for your 
4
Drax Applicant Privacy Notice
written consent to allow us to process certain particularly 
sensitive personal information, for example ethnicity. If we 
do so, we will provide you with full details of the information 
that we would like and the reason we need it, so that you can 
carefully consider whether you wish to consent. You should be 
aware that it is not a condition of your employment contract 
with us that you agree to any request for consent from us.
INFORMATION ABOUT CRIMINAL CONVICTIONS
Where we are legally permitted and/or required, and it is 
appropriate given the nature of your role (e.g. a finance role, 
where you are going to be working at one of our visitor centres 
or on Smart Systems), we may collect information about 
unspent criminal convictions as part of the recruitment process 
and we may repeat those checks from time to time during your 
employment with us as considered necessary.  
We will use information about unspent criminal convictions 
to meet our legal obligations such as to assess whether your 
continued employment poses an unacceptable risk to us, our 
customers or our employees / workers.   
AUTOMATED DECISION-MAKING
Automated decision-making takes place when an electronic 
system uses personal information to make a decision without 
human intervention. We are allowed to use automated decision-
making in the following circumstances:
•  where we have notified you of the decision and given you 21 
days to request a reconsideration;
•  where it is necessary to perform our employment contract 
with you and appropriate measures are in place to safeguard 
your rights;
•  in limited circumstances, with your explicit written consent 
and where appropriate measures are in place to safeguard 
your rights.
As a part of your candidate experience we ensure that all 
applications made to us are reviewed by a member of our 
recruitment team. We confirm that will not make any decisions 
about you using automated means, however we will notify you 
in writing if this position changes.
DATA SHARING
We may have to share your personal information with third 
parties, including third-party service providers and other 
companies in the Drax group. We require third parties to respect 
the security of your personal information and to treat it in 
accordance with the law.  We have a Third-Party Onboarding 
Privacy Policy that governs our appointment of third-party 
service providers where we may share, or they may be able to 
access, personal information that we control.  It requires us to 
carry out due diligence on them and to ensure appropriate data 
protection terms are in our agreement with them. 
Why might we share your personal information with third 
parties?
Where we use video conferencing and other technology 
facilities to conduct an interview with you, we are required 
through a third party system to share your personal information 
to facilitate the call.
Which third-party service providers process your personal 
information?
“Third parties” includes third-party service providers (including 
contractors and designated agents) and other entities within 
our Drax group of companies. 
When might we share your personal information with other 
Drax group companies?
We will share your personal information with other companies 
in the Drax group as part of our regular human resources 
processes and for system maintenance support and hosting of 
personal information.
Transferring information outside the United Kingdom (UK) and 
European Union (EU)
Most of the personal information we collect about you is based 
in the United Kingdom or in some cases, a service provider or 
their sub-processor may be based outside the UK or  the EU 
and so, they are required to comply with UK or European data 
protection law.  On occasion, we may appoint a third-party 
service provider whose operation or a server or sub-processor 
may be based outside of the UK or EU.  As part of our Third-
Party Onboarding Privacy Policy, we carry out due diligence 
on our third-party providers and assess whether your personal 
information will be transferred to them or accessed by them 
from outside the UK or EU.  If that is the case, we ensure a 
similar degree of protection is afforded to it by ensuring at least 
one of the following safeguards is implemented:
•  we will only transfer your personal information to countries 
that have been deemed to provide an adequate level 
of protection for personal information by the European 
Commission1 ; or
•  where we use providers based in the US, we may transfer 
personal information to them if they are part of the Privacy 
Shield which requires them to provide similar protection to 
personal information shared between the UK and the US.  
You can view certifications at www.privacyshield.gov2 ; or
•  where we use certain service providers who are not in a 
‘adequate’ country or part of the Privacy Shield, we may use 
specific contracts approved by the European Commission 
which give personal information the same protection it has in 
the UK and EU, called an EU Model Clause Agreement3 .
If you would like to know the specific mechanism used by us 
when transferring your personal information out of the UK or 
EU, please contact us using the details in the “Contacting Us” 
section at the end of this Notice.

DATA SECURITY  
We have put in place appropriate security measures to prevent 
your personal information from being accidentally lost, used or 
accessed in an unauthorised way, altered or disclosed such as 
corporate firewalls protecting multi-layer server configuration 
and penetration testing.   If you would like to know more, 
contact us using the details in the “Contacting Us” section at 
the end of this Notice.
In addition, we limit access to your personal information to 
those employees, agents, contractors and other third parties 
who have a business need to know. They will only process your 
personal information on our instructions and they are subject to 
a duty of confidentiality and an obligation to comply with data 
protection law.  See the Data Sharing section above for further 
information.
We have put in place procedures to deal with any suspected 
data security breach and will notify you and the regulator of a 
suspected breach where we are legally required to do so.  
DATA RETENTION
How long will we use your information for?
We will only retain your personal information for as long as 
necessary to fulfil the purposes we collected it for, including for 
the purposes of satisfying any legal, accounting, or reporting 
requirements. To determine the appropriate retention period 
for personal information, we consider the amount, nature, 
and sensitivity of the personal information, the potential risk 
of harm from unauthorised use or disclosure of your personal 
information, the purposes for which we process your personal 
information and whether we can achieve those purposes 
through other means, and the applicable legal requirements.  
Personal information relating to unsuccessful applicants will be 
deleted or anonymised at the latest 12 months following the last 
time you logged into our recruitment system, unless you have 
agreed to us retaining your details so that we can inform you of 
any suitable vacancies that arise, in which case we will retain 
your personal information for up to 2 years.
In some circumstances we may anonymise your personal 
information so that it can no longer be associated with you, in 
which case we may use such information without further notice 
to you. 
RIGHTS OF ACCESS, CORRECTION, ERASURE, AND 
RESTRICTION
Your responsibility to inform us of changes
It is important that the personal information we hold about 
you is accurate and current. Please keep us informed if your 
personal information changes during your working relationship 
with us by logging into your account and updating the 
information.
Your rights in connection with personal information
Data protection laws provide you with the following rights:
·  Request access to your personal information (commonly 
known as a “data subject access request”). This enables you 
to receive a copy of the personal information we hold about 
you and to check that we are lawfully processing it;
·  Request correction of the personal information that we 
hold about you. This enables you to have any incomplete 
or inaccurate information we hold about you corrected.  It 
is possible for you to update your information within our 
recruitment system yourself;
·  Request erasure of your personal information in certain 
circumstances. This enables you to ask us to delete or 
remove personal information where there is no good reason 
for us continuing to process it. You also have the right to ask 
us to delete or remove your personal information where you 
have exercised your right to object to processing (see below).  
However, this is not an absolute right and there will be 
circumstances where we are required to retain your personal 
information even if you are no-longer an employee of ours, 
for example, to defend a legal claim.   It is possible for you 
to update your information within our recruitment system 
yourself ;  
·  Request the restriction of processing of your personal 
information in certain circumstances. This enables you to ask 
us to suspend the processing of personal information about 
you, for example if you want us to establish its accuracy or 
the reason for processing;
·  Request the transfer of your personal information to another 
party.
You also have a Right to Object to the processing of your 
personal information where we are relying on a legitimate 
interest (or those of a third party) and there is something about 
your particular situation which makes you want to object to 
processing on this ground. 
If you want to exercise any of these rights, please contact us 
using the details in the “Contacting Us” section at the end of 
this Notice.
Please note, you have the right to make a complaint at any time 
to the UK regulator for data protection issues, the Information 
Commissioner’s Office (ICO).  The ICO can be contacted 
by telephone on 0303 123 1113 or by post at Information 
Commissioners Office, Wycliffe House, Water Lane, Wilmslow, 
Cheshire, SK9 5AF or via email at casework@ico.org.uk.  We 
would, however, appreciate the chance to deal with your 
concerns before you approach the ICO, so please contact us in 
the first instance using the contact details set out below.  
No fee usually required
You will not have to pay a fee to access your personal 
information (or to exercise any of the other rights). However, we 
may charge a reasonable fee if your request for access is clearly 
unfounded or excessive. Alternatively, we may refuse to comply 
with the request in such circumstances.
What we may need from you
We may need to request specific information from you to help 
us confirm your identity and ensure your right to access the 
information (or to exercise any of your other rights). This is 
another appropriate security measure to ensure that personal 
information is not disclosed to any person who has no right to 
receive it.

Timing of our response
We do our best to respond to all legitimate requests within one 
calendar month.  Occasionally, it may take us longer than a month 
if your request is particularly complex or you have made a number 
of requests.  In this case, we will notify you and keep you updated.  
RIGHT TO WITHDRAW CONSENT 
In the limited circumstances where you may have provided your 
consent to the collection, processing and transfer of your personal 
information for a specific purpose, you have the right to withdraw 
your consent for that specific processing at any time. 
To withdraw your consent, please contact us using the details in 
the “Contacting Us” section at the end of this Notice. Once we 
have received notification that you have withdrawn your consent, 
we will no longer process your information for the purpose 
or purposes you originally agreed to, unless we have another 
legitimate basis for doing so in law.
CHANGES TO THIS PRIVACY NOTICE  
We reserve the right to update this Notice at any time, and we 
will provide you with a new Notice when we make any material 
updates. We may also notify you in other ways from time to time 
about the processing of your personal information.
