Dear Shareholder,
Annual General Meeting (AGM) 
I am pleased to enclose the Notice of the AGM of Drax Group plc (the Company or Drax), which will be held at 11.30am on Wednesday 
21 April 2021 at 8-10, The Lakes, Northampton NN4 7YD. The Notice of the AGM is set out in Part B on pages 3 and 4. 
At the time of publication of this notice, public health guidance and legislation issued by the UK Government imposes restrictions  
on public gatherings and travel as a result of the Covid-19 pandemic. It is likely that these restrictions on public gatherings will 
remain in place at the time of the AGM. In light of these measures, and with the safety and wellbeing of the Company’s shareholders 
and employees in mind, the Directors have decided that attendance at the AGM will be restricted. 
This means that shareholders and other attendees will not currently be permitted to attend the AGM in person, save for the Chair 
and any persons nominated by the Chair of the meeting in order to establish a quorum. However, despite the current exceptional 
circumstances, the Directors are keen to maintain engagement with shareholders. You can therefore join the meeting and submit 
questions by logging on to web.lumiagm.com. A user guide detailing the arrangements to join and submit questions at the meeting  
is set out in Appendix 2 on pages 17 and 18. 
Your vote is important to us. All votes will be by poll which means that each share carries one vote and all votes count. As you will  
not be able to attend in person, we strongly encourage you to vote in advance or to appoint the Chair as your proxy by submitting 
your enclosed proxy form by post or electronically as further detailed on pages 8 and 9. If you appoint someone other than the  
Chair of the meeting as your proxy, that person may not be able to attend the AGM in person or cast your votes.
The Directors are very grateful to shareholders for their support and understanding in these challenging times.
Explanatory notes
The explanatory notes to the Resolutions are set out in Part C on pages 5 to 7.

is able to attend the meeting.
The results of the voting at the meeting will be announced to the London Stock Exchange as soon as practicable following the 
meeting and will also appear on the Company’s website www.drax.com.
The Company has included on the Form of Proxy, and the Form of Direction, a “Vote withheld” option in order for shareholders  
to abstain from voting on any particular Resolution. However, an abstention is not a vote in law and will not be counted in the 
calculation of the proportion of votes “For” or “Against” the relevant Resolution.
Recommendation
The Directors of the Company consider that the Resolutions to be put to shareholders at the AGM are in the best interests of the 
Company and its members as a whole.
Accordingly, the Directors unanimously recommend that you vote in favour of all the proposed Resolutions as they intend to  
do so in respect of their own beneficial interests.
Yours sincerely
Philip Cox CBE 
Chair

Resolution 1
To receive and adopt the Company’s Annual Report and 
Accounts
The Directors are required to present to the meeting the Annual 
Report and Accounts for the financial year ended 31 December 
2020. This includes (i) the audited accounts; (ii) the Directors’ 
report; (iii) the strategic report; and (iv) the report of the auditor 
of the Company on the audited accounts and the auditable part 
of the Directors’ Remuneration Report. A separate resolution 
seeks approval by the shareholders of the Directors’ 
Remuneration Report, which vote is advisory in nature.
Resolution 2
Directors’ Remuneration Report
Resolution 2 seeks shareholder approval for the annual 
statement to shareholders by the Chair of the Remuneration 
Committee and the Annual Report on Remuneration which  
can be found on pages 108 to 133 of the Annual Report and 
Accounts. The Annual Report on Remuneration gives details  
of the implementation of the Company’s existing Directors’ 
Remuneration Policy in terms of the payments and share awards 
made to the Directors in connection with their performance and 
that of the Company during the year ended 31 December 2020. 
This vote is advisory and will not affect the way in which the 
Directors’ Remuneration Policy has been implemented.
The Company’s auditor during the year, Deloitte LLP, has audited 
those parts of the Directors’ Remuneration Report that are 
required to be audited and their report may be found on pages 
143 to 150 of the Annual Report and Accounts.
Resolution 3
To approve the final dividend
Resolution 3 seeks shareholder approval to pay the final dividend 
of 10.3 pence per ordinary share, which is recommended by the 
Directors for payment to those shareholders who are on the 
Register of the Company at 6.30pm on 23 April 2021. If approved  
by shareholders at the AGM, the final dividend will be paid on  
14 May 2021. 
Resolutions 4 to 10
To re-elect the Directors
In accordance with the recommendations of the UK Corporate 
Governance Code (the Code), each of the Directors will retire 
and offer themselves for re-election by shareholders.
The skills and experience for each of the Directors are set out  
in Part F of this Notice (and on pages 84 and 85 of the Annual 
Report and Accounts). 
The Board has determined that all of the Non-Executive 
Directors being proposed for re-election are independent  
in character and judgement, and there are no relationships  
or circumstances which are likely to affect, or could appear  
to affect, their independence.
During the year, the Board completed a review of its 
performance as well as an externally led evaluation of its 
Committees. Following these evaluations, the Board is satisfied 
that the performance of each Director standing for re-election 
continues to be effective and that each Director continues to 
demonstrate commitment to the role. 
It is the Group’s policy to rigorously review any proposal to 
extend a Non-Executive Director’s aggregate period of office 
beyond six years. During the year, the Senior Independent 
Director led a review into the appropriateness of the Chair 
serving a third and final term. The review found the 
performance of the Chair continues to be effective – he shows 
good leadership, invests the necessary time, cultivates good 
dynamics and an open and transparent Board culture, and 
ensures there is appropriate Board focus on the long-term. 
Following the review, the Board unanimously support the 
re-election of the Chair. 
More information can be found on pages 95 and 96 of the 
Annual Report and Accounts. 
Resolutions 11 and 12
Reappointment of auditor and determination of their 
remuneration
The Company must appoint or re-appoint an auditor at every 
general meeting at which accounts are presented and it is 
normal practice for the Company’s Directors, acting through  
the Audit Committee, to be authorised to determine the 
auditor’s remuneration. Deloitte LLP has advised its willingness 
to continue in office as auditor of the Company.
Resolution 13
Political donations and expenditure
Part 14 of the Companies Act 2006 (the Act) contains 
restrictions on companies making political donations or 
incurring political expenditure.
Drax is a politically neutral organisation and did not make any 
political donations in 2020. 
It is not the policy of the Company to make donations to political 
parties, and the Directors have no intention of changing that 
policy. However, the Act defines political donations and political 
expenditure terms very widely. This means that activities that 
form part of the normal relationship between the Company  
and bodies concerned with policy review, law reform and other 
business matters affecting the Company, which might not be 
thought to be political expenditure in the usual sense, could 
require shareholders’ consent under the Act.
Part C 
Explanatory notes to the Notice of the AGM
6 
Drax Group plc Notice of Annual General Meeting 2021
In view of the broad wording adopted in the Act, and the Board’s 
wish to avoid any inadvertent infringement of it, it is seeking 
shareholders’ consent for the Company, and any wholly owned 
subsidiary company, to incur total annual expenditure for such 
purposes, provided that the aggregate amount of any such 
donations and expenditure shall not exceed £125,000, in order 
that the Company may continue to engage with regulators and 
policymakers without inadvertently breaching the applicable 
legislation. Further information on how the Company engaged 
with political parties in 2020 can be found on page 43 and page 
136 of our Annual Report and Accounts and our Political 
Engagement Policy is available on our website at 
 
www.drax.com.
It is the intention that the Company will seek to renew this 
authority, if appropriate, at each subsequent AGM.
Resolution 14
Authority of Directors to allot shares
The authority given to the Directors to allot further shares in  
the capital of the Company requires the prior authorisation  
of the shareholders in general meeting under Section 551 CA 
2006. Upon the passing of Resolution 14 the Directors will have 
authority (pursuant to paragraph (a) of the Resolution) to allot 
shares up to an aggregate nominal value of £15,320,832, which 
is approximately one-third of the issued ordinary share capital 
as at 10 March 2021 (being the latest practicable date before 
the publication of this Notice). This authority will expire 
immediately following the AGM in 2022 or on 30 June 2022, 
whichever is the earlier.
In addition, in accordance with the Investment Association 
Share Capital Management Guidelines (which set out the 
expectations of institutional investors in relation to, among 
other things, the authority of Directors to allot shares), upon the 
passing of this Resolution 14, the Directors will have authority 
(pursuant to paragraph (b) of the Resolution) to allot ordinary 
shares in connection with a rights issue in favour of ordinary 
shareholders up to a maximum nominal value of £30,641,665,  
as reduced by the nominal amount of any shares issued under 
paragraph (a) of Resolution 14.
This amount (before any reduction) represents approximately 
two-thirds of the Company’s issued ordinary share capital as  
at 10 March 2021 (being the latest practicable date before  
the publication of this Notice). This authority will also expire 
immediately following the next AGM or on 30 June 2022, 
whichever is the earlier. As a result, if Resolution 14 is passed, 
the Directors could allot shares representing up to two-thirds  
of the Company’s current issued share capital pursuant to a 
rights issue.
The Directors will continue to seek to renew these authorities  
at each AGM, in accordance with current best practice from 
time to time. The Directors have no current plans to exercise 
this authority except in connection with employee share plans.
As at 10 March 2021, being the latest practicable date before 
publication of this Notice, the Company held 13,841,295 equity 
securities in treasury.
Resolution 15
Disapplication of pre-emption rights
If the Directors wish to exercise the authority under Resolution 
14 and offer shares (or sell any shares which the Company may 
purchase and elect to hold as treasury shares) for cash, the  
CA 2006 requires that, unless shareholders have given specific 
authority for the waiver of their statutory pre-emption rights, 
the new shares must be offered first to existing shareholders  
in proportion to their existing shareholdings. In certain 
circumstances, it may be in the best interests of the Company  
to allot new shares (or to grant rights over shares) for cash 
without first offering them to existing shareholders in 
proportion to their holdings.
Resolution 15 would authorise the Directors to do this by 
allowing the Directors to allot shares for cash (i) by way of a 
rights issue (subject to certain exclusions), (ii) by way of an open 
offer or other offer of securities (not being a rights issue) in 
favour of existing shareholders in proportion (as nearly as may 
be) to their shareholdings (subject to certain exclusions) and  
(iii) otherwise than under (i) or (ii), up to an aggregate nominal 
value of £2,298,124 which is equivalent to approximately 5% of 
the issued ordinary share capital of the Company on 10 March 
2021 (being the latest practicable date prior to the publication 
of this Notice). The Resolution also applies to the sale and 
re-issue of ordinary shares held as treasury shares by the 
Company.
If approved by the shareholders, the authority contained in 
Resolution 15 will expire on the earlier of the conclusion of the 
next AGM or on 30 June 2022. The Directors intend to renew 
such power at successive AGMs in accordance with current 
best practice.
The Directors have no current plans to exercise this authority 
except in connection with employee share plans (but they 
consider its approval to be appropriate in order to preserve 
maximum flexibility for the future).
In addition, and in line with best practice, the Company has  
not issued more than 7.5% of its issued share capital on a 
non-pre-emptive basis over the last three years. In accordance 
with the Pre-Emption Group’s Statement of Principles regarding 
cumulative usage of authorities, the Directors do not intend to 
issue more than 7.5% of the issued ordinary share capital of the 
Company (excluding treasury shares) for cash on a non- 
pre-emptive basis in any rolling three-year period without prior 
consultation with shareholders.
As at 10 March 2021, being the latest practicable date before 
the publication of this Notice, the Company held 13,841,295 
equity securities in treasury.

Resolution 16
To authorise the Company to purchase its own shares
Resolution 16 is to authorise the Company to buy back up to 
41,172,561 ordinary shares. The authority would expire at the 
conclusion of the 2022 AGM or, if earlier, on 30 June 2022. The 
Directors intend to seek renewal of this power at subsequent 
AGMs in accordance with current best practice.
Resolution 16 specifies the maximum number of ordinary shares 
which may be purchased (representing 10% of the Company’s 
issued ordinary share capital as at 10 March 2021) and the 
maximum and minimum prices at which they may be bought, 
exclusive of expenses, reflecting the requirements of the CA 
2006 and the Listing Rules.
The Directors have no present intention of exercising this 
authority other than with a view for use in relation to the 
Company’s share plans or where it is appropriate to conduct  
buy backs to return value to shareholders. The granting of this 
authority should not be taken to imply that any ordinary shares 
will be purchased, other than in relation to the above. Except  
in relation to the above, no purchase of ordinary shares will be 
made unless it is expected that the effect will be to increase 
earnings per share and the Directors consider it to be in the best 
interests of shareholders.
Under the CA 2006, the Company is allowed to hold its own 
shares in treasury following a buy back, instead of having to 
cancel them. This gives the Company the ability to re-issue 
treasury shares quickly and cost-effectively (including pursuant 
to the authority under Resolution 14 above) and provides the 
Company with additional flexibility in the management of its 
capital base. The Company currently holds 13,841,295 shares in 
 treasury following a buy back programme between April 2018  
and January 2019.
Such shares may be re-sold for cash but all rights attaching to 
them, including voting rights and any right to receive dividends, 
are suspended whilst they are held in treasury. If the Directors 
exercise the authority conferred by Resolution 16, the Company 
will have the option of either holding in treasury or of cancelling 
any of its own shares purchased pursuant to this authority and 
will decide at the time of purchase which option to pursue.
The total number of options to subscribe for, and awards over, 
shares, outstanding at 10 March 2021, being the last practicable 
date before the publication of this Notice was 17,329,925. This 
represents approximately 4.21% of the issued share capital at 
that date. If the Company was to buy back the maximum 
number of ordinary shares permitted pursuant to this 
Resolution then the total number of options to subscribe for 
ordinary shares, outstanding at 10 March 2021, would represent 
approximately 4.68% of the reduced share capital.
Resolution 17
Adoption of New Articles 
The Company is proposing to adopt the New Articles in order  
to update the Current Articles to reflect recent developments  
in market practice, including in relation to the retirement and 
reappointment of Directors, hybrid general meetings (enabling 
shareholders to attend in person or remotely) and untraced 
shareholders, as well as amending the language of the articles 
to be gender neutral.
Details of the principal changes being proposed in the New 
Articles are summarised in the Appendix. Changes of a minor, 
technical or clarifying nature (Minor Changes) have not been 
summarised in Appendix 1. A copy of the New Articles, together 
with a marked up version detailing both the principal changes 
noted in Appendix 1 and the Minor Changes will be available  
for inspection on the Company’s website.
Resolution 18
To allow general meetings to be held on 14 clear days’ notice  
in certain circumstances
Resolution 18 is a resolution to allow the Company to hold 
general meetings (other than AGMs) on 14 clear days’ notice. 
The Shareholders’ Rights Regulations state that the notice 
period required for general meetings of the Company is 21 days, 
unless shareholders approve a shorter notice period, which 
cannot, however, be less than 14 clear days. AGMs will continue 
to be held on at least 21 clear days’ notice.
In order to preserve the Company’s ability to call general 
meetings (other than an AGM) on 14 clear days’ notice, 
Resolution 18 seeks such approval. The shorter notice period 
would not be used as a matter of routine for such meetings,  
but only where the flexibility is merited by the business of the 
meeting and is thought to be to the advantage of shareholders 
as a whole.
The CA 2006 requires that, in order to be able to call a general 
meeting on less than 21 clear days’ notice, the Company must 
make a means of electronic voting available to all shareholders 
for that meeting. The Company provides this facility (see 
paragraph 10 of Part D on page 9 of this document for the 
Company’s arrangements for electronic proxy appointments).

Drax Group plc Notice of Annual General Meeting 2021
Part D 
Administrative notes relating to the AGM 
Attendance
1. 
The AGM is an important part of our shareholder 
communications programme and our intention is always  
to hold a physical meeting where we are allowed to do so. 
Unfortunately, at the time of writing, we have to assume 
that UK Government restrictions will prohibit us from 
allowing you to attend the AGM in person this year. In light  
of this, we have made arrangements for the AGM to be 
broadcast live online using the Lumi AGM platform. This  
will allow you to join the meeting electronically, watch the 
presentations and ask questions during the meeting. This 
can be done by accessing the AGM website https://web.
lumiagm.com. Further details on how you can join us live  
are set out in Appendix 2 of this Notice.
2. We are proposing changes to our Articles of Association to 
allow us more flexibility to hold what are known as ‘hybrid’  
or ‘satellite’ meetings going forward. These are essentially 
meetings where shareholders do not have to be physically 
present at the location of the meeting but instead can join 
remotely by video or telephone. It is, however, our intention 
to always allow shareholders to attend in person should  
they wish, and our amended Articles, if approved, would  
still require us to hold a physical meeting. By changing our 
Articles we will be providing access to shareholders who  
are unable to join in person and we see this as a positive  
step in terms of transparency. 
3. Pursuant to regulation 41 of the Uncertificated Securities 
Regulations 2001 (as amended) and for the purposes of 
Section 360B CA 2006, the Company specifies that only 
those shareholders registered on the Register at 6.30pm  
on the day two business days before the date of the meeting 
(the Specified Time) (or if the meeting is adjourned to a time 
more than 48 hours after the Specified Time, by 6.30pm  
on the day which is two business days prior to the time of 
the adjourned meeting) shall be entitled to attend and vote 
thereat in respect of the number of shares registered in their 
name at that time. If the meeting is adjourned to a time not 
more than 48 hours after the Specified Time, that time will 
also apply for the purposes of determining the entitlement 
of members to attend and vote (and for the purposes of 
determining the number of votes they may cast) at the 
adjourned meeting. Changes to the Register after the 
relevant deadline shall be disregarded in determining  
rights to attend and vote.
4. If you have sold or transferred all your shares, this booklet 
and any accompanying documents (but not the 
personalised Form of Proxy or Form of Direction) should be 
passed to the person through whom the sale or transfer was 
made for transmission to the purchaser or transferee.
Voting
5. Voting on each of the Resolutions to be put to the AGM  
will be by poll, so that all shares voted are included, whether 
or not the shareholder is able to attend the meeting.  
The results of the voting at the meeting and the number  
of proxy votes cast for and against and the number of votes 
abstained in respect of each of the Resolutions proposed  
at the meeting will be announced to the London Stock 
Exchange as soon as practicable following the meeting  
and also will be published on the Company’s website  
www.drax.com.
6. Shareholders are reminded of their right under section 
360BA CA 2006 to request, within thirty days of the general 
meeting, information which enables them to determine that 
their vote on a poll at the general meeting was validly 
recorded and counted by the Company.
Questions at the meeting
7. 
The AGM is an opportunity for shareholders to ask questions 
of the Board in relation to the business of the AGM. The 
Company values shareholder feedback and is keen to ensure 
that this dialogue continues, despite the challenges faced 
by Covid-19 and Covid-19 related restrictions.
8. Questions for the Board can be submitted in advance or  
at the AGM through the Lumi platform. To enable the Board  
to address as many shareholder questions as possible, we 
would request that where possible, questions are submitted 
in advance of the AGM.
9. If multiple questions on the same topic are received in 
advance of the AGM, the Chair may choose to provide  
a single answer to address shareholder queries on the  
same topic.
10. Any member joining the meeting has the right to ask 
questions. The Company must cause to be answered any 
question relating to the business being dealt with at the 
meeting put by a member joining the meeting. However, 
members should note that no answer need be given in  
the following circumstances:
• if to do so would interfere unduly with the preparation of 
the meeting or would involve a disclosure of confidential 
information;
• if the answer has already been given on a website in the 
form of an answer to a question; or
• if it is undesirable in the interests of the Company or the 
good order of the meeting that the question be answered.
Appointment of proxies
11. If you are a member of the Company, at the time set out  
in note 3 above, you are entitled to appoint one or more 
proxies to exercise all or any of your rights to join and ask 
questions at the meeting. If a member appoints more than 
one proxy to join the meeting, each proxy must be appointed 
to exercise the rights attached to a different share or shares 
held by that member.
12. If a member wishes to appoint more than one proxy and so 
requires additional proxy forms, the member should contact 
the Company’s Registrars, Equiniti Limited, at Aspect House, 
Spencer Road, Lancing, West Sussex BN99 6DA or by using 
their telephone helpline service on 0371 384 2030 from 
within the UK or +44 121 415 7047 from outside the UK. 
Lines are open from 8.30am to 5.30pm, Monday to Friday 
– excluding public holidays in England and Wales.
 
 
Drax Group plc Notice of Annual General Meeting 2021 
9
13.  You can only appoint a proxy using the procedures set out  
in these notes and the notes on the Form of Proxy. A Form  
of Proxy is enclosed. To be effective, the Form of Proxy must 
be completed and signed and, together with the power of 
attorney or authority, if any, under which it is signed (or a 
duly certified copy of any such power or authority) must  
be lodged with the Company’s Registrars not later than  
48 hours, excluding non-business days, before the time  
of the meeting or must be lodged using the CREST proxy 
voting services (see note 15 below). 
14. In the case of joint holders, where more than one of the joint 
holders purports to appoint a proxy, only the appointment 
submitted by the most senior holder will be accepted. 
Seniority is determined by the order in which the names of 
the joint holders appear in the Register in respect of the joint 
holding (the first-named being deemed the most senior).
15. CREST members who wish to appoint a proxy or proxies by 
utilising the CREST electronic proxy appointment service 
may do so for the meeting and any adjournment(s) thereof 
utilising the procedures described in the CREST Manual 
(available via www.euroclear.com). CREST personal 
members or other CREST sponsored members, and those 
CREST members who have appointed a voting service 
provider(s), should refer to their CREST sponsor or voting 
service provider(s), who will be able to take the appropriate 
action on their behalf. In order for a proxy appointment  
or instruction made using the CREST service to be valid,  
the appropriate CREST message (a CREST Proxy Instruction) 
must be properly authenticated in accordance with 
Euroclear UK & Ireland Limited’s specifications and must 
contain the information required for such instructions,  
as described in the CREST Manual.
16. The message, regardless of whether it constitutes the 
appointment of a proxy or an amendment to the instruction 
given to a previously appointed proxy must, in order to be 
valid, be transmitted so as to be received by the issuer’s 
agent (Equiniti Limited CREST participant ID RA19) by the 
latest time(s) for receipt of proxy appointments specified  
in note 12 above. For this purpose the time of receipt will  
be taken to be the time (as determined by the timestamp 
applied to the message by the CREST applications Host) 
from which the issuer’s agent is able to retrieve the message 
by enquiry to CREST in the manner prescribed by CREST. 
After this time any change of instructions to proxies 
appointed through CREST should be communicated to  
the appointee through other means. CREST members and, 
where applicable, their CREST sponsors or voting service 
providers should note that Euroclear UK & Ireland Limited 
does not make available special procedures in CREST for any 
particular messages. Normal system timings and limitations 
will therefore apply in relation to the input of CREST Proxy 
Instructions. It is the responsibility of the CREST member 
concerned to take (or, if the CREST member is a CREST 
personal member or sponsored member or has appointed a 
voting service provider(s), to procure that his or her CREST 
sponsor or voting service provider(s) take(s)) such action as 
shall be necessary to ensure that a message is transmitted 
by means of the CREST system by any particular time.
17. In this connection, CREST members and, where applicable, 
their CREST sponsors or voting service providers are 
referred, in particular, to those sections of the CREST 
Manual concerning practical limitations of the CREST 
system and timings www.euroclear.com.
18.  The Company may treat as invalid a CREST proxy instruction 
in the circumstances set out in Regulation 35(5)(a) of the 
Uncertificated Securities Regulations 2001 (as amended).
19. A vote withheld is not a vote in law, which means that the 
vote will not be counted in the calculation of votes for or 
against the Resolution. If you either select the “discretionary” 
option or if no voting indication is given, your proxy will vote 
or abstain from voting at his or her discretion. Your proxy will 
vote (or abstain from voting) as he or she thinks fit in relation 
to any other matter which is put before the meeting.
20. If you are not a member of the Company but you have  
been nominated by a member of the Company to enjoy 
information rights, you do not have a right to appoint any 
proxies under the procedures set out in this “Appointment  
of proxies” section. Please read the section “Nominated 
persons” below.
Appointment of proxy electronically
21. Alternatively, members may register the appointment of  
a proxy for the meeting electronically by accessing the 
website www.sharevote.co.uk. You will need your Voting ID, 
Task ID and Shareholder Reference Number (this is the 
series of numbers printed on your Proxy Form). Alternatively, 
if you have already registered with Company’s Registrar’s 
online portfolio service, Shareview, you can submit your 
Proxy Form at www.shareview.co.uk using your usual user 
ID and password. Full instructions are given on both 
websites, which are operated by the Company’s Registrars.
22. The proxy appointment and any power of attorney or other 
authority under which the proxy appointment is made  
must be received by the Company’s Registrars not less than  
48 hours, excluding non-business days, before the time for 
holding the meeting or adjourned meeting or (in the case  
of a poll taken otherwise than at or on the same day as the 
meeting or adjourned meeting) for the taking of the poll at 
which it is to be used. Please note that any electronic 
communication sent to the Company or to the Company’s 
Registrars that is found to contain a computer virus will not 
be accepted. The use of the internet service in connection 
with the AGM is governed by the Company’s Registrars’ 
conditions of use set out on the Sharevote website,  
www.sharevote.co.uk, and may be read by logging on to  
that site. If you want to appoint more than one proxy 
electronically, please contact the Company’s Registrars  
on 0371 384 2030 from within the UK or +44 121 415 7047 
from outside the UK. Lines are open from 8.30am to 5.30pm, 
Monday to Friday – excluding public holidays in England  
and Wales.

Website giving information regarding the meeting
23. A copy of this Notice and other information required by 
Section 311A CA 2006 can be found on the Company’s 
website www.drax.com.
Changing proxy instructions
24. To change your proxy instructions simply submit a new 
proxy appointment. You will need to request a new Form  
of Proxy from the Company’s Registrars, Equiniti Limited, by 
contacting them at Aspect House, Spencer Road, Lancing, 
West Sussex BN99 6DA or by using their telephone helpline 
service on 0371 384 2030 from within the UK or +44 121 415 
7047 from outside the UK. Lines are open from 8.30am to 
5.30pm, Monday to Friday – excluding public holidays in 
England and Wales. Note that the cut-off time for receipt  
of Forms of Proxy (see note 22 above) also applies in relation 
to amended instructions; any amended proxy appointment 
received after the relevant cut-off time will be disregarded.
25. If you submit more than one valid proxy appointment in 
respect of a single share, the appointment received last 
before the latest time for the receipt of proxies will take 
precedence.
Nominated persons
26. Any person receiving a copy of this Notice of Meeting as a 
person nominated by a member to enjoy information rights 
under Section 146 CA 2006 (a Nominated Person) should 
note that the provisions in this Notice concerning the 
appointment of a proxy or proxies to attend the meeting  
in place of a member, do not apply to a Nominated Person  
as only shareholders have the right to appoint a proxy. 
However, a Nominated Person may have a right under an 
agreement between the Nominated Person and the member 
by whom he or she was nominated to be appointed, or to 
have someone else appointed, as a proxy for the meeting.  
If a Nominated Person has no such proxy appointment right, 
or does not wish to exercise it, he or she may have a right 
under such an agreement to give instructions to the 
member as to the exercise of voting rights at the meeting.  
If you are a person who has been nominated under Section 
146 CA 2006 to enjoy information rights:
• you may have a right under an agreement between you 
and the member of the Company who has nominated  
you to have information rights (Relevant Member) to be 
appointed or to have someone else appointed as a proxy 
for the meeting; and
• if you either do not have such a right or if you have such  
a right but do not wish to exercise it, you may have a right 
under an agreement between you and the Relevant 
Member to give instructions to the Relevant Member  
as to the exercise of voting rights. Nominated Persons 
should also remember that their main point of contact  
in terms of their investment in the Company remains the 
member who nominated the Nominated Person to enjoy 
information rights (or, perhaps the custodian or broker 
who administers the investment on their behalf). 
Nominated Persons should continue to contact that 
member, custodian or broker (and not the Company) 
regarding any changes or queries relating to the 
Nominated Person’s personal details and interest in the 
Company (including any administrative matter). The only 
exception to this is where the Company expressly 
requests a response from a Nominated Person.
Issued shares and total voting rights
27. As at 10 March 2021, being the latest practicable date prior 
to the publication of this Notice, the Company’s issued share 
capital comprised 411,725,609 ordinary shares of 11 16/29 
pence each. Each ordinary share carries the right to one 
vote at a general meeting of the Company. The Company 
holds 13,841,295 shares in treasury, therefore the total 
number of voting rights in the Company is the 397,884,314.
28. This Notice, together with information about the total 
numbers of shares in the Company in respect of which 
members are entitled to exercise voting rights at the

date prior to the publication of this Notice and, if applicable, 
any members’ statements, members’ resolutions or 
members’ matters of business received by the Company 
after the date of this Notice, will be available on the 
Company’s website www.drax.com.
Website publication of audit concerns
29. Under Section 527 CA 2006, members meeting the 
threshold requirements set out in that Section have the 
right to require the Company to publish on a website a 
statement setting out any matter relating to the audit of  
the Company’s accounts (including the auditor’s report  
and the conduct of the audit) that are to be laid before the 
meeting; or any circumstance connected with an auditor  
of the Company ceasing to hold office since the previous 
meeting at which annual accounts and reports were laid  
in accordance with Section 437 CA 2006.
30. The Company may not require the members requesting any 
such website publication to pay its expenses in complying 
with Sections 527 or 528 CA 2006. Where the Company  
is required to place a statement on a website under Section 
527 CA 2006, it must forward the statement to the 
Company’s auditor not later than the time when it makes  
the statement available on the website. The business which 
may be dealt with at the meeting includes any statement 
that the Company has been required under Section 527  
CA 2006 to publish on a website.

meeting the threshold requirements in those sections have 
the right to require the Company to: 
• give, to members of the Company entitled to receive

properly be moved and is intended to be moved at the 
meeting; and/or
• include in the business to be dealt with at the meeting  
any matter (other than a proposed resolution) which may 
be properly included in the business. A resolution may 
properly be moved or a matter may properly be included  
in the business unless (a) (in the case of a resolution only) 
it would, if passed, be ineffective (whether by reason  
of inconsistency with any enactment or the Company’s 
constitution or otherwise), (b) it is defamatory of any 
person, or (c) it is frivolous or vexatious. 
35. Such a request may be in hard copy form or in electronic 
form, must identify the resolution of which notice is to  
be given or the matter to be included in the business, must 
be authorised by the person or persons making it, must be 
received by the Company not later than the date which is six 
clear weeks before the meeting, and (in the case of a matter 
to be included in the business only) must be accompanied 
by a statement setting out the grounds for the request.

Appendix 1 
Articles of Association 2021
Resolution 17
Adoption of New Articles
Details of the principal changes being proposed in the New 
Articles are summarised below. 
Share warrants to bearer
The provisions relating to bearer shares have been removed 
from the Current Articles pursuant to The Small Business, 
Enterprise and Employment Act 2015 (SBEEA 2015), which 
received Royal Assent on 26 March 2015. The SBEEA 2015 
reformed the bearer share regime, including prohibiting the 
creation of new bearer shares at any time on or after 26 May 
2015, and requiring all existing bearer shares to be surrendered 
for conversion into registered shares during a 9 month 
transitional period, which commenced on 26 May 2015.
Share certificates sent at holder’s risk
Article 12 was added to provide that a share certificate is sent  
at the risk of the holder and that the Company is not responsible 
for a share certificate which is lost or delayed in the course  
of delivery.
Untraced members
The New Articles amend the position in relation to untraced 
shareholders. Rather than requiring the Company to take out 
two newspaper advertisements, the New Articles require the 
Company to use reasonable efforts to trace the shareholder. 
‘Reasonable efforts’ to trace a shareholder may include, if 
considered appropriate, the Company engaging a professional 
asset reunification company or other tracing agent to search  
for a shareholder who has not kept their shareholder details  
up to date. 
In addition, the New Articles provide, at article 34, that money 
from the sale of the shares of an untraced shareholder will  
be forfeited if not claimed after two years. These changes 
reflect best practice and provide the Company with appropriate 
flexibility in connection with locating untraced shareholders.
Sub-division of shares
The New Articles clarify that any shares resulting from a 
sub-division of the Company’s existing shares may, in addition  
to having any preference or advantage as compared with the 
Company’s other shares, also have deferred or other rights.  
This change makes administering any sub-division of shares 
more straightforward. 
Operation of general meetings
The New Articles are intended to allow (but do not require) the 
Company to hold “hybrid” or “satellite” general meetings in times 
where physical participation may be prevented or restricted. 
Such meetings would provide shareholders with the option  
to attend and participate in person (in the main location or  
in specified satellite locations) or virtually by electronic means.  
It is not the current intention of the Board to routinely hold 
combined physical and electronic general meetings and such 
meetings will only be held if the Board is confident that the 
Company has sufficient technology in place at the relevant  
time to hold and conduct such meetings in an orderly fashion. 
Absent exceptional circumstances, members of the Board 
intend to continue the practice of attending general meetings 
of the Company in person.
In line with the views expressed by institutional shareholder 
bodies, the changes will not permit meetings to be held 
exclusively on an electronic basis, so a physical meeting will  
still be required.
These changes were introduced to provide the Board greater 
flexibility to align with technological advances, changes in 
investor sentiment and evolving best practice, particularly  
in light of the Covid-19 outbreak.
These changes are primarily contained in articles 50, 51 and 53, 
57 and 61 in the New Articles. A number of other consequential 
amendments have been made to the New Articles. 
President
The provisions relating to the appointment and duties of a 
President have been removed from the New Articles as the 
Company has not, nor intends to, make use of these provisions. 
Retirement and re-appointment of directors
In line with the requirements of the Code, the New Articles 
require directors to retire (and should they wish to remain  
in office, seek re-election) at each annual general meeting.  
This requirement does not apply to directors in their first year  
of appointment who were appointed in the period between  
the AGM notice being issued and the AGM itself. This confirms 
existing Company practice.

Drax Group plc Notice of Annual General Meeting 2021
Directors’ fees
The Board feels it is appropriate to increase the cap on director 
remuneration (Director Fee Cap). Under the Current Articles, the 
Director Fee Cap is set at £1,000,000 per annum. By increasing 
the cap to £1,500,000 per annum, the Company will have greater 
flexibility to implement the most appropriate remuneration  
as part of its continued growth. The increase will also provide 
sufficient head-room to enable the Board to execute any 
succession plans for the future. The Board is satisfied that  
this new fee cap is in-keeping with current market practice. 
Associate Directors
The provisions relating to the appointment of ‘Associate 
Directors’ have been removed from the New Articles as the 
Company has not, nor intends to, make use of these provisions. 
Strategic report and supplementary materials 
The Companies Act 2006 and the Companies (Receipt of 
Accounts and Reports) Regulations 2013 allow the Company to 
send a copy of its strategic report with supplementary material 
instead of its full accounts to a member who has elected or 
tacitly agreed to receive these documents, provided that the 
Company is not prohibited from doing so in its articles. Article 
146 is intended to make it clear there is no such prohibition. 
Shareholders should note that they can always view the full 
annual report on the Company’s website or request a hard copy 
from the Company’s Registrar. 
Notices
The requirement for the Company to provide notices or other 
documents to shareholders on three consecutive occasions 
before a member ceases to be entitled to receive notices or 
other documents has been reduced to two consecutive 
occasions in order to decrease the related administrative  
cost on the Company. 
The Current Articles were amended to enable the Company  
to determine to send hard copies only to some or all members  
in order to cater for any potential securities law issues with 
sending documents electronically to overseas shareholders  
in certain circumstances. 
General 
The opportunity has also been taken to make a number of  
small technical or tidy up amendments to the Current Articles. 
Changes which are of a minor, technical or clarifying nature  
or which have been made to remove provisions in the Current 
Articles which duplicate English company law are not noted. 
The New Articles also contain a number of non-substantive 
stylistic and grammatical changes (for instance, to replace the 
term ‘Chairman’ with gender neutral references to the ‘Chair’).
