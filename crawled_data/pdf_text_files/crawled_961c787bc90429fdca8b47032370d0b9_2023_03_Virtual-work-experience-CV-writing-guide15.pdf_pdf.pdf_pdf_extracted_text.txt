Your CV 
The cornerstone of  
your application 
A good CV is the first step towards getting a job and 
building your career. 
Use this guidance and our template for creating your 
CV for work experience, apprenticeship, internship or 
graduate job applications.
 
And don’t forget the CV’s ally, the covering letter – see 
our separate covering letter guide. 
A CV tells employers what you’ve done and what you can do. It covers your skills, your experience and your 
qualifications. Along with your covering letter, your CV’s often all employers have to go on when they compare 
you with other applicants. 
Because of this, it’s crucial that your CV makes you stand out from the crowd. Your CV needs to cover key 
information and show you’re suitable for the advertised role. It also needs to look professional and be easy to read. 
There are lots of different ways to present your CV, but this guide shows a clear and logical structure specifically 
designed for early careers roles. Use it as a framework for your work experience, apprenticeship, internship or 
graduate job applications.
As obvious as it sounds, your CV needs to tell employers who you are and how to contact you.
Include your personal and contact details clearly at the top of your CV’s first page. Don’t let them take up too 
much space. Include your: 
• 
Full name
• 
Email address (use a sensible address and not a novelty one – set up a new one if you need to)
• 
Landline/mobile telephone number
• 
Location (there’s no need to show your full postal address but include your town at least)
 
Don’t include your date of birth, marital status or gender.
What is a CV and why’s it  
so important?
Your CV’s sections
Introduction
Personal and contact details
This section’s optional, but it can be an eye-catching way to introduce yourself, highlight your suitability 
and show your passion. Use short, summarised examples of your experience, skills and interests to give your 
statement credibility. 
If you want to include examples but can’t fit them in here, feature them in your covering letter.
 
Your personal statement should:
• 
Appear at the top of your CV
• 
Contain 2-4 sentences and use a maximum of 80 words
• 
Summarise your current situation and explain what you’re looking for from your next position
• 
Avoid cliché words or phrases (like hardworking, dynamic, team player)
• 
Be tailored for each role you apply for
• 
Be upbeat!
Overlay your own skills with the ones listed in the job advert and list the common skills (and other related ones) 
here to show how well suited you are. You’ll need to tailor this section for each application as different job 
adverts ask for different skills. 
Key skills might be ‘soft’ (like communication and teamwork), technical (like software- or platform-specific ones) 
or a combination of the two. 
List the skills with brief explanations if necessary – but don’t go into too much detail at this point.
Personal statement

Following instructions
Teamwork

Exercise
Summarise your education and qualifications, starting with the most recent and working backwards. 
Include any further and higher education courses and qualifications (anything after the age of 16). State the name 
of the school, college or university, the title of the programme and the year you earned it or expect to earn it.
 
Summarise any qualifications you earned at school.
 
If you’ve got lots of relevant work experience (see Work experience and employment history section) you might 
want to keep this section brief. Otherwise, you can include more detail on relevant modules or topics you’ve 
studied which are particularly relevant to the role you’re applying for.
List any awards or honours you earned during your time in education or in external extra-curricular activities. 
These might include competitions you’ve won or positions of responsibility you’ve been given. 
Work experience and employment history 
You might think you haven’t got much work experience yet. But it’s easy to overlook things that recruiters would 
be keen to know about. Include: 
• 
Student work experience
• 
Work shadowing
• 
Internships
• 
Voluntary work
• 
Part-time or temporary jobs or placements
 
List the most recent experience first and work backwards. Include: 
• 
The dates you were employed
• 
Your role
• 
The employer or company name
• 
A sentence or two summarising your responsibilities and the skills you showed, with additional bullet points 
for more detail
• 
Evidence for claims you make about skills development or achievements – use real examples
Education and qualifications
Achievements
Give the employer an idea of what you’re like and what you enjoy outside work. This is the chance to let your 
personality shine through on your CV. So, mention hobbies and interests (keep it appropriate!) and particularly 
highlight any interests that align with the company, industry or specialism.
 
You might want to include details of: 
• 
Sports teams you’re part of
• 
Societies or clubs you belong to
• 
Your travels
• 
Other creative or productive hobbies you spend time doing
Be specific (do you train or compete weekly?) to show passion and commitment, and make sure you reference any 
responsibilities and/or achievements.
Hobbies and interests
List two people (‘referees’) for the recruiter to contact. It’s up to you whether you include contact details. You might 
want to leave them our if the referee is a current employer, or if you’d prefer to contact the referee first. 
Let your referees know you’re using them in your job search so they’re not surprised if they get a call or email.
 
Alternatively, you can note that ‘References are available on request’ so the recruiter knows you’re willing and 
prepared to provide them.
• 
Use a widely supported file format like a Word doc. or PDF 
• 
Make sure your CV isn’t longer than two pages 
• 
Don’t rush writing it – take your time to build the core elements of your CV over time 
• 
Use a font and type size that’s easy to read 
• 
Use bullet points and numbering to help make lists clear 
• 
Pay attention to formatting – make sure: 
 
- Text aligns where it should 
- Headings are consistent in style 
- There aren’t too many different fonts or type sizes 
• 
Make section titles clear 
• 
When listing experiences, start with the most recent first and work backwards 
• 
Frontload your CV with the most relevant parts – highlight on the job advert the key requirements and 
make sure you evidence them on your CV’s first page 
• 
Check, double check and triple check! 
 
- Read your CV out loud to check it makes sense and has a logical flow 
- Proofread for spelling and grammar mistakes as well as using your software’s spellcheck function 
- Print it and check it again – you might see something you didn’t on-screen 
- Ask someone else – a friend or family member – to check it too 
- Above all, make sure your own details are accurate!
