This quarter’s issue looks at how the weather is increasingly affecting the power system.  
Britain’s renewables are once again breaking records, with Quarter 1 seeing wind, biomass 
and hydro all register their highest energy production (see Article 2).  At the end of March, 
solar also recorded its highest ever peak output, reducing demand on the national grid so far 
that afternoon demand fell below overnight levels for the first time ever.  Article 3 explores 
how solar power affects the rest of the system, and how power stations are having to 
change their daily schedules in response.
Coal output fell 30% from this time last year due to high wind output and the mild winter.  
Carbon emissions were 10% lower than in Q1 2016 as a result.  Britain’s electricity has 
changed so radically that the generation mix in the dirtiest hour of this quarter was lower 
carbon than the average electricity produced between 2009 and 2013 (see Article 4).
The weather is also changing the gross consumption of electricity.  Britain experienced 
another mild winter, reducing the need for electric heat in homes and workplaces.   
Article 5 looks at how this saves both money and carbon, but cannot be relied on to keep  
the lights on when capacity is in short supply.
The growth of weather-driven renewables and the increasing volatility of power prices  
have made the timing of electricity production more important and highly valued.   
Article 6 explores how much the market pays for electricity from different technologies,  
and why electricity from flexible and controllable generators is worth more.   
Finally, Article 7 summarises the statistics for the quarter.

All forms of renewable energy had a record breaking quarter to start off the year.  Britain’s 
wind farms made the news for recording their highest ever quarterly output.  Behind the 
scenes, biomass and hydro power stations also produced more than ever before, and solar 
power reached a new high for its peak output. 
The weather helped wind farms to beat the previous production record (set in 2015) by more 
than 10%, generating 11.3 TWh over the quarter.  Half of this gain came from new farms being 
built, as installed capacity grew 5% in the last year.  Wind farms produced more electricity 
than coal on 57 out of the 90 days this quarter, and wind power has now beaten coal over 
the last four consecutive quarters.
Biomass hit a new high of 4.4 TWh, meaning the fleet ran at 95% of full capacity over the 
quarter: higher than any other technology has achieved in the last 10 years.1  Hydro power 
also had a record quarter hitting 1.6 TWh; 4% above its previous best in 2014.  Finally, at the 
end of March solar reached a new peak output of 7.67 GW – enough to power a fifth of the 
country at the time.
Compared with last year, gas power stations saw the biggest increase in output, followed 
closely by wind.  Coal was the biggest loser, down by 30% on last year, and imports from 
France were also much lower as the damaged interconnector didn’t return to full power until 
February.  The net impact of all these changes was a 2.6 million tonne fall in CO2 emissions.

Britain’s nuclear fleet rarely exceeds 85% availability due to its age. The coal and gas fleets typically produce 30–60% of their full capacity over 
the year as their output varies in line with demand; the whole fleet only runs close to full output at peak times.

In the last weekend of March demand on the national grid was lower during the daytime 
than it was overnight – the first time this has ever happened.  Prior to solar power becoming 
widespread, minimum demand was always seen during the night.  Daytime demand never 
came within 5 GW of the night-time minimum; but in 2015 the gap narrowed to 2.4 GW,  
and on the 25th of March it disappeared completely.  
Solar panels and smaller onshore wind farms are ‘invisible’ as they do not connect into the 
transmission system.  Distributed solar panels carve a large chunk of demand out of the 
middle of the day, reducing the need for major power stations.  But the sun isn’t shining 
when factories and offices power up in the morning, or when people settle down at home 
for the evening. During March, demand net of renewables was 2.3 GW higher at 9 AM than 
at 1 PM, when solar panels reach their peak output.  This gap will likely double by June based 
on data from past years.  This effect is splitting the long daytime plateau (grey line in the 
chart, below left) into two separate peaks (black line).
Power stations are having to change their operating patterns to cope with this.  Many 
stations ‘two shift’, turning on in the morning and off again at night.  These might have to 
start up twice a day (‘double two shifting’ perhaps) to cope with separate peaks.  5 GW of 
gas stations are already turning down in the middle of the day, soon they may have to start 
turning off completely. 
Flexibility is needed at short notice in the morning and evening peaks due to the speed 
of ramping up and down, the short duration of the peak, and the fact that solar output is 
still relatively hard to forecast in advance.  Technologies that are flexible and offer rapid 
response, such as gas or battery storage, will help accommodate these changes.

Britain’s continuing decarbonisation
Q1 carbon emissions from electricity generation are down 10% on last year and 33% on the 
year before.  As a sign of just how far British electricity has changed, the ‘dirtiest hour’ in the 
whole of this winter was lower carbon than the average generation mix just three years ago.
The carbon intensity of electricity averaged 284 g/kWh this quarter.  It ranged from just 102 
g/kWh on a windy Sunday night in March to 424 g/kWh on a cold and calm January evening 
when coal output was high.  424 grams of CO2 would have seemed clean just a few years ago: 
the average from 2009 to 2013 was 471 g/kWh.  Now it is the extremity.
Since 2013, the carbon intensity of electricity has fallen by 66 g/kWh each year.  The reason 
for this is clear in the chart below: coal stands out as by far the highest-carbon source of 
electricity, but coal output has fallen 82% in the last four years.  The 21st of April was the first 
time since 1882 that Britain burnt no coal for electricity all day.  
Coal has been replaced by mid-carbon gas, low-carbon biomass and imports, and zero-
carbon wind and solar.  Together these have driven electricity decarbonisation in line with 
(or even slightly ahead of) the country’s decarbonisation targets – which are the most 
ambitious in the world.

Britain has again experienced a mild winter, keeping down electricity bills and carbon 
emissions.  2017 has so far been 1.9°C warmer than the 20th century average, lowering the 
country’s demand for electric heating.  
Similarly, winter 2015/16 was the mildest for 150 years, meaning electricity demand over 
the winter months was just 12 TWh higher than in the neighbouring summers.2  In contrast, 
demand was 26 TWh higher in the winter of 2009/10, which was the coldest for a generation. 
Comparing these, over 14 TWh of electricity didn’t need to be generated in 2015/16 because 
of the mild weather, in addition to savings from efficiency and other factors that brought the 
long-term average down.
This mild weather translates into a windfall of around £650 million that didn’t need to be 
spent on generating electricity.3  Most of this reduced consumption comes from households 
and businesses – so the saving to end consumers would be at least double this, as they pay 
more per unit of electricity.  The environment also benefits, as CO2 emissions were 4.4 MT 
lower thanks to the weather.4
Mild winters also reduce the peak demand for electricity.  This has fallen from 60.1 GW in 
2009/10 to just 52.0 GW in 2015/16, making it easier to ‘keep the lights on’ at a time when 
much of the country’s capacity is retiring.  Britain’s weather is far from reliable though,  
so demand can change drastically from one winter to the next.

People often assess the economics of power stations with their Levelised Cost of 
Electricity, but it also matters how and when the electricity is produced.5  The growing 
share of weather-dependent renewables means that flexible and controllable capacity is 
now more valuable to the system.  As power prices become more volatile, the range of prices 
earned by different technologies is widening.  
The bar chart below shows the average day-ahead market price, weighted by the half-hourly 
output of each technology.  Rather than showing the cost of production, this shows what 
electricity from each technology is ‘worth’ to the system.6  Over the last two years, the 
average wholesale price has barely changed, but the premium for producing electricity 
when it is most needed is growing, as is the penalty for producing when it is not wanted.

The Levelised Cost of Electricity (LCOE) divides a station’s total capital and operating costs (discounted over time to reflect interest) by the 
discounted value of its output to give a single measure of its average cost.
6 This is not what each technology actually earned as only 5% of power is traded on the spot market at these prices.  Most power is bought and 
sold on long term contracts months ahead of delivery (at prices not made public).
7 
The time-weighted price (average of all half-hourly prices in a year) is what people see as the average price; but the energy-weighted price 
(each half-hour’s price multiplied by the amount of electricity consumed) is what they end up paying.  The energy-weighted price is 4% higher 
than time-weighted.
What are different electricity sources worth?
The range of prices that technologies command can be explained by the different roles they 
play.  Peaking plants run only when demand (and price) is highest, as they need to cover their 
start-up and running costs.  Mid-merit plants instead run most of the time, flexing up and 
down in line with demand.  Coal recently switched from being mid-merit to peaking as it was 
undercut by gas, and so their positions change between the two charts. 
Baseload plants run day and night regardless of price.  Nuclear reactors cannot turn down 
easily, and although biomass plants are flexible they choose to run baseload because of 
the support they receive.  Wind and solar push down power prices when their output is 
high, even sending prices negative when they produce too much for the grid to handle.  
Understandably, they earn less than average once a large capacity is installed.
  
Prices on the wholesale market price are one thing; but the costs of transmission, balancing 
and providing peak capacity means the whole-system cost of providing the electricity we 
use is altogether different.  The key to restraining this overall cost is having a good balance 
of technologies to choose from.

Following their problems last quarter, the French interconnector and nuclear fleet returned 
to normal, so imports gradually rose over February and hit an 12-month high in March 
averaging 2.9 GW (1.8 GW of which from France).  Coal fell from 16% to 6% of the supply mix 
over February as imports rose and demand fell.  
Coal output is down nearly 30%; not because plants are seeing lower utilisation, rather 
because three tenths of the fleet have retired in the last year.  In their place, 3.2 GW of new 
renewables came online in the past year, predominantly solar power.  
Power prices settled down from the volatility of previous quarters, suggesting the market 
was not so tight.  They averaged £47/MWh and ranged from –£14 to £293 over the quarter.8

10 See the methodology note in last quarter’s issue for how wind capacity factors are adjusted, as the output data from National Grid and Elexon may not cover the entire fleet.  The raw data from National Grid and Elexon 
suggests that the capacity factor for wind was 34.7% over Q1 2017, versus 28.3% over Q1 2016.
