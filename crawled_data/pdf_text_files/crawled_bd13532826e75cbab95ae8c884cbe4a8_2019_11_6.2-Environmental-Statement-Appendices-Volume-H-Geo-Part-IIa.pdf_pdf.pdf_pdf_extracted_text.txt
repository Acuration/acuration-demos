Published 1877
Source map scale - 1:2,500
The historical maps shown were reproduced from maps predominantly held 
at the scale adopted for England, Wales and Scotland in the 1840`s. In 1854 
the 1:2,500 scale was adopted for mapping urban areas and by 1896 it 
covered the whole of what were considered to be the cultivated parts of Great
Britain. The published date given below is often some years later than the 
surveyed date. Before 1938, all OS maps were based on the Cassini 
Projection, with independent surveys of a single county or group of counties, 
giving rise to significant inaccuracies in outlying areas.

Source map scale - 1:2,500
SUSI maps (Supply of Unpublished Survey Information) were produced 
between 1972 and 1977, mainly for internal use at Ordnance Survey. These 
were more of a `work-in-progress' plan as they showed updates of individual 
areas on a map. These maps were unpublished, and they do not represent a 
single moment in time. They were produced at both 1:2,500 and 1:1,250 
scales.

Britain. The published date given below is often some years later than the 
surveyed date. Before 1938, all OS maps were based on the Cassini 
Projection, with independent surveys of a single county or group of counties, 
giving rise to significant inaccuracies in outlying areas.

The SIM cards (Ordnance Survey's `Survey of Information on Microfilm') are 
further, minor editions of mapping which were produced and published in 
between the main editions as an area was updated. They date from 1947 to 
1994, and contain detailed information on buildings, roads and land-use. 
These maps were produced at both 1:2,500 and 1:1,250 scales.

Large-Scale National Grid Data
Published 1993
Source map scale - 1:2,500
'Large Scale National Grid Data' superseded SIM cards (Ordnance Survey's 
'Survey of Information on Microfilm') in 1992, and continued to be produced 
until 1999. These maps were the fore-runners of digital mapping and so 
provide detailed information on houses and roads, but tend to show less 
topographic features such as vegetation. These maps were produced at both 
1:2,500 and 1:1,250 scales.

The historical maps shown were reproduced from maps predominantly held 
at the scale adopted for England, Wales and Scotland in the 1840`s. In 1854 
the 1:2,500 scale was adopted for mapping urban areas and by 1896 it 
covered the whole of what were considered to be the cultivated parts of Great
Britain. The published date given below is often some years later than the 
surveyed date. Before 1938, all OS maps were based on the Cassini 
Projection, with independent surveys of a single county or group of counties,

Projection, with independent surveys of a single county or group of counties,

Ordnance Survey Plan
Published 1961
Source map scale - 1:2,500
The historical maps shown were reproduced from maps predominantly held 
at the scale adopted for England, Wales and Scotland in the 1840`s. In 1854 
the 1:2,500 scale was adopted for mapping urban areas and by 1896 it 
covered the whole of what were considered to be the cultivated parts of Great
Britain. The published date given below is often some years later than the 
surveyed date. Before 1938, all OS maps were based on the Cassini 
Projection, with independent surveys of a single county or group of counties, 
giving rise to significant inaccuracies in outlying areas.

Supply of Unpublished Survey 
Information
Published 1975
Source map scale - 1:2,500
SUSI maps (Supply of Unpublished Survey Information) were produced 
between 1972 and 1977, mainly for internal use at Ordnance Survey. These 
were more of a `work-in-progress' plan as they showed updates of individual 
areas on a map. These maps were unpublished, and they do not represent a 
single moment in time. They were produced at both 1:2,500 and 1:1,250 
scales.

further, minor editions of mapping which were produced and published in 
between the main editions as an area was updated. They date from 1947 to 
1994, and contain detailed information on buildings, roads and land-use. 
These maps were produced at both 1:2,500 and 1:1,250 scales.

Large-Scale National Grid Data
Published 1993
Source map scale - 1:2,500
'Large Scale National Grid Data' superseded SIM cards (Ordnance Survey's 
'Survey of Information on Microfilm') in 1992, and continued to be produced 
until 1999. These maps were the fore-runners of digital mapping and so 
provide detailed information on houses and roads, but tend to show less 
topographic features such as vegetation. These maps were produced at both 
1:2,500 and 1:1,250 scales.

Geology 1:10,000 Maps
This report contains geological map extracts taken from the BGS 
Digital Geological map of Great Britain at 1:10,000 scale and is 
designed for users carrying out preliminary site assessments who 
require geological maps for the area around a site. This mapping 
may be more up to date than previously published paper maps.
The various geological layers - artificial and landslip deposits, 
superficial geology and solid (bedrock) geology are displayed in 
separate maps, but superimposed on the final 'Combined Surface 
Geology' map. All map legends feature on this page.
Please Note: Not all of the layers have complete nationwide 
coverage, so availability of data for relevant map sheets is 
indicated below.

Artificial Ground and Landslip
Artificial ground is a term used by BGS for those areas where the 
ground surface has been significantly modified by human activity. 
Information about previously developed ground is especially 
important, as it is often associated with potentially contaminated 
material, unpredictable engineering conditions and unstable 
ground.
Artificial ground includes: 
- Made ground - man-made deposits such as embankments and 
spoil heaps on the natural ground surface.
- Worked ground - areas where the ground has been cut away 
such as quarries and road cuttings.
- Infilled ground - areas where the ground has been cut away then 
wholly or partially backfilled.
- Landscaped ground - areas where the surface has been 
reshaped.
- Disturbed ground - areas of ill-defined shallow or near surface 
mineral workings where it is impracticable to map made and 
worked ground separately.
Mass movement (landslip) deposits on BGS geological maps are 
primarily superficial deposits that have moved down slope under 
gravity to form landslips. These affect bedrock, other superficial 
deposits and artificial ground. The dataset also includes foundered
strata, where the ground has collapsed due to subsidence.

Superficial Geology
BGS 1:10,000 Superficial Deposits are the youngest geological 
deposits formed during the most recent period of geological time, 
which extends back about 1.8 million years from the present. 
They rest on older deposits or rocks referred to as Bedrock. This 
dataset contains Superficial deposits that are of natural origin and 
'in place'. Other superficial strata may be held in the Mass 
Movement dataset where they have been moved, or in the Artificial
Ground dataset where they are of man-made origin.
Most of these Superficial deposits are unconsolidated sediments 
such as gravel, sand, silt and clay, and onshore they form 
relatively thin, often discontinuous patches or larger spreads.

Bedrock and Faults
Bedrock geology is a term used for the main mass of rocks 
forming the Earth and are present everywhere, whether exposed at
the surface in outcrops or concealed beneath superficial deposits 
or water. 
The bedrock has formed over vast lengths of geological time 
ranging from ancient and highly altered rocks of the Proterozoic, 
some 2500 million years ago, or older, up to the relatively young 
Pliocene, 1.8 million years ago.
The bedrock geology includes many lithologies, often classified 
into three types based on origin: igneous, metamorphic and 
sedimentary.
The BGS Faults and Rock Segments dataset includes 
geological faults and thin beds mapped as lines such as coal 
seams and mineral veins. These are not restricted by age and 
could relate to features of any of the 1:10,000 geology datasets.

The Combined Surface Geology map combines all the previous 
maps into one combined geological overview of your site. 
Please consult the legends to the previous maps to interpret the 
Combined "Surface Geology" map.
More information on 1:10,000 Geological mapping and 
explanations of rock classifications can be found on the BGS 
website. Using the LEX Codes in this report, further descriptions of
rock types can be obtained by interrogating the 'BGS Lexicon of 
Named Rock Units'. This database can be accessed by following 
the 'Information and Data' link on the BGS website.
