The SofS recommends that the ES should include a description
of how waste generated by the proposed development will be
dealt with.
Chapter 15 of the ES explains how waste generated from the
Project will be dealt with.

The SofS also recommends that the potential impacts of electric
and magnetic fields are addressed within the ES.
Electromagnetic fields are scoped out of the assessment
because underground cables such as that proposed for the
Electrical Connection do not give rise to electromagnetic fields
above ground due to the shielding effect of the cable sheath.
The public would thus not be exposed to electromagnetic fields
from the proposed underground cables. Further detail is
provided in Chapter 4 of the ES.

The SofS would expect the ES to include a section that
summarises the site and surroundings. This would identify the
context of the proposed development, any relevant designations
and sensitive receptors. This section should identify land that
could be directly or indirectly affected by the proposed
development and any auxiliary facilities, landscaping areas and
potential off site mitigation or compensation schemes.
A full description of the Project and its surroundings is included
in Chapter 3 of the ES.

The applicant should be aware however, that the description of
the development in the ES must be sufficiently certain to meet
the requirements of paragraph 17 of Schedule 4 Part 1 of the
EIA Regulations and there should therefore be more certainty by
the time the ES is submitted with the DCO.
A table is included in the ES which demonstrates compliance
with EIA Regulations (Table 1.1).  Chapter 3 includes a
description of the Project.

The applicant should clearly define what elements of the
proposed development are integral to the NSIP and which is
‘associated development’ under the Planning Act 2008 (PA
2008) or is an ancillary matter.
Associated development is not permitted in DCOs in Wales.  All
aspects of the Project are integral and therefore no associated
development is included in the application (see Explanatory
Memorandum, Document Reference 3.2).
5
SofS (Scoping
Opinion,
para.3.49)
The SofS recommends that the ES should include a clear
description of all aspects of the proposed development, at the
construction, operation and decommissioning stages, and
include: land use requirements; site preparation; construction
processes and methods; transport routes; operational
requirements including the main characteristics or the production
process and the nature and quantity of material used; transport
routes; maintenance activities including any potential
environmental impacts; emissions - water, air and soil pollution,
noise, vibration, light, heat, radiation.
Chapter 3 of the ES provides a full description of the Project.
Each topic Chapter provides a description of all aspects of the
Project and their potential impact in relation to that topic.

SofS (Scoping
Opinion,
para.2.50)
The environmental effects of all wastes to be processed and
removed from the site should be addressed. The ES will need to
identify and describe the control processes and mitigation
procedures for storing and transporting waste off site. All waste
types should be quantified and classified.
Chapter 15 of the ES details the effects of all wastes to be
processed and removed from the site.

The SofS notes, from the comments in paragraph 3.3.14 of the
Scoping Report, that the detailed design and location of the
power station is still being developed. The applicant should
make every attempt to narrow the range of options and explain
clearly in the ES which elements of the scheme have yet to be
finalised and provide the reasons. At the time of application, any
proposed scheme parameters should not be so wide ranging as
to represent effectively different schemes.

The scheme parameters will need to be clearly defined in the
draft DCO and therefore in the accompanying ES. It is a matter
for the applicant, in preparing an ES, to consider whether it is
possible to robustly assess a range of impacts resulting from a
large number of undecided parameters. The description of the
proposed development in the ES must not be so wide that it is
insufficiently certain to comply with the requirements of
paragraph 17 of Schedule 4 Part 1 of the EIA Regulations.
See Chapter 3 of the ES which sets out the ‘worst case’ scenario
assessed in terms of size (height, width and depth of all
structures), type of Gas Turbine Generator and land take. Each
topic chapter of the ES sets out the worst case parameters for
assessment.

The Secretary of State notes that no information has been
provided in the Scoping Request regarding the size and exact
location of the temporary laydown area. Whilst is it appreciated
that this information may not be available at this stage in the
evolution of the project, applicants are reminded that this

The Laydown Area is approximately 3 ha in size and will be
located to the west of the Generating Equipment Site (see
Chapter 3 of the ES and the Works Plans, Document Reference

The SofS considers that information on construction including:
phasing of programme; construction methods and activities
associated with each phase; siting of construction compounds
(including on and off site); lighting equipment/requirements; and
number, movements and parking of construction vehicles (both
HGVs and staff) should be clearly indicated in the ES.
See Chapter 3 of the ES which describes the aspects requested
by the SofS.

SofS (Scoping
Opinion,
para.2.60)
Information on the operation and maintenance of the proposed
development should be included in the ES and should cover but
not be limited to such matters as: the number of full/part-time
jobs; the operational hours and if appropriate, shift patterns; the
operational stage.
The operational and maintenance activities are described in
Chapter 3 of the ES.  Operational and maintenance activities are
also assessed in the topic chapters where relevant.

The SofS would suggest that the applicant ensures that
appropriate consultation is undertaken with the relevant
consultees in order to agree wherever possible the timing and
relevance of survey work as well as the methodologies to be
used.
Consultation was carried out prior to, and following, the issue of
the PEIR where required. This included discussions on the
methodology for each topic and in particular the timing of the
noise survey.  See Consultation Report (Document Reference:
5.1.0) for details.
2
SofS (Scoping
Opinion,
para.3.5)
The SofS recommends that the physical scope of the study
areas should be identified under all the environmental topics and
should be sufficiently robust in order to undertake the
assessment. The extent of the study areas should be on the
basis of recognised professional guidance, whenever such
guidance is available. The study areas should also be agreed
with the relevant consultees and, where this is not possible, this
should be stated clearly in the ES and a reasoned justification
given. The scope should also cover the breadth of the topic area
and the temporal scope, and these aspects should be described
and justified.
See Section 5 of each of the topic chapters in the ES describes
the study area for each topic.  The study areas have been based
on recognised professional guidance where relevant.  The study
areas were identified in the PEIR and were therefore subject to
consultation with the relevant statutory bodies.  The temporal
scope of the Project is described in Chapter 3.

Opinion,
para.3.12)
It is stated within the applicant’s scoping report that any impact
on drainage or water quality caused by the gas or electrical
connections during the operational and the development will be
scoped out of the assessment, as no decommissioning phases
of significant drainage or water quality impacts are predicted to
occur as a result of the presence of the connections during these
phases of the proposed development. The SofS recommends
that the applicant provides further information regarding the
potential for any below ground connections to form pathways for
the transport of pollutants which may result from previous use of
the land. NRW noted that at least part of the site was previously
used as landfill.
Further information regarding the potential for any below ground
connections to form pathways for the transport of pollutants is
included in Chapter 9 of the ES.

The SofS expects that the ES should contain confirmation that
the stacks required as part of the development, which will be up
to 60m in height, will not be visible from the AONB.
A stack height sensitivity test (Appendix 6.1) has concluded that
the stack will be between 35 and 40 m in height for 1 or 2 stacks
or between 25 and 30 m in height for 3 to 5 stacks.  See Chapter
11 for further details on the assessment of the visual impact of
the stacks.  The ES confirms that the stacks will not be visible
from the AONB.

Within 10 km of the site there are twenty SSSI’s, 1 SPA , 2
SAC’s, 1 National Nature Reserve and 23 SINC’s, the potential
impacts on which should be carefully assessed. There is the
need to consider potential related effects due to an increase in
airborne pollution including fugitive dust especially during site
preparation, demolition and construction.
The assessment considers potential impacts on European,
national and local designated ecological sites during operations
through air dispersion modelling. Potential impacts from airborne
pollution including fugitive dust during site preparation,
demolition and construction is assessed qualitatively using the
IAQM Guidance.

SofS (Scoping
Opinion,
para.3.24)
The ES should also include an assessment of potential air
quality impacts on the Lower Lliw Reservoir as a result of both
deposition and affected rainfall.
The Lower Lliw Reservoir is an emergency reservoir. It is not
possible to assess deposition on water and therefore assessing
deposition on the reservoir could not be undertaken. However as
the Project is a gas power station the only relevant pollutant is
NOX and no metal deposition is expected.

The assessment should take account of the air emissions from
the proposed development and emissions related to vehicular

recommends that the implications of stack height and dispersion
of the discharge be clearly explained within the ES.
In line with IAQM and EPUK guidance documents, the direct
impacts of operational and construction traffic have been scoped
out of the assessment due to the low number of daily vehicle
movements. A stack sensitivity assessment is presented in

The SofS recommends that the applicant agrees all modelling
receptor locations with the City and County of Swansea and also
that the applicant consults the City and County of Swansea
regarding the proposed data inputs for the air quality model.
The modelling receptor locations have been consulted on with
CCS.  It should also be noted that, in addition to the presentation
of impacts at selected receptors, the assessment of impacts on
human health has been undertaken for concentrations on a grid
of receptors within the study area which effectively covers all
possible receptor locations, whether named or not.

CCS.  Meteorological data used in the modelling was provided
by CCS as an appropriate representation of conditions on site.

SofS (Scoping
Opinion, para
3.29)
The SofS recommends that dispersion modelling considers a
range of possibilities and seeks to ensure that the "worst case"
scenario is assessed, for example the "worst case" may occur
as a short term impact.
This is the approach that was taken to the assessment as set
out in Chapter 6 of the ES.

SofS (Scoping
Opinion,

There are a number of residential receptors within 1 km of the
project site and suitable receptor locations for modelling
purposes should be agreed with the relevant local authority and
NRW. This may need to extend to densely populated areas just
outside of the proposed study area.
Agreed with CCS.  Chapter 6 of the ES contains figures which
show that the study area extends well outside of the area of
maximum impacts of the Project and, moreover, that impacts at
the boundary of study area are imperceptible.  As such, there is
no need to consider population areas outside of the study area.

The SofS recommends that air quality and dust levels are
considered not only on site but also off site, including along
access roads, local footpaths and other public rights of way.
Consideration should also be given to appropriate mitigation
measures and to monitoring dust complaints.
The assessment of impacts during construction has considered
impacts along access roads, local footpaths and other public
rights of way by applying the IAQM Guidance on the assessment
of dust from demolition and construction.  Air quality in these
areas has also been considered through the assessment of
impacts on a grid of receptors.

When considering a baseline (of existing air quality) and in the
assessment and future monitoring of impacts these:
 - should include consideration of impacts on existing areas of
poor air quality e.g. existing or proposed local authority AQMAs
- should include modelling using appropriate meteorological data
(i.e. come from the nearest suitable meteorological station and
include a range of years and worst case conditions)
- should include modelling taking into account local topography
The ES considers the Swansea AQMA. The air dispersion
modelling uses the appropriate meteorological data, agreed with
CCS. Terrain data is used in the air dispersion model.

Comment
Applicant’s Response
B.4.3. Factoring the long-term predictions by operating hours is
a methodology that is generally acceptable when there is
sufficient headroom such that the uncertainties involved are
unlikely to make a significant difference to predictions. In this
case you acknowledge that critical loads at nearby habitats are
already exceeded, therefore there is little headroom. Without
further work we cannot comment on whether this methodology is
a “worst case” approach. We would expect you to justify that
your assessment is representative of a worst case scenario.
B.4.3.  The air quality assessment has assessed long term
impacts by scaling the outputs for periods longer than one hour
by the likely operating hours, in this case 1500 per year. This in
turn meant that annual mean impacts were based on 1500 hours
out of 8760 hours.  This approach is considered to represent the
likely worst case, although it is acknowledged that this not the
“worst case” which might have such a low probability occurring
that it is not relevant to the assessment of chronic or long term
ecological effects. NRW acknowledges that factoring long term
prediction by operating hours is a methodology that is generally
acceptable. In order to address NRW concerns over the scaling
of long term predictions, we make reference to a previous
assessment of a peaking plant, operating at 1500 hours per
year, in Wales. As part of that assessment potential impacts of
different combinations of operating hours over the 5 years of
meteorological data were tested to address NRW concerns over
the scaling of long term impacts. The overall conclusions of the
statistical test was that the scaling of long term impacts can
result  in +/- 10% difference in concentrations at the 99th
Percentile level. Applying this conclusions to the predicted
results presented in the air quality assessment for the Abergelli
Power Project  and particularly on the most affected receptor (ie
Llefty Morfil SINC) will mean that the % of the critical load for
nitrogen deposition contribution will change by +/-0.1% .  This
difference is not significant and the conclusions of the
assessment are robust.”
B.4.4. Section 6.10.13 refers to a slight adverse effect on air
quality during construction, operation and decommissioning of
the Power station with mitigation stated as monitoring of
emissions. Monitoring is not considered to be mitigation, as the
pollutant may still be released. What additional mitigation can be
employed to prevent the adverse effects in the first place?
B.4.4. The project has a number of embedded mitigations
measures including a site specific Dust Management Plan
(DMP) that forms part of the Construction Environmental
Management Plan (CEMP). The monitoring of construction
emissions will form part of the DMP to ensure that appropriate
mitigation measures included in the DMP are applied
proportionally and at a timely manner including damping down of
dusty surfaces, imposing speed limits for vehicles, covering
stock piles etc. etc. Furthermore ambient air monitoring during
construction is a mitigation measure as an operator can set

alarm levels to prevent emissions exceeding potentially
significant levels.  During operation, real time stack monitoring
can also be considered mitigation as any increases in emissions
concentrations can be identified.  Furthermore the stack
sensitivity assessment, included in the assessment ensured the
adequate dispersion that will not result harmful effects to occur.
B.5. Air Quality - Nature Conservation Interests
B.5.1. For all Sites of Special Scientific Interest (SSSI) within at
least 2 km, and all Special Area of Conservation (SAC)/Special
Protection Areas (SPA)/Ramsar sites within 10km of the
proposed plant, information should be included in the ES.
B.5. Air Quality – Nature Conservation Interest
B.5.1. The assessment has considered all Sites of Special
Scientific Interest (SSSI) within at least 2 km, and all Special
Area of Conservation (SAC)/Special Protection Areas
(SPA)/Ramsar sites within 10km of the proposed plant.
B.5.2. Concentrations of NOx (and SO2 if present in emissions)
emitted by the proposed plant compared to the critical levels for
sensitive habitats at the above sites.
B.5.2. The assessment compared concentrations of NOx (SO2 is
not present in emissions) emitted by the proposed plant to the
critical levels for sensitive habitats.
B.5.3. Critical Levels are to be found on APIS
(http://www.apis.ac.uk/overview/issues/overview_Cloadslevels.ht
m#_Toc279788054 ).
B.5.3. We presume that this is typographic error, critical levels
are the taken from UK objectives and EU limits values and are
the same for all habitats.  Critical loads vary between habitats
and these have been taken from APIS.
B.5.4. Proposed plant emissions (Process Contribution/PC)
should be compared as a percentage of the relevant critical level
as well being compared to the PC added to the background
(PEC), to give percentage figures.
B.5.4. The assessment presented Process Contribution (PC)
and the Predicted Environmental Concentrations (PEC) as a
percentage of the relevant critical level. This approach was also
followed during the PEIR stage in the preliminary stack
sensitivity assessment.
B.5.5. Levels of nutrient Nitrogen deposition and Acid deposition
derived from the proposed plant (PC) should also be compared
to site relevant critical loads for the above sites. These are
available on APIS (http://www.apis.ac.uk/srcl) and should be

B.5.6. Instructions on how to carry out these calculations for acid
deposition are available on APIS (http://www.apis.ac.uk/critical-
load-function-tool) and in Environment Agency AQ TAG Paper
06 for nutrient Nitrogen deposition. Please note that in relation to
a Peaking Power facility which operates sporadically, the
assessment must be done as a worst case scenario i.e. the
maximum number of hours that the plant will be able to operate,
over a year.
B.5.6. The APIS critical load function tool was used to assess
impacts from acid deposition. The assessment of impacts on
ecosystems was based on a maximum operation of 1500 hours
per year, in the case of daily mean critical levels the assessment
was based on 24 hours continuous operation and the worst day
of the year.”

C.4. Preliminary Stack Sensitivity Analysis (PSSA)
C.4.1. We have not assessed the PSSA submitted as part of the
PEIR. A detailed assessment will be undertaken as part of the
EPR permit application process which will determine the
appropriate stack height required for appropriate environmental
control. We note that section 4.9.4 states that ‘Air quality
sensitivity tests have indicated that a minimum stack height of
35m will be required for adequate dispersion of exhaust gases
and to meet legislative air quality targets (i.e. IED)’. We also note
that ‘a maximum height of 40m has been assumed for the
purpose of the Landscape and Visual Impact and Cultural
Heritage Assessments as a ‘realistic worst-case scenario’.
C.4.2. However we do note that in the PEIR the consultant has
used significance criteria set out in H1 Annex F. The consultant
considered the impact of NOx and nitrogen deposition, and
reference was made to acidification, but it is unclear if this was
taken into account. This will need to be addressed when the
permit application is submitted.
Noted.  This issue will be addressed in the Environmental Permit
application.

Local Resident
(Response to

High stacks (40 metres) will discharge emissions into the air
which is at present among the healthiest in the County.
The height of the stacks is determined by sensitivity tests (see
Appendix 6.1 of the ES) to ensure that emissions are dispersed
without causing harm to human health.

potential resultant risk associated with not adopting a twin
tracking approach.
It is unclear whether the request of setting up a meeting with the
permitting team was taken from an extract regarding the
Hirwaun Power Limited application, however we are only too
willing to meet and discuss any relevant issues as required.
Please contact us to arrange a meeting with the relevant team.
B.2. We agree that a BAT assessment is not required as part of
the DCO process. However we advise that at present there are
doubts over whether Open Cycle Gas Turbines (operating up to
1500 hours) can be considered BAT. A DEFRA study is currently
underway and we are awaiting the outcome of this review in
order to help determine whether the technology can be
considered BAT. Accordingly we must reminded you that if the
proposed technology selection (OCGT) is not deemed BAT at
the EPR permitting stage then an EPR permit will not be issued.
Justification for the choice of SCGT is provided Section 5.3 of
the ES. The justification considers emissions, water usage, start-
up times and cost.
B.4.3. We acknowledge that factoring long term prediction by
operating hours is a methodology that is generally acceptable if
the operation hours are randomly scattered over a year.
However, if the operation hours are not randomly distributed
across a year or not predictable, then sensitivity analysis
considering the possible combination of unfavourable
meteorological conditions and operation hours would be
expected as a sensible way forward.
A specific sensitivity test has not been undertaken for this
assessment but data provided to NRW in relation to a similar
application at Hirwaun clearly demonstrated that the factoring
approach is an inappropriate method, with absolute maximum
concentrations no more than plus or minus 10% of the factored
result. Within the contact of a dispersion model study this is not
significant.
B.4.4. The stack height sensitivity assessment should consider
all relevant regulatory requirements for both short and long term
impact assessment.
We confirm that the assessment considered all relevant
regulatory requirements for both short and long term impact

NRW
(14th Nov
2014)
C.1.1. Whilst the PEIR submission states that the noise monitoring
locations were agreed with us and the Local Authority, we note that
we do not appear to have been in dialogue with the consultants in
regards to this matter.
C.1.1. Consultation with CCS was undertaken to agree the
methodology for the ambient noise survey, as detailed in the
Consultation Report (Document Reference 5.1.0). The frequency
data is now included in the baseline survey report, which is
provided in Appendix 7.1.  The consultants have also received
comments on the PEIR which have been taken into account in
the assessment.
C.1.2. The ambient noise survey was conducted in accordance with
the relevant standards but key frequency data is omitted from the
report which was requested by the SofS and confirmed to be
captured by the contractor. The PEIR outlines that at each
identified Nearest Sensitive Receptor location the sound level is
predicted to range between 40 dB to 47 dB LAeq which would
result in a major noise impact at the receptor locations. These
figures have been produced without factoring in any mitigation.
What mitigation is planned to attenuate this increase in noise
against the current background? Will each of the measures being
proposed reduce the noise levels to an acceptable level? We have
not had access to the modelling files to agree the figures suggested
in the PEIR.
C.1.2. The PEIR noise   modelling study was based on the
preliminary information. Detailed modelling has now been
undertaken for the ES, superseding the predicted noise levels
provided in the PEIR. A noise contour plot to show the results of
the modelling exercise is provided in Appendix 7.1.
All noise mitigation measures are detailed in Section 7.7 of the
ES.
The noise modelling files can be made available upon request.
C.1.3. Increased noise levels are likely to be perceived during start-
up. What levels are likely above background and how will this be
mitigated?
C.1.3. Mitigation will be designed so the plant does not exceed
background during all operational modes. Proposed measures
for mitigation are outlined in the mitigation section (Section 3.5 of
the ES).
17
C.2.1. Section 2.1.1 states that the survey was undertaken to
quantify existing noise levels at nearest sensitive receptors. We
were expecting a tonal assessment to be carried out in tandem with
the noise survey. This was specified in our letter dated 22 July
2014 sent by us (ref SH/2014/116929/01) and confirmed by you.
C.2.1. Short term sampling noise measurements were recorded
in 1/3 octave bands to allow for spectral analysis of tonal noise.
Data on the measured spectrum at each location have been
included in a revised issue of the baseline survey report to
demonstrate that baseline conditions are not influenced by
significant changes in tonal characteristics from existing
developments. The revised baseline noise survey report is
provided in Appendix 7.1.
C.2.2. Slight and minor adverse effects are predicted at sensitive
receptors during the construction phase of the project. The LAeq
seems to be significantly higher than the LA at each of the sensitive
receptors. The proposed mitigation to this is site hoarding to mask
the activities. Will this afford any real mitigation against the
increased noise levels other than removing direct line of sight?
C.2.2. Construction noise mitigation measures are set out in the
noise CEMP. The results of the ES construction noise
predictions are set out in Table 7.15.  The site hoarding will
provide a moderate level of noise reduction to low level
receptors.
C.2.3. Section 2.1.2 states that ‘short-term sampling measurements
were conducted...in order to capture the existing ambient noise
level representative of that particular period’. You should explain
why you feel a 30 minute sample which covered a 24 hour period
would be representative to suggest that the sound was stable and
not fluctuating.
C.2.3. The ambient noise survey methodology was discussed
and agreed with the Environmental Protection officer at CCS
prior to commencing the works. Short term sampling coupled
with long term measurements are a standard method employed
when access or safety precludes long term measurements at all
locations.  A full methodology and discussion is provided
Sections 7.6 to 7.8.
C.2.4. Additionally in section 2.1.2 it states that 3 day; 1 evening
and 2 night samples will be taken. We would question this
statement, it would appear the actual sampling undertaken was 2
day; 1 evening and 1 night for each nearest sensitive receptor.
C.2.4. As set out in the baseline survey report (Appendix 7.1 of
the ES), the monitoring undertaken was as follows:
Daytime - 2 sets of samples
Evening - 1 set of samples
Night time - 2 sets of samples
18
C3.1. Section 7.2.2 of the PEIR states that “The assessment
methodologies used in the PEIR are the same as those that will be
adopted for the EIA. However, the level of detail available at the
PEIR stage is only sufficient to form preliminary conclusions and
more detailed information will be required for the EIA.” You state
that you have followed the BS 4142 methodology. BS 4142
assesses the likelihood of complaints by subtracting the measured
background noise level from the rating level predictions at sensitive
receptors. In order to conduct a robust BS 4142 assessment,
representative background LA90 noise levels are required at
sensitive receptors. The noise monitoring survey should therefore
be conducted over a sufficient time period to determine typical
background levels under all operational scenarios (days, nights,
weekdays and weekends). Additionally measurements should be
taken over relevant reference time intervals. Please note that BS
4142 is currently being revised and the new version is likely to be
published soon. When conducting the noise survey and noise
impact assessment it is appropriate to follow the most recently
published British Standards.
C.3.1 The baseline methodology for this assessment is provided
in Sections 7.6 to 7.8 of the ES.  The ambient noise survey was
undertaken in August 2014, prior to the release of the revised
BS4142; as such the reference time intervals used are based on
the 1997 version, i.e. 5 minute intervals for night time. It is a
common misconception that measurement and assessment time
periods have to be the same – this is not the case. Shorter
measurements can be applied where reasonable judgements
can be made that these are equally representative of longer
measurements. PB is satisfied that this is the case in this
instance, and therefore the assessment is compliant with the
new standard. The ES methodology for operational noise impact
is based BS4142: 2014.
C.3.2. In section 7.2.1 there is no reference to Environment
Agency’s horizontal guidance note for noise.
C.3.2. This is included in Section 7.5 of the ES.
C.3.3. It is recommended that an overview of ‘A Noise Action Plan
for Wales 2013-2018’ is provided in the relevant policy and
guidance section with particular emphasis on the importance of
‘sustainable development principles’ and ‘creeping background’.
C.3.3. This is now included in Section 7.2 of the ES.
C.3.4. Section 7.3.3 of the PEIR states that ‘discussions were held
with CCS and NRW in August 2014 to agree a study area, a noise
survey methodology, and suitable locations for the survey
measurement positions’. We would question whether we were
consulted on this.
C.3.4. Please see response C.1.1.
C.3.5. In section 7.3.4 there is an exclusion of a tonal assessment
(please see our earlier comment on this matter).
C.3.5. Please see response C.1.2.

C.3.6. In Table 7.5, there are references to “Bergelli farm” and
these continue throughout the report. We presume this should be
Abergelli.
C.3.6. The typo has been rectified in the ES.
C.3.7. In section 7.3.6 there is a reference to weather data and this
was raised in the review of the ‘Ambient Noise Survey Report’. We
would like confirmation of how weather data was collected.
C.3.7. This was undertaken using Swansea MET office data,
which can be made available upon request.
C.3.8. Please note that will not comment on
construction/decommissioning or off site traffic noise - this is a role
for the Local Authority.
C.3.8. Noted.
C.3.9. In Table 7.9 there is reference to ‘slight adverse’ effects but
it is unclear whether you are referring to ‘minor adverse’ effects
specified in Table 7.4 above. There is no justification as to why the
sound levels from the gas and electrical connections are thought to
be negligible.
C.3.9. The electrical and gas connections will be via
underground cables and pipelines, there will be no noise
producing elements above ground.  This is discussed in detail in
Section 7.10 of the ES.
C.3.10. When submitting a noise impact assessment, as part of the
permit application for an EPR permit, you should refer to
Environment Agency document Noise Impact Assessment -
Information Requirements 3 to inform yourselves of the expected
requirements for a noise impact assessment submission.
C.3.10 The Environmental Permit application will refer to the EA
Horizontal Guidance for Noise Document - IPPC H3 (Part 1).
The assessment methodology for this noise study (Section 7.5 of
the ES) has followed all requirements as set out in the
Environment Agency H3 document.

so that we have real life studies of their environmental impact?
The maximum noise levels will be set out in the Environmental

included in Schedule 2 of the DCO.  It is not appropriate to set a
minimum noise level.

We are very concerned about the impact from noise during the 2
year construction period and operation of the plant.  Most important
to us that there will be no ongoing impact from noise when the
power plant is in operation.
Any noise impacts relating to construction and decommissioning
activities will be temporary. The appointed contractor will be
required to employ all best practice measures to minimise noise
during the construction period. The Project incorporates
embedded mitigation measures to ensure that any potential
construction and decommissioning impacts are mitigated and
therefore not significant. The construction noise mitigation
20
measures will be secured via Schedule 2 of the DCO. These
include specific measures to manage noise and vibration as well
as a Construction Traffic Management Plan to minimise
increased congestion and vehicle noise along the access routes.
There are no significant impacts anticipated during operation,
due to mitigation measures which will include silencers fitted to
the exhaust stacks and acoustic enclosures around Generating
Equipment. No operational impacts are anticipated from the Gas
and Electrical Connections as they are underground.

C.1.1. We note that the monitoring locations are representative
Noted.
C.1.3. The mitigation measures appear to be satisfactory but it is
unclear what attenuation can be expected from the measures
suggested against the calculated operational sound levels.
All mitigation proposed for the plant is embedded mitigation. The
noise model has been prepared to include all of the embedded
mitigation, as such the calculated noise levels presented in the
operational noise study are the fully mitigated noise levels.
C.2.1. Please can you direct us towards the snapshot of the
measured spectrum at each location as we cannot find this in the
baseline survey report.
The measured spectrum is provided in the Annex of the baseline
noise survey report.
C.2.4. We note that there is confusion around how many sampling
runs were carried out as specified in the Baseline report. The
baseline survey report states:
The measurement durations and time periods for each location
were carried out.
Please can it be confirmed how many were carried out.
This is a slight confusion due to the terminology used in the
baseline survey report. Daytime, as defined in TAN 11 and
BS4142:2014 is between the hours of 07.00 and 23.00. During
this time period 3 circuits of measurements were undertaken at
the sensitive receptor locations.

D.1. Habitats
D.1.2. We reiterate our comments made previously that we
would welcome further justification if the final location for the
Generating Equipment Site and Temporary Laydown Area is
decided to be on an area of marshy grassland (also known as
Purple moorgrass and rush pasture), and why it cannot be
located on areas of improved grassland, which would be less
ecologically damaging. Marshy grassland is a habitat listed
under section 42 of the Natural Environmental and Rural
Communities (NERC) Act 2006 and under the City and County
of Swansea’s (CCS) Local Biodiversity Strategy and Action Plan.
CCS have a duty under section 40 of the NERC Act, to have
regard to conserving biodiversity; and therefore we advise that
CCS’s Ecologist is consulted regarding section 42 habitats and
species in order to take account of possible adverse effects on
such interests.
D.1. Habitats
D.1.2. The Temporary Laydown Area is situated within a field of
improved grassland, whilst the Generating Equipment Site is
situated partially within fields of improved and semi-improved
grasslands and two fields of marshy grasslands.  The loss of this
habitat could not be avoided, however suitable mitigation
measures will be provided to replace the habitat lost.  The
proposed landscape and ecological mitigation plans are included
in the ES.
D.1.3. We advise that the predicted habitat losses should be
quantified in the ES. This is particularly important when working
with CCS’s Ecologist to agree a mitigation/compensation
scheme.
D.1.3. Habitat losses for all Valued Ecological Receptors have
been quantified in the ES.
D.1.4. We note the references to section 2.13 of the PEIR and
embedded mitigation throughout section 8 Ecology; however
there is not sufficient reference to ecological mitigation and
monitoring in Section 2.13.
D.1.4. At the time of preparation of the PEIR most of the
ecological surveys were on-going and therefore the full extent of
the ecological mitigation was not yet known.  The ecological
surveys have now all been completed and suitable ecological
mitigation designed and detailed in the ES.
D.1.5. In section 2.11.1 Table 2.1 Access Road Comparison
table, we would suggest the ecological impact considerations
are also included in this table.
D.1.5. Only one option has been taken forward and assessed in
the ES therefore comparison table has not be included.  All
potentially significant impacts arising from the final access route
option have been fully detailed in the ES.
24
D.1.6. We also refer to our previous comments in our scoping
response letter in relation to the watercourses and wetland
habitats and their associated species and advise that further
consultation with ourselves is carried out before detailed site
layout plans are drawn up and submitted at draft ES stage.
D.1.6. The ecological surveys including watercourses and
wetland habitats have now all been completed and suitable
ecological mitigation designed and detailed in the ES.  Due to
short timescales for the submission of the ES it was not possible
to issue a full draft ES to NRW for comments, however we
provided all ecological survey reports for comment.
D.2. Access
D.2.1. We note the project is looking at two access options.
Option one would result in some habitat losses to Sites of
Importance for Nature Conservation (SINC) through road
widening. Option two would also result in habitat losses, but to a
greater extent. The losses resulting from option two would result
in permanent loss of ancient woodland which cannot be
mitigated.
D.2. Access
D.2.1. .Only one option has been taken forward and assessed in
the ES.  This option will lead to permanent loss of Ancient
Woodland and it is acknowledged that this cannot be fully
mitigated.  The decision making process has taken account of
the ecological impact as well other significant factors such as
consideration for the local residents and overall it was
considered that this option fulfilled most requirements.  The loss
of ancient woodland was minimised through design where
possible.
25
D.2.2. We note that there has already been a significant loss of
woodland in this area as a result of industrial development and
that the remaining woodland on and around the site was
reclassified as Plantations on Ancient Woodland Sites (PAWS)
under the Ancient Woodland Inventory (AWI) dataset in 2011.
Section 5.2.9 of Planning Policy Wales Chapter 5: Conserving
and Improving Natural Heritage and the Coast states that ‘Trees,
woodlands and hedgerows are of great importance, both as
wildlife habitats and in terms of their contribution to landscape
character and beauty. They also play a role in tackling climate
change by trapping carbon and can provide a sustainable
energy source. Local planning authorities should seek to protect
trees, groups of trees and areas of woodland where they have
natural heritage value or contribute to the character or amenity
of a particular locality. Ancient and semi-natural woodlands are
irreplaceable habitats of high biodiversity value which should be
protected from development that would result in significant
damage.’ We advise that any proposed loss of woodland should
be avoided.
D.2.2. We welcome the additional information on the
reclassification of the woodland section which was not available
before,  The decision making process has taken account of the
ecological impact as well other significant factors such as
consideration for the local residents and overall it was
considered that this option fulfilled most requirements.  The loss
of ancient woodland was minimised through design.
D.2.3. Once the final access route has been selected, should the
route require any road widening/improvements, we advise that
further survey work is carried out on the external access roads
which have not been included in the Phase 1 habitat survey and
possible subsequent protected species survey work.
D.2.3. All areas where works are proposed as part of the Project
have been included in the ecological surveys and where
information was missing the surveys were updated.  The update
Phase 1 habitat assessment is presented in the updated
Preliminary Ecological Appraisal which is  presented in Appendix
8.1 of the ES.
26
D.4. Invasive Species
D.4.1. With reference to invasive species found on the site, we
note that five invasive species have been found. Section 8.3.22
describes invasive species identified during the site surveys. We
advise that appropriate measures must be implemented for the
removal or long-term management of the identified invasive
species on site. Japanese Knotweed is classed as controlled
waste under the Environmental Protection Act 1990 and as such
must be disposed of in a suitable manner.
D.4. Invasive Species
D.4. The ES (Chapter 8)identifies where invasive species will be
directly affected by the Project and  the Outline Ecological
Management Plan (Appendix 8.14) detail control measures in
line with legislative requirements and best practice guidelines.
D.5. Species
D.5.1. We note that all the standard ecological surveys have
been carried out; however analysis of some of the surveys is still
being carried out and the final design is yet to be decided
therefore we will not be providing detailed comments on the
impacts at this stage. We would be happy to provide comments
on the survey work and results prior to the draft ES stage should
you wish to consult us.
D.5. Species
D.5.1 Due to short timescales for the submission of the ES it
was not possible to issue a full draft ES to NRW for comments,
however we have provided all ecological survey reports for
comment.
D.6. Otters
D.6.1. Ecological conditions can change over the short term, we
would recommend regularly re-surveying for otters in the
watercourse where an otter spraint was found and the
watercourses identified as having potential to support otters.
D.6. Otters
D.6.1. We are in agreement with the need of re-survey for otters
before works commence on site and the need for this  is
captured in Chapter 8 of  the ES.
27
D.7. Watervoles
D.7.1. The details of the watervole survey in the PEIR Appendix
appear to be inconclusive as to whether there are water voles on
site. The surveys found no signs of recent activity but there was
suitable habitat and holes. At the time of writing the report there
were only historic watervole records from 1996 available for the
River Llan but an active population of watervoles has recently
been found downstream at Penllergaer. We would recommend
that further watervole surveys are carried out in May when the
voles are very active.
D.7. Water voles
D.7.1. The water vole survey found no conclusive evidence of
water voles but that suitable habitat is present on site.  The ES
takes into account the potential for this species and further re-
survey for water voles will be undertaken before works
commence during the active water vole season (the need for this
is addressed in the ES).
D.7.2. Protection and enhancement of suitable watervole habitat
on site will be an important mitigation measure which we would
like to discuss further in the future when detailed plans for the
development are being considered.
D.7.2. As part of the drainage, landscape and ecological
mitigation proposals,  drainage ditches affected will be recreated
and two attenuation ponds will need to be created.  Also two
ponds greater in size to the one lost will be created which will be
subject to ecological enhancement measures.at least one
drainage ditch and attenuation pond will need to be created.
These features will be suitable for water voles should they
colonise the site in the future.
28
B.6. Habitats Regulations Assessment
B.6.1. We advise that a Shadow Habitats Regulations
Assessment (HRA) should be recorded by yourselves (as per
PINS guidance Note 10). The HRA should test the likely
significant effects of the development for all relevant receptor
SAC, SPA and Ramsar sites, in light of impact pathways from
the development itself (for example aerial emissions). These
effects should be tested alone and if no likely significant effects
concluded for a particular impact pathway on a site(s) alone, in-
combination effects should then be tested for those parameters,
according to any residual effects from this development and
other relevant plans/projects. Guidance is available for
competent authorities in recording HRAs (Assessing Projects
Under The Habitats Directive - Guidance For Competent
Authorities, CCW, 2011) and this may aid in recording a shadow
HRA, in terms of main guiding principles of the HRA process.
The guidance sets out the principles of the in-combination test
as described above, including which plans/projects to consider
within the in-combination test. Any likely significant effects
identified should lead to the recording of a shadow Appropriate
Assessment (or Report to Inform an Appropriate Assessment, or
similar) to assess such effects further. The above guidance is
available at the following URL (please note that this guidance
has not been updated since 2011);
http://www.ccgc.gov.uk/landscape--wildlife/managing-land-and-
sea/environmental-assessment/habitats-regulations-

Habitat Regulation Screening Assessment (Stage 1) has been
prepared and the assessment is presented in the No Significant
Effects Report  (NSER, see Document Reference 5.5.0).  The
NSER was submitted to NRW for comment in March 2015.  The
Report concluded that there would be no significant effects on
Burry Inlet Ramsar Site and SPA Carmarthen Bay and Estuaries
SAC and Crymlyn Bog Ramsar Site and SAC and a full HRA
was not required.

Groundwater contamination should also be a consideration
when dealing with the landfill at the location. Although this landfill
was operated as an inert landfill, this is not to say that it is
exclusively filled with inert wastes. Any disturbance, or
excavation, reuse, temporary storage and disposal of this
material should not preclude the possibility of it containing non-
inert and potentially hazardous substances. An assessment of
this element of the scheme may be necessary in the form of trial
pits or boreholes in order to determine materials present. NRW
should be made aware of any adverse findings.
Chapter 10 of the ES assesses potential groundwater
contamination from contaminated ground. Ground Investigation
will assess contamination along the route and is secured in

Applicant should fully assess ground instability and be satisfied
that piling operations and any vibration associated with the
construction process will not disturb or cause any fracturing of
the Dwr Cymru/Welsh Water main that traverses the site. The
same consideration applies to disturbance of any historic mine
workings, adits or groundwater.
This is addressed in Chapter 10 of the ES which confirms that
ground investigation will be carried out to inform the design and
ensure that there will be no pollution resulting from the
disturbance of mine workings.  A Coal Authority Permit will also
be obtained.  A protective provision is included the in the draft

Advise that watercourses in the catchment are failing as regards
the WFD, and as such it may not be viable for any discharge
from a foul drainage system to be directed to them. This would
be determined should an application be submitted. Recommend
consideration of an ancillary soakaway system.
Subject to confirmation of ground conditions, drainage strategy
proposes an on-site soakaway for discharge of effluent from the
package treatment plant. Foul discharges will be small, therefore
it is expected they can be discharged via infiltration. If necessary
an overflow would be provided discharging to the local drains.

Culverting is not considered an appropriate way to allow
development to go ahead, generally consider culverting for short
lengths for access only. Diversion of any watercourse on site
would be more appropriate. An appropriate buffer zone should
be left on both sides, with 7m as the starting point
Drainage strategy (Appendix 9.1 of the ES) proposes diversion
of drains/watercourses that cross the site. Culverting restricted

Fully support infiltration based SuDS systems, supported by a
GI. If infiltration is not possible any design should work to
greenfield runoff rates and use above ground systems to convey
and manage water quality in a more holistic way.
 Outline drainage strategy (Appendix C of Appendix 9.1 of the

Welsh Water
Confirmed that concerns regarding potential contamination of
the Lower Lliw reservoir relate to air pollution.
It is not possible to assess deposition on water and therefore
assessing deposition on the reservoir could not be undertaken.

The River Llan floods regularly in periods of heavy rain.  We
need assurances that the proposed development is not going to
worsen this.
A Flood Consequences Assessment has been prepared for the
Project as part of the EIA, in accordance with the Welsh
Government’s Technical Advice Note 15: Development and
Flood Risk (see Appendix 9.1 of the ES).  We anticipate that
while the Project may have some minor impacts on flood flows in
the existing watercourses on the Site, any impacts can be
minimised through careful design, with consideration of overland
flow routes and local depressions. Surface water runoff from the
developed site will either be discharged via infiltration, if ground
conditions allow, or runoff rates will be restricted to existing
greenfield rates for events up to the 100 year (with climate
change allowance). The Project is considered to have a
negligible impact on flooding in the wider area.  In particular, the
Project is not located within the floodplain of the Afon Llan.

This is agricultural land.  That is what it has always been, and
changing the use that is made of it would not only undermine its
value as agricultural land but there would also be a danger of
changing the nature of the whole area.
The loss of agricultural land that has been in production for
hundreds of years should not be allowed unless food production
and the development can be managed alongside each other.
Abergelli Farm has a history of commercial and industrial uses,
including Abergelli Colliery and a landfill site.  The area
surrounding the Project Site will continue to change over the

Joint response
by National
Grid Electricity
Transmission
plc (NGET) and
National Grid
Gas plc (NGG)
National Grid Electricity Transmission has four high voltage
electricity overhead transmission lines and two substations
which lie within the proposed order limits.
If any changes in ground levels are proposed either beneath or
in close proximity to our existing overhead lines then this would
serve to reduce the safety clearances for such overhead lines.
Safe clearances for existing overhead lines must be maintained
in all circumstances.
If a landscaping scheme is proposed as part of the proposal, we
request that only slow and low growing species of trees and shrubs are
planted beneath and adjacent to the existing overhead line to reduce
the risk of growth to a height which compromises statutory safety
clearances.
Noted – The outline landscape mitigation proposals shown in
Figures 11.5 Outline Landscape Mitigation Strategy are at a
preliminary stage. The detailed landscape proposals  will be
developed in accordance with National Grid guidance after the
engineering design has been finalised. The proposals will be
developed taking into account all relevant constraints. The
drawings will identify proposed changes to ground levels, the
mature height of planting and statutory safety clearances
beneath overhead lines.

interests within and in the vicinity of the proposed development.
This should be done using former Countryside Council for
Wales’ LANDMAP methodology. NRW would expect any
Environmental Statement (ES) to demonstrate use of all five
data sets in the LVIA for the application. These include:
Geological Landscape;  Landscape Habitats; Visual & Sensory;
Historic Landscape; Cultural Landscape
Visual appraisal of the scheme in addition to specific site issues
should consider:  Development infrastructure – including cabling,
ancillary buildings, working compounds, should all be considered
in the assessment even if temporary. The removal and disposal
of any excavated materials such as rock or soil. Creation of new
access tracks and re-profiling of existing ones. Transmission
route connections to the main power grid; it is important that a
landscape assessment of the connection route from the
development to the power grid is included for consideration.
The ES should also consider the presence of any historic
landscapes in the area and the potential impact the proposed
development may have on these, which is noted in section 5.8.7
of the report.
The ES should consider protected landscapes in the vicinity of
the proposals.
It is vital that the LVIA utilises appropriate viewpoints as there is
the potential for the proposals to be visible from a wide area.
Section 5.8.11 refers to follow up consultation with relevant
stakeholders over selection of photomontages from key sensitive
viewpoints. We would be happy to provide advice concerning
this selection.
We note that detailed grid references are not included for
currently proposed viewpoints, making us unable to comment on
their suitability at this stage.
We advise that an additional viewpoint from Brecon Beacons
National Park be considered.
We advise that views in photographs and photomontages taken
from these viewpoints be representative of the views and not
partially obscured by buildings and trees.

Additional development applications to consider for the
Cumulative Assessment in the EIA:
a. Planning Application 2012/1221 Mynydd y Gwair Wind Farm –
16 wind turbines with new access road from A48 (Bolgoed Road
at Pontarddulais, approximately 14.54km in length).
b. Planning Application 2006/0773 Felindre Business Park –
Business park for B1 and B2 use on 195 hectares.
c. Additionally the Felindre LDP/Candidate Site should be
considered. The assessment fails to have regard to the Local
Development Plan: Preferred Strategy, July 2013.
Whilst the suggested viewpoint locations appear to be indicative
of the surrounding area, following a meeting with the developer,
the Zone of Theoretical Visibility (ZTV) has been requested to
assist in assessing the adequacy of the proposed viewpoints.
Noted – the relevant developments, including Felindre Business
Park, have been considered under cumulative effects.
ZTVs for the tallest structures within the Generating Equipment

NRW
(14th Nov 2014)
G.1 Scope of the assessment
G.1.1  There does not appear to be any evidence presented on
the consideration of alternative sites for the power generation
plant. We advise that this should be included in the EIA.
G1.1  Chapter 5, Section 5.2 sets out the reasons for the Project
Site selection.
G.1.2  A 15km study area is considered acceptable for the Zone
of Theoretical Visibility (ZTV) based on a maximum 40m stack
height.
G1.2  Noted
43
G.1.3  In order to ‘scope out’ impacts on the Gower AONB and
Brecon Beacons National Park, it would be helpful to provide
single frame photographs at A3 size from viewpoints within
these designations and within the 15km study area. This would
help to demonstrate whether there are likely to be significant
effects on these designations.
G1.3  Locations were selected within the Gower AONB (VP12 &
VP13), however on visiting the area in and around the
viewpoints it was clear that the project site would not be visible
within these long distance views. These viewpoints were
therefore not included in the assessment and no photography
taken. The Brecon Beacons lies beyond the visible range of the
Project Site.  This has been confirmed by the National Park
Authority in an email dated 19th September 2014.
G.2  Photomontages
G.2.1. We would recommend that the photomontages (when
selected) include single frame extracts from the panoramas (40
degree angle of view), reproduced at A3 size. These can be held
up in the field and can reasonably demonstrate the level of detail
seen with the eye. The panoramas help to provide context.
G2.1 Noted. Photomontages have been produced at A3 size to
illustrate a high level of details whilst being suitable for use in the
field.
G.3  LANDMAP & Landscape Sensitivity
G.3.1. Table 11.2 and 11.3 descriptions should recognise that
these are typical features of the various category of sensitivity
and not definitive e.g. landscapes not recognised by
designations are not necessarily of low sensitivity. The level of
sensitivity depends on the character of the landscape and the
nature of the proposal. This is set out in Guidelines for
Landscape and Visual Impact Assessment (GLVIA3) 2013.
G3.1 Noted.  The criteria for sensitivity contained in Tables 11.2
and 11.3 provide broad guidance which is expanded further
through published landscape character assessment and field
survey.
G 4  Landscape Character Assessment
G4.1  The landscape character areas illustrated on figure 11.3
appear to be the visual and sensory aspect areas taken from
LANDMAP. This should be clarified. The assessment of
landscape character sensitivity appears to only consider the
visual and sensory aspect and not all five aspects. The overall
evaluation used in the Landscape and Visual Impact
Assessment (LVIA) only relates to the visual and sensory
aspect. The overall evaluation for the geological, historical,
cultural and habitats aspects vary within the site from high to
outstanding.
G4.2  The assessment of landscape character and sensitivity
should consider information from all five aspect areas, not only
G4.1 Noted.  Figure 11.3 Landscape Character Areas notes the
character areas are LANDMAP landscape character areas.
G4.2 Noted. All 5 Aspect Areas are now detailed and mapped in
Appendix 11.1 LANDMAP Aspects Areas. A summary is
included in the main text under Baseline Conditions.
44
the visual and sensory aspect areas. As well as the overall
evaluation for each aspect, the rarity/uniqueness evaluation for
Geological Landscape, the connectivity/cohesion evaluation for
Landscape Habitats, the scenic quality and character evaluation
for Visual and Sensory and the rarity and group value for Historic
Landscape and Cultural Landscape should be taken account of.
Landscape character derives from all five aspects within
LANDMAP. If the character assessment does not consider all 5
aspects it is likely to be flawed.
G.5  Selection of viewpoints and visual receptors
G.5.1  It is unclear why houses in Llangyfelach are not
considered in the residential visual receptors when the
information states that there are views of the site from the
village.
G5.1 Llangyfelach has been included in the assessment and the
representative viewpoint is VP11.
G.6  Lighting
G.6.1  The LVIA should include an assessment of the visual
effects of lighting e.g. the potential need for airport hazard lights.
G6.1 The Outline Lighting Strategy (ES appendix 3.4) indicates
that the maximum stack height (40 m above ground level for one
or two stacks) is below the threshold requiring safety lighting to
prevent contact with aircraft. Therefore it was not considered
relevant to the LVIA. The LVIA includes an assessment of
proposed lighting within a currently unlit landscape.
G.7  Construction Environmental Management Plan
G.7.1  This should include proposals for the protection and
storage of soils and the restoration of compounds and disturbed
areas. Restoration should be appropriate to the surrounding
landscape.
G7.1 Noted.  Broad principles for soil handling and the
reinstatement of temporary areas required for construction will
be included in the Landscape Mitigation Strategy and in the
CEMP.
45
G.8  Mitigation
G.8.1  There is currently very little information on the
opportunities for mitigation. The area of land owned or available
to you will influence the amount and effectiveness of mitigation
and needs to be considered at the outset. There may be
opportunities for advance planting. If insufficient land is available
for mitigation the significance of effects is likely to be higher,
therefore this has a direct effect on the potential acceptability of
the proposals.
G8.1
Mitigation is set out in the LVIA and is illustrated in Figure 11.5
Outline Landscape Mitigation Strategy
G.9  Cumulative assessment
G.9.1  A number of other wind farm and solar energy proposals
have been approved and should be taken into account in the
cumulative assessment, along with the other existing and
planned development in the locality (e.g. Proposed Felindre
Business Park and Sustainable Urban Village).
G.9.2  Wind farms/turbines within the 15km study area include:
Mynydd y Betws (operational), Mynydd y Gwair, Mynydd y
Gwrhyd, Tyle Coch Mawr and Gilfach Renewable Energy Project
(approved), Mynydd Marchywel (in planning).
G.9.3  Solar farms within the 15km study area and in close
proximity to the site include: Brynwhilach Farm (operational),
Abergelli and Cefn Betingau/Rhyd-y-Pandy (approved).
G9.1/ G9.2/ G9.3 Noted – the relevant developments have now
been considered under cumulative effects.

(Response to

For my part, these plans do not mean a significant progress to
enhance our local area; rather, they allow the destruction of an
area of outstanding natural beauty.
The Project Site does not lie within an Area of Outstanding
Natural Beauty (AONB), the closest being the Gower AONB to
the south west of the Project Site. The impact of the Project on
the AONB is considered in Chapter 11 of the ES.

Given the scale of the proposal it does not seem possible that
the plant will be entirely screened from view from Maes Eglwys
Farm. However, I would like to know as much as possible about
what is proposed in terms of lessening the visual impact.
Photograph and photomontage images are provided as part of
the ES to illustrate an observer’s view of the existing Project Site
and of the Project during operation. One of the viewpoint
locations is the public right of way in close proximity to Maes
Eglwys Farm. The landscape and visual impact assessment
concludes:
· During construction of the Power Generation Plant,
mitigation for the potential adverse temporary landscape
and visual effects will be in the form of retention of any
46
existing vegetation, advanced screen planting and removal
of any temporary structures or stockpiles as soon as
possible. Maes Eglwys Farm is located to the south of the
Generating Equipment Site and would see construction
activity at both ground level and at height, as any new
planting will not have matured. As a result, moderate
adverse residual effects will remain for Maes Eglwys Farm
during construction of the Power Generation Plant;
· Construction of the Electrical Connection will be partially
visible from Maes Eglwys Farm. As a result, slight adverse
residual effects will remain for Maes Eglwys Farm during
construction of the Electrical Connection;
· Construction of the Gas Connection will not be visible from
Maes Eglwys Farm; and
· During operation, Maes Eglwys Farm will have partial views
of the Generating Equipment, with the rest of the
development screened by intervening vegetation. However,
the stacks will be visible against the sky.

G.1.3. We note your comments regarding the viewpoint selection
however we still recommend that evidence (i.e. A3 photos with
site location marked) to demonstrate there is no visibility form
the Gower AONB and Brecon Beacons National Park should be
provided. This would aid in showing that this is not an issue and
to scope out any impacts on these designated areas
An existing photograph from Viewpoint 13 (location shown on
Figure 11.4) has been provided to demonstrate that the Project
is not visible from the Gower AONB.  Figure 11.2 (the ZTV)
demonstrates that the Project Site is not visible from the Brecon
Beacons National Park and the National Park Authority has
confirmed that it is appropriate for the National Park to be
scoped out of the assessment (email dated 19th September
2014).
G.8.1. We note that mitigation will be set out in the
Environmental Statement/Landscape Management Plan,
however, it is unclear whether the land available for mitigation
has been considered at this stage as this has a bearing on the
amount of mitigation that can be achieved and the degree to
which it can reduce impacts.
The Landscape Mitigation Strategy (Figure 11.5) and Ecological
Management Plan (Appendix 8.13) includes all of the land
required for mitigation and has been considered in the ES.

There is major concern locally about the traffic that such a
development is likely to cause… They are rural roads – for a
farming community.  Whichever route was chosen, it would have
a detrimental impact on transport to Felindre school, as parents
travel along both roads to reach the school.

authority areas of Carmarthenshire, Neath Port Talbot,
Pembrokeshire and Swansea areas) – in addition to the study
areas you have defined.  Our Unitary/Local Development Plan
and the economic regeneration strategy we have adopted relate
to these two areas respectively.
This study area does however cover the vast majority of the
Swansea Bay City Region geographic area and accounts for
around 7% higher population.
See paragraph 14.5.3 of Chapter 14.
In relation to labour market impacts, we would additionally wish
to see the professional skills profile of the jobs created during the
construction and operational phases to better gauge the project’s
employment value as well as identify opportunities
locally/regionally for developing suitably skilled people to
compete for jobs created by the project.  Also, will the project
provide opportunities for people to obtain work experience,
training or apprenticeships?
An assessment of construction skills is provided in the
Assessment of Socio-economic Effects section.
See paragraph 14.7.6 and 14.7.24 of Chapter 14.
The project will provide opportunities for people to obtain work
experience, training and apprenticeships.  The precise details of
this are not, however, included in this assessment.
Beyond visual impacts on sectors, and in addition to labour
market and any specific community economic impacts, we would
also be interested in potential economic impacts on businesses
and particularly on relevant supply chain service providers in
Swansea, the City Region and the other study area.
APL aim to provide mechanisms to encourage local businesses
in supply chain opportunities.

SofS (Scoping
Opinion,
para.4.17)
The SofS recommends that the applicant should state clearly
what regulatory areas are addressed in the ES and that the
applicant should ensure that all relevant authorisations, licences,
permits and consents that are necessary to enable operations to
proceed are described in the ES. Also it should be clear that any
likely significant effects of the proposed development which may
be regulated by other statutory regimes have been properly
taken into account in the ES.
A table with details of other consents required has been
prepared and submitted with the application (see Document
Reference 4.4.0). Details are also provided at paragraph [xx] of
Chapter 4 of the ES.

SofS (Scoping
Opinion,
para.4.21)
The SofS recommends that the ES should identify whether the
proposed development has the potential for significant
transboundary impacts and if so, what these are and which EEA
States would be affected.
See Chapter 4 of the ES which confirms that no transboundary
impacts are predicted.  This is in accordance with the SofS’s
Screening Matrix1.

The developer is advised to consider whether storage of
hazardous substances is involved and, if so, whether Hazardous
Substances Consent is required.
The Project is not a COMAH site, so a Hazardous Substances
Consent is not required.

PHE would expect to see information about how the promoter
would respond to accidents with potential off-site emissions e.g.
flooding or fires, spills, leaks or releases off-site.
The construction phase would be covered by the CEMP and the
operational phase will be covered by the APL Operational
Procedures.

PHE (letter

The EIA should include consideration of the COMAH
Regulations (Control of Major Accident Hazards) and the Major
Accident Off-Site Emergency Plan (Management of Waste from
Extractive Industries) (England and Wales) Regulations 2009
The quantities of 'dangerous' substances stored at the plant do
not meet the lower thresholds which require implementation of
the COMAH Directive; instead the plant is subject only to
national legislation (e.g. occupational safety and health
regulations).

PHE (letter

The promoter should consult the local authority, Food Standards
Agency Wales and NRW.
The Applicant has consulted CCS and NRW and has met with
CCS throughout the preparation of the application.  It has not
contacted the Food Standards Agency as their remit does not
relate to gas-fired peaking plants.
