But, given the complexity, the 
uncertainty and the profundity of  
the change our energy system faces, 
stakeholders are increasingly asking 
where to start.
A good first step is to understand  
the type of journey we need to go  
on to get there.
In this report Energy Systems Catapult 
lays out a set of credible pathways  
for the UK to get to Net Zero. The 
pathways reflect a diversity of 
implementation approaches and 
highlight the consequences of 
differing levels of technology 
innovation and societal behaviour 
changes. They are not in any way 
prescriptive, but they do lay out the 
scale of the transformation and the 
potential for different technologies. 
It has energised the debate. But if we 
are to realise the goal, the target itself 
is a necessary, but far from sufficient, 
condition. We know that to get to  
Net Zero demands major upheavals  
in how we make, move, store and use 
energy. We know that this will require 
innovation – in technology of course, 
but equally in consumer propositions, 
market design, business models and 
system definition and design.
Such an approach helps scope the 
opportunity for policy and regulation 
to enable new technologies, 
propositions and business models to 
be developed, financed and deployed 
at scale and with pace. It starts to 
frame possible solution sets for the 
most challenging aspects of the 
transformation – like decarbonising 
home heating.
If this work can help build consensus 
for credible action it will have taken 
us all an important step closer to 
moving from aspiration to delivery, 
unleashing the innovation the 
transition to Net Zero depends on.
We have a great platform in the UK. 
We’ve led the way in decarbonising 
electricity generation, have a track 
record of evidence-based policy, an 
increasingly progressive regulatory 
ambition, a robust legacy energy 
system, world-class green finance 
capability and a strong and diverse 
research base that spans the whole 
energy system. 
The brilliant British companies we 
work with every day are devising  
new platforms, offers, technologies 
and services: from new ways of 
generating nuclear power to storing 
and supplying energy; from managing 
our networks in a more flexible way 
to heating our homes and charging 
our cars; integrating the digital with 
the physical, creating solutions for 
consumers that will deliver clean 
economic growth.

EXECUTIVE SUMMARY

Electricity generation 
may have to double  
by 2050
Unleashing innovation at the pace 
and scale needed requires a deep 
understanding of how the different 
parts of the energy system interact;  
in short, taking a whole system 
approach.
This report updates Energy Systems 
Catapult’s national Energy System 
Modelling Environment (ESME)  
to consider the potential pathways  
to 2050, and to help identify the 
technologies, products and services 
which are most important to meeting 
Net Zero. It recommends what needs 
to happen during this Parliament to 
deliver Net Zero levels of investment, 
infrastructure and innovation.
Key messages
Net Zero narrows the set  
of viable pathways for  
the future energy system. 
Where an 80% target allowed 
considerable variation in relative 
effort across the economy, with some 
fossil fuels still permissible in most 
sectors, Net Zero leaves little slack.
Success depends on 
innovation across the whole 
system; in technology, land 
use change and behaviour. 
Net Zero requires switching to low 
carbon technologies wherever we  
can, tackling demand for hard-to-
treat activities (aviation and livestock),  
and ensuring sufficient carbon 
sequestration to offset any residual 
emissions. Each of these elements 
faces significant barriers and 
technology and land use changes  
are constrained by maximum feasible 
deployment rates and competing 
uses of land.
While the challenge is daunting,  
the commercial opportunity for  
those companies able to deliver  
the innovations needed is huge.  
This analysis will help identify those 
opportunities, and what may be 
needed to unlock them. While our 
assumptions should be challenged, 
our goal is to show ‘what you have to 
believe’ in order to deliver Net Zero.
So far, decarbonisation has mostly 
relied on ‘upstream’ changes in the 
electricity mix and reduced energy 
use in industry. Net Zero requires 
society-wide adoption of low carbon 
heating and transport technologies.  
It may also mean limiting growth in 
aviation demand and changing diets.
Our early public engagement 
suggests a general willingness to 
adopt new technologies (such as new 
heating or mobility) as long as these 
can deliver the same experiences as 
before. However, approaching the 
subject of dietary change or aviation 
often elicits a more resistant and 
emotional response. Serious societal 
engagement is therefore essential 
to the UK’s ability to meet Net Zero 
given the nature and pace of the 
changes required.
Meeting the UK’s Net Zero target will require 
unprecedented innovation across the economy. 
Innovation not just in new technologies, but in  
new ways of deploying existing technologies, new 
business models, new consumer offerings, and, 
crucially, new policy, regulation and market design.
Serious societal 
engagement is 
therefore essential 
to the UK’s ability 
to meet Net Zero.

TWh/yr of 
Hydrogen needed 
by 2050
Even if demand for aviation  
and livestock products were 
eliminated by 2050, and 
technology deployment raised  
to even more ambitious rates,  
Net Zero could only be brought 
forward to 2045. Achieving an  
earlier target date would require 
non-linear reductions in demand  
(or breakthrough technologies for 
carbon removals). Our early public 
engagement around Net Zero makes 
us cautious of pathways that rely  
on widespread, rapid adoption of 
such changes.
CCS and bioenergy are both 
essential to delivering Net Zero. 
When the target was 80%, failure  
to deploy CCS had the highest cost 
impact of all sensitivities, but the 
target could still be met. Similarly, it 
was possible to meet the 80% targets 
without any scale up of biomass, 
albeit incurring higher system cost. 
With a Net Zero target, failure to 
deploy either option means foregoing 
the negative emissions essential to 
offsetting continued demand for 
aviation and livestock products.  
Our modelling finds it extremely 
difficult to meet Net Zero in those 
circumstances.
CCS deployment is essential for 
mitigating industrial emissions and 
can play a central role in hydrogen 
production. The power sector  
could act as an anchor for early  
CCS deployment but its long-term 
role here may depend on achieving 
very high (99%) capture rates.
To deliver this, the UK must 
support innovation and 
deployment across a portfolio of 
low carbon energy conversion 
technologies:
• For Electricity: offshore wind 
(including floating turbines for 
deeper waters); large and small 
modular nuclear subject to 
demonstration and cost reduction; 
and CCGT with CCS as an important 
anchor in the early years (although 
this may now be limited to a 
transitional role if it is unable  
to increase its capture rates).
• For Hydrogen: steam methane 
reformation with CCS may offer  
the lowest cost route, while bio-
gasification with CCS offers the 
co-benefit of negative emissions. 
But given implementation risks  
for these, electrolysis remains  
an important option for bulk 
production as well as offering 
unique opportunities for 
integration of renewables and more 
distributed hydrogen production. 
Advanced nuclear concepts are also 
emerging as a potential route to 
low cost hydrogen production.
• For District Heat Networks: 
industrial heat offtake and 
geothermal sources could 
contribute, subject to local 
availability. But if heat networks  
are to be deployed at scale,  
large heat pumps offer a proven 
solution, while small modular 
nuclear reactors offer potential  
for combined heat and power, 
subject to demonstration, and 
social and political acceptance.
Land use must be optimised to 
balance carbon sequestration with 
other priorities. New forestry can 
provide a net carbon sink for decades 
during growth and bring wider 
environmental benefits. Biomass 
crops, when regularly harvested for 
energy (coupled with CCS), offer more 
intensive and indefinite sequestration. 
To make an impact by 2050, planting 
must begin in earnest soon, 
supported by a deepening of the 
evidence base on the carbon and 
non-carbon costs and benefits.
Net Zero means a profound 
transition away from fossil fuels. 
While an 80% target still saw fossil 
fuel’s share of final energy use at 
50%, Net Zero sees that fall to 25% 
(mostly in aviation and industry, 
where alternatives are hard to see).
Therefore, zero carbon energy 
vectors require unprecedented 
scale-up to dominate final energy 
use. With few exceptions, final energy 
must be delivered by vectors that are 
zero carbon at point of use, i.e. 
electricity, hydrogen and district  
heat. By 2050:
• A new low carbon hydrogen 
economy will need to be created, 
delivering up to 300TWh per 
annum, roughly equivalent to 
electricity generation today.
• Electricity generation itself may 
have to double, or even treble if 
most hydrogen is to be produced 
by electrolysis.
• District heat may need to deliver 
up to 150TWh per annum, up from 
12TWh today.
Beyond bulk energy provision,  
a significant increase in different 
types of storage and flexibility is 
needed. While we have seen major 
innovation and deployment of fast-
reacting battery technology in recent 
years, we are going to need similar 
innovations in multi-vector storage 
technologies across different 
timescales (from seconds to seasons), 
to manage extreme weather 
conditions with minimal reliance on 
unabated fossil fuel back-up systems. 
A significant opportunity exists for 
distributed heat storage in those 
millions of homes that will transition 
to heat pumps.
The transport sector requires the 
greatest increase in ambition from 
previous 80% pathways and must 
be fundamentally transformed by 
2050. Emissions headroom allowed 
for continued fossil fuel use in every 
transport category, often with hybrid 
and plug-in hybrid vehicles for  
partial decarbonisation. For Net Zero, 
road transport requires the virtual 
elimination of fossil fuel consumption. 
Electrification is the most likely route, 
with hydrogen fuel cell vehicles 
playing an important role especially  
in heavier vehicles. Enabling smart 
charging will be essential to allow  
an efficient and smooth transition  
to electrified transport.
Emissions from shipping can  
be tackled through switching to 
hydrogen/ammonia-fuelled shipping, 
but global coordination will be 
required if UK emissions are to  
be substantially reduced.
CCS and bioenergy 
are both essential 
to delivering  
Net Zero.

4. Direct support for innovation  
and early deployment of CCS and 
hydrogen production in industrial 
clusters, including the development 
of investable funding mechanisms 
for CO2 transport and storage 
infrastructure.
5. Fundamental reform of power 
markets to improve the efficiency 
of the system and unlock the 
potential of flexibility and 
distributed low carbon technologies. 
This includes providing more 
accurate time-of-use and locational 
signals, thus strengthening 
incentives for supply and demand  
to match user needs and local 
system circumstances.
6. Creation and adoption of an open 
energy data and digitalisation 
governance framework in  
line with recommendations of  
the Energy Data Taskforce. This  
can maximise the potential of 
digitalisation to enable tailored 
consumer-focused innovation, 
business models, market designs 
and consumer protections in the 
transformation of the energy 
system ahead. 
7. Development of tradable 
instruments such as carbon  
credits, and associated market 
arrangements, to enable capital  
to flow to sectors where emissions 
reductions are being delivered 
most efficiently. This approach 
could unlock greater pathway 
flexibility and increase the scope 
for markets to reveal least-cost 
combinations.
Robust and enduring policies  
and regulation will be essential to 
building the necessary confidence 
with innovators to invest in low 
carbon products and services.  
This report sets out an extensive 
programme of policy and regulatory 
reforms we think are necessary to 
unlock the innovation that our 
modelling analysis shows is required. 
These policy recommendations are 
detailed in ‘What needs to happen  
during this Parliament’ on page 50.  
These include:
1. Developing a balanced, economy-
wide framework of low carbon 
economic incentives (comprising  
a mix of market, pricing and 
regulatory interventions) to shape 
market incentives for actors 
throughout emitting sectors  
of the economy.
2. Urgent development and gradual 
introduction of an enduring set of 
policies to fully decarbonise energy 
in buildings, crucially including 
regulatory incentives to promote 
adoption of low or zero carbon 
heating and changes to regulation 
of energy networks.
3. To reflect the different mix of  
low carbon solutions needed in 
different parts of the UK, introduce 
a consistent and robust approach 
to Local Area Energy Planning, 
potentially with the backing  
of a statutory framework. This  
will help identify the low carbon 
infrastructure and investment 
needed at a local level, and shape 
decision making by network 
companies, developers and 
planners.
Decarbonising heat will rely  
on deep retrofits for millions  
of homes and some mixture of 
electric heat pumps, hydrogen 
boilers and district heating 
depending on local circumstances. 
Eliminating emissions from buildings 
is one of the most difficult challenges 
facing the energy sector, and requires 
significant technological and 
behavioural innovation. Our pathways 
suggest declining usage of the gas 
networks, as the deployment of heat 
pumps and heat networks gathers 
pace, weakening their economic case. 
If they are to continue operating, 
these networks will have to switch  
to hydrogen by 2045, which was  
not obviously necessary with an  
80% target.
In some scenarios, parts of the gas 
network are decommissioned. In 
other areas these networks remain 
strategically important, especially 
where the average quality of the 
building stock means a full switch  
to electrified heating would be  
too costly. Here, gas networks  
are maintained despite reduced 
utilisation, supporting homes  
with hybrid heating systems. This 
underlines the importance of 
understanding local pathways 
to low carbon heating.
The uptake of unfamiliar low carbon 
heating technologies like heat pumps 
and heat networks will likely require 
new market propositions which are 
as good or better for consumers 
than their current heating systems. 
Innovation, including harnessing the 
potential of digital technology to give 
people more control of their heating 
and developing service offerings, will 
be needed.
Our pathways 
suggest declining 
usage of the gas 
networks, as the 
deployment of 
heat pumps and 
heat networks 
gathers pace, 
weakening their 
economic case.
Robust and 
enduring policies 
and regulation  
will be essential  
to building  
the necessary 
confidence with 
innovators to 
invest in low 
carbon products 
and services.

The CCC advice
The CCC’s Net Zero report built 
upon their earlier work exploring 
individual parts of the energy 
system. These publications on 
land use, hydrogen, biomass etc 
drew on insights from several 
different sources, including 
modelling supported by tools 
such as ESC’s Energy System 
Modelling Environment (ESME). 
The CCC set out:
• Core actions consistent with 
balanced pathways to reach 
80% against 1990 levels;
• Further Ambition measures 
to achieve a stretch target in 
each sector. Taken together 
across all sectors, these add up 
to a reduction of roughly 96%;
• Speculative measures across 
various sectors which, in some 
combination, would be 
necessary to achieve 100%  
or Net Zero. These measures 
are typically higher cost, less 
mature, or rely more heavily  
on social change.
Global context
The UK thus became the first 
major economy to adopt a Net 
Zero target, and many other 
countries have now followed, 
accounting for a substantial 
portion of global economic 
activity2. While there are notable 
laggards, these countries can 
expect to face increasing 
pressure from the Net Zero  
bloc of countries as well as  
from domestic movements at 
grassroots, city or regional level, 
and increasingly from the  
private sector.
For many of the technologies 
necessary for Net Zero, there will 
be a strong global component in 
terms of research and innovation, 
early demonstration, and supply 
chains for deployment at scale. 
Wider global investment in these 
areas will be essential in enabling 
the UK to deliver on its targets. 
But Net Zero also presents a 
huge opportunity for UK 
innovators. The advantages 
gained through early 
demonstration and deployment 
of novel technologies and 
business models creates 
significant export potential. ESC 
has created support platforms  
for innovators for just this reason 
(see page 62).
In 2018, the IPCC published 
evidence on what would be 
required for a 1.5°C limit and  
the implications of not doing so.
Given this evidence, the  
UK Government asked for  
advice from the Committee  
on Climate Change (CCC). The 
CCC responded in May 2019, 
recommending a Net Zero 
emissions target by 2050. This 
was accompanied by supporting 
research, including ESC’s Living 
Carbon Free1 report which set out 
the implications for households.
The CCC report was released in 
the context of increasing public 
concern about climate change in 
the UK and around the world, 
with street protests, school pupils 
on strike, and public figures 
speaking out on the need to  
act urgently.
In June 2019, the Government 
amended the Climate Change  
Act from 80% to 100% GHG 
emissions reduction – or Net 
Zero – by 2050. ‘Net’ means 
balancing any residual emissions 
with an equal quantity of carbon 
removals from the atmosphere, 
as long as this takes place in  
the UK.
Emissions Accounting
The analysis conducted here 
follows territorial emissions 
accounting, as legislated in the 
UK Climate Change Act. This 
measures all emissions that 
physically arise in a country, 
including in the production  
of goods destined for  
overseas markets.
As a net importer of traded 
goods, this ignores a significant 
proportion of the emissions that 
result from what we consume in 
the UK. Indeed, while territorial 
emissions have nearly halved 
since 1990, the carbon footprint 
associated with overall 
consumption in the UK has 
remained high3.
Paying close attention to these 
consumption emissions can help 
us avoid measures that reduce 
UK territorial emissions by simply 
offshoring hard-to-treat activities 
to other countries. It would also 
help UK citizens to understand 
and reduce the true global 
impact of our activities.

Finally, we are engaging with  
the general public to test 
awareness around climate 
change and Net Zero, and to 
explore attitudes regarding  
the sorts of technologies and 
lifestyle changes described in  
this work. Early evidence 
suggests a general willingness  
to adopt new technologies (such 
as new heating or mobility) as 
long as these can deliver the 
same experiences as before. 
Conversely, approaching the 
subject of dietary change or 
aviation often elicits a more 
resistant and emotional response.
Our Net Zero Insights 
programme
This modelling analysis is part  
of a wider programme exploring 
the implications of Net Zero 
across a portfolio of technologies 
and solutions. This includes 
engineering deep dives into the 
role of floating offshore wind; 
advanced nuclear technologies; 
storage and flexibility solutions; 
and hydrogen (including fuel 
cells) in buildings. We are also 
looking at the role of enabling 
trends, such as digitalisation of 
the energy system, and how this 
can help accelerate progress and 
reduce cost (but also creates  
new risks), as well as the market, 
policy and regulatory changes 
needed to achieve Net Zero. This 
fits within ESC’s wider work on 
the future energy system.
Finally, before and since the  
CCC advice, other groups have 
shared their own views on how 
and when the target should be 
achieved. Some of these entail  
a more renewables-based 
approach, greater focus on 
demand reduction, pathways 
involving higher or lower reliance 
on biomass, or those that require 
dramatic changes in people’s 
behaviours. Some groups have 
even called for Net Zero as early 
as 2025.
While the Net Zero discourse 
deserves a variety of perspectives, 
the analytical basis for these is 
not always made clear. In 
particular, ESC’s wider Net Zero 
Insights programme includes 
early work assessing the public’s 
willingness to significantly adapt 
their lifestyles, and suggests that 
it is right to be cautious about 
pathways that rely too heavily on 
aggressive reduction in carbon-
intensive behaviours such as 
aviation. While assumptions 
should be challenged, our goal 
is to show ‘what you have to 
believe’ in order to deliver  
Net Zero.
What does our  
analysis add?
In this report, we detail new 
systems modelling conducted 
explicitly to meet Net Zero. This 
enables us to explore optimal 
pathways under different 
conditions, finding similarities 
and differences between them. 
Crucially, it allows us to 
understand how important 
individual technologies are in 
meeting the Net Zero target, 
partly through testing 
sensitivities. This allows us to 
identify where deployment  
is most valuable and urgent.
Such systems modelling  
allows us to identify areas 
where innovation – the 
creation and deployment of 
new technologies, products 
and services – has the most 
potential value. This may help 
identify where the greatest 
commercial opportunities lie and 
where policy attention is most 
needed.
This analysis draws out insights 
not just about what the 2050 
energy system might look like, 
but also about the potential 
pathways over the next 30 
years, as detailed in our 
scenarios on page 20.
We have adopted the concepts of 
Further Ambition and Speculative 
measures for the analysis shared 
in this report (see page 16).
The central message from the 
CCC is the need for economy-
wide change: there is likely  
to be a doubling of electricity 
demand driven by the greater 
electrification of heat and 
transport; Carbon Capture and 
Storage (CCS) is now a necessity; 
and the use of hydrogen will be 
needed in industry, heat and 
heavy transport sectors like HGVs 
and shipping. Supporting more 
sustainable lifestyles can also 
help to deal with those emissions 
that are hardest to reduce 
through technology.
Early evidence suggests  
a general willingness  
to adopt new technologies 
(such as new heating or 
mobility) as long as these 
can deliver the same 
experiences as before.

ESC’s mission is to 
unleash innovation 
and open new markets 
to capture the clean 
growth opportunity. 
Reflecting this approach, we have 
developed a set of modelling 
assets for every level of the 
energy system, from top-down, 
economy-wide whole system 
models, to models of the physics 
of individual housing types. We 
also have simulation tools and 
consumer research assets, which 
can help innovators explore and 
test their new business ideas. 
• energy integration at all levels 
from national, regional and 
local, down to individual 
buildings
• energy data and digitalisation
• energy markets, policy and 
regulation
We work with industry, 
Government and academia to 
identify and overcome systemic 
barriers and unlock those 
opportunities that will transform 
the energy system and deliver 
maximum benefit to society.
We have a strong digital 
capability, which can provide 
platforms on which to test new 
ideas, manage datasets and 
extract insights from large 
quantities of data.
Our Insights Team have drawn 
upon a range of these capabilities 
and assets in preparing this 
report, but the key modelling tool 
we have drawn upon is our Energy 
System Modelling Environment, 
detailed on page 16.
Taking a whole system approach 
is integral to this mission, and our 
capabilities include coverage of:
• energy consumers, their 
expectations and attitudes
• energy end-use technologies 
in buildings, transport and 
industry
• energy vectors like power, 
hydrogen, heat, biofuels
• energy infrastructure for 
transmission, distribution  
and storage

In ESME, the first three represent 
optional extra technologies or 
resources. Activating these simply 
means making them available for 
the model to deploy if doing so 
would reduce overall system  
cost. The other three are fixed 
exogenous assumptions. When 
activated, they necessarily take 
effect, reducing the scale of 
emissions reduction required 
within the energy system.
• More UK forestry. Normally 
assumes tree planting of 30 
kha annually to 2050 (i.e. 22 
MtCO2/yr sequestered in 2050). 
Speculative assumes 50 kha 
annually (33 MtCO2/yr 
sequestered in 2050).
• Reduced livestock. Normally 
assumes a decline in meat/
dairy consumption of 20% 
(delivering 8 MtCO2e saving in 
2050 versus today). Speculative 
assumes a decline of 50%  
(19 MtCO2e saved).
• Slower aviation demand 
growth. Normally assumes  
an increase in passenger 
demand of 60% vs 2005 levels. 
Speculative holds this to only 
20% growth.
Expanding the technology 
option set
The previous options in ESME 
were sufficient for exploring 80% 
pathways. However, with tighter 
targets, ESME reached a limit of 
about 90% before running out of 
options for further abatement. 
This portfolio has now been 
enhanced and expanded. New 
options have been added for 
ships fuelled by hydrogen/
ammonia, and options for 
decarbonisation of industry via 
electrification or hydrogen have 
been extended. Options for 
off-road mobile machinery to 
transition away from fossil fuels 
have also been added.
This new ‘robust’ option set 
enables ESME to reach 96%, 
equivalent to CCC’s Further 
Ambition. From here, further 
speculative measures are 
needed to reach Net Zero.
Addition of Speculative 
measures
These comprise six measures 
including further technology 
innovation, behaviour change, 
and land use change:
• Direct air carbon capture 
and storage. Normally limited 
to a marginal role at 1MtCO2/yr 
in 2050. Speculative allows this 
in 2040, scaling to 25 MtCO2/yr 
in 2050.
• 99% carbon capture rate. 
Normally limited to 95% 
capture rate. Speculative allows 
CCS to achieve 99% capture 
rates, with cost and energy 
penalties based on expert 
engineering assessment.
• More UK biomass. Normally 
the available sustainable 
quantity rises to ~120TWh/yr 
by 2050. Speculative allows for 
an additional 25TWh/yr.
ESME is designed to be neutral  
in market, policy and regulatory 
assumptions. Policy analysis  
can draw upon insights from 
modelling, but these are typically 
not imposed on the model 
except in constructing specific 
scenarios. This approach allows 
for first examining the underlying 
cost and engineering challenges 
of meeting consumer needs, 
before considering whether and 
how to drive such outcomes.
ESME Net Zero update
ESME has been significantly 
upgraded so that credible 
transitions to Net Zero can  
be explored. These upgrades 
have drawn upon internal ESC 
expertise, key sources in the 
literature, and a series of 
workshops with sector experts.
Widening the scope of 
emissions
ESME is primarily a tool for 
exploring energy systems, where 
CO2 makes up by far the largest 
share of GHGs. But emissions in 
other sectors affect the ambition 
needed in energy, including 
negative emissions. Accounting 
for all GHGs now allows us to 
better represent the impact of 
non-energy activities including 
livestock, land use change  
and forestry.
Energy System 
Modelling 
Environment (ESME)
ESME was developed to evaluate 
the role of innovation in UK 
energy system decarbonisation, 
from energy resources and 
conversion through to end use in 
buildings, transport and industry. 
It is used by ESC, Government, 
industry, the Committee on 
Climate Change and academia.
ESME is an optimisation model 
and finds the least-cost 
combination of energy resources 
and technologies that satisfy UK 
energy service demands along 
the pathway to 2050. Constraints 
include emissions targets, 
resource availability and 
technology deployment rates, as 
well as operational factors that 
ensure adequate system capacity 
and flexibility.
Importantly, ESME includes a 
multi-regional UK representation 
and can assess the infrastructure 
needed to join up resources, 
technologies and demands 
across the country. This includes 
transmission and distribution 
networks for electricity and  
gas, and pipelines and storage 
for CO2.
Since technology innovation is 
inherently uncertain, ESME was 
designed with a Monte Carlo 
mode, allowing us to run 
hundreds of simulations in  
one batch exploring different 
assumptions. This helps  
us identify ‘low-regrets’ 
technologies which feature 
consistently, or to understand  
the cost and performance 
characteristics required for 
individual technologies before 
these begin to deploy.

To generate a consistent Net 
Zero ‘baseline’ for our sensitivity 
runs, we started from the 
TECH100 assumptions. Our 
sensitivity runs include cases 
where a single solution is 
removed from the option set, 
such as No Biomass, No CCS or 
No (new) Nuclear. We also tested 
interesting combinations, e.g. 
ruling out Power CCS and 
Nuclear together to test the 
impact of No low carbon 
baseload.
We also asked: what would it take 
to achieve Net Zero earlier than 
2050? This requires modifications 
to our exogenous demand 
assumptions that go beyond the 
speculative measures already 
discussed, resulting in a MAX 
sensitivity run (see page 45).
We laid the foundations for our 
core Clockwork scenario by using 
the TECH100 assumptions, while 
Patchwork uses the SOC100 set. 
More detail on the underpinning 
assumptions are detailed in the 
next chapter.
Building scenarios
We have constructed a few 
different high-level scenarios to 
support our analysis, including:
• FA96 – Further Ambition 96% 
target only, with no speculative 
measures.
• TECH100 – Net Zero target 
with more technology-based 
measures: direct air capture, 
higher capture rates and extra 
biomass resource.
• SOC100 – Net Zero target with 
more society-based measures: 
more UK forestry, reduced 
livestock and slower aviation 
growth.
• BOB100 – Net Zero target with 
the ‘best of both’: technology 
and society-based measures.
BOB100 allows us to explore the 
largest possible ‘solution space’ 
for Net Zero pathways. However, 
planning on the basis that all 
speculative measures could be 
realised is inherently risky, so we 
prefer to apply these more 
selectively when choosing our 
‘core’ scenarios (see next chapter).

This chapter describes 
two potential energy 
system pathways to 
Net Zero in 2050, 
Clockwork and 
Patchwork. 
While these are not meant to  
be predictions or recommended 
pathways, they do explore two 
very different approaches to how 
the UK’s decarbonisation targets 
could be met, highlighting some  
of the key challenges and 
opportunities any approach 
would face.
Clockwork
– a centralised 
pathway to Net Zero
In Clockwork, coordination from 
central Government drives long 
term investment in strategic 
energy infrastructure. In the 
power sector, nuclear and wind 
generation are underpinned by 
policies that support development 
of the supply chain and 
workforce needed.
Recognition of the value of 
negative emissions leads to the 
creation of the necessary markets 
for the steady deployment of 
greenhouse gas removals 
technologies including carbon 
capture and storage (CCS), 
domestically grown biomass, 
afforestation and direct air 
carbon capture and storage 
(DACCS). Innovation in CCS 
pushes capture rates to 99%. 
A supply of UK grown biomass is 
established, reaching 1.4 million 
hectares (mha) of land. This, 
along with residues from the 
30,000 hectares of forest planted 
each year, provides 140TWh of 
domestic biomass in 2050.
Thanks to innovations in 
technology, policy and business 
models, the impact on people’s 
lives is relatively modest. Indoor 
temperatures continue to rise  
to an average of 21°C by 2050 
from around 18°C today. People 
still prefer to own cars and 
international travel demand 
continues to increase. However, a 
general shift towards vegetarian 
and vegan diets leads to a 20% 
reduction in meat and dairy 
consumption by 2050.
The UK population grows by  
five million from today to 71.5 
million by 2050. This growth is 
concentrated in the South East, 
but there is a continued move 
towards suburban living.
Patchwork 
– a decentralised 
pathway to Net Zero
In Patchwork, central Government 
takes less of a leading role, 
resulting in a patchwork of 
regional low carbon strategies.  
A programme for large nuclear 
plants does not progress beyond 
Hinkley Point C and two others, 
although regions with a history 
of nuclear power favour small 
modular reactors (SMRs). In 
contrast, the popularity of 
renewables means offshore wind, 
distributed solar PV and other 
renewable energy technologies 
supply most of the electricity.
Without clear central policy on 
negative emissions and storage 
of CO2, a UK biomass supply 
struggles to grow. However 
public support for woodland  
sees planting rates of 50,000 
hectares per year, which is able  
to contribute to the domestic 
supply of 80TWh of biomass  
by 2050. A delayed recognition  
of the importance of negative 
emissions means the UK turns  
to biomass imports to top-up 
domestic supply. CCS is first 
deployed five years later than  
in Clockwork and capture rates 
do not go beyond 95%, while 
deployment of Direct air capture 
is negligible.
The population is very engaged 
with the climate change agenda 
adopting a number of lifestyle 
changes to help reduce 
greenhouse gas emissions. 
Consumption of meat and dairy 
halves by 2050. A combination  
of consumer choice and smart 
heating controls means the 
average indoor temperature  
of homes levels out at 19.5°C. 
International aviation demand 
slows to 2035, then begins to  
fall back.
The UK population grows by  
8.5 million to reach 75 million by 
2050. There is greater migration 
of people to cities leading to a 
slowing of growth in car travel 
demand as people live closer  
to work and have greater  
access to public transport.
Gas networks
Gas usage begins to decline in 
the 2030s, then more rapidly  
in the 2040s as deployment of 
heat networks and electric heat 
pumps gather pace. In some 
areas, parts of the gas network 
are decommissioned. In other 
areas these networks remain 
strategically important, especially 
where the average quality of the 
building stock means a full switch 
to electrified heating would be 
too costly. Here, gas networks 
are maintained despite reduced 
utilisation, supporting homes 
with hybrid heating systems 
comprised of an electric heat 
pump and gas boiler.
Those areas where networks  
are retained must undergo a 
hydrogen switchover, beginning 
in 2040. By 2050, most homes still 
connected to gas networks are 
being supplied with hydrogen.
District heating
In major population centres 
around the UK, large district  
heat networks are rolled out 
from 2030 onwards. Since high 
uptake rates are essential to the 
economics of heat networks, 
local strategic planning is 
required to identify those areas 
where heat networks offer 
customers the best, most cost-
effective solution.
Gas and biomass CHP plants  
help to seed early, small-scale 
networks. As these begin to  
grow and connect up, heat  
is also recovered from large 
thermal power plants. Eventually, 
as carbon constraints begin to 
limit the operation of CHP and 
thermal power plants, nuclear 
small modular reactors are 
deployed to provide the bulk  
of the heat into these networks. 
Gas CHP facilities remain in 
service at very low loads, 
providing flexibility and 
resilience, before this duty  
is taken over by hydrogen  
boilers by 2050.
Clockwork deep dive
Buildings and heat
Retrofit measures are applied to 
ten million homes at E-G rating, 
reducing their space heating 
demand by 20-30%. However, in 
many homes this leads to further 
‘comfort taking’, with average 
indoor temperature following an 
upward trend to 2050. Despite 
increasing temperatures,  
new building standards and 
retrofits mean overall energy 
consumption for space heating 
remains similar to today.
Electrification
In thermally efficient homes, 
electric heat pumps are installed 
as standalone systems. In less 
efficient homes, these are 
typically installed as part of a 
hybrid system, with gaseous 
heating providing supplementary 
heat for peaks and cold spells. 
This arrangement reduces the 
strain on the electricity grid 
during peak periods and 
minimises the capital cost of 
home heating systems by sizing 
heat pumps to meet baseload 
heat only. By 2050, 58% of the 
UK’s domestic space heat demand 
is supplied by heat pumps.

Increased electrification of road 
transport has multiple benefits: 
firstly decarbonisation, with 
petroleum products making up 
less than 10% of the energy 
consumed for transport in 2050, 
delivering a 97% reduction in  
the associated CO2 emissions 
compared to 2020; secondly, 
improved energy efficiency, with 
2050 energy consumption for 
road transport being just over a 
third of that in 2020 despite the 
numbers of vehicles on the road 
increasing; and finally, improved 
air quality from the virtual 
elimination of tailpipe emissions.
Industry
There is an overall growth  
in industry to 2050, but a 
combination of energy efficiency 
improvements and a gradual shift 
away from more energy intensive 
activities means industrial energy 
consumption actually decreases 
by 19% by 2035. Energy 
consumption levels off to 2050  
as efficiency improvements  
are balanced against expansion 
of industrial activity.
Industrial carbon capture  
and storage
Some industrial sectors adopt 
carbon capture processes from 
2030. CCS is predominantly 
applied to the heavy industries 
(iron and steel, chemicals, cement) 
located in industrial clusters. 
These are areas where industries 
are in close proximity to each 
other. Clusters tend to be located 
in coastal regions enabling access 
to the offshore CO2 storage sites. 
By 2050, 28mtCO2 is captured by 
industry directly.
Road transport
The Government ban on new 
ICEs prompts manufacturers  
to release a range of hybrid  
and electric vehicles (EVs).  
Plug-in hybrids see a relatively 
modest uptake, with EVs being 
the preferred option both  
from the point of view of the 
manufacturers, who focus  
efforts on producing vehicles 
with a single powertrain, and  
the consumer, now satisfied  
with the range possible on a 
single charge.
Hydrogen fuel cell cars are too 
expensive compared to EVs and 
fail to compete in this market. 
However, hydrogen is used in 
heavy goods vehicles as both  
a primary fuel and as a way of 
extending the range on battery 
electric trucks.
Transport
Demand for transport in 
Clockwork continues to increase 
with people less prepared to 
make lifestyle changes to reduce 
reliance on privately owned  
cars or curb their appetite  
for flights abroad.
Aviation and shipping
The number of international 
flights continues to increase,  
with the average distance flown 
by people in the UK reaching  
an average of nearly 7,500km  
per year by 2050. New engine 
and aircraft designs increase 
efficiencies through to 2050, 
improving the fuel consumption 
of aircraft. However, without  
new, low-carbon propulsion 
technologies, aviation is unable 
to move away from fossil fuels.
Heavy fuel oil ships are phased 
out completely by 2040. A 
transition to dual fuel ships 
burning a combination of fuel  
oil and natural gas starts in the 
2020s. Hydrogen-fuelled ships 
become available in the 2040s. 
Most ships operating from the 
UK are fuelled by hydrogen in 
2050 resulting in a complete 
decarbonisation of the sector.

The emissions headroom created 
in other sectors, alongside short 
periods of operation, means 
capture rates of 95% on CCGTs 
are sufficient, providing a cost 
saving compared to 99% systems. 
These technologies provide a 
back-up role during the peak 
demand periods. Therefore, annual 
electricity supplied by these two 
technologies is approximately 1% 
of the total in 2050 (Figure 5). 
Further day-to-day flexibility  
is also provided by 8GW of 
electricity storage and 10GW  
of interconnectors.
Power
Clockwork sees extensive 
electrification of road transport, 
heating and industry which  
leads to 524TWh of electricity 
consumed in 2050 (up from 
around 300TWh in 2015).  
Of the electricity supplied, 
approximately 40% is delivered 
by onshore and offshore wind, 
and 50% by nuclear generation.
Flexible generation in 2050 is 
provided by 6GW of combined 
cycle gas turbines with CCS and 
22GW of hydrogen turbines.  
Industrial fuel switching
In addition to efficiency measures 
and CCS, industries adopt a 
range of fuel switches from high 
carbon fossil fuels to biomass, 
hydrogen and electricity. Some 
industries also switch processes 
that use high carbon fuels to  
gas in an effort to decarbonise. 
Hydrogen replaces natural gas 
and liquid fuels in a number  
of industries including both 
clustered and dispersed sites. 
Hydrogen consumption in 
industry increases with the 
emergence of CCS in hydrogen 
production methods using 
natural gas or biomass. Industrial 
emissions reach roughly 12mtCO2 
in 2050.
Hydrogen
In 2050, around 250TWh of 
hydrogen is needed to meet 
demands for industry, space heat, 
flexible power generation and 
heavy-duty transport (including 
shipping). Emissions headroom 
created by 25MtCO2 of DACCS 
and high capture rate CCS (99%) 
means 216TWh of hydrogen can 
be produced by steam methane 
reformation with CCS. The 
remaining 34TWh is produced by 
biomass gasification with CCS.
Geological storage of 660GWh  
of hydrogen is needed in 2050  
to ensure homes with H2 boilers 
can be supplied with enough 
hydrogen during an extreme 
weather event during the winter. 
This is significantly less than the 
underground natural gas storage 
capacity on the system today 
(approximately 15,000 GWh).

District heating
In Patchwork, there is greater 
migration of the population to 
major cities, which are more 
suited for district heat networks. 
Early heat networks are small and 
most of the heat is provided by 
gas and biomass CHP systems. 
Heat offtake from thermal power 
generators provides additional 
energy as heat networks grow.
However, as carbon constraints 
begin to limit operation of these 
plants, heat must be provided by 
other means. Solutions depend 
on the region with some areas 
making use of geothermal 
resources, whilst others rely on 
large-scale heat pumps. Some 
areas adopt nuclear small 
modular reactors, exploiting the 
waste heat from these plants.
Flexibility and resilience of the 
heat networks is provided by  
gas CHP plants that remain in 
operation for the peak periods. 
By 2050, natural gas peaking 
systems are replaced with large 
scale hydrogen boilers.
Gas networks
Gas boilers play an important 
role in providing space and water 
heating in homes until the mid-
2040s. New boilers installed after 
2035 are hydrogen-ready in 
preparation for the big switch in 
2050 when natural gas ceases to 
play a role in domestic heating. 
These boilers provide peak heat 
during cold weather events and 
winter evenings for those homes 
not connected to a district  
heat network.
Electrification
A steadily growing heat pump 
market increases people’s 
confidence in the technology’s 
ability to satisfy their heating 
needs. From the mid-2030s, when 
people are faced with the need 
to replace their gas boilers,  
many opt to overhaul their entire 
heating system. Heat pumps are 
installed in combination with 
hydrogen-ready boilers, which 
provide a boost of heat during 
cold days.
Patchwork deep dive
Buildings and heat
Around 11.5 million homes  
of E-G rating are retrofitted  
by 2050, reducing space heat 
demand by 20-30%. Greater 
urbanisation means more people 
live in high-density dwellings 
with lower heat demands. The 
Patchwork population seek to 
reduce their carbon footprints  
by making changes to their 
lifestyles. For example, changes 
such as wearing additional warm 
layers rather than turning up  
the thermostat, and adoption  
of smart heating to better  
control where and when heat is 
provided, means average indoor 
temperatures are limited to an 
average of 19.5°C by 2050.

Road transport
Although private car ownership  
is less important to people in 
Patchwork, the number of cars  
on the road steadily increases  
to 2050. However, in response to 
the Government ban on ICEs and 
hybrids and consumer preference 
for low carbon transport, EVs 
become the most common type 
of car on the road by 2040.
Hydrogen fuel cell cars are less 
favoured due to their relative 
expense compared to EVs. Range 
anxiety and charging time is also 
less of an issue in a world where 
people are prepared to make 
changes to their behaviour and 
habits to accommodate low 
carbon options. Hydrogen finds  
its way into heavy goods vehicles 
either as a primary fuel or to 
extend the range of electric trucks.
Aviation and shipping
By 2050, the average distance 
travelled is 5,000km per person 
per year – equivalent to two 
short trips to Europe each year. 
These short haul journeys to  
the continent might one day  
be suitable for some form of 
low-carbon aircraft but this does 
not happen before 2050. So, to 
maintain an industry in a world 
where people are concerned with 
their individual carbon footprints, 
flight operators ensure that their 
aircraft are the most efficient on 
the market, retiring older planes 
when better ones become 
available.
Demand for international 
shipping rises steadily to 2050, 
partly in response to a shift  
away from air travel to Europe. 
However, by 2050, the 
international shipping fleet is 
almost entirely decarbonised 
through the use of hydrogen.
Transport
A combination of urbanisation, 
different working habits, and a 
positive public response to the 
need for climate action leads to  
a fall in demand for private car 
ownership. Instead a combination 
of public transport, walking and 
cycling is made possible by 
improved access to these 
transport modes and through 
effective town planning.
The flight shame movement 
resonates with a population  
that is concerned with reducing 
greenhouse gas emissions, and 
demand for international flights 
falls away from 2035.

Power
Very high levels of electrification 
are seen in Patchwork, which is 
needed to decarbonise transport, 
heating, industry, and provide 
hydrogen by electrolysis. 
Patchwork is a high renewables 
scenario with 53% of the 700TWh 
of electricity coming from on and 
offshore wind. Other renewables 
such as solar PV, tidal stream and 
geothermal supply another 21%. 
Due to intermittent supply and 
lower load factors compared to 
nuclear power, a total of 190GW of 
renewables capacity is deployed.
A programme for nuclear power 
fails to materialise due to low 
public support and a lack of 
policy which would de-risk 
investment and drive costs down 
through learning-by-doing. As  
a result, nuclear generation is 
limited to three large generation 
III plants. In addition, there is a 
handful of small modular reactors 
in regions with a history of 
nuclear power, eager for the jobs 
this industry provides. Even with 
this low deployment scenario, 
nuclear plants still supply 23% of 
the electricity produced in 2050.
To ensure supply during cold 
periods with low wind speeds, 
55GW of peaking plant is 
needed, including 30GW of 
hydrogen turbines. These make 
use of hydrogen produced by 
electrolysis during periods of 
high renewables output and low 
demand (such as the summer 
and overnight winter periods) 
and stored in salt caverns. 
Geological storage of 600GWh  
of hydrogen in 2050 provides  
a long-term storage option  
for electricity. 
Hydrogen
Production of hydrogen in 2050 
is a mix of biomass gasification 
with CCS and electrolysis, 
producing 65TWh and 110TWh  
in 2050 respectively. A small 
amount of steam methane 
reformation is also deployed but 
failure to innovate CCS systems 
to achieve capture rates beyond 
95% limits the amount of 
hydrogen that can be produced 
in this way to 11TWh.
Despite delays in CCS 
deployment and a lack of 
innovation in capture rates, 
biomass gasification remains  
of great value to the energy 
system because of the negative 
emissions that can be achieved. 
After 2035, a market for negative 
emissions begins to grow but a 
disjointed policy framework and 
scepticism from farmers means a 
supply chain of domestic biomass 
fails to reach its full potential. 
These factors combine to limit  
UK biomass to 80TWh in 2050 
prompting the UK to import 
additional biomass at extra cost. 
The majority of this biomass is 
used in hydrogen production, 
with some being used in industry 
and power generation.
There is great public support  
for the planting of trees in an 
effort to reduce greenhouse  
gas emissions. Planting rates of 
50,000 hectares per year of new 
woodland are achieved by 2050. 
Some of this woodland is planted 
on land previously set aside for 
grazing animals, which becomes 
available as meat and dairy 
consumption halves by 2050.
Industrial fuel switching
By 2050 industry as a whole  
has largely transitioned away 
from fossil fuels to the point  
that 68% of the energy required 
is provided by a combination  
of hydrogen, electricity and 
biomass. However, natural gas 
continues to play an important 
role in industry.
Use of hydrogen in industry 
is predominantly found in the 
dispersed industries. These 
industries may struggle to 
connect into a CCS network if 
they are located too far from  
an industrial cluster and so 
electrification and hydrogen 
provide low carbon solutions  
to provision of industrial heat.
Industry
In Patchwork, there is a decline  
in the traditional energy intensive 
industries as activity shifts 
towards high value engineering 
and services sectors. This,  
in combination with energy 
efficiency improvements, means 
industry in 2050 consumes 
approximately two thirds of  
the energy it does today.
Industrial carbon capture and 
storage
Due to a lack of national  
strategy on CCS, industrial CCS 
fails to emerge until 2035. CCS  
is deployed predominantly in 
industrial clusters where the 
remaining heavy industry is 
located, smaller industries that 
are closely located to clusters  
can also make use of the CO2 
pipelines laid for the larger point 
sources. Since these regions tend 
to be coastal there is good access 
to offshore CO2 storage sites.  
By 2050, 13Mt of industrial CO2 
emissions are being captured. 
Net emissions from the whole of 
industry fall from approximately 
100MtCO2 today to 10MtCO2  
in 2050.

However, during cold weather 
events, hydrogen is also needed 
to provide domestic heat by 
hybrid systems. Competing uses 
of hydrogen during peak periods 
means 20GW of gas turbines 
operating with CCS are also 
necessary. Both the hydrogen 
and gas plants operate with a 
very low load factor, providing 
just 1% of the total electricity 
supplied in 2050. Interconnection 
with Europe and 4GW of 
electricity storage also support 
peak provision of power in 2050.

The scenarios in the 
previous section allow 
us to illustrate the key 
features of individual 
pathways in some 
detail. 
But the real power of models  
like ESME is in generating  
many such pathways under  
very different assumptions, to 
support decision-making under 
uncertainty. In this section we 
share the emerging insights from 
the wider set of runs conducted 
with ESME Net Zero to date.
The Net Zero  
solution space
In modelling, the set of all 
possible solutions to a problem  
is known as the solution space. 
For ESME, the problem is to  
meet energy service demands 
out to 2050, by deploying a set  
of technologies and resources, 
subject to a set of constraints, 
including carbon emissions.
Monte Carlo analysis gives us 
many different ‘solutions’, which 
act as a guide to the overall 
solution space. The edges of this 
space close in as the problem 
gets harder due to higher 
demands, fewer technology 
options, or tighter constraints 
(until, at a certain point, there  
are no solutions). The switch to  
a Net Zero emissions target has, 
unsurprisingly, significantly 
reduced the solution space.
In ESME’s Monte Carlo mode, 
demands and constraints remain 
fixed across simulations. This way 
we can establish, other things 
being equal, the impact of 
particular technological 
innovations on the cost and 
configuration of the energy 
system. In reality, demand 
trajectories are uncertain too,  
so we explore these through 
separate batches of runs based 
on alternative demand cases.
An 80% emissions target 
allowed for a sizeable quantity  
of residual emissions in 2050. 
This provided considerable slack 
and meant the possible solution 
space was relatively large. 
Although some technologies 
appeared prominently, in all 
cases they could be removed 
from the option set and the 
model could still meet the carbon 
target by configuring the system 
in some other way.
At Further Ambition 96%  
the system has very little slack. 
Certain technologies become 
indispensable regardless of cost 
and removing these from the 
option set leads to failure to 
meet the emissions target. Those 
simulations that do meet the 
target now closely resemble  
each other and many more 
constraints are binding, such  
as maximum deployment rates 
for technologies. Adjusting such 
constraints can have a significant 
impact under distressed 
conditions like this, so it is 
important that these are 
informed by proper engineering 
analysis and advice (see Timelines 
on page 47).
Achieving Net Zero requires  
the introduction of speculative 
measures (see ESME Net Zero 
update on page 16). Adopting  
all of these, including social  
and technological measures, 
reintroduces some slack and 
substitutability even though the 
emissions reduction constraint  
is tightened to 100%.

Power sector
The charts on the left are outputs  
from the power sector from  
three Monte Carlo batches 
corresponding to the old 80% 
target, Further Ambition (FA96), 
and a highly speculative Net Zero 
(BOB100). The charts depict 2050 
power capacity across 100 
simulations.
Moving from the 80% to FA96, 
the reduced variation across 
simulations is immediately 
apparent. In 80%, ESME has 
considerable freedom to respond 
to high/low cost trajectories for 
different technologies and select 
the cost-optimal combinations.  
In FA96, these cost variations  
still occur, but ESME has little 
freedom to adjust its choice  
of technologies.
In BOB100, sufficient  
speculative measures are  
added to overcompensate for  
the more stringent Net Zero 
target, thus we see more 
variation reintroduced across 
simulations. Some of the more 
specific factors behind these 
trends are discussed next.

per simulation
In the BOB100 world though, 
thermal CCS can achieve a 99% 
capture rate (and other measures 
elsewhere add some emissions 
headroom). Now, there is a  
clear competition between  
this technology and nuclear.
Overall capacity: These  
features also help explain why 
the simulations in BOB100 have 
lower power capacity in general, 
compared to FA96. In 2050, 
hydrogen becomes an essential 
energy vector in either world (see 
Figure 11). In FA96 this is mostly 
produced through electrolysis, 
pushing up electricity demand 
considerably.
In BOB100, greater emissions 
headroom and the 99% capture 
rate makes steam methane 
reforming an attractive 
technology for production of  
the vast quantities of hydrogen 
needed in 2050. In fact,  
BOB100 tends to involve greater 
quantities of hydrogen overall 
than in FA96, since lower-cost 
hydrogen makes it more 
competitive against electrification 
in sectors like heavy-duty 
transport.
This analysis suggests that 
innovation to achieve 99% 
capture rates could prove 
transformative for the prospects 
of CCS in power and hydrogen 
(also see CCS section on page 34) 
beyond 2040.
Power CCS: For similar reasons, 
even CCS-equipped thermal 
plant is locked out of FA96. This 
is because carbon capture rates 
are capped at 95%, meaning 5% 
of combustion emissions still 
escape to the atmosphere,  
and the lack of any speculative 
measures means the overall 
emissions headroom in the 
system is severely constrained. 
This proves so prohibitive that 
nuclear is selected as the 
alternative baseload plant. 
Unabated thermal plant:  
In FA96 there is no role for 
unabated thermal plant, such as 
open or closed cycle gas turbines 
due to the emissions, even at  
low load factors, making them 
uneconomic. However, in a 
BOB100 world, for some 
simulations a small amount of 
unabated thermal is deemed 
manageable, given negative 
emissions elsewhere.

Biomass resource can be 
exploited through simple 
combustion for power or heat,  
or through conversion into  
liquid bio-fuels, bio-methane  
or hydrogen. Since conversion  
to bio-fuels and bio-methane 
transfers some of the carbon 
back into the atmosphere upon 
use, greater negative emissions 
are derived from BECCS 
processes that deliver carbon-
free vectors, like electricity and 
hydrogen.
But the relative substitutability  
of different applications also 
matters. Since there are more  
low carbon options for power 
generation, limited biomass 
resource tends to be prioritised 
for hydrogen production (or 
hard-to-treat industry processes).
Biomass
Dedicated biomass crops are an 
important part of a cost-effective 
low carbon energy system. Like 
forestry, biomass crops sequester 
carbon from the atmosphere 
during growth. When harvested 
and processed for energy, this 
has the potential to be a near 
carbon neutral resource4. When 
bioenergy is combined with  
CCS (BECCS) the sequestered 
carbon can be removed from  
the atmospheric carbon cycle 
permanently, resulting in 
negative lifecycle emissions.
Unlike forestry, where 
sequestration from a given  
land area will eventually level  
out, regular harvesting of energy 
crops gives the potential for 
sequestration to be sustained 
indefinitely5.
System-wide 
sensitivity analysis
Land use for biomass  
and forestry
Forestry
In line with the CCC and others, 
our central assumption sees 
expansion of forestry from 13% 
today to 18% of UK land by 2050, 
or 4.8 Mha. New forestry acts as 
a carbon sink during its growth, 
before levelling off in later years. 
Allowing for this, and assuming 
steady tree planting over the 
30-year period, this expansion 
would provide carbon removals 
of -22 MtCO2e annually in 2050.
In addition to acting as a carbon 
sink, afforestation (and other 
habitat restoration) would support 
the recovery of biodiversity across 
UK ecosystems, and increase the 
amount of green space for people 
to enjoy.
Innovation needs for biomass:
• Deepen the evidence base 
around optimal land use and 
land management to improve 
yields, maintain soil quality  
and biodiversity.
• Improve biomass feedstock 
improvement techniques to 
remove impurities prior to 
energy conversion.
• RD&D of biomass conversion 
technologies, especially 
gasification for hydrogen 
production.
• Maximising the value of 
biomass will rely on CCS (see 
page 34) to enable negative 
emissions.
In a Net Zero context, the 
impact is more profound. We 
anticipate continued emissions 
from aviation, livestock, and parts 
of industry, meaning the system 
requires negative emissions if  
the target is to be achieved. 
Given this, in our No Biomass 
sensitivity, Net Zero cannot be 
met. The system is left with 
residual emissions of 40 MtCO2e 
in 2050 (after accounting for 
forestry and direct air capture). 
The absence of biomass means 
substitutes must be found.  
For hydrogen production, the 
cheapest alternative would 
normally be steam methane 
reforming with CCS, but the lack 
of emissions headroom now 
means even the small residual 
emissions from this process are 
prohibitive.
This forces reliance on higher 
cost electrolysis instead, and 
since hydrogen is now higher 
cost, there is a more general shift 
in the direction of electrification 
elsewhere in the economy. 
Altogether 2050 electricity 
generation shifts from ~550TWh 
in the baseline to ~750TWh in  
a No Biomass case.
Today, dedicated biomass  
crops are negligible, with most 
UK-sourced biomass coming 
from agricultural and forestry 
residues (and the rest imported). 
Our central assumption sees a 
steady expansion of biomass  
on marginal agricultural land, 
covering 1.4Mha by 2050.
An argument can be made in 
favour of using this land to 
support further acceleration of 
tree planting, instead of biomass 
crops. There are important 
considerations here in relation  
to biodiversity, but the more 
intensive growth and 
sequestration from biomass 
crops means that foregoing  
this in favour of forestry would 
reduce the annual ‘yield’ of 
negative emissions.
In energy terms, 1.4Mha by  
2050 provides a resource of 
120TWh annually or roughly 5% 
of primary energy consumption 
today. In emissions terms, this 
delivers -34 MtCO2e of 
sequestration in 2050.
We also assume a quantity of 
biomass imports, although this  
is limited to 34TWh annually in 
2050, reflecting international 
competition for this scarce 
resource. This provides a further 
-9 MtCO2e in 2050.
Under our central assumptions, 
the UK could achieve -65 MtCO2e 
of carbon sequestration annually 
in 2050.
For an 80% target, our analysis 
showed it was possible to 
manage without expansion of 
biomass, though this had a 
significant impact on costs, 
pushing up the national 
abatement cost by ~50%.
We anticipate continued 
emissions from aviation, 
livestock, and parts of 
industry, meaning the 
system requires negative 
emissions if the target  
is to be achieved.

Innovation needs for CCS:
• Globally, there are now more 
than 50 large scale CCS 
facilities (19 in operation).  
For the UK, the priority  
should be to catch up in  
terms of demonstration  
and deployment.
• Direct Government support  
is likely needed for the 
infrastructure to transport and 
store the captured CO2, giving 
confidence to the private 
sector to back individual 
projects, including for 
industrial facilities, hydrogen 
production and power.
• By 2050 very high capture 
rates may prove critical  
given the lack of emissions 
headroom. For steam methane 
reforming, operating on  
a constant basis, 99% may  
be achievable. For power 
plants, this is likely to prove 
challenging when ramping up 
and down for load following.
• Nevertheless, CCS can play a 
transitional role in the power 
sector over the next 30 years, 
by offering immediate 
opportunities for anchor 
projects as infrastructure  
is rolled out. Achieving the 
highest feasible capture  
rates here would help extend 
the life of these plants.
For Net Zero, a paradox 
emerges, where CCS in the Power 
sector begins to retreat by 2050 
(due to residual emissions),  
yet CCS overall becomes more 
essential than ever, given its  
role in industry, hydrogen,  
BECCS and direct air capture. 
In our No CCS sensitivity, all 
these applications are unavailable 
and the Net Zero target is 
missed, with net annual 
emissions of 70MtCO2e in 2050.
In this No CCS system, industrial 
CO2 goes uncaptured, and other 
sectors must further minimise 
CO2. Heating, transport and 
industry are all heavily electrified 
(and district heat networks 
extended) to minimise the need 
for hydrogen. Since unabated 
steam methane reforming is  
not an option and even biomass 
gasification (without CCS) has  
a small net positive carbon 
footprint, any hydrogen that is 
required must be produced via 
electrolysis.
The high demand for electrolysis 
puts additional strain on the 
power sector, which must 
generate ~820 TWh in 2050  
(vs ~300TWh today).
Carbon Capture and 
Storage (CCS)
CCS encompasses a family of 
technologies with applications  
in the production of various 
energy carriers (electricity, 
hydrogen, bio-methane and 
liquid bio-fuels), and in industrial 
processes like steel and cement 
manufacturing. In combination 
with biomass, CCS can help to 
generate negative emissions, 
alleviating the need to eliminate 
activities that are hard to treat, 
like aviation.
In an 80% context, because of 
its application across so many 
parts of the energy system, CCS 
had the highest opportunity  
cost of all technologies tested. 
Removing CCS doubles the 
overall abatement cost, but  
the target can be met.

Figure 12: Final energy consumption for 80% and Net Zero targets
Heat networks provided around 
5% of final energy. Hydrogen 
emerged as a new energy vector 
in hard-to-electrify applications, 
providing around 10% of final 
energy. Biomass and coal made 
up the remaining 5%.
To meet Net Zero, a more 
profound transition is required. 
Negative emissions can help 
counter residual emissions  
from activities like aviation, but 
wherever possible delivery of 
final energy by fossil fuels is 
substituted out. As a result, the 
share of fossil fuel in the final 
energy mix falls to 25%. See 
Figure 12.
In Clockwork, a new trio of zero 
carbon energy vectors now make 
up three quarters of the mix – 
electricity at 43%, hydrogen at 
20% and district heat at 10%.
Since most of the remaining  
fossil fuel goes into industry  
and aviation, the mix of energy 
vectors delivered to households 
is profoundly different from the 
previous 80% pathway.
Three key energy 
vectors
Energy in the UK currently 
reaches the end user via three 
principal vectors: petroleum, gas 
and electricity. In 2015, this was 
split roughly 45% oil/petroleum, 
30% gas, 19% electricity (plus  
4% biomass, 2% coal, 1%  
network heat).
Overall, about 75% of final 
energy delivered to the end user 
is fossil fuel. Since electricity is 
zero carbon at the point of use, 
an obvious decarbonisation 
strategy is to increase electricity’s 
share of final energy use, while 
displacing fossil fuels in electricity 
generation.
Other zero carbon energy vectors 
(at point of use) include hydrogen 
and district heat. At present, 
production of hydrogen for 
energy purposes is virtually 
non-existent, while nationally  
the share of energy delivered  
by district heat networks is 
negligible. In a future low carbon 
energy system, both of these  
will likely have a very significant 
role where they provide a more 
practical or cost-effective 
alternative to electricity (as, in  
the case of heat networks, they 
already do in some European 
markets). This assumes they can 
be produced in a low carbon way.
To meet an 80% target, fossil 
fuels still made up 50% of final 
energy demand (30% petroleum, 
20% gas, with electricity making 
up 30%). While this may seem 
counterintuitive, the retirement 
of coal power plants (and 
deintensification of industry since 
the 1990 baseline) means that 
much of the 80% reduction is 
achieved ‘upstream’, limiting the 
impact on final energy use.

Electricity
For an 80% target, analysis 
typically generated a wide range 
of potential electricity sector 
outcomes (see page 30), with 
considerable variation in the 
mixture of nuclear, gas CCS  
and wind.
For Net Zero, much now 
depends on wider system 
assumptions. When speculative 
measures are limited, the 
emissions headroom is so heavily 
constrained that CCS at 95% 
capture rate is not low carbon 
enough, leaving a stable balance 
between nuclear and wind. 
Where more headroom is 
available, and innovation can 
deliver 99% capture rates for 
CCS, this can still be competitive 
against nuclear, as a form of 
dispatchable, baseload 
generation.
Partly as a result of its remarkable 
cost reductions in recent years, 
wind has secured its place as a 
more robust feature of any low 
carbon electricity system. With 
greater electrification required, 
floating offshore wind can unlock 
a large reservoir of energy 
resource in UK waters. Other 
renewables (led by solar PV  
and tidal stream) can make  
an important addition to this  
as part of a balanced mix.
Hydrogen
For an 80% target, hydrogen 
was a strategically important 
energy vector, but the overall 
quantity was typically limited  
to around 100TWh in 2050.
For Net Zero, greater hydrogen 
switching is now required across 
industry, heavy transport and 
shipping, meaning annual 
volumes in the range of 200-
300TWh. This means creating 
and building an entire new 
energy sector within 30 years 
to deliver energy volumes 
potentially approaching that  
of the power sector today.
The optimal mix of hydrogen 
generating technologies is 
uncertain. Biomass gasification 
with CCS is typically deployed 
but is unable to deliver the mass 
quantity of hydrogen needed.
With speculative innovation 
measures, steam methane 
reforming at 99% capture  
rate looks highly appealing  
for hydrogen production. Any  
such facilities would produce 
constantly throughout the year, 
with the surplus during summer 
being placed into geological 
storage for use in winter.
Without speculative innovation 
measures, methane reforming at 
a 95% capture rate is too high 
carbon to meet Net Zero. In that 
case, electrolysis is preferred,  
but at higher cost this makes 
hydrogen less appealing overall.
We also tested the possible  
role of advanced nuclear  
for hydrogen production, 
drawing on data from one of  
the engineering deep-dives in  
our wider Net Zero Insights 
programme.
Innovation needs for electricity 
generation:
• Support a basket of options, 
given ongoing uncertainty.  
For wind, this includes RD&D 
for floating turbines, but  
also continued significant 
deployment of fixed offshore 
wind farms. All our scenarios 
see expansion of onshore wind 
farms in the near term, given 
their proven cost effectiveness.
• For nuclear, our previous 
analysis has shown how a 
carefully designed programme 
that engages all of the key 
stakeholders with a shared 
focus on the key characteristics 
of low cost and high quality 
construction can start the UK 
down the path to affordable 
nuclear power6.
• For Power CCS, the key will be 
understanding feasible capture 
rate potential under different 
operating conditions. Very 
high capture rates may be 
possible under a stable 
operating environment but 
ramping from a cold start is 
likely to introduce a capture 
rate ‘penalty’, meaning lower 
average capture rates if the 
plant is operating flexibly.
• As part of our ongoing Net 
Zero Insights programme,  
we will publish analysis on the 
role of storage and flexibility 
solutions in due course.
In our analysis, we see cases  
at either end of the spectrum 
where nuclear or gas CCS has 
fully displaced the other as part  
of a feasible system solution.  
This is confirmed from specific 
sensitivity runs we have 
performed with no nuclear  
and (separately) no gas CCS.
Crucially, when we rule out all 
power CCS, the overall energy 
system falls short of Net Zero by 
5MtCO2. This is because energy 
from waste (EfW) with CCS is 
always a small but important part 
of the mix in 2050. Since waste 
contains some biogenic content, 
it counts as a form of BECCS, 
generating negative emissions. 
When we rule out all CCS from 
power these negative emissions 
are foregone, hence the shortfall.
We took the No Power CCS case 
and stretched it further by ruling 
out nuclear as well, implying a 
system with no low carbon 
baseload. Residual emissions  
are higher again, but not by 
much, at 6MtCO2. The more 
profound impact is on overall 
system design: without the 
preferred 35GW of baseload 
nuclear, a combination of other 
technologies come in, with wind 
and solar capacity each climbing 
to ~100GW, and peak capacity 
from hydrogen turbines (and 
distributed fuel cells) rising to 
58GW.

Because of greater intermittent 
renewable penetration, Net  
Zero pathways have a greater 
requirement for system 
balancing. 
This can be achieved through 
supply side flexibility, demand 
side flexibility and energy  
storage in various forms.
Although ESME provides a 
robust method to evaluate  
daily and long term balancing, 
ESC’s new Storage and 
Flexibility Model (SFM) has 
been developed to provide 
more granular analysis.
Using SFM, we see similar 
macro-level trends as identified 
here, with similar storage 
technologies selected. However, 
we see further value attributed 
to technologies that can 
provide services previously met 
by fossil fuels (e.g. inter-day/
week storage) and frequency 
services previously supported 
by large quantities of spinning 
thermal plant.
As part of our ongoing Net  
Zero Insights programme,  
we will publish more detail 
on the role of storage and 
flexibility solutions.

Innovation needs for  
network heat:
• Robust, consistent and detailed 
local area energy planning 
will be essential to understand 
the optimal phasing of heat 
network deployment in any 
given region, building out  
from urban centres to more 
suburban areas over time. 
Options for heat supply, 
storage and peak reserve can 
be evaluated for each phase  
of network deployment.
• UK deployment of tried and 
tested solutions elsewhere  
in the world, including 
geothermal, heat pumps,  
heat storage will deliver cost 
reductions through learning-
by-doing.
• Nuclear small modular reactors 
require support through the 
design and demonstration 
stages. It is crucial that their 
full potential for combined 
heat and power is recognised 
and demonstrated.
Large-scale heat pumps typically 
make up a large proportion of 
energy for heat networks. This 
relies on wider aspects of power 
system design, like ensuring 
sufficient capacity to meet peak 
heat demand, especially in the 
case of high renewables 
penetration.
The accompaniment of large-
scale heat storage would  
alleviate some of this pressure  
by smoothing out the demand 
for electricity and providing a 
reliable source for provision  
of heat during daily peaks. In 
addition to heat storage, further 
reserve capacity is likely to be 
needed to cope with extreme 
cold weather events. For this,  
the simplest low carbon solution 
would be large-scale boilers 
fuelled by hydrogen.
Small modular nuclear reactors 
(e.g. 300 megawatts) offer the 
potential for combined heat  
and power as part of a more 
distributed energy system, but 
will require these small reactors 
to be sited closer to population 
centres (e.g. within 20km). 
Crucially, this will depend on 
political and social acceptance. 
Areas with a history of nuclear 
energy facilities and the 
associated job opportunities  
this can bring are likely to be  
the first to support early trials. In 
the meantime, local area energy 
planning will require careful 
phasing to maintain the option of 
plugging in nuclear SMRs subject 
to successful demonstration.
For Net Zero, energising district 
heat networks by operating 
gas-fired combined heat and 
power (CHP) facilities becomes 
prohibitive. Biomass CHP facilities 
could offer a near carbon-neutral 
source, but we saw earlier how 
biomass is preferentially directed 
towards facilities incorporating 
CCS. This is better suited to a 
small number of large-scale 
facilities (to minimise CO2 pipeline 
infrastructure), and therefore 
likely to be incompatible with 
more distributed CHP facilities  
for district heat networks. 
Geothermal energy (for heat and 
power) is heavily constrained 
geographically, but in those 
regions with suitable geology, 
such as Cornwall, this could 
provide an important 
supplementary source of energy 
for district heat networks.
Where speculative measures 
enable a continued role for large 
thermal CCS plant in the power 
sector, heat offtake from these 
can provide a valuable source for 
heat networks in the medium 
term, although this may become 
less reliable over time due to 
declining load factors by 2050.
District Heat
The roll-out of district heat 
networks was an important 
feature of our whole systems 
analysis for an 80% target. 
Depending on the cost 
effectiveness of other solutions, 
the share of all UK buildings’  
heat coming from district heat 
networks in 2050 would typically 
range from 10-25%.
A Net Zero target likely means 
more – and more extensive – 
district heat networks across UK 
cities as gas networks are retired. 
In our Further Ambition case 
(FA96), the overall share of 
buildings space heat coming 
from district heat networks 
ranges from 25–40%.
Where more speculative 
measures are introduced the 
ability to generate low-cost clean 
hydrogen means the regional  
gas networks can continue to be 
used, and the roll-out of district 
heat networks is more limited, 
ranging from 10-22% of all  
space heat.
The Japanese Atomic Energy 
Agency (JAEA) has demonstrated 
hydrogen production from  
a sulphur-iodine cycle using  
the heat supply from high-
temperature gas-cooled  
reactors (HTGR).
Across a range of cost 
assumptions, deployment of 
these HTGRs looked favourable in 
ESME, with annual production of 
50-100TWh of hydrogen in 2050.
Innovation needs for hydrogen 
production:
• Very high carbon capture rates 
may be critical to ensuring  
a role for steam methane 
reforming (SMR+CCS).
• Electrolysis appears a more 
expensive option, but 
innovation (including learning 
by doing) can bring down cost 
and improve performance. 
Demonstrating electrolysis at 
scale in the 2020s should be a 
priority given implementation 
risks with SMR+CCS (which, if 
proven successfully, may then 
compete to deliver lower cost 
hydrogen to the consumer).
• Advanced nuclear technology 
for production of hydrogen 
could be an important new 
option, particularly where 
these facilities can operate 
flexibly between generation  
of electricity, hydrogen and 
heat, supporting multiple  
end use applications.
In addition to heat 
storage, further reserve 
capacity is likely to  
be needed to cope  
with extreme cold 
weather events.

Energy end use
Buildings and heat
Space heating accounts for  
the majority of energy use and 
emissions within buildings, and 
also presents the greatest system 
design challenge, given the need 
for significant capacity for 
extreme cold weather events.
At present, the gas network 
ensures instantaneous heat 
provision to the majority of 
homes through gas boilers. In a 
decarbonised energy system, a 
combination of measures will be 
required to replace this in a way 
that provides consumers with the 
same (or a better) experience.
Our 80% pathways typically 
included: large-scale retrofits  
to improve thermal efficiency, 
district heat networks in cities 
and towns, and electric heat 
pumps deployed across the 
remainder of homes. For many of 
these heat pump installations, a 
connection to a gas network was 
retained to support peak heating, 
meaning the heat pumps could 
be smaller and cheaper.
For Net Zero, the mix of 
solutions looks broadly similar: 
retrofits, district heat networks, 
electric heat pumps retaining a 
connection to gas networks to 
support back up boilers. One 
major difference is, where gas 
networks and boilers continue  
to have a role in supporting  
peak heat, these must be  
almost exclusively converted  
to hydrogen by 2050.
Innovation needs for buildings 
and heat:
• Increasing RD&D of whole 
house retrofit packages  
across a wider set of housing 
archetypes will help reduce 
cost, improve performance  
and clarify what can affordably 
be achieved across a diverse 
building stock in different 
parts of the country.
• Early demonstration of 100% 
hydrogen networks and boilers 
is essential to prove the safety 
and maintain this as an option.
• Demonstration of integrated 
solutions comprising hybrid 
heat pump and boiler systems.
• RD&D of heat storage 
technologies with potential  
to substitute for gas boilers  
as back up for heat pumps.
• Roll out of smart multi-zone 
controls to support more 
efficient energy use while 
maintaining or improving 
existing levels of comfort.
• Innovation in business models 
to deliver low carbon heating 
solutions that consumers 
desire is as important as 
technological innovation.
• Local area energy planning  
to understand the optimal 
combination of different 
solutions, based on local 
resources (and constraints).
This is further complicated by  
the need to transition all such 
networks from natural gas to 
hydrogen for Net Zero. Given 
these challenges, some 
decommissioning of parts of gas 
distribution networks should be 
anticipated. The potentially stark 
differences between regions 
underlines the case for Local  
Area Energy Planning to identify 
pathways based on local 
conditions, and that enjoy  
local consent.
In our Monte Carlo analysis,  
there is a marked difference  
in the share of heating from 
different sources. Moving from 
80% to tighter targets without 
speculative measures means 
natural gas use must be 
eliminated. But the potentially 
high cost of hydrogen production 
can make a simple hydrogen 
conversion strategy expensive. 
Instead heat networks are more 
extensively deployed, accounting 
for 25-40% of all space heat.
With all speculative measures 
activated, hydrogen has a larger 
share of overall space heat 
production, and heat networks 
now account for only 10-22% of 
heat network provision, a similar 
share to the 80% pathways. 
These measures include 
behavioural change whereby 
average indoor temperatures 
level out (as described in 
Patchwork), meaning lower 
annual energy consumption  
in 2050.
Another key difference is the 
time available to make the 
transition. Previously, we still saw 
a small, but measurable, amount 
of gas consumption in 2050 for 
heating. The new carbon target 
prohibits this and forces all 
emissions out of the sector. This 
suggests a transition period five 
years shorter than before, with 
the entire UK building stock 
moving to low carbon heating  
by the late 2040s.
For whole house retrofits,  
which can be expensive, there  
is a careful cost/benefit 
consideration. Some dwellings 
constitute ‘low hanging fruit’,  
and it makes good sense to treat 
these urgently. As we progress 
through the building stock 
though, costs increase and more 
modest efficiency gains becomes 
sub-optimal. Of the 25m existing 
dwellings that will still be in use 
in 2050, typically around 10m of 
these undergo a ‘whole house’ 
retrofit in our modelling.
For some buildings, improved 
thermal performance will enable 
them to rely solely on heat 
pumps, along with heat storage. 
For others, the rate of heat loss  
in extreme cold periods means 
they will still require a boiler to 
supplement the heat pump, at 
least on current understanding.
Although boilers would still  
have a role in many homes, there 
is a significant reduction in gas 
network capacity requirement  
by 2050. The implications of this 
for gas distribution networks in 
particular areas will depend on a 
variety of factors, but for many  
of these, declining connections 
and lower energy throughput will 
challenge the economic case for 
continued operation.

Transport
ESME covers all road and rail 
transport as well as shipping and 
aviation. For aviation, there are  
no likely alternatives to kerosene-
fuelled aeroplanes by 2050, so any 
measures to mitigate emissions 
are focused on overall demand 
(see Sustainable Lifestyles on 
page 44). For all other modes, 
demand can similarly be adjusted, 
but a range of low carbon 
technology options exist.
Compared to Buildings (page 40), 
the transport solution space has 
seen a significant transformation 
in moving from 80% to Net Zero.
In an 80% context, with a 
sizeable carbon budget still 
available in 2050, road transport 
could continue to rely on 
extensive use of fossil fuels  
(in the absence of policy 
intervention). Cars and vans 
would transition first to hybrid 
and plug-in hybrid electric 
vehicles. For heavy duty vehicles 
and ships, we would typically see 
a transition to dual-fuel solutions, 
with natural gas helping to 
displace liquid fuels.
For Net Zero, cars and vans 
undergo a comprehensive shift 
to electric vehicles by 2050, with 
a minor share for hydrogen fuel 
cell vehicles in some simulations. 
Given the replacement rate for 
new vehicles to penetrate the 
overall car fleet, this implies new 
vehicle sales must be all electric 
(or hydrogen) from the mid-
2030s onwards.
Industry
In ESME, Industry covers sectors 
such as Metals, Chemicals,  
Food and drink, Refining and 
Agriculture. ESME includes a 
range of fuel switching options 
for different sectors and 
processes, depending on the 
particular activity undertaken. 
Options include electrification or 
switching (from coal/oil) to gas, 
to hydrogen or to biomass. In 
addition, CCS can be applied to 
processes still using fossil fuels.
In an 80% context, ESME 
allowed for emissions reduction 
down to 49MtCO2 in 2050. 
Essentially, industry was seen as 
one of the ‘hard-to-treat’ sectors 
where emissions reduction was 
more modest compared to e.g. 
power, heat and transport.
For Net Zero, we have updated 
our representation of Industry. 
This now results in further fuel 
switching to electricity and 
hydrogen for space heating  
in industrial buildings, and 
hydrogen boilers for drying  
and separation and other 
subprocesses. The maximum 
effort now leaves just 15MtCO2  
of residual Industry emissions  
in 2050 (any less would rely  
on deindustrialisation).
Innovation needs for transport:
• Roll out of public charging 
infrastructure needs to  
be accelerated to avoid 
constraining mass adoption. 
Smart charging (and vehicle-
to-grid) can assist with the 
smooth integration of EVs,  
but will not entirely mitigate 
the need for network 
reinforcement, which should 
be carefully coordinated with 
local area energy planning 
more generally (also 
considering electrification  
of heat).
• Long term planning and 
coordination will be required 
to support the deployment  
of infrastructure for low  
carbon heavy duty vehicles. 
The potential for a short-lived 
transition through natural gas 
duel-fuel vehicles requires 
consideration, as do the 
consequences of foregoing  
this step.
• For shipping, while the  
rollout of hydrogen-fuelled 
ships looks attractive in our 
modelling from a carbon 
abatement perspective, inertia 
is a significant feature of this 
sector. Coordination will be 
essential to ensure deployment 
of hydrogen fuelling at UK 
ports, including access to 
affordable hydrogen from 
proximate production facilities, 
low cost transportation, or 
potential on-site production 
via electrolysis.
This has provided greater 
confidence that the transition  
to EVs can be managed without 
significant system impacts.
In heavy duty vehicles too,  
Net Zero pathways involve a 
significant shift to electrification 
by 2050, although duel-fuel 
vehicles are again seen as a 
transition technology along the 
pathway. Since we introduced 
hydrogen ships in the recent 
update, shipping transitions 
across to this technology almost 
completely by 2050.

Recent policy announcements

of such a policy in the modelling 
would effectively ‘lock-in’ an 
all-electric/hydrogen outcome 
for this sector.
The key challenge from such a 
rapid increase in electric vehicles 
is its impact on the power system 
and the willingness of consumers 
to use smart charging. Previous 
ESC work, including consumer 
trials, have tested the interaction 
between consumer expectations, 
EV charging infrastructure and 
strategies for smart charging7.  
We also chaired the EV Energy 
Taskforce8, which highlighted that 
effectively-managed integration 
of EVs can improve electricity 
network efficiency and system 
resilience, while limiting the need 
for new infrastructure to meet 
growing electricity demand.

In our central assumptions, 
aviation demand in 2050  
climbs to 60% above 2005 levels, 
though progress in technology 
and logistics means overall 
emissions are relatively 
unchanged at ~30MtCO2. 
Aviation therefore relies on 
breakthrough innovation 
elsewhere to ensure sufficient 
quantities of negative emissions 
to offset this.
More sustainable alternatives  
to holiday (and business) travel 
would reduce the reliance on 
offsets. For example, if 2050 
aviation demand reached only 
20% above 2005 levels (as per 
our speculative measure), this 
would equate to an annual saving 
of 4MtCO2. In their own analysis, 
the CCC consider a 20% growth 
limit. Since recent figures suggest 
demand has already exceeded 
20%, this would imply an 
absolute reduction in aviation 
demand from now to 2050, in the 
context of a growing, increasingly 
affluent, population.
We have not investigated the 
potential impact of flygskam or 
flight-shaming on future aviation 
demand, and in other parts of 
the discourse commentators 
have gone much further than our 
speculative adjustment. In our 
maximum scenario described on 
page 45, we even consider the 
impact of eliminating aviation 
altogether by 2050.
Meanwhile, our central 
assumptions have 2050 meat 
and dairy consumption 
declining by 20% versus today, 
reducing emissions by 8 MtCO2e/
year. Achieving a UK wide 
reduction of 50% by 2050 would 
deliver emissions savings of 19 
MtCO2e/year.
Sustainable lifestyles
In our previous analysis for an 
80% target, we explored the 
potential impact of different 
demand trajectories, but the 
slack in the 80% target meant  
it was possible to support a 
‘lifestyle as usual’ approach if  
this is what people preferred.
Many household activities could 
continue to rely on fossil fuels, 
albeit to a lesser extent than 
today. The remaining carbon 
budget allowed for a proportion 
of the car fleet to remain as ICEs, 
and any transition was often 
modest, involving more hybrid 
and plug-in hybrid vehicles than 
pure battery EVs. Heating our 
homes involved a transition to 
lower carbon alternatives, but 
again these were often hybrid 
solutions, where heat pumps 
were coupled with natural gas 
boilers.
Elsewhere, we assumed no 
dietary change and assumed ever 
increasing aviation demand in 
line with Government projections.
For Net Zero, the role of 
individuals and their lifestyle 
choices comes to the fore.  
For heating and transport, 
consumers’ willingness to adopt 
unfamiliar technologies, like EVs 
or heat pumps, becomes more 
important. Moreover, there is 
more need to explore some limits 
on hard-to-treat activities,  
such as aviation demand and 
dietary change.
Understanding how the sorts of 
fuel-switching options adopted 
across different industry sectors 
can integrate with wider energy 
system planning in local areas is 
an important challenge for the 
energy system. This includes the 
reuse of recoverable heat from 
industry processes for local heat 
networks, and co-location of 
hydrogen production facilities 
with industrial clusters, where 
CCS infrastructure can be 
concentrated most cost-
effectively.
Innovation needs for Industry:
• Integration of decarbonisation 
roadmaps for industrial 
clusters with local area energy 
planning more generally.
• Demonstration of the safety  
of hydrogen switching for 
industrial processes.
• Deployment of CCS for those 
industrial sectors/processes 
where fuel switching is 
impractical.
Other parts of the energy system 
are decarbonised on a highly 
accelerated timescale. Emissions 
from buildings are eliminated by 
2040. Given the pace of change 
today, this would require an 
incredible step change in 
deployment of building retrofits, 
low carbon technologies and 
networks. Emissions from all  
road transport are similarly 
ended by 2040. Sales of petrol/
diesel vehicles would effectively 
have to stop by 2025 at the latest, 
including for heavy goods 
vehicles, requiring immediate 
deployment of the infrastructure 
for recharging and refuelling 
these (and for generation of  
the zero-carbon electricity  
and hydrogen to support this).
In short, this MAX pathway 
involves a rate of change for 
power, heat and road transport 
that pushes against the bounds 
of plausibility. Achieving Net Zero 
any earlier than 2045 cannot rely 
on further acceleration of these. 
Instead, it would have to be 
through more rapid (non-linear) 
reductions in aviation and 
livestock emissions (or more 
rapid scale up of sequestration 
measures).
How fast could we 
decarbonise?
With our current assumptions  
for aviation, livestock and 
industry, these sectors will always 
generate residual emissions in 
our pathways. Meanwhile, 
deployment constraints on 
negative emissions technologies 
like BECCS and DACCS mean 
these take time to make an 
impact at scale.
Achieving Net Zero significantly 
earlier than 2050 in our 
modelling requires extra effort 
beyond even our speculative 
measures. Looking across 
analysis and commentary by 
other groups, there do not 
appear to be any significant 
additional low carbon 
technological solutions. Instead, 
most of the additional ambition 
is achieved through deep 
demand reduction.
To test the impact of this, we 
constructed a MAX case where 
aviation demand and livestock 
emissions fall to zero by 2050. 
This lowers the residual emissions 
trajectory sufficiently that 
negative emissions are able to 
balance these earlier, achieving 
Net Zero in 2045.
Interactions between diet and 
the energy system are significant. 
A transition away from current 
levels of livestock would free  
up UK land for other uses, 
including afforestation and 
biomass crops, both enabling 
carbon sequestration and the 
latter providing a versatile 
resource for the energy system.
While there is considerable 
opportunity for changing 
patterns of demand in aviation 
and diet to contribute to Net 
Zero, we have not assessed the 
potential negative consequences 
if demand were significantly 
increased. Our survey on Net 
Zero awareness and engagement 
among the general public gives 
us reason to guard against 
‘baking in’ excessive optimism 
into our modelling.
Innovation needs to support 
sustainable lifestyles:
• Provision of information 
including real-time data  
to support sustainable 
consumption and activity 
planning, including the 
potential for public campaigns. 
Understanding what messages 
works in such campaigns is a 
potentially important area for 
research and innovation.
• Continued RD&D into meat-
free and dairy-free alternatives.
Understanding how the 
sorts of fuel-switching 
options adopted across 
different industry sectors 
can integrate with wider 
energy system planning  
in local areas is an 
important challenge for 
the energy system.

Still, our investment for a low 
carbon future should be as 
economically efficient as possible, 
to avoid crowding out spending 
in other important areas. Good 
management of scarce financial 
resources can also open the 
possibility of over-delivery and 
an earlier Net Zero economy.
Investment in most of the 
technologies to deliver Net Zero is 
likely to be privately financed. We 
therefore take account of private 
firms financing costs in ESME  
by applying an assumed cost  
of capital of 8% to capital 
expenditures on all technologies. 
The model then discounts 
annualised costs (and benefits)  
to a net present value using the 
social discount rate of 3.5%. Both 
these steps are in line with Green 
Book guidance and common to 
many models.
The cost of private finance for 
any specific technology is likely 
to vary over time and in line with 
capital market perceptions of 
risk, including a strong element 
of policy-related risk and the level 
of experience in deployment. By 
applying a common assumed 
cost of private capital across all 
technologies, the modelling 
approach optimises the mix of 
technologies on the basis of 
underlying costs and performance 
characteristics, rather than current 
market and policy arrangements. 
This prevents the modelled 
choices from reflecting current 
policy choices and market 
perceptions of risk for different 
technologies. Experience in 
deploying technologies is taken 
into account in technology cost 
assumptions (for example, cost 
assumptions for offshore wind 
have been updated to take 
account of cost reductions 
following deployment).
Costing Net Zero
When we look at cost-optimal 
pathways that meet our energy 
needs subject to a carbon target, 
an obvious question arises: what 
is the carbon target costing us? 
That is, what would the energy 
system cost in a counterfactual 
case where we meet the same 
needs but without worrying 
about carbon?
In energy system modelling, we 
can assess the cost of a pathway 
with and without a carbon target, 
and the difference between these 
is known as the abatement cost. 
We and others had previously 
estimated this to be somewhere 
in the range of 1-2% of GDP by 
2050 for an 80% target.
But the issue of cost is a highly 
sensitive one. Crucially, we do not 
include any representation of the 
additional cost to the UK from 
failing to tackle climate change  
in the counterfactual. This is 
further complicated by the fact 
that UK action is not necessarily 
correlated with global action, so 
in principle we could face these 
damages even if we are reducing 
our own emissions.
Nevertheless, global estimates  
of damages from failure to 
reduce emissions are many  
times greater than the cost of 
mitigation. Additionally, as the 
Net Zero discourse has shown, 
there are various co-benefits 
of decarbonisation that are 
absent from energy system cost 
calculations, such as improved 
health and biodiversity. A 
complete assessment of the  
cost of Net Zero ought to  
include all of these.
Timelines
The pace and scale of change 
required to meet Net Zero is 
profound. It requires the urgent 
introduction of robust policies 
which will unlock both significant 
innovation and large-scale  
capital investment. An important 
consideration is the deployment 
profile for the necessary 
technologies.
Figure 16 shows a steady,  
linear deployment to get from 
where we are today to where  
we need to be in 2050. Taking  
the example of domestic low 
carbon heating systems, we have 
30 years to install low carbon 
systems in the UK’s 28.5 million 
homes. A linear deployment 
would entail around one million 
installations per year.
In the FA96 case, where the 
target is strengthened but  
no speculative measures are 
available to assist, a significant 
increase in investment is 
required. This is true across  
all sectors, but especially 
pronounced in the case of 
transport with a rapid shift to 
(more capital intensive) electric 
vehicles, including heavy duty.
The addition of speculative 
measures (including overall lower 
demand) more than compensates 
for the tighter target, reigning in 
total investment need.
Investment 
opportunities
The transition to a Net Zero 
energy system will create 
economic opportunities for 
innovators across all sectors  
of the economy. The charts 
above show the range of capital 
investment in each of the key 
sectors: Power and conversion, 
Transport, Buildings and 
Infrastructure.
For an 80% pathway, despite  
the carbon budgets tightening 
over time, cost reductions in low 
carbon technologies ensure the 
capital investment requirement  
is held fairly constant over time.
Low carbon systems are  
currently characterised by a shift 
towards more capital-intensive 
technologies (e.g. wind power 
and electric vehicles vs gas CCGTs 
and internal combustion engines), 
and the choice of private cost of 
capital does not materially affect 
this. However, a higher cost of 
capital will tend to inflate the 
apparent cost imposed on 
consumers of achieving Net Zero.
In the recent advice to 
Government, CCC found that – 
due to demonstrated cost 
reductions in a range of low 
carbon technologies – their 
estimates of abatement cost for 
Net Zero fall within the same cost 
range previously associated with 
80%, that is 1-2% of GDP in 2050.
With an 8% private cost of capital 
in ESME, Net Zero abatement 
costs look higher, in the range 
2-3% of GDP. However, test runs 
with a lower cost of capital – 
which has been evident in  
many low carbon investments, 
including mature renewables – 
show the ESME runs in the 1-2% 
range. This underlines the 
importance of stable and credible 
policies that successfully reduce 
the cost of capital demanded by 
private sector investors for a 
broad range of clean, capital 
intensive technologies (as we 
have successfully seen with 
renewables).

Local Area Energy Plans (LAEPs) 
need to be connected at regional 
and national levels in an iterative 
assessment and feedback 
process. Cumulatively, such plans 
can help inform the development 
of nationally strategic resources 
(such as CCS or hydrogen 
production facilities). This 
requires the use of a consistent 
and robust methodology across 
different locales.
For local and regional plans  
to have impact, there must be 
enabling mechanisms within 
central planning and wider policy 
frameworks to give them power, 
including potentially the network 
price control process.
Place and Local Area 
Energy Planning
The modelling discussed in this 
report primarily focusses on the 
national context, though we have 
also emphasised the importance 
of place-based aspects of the 
energy system transition, for 
example through creation of 
industrial clusters to better focus 
development efforts around CCS, 
H2 production or process heat. 
We are also seeing significant 
appetite for smart local energy 
system projects, including 
through the Prospering from the 
Energy Revolution programme.
However, in 2019 fewer than 
12,000 renewable heating 
systems were accredited under 
the Government’s Domestic 
Renewable Heat Incentive (RHI)9. 
Currently, the workforce, supply 
chains, business models and 
policies are simply not in place  
to deliver at such a high rate.
The assumptions within ESME 
reflect a profile closer to that 
shown in Figure 17. There is  
a delay before the deployment 
can begin, and when it does,  
it starts slowly (reflecting the  
fact these are sometimes 
unfamiliar technologies) before 
the rate increases (potentially 
exponentially) up to a maximum 
deployment level.
The delay at the start of  
this profile is a critical phase.  
This is where technology,  
policy, regulation and finance 
mechanisms need to be 
developed, demonstrations 
undertaken, and supply chains 
and workforce skills built up.  
This all needs to be done before 
roll-out at any meaningful scale 
can begin. But experience in 
some parts of the energy system, 
such as renewables, shows that 
with the right combination of 
market incentives, rapid scale  
up and cost reduction can  
be achieved.

Robust local area energy 
planning can help understand 
the pathways for low carbon 
heating, transport and electricity 
systems, identifying priority 
projects and infrastructure 
investments. This will help deliver 
both a cost-effective transition 
and secure democratic consensus 
for the necessary changes. Such 
plans and strategies would be 
developed in light of local 
priorities, demands, current 
infrastructure and resource 
availability, as well as the regional 
and national systems they are 
linked to. They should be 
developed in collaboration with  
a broad range of stakeholders 
(local authorities, energy 
networks, industry bodies, 
community groups, etc).
For local and regional 
plans to have impact, 
there must be enabling 
mechanisms within central 
planning and wider policy 
frameworks to give them 
power, including 
potentially the network 
price control process.

The pace and scale  
of change required  
to achieve Net Zero 
effectively and 
efficiently by 2050 
suggests that the 
policy ecosystem  
will need three key 
attributes:
• Policy will need to deliver 
credible long-term signals  
to incentivise innovation and 
private sector investment to 
develop and deploy a range of 
existing and new technologies.
• Policy needs to shape markets 
so that private sector capital 
flows to deliver an efficient mix 
and phasing of emissions 
reduction across the economy.
• As well as shaping markets, 
policy will need to underpin 
investment in strategically 
important enabling 
infrastructures and 
technologies.
Our Rethinking Decarbonisation 
Incentives10 project looked at the 
balance of carbon-related policy 
signals across different sectors 
(see Figure 18) and highlighted 
the potential to substantially 
strengthen and improve the 
coherence of carbon policy 
across the economy. This implies 
a framework that is broadly 
technology-neutral, but does not 
necessarily rely on an economy-
wide carbon pricing instrument, 
such as a carbon tax or an 
emissions trading system.
Decarbonisation policies, 
including both incentives and 
obligations or standards, can be 
designed with specific sectoral 
features in mind. However, by 
building links between sectoral 
policies, especially by developing 
tradable instruments such as 
carbon credits, the UK can unlock 
greater pathway flexibility and 
increase the scope for markets  
to reveal least-cost combinations.  
In addition, policy must  
also recognise the role that 
negative emission technologies, 
bioenergy, and wider land  
use policy will have, alongside 
potential changes in consumer 
behaviour.
This chapter provides key  
policy recommendations for 
Government to introduce in  
the near-term to support the 
development of an economy-
wide carbon policy framework  
for Net Zero.
By building links between 
sectoral policies, especially 
by developing tradable 
instruments such as 
carbon credits, the UK  
can unlock greater 
pathway flexibility.

Electricity
Policy has already driven 
significant decarbonisation of  
the electricity sector, but there 
is still an important role for  
policy reform to:
• Enable the assembly of an 
efficient and complete zero 
carbon system that matches 
the changes in low carbon 
technologies, including 
distributed technologies;
• Enable investment to produce 
sufficient quantities of zero 
carbon electricity and 
associated network 
improvements, and
• Shape the most efficient role 
for electricity in supporting 
heat, transport, and industrial 
decarbonisation.
In addition, electricity markets 
need to more effectively signal 
the spatial and temporal value of 
zero carbon electricity, to meet 
new demands and unlock the 
potential of technologies that  
can provide greater system 
flexibility (such as batteries, 
demand side response, and the 
integration of electric vehicles).11
Over the course of this 
Parliament, policy should  
focus on:
• Large-scale developments, 
such as new nuclear, which will 
require significant support 
from Government. This could 
come in the form of the 
recently proposed Regulated 
Asset Base (RAB) model12 to 
secure private investment or 
alternative models of risk 
allocation to keep the cost of 
capital as low as possible (see 
Costing Net Zero). Government 
should also bear down on the 
costs of nuclear new build 
projects, potentially taking a 
fleet approach which learns 
from previous reactor builds 
and implementing a well-
designed programme that 
incorporates multiple project 
performance and cost 
reduction opportunities13.
• R&D funding and deployment 
support for new and emerging 
technologies that are key for 
Net Zero, for example, floating 
offshore wind and small 
modular reactors (SMR).
• Stimulating efficient demand 
reduction and/or flexibility 
through supporting 
appropriate energy efficiency 
measures, building regulation, 
and product standards. For 
example, by developing more 
accurate measurement of the 
carbon performance 
associated with energy  
use choices in buildings  
and equipment.
• Improved market price signals 
to incentivise efficient use of 
the system in time and space. 
This includes reforms to ensure 
more accurate time-of-use and 
locational signals to strengthen 
incentives for supply and 
demand to match user  
needs and local system 
circumstances.14
• Strengthen network  
price controls to support 
decarbonisation by 
incentivising and taking 
account of whole systems  
local area energy planning  
that enables improved forward 
planning, and multi-vector 
network investment decisions.
In the medium-term the UK could 
strengthen the role of both:
• Emissions trading – the UK 
could extend coverage and 
increase ambition, particularly 
if it introduced its own 
emissions trading system.
• Sectoral decarbonisation 
policies – the UK could introduce 
new carbon standards for 
buildings and potentially road 
transport, and it could create 
new incentives for climate-
friendly land use choices.
The potential direction 
of travel for carbon 
policy to 2050
The immediate challenge for 
carbon policy is to improve the 
alignment of existing policies  
and to strengthen policy where 
there are clear gaps.
These steps would open the 
potential to create an economy-
wide carbon policy framework  
to deliver Net Zero efficiently. 
Carbon credits could be 
tradeable between mechanisms 
and sectors, and linked to a 
marketplace for UK based certified 
methods of greenhouse gas 
removal (e.g. sustainable 
afforestation, BECCS, DACCS, etc.).

Over the course of this 
Government our analysis points 
to the following policy priorities:
• Fund a new wave of place-based 
building energy improvement 
and retrofit projects to enable 
regions to invest strategically 
and upskill heating technicians 
and installers. Localities and 
regions could compete for 
funding under national guidance, 
but with the freedom to  
develop their own strategies  
and targeting local priorities 
such as fuel poverty.
• Roll out a robust Local Area 
Energy Planning process in 
order to build consensus, 
guide planning, shape new 
developments and co-ordinate 
collective infrastructure choices 
and investment priorities. ESC 
has developed a prototype  
for this style of local energy 
planning, a version of which 
could be rolled out 
immediately.20
• Make energy networks  
invest for Net Zero, with 
Ofgem re-engineering its  
RIIO processes and guidance, 
for example, by setting explicit 
outcome-based delivery 
incentives that reward network 
companies when they invest 
well and demonstrably enable 
cost-effective decarbonisation.
Buildings
The current policy framework  
for decarbonising buildings is 
complex, but ultimately too  
weak and fragmented to drive 
innovation or the right mix of 
measures that influence the 
carbon performance of buildings.
Government should begin to 
develop an integrated long-term 
policy framework for zero  
carbon buildings. It should be 
broadly technology neutral,  
but informed by local planning 
and prioritisation processes, 
particularly for collective choices 
around upgrading buildings  
in a particular area and energy 
network infrastructures. It will 
also have to reduce fuel poverty 
and ensure that vulnerable 
customers are neither left behind 
nor bear the brunt of the cost 
(including being aware of new 
types of vulnerability that will 
emerge with greater digitalisation 
of the energy system).
Transport
Transport accounts for a third  
of UK emissions and continues  
to rise.15 Stronger policies are 
required to drive decarbonisation 
and low carbon journey choices.
Our work suggests that key 
reforms over the course of this 
Government could include:
• A phased approach to the ban 
on the sale of new diesel and 
petrol cars and vans during the 
2030s, extending to cover all 
internal combustion engine 
(ICE) and hybrid vehicles.16
• Initial rebalancing of the way 
Government taxes mobility,  
for example, using road usage 
charging to replace fuel duty 
as a source of revenue.17
• A process to deploy a national 
and interoperable charging 
infrastructure, including rapid 
chargepoints on trunk roads, 
with integration into local area 
energy planning and network 
investment planning 
processes.18
• Support for emerging 
technologies, such as hydrogen 
fuel cells for use in HGVs.19
• Developing incentives to 
influence aviation choices, for 
example, through an obligation 
for airlines to sequester a 
proportion of their emissions.
• Introduce a new carbon credits 
scheme to reward bill payers 
who reduce their actual (i.e. 
measured) energy emissions. 
The credit scheme could be 
linked to the new system  
of Carbon Performance 
Certification and operated by 
energy suppliers using smart 
metering data. Customers  
that outperform low carbon 
performance benchmarks 
would be rewarded with 
credits (while requiring 
customers with poor carbon 
performance to purchase 
credits).
• Open up competitive markets 
for new long-term low carbon 
finance products. Financial 
efficiency and risk reduction 
can be maximised by linking 
repayments to property 
ownership (through mortgage-
style products) or to energy 
bill payers (through an adapted 
Green Deal regime).
• Phase in new carbon 
performance rating 
requirements for all buildings. 
This could be implemented  
by replacing the existing EPC 
rating system with a smarter, 
more accurate and valid new 
system of Carbon Performance 
Certification. An obligation 
could be initially introduced on 
social housing and privately-
rented properties, eventually 
extending (with long lead 
times) to all owner occupied 
and hard-to-treat properties.
• As these obligations are 
phased in, reduce reliance on 
technology subsidies like the 
Renewable Heat Incentive 
(RHI) over time.
Government should begin 
to develop an integrated 
long-term policy 
framework for zero  
carbon buildings.
Roll out a robust Local 
Area Energy Planning 
process in order to build 
consensus, guide 
planning, shape new 
developments and  
co-ordinate collective 
infrastructure choices and 
investment priorities.

Our modelling points strongly  
to the strategic importance of  
the UK expanding the ‘solution 
space’ for the whole energy 
system, including industrial 
decarbonisation, by developing 
the infrastructure and value 
chains required to support CCS, 
sustainable biomass production 
and conversion, and low carbon 
hydrogen production. All three of 
these elements appear in a wide 
range of analysis of cost-efficient 
energy transitions, which also 
suggests:
• While there are other  
potential sources of low carbon 
electricity, the power sector 
remains an attractive option as 
a low risk sector for early CCS 
development (i.e. before 2030), 
because of its relatively low 
trade exposure and existing 
support mechanisms23. This 
could act as an anchor for  
CCS deployment in industry,  
in particular for clusters. Gas 
power CCS in proximity  
to industrial clusters may  
well represent the most 
straightforward, deliverable, 
and best value approach  
to early deployment at  
scale of CCS.
• Modelling points to the high 
strategic potential of advanced 
methods of gasification, 
including biomass gasification 
with CCS to underpin hydrogen 
production while also 
delivering negative emissions 
of high economic value in the 
medium-term. The potential  
of biomass gasification with 
CCS to open a UK negative 
emissions value chain suggests 
that there is a strong case for 
strategic innovation funding  
of clean gasification with  
CCS plants.
Over the course of this 
Government our analysis 
suggests that policy development 
priorities should include:
• Developing post-Brexit 
arrangements for emissions 
trading in the UK to ensure 
that incentives on industrial 
emitters are maintained and 
strengthened progressively 
over time. The UK will have 
more opportunity to extend 
the scope and strengthen the 
stringency of emissions trading 
if it were to develop a 
standalone UK ETS.
• Over time, a UK ETS could also 
be designed to include new 
mechanisms to reward delivery 
of verified negative emissions 
with carbon credits.
• Regardless of whether the  
UK remains within the EU  
ETS or develops a linked or 
standalone UK ETS, policy 
makers should explore the 
introduction of output-based 
performance standards21 and 
other approaches (e.g. border 
carbon adjustments) to  
replace the free allocation  
of allowances in ways that 
maintain strong incentives  
to reduce emissions while 
minimising competitiveness 
impacts.
• Direct support for innovation 
and early deployment of CCS 
and hydrogen production in 
industrial clusters, including 
the development of investable 
funding mechanisms for CO2 
transport and storage 
infrastructure.22 This should  
sit alongside support for 
non-cluster based industry.
There are challenges, however. 
These include interoperability 
(consumer, commercial, data, 
device, physical and vector), data 
availability and gaps, security, 
and privacy. There are roles for 
policy makers, regulators, 
manufacturers, service providers 
and consumers in addressing 
these challenges. The Energy 
Data Taskforce24 focused on the 
challenges around data gaps. It 
advocated stepping up the rate 
of digitalisation, and intelligent 
utilisation of monitoring and 
modelling/data science to 
address the gaps in the most 
cost-effective way possible.
Government and the regulator 
should prioritise the creation  
and adoption of an open  
energy data and digitalisation 
governance framework in line 
with recommendations of the 
Energy Data Taskforce. This  
can maximise the potential of 
digitalisation to enable tailored 
consumer-focused innovation, 
business models, market designs 
and consumer protections in the 
transformation of the energy 
system ahead.
Industry (including 
CCS, Bioenergy, and 
Hydrogen Production)
Industry requires stronger policy 
incentives to invest in emissions 
reduction through improving 
industrial processes, fuel 
switching, and innovation in 
technologies such as CCS  
(and more broadly negative 
emissions).
Government should prioritise 
developing and establishing a 
long-term policy framework  
for industrial decarbonisation, 
including developing rewards  
for delivering verified negative 
emissions. This could also 
substantially improve the 
investability of CCS, domestic 
biomass supply chains, and 
hydrogen production. The 
industrial decarbonisation policy 
framework should be designed  
in ways that minimises carbon 
leakage impacts (i.e. reduces 
offshoring of industrial 
emissions) and must account  
for asset turnover rates.
Digitalisation 
Alongside decarbonisation,  
the other big trend effecting  
the future energy system is 
digitalisation. Digitalisation is  
the process of moving towards  
a system which utilises the 
collection and sharing of data 
between devices connected 
through digital communications, 
and the analysis of that data to 
improve the system’s, or an 
organisation’s processes and 
operation. It could help minimise 
costs and ensure security of 
supply, it will allow greater 
choice, better service and  
more convenience for consumers, 
and open opportunities to 
extract value, innovate around 
propositions and services, and 
welcome new entrants.
Digitalisation has already 
transformed many sectors, and is 
beginning to change the energy 
system. It will likely become a 
crucial component of any future 
energy system. As discussed in 
this analysis, the challenge of 
meeting the Net Zero target  
will require many changes to  
the electricity generation mix, 
the way heat and transport  
are provided, the interaction 
between energy vectors, and the 
overall complexity of the system 
and components connected to  
it. For the system to continue 
providing the service required 
under these new conditions, 
digitalisation is essential.
Digitalisation is the 
process of moving 
towards a system which 
utilises the collection and 
sharing of data between 
devices connected 
through digital 
communications.

21  Output-based standards can be used 
to provide pricing incentives for 
certain industries to reduce their GHG 
emissions while maintaining their 
competitive position relative to 
international peers. Instead of paying 
a charge on the fuels that they 
purchase, industrial firms face a 
carbon price on the portion of their 
emissions that are above a specific 
level, which is determined based on 
relevant output-based standards 
(emissions per unit of output). The 
output-based standard is set at a level 
that represents best-in-class 
performance (top quartile or better) in 
order to drive reduced emissions 
intensity. A firm that reduces 
emissions below its limit can generate 
and sell surplus credits. The result is 
that companies have an incentive to 
reduce emissions and support clean 
innovation while minimising the total 
cost they pay.
