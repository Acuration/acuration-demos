long-lasting or irreversible changes, such 
as the loss of some ecosystems
Hans-Otto Pörtner

Examples of impact of 2°C vs. 1.5°C 
Scientific Support
Reputable scientific and industry groups agree that significant levels of removals are required
Urgent and ambitious action is needed for deep GHG emissions cuts
CDR will be necessary to achieve net-negative CO2 emissions for mitigating climate change. Globally between 0.5-
9.5bn tonnes of CDRs via BECCS will be required
Even with rapid investment in emission reductions, the United States could need to remove about 2bn tonnes of 
CO2 per year by midcentury to reach net zero
10–20bn tonnes of CO2 removals needed every year if we are to keep warming below Paris Agreement thresholds
Sustainable Development Scenario requires BECCS and DAC to remove c.3bn tonnes of CO2 in 2070
All pathways that limit warming to 1.5°C or 2°C involve substantial levels of carbon removal (Carbon Dioxide 
Removal – CDR) between 2020 and 2100, ranging from 450 to 1,100bn tonnes of CO2

Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change
Up to 9.5bn billion tonnes of carbon removals per year 
from BECCS by 2050 required to maintain a 1.5°C pathway
Global annual CDR volumes range in 2050 (billion tonnes)
•
Reaching net zero requires reductions in CO2, methane, and 
other GHG emissions, and implies net-negative CO2 emissions
•
CDR will be necessary to achieve net-negative CO2 emissions
•
If warming exceeds 1.5°C, it could gradually be reduced by 
achieving and sustaining net negative global CO2 emissions
•
The larger the overshoot, the more net negative CO2
emissions would be needed to return to 1.5°C

Common Questions
Is BECCS an efficient capture process?
•
BECCS is one of the most efficient technologies for large scale carbon removals
•
Advanced amine technology – capture rate of around 95%
Retrofitting BECCS means the loss of thermal efficiency?
•
The energy consumed in a BECCS plant is used for the production of two products (1) renewable power and (2) carbon removals – it is not lost
Does BECCS lead to a higher level of SOx and NOx emissions?
•
Biomass is already a low sulphur
•
SOx in the flue gas is treated and removed in the quench column before the flue gas is passed through the CO2 absorber
•
NOx is controlled in the power island and reduced further as part of the carbon capture cycle
BECCS is unproven?
•
The post combustion technology we plan to use has been proven at scale and is deployed on numerous sites globally
•
>6,000 hours of testing of solvent on live flue gas at Drax Power Station over the last two years
BECCS will lead to unsustainable fibre consumption?
•
We have a responsible sourcing policy, which supplements national and regional regulations mitigating this risk

Our Biomass Story Starts With Timber
The world needs more timber for construction, manufacturing and more 
•
Timber creates sawdust and shavings
•
Harvesting forests creates thinnings, branches, unusable logs
•
Good forest management includes removal of material
•
Reduce the risk and intensity of forest fires
•
Restoration from disease
•
Drax fibre sources are embedded in the timber industry
•
c.98% from sawmill and other wood industry residues, branches and tops, 
thinnings, low-grade roundwood
•
c.2% agricultural residues
53
Forest Management
We source from forests that are well regulated to ensure positive people, 
nature and climate outcomes 
•
Working forests are well managed
•
Healthy managed forests deliver sustained ecological, economic and social outcomes
•
Working forests for timber encourages regeneration
•
Active management of forests reduces risk of disease and wild-fire
Utilisation of material with limited other uses 
Protection of 
sensitive sites 
Forest Fire protection 
and Restoration from 
disease 
Improved 
Biodiversity 
Increased forest 
productivity
Local employment
Improved access for 
recreation

Historically, commercial uses for residues were limited… particularly in British Columbia…                                   
…..where burning of residues was undertaken
Biomass provides a better alternative and supports long-term investment in good forest management

Modelling of Potential Sources of Biomass at a Global Level 
Geospatial models with sustainability filters…
Modelled current and potential future biomass production
11 geospatial datasets, 7 scientific references and high-resolution data
Criteria
No high conservation value land: intact forest 
landscape; high biodiversity intactness index; key 
biodiversity area; peatland; wetland; areas with high soil 
loss
Leaving enough residue for nature: protect nutrient 
cycles, floor biodiversity in forests
Good practice forestry and logistics: exclude land 
steeper than a threshold grade; land far from major 
infrastructure; containing a low biomass density 
excluded
…exploring three main types of biomass
Low-grade and forest and sawmill residuals: wood 
residues, primary residues from forest harvests, 
secondary residues, and low-grade roundwood
Excludes high-quality roundwood such as sawlogs
Agricultural biomass: primary residues (e.g., stalks, 
leaves) and secondary residues (e.g., processing 
residues like bagasse) 
Waste biomass: woody municipal waste, sludges, 
cooking oils, animal fats, food processing wastes, 
and other municipal wastes
