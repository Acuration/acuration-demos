A note from our CEO at Drax
We care about what matters and we’re committed to conducting our business with 
honesty and integrity, and in accordance with all relevant laws and regulations. 
In addition, we aim to follow through on our commitments - doing what we say 
we’ll do. This is true of our engagement with colleagues (which, for the purposes 
of this Code of Conduct includes non-permanent workers), suppliers, business 
partners and other stakeholders. Whether you work for or on behalf of Drax, this 
Code helps you to do the right thing. It sets out our high-level principles in relation 
to several important topics and the standards of behaviour we expect from you. 
If you’re ever concerned that something isn’t consistent with our Code, please 
speak up. You can talk to your line manager, supplier (for non-permanent workers), 
a member of Group Business Ethics, or to me through my Sli.do. 
You can also contact our external ‘Speak Up’ service. I assure you that Drax won’t 
tolerate any negative consequences to you as a result of you seeking advice, raising 
genuine concerns or reporting misconduct. 
Thanks for reading and following our Code of Conduct.

Introduction
Welcome to our Code of Conduct. 
The following sections introduce the Code, explain who it’s for and 
provide advice and support for when you need it.

Our Code of Conduct exists to help everyone at Drax ‘do the right thing’. 
It shows what we expect from our Drax colleagues - both permanent employees 
and non-permanent workers - and anyone working on behalf of Drax. The Code 
also helps us to aim for and maintain consistently high standards in everything 
we do.
This document features a range of individual, subject-specific codes to outline 
the principles we should all use in our work and in our behaviour. You can find 
further details in our supporting policies and guidance, where applicable. Look 
out for the references in the final ‘Resources and contacts’ section, signposted 
in each individual code, which includes details of who to contact for further 
information, help or support. 
If you’re unsure what to do or you need assistance, refer to our ethical decision-
making guide (section 1.5) or use the contact details shown. Please refer to 
specific policies for relevance to non-permanent workers. 
We’ve created this document to provide you with guidance for ‘doing the right 
thing’. You should refer to it, as required, when carrying out your day-to-day work.
You can navigate through the document using the buttons at the top of each 
page as well as the hyperlinks within the text.
Read sections 1.5 and 1.7 to understand best practice – for when you’re not sure 
what to do in a work-based situation, and for when you feel something isn’t right.
Section 2 shows our Code of Conduct principles in their entirety. This provides a 
good overview of what we stand for as a company, and what you need to do to 
meet the standards we expect.
Read the individual codes themselves – which are split into groups (Our place in 
the world, Working together and How we conduct our business) – to:
• Get an overview of the subject matter’s context
• Watch videos (where relevant) that bring the subject to life and supplement 
the eLearning materials on One Drax
• Understand the standards you’re expected to meet
• See frequently asked questions (FAQs) for specific examples of how to apply 
these standards
Use the final section – ‘Resources and contacts’ – for further information and 
contact details for help and support.

Doing the right thing
1.3 
Our purpose and who we are
The phrase ‘doing the right thing’ appears several times in the Code of Conduct. 
In this context, it means acting in a way that positively represents and reinforces 
our values as Drax. 
We’ve written our individual codes with ‘doing the right thing’ in mind. While they 
provide guidance and examples of common situations you might encounter, they 
can’t cover everything. 
If the situation you’re facing isn’t covered by the Code, use our ‘Ethical decision 
making’ guide (see section 1.5).
1 -   Introduction
Our purpose is to enable a zero carbon, lower cost energy future.
We’ll achieve our purpose through focusing on our strategic aims: being a global 
leader in sustainable biomass pellets and negative emissions, and a UK leader in 
dispatchable, renewable generation. 
Our heritage, beliefs, purpose and strategic goals form the basis for the way we 
conduct our business, and for our Code of Conduct. They help us be a purpose-
driven organisation with a unique approach.
Our values
We care about what matters
We believe that achieving a positive economic, social and environmental impact is key to delivering 
long-term value creation.
We’re a ‘can do’ kind of place
We have a diverse, inclusive culture where the continual exchange of ideas and perspectives leads to 
great things.
We see things differently
We see possibilities in how we can help to solve the climate crisis and seek new ways of doing things.
We listen carefully
We listen to our colleagues, communities, customers and partners to better understand their needs 
and deliver the best possible outcomes.
We do what we say we’ll do
We’re delivering on our purpose and believe we’re a world leader in sustainable biomass and bioenergy 
with carbon capture and storage (BECCS).

There are consequences for you, and for Drax, if you don’t follow our Code 
of Conduct.
You might face disciplinary action for serious breaches. This could lead to 
dismissal and/or legal action (including prison sentences) for both permanent 
and non-permanent workers. 
If Drax is found to be in breach of any individual codes, it could damage our 
reputation and adversely affect our working relationships and profits. In some 
instances, breaches could lead to Drax having to pay large fines, be under 
investigation and, potentially, be banned from providing certain services.
1.6
What happens when you don’t follow 
the Code?
1.6.1 Non-retaliation 
We’re committed to having an environment where you can ask questions and 
raise concerns about business ethics and conduct, without fear that it might 
have a negative impact on you. 
Just like you’d report unethical business or breaches of specific codes, you should 
report any behaviour towards you that you feel is retaliation. In such situations, 
contact the Group Business Ethics team or the Whistleblowing Officer.
1 -   Introduction
1.5 
Ethical decision making
The Code features a decision guide to help you choose the right course of action 
when faced with difficulties. 
You should also speak to others – including your line manager or a colleague in the 
Group Business Ethics team – to help guide you. 
Doing the right thing not only reinforces our values, it helps us comply with laws and 
regulations and builds positive working relationships with our customers, colleagues 
and third parties. 
Ask yourself:
Is this legal?
Is this consistent with our code and our values?
Would I feel comfortable if others in my company 
knew about this?
Would I feel comfortable if my decisions or 
actions were made public?
If you answer ‘Yes’ to all these questions, the decision to move forward is likely 
to be OK. If you answer ‘No’ or ‘Maybe’ to any question, stop and seek guidance 
before continuing.

3.1
Environment
As a business, we’ve made public our ambition to become carbon negative by 
2030. We’ll achieve this through a combination of managing, monitoring, and 
reducing the environmental impact of our activities. 
We’ll continuously improve our operations, specifically in relation to emissions to 
air, discharges to water, disposal of waste and the use of natural resources. In our 
operations,  we’ll minimise any adverse impacts on biodiversity by protecting fauna 
and flora. 
In addition, we’ll keep safe the communities in which we operate and take our 
environmental responsibilities and commitments seriously. These communities 
include those around our sites and offices, as well as those touched by our  
supply chains. 
Our purpose at Drax is to enable a zero carbon, lower cost energy future. And we’re 
proud of our work and activities as a business to reduce the impact of climate 
change. Our target isn’t just to comply with environmental legislation; we’re 
committed to being an innovative sustainability leader.
If we’re to succeed, every colleague, business partner and supplier has to play 
their part.

FAQs 
 � Q: What should I do if I believe my part of the business is in breach of 
environmental legislation? 
 � A: Drax is committed to environmental compliance as a minimum standard, so 
you should raise the matter with your line manager, supplier (if you’re a non-
permanent worker), or a local colleague in the Environment team. You can also 
use one of our ‘Speak up’ channels. 
 � Q:  Do I still have to report an environmental incident if it caused no pollution? 
 � A:  Yes – you should report all environmental incidents, no matter what’s 
happened. We investigate all reported incidents as it helps us identify hazards 
and implement changes to prevent them happening again.

4.1 
Safety, health and wellbeing
We work together at Drax to make our workplaces safe, healthy, and secure for 
ourselves, our colleagues, our contractors and visitors, and our communities. 
Our OneSafeDrax vision means making sure we do no harm to our colleagues and 
the public and recognising that our people are at the heart of everything we do. 
We all need to play a part in keeping our workplaces safe: by looking out for our 
own safety and that of others; by following our safe working practices; by reporting 
anything unsafe. 
Being under the influence of alcohol and drugs can affect our health, the safety 
of ourselves and others, and our work performance. We aim to support colleagues 
with drug or alcohol problems and keep everyone safe and well. 
Our ‘My Wellbeing’ resources focus on mental, physical, social, and financial 
wellness. These resources can improve awareness of the tools needed to uplift 
personal and team resilience. We’ve also provided helplines and training for 
managers in supporting wellbeing, to build an organisation that encourages 
wellness for all colleagues.
Principle
The safety and wellbeing of our colleagues, 
contractors and the public is our top priority. 
4 - Working together
What you need to do 
• Avoid putting yourself or others at risk 
• Stop work if you think it’s unsafe 
• Check our Group Safety, Health and Wellbeing Policy, or speak to your line 
manager, if you’re not sure whether an action or decision is safe 
• Be alert to safety hazards and processes 
 x Share your ideas for improving our work practices
 x Report anything that’s unsafe 
 x Always comply with the safety Golden Rules (see the ‘Resources and 
contacts’ section of this Code)
• Report any near misses or safety breaches via our online reporting systems so 
that we can put things right 
• Visit ‘My Wellbeing’ to find tools supporting mental, physical, social, and  
financial wellness 
Talk to your manager, HR business partner or our confidential 
employee assistance provider if you need support with work or 
personal issues. See the ‘Resources and Contacts’ section.

should I do?

4.2 
Diversity, equity and inclusion (DE&I)
A commitment to diversity and inclusion is critical to achieving our strategic 
goals, so we’re designing ways of working that are inclusive and enable access to 
opportunity for all. 
The expertise of our colleagues is a valuable resource; everybody’s contribution 
matters. We believe that by embracing and valuing the differences in who we are, 
our experiences and how we think, we’ll achieve greater things together. 
Diversity is understanding and accepting that we’re all different and recognising 
the importance of treating each other with dignity and respect. 
We encourage and support each other to be ourselves, regardless of: 
• Age
• Sex
• Ethnicity, culture, or race (including 
colour, nationality and ethnic or 
national origin)
• Disability (including any 
cognitive variations or mental 
health conditions)
• Gender or gender identity
• Whether we’re married or in a 
civil partnership 
• Whether we’re pregnant, on 
maternity leave, or parents 
• Religion or belief 
• Sexual orientation
• Educational or social background 
• Physical appearance
• Life experiences
Inclusion means embracing everyone’s individual differences while working 
together to make sure all colleagues feel they belong and are valued and 
respected. Building an inclusive culture ensures everybody has what they need to 
access opportunities. 
We consider diversity and inclusion in everything we do, and we all have a role to 
play in making sure we have an inclusive workplace. It’s our responsibility to treat 
one another with dignity and embrace our differences.
Principle
We’re committed to promoting a supportive, 
diverse, and inclusive working environment, where 
you can be yourself and your contribution matters.

4.3 
Dignity at work
We believe that everyone should be treated with dignity and respect. Individuals 
are different in many ways and we want to embrace and celebrate this diversity. 
Equality is the right of different groups of people to not be subjected to 
discrimination because of their individual characteristics, but to be treated 
equally and fairly. Some jurisdictions in which we operate have specific 
legislation related to this, e.g. the Equality Act 2010 (in the UK) and the Equality 
Act of 1974  (in the United States). Both provide a legal framework to protect the 
rights of individuals and advance equality of opportunity for all. 
Under the UK legislation, the protected characteristics are: 
• Age 
• Disability 
• Gender reassignment 
• Marriage or civil partnership (in 
employment only) 
• Pregnancy and maternity 
• Race (including colour, nationality, 
ethnic or national origin) 
• Religion or belief 
• Sex 
• Sexual orientation 
We each have a responsibility to nurture a positive environment, free of bullying 
and harassment. Think about how your behaviour or language might affect 
others, or how they may interpret it. 
It’s important to understand that bullying and harassment can take many forms; 
what you consider ‘friendly banter’ may not be perceived in the same way by 
everyone else. Promoting equality, dignity, and respect results in: 
• Fair treatment of people 
• Appreciation of our diverse workforce
• Good morale and higher levels of motivation 
• Better performance 
• A loyal workforce and business stability
• Improved reputation for the organisation as a whole 
Conflict resolution
If there’s conflict between colleagues, try to show understanding and resolve 
things informally in the first instance. However, you can raise a formal complaint 
if the issue escalates. When a manager becomes aware of a complaint, they’ll 
take prompt action to investigate. 
A formal complaint could lead to disciplinary action. You shouldn’t fear that you’ll 
be victimised for raising a complaint of bu llying or harassment, or for assisting in 
relevant investigations. 
Retaliation against a colleague for voicing concerns is seen as victimisation and 
may lead to disciplinary action.
Principle
We take a zero-tolerance approach to bullying, 
harassment, and discrimination.

What you need to do 
• Treat colleagues with dignity and respect, and in an inclusive manner 
• Think about your comments or jokes before you make them, to avoid being 
rude or insensitive, or causing offence 
• Consider this Code in all your communications, no matter how informal 
• Contact your local HR team if you think you are, or a colleague is, being bullied, 
harassed, or victimised
• Be responsible for your own behaviour at work and whenever you’re 
representing Drax (including on social media)
Drax can also be held accountable for the behaviour of its third 
parties, so raise any relevant concerns you may have with the Group 
Business Ethics team or via one of our ‘Speak up’ channels.
FAQs 
 � Q:  I’ve heard my colleagues make some unfavourable remarks about  
my sex. However, these have all been verbal – does it still amount to  
sexual harassment? 
 � A:  Sexual harassment can be verbal or non-verbal. Words or gestures can cause 
offence. Jokes, stories and inappropriate comments or actions could be 
considered a form of sexual harassment.
 � Q:  I was recently at a team meeting and one of my colleagues began to shout at 
me and put down the suggestions I raised. Is this considered bullying? 
 � A:  We expect colleagues to act in a professional manner – shouting or raising your 
voice at a colleague is not professional and could be considered bullying. You 
should let your manager know about your concern. If you aren’t comfortable 
doing that, you should contact a local HR colleague, Group Business Ethics, or 
the external Speak Up service.

5.1 
Anti-bribery and corruption 
Drax operates a zero-tolerance policy to bribery and corruption across its 
entire business.
Bribery is usually used to get an unfair business advantage. Corruption is 
the abuse of entrusted power for private gain. Both are against the law and 
against Drax’s principles.
We need to be aware of the different forms bribery and corruption can take 
so we can be sure we’re operating ethically and protecting our reputation. 
If colleagues are found to be involved in bribery or corruption, a disciplinary 
process will be started which could result in dismissal and/or legal action.
For Drax, evidence of bribery or corruption could have a serious impact on its 
brand, its reputation and its profits.
We investigate any concerns and take action if evidence of bribery or 
corruption is found.
Principle
We don’t accept any form of bribery or corruption 
amongst our colleagues or third parties. We act in 
lawful, ethical ways that avoid conflicts of interest, 
and seek constructive relationships with regulators, 
policy makers and politicians.
What to be aware of
As well as more obvious cases like unofficial cash rewards or incentives 
between businesses, we need to look out for the following types of bribery 
and corruption:
Facilitation payments
These are unofficial payments made to encourage or speed up processes 
such as the issuing of permits or licenses. They’re also referred to as ‘bungs’ or 
‘backhanders’.
Unreasonable gifts and hospitality
Offering or accepting gifts and/or hospitality should be clearly in the interests 
of maintaining genuine business relationships, otherwise it could be seen as a 
form of bribery or corruption.
Conflicts of interest
A conflict of interest occurs when someone’s own interests interfere with them 
performing their role properly or may interfere with the best interests of Drax. 
Financial, commercial, or other ‘out of work’ relationships can create potential 
or actual conflicts. Sometimes a relationship can be perceived as a conflict of 
interest, to avoid doubt, you should report this.  
Examples could include a colleague:
• Having a financial interest – such as a shareholding – in a company with which 
Drax has a commercial relationship 
• Acting as a director of another company that’s a supplier to Drax 
• Being a member of an organisation that opposes the business activities of Drax

Interactions with public officials*
This business interaction poses a particularly high risk in relation to bribery due 
to the strict rules and regulations in many countries. It’s prohibited to provide 
money or anything else of value, no matter how small, to any public official for the 
purpose of influencing them in their official capacity.
We should be particularly mindful of: 
• Political donations - we don’t give donations to political parties (i.e. to fund
electoral campaigns)
• Political lobbying - we take extra care in any dealings with policy makers,
politicians, regulators and government; we stay honest and transparent in
communications, and work in line with relevant laws
• Gifts and hospitality - when dealing with public officials, colleagues should
seek approval from the External Affairs team before providing accommodation,
expenses or hospitality
5  – How we conduct our business
Managing bribery and corruption risk
Ethical due diligence
Conducting due diligence before signing a contract ensures that any risks are 
flagged early on and that we’re able to verify third parties and individuals working 
with, or on behalf of, Drax. 
Drax takes a risk-based approach and selects those that demonstrate their values 
and commitment to ethical business practices. 
Our Ethical Due Diligence guide provides instructions on how to request ethical 
due diligence prior to onboarding a new third party. If you have any questions 
about this process, or about the third party you’d like to work with, please get in 
touch with the Group Business Ethics team.
Gifts and hospitality
Offering or accepting gifts and/or hospitality should be clearly in the interests of 
maintaining genuine business relationships. If this isn’t the case, others may see it 
as a form of bribery or corruption.
If you’re exchanging gifts and/or hospitality, refer to the Gifts and hospitality guide. 
What you need to do 
• Never offer, pay, invite or accept a bribe. The only exception is if there’s a
credible threat to your personal wellbeing, health or safety
• Don’t make facilitation payments of any value
• Familiarise yourself with the Gifts and Hospitality guide, and only offer or
accept gifts or hospitality which it recommends are acceptable
• Record gifts or hospitality offered or accepted, as required
• Avoid financial, commercial or other relationships that could conflict – or be
perceived as conflicting – with Drax’s interests or the performance of or its
business operations
• Report potential or actual conflicts of interest to your line manager and Group
Business Ethics in line with the Conflicts of Interest guide
• Never offer money, hospitality or gifts to politicians, government officials or
regulators - or accept these from them - without permission
*including employees of government-owned or controlled commercial enterprises, international organisations 
and political parties, those in government departments and political candidates themselves

FAQs 
 � Q:  I need to use a supplier that’s not approved on the system – what should I do?
 � A:  You shouldn’t use a supplier unless they’ve been approved, because it exposes 
the business to unknown risks. Contact the Group Business Ethics team for 
more information about supplier approvals and to report any knowledge of non-
approved suppliers already acting for Drax. 
 � Q:  One of our suppliers has invited me to a major tennis tournament. 
Can I accept? 
 � A:  Firstly, assess whether your attendance serves a legitimate business purpose, 
and that it’s proportionate. If you decide to proceed, get your line manager’s 
approval. Lastly, ensure that you record your attendance, and any gift and/or 
hospitality that you’re giving or receiving transparently.  Check the ‘Gifts and 
hospitality’ guide.
 � Q:  My partner works for a company that’s a supplier to Drax. Sometimes I’m 
responsible for purchasing items that may come from this supplier. What 
should I do? 
 � A:  Purchasing from this supplier may be a conflict of interest, but it would – in the 
initial assessment – depend on your partner’s role. Inform your line manager 
and raise it (via our Self-Service Portal) as a potential conflict. Group Business 
Ethics will assess and put in place the necessary mitigations to avoid a conflict.
 � Q:  As a Drax colleague, can I stand for political office? 
 � A:  Yes, as long as you’re not using the Drax name or attributing your views to the 
business. Drax must authorise any activity that you plan to do during work time. 
Speak to your line manager for further guidance.

5.2 
Financial crime 
We take a strong stance on financial crime, always act with integrity, and expect 
those wanting to do business with us to do the same. 
Fraud, deception and dishonesty 
We must be vigilant to protect Drax against fraud, and ensure the criminal activity 
of a third party doesn’t have a negative impact upon us. If we identify fraud, we’ll 
report those involved to the appropriate law enforcement agency/agencies. 
Fraud is usually carried out for profit. It’s a criminal offence in most countries and 
can include: 
• ‘False representation’ – a false or misleading statement made knowingly
• ‘Fraud by failing to disclose information’ – failure to make information known
where there’s a legal duty to disclose it
• ‘Fraud by abuse of position’ – acting against the financial interests of a person
or company when expected to safeguard them
• Possessing, making or supplying goods for fraudulent use
• Obtaining services dishonestly
Others may try to defraud Drax, so it’s important to be vigilant of attempts such as 
phishing emails.
Tax evasion
Tax evasion is a type of fraud that arises through the illegal non-payment or 
underpayment of taxes owed. Drax doesn’t tolerate tax fraud within its own 
business or its supply chains. We’ve designed our ethical due diligence and 
payment procedures to make sure we comply with relevant tax laws. 
Money laundering
Money laundering is another form of financial crime where criminals seek to 
introduce funds of criminal origin into the legitimate economy.  Refer any concerns 
to Group Business Ethics. 
We’d never knowingly facilitate money laundering, and we report any suspicion of 
money laundering to the appropriate authorities. 
Financial and trade sanctions
Sanctions are political, trade, or financial restrictions aimed at bringing about a 
change in another country or in an individual’s activities or policies. In particular, 
sanctions are used if breaches of international law or human rights have occurred, 
or democracy is threatened. 
The scope of international sanctions is widening for many reasons, such as the 
ongoing and increasing threat of terrorism and international conflict. Sanctions can 
take many forms; the most relevant to Drax relate to financial matters and trade.
Drax will not transact with nation states, entities and/or individuals in breach of 
sanctions imposed by the UK, US, Canada, European Union (EU) or United Nations 
(UN). To do so may be a criminal offence. 
We should always know who we’re doing business with and be alert to the possible 
impact of sanctions. Our Ethical Due Diligence guide explains our third party 
onboarding procedures, which can help mitigate this risk.
Principle
We protect Drax against fraud and don’t defraud, 
evade tax or play any part in money laundering. 
We observe the trade controls of all countries we 
operate in.

Do I need to do anything else to follow up?
 � A: Yes – provide the details to the Group Business Ethics team. They’ll pass them 
on to the appropriate law enforcement agency/agencies. The team may also 
be able to learn something from the attempt, even though our procedures 
prevented the fraud.

5.3 
Fair competition 
Competition and anti-trust laws aim to protect the consumer by upholding 
fair behaviour in business. The laws prohibit anti-competitive agreements and 
behaviour – particularly between businesses that operate in the same sector – and 
the abuse of dominant market positions. 
The laws also prohibit sharing, exchanging, or discussing any competitively 
sensitive information with competitors. Doing so may be interpreted as entering 
into an illegal agreement and subject to severe penalties.
Examples of behaviour that could lead to penalties include entering into 
understandings or agreements to: 
• Allocate products, territories, customers or employees 
• Bid, not bid, or agree on the content of any proposed bid 
• Fix, increase, decrease, stabilise, or standardise prices or production output 
or capacity 
• Not do business with certain companies, customers, distributors or suppliers 
• Not solicit a competitor’s customers, distributors, suppliers or employees
Failure to comply with these laws can expose Drax to the risk of reputational 
damage, penalties including substantial criminal fines, and claims for substantial 
monetary damages from third parties. It may also expose individuals to criminal 
prosecution and directors to disqualification. 
If the competition authorities decide to investigate Drax, they may read any 
document we write, or record we create, including emails and messages. It’s 
therefore important to remain professional in all our communications.

Principle
We don’t enter into anti-competitive agreements or 
abuse our market position.

What you need to do 
• Don’t make formal or informal agreements with competitors that result in price 
fixing, bid rigging, market allocation or arrangements to limit supply 
• Consult a member of the Group Legal team before you even consider any 
restrictions on customers, joint venture partners or suppliers (in terms of who 
they can sell to or buy from, and on what terms) 
• Don’t share with competitors any commercially sensitive information relating 
to prices, ongoing bids, terms and conditions of sales, market share, costs or 
profit margins 
Report any suspicions or allegations of anti-competitive behaviour to 
the Group Legal team. Seek the team’s advice if you’re unsure how to 
proceed or need more guidance .
FAQs 
 � Q: During a trade association meeting, two of our competitors started to discuss 
profit margins and unit costs. Should I have intervened at the meeting? 
 � A: Yes. A regulatory authority may conclude that everyone at the meeting 
implicitly agreed to use the information to align prices. If you find yourself 
in that situation, you should state that you believe the conversation is 
inappropriate, leave the meeting immediately, then speak to a colleague in the 
Group Legal team. 
 � Q: I’ve inadvertently forwarded some commercially sensitive information to a 
third party. What should I do? 
 � A: If you sent the information by email, recall the email if possible, then 
immediately contact the recipient(s) and confirm that you sent it in error. Ask 
them to delete it and not use or share it. Seek and obtain written confirmation 
from the recipients that they’ve done so and discuss the issue with your line 
manager or a colleague in the Group Legal or Group Business Ethics teams.

5.5 
Market abuse 
Market abuse is behaviour that affects the integrity of financial markets and/or 
wholesale energy markets and prevents market transparency. 
The regulations about market abuse protect investors, and we support  
the regulations by safeguarding against market abuse. Attempting to  
affect markets by abusing inside information (see definitions below), or 
attempting to manipulate markets by knowingly spreading false information, 
are serious offences. 
Drax securities
Drax securities can take the form of equities (ownership via stocks and shares) or 
debts (money borrowed and due for repayment). 
They’re dealt in ways that include: 
• The purchase, sale or transfer of shares
• The exercise of share options
• Entering into contracts for difference or equity swaps
As Drax securities are publicly traded, colleagues dealing in them must comply 
with the strict rules that prevent market abuse. Anyone in possession of ‘inside 
information’ can’t deal in, or recommend that another person deals in, Drax 
securities. Dealing when in possession of inside information is both a civil and 
criminal offence. 
We define ‘inside’ information relevant to securities as information that: 
• Is of a precise nature
• Is not generally available (so you only know it because you’re a Drax colleague)
• Relates, directly or indirectly, to Drax or any Drax securities
• Would, if generally available, be likely to affect the price of Drax securities
Examples might include:
• Major business developments, like substantial projects
• Regulatory developments
• Dividend announcements
• Significant changes in expectations of our performance
• Changes to our Board of Directors
• Major contracts awarded
Only authorised people should access and disclose inside information relating to 
Drax. If you find yourself in possession of inside information, contact the Group 
Company Secretary immediately. Colleagues may face disciplinary proceedings (and 
consultants/contractors may be in breach of their contract with Drax) if they abuse 
inside information, and may also face civil or criminal proceedings. 
Wholesale energy market 
The Drax Generation business buys and sells power on the wholesale energy 
markets. Drax as a company, and individual colleagues, must comply with strict rules 
that  prevent market manipulation. Adhering to these rules avoids Drax entering 
into energy-product contracts when it is, or its colleagues are, in possession of 
inside information. 
Principle
We don’t misuse inside information and we trade 
Drax securities in compliance with applicable laws 
and regulations.

We define ‘inside information’ relevant to the wholesale energy market as 
information that: 
• Is of a precise nature
• Is not generally available (so you only know it because you’re a Drax colleague)
• Relates, directly or indirectly, to Drax, any other market participant or any
wholesale energy product
• Would, if generally available, be likely to have a significant effect on the price
of wholesale energy products
What you need to do 
• Don’t deal – or recommend that anyone else deals – in any Drax securities if
you’re in possession of inside information
• Don’t deal in the securities of other companies if you’ve come into possession
of relevant inside information through your work

• Don’t share any confidential information about Drax (including any
inside information) except where you’re required to do so as part of your
employment/engagement
• Read and understand the Group-wide Regulation on Energy Market Integrity
and Transparency (REMIT) Policy, and comply with its guidance if you’re
involved in:
•
 Dealing wholesale gas or electricity
•
 Declaring inside information relating to Drax units to the public
Contact the Group Company Secretary (Drax securities) or the 
Wholesale Market Compliance team immediately:
•
If you come into possession of inside information
•
For advice before dealing if you intend to enter a transaction
FAQs 
 � Q:  Why would I need to submit a ‘permission to deal’ request, and how would I 
do it? 
 � A: If you’re on the ‘clearance to deal’ list, or on a confidential project list, you’ll 
need to seek permission before dealing in Drax securities. You can do this via 
the Howells online portal and by selecting the ‘Request consent to deal’ tab. 
Contact the Group Company Secretary if you need any help. 
 � Q:  I think I have inside information in relation to the availability of a Drax 
generation asset, or one belonging to a third party. What should I do?
 � A:  Inside information relating to our generation assets (and those of third parties) 
is particularly relevant to REMIT. Don’t disclose this information to anyone else – 
instead, contact the Wholesale Market Compliance team immediately.

Human and labour rights
Human rights are basic rights that belong to all of us. They’re based on important 
principles like respect, fairness, dignity and equality. Human rights laws are an 
important means of protection for us all, but especially for those who may face 
abuse, neglect and isolation.
Respecting human rights is fundamental to the sustainability of Drax, our 
colleagues and the communities in which we operate. We’re committed to 
preventing any abuse of human rights within our business operations and 
throughout our connected supply chains. 
At Drax, we have zero tolerance for modern slavery in any form, including human 
trafficking. That means we’ll work to identify any risk of modern slavery in our 
own business and supply chains. It also means that if we identify risks, we’ll strive 
to understand the causes and seek to mitigate or eliminate them. 
Each year, we report on our work to reduce the risk of modern slavery in 
our business and supply chains. These annual statements are available on 
our website.
Watch “Human rights” video by clicking here
Supply chain
We don’t tolerate human rights breaches – either within Drax or across our supply 
chains. Therefore, we conduct ethical due diligence on those we work with. 
We participate in the UN’s Global Compact and use internationally recognised 
human rights standards (e.g. UN Guiding Principles on Business and Human 
Rights) to influence decisions about our supply chain. Wherever there’s an 
impact upon human rights, we believe it’s vital to address, mitigate and correct it 
ourselves. 
If we work with an individual or organisation that can’t uphold our commitment 
to human rights, we’ll take relevant action. This may include ending the working 
relationship and reporting the abuse: victim protection and remediation of issues 
will always be our primary concern in these circumstances.
5  – How we conduct our business
Principle
We respect human and labour rights, and 
we’re committed to conducting our business 
relationships with honesty, integrity and respect.

Please discuss with your local HR team any concerns related to the following:
• Diversity and equality
• Dignity at work
• Fair pay and benefits
• Working hours
• Collective bargaining and freedom of association issues
Immediately report any concerns related to suspected human rights 
abuses to Group Business Ethics. You can also use the external Speak 
Up service or, if you’re based in the UK, call the ‘Modern Slavery and 
Exploitation Helpline’ on 0800 0121 700 for advice.
FAQs 
 � Q:  I witnessed obvious signs of modern slavery while visiting the premises of a 
third party. What should I do?
 � A:  There are many signs to look out for with regards to forced labour or modern 
slavery. Any one factor, or a combination of factors, could suggest a person’s a 
potential victim. 
�
Report your concerns to the Group Business Ethics team rather than getting 
directly involved. If it transpires that modern slavery is occurring, we’ll make sure 
that the appropriate course of action is taken to protect the victim. 
 � Q:  I am exploring working with a third party who operates in a country considered 
high risk for modern slavery, what should I do?
 � A:  Consult the Ethical Due Diligence guide and raise a request for ethical due 
diligence on the third party, as per the instructions provided 
Fair pay 
Remuneration is a key aspect of every colleague’s quality of life. We operate a fair 
reward and recognition process that’s supportive of fair pay, employment rights 
and development. 
We pay everyone directly employed by Drax in the UK at least the real Living 
Wage. We pay everyone directly employed by Drax outside of the UK in line with 
respective local laws. 
We give clear written information about pay to anyone due to start working for 
Drax, before their employment begins. Each time we pay them, they’ll receive the 
details for the pay period concerned (as set out on colleague payslips). 
Working hours 
When setting our standard working hours, we aim to: 
• Make sure we can meet our business needs
• Enable colleagues to maintain a healthy work/life balance
• Operate within the law
While we may request that colleagues work overtime in certain instances to 
fulfil business needs, we also understand that individuals do so on a voluntary 
basis. We consider the hours worked, and the frequency of overtime requests for 
individual colleagues and for the workforce as a whole. If overtime requirements 
become regular, we look to expand the working capacity by hiring  
additional staff. 
What we expect of you 
• Be familiar with, and comply with, the policies listed under Resources
and contacts
• Raise due diligence requests for any new third parties in line with the Ethical
due diligence guide
• Look for obvious signs of human rights abuses such as modern slavery, on our
own sites and when visiting third-party sites

Collective bargaining and 
freedom of association 
The right to collective bargaining allows colleagues to freely negotiate their 
working conditions with their employers. Freedom of association is the right of 
colleagues to form and/or join trade unions or organisations of their choosing. 
These rights apply to all colleagues, and we uphold them at Drax: 
• We have an open attitude towards the activities of trade unions
• We don’t discriminate against workers’ representatives, and we give them 
access to carry out their functions in the workplace
• We allow alternate forms of worker representation in situations where the 
right to freedom of association and collective bargaining is restricted by 
applicable laws and regulations
What you need to do
•
Report any suspicions of a restriction on the right to collective bargaining and freedom
of association to a colleague in your local HR team
FAQs
 � Q: I suspect that a restriction has been placed on the right to collective bargaining at 
another Drax location – what should I do?
 � A:  You should discuss the matter with a local HR representative.
 � Q:  Why is freedom of association important for Drax?
 � A:  It’s the right thing to do and potentially of benefit to our colleagues.
�
Promoting and respecting freedom of association can also result in a positive
�
business environment. This can include better economic competitiveness,
�
quick and easy dispute resolution, skills development and health and safety
�
improvements.
 � Q:  What constitutes a detriment on union membership grounds?
 � A:  Penalising a colleague for - or preventing them from - becoming or trying
�
to become a member of a trade union or for making use of a trade union’s
�
services. It would also be a detriment to penalise a colleague for - or prevent
�
or deter them from - taking part in the activities of a trade union at an
�
appropriate time
5  – How we conduct our business

We believe that the decision to join a trade union is 
an individual choice.

Privacy and protection 
We comply with the requirements of global data protection laws and respect 
individuals’ privacy rights. 
These laws require that we make sure individuals can exercise their rights in 
relation to their own personal information. We maintain policies, processes 
and systems to safeguard the privacy of individuals and protect their personal 
information as if it were our own. If personal information is accidentally or 
deliberately destroyed, lost, altered, disclosed or accessed, we may need to report it 
to the relevant regulator within a very short timeframe.  
We also make sure that any third parties that process personal information on our 
behalf do the same. We take extra care when processing sensitive information, 
including racial and ethnic origin, political opinions, religious and philosophical 
beliefs, a person’s sex life or orientation, health information, criminal records and 
trade union membership.  
If our colleagues don’t follow the relevant laws, we could be subject to  legal 
proceedings. Breaches of the law could also damage our reputation or commercial 
interests, and any involved directors could be prosecuted or disqualified from 
holding office. There could also be personal criminal consequences if colleagues 
wilfully or recklessly break the law.
What you need to do 
• Respect the rights of individuals whose personal information you process 
• Only create, save, process, hold, disclose and transfer personal information in 
line with our security and data protection policies: ‘respect and protect’
• Don’t access or disclose personal information to anyone inside or outside Drax, 
unless in line with both applicable laws and our company policies 
 
Immediately report a breach to the Data Protection team

We act responsibly when gathering, processing 
and sharing personal data to make sure individuals’ 
privacy rights are protected.

 � A: No - you shouldn’t send this information to the third party, as it would be 
contrary to our Code of Conduct, may break national laws, and could subject 
Drax and/or you to legal action. 
 � Q: My work colleague is accessing personal information without authorisation. 
What should I do? 
 � A: If you know that someone – a colleague, contractor, or anyone else – has 
access to information that they shouldn’t be looking at, raise the concern 
immediately. Either speak to your line manager or the Data Protection team. 
Alternatively, raise your concerns via the Self-Service Portal or via one of our 
‘Speak up’ channels (see section 1.7). 
 � Q: Apart from raising concerns, what else should I use the Self-Service  
Portal for? 
 � A:  You should use the portal for privacy and protection issues including: 
 �
•  Reporting an incident 
 �
•  Escalating an individual rights request 
 �
•  Requesting data protection due diligence on a third party 
 �
•  Seeking advice and guidance 
 �
•  Conducting an  impact assessment 
 � Q:  What’s the difference between security and personal data privacy? 
 � A:  It’s best to see security as the ‘lock’ that makes sure personal data is kept 
secure. Privacy is the ‘key’ to that lock. It makes sure that personal data is only 
used: 
 �
•  For lawful purposes 
 �
•  In a manner that makes sure the rights and freedoms of individuals are 
respected and protected

Data security and management
Information security is everyone’s responsibility. It can affect us all, both in our 
work and personal lives. Being vigilant and following best practice helps us 
protect ourselves and Drax. 
To help protect Drax from threats, we configure our processes, systems and 
assets (e.g. laptops) with security controls built in. You shouldn’t reconfigure 
these measures unless you’re specifically authorised to change them. 
What you need to do 
• Familiarise yourself with the Acceptable Use Policy and follow its guidance 
• Don’t change configured IT settings or affect company processes, including: 
 x Turning off personal firewalls or anti-virus software 
 x Installing unauthorised software 
 x Reconfiguring software settings 
 x Turning off software updates and patches 
 x Changing or attempting to anonymise user settings, as this could affect 
our ability to respond to cyber attacks 
 x Allowing third parties to remotely control our systems or to install software 
 x Using unauthorised file-sharing sites
 x Adding any Drax information to your personal email
• Don’t act, access, process or publish in a way that might harm the company’s 
reputation, or in a way that contradicts: 
 x Our values and principles 
 x Our Security Policy 
 x Any applicable laws, including those relating to copyright and trademarks 
• Make sure you create complex, difficult-to-guess passwords and protect them
• Report incidents (e.g. loss of equipment) and suspicious activity (e.g. phishing 
emails) to the IT service desk via the Self-Service Portal. Alternatively, use the 
‘Report Message’ tab from the top menu in Outlook 
• Only use work equipment (including portable storage devices) for its  
intended purpose
In terms of information you become party to while working for Drax: 
• Only use it for the benefit of Drax 
• Make sure you store it safely 
• Don’t share or publish it without permission 
• Delete it once you no longer need it
Check you’re sharing the right information with the right person  
before sending emails or other communications. 
Principle
We ensure appropriate protection and handling  
of data.

FAQs 
 � Q:  I sometimes chat to work colleagues on social media about my work at Drax. 
That’s OK, isn’t it? 
 � A:  No – only use Drax-approved systems to discuss work. Don’t share confidential 
information (such as commercially sensitive information or Drax-controlled 
personal data) online, or make comments/posts that could damage our brand 
reputation.  
 
If you’re using social media to comment on something the company has an 
interest in, make it clear (e.g. by including a line in your Twitter bio information) 
it’s your opinion and that you’re not speaking on behalf of Drax.  
 � Q:  Can I use my personal device to access Drax systems? 
 � A:  You’re allowed access on your personal device(s) to Drax-managed Microsoft 
Office 365 applications (e.g. Outlook for emails, Teams) since they’re protected 
by Office 365 security measures. All other use of personal devices is by 
exception and needs approval by IT. Whichever device you’re using, you should 
abide by our Security Policy. Your local IT service desk can help you get set up – 
you’ll find their contact details in the ‘Resources and contacts’ section.

Confidentiality
As a Drax colleague or non-permanent worker, you’ll have access to information 
about Drax and our companies, people, locations, suppliers, customers and 
business partners. While some of that information will be publicly available, some 
will be confidential and require protection. Protecting confidential information is 
everyone’s responsibility at Drax.
‘Confidential information’ means any information or material belonging to Drax or 
in its possession. It can also be information that you only know because you’re a 
Drax colleague. Confidential information might be spoken, appear in writing, or take 
another form. 
It can relate to Drax: 
• Financial information, business plans, projections and strategies 
• Property, business practices, relationships, processes, systems and methods 
of operation 
• Specifications, pricing policies, marketing plans and costs 
• Customer, supplier or employee information or agreements 
• Technical information, inventions, innovations, improvements, know-how, 
trade secrets and other proprietary information 
Misuse of Drax confidential information can have serious consequences, so only 
share it internally and when absolutely necessary. 
Only disclose confidential information to a third party with appropriate 
authorisation and use secure communications. Treat confidential information 
belonging to customers or other third parties in the same way.
What you need to do 
• Don’t seek to receive other parties’ confidential information unless authorised 
• Don’t copy or share confidential material (including software) unless 
authorised 
• Don’t seek access to classified materials unless required for business purposes 
• When other parties provide us with documents in confidence, keep them 
secure and protected using appropriate Drax systems 
• Don’t share commercially sensitive information about a customer, supplier, 
joint venture or other business partner without their permission 
• Make sure you’re sending the right information to the right recipients when 
emailing or sharing via other channels 
• Don’t leave sensitive information unattended (e.g. lock the screen on your 
computer whenever you’re leaving it unattended) 
• Avoid discussing confidential information in public spaces 
• Avoid openly working with confidential information in public spaces 
FAQs 
 � Q:  During a meeting with a customer, they place a file of information in front of 
me that may contain a competitor’s information and then leave the room. Can 
I open this file and read the information?
 � A:  Don’t open the file or read the information. When the customer returns, you 
should confirm that you haven’t looked at it.
Principle
We keep business information confidential, and 
never use it for personal gain or in a way that could 
harm Drax.

Use of Drax resources 
We protect valuable technology, intellectual property and commercially sensitive 
information from unauthorised use and disclosure. 
We take individual responsibility for the care of property – including IT systems, 
materials, facilities, budgets and equipment – belonging to Drax and to our 
customers. We recognise that you may use work equipment and office spaces 
for limited personal use, but expect that you:
• Use your work details (like your email address) for work activities and personal 
details for personal activities 
• Keep your personal web and email activity separate to your Drax work 
• Keep use of personal web access, phones and email to a minimum, and never 
let it get in the way of your work 
• Don’t engage in personal political activities in work time, or use Drax resources 
without authorisation 
• Don’t use Drax property for anything illegal or in ways that might reflect badly 
on the company 
• Recognise that Drax needs to reserve the right to log and monitor activity on 
its network and systems, which could mean that records of your personal use 
are accessible if an investigation is required
What you need to do 
• Minimise the use of Drax assets for personal purposes 
• Look after the Drax assets provided to you (e.g. passwords, laptop, phone) 
• Only access and use information that you genuinely need for work purposes 
• Don’t use, sell, transfer or dispose of Drax business assets for personal gain 
FAQs 
 � Q:  I have a Drax laptop. Are there any restrictions on using it to access the 
internet at home and in my own time?
 � A:  Yes. Our information systems exist for the purpose of conducting Drax 
business. While we accept a minimal amount of personal use, it shouldn’t affect 
your performance or that of your colleagues, harm the company’s reputation 
or interfere with the business. Using company hardware to access illegal, 
offensive or inappropriate material is unacceptable. Nobody other than you 
should use your equipment when it’s in your care. 
Principle
We use our assets and resources carefully, 
efficiently and for the benefit of Drax.

Keeping accurate business records 
We aim to keep our financial and other records complete, accurate and filed 
safely. These records include: 
• Contracts 
• Payroll 
• Expense reports 
• Emails 
• Accounting and financial data 
• Measurement and performance records 
• Electronic data files 
We’re all responsible for recording company information accurately and for 
retaining and disposing of company records according to our policies. In this  
way, we can help to: 
• Protect Drax resources
• Meet the expectations of customers, investors and suppliers
• Make sure information’s easily accessible for as long as it’s needed 
Falsifying Drax records in any way – or destroying, altering or withholding 
them – is a serious offence and may result in prosecution. If you think there’s 
an inaccuracy in our books, reports or invoices, or a weakness in our accounting 
systems, report it to the Finance team. Alternatively, raise it via one of our ‘Speak 
up’ channels (see section 1.7). 
Even unintentional mistakes in our financial records, reports, invoices – or 
anything else that affects our external reporting – could be against the law. So, 
we’re keen to avoid any inaccuracies.
Principle
We make sure that our reporting is complete and 
accurate.
5  – How we conduct our business
What you need to do 
• Record all expenditure and transactions, or any other aspect of Drax business, 
accurately and on time 
• Claim expenses and book business travel and accommodation in line with the 
Travel and Expense policy; ask if you’re unsure 
• Take extra care to be accurate when making – or storing – business or 
statutory records 
• Preserve business documents and records in accordance with our Records 
Retention and Destruction Standard 
• Don’t do anything that would compromise the accuracy or integrity of our 
business records, reports, products or services 
Report inaccuracies in our records that are outside of your control  
to the Finance team, or via one of our ‘Speak up’ channels  
(see section 1.7.2)
FAQs 
 � Q:  My manager has asked me to move some costs to another department, which 
is showing an underspend, so that our department isn’t seen as over-budget. Is 
that OK? 
 � A:  No – you’d be artificially manipulating the results. Moving costs between 
departments or businesses is only justifiable when there’s a valid reason, such 
as the provision of a service from one area to the other.

Media and communications 
Our reputation as Drax is incredibly important to us. We build, protect and maintain 
it by making sure we behave in a manner that reflects positively on the Drax brand. 
What appears in news coverage and social media, as well as what we say and do, 
helps to build (or diminish) our reputation. Therefore, we assist the news media in 
understanding our business, and make sure the information we provide is accurate. 
The External Affairs team is responsible for managing relevant policy and external 
relationships, and for communicating via our websites and on social media. 
Drax recognises that colleagues may wish to use their devices and communication 
channels to publish material on the internet and social media. You should do this 
in a manner that’s consistent with both your contract of employment and our 
Acceptable use policy. 
If you have a complaint to make about a colleague or workplace matter, don’t 
communicate it via social media. Instead, raise it in line with your local grievance 
procedure or according to the processes described in ‘Speaking up’ (section 1.7). 
Please note that we encourage colleagues to promote social media content from 
Drax (e.g. by sharing its Twitter, Facebook, LinkedIn and Instagram posts). When 
doing so, please follow the social media guidance in our ‘Acceptable use’ policy.
What you need to do 
• Always act in a way that protects or enhances the Drax brand and  
our reputation 
• Use care and good judgement when speaking about Drax or our people, 
including when outside of work 
• Don’t use social media to post or display information about Drax and its 
stakeholders that’s vulgar, obscene, threatening, intimidating, harassing, 
libellous or discriminatory
• Get authorisation from the Media team before speaking to the news media 
about Drax business activities 
• Get authorisation from the Investor Relations team and/or the Group Company 
Secretary before speaking to members of the investment community about 
Drax business activities 
• Keep confidential all sensitive information about Drax
Watch “Media and communications” video by clicking here
Principle
We make sure that any information we share is 
accurate and appropriate; we engage the External 
Communications team when required.

FAQs 
 � Q:  What counts as sensitive information? 
 � A:  This is any information relating to Drax or our colleagues, customers, 
contractors or suppliers that’s not already in the public domain. If in doubt, 
please check with the Company Secretarial team.  
 
Because Drax is a listed company, it’s critical that you don’t share sensitive 
information or publicly comment on legal issues, share prices, financial 
performance, forecasts, strategy or rumours.
 � Q:  What should I do if a journalist questions me about Drax activities or the Drax 
position on an issue? 
 � A:  Refer all queries from journalists to the Media team, so they can decide how  
to proceed. 
 � Q:  Some of my colleagues are using Facebook to make derogatory comments 
about people in their team, both inside and outside working hours. What 
should I do? 
 � A:  This is unacceptable behaviour and you should tell your line manager, supplier 
(if you’re a  non-permanent worker), or the Group Business Ethics team as soon 
as possible. You can also raise it via one of our ‘Speak up’ channels (see section 
2.3). Where possible, you should provide evidence of the comments (e.g.  
a screenshot).
