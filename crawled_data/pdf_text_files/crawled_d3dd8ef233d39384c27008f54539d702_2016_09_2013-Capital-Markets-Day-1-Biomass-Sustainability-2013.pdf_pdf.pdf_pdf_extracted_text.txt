Sustainability underpins everything we do
Sustainable Biomass
Sustainable biomass is a low carbon fuel
Carbon neutral at point of combustion
•
Takes carbon out of the atmosphere when
growing and returns it when burnt
Sourced from sustainably managed forests
or agriculture
•
More productive and absorb more carbon than
undermanaged forests or agriculture
•
Maintain / increase carbon stock
Low carbon emissions from supply chain
•
Assessment of full life cycle carbon footprint now
well developed – forest / field to furnace
Significant carbon savings relative to
coal-fired and gas-fired generation

and forestry
Reject all illegal or non-sustainable biomass
Use of well tried systems and procedures
•
Risk assessment on country and catchment area

•
Pre-contract audits
•
Minimum performance standards
- E.g. carbon stock, life cycle GHG(1) savings, biodiversity
protection
Regular independent update audits and own
supplier visits
•
Compliance assessment
•
Policy and risk areas assessment
Annual ISAE 3000 audit to confirm compliance
