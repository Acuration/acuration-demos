The use of forest biomass for climate change 
mitigation: dispelling some misconceptions 
IEA Bioenergy, August 2020 
Recent articles and statements in the media1  and 2� raise concerns over the climate effects of using 
forest biomass for bioenergy. As some statements seem to reflect misconceptions about forest 
bioenergy, IEA Bioenergy here provides a brief overview of key facts about the use of forest biomass 
for climate change mitigation. 
1. Forest bioenergy is not by definition carbon neutral; emissions in the supply chain and impacts 
on forest carbon stock must be included.   
Bioenergy is sometimes said to be “carbon neutral” in the sense that the carbon that is released 
during combustion (biogenic carbon emissions) has previously been sequestered from the 
atmosphere and will be sequestered again as the plants regrow. But “carbon neutrality” is an 
unhelpful term because it is ambiguous and used differently in different contexts. As is further 
elaborated below, biogenic carbon needs to be considered in assessments in order to fully reflect 
how bioenergy will affect atmospheric GHG concentrations. If extraction of biomass for energy leads 
to a decline in the forest carbon stock or carbon sink strength, this needs to be accounted for. 
Furthermore, assessments need to consider all emissions associated with the production, processing, 
transport and use of bioenergy.  Finally, the bioenergy scenario should be compared with a 
counterfactual scenario, in which energy is provided by another source, to quantify the net effect on 
GHG emissions.  
2. Forest biomass is not treated as carbon neutral in national greenhouse gas inventories. 
The treatment of bioenergy in greenhouse gas inventories has been criticized for containing a 
loophole because bioenergy is “counted as carbon neutral”. This is incorrect. Under the agreed 
approach for preparation of national greenhouse gas inventories, countries report harvest of forests 
for any purpose, including bioenergy, as a CO2 emission in the land use sector3. CO2 emissions from 
combustion of biomass for energy are not counted in the energy sector to avoid double counting 
with the land use sector. Thus, there is no accounting error that requires correction, or emission that

is overlooked in reporting, and bioenergy is not assumed to be carbon neutral: if bioenergy leads to a 
reduction (or slower growth) in forest carbon stock this is reflected in national inventories4. Fuel use 
in the supply chain is counted in the energy sector of the country where the fuel is consumed, as for 
all other traded materials including energy carriers.  
Where biomass for bioenergy is traded, the importing country reports no emissions, while the 
exporting country reports the emissions in the land sector. This convention could be criticised as 
supporting “outsourcing” of emissions by the importing country. This issue applies also to off-shore 
manufacturing. For instance, a large share of emissions associated with production of goods 
consumed in Europe is reported by China, where manufacturing occurs5.  The case of biomass 
imports for bioenergy is an example where policymakers have recognized and taken action to 
address this challenge6. The EU RED II requires that forest biomass is sourced  only from locations 
where legislation at national/subnational level, or management systems at the forest sourcing area, 
ensure that forests are regenerated and that carbon stocks and sink levels in the forest are 
maintained or strengthened over the long term7. Specifically concerning EU pellet importation from 
the United States, data show that forest carbon stocks in the south-eastern United States (SE US) 
where biomass is sourced, are steadily increasing8, and biomass harvests for wood pellets represent 
only a small fraction of harvest removals from forests in the SE US9. 
3. Climate effects of using woody biomass cannot be determined at stand level; assessments 
need to be made at the landscape (estate) level.  
A forest estate is generally managed as a series of stands of different ages, harvested at different 
times, to produce a constant supply of wood products. When considered at stand level, much of the 
carbon that has been sequestered into the stand as the trees grow is abruptly lost from the stand at 
the time of harvest, and is not fully sequestered again until the stand has reached harvest age. Stand-
level assessments that start the accounting when the stand is harvested will, therefore, show upfront 
emissions and a delay before forest bioenergy contributes to net reductions in atmospheric CO2, 
particularly in long-rotation forests.  
However, across the whole forest estate (landscape), i.e. at the scale that forests are managed, 
carbon losses in harvested stands are balanced by carbon gains (growth) in other stands, so the 
carbon stock of production forests is roughly stable. The magnitude of the carbon stocks in forest 
landscapes depends on biophysical factors such as soil and climate conditions, historic and current 
management regimes, and events such as storms, fires and insect outbreaks. To quantify the climate 
 
4 However, there is incomplete coverage under the Kyoto Protocol because only some countries account for 
their GHG emissions in the second (2013- 2020) commitment period. Under the Paris Agreement, commencing 
2020, all parties will include the land sector in their national accounting.

effects of harvesting woody biomass for energy and other products, the effect of this harvesting on 
the development of carbon stocks at the landscape level needs to be determined.  
Landscape-scale assessment can provide a more complete representation of the dynamics of forest 
systems, as it integrates the effects of all changes in forest management and harvesting that take 
place in response to – experienced or anticipated – bioenergy demand. The landscape approach 
therefore helps to identify how total forest carbon stocks are affected by specific changes in forest 
management. For instance, if a new management regime with more residues and/or trees extracted, 
or a shorter rotation length, leads to a long term decline in the carbon stock and carbon sink capacity 
of the forest estate, this would reduce the climate benefit.  On the other hand, an increase in 
demand for bioenergy and other forest products could also incentivise  changes in forest 
management (e.g., improved site preparation, use of nurse trees, advanced genetics, measures to 
reduce risks for forest fires or pests/diseases) that enhance forest sink strength and carbon stocks.  
4. Forest biomass is a renewable energy source if forest productivity is maintained. 
Forest biomass is renewable if it is harvested from forests that are managed such that there is no loss 
of productive capacity – i.e., so that growth rate and therefore capacity to sequester carbon are 
maintained over successive rotations. Sustainable forest management is key to maintaining healthy 
and productive forests. Biomass derived from deforestation should not be recognized as renewable. 
5. The climate change effect of using biomass for energy cannot be determined by comparing 
GHG emissions at the point of combustion.  
It is sometimes stated that CO2 stack emissions per MWh inevitably increase when biomass replaces 
coal. However, at the point of combustion, wood and coal have similar CO2 emission factors, as the 
ratio of heating values between the two fuels is similar to the ratio of carbon content. Furthermore, 
biomass fuel characteristics (moisture content, grindability, heating value) affect the energy 
efficiency of co-firing systems. In large coal power plants, there can be a derating of a few percent, as 
there is more flue gas generated per GJ of fuel, which leaves the stack at a temperature above the 
ambient temperature resulting in so-called stack losses. However, when the co-firing ratio is low 
(<10%) there is usually no significant efficiency penalty. Fuel type (both coal and biomass) also 
matters. For low rank coal, biomass co-firing (especially torrefied biomass) can increase the boiler 
efficiency and net power plant efficiency. The outcome also depends on modifications made when 
power plants are adapted to using biomass (e.g., investments in steam turbine upgrades and internal 
waste heat utilization to dry biomass fuel).  
More importantly, comparing emissions at the point of combustion does not show the effect on 
atmospheric GHG concentrations of switching from fossil fuels to biomass. There is a fundamental 
difference between fossil fuels and biomass: burning fossil fuels releases carbon that has been locked 
up in the ground for millions of years, while burning biomass emits carbon that is part of the biogenic 
carbon cycle. In other words, fossil fuel use increases the total amount of carbon in the biosphere-
atmosphere system, while bioenergy systems operate within this system; if the forest carbon stock is 
constant there is no net transfer of carbon to the atmosphere. 
Instead of comparing GHG emissions at the point of combustion, the biogenic carbon flows and fossil 
GHG emissions associated with the complete life cycle of the bioenergy system need to be compared 
with the GHG emissions in a realistic reference situation (counterfactual scenario) where energy 
sources other than bioenergy are used.  Also, indirect impacts (positive or negative) on land use, 
wood products and fossil fuel use need to be considered.

6. Long-distance transport does not negate the climate benefits of woody biomass as a 
renewable energy source. 
Fossil energy used in the biomass supply chain is generally small compared to the energy content of 
the bioenergy product, even when transported internationally. For example, the fossil fuel use 
related to cultivation and processing of wood pellets corresponds to between 2.5 and 15 g CO2/MJ10. 
Transporting pellets between North America and Europe increases supply chain emissions by up to 5 
g CO2/MJ11 (for comparison: the life cycle GHG emissions of hard coal (supply & combustion) is around 
112 g CO2/MJ). Thus, long-distance transport does not negate the climate benefits of forest-based 
bioenergy; these supply chains still offer substantial climate benefit when sourced from sustainable 
biomass.   
7. Switching from coal to woody biomass reduces atmospheric CO2 over time scales relevant to 
climate stabilisation. 
Some articles point to the fact that forest-based bioenergy systems can cause a short-term increase 
in emissions, although delivering mitigation in the longer term, and  claim that bioenergy is not 
compatible with climate change goals if it has a payback period of more than a decade, due to the 
urgent need to address climate change.  
First, there remains disagreement about the appropriate methodological approach for calculating 
payback time. Stand-level assessments are in our view not appropriate since they represent the 
assessed system as a strict sequence of events (e.g., site preparation, planting or natural 
regeneration, thinning and other silvicultural operations, final felling) that in reality occur 
simultaneously across the forest landscape (see point 3). The outcome for stand-level assessments 
will vary dramatically for the same system, depending on which starting point is chosen (time of 
replanting or time of harvest). Moreover, defining a realistic counterfactual for the calculation of 
payback times is critical, but challenging, considering the dynamics of forestry systems. Some studies 
use unrealistic assumptions for counterfactuals, e.g. assuming that forests planted for commercial 
use are left unharvested when there is no demand for bioenergy, and ignoring that most forest 
biomass used for bioenergy is a by-product of high value timber. 
Second, the relationship between net emissions, global warming and climate stabilisation is complex. 
The IPCC 1.5 report12 shows many alternative trajectories towards stabilization temperatures of 1.5 
and 2 °C. The IPCC emphasizes the need for transformation of all the major sectors of society to 
achieve net zero CO2 emissions, and finds a requirement for carbon dioxide removal in many 
scenarios. The IPCC’s assessment of current scientific understanding does not conclude that 
individual measures towards achieving transformation need to meet specific “payback periods”.

The most important climate change mitigation measure is to transform energy and transport 
systems so that we can leave fossil carbon in the ground. Using bioenergy now, in conjunction with 
other renewables, is an important measure to achieve this. Biomass is a storable, dispatchable 
energy source that can support the rapid expansion of intermittent renewables, providing grid 
stability and balancing. In the longer term, biomass is likely to be primarily used in applications where 
the substitution of carbon- based fuels is particularly difficult, such as in aviation and long-distance 
marine transportation. Biomass may also be increasingly used in applications that deliver net 
negative GHG emissions. For the mid- to longer term, the IPCC 1.5 report found most scenarios that 
deliver climate stabilisation at 1.5 or 2 °C require substantial deployment of negative emissions 
technologies. Bioenergy linked with carbon capture and storage (BECCS) is one of the major available 
options for achieving negative emissions. The further transformation of existing power systems will 
depend on how biobased and other technologies develop to meet future demands, including the 
development of technologies for providing negative emissions that are not based on biomass. 
Concern about near-term emissions is not a strong argument for stopping investments that 
contribute to net emissions reduction beyond 2030, be it the scaling-up of battery manufacturing to 
support electrification of car fleets, the development of rail infrastructure, or the development of 
biomass supply systems and innovation to provide biobased products displacing fossil fuels, cement 
and other GHG-intensive products. We assert that it is critical to focus on the global emissions 
trajectory required to achieve climate stabilization, acknowledging possible trade-offs between 
short- and long-term emissions reduction objectives. A strong focus on short-term carbon balances 
may result in decisions that make long-term climate objectives more difficult to meet.   
8. Sustainability governance is required to ensure that woody biomass used for energy makes a 
positive contribution to addressing climate change and other societal goals. 
Scientific studies have shown that forest-based bioenergy can make a substantial contribution to 
climate stabilisation. Sustainability governance is needed to support achievement of this potential, 
and minimise the risk of negative outcomes. Many countries have rigorous forest management 
regulations requiring implementation of sustainable forest management practices.13 Sustainable 
forest management, such as defined by FSC- or PEFC-endorsed schemes, is used to manage hundreds 
of millions of hectares of forest worldwide, and these practices should be deployed more broadly. 
Sustainability requirements have been developed to govern the eligibility of forest biomass for 
renewable energy in several countries as well as under the updated European Renewable Energy 
Directive. Regulations governing eligibility for bioenergy subsidies in the Netherlands, for example, 
stipulate that natural forests cannot be converted, that biodiversity and forest vitality are at least 
maintained, that forests must be regrown, and that forest carbon stock must be maintained or 
increased in the long term. To secure sustainability compliance and oversight throughout the chain, 
all economic operators are supervised by public authorities and the certification schemes involved. 
9. Managed forests can provide greater climate benefits than conservation forests. 
The cessation of harvesting from forests, to allow them to sequester carbon, has been proposed as a 
climate change mitigation option that also can provide other benefits such as biodiversity protection. 
There are indeed many good reasons for protecting natural forests. With respect to climate, the IPCC 
has pointed out that forests managed for producing sawn timber, bioenergy and other wood 
products can make a greater contribution to climate change mitigation than forests managed for

world’s temperate and boreal forests and produce 49% of the world’s roundwood.

conservation alone. This is for three reasons. First, the sink strength diminishes as conservation 
forests approach maturity; production forests maintained in an actively growing state have high sink 
strength. Second, wood products displace GHG-intensive materials and fossil fuels. Third, carbon in 
forests is vulnerable to loss through natural events such as insect infestations or wildfires, as recently 
seen in many parts of the world including Australia and north America. Managing forests can help to 
increase the total amount of carbon sequestered in the forest and wood products carbon pools, 
reduce the risk of loss of sequestered forest carbon, and reduce fossil fuel use.  
10. Managed forests produce wood for multiple products, not just bioenergy. 
The picture which is often presented, that whole forest stands are cut for bioenergy alone, is 
misleading. Forest biomass for bioenergy is typically obtained from forests managed for multiple 
purposes, including production of pulp and saw logs, and provision of other ecosystem services (e.g., 
air quality improvement, water purification, soil stabilization, biodiversity conservation). Bioenergy 
systems are components in value chains or processes that aim to produce forest products such as 
sawnwood, paper and chemicals. Stems that meet quality requirements are used to produce high 
value products such as sawnwood and wood panels, displacing carbon-intensive building materials 
such as concrete, steel and aluminium, while residues from forestry operations (tops, branches, 
thinnings, wood that is unsuitable for lumber) and wood processing residues are used for bioenergy. 
(e.g.14�) .  When bioenergy from forest biomass displaces fossil fuels, this adds to the climate benefits 
of managed forestry. 
 
In summary 
Energy from woody biomass can contribute to climate change mitigation, as a renewable fuel. It 
should be used efficiently, and when harvested from forests, it must come from sustainably managed 
forests, where carbon stocks are maintained or enhanced on a regional or national basis. Forest 
bioenergy can support rapid transformation of the energy sector. Furthermore, bioenergy linked with 
carbon capture and storage (BECCS) is one of the options that can deliver negative emissions, likely 
to be required to meet the temperature targets of the Paris Agreement. Forest management that 
maintains or increases carbon stocks, while also producing timber, fibre and energy, contributes to 
climate change mitigation by storing carbon on land and replacing carbon-intensive materials and 
fossil fuels.

This forest biomass is not high-value timber, but rather a mix of thinnings, limbs and low-quality stems, 
consistent with the biomass sources identified by Matthews et al. (2018) as having low risk, and leading to low 
GHG emissions.
