Introduction 
1.1 
Overview 
1.1.1 
This document is the Environmental Impact Assessment (EIA) Scoping 
Report for the Millbrook Power Project (hereafter referred to as the ‘Project’) 
which sets out the proposed scope and content of the EIA to support the 
Development Consent Order (DCO) Application and the method by which it 
is intended to be carried out. The report has been prepared by Orbis Energy 
Limited on behalf of Millbrook Power Limited (MPL). 
1.1.2 
The Project as shown on Figure 1 would comprise:  
 
A new Power Generation Plant in the form of a Simple Cycle Gas 
Turbine (SCGT) gas fired peaking power generating station fuelled by 
natural gas and capable of providing an electrical capacity of up to 
299 Megawatts (MW) comprising.  
 
The 
Generating 
Equipment 
including 
the 
Gas 
Turbine 
Generators and balance of plant, which are located within the 
Generating Equipment Site; 
 
A new purpose built Access Road from Green Lane to the 
Generating Equipment Site; and  
 
During construction a temporary construction compound (the 
Laydown Area).  
 
A new Gas Connection to bring natural gas to the Generating 
Equipment from the National Transmission System (NTS) which is 
located within the Gas Connection Opportunity Area; and 
 
A new Electrical Connection to export power from the Generating 
Equipment to the National Grid Electricity Transmission System 
(NETS) for distribution to homes and businesses which is located 
within the Gas Connection Opportunity Area. 
1.1.3 
The Generating Equipment, Access Road and Laydown Area are together 
known as the Power Generation Plant, and are located within the Power 
Generation Plant Site.   
1.1.4 
The Power Generation Plant, Gas Connection, and Electrical Connection, 
are all integral to the generation of electricity and together are referred to as 
the ‘Project’. The land upon which the Project would be developed, or which 
would be required in order to facilitate the development of the Project, is 
referred to as the ‘Project Site’.  The Project is described in more detail in 
Section 3, including the options currently under consideration for the Gas 
Connection and Electrical Connection.   
1.1.5 
The Project would be situated between Bedford and Milton Keynes in 
Central Bedfordshire and Bedford Borough Council.  The approximately 
centre of the Project Site lies at grid reference 501373, 240734.

1.1.6 
The Power Generation Plant Site is located primarily on land within former 
clay pits known as ‘The Rookery’, with the Gas and Electrical Connections 
extending from The Rookery into the surrounding agricultural land.  
1.1.7 
The Rookery, which is comprised of the Rookery North and Rookery South 
Pits, is currently the subject of an ongoing Low Level Restoration Scheme 
(LLRS) by the landowner. The Generating Equipment Site and part of the 
Gas and Electrical Connections would be located within Rookery South Pit. 
The LLRS aims to restore the currently disused Rookery South Pit and 
provide a more formal surface water management plan for both Rookery 
North and Rookery South Pits.  Once restored, Rookery South Pit will be 
approximately 15 m below the surrounding ground level in the vicinity of the 
Generating Equipment Site. 
1.1.8 
The LLRS for Rookery South Pit (assuming no additional proposed 
developments prior to its completion) will comprise: 
 
The re-profiling of the base of the pit involving the extraction of soils 
and clays from the permitted extraction area on the southern side of 
Rookery South with regrading of the base of the pit; 
 
Implementation of surface water drainage measures and construction 
of an attenuation pond in order to facilitate a managed surface water 
drainage strategy; 
 
A landscape strategy to include planting on the site boundary and the 
margins of the attenuation pond; and 
 
Provision of buttresses to the southern, eastern and northern slopes 
to ensure the long-term stability of those slopes, and regrading 
through excavation.    
1.1.9 
To facilitate the proposed LLRS works, extraction of clay from a currently un-
worked area situated directly to the south of Rookery South Pit, will be 
undertaken. This area covers approximately 25 ha and forms part of the 
existing minerals extraction consent boundary, but has not historically been 
subject to excavation works. Deposits won from this area will provide 
material for use in the restoration, re-profiling and buttressing work to 
Rookery South Pit together with the implementation of a landscape and 
ecology strategy, which will integrate with ecological mitigation works and 
strategic landscape planting in Rookery North Pit1.     
1.2 
Need for and Benefits of the Project 
1.2.1 
There is considerable national need for this type of development, 
acknowledged at all levels of Government policy. National planning policy 
supports the need for new electricity infrastructure due to the current ageing 
and inevitable closure of older coal fired power plants and the likely increase 
in demand for electricity over the coming decades.

1.2.2 
The overarching National Policy Statement for Energy (NPS EN-1)2 states 
that ‘gas will continue to play an important role in the electricity sector – 
providing vital flexibility to support an increasing amount of low-carbon 
generation and to maintain security of supply’ (paragraph 3.6.2).  
1.2.3 
Gas is a reliable fuel source. It is acknowledged by Government as being 
essential to a low-carbon economy and to underpin the country’s energy 
security. In addition, gas peaking plants such as the Project provide back-up 
to power generation from renewable sources, particularly wind power, which 
is an increasingly prevalent but intermittent energy source. Modern gas fired 
power plants are among the most efficient and cleanest forms of electricity 
power generation.   
1.2.4 
At present, thermal peaking capacity in the UK is relatively small due to the 
nature of the electricity generation mix on the NETS. There is therefore a 
clear and significant requirement for further capacity to meet the projected 
need for reactive/flexible generation. A dedicated gas fired peaking plant 
such as the Project could allow for the rapid provision of reserve capacity to 
the NETS, thus playing a role in meeting the energy requirements of the UK 
going forward.   
1.3 
The Applicant 
1.3.1 
The Project Applicant is Millbrook Power Limited (MPL). MPL is an energy 
development company established for the Project by Watt Power Limited 
(WPL). 
1.3.2 
WPL has been established to develop flexible gas fired generation assets to 
support the UK Government's drive to a low carbon economy. Stag Energy 
provides the resources through a management services agreement with 
WPL. Stag Energy was founded in 2002 and the company draws on a depth 
of experience within a team that has created and delivered over 10,000 MW 
of power generation and related infrastructure projects across the globe, of 
which 2,500 MW was delivered in the UK. 
1.3.3 
WPL currently has two other 299 MW projects being brought forward through 
the planning process. They are Progress Power Ltd at Eye Airfield in Suffolk 
(www.progresspower.co.uk) and Hirwaun Power Ltd at Hirwaun in South 
Wales (www.hirwaunpower.co.uk). Both projects are now in the pre-
examination phase following acceptance of the DCO Applications by the 
Planning Inspectorate. 
1.3.4 
Similarly, Stag Energy provides resources to the Gateway Storage Company 
Ltd, which is developing an offshore salt cavern gas storage facility in the 
East Irish Sea. The project has been consented by the UK Government, the 
Marine Management Organisation and the local planning authority (Barrow-
in-Furness Borough Council, Cumbria). Further information on the project is 
available at www.gatewaystorage.co.uk.

1.4 
The Consenting Regime and EIA Process 
The Planning Act 2008 
1.4.1 
In England and Wales, an onshore electricity generating station is 
considered to be a Nationally Significant Infrastructure Project (NSIP) under 
the Planning Act 2008 (PA 2008) if its generating capacity is more than 50 
MW. As the proposed Power Generation Plant would have a generating 
capacity of at least 50 MW, and up to 299 MW, it would be classified as an 
NSIP under Section 14(1)(a) and Section 15(2) of the PA 2008. Under 
Section 31 of the PA 2008, development consent is required for 
development that is or forms part of a NSIP and therefore a DCO Application 
will be made to the Secretary of State (SoS).  
Requirement for an EIA and Notification under Regulation 6(1)(b)  
1.4.2 
The Infrastructure Planning (Environmental Impact Assessment) Regulations 
2009 (the EIA Regulations)3 and regulation 5(2)(a) of The Infrastructure 
Planning (Applications: Prescribed Forms and Procedure) Regulations 2009 
impose procedural requirements, in particular, on the carrying out of EIA in 
relation to certain DCO Applications. All development in Schedule 1 
(Schedule 1 development) requires an EIA to be carried out. Development in 
Schedule 2 (Schedule 2 development) requires an EIA to be carried out if 
the project is likely to have significant effects on the environment.  
1.4.3 
The Project has been identified as a Schedule 1 Development and therefore 
the Applicant intends to carry out an EIA for the Project in accordance with 
the EIA Regulations.  The findings of the EIA will be summarised in an 
Environmental Statement (ES) which along with the Scoping Opinion will be 
submitted alongside the DCO Application.   
Consultation Strategy 
1.4.4 
A consultation strategy will be implemented in accordance with Sections 42, 
47 and 48 of PA 20084 and its associated secondary legislation which will 
allow the local community, statutory consultees and interested parties, 
including persons with an interest in any land that is affected by the DCO 
Application, to comment on and input into the planning and development 
process. All representations made during the consultation process will be 
considered carefully and MPL will have regard to all relevant responses prior

to submission of the DCO Application. The outputs generated from the 
formal statutory consultation will be summarised in a consultation report, 
submitted alongside the DCO Application.  
1.4.5 
A Statement of Community Consultation (SoCC) will be agreed with Central 
Bedfordshire and Bedford Borough Councils before being published. The 
SoCC will set out how MPL intends to consult with the local community in 
accordance with Section 47 of the PA 2008 throughout the preparation of the 
DCO Application.  
1.4.6 
MPL has already commenced some preliminary discussions with various 
departments of Central Bedfordshire Council and Bedford Borough Council, 
and, where relevant, the outcome of these consultations has informed this 
report.   
1.5 
Purpose of the Scoping Report 
1.5.1 
This Scoping Report represents MPL’s formal notification to the SoS under 
regulation 6(1)(b) of the EIA Regulations. The report sets out the proposed 
scope and content of the EIA to support the DCO Application and the 
method by which it is intended to be carried out.   
1.5.2 
On behalf of the SoS, the Planning Inspectorate (PINS) is requested to 
acknowledge the regulation 6 notification and confirm that the Project is an 
EIA development in accordance with regulation 4(2)(a) of the EIA 
Regulations. In addition, PINS is requested to provide a Scoping Opinion on 
the possible significant environmental effects of all elements of the Project, 
the proposed methodologies to assess the impacts, and the proposed 
structure of the Environmental Statement (ES) (as presented in Sections 4 
and 5 of this report).   
1.5.3 
PINS and other consultees are also invited to highlight any additional issues 
that they believe should be addressed within the EIA, and to identify any 
sources of information that may be of interest to MPL and the EIA team.

2.3 
Overview of Decision Making under the Planning Act 2008 and Policy 
Context 
2.3.1 
The Project is categorised as a NSIP and will be examined by PINS with the 
decision on the DCO Application made by the SoS under the regime 
established by the PA 2008 as described in Chapter 1.  
2.3.2 
As set out in NPS EN-1 (Overarching National Policy Statement for Energy), 
‘this NPS, when combined with the relevant technology-specific energy NPS, 
provides the primary basis for decisions’ (Paragraph 1.1.1). The decision-
maker ‘should start with a presumption in favour of granting consent to 
applications for energy NSIPs’ (paragraph 4.1.2) and on the basis that the 
urgent national need for such projects is settled.  
2.3.3 
Decisions must also be taken by the SoS having regard to the local impact 
reports and any other matters which the SoS ‘thinks are both important and 
relevant to its decision’ (Section 104 of the PA 2008), which may include the 
National Planning Policy Framework (NPPF), Development Plan Documents 
(DPD) or other documents in the Local Development Framework (LDF).  
2.4 
National Policy Statements 
2.4.1 
PA 2008 required new policy to inform decisions on NSIPs in England and 
Wales. Policy for such infrastructure is set out in National Policy Statements 
(NPS). Those that are potentially relevant to the consideration of the DCO 
Application are:  
 
The Overarching National Policy Statement for Energy (NPS EN-1);  
 
The National Policy Statement for Fossil Fuel Electricity Generating 
Infrastructure (NPS EN-2)11;   
 
NPS EN-4 National Policy Statement for Gas Supply Infrastructure 
and Gas and Oil Pipelines12; and   
 
NPS EN-5 National Policy Statement for Electricity Networks 
Infrastructure13.  
2.5 
National Planning Practice Guidance (NPPG)14 
2.5.1 
In September 2013 the government launched the National Planning Practice 
Guidance (NPPG) website which brings together all planning guidance for 
England in one place. It has been designed to support the NPPF. It is 
therefore considered that the NPPG may be a matter of importance and 
relevance, which the SoS may take into account under Section 104(2)(d) PA 
2008.

National Planning Policy Framework for England (NPPF) – 201215 
2.6.1 
The NPPF sets out the Government’s planning policies for England and how 
these are expected to be applied. In the context of an NSIP, the NPPF notes 
at paragraph 3 that the NPPF may be considered as being important and 
relevant in the context of decision making for an NSIP.   
2.6.2 
The NPPF sets sustainable development at the core of its guidelines. 
Policies set in paragraphs 18-219, taken as a whole constitute the 
Government’s view of what sustainable development in England means in 
practice for the planning system. The NPPF focuses its interpretation of 
sustainable development into three dimensions: economic, social and 
environmental.   
2.6.3 
A set of 12 ‘core planning principles’ are also set out in the NPPF. Paragraph 
17 states that planning should ‘support the transition to a low carbon future 
in a changing climate, taking full account of flood risk and coastal change, 
and encourage the reuse of existing resources, including conversion of 
existing buildings, and encourage the use of renewable resources (for 
example, by the development of renewable energy).’   
2.7 
Local Planning Policy 
Central Bedfordshire Core Strategy and Development Management 
Policies (Adopted November 2009)16 
2.7.1 
The Central Bedfordshire Core Strategy and Development Management 
Policies was adopted in November 2009. The document is the key DPD and 
provides the ‘long term vision and the direction for future development in the 
district over the period 2001 – 2026‘.   
2.7.2 
The Project Site is located within the Northern Marston Vale Strategic Area, 
which is allocated for significant housing, employment and regeneration 
uses. Policy CS1 Development Strategy is considered relevant to this report.   
Central Bedfordshire Development Strategy17 
2.7.3 
The Development Strategy for Central Bedfordshire is currently being 
developed and will become, once adopted potentially in 2015, the planning 
policy document for the whole of Central Bedfordshire. It will set out the 
overarching spatial strategy and development principles for the area together 
with more detailed policies to help determine planning applications. The 
strategy will address similar issues to those in the Core Strategy and 
Development Management Policies, but will also consider the allocation of 
strategic development sites.

Project Description 
3.1 
Project Site 
3.1.1 
The Power Generation Plant Site and part of the Gas and Electrical 
Connections would be situated on land within former clay pits known as ‘The 
Rookery’ and designated as Rookery Clay Pits County Wildlife Site (CWS). 
The Rookery is situated in the Marston Vale between Milton Keynes and 
Bedford, approximately 3 km north of Ampthill, a local market town, and 7 
km south west of Bedford in Central Bedfordshire and Bedford Borough. The 
Gas and Electrical Connections would be located within the Opportunity 
Areas identified on Figure 1 and would extend out from The Rookery into 
farmland to the south and/or east of The Rookery.  
3.1.2 
The Rookery comprises two large former clay pits, Rookery North and 
Rookery South Pits, separated by an east-west spine of unexcavated clay. 
The Generating Equipment Site, Laydown Area and parts of the Access 
Road and Gas and Electrical Connections would be located within Rookery 
South Pit which is approximately 95 ha and is bound by steep clay banks 
that are varied in nature and substrate. The pit base currently includes a 
range of wetland habitats, including open water, reed beds, pools and bare 
inundated clay with ephemeral water bodies. The land that remains at the 
original ground level, approximately 42 m above ordnance datum (AOD) 
around the periphery of The Rookery South Pit is predominantly bare ground 
that has been cleared of vegetation. 
3.1.3 
The Rookery is currently the subject of an ongoing LLRS by the landowner 
as described in Chapter 1. Once restored, Rookery South Pit will be 
approximately 15 m below the surrounding ground level in the vicinity of the 
Generating Equipment Site and Laydown Area.   
3.1.4 
A five year option agreement, which is extendable to seven under certain 
conditions, has been signed between MPL and the landowner of Rookery 
Pit. Included in the agreement is the option to purchase between 4 and 8 ha 
of land for the Generating Equipment Site, lease 4 ha of land for use as a 
temporary Laydown Area during construction, and install any necessary 
connection infrastructure as far as their land ownership extends. 
3.1.5 
Road access to the Power Generation Plant Site is currently from the north 
near Stewartby via the A421, Bedford Road and Green Lane, as shown on 
Figure 2. There is a junction on Green Lane leading to an access track on 
the previously unexcavated land on the western side of Rookery North Pit 
which extends southwards into Rookery South Pit and the Generating 
Equipment Site. The Gas and Electrical Connections would either be 
primarily accessed from Junction 13 of the M1 via the A507, Sandhill Close, 
Houghton Lane, Millbrook Road and the B530 Ampthill Road or from Bedford 
Road, via Woburn Road, Manor Road, B530 Ampthill Road and Millbrook 
Road depending on their locations.  
3.1.6 
There are overhead power lines that run west to east south of Rookery 
South Pit. Furthermore, a number of existing public footpaths are located in 
Millbrook Environmental Impact Assessment Scoping Report 
 
Doc Ref: Orbis P1078/04/01 Rev 10 
Page No: 12 
 
and around the Project Site, linking it to the wider Marston Vale. However, 
there is limited public access to Rookery South Pit itself.   
3.1.7 
The Mill Brook watercourse flows in a northerly direction along the western 
flank of Rookery South Pit whilst a tributary watercourse, passing to the 
south of Rookery South Pit within the Project Site, joins Mill Brook in the 
vicinity of South Pillinge Farm as shown on Figure 3.   
Surrounding Area 
3.1.8 
The Rookery, and therefore the Power Generation Plant Site and part of the 
Gas and Electrical Connections, are located within part of a wider dynamic 
landscape that has experienced significant change and will continue to do so 
for the foreseeable future. Substantial areas of land around Stewartby, 
including The Rookery, have been previously worked for clay that was used 
in Stewartby Brickworks until it closed in 2008. To the north of The Rookery 
there remains some buildings associated with the former Stewartby 
Brickworks, including the chimneys. Following clay extraction, the sites have 
been restored (to varying levels of completion) by different means (including 
the disposal of waste) and to different uses, including water based recreation 
and commercial uses.   
3.1.9 
Furthermore, significant regeneration and development is allocated for the 
Northern Marston Vale Growth Area, in which the Project Site is located, as 
referred to in Paragraph 2.7.2. This will result in further change within the 
landscape, not least represented by substantial residential and employment 
development such as in the nearby settlements of Marston Moretaine and 
Stewartby. 
3.1.10 The Gas and Electrical Connection Opportunity Areas, outside of Rookery 
South Pit, are located in a less dynamic landscape set within a mostly 
undeveloped agricultural landscape which includes areas of woodland, 
native hedgerows and a number of water-bodies such as ditches.   
3.1.11 Nearby roads include the A421 which is approximately 2 km to the west and 
the B530 which lies to the east of the Project Site, as shown on Figure 3. 
The A421 connects directly to Junction 13 of the M1 Motorway which is 
approximately 5.6 km to the south east of the Project Site.  Furthermore the 
Midland Mainline Railway and Marston Vale Line border the Power 
Generation Plant Site to the east and west respectively. 
3.1.12 The closest residential dwelling to the Project Site is South Pillinge Farm, 
located approximately 90 m to the west. South Pillinge Farm is separated 
from the Project Site by a small deciduous woodland. To the north of Green 
Lane and The Rookery, lies Stewartby. Other neighbouring residential areas 
include: Houghton Conquest approximately 1.5 km to the east; Marston 
Moretaine approximately 1.2 km to the west; and Millbrook approximately 
400 m to the south as shown on Figures 2 and 3.  
3.1.13 To the west of the Project Site is Marston Vale Millennium Country Park, as 
shown on Figure 3, which provides habitat conservation opportunities, indoor 
and outdoor community amenities and a wind turbine. There is also a Forest 
Centre within the Marston Vale Millennium Country Park located just to the

south of Stewartby Lake which provides the focal point for the indoor and 
outdoor community amenities27. Millbrook Proving Ground, a vehicle testing 
ground, is located to the west of the Gas and Electrical Connection 
Opportunity Areas.  
3.2 
Description of the Project 
3.2.1 
The elements of the Project are described below. The description is based 
on a ‘Rochdale Envelope’ approach (i.e. a single project with a range of 
parameters). The scope of the topic assessments has been described in 
Chapter 5 based on the parameters provided below. Assessing a worst case 
realistic configuration from within the parameters enables an assessment of 
the ‘worst case’ likely significant environmental effects within each topic 
assessment. Each technical chapter within the PEIR and ES will identify 
which parameters represent the ‘worst case’ for that topic. It is 
acknowledged that the parameters may be refined during the design process 
for the Project and following consultation. If this occurs the modified 
parameters will be described and taken into account within the PEIR and ES 
as appropriate.   
3.3 
Power Generation Plant  
3.3.1 
The Power Generation Plant would be designed as a peaking plant fired by 
natural gas supplied by a new underground gas pipeline connecting the 
Power Generation Plant to the existing National Transmission System 
(NTS). It would have a capacity of up to 299 MW (enough to power the 
equivalent of 400,000 homes).   
3.3.2 
As a peaking plant, the Generating Equipment would operate for up to 1,500 
hours per year. Peaking plants are required to operate when there is a 
‘stress event’. This occurs when there is a surge in demand for electricity 
associated with a particular event (e.g. where many people across the 
country boil kettles following the end of a popular television programme) or 
where there is a sudden drop in power being generated from plants which 
are constantly operational (e.g. a sudden outage). Peaking plants also help 
to ‘balance out’ the grid at other times of peak electricity demand and help to 
support the grid at times when other technologies (e.g. renewable energy 
sources, such as wind and solar farms) cannot generate electricity due to 
their intermittent operation and reliance on weather conditions.  
3.3.3 
Given these parameters, it has been determined that a Simple Cycle Gas 
Turbine (SCGT) plant is the preferred and most appropriate technology 
choice for the Project.   
SCGT Plant 
3.3.4 
There are several options of SCGT plant available to generate up to 299 
MW. SCGT plants often use aero-derivative gas turbines (i.e. turbines 
derived from aeronautical applications), primarily because of their suitability 
for frequent start-ups, flexibility, high efficiency and high-availability 
                                                                 
27 Marstonvale.org/millennium-country-park/ 
Millbrook Environmental Impact Assessment Scoping Report

maintenance techniques. For the aero-derivative case, MPL envisages using 
three, four or five individual aero-derivative gas turbine generators to achieve 
299 MW.   
3.3.5 
However, ‘industrial’ type gas turbines can also be used which are typically 
larger and often more suited to longer operational hours. They offer similar 
efficiency but less fast loading flexibility. Industrial gas turbines differ from 
aeronautical designs in that the casings, rotors and blading are of heavier 
construction. For the industrial gas turbine case, it is anticipated that one or 
two individual industrial gas turbine generators will be used to achieve 299 
MW.  
3.3.6 
The main equipment in a SCGT is a Gas Turbine Generator, comprising the 
following components:  
 
Inlet air filter; 
 
Air compressor; 
 
Combustion chamber; 
 
Power turbine(s); and  
 
Exhaust silencer.   
3.3.7 
Air, on entering the gas turbines, would be compressed and natural gas 
injected into the air. The natural gas would then burn in the combustion 
chamber producing hot, high pressure gases. The gas would then expand 
across the blades of the gas turbine driving the electrical generators to 
produce electricity.   
3.3.8 
The waste gases and heat produced from this process would then be 
released to the atmosphere via between one and five stacks (chimneys). 
The stack(s) will contain equipment which will reduce emissions released to 
the atmosphere.    
3.3.9 
A stack height sensitivity study will be undertaken for the Project to 
determine the minimum stack height for the Gas Turbine Generators, 
required for adequate dispersion of emissions and to meet legislative air 
quality targets. This height would apply to all technology choices, as 
discussed above, and would not be dependent on the number of units 
present at the Generating Equipment Site. 
3.3.10 The DCO Application will therefore be flexible enough using the Rochdale 
Envelope approach to allow MPL to achieve a 299 MW project by building 
between one to five Gas Turbine Generators, with up to five exhaust gas flue 
stacks.

Figure 4: Schematic of SCGT Operation  
 
Laydown Area 
3.3.12 A temporary Laydown Area for the storage of plant and equipment during 
construction would be provided adjacent to the Generating Equipment Site. It 
is not proposed that land would be required for a permanent 
maintenance/separate laydown area during operation.  
Access Road 
3.3.13 A new purpose built Access Road would be constructed within the Power 
Generation Plant Site from Green Lane to the Generating Equipment Site. 
The 1.7 km long Access Road would be constructed from tarmac bordered 
by concrete curb. It is anticipated to be single lane with passing places at 
regular intervals to allow vehicles to pass each other.  
3.3.14 The route of the Access Road from Green Lane would follow the existing 
track which borders the lake within Rookery North Pit. On reaching Rookery 
South Pit, the Access Road would use the access ramp (built as part of the 
LLRS as described below) to enter into the pit and cross through the base of 
the pit until it reaches the Generating Equipment Site along the alignment 
shown on Figure 1.   
Dimensions 
3.3.15 The maximum area for the Generating Equipment Site would be in the order 
of 8 ha. The Generating Equipment may be sited in a number of locations 
within the wider Generating Equipment Site depending on its final design. 
The Generating Equipment Site may also be reduced in size during the 
design process with any changes acknowledged in the PEIR and/or ES.   
3.3.16 Table 3.1 provides indicative dimensions for the main plant items which 
would be present within the Generating Equipment Site.

Construction, Operational and Decommissioning Timescales 
3.3.17 Construction and commissioning of the Project would take approximately 22 
months. The main works associated with the construction phase would be 
excavation and site levelling for new foundations, potential piling (if required) 
and the laying of the Gas and Electrical Connections. No requirements for 
demolition or remediation have been identified at this stage.   
3.3.18 It is assumed that as a minimum, the following components of the LLRS will 
be complete prior to construction of the Project commencing:  
 
Topsoil stripping and stockpiling of material from the remaining 
southern permitted extraction area on the southern side of Rookery 
South Pit to enable the extraction of clay for use in the proposed 
restoration works; 
 
Formation of a noise screening bund from stripped topsoil and subsoil 
along the western edge of the works adjacent to Pillinge Farm; 
Millbrook Environmental Impact Assessment Scoping Report 
 
Doc Ref: Orbis P1078/04/01 Rev 10 
Page No: 17 
 
 
Redirection of existing surface water ditches and provision of an 
upper carrier ditch around the southern perimeter of the southern 
permitted excavation area; 
 
Excavation of clay from the southern permitted extraction area to 
provide material for the proposed restoration works and buttressing 
works, including provision of a new access ramp from the extraction 
area into the base of the pit; 
 
Construction of a new access ramp in the north west corner of 
Rookery South Pit; 
 
Construction of a landscaped platform graded so drainage falls 
across the entire base of Rookery South Pit, utilising material won 
from either regarding of the base of the pit or from the southern 
permitted extraction area, to enable gravity drainage to occur in the 
base of the pit; 
 
Construction of surface water interceptor channels collecting to a 
single attenuation pond located at the north western corner of 
Rookery South Pit. The surface water interceptor channels and 
attenuation pond will include habitat mitigation and ecological 
enhancement measures;  
 
Provision of a pumping station to enable external discharge of 
collected waters from the attenuation pond to an existing ditch/culvert 
discharge to Stewartby Lake;  
 
Buttressing of the pit edge slopes to the south (part), east and north 
(part) to provide a slope stabilisation solution for the existing slopes; 
and  
 
Redirection of existing surface water ditches and provision of an 
upper carrier ditch around the southern perimeter of the southern 
excavation area.28   
3.3.19 The Power Generation Plant would be designed to have an operational life 
of 25 years, after which time it would be decommissioned or re-powered 
depending on the nature of the electricity market and energy mix at the time. 
For the purposes of the EIA, it would be assumed that the Power Generation 
Plant would be decommissioned following the end of its operational life.   
3.3.20 Decommissioning would comprise the removal of all Power Generation Plant 
items and restoration of the Project Site to a similar condition compared to 
before the construction of the Project. This process would also take 
approximately 22 months. It is likely that some underground structures, 
including the Gas and Electrical Connections (if an underground Electrical 
Connection is implemented) may be capped and left in situ to avoid any 
adverse environmental impacts associated with their removal. Due regard 
would be paid to all best practice guidelines and legislation on

decommissioning of projects, which are relevant at the time of the 
decommissioning activities. Where possible, items of plant would be 
recycled or reused.   
Carbon Capture Readiness (CCR) and Carbon Capture and Storage 
(CCS) 
3.3.21 At up to 299 MW, the Project would be below the threshold set out in 
Directive 2009/31/EC29 and National Policy Statement EN-1 and EN-2 for 
when operators of combustion plants are required to have assessed the 
feasibility of: a storage site, transport facilities and economic considerations 
of the capture of carbon dioxide (CO2) produced as a result of the 
combustion process. Therefore it is not considered necessary to assess the 
viability of CO2 capture or include it further in this report. 
3.4 
Gas Connection  
3.4.1 
The Gas Connection would be in the form of a new underground gas 
pipeline connection (the Pipeline) and above ground installation (AGI) and is 
required to connect the Generating Equipment to the existing high pressure 
NTS in order to provide a reliable supply of fuel.   
Gas Connection Opportunity Area 
3.4.2 
A Gas Connection Feasibility Study was undertaken in March 2014 in order 
to define and evaluate the options available for connecting the Generating 
Equipment to a suitable source of fuel gas. This identified NTS Feeders 7, 9 
and 26 as possible connection points. The location of these Feeders in 
relation to Project Site is shown on Figure 1. 
3.4.3 
At present, investigations to identify specific route corridor options to the 
Feeders are still ongoing. It is anticipated that the Gas Connection would be 
situated within the Gas Connection Opportunity Area to the south and east of 
the Generating Equipment Site, as shown on Figure 1. The Gas Connection 
Opportunity Area outside of Rookery South Pit comprises large flat to gently 
rolling arable fields bounded by hedgerows and drainage ditches. It extends 
south to just beyond Millbrook Road and to the east beyond the Midland 
Mainline Railway to the B530 Ampthill Road between Chequers Public 
House and the Engineering Research Establishment close to Reddings 
Wood.   
3.4.4 
All potential routes for the Gas Connection will be selected with due regard 
to relevant factors including environmental, planning, safety, engineering and 
constructability. Further details of the specific routes being considered will be 
provided to consultees when they are available and the route selected will be 
assessed in the PEIR and ES submitted for the DCO Application.

Page No: 19 
 
Connection to the NTS 
3.4.5 
Connection of the Pipeline to an NTS feeder would require two Above 
Ground Installations (AGIs) to be installed which will include: a Minimum 
Offtake Connection (MOC) facility, which would be owned by National Grid 
Company (NGC), and a PIG Trap Facility (PTF) which will be owned by MPL 
(together, referred to as the ‘Above Ground Installation’ or ‘AGI’).   
3.4.6 
The MOC (approximately 40 x 30 m) would contain: 
 
Remotely operable valve (ROV); 
 
Control and instrumentation kiosk; and 
 
Electrical supply kiosk. 
3.4.7 
The PTF (approximately 40 x 30 m) would contain:  
 
PIG launching facility; 
 
Emergency control valve; 
 
Isolation valve; 
 
Control and instrumentation kiosk; and  
 
Electrical supply kiosk. 
3.4.8 
Termination of the Gas Connection would be at a PTF on the Generating 
Equipment Site. This facility would be situated within the Gas Receiving 
Station and would contain the following equipment:  
 
PIG receiving facility;  
 
Isolation valves, metering, heating, filtering, compression and 
pressure regulation equipment;  
 
Electricity supply kiosk; and  
 
Control and instrumentation kiosks. 
3.5 
Electrical Connection  
3.5.1 
The Electrical Connection will comprise all the necessary elements to enable 
power to be exported from the Generating Equipment to the NETS, such as 
a new substation and two new electrical circuits (either in the form of an 
underground cable or overhead line). 
3.5.2 
A grid connection assessment was undertaken in March 2014 in order to 
define and evaluate the options available for connecting the Generating 
Equipment to the NETS. The most suitable point of connection would be a 
new substation to be located either on the Generating Equipment Site or 
adjacent to the line of the existing National Grid double circuit 400 kV line 
(forming part of the NETS) which runs from Sundun to Grendon. The 400kV 
Millbrook Environmental Impact Assessment Scoping Report

Page No: 20 
 
line is located approximately 320 m southwest of the Generating Equipment 
Site as shown on Figure 1.    
3.5.3 
Should an underground export cable option be progressed between the 
substation and NETS, then up to two new sealing end compounds (SECs) 
would also be required. These would be constructed at the point where the 
underground cable emerges to facilitate its connection into the NETS. It is 
possible that one, both or neither of the SEC(s) or substation will be required 
depending on the configuration of the Electrical Connection. 
Electrical Connection Opportunity Area (Underground or Overhead) 
3.5.4 
Specific route corridor options for the Electrical Connection have not been 
identified at present, and options are being investigated within an area 
referred to as the Electrical Connection Opportunity Area to the south of the 
Generating Equipment Site as shown on Figure 1. 
3.5.5 
This area outside of Rookery South Pit comprises gently rolling arable farm 
land, with a number of hedgerows and drainage ditches defining the field 
boundaries. The nearest residential dwelling is South Pillinge Farm, 90 m to 
the north-west of the Electrical Connection Opportunity Area. Millbrook Road 
passes through the south-eastern corner of the Electrical Connection 
Opportunity Area. There are also two public rights of way passing through 
the area.   
3.5.6 
Specific connection options will be explored and further refined to a single 
Electrical Connection option prior to submission of the DCO Application.  
Due regard will be paid to relevant factors including environmental, planning 
and feasibility. Further details of the options being considered will be 
provided to consultees when they are available and the selected option will 
be assessed in the PEIR and ES that will be submitted in support of the 
DCO Application.   
3.6 
Project Site Selection/Design Evolution 
3.6.1 
The choice of site for the development of the Power Generation Plant has 
been carefully considered with various sites and a number of relevant factors 
looked at during this process in accordance with paragraph 4.4.1 of NPS 
EN-1 and NPS EN-2. Key factors included in the selection of the Power 
Generation Plant Site are: 
 
It is within an area identified as being potentially suitable for energy 
infrastructure; 
 
It is in close proximity to a suitable Electrical Connection point; 
 
It is in close proximity to a suitable Gas Connection point; 
 
It is in an industrial setting away from population centres; 
 
It has a well-developed road network and access to the Project Site; 
and  
Millbrook Environmental Impact Assessment Scoping Report 
 
Doc Ref: Orbis P1078/04/01 Rev 10 
Page No: 21 
 
 
There is more than adequate space to develop the Power Generation 
Plant.   
3.6.2 
The final choice of Gas and Electrical Connection options would be selected 
following further consultation and a more thorough assessment of 
constraints and environmental impacts.   
3.6.3 
In terms of design evolution of the Project, the following technology options 
were originally considered for the 299 MW Power Generation Plant: SCGT 
plant: Combined Cycle Gas Turbine (CCGT) plant; and Reciprocating Gas 
Engines (RGE) plant.   
3.6.4 
SCGT is considered to be the most suitable technology choice for generating 
up to 299 MW as a peaking plant at the Project Site based on the following 
environmental, technical and feasibility considerations:  
 
Visual impact: SCGT plants require shorter stack(s) compared to 
CCGT plant and therefore are less visually intrusive in views from the 
surrounding environment; 
 
Water resources: the water requirement of a SCGT plant is 
significantly lower than for CCGT plants; 
 
Noise and available space: noise levels from a SCGT plant would 
typically be lower than for an RGE plant. A larger number of RGE 
units would be required at the Generating Equipment Site to generate 
up to 299 MW. Spatially this may not be possible; 
 
Financial: based on the anticipated electricity market, it is essential 
that the Power Generation Plant of the size proposed will be 
particularly cost effective, as it will be called upon to operate flexibly 
to balance out the National Grid and meet changing demands of 
customers. SCGT plants are better suited to this type of operational 
regime; and  
 
Start up times: SCGT plants are able to start up and shut down much 
quicker than similar sized CCGT plants and are, therefore, better 
suited to meeting variable demands.   
3.6.5 
The potential for using Combined Heat and Power (CHP) opportunities with 
these technologies was also considered. However it is not considered to be 
technically or economically feasible with a SCGT peaking power station 
because the profile for the generation of electrical energy from the station 
cannot be guaranteed to coincide with the required heat demand profile of 
any potential consumer. 
3.6.6 
A more detailed appraisal of the Project Site selection process and design 
evolution will be set out in the PEIR and ES.

Scope and Structure of the EIA 
4.1 
Introduction 
4.1.1 
This Chapter describes the proposed scope and structure for the EIA that 
will be undertaken to support the DCO Application in accordance with the 
EIA Regulations. The key output of the EIA process is ultimately the ES, 
which sets out the likely significant environmental effects of the Project. The 
ES will enable PINS, consultees and the SoS to understand the anticipated 
environmental impacts and effects of the Project.  
4.1.2 
To allow for a precautionary approach, the assessments in the ES will be 
based on a realistic worst case scenario specific to each topic area based on 
the Rochdale Envelope parameters as described in Chapter 3.   
4.2 
Overall ES Structure

4.3 
Cumulative Assessment 
4.3.1 
In accordance with the EIA Regulations, the EIA will take into account other 
developments in the vicinity of the Project Site and will consider the 
cumulative impacts associated with these developments in-conjunction with 
the Project. Developments considered within the cumulative assessment 
include those that are:  
 
In the process of being built; 
 
Permitted application(s) but not yet implemented; 
 
Submitted application(s) not yet determined; 
 
Projects on the National Infrastructure’s programme of projects; 


Detailed Description of ES Impact Sections 
5.1 
Introduction 
5.1.1 
This chapter provides a description of the proposed EIA. It addresses each 
proposed ES technical chapter and describes the current understanding of 
the baseline conditions and assessment methodology for each discipline that 
will determine the likely significant environmental effects of the Project. 
Potential mitigation measures have also been identified where appropriate, 
although these will be set out in detail in the ES. Consultees are invited to 
comment on the methodologies within their scoping responses.  
5.1.2 
Although the sections below deal with the Project as a whole, it is anticipated 
that the ES technical chapters will be sub-divided allowing the assessment of 
effects during the construction, operation and decommissioning phases, 
description of mitigation measures and residual effects to be addressed 
separately for the Power Generation Plant, Gas Connection and Electrical 
Connections as well as together for the overall Project. Cumulative effects 
will be assessed for the Project as a whole.   
5.1.3 
The sections described are set out in the following list:  
 
Air Quality (5.3);  
 
Noise and Vibration (5.4);  
 
Ecology (5.5);  
 
Water Quality and Resources (5.6);  
 
Geology, Ground Conditions and Agriculture (5.7);  
 
Landscape and Visual (5.8);  
 
Traffic, Transport and Access (5.9);  
 
Cultural Heritage and Archaeology (5.10); and 
 
Socio-Economics (5.11). 
5.2 
Significance Criteria 
5.2.1 
The significance of environmental effects resulting from the construction, 
operation and decommissioning of the Project will generally be categorised 
using a series of matrices. These will be developed to describe the 
sensitivity of receptors and resources which have the potential to be 
impacted by the Project and the magnitude of any impacts that are likely to 
arise. The sensitivity of receptors and resources and magnitude of impact 
will be cross-referenced to give an overall significance of effect for any 
potential impact. Where it is not possible to quantify impacts, qualitative 
assessments will be carried out, based on available knowledge and 
professional judgement. 
Millbrook Environmental Impact Assessment Scoping Report 
 
Doc Ref: Orbis P1078/04/01 Rev 09 
Page No: 28 
 
 
5.2.2 
In order to provide a consistent approach and enable comparison of impacts 
upon different environmental receptors, the assessments will generally follow 
the structure and use the terminology outlined below in Tables 5.1 to 5.3. 
However for some sections, significance criteria may need to differ 
depending on the assessment methodology used. Each technical chapter of 
the ES will clearly identify and explain any specific criteria used as well as 
defining what constitutes a significant impact and/or effect. 
5.2.3 
Potential mitigation measures described in the ES will include embedded 
mitigation through design/standard control measures (which will be used to 
produce an initial assessment of impact) and any further specific mitigation 
required (which will be taken into account to produce an assessment of 
residual impacts).

Air Quality 
Introduction 
5.3.1 
The air quality assessment will consider potentially significant air quality 
impacts 
and 
effects 
caused 
by 
the 
construction, 
operation 
and 
decommissioning of the Project on sensitive human and ecological receptors 
in and around the vicinity of the Project Site. Potential effects could include 
those that result from dust during construction and decommissioning and 
stack emissions during operation of the Gas Turbine Generators.   
Baseline 
5.3.2 
Existing ambient air quality and baseline conditions will be reviewed using 
available air quality data and the most recent local authority publications 
Millbrook Environmental Impact Assessment Scoping Report 
 
Doc Ref: Orbis P1078/04/01 Rev 09 
Page No: 30 
 
 
published in accordance with their duties under the Environment Act 199531. 
The assessment will include particular consideration of: designated Air 
Quality Management Areas (AQMAs); any relevant previous studies 
undertaken in the area; the location of sensitive receptors (including 
designated ecological sites); and other significant sources of emissions. 
5.3.3 
The nearest AQMA is within Bedford approximately 10 km northeast of the 
Project Site32. The AQMA, declared primarily on the basis of traffic related 
NO2, covers an area of the town centre including High Street and Prebend 
Street.   
5.3.4 
Brogborough land fill gas fired power station is located approximately 3.7 km 
west of the Project Site and is potentially considered a source of emissions. 
Further consultation will be sought with Central Bedfordshire and Bedford 
Borough Councils and the Environment Agency to determine a definitive list 
of significant emission sources in the area to consider as part of the air 
quality assessment.  
5.3.5 
The existing air quality concentrations at sensitive ecologically designated 
sites will be obtained from DEFRA33. The existing acid and nutrient nitrogen 
deposition rates will be obtained from the UK Air Pollution Information 
System (UK APIS).34  
5.3.6 
Statutory ecologically designated sites within 10 km of the Project Site 
include:  
 
Kings Wood and Glebe Meadows, Houghton Conquest Site of Special 
Scientific Interest (SSSI) and Local Nature Reserve (LNR); 
 
Smithcombe, Sharpenhoe and Sundon Hills SSSI;

Assessment  
5.3.9 
The assessment methodology will be agreed in consultation with the 
Environmental Health Officer (EHO) at Central Bedfordshire and Bedford 
Borough Councils and the Environment Agency.  
5.3.10 The emissions of dust during the construction and decommissioning phases 
of the Project will be assessed in accordance with ‘Guidance on the 
Assessment of the Impacts of Construction on Air Quality and the 
Determination of their Significance‘ (IAQM, 2012)35 and the Department for 
Transport ‘Design Manual for Roads and Bridges (DMRB) Volume 11 
Section 3, Part 1: Air Quality’ and the associated DMRB Screening Method, 
developed by the Highways Agency36. The significance of the potential 
impacts identified will be determined based on the sensitivity of the receptors 
within the potential zones of influence outlined in the IAQM Guidance.  
5.3.11 The air quality assessment for the operational phase of the Power 
Generation Plant will follow the Environment Agency documents ‘Horizontal 
Guidance Note H1 – Annex (f): Air Emissions’37 and the Environment 
Agency Air Quality Modelling and Assessment Unit (AQMAU) ‘Air dispersion 
modelling report requirements (for detailed air dispersion modelling)’38. The 
conversion of NOx to NO2, as applicable for the protection of human health 
under the UK Air Quality Standards Regulations 201039, will adopt the 
approach outlined in the AQMAU Guidance Note ‘Conversion Ratios for NOx 
and NO2’ (2006)40.  
5.3.12 As a peaking plant, the operation of the Generating Equipment will be limited 
through the permitting regime to 1500 hours per annum. The assessment 
will, therefore, be based on the operation of the Generating Equipment, at 
full load, for 1500 hours per annum.  
5.3.13 The atmospheric emissions from the operation of the Generating Equipment 
will be quantified by obtaining information from relevant plant suppliers. 
Where two or more suppliers are being considered, a realistic worst case 
scenario will be used to ensure flexibility. However, only plant that meet 
national emissions limits will be considered.  
5.3.14 The atmospheric dispersion modelling will be performed using the 
Cambridge Environmental Research Consultants (CERC) Air Dispersion 
Modelling Software (ADMS 5.0). An air dispersion model will be set up that 
considers the effects of terrain and buildings (as appropriate to the location 
of the Generating Equipment), together with the most recent available 
meteorological data covering a consecutive five year period (e.g. 2009 to 
2014, inclusive) in accordance with current guidance.

5.3.15 The modelling assessment will estimate the mass concentration of NOx and 
CO at sensitive receptors using the emission limits as specified in Part 2 of 
Annex V to the IED. Initial screening runs will be undertaken to determine an 
acceptable stack height for the stack(s) suitable for adequate dispersion 
based on predicted maximum short term and long term ground level 
concentrations. Detailed atmospheric dispersion modelling will then be 
undertaken on the basis of the selected stack height.  
5.3.16 The results of the detailed dispersion modelling will be presented as 
isopleths, and compared with background levels and relevant standards and 
guidelines (i.e. Air Quality Standards Regulations 2010). Direct comparison 
will be made between the long-term and short-term process contribution 
from the Generating Equipment, the predicted environmental concentrations 
of relevant substances (i.e. process contribution plus background levels) and 
the limits and objectives within the relevant Air Quality Standards 
Regulations 2010. Where appropriate, the significance of the potential 
impact will be determined using the criteria set out in the ‘Development 
Control: Planning for Air Quality‘ (EPUK, 2010) in conjunction with the 
Environment Agency Horizontal Guidance Note H1 – Annex (f).   
5.3.17 The abatement of emissions will be discussed in relation to the application of 
Best Available Techniques (BAT), in accordance with the Environment 
Agency Sector Guidance Note for Combustion Activities (EPR 1.01)41 and 
the UK’s position with regards to the on-going review of the EU IPPC 
Reference Document on BAT for Large Combustion Plants42. Should 
additional mitigation prove to be necessary, the severity of impact, frequency 
of emission and the resultant environmental risk associated with any residual 
impact will be examined.  
5.3.18 Changes in air quality levels for NOx will also be assessed with respect to 
ecology for the European and nationally designated sites within 10 km of the 
Project Site (including, but not necessarily limited to, those identified above). 
The non-statutory habitat sites within 2 km of the Project Site will also be 
considered. An assessment of the increased deposition of both nutrient 
nitrogen and acid due to nitrogen will also be carried out at the statutory 
(both EU and UK) designated ecological sites in accordance with the 
methodologies described in the Environment Agency AQMAU ‘AQTAG06 
Technical Guidance on detailed modelling approach for an appropriate 
assessment for emissions to air’43.  
5.3.19 It is considered that there would not be any noticeable odours associated 
with the operation of the Generating Equipment at or beyond the boundary of 
the Generating Equipment Site and therefore it is not considered necessary 
to undertake a detailed assessment of odour.

5.3.20 The operation of the Gas and Electrical Connections would not produce any 
significant emissions and therefore these elements of the assessment during 
operation have been scoped out. 
Mitigation Measures 
5.3.21 An outline Construction Environmental Management Plan (CEMP) will be 
drafted and appended to the ES which will set out best practice methods of 
limiting dust on site during construction and decommissioning.   
5.3.22 During operation, the Generating Equipment would operate as a peaking 
plant, with operations limited to 1,500 hours per year. This operating limit will 
be set out in the site permit and will not be exceeded. In addition, embedded 
mitigation measures will include: incorporating stack(s) of sufficient height to 
achieve adequate dispersal of pollutants; and using flue gas cleaning 
equipment if required to ensure that all emissions are within concentrations 
permitted by legislation and guidance.   
5.3.23 The need or otherwise for further, project specific mitigation measures will be 
addressed within the ES chapter. 
5.4 
Noise and Vibration 
Introduction 
5.4.1 
In accordance with Section 5.11 of NPS EN-1, a noise and vibration 
assessment for the Project will consider potentially significant noise and 
vibration impacts and effects caused by the construction, operation and 
decommissioning of the Project on Noise Sensitive Receptors (NSRs) in and 
around the vicinity of the Project Site.   
Baseline 
5.4.2 
The greatest sources of noise at present in the vicinity of the Project Site are 
the trains travelling along the Midland Mainline Railway and Marston Vale 
Line and occasional noise associated with vehicles using the Millbrook 
Proving Ground. Other noise sources in the area are associated with 
agricultural practices and vehicles on the surrounding roads especially in 
and surrounding the Gas and Electrical Connection Opportunity Areas.   
5.4.3 
The closest NSRs within 1 km of the Project Site include those within the 
nearby settlements of Stewartby, Millbrook, Marston Moretaine, and 
Ampthill, How End. In addition there are also farmsteads outside of the 
settlements including but not exclusive to:  
 
South Pillinge Farm; 
 
Church Farm and Church Farm Cottages; 
 
Lower Farm; 
 
Ossory Farm;  


Assessment 
5.4.4 
The assessment methodology will be agreed with the EHOs at Central 
Bedfordshire and Bedford Borough Councils.  
5.4.5 
Construction and decommissioning noise and vibration assessments of the 
Project will be undertaken following guidance in British Standard (BS) 
522844. The assessment will be undertaken as a desk study and will involve:  
 
Identification of construction and decommissioning activities that 
produce significant noise and vibration;   
 
Identification 
of 
NSRs 
within 
100 
m 
of 
construction 
and 
decommissioning activities; and 
 
Prediction of noise and vibration using the methodology contained 
within BS5228.  
5.4.6 
The exact construction and decommissioning methodologies are unlikely to 
be defined until the construction contractor is appointed, which is likely to be 
after the submission of the DCO Application. However, in the absence of this 
data, an outline construction programme will be developed based on 
knowledge and experience of other similar developments. Additionally, the 
typical make up of construction equipment at each stage of the Project 
programme will be ascertained in the same way. For ground improvement 
works (e.g. piling) the noise and vibration assessment will pay due regard to 
the ground conditions at the Generating Equipment Site. Where 
uncertainties exist, realistic worst case assumptions will be used.  
5.4.7 
The quantification of impacts shall be undertaken by comparison with agreed 
project criteria or limits either from previous schemes and relevant guidance  
and standards such as BS5228, BS647245 and BS738546, or local legislative 
requirements. The desk study shall outline suitable measures for the 
mitigation of construction and decommissioning impacts, and an assessment 
of residual impacts and effects.

5.4.8 
Operational noise for the Power Generation Plant will be assessed using the 
methodology from a combination of: BS414247; BS823348; and WHO 
Guidelines for Community Noise49. The likelihood of complaints about noise 
from industrial developments will be predicted using the following criteria 
from BS4142:  
 
When subtracting the background level from the rating level, the 
greater the difference, the greater the likelihood of complaints;  
 
A difference of around +10 dB or more indicates that complaints are 
likely; 
 
A difference of around +5 dB is of marginal significance; and 
 
If the rating level is more than 10 dB below the measured background 
noise level then this is a positive indication that complaints are 
unlikely.  
5.4.9 
The guidance contained in BS8233 will also be used to assess the effects on 
indoor ambient noise levels in living rooms and bedrooms of NSRs when 
they are unoccupied.   
5.4.10 The WHO Guidelines for Community Noise provides health-based guidance 
on suitable noise levels intended to avoid or minimise community annoyance 
by noise. The guidance provides guideline noise levels for both indoor and 
outdoor areas.   
5.4.11 It is proposed that the study area for the noise assessment of operational 
effects shall be defined as the region within 1 km of the Project Site. All 
sensitive receptors, such as residential properties, hospitals, schools, etc. 
within the study area shall be identified in the assessment.  
5.4.12 A Baseline Noise Survey will then be undertaken in the vicinity of the Project 
Site to establish the current baseline noise levels. The locations for the 
Baseline Noise Survey (i.e. locations of the nearest NSRs) will be agreed in 
advance with the EHOs.   
5.4.13 Following baseline noise measurements, a noise model will be produced 
using Cadna software (3-dimensional noise propagation software) which will 
model the measured baseline levels at NSRs, together with sound power 
levels of proposed plant (obtained from relevant suppliers). Where sound 
power levels for proposed plant are not available, suitable data will be 
substituted, although a realistic worst case scenario would always be 
considered. The noise model will highlight the main noise sources and the 
associated noise levels at the NSR locations. Contour plots will also be 
produced clearly showing noise levels at the Power Generation Plant Site, 
NSRs and surrounding areas.

5.4.14 If the model shows that there is potential for a significant effect to be 
experienced at any of the NSRs, the level of required noise mitigation would 
be specified, and measures that could be used to achieve this level of 
mitigation will be incorporated into the model, to provide a ‘with mitigation’ 
scenario.  
5.4.15 The ES section will be compiled using the Institute of Acoustics (IoA) / 
Institute for Environmental Management (IEMA) draft document ‘Guidelines 
for Noise Impact Assessment’50.  
5.4.16 The operation of the Gas Connection is not anticipated to cause any 
increase in background noise and therefore this element has been scoped 
out of the assessment.   
5.4.17 Operational noise from the Electrical Connection has been scoped out as 
there would be no significant effects associated with the potential for a low 
level electrical hum emanating from an overhead line, if one is required. If a 
substation and up to two SECs are required, any low level electrical hum 
associated with the infrastructure will not be perceptible at the NSRs and 
therefore this has also been scoped out of the assessment.   
Potential Mitigation Measures 
5.4.18 An outline CEMP will be drafted and appended to the ES which will set out 
best practice methods of limiting noise and vibration on site during 
construction and decommissioning.   
5.4.19 During operation, mitigation measures could include the use of silencers on 
the loudest plant items within the Generating Equipment.   
5.5 
Ecology 
Introduction 
5.5.1 
An ecology assessment will consider potentially significant impacts and 
effects caused by the construction, operation and decommissioning of the 
Project on ecological resources and receptors in and around the vicinity of 
the Project Site.   
Baseline   
5.5.2 
The Power Generation Plant Site and parts of the Gas and Electrical 
Connection Opportunity Areas within The Rookery, comprises bare earth 
and a mixture of improved grassland with areas of dense continuous scrub, 
tall ruderal vegetation and running water (ditches). The habitats have the 
potential to support bats, badgers, water voles, brown hare, harvest mice, 
nesting birds, reptiles, amphibians (including great crested newts) and a 
range of invertebrates.   
5.5.3 
Outside of Rookery South Pit, the Gas and Electrical Connection Opportunity 
Areas cross through a mixture of intensively managed arable land and 
improved grassland. Other habitats present in both areas include: semi-

natural broadleaved woodland, plantation broadleaved and mixed woodland, 
standing water, running water (ditches), dense continuous scrub, tall ruderal 
vegetation, semi-improved grassland and species poor hedgerows. The 
habitats have the potential to support roosting, foraging and commuting bats, 
badgers, water voles, otter, brown hare, harvest mice, nesting birds, reptiles, 
amphibians (including great crested newts) and invertebrates.   
5.5.4 
A desk based assessment (DBA) and Extended Phase 1 Habitat Survey was 
undertaken at the Project Site in February 2014 (see Appendix A). The 
purpose of the assessment and survey were to:  
 
Identify the main habitats present at the Project Site; 
 
Identify the sensitive ecological receptors (e.g. statutory designated 
sites) in the vicinity of the Project Site; 
 
Assess the potential of the Project Site to support protected species; 
and  
 
Provide recommendations for further assessment works (e.g. Phase 
2 Protected Species Surveys).   
5.5.5 
The following statutory protected SSSIs (for nature conservation) and LNRs 
are located within a 5 km radius of the Project Site as shown on Figure 3:

Assessment 
5.5.7 
In accordance with NPS EN-1 (paragraph 5.3.3) the Ecological Impact 
Assessment (EcIA) will provide an assessment of any potentially significant 
effects on internationally, nationally and locally designated sites of ecological 
or geological conservation importance, on protected species and on habitats 
and other species identified as being of principal importance for the 
conservation of biodiversity. Furthermore opportunities will be taken, where 
practicable, to conserve and enhance biodiversity and geological 
conservation interests. NPS EN-1 also requires that lighting effects will be 
considered on sensitive ecological receptors.   
5.5.8 
Based on the results of the extended Phase 1 Habitat Survey, the following 
Phase 2 protected species surveys are currently being carried out on and 
surrounding the Project Site. 
Bats 
5.5.9 
A ground level tree assessment is being carried out on trees and parcels of 
woodland that would be potentially directly affected. In addition external and 
internal building inspection surveys are being carried out on buildings to be 
affected.   
5.5.10 If signs of roosting bats or features with the potential to be used by roosting 
bats are identified during the inspection surveys, dusk emergence/dawn re-
entry surveys will be carried out. These further surveys (if required) will be 
undertaken in accordance with current best practice guidance (Hundt, 
201251) when bats are most active (i.e. between mid-May and August 
inclusive). The surveys will determine the bat species present on the Project 
Site as well as the spatial distribution and relative activity levels of the 
species. Line transects will be conducted in spring, summer and autumn with 
a static bat detector also placed on each transect.

Badger 
5.5.11 All potential habitats within the Project Site are being surveyed to search for 
and record characteristic signs of badger activity, including: setts, latrine pits, 
foraging holes, badger hair and paw prints following best practice guidance 
(Neal and Cheesman, 199652). Potential habitat includes areas of woodland, 
scrub and hedgerows.   
Water vole 
5.5.12 Water voles are being surveyed using standard methodologies for water vole 
(Strachan et al, 201153). Signs that water voles may be present will be 
indicated by the presence of feeding remains, characteristic grass lawns, 
burrows, runs, footprints, latrines and droppings.   
Breeding birds  
5.5.13 The breeding bird survey has been designed to follow standard guidance as 
set out by Bibby et al (2000)54 and Gilbert et al (1998)55. The survey 
comprises three visits, between March to July (with April, May and June 
being the key months for survey). One dusk survey visit to cover crepuscular 
species such as barn owl is also being undertaken. 
5.5.14 Furthermore where access allows, the farm buildings at Lower Farm and 
South Pillinge Farm, and mature trees on site are being surveyed for the 
presence of roosting/nesting barn owls following standard guidance (Barn 
Owl Conservation Trust, 201256).   
Great Crested Newts  
5.5.15 Preliminary pond surveys (Habitat Suitability Assessment) indicated that 
there are a number of ponds within 250 m of the Project Site which are 
potentially suitable for great crested newts. An additional four to six surveys 
are being undertaken between mid-March to mid-June to establish 
presence/absence and to estimate population size if great crested newts are 
found during the surveys. More detail on the methodology is provided in 
Appendix 1.  
5.5.16 The LLRS includes a translocation programme currently being undertaken 
within The Rookery. Therefore it is assumed that all Great Crested Newts 
from the Project Site within The Rookery will have been cleared of great 
crested newts prior to construction and are not being surveyed further.    
Reptiles 
5.5.17 A reptile survey is being carried out on the Project Site to establish the 
presence/absence of reptiles, the species present and the approximate

population size. The survey uses artificial refuges (e.g. roofing felt and tin) to 
aid in the detection of reptiles and assessment of their distribution and 
abundance, following good practice guidance set out in the Herpetofauna 
Worker’s Manual (Gent & Gibson, 200357) and Reptile Survey Guidance 
(Froglife, 199958).   
Invertebrates 
5.5.18 In order to determine the assemblage of aquatic invertebrates present on 
site, the flowing ditches and ponds will be surveyed if a Water Framework 
Directive Report is required.   
5.5.19 Kick-sampling for aquatic invertebrates will be undertaken at selected 
locations along ditches or streams. Furthermore the water chemistry status 
will be determined for watercourses by extracting a single water sample at 
three locations within as well as upstream and downstream of the Project 
Site. Samples will be dispatched to a UKAS accredited laboratory for 
subsequent analysis.   
5.5.20 The national pond monitoring survey protocol will be adhered for surveying 
ponds which involves timed netting and searches for invertebrates in 
summer (but may also cover spring and autumn).   
5.5.21 Terrestrial invertebrate surveys will target Lepidoptera (moths and 
butterflies) in accordance with standard guidance developed by the UK 
Butterfly Monitoring Scheme and Coleoptera (beetles) in accordance with 
Natural England (ISIS) protocol (Drake et al, 200759).   
Assessment 
5.5.22 Following the completion of the surveys, reports will be produced, detailing 
the extent to which the species are present, the likely impacts that the 
elements of the Project would have on the species and habitats and the 
potential mitigation measures that could be employed to reduce impacts to 
an acceptable level.   
5.5.23 The EcIA will be undertaken in accordance with relevant guidance including 
the Guidelines for Ecological Impact Assessment (Institute of Ecology and 
Environmental Management (IEEM), 2006)60. The potential effects will also 
be assessed against and informed by national and local planning guidance 
including NPPF and National and Local Biodiversity Action Plans. 
Consultation will be undertaken with Natural England, Environment Agency, 
Central Bedfordshire Council, Bedford Borough Council to identify any 
particular issues of concern.

Habitats Regulation Assessment  
5.5.24 The Conservation of Habitats and Species Regulations 2010 (as amended)61 
require an assessment to be made as to whether the Project, either alone or 
in combination with other plans or projects could have a likely significant 
effect on European sites including SPAs, SACs and Ramsar Sites.   
5.5.25 Consultation with Natural England, PINS and Central Bedfordshire and 
Bedford Borough Councils will determine the requirement for a screening 
exercise, in accordance with the Conservation of Habitats and Species 
Regulations 2010 (as amended)62. The screening exercise will identify any 
likely impacts of the Project upon a European Site, either alone or in 
combination with other plans and projects, and consider whether the impacts 
are likely to be significant.   
5.5.26 If screening concludes there may be likely significant effects on the special 
features for which the European site(s) are classified or designated then a 
report will be provided with the DCO Application showing the European 
site(s) that may be affected together with sufficient information to enable the 
decision maker to make an appropriate assessment, if required.  If screening 
concludes there is no likely significant effect on a European Site sufficient 
information will be provided with the DCO Application in the form of a “No 
Significant Effects Report” to allow the Competent Authority to assess and 
review the information and make its own determination that there are no 
likely effects and be satisfied there is no residual effect.   
Potential Mitigation Measures 
5.5.27 An outline CEMP will be drafted and appended to the ES which will set out 
best practice methods of limiting effects on ecology and biodiversity during 
construction and decommissioning. If necessary, further, specific mitigation 
measures will include the consideration of new habitat provision to suitably 
replace any habitat areas which would be permanently lost through 
development of the Project.

Water Quality and Resources 
Introduction 
5.6.1 
An assessment on the effects on water quality and resources will consider all 
of the potentially significant impacts and effects caused by the construction, 
operation and decommissioning of the Project.   
5.6.2 
The chapter will also provide a summary of the main issues and risks posed 
to and from flooding identified during the Flood Risk Assessment which will 
be submitted as a separate document as part of the DCO Application.  The 
FRA will take the form of a qualitative assessment based on existing 
Environment Agency data and consultation with the Environment Agency 
and Lead Local Flood Authority (LLFA). Additionally, potential impacts on 
hydrogeology will be assessed as part of the chapter describing geology,

ground conditions and agriculture (outlined in Section 5.7 of this Scoping 
Report).   
5.6.3 
At present, it is assumed that during operation the Power Generation Plant 
will utilise air cooling, substantially reducing water intake.  
Baseline 
5.6.4 
The ordinary water courses within and surrounding the Project Site are 
shown on Figure 2. Elstow Brook flows in a north-easterly direction to the 
west of the Project Site, into Stewartby Lake. It then exits Stewartby Lake on 
its northern shoreline and flows to the north of Stewartby. There are also 
smaller streams, brooks, ditches and field drains that are within or close to 
the perimeter of the Rookery South Pit. These include Mill Brook which flows 
westwards along the southern side of Rookery South Pit, before turning 
northwards to follow along the western side of the pit. Mill Brook then passes 
westwards beneath the Marston Vale Line on the western side of the Power 
Generation Plant Site before ultimately flowing into Stewartby Lake. There 
are also ponds and lakes present in both Rookery North Pit and Rookery 
South Pit close to the Access Road. The Project Site is all within Flood Zone 
1. 
5.6.5 
The streams, ponds and ditches within the Gas and Electrical Connection 
Opportunity Areas will be carefully considered during the process of 
identifying the Gas and Electrical Connection Route Corridors. The design 
process will aim to minimise crossings or interactions with water bodies 
where practical.   
5.6.6 
Historical and current maps will be studied to identify abstraction points and 
licences in the area as well as the course of any former watercourses which 
may have been underground or culverted in the past. 
Assessment  
5.6.7 
In accordance with NPS EN-1 the assessment will account for the existing 
status of, and impacts of the Project on water quality, water resources and 
physical characteristics of the water environment including any potential 
eutrophication impacts. The assessment will be undertaken using a risk 
based approach to determine the level of potential impacts by using a 
Source-Pathway-Receptor 
model 
to 
identify 
which 
receptors 
could 
realistically be impacted by a given action. This will include any sources of 
pollution that have the potential to impact on surface water bodies.  
5.6.8 
All aspects of supply, demand and disposal of water and process effluents 
will be addressed for the construction, operational and decommissioning 
phases. Furthermore the disposal of surface water drainage and the process 
effluents will be discussed with a view to maximising the opportunities for 
water recovery and re-use as far as is practicable.  
5.6.9 
Potential discharge locations for site surface waters and process waste 
waters will be identified and a site drainage plan, which may incorporate a 
sustainable drainage system (SuDS), will be discussed at a high level.  
Millbrook Environmental Impact Assessment Scoping Report

5.6.10 There are not anticipated to be any significant impacts on key water bodies 
resulting from the Project. The majority of watercourses are a significant 
distance from the Project Site and therefore will not be directly impacted 
during construction or decommissioning. It is also not anticipated that water 
will be directly abstracted or discharged to or from any of these sources 
during construction, operation or decommissioning of the Power Generation 
Plant.   
5.6.11 Where projects are away from, or unlikely to interact with any water courses, 
it is likely that a Water Framework Directive (WFD) Report will be scoped 
out. However, if the Environment Agency does require the inclusion of a 
WFD Report, it would form an Appendix to the ES.   
5.6.12 During construction of the Gas Connection and the Electrical Connection (in 
the form of an underground cable), best practice working methods will be 
utilised at all water crossings to ensure that there are no adverse impacts on 
flow or drainage and that no contamination is allowed to enter the water 
bodies. Effects during operation and decommissioning are unlikely to occur 
and therefore have been scoped out.   
5.6.13 If an overhead line is used for the Electrical Connection, there will be no 
need for any permanent water crossings or interaction with water bodies of 
any kind. However any temporary water crossings required during 
construction will be assessed.  
Potential Mitigation Measures  
5.6.14 Mitigation measures will be designed in accordance with BS603163, 
BS800464, as CIRIA C64965 and C64866. An outline CEMP will be drafted 
and appended to the ES which will set out best practice methods of limiting 
impacts on water quality and resources during construction and 
decommissioning. Measures would include: siting stockpiles a minimum 
distance from watercourses to avoid pollution runoff; and adhering to best 
practice working guidelines to avoid spillages near watercourses. 
5.6.15 Where the Gas Connection and Electrical Connection (in the form of an 
underground cable or construction vehicles during installation of overhead 
lines) would cross a water body, various crossing techniques would be 
considered. These may include trenchless techniques such as horizontal 
directional drilling, particularly for larger water bodies, or temporary bunding 
and over-pumping where flows are lower. 
5.6.16 Additionally, during construction, operation and decommissioning, silt traps 
and oil interceptors would be placed in drains on site. No untreated surface 
or waste waters would be allowed to drain into water bodies during 
construction, operation or decommissioning. SuDS would be used if found to 
be required.

5.6.17 During all phases of the Project all aqueous process effluents would be 
discharged via the plant drainage systems in accordance with Environment 
Agency limits. The use of biocides would be optimised to ensure that the 
least amount possible is required.   
5.6.18 All oil and chemical storage tanks and areas where drums are stored would 
be surrounded by an impermeable bund sized to contain 110% of capacity. 
In addition multiple tanks or drums would be within bunds sized to contain 
the greater of 110% of the capacity of the largest tank or 25% of the total 
tank’s contents.   
5.6.19 During operation, the Environment Agency would set limits on the quality of 
water that is discharged from the Power Generation Plant under an 
Environmental Permit. The need, or otherwise for further, specific mitigation 
measures will be determined through the EIA process.  
5.7 
Geology, Ground Conditions and Agriculture 
Introduction  
5.7.1 
An assessment on the effects on geology, ground conditions and agriculture 
will consider potentially significant impacts and effects caused by the 
construction, operation and decommissioning of the Project.  It will also 
detail the baseline conditions in terms of ground and groundwater 
contamination and the risks posed to human health particularly in relation to 
future site users.   
Baseline 
5.7.2 
The Power Generation Plant Site and part of the Gas and Electrical 
Connection Opportunity Areas are located on the site of a former clay 
extraction pit where the remains of the former conveyor line still exist in part 
on site, mainly evidenced by concrete plinths along the former route, but also 
as a conveyor bridge crossing over the railway line to the west of the Power 
Generation Plant Site, close to Green Lane.   
5.7.3 
Partial backfilling of Rookery South Pit has been recorded including 
deposition of non-hazardous liquid organic wastes from a variety of industrial 
sources. The waste was reportedly mixed with the Callow deposits and 
pumped, as sludge, into the south eastern quarter of the Rookery North Pit 
and the north eastern quarter of Rookery South Pit.   
5.7.4 
Additional fill to the base of Rookery South Pit has also been historically 
undertaken by placement of variable thicknesses (generally from 1 m to 4 m) 
of Callow Clay Fill across the base of the pit. These naturally occurring 
deposits were unsuitable for the brick making process and were cast back 
into the pit along with brick fragments and other overburden deposits.   
5.7.5 
Further filling to the base and sides of the Rookery South Pit is also 
occurring as part of the LLRS. Fill deposits are being sourced from the 
Oxford Clay Formation to the south of the existing pit and are being placed in 
the base of the pit in order to achieve falls across the base and facilitate a 
surface water attenuation scheme. Engineered fill is also being placed 
Millbrook Environmental Impact Assessment Scoping Report 
 
Doc Ref: Orbis P1078/04/01 Rev 09 
Page No: 46 
 
 
against the northern, eastern and southern sides of the pit, in areas where 
the current slope gradients require additional buttressing works in order to 
ensure that long-term stability can be maintained. 
5.7.6 
The geology underlying the Project Site is composed of valley gravel 
overlying Oxford Clay Formation, Kellaways Formation and Great Oolite 
Group. This has led to water bearing strata present below the Project Site 
within the Blisworth Limestone formation and to a lesser extent the 
Kellaways Sand and Cornbrash Formation. However the permeability of the 
overlying Oxford Clay Formation is very low and these deposits therefore 
effectively act as an impermeable aquiclude, confining the groundwater 
bodies within the underlying strata.   
5.7.7 
Outside of Rookery South Pit, the Gas and Electrical Connection Opportunity 
Areas are located within agricultural fields classified as Grade 3 (good to 
moderate quality agricultural land)67, where there is unlikely to be any 
significant contamination.   
Assessment  
5.7.8 
The assessment will be underpinned by the DEFRA/EA publication 
Contaminated Land Report 11, 2004, ‘Model Procedures for the 
Management of Land Contamination’68 and associated subsequent 
guidance.  
5.7.9 
The assessment approach will be undertaken with a clear understanding of 
the following:  
 
Previous land uses through a review of historical maps;   
 
Underlying ground conditions through a review of BGS maps, and a 
review of previous site investigations (where available); and 
 
Existing physical baseline conditions through a site walkover survey 
and review of a Landmark Envirocheck Report or equivalent.   
5.7.10 The Landmark Envirocheck Report (or equivalent) will identify groundwater 
vulnerability, sites designated for geological importance, details of any 
previous pollution events, details of landfills, waste management sites and 
Control of Major Accident Hazards (COMAH) sites within the Project Site 
and surrounding area.   
5.7.11 A conceptual site model approach will be used to assess the risks posed by 
contaminants to sensitive receptors using a source, pathway receptor model, 
based on the following:  
 
Source – potential source of contamination;

 
Pathway – means by which contamination can reach and impact upon 
a receptor; and  
 
Receptor – that which may be adversely affected by the presence of 
contamination.   
5.7.12 Desk studies will identify potential environmental and geotechnical liabilities 
associated with the Project, including an assessment of potential impacts of 
previous uses of the Project Site and surrounding area. This will enable the 
identification of any potential environmental and geotechnical risks, and the 
design of a focussed and cost efficient intrusive investigation (if required).   
5.7.13 In undertaking the desk study, all available information on the Project Site 
and surrounding area will be reviewed to establish local ground conditions 
and environmental settings. Furthermore, consultation will be held with 
Central Bedfordshire and Bedford Borough Councils and the Environment 
Agency to obtain any other environmental records available for the Project 
Site and to further refine the assessment methodology.   
5.7.14 A site walkover will be undertaken of the Project Site and immediate 
surrounding areas. This will help ensure all potential source, pathway and 
receptor linkages for potential contamination issues have been identified.  
5.7.15 Based on the findings of the desk studies, site walkovers and preliminary risk 
assessment, recommendations will be provided for any further intrusive 
investigation work required to satisfy current standards and guidance and fill 
any data gaps identified to fully inform the assessments of environmental 
and geotechnical risks or liabilities.   
5.7.16 Using the information obtained, suitable remediation strategies will be 
developed to render the Project Site ready for development. These will 
include estimates of the types and volumes of waste material that will need 
to be removed from the Project Site prior to development.   
5.7.17 Additionally, an assessment will be made of the amount of agricultural land, 
if any, that may become sterilised by the Gas and Electrical Connections. 
Should an overhead Electrical Connection be considered, the same 
methodology will be used, although it is considered likely that the potential 
impact on geology, ground conditions and agriculture would be significantly 
less than for a buried connection.  
Potential Mitigation Measures  
5.7.18 An outline CEMP will be drafted and appended to the ES which will set out 
best practice methods of limiting impacts during construction and 
decommissioning. Embedded mitigation measures would include adherence 
to good practice guidelines and could potentially involve the following:  
 
Any additional soil materials that are to be imported to the Project 
Site would be required to have certification of their chemical 
concentrations to ensure that contaminative materials are not being 
introduced to the area;  
Millbrook Environmental Impact Assessment Scoping Report 
 
Doc Ref: Orbis P1078/04/01 Rev 09 
Page No: 48 
 
 
 
In order to further limit disturbance, the site access tracks would be 
constructed first to allow movement of vehicles around the Project 
Site on areas of soft-standing;   
 
Any vegetation, topsoil and subsoil would be removed to expose a 
suitable sub-grade. Any soils, sub-soils or aggregate suitable for 
reuse would be stockpiled on impermeable liners; 
 
Soils which are to be reused onsite would be tested for contamination 
and geotechnical suitability. This would form part of a site waste 
management strategy which would be drafted prior to construction 
and would focus on the re-use, recycling and reduction of waste spoil;  
 
Surface water, perched waters or groundwater from dewatering 
operations would not be discharged to surface water bodies, foul or 
surface water drains without the appropriate consents from the local 
water or sewage company and/or the Environment Agency. The 
disposal of this effluent would be the responsibility of the contractor. 
If necessary, this water would be tanked off-site for disposal at a 
suitable facility;   
 
All foundations would be appropriately specified to resist chemical 
attack from soils or groundwater; and 
 
Foundations and underground pipelines would also be designed so 
as not to present a preferential pathway for contaminant migration, if 
present at the Project Site.   
5.7.19 Further, specific mitigation measures could include, for example, remediation 
of the Power Generation Plant Site, removal of contamination hotspots or 
further site characterisation and will be determined during the EIA.   
5.8 
Landscape and Visual Impact 
Introduction 
5.8.1 
A landscape and visual impact assessment will consider potentially 
significant impacts and effects caused by construction, operation and 
decommissioning of the Project.  The assessment will establish:  
 
A clear understanding of the Project Site and its wider landscape 
setting, identifying the landscape character, resources, value and 
sensitivity to development;  
 
An assessment of the composition, character and aesthetic value of 
views from visual receptors including occupiers of residential 
properties and people using amenity landscapes, and the sensitivity 
of views;   
 
The nature of the different development scenarios and mitigation 
measures; and

Page No: 49 
 
 
 
The likely significant direct and indirect effects of the Project on the 
landscape resource (i.e. landscape elements and character) and on 
visual receptors.  
Baseline  
5.8.2 
The Power Generation Plant Site and part of the Gas and Electrical 
Connection Opportunity Areas are located within The Rookery as described 
in Chapter 3. Rookery North Pit is dominated by a lake. Rookery South Pit is 
currently a landscape in a state of transition due to the ongoing LLRS. The 
wetland areas within the base of the pit are currently being drained and the 
pit is being extended, with the soil won used to stabilise and re-profile the 
existing pit sides.  
5.8.3 
The legacy of clay extraction and brick making is reinforced by the former 
Stewartby brickworks including the cluster of four approximately 50 to 70 m 
tall chimneys adjoining the pit to the north of Green Lane, remnants of the 
original conveyor system and discarded brick piles. In addition to the north of 
The Rookery lies the model village of Stewartby which was built in the 1920s 
for the workers of The London Brick Company who worked at the nearby 
brickworks.   
5.8.4 
To the south and east, the Gas and Electrical Connection Opportunity Areas 
extend into an area characterised by gently rolling large, open fields, with 
hedgerow boundaries interspersed with tree groups, and crossed by existing 
electricity pylons. The Midland Mainline and Marston Vale Line form strong 
linear boundaries to the eastern and western edges of The Rookery. There 
is also a newly erected wind turbine to the west within the Marston Vale 
Millennium Country Park, which is 85 m in height to the hub and 125 m to the 
blade tip.  
5.8.5 
Residential receptors within 1 km of the Project Site include those within the 
nearby settlements of Stewartby, Millbrook, Marston Moretaine, and 
Ampthill, How End. In addition there are also isolated properties and 
farmsteads outside of the settlements including but not exclusive to:  
 
South Pillinge Farm; 
 
Church Farm and Church Farm Cottages; 
 
Lower Farm; 
 
Ossory Farm;  
 
Park Farm;  
 
Manor Farm;

 
Ampthill Park House;   
 
Field Farm; and 
 
Houghton Park Residential care home. 
Assessment  
5.8.6 
The assessment will be carried out in accordance to NPS EN-1 using 
methodology set out in the Guidelines for Landscape and Visual Impact 
Assessment 
(Landscape 
Institute 
and 
Institute 
of 
Environmental 
Management and Assessment, 3rd Edition, 2013)69. It will include:  
 
A desk review of all relevant documents and landscape planning 
policy and guidance;   
 
A field survey to assess baseline landscape character and visual 
amenity;  
 
A description of the key features associated with the Project that 
have the potential to alter the characteristics of the landscape and 
visual baseline;  
 
Appropriate generic and site specific mitigation that is reasonable and 
possible;  
 
Assessment of the predicted significance of residual effects on the 
landscape resource / character and visual amenity and compliance 
with landscape policy; and  
 
An assessment of cumulative impacts arising from the Project, in 
combination with other proposed large scale industrial developments 
in the locality.   
5.8.7 
Initially, a Zone of Theoretical Visibility (ZTV) plan will be generated for the 
Power Generation Plant using specialist software. The ZTV will show a 
maximum theoretical visibility of the Power Generational Plant and any 
overhead line towers, should an overhead Electrical Connection be pursued 
across the surrounding area. The ZTV will be based solely on topography 
and the proposed height of the plant envelope, and any overhead line 
towers. No allowance will be made for intervening screening vegetation or 
buildings, although in practice this tends to have a substantial mitigating 
effect.   
5.8.8 
A review of all relevant landscape planning policy will be undertaken.  
Particular attention will be paid to popular tourist spots and viewpoints, and 
Public Rights of Way. The nearest Area of Outstanding Natural Beauty is the 
Chilterns, which is remote from the Project Site and visually separated from 
the Project Site by an intervening Greensand Ridge and therefore has been 
scoped out of the assessment.

5.8.9 
The Project will be discussed in detail including dimensions of the larger 
buildings, the stack heights, and any other ancillary infrastructure that may 
have an impact on the landscape.  
5.8.10 To assist in the impact assessment, a site visit will be made by a qualified 
Chartered Landscape Architect, who will assess the study area in detail. 
Additionally, and following consultation with relevant stakeholders, a 
selection of photomontages will be taken from key sensitive viewpoints (e.g. 
residential receptors, designated ecological sites, cultural heritage assets 
and key rights of way). Suggested viewpoint locations for photomontages for 
consultation are: 
 
View south west from Stewartby Way, Stewartby; 
 
View south east from Marston Vale Forest Centre; 
 
View north from Sandhill Close, Millbrook; 
 
View north west from Katherine’s Cross, Ampthill Park; 
 
View north west from steps to rear elevation, Houghton House; 
 
View north west from track in front of cottages, Houghton House; 
 
View north from track in front of Ampthill Park House; 
 
View north west from Marston Vale Trail where it crosses B530 
Bedford Street by Laurel Wood north of Ampthill; 
 
View west from footpath in front of Chequers Public House; 
 
View south west from the rear of the Common Room, Stewartby; 
 
View south from the rear of the Village Hall, Stewartby; 
 
View east from the rear of St Mary’s Church, Marston Moretaine; and 
 
View south from the village green, Stewartby.

landscape and visual impact assessment for this element of the work will 
focus solely on the impact of the AGI and the impacts and effects that will 
result from the construction phase.

5.8.13 As for the Gas Connection, if the underground Electrical Connection is 
carried forward, then the LVIA for this element of the work will focus solely 
on the impacts resulting from the presence of the substation and SEC(s) if 
required and the impacts and effects that would result from the construction 
phase.   
5.8.14 If an overhead line is taken forward, the assessment will follow the standard 
LVIA methodology as described above, but will make reference to the 
Holford and Horlock Rules where appropriate. 
Potential Mitigation Measures   
5.8.15 An outline CEMP will be drafted and appended to the ES which will set out 
best practice methods of limiting impacts during construction and 
decommissioning. Embedded mitigation measures would include the careful 
consideration of siting stockpiles and cranes to avoid detrimental impacts on 
the visual amenity of closest receptors.  
5.8.16 During operation, the main embedded mitigation measures would be the 
careful siting and arrangement of the: Power Generation Plant; AGI for the 
Gas Connection; and an overhead line, substation and SEC(s) for the 
Electrical Connection, if required. The final architectural design of the 
buildings and upstanding structures would be carefully considered to provide 
a high standard of visual amenity, given practical and economic constraints.    
5.8.17 Further, detailed mitigation measures could include the consideration for 
onsite or off-site planting to screen views of the Power Generation Plant.   
5.8.18 Due regard will be paid to NPS EN-1, EN-2, and EN-5 and the guidance they 
provide on ‘good design’ in relation to the Gas and Electrical Connections 
and include (to the extent relevant in the case of an underground connection 
for the Gas and Electrical Connection): 
 
Avoid altogether, if possible, the major areas of highest amenity 
value, by planning the general route of the line in the first place, even 
if total mileage is somewhat increased in consequence; 
 
Avoid smaller areas of high amenity value or scientific interest by 
deviation, provided this can be done without using too many angle 
towers, i.e. the bigger structures which are used when lines change 
direction;  
 
Other things being equal, choose the most direct line, with no sharp 
changes of direction and thus with fewer angle towers;  
 
Choose tree and hill backgrounds in preference to sky backgrounds 
wherever possible. Where a line has to cross a ridge, secure this 
opaque background as long as possible, cross obliquely when a dip 
in the ridge provides an opportunity. Where it does not, cross directly, 
preferably between belts of trees;  
Millbrook Environmental Impact Assessment Scoping Report 
 
Doc Ref: Orbis P1078/04/01 Rev 09 
Page No: 53 
 
 
 
Prefer moderately open valleys with woods where the apparent height 
of towers will be reduced, and views of the line will be broken by 
trees;  
 
Where country is flat and sparsely planted, keep the high voltage 
lines as far as possible independent of smaller lines, converging 
routes, distribution poles and other masts, wires and cables, so as to 
avoid a concentration of lines or ‘wirescape’; and  
 
Approach urban areas through industrial zones, where they exist; and 
when pleasant residential and recreational land intervenes between 
the approach line and the substation, carefully assess the 
comparative costs of going underground.   
5.9 
Traffic, Transport and Access 
Introduction 
5.9.1 
An assessment on the effects on traffic, transport and access will consider 
potentially significant impacts and effects caused by the construction, 
operation and decommissioning of the Project.   
5.9.2 
The main impacts of the Project on traffic, transport and access would occur 
during construction and decommissioning resulting from the movement of 
vehicles for the transport of personnel, equipment and materials to and from 
the Project Site. The transport of abnormal loads, which may lead to delays 
and cause inconvenience to other road users, would be timed following 
consultation with the relevant authorities to minimise disruption to the other 
road users.   
5.9.3 
Normal activities during operation would result in fewer traffic movements 
and would be associated with personnel required for operation and 
maintenance of the Project. As such, during operation no significant increase 
in traffic in the area of the Project Site is expected, and no effect on local 
traffic patterns and infrastructure would therefore be anticipated.   
Baseline 
5.9.4 
It is likely that access to the Power Generation Plant Site would be from 
Junction 13 of the M1 via the A421, Bedford Road, Green Lane. The location 
of the roads are shown on Figures 1 and 2. 
5.9.5 
Two options are being considered in regards to accessing the Gas and 
Electrical Connection Opportunity Areas. The first option is from Junction 13 
of the M1 via the A507, Sandhill Close, Houghton Lane, Millbrook Road and 
the B530 Ampthill Road. The second option is from Bedford Road, via 
Woburn Road, Manor Road, B530 Ampthill Road and Millbrook Road. The 
chosen route will be confirmed and described in the detail in the ES.

Assessment 
5.9.6 
The assessment will be undertaken in accordance with the ‘Guidance on 
Transport Assessment’ published by the Department for Transport71 and will 
assess the likely significant impacts of the Project on the local road network.   
5.9.7 
Comparisons between existing traffic flows and estimates of likely traffic 
flows on potentially affected roads will be made to help establish whether 
significant effects are likely. This will take into account: the sensitivity of 
receptors and resources likely to be affected; any potential for disruption to 
local routes; and any changes in the composition of traffic. If considered 
necessary, traffic surveys will be undertaken which will further quantify the 
number of vehicle movements on the existing road network in the vicinity of 
the Project Site.   
5.9.8 
The majority of the proposed access routes are ‘main roads’ that do not have 
pavements for pedestrian use. Nonetheless, the traffic assessment will also 
take full account of the potential impact on pedestrians, and will ensure that 
pedestrians and other road users (cyclists) are not cut off from amenity 
areas as a result of the works.   
5.9.9 
The assessment will consider the following: access and construction routes 
and the types of vehicles used; local highway and rail networks; existing 
traffic flows; current traffic generation; road traffic accident information; 
predicted traffic trends; local highway improvements and planned works; 
and, potential receptors. The full appraisal will be presented (if appropriate) 
in a Transport Assessment which will be accompanied by a draft 
Construction Traffic Management Plan. 
5.9.10 Discussions will be held with the Highways Agency, Bedford Council and 
Central Bedfordshire Council to identify any existing issues relating to traffic 
in the area. Information will also be sought on future development projects in 
the area that could give rise to a significant cumulative impact when 
considered in conjunction with the Project.  
Potential Mitigation Measures  
5.9.11 An outline CEMP will be drafted and appended to the ES which will set out 
best practice methods of limiting impacts during construction and 
decommissioning. Opportunities for reducing traffic movements will be 
explored, such as car share schemes or shift working (i.e. not all 
construction traffic arriving at site at once).  
5.9.12 Details of the proposed measures to improve access by public transport, 
walking and cycling will be provided for the operational phase.

Cultural Heritage and Archaeology 
Introduction 
5.10.1 An assessment on the effects on cultural heritage and archaeological assets 
will consider potentially significant impacts and effects caused by the 
construction, operation and decommissioning of the Project.   
Baseline  
5.10.2 The Power Generation Plant Site and part of the Gas and Electrical 
Connection Opportunity Areas are located within The Rookery. Within 
Rookery South Pit, as a result of the former excavation of the pits associated 
with the Brickworks and the subsequent LLRS earth moving activities there 
is likely to be limited potential for archaeology within the Power Generation 
Plant Site or Gas and Electrical Connection Opportunity Areas where they lie 
within The Rookery.   
5.10.3 In contrast the Gas and Electrical Connection Opportunity Areas beyond 
Rookery South Pit are located primarily within agricultural land where there 
remains the potential for impacts on the buried archaeological resource, as it 
is likely that these parts of the Gas and Electrical Connections would be 
constructed in previously un-developed agricultural land.   
5.10.4 The following cultural heritage assets are located within 5 km of the Project 
Site:  
 
Houghton House: a 17th century mansion and associated courtyard 
and formal garden remains Scheduled Monument;

5.10.5 In addition there are 219 Grade II Listed Buildings within 5 km of the Project 
Site. They include South Pillinge Farmhouse, which is located approximately 
90 m to the west of the Project Site. There are also 49 records for 
undesignated cultural heritage assets within 5 km. These include standing 
buildings, earthworks, parks and areas of ancient woodland, sites of 
structures 
known 
only 
from 
documentary 
sources, 
sub-surface 
archaeological remains, sites recorded only as cropmarks and isolated 
findspots.  
Assessment 
5.10.6 In accordance with NPS EN-1, the objectives of this assessment are to:  
 
Describe the survival and extent of any archaeological features that 
may 
be 
disturbed 
by 
the 
construction, 
operation 
and 
decommissioning of the Project;  
 
Provide an assessment of the importance of these assets;  
 
Assess the likely scale of any impacts on the cultural heritage and 
archaeological resource posed by the construction, operation and 
decommissioning of the Project;   
 
Outline suitable mitigation measures to prevent, reduce and where 
possible offset any significant adverse effects; and  
 
Provide an assessment of any residual effects remaining after 
mitigation.   
5.10.7 Initially, a Desk Based Assessment (DBA) will be undertaken, and will 
include the following detailed searches:   
 
The National Heritage List for England contains an archive for the 
historic environment of England and hosts an online search facility;  
 
Historic Mapping;  
 
Conservation Areas and Historic Landscape Characterisation; and  
 
Historic Environment Records (HER). 
Millbrook Environmental Impact Assessment Scoping Report 
 
Doc Ref: Orbis P1078/04/01 Rev 09 
Page No: 58 
 
 
5.10.8 The DBA will be undertaken in accordance with ‘Standard and Guidance for 
Archaeological Assessments’ (Institute for Archaeologists, 2011)72.   
5.10.9 It is proposed that initially, searches are limited to 1 km from the Project Site 
for HER entries for archaeology as the Project will potentially impact 
archaeology 
within 
the 
development 
footprint 
and 
the 
immediate 
surroundings. The 1 km Study Area provides the opportunity to better 
understand the context of any archaeology present within the development 
footprint.   
5.10.10 As part of the DBA, a site inspection will be undertaken of the Project Site to 
identify any previously unknown archaeological features and their condition. 
During the site inspection a detailed photographic record will be maintained 
and an assessment of the setting of the cultural heritage assets will be 
undertaken.   
5.10.11 In order to gather baseline cultural heritage setting data for inclusion in the 
DBA, and to undertake an assessment of the potential impacts that the 
Project may have on the setting of any above ground remains, selected 
cultural heritage assets will be visited. This will follow an initial study making 
reference to the results of desk-based research, and the ZTV - including 
searches of the records listed above. Assets will be visited where this initial 
study indicates potential for significant impacts. Both the asset and its 
surrounding area will be visited to identify locations that might be relevant to 
the asset’s setting.  
5.10.12 For the purposes of the setting study, the following cultural heritage assets 
will be considered:  
 
Scheduled Ancient Monuments;  
 
Listed Buildings;  
 
Registered Parks and Gardens; 
 
Registered Battlefields;  
 
World Heritage Sites; and 
 
Any other non-scheduled building which is considered to be important 
in terms of cultural heritage and archaeological significance.   
5.10.13 It is proposed that the search area for these cultural heritage assets will be 
limited to 5 km from the Project Site, as significant impacts on setting are 
unlikely to occur beyond 5 km. However, should significant impacts be 
identified at 5 km, then the search area will be expanded accordingly.   
5.10.14 The following factors are also considered to be relevant when assessing 
impacts upon setting:   
 
Visual dominance;

 
Scale;   
 
Intervisibility;  
 
Vistas and sight lines;  
 
Movement and light; and  
 
Unaltered settings.  
5.10.15 The DBA will form the baseline data for the Cultural Heritage and 
Archaeology chapter of the ES. The ES will discuss the nature and location 
of all cultural heritage and archaeological sites within the study area. Further 
to this, the ES will provide an assessment of the significance of any impacts 
to the cultural heritage and archaeology sites.  
5.10.16 At this stage, no intrusive investigations are proposed for cultural heritage or 
archaeological purposes, although this will be confirmed (or otherwise) 
based on the findings of the DBA, and in consultation with the English 
Heritage, Central Bedfordshire Council and Bedford Borough Council. 
Should intrusive investigations be necessary, their scope will be agreed with 
the Planning Archaeologist through a Written Scheme of Investigation (WSI). 
Potential Mitigation Measures  
5.10.17 Prior to construction, the nature and extent of archaeology present at the 
Project Site and surrounding areas will be established. However, should any 
archaeological remains be found during construction, work will be halted and 
advice sought from the Planning Archaeologist. Where necessary, 
recommendations will be made for a mitigation strategy to preserve in-situ or 
if not practicable to preserve by record any significant archaeological assets. 
The ES will also include a mitigation strategy for any significant impacts to 
listed buildings and other above – ground assets.   
5.10.18 During operation, there may be an opportunity to provide screen planting, 
should the Project give rise to any adverse impacts on above ground 
heritage assets.   
5.11 
Socio-Economics 
Introduction  
5.11.1 An assessment on the effects on socio-economics resulting from the Project 
will be undertaken and reported in the ES. This will consider potentially 
significant impacts and effects caused by the construction, operation and 
decommissioning of the Project on socio-economic resources and receptors 
in and around the vicinity of the Project Site.   
5.11.2 At its peak, the construction and decommissioning phases are expected to 
employ between 150 and 250 personnel. Subject to procurement rules, it is 
anticipated that as much as possible of these workforces would be recruited 
locally.   
Millbrook Environmental Impact Assessment Scoping Report 
 
Doc Ref: Orbis P1078/04/01 Rev 09 
Page No: 60 
 
 
5.11.3 Operation of the Generating Equipment would require up to 15 full time staff 
over the lifetime of the Project working in shifts, which means that less than 
15 people will be on site at any one time during normal operations. In 
addition there would be further indirect jobs for contracted engineering staff 
during regular maintenance shutdowns and maintenance of the Gas and 
Electrical Connections.   
5.11.4 The total capital cost of the Project is anticipated to be in the order of £200 
million. Up to approximately 35% of this will be construction, civil and 
fabrication work which would be open to tender from companies in the area. 
5.11.5 During construction and decommissioning, workers from outside of the local 
area would require places to stay, and regular sustenance, delivering 
benefits to local businesses and services. In addition the Project would also 
represent an additional income source to the local economy during the 
operational phase in terms of local employment and the use of local services 
and suppliers.   
Baseline  
5.11.6 The Rookery and surrounding area has a long history in industry relating to 
the extraction of clay and the production of bricks while to the south of The 
Rookery the area has a long history of agriculture.   
5.11.7 The unitary authority of Central Bedfordshire was formed on 1st April 2009. It 
was created from the merger of Bedfordshire County Council and Mid 
Bedfordshire and South Bedfordshire District Councils. The population in 
2011 was 254,38173. The population in the unitary authority of Bedford 
Borough in 2011 was 157,47974 
5.11.8 In 2011 55% of the total population of Central Bedfordshire and 52% in 
Bedford Borough were in employment compared to 51% for the rest of Great 
Britain75. The key sources of employment in 2011 were76: 
 
Wholesale and retail trade; repair of motor vehicles and motor cycles 
-17% in Central Bedfordshire and Bedford Borough; 
 
Education - 11% in Central Bedfordshire and Bedford Borough; 
 
Manufacturing - 10% in Central Bedfordshire and 8% in Bedford 
Borough; 
 
Construction - 10% in Central Bedfordshire and 8% in Bedford 
Borough; and  
 
Human health - 10% in Central Bedfordshire and 12% in Bedford 
Borough.

5.11.9 There are several visitor or tourist attractions within Central Bedfordshire and 
Bedford Borough including: Center Parcs – Woburn Forest; Dunstable 
Downs; Wardown Park Museum; Woburn Abbey; Woburn Safari Park and 
Whipsnade Zoo.  The nearest attraction is Marston Vale Millennium Country 
Park approximately 50 m to the west of the Project Site.   
Assessment Methodology  
5.11.10 In accordance with NPS EN-1 paragraph 5.12.3 the assessment will 
consider all relevant socio-economic impacts such as tourism, influxes of 
workers, and cumulative impacts.   
5.11.11 There is currently no established EIA methodology for the assessment of 
socio-economic impacts. To assess the socio-economic impacts the 
‘Guidelines and Principles for Social Impact Assessment’ (May 1994) 
produced by the Interorganizational Committee on Guidelines and Principles 
for Social Impact Assessment77 will be used.  
5.11.12 The study area will extend to cover the immediate area of Central 
Bedfordshire and Bedford Borough and the wider area of eastern England, in 
order to assess the likely effects that may be experienced within the local 
community.   
5.11.13 The methodology for the socio-economic impact assessment will be based 
on the collection of a wide range of data and information from published 
materials, plus consultation with the local authority and key stakeholders. 
Key information to be consulted will include:  
 
Population characteristics (population dynamics);  
 
Community and institutional structures (employment, training, skills 
and qualifications, economic investment, business development and 
equal opportunities);  
 
Individual and family changes (perceptions of risk, attitudes towards 
the Project, social well-being); and  
 
Community resources (security, access to local amenities and Public 
Rights of Way (PRoWs)).  
Potential Project Enhancements 
5.11.14 During construction, operation and decommissioning an effort will be made 
to use local goods and services wherever possible.

Summary 
1.1 
Millbrook Power Limited (MPL) is promoting a new thermal generating station (hereafter referred to 
as the ‘Power Generation Plant’) on land within the Rookery Clay Pit County Wildlife Site (CWS) 
between Bedford and Ampthill in Central Bedfordshire, England (approximately grid reference 
501373, 240734).   
1.2 
The Power Generation Plant would operate as a Simple Cycle Gas Turbine (SCGT) peaking plant 
and would be designed to provide an electrical output of up to 299 Megawatts (MW).  It would be 
fuelled by natural gas, supplied by a new underground gas pipeline connecting the thermal 
generating station to the existing National Transmission System (NTS).  
1.3 
The Survey Site (Figures 1a, 1b) for the Project covers an area of approximately 162ha of farmland 
and the southern extent of the Rookery Clay Pit CWS, a disused clay extraction pit (Rookery Clay 
Pit) within the Marston Vale in Bedfordshire. The closest settlements to the Survey Site are 
Stewartby to the north, Marston Moretaine to the west and Millbrook to the south. The Survey Site 
predominantly comprises farmland (arable and improved grassland) but also includes woodland 
parcels, native hedgerows and a number of water-bodies. The north of the Survey Site encroaches 
into the Rookery Clay Pit CWS. 
1.4 
BSG Ecology has been appointed to undertake preliminary ecology survey work for the Survey 
Site, which includes a desk study and Extended Phase 1 Habitat survey. This preliminary 
ecological assessment will inform the subsequent need for further, targeted surveys of protected 
and otherwise notable species and habitats. 
1.5 
The desk study undertaken in support of this assessment identified the presence of seven 
nationally designated Sites of Special Scientific Interest (SSSI) within a 5km radius of the Survey 
Site. The closest of these is Cooper’s Hill SSSI located approximately 550m to the south-east of 
the south-eastern corner of the Survey Site. This site is designated for its extensive heathland 
situated on acidic soil. In addition to this there are two Local Nature Reserves (LNRs) within a 5km 
radius of the Survey Site. The closest of these is Flitwick Wood LNR located approximately 3.3km 
to the south of the Survey Site. This site comprises an area of ancient woodland supporting a 
diverse botanical assemblage.  
1.6 
A total of 12 non-statutory designated CWSs are present within a 2km radius of the Survey Site. 
The closest of these is Rookery Clay Pit CWS, which covers a proportion of the northern extremity 
of the Survey Site. The pit consists of three large pools with sparse ephemeral/short perennial 
vegetation and rank neutral grassland in the north-western corner. 
1.7 
The desk study also highlighted the presence of a number of protected species and species of 
conservation importance within a 2km radius of the Survey Site. These included invertebrates, 
amphibians, reptiles, nesting birds, bats, badgers, water voles, hedgehogs, brown hare and harvest 
mice. All of these species groups may be associated with the habitats found on site. 
1.8 
The extended Phase 1 habitat survey found the Survey Site to predominantly comprise intensively 
managed arable land and improved grassland. Other habitats present included semi-natural 
broadleaved woodland, plantation broadleaved and mixed woodland, standing water, running water 
(ditches), dense continuous scrub, tall ruderal vegetation, semi-improved grassland and species-
poor hedgerows. The habitats present on site have the potential to support roosting, foraging and 
commuting bats, foraging and sheltering badgers, water voles, brown hare, harvest mice, nesting 
birds, foraging and sheltering reptiles, breeding amphibians (including great crested newts) and 
amphibians in their terrestrial phase, and (especially to the periphery) a diverse range of 
invertebrates.  
1.9 
Further consultation is required with the local Statutory Consultees in order to assess the possible 
impacts that the Project could have upon statutory and non-statutory designated sites present in 
the local area, and to agree the exact scope of further survey work. Notwithstanding this, a series 
of recommendations are made, based on likely requirement for surveys of protected and otherwise 
notable species that may be affected by the Project.

It is recommended that target notes and the Phase 1 Habitat map are updated in the summer of 
2014 (June - July) in order to gain a comprehensive botanical species list and allow accurate 
characterisation of the habitats present. 
1.11 
Further survey for the following species - species groups has been recommended in order to obtain 
a robust ecological baseline for the Project Site upon which the impacts of the Project can be 
assessed: 
 
Bats – Ground level tree assessment and external building inspections (of buildings that could 
be affected directly or indirectly by the Project) to search for the potential for and evidence of 
roosting bats. Subsequent dusk emergence / dawn return to roost surveys should roosting 
potential or evidence be found. Bat activity transect surveys should also be undertaken to 
establish the usage of the Survey Site by bats and the relative levels of activity throughout the 
Survey Site. 
 
Badgers – Further detailed investigation of woodlands and hedgerows to search for signs of 
badger activity and active badger setts. 
 
Water voles – A search for signs of water vole activity including burrows, latrines and feeding 
remains within the ditch network and water-bodies present on site; 
 
Birds – A breeding bird survey to determine the assemblage of birds nesting on site in order to 
establish which areas are of most importance to nesting birds. An inspection of the buildings 
(with the potential to be impacted by the Project) present to search for signs of nesting and 
roosting barn owls. 
 
Great crested newts – A survey of all water-bodies on site and within a 250m radius of the 
Survey Site to determine the presence/absence of this species and the population size present. 
 
Reptiles – A survey of all suitable habitat (unmanaged field margins, dense scrub and tall 
ruderal vegetation) to determine the species present and population size. 
 
Invertebrates – Aquatic and terrestrial invertebrate surveys to determine the assemblage of 
scarce and notable species present and to determine which areas of the Survey Site are of 
most importance to these species. If any watercourses are to be lost or should a Water 
Framework Directive compliance assessment be required, aquatic invertebrate surveys may 
also be necessary to determine ecological quality.

Introduction 
Site Description 
2.1 
The Phase 1 Habitat Survey Site (hereafter referred to as the ‘Survey Site’), in which the Project 
would be located, comprises approximately 162 ha of farmland and the southern extent of the 
Rookery Clay Pit County Wildlife Site (CWS) within the Marston Vale in Bedfordshire. The Survey 
Site is centred at National Grid Reference 501373, 240734. The nearest towns/villages are 
Stewartby to the north, Marston Moretaine to the west and Millbrook to the south. 
2.2 
The Survey Site is dominated by arable land and improved grassland for the majority of its extent 
and encroaches into Rookery Pit which is part of the Rookery Clay Pit CWS in the north of the 
Survey Site. Some ecologically valuable habitats are present including parcels of semi-natural 
broadleaved woodland, native hedgerows and a number of water-bodies. The Survey Site is 
bordered by railway lines on its eastern and western boundaries with arable land present to the 
east. The Survey Site boundary is shown on Figure 1.  Photographs of the Survey Site are found in 
Appendix 1.  
Description of Project 
2.3 
MPL is promoting a new thermal generating station (hereafter referred to as the Power Generation 
Plant) within the southern half of the Rookery Clay Pit CWS.  The Power Generation Plant would 
operate as a Simple Cycle Gas Turbine (SCGT) peaking plant and would be designed to provide 
an electrical output of up to 299 Megawatts (MW).  It would be fuelled by natural gas, supplied by a 
new underground gas pipeline connecting the thermal generating station to the existing National 
Transmission System (NTS). The Electrical and Gas Connection routes will extend south from the 
base of the pit, from the Power Generation Plant, into the adjacent arable farmland area close to 
the north of the village of Millbrook.   
2.4 
BSG Ecology has been appointed as the ecological consultant to undertake a preliminary ecology 
survey, which includes a desk study and Extended Phase 1 Habitat Survey. This preliminary 
ecological survey will inform the subsequent need for further, targeted surveys of protected and 
otherwise notable species and habitats. These baseline surveys will be included in an appendix to 
an ecology chapter of an Environmental Statement, which is presently intended for submission, as 
an integral part of the Development Consent Order (DCO) application. 
Aims of Study 
2.5 
BSG Ecology was commissioned to undertake an ecological appraisal of the Survey Site within 
which the Project would be located, comprising a desk study, an extended Phase 1 habitat survey 
and a Habitat Suitability Index (HSI) assessment of nearby water-bodies (within a 250m radius of 
the Survey Site where access allows). The main aims of this report is to: 
a. 
Present the findings of the desk study and site surveys; 
b. 
Assess the potential for the Survey Site to support protected or otherwise notable species; 
c. 
Set out the legislative and/or policy protection afforded to any habitats present or any species 
potentially associated with the Survey Site; and 
d. 
Provide recommendations for any further surveys to inform a subsequent ecology baseline 
chapter.

Methods 
Desk Study 
3.1 
Existing ecological information for the Survey Site and its surrounding area was requested from the 
Bedfordshire and Luton Biodiversity Recording and Monitoring Centre (BRMC). Information on 
statutory designated sites were requested covering the Survey Site and land up to 5km from the 
Survey Site boundary, and information regarding non-statutory designated sites, protected species 
and species of conservation importance were requested covering the Survey Site and land up to 
2km from the Survey Site boundary. In this case, species of conservation importance were defined 
as species listed in accordance with Section 41 of the Natural Environment and Rural Communities 
(NERC) Act. In addition, on-line resources including the Multi Agency Geographic Information for 
the Countryside (MAGIC, www.magic.gov.uk) website and aerial photography of the area were also 
reviewed. 
3.2 
This information was supplemented by previous survey and mitigation work undertaken by BSG 
Ecology on The Rookery Clay Pit CWS including land within and immediately north of the Survey 
Site  (PBA, 2009; BSG Ecology, 2013). 
Field Survey 
3.3 
The field survey was undertaken by Stephen Foot MCIEEM and Dr Jessica Frame MCIEEM on 
25th February 2014. Habitats within the Survey Site were identified and described following 
standard Joint Nature Conservation Committee (JNCC)  Phase 1 habitat survey methodology as 
detailed in the Phase 1 Habitat Survey Handbook (JNCC, 2010). This uses a system of codes to 
describe different habitat types based on the dominant vegetation present, which are recorded 
through the preparation of habitat maps and target notes. All plant names in this report follow The 
New Flora of British Isles (Stace, 2010). 
3.4 
The survey was extended to give particular consideration to the potential of the habitats present to 
support protected species or species of conservation importance which were recorded as incidental 
information as part of the target notes. 
3.5 
It should be noted that species lists derived from the target notes are not necessarily an exhaustive 
inventory of all species occurring at a site. They are intended to illustrate the character of habitats 
present, general species richness of a particular area, and draw attention to any species that may 
be considered uncommon or unusual. 
3.6 
Weather conditions on the day were overcast and showery. This did not impede the survey. 
Habitat Suitability Index (HSI) Assessment for Great Crested Newts 
3.7 
During the field survey a HSI assessment of all ponds / water-bodies within a 250m radius of the 
Survey Site (where access was possible) was undertaken. A 250m search radius was favoured 
over 500m based on a number of factors. Firstly, there are many suitable water-bodies in the 
surrounding landscape (up to 250m from the Survey Site) yet very few beyond this, therefore 
suggesting a lack of connectivity between such ponds (clustering) and limited associated dispersal 
of great crested newts into the wider landscape. Secondly, ponds between 250m to 500m from the 
site are primarily located at the Vehicle Proving Ground, which are surrounded by good terrestrial 
habitat and therefore it is unlikely that great crested newts would be drawn onto the Survey Site to 
use terrestrial features. Thirdly, there is a wealth of extensive existing knowledge of great crested 
newt populations in the local area (to the north of the Survey Site in particular) so there is no 
contextual requirement to gather more detail than necessary concerning likely population status of 
great crested newts in the vicinity of the Survey Site. 
3.8 
Information on the physical features and characteristics of each pond were collected in order to 
allow a great crested newt HSI score to be derived for each pond by applying the scoring system 
developed by Oldham et al. in 2000  and updated by the Herpetological Conservation Trust in 2008 
(HCT, 2008). The Suitability Index is calculated by allocating scores to features associated with 
each pond; these include size, quality of surrounding habitat and presence of fish. These scores 
are then used to calculate the overall HSI for each pond as a number between 0 and 1, with 0 
 
Millbrook Power Project, Bedfordshire

21/03/2014 
being the least suitable and 1 being the most suitable. The HSI score allows each pond to be 
placed in one of five pre-defined categories defining its suitability for great crested newts as 
follows: 
 
<0.5  
= poor 
 
0.5 – 0.59 = below average 
 
0.6 – 0.69 = average 
 
0.7 – 0.79 = good 
 
>0.8 
= excellent 
Limitations to Methods 
3.9 
Although records secured through the desk study and supplied by third parties provide useful 
background information for initial ecological assessment, they often comprise individual records 
supplied by members of the public or are the result of ad hoc surveys. The data trawl information 
can therefore help to inform the likelihood of a particular species being present in the area, but 
should not be relied upon to definitively determine presence or absence of individual species. 
3.10 
The site visit was undertaken at a sub-optimal time of year for a survey of this type (February, 
2014). However, given the location and overall land use across and adjacent to the Survey Site, 
there is no concern with regard to rare habitats or species. Sufficient vegetation, basal rosettes, 
dead flowering parts and leaves were present to identify most of the species present with some 
confidence. In addition, a robust assessment of the Survey Site’s potential to support protected 
species could also be made. Therefore, it is considered that the timing of this survey in this 
instance is not a significant constraint with regard to the findings of this assessment. It will also be 
possible to update the target notes for Extended Phase 1 Habitat survey, as appropriate, as other 
surveys are conducted during more seasonal times of the year.

Results and Interpretation 
4.1 
In this section the results of the desk study and fieldwork are brought together. The implications of 
these results are then considered. 
Designated Sites 
Statutory Designated Sites 
4.2 
There are seven nationally designated Site of Special Scientific Interest (SSSI) located within 5km 
of the Survey Site boundary. The closest of these is Cooper’s Hill SSSI, (grid reference: TL028376) 
which covers an area of 18.06ha and is located approximately 550m to the south-east of the 
Survey Site. This site is designated for its extensive heathland situated on acidic soil. The site also 
contains springs that form wet flushes supporting rich marsh plant communities. A small acidic mire 
(a rare habitat in Bedfordshire) is also present. The site supports a diverse invertebrate fauna.   
4.3 
In addition to this there are also two Local Nature Reserves (LNRs) within a 5km radius of the 
Survey Site. The closest of these is Flitwick Wood LNR located approximately 3.3km to the south 
of the Survey Site. This site comprises an area of ancient woodland supporting a diverse botanical 
assemblage. The remaining statutory designated sites present within a 5km radius of the Survey 
Site are outlined in Table 1 in Appendix 2. The locations of these statutory designated sites are 
shown on Figure 1a and 1b (produced and provided by the BRMC). 
Non-statutory Designated Sites 
4.4 
A total of 12 non-statutory designated County Wildlife Sites (CWSs) are present within a 2km 
radius of the Survey Site. The closest of these is Rookery Clay Pit CWS, which covers a proportion 
of the northern extremity of the Survey Site. The pit consists of three large pools with sparse 
ephemeral/short perennial vegetation and rank neutral grassland in the north-western corner. Small 
patches of marsh vegetation are also present throughout the site. A broadleaved plantation is 
present in the centre of the Rookery Clay Pit CWS.  
4.5 
A single Roadside Nature Reserve (RNR) is also present. Marston Bypass RNR is located 
approximately 2km to the west of the Survey Site and consists of a road verge sown with wildflower 
seeds. The remaining sites are described in Table 2 in Appendix 2 with their locations shown in 
Figure 1b (produced and provided by the BRMC).

4.7 
The distribution of these habitats is shown on Figure 1 with summary descriptions given below. 
Dominant or characteristic flora is described together with notes on the relative abundance of floral 
species within the context of each habitat parcel. Target notes (TNs) referred to in the text below 
and on Figures 2a and 2b are provided in Appendix 3 with photographs provided in Appendix 6. 
Semi-natural broadleaved woodland 
4.8 
Three parcels of semi-natural broadleaved woodland were identified during the field survey. The 
first of these borders the rail corridor adjacent to the southern boundary of the Survey Site (see 
TN1 on Figure 2b). The canopy layer of this woodland parcel is dominated by pedunculate oak 
Quercus robur and poplar Populus sp. The shrub layer is relatively dense and supports abundant 
elder Sambucus nigra and hawthorn Crataegus monogyna with the ground flora supporting 
frequent ivy Hedera helix and lords and ladies Arum maculatum with occasional common nettle 
Urtica dioica. 
4.9 
The second parcel lies to the east of South Pillinge Farm on the western boundary of the Survey 
Site and extends south adjacent to the main road leading into Millbrook (see TN5 and TN6 on 
Figure 2a). This woodland is young / semi-mature in age and the canopy layer of this woodland 
consists of abundant poplar with occasional Lombardy poplar Populus nigra “italica” on the western 
edge. Ash Fraxinus excelsior, Norway maple Acer platanoides, silver birch Betula pendula and rare 
young pedunculate oak are also present within the canopy layer with occasional crack willow Salix 
fragilis adjacent to the ditch on the eastern boundary of this woodland parcel. The shrub layer is 
dense and includes frequent hawthorn with occasional field maple Acer campestre. The ground 
flora of this woodland parcel contains occasional cow parsley Anthriscus sylvestris, common nettle, 
lords and ladies and cleavers Galium aparine. 
4.10 
A third parcel lies in the west of the Survey Site and consists of young and semi-mature 
pedunculate oak with frequent ash. Elder and hawthorn dominate the shrub layer with occasional 
lords and ladies and common nettle present in the ground flora. These areas of woodland do 
display some characteristics of the Habitat of Principal Importance “Lowland mixed deciduous 
woodland”; however, given their age and general structure (e.g. the presence of planted poplar), it 
is unlikely that these woodlands can be classified as this priority habitat type. Despite this, these 
woodland parcels do have intrinsic value and provide habitat for a range of species. 
Plantation Broadleaved Woodland 
4.11 
There are three parcels of plantation broadleaved woodland on site. The first of these is located in 
the north-western corner of the Survey Site adjacent to the Rookery Clay Pit CWS (see TN18 on 
Figure 2a). This semi-mature plantation woodland supports frequent alder Alnus glutinosa and 
silver birch with occasional pedunculate oak in the canopy layer with occasional hazel and 
hawthorn present in the shrub layer. The ground flora within this parcel is sparse (owing to the 
dense canopy layer) and is limited to occasional common nettle and lords and ladies. 
4.12 
The second parcel lies on the western boundary in the southern half of the Survey Site. This young 
woodland parcel contains ash and pedunculate oak in the canopy layer with elder and hawthorn 
scrub present in the shrub layer. Common nettle and lords and ladies are present within the ground 
layer of this parcel. 
4.13 
A third smaller parcel of young woodland lies in the southern half of the Survey Site adjacent to the 
improved grassland fields (see TN4 on Figure 2b). This small wooded copse supports occasional 
poplar, hazel and hawthorn. The ground layer is limited to occasional lords and ladies.

Plantation mixed woodland 
4.14 
A young mixed plantation is present in the centre of the Survey Site (bisecting half of the Survey 
Site from east to west) (see TN8 on Figure 2b and Photograph 8 in Appendix 6). The canopy layer 
of this plantation supports frequent Scot’s pine Pinus sylvestris with pedunculate oak, hazel and 
field maple and occasional beech, silver birch, hawthorn and guelder rose Viburnum opulus. The 
young age of this woodland means that the canopy layer is not too dense, letting in abundant light 
allowing semi-improved grassland to dominate the ground layer. Species present include tall 
fescue Festuca arundinacea, false oat-grass Arrhenatherum elatius and red fescue Festuca rubra. 
Small patches of bramble Rubus fruticosus agg. are also present amongst the sward. 
4.15 
A second, more sparsely planted and younger mixed woodland parcel is present on the western 
Survey Site boundary (see TN10 on Figure 2b). This woodland parcel has a similar vegetative 
composition to the woodland parcel described above. 
Scattered broadleaved trees 
4.16 
A small area in the south-east of the Survey Site to the south-east of Lower Farm comprises 
mature, or potentially veteran, pedunculate oak trees. This area could not be accessed at the time 
of survey; however, it was possible to see from adjacent areas that these mature trees had dead 
wood in the canopy and splits and cracks in the trunk/branches. 
4.17 
A line of scattered planted trees also borders the eastern boundary of South Pillinge Farm in the 
west of the Survey Site. Planted trees present include Lombardy poplar Populus nigra italica, crack 
willow Salix fragilis and pedunculate oak (see TN20 on Figure 2a). 
Dense continuous scrub 
4.18 
Dense bramble scrub lines the north-western boundary of the Survey Site adjacent to the ditch and 
the semi-natural broadleaved woodland. In addition to bramble, occasional cow parsley, willowherb 
(likely Epilobium hirsutum) and hogweed Heracleum sphondylium is also present.  
4.19 
An established/mature area of hawthorn and elder scrub is present on the eastern boundary of the 
Survey Site adjacent to the rail corridor (see TN14 on Figure 2b). This parcel of scrub is very 
dense; however, despite this the ground flora is relatively well established and includes frequent 
ground ivy Glechoma hederacea, cow parsley, common nettle and lords and ladies. This parcel 
thins at its western extent and gives way to sparsely planted ash with a semi-improved grassland 
ground layer (see TN16 on Figure 1 and Photograph 5 in Appendix 6).  
Tall ruderal vegetation 
4.20 
An area of tall ruderal vegetation is present on the western boundary of the Survey Site and 
extends east along a species-poor hedgerow and woodland parcel (see TN12 on Figure 2b and 
Photograph 11 in Appendix 6). This area supports occasional willowherb, hogweed Heracleum 
sphondylium and common nettle, with bramble and common nettle also present. Young ash 
saplings are also interspersed within this area. This area gives way to a crop plant (likely millet) 
used for bird/pheasant cover (see TN13 on Figure 2b). Native species amongst this millet include 
red dead nettle Lamium purpureum and common field speedwell Veronica persica.  
4.21 
Tall ruderal vegetation is also present in the south of the Survey Site, adjacent to a public footpath 
and the rail corridor (see TN2 on Figure 2b). This habitat parcel was dominated by common nettle 
with occasional lords and ladies, bramble and grasses, including common bent Agrostis capillaris 
and tall fescue.  
Tall ruderal vegetation, semi-improved grassland and scattered scrub mosaic 
4.22 
The proposed access track in the north-west of the Survey Site follows an existing bare soil track 
(see TN21 on Figure 1). The edges of this soil track support a mosaic of rabbit grazed semi-
improved grassland, tall ruderal vegetation and scattered hawthorn and bramble scrub. Young 
silver birch trees are present along the lake in the north of the Survey Site. Identification of forbs 
and herbs in the south of this proposed track was difficult at the time of this survey as it is 
understood from the landowner that this area is regularly sprayed with herbicide in order to keep 
vegetation under control in areas previously cleared of great crested newts.

21/03/2014 
Standing water  
4.23 
Seven water-bodies are present on site (Ponds D, E, G, H, I and J). Water-body J was inaccessible 
at the time of survey. Each of these water-bodies is described in Appendix 5 along with other 
water-bodies present within a 250m radius of the Survey Site. 
Running water 
4.24 
A network of wet and dry ditches is present in the northern half of the Survey Site. At the time of 
survey these ranged between 20cm to 50cm in depth, and had a fast flow, potentially due to recent 
heavy rainfall (see TN19 on Figure 2a and Photograph 4 in Appendix 6). Aquatic and marginal 
macrophytes were relatively limited with the majority of these ditches likely to become dry in 
summer / early autumn. The watercourse on the eastern Survey Site boundary supported some 
patches of fool’s watercress Apium nodiflorum. Marginal vegetation was restricted to small patches 
of pond sedge Carex riparia adjacent to hawthorn and elder scrub on the eastern site boundary 
(see TN15 on Figure 2b). Slower sections of this ditch network had become dominated by common 
duckweed Lemna minor. The ditch on the western boundary also supported small patches of fool’s 
watercress (see TN9 on Figure 1). 
Arable 
4.25 
The majority of the Survey Site consists of arable land. At the time of survey only one of the fields 
was planted with a crop, this being a species of cabbage Brassica sp. The remaining arable fields 
were ploughed in preparation for sowing later in the year. 
Improved grassland 
4.26 
Several fields in the north of the Survey Site comprised a grass ley dominated by perennial rye-
grass Lolium perenne; rare instances of read dead nettle and bristly ox-tongue Helminthotheca 
echioides were present amongst the sward (see Photograph 3 in Appendix 6). 
4.27 
The fields in the south of the Survey Site were also improved grassland and were intensively 
grazed by sheep, horses and alpaca (see TN3 on Figure 2b and Photograph 1 in Appendix 6). 
These fields were dominated by perennial rye-grass with occasional common bent and Yorkshire 
fog Holcus lanatus. Forbs and herbs are limited within the sward with only creeping buttercup 
Ranunculus repens present. 
Semi-improved neutral grassland 
4.28 
Small pockets of semi-improved grassland were identified in the south of the Survey Site and along 
the field margins/hedgerow bases across the Survey Site. Strips of semi-improved grassland are 
also present along the rail corridor. These unmanaged margins range between 0.5m and 1m in 
width. False-oat grass, perennial rye-grass and common bent dominate the sward with occasional 
creeping buttercup, bramble and common nettle. 
Amenity grassland 
4.29 
Small amenity grassland lawns are present within the gardens of Lower Farm. These lawns are 
also dominated by perennial rye-grass with occasional creeping buttercup, daisy Bellis perennis 
and white clover Trifolium repens. 
Species-poor hedgerow 
4.30 
The majority of hedgerows on site are intensively managed (approximately 2m in height and 1m in 
width) and dominated by hawthorn with occasional dog rose Rosa canina, bramble and ivy (see 
Photograph 7 on Figure 1). Ground flora associated with these hedgerows is limited to common 
nettle, ivy and lords and ladies. 
4.31 
A small number of hedgerows are unmanaged and are up to 3m in height (see TN7 on Figure 2b). 
These have a similar vegetative composition though wild privet and field maple were recorded in 
hedgerows in the south and east of the Survey Site. All native hedgerows on site are classified as 
Habitats of Principal Importance.

Buildings 
4.32 
There are a number of farm buildings associated with Lower House Farm and Ossory Farm within 
the boundary of the Survey Site. It was not possible to gain access to these buildings at the time of 
survey.  
Other habitats 
4.33 
Other habitats of limited ecological significance within the Survey Site included hard-standing 
(roads, pedestrian access and car-parking areas) associated with Lower Farm and fences present 
throughout the Survey Site. 
4.34 
The south-western corner of the Rookery Clay Pit CWS (in the northern extremity of the Survey 
Site) has been recently cleared of vegetation and re-graded. It now consists of bare clay soil (see 
Photograph 2 in Appendix 6). 
4.35 
No invasive, non-native species listed on Schedule 9, Part II of the Wildlife and Countryside Act 
1981 (as amended) were recorded during the survey. 
Protected Species and Species of Conservation Importance 
4.36 
Records of 213 protected species and species of conservation importance (species of principal 
importance) from within a 2km search area were supplied by BRMC. The results of the desk study 
are summarised in Table 3 in Appendix 2. Please note that records dated pre-2003 have been 
excluded as over 10 years has now passed, making this data less relevant. In addition to this, 
where a species has been recorded multiple times, only the most recent and closest record to the 
Survey Site has been included. 
4.37 
This section presents evidence of protected species or species of conservation importance 
identified during the survey. Where relevant, it also evaluates the potential for the Survey Site to 
support species of principal importance identified within the desk study area (see Table 3 Appendix 
2) and summarises previous survey work undertaken at The Rookery Clay Pit CWS by BSG 
Ecology in 2008 and 2009. As appropriate, the relevant legislation and policy for each species or 
species group is also briefly summarised below with detailed legislation and policy information 
presented in Appendix 4. 
Bats 
4.38 
In 2008, BSG Ecology undertook activity surveys, building and tree inspections surveys and dusk 
emergence/dawn return to roost surveys for bats at The Rookery Clay Pit CWS and the 
surrounding area (PBA, 2009).  The activity surveys recorded an assemblage of eight species of 
bat foraging and/or commuting within and around the northern half of the Rookery Clay Pit CWS. 
These species included common pipistrelle Pipistrellus pipistrellus, soprano pipistrelle Pipistrellus 
pygmaeus and Nathusius’ pipistrelle Pipistrellus nathusii; noctule Nyctalus noctula; serotine 
Eptesicus serotinus; barbastelle Barbastella barbastellus; Leisler’s bats Nyctalus leisleri and a 
Myotis spp. Buildings at South Pillinge Farm were also assessed to determine the 
presence/absence of roosting bats. 
4.39 
Of the 20 buildings that were surveyed, five were found to contain evidence of the presence of 
bats. The farmhouse was found to support a brown long eared Plecotus auritus roost in the loft. A 
small number of bats were seen during the survey, and droppings were found that were thought to 
be from this species only (PBA, 2008). 
4.40 
The desk study also provided records of nine species of bats from within a 2km radius of the 
Survey Site. The closest of these were a noctule bat found on a tree 150m to the west of the 
Survey Site in 2012 and a Daubenton’s bat Myotis daubentonii from 300m to the west in 2009. 
4.41 
A number of mature trees are present within hedgerows on the periphery of the Survey Site with a 
number of mature oaks also present in the south of the Survey Site. Some of these trees had 
features (cracks in the bark, splits in the trunk/branches and rot holes and woodpecker holes) that 
have the potential to provide roosting opportunities for bats. In addition to this, the buildings at 
Lower Farm are also likely to provide roosting opportunities for bats.

4.42 
The arable and improved grassland habitats covering the majority of the Survey Site are 
considered to provide limited foraging opportunities for bats; however, the hedgerows, woodland 
and ditches are likely to provide a suitable commuting and foraging resource for bats in the wider 
landscape.  
4.43 
The presence of bats on site is a material consideration in the planning process, as both bats and 
their roosts are afforded protection under the Conservation of Species and Habitats Regulations 
2010 (as amended) and the Wildlife and Countryside Act 1981 (as amended). In broad terms these 
pieces of legislation jointly mean that the animals themselves are protected against killing, injury, 
taking (capture) and disturbance. In addition, their places of shelter are protected against damage, 
destruction and obstruction. Several species of bat (including the brown long-eared bat) are also 
classified as Species of Principal Importance (SPIs) in England, drawn up on a list in response to 
the requirements of Section 41 of the Natural Environment and Rural Communities Act, 2006 (see 
Appendix 4). 
Badger 
4.44 
BSG Ecology undertook dedicated badger surveys in September 2008 (PBA, 2009). These surveys 
identified the presence of badger latrines within The Rookery Clay Pit CWS; however, no signs of 
badger setts were identified. 
4.45 
A foraging badger was also note within scrub between the northern and southern halves of the 
Rookery Clay Pit CWS approximately 500m to the east of the proposed access track, during great 
crested newt surveys of Rookery North Pit in 2013 (BSG Ecology, 2013). Woodland copses, scrub 
and hedgerows are preferred locations for setts as they allow badgers to emerge from the setts 
inconspicuously and young cubs to play near the sett entrances without being visible to potential 
predators and people (Neal & Cheeseman, 1996). The badger’s preferred food source is the 
earthworm Lumbricus terrestris and therefore they predominantly forage on areas of grassland and 
pasture. Badgers are omnivorous and they supplement their diet with carrion and fruits from 
hedgerows, trees and shrubs (Neal & Cheeseman, 1995; Roper, 2010). A badger sett comprising 
5-6 well-used entrances was identified during this survey within a small woodland copse 
approximately 190m to the east of the Survey Site boundary (grid reference: TL022395). The semi-
natural broadleaved woodland, plantation broadleaved woodland, plantation mixed woodland, 
dense scrub, tall ruderal vegetation and established/unmanaged hedgerows have the potential to 
provide suitable sett building habitat and optimal foraging habitat for badgers. The improved 
grassland, grass ley and arable habitats are likely to provide moderate quality foraging habitat for 
this species. 
4.46 
The possible presence of badgers on site is a material consideration as both badgers and their 
setts are protected under the Protection of Badgers Act 1992 making the intentional or reckless 
destruction, damage or obstruction of a badger sett an offence (see Appendix 4). 
Brown hare 
4.47 
Three brown hare Lepus europaeus were recorded on site during the field survey. This species is 
common and widespread in the UK where they are most common in arable areas where cereal 
growing predominates. Survival of leverets (their young) is higher in mixed agricultural areas than 
in cereal monocultures. In mixed farming, brown hares prefer cattle-grazed pasture and fallow for 
both feeding and resting. The species typically avoids sheep pasture, except in winter, and they 
prefer fields supporting strips of uncultivated land (Harris & Yalden, 2008). Hares typically select 
lying-up sites in habitats where there is minimal disturbance from livestock. Given the lack of 
livestock in the northern half of the Survey Site, it is considered that these arable areas are of 
higher value to this species.  
4.48 
The brown hare is classified as an SPI and therefore the potential presence of this species on site 
is a material consideration in the planning process (see Appendix 4). 
Hedgehog 
4.49 
The closest record of a hedgehog Erinaceus europaeus provided in the results of the desk study 
was approximately 190m to the west of the Survey Site. Hedgehogs are found in most lowland 
habitats but have a preference for grassland in close proximity to woodland, scrub or hedgerows 
(Harris & Yalden, 2008). This species predates upon slugs, snails, insects and amphibians. The 
 
Millbrook Power Project, Bedfordshire 
 
13 
21/03/2014 
woodland, hedgerows, dense scrub and tall ruderal vegetation on site have the potential to provide 
foraging and sheltering habitat for this species. 
4.50 
The hedgehog is classified as an SPI and therefore the potential presence of this species on site is 
a material consideration in the planning process (see Appendix 4). 
Harvest mouse 
4.51 
The harvest mouse Micromys minutus favours areas of tall, dense grassy vegetation with breeding 
nests often constructed in cereal crops, long grass, reed beds, rushes and bramble patches (Harris 
& Yalden, 2008). Some of the denser marginal vegetation adjacent to the proposed access track, 
the field margins and within the understorey of the plantation mixed woodland in the centre of the 
Survey Site has the potential to support this species. This species was identified in the north of the 
Survey Site during clearance of the arable/ruderal habitats in autumn 2012 as part of the great 
crested newt licence works. 
4.52 
This species is classified as an SPI in England and as such its presence on site would be a 
material consideration in making a planning determination (see Appendix 4). 
Otter 
4.53 
During surveys undertaken in 2008 a single otter Lutra lutra print was recorded on a clay bank in 
the south-east of the Rookery Clay Pit CWS (PBA, 2009). No other evidence of otter activity was 
recorded during the survey. The large water-body in the north of the Rookery Clay Pit CWS 
(adjacent to the proposed access) supports a healthy fish population and it is likely that otters 
regularly use this water-body and the adjacent Stewartby Lake CWS as a foraging resource. 
However, it is considered that there is limited connectivity with the habitat in the south of the 
Survey Site. There are also few foraging opportunities to the south and the Survey Site supports 
generally intensively managed habitats with few places that otters could use as resting sites. For 
these reasons it is considered that this species is unlikely to be present on site and so will not be 
considered further in this assessment. 
Water vole 
4.54 
The survey carried out by BSG Ecology in October 2008 identified the presence of a water vole 
Arvicola amphibius latrine, a large feeding cache and several runs (PBA, 2009). These signs were 
found on the northern fringe of the largest waterbody in the Rookery Clay Pit CWS and provide 
direct evidence of water voles using the Survey Site. No signs of water vole activity were found 
during a subsequent survey carried out in May 2009 (PBA, 2009).  During this survey, areas of 
vegetation were located that had been disturbed by wildfowl, in particular geese, and deer.  There 
were also frequent signs of fox activity and possible signs of mink presence. The closest most 
recent record of this species in the desk study was from 1.5km to the north of the site in 2012.  
4.55 
This species is usually found within 2m of the water’s edge, along the densely vegetated banks of 
ditches, river, streams and marshes where it feeds on grasses, reeds and sedges (Harris & Yalden, 
2008; Strachan et al., 2011). The ditch network in the northern and western part of the Survey Site 
has some potential to be used by water voles. 
4.56 
Water voles and their breeding and resting habitats receive protection under the Wildlife and 
Countryside Act, 1981 (as amended). Water voles are also classified as a Species of Principal 
Importance in England (see Appendix 4 for further information). 
 Breeding birds 
4.57 
A total of 26 species of bird were incidentally recorded on site during the extended Phase 1 habitat 
survey (see Table 1 for a list of these species).

conservation priority, with species needing urgent action. Amber is the next most critical group, followed by green [RSPB, 
2013]). 
4.58 
The woodland parcels, species-poor hedgerows and associated trees and improved 
grassland/arable land are likely to provide good quality nesting habitat for these and other common 
species of breeding birds. 
4.59 
The potential for the Survey Site to support birds is a material consideration, as all wild birds, their 
nests and eggs receive protection under the Wildlife and Countryside Act 1981 (as amended) in 
respect of intentional killing and injury or damage and destruction of active nests (see Appendix 4). 
Schedule 1 Bird Species 
4.60 
Records of 31 species of Schedule 1 birds have been recorded from within a 2km radius of the 
Survey Site (see italicised birds in Table 3 in Appendix 2). These species receive additional 
protection under Schedule 1 of the Wildlife and Countryside Act, 1981 (as amended) which 
prohibits disturbance of individuals or their dependent young at or near an active nest site (see 
Appendix 4). Of these 31 species the following 11 species have potential to be associated with the 
Survey Site as suitable nesting habitat is present:  
 
Barn owl Tyto alba – This species tends to forage upon tussocky grassland with a good litter 
layer providing habitat for their preferred prey species (field voles) (Barn Owl Trust, 2012). The 
 
Millbrook Power Project, Bedfordshire 
 
15 
21/03/2014 
semi-improved grassland and tall ruderal vegetation mosaic on the periphery of the Survey Site 
is therefore considered to provide some foraging habitat for barn owls. In addition, it is possible 
that some of the outbuildings associated with Lower Farm could support this species.   
 
Bittern Botaurus stellari – Bitterns have been recorded within the reedbed in the lake in the 
north of the Rookery Clay Pit CWS (adjacent to the proposed access track). The dense 
reedbed on the periphery of the lake in the north of the Rookery Clay Pit CWS (adjacent to the 
proposed access track) continues to provide suitable nesting and foraging habitat for this 
species. 
 
Bearded tit Panurus biarmicus – The bearded tit is found almost exclusively within dense 
reedbeds (Holden & Cleeves, 2002). The dense reedbed on the periphery of the lake in north 
of the Rookery Clay Pit CWS (adjacent to the proposed access track) provides suitable nesting 
and foraging habitat for this species.  
 
Cetti’s warbler Cettia cetti – This species nests in dense scrub and reedbed habitats (Holden & 
Cleeves, 2002). This species was recorded within reed habitat adjacent to the proposed 
access track in January 2014. 
 
Firecrest Regulus ignicapillus – This species breeds in very small numbers in the south-east of 
England (80-250 breeding males) (RSPB, 2013). Despite being a rare British breeding species, 
the conifers and semi-natural broadleaved woodland on site is considered to offer limited 
potential nesting and foraging habitat for firecrest.  
 
Garganey Anas querquedula – This species of duck nests in dense vegetation including 
reedbed. Suitable nesting habitat for this species is therefore also present within the dense 
reedbed on the periphery of the lake in north of the Rookery Clay Pit CWS. 
 
Hobby Falco subbuteo – This species has been observed foraging over the water-bodies within 
the Rookery Clay Pit CWS during great crested newt translocation works in 2011 and 2013. 
The mature trees in the semi-natural broadleaved and plantation woodland present on site 
have some potential to be used as nesting habitat for this spring/summer migrant. 
 
Little-ringed plover Charadrius dubius – This species breeds on man-made habitats close to 
fresh water. Sand and gravel quarries are regularly used as breeding sites (Holden & Cleeves, 
2002). This species was recorded nesting on site in 2011 and 2013 upon clay habitats adjacent 
to the water-bodies in the Rookery Clay Pit CWS. Accordingly, there remains suitable habitat 
for this species to the north of the Survey Site.  
 
Mediterranean gull Larus melanocephalus – This species is known to breed near inland lakes 
and wetlands (Holden & Cleeves, 2002). The waterbodies in the Rookery Clay Pit CWS 
provide suitable nesting habitat for this species.  
 
Marsh harrier Circus aeruginosus – This species nests in dense reedbed and has been 
recorded foraging over the reedbed present in the northern and south-eastern areas of the 
Rookery Clay Pit CWS in 2011 and 2013.  
 
Red kite Milvus milvus – This species was recorded circling above the Survey Site during the 
field survey. The mature trees in the semi-natural broadleaved woodland and plantation 
woodland present on site have potential to be used as nesting habitat for this species. 
Birds of Conservation Importance 
4.61 
A number of bird Species of Principal Importance (SPI’s) were shown to be present within 2km of 
the site in the results of the desk study (see Table 2 in Appendix 2). Of the species recorded in the 
desk study and on site during the field survey dunnock Prunella modularis, house sparrow Passer 
domesticus, starling Sturnus vulgaris, reed bunting Emberiza schoeniculus, skylark Alauda 
arvensis, song thrush Turdus philomelos, bullfinch Pyrrhula pyrrhula, yellowhammer Emberiza 
citronella, cuckoo Cuculus canorus and yellow wagtail Motacilla flava flavissima could potentially 
nest on site as suitable habitat is present for these species. The presence of these species is a 
 
Millbrook Power Project, Bedfordshire 
 
16 
21/03/2014 
material consideration in the planning process; however, these species receive no specific legal 
protection over and above the general protection given to all birds by the Wildlife and Countryside 
Act, 1981 (as amended). 
Great crested newt 
4.62 
Surveys for great crested newt Triturus cristatus were undertaken in and around the Rookery Clay 
Pit CWS in 2008 (PBA, 2009). The presence of a large population of great crested newts was 
subsequently confirmed during these surveys. Trapping and translocation of newts has since taken 
place under a mitigation licence issued by Natural England in 2011. This has affected the southern 
half of the Rookery Clay Pit CWS incorporating the southern portion of the proposed access track 
and a proportion of the arable land in the north of the Survey Site, and has yielded a total of 5,513 
great crested newts to date, which were subsequently moved to receptor areas in the north of the 
Rookery Clay Pit CWS (400m east of the proposed access track) and a receptor area named 
Stewartby Way 2 (SW2) to the east of the rail corridor. At the present time, the translocation 
programme is continuing in the south of the Rookery Clay Pit CWS and is expected to be 
completed in the summer of 2014.   
4.63 
An examination of on-line aerial photography prior to the site visit identified a total of 14 ponds 
within 250m of the boundary of the Survey Site. The results of the HSI assessment for these 14 
ponds (including their overall great crested newt suitability class) are given in full within Table 1 in 
Appendix 5. Of the ponds surveyed, one (Pond M) was classified as having excellent suitability, 
three (Ponds A, I and K) were classified as having good suitability, one pond was classified as 
having average suitability (Pond H), three ponds were assigned below average suitability (Pond C, 
Pond E and Pond L) and two ponds were assigned poor suitability (Ponds G and N) to support 
great crested newts. Three ponds (Ponds B, D and F) were dry or not present at the time of survey 
and are therefore considered unsuitable to support breeding great crested newts. It was not 
possible to access Pond J at the time of the survey. The locations and HSI scores attributed to 
these ponds are shown on Figure 3. A full description of each of the ponds is also included in 
Appendix 5. 
4.64 
Great crested newts spend a proportion of the year in aquatic habitats where they breed. The 
remainder of the year is spent foraging and sheltering in terrestrial habitats including woodland, 
scrub and rough grassland (Inns, 2009). The Survey Site supports at least four water-bodies that 
could be used by great crested newts as breeding habitat (Ponds E, H, I and L). The majority of the 
Survey Site does not support suitable terrestrial habitat for this species, being intensively 
managed/grazed grassland and arable land offering limited sheltering opportunities. However, it is 
likely that the hedgerows on the field boundaries, patches of tall ruderal vegetation and scrub and 
woodland would be used as a sheltering, foraging and dispersal resource for great crested newts if 
present. The rail ballast and rubble habitats in the north of the Survey Site adjacent to the rail 
corridor and the proposed access track are also considered to provide suitable sheltering and over-
wintering habitat for this species. 
4.65 
Great crested newt is listed as European Protected Species (EPS) under Schedule 2 of The 
Conservation of Habitats and Species Regulations 2010 (as amended). It is also protected under 
the Wildlife and Countryside Act 1981 (as amended).  In summary, these pieces of legislation 
combined make it an offence to disturb, capture, injure or kill a great crested newt or damage or 
destroy its habitat.  The great crested newt is also identified as an SPI (see Appendix 4). 
Common toad 
4.66 
Common toads Bufo bufo spend a larger portion of their time in terrestrial habitats (dense 
vegetation and beneath rocks and logs) than common frogs Rana temporaria (Inns, 2009). 
Common toads shelter during the day within dense scrub or beneath stones and fallen logs, and 
emerge at night to forage on slugs and other invertebrates. The closest record of a common toad in 
the desk study was 1.9km to the west of the Survey Site. However, large numbers of toads were 
recorded within The Rookery Clay Pit CWS during the translocation of great crested newts to the 
northern half of the Rookery Clay Pit CWS and SW2 (BSG Ecology, 2013). The hedgerows, ruderal 
vegetation, scrub and woodlands are likely to provide foraging and sheltering habitat for this 
species, particularly given the presence of suitable water-bodies on site and in the surrounding 
landscape. Common toads are classified as an SPI (see Appendix 4).  
 
Millbrook Power Project, Bedfordshire

21/03/2014 
Reptiles 
4.67 
A low population of grass snakes Natrix natrix and a medium population of common lizards 
Zootoca vivipara were translocated during the clearance works associated with the southern half of 
the Rookery Clay Pit CWS. These were subsequently moved to suitable habitats within the north of 
the Rookery Clay Pit CWS. 
4.68 
Reptiles prefer a mosaic of habitats with a varied vegetation structure providing conditions suitable 
for both sheltering and foraging (Edgar et al., 2010). The Survey Site predominantly consists of 
intensively grazed/managed improved grassland and arable land offering limited sheltering or 
foraging habitat for reptiles. However, the field margins (particularly in the north of the Survey Site), 
semi-improved grassland within the plantation mixed woodland and peripheral scrub and ruderal 
habitats are likely to provide suitable habitat for these species.   
4.69 
All species of common reptile are protected from killing and injury under the Wildlife and 
Countryside Act, 1981 (as amended). Reptiles are also classified as SPIs (see Appendix 4). 
Invertebrates 
4.70 
An invertebrate scoping survey followed by nine site visits to collect invertebrates was undertaken 
by BSG Ecology during the summer of 2008 (PBA, 2009). This suite of surveys identified 483 
species of invertebrates within Rookery Clay Pit CWS, some of which were of conservation 
importance. Three species were classified as SPIs; the small heath Coenonympha pamphilus, 
shaded broad-bar moth Scotopteryx chenopodiata and cinnabar moth Tyria jacobaeae. A total of 
44 of the species recorded were classified as Red Data book or nationally scarce species. 
Aquatic Invertebrates 
4.71 
No aquatic invertebrates were provided in the results of the desk study. However, it is possible that 
scarce or notable species are present in the ditch network in the north of the site or within water-
bodies present on site. 
Terrestrial Invertebrates 
4.72 
The desk study results provided records of four species of butterfly. These included the small 
heath, dingy skipper Erynnis tages, the wall Lasiommata megera and the grizzled skipper Pyrgus 
malvae. All four of these species were recorded within The Rookery Clay Pit CWS, principally on 
the bank tops were forb and herb species are more prevalent. 
4.73 
In addition, records of 34 species of moth were provided in the results of the desk study. The 
majority of these species were either recorded on site or within a 200m radius of the Survey Site. 
These species are generally common and widespread in the south and east of England and feed 
on a range of shrubs, trees and herbaceous plants. It is possible that these species are present on 
or utilise certain parts of the Survey Site (especially the more naturally vegetated peripheral areas) 
given the vegetation present (UK Moth website, 2013). These species of butterfly and moth are all 
classified as SPI’s1. The presence of these species on a site may be a material consideration in the 
planning process (see Appendix 4). 
                                                      
Please note that the cinnabar moth is not listed as an SPI for its conservation importance.

Recommendations 
5.1 
It is assumed that direct impacts will potentially occur across the Survey Site during construction, 
operation and decommissioning of the Power Generation Plant in the Rookery Clay Pit CWS and 
associated electrical and gas infrastructure to the south. Indirect impacts will need to be considered 
beyond this, within the ‘zone of influence’ that will vary dependent on the receptor (e.g. habitat, 
protected species, designated site) concerned. The recommendations presented below are based 
on this understanding of potential impacts and the corresponding requirement to confirm presence / 
absence, and where present, the distribution and abundance of protected and otherwise notable 
species, or coverage of habitats that may occur within the Project Site and a zone of influence 
surrounding it. 
Statutory Designated Sites 
5.2 
There are no statutory designated sites of international ecological importance (SPA or SAC) within 
5km of the Project Site. 
5.3 
Consultation with the Statutory Consulteesand Natural England will determine the requirement for a 
screening exercise (under the Habitat Regulations) that considers the proximity of potentially 
sensitive ecological receptors (notably Natura 2000 sites, but potentially extended to SSSIs) within 
a search area that may extend to or beyond a 5km radius of the Project Site, and whether these 
could be affected by NOx, NO2 and CO emissions as well as nitrogen and acid deposition. 
5.4 
The requirement for further surveys or desk based investigation will be determined following review 
of the scoping opinion (and consultation) with the Statutory Consultees on this matter. 
Non-statutory Designated Sites 
5.5 
The proposed access track runs inside the western boundary of the Rookery Pit CWS. The interest 
features of this site include the water-bodies and mosaic of ephemeral/short perennial vegetation, 
rank neutral grassland and marsh vegetation. The access track currently comprises bare ground 
(used as a temporary access track), scattered scrub and ephemeral vegetation. Direct effects on 
the interest features of this CWS are therefore predicted to be limited. However, this will need to be 
fully discussed with the Statutory Consultees, including consideration of potential indirect effects. 
Habitats 
5.6 
The habitats present within the Survey Site but outside of the Rookery Clay Pit CWS are generally 
common and widespread and intensively managed (improved grassland and arable land). The 
native hedgerows present throughout the Survey Site are Habitats of Principal Importance (HPIs). 
The extended Phase 1 habitat survey was undertaken at a sub-optimal time of year, and so did not 
allow a robust assessment of the botanical species present to be conducted. It is therefore 
recommended that target notes and the Phase 1 Habitat map are updated in the summer (June - 
July) in order to gain a comprehensive species list and allow accurate characterisation of the 
habitats present. This will allow a more robust assessment of possible impacts on habitats and 
botanical species to be completed. 
Protected Species and Species of Conservation Importance 
Bats 
5.7 
It is important that the use of the Survey Site by bats is fully understood in order to accurately 
determine any possible adverse impact that the Project may have on this species group. The 
following surveys are recommended in order to ascertain this: 
Ground Level Tree Assessment and External and Internal Building Inspection Surveys 
5.8 
The Survey Site contains a number of trees and some parcels of woodland. It is recommended that 
trees within the Survey Site (that are to be affected by the Project) are inspected for signs/features 
with the potential to support roosting bats. In line with the Bat Conservation Trust guidance (Hundt, 
 
Millbrook Power Project, Bedfordshire 
 
19 
21/03/2014 
2012) this survey should be conducted between February and April, when trees are not in leaf, 
although, in practice, this survey can be undertaken year round. 
5.9 
All buildings to be directly or indirectly affected by the Project (if any) should be inspected for signs 
of roosting bats and features with the potential to support roosting bats. 
5.10 
If signs of roosting bats or features with the potential to be used by roosting bats are identified 
during these inspection surveys, further surveys in the form of dusk emergence/ dawn re-entry 
surveys may be required. The level of survey effort required will depend on the potential that the 
building or tree has been assigned in these initial inspection surveys. These further surveys (if 
required) should be undertaken in accordance with current best practice guidance (Hundt, 2012) 
when bats are most active (i.e. between mid-May and August inclusive). 
Bat Activity Surveys and Automated Static Detector Surveys 
5.11 
It is advised that activity surveys are undertaken in order to determine the species of bats present 
on the Survey Site as well as the spatial distribution and relative activity levels of these species. 
This will include assessment of seasonal and nocturnal patterns of behaviour, and the extent to 
which activity changes over time. In accordance with Hundt (2012) for a large site of low to 
moderate suitability, two line transects should be conducted in spring, summer and autumn. These 
transects should commence a quarter of an hour before sunset and continue for 2 to 3 hours after 
sunset.  Automated surveys using static bat detectors should also be undertaken at two locations 
(one location per transect route). In line with the current best practice guidance these detectors 
should be left in-situ for three consecutive nights per season i.e. spring, summer and autumn.  
Badger 
5.12 
The Survey Site has the potential to provide foraging and sheltering habitat for badgers (a legally 
protected species). Badgers are also known to be present in the wider landscape following an 
appraisal of the desk study results and the field survey. It is therefore recommended that all 
potential habitats within the Survey Site are surveyed to search for and record characteristic signs 
of badger activity, including: setts, latrine pits, foraging holes, badger hair and paw prints following 
best practice guidance (Neal and Cheesman, 1996). Potential habitat includes areas of woodland, 
scrub and hedgerows. It is recommended that these surveys are undertaken between February 
and May or October to November, when badger activity is high and vegetation cover is low. 
However, in practice, this survey can be undertaken all year round. 
Water vole  
5.13 
Water voles have been recorded in the Marston Vale. Approximately 3,000m of ditch exists across 
the Survey Site along with a number of smaller water-bodies/ponds, which should be surveyed for 
field signs indicating the presence water voles (a legally protected species, see Appendix 4). These 
surveys will conform to standard methodologies for water vole (Strachan et al., 2011) and will be 
carried out when this species is likely to be active. Signs of water vole presence are indicated by 
the presence of feeding remains, characteristic grass lawns, burrows, runs, footprints, latrines and 
droppings. This survey can be undertaken all year round but March to early May and September to 
October is optimal, when bankside vegetation is at its least dense and these animals are highly 
active.  
Other mammals 
5.14 
The desk study and previous survey work has highlighted the presence of a number of mammals 
classified as SPIs (brown hare, hedgehog and harvest mouse). Additional incidental evidence of 
these species will be recorded during targeted survey effort for other species to be undertaken on 
site. 
Breeding birds 
5.15 
Much of the land within and adjoining the Survey Site is managed as arable farmland, with pasture 
further south. As such, farmland birds (occurring both within the Survey Site and a buffer of up to 
50m) would be the main target of the survey. The other main area of bird interest is the large water-
body present in the northern half of the Rookery Clay Pit CWS adjacent to the proposed access 
track. This lake is known to support a number of Schedule 1 bird species and species of

conservation importance (SPIs). The breeding bird survey will follow standard guidance as set out 
by Bibby et al. (2000) and Gilbert et al. (1998). This type of survey would likely comprise three 
visits to the Survey Site, spread over the period March to July (with April, May and June being the 
key months for survey). One dusk survey visit to cover crepuscular species such as barn owl 
should also be undertaken.  
Barn owls 
5.16 
It is recommended that where access allows, the farm buildings at Lower Farm and South Pillinge 
Farm, and mature trees on site are surveyed for the presence of roosting/nesting barn owls. Signs 
to be searched for include: nest debris, barn owl pellets, white splashes from barn owl droppings 
and live or dead barn owls themselves (Barn Owl Trust, 2012). Barn owl roost inspections can be 
conducted all year round. 
Great crested newt 
5.17 
A large size-class population of great crested newts exist within The Rookery Clay Pit CWS (BSG 
Ecology, 2013). The newts within the southern half of the Rookery Clay Pit CWS are presently 
being translocated to a receptor area in the northern half of the CWS and to the east of this in 
SW2.  
5.18 
Given that sufficient information exists on the great crested newts population of The Rookery Clay 
Pits CWS, no further survey of this population is likely to be required (this will need to be verified in 
consultation with the LPA ecologist). However, following the results of the HSI survey 10 suitable 
ponds exist outside of The Rookery Clay Pit CWS, and a baseline survey of these will be required. 
It is recommended that all ponds assessed as being below average or above in the HSI 
assessment (i.e. Ponds A, C, E, H, I, K, L and M– see Table 1 in Appendix 5) and Pond J where 
access was not secured for this survey, are re-surveyed in order to determine the current status of 
great crested newts within the Survey Site.  All ponds identified are within 250m of the Survey Site. 
It is appropriate to justify selecting ponds at this distance (rather than up to 500m), which is as 
follows: 
5.19 
Section 5.4 of the Great Crested Newt Mitigation Guidelines (English Nature, 2001) recommends 
that: 
“For a common situation, where a plot of land containing a pond is proposed for development, the 
pond itself should be surveyed, and other ponds up to 500m away should also be checked, if it is 
thought likely that great crested newt populations centred on these ponds would be affected by 
changes to the plot.” 
5.20 
English Nature guidance (2001) is further developed in the great crested newt Method Statement 
which states that:  
‘The decision on whether to survey depends primarily on how likely it is that the development would 
affect newts using those ponds. For developments resulting in permanent or temporary habitat loss 
at distances over 250m from the nearest pond, carefully consider whether a survey is 
appropriate… normally appropriate only when all of the following conditions are met: 
1. 
maps, aerial photos, walk-over surveys or other data indicate that the pond(s) has potential to 
support a large great crested newt population,  
2. 
the footprint contains particularly favourable habitat, especially if it constitutes the majority available 
locally,  
3. 
the development would have a substantial negative effect on that habitat, and 
4. 
there is an absence of dispersal barriers.’ 
5.21 
This second piece of guidance, which supersedes the first, specifies that all four conditions should 
be met for surveys to be required of ponds beyond 250m of the Survey Site boundary.  In this case, 
condition 1 is met as a large population of great crested newts exists to the north of the Survey Site 
(The Rookery Clay Pit CWS). However, the Survey Site comprises mostly arable and improved 
grassland that is of low value for great crested newts, so condition 2 cannot be met. Conditions 3

21 
21/03/2014 
and 4 are consequently irrelevant, and it is possible to prescribe surveys of ponds within 250m (not 
250m – 500m). 
5.22 
Following the Great Crested Newt Mitigation Guidelines (English Nature, 2001), four survey visits 
should be undertaken at each pond (where access allows) to determine presence or absence. Two 
further visits (i.e. six in total) are then to be completed at ponds found to contain great crested 
newts, to enable a population size class to be estimated. The surveys normally consist of bottle 
trapping, torch searches, egg searches and netting. These surveys should be carried out from mid-
March to mid-June, with at least half of the visits between mid-April and mid-May. 
Reptiles 
5.23 
Grass snakes and common (viviparous) lizards have been recorded adjacent to the Survey Site 
within The Rookery Clay Pit CWS, and are likely to be present within the Survey Site (PBA, 2009; 
BSG Ecology, 2013). Where field boundary margins, grassland and scrub within the Survey Site 
have the potential to support reptiles, a survey will be conducted in order to determine their 
presence/likely absence.  
5.24 
This further survey will entail installing a number of artificial refugia (squares of roofing felt or tin) in 
areas of suitable habitat, including scattered scrub, tall ruderal vegetation and coarse grassland, at 
a minimum density of 5-10 per hectare. These refugia will then be checked on a minimum of seven 
occasions during the optimal period, which is between April and September, during suitable 
weather conditions to allow an estimate of population size to be made. The refugia will be left in-
situ for a minimum of two weeks prior to the first survey visit to allow the refugia to “bed down” in 
accordance with the Herpetofauna Worker’s Manual (JNCC, 2003) and Reptile Survey Guidance 
(Froglife, 1999). 
Invertebrates 
Aquatic Invertebrates 
5.25 
In order to determine the assemblage of aquatic invertebrates present on site, it is recommended 
that the following protocol be followed: 
Survey of watercourses (flowing ditches) 
5.26 
On the assumption that watercourses will be affected by the Project, it may be appropriate to 
undertake an assessment of water quality, compliant with the Water Framework Directive (WFD).  
One of the main aims of the WFD is to prevent deterioration in the status of aquatic ecosystems, 
protect them and improve the ecological condition of waters. The requirement for such an 
assessment would be driven in consultation with the Environment Agency. Should such an 
assessment be required, it may be appropriate to assess the ecological quality and surface water 
chemistry of watercourses to be affected. 
5.27 
To determine ecological quality, kick-sampling for aquatic invertebrates should be undertaken at 
selected locations along the ditch / stream, and the Biological Monitoring Working Party (BMWP) 
score applied to inform an assessment of water quality and species present. This survey is best 
undertaken in spring and in the autumn in swift flowing waters, or in summer in stationary ditches 
or those with a slow flow. All macro-invertebrates should be identified to species level in order to 
determine the presence of any scarce or nationally notable species. 
5.28 
To determine water chemistry status a single water sample should be extracted at three locations; 
within the Survey Site and upstream and downstream of this. Samples should be dispatched to a 
UKAS accredited laboratory for subsequent analysis, to cover a standard range of parameters 
including: Biological Dissolved Oxygen, total suspended solids, nutrient composition (e.g. nitrite as 
nitrogen, total oxidised nitrogen, total ammoniacal nitrogen, total phosphorus), hardness, calcium, 
alkalinity, conductivity and pH. 
5.29 
The condition of the watercourse can subsequently be analysed by recording and comparing the 
aggregated number of taxa, and average score per taxon from the sampling points along the 
watercourse within, upstream and downstream from the site. The statistical model (River 
Invertebrate Classification Tool - RICT) developed for WFD classification would be used to 
calculate the Ecological Quality Ratio (EQR) that compares observed with expected results for a 
 
Millbrook Power Project, Bedfordshire 
 
22 
21/03/2014 
watercourse of the same type. The EQR is then used to identify the Biological Status of the 
watercourse which is separated into five bands (Bad to High) required by the WFD. 
Survey of waterbodies (ponds) 
5.30 
The National Pond Monitoring Survey protocol should be adhered to which follows the standard 
method for the survey of ponds for aquatic invertebrates (and flora), developed by the Freshwater 
Habitats Trust (formerly Pond Conservation/Pond Action), which can be adapted for determination 
of Priority Ponds. This survey involves timed netting and searches for invertebrates in summer (but 
may also cover spring and autumn). All macro-invertebrates are identified to species level in order 
to determine the presence of any scarce or nationally notable species. Predictive System for 
Multimetrics (PSYM) application developed by the Freshwater Habitats Trust is used to assess the 
overall condition of the pond in terms of its ecological quality. This survey protocol is a standard 
requirement to inform whether a pond meets the criteria as being a habitat of principal importance, 
based on its aquatic invertebrate assemblage. It can also be used to establish whether any species 
of principal importance, nationally scarce, Red Data Book or WCA Schedule 5 species are present. 
Terrestrial Invertebrates 
5.31 
The desk study and previous survey work have revealed a large number of moth and butterfly 
(Lepidoptera) records, of SPIs. Suitable habitats for these species exist within the Survey Site and 
adjacent to it, with woodland and woodland edge being a prominent feature that may be used by a 
range of Lepidoptera. Terrestrial invertebrate survey is therefore proposed that targets Lepidoptera. 
5.32 
A further survey is also appropriate that targets another important group of invertebrates; beetles 
(Coleoptera). Whilst not featuring in the desk study, the phase 1 habitat survey uncovered a 
suitable range of habitats (woodland, mature / veteran trees, hedgerows and ditch banks) in which 
this group of invertebrates may be strongly represented, especially in the wooded habitats, both 
within and adjoining the Survey Site. 
5.33 
Survey of Lepidoptera should involve two night-time moth surveys to be undertaken in late spring 
and mid-summer. Trapping using Skinner moth traps fitted with mercury vapour bulbs is most 
suitable in terms of attracting an extensive and variable moth fauna. Lights should be switched on 
at dusk and remain lit until dawn the following day.  The traps should be checked periodically 
throughout the night to log any new arrivals.  Any species hard to identify from external markings 
alone, and those requiring further confirmation, should be retained and dissected if necessary to 
ascertain their identity with the use of a stereoscopic microscope. 
5.34 
Allied with this, a butterfly transect walk of the Survey Site should be conducted. As with the moths, 
two of these should be undertaken, in late spring and mid-summer. This transect will be undertaken 
in accordance with standard guidance developed by the UK Butterfly Monitoring Scheme. 
5.35 
For beetles, a method should be developed that follows Natural England (ISIS) protocol (Drake et 
al., 2007) to sample beetle assemblages directed at woodland habitats, via hand searches, sweep 
netting and pitfall trapping. To align with the Lepidoptera surveys, this can be undertaken in late 
spring and mid-summer. Subsequent laboratory identification will be required for many of the 
specimens collected. 
5.36 
Analysis of the results should use the ISIS protocol to determine whether any broad or specialist 
assemblage types present of Lepidoptera and / or Coleoptera. Consideration should also be given 
to any rare, scarce or nationally threatened species present, including SPIs.

TL028376 
This site lies approximately 550m to the south 
east of the Survey Site. Cooper’s Hill consists of 
extensive heathland situated on acidic soil. 
Springs are present and form wet flushes 
supporting rich marsh plant communities. A 
small acidic mire (a rare habitat type in 
Bedfordshire is also present). Two areas of 
woodland have developed on the marshy areas 
adding to the biodiversity value of the site. The 
site supports a diverse invertebrate fauna.

This CWS covers the northern portion of land 
within the Survey Site. The pit consists of three 
large 
pools 
with 
sparse

sided 
lake 
supporting 
typical 
marshland 
communities on its periphery. The clay areas in 
the south-west of the support an MG1 grassland 
community that includes species associated 
with calcareous soils. A survey in 2004 found 
the grassland to most closely resemble a CG7d 
community (Fragaria-Erigeron sub-community) 
with affinities to MG5 grassland. There are 
marshy areas interspersed within the grassland 
along with small ponds and ditches. The 
northeast side of the lake mostly consists of 
dense hawthorn scrub with a regularly mown 
path through it. The site supports a diverse 
assemblage of breeding and overwintering 
birds.

Appendix 3: Target Notes 
Target Note 1 
The rail embankment on the southern boundary of the Survey Site supports a parcel of mature-
semi-mature semi-natural broadleaved woodland. This area has the potential to be used by 
badgers for sett building, as possible terrestrial habitat for great crested newts as possible roosting, 
foraging and commuting habitat for bats and as nesting habitat for birds. 
 
Target Note 2 
A mosaic of tall ruderal vegetation and poor semi-improved grassland borders the footpath in the 
south-eastern corner of the Survey Site. This habitat has the potential to provide foraging and 
sheltering habitat for reptiles. 
e 
 
Target Note 3 
The majority of the south of the Survey Site consists of intensively managed/grazed improved 
grassland pasture. This pasture has limited species diversity being dominated by perennial rye-
grass Lolium perenne with frequent Yorkshire fog Holcus lanatus and occasional common bent. 
Forbs and herbs are sparse amongst the sward with only creeping buttercup Ranunculus repens 
present.   
Target Note 4 
A small parcel of young, plantation broadleaved woodland located in the south-eastern corner of 
the Survey Site. This area is likely to provide nesting habitat for birds and has the potential to 
provide foraging and sheltering habitat for badgers and foraging and commuting habitat for bats.

Target Note 5 
A semi-mature copse of semi-natural broadleaved woodland is located on the western boundary of 
the Survey Site to the south of South Pillinge Farm. This area of woodland has the potential to be 
used as sheltering habitat by badgers, foraging, commuting and roosting habitat for bats and as 
nesting habitat by birds.

Target Note 6 
This woodland parcel continues south along the western boundary of the Survey Site where it 
borders the road. This area is likely to be used as a foraging and commuting resource by bats 
present in the wider landscape. 
Target Note 7 
This woodland eventually narrows to form a species-poor hedgerow approximately 3m in height. 
This hedgerow is dominated by hawthorn with occasional dog rose Rosa canina. Lords and ladies 
and common nettle are present in the ground flora associated with this feature.  
Target Note 8 
An area of young plantation mixed woodland is present in the centre of the Survey Site and bisects 
the Survey Site from east to west. This area is likely to provide nesting habitat for birds and the 
dense grassland ground layer has the potential to provide sheltering and foraging habitat for 
reptiles. The trees are young.

Note 9 
A wet ditch comprising open areas with limited macrophyte cover, including fool’s water cress 
Apium nodiflorum. This ditch has some potential to support water voles. 
Target Note 10 
A sparsely planted area of mixed plantation woodland. The low intensity planting has allowed areas 
of semi-improved grassland to mature providing possible habitat for reptiles. The vegetative 
composition of this area is similar to that described in Target Note 8 above. 
Target Note 11 
A parcel of semi-natural broadleaved woodland. This woodland parcel has the potential to provide 
foraging habitat for badgers and nesting habitat for birds.

Target Note 12 
An area of tall ruderal vegetation, approximately 5m in width, forms a buffer between this woodland 
parcel and the adjacent arable field. This area supports frequent common nettle Urtica dioica, 
willowherb (likely Epilobium hirsutum), hogweed Heracleum sphondylium and cow parsley 
Anthriscus sylvestris. This area becomes increasingly dominated by bramble Rubus fruticosus agg. 
and a number of very young ash Fraxinus excelsior tree saplings further to the south. This habitat 
mosaic is considered to have good potential to support reptiles (common lizard in particular). 
Target Note 13 
An arable crop (likely millet) that has been left uncut in order to provide cover for game birds (e.g. 
pheasants and partridges). A small number of herbs and forbs associated with arable habitat are 
present within this area including red dead nettle Lamium purpureum and common field speedwell 
Veronica persica. 
Target Note 14 
An area of mature, dense scrub dominated by elder Sambucus nigra and hawthorn Crataegus 
monogyna. Ground flora associated with this parcel included lords and ladies Arum maculatum, 
common nettle Urtica dioica and occasional ground ivy Glechoma herderacea and cleavers Galium 
aparine. This area is likely to be used by badgers as sheltering/sett building habitat.  
Target Note 15 
A shallow wet ditch. It is likely that this ditch is only holding water at present as a result of the 
recent heavy rain. There is very limited vegetation growth within the ditch and as a result it is 
considered to have limited potential to support water voles. 
Target Note 16

Target Note 19 
A wet ditch supporting high water levels, potentially due to recent heavy rainfall. This ditch supports 
a number of ruderal species including creeping thistle Cirsium arvense and willowherb Epilobium 
sp. This ditch is likely to dry out annually. 
Target Note 20 
The ditch adjacent to South Pillinge Farm is lined with a number of planted trees that may be used 
as a commuting feature by bats. These include Lombardy poplar Populus nigra italica, crack willow 
Salix fragilis and hawthorn Crataegus monogyna. 
Target Note 21 
The access track in the north of the Survey Site consists of a mosaic of bare ground (soil), rubble 
(rail ballast) tall ruderal vegetation, rabbit grazed grassland and scattered hawthorn Crataegus 
monogyna and bramble Rubus fructicosus agg. scrub. This area has the potential to provide 
foraging and sheltering habitats for great crested newts and reptiles.

Appendix 4: Summaries of Relevant Legislation, Policy and Other 
Instruments 
10.1 
This section briefly summarises the relevant legislation, policy and related issues that are 
mentioned in the main text of the report. The following text does not constitute legal advice. 
National Planning Policy Framework 
10.2 
The government published the National Planning Policy Framework (NPPF) on 27th March 2012. 
The NPPF states that, “the planning system should contribute to and enhance the natural and local 
environment by: 
e. 
Protecting and enhancing valued landscapes, geological conservation interests and soils; 
f. 
Recognising the wider benefits of ecosystem services; 
g. 
Minimising impacts on biodiversity and providing net gains in biodiversity, where possible 
contributing to the Government’s commitment to halt the overall decline in biodiversity, 
including by establishing coherent ecological networks that are more resilient to current and 
future pressures; 
h. 
Preventing both new and existing development from contributing to or being put at 
unacceptable risk from, or being adversely affected by unacceptable levels of soil, air, water or 
noise pollution or land instability; and 
i. 
Remediating and mitigating despoiled, degraded, derelict, contaminated and unstable land, 
where appropriate.” 
Planning – land allocation and policies 
10.3 
The NPPF indicates that ‘in preparing plans to meet development needs, the aim should be to 
minimise pollution and other adverse effects on the local and natural environment. Plans should 
allocate land with the least environmental or amenity value, where consistent with other policies in 
this Framework.’ 
10.4 
In paragraph 111, the NPPF refers to brownfield land as follows: ‘planning policies and decisions 
should encourage the effective use of land by re-using land that has been previously developed 
(brownfield land), provided that it is not of high environmental value.’ 
10.5 
Local planning authorities are advised in paragraph 113 to ‘set criteria-based policies against which 
proposals for any development on or affecting protected wildlife or geodiversity sites or landscape 
areas will be judged. Distinctions should be made between the hierarchy of international, national 
and locally designated sites so that protection is commensurate with their status and gives 
appropriate weight to their importance and the contribution that they make to wider ecological 
networks.’ 
10.6 
Local planning authorities are advised further to ‘set out a strategic approach in their Local Plans, 
planning positively for the creation, protection, enhancement and management of networks of 
biodiversity and green infrastructure…’ 
10.7 
The NPPF also states that, “to minimise impacts on biodiversity and geodiversity, planning policies 
should: 
a. 
Plan for biodiversity at a landscape-scale across local authority boundaries; 
b. 
Identify and map components of the local ecological networks, including the hierarchy of 
international, national and locally designated sites of importance for biodiversity, wildlife 
corridors and stepping stones that connect them and areas identified by local partnerships for 
habitat restoration or creation; 
c. 
Promote the preservation, restoration and re-creation of priority habitats, ecological networks 
and the protection and recovery of priority species populations, linked to national and local 
targets; and identify suitable indicators for monitoring biodiversity in the plan; 
d. 
Aim to prevent harm to geological conservation interests; and 
 
Millbrook Power Project, Bedfordshire 
 
 
45 
21/03/2014 
e. 
Where Nature Improvement Areas are identified in Local Plans, consider specifying the types 
of development that may be appropriate in these Areas.” 
Planning applications and biodiversity 
10.8 
“When determining planning applications, local planning authorities should aim to conserve and 
enhance biodiversity by applying the following principles: 
a. 
If significant harm resulting from a development cannot be avoided (through locating on an 
alternative site with less harmful impacts), adequately mitigated, or, as a last resort, 
compensated for, then planning permission should be refused; 
b. 
Proposed development on land within or outside a Site of Special Scientific Interest likely to 
have an adverse effect on a Site of Special Scientific Interest (either individually or in 
combination with other developments) should not normally be permitted. Where an adverse 
effect on the site’s notified special interest features is likely, an exception should only be made 
where the benefits of the development, at this site clearly outweigh both the impacts that it is 
likely to have on the features of the site that make it of special scientific interest and any 
broader impacts on the national network of Sites of Special Scientific Interest; 
c. 
Development proposals where the primary objective is to conserve or enhance biodiversity 
should be permitted; 
d. 
Opportunities to incorporate biodiversity in and around developments should be encouraged; 
10.9 
In paragraph 125 the NPPF stipulates that ‘by encouraging good design, planning policies and 
decisions should limit the impact of light pollution from artificial light on local amenity, intrinsically 
dark landscapes and nature conservation.’ 
10.10 
The Government Circular 06/2005 remains valid and Paragraph 99 provides guidance stating “It is 
essential that the presence or otherwise of protected species, and the extent that they may be 
affected by the proposed development, is established before the planning permission is granted, 
otherwise all relevant material considerations may not have been addressed in making the 
decision”.  
Species and Habitats of Principal Importance 
10.11 
The NPPF (paragraph 117) indicates that local authorities should take measures to “promote the 
preservation, restoration and re-creation of priority habitats, ecological networks and the protection 
and recovery of priority species” linking to national and local targets through local planning policies. 
Priority species are those species shown on the England Biodiversity List published by the 
Secretary of State in accordance with Section 41 of the Natural Environment and Rural 
Communities (NERC) Act 2006. Planning authorities have a duty under Section 40 of the NERC 
Act to have regard to priority species and habitats in exercising their functions including 
development control and planning.  
The Central Bedfordshire Borough Council Core Strategy 
10.12 
The Core Strategy was adopted in 2009 and supersedes the mid Bedfordshire Local Plan. The 
relevant planning policy in relation to ecology and biodiversity within this document is Policy CS18. 
Policy CS16 – Landscape and Woodland 
10.13 
This policy states that, “The Council will: 
 
Protect, conserve and enhance the Chilterns Area of Outstanding Natural Beauty; 
 
Conserve and enhance the varied countryside character and local distinctiveness in 
accordance with the findings of the Mid Bedfordshire Landscape Character Assessment; 
 
Resist development where it will have an adverse effect on important landscape features or 
highly sensitive landscapes; 
 
Require development to enhance landscapes of lesser quality in accordance with the 
Landscape Character Assessment; 
 
Millbrook Power Project, Bedfordshire 
 
 
46 
21/03/2014 
 
Continue to support the creation of the Forest of Marston Vale recognising the need to 
regenerate the environmentally damaged landscape through woodland creation to achieve the 
target of 30% woodland cover in the Forest area by 2030; 
 
Conserve woodlands including ancient and semi-natural woodland, hedgerows and veteran 
trees; and 
 
Promote an increase in tree cover outside of the Forest of Marston Vale, where it would not 
threaten other valuable habitats”. 
 
Policy CS18: Biodiversity and Geological Conservation 
10.14 
This policy states that, “The Council will: 
 
Support the designation, management, and protection of biodiversity and geology including 
national designations (SSSI’s), locally important County Wildlife Sites (CWS’s) and Regionally 
Important Geological and Geomorphological Sites (RIGGS); as well as those local priority 
habitats and species identified in the Local Biodiversity Action Plan. 
 
Support the maintenance and enhancement of habitats, identify opportunities to create buffer 
zones and restore and repair fragmented and isolated habitats to form biodiversity networks.  
10.15 
Development that would fragment or prejudice the biodiversity network will not be permitted. 
 
European Legislation and National Legislation 
European protected species –Great crested newts, Bats and Otters 
10.16 
The Conservation of Habitats and Species Regulations 2010 (as amended) consolidates the 
various amendments that have been made to the Regulations. The original (1994) Regulations 
transposed the EC Habitats Directive on the Conservation of Natural Habitats and of Wild Fauna 
and Flora (Council Directive 92/43/EEC) into national law. 
10.17 
“European protected species” (EPS) are those which are present on Schedule 2 of the 
Conservation of Habitats and Species Regulations 2010. They are subject to the provisions of 
Regulation 41 of those Regulations. All EPS are also protected under the Wildlife and Countryside 
Act 1981 (as amended). Taken together, these pieces of legislation make it an offence to: 
a. 
Intentionally or deliberately capture, injure or kill any wild animal included amongst these 
species 
b. 
Possess or control any live or dead specimens or any part of, or anything derived from a these 
species 
c. 
deliberately disturb wild animals of any such species 
d. 
deliberately take or destroy the eggs of such an animal, or 
e. 
intentionally, deliberately or recklessly damage or destroy a breeding site or resting place of 
such an animal, or obstruct access to such a place 
10.18 
For the purposes of paragraph (c), disturbance of animals includes in particular any disturbance 
which is likely— 
a. 
to impair their ability— 
i. 
to survive, to breed or reproduce, or to rear or nurture their young, or 
ii. 
in the case of animals of a hibernating or migratory species, to hibernate or migrate; or 
b. 
to affect significantly the local distribution or abundance of the species to which they belong. 
10.19 
Although the law provides strict protection to these species, it also allows this protection to be set 
aside (derogation) through the issuing of licences. The licences in England are currently 
 
Millbrook Power Project, Bedfordshire

21/03/2014 
determined by Natural England (NE) for development works. In accordance with the requirements 
of the Regulations (2010), a licence can only be issued where the following requirements are 
satisfied: 
c. 
The proposal is necessary ‘to preserve public health or public safety or other imperative 
reasons of overriding public interest including those of a social or economic nature and 
beneficial consequences of primary importance for the environment’ 
d. 
‘There is no satisfactory alternative’ 
e. 
The proposals ‘will not be detrimental to the maintenance of the population of the species 
concerned at a favourable conservation status in their natural range’.  
Breeding birds 
10.20 
All nesting birds are protected under the Wildlife and Countryside Act 1981 (as amended) which 
makes it an offence to intentionally kill, injure or take any wild bird or take, damage or destroy its 
nest whilst in use or being built, or take or destroy its eggs.  
Schedule 1 Bird Species 
10.21 
Bird species listed on Schedule 1 of the WCA (e.g. barn owl and black redstart) receive additional 
protection from disturbance at or near an occupied nest site. Schedule 1 of the Act makes it an 
offence to intentionally or recklessly disturb this species while it is building a nest or is in, on or 
near a nest containing eggs or young. It also makes it an offence to intentionally or recklessly 
disturb dependent young of this species. 
Common Reptiles 
10.22 
The common, widespread species of reptile (slow worm, grass snake, adder and common lizard) 
are protected through Sections 9(1) and 9(5) of the Wildlife and Countryside Act 1981 as amended 
by the Countryside and Rights of Way Act 2000, making it an offence to: 
 
Intentionally or recklessly kill or injure any reptile; or 
 
Sell, offer for sale, possess or transport for the purchase of sale or publish advertisements to 
buy or sell any reptile. 
10.23 
Reptiles across the UK have undergone significant declines in recent years and all species of 
reptile within the UK are now included on the list of species of principal importance prepared in 
response to Section 41 of the Natural Environment and Rural Communities (NERC) Act, 2006. This 
legislation placed a duty on the Secretary of State to publish, review and revise lists of living 
organisms in England that are of principal importance for the purpose of conserving biodiversity. 
The NERC Act also required the Secretary of State to take, and promote the taking of, steps to 
further the conservation of the listed organism. 
Badgers 
10.24 
Badgers are protected under the Protection of Badgers Act 1992. This makes it an offence to 
wilfully kill, injure, take, possess or cruelly ill-treat a badger, or to attempt to do so; or to 
intentionally or recklessly interfere with a sett. Sett interference includes disturbing badgers whilst 
they are occupying a sett, as well as damaging or destroying a sett or obstructing access to it. A 
licence can be granted by Natural England to permit works that would otherwise result in an 
offence (e.g. to allow sett closure where activities close by may otherwise result in disturbance or 
damage to the sett). 
Water Voles 
10.25 
The water vole and its habitats are protected by the Wildlife and Countryside Act 1981 (as 
amended).  This makes it an offence to intentionally or recklessly: 
 
Kill, injure or take water voles; 
 
Possess or control live or dead water voles; 
 
Millbrook Power Project, Bedfordshire

 
Damage, destroy or obstruct access to any shelter or place which water voles uses for shelter 
or protection; or 
 
Disturb water voles while they are using such a place.

Addendum to Millbrook Power Project Ecological Appraisal; 
Ecological Walkover Report 
Introduction 
This addendum report supplements the Millbrook Power Project Ecological Appraisal Report. An 
Ecological Walkover Survey has been undertaken following adjustments to the extent of the Survey 
Site for the Project. This has now been extended to include a large, triangular-shaped parcel of land to 
the east of the original Survey Site (east of the Marston Vale railway line), that accommodates two 
Gas Connection Route Corridor options. This ‘Eastern Area’ is located largely between Millbrook Road 
the B530 and the railway corridor (Marston Vale Line). The habitats across this area will be accurately 
mapped during the Phase 2 (targeted) ecological surveys that are programmed to commence in April 
2014. However, the Ecological Walkover Report was conducted to inform the potential requirement for 
targeted ecological surveys across this area, and also to inform the scoping report. 
Methods 
An ecological walkover survey of the Eastern Area, comprising the two Gas Connection Route 
Corridor options, was carried out on 27 March 2014 by John Baker MCIEEM.  Although a complete 
extended Phase 1 habitat survey was not carried out in this instance, notes were made on the habitats 
present across this area and their suitability to support protected species to obtain a baseline of the 
conditions at this time and to ascertain what further surveys, if any, would be necessary.  In order to 
assess the area’s potential to support great crested newts, six ponds were identified prior to the site 
visit.  These were then subject to survey on the day, to gather the necessary information to carry out a 
Habitat Suitability Index (HSI) assessment.  This is a measure of a given water-bodies suitability to 
support great crested newt, although local information and professional judgement would ultimately be 
used to scope a pond in or out from further surveys. 
Site Description and Habitats 
The area surveyed is dominated by intensively managed arable land, separated by hedgerows under 
regular maintenance and in the main, associated with a ditch or drain. The field margins, which abut 
hedgerow bases and ditch banks, vary in width, from narrow (1 m wide), through to fairly wide (6 m) in 
some parts of the Eastern Area. The margins are generally composed of rough grassland with a mix of 
tall ruderal species. 
The hedgerows primarily comprise hawthorn, although field maple, willow, ash, blackthorn, dog rose 
and bramble are also present in some sections. The hedgerow ground flora is generally species poor 
with no evidence (at this time of the year) of any woodland plants. 
A main ditch running north through the centre of the Eastern Area held a small amount of water with a 
steady flow at the time of the survey, with minor ditches feeding into this, most of which were dry. A 
ditch to the east of the area surveyed (parallel to the B530) has recently been re-profiled and dredged 
mechanically and essentially consists of bare soil on the banks. 
To the south of the Eastern Area is a linear plantation belt, that borders the main ditch running north 
through the survey area. This plantation belt is well-established but recent, comprising species such 
as oak, ash, sycamore, hazel and pine. Some of the hazel along the eastern side of the plantation has 
been recently coppiced, although overall the woodland supports little understorey (other than limited 
bramble scrub along part of its western boundary) and a sparse ground flora. 
Six ponds of varying size and nature are present within or close to the Eastern Area. These have been 
assigned a reference number (see Addendum Figure 1). Ponds 3, 5 and 6 were medium-sized water-
bodies within an arable field, surrounded by some retained, uncultivated rough grassland margins, 
although poorly connected to suitable habitat further afield. Pond 2 is a recently dug water-body within 
a rough grassland and young plantation woodland area. Pond 1 is a small but deep pond which is

heavily shaded with some rough grassland and ruderal margins on its banks. Pond 4 is the largest 
water-body examined, with a narrow band of established woodland on its southern and eastern sides. 
Potential for protected species and species of conservation importance 
Bats. Very few established trees are present within hedgerows within the Eastern Area, and those that 
are present are fairly young and therefore of limited value to roosting bats. Roosting bats are therefore 
unlikely to be a consideration in any development affecting the Eastern Area. The hedgerows and 
ditches that are present may be of value to foraging and commuting bats. However, since the majority 
of work likely to take place in the Eastern Area will be temporary and along a relatively narrow corridor, 
it is unlikely to be detrimental to bats and is therefore unlikely to trigger the need for any bat activity 
surveys. 
Badger. The Eastern Area has a similar range of habitats to those identified in the Ecology Appraisal 
Report. This includes hedgerow and ditch banks that may provide foraging and sheltering habitat for 
badgers as well as opportunities for sett building. It is therefore advised that the badger survey 
recommended in the Ecology Appraisal Report is extended to include the Eastern Area. 
Water Vole. No signs of water vole were noted during this initial visit, although a formal survey was not 
carried out. Approximately 1,200 m of ditch exists across the Eastern Area together with a number of 
smaller water-bodies/ponds. The ditches that hold water and support good vegetation along their 
banks have the potential to support water vole. In common with the recommendations of the Ecology 
Appraisal Report, these should be surveyed for field signs indicating the presence water voles. 
Otters. Otters may opportunistically use the ditches for commuting and dispersal to and from other 
habitats in the wider area and for occasional foraging. Occasional use by this species of the ponds 
connected to ditch systems may also occur. Accordingly, whilst survey for water vole is undertaken, 
this should also be mindful of the potential presence of otter and therefore look for evidence of this 
species as well. 
Breeding Birds. Much of the land within and adjoining the Eastern Area is managed as arable 
farmland, but with boundary features (and other features) of interest to birds, such as ponds, ditches, 
hedgerows and plantation woodland. These habitats are likely to support a range of typical farmland 
birds, and as such, farmland birds (occurring both within the Eastern Area and a buffer of up to 50 m) 
would be the main target of a breeding bird survey. The survey should also include a dusk visit to 
cover crepuscular species such as barn owl. 
Great Crested Newt. All ponds were subject to a HSI assessment. The results of the HSI assessment 
are presented in Table 1 below, which should be viewed alongside Addendum Figure 1 (Pond 
Locations).

As can be seen from Table 1 above, and given the local context, none of these ponds can realistically 
be scoped out from further survey for great crested newts since all ponds (with the exception of Pond 
2) had an ‘Average’ score or better, and all are within 250 m of the Eastern Area. Consistent with the 
recommendations of the Ecology Appraisal Report, these ponds should be surveyed during the current 
survey season (mid-March to mid-June) to determine presence/absence in these ponds and to assess 
the size of the population. 
Three further pools in the form of short, shallow sections of ditch with stationary water were present 
along the Millbrook Road. These held small amounts of water (maximum depth of 1”) and are likely to 
dry regularly so do not need to be considered further. 
Reptiles. Field margins, including hedge and ditch banks are generally vegetated with rough grassland 
and tall ruderal vegetation. Patchy scrub is also present, especially close to the plantation belt. These 
habitats may support reptiles. Accordingly, the reptile survey recommended in the Ecology Appraisal 
Report should be extended to include the Eastern Area, in order to determine their presence/likely 
absence of reptiles. 
Other Species. In terms of Species of Principal Importance discussed in the Ecology Appraisal Report, 
the following bullet points consider these further: 
 two brown hare were noted in fields in the Eastern Area; 
 hedgehogs may be present along field margins, in hedgerows and denser areas of the 
plantation woodland; and 
 harvest mice may also potentially use the field margins and the areas of winter cereals in 
the arable fields, once the crop has become more established. 
Additional incidental evidence of these species will be recorded during targeted survey effort for other 
species to be undertaken in the Eastern Area. 
With the exception of a narrow plantation belt, woodland and woodland edge habitats are virtually 
absent in the Eastern Area. As such it is not appropriate to survey the site for the range of 
invertebrates identified during the desk study in the Ecology Appraisal Report. The ponds within the 
Eastern Area may support important assemblages of aquatic invertebrates. However the requirement 
to undertake detailed survey of these (as described for ponds west of the railway line in the Ecology 
Appraisal Report) would be dictated by the proximity of impacts affecting these ponds either directly or 
indirectly.

EXECUTIVE SUMMARY 
This is the Scoping Opinion (‘the Opinion’) provided by the Secretary of 
State (‘SoS’) in respect of the content of the Environmental Statement for 
the Millbrook Power Project (‘the Project’) at ‘The Rookery’, near 
Stewartby, Bedfordshire. The proposal is for a new power generation plant 
in the form of a Simple Cycle Gas Turbine (SCGT) gas fired peaking power 
generating station fuelled by natural gas and capable of providing an 
electrical capacity of up to 299 megawatts (MW).  
This report sets out the Secretary of State’s opinion on the basis of the 
information provided in the report by Millbrook Power Limited (‘the 
applicant’) entitled ‘Millbrook Power Project Environmental Impact 
Assessment Scoping Report - June 2014’ (‘the Scoping Report’). This 
Opinion can only reflect the proposals as currently described by the 
applicant.  
The Secretary of State has consulted on the Scoping Report and the 
responses received have been taken into account in adopting this Opinion. 
The Secretary of State is not satisfied that the topic areas identified in the 
Scoping Report encompass those matters identified in Schedule 4, Part 1, 
paragraph 19 of the Infrastructure Planning (Environmental Impact 
Assessment) Regulations 2009 (as amended) (‘the EIA Regulations’).  The 
Secretary of State recommends that the environmental statement should 
also cover potential impacts caused by the removal and disposal of waste, 
and 
by 
electric 
and 
magnetic 
fields 
associated 
with 
electricity 
transmission. 
The Secretary of State draws attention both to the general points and 
those made in respect of each of the specialist topic areas in this Opinion. 
The main potential issues identified are:  
 
Air quality 
 
Noise and vibration 
 
Ecology 
 
Water quality and resources 
 
Geology, ground conditions and land use 
 
Landscape and visual 
 
Traffic and transport 
 
Cultural heritage and archaeology 
Matters are not scoped out unless specifically addressed and justified by 
the applicant, and confirmed as being scoped out by the Secretary of 
State. 
The Secretary of State notes the potential need to carry out an 
assessment under the Habitats Regulations1.

Scoping Opinion for Millbrook Power Project 
 
1 
1.0 INTRODUCTION 
Background 
1.1 
On 20 June 2014 the SoS received a scoping report submitted by 
Millbrook Power Limited under Regulation 8 of the EIA Regulations 
in order to request a scoping opinion for the proposed Millbrook 
Power Project. This Opinion is adopted in response to this request 
and should be read in conjunction with the applicant’s Scoping 
Report. 
1.2 
The applicant has formally provided notification under Regulation 
6(1) (b) of the EIA Regulations that it proposes to provide an ES in 
respect of the proposed development. Therefore, in accordance 
with Regulation 4(2) (a) of the EIA Regulations, the proposed 
development is determined to be EIA development. 
1.3 
The EIA Regulations enable an applicant, before making an 
application for an order granting development consent, to ask the 
SoS to state in writing their formal opinion (a ‘scoping opinion’) on 
the information to be provided in the environmental statement 
(ES).   
1.4 
Before adopting a scoping opinion the SoS must take into account: 
(a) the specific characteristics of the particular development; 
(b) the specific characteristics of the development of the type 
concerned; and 
(c) environmental 
features 
likely 
to 
be 
affected 
by 
the 
development’. 
(EIA Regulation 8 (9)) 
1.5 
This Opinion sets out what information the SoS considers should 
be included in the ES for the proposed development. The Opinion 
has taken account of:  
i 
the EIA Regulations  
ii 
the nature and scale of the proposed development  
iii 
the nature of the receiving environment, and 
iv 
current best practice in the preparation of environmental 
statements.  
1.6 
The SoS has also taken account of the responses received from 
the statutory consultees (see Appendix 2 of this Opinion). The 
matters addressed by the applicant have been carefully considered 
and use has been made of professional judgement and experience 
in order to adopt this Opinion. It should be noted that when it 
Scoping Opinion for Millbrook Power Project 
 
2 
comes to consider the ES, the SoS will take account of relevant 
legislation and guidelines (as appropriate). The SoS will not be 
precluded from requiring additional information if it is considered 
necessary in connection with the ES submitted with that 
application when considering the application for a development 
consent order (DCO).  
1.7 
This Opinion should not be construed as implying that the SoS 
agrees with the information or comments provided by the 
applicant in their request for an opinion from the SoS. In 
particular, comments from the SoS in this Opinion are without 
prejudice to any decision taken by the SoS (on submission of the 
application) that any development identified by the applicant is 
necessarily to be treated as part of a nationally significant 
infrastructure project (NSIP), or associated development, or 
development that does not require development consent. 
1.8 
Regulation 8(3) of the EIA Regulations states that a request for a 
scoping opinion must include:  
(a) ‘a plan sufficient to identify the land; 
(b) a brief description of the nature and purpose of the 
development and of its possible effects on the environment; 
and 
(c) such other information or representations as the person 
making the request may wish to provide or make’. 
(EIA Regulation 8 (3)) 
1.9 
The SoS considers that this has been provided in the applicant’s 
Scoping Report. 
The Secretary of State’s Consultation 
1.10 
The SoS has a duty under Regulation 8(6) of the EIA Regulations 
to consult widely before adopting a scoping opinion. A full list of 
the bodies consulted for the purposes of this scoping opinion is 
provided at Appendix 1. The list has been compiled by the SoS 
under their duty to notify the consultees in accordance with 
Regulation 9(1)(a). The applicant should note that whilst the SoS’s 
list can inform their consultation, it should not be relied upon for 
that purpose.   
1.11 
The list of respondents who replied within the statutory timeframe 
and whose comments have been taken into account in the 
preparation of this Opinion is provided at Appendix 2 along with 
copies of their comments, to which the applicant should refer in 
undertaking the EIA. 
1.12 
The 
ES 
submitted 
by 
the 
applicant 
should 
demonstrate 
consideration of the points raised by the consultation bodies. It is 
Scoping Opinion for Millbrook Power Project 
 
3 
recommended that a table is provided in the ES summarising the 
scoping responses from the consultation bodies and how they are, 
or are not, addressed in the ES. 
1.13 
Any consultation responses received after the statutory deadline 
for receipt of comments will not be taken into account in this 
Opinion. Late responses will be forwarded to the applicant and will 
be made available on the Planning Inspectorate’s website. The 
applicant should also give due consideration to those comments in 
carrying out the EIA.

2.0 THE PROPOSED DEVELOPMENT 
Introduction 
2.1 
The following is a summary of the information on the proposed 
development and its site and surroundings prepared by the 
applicant and included in their Scoping Report. The information 
has not been verified and it has been assumed that the 
information provided reflects the existing knowledge of the 
proposed development and the potential receptors/resources. 
The Applicant’s Information 
Overview of the proposed development 
2.2 
The proposed Millbrook Power Project comprises  a new power 
generation plant in the form of a simple cycle gas turbine (SCGT) 
gas fired peaking power generating station, fuelled by natural gas 
and capable of providing an electrical capacity of up to 299MW. 
2.3 
Section 1.1.2 of the Scoping Report identifies the following 
principal components of the proposed development:   
 
generating equipment including gas turbine generators which 
would be located within the generating equipment site; 
 
a new purpose built access Road;  
 
a temporary construction compound (the laydown area),  
 
a new gas connection to bring natural gas to the generating 
equipment from the National Transmission System (NTS); 
and 
 
a new electrical connection to export power from the 
generating equipment to the National Grid Electricity 
Transmission System (NETS). 
Description of the site and surrounding area  
The Application Site 
2.4 
The generating equipment, access road and laydown area are 
described in the Scoping Report as forming the ‘Power Generation 
Plant’ and as being located within the ‘Power Generation Plant 
Site’.  The new gas and electrical connections are described 
respectively as located within the ‘Gas Connection Opportunity 
Area’ and the ‘Electrical Connection Opportunity Area’.  The project 
site encompasses the power generation plant site and both 
Opportunity Areas.       
2.5 
The power generation plant site and part of the gas and electrical 
connections would be situated on land within former clay pits 
Scoping Opinion for Millbrook Power Project 
 
5 
known as ‘The Rookery’ and designated as Rookery Clay Pits 
County Wildlife Site (CWS).  
2.6 
The Rookery is situated in the Marston Vale between Milton 
Keynes and Bedford, approximately 3 km north of Ampthill, and    
7 km south west of Bedford.  The gas and electrical connections 
would be located within the Opportunity Areas (identified on Figure 
1 of the Scoping Report) and would extend out from The Rookery 
into farmland to the south and/or east. 
2.7 
The Rookery comprises two large former clay pits, Rookery North 
and Rookery South Pits, separated by an east-west spine of 
unexcavated clay. The generating equipment site, laydown area 
and parts of the access road and gas and electrical connections 
would be located within Rookery South Pit which is approximately 
95ha and is bound by steep clay banks.  The pit base includes a 
range of wetland habitats, including open water, reed beds, pools 
and bare inundated clay with ephemeral water bodies. The 
remaining land at the original ground level around the periphery of 
Rookery South Pit, approximately 42m above ordnance datum 
(AOD), is predominantly bare ground that has been cleared of 
vegetation. 
2.8 
The Rookery is currently the subject of an ongoing Low Level 
Restoration Scheme (LLRS) by the landowner.  Once restored, 
Rookery South Pit will be approximately 15m below the 
surrounding ground level in the vicinity of the generating 
equipment site and laydown area. 
2.9 
Road access to the power generation plant site is currently from 
the north near Stewartby via the A421, Bedford Road and Green 
Lane (Figure 1 of the Scoping Report refers). A junction on Green 
Lane leads to an access track on land on the western side of 
Rookery North Pit which extends southwards into Rookery South 
Pit and the generating equipment site. Depending on their selected 
locations, the gas and electrical connections would either be 
primarily accessed from Junction 13 of the M1 (to the south west 
of the project site) via the A507, Sandhill Close, Houghton Lane, 
Millbrook Road and the B530 Ampthill Road, or from Bedford Road, 
via Woburn Road, Manor Road, B530 Ampthill Road and Millbrook 
Road.  
2.10 
There are overhead power lines that run west to east south of 
Rookery South Pit.  
2.11 
A number of existing public footpaths are located in and around 
the project site, linking it to the wider Marston Vale.  There is 
limited public access to Rookery South Pit itself. 
2.12 
A watercourse, the Mill Brook, flows in a northerly direction along 
the western side of Rookery South Pit whilst a tributary 
watercourse passes to the south of Rookery South Pit within the 
Scoping Opinion for Millbrook Power Project 
 
6 
project site, joining Mill Brook in the vicinity of South Pillinge Farm  
(Figure 2 of the Scoping Report). 
The Surrounding Area 
2.13 
Significant areas of land around Stewartby, including The Rookery, 
have previously been worked for clay that was used in Stewartby 
Brickworks until it closed in 2008. To the north of The Rookery, 
buildings associated with the former Stewartby Brickworks, 
including the chimneys, remain.  The sites have been restored and 
are in different uses, including water based recreation and 
commercial.  The area to the south and east of the project site is 
made up of large open fields, hedgerows, and groups of trees and 
is crossed by electricity pylons.   
2.14 
The parts of the gas and electrical connection Opportunity Areas 
within the project site that lie outside of Rookery South Pit are 
located within a mostly undeveloped agricultural landscape (within 
fields classified as Grade 3) which includes areas of woodland, 
native hedgerows and a number of water-bodies such as ditches. 
2.15 
Watercourses within and surrounding the project site are shown on 
Figure 2.  They include Elstow Brook to the west of the site, and 
Stewartby Lake, which is within 2km of the site.  Mill Brook 
crosses the site. There are smaller streams, brooks and ditches 
near the perimeter of Rookery South Pit, and ponds and lakes in 
both Rookery North Pit and Rookery South Pit close to the access 
road.  The project site is entirely within Flood Zone 1.              
2.16 
Nearby roads include the A421 which is approximately 2 km to the 
west and the B530 which lies to the east of the Proposed 
development Site (Figure 2 of the Scoping Report refers). The 
A421 connects directly to Junction 13 of the M1 Motorway which is 
approximately 5.6 km to the south west of the project site. The 
Midland Mainline railway and Marston Vale line border the power 
generation plant site to the east and west respectively. 
2.17 
The site is within the Northern Marston Vale Growth Area, which is 
allocated in Central Bedfordshire Council’s Core Strategy for 
regeneration and development. Neighbouring residential areas 
include: Stewartby to the north of Green Lane and The Rookery; 
Houghton Conquest approximately 1.5 km to the east; Marston 
Moretaine approximately 1.2 km to the west; and Millbrook 
approximately 400 m to the south (Figures 2 and 3 of the Scoping 
Report refer).  The Houghton Park residential care home is within 
1km of the project site. A vehicle testing ground is located to the 
west of the gas and electrical connection Opportunity Areas. 
2.18 
Marston Vale Millennium Country Park is 50m to the west of the 
project site and provides habitat conservation opportunities, 
indoor and outdoor community amenities, a wind turbine and a 
Forest Centre.     
Scoping Opinion for Millbrook Power Project 
 
7 
2.19 
Section 5.5.5 of the Scoping Report identifies the presence of 6 
Sites of Special Scientific Interest (SSSI) within a 5km radius of 
the survey site, including Cooper’s Hill SSSI approximately 550m 
to the south-east of the south-eastern corner of the survey site. 
There are also 3 Local Nature Reserves (LNRs) within a 5 km 
radius of the project site, the closest of which is Flitwick Wood LNR 
approximately 3.3km to the south of the site. There are also 13 
Country Wildlife Sites (CWS) within 2km of the project site, the 
closest of which is Rookery Clay Pit CWS, within which the site is 
located.   
2.20 
Section 5.10.4 of the Scoping Report identifies cultural heritage 
assets within 5km of the project site, including scheduled 
monuments, listed buildings, the Ampthill Park Grade II Registered 
Park and Garden, and eight conservation areas.  Section 5.10.5 
notes there are 219 Grade ll listed buildings within 5km of the 
project site, including the closest dwelling, South Pillinge 
Farmhouse, located approximately 90m to the west, and 49 
records of undesignated cultural heritage assets within 5km.   
Description of the proposed development  
2.21 
The proposed power generation plant would be designed as a 
peaking plant, fired by natural gas supplied by a new underground 
gas pipeline, connecting the power generation plant to the existing 
electricity NTS by either an underground cable or an overhead 
line.  It would have a capacity of up to 299MW.  The locations of 
the elements on the project site are yet to be determined.    
2.22 
As a peaking plant, the generating equipment would operate for 
up to 1,500 hours per year when there is a ‘stress event’ (i.e. 
when there is a surge in demand for electricity associated with a 
particular event) or where there is a sudden drop in power being 
generated from plants which are constantly operational (e.g. a 
sudden outage).  
2.23 
Section 3.3.4 of the Scoping Report describes the SCGT gas 
turbine options capable of generating up to 299MW under 
consideration by the applicant.  These are aero-derivative gas 
turbines or ‘industrial’ type gas turbines.  The applicant anticipates 
that 3 – 5 aero-derivative turbines or 1 – 2 industrial turbines 
would be required to generate 299MW.   
2.24 
The Scoping Report sets out that the main equipment in a SCGT is 
a 
gas 
turbine 
generator, 
which 
comprises 
the 
following 
components: 
 
inlet air filter; 
 
air compressor; 
 
combustion chamber; 
 
power turbine(s); and 
Scoping Opinion for Millbrook Power Project 
 
8 
 
exhaust silencer. 
2.25 
Sections 3.3.7 – 3.3.8 of the Scoping Report provide operational 
details of a SCGT plant and refer to Figure 4, a diagram of SCGT 
operation.   
2.26 
The gas connection would be in the form of a new underground 
gas pipeline connection (‘the Pipeline’) and above ground 
installation (AGI) and is required to connect the generating 
equipment to the existing high pressure NTS in order to provide a 
reliable supply of fuel. 
2.27 
Sections 3.4.2 – 3.4.4 identify the NTS feeder possible connection 
points. Identification of specific route corridor options is still 
ongoing but it is anticipated that the gas connection would be 
situated within the gas connection Opportunity Area to the south 
and east of the generating equipment site (Figure 1 of the Scoping 
Report refers). 
2.28 
Connection of the pipeline to an NTS feeder would require two 
AGIs to be installed which will include: a Minimum Offtake 
Connection (MOC) facility, and a PIG Trap Facility (PTF). 
2.29 
The electrical connection will enable power to be exported from 
the generating equipment to the NETS, and will comprise a new 
substation and two new electrical circuits either in the form of an 
underground cable or overhead line. 
2.30 
Section 3.5.2 of the Scoping Report identifies the most suitable 
point of connection as a new substation to be located either on the 
generating equipment site or adjacent to the line of the existing 
National Grid double circuit 400 kV line which runs from Sundon to 
Grendon. 
2.31 
If an underground export cable option between the substation and 
NETS is selected, up to two new sealing end compounds (SECs) 
would also be required, constructed at the point where the 
underground cable emerges to facilitate its connection into the 
NETS. It is possible that one, both or neither of the SEC(s) or 
substation will be required depending on the selected option for 
the electrical connection. 
Proposed access  
2.32 
A new purpose built access road 1.7km long would be constructed 
within the power generation plant site from Green Lane to the 
generating equipment site.  
Scoping Opinion for Millbrook Power Project 
 
9 
Construction  
2.33 
A temporary laydown area for the storage of plant and equipment 
during construction would be provided adjacent to the generating 
equipment Site, as shown in Figure 1 of the Scoping Report. 
2.34 
Section 3.3.18 of the Scoping Report states that construction and 
commissioning 
of 
the 
proposed 
development 
would 
take 
approximately 22 months. The main works associated with the 
construction phase would be excavation and site levelling for new 
foundations, potential piling (if required) and the laying of the gas 
and electrical connections. No requirements for demolition or 
remediation have been identified at this stage. 
2.35 
Prior 
to 
the 
construction 
of 
the 
proposed 
development 
commencing, it is anticipated the following components of the 
Rookery LLRS will be complete:  
 
topsoil stripping and stockpiling of material from the 
remaining southern permitted extraction area on the 
southern side of Rookery South Pit to enable the extraction of 
clay for use in the proposed restoration works; 
 
formation of a noise screening bund from stripped topsoil and 
subsoil  along the western edge of the works adjacent to 
Pillinge Farm; 
 
redirection of existing surface water ditches and provision of 
an upper carrier ditch around the southern perimeter of the 
southern permitted excavation area; 
 
excavation of clay from the southern permitted extraction 
area to provide material for the proposed restoration works 
and buttressing works, including provision of a new access 
ramp from the extraction area into the base of the pit; 
 
construction of a new access ramp in the north west corner of 
Rookery South Pit; 
 
construction of a landscaped platform graded so that 
drainage falls across the entire base of Rookery South Pit, 
utilising material won from either regrading of the base of the 
pit or from the southern permitted extraction area, to enable 
gravity drainage to occur in the base of the pit; 
 
construction of surface water interceptor channels collecting 
to a single attenuation pond located at the north western 
corner of Rookery South Pit. The surface water interceptor 
channels and attenuation pond will include habitat mitigation 
and ecological enhancement measures; 
 
provision of a pumping station to enable external discharge of 
collected waters from the attenuation pond to an existing 
ditch/culvert discharge to Stewartby Lake; 
Scoping Opinion for Millbrook Power Project 
 
10 
 
buttressing of the pit edge slopes to the south (part), east 
and north (part) to provide a slope stabilisation solution for 
the existing slopes; and 
 
redirection of existing surface water ditches and provision of 
an upper carrier ditch around the southern perimeter of the 
southern excavation area. 
Operation and Maintenance 
2.36 
The power generation plant would have an operational life of 25 
years, after which it would be decommissioned or re-powered.  For 
the purpose of the EIA, the Scoping Report has assumed that it 
will be decommissioned.  
2.37 
Operation of the generating equipment would require up to 15 full 
time staff over the lifetime of the proposed development working 
in shifts, so less than 15 people will be on site at any one time 
during normal operations.  Contracted engineering staff would 
undertake regular maintenance shutdowns and maintenance of the 
gas and electrical connections. 
Decommissioning 
2.38 
Section 3.3.20 of the Scoping Report states that decommissioning 
would involve the removal of all power generation plant items and 
restoration of the project site to a similar, pre-construction 
condition. This process is also likely to take approximately 22 
months. 
The Secretary of State’s Comments  
Description of the application site and surrounding area  
2.39 
In addition to detailed baseline information to be provided within 
topic specific chapters of the ES, the SoS would expect the ES to 
include a section that summarises the site and surroundings. This 
would identify the context of the proposed development, any 
relevant designations, and sensitive receptors. This section should 
identify land that could be directly or indirectly affected by the 
proposed development and any associated auxiliary facilities, 
landscaping areas and potential off site mitigation or compensation 
schemes. 
2.40 
The power generation plant application site and the surrounding 
area are clearly described within the Scoping Report and it is 
expected that a comprehensive description would also be provided 
within the ES. 
2.41 
The power generation plant will require a new underground gas 
pipeline connection and AGI to connect the generating equipment 
to the existing high pressure NTS to provide fuel.  The SoS notes 
that the ES will include details of the route selected.  
Scoping Opinion for Millbrook Power Project 
 
11 
2.42 
The SoS notes that it is anticipated that some elements of the 
Rookery LLRS would be complete by the time construction would 
be expected to begin.  The SoS would expect to see a description 
of the stage that the LLRS had reached at the time of the DCO 
submission, and a clear explanation of what the ultimate base 
level of the site proposed for the power generation plant within 
Rookery South Pit will be in metres AOD (mAOD). The ES should 
also give consideration to any implications of future works.    
2.43 
The project site plan at Figure 1 does not name the surrounding 
roads and it is not possible to see them on Figure 3 due to the 
plan scale.  Figure 3 is a useful plan but does not identify 
environmentally sensitive features such as public rights of way 
(PROWs).  It would be helpful to include relevant plans in each 
topic section of the ES that identify the study area and receptors, 
and ensure that the title of identified features reflects that used in 
the text, eg South Pillinge Farm is identified as Pillinge Farm South 
on Figure 2.                   
Description of the proposed development  
2.44 
The applicant should ensure that the description of the proposed 
development that is being applied for is as accurate and firm as 
possible as this will form the basis of the environmental impact 
assessment. It is understood that at this stage in the evolution of 
the scheme the description of the proposals and even the location 
of the site may not be confirmed. The applicant should be aware 
however, that the description of the development in the ES must 
be sufficiently certain to meet the requirements of paragraph 17 of 
Schedule 4 Part 1 of the EIA Regulations, and there should 
therefore be more certainty by the time the ES is submitted with 
the DCO.  
2.45 
In the event that a draft DCO is submitted, the applicant should 
clearly define what elements of the proposed development are 
integral to the NSIP, and what elements are ‘associated 
development’ under the Planning Act 2008 (PA 2008) or an 
ancillary matter.   
2.46 
Any proposed works and/or infrastructure required as associated 
development, or as an ancillary matter, (whether on or off-site) 
should be considered as part of an integrated approach to 
environmental assessment.  
2.47 
The SoS recommends that the ES should include a clear 
description of all aspects of the proposed development, at the 
construction, operation and decommissioning stages, and include: 
 
land use requirements, including the area of the offshore 
elements 
 
site preparation 
Scoping Opinion for Millbrook Power Project 
 
12 
 
construction processes and methods 
 
transport routes 
 
operational requirements including the main characteristics of 
the production process and the nature and quantity of 
materials used, as well as waste arisings and their disposal 
 
maintenance activities including any potential environmental 
or navigation impacts, and 
 
emissions - water, air and soil pollution, noise, vibration, 
light, heat, radiation. 
2.48 
The Scoping Report does not contain a location plan or a layout 
plan, indicative or otherwise.  Although Figures 2 and 3 show the 
location of the proposed development in the wider area the scale 
makes it difficult  to discern features in the area other than those 
represented in the keys.  The ES should contain plans that clearly 
identify the proposed development’s location in the wider area, 
and that indicate the position of the main elements of the 
proposed development on the site.   
2.49 
The SoS notes that Table 3.1 of  the Scoping Report provides 
indicative dimensions for the main plant items, but that AOD levels 
are not defined and that the height of the stacks is defined in 
terms of ‘ground level surrounding Rookery South Pit’.  For the 
purposes of the ES, the heights of the elements of the 
development will need to be defined in minimum/maximum 
mAOD. 
2.50 
Figure 4 does not reflect the same elements of a gas turbine 
generator as identified in paragraph 3.3.6.  Diagrams and figures 
in the ES should reflect the text so that it is easy to read across 
between them.       
2.51 
Section 3.4 of the Scoping Report provides information on the gas 
connection Opportunity Area.  It would be useful to include in the 
ES diagrams of elements that will be required, such as the MOC 
and PTF.    
2.52 
The environmental effects of all wastes to be processed and 
removed from the site should be addressed. The ES will need to 
identify and describe the control processes and mitigation 
procedures for storing and transporting waste off site. All waste 
types should be quantified and classified.  
Alternatives 
2.53 
The ES requires that the applicant provide ‘An outline of the main 
alternatives studied by the applicant and an indication of the main 
reasons for the applicant’s choice, taking into account the 
environmental effects’ (See Appendix 3).  
Scoping Opinion for Millbrook Power Project 
 
13 
2.54 
The SoS notes that a number of site locations and technology 
options were considered by the applicant, and is pleased to note 
that a detailed appraisal will be included in the ES.       
Flexibility   
2.55 
The SoS notes the comments in the Scoping Report that the 
detailed design of the power generation plant is still being 
developed and that the draft description of development contains 
a number of variables, including the type of turbine, the location 
on the site of the generating equipment, the routes for the gas 
and electrical connections, and the configuration of the electrical 
connection. The SoS welcomes that the proposals are to be firmed 
up during the pre-application stage but encourages the description 
to be as accurate and firm as possible so that its environmental 
impacts can be more accurately assessed. 
2.56 
The SoS notes the applicant’s intention where the details of the 
scheme cannot be defined precisely for the EIA to assess the likely 
worst case scenario. The SoS welcomes the reference to Planning 
Inspectorate Advice Note 9 ‘Using the ‘Rochdale Envelope’ but also 
directs attention to the ‘Flexibility’ section in Appendix 3 of this 
Opinion which provides additional details on the recommended 
approach. 
2.57 
It should be noted that if the proposed development changes 
substantially during the EIA process, prior to application 
submission, the applicant may wish to consider the need to 
request a new scoping opinion. 
Grid connection  
2.58 
The SoS notes that the proposed routes for the gas and electricity 
connections, the configuration of the electricity connection, and 
the location and number of related elements, such as substations, 
are still to be determined.  All options included in the proposed 
development DCO application must be fully assessed in the ES and 
plans provided to reflect each option.       
Proposed access 
2.59 
The SoS considers that information regarding site access routes 
for construction traffic and any vehicles carrying abnormal 
indivisible loads (AIL) should be clearly identified and assessed 
within the ES, including any alterations required to the existing 
road network to accommodate any AIL. The ES should also identify 
whether any alterations to the existing road network would be 
retained or reinstated, and assess the potential effects arising. 
Scoping Opinion for Millbrook Power Project 
 
14 
Construction  
2.60 
The SoS considers that information on construction including: 
phasing of programme; construction methods and activities 
associated with each phase; siting of construction compounds 
(including on and off site); lighting equipment/requirements; and 
number, movements and parking of construction vehicles (both 
HGVs and staff) should be clearly indicated in the ES.  
Operation and maintenance 
2.61 
Information on the operation and maintenance of the proposed 
development should be included in the ES and should cover but 
not be limited to such matters as:  the number of full/part-time 
jobs; the operational hours and if appropriate, shift patterns; the 
number and types of vehicle movements generated during the 
operational stage. 
Decommissioning 
2.62 
The SoS welcomes the consideration of decommissioning.  Whilst 
it is acknowledged that information on the decommissioning 
strategy may not be fully developed at this early stage, the 
purpose 
of such a long term assessment is to enable the 
decommissioning of the works to be taken into account in the 
design and use of materials so that structures can be taken down 
with the minimum of disruption. The SoS advises that as much 
detail as possible on the proposed approach, including the process 
and methods of decommissioning, is provided within the ES to 
ensure that the long term assessment can consider the impacts of 
decommissioning for each element of the proposed scheme. 
Scoping Opinion for Millbrook Power Project

3.0 EIA APPROACH AND TOPIC AREAS 
Introduction 
3.1 
This section contains the SoS’s specific comments on the approach 
to the ES and topic areas as set out in the Scoping Report. General 
advice on the presentation of an ES is provided at Appendix 3 of 
this Opinion and should be read in conjunction with this Section.  
3.2 
Applicants are advised that the scope of the DCO application 
should be clearly addressed and assessed consistently within the 
ES.  
Environmental Statement (ES) - approach 
3.3 
The information provided in the Scoping Report sets out the 
proposed approach to the preparation of the ES. Whilst early 
engagement on the scope of the ES is to be welcomed, the SoS 
notes that the level of information provided at this stage is not 
always sufficient to allow for detailed comments from either the 
SoS or the consultees.  
3.4 
The SoS would suggest that the applicant ensures that appropriate 
consultation is undertaken with the relevant consultees in order to 
agree wherever possible the timing and relevance of survey work 
as well as the methodologies to be used. The SoS notes and 
welcomes the intention to finalise the scope of investigations in 
conjunction with ongoing stakeholder liaison and consultation with 
the relevant regulatory authorities and their advisors. 
3.5 
The extent of the study area is not set out for each topic in the 
Scoping Report.  The SoS recommends that the physical scope of 
the study areas should be identified under all the environmental 
topics and should be sufficiently robust in order to undertake the 
assessment. The extent of the study areas should be on the basis 
of recognised professional guidance, whenever such guidance is 
available. The study areas should also be agreed with the relevant 
consultees and, where this is not possible, this should be stated 
clearly in the ES and a reasoned justification given. The scope 
should also cover the breadth of the topic area and the temporal 
scope, and these aspects should be described and justified. 
3.6 
The SoS notes that the proposed development includes gas and 
electrical connections and refers the applicant to the comments of 
The Health and Safety Executive, Public Health England, National 
Grid, and ES Pipelines in relation to safety issues and other points, 
including the locations of existing infrastructure, to be taken into 
consideration in deciding on the preferred configurations and 
routes.       
Scoping Opinion for Millbrook Power Project 
 
16 
3.7 
The SoS notes that a number of existing wayleaves and/or 
easements are in place that could be affected by the proposed 
access routes and the proposed electricity and gas connections, 
and recommends that the design of the proposed development 
and assessments in the ES take account of these.  
3.8 
The SoS notes the information in Section 4.2 and 4.3 of the 
Scoping Report on the assessment of potential cumulative effects, 
and developments that will be included in the assessment, and 
welcomes the applicant’s intention to include an assessment of 
cumulative impacts in each ES topic chapter and in the 
Conclusions chapter.  
3.9 
The SoS notes that there may be ongoing works on and around 
the project site in connection with the LLRS.  The SoS 
recommends that consideration is given to including in the 
cumulative impacts assessment potential further changes to the 
land that result from the LLRS subsequent to establishing the 
baselines for the topic assessments.   
3.10 
The SoS notes the applicant’s references to the possible inclusion 
of the East West Rail Project and the Bedford and Milton Keynes 
Waterway in the cumulative impacts assessment for this proposed 
development.  The applicant’s attention is drawn to the comments 
made about these proposals by Luton Borough Council and the 
Canal and River Trust, respectively, contained in Appendix 2 of 
this Opinion.  The SoS recommends that the applicant considers 
whether these proposals are at such a stage that they should be 
included 
in 
the 
cumulative 
impact 
assessment. 
 
Further 
information on the scope of cumulative impacts which should be 
included in the ES is provided at Appendix 3 to this Opinion. 
Matters to be scoped out 
3.11 
The applicant has identified in the relevant sections of the Scoping 
Report the matters proposed to be ‘scoped out’. These include:  
 
potential odour impacts during the operational phase; 
 
emissions to air from the gas and electrical connections 
during the operational phase;     
 
noise and vibration impacts from the gas and electrical 
connections (if an overhead line is constructed) during the 
operational phase;   
 
noise impacts from the electrical infrastructure that may be 
required, ie substation and up to two SECs, during the 
operational phase;   
 
impacts on water quality and resources during operation and 
decommissioning of the gas and electricity connections; 
Scoping Opinion for Millbrook Power Project 
 
17 
landscape and visual impacts on the nearest AONB (the 
Chilterns) to the project site;  
3.12 
Matters cannot be scoped out unless specifically addressed and 
justified by the applicant, and confirmed as being scoped out by 
the SoS.   
3.13 
Decisions to scope out impacts should be fully explained and 
justified in the ES.  At this stage, the SoS agrees that the following 
matters can be scoped out of the EIA during the operational 
phase:  potential odour impacts; emissions to air from the gas and 
electrical connections; noise and vibration impacts from the gas 
connections; and impacts on water quality and resources of the 
gas and electricity connections. 
3.14 
It is not explicitly stated in the Scoping Report whether the 
proposed electricity connection will be 132kV or 400kV, although it 
is indicated that it will connect to a 400kV network.  In the event 
that the connection will be 400kV the SoS does not agree that 
noise impacts from the electrical connections can be scoped out, 
as insufficient information has been provided by the applicant at 
this time to justify such an approach.     
3.15 
The SoS does not agree that noise impacts from the electrical 
infrastructure that may be required can be scoped out during the 
operational phase as insufficient information has been provided by 
the applicant at this time to justify such an approach.      
3.16 
The SoS does not agree that impacts on water quality and 
resources during the decommissioning of the gas and electricity 
connections can be scoped out as insufficient information has been 
provided at this time by the applicant to justify such an approach.  
Paragraph 5.6.12 of the Scoping Report refers to construction of 
the gas and electricity connections and states that effects during 
operation and decommissioning are unlikely to occur.  However, 
other sections of the Report suggest that it is not yet known 
whether the connections will be left in situ or removed following 
decommissioning of the proposed development.  In the event that 
the connections might be removed, the SoS does not agree that 
effects during decommissioning can be scoped out.  If the 
preferred option has not been decided by the time the DCO 
application is submitted, identification and an assessment of 
potential impacts on water resources during the decommissioning 
phase in relation to the connections should be included in the ES. 
3.17 
The SoS does not agree that landscape and visual impacts on the 
Chilterns AONB can be scoped out as insufficient information has 
been provided by the applicant at this time to justify such an 
approach.   
3.18 
Whilst the SoS has not agreed within this Opinion to scope out 
certain topics or matters on the basis of the information available 
Scoping Opinion for Millbrook Power Project 
 
18 
at this time, this does not prevent the applicant from subsequently 
agreeing with the relevant consultees to scope matters out of the 
ES, where further evidence has been provided to justify this 
approach. This approach should be explained fully in the ES. 
3.19 
In order to demonstrate that topics have not simply been 
overlooked, where topics are scoped out prior to submission of the 
DCO application, the ES should still explain the reasoning and 
justify the approach taken. 
National Policy Statements (NPSs)  
3.20 
Sector-specific NPSs are produced by the relevant Government 
Departments and set out national policy for nationally significant 
infrastructure projects (NSIPs). They provide the framework within 
which the Examining Authority will make their recommendations to 
the Secretary of State and include the Government’s objectives for 
the development of NSIPs.  
3.21 
The NPSs relevant to the proposed development, i.e. EN-1, EN-2, 
EN-4 and EN-5, set out both the generic and technology-specific 
impacts that should be considered in the EIA for the proposed 
development. When undertaking the EIA, the applicant must have 
regard to both the generic and technology-specific impacts and 
identify how these impacts have been assessed in the ES.  
3.22 
The Secretary of State must have regard to any matter that the 
Secretary of State thinks is important and relevant to the 
Secretary of State’s decision. This could include a draft NPS if the 
relevant NPS has not been formally designated. 
Environmental Statement - Structure  
3.23 
Section 4.2 of the Scoping Report sets out the proposed structure 
of the ES on which the applicant seeks the opinion of the SoS.  
3.24 
The SoS notes from Section 4.2, Table 4.1 that the EIA for the 
proposed development would cover topics under the following 
headings:  
 
Air Quality 
 
Noise and vibration 
 
Ecology 
 
Water quality and resources 
 
Geology, ground conditions and agriculture 
 
Landscape and visual 
 
Traffic, transport and access 
 
Cultural heritage and archaeology 
Scoping Opinion for Millbrook Power Project 
 
19 
 
Socio-economics  
3.25 
The SoS recommends that the ES should also cover potential 
impacts caused by the removal and disposal of waste; and as a 
result of the electric and magnetic fields generated by the 
proposed development.   
Topic Areas  
 Air Quality (see Scoping Report Section 5.3)  
3.26 
This section does not include a definition of what constitutes a 
significant effect, however the SoS notes that paragraph 5.5.2 of 
Section 5.2 (Significance Criteria) states that each ES technical 
chapter will include such a definition.   
3.27 
Air quality and dust levels should be considered not only on site 
but also off site, including along access roads and traffic routes, 
and local footpaths and other PROWs, especially during the 
construction phase. 
3.28 
The extent of the study area should be described and the reasons 
for selecting it provided.   
3.29 
The SoS notes that the nearest Air Quality Management Area 
(AQMA) is approximately 10km from the project site.  Any AQMAs 
that fall within the selected study area should be identified by 
name and their location should be shown on a plan either included 
in the ES or cross-referenced from the SoS.  The SoS considers 
that adverse changes to air quality should be assessed in relation 
to compliance with European air quality limit values and AQMAs. 
3.30 
Paragraph 5.3.6 identifies statutory ecologically designated sites 
within 10km of the project site but does not include any European 
sites, although there are references in this chapter to the need to 
consider European sites within 10km of the project site.   Flitwick 
Wood LNR and Flitton Moor LNR are not mentioned in this context, 
although these LNRs are identified in paragraph 5.5.5 of the 
Ecology section as within 5km of the project site.  The SoS 
recommends that reasoned justification should be provided within 
the ES for the inclusion/exclusion of the assessment of air quality 
impacts on ecologically designated sites.  
3.31 
Scoping Report Figure 3 shows environmentally sensitive receptors 
within a 5km area of the project site but does not include 
receptors for all topics, e.g. PROWs are not shown.  Each topic 
chapter should include a plan that identifies relevant sensitive 
receptors, by name where applicable, within the selected study 
area for that topic.       
3.32 
The SoS notes that this section identifies residential receptors 
within 1km of the project site.  The assessment should take 
Scoping Opinion for Millbrook Power Project 
 
20 
account of air emissions from the proposed development and 
emissions related to vehicular movements associated with the 
proposed development, particularly during the construction phase.  
Consideration should be given to whether a 1km study area is 
sufficient to identify all potentially significant impacts, such as 
those related to emissions from construction vehicles, and the SoS 
recommends that this is determined in consultation with the 
relevant local Councils. 
3.33 
The SoS welcomes the applicant’s intention to agree the 
assessment methodology for this topic with the relevant Council 
Officers and the Environment Agency (EA). The applicant’s 
attention is drawn to the comments made by Luton Borough 
Council, contained in Appendix 2 of this Opinion, in relation to 
factors that should be included in the modelling.   
3.34 
The SoS is pleased to note that the stack height will be based on 
the predicted maximum short term and long term ground level 
NOx concentrations, and that the detailed dispersion modelling will 
then be undertaken according to that stack height.  The SoS 
recommends that dispersion modelling considers a range of 
possibilities and seeks to ensure that the ‘worst case’ scenario is 
assessed, for example the ‘worst case’ may occur as a short term 
impact. The implications of stack height and dispersion of 
emissions will need to be clearly explained in the ES.   
3.35 
Consideration should be given to monitoring dust complaints 
during all phases of the proposed development.   
3.36 
The applicant is referred to the comments of Public Health England 
in Appendix 2 of this Opinion, particularly in relation to 
establishing the baseline for assessment purposes.    
3.37 
This ES topic chapter should cross-refer to the ES Ecology chapter, 
bearing in mind that there is the need to consider potential effects 
due to an increase in airborne pollution including fugitive dust 
emissions, especially during site preparation, demolition and 
construction.  
Noise and Vibration (see Scoping Report Section 5.4) 
3.38 
Paragraph 5.4.2 identifies sources of noise in the vicinity of the 
project site. These should be identified on a plan contained in the 
ES.   
3.39 
The SoS notes that the proposed development layout has not been 
finalised at this stage and recommends that consideration should 
be given to minimising the impacts of noise on sensitive receptors 
where possible by appropriate siting and orientation of the various 
elements of the proposed development.   
Scoping Opinion for Millbrook Power Project 
 
21 
3.40 
The SoS welcomes the applicant’s intention to agree the 
assessment methodology and the locations for the baseline noise 
survey with the relevant Council Environmental Health Officers, 
and draws attention to comments received from Bedford Borough 
Council and Central Bedfordshire Council, contained in Appendix 2 
in this respect. 
3.41 
Paragraph 5.4.5 states that noise sensitive receptors within 100m 
of construction and decommissioning activities will be identified, 
although paragraph 5.4.11 proposes that the study area for this 
topic will be an area within 1km of the project site, so the extent 
of the study area is unclear.  The study area must be clearly and 
consistently defined in the ES and the reasons for selecting it 
explained.  The applicant’s attention is drawn to the comments 
made by Bedford Borough Council, contained in Appendix 2 of this 
Opinion, 
in 
relation 
to 
the 
identification 
of 
receptors.  
Consideration should be given to whether the proposed study area 
is sufficient to identify potentially significant impacts on all 
relevant receptors.  The noise and vibration assessments should 
take account of traffic movements along access routes to the site, 
especially during the construction phase.  
3.42 
All activities that could generate noise and vibration impacts at all 
phases of the proposed development should be fully identified, 
e.g. such as piling, vehicle movements on and off site, and 
assessed in the ES.   Information should be provided in the ES on 
the types of vehicles and plant to be used during the construction 
phase and their potential effects.   
3.43 
Impacts of noise on people should be specifically addressed in the 
ES, and particularly any potential noise disturbance at night and 
other unsocial hours such as weekends and public holidays.  
3.44 
Consideration should be given to monitoring noise complaints 
during construction and when the development is operational.  
3.45 
The results from the noise and vibration assessments should also 
provide information to inform the ecological assessments, and this 
chapter should cross-refer to other chapters such as the ES 
Ecology chapter.    
Ecology (see Scoping Report Section 5.5) 
3.46 
The SoS recommends that the project should address fully the 
needs of protecting and enhancing biodiversity. The assessment 
should cover habitats, species and processes within the sites and 
surroundings. The SoS notes the recommendations in the 
Extended Phase 1 Habitats Survey for further surveys either on 
the project site or in the nearby area for the following species:   
bats; badgers; water voles; breeding birds; great crested newts 
(GCNs); reptiles; and terrestrial and aquatic invertebrates.    
Scoping Opinion for Millbrook Power Project 
 
22 
3.47 
Paragraph 5.5.4 states that a desk based assessment and Habitat 
Survey were undertaken in February 2014.   The SoS notes that 
Appendix 1 (Ecological Appraisal) of the Scoping Report includes 
an addendum to the Ecological Appraisal, which sets out the 
results of an ecological walkover survey carried out in March 2014 
following adjustments to the extent of the survey site for the 
proposed development.  The ES should clearly identify the total 
extent of the surveyed area and reference all the relevant reports.  
The SoS recommends that ecological surveys should be thorough, 
up to date and take account of other developments proposed in 
the vicinity. 
3.48 
This section does not identify the extent of the study areas that 
were used for all of the species identified.  Paragraph 5.5.5 
identifies six SSSIs within 5km of the project site but Appendix 1 
identifies seven SSSIs.  The applicant should ensure that study 
areas are clearly defined for each species and habitat, and that 
information on features within those study areas is consistent 
throughout the ES and any documents to which it refers.     
3.49 
The SoS notes the assumption in the Scoping Report that all GCNs 
will have been translocated from the project site as part of the 
current LLRS, and that therefore no further surveys of the project 
site will be required.  The stage that the LLRS has reached at the 
time of the application submission should be clearly explained in 
the ES, and relevant information in relation to protected species 
and habitats should be provided.         
3.50 
In relation to aquatic invertebrates, the SoS notes that it is stated 
that the ditches and ponds on site will be surveyed if a Water 
Framework Directive Report (WFD Report) is required. However, 
the Habitat Survey recommends that aquatic surveys are 
undertaken to determine the assemblage of aquatic invertebrates 
present on site, and that surveys may also be necessary to 
determine ecological quality if any watercourses are lost or in 
order to comply with the WFD.  The applicant must satisfy 
themselves that all necessary surveys have been undertaken prior 
to submission of the DCO application, and that all species and 
habitats that may be affected have been identified.      
3.51 
The SoS notes that no European sites have been identified at this 
stage, but welcomes the applicant’s intention to consult NE and 
relevant local Councils in order to establish the extent of the 
relevant study area and the potential need for a screening exercise 
and provision of information to inform an appropriate assessment 
under the Habitats Regulations.  The location of any European 
sites which may be affected by the proposed development should 
be clearly indicated on a plan accompanying the ES.  The Applicant 
is referred to the information on the Habitats Regulations in 
Section 4 of this Scoping Opinion.                                  
Scoping Opinion for Millbrook Power Project 
 
23 
3.52 
The ecological assessments should take account of potential 
impacts of noise, vibration and air quality (including dust) on 
ecological receptors, and cross reference should be made to 
relevant specialist reports, and to information in other ES topic 
chapters as appropriate.    
3.53 
The SoS highlights the need to consider cumulative and combined 
impacts, and advises this is particularly relevant in assessing the 
impacts on ecological interests.    
3.54 
The SoS notes that the project site and surrounding area includes 
some woodland.  The applicant is referred to the comments of the 
Forestry Commission in Appendix 2 of this Opinion, particularly in 
relation to the potential need to obtain consent for planting and/or 
felling of trees, and to longer-term management of any 
compensatory plantings.      
Water Quality and Resources (see Scoping Report Section 5.6) 
3.55 
The SoS welcomes the intention to provide a Flood Risk 
Assessment (FRA) in consultation with the EA and Lead Local Flood 
Authority.  The FRA should form an appendix to the ES (and cross-
referenced from other application documents as necessary) rather 
than being provided as a standalone application document.   
3.56 
The SoS notes that the applicant assumes at this stage that air 
cooling will be utilised for the proposed development rather than 
water cooling.  If the preferred option has not been determined at 
the time the DCO application is submitted, either both options 
should be assessed in the ES, or the worst case scenario identified 
and assessed.     
3.57 
Paragraph 5.6.10 states that no significant impacts are anticipated 
on key waterbodies and that the majority of watercourses are a 
significant distance from the project site.  However, other 
paragraphs in the Report, and Figures 2 and 3, indicate that part 
of Mill Brook is within the site boundary.  The applicant should 
ensure that the assessment of impacts on water resources 
identifies and considers all watercourses that may be affected, 
including Mill Brook.  The applicant’s attention is drawn to the 
comments made by the Canal and River Trust, contained in 
Appendix 2 of this Opinion, about the Bedford and Milton Keynes 
Waterway Park, and advises that consideration should be given to 
including that proposed development in the cumulative impacts 
assessment. 
3.58 
Paragraph 5.6.10 states that it is not anticipated that water will be 
directly abstracted or discharged from any of the identified water 
sources during any of the phases of the development.  However, 
paragraph 5.6.19 states that discharges from the proposed 
development during operation would be controlled by an 
Environmental Permit, so it is unclear whether discharges to 
Scoping Opinion for Millbrook Power Project 
 
24 
watercourses will occur, and if so, which watercourses would be 
affected.  It should be made clear in the ES whether the proposed 
development includes any discharges to water, and if so, impacts 
should be robustly assessed. If the position is not known at the 
time of the DCO application the worst case scenario should be 
indicated and assessed.   
3.59 
Paragraph 5.6.15 notes that in relation to the electricity and gas 
connections various techniques may be used to cross waterbodies 
where necessary.   All crossing locations should be identified in the 
ES, and all potential techniques identified and assessed.    
3.60 
The applicant’s attention is drawn to the comments of Network 
Rail, contained in Appendix 2 of this Opinion, in relation to the 
potential 
impacts 
of 
surface 
water 
drainage 
on 
railway 
infrastructure and the possible requirement for easements.     
3.61 
Groundwater is the potential pathway for discharge of liquids to 
surface and coastal waters. The SoS considers that the impacts of 
climate change, in terms of increased run-off and rises in sea 
level, should be taken into account in the ES. 
3.62 
This topic chapter makes reference to potential impacts on 
hydrogeology being assessed in the Geology, Ground Conditions 
and Agriculture ES chapter.  These chapters should be cross-
referenced and inter-relationships considered as appropriate. 
3.63 
The applicant is referred to the comments of Public Health England 
in Appendix 2 of this Opinion, particularly in relation to 
establishing the baseline for assessment purposes. 
Geology, Ground Conditions and Agriculture (see Scoping Report 
Section 5.7) 
3.64 
The SoS notes that some filling of Rookery South Pit will take 
place as part of the LLRS.  The ES should fully set out the works 
and the stage that they have reached, and ensure that any 
changes to the land that have taken place are reflected in the 
baseline description for this topic. Potential further changes to the 
land that result from the LLRS following the establishment of the 
baseline may need to be taken into account in the assessment of 
cumulative impacts.   
3.65 
It is stated in paragraph 5.7.6 that there are water bearing strata 
below the project site.  The ES should identify by name and 
provide an assessment of features which may be affected by the 
proposed development such as aquifers. 
3.66 
The SoS welcomes the applicant’s intention to consult the local 
Councils and EA in order to obtain relevant information and refine 
the assessment methodology.   
Scoping Opinion for Millbrook Power Project 
 
25 
3.67 
The study area for this topic is not identified in this section.  It 
should be clearly defined and justified in the ES.      
3.68 
This ES chapter should be cross-referenced with the Water Quality 
and Resources chapter, and inter-relationships assessed as 
appropriate.    
3.69 
The applicant is referred to the comments of Public Health England 
in Appendix 2 of this Opinion, particularly in relation to any 
potential for historical contamination of the project site, and to the 
comments of Central Bedfordshire Council in relation to potential 
cumulative impacts.   
Landscape and Visual Impact (see Scoping Report Section 5.8) 
3.70 
It is stated in this section that the Rookery South Pit is being 
extended, which suggests that the Pit is still being worked, 
although it is understood by the SoS that extraction will take place 
as part of the LLRS.  The SoS recommends that the terminology 
used to describe the LLRS works is used consistently throughout 
the ES in order to provide clarity about the nature of the works at 
the Pit.   
3.71 
The landscape and visual cumulative impacts assessment should 
include not just other proposed large industrial developments in 
the area, but also other types of development that could 
contribute to a cumulative effect.  The SoS recommends that the 
wind turbine in the Marston Vale Millennium Country Park is 
included in the assessment of potential cumulative effects of this 
proposed development, and that consideration should be given to 
the potential for a further turbine at Stewartby landfill site, as 
highlighted in the response of Central Bedfordshire Council             
3.72 
The study area for this topic is not identified in this section, 
although reference is made to residential receptors within 1km of 
the project site.  Bearing in mind that the proposed development 
includes 1- 5 stacks of up to 60m in height, the applicant should 
consider whether a 1km study area is sufficient to identify all 
those residential receptors that may be affected and the likely 
significant visual impacts. The applicant is referred to the 
comments of Luton Borough Council, contained in Appendix 2 of 
this Opinion, in relation to potential views of the stacks.    
3.73 
Reference is made in this section to a Zone of Theoretical Visibility 
(ZTV) plan.  The SoS advises that the ES should describe the ZTV 
model used, and provide information on the area covered, the 
timing of any survey work, and the methodology used. The SoS 
welcomes 
the 
intention 
to 
provide 
photomontages, 
and 
recommends that the locations of viewpoints are agreed with the 
relevant local authorities. 
Scoping Opinion for Millbrook Power Project 
 
26 
3.74 
The SoS notes that the nearest AONB to the project site has been 
scoped out of the assessment on the basis that it is remote from 
the site and visually separated, although the distance between it 
and the site has not been specified.  Fuller information on the 
location of the AONB, and visibility of the development from the 
AONB, taking account of maximum heights of structures proposed, 
should be provided in the ES.   
3.75 
Figure 3 of the Scoping Report shows environmentally sensitive 
receptors within 5km of the project site, and identifies a Country 
Park but does not identify any PROWs.  The ES should include a 
plan that identifies all the landscape and visual receptors within 
the selected study area.    
3.76 
The SoS notes that the landscape and visual assessment of 
potential impacts of the gas and electricity connections will focus 
on the AGIs, substation and SEC(s) (if required) during the 
construction phase.  If these structures are to be removed as part 
of the decommissioning of the proposed development, impacts 
during that phase should also be considered.                      
3.77 
The proposed development includes large structures including 
stacks up to 60m in height on the site.  The SoS recommends that 
careful consideration is given to the form, siting, and use of 
materials and colours in relation to minimising potential adverse 
visual impacts of large structures.  
3.78 
The assessment should include consideration of any visible plumes 
which may be emitted from the stacks and which may additionally 
draw attention to the proposed development. Night time lighting 
effects, including those which may result from the need to provide 
any air navigation warning lights, should also be assessed.    
3.79 
Consideration should be given to whether any proposed landscape 
and visual mitigation measures could affect ecological interests.  
This ES chapter should consider inter-relationships with ecological 
matters as appropriate and cross refer to the ES Ecology chapter.     
Traffic, Transport and Access (see Scoping Report Section 5.9) 
3.80 
The ES should include information relating to transport for all 
phases of the proposed development such as estimates of traffic 
movements and vehicle types, including relating to abnormal 
loads, and access and delivery routes.  The applicant is referred to 
the comments of Luton Borough Council, contained in Appendix 2 
of this Opinion, in relation to traffic movements during the 
operational phase, and to comments made by Network Rail with 
regards to the existing level crossing on Stewartby Green Lane. 
The SoS notes that information will be contained in a Transport 
Assessment, if considered appropriate, accompanied by a draft 
Construction Traffic Management Plan.  The SoS recommends that 
these documents are included in the ES as appendices. 
Scoping Opinion for Millbrook Power Project 
 
27 
3.81 
The removal of waste from the site for all phases of the proposed 
development should be considered and assessed in terms of the 
likely transport routes, the number of journeys and the type of 
vehicles required.  Consideration should be given to including an 
assessment of potential cumulative effects with other projects in 
the area, e.g. the LLRS, that have the potential to generate a high 
number of vehicle movements, with particular regard to HGV 
movements.                 
3.82 
The Scoping Report refers to the roads likely to be used for access 
to the project site as being shown on Figures 1 and 2.  They are 
identified by colour on Figure 2 but not identified in any way on 
Figure 1.  The ES should include a plan on which access routes are 
clearly identifiable.          
3.83 
The SoS welcomes the development of the assessment of 
transport impacts in association with the local highways authorities 
and the Highways Agency (HA). The SoS would expect on-going 
discussions and agreement, where possible, with such bodies. 
3.84 
The SoS notes that opportunities for reducing traffic movements 
will be investigated, and suggests mitigation measures such as 
implementing a travel plan and sourcing materials so as to 
minimise transport could be considered. 
3.85 
The SoS recommends that the ES should take account of the 
location of footpaths and PROWs in the area, including bridleways 
and byways, and clearly set out potential impacts as a result of 
access routes and traffic movements. 
3.86 
The applicant is referred to the comments of the Highways Agency 
in Appendix 2 of this Opinion, in relation to assessment of 
potential access 
routes, abnormal 
loads, and construction 
management and travel plans.   
3.87 
This topic should be cross-referred to the air quality topic chapter 
in the ES, particularly in relation to traffic emissions.       
Cultural Heritage and Archaeology (see Scoping Report Section 
5.10) 
3.88 
The SoS notes that conservation areas are identified by name on 
the list of cultural heritage assets in paragraph 5.10.4, but not 
included in the list in paragraph 5.10.12 of types of assets that will 
be considered in the assessment.  The SoS would expect the 
potential impacts on conservation areas to be identified and 
assessed as part of the EIA.                 
3.89 
The SoS welcomes the applicant’s intention to consult the local 
Councils and English Heritage in relation to the archaeology and 
cultural heritage assessment.       
Scoping Opinion for Millbrook Power Project 
 
28 
3.90 
Paragraph 5.10.2 states that the potential for archaeological 
remains within Rookery South Pit is like to be limited, as a result 
of former works and activities related to the LLRS.  However, the 
SoS notes that the proposed development involves some working 
of previously unworked areas on the project site, and recommends 
that consideration is given to whether further assessment of the 
project site is required, in consultation with relevant Council 
officers. 
3.91 
The SoS expects to see a comprehensive assessment in the ES of 
potential impacts of the proposed development on the setting of 
cultural heritage assets in the area.  The applicant is referred to 
comments made by English Heritage and CBC on this point. 
3.92 
Cross reference from this chapter of the ES should be made to 
other chapters as appropriate, such the Landscape and Visual 
chapter.   
Socio-economics (see Scoping Report Section 5.11) 
3.93 
The SoS recommends that the types of jobs generated should be 
considered in the context of the available workforce in the area.  
This applies equally to the construction and operational stages. 
3.94 
The SoS recommends that the assessment criteria should be 
locationally-specific, and consider the potential significance of the 
impacts of the proposed development within the local and regional 
context. 
3.95 
The SoS draws the applicant’s attention to the comments of 
Ampthill Town Council in Appendix 2 of this Opinion in relation to 
recreational 
facilities 
in 
the 
area, 
and 
recommends 
that 
consideration is given to potential impacts of the proposed 
development on recreational interests.     
Waste (not identified in the Scoping Report) 
3.96 
Although waste has not been identified as a discrete topic there 
are several references to it in the Scoping Report, and the SoS 
notes and welcomes the applicant’s intention to produce a site 
waste management strategy prior to construction which would 
focus on the re-use, recycling and reduction of waste and spoil.   
3.97 
The ES should describe the types of waste generated by the 
project at all stages and describe the method/s of removing it, 
including identifying potential transport routes.  The applicant is 
referred to the comments of Public Health England in Appendix 2 
of this Opinion in relation to the disposal of waste.   
3.98 
Waste should either be addressed in specific ES chapters as 
appropriate, eg Traffic, Transport and Access, or consideration 
given to including a discrete chapter on waste.  
Scoping Opinion for Millbrook Power Project 
 
29 
Electric and Magnetic Fields (not identified in the Scoping Report)       
3.99 
The SoS notes that this proposed development includes a new 
electricity connection, with the configuration and route still to be 
determined.  The applicant is referred to the comments of Public 
Health England in Appendix 2 of this Opinion in relation to 
potential impacts on human health caused by electric and 
magnetic fields.  The SoS recommends that the ES includes an 
assessment of such impacts, and identifies mitigation measures as 
necessary, and suggests that this could be included in a Health 
Impact Assessment if one is undertaken. 
Scoping Opinion for Millbrook Power Project

4.0 OTHER INFORMATION 
4.1 
This section does not form part of the SoS’s Opinion as to the 
information to be provided in the environmental statement. 
However, it does respond to other issues that the SoS has 
identified which may help to inform the preparation of the 
application for the DCO.  
Habitats Regulations Assessment (HRA) 
4.2 
The SoS notes that no information has been provided at this stage 
on the location of European sites but that some may be located 
close to the project.  It is the applicant’s responsibility to provide 
sufficient information to the Competent Authority (CA) to enable 
them to carry out a HRA if required. The applicant should note that 
the CA is the SoS.  
4.3 
The applicant’s attention is drawn to The Infrastructure Planning 
(Applications: Prescribed Forms and Procedure) Regulations 2009 
(as amended) (The APFP Regulations) and the need to include 
information identifying European sites to which the Habitats 
Regulations apply, Ramsar sites or potential SPAs, which may be 
affected by a proposal. The submitted information should be 
sufficient for the competent authority to make an appropriate 
assessment (AA) of the implications for the site if required by 
Regulation 61(1) of the Habitats Regulations. 
4.4 
The report to be submitted under Regulation 5(2)(g) of the APFP 
Regulations with the application must deal with two issues: the 
first is to enable a formal assessment by the CA of whether there 
is a likely significant effect; and the second, should it be required, 
is to enable the carrying out of an AA by the CA.  
4.5 
When considering aspects of the environment likely to be affected 
by the project; including flora, fauna, soil, water, air and the inter-
relationship between these, consideration should be given to the 
designated sites in the vicinity of the project. 
4.6 
Further information with regard to the HRA process is contained 
within Planning Inspectorate’s Advice Note 10 available on the 
National Infrastructure pages on the Planning Portal website.  
Evidence Plans 
4.7 
An evidence plan is a formal mechanism to agree upfront what 
information the applicant needs to supply to the Planning 
Inspectorate as part of a DCO application. An evidence plan will 
help to ensure compliance with the Habitats Regulations. It will be 
particularly relevant to NSIPs where impacts may be complex, 
large volumes of evidence may be needed, or there are a number 
of uncertainties. It will also help applicants meet the requirement 
Scoping Opinion for Millbrook Power Project 
 
31 
to provide sufficient information (as explained in Advice Note 10) 
in their application, so the Examining Authority can recommend to 
the Secretary of State whether or not to accept the application for 
examination and whether an appropriate assessment is required. 
4.8 
Any applicant of a proposed NSIP in England, or England and 
Wales, can request an evidence plan. A request for an evidence 
plan should be made at the start of the pre-application stage (eg, 
after notifying the Planning Inspectorate on an informal basis) by 
contacting the Major Infrastructure and Environment Unit (MIEU) 
in Defra (MIEU@defra.gsi.gov.uk). 
Sites of Special Scientific Interest (SSSIs) 
4.9 
The Secretary of State notes that a number of SSSIs are located 
close to or within the project. Where there may be potential 
impacts on the SSSIs, the SoS has duties under sections 28(G) 
and 28(I) of the Wildlife and Countryside Act 1981 (as amended) 
(the W&C Act). These are set out below for information. 
4.10 
Under s28(G), the SoS has a general duty ‘… to take reasonable 
steps, consistent with the proper exercise of the authority’s 
functions, to further the conservation and enhancement of the 
flora, fauna or geological or physiographical features by reason of 
which the site is of special scientific interest’.   
4.11 
Under 
s28(I), 
the 
SoS 
must 
notify 
the 
relevant 
nature 
conservation body (NCB), JNCC/NE/NRW in this case, before 
authorising the carrying out of operations likely to damage the 
special interest features of a SSSI. Under these circumstances 
28 days must elapse before deciding whether to grant consent, 
and the SoS must take account of any advice received from the 
NCB, including advice on attaching conditions to the consent. The 
NCB will be notified during the examination period.  
4.12 
If applicants consider it likely that notification may be necessary 
under s28(I), they are advised to resolve any issues with the NCB 
before the DCO application is submitted to the SoS. If, following 
assessment by applicants, it is considered that operations affecting 
the SSSI will not lead to damage of the special interest features, 
applicants should make this clear in the ES. The application 
documents submitted in accordance with Regulation 5(2)(l) could 
also provide this information. Applicants should seek to agree with 
the NCB the DCO requirements which will provide protection for 
the SSSI before the DCO application is submitted. 
European Protected Species (EPS) 
4.13 
Applicants should be aware that the decision maker under the 
Planning Act 2008 (PA 2008) has, as the CA, a duty to engage 
with the Habitats Directive. Where a potential risk to an EPS is 
identified, and before making a decision to grant development 
Scoping Opinion for Millbrook Power Project 
 
32 
consent, the CA must, amongst other things, address the 
derogation tests2 in Regulation 53 of the Habitats Regulations. 
Therefore the applicant may wish to provide information which will 
assist the decision maker to meet this duty.  
4.14 
If an applicant has concluded that an EPS licence is required the 
ExA will need to understand whether there is any impediment to 
the licence being granted. The decision to apply for a licence or 
not will rest with the applicant as the person responsible for 
commissioning the proposed activity by taking into account the 
advice of their consultant ecologist. 
4.15 
Applicants are encouraged to consult with NE and, where required, 
to agree appropriate requirements to secure necessary mitigation. 
It would assist the examination if applicants could provide, with 
the application documents, confirmation from NE whether any 
issues have been identified which would prevent the EPS licence 
being granted. 
4.16 
Generally, NE are unable to grant an EPS licence in respect of any 
development until all the necessary consents required have been 
secured in order to proceed. For NSIPs, NE will assess a draft 
licence application in order to ensure that all the relevant issues 
have been addressed. Within 30 working days of receipt, NE will 
either issue ‘a letter of no impediment’ stating that it is satisfied, 
insofar as it can make a judgement, that the proposals presented 
comply with the regulations or will issue a letter outlining why NE 
consider the proposals do not meet licensing requirements and 
what further information is required before a ‘letter of no 
impediment’ can be issued.  The applicant is responsible for 
ensure draft licence applications are satisfactory for the purposes 
of informing formal pre-application assessment by NE.

Ecological conditions on the site may change over time. It will be 
the applicant’s responsibility to ensure information is satisfactory 
for the purposes of informing the assessment of no detriment to 
the maintenance of favourable conservation status (FCS) of the 
population of EPS affected by the proposals3. Applicants are 
advised that current conservation status of populations may or 
may not be favourable. Demonstration of no detriment to 
favourable 
populations may require 
further survey and/or 
submission 
of 
revised 
short 
or 
long 
term 
mitigation 
or 
compensation proposals. In England the focus concerns the 
provision of up to date survey information which is then made 
available to NE (along with any resulting amendments to the draft

In England or English Waters, assistance may be obtained from 
the Consents Service Unit.  The Unit works with applicants to 
coordinate key non-planning consents associated with nationally 
significant infrastructure projects. The Unit’s remit includes EPS 
licences. The service is free of charge and entirely voluntary. 
Further information is available from the following link:

advice/consents-service-unit/  
Health Impact Assessment  
4.19 
The SoS considers that it is a matter for the applicant to decide 
whether or not to submit a stand-alone Health Impact Assessment 
(HIA). However, the applicant should have regard to the responses 
received from the relevant consultees regarding health, and in 
particular to the comments from the Health and Safety Executive, 
Public Health England, and National Grid in relation to electric and 
magnetic fields and electrical and gas safety issues (see Appendix 
2). 
4.20 
The methodology for the HIA, if prepared, should be agreed with 
the relevant statutory consultees and take into account mitigation 
measures for acute risks. 
Other regulatory regimes 
4.21 
The SoS recommends that the applicant should state clearly what 
regulatory areas are addressed in the ES and that the applicant 
should ensure that all relevant authorisations, licences, permits 
and consents that are necessary to enable operations to proceed 
are described in the ES. Also it should be clear that any likely 
significant effects of the project which may be regulated by other 
statutory regimes have been properly taken into account in the 
ES. 
4.22 
It will not necessarily follow that the granting of consent under one 
regime will ensure consent under another regime. For those 
consents not capable of being included in an application for 
consent under the PA 2008, the SoS will require a level of 
assurance or comfort from the relevant regulatory authorities that 
the proposal is acceptable and likely to be approved, before they 
Scoping Opinion for Millbrook Power Project

make a recommendation or decision on an application. The 
applicant is encouraged to make early contact with other 
regulators. Information from the applicant about progress in 
obtaining other permits, licences or consents, including any 
confirmation that there is no obvious reason why these will not 
subsequently be granted, will be helpful in supporting an 
application for development consent to the SoS. 
Transboundary Impacts  
4.23 
The SoS has noted that the applicant has not indicated whether 
the project is likely to have significant impacts on another 
European Economic Area (EEA) State.  
4.24 
Regulation 24 of the EIA Regulations, which inter alia require the 
SoS to publicise a DCO application if the SoS is of the view that 
the proposal is likely to have significant effects on the environment 
of another EEA state and where relevant to consult with the EEA 
state affected. The SoS considers that where Regulation 24 
applies, this is likely to have implications for the examination of a 
DCO application.  
4.25 
The SoS recommends that the ES should identify whether the 
project has the potential for significant transboundary impacts and 
if so, what these are and which EEA States would be affected.

Alison L Down 
EIA & Land Rights Adviser 
On behalf of the Secretary of State 
 
Dear Ms Down 
 
Application by Millbrook Power Ltd for an Order Granting Development Consent for the 
Millbrook Power Project 
 
Ampthill Town Council as a consultation body has the following comments to make in regard to the 
Millbrook Power Project: 
 
Cooper’s Hill (SSSI) 
Cooper’s Hill is a nature reserve owned by Ampthill Town Council and managed by the Wildlife Trust. 
It is a site of special scientific interest and the best remaining example in Bedfordshire of the once more 
extensive heathland on the Greensand ridge. Where Ampthill clay reaches the surface on the edge of the 
site, springs occur, supporting rich marsh plant communities. Within this small area are locally 
uncommon plant species (this is the only location for marsh violets in Bedfordshire) and a type of 
habitat very rare in the county. The adverse effect caused by emissions on Cooper’s Hill is of concern to 
us. Sulphur di-oxide and Nitrogen Dioxide, both contributing to acid rain and hampering the growth of 
plants will have an adverse impact. There is also a health risk from dioxins via the food chain and this 
too is of concern to us, being a farming area. 
 
We would need reassurance of how these emissions are to be monitored and procedures in the event of 
the monitoring system failing. 
 
Visual Quality 
 
Sheer size of the building will dominate the skyline – most of which will be visible above the edge 
of Rookery Pit.  
 
The size of the plant will have a major impact on the visual quality of the landscape and will 
adversely impair the views from the Vale to the surrounding Greensand Ridge and the panoramic 
views from the ridge, especially those seen from Ampthill Great Park a Grade II listed historic park 
and Houghton House ruins, a Grade I English Heritage site. 
 
The building and four chimneys will be seen very clearly from Katherine’s Cross, which is 
surrounded by a Scheduled Ancient Monument area in Ampthill Park and will not blend into the 
landscape.  
 
 
2 
 
Local policy seeks to protect, conserve and enhance the County’s scheduled ancient monuments, 
conservation areas, parks and gardens and their settings. The proposed EFW is contrary to these 
policies. 
 
The facility could attract additional industrial activity which would further alter the rural character 
of the Vale. 
Biodiversity and Geological Conservation 
 
The surrounding villages are all within a rural landscape populated by residents who wish to 
preserve their rural way of life. 
 
To situate the facility within Rookery Pit and in close proximity to the Marston Vale Millennium 
Country Park – a primary purpose of which is to re-forest the Marston Vale – would be a retrograde 
step ecologically and lead to significant habitat loss and ultimately the industrialisation of Rookery 
Pit. 
Socio-Economic 
 
We are not convinced that the proposed facility will enhance the local economy as only 15 full time 
jobs have been identified. 
 
There will be a detrimental effect on existing property prices which in turn will depress economic 
activity and undermine the ambition of local communities to develop as tourist destinations. 
Ampthill Park 
 
Ampthill Town Council has just received a grant of £606,800 from the Heritage Lottery Fund (HLF) 
and the Big Lottery Fund for Ampthill Great Park. The project aims to further investigate, restore and 
enhance the Park’s landscape, historic and heritage features, whilst ensuring it meets the needs of its 
current and future visitors. 
Ampthill Great Park has a significant heritage and serves the people of the town and surrounding areas 
with a place for recreation and enjoyment. The grant will enable us to ensure that the park’s landscape 
is enhanced and preserved for the pleasure of future generations. This grant is part of a wider 
investment of £34.5million of Lottery money to 13 parks across the UK. 
 
This application by Millbrook Power Ltd for a power generation plant will have a detrimental effect on 
the restoration work we are carrying out in the Park on this major project. 
 
Conclusion 
The whole of the Vale does not currently contain heavy industry and is a peaceful area of the 
countryside enjoyed by local people and visitors alike for its stunning views. The Forest of Marston 
Vale is one of 12 Community Forests throughout England working to improve the countryside around 
our towns and cities.  
Ampthill Town Council are of the opinion that the Secretary of State should conclude that this proposal 
is the wrong solution to dealing with energy in the proposed catchment area and in the wrong location. 
 
Yours sincerely

Bedford BC - OFFICIAL-Unsecure 
 
Dear Sirs, 
 
Further to your letter dated 20th June 2014 concerning the above proposal Bedford Borough Council 
would like to comment that at this stage the scoping for the Environmental Statement appears 
reasonable but that the Bedford Borough Council will wish to be informed by the applicant’s 
consultants of progress towards the final version of the ES, and will be happy to make available 
information that the council may have to assist in its comprehensive preparation before the 
submission of the planning application. 
 
Initial comments from the council’s Environmental Health Officer are as follows: - 
 
 
“Air Quality 
 
I have no objection to the proposals for the air quality assessment. 
 
I would advise that the assessment makes use of the guidance held within the Environmental 
Protection UK guidance, Development Control: Planning for Air Quality. 
 
Noise 
 
With regards to the proposed noise assessment, I would like to emphasise that the noise from the 
operation of the plant should be assessed in line with BS4142.  
 
BS8233 and the WHO guidance relate to anonymous noise sources, this is not an anonymous noise 
source and as such, in line with the guidance within BS8233, the assessment should be in line with 
BS4142. 
 
I do not believe that the draft IEMA/IOA guidance should be used for determining significance. The 
guidance has been published in a number of draft forms and as such only gives possible examples of 
significance criteria as part of the consultation, rather than any firm criteria. 
 
I am surprised that the noise contribution arising from electrical connections has been scoped out at 
this stage. Given the low frequency and highly tonal nature of noise associated with this, and the 
potential for a significant impact, even at low decibel levels, I would expect the noise to be assessed.  
 
The proposed construction and decommissioning, noise and vibration assessment, should not limit 
itself to NSR’s within 100m of construction activities, but should look at all NSR’s that will be affected 
by the activities.  
 
With regards to possible mitigation, the development is located very near to South Pillinge farm. 
Alternative locations within the pit should be considered.” 
 
I hope that these preliminary comments will assist in the preparation of the ES and I repeat the offer 
that the council will wish to assist and participate as far as it can in achieving a high quality 
Environmental Statement in conjunction with Central Bedfordshire Council within whose district the 
bulk of the development is located. 
 
With kind regards,

Subject: Millbrook Power ltd. Scoping  
 
Thank you for consulting the Canal & River Trust with regard to EIA scoping for the DCO for 
the proposed Millbrook Power Development.  
  
The Canal & River Trust (the Trust) is the guardian of 2,000 miles of historic waterways 
across England and Wales.  We are among the largest charities in the UK, maintaining the 
nation’s third largest collection of listed structures, as well as museums, archives, 
navigations and hundreds of important wildlife sites.  Following the transfer of functions from 
British Waterways to the Trust in 2012, we are a statutory consultee in the development 
management process and are consulted on both local and neighbourhood plans as well as 
NSIPS. 
  
The Trust do not own or maintain any canals in the area of the development site but we are 
a member of in the Bedford Milton Keynes Waterway Trust Partnership who seek to create a 
new stretch of waterway. The B&MK Waterway Trust was established in 1995 to promote 
the development of a broad waterway which will link the Grand Union Canal in Milton 
Keynes to the river Great Ouse in Bedford through a series of waterway parks. It will include 
pathways and green space designed to meet the needs of walkers, cyclists, fishermen, and 
those who simply like to stand and stare. 
  
We fully support the work of the Bedford to Milton Keynes Waterway Trust who, with a range 
of other partners including Local Authorities and the Environment Agency, are seeking to 
promote a Waterway Park linking the River Ouse in Bedford with the Grand Union Canal in 
Milton Keynes. The proposal is strongly supported locally and the route of the proposed 
Waterway Park is safeguarded in the relevant Local Plans. 
  
The Canal & River Trust note your that the proposed site is some distance from the 
safeguarded route of the Waterway Park, but because of its strategic nature Millbrook Power 
is likely to have wider implications for the Marston Vale.  We wish to ensure that you are 
aware of the project and its safeguarded route to ensure that the project, or subsequent 
supporting work such as pipe lines, do not have an adverse impact on the proposal.    
  
The Trust will in due course register our interest but if you feel it may be beneficial to meet at 
any time please do not hesitate to contact me. I understand that the Bedford & Milton 
Keynes Trust will also contact you and will wish to discuss possible opportunities for joint 
initiatives. If we are able to assist with this in any way we would welcome the opportunity to 
become involved. 
  
Please ensure that I am listed as your contact within the Canal & River Trust, using the 
details below, rather than sending documents to our Head Office Milton Keynes.

Dear Sir/Madam,
Application No:
CB/14/02453/OAC
Location:
The Rookery Pit (south), Near Stewartby, Bedfordshire
Proposal:
Other Authority Consultation: EIA Scoping Report  for The Millbrook
Power Project (Gas Power Station)
I refer to your letter dated 20th June 2014 and registered on that date requesting comments
on the Scoping Opinion for the Millbrook Power Project at Rookery Pit (South).
The Local Planning Authority has assessed the submitted Scoping report and makes the
following comments with regard to the content of the proposed Environmental Statement.
Submitted Scoping Report.
The Local Planning Authority generally agrees with the content of the submitted Scoping
report but considers that internal consultees have identified further scope that should be
included within the Environmental Assessment. These are listed below:
CBC Ecological Officer
The Council's Ecologist has assessed the Scoping Report submitted and is satisfied that the
suite of surveys proposed and the assumed baseline will adequately inform the EIA.
CBC Archaeological Officer
The bulk of the proposed development is located within Rookery Pit (HER 6681),one of the
clay pits that provided the raw material for Stewartby Brickworks during the 20th century. In
the wider project site area there are a number of known archaeological sites and features.
On the south western edge of the existing clay pit is an Iron Age and Roman settlement
(HER 19806) and to the south of that is a ring ditch known from aerial photography(HER
16566), which on morphological grounds is likely to be the remains of a Bronze Age funerary
monument. There are also other as yet uncharacterised cropmark features within this area
(HER 4469 and HER 9077), some of these may represent land boundaries of unknown date
but frequently such cropmarks have been shown to belong to later prehistoric and Roman
settlements. On the eastern boundary of the site is a scatter of medieval pottery has been
found possibly indicating occupation of that period (HER 15892). These are heritage assets
with archaeological interest as defined by the National Planning Policy Framework (NPPF).
Archaeological survey and research in the wider Marston Vale has been limited. However,
recent investigations in advance of housing development at Stewartby to the north, a road
scheme on the northern edge of the Marston Vale and along the route of various pipelines to
the south and east have started to identify a range of previously unidentified sites within the
Vale dating from the prehistoric to medieval periods. These sites are often difficult to detect
remotely and can only be identified through intrusive investigation and suggest that the Vale
contained a much more extensive settlement pattern than had previously been thought.
Therefore, the wider project area has the potential to contain so far unidentified
archaeological sites and features dating from the prehistoric period.
The proposed development site is also located within the setting of a number of Scheduled
Monuments including amongst others Houghton House (HER 729 and SM 1013522) and
Ampthill Castle (HER 810 and SM 10009630) in Greensand Ridge to the south, Thrupp End
medieval settlement and moated sites (HER 31 and SM 1010364) to the west, The Rectory
Moated site HER 3236 and SM 1009588), Houghton Conquest to the east and Ampthill Park
(HER 1369 and RPG 10000378). Under the terms of the NPPF these are designated
heritage assets of the highest importance. Development within the setting of these
designated heritage assets will have an impact on their significance.
The submitted Scoping Report rightly identifies cultural heritage and archaeology as one of
the topic areas to be covered in the Environmental Impact Assessment. It notes that main
development is in Rookery Pit and that excavation of the clay will have reduced its potential
to contain archaeological remains (5.10.2). This is correct, however, the clay pit itself is of
considerable industrial archaeological importance in its association with Stewartby
Brickworks. The remains of the brick making industry in the Marston Vale are of national and
regional importance. The EIA should deal with the impact of the proposal on the remains of
the Rookery Pit clay pit. It should also be noted that the permitted southern extension of the
clay pit, proposed for extraction in this scheme, contains the remains of an Iron Age and
Roman settlement (HER 19806). The potential of the gas and electrical connections outside
Rookery Pit to impact on buried archaeological remains is acknowledged. The potential of
the development to affect the setting of designated heritage assets is identified and, from an
archaeological perspective, the list of sites is comprehensive.
It is proposed that the baseline information for the EIA should be collected by means of a
desk-based assessment, using the relevant Institute for Archaeologists' standards and
guidance document as the basis for the assessment. This is an appropriate standard for a
desk-based assessment. It is stated that no intrusive investigation is proposed at this stage
(5.10.16). In the gas and electrical connection opportunity area any underground
connections will impact on archaeological remains and affect the significance of the heritage
assets with archaeological interest. Given the potential for this area to contain as yet
unidentified archaeological remains the CBC Archaeological Officer considers that the
collection of baseline information on archaeology for the gas and electrical connections
should include an archaeological field evaluation comprising geophysical survey and trial
trenching of the selected connection routes. The proposals for collecting baseline information
on the setting of designated heritage assets seem reasonable. The Environmental Statement
should contain sufficient visual information to be able to assess the impact on the setting of
these assets including from the monuments and into them from a variety of locations,
including view sites on the Greensand Ridge from the northern edge of the Marston Vale.
The EIA should also deal with the cumulative impact of the various other developments in
the surrounding area in relation to this proposal on archaeology and the historic environment.
Mitigation of the impact of the proposed development on archaeology and the historic
environment is dealt with in paragraphs 5.10.17 and 5.10.18. Although there are no specific
mitigation proposals although number of options including the preservation of any important
archaeological remains in situ, the investigation of others in advance of development and the
use of screen planting to minimise the impact on the setting of designated assets. Though it
is not possible to establish what an appropriate mitigation strategy might be until the baseline
information has been established, this suite of options should provide a reasonable solution.
CBC Highways Officer - Development Control
In a highway context this proposal has the potential for major impact on the surrounding
highway network. Nevertheless the CBC Highways Officer notes from the information
supplied that the highway issues will be considered and addressed within the Transport
Assessment and Travel Plan which will form part of any future submission. This is
considered acceptable.
CBC Landscape Officer
The CBC Landscape Officer has considered the information submitted within the Scoping
Report and states in terms of the assessment of cumulative impact - although mentioned in
the landscape section, the wind turbine at the Millenium Country Park is not listed as one of
the developments to be part of this study. This should be included. In addition to the turbines
at Brogborough, there is the potential for a further turbine at Stewartby landfill site, within
Bedfordshire Borough Council area.
In terms of viewpoints it would be helpful to have a viewpoint from the crest of Ampthill Hill as
this provides an oblique viewpoint over the Vale.
The EIA would need to provide details of the landscape mitigation, including any proposed
off site planting. (This has not been referred to within the report but should be fully
considered as a mitigation method). Details of the acoustic screen for the above ground
installations would be required. The colour palette would also be an important factor in terms
of mitigation. Depending on the building structure, mitigation should also include techniques
such as green roofs.
The Design and Access Statement would need to clarify the site selection process in terms
of the proposal's position within Rookery Pit . The relationship with the Covanta RRF,
including the strategic landscape planting and features such as waterbodies, would also
require clarification.
CBC Minerals and Waste
The CBC Minerals and Waste Officer has made the following comments on the Scoping
Report submitted.
Section 2.7 of the EIA Scoping report deals with Local Planning Policy. This section makes
no mention of the Minerals and Waste Local Plan: Strategic sites and Policies LDD which
was adopted by Bedford borough, Central Bedfordshire and Luton borough councils in
January 2014. It is part of the development plan for this authority. In the MWLP:SSP
Rookery South is identified in Waste Strategic Policy WSP2 as one of four sites for waste
recovery uses. It is also additionally identified as a site for the landfilling of non-hazardous
waste. These strategic sites are locations where large scale recovery operations should take
place and are defined as having a throughput of more than 75,000 tonnes per annum. The
Strategic Site at Rookery south is identified on a plan on page 80 and on table 17 on pages
81-82 there is information set out about this site.
A copy of the MWLP:SSP can be found on the CBC website.
Rookery Pit south is already the location of the proposed Resource Recovery Facility
(Covanta Energy Limited) for which a Development Consent Order was issued in February
2013. Whilst no progress has been made in discharging any pre-commencement conditions
as the American parent company decided to withdraw from the UK shortly after the DCO was
issued. However the consent runs for 5 years and so there is the potential for it to be
implemented up to February 2018. The site of the Resource Recovery Facility is immediately
to the north of that of the proposed power station in rookery Pit south and they would share
the access road into the pit from Green Lane.
A screening opinion was undertaken on behalf of both CBC and BBC in 2013 which related
to its use for both waste recovery and landfill purposes.
It is noted that paragraph 4.3.2 states that the cumulative impact will take into account the
Covanta RRS, the low level restoration scheme for the Rookery pits and the waste
management operations at Rookery pit south. Certainly the cumulative impact in terms of
traffic could be significant and landscape and ecology too. However, it is not possible to
comment further on this at this stage.
The CBC Minerals and Waste Officer is unclear whether the power station proposal might
adversely impact on the use of the remainder of the pit for waste recovery purposes or for
non hazardous waste landfill particularly with regard to the Electrical and Gas connection
areas covering part of the pit.
CBC Public Protection
The CBC Public Protection Officer has assessed the Scoping report submitted and has
made the following comments on the content.
�
Operational noise from fixed plant should be assessed using BS4142. I don't agree with
     the implication that BS8233 should be used as this standard concerns anonymous noise
     sources.
�
Draft guidance should not be used (e.g. 'Guidelines on Noise Impact Assessment')
�
Noise from the Electrical Connection should be included in any noise assessment and
     should not be scoped out prior ro undertaking any baseline noise monitoring or not  
     knowing what equipment will be selected.
�
Careful consideration should be given to design, layout, orientation and site location in
mitigating/managing any noise sources. One form of mitigation which was not mentioned
in the Scoping report is that of distance from receptors. The site chosen for the power
station is only 90m from South Pillinge Farm even though there appears to be plenty of
scope to resite the building at a more distant location.
The information given in terms of Air Quality look satisfactory.
CBC Conservation Officer
Section 5.10 sets out how the effects on cultural heritage and archaeological assets will be
carried out.
5.10.12 states how the study is to be set out when considering cultural heritage assets and
the method is considered acceptable in principle.
The project site boundary abuts a collection of cultural heritage sites which have been
marked on Figure 3.
Initial concerns will be the visual impact the proposed “stacks” will have on the surrounding
areas. The proximity to the listed chimney stacks of the closed Stewartby Brickworks (LBC)
will need consideration. The industrial heritage of the area has been recognised by the
listing of these stacks and any impact on this will need to be considered.
CBC Sustainable Growth Officer
The climate change risk has been widely recognised and the scooping document itself
acknowledges this by listing the UK Climate Change Risk Assessment 2012 as one of the
relevant planning and guidance documents. The EIA assessment should therefore cover
synergistic and cumulative impacts of the Millbrook Power Station project and climate
change on natural environment, particularly on water quality, water resources, ecology and
air quality.
Additional Case Officer Notes
In terms of the legislative and Planning Policy context this should include the emerging
Development Strategy for Central Bedfordshire that is currently out to public consultation.
This will be given greater material weight as the process continues. This is noted within the
Scoping Report in Section 2.
The Minerals and Waste Local Plan: Strategic sites and Policies LDD which was adopted by
Bedford Borough, Central Bedfordshire and Luton Borough Councils in January 2014 should
be fully considered and referenced within the EIA, and they should form part of the
Regulatory and Policy Background.

Lisa Newlands

FW: Millbrook Power Project Scoping Request
Attachments:
140620_EN010068_Millbrook Power Project.pdf
Dear Sirs, 
 
Proposed Millbrook Power Project – Scoping Comment 
 
Thank you for The Planning Inspectorate’s recent correspondence relating to the subject 
development.  The Inspectorate sought related Civil Aviation Authority (CAA) scoping comment; I 
trust the following is useful. 
 
I note from the Scoping Report (SR) that the tallest associated structures are expected to be 
between 1 and 5 chimney stacks that would each have a height of up to 60metres (m).  On that 
basis I belief the following (potential) issues are worthy of consideration: 
 Aerodromes.  In respect of any potential aerodrome related issue, I should highlight the 
need to check any safeguarding maps lodged with relevant planning authorities to identify 
any aerodrome specific safeguarding issues.  To that effect, I note the close proximity of 
Cranfield Airport to the development site.  Noting that aerodrome safeguarding 
responsibility rests in all cases with the relevant aerodrome operator / licensee, not the 
CAA, it is important that the related viewpoints of any relevant aerodrome license holders / 
operators is established and any concerns expressed appropriately mitigated. 
 Aviation Warning Lighting:   
o In the UK, the need for aviation obstruction lighting on 'tall' structures depends in the 
first instance upon any particular structure's location in relationship to an aerodrome. If 
the structure constitutes an 'aerodrome obstruction' it is the aerodrome operator that 
with review the lighting requirement. For civil aerodromes, they will, in general terms, 
follow the requirements of CAP 168 - Licensing of Aerodromes. This document can be 
downloaded from the Civil Aviation CAA website at 
www.caa.co.uk/docs/33/CAP168.PDF - Chapter 4 (12.8) refers to obstacle lighting.  
o Away from aerodromes Article 219 of the UK Air Navigation Order applies. This Article 
requires that for en-route obstructions (ie away from aerodromes) lighting only 
becomes legally mandated for structures of a height of 150m or more. However, 
structures of lesser high might need aviation obstruction lighting if, by virtue of their 
location and nature, they are considered a significant navigational hazard.  
o Cranes, whether in situ temporarily or long term are captured by the points heighted 
above.  Note that if a crane is located on top of another structure, it is the overall height 
(structure + crane) than is relevant. 
o In this case, given the assumed maximum height of 60m, Article 219 would not 
apply.  In the event that there is no aerodrome issue I can advise that the CAA would 
not in isolation make any case for lighting. 
 Gas Venting and/or Flaring.  It is assumed that the facility is not intended to vent or flare 
gas either routinely or as an emergency procedure such as to cause a danger to overlying 
2
aircraft.  If that is not the case parties are invited to use myself as an appropriate point of 
contact for any further related discussion. 
 Aviation Promulgation.  There is a civil aviation requirement in the UK for all structures over 
300 feet high to be charted on aviation maps.  It follows that, at 60m (197ft) high, there is 
no en-route (ie non-aerodrome specific) civil aviation charting requirement.  However, if 
crane usage in the construction phase involves heights of 300ft or more, the temporary 
structure will need to be appropriately notified.  For temporary structures this notification 
can be achieved through the publication of a Notice to Airmen (NOTAM).  If needed by 
virtue of temporary use of cranes such that the 300ft threshold is breached a NOTAM can 
be arranged through the developer providing related details to the CAA’s Airspace 
Utilisation Section (ausops@caa.co.uk / 0207 453 6599).   
 Military Aviation.  For completeness, the Ministry of Defence position in regards to the 
proposed development and military aviation activity should be established. 
 I should also add that that due to the unique nature of associated operations in respect of 
operating altitudes and potentially unusual landing sites, it would also be sensible to 
establish the related viewpoint of local emergency services air support units.      
   
I believe that any associated Environmental Statement / Development Consent Order (or 
equivalent / similar) would be expected to acknowledge and where applicable address the issues 
highlighted above and accordingly the scoping opinion should make related comment. 
 
Whilst none of the above negates any aforementioned need to consult in line with Government 
requirements associated with the safeguarding of aerodromes and other technical sites 
(Government Circular 1/2003 refers), I hope this information matches your requirements.  Please 
do not hesitate to get in touch if you require any further comment or needs clarification of any 
point.

PRECAUTIONS TO BE TAKEN WHEN CARRYING OUT WORK IN THE VICINITY OF UNDERGROUND GAS PIPES  
ADVICE TO SITE PERSONNEL 
MANAGEMENT NOTE  
Please ensure that a copy of this note is read by your site management and to your site operatives.  
Early consultation with ESP Utilities Group prior to excavation is recommended to obtain the location of plant and precautions to be 
taken when working nearby. 
This Guidance Note should be read in conjunction with the Health and Safety Executive guidance HSG47 "Avoiding danger from 
underground services". 
 
Introduction  
Damage to ESP Utilities Group’s plant can result in uncontrolled gas escapes which may be dangerous.  In addition these 
occurrences can cause expense, disruption of work and inconvenience to the public.  
Various materials are used for gas mains and services.  Cast Iron, Ductile Iron, Steel and Plastic pipes are the most widely found.  
Modern Plastic pipes are either bright yellow or orange in colour.  
Cast Iron and Ductile Iron water pipes are very similar in appearance to Cast Iron and Ductile Iron gas pipes and if any Cast Iron or 
Ductile Iron pipe is uncovered, it should be treated as a gas pipe.  ESP Utilities Group do not own any metallic gas pipes but their gas 
network infrastructures may be connected to Cast Iron, Ductile Iron or Steel pipes owned by Transco.  
The following general precautions apply to Intermediate Pressure (2-7barg MOP), Medium Pressure (75mbarg-2barg MOP), Low 
Pressure (up to 75mbarg MOP) and other gas mains and services likely to be encountered in genera! site works and are referred to 
within this document as ‘pipes’.  
Locating Gas Pipes 
It should be assumed when working in urban and residential areas that gas mains and services are l kely to be present.  On request, 
ESP Utilities Group will give approximate locations of pipes derived from their records. The records do not normally show the position 
of service pipes but their probable line can be deducted from the gas meter position. ESP Utilities Group’s staff will be pleased to 
assist in the location of gas plant and provide advice on any precautions that may be required.  The records and advice are given in 
good faith but cannot be guaranteed until hand excavation has taken place.  Proprietary pipe and cable locators are available 
although generally these will not locate plastic pipes.  
Safe working Practices  
To achieve safe working conditions adjacent to gas plant the following must be observed: 
Observe any specific request made by ESP Utilities Group’s staff.  
Gas pipes must be located by hand digging before mechanical excavation. Once a gas pipe has been located, mechanical excavation 
must proceed with care.  A mechanical excavator must not in any case be used within 0.5 metre of a gas pipe and greater safety 
distances may be advised by ESP Utilities Group depending on the mains maximum operating pressure (MOP). 
Where heavy plant may have to cross the line of a gas pipe during construction work, the number of crossing points should be kept to 
a minimum. Crossing points should be clearly indicated and crossings at other places along the line of the pipe should be prevented.  
Where the pipe is not adequately protected by an existing road, crossing points should be suitably reinforced with sleepers, steel 
plates or a specially constructed reinforced concrete raft as necessary.  ESP Utilities Group staff will advise on the type of 
reinforcement necessary.  
No explosives should be used within 30 metres of any gas pipe without prior consultation with ESP Utilities Group.  
ESP Utilities Group must be consulted prior to carrying out excavation work within 10 metres of any above ground gas 
installation.  
Where it is proposed to carry out piling or boring within 15 metres of any gas pipe, ESP Utilities Group should be consulted prior to the 
commencement of the works.  
Access to gas plant must be maintained at all times during on site works.

Proximity of Other Plant  
A minimum clearance of 300 millimetres (mm) should be allowed between any plant being installed and an existing gas main to 
facilitate repair, whether the adjacent plant be parallel to or crossing the gas pipe.  No apparatus should be laid over and along the 
line of a gas pipe irrespective of clearance.  
No manhole or chambers shall be built over or around a gas pipe and no work should be carried out which results in a reduction of 
cover or protection over a pipe, without consultation with ESP Utilities Group.  
Support and Backfill 
Where excavation of trenches adjacent to any pipe affects its support, the pipe must be supported to the satisfaction of ESP Utilities 
Group and must not be used as an anchor or support in any way.  In some cases, it may be necessary to divert the gas pipe before 
work commences.  
Where a trench is excavated crossing or parallel to the line of the gas pipe, the backfill should be adequately compacted, particularly 
beneath the pipe, to prevent any settlement which could subsequently cause damage to the pipe.  
In special cases it may be necessary to provide permanent support to the gas pipe, before backfilling and reinstatement is carried out. 
Backfill material adjacent to gas plant must be selected fine material or sand, containing no stones, bricks or lumps of concrete, etc., 
placed to a minimum depth of 150mm around the pipes and well compacted by hand. No power compaction should take place until 
300 mm of selected fine fill has been suitably compacted.  
If the road construction is in close proximity to the top of the gas pipe, a "cushion" of selected fine material such as sand must be used 
to prevent the traffic shock being transmitted to the gas pipe.  The road construction depth must not be reduced without permission 
from the local Highway Authority.  
No concrete or other hard material must be placed or left under or adjacent to any Cast Iron pipe as this may cause fracture of the 
pipe at a later date.  
Concrete backfill should not be used closer than 300 mm to the pipe.  
Damage to Coating  
Where a gas pipe is coated with special wrapping and this is damaged, even to a minor extent ESP Utilities Group must be notified so 
that repairs can be made to prevent future corrosion and subsequent leakage.  
Welding or "Hot Works"  
When welding or other "hot works" involving naked flames are to be carried out in close proximity to gas plant and the presence of gas 
is suspected, ESP Utilities Group must be contacted before work commences to check the atmosphere.  Even when a gas free 
atmosphere exists care must be taken when carrying out hot works in close proximity to gas plant in order to ensure that no damage 
occurs.  
Particular care must be taken to avoid damage by heat or naked flame to plastic gas pipes or to the protective coating on other gas 
pipes. Leakage from Gas Mains or Services  
If damage or leakage is caused or an escape of gas is smelt or suspected the following action should be taken at once: 
  
 
Remove all personnel from the immediate vicinity of the escape; 
 
Contact Transco's National Gas Escape Call Centre, on: 0800 111 999; 
 
Prevent any approach by the public, proh bit smoking, extinguish all naked flames or other source of ignition for at least  
15 metres from the leakage;  
 
Assist gas personnel, Police or Fire Service as requested.  
REMEMBER – IF IN DOUBT, SEEK ADVICE FROM ESP UTILITIES GROUP.

Dear Ms Down, 
 
 
Application Millbrook Power Project – Scoping consultation 
 
The Forestry Commission as the Government Department with responsibility for trees and 
woodland have examined the Environmental Impact Scoping report. We are aware of the 
modest amount of woodland on site of some 2.4 ha, and there is woodland around the site. 
The scoping report as such only deals with what is there currently and we would be interested 
in any proposals in later stages to increase woodland coverage as part of any landscaping and 
screening. 
 
Both planting and felling of trees could constitute “afforestation or deforestation” under the 
Environmental Impact Assessment (Forestry) (England and Wales) Regulations 1999 (Statutory 
Instrument No. 2228/1999) for which the Forestry Commission is the competent authority, and 
may therefore require consent from the Forestry Commissioners  - a summary of the 
regulations is in the annex to this letter. 
 
Government policy is seeking to increase woodland cover to some 2000ha per annum and we 
are aware of the ambition for the Forest of Marston Vale which is close to this therefore we 
hope that the developers will seek to avoid any deforestation. Should this be a requirement we 
would like to see compensatory new plantings in the ratio of at least 4:1 i.e. four trees planted 
to one removed, this precedent having been set in other planning applications. 
While no felling is indicated so far we would remind developers that if planning consent is 
granted then this precludes the requirements for felling licences, however, until consent is 
given, trees cannot be felled without the issuing of a Felling Licence from the Forestry 
Commission. 
Should any deforestation require compensatory plantings we would also like to  the suggest 
that proposers think about the long term management of any woodland created and consider 
ensuring an appropriate woodland management plan is in place should the project go ahead.

Annex 
 
Forestry Authorities carrying out an EIA under the Town and Country Planning (Environmental 
Impact Assessment) (England and Wales) Regulations 1999 (Statutory Instrument No. 
293/1999) must  inform the Forestry Commission of the conclusions reached in 
considering any afforestation or deforestation. (The context of guidance issued by the 
European Commission in 2008 is helpful in determining which regulations may apply. 
 http://ec.europa.eu/environment/eia/pdf/interpretation_eia.pdf )  
  
In the light of this response the FC will then be in a position to determine whether or not 
consent from the Forestry Commissioners may be required.  In the event that the 
Commissioners’ consent is required then the FC would have to consider the impact of 
the project as a whole i.e. including all the development. Not just that arising from 
impact on any woodland. This arises from a judgement in 2007 by the High 
Court http://www.bailii.org/cgi-

Dear Ms Down 
 
 
 
SCOPING CONSULTATION ON APPLICATION BY MILLBROOK LTD FOR AN 
ORDER GRANTING DEVELOPMENT CONSENT FOR THE MILLBROOK POWER 
PROJECT 
 
 
 
Thank you for your letter of 20 June requesting comments from the Highways Agency 
regarding the scoping opinion for the Millbrook Power Application. 
 
I have read the applicants Scoping report and in particular section 5.9 on Transport, I 
have a few comments which I have listed below: 
 
1. I understand that there are currently 2 proposed access routes to the site – one 
being from Junction 13 of the M1. Both access routes need to be assessed in 
line with current guidance – you should be aware of DfT Circular 02/13 and the 
Highways Agency Planning Protocols. I would expect the transport assessment 
to fully assess the impact on the Strategic and Local Road network throughout 
construction, operation and decommissioning periods.  
 
2. Any abnormal loads will need to be discussed and their route agreed either at the 
planning stage or shortly after to ensure that the impact on the road network is 
minimised 
 
3. A construction management plan should be put in place to ensure that the impact 
on the road network is minimised – deliveries to the site should be out of peak 
periods. 
 
4. I would also expect to see a travel plan for staff working at the site to be 
implemented to reduce the number of trips associated with the development.

Dear Sir/Madam, 
 
 
 Planning Act 2008 (as amended) and The Infrastructure Planning (Environmental Impact 
Assessment) Regulations 2009 (as amended) – Regulations 8 and 9  
 
Application by Millbrook Power Ltd for an Order Granting Development Consent for the 
Millbrook Power Project 
 
This is a joint response by National Grid Electricity Transmission plc (NGET) and National Grid Gas plc 
(NGG) 
 
I refer to your letter dated 20th June 2014 regarding the above proposed application. Having 
reviewed the scoping report, I would like to make the following comments: 
 
National Grid Infrastructure within or in close proximity to the Proposed Order Limits 
 
National Grid Electricity Transmission 
National Grid Electricity Transmission has a high voltage electricity overhead transmission lines 
which lie within or in close proximity to the proposed order limits. These lines form an essential part 
of the electricity transmission network in England and Wales and include the following: 
 
 
ZA 400kV Overhead Transmission Line – Grendon- Sundon 
 
The following points should be taken into consideration: 
 
 
National Grid’s Overhead Line/s is protected by a Deed of Easement/Wayleave Agreement 
which provides full right of access to retain, maintain, repair and inspect our asset 
 
 
Statutory electrical safety clearances must be maintained at all times. Any proposed 
buildings must not be closer than 5.3m to the lowest conductor. National Grid recommends

that no permanent structures are built directly beneath overhead lines. These distances are 
set out in EN 43 – 8 Technical Specification for “overhead line clearances Issue 3 (2004) 
available at: 
http://www.nationalgrid.com/uk/LandandDevelopment/DDC/devnearohl final/appendixIII/ap
pIII-part2 
 
 
If any changes in ground levels are proposed either beneath or in close proximity to our 
existing overhead lines then this would serve to reduce the safety clearances for such 
overhead lines. Safe clearances for existing overhead lines must be maintained in all 
circumstances. 
 
 
Further guidance on development near electricity transmission overhead lines is available 
here: http://www.nationalgrid.com/NR/rdonlyres/1E990EE5-D068-4DD6-8C9A-
4D0B06A1BA79/31436/Developmentnearoverheadlines1.pdf 
 
 
The relevant guidance in relation to working safely near to existing overhead lines is 
contained within the Health and Safety Executive’s (www.hse.gov.uk)  Guidance Note GS 
6 “Avoidance of Danger from Overhead Electric Lines”  and all relevant site staff should 
make sure that they are both aware of and understand this guidance. 
 
 
Plant, machinery, equipment, buildings or scaffolding should not encroach within 5.3 
metres of any of our high voltage conductors when those conductors are under their worse 
conditions of maximum “sag” and “swing” and overhead line profile (maximum “sag” and 
“swing”) drawings should be obtained using the contact details above. 
 
 
If a landscaping scheme is proposed as part of the proposal, we request that only slow and 
low growing species of trees and shrubs are planted beneath and adjacent to the existing 
overhead line to reduce the risk of growth to a height which compromises statutory safety 
clearances. 
 
 
Drilling or excavation works should not be undertaken if they have the potential to disturb 
or adversely affect the foundations or “pillars of support” of any existing tower.  These 
foundations always extend beyond the base area of the existing tower and foundation 
(“pillar of support”) drawings can be obtained using the contact details above 
 
 
Due to the scale, bulk and cost of the transmission equipment required to operate at 275kV 
or 400kV we only support proposals for the relocation of existing high voltage overhead 
lines where such proposals directly facilitate a major development or infrastructure project 
of national importance which has been identified as such by government.

National Grid Gas Transmission  
 
National Grid has three high pressure gas transmission pipelines located within or in close 
proximity to the proposed order limits. The high pressure gas pipeline located within this area is: 
 
 
FM09- Huntingdon- Steppingley 
 
FM26- Huntington- Steppingley 
 
FM07- Old Warden- Chalgrove 
 
 
 
Specific Comments – Gas Infrastructure 
 
The following points should be taken into consideration: 
 
 
National Grid has a Deed of Grant of Easement for each pipeline, which prevents the 
erection of permanent / temporary buildings, or structures, change to existing ground 
levels, storage of materials etc.  
 
Pipeline Crossings: 
 
 
Where existing roads cannot be used, construction traffic should ONLY cross the pipeline 
at previously agreed locations.  
 
 
The pipeline shall be protected, at the crossing points, by temporary rafts constructed at 
ground level. The third party shall review ground conditions, vehicle types and crossing 
frequencies to determine the type and construction of the raft required.  
 
 
The type of raft shall be agreed with National Grid prior to installation. 
 
 
No protective measures including the installation of concrete slab protection shall be 
installed over or near to the National Grid pipeline without the prior permission of National 
Grid.  
 
 
National Grid will need to agree the material, the dimensions and method of installation of 
the proposed protective measure.  
 
 
The method of installation shall be confirmed through the submission of a formal written 
method statement from the contractor to National Grid. 
 
 
Please be aware that written permission is required before any works commence within the 
National Grid easement strip. 
 
 
A National Grid representative shall monitor any works within close proximity to the 
pipeline to comply with National Grid specification T/SP/SSW22. 
 
A Deed of Consent is required for any crossing of the easement

Cables Crossing: 
 
 
Cables may cross the pipeline at perpendicular angle to the pipeline i.e. 90 degrees. 
 
 
A National Grid representative shall supervise any cable crossing of a pipeline. 
 
 
Clearance must be at least 600mm above or below the pipeline. 
 
 
Impact protection slab should be laid between the cable and pipeline if cable crossing is 
above the pipeline. 
 
 
A Deed of Consent is required for any cable crossing the easement. 
 
 
Where a new service is to cross over the pipeline a clearance distance of 0.6 metres 
between the crown of the pipeline and underside of the service should be maintained. If 
this cannot be achieved the service shall cross below the pipeline with a clearance 
distance of 0.6 metres. 
 
General Notes on Pipeline Safety: 
 
You should be aware of the Health and Safety Executives guidance document HS(G) 47 
"Avoiding Danger from Underground Services", and National Grid’s specification for Safe 
Working in the Vicinity of National Grid High Pressure gas pipelines and associated 
installations - requirements for third parties T/SP/SSW22.  
 
National Grid will also need to ensure that our pipelines access is maintained during and 
after construction.  
 
Our pipelines are normally buried to a depth cover of 1.1 metres however; actual depth and 
position must be confirmed on site by trial hole investigation under the supervision of a 
National Grid representative. Ground cover above our pipelines should not be reduced or 
increased. 
 
 
If any excavations are planned within 3 metres of National Grid High Pressure Pipeline or, 
within 10 metres of an AGI (Above Ground Installation), or if any embankment or dredging 
works are proposed then the actual position and depth of the pipeline must be established 
on site in the presence of a National Grid representative. A safe working method agreed 
prior to any work taking place in order to minimise the risk of damage and ensure the final 
depth of cover does not affect the integrity of the pipeline. 
 
 
Excavation works may take place unsupervised no closer than 3 metres from the pipeline 
once the actual depth and position has been has been confirmed on site under the 
supervision of a National Grid representative. Similarly, excavation with hand held power 
tools is not permitted within 1.5 metres from our apparatus and the work is undertaken with 
NG supervision and guidance.

Further Advice 
 
We would request that the potential impact of the proposed scheme on National Grid’s 
existing assets as set out above is considered in any subsequent reports, including in the 
Environmental Statement, and as part of any subsequent application.  
 
Where the promoter intends to acquire land, extinguish rights, or interfere with any of 
National Grid apparatus protective provisions will be required in a form acceptable to it to 
be included within the DCO.  
 
Where any diversion of apparatus may be required to facilitate a scheme, National Grid is 
unable to give any certainty with the regard to diversions until such time as adequate 
conceptual design studies have been undertaken by National Grid. Further information 
relating to this can be obtained by contacting the email address below.  
 
National Grid requests to be consulted at the earliest stages to ensure that the most 
appropriate protective provisions are included within the DCO application to safeguard the 
integrity of our apparatus and to remove the requirement for objection. All consultations 
should be sent to the following: DCOConsultations@nationalgrid.com as well as by post to 
the following address: 
 
The Company Secretary  
1-3 The Strand 
London 
WC2N 5EH 
 
In order to respond at the earliest opportunity National Grid will require the following: 
 
 Draft DCO including the Book of Reference and relevant Land Plans 
 Shape Files or CAD Files for the order limits 
 
I hope the above information is useful. If you require any further information please do not hesitate 
to contact me.  
 
The information in this letter is provided not withstanding any discussions taking place in relation to 
connections with electricity or gas customer services.

Dear Ms Jones 
 
Planning Act 2008 (as amended) and The Infrastructure Planning (Environmental 
Impact Assessment) Regulations 2009 (as amended) – Regulations 8 and 9 
 
Application by Millbrook Power Ltd for an Order Granting Development Consent for 
the Millbrook Power Project 
 
Thank you for your consultation letter of 20 June 2014 seeking the views of The Coal 
Authority on the EIA Scoping Opinion for the above proposal. 
 
The Coal Authority is a non-departmental public body sponsored by the Department of 
Energy and Climate Change.  As a statutory consultee, The Coal Authority has a duty to 
respond to planning applications and development plans in order to protect the public and 
the environment in mining areas. 
 
The Coal Authority Response: 
 
I have reviewed the proposals and confirm that the proposed EIA development is located 
outside of the defined coalfield.  Accordingly, The Coal Authority has no comments to 
make regarding the information to be contained in the Environmental Statement that will 
accompany this proposal. 
 
As this proposal lies outside of the defined coalfield, in accordance with Regulation 3 and 
Schedule 1 of the Infrastructure Planning (Applications: Prescribed Forms and Procedure) 
Regulations 2009 it will not be necessary for any further consultations to be undertaken 
with The Coal Authority on this Nationally Significant Infrastructure Project.  This letter can

APPENDIX 3 
PRESENTATION OF THE ENVIRONMENTAL STATEMENT 
The 
Infrastructure 
Planning 
(Applications: 
Prescribed 
Forms 
and 
Procedure) Regulations 2009 (SI 2264) (as amended) sets out the 
information which must be provided for an application for a development 
consent order (DCO) for nationally significant infrastructure under the 
Planning Act 2008. Where required, this includes an environmental 
statement. Applicants may also provide any other documents considered 
necessary 
to 
support 
the 
application. 
Information 
which 
is 
not 
environmental information need not be replicated or included in the ES.  
An environmental statement (ES) is described under the Infrastructure 
Planning (Environmental Impact Assessment) Regulations 2009 (SI 2263) 
(as amended) (the EIA Regulations) as a statement: 
a) 
‘that includes such of the information referred to in Part 1 of 
Schedule 4 as is reasonably required to assess the environmental 
effects of the development and of any associated development and 
which the applicant can, having regard in particular to current 
knowledge and methods of assessment, reasonably be required to 
compile; but 
b) 
that includes at least the information required in Part 2 of 
Schedule 4’. 
(EIA Regulations Regulation 2) 
The purpose of an ES is to ensure that the environmental effects of a 
project are fully considered, together with the economic or social benefits 
of the development, before the development consent application under 
the Planning Act 2008 is determined.  The ES should be an aid to decision 
making. 
The SoS advises that the ES should be laid out clearly with a minimum 
amount of technical terms and should provide a clear objective and 
realistic description of the likely significant impacts of the project. The 
information should be presented so as to be comprehensible to the 
specialist and non-specialist alike. The SoS recommends that the ES be 
concise with technical information placed in appendices. 
ES Indicative Contents 
The SoS emphasises that the ES should be a ‘stand-alone’ document in 
line with best practice and case law. The EIA Regulations Schedule 4, 
Parts 1 and 2, set out the information for inclusion in environmental 
statements.  
Schedule 4 Part 1 of the EIA Regulations states this information includes: 
‘17.  
Description of the development, including in particular— 
 
 
 
Appendix 3 
 
 
(a)  
a description of the physical characteristics of the 
whole development and the land-use requirements 
during the construction and operational phases; 
(b)  
a description of the main characteristics of the 
production processes, for instance, nature and quantity 
of the materials used; 
(c)  
an estimate, by type and quantity, of expected 
residues and emissions (water, air and soil pollution, 
noise, vibration, light, heat, radiation, etc) resulting 
from the operation of the proposed development. 
 
18.  
An outline of the main alternatives studied by the applicant 
and an indication of the main reasons for the applicant’s 
choice, taking into account the environmental effects. 
 
19.  
A description of the aspects of the environment likely to be 
significantly affected by the development, including, in 
particular, population, fauna, flora, soil, water, air, climatic 
factors, material assets, including the architectural and 
archaeological heritage, landscape and the interrelationship 
between the above factors. 
 
20.  
A description of the likely significant effects of the 
development on the environment, which should cover the 
direct effects and any indirect, secondary, cumulative, short, 
medium and long-term, permanent and temporary, positive 
and negative effects of the development, resulting from: 
(a)  
the existence of the development; 
(b) 
the use of natural resources; 
(c)  
the emission of pollutants, the creation of nuisances 
and the elimination of waste,  
and the description by the applicant of the forecasting 
methods used to assess the effects on the environment. 
 
21.  
A description of the measures envisaged to prevent, reduce 
and where possible offset any significant adverse effects on 
the environment. 
 
22.  
A non-technical summary of the information provided under 
paragraphs 1 to 5 of this Part. 
 
23.  
An indication of any difficulties (technical deficiencies or lack 
of know-how) encountered by the applicant in compiling the 
required information’. 
EIA Regulations Schedule 4 Part 1 
The content of the ES must include as a minimum those matters set out in 
Schedule 4 Part 2 of the EIA Regulations.  This includes the consideration 
of ‘the main alternatives studied by the applicant’ which the SoS 
recommends could be addressed as a separate chapter in the ES.  Part 2 
is included below for reference: 
 
 
 
Appendix 3 
 
 
Schedule 4 Part 2 
 
A description of the development comprising information on the 
site, design and size of the development 
 
A description of the measures envisaged in order to avoid, reduce 
and, if possible, remedy significant adverse  effects 
 
The data required to identify and assess the main effects which the 
development is likely to have on the environment 
 
An outline of the main alternatives studies by the applicant and an 
indication of the main reasons for the applicant’s choice, taking into 
account the environmental effects, and 
 
A non-technical summary of the information provided [under the 
four paragraphs above]. 
Traffic and transport is not specified as a topic for assessment under 
Schedule 4; although in line with good practice the SoS considers it is an 
important consideration per se, as well as being the source of further 
impacts in terms of air quality and noise and vibration. 
Balance 
The SoS recommends that the ES should be balanced, with matters which 
give rise to a greater number or more significant impacts being given 
greater prominence. Where few or no impacts are identified, the technical 
section may be much shorter, with greater use of information in 
appendices as appropriate. 
The SoS considers that the ES should not be a series of disparate reports 
and stresses the importance of considering inter-relationships between 
factors and cumulative impacts. 
Scheme Proposals  
The scheme parameters will need to be clearly defined in the draft DCO 
and therefore in the accompanying ES which should support the 
application as described. The SoS is not able to entertain material changes 
to a project once an application is submitted. The SoS draws the attention 
of the applicant to the DCLG and the Planning Inspectorate’s published 
advice on the preparation of a draft DCO and accompanying application 
documents. 
Flexibility  
The SoS acknowledges that the EIA process is iterative, and therefore the 
proposals may change and evolve. For example, there may be changes to 
the scheme design in response to consultation. Such changes should be 
addressed in the ES. However, at the time of the application for a DCO, 
any proposed scheme parameters should not be so wide ranging as to 
represent effectively different schemes. 
 
 
 
Appendix 3 
 
 
 
It is a matter for the applicant, in preparing an ES, to consider whether it 
is possible to assess robustly a range of impacts resulting from a large 
number of undecided parameters. The description of the project in the ES 
must not be so wide that it is insufficiently certain to comply with 
requirements of paragraph 17 of Schedule 4 Part 1 of the EIA Regulations. 
The Rochdale Envelope principle (see R v Rochdale MBC ex parte Tew 
(1999) and R v Rochdale MBC ex parte Milne (2000)) is an accepted way 
of dealing with uncertainty in preparing development applications. The 
applicant’s attention is drawn to the Planning Inspectorate’s Advice Note 9 
‘Rochdale Envelope’ which is available on the Advice Note’s page of the 
National Infrastructure Planning website.  
The applicant should make every attempt to narrow the range of options 
and explain clearly in the ES which elements of the scheme have yet to be 
finalised and provide the reasons. Where some flexibility is sought and the 
precise details are not known, the applicant should assess the maximum 
potential adverse impacts the project could have to ensure that the 
project as it may be constructed has been properly assessed.  
The ES should be able to confirm that any changes to the development 
within any proposed parameters would not result in significant impacts not 
previously identified and assessed. The maximum and other dimensions of 
the project should be clearly described in the ES, with appropriate 
justification. It will also be important to consider choice of materials, 
colour and the form of the structures and of any buildings. Lighting 
proposals should also be described. 
Scope 
The SoS recommends that the physical scope of the study areas should be 
identified under all the environmental topics and should be sufficiently 
robust in order to undertake the assessment. The extent of the study 
areas should be on the basis of recognised professional guidance, 
whenever such guidance is available. The study areas should also be 
agreed with the relevant consultees and local authorities and, where this 
is not possible, this should be stated clearly in the ES and a reasoned 
justification given. The scope should also cover the breadth of the topic 
area and the temporal scope, and these aspects should be described and 
justified. 
Physical Scope 
In general the SoS recommends that the physical scope for the EIA should 
be determined in the light of: 
 
the nature of the proposal being considered 
 
the relevance in terms of the specialist topic  
 
the breadth of the topic 
 
 
 
Appendix 3 
 
 
 
the physical extent of any surveys or the study area, and 
 
the potential significant impacts. 
The SoS recommends that the physical scope of the study areas should be 
identified for each of the environmental topics and should be sufficiently 
robust in order to undertake the assessment. This should include at least 
the whole of the application site, and include all offsite works. For certain 
topics, such as landscape and transport, the study area will need to be 
wider. The extent of the study areas should be on the basis of recognised 
professional guidance and best practice, whenever this is available, and 
determined by establishing the physical extent of the likely impacts. The 
study areas should also be agreed with the relevant consultees and, 
where this is not possible, this should be stated clearly in the ES and a 
reasoned justification given.  
Breadth of the Topic Area 
The ES should explain the range of matters to be considered under each 
topic and this may respond partly to the type of project being considered.  
If the range considered is drawn narrowly then a justification for the 
approach should be provided. 
Temporal Scope 
The assessment should consider: 
 
environmental impacts during construction works 
 
environmental impacts on completion/operation of the project 
 
where appropriate, environmental impacts a suitable number of 
years after completion of the project (for example, in order to allow 
for traffic growth or maturing of any landscape proposals), and 
 
environmental impacts during decommissioning. 
In terms of decommissioning, the SoS acknowledges that the further into 
the future any assessment is made, the less reliance may be placed on 
the outcome. However, the purpose of such a long term assessment, as 
well as to enable the decommissioning of the works to be taken into 
account, is to encourage early consideration as to how structures can be 
taken down. The purpose of this is to seek to minimise disruption, to re-
use materials and to restore the site or put it to a suitable new use. The 
SoS encourages consideration of such matters in the ES. 
The SoS recommends that these matters should be set out clearly in the 
ES and that the suitable time period for the assessment should be agreed 
with the relevant statutory consultees.  
The SoS recommends that throughout the ES a standard terminology for 
time periods should be defined, such that for example, ‘short term’ always 
refers to the same period of time.   
 
 
 
Appendix 3 
 
 
Baseline 
The SoS recommends that the baseline should describe the position from 
which the impacts of the project are measured. The baseline should be 
chosen carefully and, whenever possible, be consistent between topics. 
The identification of a single baseline is to be welcomed in terms of the 
approach to the assessment, although it is recognised that this may not 
always be possible. 
The SoS recommends that the baseline environment should be clearly 
explained in the ES, including any dates of surveys, and care should be 
taken to ensure that all the baseline data remains relevant and up to date.  
For each of the environmental topics, the data source(s) for the baseline 
should be set out together with any survey work undertaken with the 
dates.  The timing and scope of all surveys should be agreed with the 
relevant statutory bodies and appropriate consultees, wherever possible.   
The baseline situation and the project should be described within the 
context of the site and any other proposals in the vicinity. 
Identification of Impacts and Method Statement 
Legislation and Guidelines 
In terms of the EIA methodology, the SoS recommends that reference 
should be made to best practice and any standards, guidelines and 
legislation that have been used to inform the assessment. This should 
include guidelines prepared by relevant professional bodies. 
In terms of other regulatory regimes, the SoS recommends that relevant 
legislation and all permit and licences required should be listed in the ES 
where relevant to each topic. This information should also be submitted 
with the application in accordance with the APFP Regulations. 
In terms of assessing the impacts, the ES should approach all relevant 
planning and environmental policy – local, regional and national (and 
where appropriate international) – in a consistent manner. 
Assessment of Effects and Impact Significance 
The EIA Regulations require the identification of the ‘likely significant 
effects of the development on the environment’ (Schedule 4 Part 1 
paragraph 20). 
As a matter of principle, the SoS applies the precautionary approach to 
follow the Court’s4 reasoning in judging ‘significant effects’. In other words 
                                       
4 See Landelijke Vereniging tot Behoud van de Waddenzee and Nederlandse 
Vereniging tot Bescherming van  Vogels v Staatssecretris van Landbouw 
(Waddenzee Case No C 127/02/2004) 
 
 
 
Appendix 3 
 
 
‘likely to affect’ will be taken as meaning that there is a probability or risk 
that the project will have an effect, and not that a development will 
definitely have an effect. 
The SoS considers it is imperative for the ES to define the meaning of 
‘significant’ in the context of each of the specialist topics and for 
significant impacts to be clearly identified. The SoS recommends that the 
criteria should be set out fully and that the ES should set out clearly the 
interpretation of ‘significant’ in terms of each of the EIA topics. 
Quantitative criteria should be used where available. The SoS considers 
that this should also apply to the consideration of cumulative impacts and 
impact inter-relationships. 
The SoS recognises that the way in which each element of the 
environment may be affected by the project can be approached in a 
number of ways. However it considers that it would be helpful, in terms of 
ease of understanding and in terms of clarity of presentation, to consider 
the impact assessment in a similar manner for each of the specialist topic 
areas. The SoS recommends that a common format should be applied 
where possible.  
Inter-relationships between environmental factors 
The inter-relationship between aspects of the environments likely to be 
significantly affected is a requirement of the EIA Regulations (see 
Schedule 4 Part 1 of the EIA Regulations). These occur where a number of 
separate impacts, e.g. noise and air quality, affect a single receptor such 
as fauna. 
The SoS considers that the inter-relationships between factors must be 
assessed in order to address the environmental impacts of the proposal as 
a whole. This will help to ensure that the ES is not a series of separate 
reports collated into one document, but rather a comprehensive 
assessment drawing together the environmental impacts of the project. 
This is particularly important when considering impacts in terms of any 
permutations or parameters to the project. 
Cumulative Impacts  
The potential cumulative impacts with other major developments will need 
to be identified, as required by the Directive. The significance of such 
impacts should be shown to have been assessed against the baseline 
position (which would include built and operational development). In 
assessing cumulative impacts, other major development should be 
identified through consultation with the local planning authorities and 
other relevant authorities on the basis of those that are: 
 
projects that are under construction 
 
permitted application(s) not yet implemented 
 
submitted application(s) not yet determined  
 
all refusals subject to appeal procedures not yet determined  
                                                                                                              
 
 
 
 
Appendix 3 
 
 
 
projects on the National Infrastructure’s programme of projects, and 
 
projects identified in the relevant development plan (and emerging 
development plans - with appropriate weight being given as they 
move closer to adoption) recognising that much information on any 
relevant proposals will be limited. 
Details should be provided in the ES, including the types of development, 
location and key aspects that may affect the EIA and how these have been 
taken into account as part of the assessment.   
The SoS recommends that offshore wind farms should also take account 
of any offshore licensed and consented activities in the area, for the 
purposes of assessing cumulative effects, through consultation with the 
relevant licensing/consenting bodies. 
For the purposes of identifying any cumulative effects with other 
developments in the area, applicants should also consult consenting 
bodies in other EU states to assist in identifying those developments (see 
commentary on Transboundary Effects below). 
Related Development 
The ES should give equal prominence to any development which is related 
to the project to ensure that all the impacts of the proposal are assessed.   
The SoS recommends that the applicant should distinguish between the 
project for which development consent will be sought and any other 
development. This distinction should be clear in the ES.  
Alternatives 
The ES must set out an outline of the main alternatives studied by the 
applicant and provide an indication of the main reasons for the applicant’s 
choice, taking account of the environmental effect (Schedule 4 Part 1 
paragraph 18). 
Matters should be included, such as inter alia alternative design options 
and alternative mitigation measures. The justification for the final choice 
and evolution of the scheme development should be made clear.  Where 
other sites have been considered, the reasons for the final choice should 
be addressed.  
The SoS advises that the ES should give sufficient attention to the 
alternative forms and locations for the off-site proposals, where 
appropriate, and justify the needs and choices made in terms of the form 
of the development proposed and the sites chosen. 
 
 
 
Appendix 3 
 
 
Mitigation Measures  
Mitigation measures may fall into certain categories namely: avoid; 
reduce; compensate or enhance (see Schedule 4 Part 1 paragraph 21); 
and should be identified as such in the specialist topics. Mitigation 
measures should not be developed in isolation as they may relate to more 
than one topic area. For each topic, the ES should set out any mitigation 
measures required to prevent, reduce and where possible offset any 
significant adverse effects, and to identify any residual effects with 
mitigation in place. Any proposed mitigation should be discussed and 
agreed with the relevant consultees. 
The effectiveness of mitigation should be apparent. Only mitigation 
measures which are a firm commitment and can be shown to be 
deliverable should be taken into account as part of the assessment. 
It would be helpful if the mitigation measures proposed could be cross 
referred to specific provisions and/or requirements proposed within the 
draft development consent order. This could be achieved by means of 
describing the mitigation measures proposed either in each of the 
specialist reports or collating these within a summary section on 
mitigation. 
The SoS advises that it is considered best practice to outline in the ES, the 
structure of the environmental management and monitoring plan and 
safety procedures which will be adopted during construction and operation 
and may be adopted during decommissioning. 
Cross References and Interactions 
The SoS recommends that all the specialist topics in the ES should cross 
reference their text to other relevant disciplines. Interactions between the 
specialist topics is essential to the production of a robust assessment, as 
the ES should not be a collection of separate specialist topics, but a 
comprehensive assessment of the environmental impacts of the proposal 
and how these impacts can be mitigated. 
As set out in EIA Regulations Schedule 4 Part 1 paragraph 23, the ES 
should include an indication of any technical difficulties (technical 
deficiencies or lack of know-how) encountered by the applicant in 
compiling the required information. 
Consultation 
The SoS recommends that any changes to the scheme design in response 
to consultation should be addressed in the ES. 
It is recommended that the applicant provides preliminary environmental 
information (PEI) (this term is defined in the EIA Regulations under 
regulation 2 ‘Interpretation’) to the local authorities.  
Consultation with the local community should be carried out in accordance 
with the SoCC which will state how the applicant intends to consult on the 
 
 
 
Appendix 3 
 
 
preliminary environmental information (PEI). This PEI could include results 
of detailed surveys and recommended mitigation actions. Where effective 
consultation is carried out in accordance with Section 47 of the Planning 
Act, this could usefully assist the applicant in the EIA process – for 
example the local community may be able to identify possible mitigation 
measures to address the impacts identified in the PEI. Attention is drawn 
to the duty upon applicants under Section 50 of the Planning Act to have 
regard to the guidance on pre-application consultation. 
Transboundary Effects 
The SoS recommends that consideration should be given in the ES to any 
likely significant effects on the environment of another Member State of 
the European Economic Area. In particular, the SoS recommends 
consideration should be given to discharges to the air and water and to 
potential impacts on migratory species and to impacts on shipping and 
fishing areas.  
The Applicant’s attention is also drawn to the Planning Inspectorate’s 
Advice Note 12 ‘Development with significant transboundary impacts 
consultation’ which is available on the Advice Notes Page of the National 
Infrastructure Planning website 
Summary Tables 
The SoS recommends that in order to assist the decision making process, 
the applicant may wish to consider the use of tables: 
Table X 
to identify and collate the residual impacts after mitigation on 
the 
basis 
of 
specialist 
topics, 
inter-relationships 
and 
cumulative impacts. 
Table XX 
to demonstrate how the assessment has taken account of 
this Opinion and other responses to consultation.  
Table XXX to set out the mitigation measures proposed, as well as 
assisting the reader, the SoS considers that this would also 
enable the applicant to cross refer mitigation to specific 
provisions proposed to be 
included 
within 
the 
draft 
Development Consent Order. 
Table XXXX to cross reference where details in the HRA (where one is 
provided) such as descriptions of sites and their locations, 
together with any mitigation or compensation measures, are 
to be found in the ES. 
Terminology and Glossary of Technical Terms 
The SoS recommends that a common terminology should be adopted. This 
will help to ensure consistency and ease of understanding for the decision

terms of this definition so as to avoid confusion with, for example, the 
wider site area or the surrounding site.  
A glossary of technical terms should be included in the ES.  
Presentation 
The ES should have all of its paragraphs numbered, as this makes 
referencing easier as well as accurate.  
Appendices must be clearly referenced, again with all paragraphs 
numbered.  
All figures and drawings, photographs and photomontages should be 
clearly referenced.  Figures should clearly show the proposed site 
application boundary. 
Bibliography 
A bibliography should be included in the ES. The author, date and 
publication title should be included for all references.  All publications 
referred to within the technical reports should be included. 
Non Technical Summary 
The EIA Regulations require a Non Technical Summary (EIA Regulations 
Schedule 4 Part 1 paragraph 22). This should be a summary of the 
assessment in simple language. It should be supported by appropriate 
figures, photographs and photomontages.
