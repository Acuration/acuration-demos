Forward Looking Statements
This presentation may contain certain statements, expectations, statistics, projections and other information that are or may be forward-looking. The 
accuracy and completeness of all such statements, including, without limitation, statements regarding the future financial position, strategy, projected 
costs, plans, beliefs and objectives for the management of future operations of Drax Group plc (“Drax”) and its subsidiaries (the “Group”), are not 
warranted or guaranteed. By their nature, forward-looking statements involve risk and uncertainty because they relate to events and depend on 
circumstances that may occur in the future. Although Drax believes that the statements, expectations, statistics and projections and other information 
reflected in such statements are reasonable, they reflect Drax’s current view and no assurance can be given that they will prove to be correct. Such events 
and statements involve risks and uncertainties. Actual results and outcomes may differ materially from those expressed or implied by those forward-
looking statements. There are a number of factors, many of which are beyond the control of the Group, which could cause actual results and 
developments to differ materially from those expressed or implied by such forward-looking statements. These include, but are not limited to, factors such 
as: future revenues being lower than expected; increasing competitive pressures in the industry; uncertainty as to future investment and support achieved 
in enabling the realisation of strategic aims and objectives; and/or general economic conditions or conditions affecting the relevant industry, both 
domestically and internationally, being less favourable than expected including the impact of prevailing economic and political uncertainty, the impact of 
strikes, the impact of adverse weather conditions or events such as wildfires. We do not intend to publicly update or revise these projections or other 
forward-looking statements to reflect events or circumstances after the date hereof, and we do not assume any responsibility for doing so.

Financial Summary
Strong financial performance
1)
In December 2022, the UK Government confirmed the details of a windfall tax – the Electricity Generator Levy (EGL) – on renewable and low-carbon generators between 2023 and March 2028. The levy applies to the three 
biomass units operating under the Renewables Obligation (RO) scheme and our run-of-river hydro operations. It does not apply to the Contract for Difference (CfD) biomass or pumped storage hydro units. Following review, we 
have concluded that EGL will be accounted for as a levy within Gross Profit and therefore Adjusted EBITDA. For the remainder of 2023 we will present Adjusted EBITDA including and excluding EGL for ease of comparison.
2)
Cash and short-term investments of £125m less borrowings of £1,363m (less impact of hedging instruments within borrowings of £36m).
3)
Final dividend remains conditional on final Board determination and shareholder approval at the next AGM.

Contracted Generation Power Sales
Strong contracted power sales on ROC and Hydro 2023-2025
•
28.1TWh contracted at £150.0/MWh
1)
Includes structured power sales (forward gas sales as a proxy for forward power), transacted for the purpose of accessing additional liquidity for forward sales from ROC units and highly correlated to 
forward power prices. 2024: 0.4TWh, 2025: 1.5TWh, presented net of cost of closing out gas positions at maturity and replacing with forward power sales.
2)
2023 includes forward selling of pumped storage generation resulting in higher captured prices but lower system support availability.

Drax Role in UK System Support and Energy Security
UK’s largest source of renewable energy by output
•
4% of total annual power generation
•
9% of total annual renewable generation
•
Up to 52% of in-day peak renewable generation
A UK leader in dispatchable generation – 3.1GW of capacity
•
Growth in wind, solar and nuclear = intermittency, inflexibility and 
volatility
•
Greater role for dispatchable assets = opportunity for value
Security of supply – underpinned by integrated supply chain
Multiple earnings opportunities
•
Forward power sales up to two years in advance
•
Index-linked renewable incentive schemes
•
System support services via power markets, balancing mechanism and 
ancillary services
•

Electricity Generator Levy
A levy on renewable and low-carbon generators
•
Applies to the biomass units operating under the Renewable Obligation scheme and run of river hydro operations
•
Does not apply to CfD biomass and pumped storage hydro units
•
Structured as a levy on power sales above a benchmark of £75/MWh (indexed to CPI from April 2024)
•
Includes an allowable exceptional fuel cost element which increases the benchmark and is calculated retrospectively based on the actual cost 
above a baseline fuel cost of £65/MWh or historical levels, whichever is lower
•
Applies to revenues on electricity generated between January 2023 and March 2028
•
EGL is a levy but is administered as a tax and subject to agreement with HMRC
