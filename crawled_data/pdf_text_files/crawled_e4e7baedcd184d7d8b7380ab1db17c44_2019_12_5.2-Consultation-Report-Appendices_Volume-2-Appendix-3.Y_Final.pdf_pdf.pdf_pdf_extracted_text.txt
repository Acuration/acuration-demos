Proposal for a gas-ﬁred generation plant
at Rookery South Pit
www.millbrookpower.co.uk
DCO Regime Planning & Public Consultation 
The project is classified as a Nationally Significant Infrastructure Project, which means that a 
Development Consent Order (DCO) is required to build, operate and maintain it. 
The DCO application will be processed and examined by the Planning Inspectorate and the final decision 
on the application will be made by the Secretary of State for Energy and Climate Change.
The electrical and gas connections are integral to the project and will be considered together with the 
power generation plant under the DCO application.
Consultation with CBC, Bedford Borough Council (BBC), local people, businesses, and Parish Councils in 
the area is an essential part of the DCO process and will help to influence the final designs of the Project. 
MPL is also liaising closely with organisations such as the Environment Agency, Natural England and 
English Heritage to ensure that the plant will be designed, built, operated and maintained to the highest 
relevant and current safety and environmental standards.
Why Rookery South Pit?
It has three advantages:
 
1.  Proximity to the national gas and electricity transmission networks
 
2.  National Grid encourages new power generation development in the region 
 
3. Rookery South Pit is classified as brownfield land and is allocated by Central Bedfordshire   
 
 
Council (CBC) for development.
Development of the Project 
As a result of consultation, feedback, and technical and environmental studies, several significant changes 
have occurred since the previous consultation events:
 
●  a reduction in the maximum height of the stacks from 60m to 40m;
 
●  a narrowing of the gas connection opportunity area into two route corridors with a preferred  
  
connection route; 
 
●  refinement of the electrical connection opportunity area;
 
●  generating equipment has been arranged to reduce the impact of noise for near-by homes. 
Preliminary Environmental Assessment
Steps to mitigate the impact of the Project on the local environment during its construction, operation, 
maintenance and decommissioning are a major part of the consultation and planning process. Due to 
the nature and size of the Project, MPL is undertaking an Environmental Impact Assessment (EIA). The 
EIA considers the potential positive and negative impacts of the Project and MPL has published its 
interim findings in the PEIR. The PEIR, along with a non-technical summary, is available for inspection 
today, at the main office of Central Bedfordshire Council, Bedford Borough Hall, Marston Vale Forest 
Centre, as well as at Bedford, Ampthill and Wootton Libraries. It can also be viewed at 
www.millbrookpower.co.uk.
Community Benefits 
This £200m Project would be a substantial investment in the area and would deliver significant 
economic benefits for a period of at least 25 years 
 
●  creation of around 150 jobs during a 2 year construction period;
 
●  creation of up to 15 permanent skilled jobs for on-going operation and maintenance of the   
  
facility; 
 
●  potential business opportunities for local suppliers. 
MPL will consult CBC and BBC on ways to bring wider social and environmental benefits to the 
surrounding area.
Comment and Feedback 
Your feedback is important to the consultation process. We would like your views on:
 
●  the layout of the Power Generation Plant within the Project Site;
 
●  route option(s) for accessing the gas and electricity connections infrastructure during construction  
  
and maintenance;
 
●  the preferred route option for the gas connection;
 
●  the proposed electrical connection;
 
●  the findings of the preliminary assessment on the likely significant environmental effects of the  
  
Project during construction and operation, as set out in the PEIR.
This consultation phase will end on Sunday, 16th November 2014, and we would welcome your views 
on or before this date.

Who is Millbrook Power?
Millbrook Power Limited is an energy development company established for the Rookery South Pit 
project by Watt Power Limited of Edinburgh. Watt Power wishes to develop a gas-fired power plant at 
Rookery South Pit and elsewhere in the UK to support the UK Government’s drive to a low-carbon 
economy. 
The Project Key Details  
 
●  the construction, operation and maintenance of a Simple Cycle Gas Turbine power generation  
 
  
plant with a rated electrical output of up to 299 MW of electricity; 
 
●  the power generation plant will produce electricity from natural gas;
 
●  it is designed to provide flexible back-up generation capacity which can respond quickly and
  
efficiently to both short-term variation in customer demand, and intermittent output from renewable   
  
power generation;  
 
●  it is anticipated that it will operate for no more than 1500 hours per year;
 
●  the power generation plant will have up to five stacks, each up to 40 m in height;
 
●  the site for the generating equipment and substation covers an area of approximately 8 ha and is  
 
  
located within Rookery South Pit itself;
 
●  the proposed Project includes the construction, operation and maintenance of a new  electrical  
 
  
connection together with a new substation to connect the power generation plant to the existing  
 
  
overhead power line nearby;
 
●  the layout of the electrical connection is yet to be finalised but an area within which the connection   
  
will be sited has been identified;
 
●  a realistic worst case scenario of up to two overhead line double circuits [of 400 kV] (including
  
up to seven new towers one of which will replace an existing tower leading to six net additional  
 
  
towers) has been assumed (and is being environmentally assessed), however MPL will continue to   
  
work with National Grid on the indicative design of the connection over the coming months;
 
●  the proposed Project also includes the construction of a new underground pipeline to bring natural   
  
gas to the power generating plant from the National Gas Transmission System located nearby;
 
●  at this stage two gas connection route corridors have been identified with a preferred connection  
 
  
route within one of them;
 
●  the plant could enter commercial operation in 2019/20, subject to public consultation, planning and   
  
financing.
Continued consultation and environmental assessment on the connection route options and possible 
electrical connection is required before each can be confirmed.  
In addition, although a preliminary preferred layout of the power generation plant has been identified, the 
final location and layout are yet to be determined.

Millbrook Power Limited proposes to develop a 
gas-fired power plant with a rated electrical 
output of up to 299 MW at Rookery South Pit. 
Using modern and efficient electricity power 
generation technology, the plant will support the 
country’s move to a low-carbon economy. 
The construction, operation and decommissioning of the Project all have the potential to affect air quality, both through the 
generation of dust during the construction and decommissioning phases, as well as the generation of stack emissions during 
operation.
Preliminary Assessment & Results 
A desk based assessment and air dispersion modelling have been carried out to assess any potential air quality effects resulting from 
the Project on identified residential and ecological receptors. 
Construction & Decommissioning 
Dust may result from works during construction, such as earth moving operations for new foundations and for the Gas Connection.
Generating Equipment Operational Impact   
The Power Generation Plant has the potential to affect air quality through the emission of flue gases resulting from the combustion 
of natural gas. This includes the release of Nitrous Oxides (NOx). Modern gas fired power plants are, however, inherently clean and 
produce far fewer emissions than other fossil fuel power plants when compared on an energy output basis.
Proposed Mitigation Measures
Mitigation against the unwanted spread of dust would be addressed by the Construction Environmental Management Plan (CEMP) 
through appropriate dust mitigation measures such as covering stockpiles or dowsing them with water during dry, windy conditions. 
The CEMP will be presented in the Environmental Statement.
Mitigation against negative effects resulting from flue gas emissions during operation is to be achieved through appropriate plant 
design – most notably through correct stack heights.
In order to determine stack heights, air quality impact assessments have been undertaken using air dispersion modelling techniques. 
The results of these assessments indicate that the appropriate stack height for the proposed Power Generation Plant, which will 
achieve adequate dispersion of emission gases, is between 30 m and 40 m. Given this stack height and based on the Preliminary 
Environmental Assessments, there are not anticipated to be any significant effects on air quality as a result of the Project during 
construction, operation or decommissioning.
Cumulative effects
The only development in the vicinity of the Project which has the potential to cumulatively interact in terms of air quality is the 
Covanta RRF. However, initial modelling has been undertaken which has shown that given the proposed differences in stack heights 
between the Project and the Covanta RRF, no cumulative effects in terms of air quality are anticipated.
Conclusions & Next Steps 
Based on the preliminary assessment, no likely significant effects are anticipated on air quality as a result of the construction, 
operation or decommissioning of the Project. Further work will include a more detailed assessment of cumulative effects with other 
projects, as well as the production of figures accurately showing the distribution of stack emissions.
AIR QUALITY 
www.millbrookpower.co.uk
The construction, operation and decommissioning of the Project all have the potential to affect both above-ground and buried 
archaeological assets, as well as the setting and appreciation of assets of importance to cultural heritage, including surrounding Listed 
Buildings, Scheduled Monuments and Conservation Areas.
Preliminary Assessment & Results 
An archaeological desk based assessment and a site visit were carried out as part of the overall archaeological assessment. This 
identified cultural heritage assets in the vicinity of the Project Site including buried archaeological remains and findspots, Listed 
Buildings, Scheduled Monuments and Registered Parks and Gardens.
Results of this assessment show that there are no designated heritage assets within the Project Site. However, within 5km of the 
Project Site there are 14 Scheduled Monuments, 13 Listed Buildings (Grade I & II), 5 Conservation Areas and 1 Registered Park.
Construction & Decommissioning 
There will be no direct physical impacts on any designated heritage assets during the construction and decommissioning phases. 
Furthermore, the majority of the construction works will not be visible outside of Rookery South Pit and therefore will have no 
significant visual effects on the setting of any nearby heritage sites. 
Given that Rookery South Pit was formerly used for clay extraction, there are not anticipated to be any effects on buried archaeology 
from any of the elements of the Project within Rookery South Pit. 
The Gas and Electrical Connections are in previously undeveloped agricultural land, and therefore there remains the potential for as 
yet undiscovered buried archaeology to be adversly effected. Previous archaeological investigations in the areas where the Gas and 
Electrical Connections are proposed did not reveal any significant archaeology. Further assessment of this area will however be 
undertaken as part of ongoing works and will be presented in the final Environmental Statement.
Power Generation Plant Operational Impact 
During operation, the introduction of the stack(s) of the Generating Equipment, as well as the towers to support an overhead electrical 
line, have the potential to have minor adverse effects on surrounding cultural heritage assets such as Listed Buildings. However none 
of these effects are considered to be significant.  
Cumulative Effects  
Given that the Project will not give rise to any effects on archaeology and cultural heritage on its own, no cumulative effects are 
predicted with other developments.
Conclusions & Next Steps   
No significant effects are anticipated on archaeology and cultural heritage as a result of the Project during construction, operation or 
decommissioning. Further work will be undertaken to confirm the potential effects of the Gas Connection on buried archaeology, and 
the operation of the Generating Equipment and Electrical Connection to affect cultural heritage assets such as Listed Buildings and 
Scheduled Monuments.  
 
ARCHAEOLOGY & CULTURAL HERITAGE
www.millbrookpower.co.uk
ECOLOGY
The construction, operation and decommissioning phases of the Project have the potential to adversely affect sensitive ecological 
receptors. The Project also has the potential to provide ecological value, for example, by reinforcing existing habitats or through the 
introduction of screen planting, which could provide additional habitat for some species. 
Preliminary Assessment & Results
In order to assess the potential for the Project to affect sensitive ecological receptors, desk studies and site walkover studies known 
as a “Phase 1 habitat survey” were undertaken. Based on the results of the Phase 1 Habitat Survey, Phase 2 Protected Species 
Surveys were commissioned and the table below summarises their findings to date.
Summary of preliminary Phase 2 Surveys 
* These species will not therefore be considered any further in the assessment process.
Badger
Species
Power Generation Plant Site 
Electrical and Gas Connection Area 
Results obtained to date
Although signs of badger activity were recorded in the vicinity, no setts were 
revealed during the surveys.* 
A single badger sett was recorded within a wooded copse.
Bats 
A diverse bat assemblage was recorded during the activity and automated 
static bat detector surveys undertaken in May and July 2014. 9 species 
recorded in total. 
Surveys undertaken in May and July 2014 recorded 4 species in total. 
Emergence/ return roost surveys at Pillinge Farm confirmed the 
continued presence of bat roosts. 
Breeding Birds
A relatively diverse assemblage of 65 species of breeding birds (either 
confirmed or potentially breeding) was recorded during the surveys.  Of 
these, 31 are species of importance to Nature Conservation. 
The majority of species recorded are common species, breeding within 
hedgerows, scrub, and small wooded copses. Skylark were recorded 
breeding in open fields. A single barn owl was recorded incidentally 
foraging during the bat activity surveys.  
Great Crested Newts
As part of the ongoing Low Level Restoration Scheme, trapping and 
translocation of great crested newts (and reptiles) has taken place and 
therefore it is assumed that they will not be present in Rookery South Pit by 
the completion of the Low Level Restoration Scheme.
Surveys of 13 ponds within 250m of the Project were undertaken to 
confirm presence/absence. Presence was confirmed in 8 of the 
ponds. 8 ponds were also found to support common toad, a species 
of principle importance. 
Invertebrates
As a result of the ground works and vegetation clearance associated with the 
Low Level Restoration Scheme in Rookery South Pit, no invertebrates are 
assumed to be presen by its completion. 
Limited presence of species due to intensively managed arable land. 
155 species recorded, all of which are common and widespread across 
England. 
Otters and Water Voles
There are no features suitable for use by water voles or otters within the 
Power Generation Plant Site.* 
No signs of water voles or otters were recorded during the surveys. 
Reptiles 
Only small to medium populations confirmed to date. 
Ongoing surveys have confirmed the presence of small populations 
of common lizard and grass snake.

Proposed Mitigation Measures    
Although a number of sensitive species have been identified within the Project Site, at this stage it is not expected that any of them 
will be significantly adversely affected by the Project. Measures incorporated into the design of the Project to minimise effects on 
protected species include avoiding specific habitats where the species are known to be present such as ponds or woods. Thus far, 
no other specific mitigation measures have been deemed necessary. 
Conclusions & Next Steps   
Following the completion of all of the Phase 2 species surveys, a full assessment of the potential effects of the proposed Project on 
ecology will be undertaken.
The construction, operation and decommissioning of the proposed Project has the potential to affect ground conditions by, for example, 
the removal of good quality agricultural land. The proposed Project also has the potential to affect human health and other sensitive 
ecological receptors from contamination, whether existing or created. 
Preliminary Assessment and Results 
A preliminary desk based assessment has been carried out to assess the baseline geology and ground conditions underlying the Project 
Site. The assessment studied information regarding previous land uses of the Project Site and the surrounding area, the soils and geology 
present, any potential contamination issues resulting from former site uses and any potential ground stability hazards.
Geology and Ground Conditions  
The main potential impacts would arise during construction and decommissioning from the disturbance of any existing contamination, 
and the creation of pollution incidents, for example spillages. 
Given the previous extraction undertaken in the Power Generation Plant Site there is no important underlying geology, soil or existing 
hazardous contamination. 
Given that land underlying the Gas and Electrical Connection has not previously been subject to industrial development, the potential for 
encountering contaminated materials is considered to be low.
Agriculture 
Construction of the Gas and Electrical Connection will result in the temporary sterilisation of agricultural land. However, this will only be 
in a narrow corridor area (maximum 30 m working width) and any effects would be temporary. There would be a permanent easement 
around the pipeline of the Gas Connection and cables of the Electrical Connection, however these would not affect the current 
agricultural use of the land, thus no significant effects are anticipated. 
Proposed Mitigation Measures 
All construction work will be conducted within best practice guidelines, and a detailed Construction Environmental Management Plan 
(CEMP) will be employed to prevent any contamination or pollution incidents impacting on ground conditions. In respect of geology, 
ground conditions and agriculture, some mitigation could include;
 
● minimizing land take where possible;
 
● avoiding the need for piled foundations where possible;
 
● dust suppression measures;
 
● following best practice guidance to minimise risk of spillages.
These mitigation measures would be detailed within the CEMP.
Conclusions & Next Steps
No significant effects are anticipated on geology and ground conditions as a result of the Project during construction, operation or 
decommissioning. Ground water monitoring will be carried out at the Generating Equipment Site to confirm the results.
GEOLOGY, GROUND CONDITIONS & AGRICULTURE
www.millbrookpower.co.uk
The proposed Project has the potential to affect the landscape and visual receptors during construction, operation and 
decommissioning. 
Preliminary Assessment and Results 
To date, a desk based assessment and site visit have been undertaken to determine the baseline landscape character and the sensitive 
receptors which may be affected by the visual appearance of the Project. Photographs were also taken from key viewpoints and, of 
these, a handful were chosen as points from which photographic models (photomontages) were created to illustrate how the Project 
would look in the landscape.  These key viewpoints were agreed with consultees and include residential areas, public rights of way 
and historic monuments. The resultant photomontages can be viewed here today. The Preliminary Assessment has taken account of 
cumulative effects between the Project, the Covanta RRF and other developments in the area.
Construction and Decommissioning  
There would inevitably be some temporary adverse effects on the landscape and visual receptors during construction and 
decommissioning. These effects would arise from activities such as earthworks, site clearance works, the removal of vegetation (in the 
case of the Gas Connection), construction traffic and construction site lighting. However, given the limited construction period (22 
months) and the relatively modest construction operations, these effects are not considered to be significant.
Power Generation Plant and Electrical Connection
During operation, adverse effects on landscape and visual amenity will result from the introduction of permanent structures, 
particularly the stacks of the Generating Equipment and towers required for the Electrical Connection, which will be the tallest 
structures on the Project Site. These features will be clearly visible from some locations to the south and south east, particularly along 
the Greensands Ridge. However, a large proportion of the Project is situated within the Rookery South Pit and will therefore be largely 
screened from view. The predicted moderate adverse effects may also become insignificant following mitigation measures in the form 
of landscaping and planting of vegetation. A recent site visit found that existing vegetation will effectively screen the Project Site from 
view for most nearby settlements and outlying properties.  
Gas Connection
No significant effects are anticipated from the operation of the Gas Connection.
Proposed mitigation Measures  
Local reinforcement of hedgerows or plantations could be undertaken to ensure effects on visual amenity remain minimal.
Conclusions & Next Steps  
There is the possibility of moderately significant effects from certain view points, primarily from the south and east of the Project Site. 
Further work will be undertaken to produce photomontages in the winter to ensure that a worst case scenario is being assessed when 
screening effects of vegetation are at their minimum. Further work will also focus on designing appropriate mitigation such as screen 
planting in order to limit effects from views to the south and east of the Project Site. The results of the further work will be included 
in the Environmental Statement.
LANDSCAPE & VISUAL IMPACTS 
www.millbrookpower.co.uk
The information below illustrates the national need for new gas-fired electricity generation: 
 
●  Early next decade a large amount of the UK’s coal-fired power stations and some older gas-fired plants will close due to  
 
 
 the EU Industrial Emissions Directive; 
 
●  similarly, a large number of the UK’s nuclear power stations will close having already been given large extensions to their  
 
 
 predicted lifespan;
 
● renewable energy technologies are fundamental to the UK’s decarbonisation strategy, however they cannot 
 
 
provide the security of supply that is currently provided by ageing coal-fired, gas-fired and nuclear plants;
 
●  the UK Government’s Department for Energy and Climate Change (DECC) currently forecast a need for ~ 45 GW of new  
 
 
 Gas, Nuclear and Carbon Capture and Storage (CCS) capacity between 2012 and 2030;
 
●  no new nuclear plants are expected to be operational until late next decade and CCS remains an unproven technology   
 
 
 with no plants expected to be available in the foreseeable future;
 
●  new gas-fired generation required post 2020 needs to be more flexible to support intermittent forms of renewable energy,  
 
 
 in particular wind.
Government Policy
The overarching National Policy Statement (NPS) for Energy is NPS EN-1, which sets out national policy and explains the need for 
energy infrastructure.
NPS EN-1 re-affirms the transitional role of new gas-fired generation. It confirms that a diverse energy mix is required and that there 
is a significant need for new energy generation infrastructure to replace capacity that will be lost through the closure of large existing 
plants. Such government policies therefore highlight the general need for new gas-fired generation and Projects like our own. 
To ensure that there is reliability of supply, it is Government policy that the electricity generation mix needs to incorporate a balance 
of technologies that can continuously and reliably produce stable and controllable power, and that within this scenario, gas-fired 
electricity generating technologies will play a significant role. Thus in the second Annual Energy Statement (November, 2011) (“the 
Strategy”), DECC directed the need to build new power generation infrastructure. In line with this requirement, DECC also 
acknowledged the need for gas to continue to feature strongly in the energy mix. 
Gas Generation Strategy 
Released by DECC in December 2012, the Strategy sets out the important role that gas-fired generation—as a reliable and flexible source 
of electricity—will play in any future generation mix, supporting a secure, low-carbon and affordable electricity system. It states that; 
 
”Gas currently forms an integral part of the UK’s generation mix and is a reliable and 
 
 flexible source of electricity. Using gas as a fuel in our power stations currently 
 
 provides a significant proportion of our electricity generation (around 40% in 2011)”.
Moreover, the Strategy suggests that there could be as much as 26 GW of new gas-fired generation infrastructure required if the 
decarbonisation target is set at 200 g/CO2/kWh. This is also acknowledged in DECC's Gas Generation Strategy which indicates that 
in 2030 we could need more overall gas capacity than we have today, although operating for a smaller percentage of the time. 
NEED FOR GAS GENERATION 
www.millbrookpower.co.uk
The construction, operation and decommissioning of the Project all have the potential to affect local noise levels and generate 
vibration, which may affect sensitive receptors.
Preliminary Assessment and Results 
In order to predict and assess operational noise levels, background noise measurements taken at South Pillinge Farm were modelled 
alongside noise levels predicted for typical Generating Equipment similar to that expected to be utilised in the Project. The survey 
methodology was agreed in consultation with Central Bedfordshire Council. The preliminary assessment has also taken into account 
the cumulative effects of the Project and the Covanta RRF. However, initial modelling has shown that given the noise limits which the 
Covanta RRF must adhere to, no cumulative effects are anticipated. 
Construction and Decommissioning 
Noise disturbance as a result of construction and decommissioning could arise from activities such as excavation for foundations, 
delivery of the plant, and excavation of the Gas Connection. This will however be a temporary source of noise. 
Based on a conservative, worst case assessment, where numerous large plant items are operating simultaneously, the significance of 
the overall effect of construction and decommissioning noise is predicted to be neutral at all receptor locations. 
Generating Equipment Operational Impact  
Noise disturbance could potentially occur from the rotating components of the plant (e.g. the gas turbine generator units). However 
the preliminary assessment has shown that there are not predicted to be any significant noise effects at South Pillinge Farm. As this is 
the closest property to the Generating Equipment Site, it therefore follows that, by proxy, no significant effects from noise are predicted 
at any other properties in close proximity to the Site. 
No significant effects are predicted from operational vibration impacts. 
Gas Connection  
During the operation of the Gas Connection, noise effects at sensitive receptors cannot be ruled out. However the noise is rarely 
perceptible and given the lack of residential properties in close proximity to the proposed location for the Above Ground Installation, 
the initial assessment concludes that operational noise from the Gas Connection will be negligible. 
Electrical Connection  
Given the distance between the connection and residential properties, and the typically low levels of noise generated by such 
equipment, no effects are anticipated from the operation of the Electrical Connection. 
Proposed Mitigation Measures  
During construction a Construction Environmental Management Plan (CEMP) would be adhered to and an appropriately placed 
acoustic screen would be used. 
Embedded mitigation in the form of high performance silencers, the acoustic cladding of all gas turbine generators, and the use of 
inherently quiet plant items will minimise any potential effects of noise during operation. 
Conclusions and Next Steps
No significant effects are anticipated from noise as a result of the project during construction, operation or decommissioning. These 
studies will be further refined and a more detailed assessment undertaken and presented in the final Environmental Statement.
Further work will be undertaken to carry out background monitoring at other potential sensitive receptors, as well as better defining 
any potential effects from operation of the Electrical Connection, and quantifying cumulative effects with the Covanta RRF. 
NOISE AND VIBRATION
www.millbrookpower.co.uk
The construction, operation and decommissioning phases of the proposed Project have the potential to affect the local area’s labour 
market, community facilities and tourism sector.
Preliminary Assessment and Results 
A desk based assessment has been undertaken which has assessed the socio-economic makeup of the local and wider areas 
surrounding the Project through a review of statistics. Three main study areas have been used in this assessment: socio-economic, 
tourism and community infrastructure.
Socio-economic Study Area
Preliminary socio-economic assessments demonstrate that the Local Area surrounding the proposed Project is characterised by:
 
● a high and growing retirement age population; 
 
● lower levels of unemployment and a higher level of self-employment than the UK average;
 
● a projected population increase of c.7% between 2013 and 2021, (higher than UK average);
 
● a high proportion of people achieving the highest qualifications compared to the UK average;
 
● economic activity higher than the UK average; 
 
● a high proportion of people working in the retail industry; 
 
● a comparable proportion of people working in the manufacturing and construction sector; 
 
● a high proportion of people in highly skilled jobs.
The socio-economic profile outlined by the preliminary assessment reveals that the overall sensitivity of the labour market is assessed 
as low.
Tourism Study Area 
The tourism profile outlined by the preliminary assessment indicates that visitor numbers, spending, and trips to Bedfordshire’s key 
attractions are increasing. The overall sensitivity of the tourism economy is therefore assessed as low. 
The Marston Vale Millennium Country Park and Woburn Abbey are the most significant attractions located within 5 km of the proposed 
site. They will both be assessed individually and included in the tourism business survey to assess any perceived effect on visitor activity. 
Community Infrastructure Study Area 
Within 5 km of the proposed Project Site there are a range of community infrastructures such as schools, GP surgeries, pharmacies, a 
hospital and a library. The community infrastructure audit has shown that all receptors serve local catchments and are therefore of low 
sensitivity. 
Proposed Mitigation Measures 
No significant adverse effects on socio-economics, tourism and community infrastructure as a result of the proposed 
Project have been identified, therefore no mitigation measures have been identified.
Conclusions & Next Steps 
No significant effects on socio-economics are anticipated as a result of the Project during construction, operation or 
decommissioning. However, there are likely to be minor positive effects from investment at all stages of the Project. 
Further work will be undertaken to produce and circulate a questionnaire in the area to ascertain peoples’ opinions of the 
Project, particularly focusing on local businesses. 
SOCIO-ECONOMICS
www.millbrookpower.co.uk
The construction, operation and decommissioning of the Project have the potential to affect the local transport network, through the 
generation of additional traffic movements in the area.
Preliminary Assessment and Results 
An initial desk based assessment has been carried out which has identified and assessed the following:
 
● Pedestrian, equestrian and cycle facilities; 
 
● public transport services including bus and rail services;
 
● private transport services including parking provision;
 
● highways networks and junctions;
 
● road safety and collision statistics; and 
 
● effects from increased traffic movements as a result of construction, operation and decommissioning of the Project.
Power Generation Plant 
Access to the Power Generation Plant Site is proposed from the north near Stewartby via Green Lane. Green Lane links to Bedford 
Road and the A421 to the west, and Stewartby Way and the B530 to the east. A new purpose built Access Road would be constructed 
within the Power Generation Plant Site from Green Lane to the Generating Equipment Site. The route of the Access Road from Green 
Lane would follow the existing track which borders the lake within Rookery North Pit. 
Construction of the Power Generation Plant will require the delivery of large plant items such as the Gas Turbine Generators and 
stacks. Therefore potential traffic impacts in the form of temporary road closures and the requirement of escort vehicles are possible. 
However, given the temporary nature of the construction phase, the effects on traffic and transport are predicted to be minor.
Operation of the Project is not anticipated to have any negative effects on the local road network.
Proposed Mitigation Measures  
During normal operation, up to five members of staff would be working at the Power Generation Plant Site at any one time. Shift 
changes would be timed to avoid network peak hour, minimising affects on the local transport network. 
Gas Connection & Electrical Connection  
Neither the Gas, nor Electrical Connection will be manned. They will have very infrequent service and maintenance visits thus traffic 
impacts will be negligible. 
Cumulative Effects  
Given that the Project will not give rise to any traffic and transport effects on its own, no cumulative effects are predicted with other 
developments. However, it is recognised that there is the potential for the Project to be operational at the same time as the Covanta 
RRF, which will produce a large volume of additional traffic movements during operation. Despite this, the very limited number of 
vehicles accessing the Project Site during operation (5 workers on site at any one time) will not dramatically change the assumptions 
made by Covanta RRF in the mitigation required to alleviate the impacts from their scheme. Therefore these mitigation measures will 
still be suitable for use with the Covanta RRF and the Project.
Conclusions & Next Steps   
No significant effects are anticipated from traffic and transport as a result of the Project during construction, operation or 
decommissioning. Further work will be undertaken to carry out additional traffic counts on the local road network.

WATER RESOURCES
www.millbrookpower.co.uk
The main potential effects on local water resources that could result from construction and decommissioning of the Project are 
contaminated material entering a surface water body, or during operation for the Generating Equipment Site to become inundated 
with flood water. 
Preliminary Assessment & Results
A desk based assessment has been carried out that has identified surface water resources within the vicinity of the Project Site, as 
well as previous pollution incidents which may have impacted upon water bodies. The potential for the Project to be impacted by 
flooding, or to increase the likelihood of flooding elsewhere, has also been assessed. 
There are not anticipated to be any effects on the water bodies identified in the area as the majority are a significant distance from 
the Project Site.
Generating Equipment Operational Impact
Due to the very limited amount of water utilised in the Generating Equipment (only required for fire water, maintenance operations, 
and personnel welfare), all water would be transported to the Generating Equipment Site and stored in tanks. Thus no surface or 
groundwater would be required. As no water will be abstracted for the Project, water resources will not be depleted. There will be 
no pollution of watercourses given embedded mitigation measures.  
Electrical Connection and Gas Connection
Neither the Gas or Electrical Connection will require water during operation, nor will they have any impact on flooding or runoff 
rates. The Gas Connection will probably cross one minor watercourse (a drainage ditch) but no significant effects are anticipated as 
a result.
Proposed Mitigation Measures
In order to protect the water environment during construction, best practice would be employed in accordance with the Environment 
Agency and Internal Drainage Board guidelines. It is predicted that following the implementation of best practice construction 
methods, any effects on water quality and resources will be negligible.
During operation, the Power Generation Plant Site would be equipped with a surface water drainage system and a sewerage system. 
The surface water drainage system would remove any potentially polluted runoff, prior to reaching the main sewerage network.
Conclusions & Next Steps
No significant effects are anticipated on water quality and resources as a result of the Project during construction, operation or 
decommissioning. Further work will be undertaken to produce a detailed flood risk assessment which will be submitted as a 
supporting document to the final Environmental Statement.

Development Parameters Plan
**Note : A layout of the gas processing plant has been modelled using several coloured ‘development envelopes’ related to the height, width and depth of each part of the plant ( shown in 
the plan above ).  The envelopes are modelled at the maximum height of the structures or buildings within each area and therefore represent a worse case scenario, showing the area in 
which development of the gas processing structures will be built.  Indicative wireline models of the proposed transmission towers are shown and a 3D model of the Covanta RRF consented 
scheme is included in the photomontages.  Areas with taller stacks have been modelled with cylinders rising out of the development blocks in order to illustrate the proposed position of the 
turbine generator stacks. These envelopes have been used as the basis for visual modelling in the photomontages and the assessment of impacts.  Colours are used to illustrate the different 
development envelopes and are not indicative of the colour of the plant.  The actual colours of gas processing plant and buildings will be agreed with the Local Planning Authority to help 
minimise the visual impact of the development.  Photomontages do not illustrate any planting which may be incorporated to further reduce the visibility of the Project..

Millbrook Power Limited (MPL) proposes to develop a gas-fired electricity generation project on 
land located in Rookery South Pit, near the villages of Stewartby, Millbrook, Lidlington and Marston 
Moretaine in Bedfordshire. It will include a Power Generation Plant and connections to the existing 
nearby electricity and gas networks (the Project). The Project would have a rated electrical output 
of up to 299 MW.
Who is Millbrook Power?
www.millbrookpower.co.uk
MPL is an energy development company established for the Millbrook Power project by Watt 
Power Limited. Watt Power wishes to develop a gas-fired power plant at Millbrook, as well as other 
locations across the UK, to support the UK Government’s drive to a low carbon economy.  
Planning & Public Consultation
The Project is classified as a Nationally Significant Infrastructure Project, which means that a 
Development Consent Order (DCO) is required to build, operate and maintain it. The DCO 
application will be processed and examined by the Planning Inspectorate and the final decision on 
the application will be made by the Secretary of State for Energy & Climate Change. The electrical 
and gas connections are integral to the Project and will be considered together with the Power 
Generation Plant under the DCO application. 
A phase of statutory consultation started on 13th October and will end on 16th November. This 
gives you an opportunity to comment on the Project. Consultation with local people, businesses and 
organisations is an essential part of the DCO process and will help to influence the final designs of 
the Project. 
MPL first shared its initial plans with local residents and businesses in June 2014 through the local 
media, information leaflets, non-statutory exhibitions held at Lidlington, Stewartby and Marston 
Moretaine and via the internet and social media. Since June, MPL has responded to and acted upon 
all feedback received. 
Several significant changes have occurred since June including:
 
l a reduction in the maximum height of the stacks;
 
l a narrowing of the gas connection opportunity area into two route corridors with a preferred
 
 connection route;
 
l refinement of the electrical connection opportunity area;
 
l generating equipment has been arranged to reduce the impact of noise for nearby homes.
Additionally, MPL has undertaken detailed technical and environmental studies, and associated 
design work to refine the design of the plant – this work is on-going. 
MPL is liaising closely with Central Bedfordshire Council (CBC) and Bedford Borough Council (BBC).  It 
is also engaging with the Parish Councils in the area as well as organisations such as the Environment 
Agency, Natural England and English Heritage, to ensure that the plant will be designed, built, 
operated and maintained to the highest relevant and current safety and environmental standards. 
For the purposes of pre-application consultation, MPL has prepared a Preliminary Environmental 
Information Report (PEIR) and a non-technical summary of this report. These documents are described 
in more detail in the section on “Environment”.
For more information about the DCO Application Process, please visit the Planning Inspectorate’s 
website: http://infrastructure.planningportal.gov.uk.
The Need For Gas Generation
Gas is a reliable fuel source. It is acknowledged by the Government as being essential to a low-carbon 
economy and to underpin the country’s energy security. Government Policy states that “gas will 
continue to play an important role in the electricity sector – providing vital flexibility to support an 
increasing amount of low-carbon generation and to maintain security of supply” [NPS EN-1 (Energy)].
Faced with UK-wide closures of many ageing coal and nuclear plants, investment in reliable, low 
carbon technology is needed. In addition, gas provides back-up to power generation from renewable 
sources, particularly wind power – which is an increasingly prevalent but intermittent energy source. 
Modern gas-fired power plants are among the most efficient and cleanest forms of electricity power 
generation. 
The need for the Project is established through government policy and is not a topic for consultation.
The Project’s Key Details
The key details of the proposed Project are:
 
l the construction, operation and maintenance of a Simple Cycle Gas Turbine Power 
 
 
Generation Plant with a rated electrical output of up to 299 MW of electricity; 
 
l the Power Generation Plant will produce electricity from natural gas;
 
l it is designed to provide flexible back-up generation capacity, which can respond quickly 
 
 
and efficiently to both short-term variation in customer demand and intermittent output  
 
 
from renewable power generation; 
 
l it is anticipated that it will operate for no more than 1500 hours per year;
 
l the Power Generation Plant will have up to five stacks, each up to 40 m in height;
 
l the site for the generating equipment and substation covers an area of approximately  
 
 
8 ha and is located within Rookery South Pit itself;
 
l the proposed Project includes the construction, operation and maintenance of a new 
 
 
electrical connection together with a new substation to connect the power generation   
 
 
plant to the existing overhead power line nearby;
 
l the layout of the electrical connection is yet to be finalised but an area within which the 
 
 
connection will be sited has been identified;
 
l a realistic worst case scenario of up to two overhead line double circuits [of 400 kV]  
 
 
 
(including up to six towers) has been assumed (and is being environmentally assessed);   
 
 
however MPL will continue to work with National Grid on the indicative design of the   
 
 
connection over the coming months;
 
l the proposed Project also includes the construction of a new underground pipeline to 
 
 
bring natural gas to the power generating plant from the National Gas Transmission  
 
 
 
System located nearby;
 
l at this stage, two gas connection route corridors have been identified with a preferred
 
 
connection route within one of them;
 
l the plant could enter commercial operation in 2019/20, subject to public consultation, 
 
 
planning and financing;
Continued consultation and environmental assessment on the connection route options and 
possible electrical connection is required before each can be confirmed. In addition, although a 
preliminary preferred layout of the Power Generation Plant has been identified, the final location 
and layout are yet to be determined.

Why Rookery South Pit?
It has three advantages:
1. Proximity to the national gas and electricity transmission networks
2. National Grid encourages new power generation development in the region
3. Rookery South Pit is classified as brownfield land and is allocated by CBC for development
Illustrative visual of the five unit Power Generation Plant and electrical connection. If fewer units are required, 
they may be larger, though this will not impact the maximum stack height, which is 40 m. Additional visuals will 
be available at the exhibitions and in other consultation materials.

Community Benefits
This £200m Project would be a substantial investment in the area and would deliver significant 
economic benefits for a period of at least 25 years 
 
l creation of around 150 jobs during a 2 year construction period;
 
l creation of up to 15 permanent skilled jobs for on-going operation and maintenance of the
 
 facility;
 
l potential business opportunities for local suppliers. 
MPL will consult CBC and BBC on ways to bring wider social and environmental benefits to the 
surrounding area.
Environment
MPL’s steps to mitigate the impact of the Project on the local environment, during its construction, 
operation and maintenance, are a major part of the consultation and planning process. 
Due to the nature and size of the Project, MPL is undertaking an Environmental Impact Assessment 
(EIA). The EIA considers the potential positive and negative impacts of the Project and MPL has 
published its interim findings in the PEIR.  These findings indicate the following key potential 
impacts, all of which will be mitigated through the final design process:
 
l transport - potential impact to the local road network from traffic associated with the   
 
 construction and decommissioning periods; 
 
l air quality and emissions – potential impact resulting from construction activities, and  
 
 
 during operation of the Power Generation Plant;
 
l noise – potential increase in background noise during construction and operation within the
  
 vicinity of the site; 
 
l visual impact and effects on cultural heritage setting – introduction of up to five 40 m stacks
 
 and up to six transmission towers into the local landscape;
 
l local ecology – no anticipated negative impacts, but opportunities to improve local habitat
 
 through additional planting. 
The PEIR, along with the non-technical summary, are available to view at the locations listed in 
the ‘Get In Touch’ section. These documents can also be viewed on the Millbrook Power website.
