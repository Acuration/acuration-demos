Will Gardiner, CEO of Drax Group, said "We have had a great first half of the year, transforming Drax into the world's
leading sustainable biomass generation and supply company as well as the UK's largest generator of renewable power by
output.
"The business has performed well, and we have exciting growth opportunities to support the global transition to a low-carbon
economy.
"Drax has reduced its generation emissions by over 90%, and we are very proud to be one of the lowest carbon intensity
power generators in Europe - a huge transformation for a business which, less than a decade ago, operated the largest coal
power station in Western Europe.
"In the past six months, we have significantly advanced our plans for BioEnergy with Carbon Capture and Storage (BECCS)
in the UK and globally. By 2030 Drax could be delivering millions of tonnes of negative emissions and leading the world in
providing a critical technology needed to tackle the climate crisis.
"We are pleased to be announcing a 10% increase in our dividend, and we remain committed to creating long-term value for
all our stakeholders."

CEO Business Review
Introduction
The world must act now to address the climate crisis and limit global warming to below 1.5 degrees Celsius. We need more
renewable energy, more flexible energy systems to make best use of intermittent wind and solar energy, and crucially,
carbon negative technologies to remove carbon from the atmosphere, helping offset the harder to abate areas, such as
agriculture and aviation. Biomass has a critical role to play in meeting these needs and Drax is leading the way and in doing
so creating global opportunities for growth.
Our purpose is to enable a zero carbon, lower cost energy future and this drives our commitment to address climate change.
Through the actions the business has taken to develop its renewable portfolio and reduce fossil fuel consumption, the
Group's carbon emissions from generation are now amongst the lowest of any power generator in Europe - a 90% reduction

since 2012. We are the UK's largest source of renewable power by output and have an ambition to become carbon negative
company by 2030.
Strategically, the first half of 2021 was pivotal for the Group, ending commercial coal generation, selling our existing gas
generation business to VPI Generation Limited for £186 million and acquiring Pinnacle Renewable Energy Inc. (Pinnacle), a
leading Canadian renewable energy company, for cash consideration of £222 million (enterprise value of C$796 million).
Through our production and use of sustainable biomass, we are developing three long-term and complementary strategic
opportunities for the Group - the sale of biomass to third parties under long-term contracts and self-supply, flexible
renewable electricity generation, and removing greenhouse gases from the atmosphere - negative emissions - using
BioEnergy Carbon Capture and Storage (BECCS).
Bioenergy is Europe's largest source of renewable energy, and we believe a critical component of the response to climate
change. We must ensure the world's forests are used in a sustainable way to fight climate change, and biomass plays its
role in that, supporting forest health, forest growth and the removal of carbon from the atmosphere. The biomass we make,
sell, and use for power generation is comprised of the residues from the forest products industry and typically includes
material such as sawdust. We do not source wood that would otherwise have been used for sawtimber or other high value
long term carbon stores. This would be unsustainable, and our Responsible Sourcing Policy prohibits us from doing so.
The UK's Climate Change Committee (CCC) has set out what is required for the country to achieve its legally binding
objective of being net zero by 2050, identifying a requirement for around 60 million tonnes per year of negative emissions
from greenhouse gas removal technologies. This includes an important role for BECCS, which is recognised by the CCC
and UK Government as the only solution for large-scale negative emissions which includes renewable power and system
support benefits.
More recently the EU noted continued support for sustainable biomass through the development of its third Renewable
Energy Directive and plans to reduce greenhouse gas emissions by at least 55% across the continent. In Japan, the
government has approved 8GW of biomass and we expect a greater role for bioenergy associated with a new target to
reduce greenhouse gases by 50% by 2030.
We believe BECCS can become a world leading, UK-led and exportable solution for large-scale negative emissions. A
recent report by the Coalition for Negative Emissions identified a global opportunity for two to four billion tonnes of negative
emissions from BECCS (using a strict sourcing criteria to ensure only sustainable biomass is used), which is necessary to
limit global warming in line with the aims of the Paris Agreement. To that end we are developing options for UK and
international markets.
As we advance our strategy, we expect to deliver higher quality earnings, create opportunities for growth aligned with the
UK's legally binding objective to become carbon neutral by 2050 and we remain committed to a sustainable and growing
dividend.
Acquisition of Pinnacle
The acquisition of Pinnacle in April 2021 transformed the Group's supply chain, making Drax the world's leading sustainable
biomass generation and supply business. It advanced our strategic objective by increasing production capacity, reducing
cost and creating a platform for growth in third-party supply.
As Pinnacle's largest customer, we know the company well and are delighted to welcome around 500 employees as new
colleagues, under the leadership of Andrea Johnston, Pinnacle's CFO. We look forward to working closely with our new
colleagues to learn from their expertise in low-cost pellet production and the commercial management of third-party supply
contracts.
Since the acquisition, our programme of work towards integration has progressed well with a high level of collaboration from
all colleagues. We are focused on the safe, efficient and sustainable production of biomass, investing where necessary to
apply our safety and operational standards across the Group.
Combining Pinnacle with our existing assets, we now operate 13 pellet plants plus four sites under development in the US
Southeast, with total nameplate production capacity of 4.9 million tonnes per annum once commissioned. These plants are
geographically diverse and sited in three major fibre baskets (British Columbia and Alberta, Canada, and the US Southeast)
with access to four deep water ports providing routes to markets in the UK, Asia and the rest of mainland Europe.
Third-party supply of biomass to customers is an important opportunity for the Group. Through Pinnacle, Drax now has $4.3
billion of contracts with high-quality customers in the UK, Asia and the rest of mainland Europe, providing diversified long-
term revenues outside of the UK. The location of our production capacity on the west coast of Canada makes it ideally
situated to supply growing demand in Asia, where we now have long-term contracts with customers in Japan and Korea.
We expect these markets to grow as sustainable biomass is used to decarbonise other economies and we are excited by
the potential this offers the Group.
We include Pinnacle in our H1 results from the date of acquisition on 13 April 2021.
Summary of H1 2021
Through the first half of 2021 we have continued our work as a Task Force on Climate-Related Financial Disclosures
(TCFD) Supporter. We are developing science-based targets and identifying opportunities for further abatement of carbon
emissions in our supply chain. Recognising the strong environmental credentials of the Group, in April 2021 Drax became a
constituent of the S&P Clean Energy Index and most recently in June, a constituent of the Active Net Zero Clean Energy
Index.
Adjusted EBITDA of £186 million from continuing and discontinued operations represents a 4% increase compared to H1
2020 (£179 million). We believe that this was a solid performance which reflected increased production of lower cost
biomass, the acquisition of Pinnacle and an improvement in the Customers business following the easing of lockdown
restrictions in the UK, offsetting additional biomass cost in Generation.

5/49
Our balance sheet is strong with cash and total committed facilities of £666 million at 30 June 2021 and we continue to
expect to return to our long-term target of around 2.0x net debt to Adjusted EBITDA by the end of 2022.
We have continued to progress our option for BECCS in the UK with the commencement of a planning consultation process
and the selection of a technology partner - Mitsubishi Heavy Industries (MHI). We expect further details on the selection of
regional carbon capture clusters and individual projects in the second half of 2021.
Safety remains our primary focus and in the first half of 2021 the Total Recordable Incident Rate was 0.14 (H1 2020: 0.32).
This is a good performance which reflects our ongoing focus on the delivery of safe, reliable and compliant operations. We
continue to operate Covid-19 secure workplaces, following relevant jurisdiction guidance and remain committed to our
programme to promote our colleagues' wellbeing.
We expect to propose a dividend for the 2021 financial year of £75 million, a 10% increase on 2020, consistent with our
policy to pay a dividend which is sustainable and expected to grow as the strategy delivers an increasing proportion of stable
earnings and cash flows. As has been our practice since we initiated the policy in 2017, 40% of the expected full year
dividend will be paid for the first six months of 2021 (£30 million, 7.5 pence per share).
H1 operational performance
Pellet Production
In North America, our Pellet Production operations reported Adjusted EBITDA of £40 million, up 60% (H1 2020: £25 million),
reflecting higher levels of production from existing operations, ongoing cost reduction plans and the acquisition of Pinnacle.
Pellet production was 1.3Mt, an increase of 70% (H1 2020: 0.8Mt), which reflects the commissioning of additional capacity
at Morehouse in addition to Pinnacle. Approximately 0.9Mt of this production was for Drax and 0.4Mt for sale to third parties
under established long-term contracts.
The Free On Board (FOB) production cost was $141/t across the enlarged portfolio, a reduction of 8% (H1 2020: $154/t),
which reflects our ongoing programme of cost reduction and supply chain improvements, and the addition of lower cost
Pinnacle production.
We expect to deliver increased capacity and further savings in the second half of 2021, associated with the continued
improvement of existing sites, the expansion of LaSalle, commissioning of Demopolis and the ongoing development of
satellite plants. The overall impact of these expansions once complete will be to increase nameplate production capacity to
4.9Mt, expected by the end of 2022, and allow greater utilisation of lower cost sawmill residues whilst leveraging our existing
infrastructure in the US Southeast.
In July 2021, we experienced a small and contained fire at our Westview port facility in Prince Rupert, British Columbia. No
one was injured but operations have been suspended temporarily to allow for repairs. Separately, forest fires in the region
have led to restrictions on rail lines with the result that pellet production and exports in Canada have been restricted in July.
To date the forest fires have not directly impacted our sites, though we remain alert in order safeguard our people and
operations. Through our enlarged and diversified supply chain we have been able to manage and limit the impact on our
own operations and those of our customers and continue to monitor potential for change which could impact our business
and that of our customers.
Generation
The portfolio produced 6% of the UK's electricity between April 2020 and April 2021 (the most recent period for which data is
available) and 12% of the UK's renewable electricity over the same period, making Drax the largest renewable generator by
output.
Adjusted EBITDA of £185 million from continuing and discontinued operations, was a decrease of 14% versus the first half
of 2020 (£214 million). This principally reflects lower achieved power prices for biomass generation and a higher cost of
biomass fuel reflecting historic forward power and foreign exchange hedging.
Our UK biomass supply chain has remained robust in the past 18 months, successfully managing the impact of Covid-19.
However, in recent months we have seen a small increase in the number of rail delivery cancellations owing to driver
availability as a result of Covid-19 restrictions and transfer plant reliability issues, which we have managed through the
flexibility of our ROC generating units, buying back power positions and reprofiling generation from the first to the second
half of the year. Biomass availability was 88% (H1 2020: 87%), including a very strong performance from the CfD unit with
availability of 97% offsetting a small increase in the forced outage rate on the ROC units, mainly associated with boiler tube
leaks and mill availability, resulting in additional buying back of power positions at higher prices.
During the summer we expect to complete a major planned outage on the CfD biomass unit, which includes the third in a
series of high-pressure turbine upgrades. Once completed we expect the unit to benefit from thermal efficiency
improvements and lower maintenance costs, incrementally reducing the cost of biomass.
Our Scottish hydro operations - Cruachan Pumped Storage Power Station (Cruachan), and the Lanark and Galloway hydro
schemes - have continued to perform well. These assets provide renewable electricity, system support services, peak power
generation and Capacity Market income. Taken together with the Daldowie energy from waste plant, Adjusted EBITDA was
£34 million (H1 2020: £35 million).
System support services (Balancing Market, ancillary services and portfolio optimisation) are an important part of the
Group's strategy. System Support Services and Optimisation - our measure of performance in the provision of these
services - was a gross profit of £70 million, a small increase on the first six months of 2020 (£66 million). This result reflects
coal operations during the first three months of 2021 before closure of commercial coal operations and a good performance
from our hydro and pumped storage assets which alongside biomass continue to represent the majority of our earnings in
this growing market.
While power prices remain an important driver of the Group's earnings, by focusing on flexible and renewable generation, its
importance has reduced. We also maintain a strong forward power sales position, with 2021 fully contracted.
In March 2021, Drax secured Capacity Market agreements for its hydro and pumped storage assets providing revenues of
around £10 million in the delivery period October 2024 to September 2025. The Group also secured 15-year agreements for

three new 299MW Open Cycle Gas Turbine (OCGT) projects in England and Wales for delivery between 2024 and 2039.
We are continuing to evaluate options for these projects, including their potential sale.
Customers
Our Customers business reported an Adjusted EBITDA loss of £5 million (H1 2020: £37 million loss). This is a significant
improvement on the first half of 2020, which was impacted by Covid-19 - principally in the SME business. The impact of
Covid-19 was in the region of £10-15 million compared to £44 million in H1 2020.
The SME supply business continued to be affected by Covid-19 restrictions in the first half of 2021 and we are continuing to
explore operational and strategic options for this segment of the business.
Looking forwards, we see a fundamental and valuable role in supporting the decarbonisation of British Industrial &
Commercial (I&C) businesses through the supply of renewable energy, asset optimisation, Electric Vehicle services and
carbon offset certificates now, and in the future negative carbon power. To capture this opportunity, we are engaged in
restructuring the Customers business, streamlining our operations with the closure of offices in Oxford and Cardiff and the
rebranding of the Haven Power I&C business to Drax.
The Group's I&C supply business performed well with significant growth in the contracted sales position to high-quality
customers. In the last 12 months we've increased the future volume of the I&C committed contract book by 27%, signing
high quality customers in our target segments. This includes three major customer wins since the start of the year, with a
combined annual supply volume of c.3TWh per year from 2022. The implied customer demand for renewable power
exceeds the generated volumes in the UK and we are well positioned with our own portfolio, as a premium for renewable
power emerges. Our development of decarbonisation propositions is targeted at six key industries: transport, agriculture,
manufacturing, utilities, public sector and education. We can support their decarbonisation at the same time as connecting
customer-side demand to system stability revenues and we believe this approach can support long-term growth.
Biomass strategy
The Group is continuing to target control of 5Mt of self-supply capacity and to reduce the cost of biomass to £50/MWh by
2027. The acquisition of Pinnacle has accelerated our progress to fulfilling these objectives and by 2022 we expect to have
annualised production capacity of 4.9Mt - with 2.0Mt contracted to third parties and 2.9Mt available for self-supply - while
continuing to reduce cost.
We intend to deliver further savings through the optimisation of existing biomass operations, greater utilisation of sawmill
residues and the use of other lower cost renewable feedstocks, such as agricultural residues. In this regard, during the first
half of 2021 Drax Power Station completed trials of four different low-cost biomass materials. One of these materials
represented 35% of the fuel mix on one biomass unit during test runs. This is a significant increase, although there remains
much work to do.
These expansion and cost reduction initiatives underpin the development of three long-term and complementary strategic
opportunities for biomass - third-party supply, BECCS and biomass generation.
Third-party supply
We expect global demand for wood pellets to increase in the current decade, as other countries develop decarbonisation
programmes that include sustainable biomass. Whilst there is an abundance of unprocessed biomass material globally
which can be sustainably sourced, there remains limited capacity to convert these materials into energy dense pellets, which
have a low-carbon footprint and lower cost associated with transportation.
With continued demand growth in Europe and Asia this decade (Hawkins Wright: The Outlook for Wood Pellets, Second
Quarter 2021) and the need for biomass expansion to support BECCS (Coalition for Negative Emissions) the global
opportunity for biomass supply is significant.
Drax now has immediate access to new markets, long-term contracts for third-party supply and the expertise to develop new
commercial relationships.
BECCS
Drax aims to become a carbon negative company by 2030, using BECCS. Through combining carbon capture and storage
(CCS) with the existing biomass generation units at Drax Power Station, we believe we can remove four million tonnes of
carbon from the atmosphere each year from 2027 and eight million by 2030. Drax Power Station is in the Humber region, an
area with the highest absolute level of carbon emissions in the UK, owing to the number of industrial sites located there. This
makes the region a natural location for large-scale carbon capture and storage infrastructure for energy and industry. We are
a participant in the East Coast Cluster (the Humber and Teesside regions combined), which is participating in the UK
Government's cluster selection competition, which we believe can bring new investment, new jobs and world-leading and
exportable negative emissions technologies to the UK.
In the second half of 2021, against a backdrop of the COP26 summit, the UK Government is expected to select at least two
regions to take forward for the development of CCS infrastructure and individual projects, such as Drax, with which it will
enter into discussions regarding the specific commercial arrangements for clusters and projects. Confirmation of support
would allow us to commence a full engineering and design study with a final investment decision in 2024.
We expect deliverability to be an important part of the UK Government's selection criteria and the technology to deliver post-
combustion BECCS exists and is proven at scale. In June 2021, Drax announced MHI as its technology partner for the
development of the first two BECCS units at Drax Power Station, following trials of MHI's technology which commenced in
the second half of 2020.
In addition, we are progressing innovative technology options, including C-Capture - a partnership with Drax, Leeds
University, IP Group and BP - which has developed an organic solvent which could be used for BECCS and deliver
significant long-term cost savings for future projects.
Outside of the UK, in June 2021, we announced an agreement with Bechtel, a leading global engineering company, to
explore options and locations to develop new-build BECCS plants across the globe, including North America. We are also

7/49
working with Phoenix BioPower to identify opportunities to deliver improvements to the thermal efficiency of new-build
BECCS, which could result in a material reduction in costs.
Biomass generation
The UK needs more renewable electricity and Drax Power Station is the largest single source of renewable electricity in the
UK by output. It is also an important source of system support services, which becomes more important as the power
system becomes increasingly reliant on intermittent renewables, such as wind and solar. Through improved operational
efficiency and reduced operating costs, associated with ending coal generation, we are continuing to enhance the
opportunity for a long-term biomass generation model at Drax Power Station.
Biomass sustainability
When sustainably sourced, biomass is renewable, and sustainably sourced biomass is an important part of both UK and
European renewable energy policy.
The legal frameworks and science which underpins this assessment is clear. Carbon emitted in the generation of renewable
electricity is absorbed by and accounted for in the growth of forest stock. This is based on well-established principles set out
by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, a UN body which reconfirmed its long-standing position on sustainably
sourced biomass in 2019. This interpretation is reflected in the European Union's second Renewable Energy Directive
(REDII) and Taxonomy rules, which mirror REDII.
In July 2021, the European Commission began the development of REDIII. We expect this process to reflect increased
ambition around renewable energy and decarbonisation in Europe including the continued evolution of rules around
sustainable biomass sourcing. As a user and supplier of sustainable biomass we welcome robust standards and look
forward to contributing to the development of REDIII.
In the US Southeast, the source for most of our biomass, increased demand for wood fibre has directly contributed to
increased growth and protection of forests. Inventories have increased by over 90% since 1950 as a result of which more
carbon is stored year after year, despite harvests also increasing.
Our forestry commitments are based on the latest available science from Forest Research, the UK's principal organisation
for forest science. Our responsible resourcing policy aims to ensure we only source biomass that makes a net positive
contribution to climate change, protects and enhances biodiversity and has a positive social impact on local communities.
All of our woody biomass supplies and suppliers are verified and audited against Forestry Stewardship Council® (FSC)
(licence number C119787), Programme for the Endorsement of Forest Certification (PEFC) and Sustainable Biomass
Program (SBP) requirements. We are externally audited and independently assured on an annual basis.
Our policy goes beyond compliance, and an Independent Advisory Board (IAB), chaired by Sir John Beddington, provides
guidance and independent oversight on the sourcing choices we make. The advice and scrutiny from the IAB means
stakeholders can be assured that Drax will keep our policies under review and that the biomass we use takes account of the
latest scientific research and best practice.
Other developments
We are continuing to develop a long-term option for the expansion of Cruachan, which could create a 1GW pumped storage
power station (currently 0.4GW) and commenced a planning application process in June 2021. Its location, flexible operating
modes and ability to store power from wind generation, in addition to providing a full range of system support services,
makes it strategically important to the UK power system and aligned with its future needs. Any investment decision will be
dependent on the right regulatory support.
Outlook
Our expectations for full-year Adjusted EBITDA remain unchanged, assuming good operational availability for the remainder
of 2021 and no additional significant impact from Covid-19 in the second half of the year. These assumptions also underpin
our expectation for the full year dividend.
In Pellet Production, we are focused on the continued production of good quality pellets at the lowest cost as well as
commissioning additional sites, and expect to deliver further cost savings in the second half of 2021.
In Generation, we expect to complete the major planned outage at Drax Power Station, whilst providing high levels of
flexible renewable electricity to the UK power system.
In Customers, we are focused on opportunities to develop our I&C business, including a rebranding of this business to Drax
and we continue to assess options for SME.
Drax has repositioned itself in the last decade from a single site fossil fuel generator to the world's leading sustainable
biomass generation and supply business, with growth opportunities aligned with the need for more renewables, negative
emissions and more flexible energy systems.
Our principal focus remains the expansion of our biomass options and we are making good progress with the delivery of our
strategy. We will build on this as we continue to play an important role in our markets as well as realising our purpose of
enabling a zero carbon, lower cost energy future.

Introduction
Financial performance has been robust during the first half of the year, with Adjusted EBITDA from continuing and
discontinued operations of £186 million, growing 4% compared to the same period last year. We have also made significant
strategic progress in the first half of the year.
On 13 April 2021, we completed the acquisition of Pinnacle for total cash consideration of C$385 million or £222 million[1]
(enterprise value of C$796 million). The acquisition advances the Group's biomass strategy, expanding production capacity,

9/49
reducing the average cost of biomass production and creating a platform to expand third-party biomass sales.
Provisional goodwill, translated at the balance sheet date, of £163 million associated with the acquisition has been
recognised in the Condensed consolidated balance sheet. Amounts will be finalised over the 12-month period post
acquisition, but we do not expect material changes. The results of Pinnacle have been presented as part of the Group's
Pellet Production segment and are in line with our expectations for the period post-acquisition to 30 June 2021.
On 31 January 2021, we completed the disposal of our portfolio of CCGT power stations to VPI Generation Limited. The
initial cash consideration in respect of the disposal was £188 million with contingent consideration of £29m still outstanding,
resulting in a net accounting profit on disposal of £9 million and a strong return on the assets over our period of ownership.
The receipt of the contingent consideration is dependent on the development of options associated with the Damhead Creek
site. The completion accounts in respect of the transaction were finalised in July 2021 to give final consideration, before
contingent consideration, of £186 million, with no change to the profit on disposal.
During the period, Adjusted EBITDA from continuing and discontinued operations for Generation of £185 million reduced
compared to £214 million in the first half of 2020, reflecting weaker year-on-year hedged power prices and hedged foreign
exchange rates. We hedge power prices out to approximately two years in advance and therefore achieved power prices in
the period reflect hedges placed primarily in 2019 and 2020 when prices were lower than they are currently. We hedge
foreign exchange rates on a quarterly basis up to approximately five years in advance and the hedged GBP rate for the
period is reflective of the period of significant uncertainty in advance of the Brexit vote in June 2016.
Our CfD unit will come offline in the summer for its planned maintenance outage and as a result the contribution to the
Group's financial performance from Generation will be reduced in the second half of the year.
We have seen an improvement in our Customers business year-on-year, following the impact of Covid-19 in 2020. An
Adjusted EBITDA loss of £5 million in the six months ended 30 June 2021 includes a £10 - £15 million detrimental impact
from Covid-19. In the six months ended 30 June 2020, an Adjusted EBITDA loss of £37 million included £44 million of
Covid-19 impact.
We have seen a strong recovery in demand in the I&C supply business, with electricity supplied above pre-Covid levels,
however SME supply remains significantly lower, both due to the restrictions in place during the period associated with the
pandemic and as a result of the tighter customer credit criteria we have implemented. Overall volumes supplied increased to
9.0TWh in the period from 8.8TWh in the first half of 2020. We are continuing to review operational and strategic options for
the SME business.
In Pellet Production, we continue to make good progress with our biomass cost reduction initiatives and the acquisition of
Pinnacle contributed to a reduction in the cost per tonne in the first half of 2021, when compared to 2020, of 8%.
Total central costs increased to £31 million when compared to £23 million for the six months ended 30 June 2020, driven by
an increased investment in Innovation and BECCS. Further, in the six months ended 30 June 2020 we recorded lower
variable employee costs reflecting the impact of Covid-19 on expectations for the full year.
Total operating profit for the period of £84 million is significantly higher than the equivalent period last year, inclusive of
derivative remeasurement gains of £20 million. The operating loss of £57 million for the first six months of 2020 included
asset obsolescence charges associated with coal closure of £224 million, partially offset by derivative remeasurement gains
of £94 million.
Our liquidity position remains strong, with available cash and committed facilities at 30 June 2021 of £666 million (31
December 2020: £682 million). In February 2021, the outstanding commitments under the infrastructure term loan facilities
agreed in 2020, totalling £45 million and €95 million, were drawn down in full. Net debt at 30 June 2021 was £1,029 million,
resulting in a net debt to Adjusted EBITDA ratio for the rolling 12-month period ended 30 June 2021 of 2.5x. We expect this
to increase to 3.0x by the end of 2021, before returning to around 2.0x by the end of 2022.
Total cash generated from operations in the period was £138 million (six months ended 30 June 2020: £226 million). The
reduction compared to the first six months of 2020 principally reflects the actions taken in the six months ended 30 June
2020 to reinforce liquidity and working capital through the onset of the Covid-19 pandemic, with resulting working capital
outflows in the six months ended 30 June 2021 including those associated with the rebasing of financial instruments.
Excluding this, and the working capital impact associated with the disposal of the CCGT portfolio and the vertical integration
of Pinnacle, Adjusted EBITDA cash conversion was close to 100% in both periods.
We remain committed to payment of a sustainable and growing dividend. The Board has resolved to pay an interim dividend
in respect of the six months ended 30 June 2021 of 7.5 pence per share (six months ended 30 June 2020: 6.8 pence per
share), representing 40% of the expected full year dividend.

Our Generation business contributed Adjusted EBITDA from continuing and discontinued operations of £185 million (six
months ended 30 June 2020: £214 million), which included a £21 million contribution from the CCGT portfolio prior to
disposal on 31 January 2021 (six months ended 30 June 2020: £19 million covering the whole period). These assets
benefitted from high power prices in the final month of our ownership to deliver a strong performance.
The overall Adjusted EBITDA contribution from Generation reduced by £29 million when compared to the six months ended
30 June 2020. This reflects entering 2021 with lower hedged biomass spreads, owing to power prices and exchange rates
prevailing at the time the hedges were placed. We hedge power prices up to approximately two years in advance, and if the
higher power prices observed in the current period persist the benefit of this will start to flow through our results in future
years.
Despite this, underlying operational performance was strong, with availability and output broadly in line with the prior year.
Total output from our biomass generation units of 7.6TWh, increased from 7.4TWh for the first six months of 2020, and was
underpinned by excellent availability for the CfD unit of 97% (six months ended 30 June 2020: 88%). However, output from
the RO units was restricted due to challenges in getting biomass to site, as we saw an impact from train cancellations due to
drivers being required to self-isolate due to Covid-19, and an increase in the level of unplanned outages compared to our
expectations. The higher power prices in the current period noted above increased the cost of buying back power to cover
these outages.
Our coal units closed for commercial generation as planned in March 2021. As a result, coal contributed a modest
proportion of total generation in the period, although achieved spreads were higher than the same period in 2020 due to
higher power prices. The coal units also delivered value through the balancing mechanism. The units remain available to
meet their obligations under Capacity Market contracts until September 2022 and are only expected to run if called upon by
the System Operator to meet balancing or capacity market requirements.
Our pumped storage and hydro assets in Scotland continued to perform well, contributing significantly to overall gross
margin from system support activity of £70 million (six months ended 30 June 2020: £66 million) which represents a strong
underlying performance following the disposal of the CCGT portfolio in January. In addition, in March 2021 we secured
Capacity Market contracts for these assets with a value of c.£10 million for the delivery period from October 2024 to
September 2025, which is in addition to existing contracts to September 2024.
Generation performance in the second half of the year will be impacted by a planned maintenance outage on the CfD unit.
The outage includes a high-pressure turbine upgrade which will reduce future maintenance costs and improve thermal
efficiency, contributing to lower costs of generation for this unit when it returns to service later in the year. We expect higher
levels of RO generation in the second half of the year compared to the first, as we can rephase generation lost due to
outages described above. However, financial performance for the Generation business will be reduced when compared to
the first half.
We are continuing to make strong progress in Pellet Production. Adjusted EBITDA from this segment was £40 million, £15
million ahead of £25 million for the same period last year. This result reflects the inclusion of Pinnacle post-acquisition on 13
April 2021. Including the contribution from Pinnacle, we produced 1.3Mt and shipped 1.3Mt in the first half of the year, of
which approximately two-thirds were for our own use at Drax Power Station (six months ended 30 June 2020: 0.8Mt
produced and 0.8Mt shipped respectively, entirely for own use at Drax Power Station).
Biomass cost-saving remains a key strategic focus and we are making good progress against our target to reduce
production costs to £50/MWh by 2027. The average cost of pellets produced in the first half of the year for our expanded
portfolio of $141/tonne was 8% lower than $154/tonne in the six months ended 30 June 2020. Pellet quality continued to
improve in the period, with fines at disport of 3.6%, compared to an average of 5.0% in 2020.
Our Customers business delivered an Adjusted EBITDA loss of £5 million, including an estimated impact of Covid-19 in the
region of £10-£15 million for this business in the six months ended 30 June 2021. This represents a significant improvement
compared to the first half of 2020 (an Adjusted EBITDA loss of £37 million) which was severely impacted by losses of £44
million as a result of the onset of the Covid-19 pandemic.
During 2021, we have seen a recovery in demand in the I&C supply business, although SME supply continues to be
affected by the restrictions in place during the period associated with the pandemic. Overall volumes supplied increased to
9.0TWh in the period (six months ended 30 June 2020: 8.8TWh).
In the last 12 months we've increased the future volume of the I&C committed contract book by 27%, signing high quality
customers in our target segments. This includes three major customer wins since the start of the year, with a combined
annual supply volume of c.3TWh per year from 2022.
Having reflected an increase in bad debt expectations during 2020, such charges have reduced to £8 million in the six
months ended 30 June 2021, compared to £26 million for the same period in 2020. We believe that the provision coverage
remains appropriate across billed and unbilled debt, with an overall bad debt provision on the balance sheet of £51 million at
30 June 2021 (31 December 2020: £55 million) and lower overall levels of gross debt.
We are continuing to explore operational and strategic options for this part of our business. We are engaging in some
restructuring of the Customers business, streamlining our operations with the closure of offices in Oxford and Cardiff and the
rebranding of the Haven Power I&C business to Drax.
We incurred costs of £2 million in respect of these activities in the six months ended 30 June 2021 and we anticipate further
costs will be incurred in the second half of the year.
Central and other costs, which reflect our core services functions, including Innovation, increased to £31 million from £23
million in the first six months of 2020. The increase of £8 million includes continued investment and development in key
innovation projects such as BECCS and the Zero Carbon Humber project in addition to lower variable employee costs in
2020 reflecting expected performance for the full year following the onset of Covid-19. The profile of these costs, by their

nature, is not uniform across the year. Nonetheless, we continue to expect that full year costs for core services will remain
broadly in line with 2020, with an increase in costs in Innovation and capital projects as we progress our strategy.

Results for 2020 have been re-presented to show the results of the CCGT portfolio disposed of on 31 January 2021 as discontinued operations.
Adjusted EBITDA is stated after deducting amounts attributable to non-controlling interests. Such amounts were negligible in the six months ended 30
June 2021.
A reconciliation of the results for continuing and discontinued operations is provided in the table below.
 
Total Operating Profit/(Loss)
The Total operating profit for the period of £84 million compares to a loss of £57 million for the six months ended 30 June
2020. This includes the impact of remeasurement gains and losses on derivative contracts and relevant exceptional items
that are excluded from the Group's Adjusted results. The combined effect of certain remeasurements and exceptional items
on Total operating profit in the period was a credit of £8 million (six months ended 30 June 2020: charge of £130 million).
Net fair value remeasurement gains on derivative contracts included in Total operating profit were £20 million (six months
ended 30 June 2020 re-presented: gains of £94 million) reflecting movements in the mark-to-market position on our portfolio
of commodity and financial derivative contracts, to the extent they do not qualify for hedge accounting. The nature and
purpose of our portfolio of derivative contracts is described in more detail in notes 15 and 16 to the Condensed Consolidated
Interim Financial Statements.
The gains in the first half of the year are the result of market price movements across our portfolio of commodity contracts,
partially offset by the effect of the slight strengthening of sterling during the first half of the year on our FX portfolio. The size
of our forward currency purchase book means that small changes in market exchange rates can drive significant unrealised
gains and losses in our Total results.
Exceptional items for the first half of 2021 recognised in Total operating profit include transaction and integration costs in
respect of the acquisition of Pinnacle of £10 million and initial costs in relation to the strategic review of the Customers
business of £2 million.
Within discontinued operations, the gain on disposal of the CCGT portfolio recorded in the six months ended 30 June 2021,
of £15 million, has also been treated as an exceptional item. Fees and mark-to-market losses directly attributable to the
transaction, totalling £7 million, were recognised as an expense in 2020. When combined with the trading result from the
CCGTs of £21 million for January and derivative remeasurement losses of £3 million, Total operating profit from discontinued
operations for the first half of 2021 was £33 million (six months ended 30 June 2020: £25 million).
In the first six months of 2020, the Group recognised significant exceptional asset obsolescence charges associated with the
previously announced closure of coal (£224 million).
Profit After Tax and Earnings per Share
Adjusted profit after tax from continuing and discontinued operations of £58 million compares to £43 million for the first six
months of 2020 resulting in Adjusted earnings per share (EPS) of 15 pence (six months ended 30 June 2020: 11 pence).
In addition to the increase in Adjusted EBITDA described above, improvements in Adjusted profit after tax and EPS largely
reflect a reduction in depreciation and amortisation charges following coal closure and sale of the CCGT portfolio and a
reduction in the tax charge applicable to Adjusted profits.
Net interest charges included in Adjusted results were £32 million (six months ended 30 June 2020: £28 million). This
includes £3 million as a result of the additional debt acquired as part of the Pinnacle transaction, which was subsequently
refinanced on 13 July 2021 (see below). Foreign exchange gains arising on the retranslation of monetary assets at the
balance sheet date were £2 million, compared to £4 million in the first half of 2020.
Discontinued operations contributed an Adjusted profit after tax of £19 million, compared to £8 million for the same period in
2020. As described above, high power prices and balancing market activity in January delivered a strong performance from
the CCGT portfolio. No depreciation was charged in 2021, following the classification of the assets as held for sale in
December 2020 (six months ended 30 June 2020: depreciation charges of £9 million).
The Total profit after tax for continuing and discontinued operations of £24 million represents a significant increase from a
loss of £56 million for the first six months of 2020. Basic EPS of 6 pence for the first six months of 2021 compares to a loss

of 14 pence for the first six months of 2020.
Total profit after tax includes remeasurements on derivative contracts and exceptional items, as described above, net of the
tax impact associated with these items.
The total tax charge for the period was £58 million (six months ended 30 June 2020: credit of £10 million) and is comprised
of a tax charge of £5 million on Adjusted pre-tax profits and a tax charge of £53 million in relation to derivative
remeasurements and exceptional items. The tax charge for exceptional items includes a non-cash charge of £48 million due
to revaluation of deferred tax balances following the increase in UK corporation tax rates from 19% to 25% with effect from
April 2023. Reflecting the size and scale of the charge, it has been treated as an exceptional item in the Condensed
Consolidated Interim Financial Statements. The tax charge in relation to discontinued operations was £2 million.
Total profit after tax includes remeasurements on derivative contracts and exceptional items, as described above, net of the
tax impact associated with these items.
The effective tax rate applicable to the Group's Adjusted pre-tax profits from continuing operations, before taking into
account the effect of changes in tax rates, of 11% (six months ended 30 June 2020: 13%) is lower than the standard rate of
corporation tax in the UK and takes into account the effect of higher tax rates in overseas jurisdictions. For interim periods,
the effective tax rate is based on our forecast tax rate for the full year, which benefits from patent box and the "super-
deduction" for qualifying plant and machinery expenditure that was announced in March 2021.

Adjusted EBITDA is stated after deducting amounts attributable to non-controlling interests. Such amounts were negligible in the six months ended 30
June 2021.
See notes 6 and 10 to the Condensed Consolidated Interim Financial Statements for further information.
 
Capital Expenditure
We maintain a disciplined approach to capital expenditure, with all significant projects subject to appraisal and prioritisation
by a Capital Committee prior to approval. This committee ensures our overall adherence to our capital allocation policy and
maintenance of an appropriate net debt to Adjusted EBITDA profile.
Total capital expenditure of £71 million in the first half of 2021 was lower than £78 million in the first six months of 2020.
Key developments in the period include progress with the expansion at our La Salle pellet plant, which will increase
production capacity by 150kt per annum when it is commissioned in the third quarter of 2021, investment in the new
Demopolis pellet plant acquired as part of the Pinnacle transaction, which is expected to come online in the second half of
the year, and further investment in our OCGT projects after three of the projects achieved Capacity Market contracts in
March 2021.

file:///C:/Users/fensomb/AppData/Local/Microsoft/Windows/INetCache/IE/ITFHD74A/announcement2210124.html
13/49
The overall reduction year-on-year principally reflects the timing of further expansion spend in Pellet Production. Following
the acquisition of Pinnacle, we are assessing investment opportunities across the enlarged Pellet Production business and
as a result the timing of some capital expenditure has been deferred to the second half of 2021.
We expect capital expenditure for the full year to be between £210 and £230 million.
Cash and Net Debt
A strong focus on cash flow discipline is underpinned by prudent risk management which provides protection in times of
economic uncertainty and a strong platform from which to execute our strategy.
Our liquidity position remains strong. The Group had available cash and committed facilities of £666 million at 30 June 2021,
a small decrease from £682 million at 31 December 2020. This excludes approximately £48 million of Canadian committed
facilities available at 30 June 2021 that were taken on as part of the Pinnacle acquisition that were refinanced on 13 July
2021.
Cash generated from operations in the six months ended 30 June 2021 was £138 million (six months ended 30 June 2020:
£226 million) before interest and tax payments. The reduction compared to the previous period is predominantly the result of
outflows related to the unwind of cash benefits associated with action taken in the first half of 2020 as we released cash to
reinforce liquidity in the early part of the Covid-19 pandemic. The largest component of this was associated with the rebasing
of derivative contracts, which was a net cash outflow of £27 million, compared to an inflow of £40 million for the six months
ended 30 June 2020. When taken alongside the one-time impacts on working capital as a result of acquiring Pinnacle and
disposing of the CCGT portfolio, our underlying Adjusted EBITDA to operating cash flow conversion rate remains strong, at
around 100% in both periods.
Net cash generated from operating activities in the period was £115 million (six months ended 30 June 2020: £168 million),
after interest paid of £31 million (six months ended 30 June 2020: £27 million) and a tax refund of £8 million (six months
ended 30 June 2020: taxes paid of £32 million). The tax refund largely reflects the return of overpayments in relation to
previous years. The introduction of the "super-deduction" in the 2021 Finance Act is expected to result in minimal
corporation tax payable by the Group in 2021 and 2022.
The overall net cash inflow for the period was £116 million (six months ended 30 June 2020: inflow of £71 million), after cash
payments for capital expenditure of £63 million (six months ended 30 June 2020: £59 million), dividend payments of £41
million (six months ended 30 June 2020: £38 million), net proceeds from new borrowings and repayments of existing
facilities of £125 million (six months ended 30 June 2020: £nil) and a net cash outflow in respect of acquisitions and
disposals, net of fees and cash acquired and disposed of £18 million (six months ended 30 June 2020: £nil).
As a result, closing cash at 30 June 2021 was £406 million (31 December 2020: £290 million). As described in further detail
below, during July 2021 we concluded the buy-out of a minority interest in Alabama Pellets LLC for cash consideration of
US$30 million and utilised approximately C$130 million of existing cash reserves in part repayment of borrowings in the
wider refinancing of debt facilities acquired as part of the Pinnacle transaction.
During 2020, the Group entered into a new infrastructure term loan facilities agreement with committed funds in both sterling
(£98 million) and euro (€127 million) with a range of maturities between 2024 and 2030. £45 million and €95 million
remained undrawn under these facilities at 31 December 2020, with both subsequently drawn down in February 2021.
Total borrowings at 30 June 2021, net of deferred financing costs, were £1,434 million (31 December 2020: £1,066 million),
resulting in net debt at 30 June 2021 of £1,029 million (31 December 2020: £776 million), after adjusting for amounts
attributable to non-controlling interests. As in previous periods, our calculation of net debt excludes lease liabilities, see note
14 of the Condensed Consolidated Interim Financial Statements for further information.
Our net debt to Adjusted EBITDA ratio, based on reported Adjusted EBITDA for the last 12 months of £419 million, was 2.5x
at 30 June 2021 compared to 1.9x at 31 December 2020, reflecting the Pinnacle acquisition and CCGT divestment. We
expect a ratio of approximately 3.0x at the end of 2021, driven by capital expenditure being weighted to the second half of
the year, the minority interest buy-out in July 2021 and the impact of the CfD unit outage as described above, before
returning to around 2.0x by the end of 2022.
On 13 July 2021, the Group completed the refinancing of the Canadian dollar facilities it acquired as part of the acquisition of
Pinnacle in April 2021, which had a cost of over 5.5%. The new facilities include a C$300 million term loan and C$10 million
revolving credit facility (RCF). The facilities mature in 2024, diversify the Group's sources of funds, further reduce the
Group's all-in cost of debt to below 3.5%, and include an embedded ESG component which adjusts the margin payable
based on the Group's carbon intensity measured against an annual benchmark. These new facilities, alongside existing
cash reserves, refinanced the approximately C$435 million drawn under the acquired facilities at the refinancing date.
In addition to cash on hand, the Group has access to a £300 million ESG RCF, available to manage low points in the cash
cycle, which expires in 2025. No cash has been drawn under the RCF for over three years. Available cash on hand and
committed undrawn facilities provide substantial headroom over our short-term liquidity requirements.
Net cash released from working capital was £4 million (six months ended 30 June 2020: £18 million released from working
capital), which includes one-off outflows because of cash absorbed by the vertical integration of Pinnacle and disposal of the
CCGT portfolio.
As described above, in previous periods the Group has rebased several foreign currency contracts as a cost-effective
means of accessing additional liquidity, which resulted in a working capital benefit. That benefit has fully unwound at 30 June
2021 (total cash released from rebased foreign currency trades still outstanding at 31 December 2020 was £24 million). A
similar exercise for cross-currency swaps resulted in cash released from outstanding trades at 30 June 2021 of £54 million
(31 December 2020: £57 million). The overall net outflow associated with rebasing activity in the six months ended 30 June
2021 was therefore £27 million.
Historically, cash from ROCs has typically been realised several months after the ROC was earned, at the end of the ROC
compliance period; however, the Group is able to limit the overall impact of ROCs on working capital by making separate
sales and purchases in the compliance period. During the first half of 2021, such transactions generated a net cash outflow
of £34 million due to more purchases than sales in the period, contributing to an overall working capital outflow from ROCs
of £268 million as the level of ROC assets held on the balance sheet also increased due to generation in the period. The

14/49
Group also has access to facilities enabling it to sell ROC trade receivables arising on a non-recourse basis. Utilisation of
these facilities at 30 June 2021 was £49 million (31 December 2020: £nil).
In addition, the Group has access to a £200 million receivables monetisation facility, which accelerates associated cash
flows and mitigates exposure to credit risk, as well as a number of payment facilities to leverage scale and efficiencies in
transaction processing. We also facilitate a supply chain financing scheme, which enables certain suppliers to accelerate
liquidity and which supports the wider working capital efficiency of the Group. There are no changes to the Group's payment
terms under this arrangement, nor would there be if the arrangement was to fall away. More information in respect of cash
and liquidity is set out in note 13 to the Condensed Consolidated Interim Financial Statements.
We hold a large portfolio of forward and option contracts for various commodities and financial products. These contracts
are held to de-risk the business, by protecting the sterling value of future cash flows in relation to the sale of power or
purchase of key commodities. We manage our exposures in accordance with our trading and risk management policies.
These policies provide flexibility to optimise our trading position, working capital and liquidity when market conditions allow,
whilst ensuring downside protection and prudent risk management are maintained. We continue to monitor opportunities on
an ongoing basis.
 
Distributions
The Group remains committed to its established capital allocation policy, through which it aims to maintain a strong balance
sheet; invest in the core business; pay a sustainable and growing dividend and return surplus capital beyond investment
requirements to shareholders.
At the Annual General Meeting on 21 April 2021, shareholders approved payment of a final dividend for the year ended
31 December 2020 of 10.3 pence per share (£41 million). The final dividend was paid on 14 May 2021.
On 28 July, the Board resolved to pay an interim dividend for the six months ended 30 June 2021 of 7.5 pence per share
(£30 million), representing 40% of the expected full year dividend. The interim dividend will be paid on 8 October 2021 with a
record date of 27 August 2021.
The Board expects to recommend a full year dividend of £75 million with regards to the 2021 financial year.
The Board is confident that this level of dividend is sustainable and expects it to grow as the implementation of the business
strategy generates an increasing proportion of stable earnings and cash flows. In determining the rate of growth in dividends
the Board will take account of future investment opportunities and the less predictable cash flows from the Group's
commodity-based businesses. If there is a build-up of capital in excess of the Group's investment needs the Board will
consider the most appropriate mechanism to return this to shareholders.
 
Other Information
Sale of CCGT Portfolio
On 31 January 2021, the Group completed the sale of its CCGT portfolio to VPI Generation Limited for cash consideration of
up to £193 million, subject to customary adjustments. This included £29 million of contingent consideration associated with
the option to develop the site at Damhead Creek. The sale price represents a return over the Group's period of ownership
significantly ahead of the Group's weighted average cost of capital.
The Group received initial consideration of £188 million in February 2021, which included £24 million in respect of customary
working capital adjustments. A completion accounts process concluded in July 2021, subsequent to the balance sheet date,
that finalised working capital adjustments at £22 million, amending the initial consideration to £186 million.
The Group realised a profit on disposal of £15 million in the Condensed consolidated income statement for the six months
ended 30 June 2021. This includes an assessment of the fair value of the contingent consideration, which remains unpaid at
the date of this report. In addition, we incurred £3 million of transaction costs and £3 million of associated mark-to-market
losses that were expensed to the income statement in 2020, giving an overall net gain on disposal of £9 million. See note 11
to the Condensed Consolidated Interim Financial Statements for further information.
In the Condensed Consolidated Interim Financial Statements, the results of the CCGT portfolio for the period prior to
disposal in 2021 (Adjusted revenue of £52 million, Adjusted EBITDA of £21 million and Adjusted profit after tax of £19
million), have been presented as discontinued operations. The gain on disposal and derivative remeasurements associated
with the portfolio have also been presented within discontinued operations as exceptional items. The Condensed
consolidated income statement for the six months ended 30 June 2020 has been re-presented to show the results for the
CCGT portfolio on a consistent basis as discontinued operations. See note 10 to the Condensed Consolidated Interim
Financial Statements for further detail.
Acquisition of Pinnacle Renewable Energy Inc.
On 8 February 2021, the Group announced the proposed acquisition of 100% of the issued share capital of Pinnacle at a
price of C$11.30 per share.
The acquisition subsequently completed on 13 April 2021. Total consideration, paid in Canadian dollars on the completion
date, amounted to C$385 million. Transaction and integration costs of £10 million have been recognised in the Condensed
consolidated income statement as an exceptional item.
Following the acquisition, the Group now controls 13 operational pellet plants, with satellite development projects and a
further plant under construction. This will result in a total nameplate capacity of 4.9 million tonnes per annum once all
developments are commissioned. The acquisition supports the Group's strategic objectives by increasing production
capacity, reducing biomass production costs and creating a platform for growth in third-party supply. Furthermore, the
transaction transforms the Group's supply chain and positions the Group as the world's leading sustainable biomass
generation and supply business.
Financial information in respect of the acquisition, including the fair value of assets and liabilities acquired and an initial
calculation of goodwill, plus information regarding minority interests, is included in note 11 to the Condensed Consolidated
28/07/2021

Interim Financial Statements. Given the limited time between completion of the acquisition and the approval of this report, all
values in relation to the acquisition of Pinnacle are provisional.
Subsequent to the balance sheet date, on 13 July 2021, the Group acquired a 20% minority interest in Alabama Pellets LLC
(a non-wholly owned subsidiary of Pinnacle) from The Westervelt Company for US$30 million cash consideration. The
acquisition increases the Group's interest in Alabama Pellets LLC, which owns the Aliceville and Demopolis pellet plants,
with a combined capacity of 660kt per annum, from 70% to 90%.
 
Going Concern
We continue to monitor and assess developments and the potential future impact of the Covid-19 pandemic on our
operations and financial performance. As described above, our financial performance in the first half of 2021 was robust,
delivering improved profitability and cash flow compared to the same period last year.
In addition, we have maintained a strong balance sheet with a net debt to Adjusted EBITDA from continuing and
discontinued operations ratio of 2.5x at 30 June 2021. Post the acquisition of Pinnacle this ratio is expected to increase to
3.0x by the end of 2021 but we remain on track to return to our long-term target of around 2.0x by the end of 2022.
Our financing platform is stable, with the majority of our principal debt repayments due from 2025 onwards and significant
liquidity headroom available from both committed and uncommitted facilities.
Looking forward, our business plan for the remainder of the current year and beyond reflects our central assumptions
regarding the likely duration of impacts from the Covid-19 pandemic and the nature of associated restrictions such as social
distancing. These factors, combined with wider macroeconomic considerations, can affect the demand for, and price of,
power. We continue to expect an ongoing impact, when compared to pre-Covid expectations, in our Customers business,
due to the reduction in demand and increased bad debt risk described above.
The Group refreshes its business plan and forecasts throughout the year, including scenario modelling designed to test the
resilience of the Group's financial position and performance to a number of downside scenarios. Based on its review of the
latest forecast, the Board is satisfied that the Group has sufficient headroom in its available cash and committed facilities,
when combined with available mitigating actions, to be able to meet its liabilities as they fall due for the foreseeable future
across a range of scenarios.
Consequently, the directors have a reasonable expectation that the Group will continue in existence for the next 12 months
and therefore, have adopted the going concern basis when preparing the Condensed Consolidated Interim Financial
Statements.
 
The contents of the Business and Financial reviews were approved by the Board on 28 July 2021.
 
Principal risks and uncertainties
The Group's financial and operating performance is subject to various risks and uncertainties. Several of these risks are not
directly within the Group's control, such as the wider economic and political environment. We seek to manage and address
the potential impact of the risks faced by the Group in accordance with policies approved by the Board and management,
applying the Group's risk management framework. The Board monitors the risks and uncertainties, considering the changes
to those risks over time, the possible measures to mitigate such risks and the approach which might be taken in managing
residual risks to the Group.
The Board, as part of its half year processes, considered reports from management reviewing the principal risks and
uncertainties and how these might evolve during the second half of 2021. This review took account of the ongoing Covid-19
pandemic, the potential adverse effects of Brexit and the acquisition of Pinnacle Renewable Energy Inc. (Pinnacle) on 13
April 2021.
Following this review the Board is satisfied that the Group's principal risks remain materially unchanged. These are:
1. Environment, health and safety
2. Political and regulatory
3. Strategic
4. Biomass acceptability
5. Plant operations
6. Trading and commodity
7. Information systems and security
8. Climate change
9. People
As was detailed in the Shareholder Circular, there were a number of risks identified in relation to the acquisition and
integration of Pinnacle. Actions are already being taken to integrate Pinnacle into the Group's standard operating
procedures. Actions are also in progress to provide for appropriate mitigation of integration risks which will continue through
the second half of the year.
Further details of the Group's principal risks and uncertainties can be found on pages 66 - 77 of the 2020 Annual Report and
Accounts, which is available at www.drax.com.
Covid-19
The ongoing Covid-19 pandemic continues to have a significant impact on many aspects of society and the global economy,
and the duration and depth of the impacts remain uncertain. The resulting market environment in 2020 led to a significant
28/07/2021

16/49
reduction in demand for power and an increase in the costs of selling pre-contracted power back into the market. Although
trading has now normalised for our Generation business, we continue to see an impact on our Customers business, with
ongoing risk of business failure and bad debt in the smaller businesses we supply. Against this backdrop we have continued
to make good progress with our strategy, whilst delivering robust trading and operational performance.
The effective return to the Group's sites for those people who have been working from home will be a key focus during the
second half of the year, requiring consideration of people's safety and wellbeing, across quite different circumstances.
Despite having now operated in a world with Covid-19 since March 2020, the risks posed to the business, whilst better
understood and being mitigated, still remain. However, amended work practices have been well embedded for over a year.
The arrival of vaccines and the availability of rapid testing have been positive developments, but the emergence of new
variants means that it is necessary to remain vigilant and continue to implement mitigations at our offices and sites,
responding to changes in government guidance. An increase in the number of operational colleagues, or those in our supply
chain, required to self-isolate as a result of Track and Trace alerts or testing positive for Covid-19 could heighten business
continuity risk and will continue to be monitored. The impact of Covid-19 on each principal risk and the mitigating actions
adopted in response to the risk have been recorded in the underlying risk registers. The Board continues to have regular
engagement with management on the Group's response to these risks in order to assess, monitor and promptly respond to
any evolving impact of Covid-19 on our operations and business, including impacts for all our stakeholders.
Brexit
The Group's ongoing focus continues to be to ensure that our business mitigates any adverse effects to its operations
following the adoption of the Free Trade Agreement (FTA) throughout the grace period to 31 December 2021. In particular,
the Group developed contingency plans to respond to the revised approach to carbon emissions trading post 1 January
2021 to allow it to effectively meet the Group's regulatory requirements and manage the financial exposure. We are closely
monitoring the ongoing implementation of a UK carbon allowances trading scheme. There have been no further
developments in the first half of 2021 that would suggest a significant change in the range or severity of risks faced by the
business as a result of Brexit. Therefore, it has been agreed that Brexit will now be considered as part of the business-as-
usual risks monitored by the business and not reported on separately.
Acquisition of Pinnacle Renewable Energy Inc.
As part of the Group's strategy to build a long-term future for sustainable biomass, Drax completed the acquisition of
Pinnacle on 13 April 2021. An Integration Management Office (IMO) was established pre-completion to plan activities
required from pre-close through to post-acquisition for each functional area. The IMO set out the guiding principles of
integration, the culture, the approach to ways of working and the roles and responsibilities within the enlarged Group.
An integration governance structure has been implemented including a Steering Committee attended by senior
representatives from each functional area as well as the Group CEO and CFO. There is an established process for key
risks, issues, and actions to be reported to senior management to consider. Where additional resourcing or investment is
considered necessary to respond to any of these areas, there is a process for it to be assessed and appropriately provided.
Regular all-parties calls provide the opportunity for ongoing reporting and to share key updates. Several of the functional
areas have now transitioned from project management provided by the IMO to business-as-usual leads, following successful
completion of integration actions. The Steering Committee continues to monitor the implementation of Drax controls,
processes, and ethics and compliance programmes into the new business.
As communicated in the Shareholder Circular, there are risks associated with the acquisition of Pinnacle which impact the
overall risk profile of the Group. The Group's exposure to environment, health and safety (HSE) risks has expanded due to
the significant increase in the number of operational sites. A review of current Pinnacle operations has been conducted.
Notwithstanding the Covid-19 international travel restrictions, this included visits to all sites, supported by contractors and
those able to travel in the US and Canada. Action plans are being established at site level to address immediate priorities
and a HSE project is in progress, with additional capital investment already approved to be implemented in 2021. As
explained in the Shareholder Circular, the Group's status as UK critical national infrastructure may mean Pinnacle becomes
the subject of new and potentially more sophisticated cyber security threats. These threats, and the controls that regulators
expect us to have in place to mitigate them, are continually developing. Additional measures are being reviewed to
strengthen Pinnacle networks and business resilience around disaster recovery and network infrastructure. Pinnacle
operates in higher gross risk jurisdictions, has higher risk customers and suppliers, and joint venture partnerships where
Pinnacle is responsible for business ethics compliance. Interim due diligence processes for both customers and suppliers
have been implemented, ahead of instigating enduring processes.
Under the governance of the IMO, integration activities are ongoing to embed permanent processes and controls to robustly
mitigate these risks. During the intervening period interim remediations have been established to monitor and report on
these increased risks.

Condensed Consolidated Interim Financial Statements
 
Introduction
The Condensed Consolidated Interim Financial Statements provide information about the financial performance
(Condensed consolidated income statement), financial position (Condensed consolidated balance sheet), and cash flows
(Condensed consolidated cash flow statement) of Drax Group plc (the Company) together with all of the entities controlled
by the Company (collectively, the Group).
The notes to the financial statements provide additional information on certain items in the Condensed consolidated income
statement, Condensed consolidated balance sheet and Condensed consolidated cash flow statement. In general, the
additional information in the notes to the financial statements is required by International Financial Reporting Standards
(IFRS), other regulations or management judgement to facilitate increased understanding of the condensed primary
statements.
 
Basis of preparation
The Condensed Consolidated Interim Financial Statements have been prepared using accounting policies consistent with
IFRS as adopted by the UK and in accordance with IAS 34 'Interim Financial Reporting'. The information provided in respect
of the year ended 31 December 2020 does not constitute statutory accounts as defined in Section 434 of the Companies Act
2006 but is derived from those accounts. A copy of the statutory accounts for that year has been delivered to the Registrar
of Companies. The auditor's report on those accounts was not qualified, did not draw attention to any matters by way of
emphasis and did not contain statements under Section 498(2) or (3) of the Companies Act 2006.
The Condensed Consolidated Interim Financial Statements have been prepared on the going concern basis and on the
historical cost basis, except for certain assets and liabilities that have been measured at fair value (principally derivative
financial instruments) and the assets and liabilities of the Group's defined benefit pension schemes (measured at fair value
and using the projected unit credit method respectively).
The impact of Covid-19 on the application of the going concern basis is discussed in further detail in the Group Financial
Review.
Income statement amounts referred to herein are for continuing operations unless otherwise stated. Results from
discontinued operations are set out in note 10. Reconciliations of Adjusted EBITDA between continuing, discontinued, and
combined amounts for each period are shown in note 6.
The Condensed Consolidated Interim Financial Statements were approved by the Board on 28 July 2021.
 
Adoption of new and revised accounting standards
The accounting policies adopted in the preparation of the Condensed Consolidated Interim Financial Statements are
consistent with those followed in the preparation of the Group's Annual Report and Accounts for the year ended 31
December 2020, except for the adoption of new standards, interpretations and amendments effective as of 1 January 2021.
The adoption of new standards, interpretations and amendments in the current year has not had a material impact. The
Group has not early-adopted any other standard, interpretation or amendment that has been issued but is not yet effective at
30 June 2021.
A full listing of new standards, interpretations and pronouncements under IFRS applicable to these Condensed
Consolidated Interim Financial Statements is presented in note 22.
 
Judgements and estimates
With the exception of the specific matters set out below, the significant judgements and key sources of estimation
uncertainty applicable to the preparation of the Condensed Consolidated Interim Financial Statements are the same as
those described on pages 151-153 of the Group's 2020 Annual Report and Accounts. In each case, judgements have been
applied consistently and estimates made using a consistent methodology, with inputs and assumptions updated to reflect
the Group's latest forecasts and prevailing market conditions at the balance sheet date as appropriate.
In addition, during the six months ended 30 June 2021, the Group made the following significant judgements in the process
of applying the Group's accounting policies in the Condensed Consolidated Interim Financial Statements:
Fair value of acquired assets and liabilities
The Group acquired Pinnacle Renewable Energy Inc. (Pinnacle), a major producer of compressed bioenergy pellets, on 13
April 2021. The assets and liabilities of the acquired business have been recognised at fair value in the Group's Condensed
consolidated balance sheet. The key judgements made in this process are set out below.
The fair value of property, plant and equipment has been calculated based on a depreciated replacement cost (DRC)
method. Estimating the DRC of operational pellet plants is inherently subjective as assumptions need to be made about
input costs, the condition of the assets, and the functional and economic obsolescence of the assets. This process resulted
in a net increase in the value of property, plant and equipment acquired, when compared to their pre-acquisition book
values, of C$40.8 million.
Pinnacle's pre-existing long-term supply contracts with customers have also been recognised at fair value. The fair value of
these contracts has been calculated using a multi-period excess earnings model, taking into account contract margins and
functional charges. The analysis assumes that existing contracts are not renewed at the end of their current term. This
assumption was based on the long duration of these contracts and the developing nature of the market for bioenergy
pellets. Future renewals will depend on factors such as market conditions and the requirement and availability of
appropriate support mechanisms in jurisdictions where the Group's customers operate. The application of these
28/07/2021
announcement2210124.html
file:///C:/Users/fensomb/AppData/Local/Microsoft/Windows/INetCache/IE/ITFHD74A/announcement2210124.html
18/49
assumptions resulted in a fair value for the previously unrecognised acquired contracts of C$62.1 million, which is being
amortised over the weighted average useful life of the contracts of ten years. Had a different assumption been made in
respect of contract renewals, this value could have been materially higher with an equivalent reduction in goodwill.
The fair value of the pre-existing contract between the Group and Pinnacle was assessed as required by IFRS 3. This
assessment concluded that the contractual terms reflected market prices and therefore no adjustment to the purchase
consideration or goodwill was required. Given the illiquid nature of the bioenergy pellet market, with very few spot market
transactions and contracts being negotiated bilaterally with no quoted market price, the approach to assessing the market
price requires judgement. The market price for the purpose of this exercise was assessed based on the existing portfolio
of Drax and Pinnacle contracts.
Acquisition date fair values quoted in these accounts are provisional. In accordance with the measurement period
requirements of IFRS 3, the Group has 12 months from the acquisition date to finalise these values. Whilst material
changes are not expected, if further information about the fair value of the acquired assets and liabilities at the acquisition
date becomes available, this may result in subsequent revisions to the acquisition date fair values recognised and a
corresponding increase or decrease in goodwill. Based on the provisional fair values recognised, goodwill recognised in
these Condensed Consolidated Interim Financial Statements in respect of the Pinnacle acquisition is C$281.3 million.
 
Comparative information
The Group provides comparative financial information in these Condensed Consolidated Interim Financial Statements for
both the six months ended 30 June 2020 and the year ended 31 December 2020. Where included within text, income
statement comparatives refer to the six months ended 30 June 2020 and balance sheet comparatives are as at 31
December 2020, unless otherwise stated. The 30 June 2020 comparatives have been re-presented for the impact of
discontinued operations accounting in relation to the sale of the CCGT portfolio. See note 10 for more information on
discontinued operations.
Alternative Performance Measures (APMs)
Alternative Performance Measures are not defined in IFRS but provide additional information that is used by the Board to
evaluate the Group's financial position and performance. These measures have been defined internally and may therefore
not be comparable to similar APMs presented by other companies. The APMs presented in these Condensed Consolidated
Interim Financial Statements have been updated for the impact of the acquisition of Pinnacle.
APM definitions have been updated to exclude any amounts attributable to non-controlling interests, following the application
of the equity method accounting requirements of IAS 28 and the accounting for non-controlling interests under IFRS 10,
both of which have been applied for the first time in the six months ended 30 June 2021 as a result of the acquisition of
Pinnacle. This change has no impact on amounts disclosed in respect of APMs for previous periods. Reflecting the short
period between the acquisition date and the balance sheet date, amounts attributable to non-controlling interests in the six
months ended 30 June 2021 are immaterial.    
Presentation of the income statement
The Group's financial performance for the period, measured in accordance with IFRS, is shown in the Total Results column
on the face of the Condensed consolidated income statement. Exceptional items and certain remeasurements, including the
tax thereon, are deducted from the Total Results in arriving at the Adjusted Results for the period. The Group's Adjusted
Results are consistent with the way executive management and the Board assess the performance of the Group. Adjusted
Results are intended to reflect the underlying trading performance of the Group's businesses and are presented to assist
users of the financial statements in evaluating the Group's trading performance and performance against strategic
objectives.
Exceptional items are those transactions that, by their nature, do not reflect the trading performance of the Group in the
period. For a transaction to be considered exceptional, management considers the nature of the transaction, the frequency
of similar events, any related precedent and the commercial context. Presentation of a transaction as exceptional is
approved by the Audit Committee in accordance with an agreed policy. During the six months ended 30 June 2021, the
policy has been reviewed and amended guidance on the application of the policy has been approved by the Audit
Committee. The revised guidance has been updated for the definition of materiality and clarification that all matters should
be assessed on a case-by-case basis in line with the principles set out in the exceptional items policy. This updated
application guidance would not have changed exceptional items recognised in either of the comparative periods presented
in these Condensed Consolidated Interim Financial Statements.
None of the financial impacts of Covid-19 on the Group's financial performance in the six months ended 30 June 2021 or
either of the comparative periods presented have been treated as exceptional items and they are included in Adjusted
Results in full.
Certain remeasurements comprise fair value gains and losses on derivative contracts to the extent those contracts do not
qualify for hedge accounting, or hedge accounting is not effective, which under IFRS are recorded in revenue, cost of sales
or foreign exchange gains/(losses). The Group regards all of its forward contracting activity to represent an economic hedge.
The impact of excluding these fair value remeasurements is to reflect commodity sales and purchases at contracted prices
(the price paid or received in respect of delivery of the commodity in question), taking into account the impact of financial
trading (such as forward foreign currency purchases), in the Adjusted Results. The result of this adjustment shows the
impact in revenue, cost of sales and foreign exchange gains/(losses) at the time the transaction takes place.
Further information on exceptional items and certain remeasurements in the current and previous period is included in note
6 to the Condensed Consolidated Interim Financial Statements.
In note 6, the Group presents a reconciliation of Adjusted EBITDA. Adjusted EBITDA is earnings before interest, tax,
depreciation and amortisation, excluding the impact of exceptional items and certain remeasurements. Adjusted EBITDA
only includes the proportion of the results of non-wholly owned subsidiaries that is attributable to the shareholders of the
Group and it excludes the results of any associates.
Adjusted EBITDA is the primary measure used by executive management and the Board to assess the financial
performance of the Group as it provides a more comparable assessment of the Group's year on year trading performance.
Net debt
28/07/2021
announcement2210124.html
file:///C:/Users/fensomb/AppData/Local/Microsoft/Windows/INetCache/IE/ITFHD74A/announcement2210124.html
19/49
The Group defines net debt as total borrowings less cash and cash equivalents. Total borrowings include external financial
debt, such as loan notes, term loans and amounts drawn in cash under revolving credit facilities (see note 12) but excludes
other financial liabilities such as lease liabilities calculated in accordance with IFRS 16, pension obligations and trade and
other payables. Net debt excludes any cash or borrowings attributable to non-controlling interests.
The Group does not include lease liabilities, calculated in accordance with IFRS 16, in the definition of net debt.
This reflects the nature of the contracts included in this balance which, prior to the application of IFRS 16, would
predominantly have not been held on the balance sheet and instead would have been disclosed as operating
commitments. This is consistent with the calculation of net debt as prescribed by the Group's covenant calculations.
Further information on this can be seen in note 14.
 
In addition, the Group also discloses net debt after the impact of relevant currency hedging derivatives. This adjusts the
borrowings figure included in the net debt calculation to take into account the effect of financial instruments entered into to
hedge movements in, for example, foreign exchange rates in relation to debt principal repayments. The Directors believe
that this measure provides useful information about the economic substance of the Group's net debt position.
Net debt to Adjusted EBITDA ratio
This is the ratio of net debt (as defined above) to Adjusted EBITDA from continuing and discontinued operations for the
rolling 12-month period, expressed as a multiple. The Group has a long-term target for Net debt to Adjusted EBITDA of
around 2.0x.
From time to time, the Group discloses a "proforma" ratio, which includes adjustments to reflect the cash flow timing
impact of significant one-off or other events outside of the Group's control that, in the view of the directors, would
otherwise distort performance in the period. Where applicable, such adjustments are described and a rationale for the
adjustment provided.

Notes to the Condensed Consolidated Interim Financial Statements
 
1.   General information
These notes provide additional information about the disclosures within the Condensed Consolidated Interim Financial
Statements. Further information can be found in the Group's 2020 Annual Report and Accounts on pages 159-227.
Drax Group plc (the Company) is incorporated in England and Wales under the Companies Act. The Company and its
subsidiaries (collectively, the Group) principally operate in the electricity and gas markets within the UK. The address of the
Company's registered office and principal establishment is Drax Power Station, Selby, North Yorkshire, YO8 8PH, United
Kingdom.
2.   Segmental reporting
The Group is organised into three businesses, with a dedicated management team for each, and a central corporate
function providing certain specialist and shared services. The Group's businesses, which each represent a reportable
operating segment for the purpose of segmental reporting, are:
Generation: power generation activities in the UK;
Customers: supply of electricity and gas to business customers in the UK; and
Pellet Production: production of sustainable compressed bioenergy pellets at our processing facilities in the US and Canada.
Pellet production includes the financial results of the newly acquired business Pinnacle from the date of acquisition on 13
April 2021. Information reported to the Board for the purposes of assessing performance and making investment decisions
is based on these three segments. The principal measure of profit or loss for each reportable segment presented to the
Board on a regular basis is Adjusted EBITDA (as defined in the basis of preparation).
Operating costs are allocated to segments to the extent they are directly attributable to the activities of that segment.
Corporate office costs are included within central costs.
When defining gross profit within the financial statements, the Group follows the principal trading considerations applied by
its Generation, Customers and Pellet businesses when making a sale. In respect of Generation, this reflects the direct costs
of the commodities to generate the power (such as biomass, gas, coal, and carbon, or balancing power purchased) and the
relevant grid connection costs that arise. In respect of Customers, this reflects the direct costs of supply being the costs of

announcement2210124.html

24/49
the power or gas supplied, together with costs levied on suppliers such as network costs, broker costs and renewables
incentive mechanisms. In respect of the Pellet business, this reflects the direct costs of production, being the fibre, fuel and
drying costs, in addition to direct freight and port costs.
Accordingly cost of sales excludes depreciation, presented separately on the face of the income statement, and staff costs
to the extent included in operating and administrative expenses.
Seasonality of trading
The primary activities of our Group are affected by seasonality. Demand in the UK for electricity and gas is typically higher in
the winter period (October to March) when temperatures are lower, and thus drives higher prices and dispatch. Conversely,
demand is typically lower in the summer months (April to September), when prices are lower.
This trend is experienced by all of our UK-based businesses, as they operate within the UK electricity and gas markets and
is most notable within the Generation business due to its scale and the flexible operation of thermal generation plant when
prices are low in the summer.
The Pellet Production business incurs certain costs that are higher in winter months due to the effects of inclement weather.
Production volumes and margins are typically higher in the summer months. The business is protected from demand
fluctuations as a result of seasonality by regular production and dispatch schedules under its contracts with customers, both
intra-group and externally.
Segment revenues and results
The following is an analysis of the Group's performance by reporting segment for the six months ended 30 June 2021. The
Board monitors the Adjusted Results for the Group by reporting segment as presented in the tables below. The financial
information in these tables is comprised solely of results from continuing operations. The profit after tax from discontinued
operations in the period of £30.7 million (six months ended 30 June 2020: £20.0 million) is attributable entirely to the
Generation segment and is described in further detail in note 10. A reconciliation of Adjusted EBITDA from continuing and
discontinued operations is contained within note 6.

Total cash outflows in relation to capital expenditure during the six months ended 30 June 2021 were £63.3 million (six
months ended 30 June 2020: £58.5 million).
The implementation of a new billing system in the Customers business was stopped during 2019. Approximately £19 million
of costs incurred to date are held on the balance sheet, which the Group believes have value and will be recovered in full.
Major customers
No customers represented 10% or more of the Group's total revenue for the period (six months ended 30 June 2020: £249.5
million from one customer in the Generation segment).

3.   Revenue
Revenue represents amounts receivable from goods or services provided in the normal course of business, net of trade
discounts, VAT and other sales-related taxes, and excluding transactions between Group companies.
During the period the Group acquired Pinnacle, a pellet production business. The external pellet sales made by Pinnacle are
recognised at the point legal title transfers, which is usually at the point the pellets are loaded on the shipping vessel. For
CIF sales where freight is also arranged for the customer, this is considered a separate performance obligation and revenue
from the freight portion is recognised over the period the vessel sails.
During the period, the Group made sales (and related purchases) of ROCs to help optimise our working capital position.
External sales of ROCs below include £140.0 million of such sales (six months ended 30 June 2020: £249.5 million), with a
similar value reflected in cost of sales.
As described in further detail on page 210 of the Group's 2020 Annual Report and Accounts, certain electricity sales in the
Generation segment are typically made under forward-dated contracts with customers. Between inception and maturity
these contracts meet the definition of a derivative financial instrument and are measured at fair value on the Group's
balance sheet (see note 16). Fair value gains and losses on power sales contracts that have not matured are recognised in
the hedge reserve. At maturity, revenue is recognised in the Group's Adjusted Results at the price agreed in the contract,
reflecting the cash received for the delivery of power.

4.   Net interest and other finance charges
Finance costs reflect expenses incurred in managing the debt structure (such as interest payable on bonds) as well as
foreign exchange gains and losses and the unwinding of discount on provisions. These expenses are offset by net interest
income on the Group's defined benefit pension scheme obligation and interest income that the Group generates through use
of short-term cash surpluses.

5.   Taxation
The tax charge/(credit) includes both current and deferred tax. The tax charge/(credit) is based upon the expected tax
rate for the full year which is applied to taxable profits/(losses) for the interim period, together with any charge or credit
in respect of prior years and the tax effect of any exceptional items (see note 6).
Current tax, including UK corporation tax, Canadian and US tax, is calculated as the income taxes payable on taxable
profits, or recoverable in respect of tax losses, for the interim period. Deferred tax is calculated as the income taxes
payable or recoverable in future accounting periods in respect of temporary differences which may be taxable or allowed
as deductible. Temporary differences themselves represent the difference between the carrying amount of an asset or
liability in the financial statements and the relevant tax base thereon.

(1)       30 June 2020 figures have been re-presented for the impact of discontinued operations accounting in relation to the sale of the CCGT portfolio
on 31 January 2021.
 
The expected tax rate for the full year, before the impact of changes in tax rates, is lower than the standard corporation
tax rate applicable in the UK, principally due to the tax benefit arising from UK Patent Box claims and the new super-
deduction introduced in the Finance Bill 2021, which allows for a 130% in-year deduction for tax purposes against the
cost of qualifying capital expenditure on plant and machinery incurred from April 2021.
 
On 24 May 2021, the Finance Bill 2021, which contains legislation to increase the main rate of UK corporation tax from
19% to 25% with effect from 1 April 2023, concluded its third reading in the House of Commons and was thereby
substantially enacted for IFRS purposes on that date. In the interim period, management has therefore remeasured the
deferred tax assets and liabilities at this higher rate of income tax where these are expected to be realised or settled on or
after 1 April 2023. The impact of this rate increase is a net £47.7 million deferred tax charge through the income
statement.
Drax completed the acquisition of Pinnacle on 13 April 2021. The tax charge above includes the tax charge in respect of
the results of the Pinnacle Group for the period under Drax ownership.
 
6.    Certain remeasurements and exceptional items
The Group presents its underlying financial results in the Adjusted Results column of the Condensed consolidated income
statement. In order to provide a clear and consistent view of trading performance, certain remeasurements and exceptional
items are presented in a separate column. The Group believes that this presentation provides useful information about the
financial performance of the business and is consistent with the way executive management and the Board assess the
performance of the business.
The Group has a framework for the determination of transactions as exceptional. Transactions presented as exceptional are
approved by the Audit Committee.
In these Condensed Consolidated Interim Financial Statements, the following transactions have been designated as certain
remeasurements and exceptional items and presented separately in current and previous periods:
·      Acquisition and restructuring costs associated with the acquisition and on-boarding of Pinnacle and costs
associated with the restructuring of the Customers business (2021).
·      Tax rate change (2021).
·      Asset obsolescence charges relating to coal-specific assets written-off following the decision to cease commercial
coal generation in March 2021 (2020).

announcement2210124.html
file:///C:/Users/fensomb/AppData/Local/Microsoft/Windows/INetCache/IE/ITFHD74A/announcement2210124.html
30/49
·      Operating expenditure which was incurred as a direct result of the decision to cease commercial coal generation
(2020).
We anticipate further costs associated with the restructuring of the Customers business will be incurred in the second
half of the year.
Certain remeasurements comprise gains or losses on derivative contracts to the extent that those contracts do not
qualify for hedge accounting, or hedge accounting is not effective, and those gains or losses are either i) unrealised and
relate to the delivery of commodity contracts in future periods, or ii) are realised in relation to the delivery of commodity
contracts in the current period. The effect of excluding certain remeasurements from Adjusted Results is to reflect
commodity sales and purchases at contracted prices - i.e. at the all-in-hedged amount paid or received in respect of the
delivery of the commodity in question, to better present the trading performance of the Group in Adjusted Results.

On 28 July 2021, the Board resolved to pay an interim dividend of 7.5 pence per share (£30 million), representing 40% of
the expected full year dividend in line with our dividend policy. The interim dividend will be paid on 8 October 2021 and the
record date for entitlement to the dividend will be on 27 August 2021.
Distributable profits
The capacity of the Group to make dividend payments is primarily determined by the availability of retained distributable
profits and cash resources.
28/07/2021
announcement2210124.html
file:///C:/Users/fensomb/AppData/Local/Microsoft/Windows/INetCache/IE/ITFHD74A/announcement2210124.html
32/49
The Parent Company has distributable reserves at 30 June 2021 of £229.7 million. Sufficient reserves are available across
the Group as a whole to make future distributions in accordance with the Group's dividend policy for the foreseeable future.
The majority of the Group's distributable reserves are held in holding and operating subsidiaries. Management actively
monitors the level of distributable reserves in each company in the Group, ensuring adequate reserves are available for
upcoming dividend payments and that the Parent Company has access to these reserves.
The immediate cash resources of the Group of £405.7 million are comprised of cash and cash equivalents that are
accessible on demand and the recent history of operating cash generation is set out in note 13. The majority of these cash
resources are held centrally within the Group by Drax Corporate Limited for treasury management purposes and are
available for funding the working capital and other requirements of the Group.
The Group's financing facilities (see note 12) place certain conditions on the amount of dividend payments to be made in
any given year. The Group expects to be able to make dividend payments, in line with its policy, within these conditions, for
the foreseeable future.
 
8.   Earnings per share
Earnings per share (EPS) represents the amount of earnings (post-tax profits) attributable to each ordinary share or dilutive
potential ordinary share that the Group has in issue. Basic EPS is calculated by dividing the Group's earnings attributable to
the owners of the Parent Company (profit after tax in accordance with IFRS) by the weighted average number of ordinary
shares in issue during the period. Diluted EPS demonstrates the impact upon the basic earnings per share if all outstanding
share options, that are expected to vest on their future maturity dates, were exercised and treated as ordinary shares as at
the balance sheet date.
Shares purchased under the Group's share buy-back programme are not included in the weighted average calculation of
shares. For the purpose of calculating diluted earnings per share, the weighted average calculation of shares excludes any
share options that would have an anti-dilutive impact.
Deferred tax balances have been remeasured in the period due to the planned increase in the main UK corporation tax rate
to 25% from April 2023. This change was substantively enacted on 24 May 2021. Total Results for the six months ended 30
June 2021 includes a charge of £47.7 million as a result of the effect of changes in tax rate (see note 5).

Disposal of Drax Generation Enterprise Limited
On 31 January 2021, the Group completed the sale of its CCGT generation portfolio to VPI Generation Limited for cash
consideration of up to £193 million, subject to customary adjustments. This included £29 million of contingent consideration
associated with the option to develop the site at Damhead Creek. The sale price represents a return over the Group's period
of ownership significantly ahead of the Group's weighted average cost of capital.
The Group received initial consideration of £188 million in February 2021, which included £24 million in respect of customary
working capital adjustments. A completion accounts process concluded in July 2021, subsequent to the balance sheet date,
that finalised working capital adjustments at £22 million, amending the initial consideration to £186 million.

Acquisition of Pinnacle Renewable Energy Inc.
The acquisition of Pinnacle Renewable Energy Inc. (Pinnacle) was approved by shareholders on 31 March 2021 and
subsequently completed on 13 April 2021.
The Group signed an agreement with Pinnacle providing for the acquisition by Drax Canadian Holdings Inc., a wholly-
owned subsidiary of the Group, of the entire issued share capital of Pinnacle (the "Acquisition"). The Acquisition was

implemented by way of a statutory plan of arrangement in accordance with the laws of the Province of British Columbia,
Canada, at a price of C$11.30 per share (representing a premium of 13% based on the closing market price as at 5
February of C$10.04 per share and valuing the fully diluted equity of Pinnacle at C$385 million (£222 million), with an
implied enterprise value of C$796 million.
The acquisition was financed from the Group's existing cash reserves which included the amounts drawn down in
February under the infrastructure term loan facilities agreed in 2020 (see note 12). The primary reason for the acquisition
was to advance the Group's biomass strategy by more than doubling its biomass production capacity, significantly
reducing its cost of biomass production and adding a major biomass supply business underpinned with high-quality Asian
and European counterparties.
Goodwill on acquisition predominately relates to the value of uncontracted revenues.
Transaction costs in relation to the acquisition were £7.7 million and the Group has incurred integration costs of £2.0
million to date.
 
The provisional fair values of the identifiable assets acquired, and the liabilities assumed, as at 13 April 2021 were as
follows:

Reflecting the short time period since the acquisition date, the acquisition date fair values shown above remain
provisional and subject to finalisation. The Group has not yet allocated the provisional goodwill to individual cash
generating units, however expects to complete this exercise by the end of 2021. The provision goodwill balance is
denominated in Canadian dollars (C$281.3 million) and is therefore retranslated into the sterling presentational currency
of the Group at the closing rate at the balance sheet date. Any change in the carrying amount of goodwill due to
movements in exchange rates are recognised in other comprehensive income.

During 2020, the Group agreed a new infrastructure term loan facilities agreement, £53.0 million and €31.5 million of which
were drawn at 31 December 2020. On 18 February 2021, the Group drew down the remaining committed amounts of £45.0
million and €95.0 million under this agreement.
The US$500.0 million US denominated senior secured notes have a fixed interest rate of 6.625% equating to an effective
sterling interest rate of 4.9%. Cross-currency interest rate swaps have been used to fix the sterling value of interest
payments over a five-year period. This instrument also fixed the sterling repayment of the principal in 2023.
The €250.0 million euro denominated senior secured notes have a 2025 maturity date. The notes were issued in 2020 at
100% of their nominal value and have a fixed interest rate of 2.625% which the Group has swapped back to achieve an
effective sterling equivalent rate of 3.240%.
The £375.0 million LIBOR-linked UK infrastructure private placement agreed in 2019 has maturities extending out to
between 2024 and 2029. The Group has entered into interest rate swaps to fix the effective interest rates inside the Group's
current cost of debt.
The 2020 infrastructure term loan facilities agreement provides committed facilities with a range of maturities between 2024
and 2030, further extending the Group's debt maturity profile. The initial agreement included sterling denominated
commitments of £45.0 million and euro denominated commitments totalling €126.5 million. The agreement also included an
option for the Group to increase the facilities by up to a further £75.0 million of commitments, if agreed between the Group
and its lenders. To date, a further £53.0 million with a 2028 maturity was agreed under this option.
The Group's committed £300.0 million Revolving Credit Facility (RCF) had no cash drawings as at 30 June 2021 or 31
December 2020. The Group has no other committed facilities, although it has access to certain non-recourse trade
receivable finance facilities and payment facilities, as described in note 13, which are utilised to accelerate working capital
cash inflows and defer cash outflows.
Pinnacle senior debt facilities relate to borrowings acquired from Pinnacle. As at 30 June 2021, this included three debt
facilities, being a revolver loan (C$20.0 million), term loan (C$266.0 million) and delayed draw (C$147.4 million). Current
borrowings shown above are made up of the revolver loan and a portion of the term loan and delayed draw which were due
for payment within one year of the balance sheet date.
The Group has complied with the financial covenants of its borrowings facilities during the current year and prior year.
The weighted average interest rate payable at the balance sheet date on the Group's borrowings was 3.96% (as at 31
December 2020: 3.70%). This includes the impact of the Pinnacle acquisition with the borrowings acquired having a cost of
debt of over 5.5%.
On 13 July 2021, the Group completed the refinancing of the three Canadian dollar facilities held by Pinnacle. The new
facilities include a C$300.0 million term loan and C$10 million RCF. This replaced Pinnacle facilities and further reduces the
Group's all-in cost of debt to approximately 3.5%. The existing C$435 million drawn facilities were replaced with new
facilities of approximately $305 million, with the balance on the facilities been repaid form the Group's existing cash
reserves.

(1)    Certain remeasurements of derivative contracts includes the effect of non-cash unrealised gains and losses recognised in the income statement
and cash realised from derivative contracts designated into hedge relationships under IFRS 9, where the gain or loss is held in the hedge reserve
pending release to the income statement in the period the hedged transaction occurs.
The Group has a strong focus on cash flow discipline and management of liquidity. The impact of working capital measures
in the first half of the year has been at a broadly consistent level as throughout 2020 unless otherwise stated. The impact of
these actions on the cash flows of the Group is described below.
Cash from ROCs is typically realised several months after the ROC is earned; however, through standard ROC sales and
ROC purchase arrangements the Group is able to accelerate cash flows over a proportion of these assets. The net
impact of ROC purchases and ROC sales on operating cash flows for the six months ended 30 June 2021 was a £34.1
million outflow (six months ended 30 June 2020: £82.4 million outflow). This is reflected as an increase (six months
ended 30 June 2020: increase) in ROC assets and is a component of the overall net increase (six months ended 30 June
2020: increase) in ROC assets shown in the table above. The Group also has access to facilities enabling it to sell ROC
trade receivables on a non-recourse basis. Utilisation of these facilities generated a net cash inflow in the six months
ended 30 June 2021 of £48.3 million (six months ended 30 June 2020: £47.1 million inflow).
 
Utilisation of both of these methods to accelerate cash flows is higher around the middle of ROC compliance periods
(April to March annually) as the Group has generated a large amount of ROCs but energy suppliers do not yet require
ROCs to settle their obligation. At the start of the compliance period the Group has not generated large amounts of
ROCs, and towards the end of the compliance period energy suppliers are purchasing ROCs to settle their obligation.
The utilisation of these methods is therefore lower at the year-end compared to 30 June as the Group has fewer ROCs
available at year-end.
From time to time, when market conditions change, the Group can rebase foreign currency contracts (including cross-
currency interest rate swaps). In the six months to 30 June 2021 the unwind of prior rebasing exercises generated a working
capital outflow. The total cash benefit released from related trades that remained outstanding at 30 June 2021 was £53.6
million (as at 31 December 2020: £80.1 million). This cash benefit is made up of £nil (as at 31 December 2020: £24.4
million) released from foreign currency contracts and £53.6 million (as at 31 December 2020: £55.7 million) from cross-
currency interest rate swaps. This is reflected as an adjustment to certain remeasurements of derivative contracts in the
table above.
The Customers business has access to a facility which enables it to accelerate cash flows associated with trade receivables
on a non-recourse basis. This facility generated a net cash inflow of £14.7 million in the six months ended 30 June 2021 (six
months ended 30 June 2020: net cash outflow of £6.0 million), reflected as a decrease in receivables in the table above (six
months ended 30 June 2020: increase). The facility limit is £200 million. Utilisation of the facility was £184.7 million at 30
June 2021 (as at 31 December 2020: £170.0 million).
The Group has sought to normalise payments across its supplier base, resulting in certain suppliers extending payment
terms and some reducing terms. Suppliers are able to access a supply chain finance facility provided by a bank, for which
funds can be accelerated in advance of the normal payment terms. The facility does not affect the Group's working capital,
as payment terms remain unaltered with the Group. At 30 June 2021, the Group had trade payables of £64.7 million (as at
31 December 2020: £43.7 million) related to supply chain finance. The increase in the year is predominately as a result of
the acquisition of Pinnacle. The cashflows from this facility are presented in the movement in payables in the table above.
The Group also has access to a number of payment facilities to leverage scale and efficiencies in transaction processing,
whilst providing a working capital benefit for the Group due to a short extension of payment terms within a normal working
capital cycle. The amount outstanding under these facilities at 30 June 2021 was £66.1 million (as at 31 December 2020:
£63.6 million). The one-time impact associated with the vertical integration of Pinnacle in relation to these facilities was a
working capital outflow of £25 million.

14.  Reconciliation of net debt
Net debt is calculated by taking the Group's borrowings (note 12) and subtracting cash and cash equivalents. Net debt
attributable to the Group excludes the share of cash and cash equivalents attributable to non-controlling interest.

Borrowings include listed bonds, bank debt and revolving credit facilities, net of any deferred finance costs but do not include
other financial liabilities such as IFRS 16 lease liabilities, pension obligations and trade and other payables.
The Group does not include lease liabilities, calculated in accordance with IFRS 16, in the definition of net debt. This reflects
the nature of the contracts included in this balance which, prior to the application of IFRS 16, would predominantly have not
been held on the balance sheet and instead would have been disclosed as operating commitments. This is consistent with
the calculation of net debt as prescribed by the Group's covenant calculations.
 
Lease liabilities at 30 June 2021 were £123.8 million (as at 31 December 2020: £30.2 million). The significant increase in
lease liabilities in the period is predominantly due to the vessel leases within the acquired Pinnacle business.
The Group has entered into cross-currency interest rate swaps, fixing the sterling value of the principal repayments in
respect of the Group's US dollar (USD) and euro denominated debt (see note 12). If USD and euro balances are translated
at the hedged rate, rather than the rate prevailing at the balance sheet date, the carrying amount of the Group's borrowings
would be impacted. The table below reconciles net debt excluding the impact of hedging instruments, as disclosed in the
table above, to net debt including the impact of hedging instruments through translating the borrowings at the hedged rates.

15. Financial risk management
The Group's activities expose it to a variety of financial risks, including commodity price risk, interest rate risk, liquidity risk,
inflation risk, counterparty risk and credit risk. The Group's overall risk management programme focuses on the
unpredictability of commodity and financial markets and seeks to manage potential adverse effects on the Group's financial
performance.
The Group uses derivative financial instruments to hedge certain risk exposures. Risk management is overseen by risk
management committees which identify, evaluate and hedge financial risks in close coordination with the Group's trading
and treasury functions under policies approved by the Board of directors.
As the Covid-19 pandemic has progressed there have been significant impacts to financial markets, albeit the full longer-
term macro-economic effects remain uncertain. The associated principal risks to the Group are volatility in financial markets,
including the impact of weaker sterling affecting the cost of biomass, the liquidity risk associated with potential increases in
borrowing costs and the availability of debt financing.

39/49
The Group has financial risk management policies in place to mitigate and reduce exposure to these risks. These policies
are reviewed at least annually by the Group's Risk Management Committees.
The Group's well-established foreign exchange hedging programme manages the risk associated with its foreign currency
exposure over a rolling five-year period with protection against sterling weakness in place out to 2026.
The Group maintains a mixture of cash and cash equivalents and committed facilities to ensure sufficient funding for
business requirements. At 30 June 2021 the Group had cash and cash equivalents of £405.7 million which, alongside the
committed but undrawn facilities, provides significant headroom over and above the short-term liquidity requirements. After
taking into account the effect of hedging, the majority of the Group's borrowings are at fixed interest rates, reducing the risk
to the Group of increases in interest rates.
Credit risk associated with derivatives and investing activities are diversified across a range of highly rated counterparties
reducing counterparty exposures, in line with the Group's policy.
In addition to the financial market impact, the Group's Customers business is exposed to higher credit risk. The impact of
Covid-19 has increased the risk of potential customer failures and expected credit losses, principally within the SME market.
The financial impact of Covid-19 has reduced compared to the impact borne in 2020, however, the impact of the prolonged
Government lockdowns continues to pose the risk of customer failures in 2021 and beyond. The Group extended its trade
credit insurance programme in 2019 and continues to use this facility, providing mitigation to the risk of potential customer
failure.
Commodity price risk
The Group is exposed to the effect of fluctuations in commodity prices, particularly the price of electricity, gas, sustainable
wood fibre and pellets, other fuels, and carbon emissions allowances. Price variations and market cycles have historically
influenced the financial results of the Group and are expected to continue to do so.
The Group has a policy of securing forward power sales, purchases of fuel and carbon emissions allowances when
profitable to do so and in line with specified limits under approved policies. Forward power sales can be secured up to 100%
of forecast availability two years ahead of delivery. All commitments to sell power under fixed-price contracts are designated
as cash flow hedges as they reduce the Group's cash flow exposure resulting from fluctuations in the price of power.
The Group purchases sustainable biomass under fixed priced contracts with different maturities, principally from a number of
international sources. The Group considers all such contracts to be economic hedges. The contracts are outside of the
scope of IFRS 9.
Where forward power curves are less liquid, the Group uses financially settled gas sales as a proxy for power to mitigate the
risk of power price fluctuations. The Group also purchases gas under fixed-price contracts to meet the demand of its energy
supply customers and, up until their disposal on 31 January 2021, as a fuel for the CCGT assets.
The Group purchases UK Carbon emissions allowances under fixed-price contracts with different maturity dates from a
range of sources. All commitments to purchase UK carbon emissions allowances under fixed-price contracts are designated
as cash flow hedges as they reduce the Group's cash flow exposure resulting from fluctuations in the price of UK carbon
emissions allowances.
Foreign currency risk
The Group is exposed to fluctuations in foreign currency rates as a result of committed and forecast transactions in foreign
currencies, principally in relation to purchases of fuel for use in the Generation business and principal and interest payments
relating to foreign currency denominated debt. These fuel purchases are typically denominated in US dollars (USD),
Canadian dollars (CAD) or euros (EUR), and the foreign currency debt is denominated in USD, CAD and EUR.
The Group also has exposure to translation risk in relation to its net investment in its US and Canadian subsidiaries.
It is the Group's policy to hedge material transactional exposures using a variety of derivatives to protect the sterling value of
foreign currency cash flows, except where there is an economic hedge inherent in the transaction. The Group enters into
derivative contracts in line with the currency risk management policy, including forwards and options, to manage the risks
associated with its anticipated foreign currency requirements over a rolling five-year period covering contracted exposures
and a proportion of highly probable forecast transactions.
Additionally, in order to improve the cost of funding, the Group has issued foreign currency denominated debt in USD and
EUR. The Group utilises derivative contracts, including cross-currency interest rate swaps, to manage exchange rate risk on
foreign currency debt.
Interest rate risk
The Group has exposure to interest rate risk, principally in relation to variable rate debt, cash and cash equivalents and the
RCF, should it be drawn. The Group has taken out a LIBOR floating-to-fixed interest rate swap to fix the interest payments
on the £375 million private placement issued in 2019. On the 2020 infrastructure term loan facilities, the Group has fixed the
interest rate payable on the £98 million of GBP denominated facilities through floating-to-fixed LIBOR interest rate swaps.
The Group has also fixed the interest rate payable on the variable rate euro denominated debt through floating-to-fixed
cross-currency interest rate swaps.
The Group acquired C$441 million of debt linked to the Canadian Dollar Offered Rate (CDOR) when it acquired Pinnacle.
Pinnacle fixed a proportion of the interest payable on this debt through a C$100 million notional CDOR floating-to-fixed
interest rate swap.
At 30 June 2021, the Group has fixed the majority of its drawn debt instruments through the use of swaps and therefore has
reduced its exposure to interest rate risk from its variable rate debt once the impact of the swaps is considered.
The return generated on the Group's cash balance, or on amounts drawn on the RCF are also exposed to movements in
short-term interest rates. The Group manages cash balances to protect against adverse changes in rates whilst retaining
liquidity.
Interest rate benchmark reform
In response to interest rate benchmark reform, the Group has commenced a programme to identify any InterBank Offered
Rate (IBOR) exposures within the business and that are impacted by this reform. The programme will prepare and deliver
28/07/2021
announcement2210124.html
file:///C:/Users/fensomb/AppData/Local/Microsoft/Windows/INetCache/IE/ITFHD74A/announcement2210124.html
40/49
on an action plan to enable a smooth transition to alternative benchmark rates. This will involve considering appropriate
alternative benchmark rates in line with those proposed by different working groups in the industry and engaging with
counterparties to implement appropriate wording in relevant contracts. This programme is expected to conclude in the
second half of 2021.
The only interest rate benchmarks that the Group is exposed to within its hedge accounting relationships and which are
subject to interest rate benchmark reform are LIBOR and EURIBOR. The LIBOR exposures in hedge accounting
relationships are the hedge of the £375 million private placement (2019), and £98 million of the 2020 infrastructure term loan
facilities that are hedged using a floating-to-fixed LIBOR swap. The EURIBOR exposures in hedge accounting relationships
are the hedge of the €95 million of the new infrastructure term loan facilities that are hedged using floating-to-fixed
EURIBOR cross-currency interest rate swaps.
The Group is closely monitoring the market and the output from the various industry working groups managing the transition
to new benchmark interest rates. This includes announcements made by LIBOR regulators (including the Financial Conduct
Authority (FCA)) regarding the transition away from LIBOR to Sterling Overnight Index Average Rate (SONIA). The FCA has
made clear that, at the end of 2021, it will no longer seek to persuade, or compel, banks to submit to LIBOR.
Liquidity risk
The treasury function is responsible for liquidity, funding and settlement management under policies approved by the Board.
Liquidity needs are monitored using regular forecasting of operational cash flows and financing commitments. The Group
maintains a mixture of cash and cash equivalents and committed and uncommitted facilities in order to ensure sufficient
funding for business requirements.
In managing liquidity risk, the Group has the ability to accelerate the cash flows associated with certain working capital
items, principally those related to ROC sales and Customers' energy supply sales. In each case, this is undertaken on a
non-recourse basis and accordingly, the ROCs and other items are derecognised from the balance sheet at the point of
sale. The Group also utilises standard purchasing facilities to extend the working capital cycle, whilst still paying suppliers on
time.
Counterparty risk
As the Group relies on third-party suppliers and counterparties for the delivery of currency, sustainable biomass and other
goods and services, it is exposed to the risk of non-performance by these third-party suppliers. If a large supplier were to fall
into financial difficulty and/or fail to deliver against its contract with the Group, there would be additional costs associated
with securing the lost goods or services from other suppliers.
The Group enters into contracts for the sale of electricity to a number of counterparties. The failure of one or more of these
counterparties to perform their contractual obligations may cause the Group financial distress or increase the risk profile of
the Group.
Credit risk
The Group's exposure to credit risk is predominantly limited to the carrying amount of financial assets recognised at the
balance sheet date.
The Group's three operating segments are all exposed to different levels and concentrations of credit risk, largely reflecting
the number, size and nature of their respective customers. Up to 30 June 2021, the majority of Pellet Production segment
sales were intra-group. The proportion of external sales will increase in future periods due to the acquisition of Pinnacle. Of
these external sales, a significant majority are contracted to large utility customers where the concentration of credit risk is
low.
The highest risk is in the Customers segment, with a high number of customers of varying sizes operating in a variety of
markets. In particular, its SME customers carry lower concentrations but higher levels of credit risk, owing to a customer
base comprised largely of smaller retail and commercial entities.
In the Customers segment, credit risk is managed by checking a company's creditworthiness and financial strength both
before commencing trade and during the business relationship. Credit risk is monitored and managed by business sector.
For the Generation segment, the risk arises from treasury, trading and energy procurement activities, as well as the sale of
by-products from generation activities. Wholesale counterparty credit exposures are monitored by individual counterparty
and by category of credit rating. Counterparty credit exposures are subject to approved limits. The Group uses master
netting agreements to reduce credit risk and net settles payments with counterparties where net settlement provisions exist.
In addition, the Group employs a variety of other methods to mitigate credit risk: margining, various forms of parent company
guarantee, deed of charge, cash collateral, letters of credit and surety bonds. The majority of the Generation business's
credit risk is with counterparties in related energy industries or with financial institutions. In addition, where deemed
appropriate, the Group has historically purchased credit default swaps.
For the Pellet Production segment, credit risk predominantly relates to the fact sales tend to be under large, long-term
contracts in an illiquid market. The Group manages this risk through detailed assessment of credit risk prior to entering new
contracts and subsequent monitoring of credit risk throughout the term of the contracts.
The investment of surplus cash is undertaken with the objective of ensuring that there is sufficient liquidity at all times, so
that funds are available to meet liabilities as they fall due, whilst securing a return from invested funds and preserving the
capital value of those funds within Board-approved policies. These policies manage credit risk exposure by setting out
minimum rating requirements, maximum investment with any one counterparty based on their rating, and the maturity
profile.
Inflation risk
The Group is exposed to inflation risk on elements of its revenues and cost base. The Group's ROC revenues are linked to
UK RPI and its Contract for Difference revenue (CfD) is linked to UK CPI. In addition, a proportion of the Group's fuel costs
are linked to US/Canadian CPI. The Group uses financial derivative contracts including swaps and swaptions to hedge the
future cashflows relating to a proportion of its exposure. The Group has fixed the cashflows on a proportion of these swaps.
The Group also benefits from a natural hedge arising from its inflation-linked borrowings (see note 12).
Capital management
The Group manages its capital to ensure it is able to continue as a going concern; maintain a strong credit rating
underpinned by robust financial metrics; invest in its core business and pay a sustainable and growing dividend while
28/07/2021

41/49
maximising the return to shareholders through the maintenance of the debt and equity balances. The capital structure of the
Group consists of shareholders' equity (excluding the hedge and cost of hedging reserves), plus net debt. Net debt is
comprised of borrowings and cash and cash equivalents as disclosed in note 14.
The Group regularly explores options to enhance its debt capital structure. As part of this, in order to reduce interest costs,
extend maturities and diversify finance sources, the Group will continue to monitor the availability of various financing
options. Opportunities are evaluated in light of prevailing market conditions, taking into account current liquidity, available
terms, execution risks and prospects for future access to capital.
16.  Derivative financial instruments
As described above, the Group makes extensive use of derivative financial instruments for the purpose of managing its
exposure to the risks set out in note 15.
Where possible, the Group has taken advantage of the own-use exemption which allows qualifying contracts to be excluded
from fair value marked-to-market accounting. This applies to certain contracts for non-financial commodities entered into and
held for the Group's own purchase, sale or usage requirements.
Contracts for the physical delivery of non-financial assets which do not qualify for the own-use exemption, principally power,
gas and carbon emissions allowances, are accounted for as derivatives in accordance with IFRS 9 and are recorded in the
balance sheet at fair value.
Changes in the fair value of derivative financial instruments are reflected through the hedge reserve (note 18) to the extent
that the contracts are designated as effective hedges in accordance with IFRS 9, or the income statement where the hedge
accounting requirements are not met. To ensure these derivatives are reflected at their contracted price in the period they
relate to, these changes in fair value are not reflected within Adjusted Results in the income statement.
 
For financial reporting purposes, the Group has classified derivative financial instruments into five categories:
-     Commodity contracts - forward contracts for the sale or purchase of a physical commodity which is expected to be
settled through physical delivery of the commodity.
-     Financial contracts - freight and weather-related contracts, as well as contracts for commodities that are not
expected to be settled through physical delivery of the commodity.
-     Forward currency exchange contracts - currency related contracts including forwards, vanilla options and structured
option products.
-     Interest rate and cross-currency contracts - contracts which swap one interest rate for another in a single currency,
including floating-to-fixed interest rate swaps, contracts which swap interest and principal cash flows in one currency
for another currency, including fixed-to-fixed and floating-to-fixed cross-currency interest rate swaps, and swaptions.
-     Inflation rate swaps - swap contracts, such as floating-to-fixed, which are linked to an inflation index such as RPI or
CPI, and inflation swaptions.

Report and Accounts. This has had no impact on the total assets or total liabilities.
The change in fair value of the derivative portfolio in the period has been driven predominantly by changes in commodity
prices. The Group has a large portfolio of forward power sales and carbon and gas purchases which are impacted by
changes in commodity prices. The Group also has a large portfolio of forward currency contracts which fix the sterling cost

42/49
of our future fuel purchases denominated in foreign currencies. Given the size of the portfolio, the fair value is highly
sensitive to small changes in foreign currency exchange rates.
Fair value measurement
-         Commodity contracts fair value - The fair value of open commodity contracts that do not qualify for the own-use
exemption is calculated by reference to forward market prices at the balance sheet date.
-         Financial contracts fair value - The fair value of financial contracts that do not qualify for the own-use exemption,
is calculated by reference to forward market prices at the balance sheet date.
-         Forward foreign currency exchange contracts fair value - The fair value of forward foreign currency exchange
contracts is determined using forward currency exchange market rates at the balance sheet date.
-         Interest rate and cross-currency contracts - The fair value of interest rate swaps is calculated by reference to
forward market curves at the balance sheet date for the relevant interest index. The fair value of cross-currency
interest rate swaps is calculated using the relevant forward currency exchange market rates for fixed-to-fixed swaps
and by using the relevant forward currency exchange market rates and interest index for floating-to-fixed swaps.
-         Inflation rate swaps - The fair value of inflation rate swaps is calculated by reference to forward market curves at
the balance sheet date for the relevant inflation index.
The fair values of all derivative financial instruments are discounted to reflect the credit risk inherent within the instrument.
IFRS 13 requires categorisation of the Group's financial instruments in accordance with the following hierarchy in order to
explain the basis on which their fair values have been determined:
·      Level 1 - Fair value measurements are those derived from quoted prices (unadjusted) in active markets for identical
assets or liabilities;
·      Level 2 - Fair value measurements are those derived from inputs, other than quoted prices included within Level 1,
that are observable for the asset or liability, either directly (i.e. as prices) or indirectly (i.e. derived from prices); and
·      Level 3 - Fair value measurements are those derived from valuation techniques that include inputs for the asset or
liability that are not based on observable market data (unobservable inputs).
Categorisation within this fair value measurement hierarchy has been determined on the basis of the lowest level input that
is significant to the fair value measurement of the relevant asset or liability.
The fair values of commodity contracts, financial contracts, forward foreign currency exchange contracts, interest rate and
cross-currency contracts, and most inflation rate swaps are largely determined by comparison of observable forward market
prices with the contract price; therefore, these contracts are categorised at Level 2 of the fair value hierarchy under IFRS 13.
The Group holds certain derivative contracts with unobservable, and therefore Level 3, inputs (principally the CPI
component of inflation swaps). However, in each case, these inputs are not material to the overall valuation and therefore
the instruments as a whole are determined to be Level 2 in the fair value hierarchy.
17.  Other financial instruments
The Group holds a variety of other non-derivative financial instruments, including cash and cash equivalents, borrowings,
payables and receivables arising from our operations.
Fair value
Cash and cash equivalents, short-term investments, trade and other receivables and trade and other payables generally
have short terms to maturity. For this reason, their carrying values, on the historical cost basis, approximate to their fair
value. The Group's borrowings relate principally to the publicly traded high-yield loan notes and amounts drawn down
against term loans.
Certain financial assets and financial liabilities have been measured at amortised cost. The terms of the instruments have
been reviewed for the existence of embedded derivatives. The 2025 EUR fixed rate loan notes and the 2025 USD fixed rate
loan notes both contain an early repayment option that meets the definition of an embedded derivative. However, in both
cases, these have not been separated as they are deemed to be closely related to the host contract.
At 30 June 2021, the fair value of the Group's issued loan notes was £28.3 million in excess (as at 31 December 2020:
£32.0 million in excess) of their carrying value of £570.7 million (as at 31 December 2020: £582.5 million) based on quoted
market prices.
18.  Hedge reserve
Changes in the fair value of commodity contracts, financial contracts and financing derivatives, to the extent that they qualify
as effective cash flow hedges under accounting rules, are recognised in the hedge reserve, a component of shareholders'
equity. The cumulative gains and losses unwind and are released to the income statement to match the effect of the hedged
cash flows.
The expected release profile of post-tax hedging (losses)/gains to the income statement is as follows:

The following matters reflect potential future flows of cash, arising from existing events, that are dependent on a future event
that is outside the control of the Group. The amount and timing of any payment is uncertain and cannot be measured
reliably and, as a result, no amounts in respect of these matters are provided for in the Group's financial statements.
Guarantees
In addition to the amount drawn down against the bank loans, certain members of the Group guarantee the obligations of a
number of banks in respect of letters of credit issued by those banks to counterparties of the Group. As at 30 June 2021, the
Group's contingent liability in respect of letters of credit issued under the revolving credit facility amounted to £54.9 million
(as at 31 December 2020: £67.9 million). Cash flows as a result of these guarantees is considered remote.
The Group also guarantees obligations in the form of surety bonds with a number of insurers. As at 30 June 2021 the
Group's contingent liability in relation to these guarantees was £92.0 million (as at 31 December 2020: £86.7 million).
The Group had a secured commodity trading line, which allowed it to transact prescribed volumes of commodity trades
without the requirement to post collateral and FX trading lines with certain banks. During 2020 the Group opted to close
the secured commodity trading line and as such no further trades are able to utilise the line. The final trades utilising this
line matured in March 2021.
 
22.  Adoption of new and amended accounting standards

24.  Post balance sheet events
On 13 July 2021 the Group acquired a further 20% interest in APLLC from The Westervelt Company for cash
consideration of US $29.7 million. APLLC is a joint venture which owns the Demopolis and Aliceville pellet plants. Prior to
this acquisition the Group already owned 70% of APLLC, so as a result of this transaction the Group now owns 90% of
APLLC.
On 13 July 2021 the Group completed the refinancing of the Canadian dollar facilities it acquired as part of the Group's
acquisition of Pinnacle. in April 2021. This refinance has resulted in a new C$300.0 million facility that matures in 2024,
with an option to extend by two years, subject to lender consent. The new facility has a variable interest rate based on
Canadian Dollar Offered Rate plus a margin. The new facility also has an Environmental, social and governance (ESG)
component which adjusts the margin payable based on Drax's carbon intensity measured against an annual benchmark.
This facility, along with existing cash reserves in the Group, replaces the approximately C$435.0 million of facilities
acquired as part of the Group's acquisition of Pinnacle.
 
 
INDEPENDENT REVIEW REPORT TO DRAX GROUP PLC
 
We have been engaged by the company to review the condensed set of financial statements in the half-yearly financial
report for the six months ended 30 June 2021 which comprises the Condensed consolidated income statement,
Condensed consolidated statement of comprehensive income, the Condensed consolidated balance sheet, the
Condensed consolidated statement of changes in equity, the Condensed consolidated cash flow statement and related
notes 1 to 24. We have read the other information contained in the half-yearly financial report and considered whether it
contains any apparent misstatements or material inconsistencies with the information in the condensed set of financial
statements.
 
Directors' responsibilities
The half-yearly financial report is the responsibility of, and has been approved by, the directors. The directors are
responsible for preparing the half-yearly financial report in accordance with the Disclosure Guidance and Transparency
Rules of the United Kingdom's Financial Conduct Authority.
As disclosed in the basis of preparation above, the annual financial statements of the group will be prepared in
accordance with United Kingdom adopted International Financial Reporting Standards. The condensed set of financial
statements included in this half-yearly financial report has been prepared in accordance with United Kingdom adopted
International Accounting Standard 34, "Interim Financial Reporting".
 
Our responsibility
Our responsibility is to express to the Company a conclusion on the condensed set of financial statements in the half-
yearly financial report based on our review.

Scope of review
We conducted our review in accordance with International Standard on Review Engagements (UK and Ireland) 2410
"Review of Interim Financial Information Performed by the Independent Auditor of the Entity" issued by the Financial
Reporting Council for use in the United Kingdom. A review of interim financial information consists of making inquiries,
primarily of persons responsible for financial and accounting matters, and applying analytical and other review
procedures. A review is substantially less in scope than an audit conducted in accordance with International Standards on
Auditing (UK) and consequently does not enable us to obtain assurance that we would become aware of all significant
matters that might be identified in an audit. Accordingly, we do not express an audit opinion.
 
Conclusion
Based on our review, nothing has come to our attention that causes us to believe that the condensed set of financial
statements in the half-yearly financial report for the six months ended 30 June 2021 is not prepared, in all material
respects, in accordance with United Kingdom adopted International Accounting Standard 34 and the Disclosure Guidance
and Transparency Rules of the United Kingdom's Financial Conduct Authority.
 
Use of our report
This report is made solely to the company in accordance with International Standard on Review Engagements (UK and
Ireland) 2410 "Review of Interim Financial Information Performed by the Independent Auditor of the Entity" issued by the
Financial Reporting Council. Our work has been undertaken so that we might state to the company those matters we are
required to state to it in an independent review report and for no other purpose. To the fullest extent permitted by law, we
do not accept or assume responsibility to anyone other than the company, for our review work, for this report, or for the
conclusions we have formed.

Contracts for difference (CfD)
A mechanism to support investment in low-carbon electricity generation. The CfD works by stabilising revenues for
generators at a fixed price level known as the 'strike price'. Generators will receive revenue from selling their electricity
into the market as usual. However, when the market reference price is below the strike price, they will also receive a top-
up payment from suppliers for the additional amount. Conversely, if the reference price is above the strike price, the
generator must pay back the difference.
Enterprise value
Enterprise value is a measure of a company's total value. It is calculated by summing the market capitalisation of the
company, equal to the current stock price multiplied by the number of outstanding stock shares, plus total debt, both short
term and long term. Any cash and cash equivalents is then deducted from this to give the final enterprise value.
