Drax – September 2020 
Executive Summary 
In accordance with Drax’s initiative to monitor forest management and timber market trends across its 
supply chain, the following report was conducted to examine the fiber catchment area in southeast 
Georgia and portions of northeast Florida that supports the Georgia Biomass and Fram Renewable Fuels’ 
wood pellet mills (including two aggregate suppliers to Fram1). Specifically, the catchment area (denoted 
‘Georgia’ catchment area in this report) that supports these seven mills includes a combined 51 counties 
in Georgia and Florida and covers an area approximately 60,000 square kilometers in size (see Figure 1).  
Combined production capacity of these seven pellet mills totals approximately 1.96 million metric tons of 
wood pellets annually. However, note that only Georgia Biomass, Hazlehurst Wood Pellets, and Archer 
Forest Products consume roundwood for pellet production. The remaining four mills utilize residuals only 
(i.e. sawmill residuals, shavings, and sawdust).

Drax – September 2020 
Forest Area, Timber Inventory, & Annual Wood Demand 
Forest Area. 
According to US Forest Service data, the Georgia catchment area contains an estimated 
4.2 million hectares of forestland, constituting approximately 70% of the catchment 
area’s total land area. Specifically, 96% of total forestland (4.0 million hectares) is 
classified as timberland, or forestland that is capable of commercial timber production. 
Also note that 91% of total timberland is privately owned versus 9% public. 
The total area of timberland held relatively steady through the 2000s and early 2010s, 
averaging roughly 4,111,000 hectares in the catchment area from 2000-2011. However, 
since 2011, timberland area has declined more than 115,800 hectares (-2.8%), falling to 
roughly 3,995,028 hectares in 2018, the latest available.

Inventory.  
Total growing stock inventory on timberland totaled an estimated 391 million m3 in the 
Georgia catchment area in 2018, of which approximately 72% was softwood (pine) 
species and 28% was hardwood species. In terms of major timber product, approximately 
34% of total growing stock inventory is classified as pine sawtimber, compared to 19% 
pine chip-n-saw, 19% pine pulpwood, 16% hardwood sawtimber, and 12% hardwood 
pulpwood.  
Total timber inventory has steadily increased in the catchment area the last two decades, 
increasing an average of 1.0% per year (+19% total) from 328 million m3 in 2000 to more 
than 391 million m3 in 2018. Inventories of pine pulpwood – the predominant 
roundwood product consumed by the bioenergy industry – held between 80 and 90 
million m3 from 2000-2014. However, since 2014, pine pulpwood inventory has declined 
10%, falling to less than 75 million m3 in 2018.

Drax – September 2020 
Wood Demand. As of July 2020, there were over 50 major wood-consuming mills operating within the 
Georgia catchment area, and an additional 80+ mills operating within close proximity to 
and that procure a portion of their wood from the catchment area. Altogether, total 
wood demand in the Georgia catchment area attributed to these mills was estimated at 
23.6 million metric tons in 2019. Specifically, demand for pine and hardwood pulpwood – 
the roundwood products consumed by the bioenergy industry for wood pellet 
production – totaled a combined 11.7 million metric tons in 2019, or nearly 50% of total 
catchment area wood demand.  
Of the 11.7 million metric tons of total pulpwood demand in the catchment area in 2019, 
approximately 87% was attributed to non-bioenergy-related sources (i.e. predominantly 
pulp/paper); 13% was attributed to the bioenergy sector. Bioenergy-related pulpwood 
demand totaled an estimated 1.6 million metric tons, of which approximately 87% was 
for softwood (pine) pulpwood and 13% was for hardwood pulpwood. 
We’d like to make special note of the uniqueness of this market, particularly as it pertains 
to the pulp/paper industry and its impact on this catchment area. Specifically, there are 
eight pulp/paper mills located within 240 kilometers of one another along the Atlantic 
Coast between Savannah GA and Jacksonville FL, making this one of the most highly 
concentrated pulp/paper markets in not only the US South but also world-wide. 
Furthermore, an additional seven pulp/paper mills are located either inside or within 120 
kilometers of this catchment area. Together, these 15 mills produce more than 7.8 
million metric tons of pulp/paper annually and are responsible for roughly 45% of all 
wood demand placed on the Georgia catchment area.

Drax – September 2020 
Summary of Analysis Findings 
The following report provides a detailed assessment of the Georgia catchment area, including examination 
and identification of trends in forest area, timber inventory, growth, removals, wood demand, raw material 
prices, and harvest activities and management practices since 2000. In addition, this report also includes 
an assessment of long-term market sustainability and provides a market outlook through 2022.  
Key report findings are highlighted and summarized in the table below and on the following pages. 
 
Is there any evidence 
that bioenergy demand 
has caused the following:  
Analysis Findings 
Deforestation? 
No. US Forest Service (USFS) data shows a 108,130-hectare (-2.6%) decrease in total 
timberland in the Georgia catchment area since Georgia Biomass’ first full year of 
production in 2012. Specifically, this loss in total area of timberland coincided with a 
more than 21,000-hectare increase in cropland/pastureland and a more than 73,000-
hectare increase in urban land and land classified as having other uses.  
However, there is little evidence to suggest that increased wood demand from the 
bioenergy sector has caused this decrease in total timberland. Furthermore, pine 
timberland – the primary source of roundwood utilized by the bioenergy industry – 
has increased more than 17,000 hectares in the catchment area since 2016.  
A change in 
management practices 
(rotation lengths, 
thinnings, conversion 
from hardwood to pine)? 
No. Changes in management practices have occurred in the catchment area over the last 
two decades. However, there is little evidence to suggest that bioenergy demand, 
which accounts for roughly 10-14% of total pulpwood demand (and only 5-7% of total 
wood demand in the catchment area), has caused or is responsible for these changes. 
Clearcuts and thinnings are the two major types of harvests that occur in this region, 
both of which are long-standing, widely used methods of harvesting timber. 
TimberMart-South (TMS) data shows that thinnings accounted for 67% of total 
reported harvest area in the southeast Georgia market from 2000-2010, but only 43% 
of total harvest area reported from 2012-2019. Specifically, this downward shift was 
initiated by the bursting of the US housing bubble in the mid-2000s and had been 
completed by the early 2010s. We’d like to note that this shift coincided with a nearly 
50% decrease in pine sawtimber stumpage price from 2006-2012. This is important 
because the strength of pine sawtimber markets had been a driving force behind 
timber management decisions in this region in the early and mid-2000s. 
Also, contributing to the decreased prevalence of thinnings was the strengthening of 
pine pulpwood markets in the mid-2000s, as pine pulpwood stumpage prices 
increased more than 40% in the Georgia catchment area from 2003-2008. So, with 
sawtimber markets continuing to weaken and pulpwood markets doing just the 
opposite, the data suggests that many landowners decided to alter their management 
approach (to take advantage of strong pulpwood markets) and focus on short 
pulpwood rotations that typically do not utilize thinnings. 
Ultimately, the shift in management approach that occurred in this market can be 
linked to the weakening of one type of timber market and the strengthening of 
another. In the early and mid-2000s, timber management was focused on sawtimber 
production – a type of management that utilizes thinnings. However, for more than a 
decade now, this market has been driven to a large degree by the pulp/paper industry, 
with a significant portion of the timber management in this area focused on short 
pulpwood rotations.

Drax – September 2020 
Is there any evidence 
that bioenergy demand 
has caused the following:  
Analysis Findings 
Diversion from other 
markets? 
No. Demand for softwood (pine) sawlogs increased an estimated 39% in the Georgia 
catchment area from 2011-2019. Also, increased bioenergy demand has caused no 
diversion from other pulpwood markets (i.e. pulp/paper), as pulpwood demand not 
attributed to bioenergy held steady and remained nearly unchanged from 2012-2017 
before increasing in 2018 and 2019 due to the influx of salvage wood brought about 
by Hurricane Michael. 
We’d like to make special note that increased demand for softwood sawlogs since 
2011 has not resulted in a full pine sawtimber (PST) stumpage price recovery in this 
market. Reduced demand for softwood sawlogs in the late 2000s and early 2010s 
resulted in oversupply, and this oversupply has remained, despite increased demand 
the last 6-8 years. As a result, PST stumpage prices have held steady and averaged 
roughly $30 per ton in the catchment area since 2013 – down approximately 35% from 
the 2000-2006 average of more than $46 per ton, but up roughly 15% from the 2011-
2012 average of approximately $26 per ton. 
An unexpected or 
abnormal increase in 
wood prices? 
No / Inconclusive. The delivered price of pine pulpwood (PPW) – the primary roundwood 
product consumed by both Georgia Biomass and Fram – increased 26% in the Georgia 
catchment area over the six years directly following the startup of Georgia Biomass, 
increasing from $29.16 per ton in 2011 to $36.63 per ton in 2017. And while this 26% 
increase in delivered PPW price coincided with a roughly 1.1 million metric ton 
increase in annual pine pulpwood demand from Georgia Biomass and Fram, total 
demand for pine pulpwood (from both bioenergy and other sources) actually 
decreased 7% over this period. Moreover, evidence suggest that this increase in PPW 
price is more closely linked to changes in wood supply, specifically, the 9% decrease in 
PPW inventory from 2011-2017. 
However, there is evidence that links increased demand from the bioenergy sector to 
an increase in secondary residual (i.e. sawmill chips, sawdust, and shavings) prices. 
Specifically, the price of pine sawmill chips – a residual feedstock utilized by the 
bioenergy industry for wood pellet production – held steady and averaged 
approximately $26 per ton in the Georgia catchment area from 2008-2012. However, 
from 2012-2016, pine sawmill chip prices increased more than 15% (to $29.55 per ton 
in 2016). This increase in price coincided with annual pine residual feedstock 
purchases by Georgia Biomass and Fram increasing from roughly 325,000 metric tons 
to nearly 1.0 million metric tons over this period. However, note that pine sawmill chip 
prices have held steady and averaged roughly $29.50 per ton in the catchment area 
since 2016, despite further increases in pine secondary residual purchases by Georgia 
Biomass and Fram (to more than 1.2 million metric tons in 2019). 
Ultimately, the data suggests that any excess supply of pine secondary residuals in the 
catchment area was absorbed by the bioenergy sector in the early and mid-2010s, and 
the additional demand/competition placed on this market led to increased residual 
prices. However, the plateauing of residual prices since 2015 along with the continued 
increase in secondary residual purchases by Georgia Biomass and Fram further suggest 
that an increasing percentage of secondary residual purchases by the bioenergy sector 
is sourced from outside the catchment area. Specifically, Fram confirmed this notion, 
noting that 35-40% of its secondary residual purchases come from outside the Georgia 
catchment area (from six different states in the US South).   
A reduction in growing 
stock timber? 
No. Total growing stock inventory in the catchment area increased 11% from 2011 through 
2018, the latest available. Specifically, over this period, inventories of pine sawtimber 
and chip-n-saw increased 35% and 13%, respectively. However, pine pulpwood 
inventory decreased 11% from 2011-2018.

Drax – September 2020 
Is there any evidence 
that bioenergy demand 
has caused the following:  
Analysis Findings 
Note that the decrease in pine pulpwood inventory was not due to increased demand 
from bioenergy (or other sources) or increased harvesting above the sustainable yield 
capacity of the forest area – as annual growth of pine pulpwood has exceeded annual 
removals every year since 2011. Rather, this decrease can be linked to the 24% decline 
in pine sawtimber removals that occurred from 2005-2014 (due to the bursting of the 
US housing bubble and Great Recession that followed). In this region, timber is 
typically harvested via clearcut once it reaches maturity (i.e. sawtimber grade), after 
which the stand is reestablished, and the cycle repeated. However, with the reduced 
harvest levels during this period also came a reduction in newly reestablished timber 
stands – the source of pine pulpwood. So, with less replantings occurring during this 
period, inventories of pine pulpwood were not replenished to the same degree they 
had been previously, and therefore this catchment area saw a reduction in pine 
pulpwood inventory levels. 
However, according to the US Forest Service, annual removals of pine sawtimber have 
increased 50% in the Georgia catchment area since 2014, which would suggest higher 
clearcut levels and increased stand reestablishment. TimberMart-South data also 
supports this assertion, as clearcut harvests have constituted approximately 60% of 
the total harvest area reported to TimberMart-South in this region since 2014, 
compared to 40% from 2005-2014. Ultimately, these increases in clearcut (and stand 
reestablishment) levels may not be reflected in increased pine pulpwood inventory 
levels in the short term – as it can take more than 10 years for a pine seedling to 
become merchantable and reach the minimum diameter requirements to be classified 
as pulpwood. However, adequate supply levels are expected to remain in the 
meantime. Furthermore, pine pulpwood inventory levels are expected to increase in 
the mid-to-long terms as a result of the increased harvest levels and stand 
reestablishment levels that have occurred in the catchment area since 2014.  
A reduction in the 
sequestration rate of 
carbon? 
No / Inconclusive. US Forest Service data shows the average annual growth rate of total 
growing stock timber has remained nearly unchanged (holding between 6.0% and 
6.1%) in the catchment area since 2011, which would suggest that the sequestration 
rate of carbon has also changed very little in the catchment area the last 8-10 years. 
However, the 11% increase in total growing stock inventory since 2011 does indicate 
that total carbon storage levels have increased in the Georgia catchment area since 
Georgia Biomass commenced operations in this market.    
An increase in harvesting 
above the sustainable 
yield capacity of the 
forest area? 
No. Growth-to-removals (G:R) ratios, which compare annual timber growth to annual 
harvests, provides a measure of market demand relative to supply as well as a gauge 
of market sustainability. In 2018, the latest available, the G:R ratio for pine pulpwood, 
the predominant timber product utilized by the bioenergy sector, equaled 1.06 (a 
value greater than 1.0 indicates sustainable harvest levels). Note, however, that the 
pine pulpwood G:R ratio averaged 1.44 from 2012-2017. The significant drop in 2018 
was due to a 31% increase in removals (due to Hurricane Michael) and is not reflective 
of the new norm. Specifically, pine pulpwood removals are projected to be more in 
line with pre-2018 levels in 2019 and 2020, and so too is the pine pulpwood G:R ratio.

Drax – September 2020 
Impact of bioenergy 
demand on:  
Analysis Findings 
Timber growing stock 
inventory 
Neutral. According to USFS data, inventories of pine pulpwood decreased 11% in the 
catchment area from 2011-2018. However, that decrease was not due to increased 
demand from bioenergy. Typically, a reduction in inventory is linked to harvest levels 
above the sustainable yield capacity of the forest area, but in this case, annual growth of 
pine pulpwood exceeded annual removals every year during this period.  
Ultimately, the decrease in pine pulpwood inventory from 2011-2018 can be linked to 
decreased pine sawtimber production beginning in the mid-2000s. Specifically, annual 
removals of pine sawtimber decreased 24% from 2005-2014, and the reduction in 
harvest levels during this period meant fewer new pine stands were reestablished, and 
that has led to the current reduction in pine pulpwood inventory. (Note that the 
decrease in pine sawtimber removals from 2005-2014 was mirrored by a 27% increase in 
pine sawtimber inventory over this same period). However, USFS data shows that annual 
removals of pine sawtimber have increased 50% in the Georgia catchment area since 
2014, which suggests that pine pulpwood inventory levels will start to increase in the 
catchment area due to increased harvest levels and the subsequent increase in stand 
reestablishment levels.  
Timber growth rates 
Neutral. Timber growth rates have increased for both pine sawtimber and pine chip-n-saw 
but decreased slightly for pine pulpwood in the catchment area since 2011. Evidence 
suggests that this decrease in pine pulpwood growth rate is not due to increases in 
bioenergy demand, but rather linked to changes in diameter class distribution and 
indicative of a forest in a state of transition, where timber is moving up in product class 
(i.e. pine pulpwood is moving up in classification to pine chip-n-saw).  
Forest area 
Neutral. In the Georgia catchment area, total forest area (timberland) decreased more than 
115,000 hectares (-2.8%) from 2011 through 2018. Note that this decrease coincided 
with a roughly 19,000-hectare increase in cropland and 93,000-hectare increase in urban 
land and land classified as having other uses. 
Specifically, pine timberland, the primary source of roundwood utilized by the bioenergy 
industry, decreased over 34,000 hectares from 2011-2016. However, from 2016-2018, 
pine timberland stabilized and rather increased more than 17,000 hectares in the 
catchment area (or a net decrease of roughly 17,000 hectares from 2011-2018). 
Ultimately, there is little evidence that the decrease in pine timberland from 2011-2016 
or increase since 2016 is linked to increased bioenergy demand. Rather, the overall 
decrease in pine timberland since 2011 appears to be more closely linked to the relative 
weakness of pine sawtimber markets in the Georgia catchment area and the lack of 
return from sawtimber.  
Wood prices 
Positive / Negative. Intuitively, an increase in demand should result in an increase in price, 
and this is what the data shows in the Georgia catchment area as it relates to increased 
biomass demand from Georgia Biomass and Fram and the prices of the various raw 
materials consumed by these mills. Specifically, the 1.4-million metric ton increase in 
softwood pulpwood demand attributed to Georgia Biomass and Fram coincided with a 
20% increase in delivered pine pulpwood price and a 10-15% increase in pine chip prices 
from 2011-2015. Since 2015, biomass demand has held relatively steady, and, overall, so 
too have delivered pine pulpwood and pine chip prices. The apparent link between 
increased bioenergy demand and increased pine raw material prices is supported further 
by statistical analysis, as strong positive correlations were found between softwood 
biomass demand and both delivered pine pulpwood and pine chip prices. However, note 
that biomass demand alone is not responsible for these changes in prices, as softwood 
biomass demand accounts for only 10-15% of total softwood pulpwood demand in the 
catchment area. Rather, the prices of these raw materials are impacted to a larger

Drax – September 2020 
degree by demand from other sources (i.e. pulp/paper), which accounts for 85-90% of 
total softwood pulpwood demand in the Georgia catchment area.  
On the other hand, it’s also important to note that the increase in bioenergy-related 
wood demand has been a positive for forest landowners in the Georgia catchment area. 
Not only has bioenergy provided an additional outlet for pulpwood in this market, but 
the increase in pulpwood prices as a result of increased pulpwood demand has 
transferred through to landowners (improved compensation). Specifically, since 2015, 
pine pulpwood (PPW) stumpage price – the price paid to landowners – has averaged 
more than $17 per ton in the Georgia catchment area. This represents a 70% increase 
over the approximately $10 per ton averaged by PPW stumpage in the catchment area 
over the five years prior to Georgia Biomass’ startup in 2Q 2011.  
(Note: Pine pulpwood stumpage prices are notably higher in the Georgia catchment area 
due to a much tighter balance in supply and demand (in comparison to most other 
markets across the US South). For instance, in all other areas across the US South2, PPW 
stumpage prices have averaged less than $9 per ton since 2015, or roughly half that of 
prices in the Georgia catchment area).  
Markets for solid wood 
products 
Positive. In the Georgia catchment area, demand for softwood sawlogs used to produce 
lumber and other solid wood products increased an estimated 39% from 2011-2019, and 
by-products of the sawmilling process are sawmill residuals – materials utilized by 
Georgia Biomass and the Fram mills to produce wood pellets. With the increased 
production of softwood lumber, so too has come an increase in sawmill residuals, some 
of which have been purchased/consumed by Georgia Biomass and Fram. Not only have 
these pellet producers benefited from the greater availability of this by-product, but 
lumber producers have also benefited, as the Georgia Biomass and Fram mills have 
provided an additional outlet for these producers and their by-products. 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
                                                           
2 The US South includes Alabama, Arkansas, Florida, Georgia, Louisiana, Mississippi, North Carolina, South Carolina, Tennessee, Texas, and 
Virginia. According to TimberMart-South, pine pulpwood stumpage prices have averaged $8.83 per ton across the South, excluding Florida and 
Georgia (the two states in which the Georgia catchment area is located), since 2015.

1.  Report Background 
Drax Group is a British electrical power generation and supply company that runs Europe’s biggest 
biomass-fueled power station, supplying between 7-8% of the country’s electricity needs. Drax is also 
among the world’s largest single-point consumers of wood and is committed to sourcing that wood 
responsibly. 
In accordance with Drax’s initiative to monitor forest management and timber market trends across its 
supply chain, the following report, conducted by Hood Consulting, focuses specifically on the fiber 
catchment area in southeast Georgia and portions of northeast Florida that supports Georgia Biomass 
and Fram Renewable Fuels’ four pellet mills (including two additional pellet mills that serve as aggregate 
suppliers to Fram). Specifically, this catchment area analysis examines and identifies trends with timber 
inventory, growth, removals, wood demand, raw material prices, and harvest activities and practices in 
the southeast Georgia catchment area since 2000. It also includes an assessment of long-term market 
sustainability and provides a market outlook through 2022. 
The seven mills for which this catchment area is defined have a combined production capacity of 
approximately 1.96 million metric tons of wood pellets annually, with total roundwood demand totaling 
between 1.5 and 1.7 million metric tons annually. Mill details include: 
 
Georgia Biomass is located in Waycross, Georgia, and commenced pellet production in April 2011. The Georgia Biomass 
mill is among the largest facilities of its kind in the world, with an annual production capacity of approximately 750,000 
metric tons of wood pellets. 
 
Appling County Pellets, the wholly owned subsidiary of Fram Renewable Fuels, is located in Baxley, Georgia, and 
commenced pellet production in March 2008. The facility utilizes both softwood and hardwood feedstock and has an 
annual production capacity of 200,000 metric tons of wood pellets. 
 
Hazlehurst Wood Pellets, the wholly owned subsidiary of Fram Renewable Fuels, is located in Hazlehurst, Georgia and 
commenced pellet production in January 2014. The facility utilizes softwood feedstock and has a production capacity of 
500,000 metric tons of wood pellets per year.

2. Defined Catchment Area  
A mill’s catchment area is the area in which a single pellet mill (“nucleus mill”) has directly acquired fiber 
since the mill started operations, including any additional forest areas where future purchase contracts 
exist. However, given the proximity of the Georgia Biomass and Fram pellets mills, the catchment areas of 
these mills largely overlap one another and can be combined to form one single catchment area.  
Catchment Area Boundary 
The combined catchment area for Georgia Biomass and Fram (denoted ‘Georgia’ catchment area 
hereafter) was identified based on historic wood purchases data provided by these two companies. 
Specifically, this area includes a combined 51 counties in Georgia and Florida and covers an area 
approximately 23,000 square miles (≈14.8 million acres) in size. It extends from beyond Swainsboro GA in 
the north to Lake City FL in the south, and from the Atlantic Coast to the east (from roughly Savannah GA 
to Jacksonville FL) to Albany GA in the west. 
Note that all roundwood purchased by Georgia Biomass3 and nearly 100% of Fram’s historic roundwood 
purchases have come from within the defined catchment area. The exception for Fram includes roughly 
4,500 tons of roundwood purchased by Hazlehurst Wood Pellets in the following Georgia counties: Burke, 
Chatham, Crawford, Houston, Jones, Macon, Twiggs, and Wilkinson.

3.1.1.1  Timberland 
Not all forestland is capable of commercial timber production. However, the USDA provides an alternative 
designation for forestland that can be commercially productive. Timberland is defined by the USDA as 
forestland that is capable of producing at least 20 ft3 of industrial wood per year.  
In the Georgia catchment area, timberland constitutes 96% of total forestland and totals approximately 
3,995,028 hectares. Note that this report will focus specifically on timberland, and all data provided 
hereafter regarding timber inventory, growth, and removals will be from timberland only. 
Ownership of timberland in the Georgia catchment area is similar to that of forestland, with 91% 
(3,633,281 hectares) of total timberland privately owned, compared to 2% (94,319 hectares) National 
Forests, 3% (109,293 hectares) other federal, and 4% (158,135 hectares) owned by state and local 
authorities.

Age Class Distribution 
According to US Forest Service data, of the 3,995,028 hectares of timberland in the catchment area, 
approximately 55% (2,199,636 hectares) is classified as softwood timberland, 36% (1,440,687 hectares) is 
classified as hardwood timberland, and 9% (354,704 hectares) is classified as mixed pine-hardwood 
timberland. 
Distribution of timberland area by age class varies by forest type. Specifically, 79% of softwood 
timberland is 35 years of age or younger, with the average age of softwood timberland estimated at 25.3 
years of age. The distribution of hardwood timberland by age class shows approximately 64% is 50 years 
of age or younger. However, 19% of hardwood timberland area is five years of age or younger. This value 
likely includes transitional stands and those with low stocking levels that will likely not reach maturity. 
Excluding this youngest age class, approximately 84% of the remaining hardwood timberland area is 6-75 
years old, with the average age of hardwood timberland estimated at 45.8 years of age.  
The distribution of mixed pine-hardwood timberland shows 61% is 35 years of age or younger, with 85% 
60 years of age or younger (average age estimated at 33.8 years old).

Stand Origin 
The US Forest Service provides two classifications for stand origin: 1) naturally regenerated and 2) 
planted. The USFS defines a naturally regenerated timber stand as one that has been established 
naturally. A planted timber stand is defined as an artificially regenerated stand established by planting or 
artificial seedling.  
According to the most current USFS estimates, approximately 57% (2,259,587 hectares) of total 
catchment area timberland is classified as naturally regenerated forests, compared to 43% (1,735,440 
hectares) planted forests. However, distribution of timberland area by stand origin varies widely by major 
forest type. 
US Forest Service data shows 33% (804,835 hectares) of softwood timberland is naturally regenerated 
versus 67% (1,621,415 hectares) planted. In contrast, 93% (1,454,753 hectares) of hardwood timberland 
is naturally regenerated, compared to 7% (114,026 hectares) planted.

3.2  Timber Inventory 
Timber inventory data for the Georgia catchment area is provided by the US Forest Service - Forest 
Inventory & Analysis (FIA) program. FIA data utilizes approximately 50-60 sample plots per county to 
calculate inventory estimates, with sampling errors of 10-25%.  
Note that this section profiles timber inventory, growth, and removal details as of 20184, the most 
current available. Further analysis, including inventory trends since 2000 and projections through 2022, is 
provided in the Market Trends, Analysis, & Outlook section beginning on page 54. 
3.2.1  Ownership Group 
Growing stock inventory on timberland in the Georgia catchment area in 2018, the latest available, 
totaled an estimated 391 million m3, of which approximately 87% (342 million m3) is privately owned, 5% 
(19 million m3) is owned by other federal authorities, 5% (18 million m3) is owned by state and local 
authorities, and 3% (12 million m3) is National Forest.  
Note that the distributions of both softwood and hardwood growing stock inventory by ownership group 
are nearly identical to that of total growing stock inventory. See Table 7 for details.

3.2.2  Diameter Class Distribution 
Distribution of total growing stock inventory on timberland by diameter class varies by major species 
group. Based on the most current US Forest Service estimates, approximately 83% (236 million m3) of 
total softwood growing stock inventory is 5- 17 inches in diameter, with 96% (272 million m3) less than 23 
inches in diameter. In comparison, 71% (77 million m3) of total hardwood growing stock inventory is 5- 17 
inches in diameter, with 91% (98 million m3) less than 23 inches in diameter. 
Based on these diameter class distributions, softwood growing stock inventory averages an estimated 
12.5 inches in diameter, compared to 14.3 inches for hardwood growing stock inventory.

In addition, FIA estimates of diameter class distribution by major species group allow us to break down 
volume estimates according to major timber product. Also note that softwood and pine are used 
interchangeably, as pine constitutes 100% of total softwood inventory in the catchment area (according 
to FIA data). Individual product specifications are defined as follows: 
Major Product  
DBH (inches) 
Pine Pulpwood  
5.0 – 8.9 
Pine Chip-n-saw 
9.0 – 11.9 
Pine Sawtimber  
12.0+ 
Hardwood Pulpwood 
5.0 – 11.9 
Hardwood Sawtimber  12.0+ 
 
Based on these product specifications, approximately 133 million m3 (34%) of total growing stock 
inventory is classified as pine sawtimber, compared to 75 million m3 (19%) of pine chip-n-saw, 75 million 
m3 (19%) of pine pulpwood, 63 million m3 (16%) of hardwood sawtimber, and 46 million m3 (12%) of 
hardwood pulpwood.

3.2.3  Age Class Distribution 
Distribution of total growing stock volume on timberland by age class is bimodal, with 50% of total 
inventory 11-40 years of age and 29% of total inventory 51-80 years of age (see Figure 9). However, this is 
explained by major species composition and its respective age class distribution. 
According to USFS estimates, softwood growing stock inventory averages an estimated 39.1 years of age, 
with 61% (158 million m3) of total softwood inventory 11-35 years of age and 71% (200 million m3) 50 years 
of age or younger. In contrast, hardwood inventory averages an estimated 60.6 years of age, with 54% (58 
million m3) of hardwood inventory 46-80 years of age and 83% (90 million m3) 21-90 years of age.

Growing Stock Inventory by Age Class & Ownership Group 
Note that the bimodal distribution of total growing stock inventory by age class (see Figure 9 on pg. 
30) is also influenced by the differing approaches to timber management (i.e. private versus public 
land management).  
Figure 10 shows total growing stock inventory on timberland in the Georgia catchment area in 2018 
by both age class and ownership group. According to USFS data, nearly two-thirds of growing stock 
inventory on privately-owned timberland is 50 years of age or younger. Specifically, looking at Figure 
10(a) below, the high distribution of privately-owned timber inventory between 0 and 40 years of age 
is largely a reflection of the working forest area in the Georgia catchment area timber. This is 
predominantly pine forest with shorter rotation lengths (typically less than 35 years).   
On the other hand, over two-thirds of growing stock inventory on public timberland is older than 50 
years of age. Specifically, 54% of public timber inventory is 51-80 years of age (see Figure 10(b)). In 
general, the US Forest Service manages public timberland on a maximum sustained yield basis, which 
for softwood (pine) timber translates to rotation lengths in excess of 50 years. So, looking back at 
Figure 9, the bimodal distribution of timber inventory (softwood inventory in particular) reflects not 
only the private working forest area but also publicly owned and managed forests in the Georgia 
catchment area.

3.2.4  Stand Origin 
US Forest Service data includes two classifications for stand origin: 1) naturally regenerated timber stands 
and 2) planted timber stands. Specifically, naturally regenerated timber stands are defined by the USFS as 
those that have been established naturally. A planted timber stand is defined as an artificially regenerated 
stand established by planting or artificial seedling. 
Based on the most current US Forest Service FIA estimates, approximately 61% of total growing stock 
volume in the catchment area, or 240 million m3, is naturally regenerated timber, compared to 39% (151 
million m3) planted. However, stand origin distribution varies widely by major species group. 
US Forest Service data shows approximately 48% (136 million m3) of softwood growing stock inventory is 
naturally regenerated versus 52% (148 million m3) planted. In contrast, approximately 97% (104 million 
m3) of hardwood inventory is naturally regenerated, compared to 3% (3 million m3) planted.

3.3  Timber Growth & Removals 
3.3.1  Timber Growth 
According to US Forest Service estimates, net annual growth of growing stock timber in the Georgia 
catchment area totaled an estimated 23.6 million m3 in 2018, the latest available. Specifically, 86% (20.2 
million m3) of total growth was attributed to softwood species compared to 14% (3.3 million m3) 
hardwood species.  
Annual growth was highest for pine pulpwood, totaling 9.2 million m3 and accounting for 39% of total 
volume growth, followed by pine chip-n-saw at 5.6 million m3 (24%), pine sawtimber at 5.4 million m3 
(23%), hardwood pulpwood at 2.2 million m3 (9%), and hardwood sawtimber at 1.2 million m3 (5%).

3.3.2  Timber Removals 
According to the USFS, timber removals in the catchment area totaled 21.1 million m3 in 2018, of which 
approximately 93% (19.7 million m3) was softwood timber and 7% (1.4 million m3) was hardwood timber.  
Of the five major timber products, removals were highest for pine pulpwood, totaling 8.7 million m3 and 
accounting for 41% of total removals, followed by pine chip-n-saw at 5.7 million m3 (27%), pine 
sawtimber at 5.3 million m3 (25%), hardwood pulpwood at 0.8 million m3 (4%), and hardwood sawtimber 
at 0.6 million m3 (3%).

3.3.3  Growth-to-Removals Ratios 
Growth-to-removals analysis compares annual timber growth to annual harvests and provides a measure 
of market demand relative to supply. A growth-to-removals ratio of 1.0 indicates a balanced market 
where growth equals removals. A value of >1 indicates growth exceeds removals, signifying sustainable 
harvest levels (as well as oversupply). A value of <1 indicates removals (or harvest levels) exceed growth, 
signifying more highly competitive market conditions and harvest levels that are unsustainable over the 
long term. 
According to US Forest Service data from 2018, the latest available, overall inventory growth totaled 23.6 
million m3, compared to total removals of 21.1 million m3, or a growth-to-removals ratio of 1.12. The 
growth-to-removal ratio for softwood species was 1.03, compared to 2.30 for hardwood species. 
Growth-to-removals ratios by species and individual timber product in 2018 were as follows: pine 
sawtimber=1.02, pine chip-n-saw=0.98, pine pulpwood=1.06, hardwood sawtimber=1.90, and hardwood 
pulpwood=2.60. Note that growth-to-removals ratios for the three major pine products were right 
around 1.0, indicating balanced market conditions. In contrast, growth-to-removals ratios for the major 
hardwood products were well above 1.0, indicating sustainable market conditions as well as oversupply.

4.  Wood Demand & Raw Material Cost Assessment 
 
4.1  Mill Capacity & Wood Demand 
According to TimberMart-South’s mill database, as of mid-2020, there were 134 wood-consuming mills 
operating in and around the Georgia catchment area (within roughly 280 kilometers of Georgia Biomass). 
This includes 76 lumber mills (59 softwood mills and 17 hardwood mills), 18 pulp/paper mills, 9 panel 
(plywood/OSB) mills, 16 chip mills, and 11 pellet mills.  
Total production capacity associated with these 134 mills translates to nearly 58 million metric tons of 
roundwood per year. However, not all wood consumed by these mills are procured from within the 
Georgia catchment area. Based on the relative location of these mills to this catchment area, the total 
allocated capacity of these mills to the Georgia catchment area is estimated at approximately 24.6 million 
metric tons of roundwood.

4.1.1  Catchment Area Wood Demand 
Note that total capacity is not the same as actual demand, but rather the maximum potential demand 
associated with mills running at full production capacity. While total capacity is estimated at 
approximately 24.6 million metric tons annually, actual wood demand5 in the Georgia catchment area in 
2018, the latest available, was estimated at 23.6 million metric tons. 
Distribution of total wood demand by major species in 2018 included 91% (21.5 million metric tons) 
softwood versus 9% (2.0 million metric tons) hardwood. Specifically, 51% of total softwood demand was 
attributed to softwood pulpwood compared to 49% softwood sawlogs. Similarly, of total hardwood 
demand, 57% was attributed to hardwood pulpwood versus 43% hardwood sawlogs.

4.1.1.1  Biomass Demand 
Biomass demand, defined in this analysis as softwood and hardwood pulpwood (roundwood) consumed 
by pellet or other bioenergy facilities, totaled an estimated 1.2 million metric tons in 2018, the latest 
available, accounting for approximately 10% of total pulpwood demand. Non-bioenergy related pulpwood 
demand, almost entirely for pulp/paper production, accounted for approximately 90% of total pulpwood 
demand in the catchment area. 
Note that not all wood consumed by a pellet mill or other bioenergy facility is encompassed in biomass 
demand. Wood consumption (demand) at pellet and other bioenergy facilities generally includes a 
combination of wood chips and sawmill residuals. However, sawmill residuals are a by-product of the 
sawmilling process – from the processing of sawlogs, not pulpwood. As such, sawmill residuals consumed 
by biomass facilities are not included in this calculation of biomass demand.

4.2  Raw Material Costs   
Current and historic prices for both stumpage and delivered timber as well as pulp quality chips have 
been provided by TimberMart-South (TMS). Note that these prices are specific to the Georgia catchment 
area and are average market prices calculated from actual timber sales reported to TMS.  
 
4.2.1  Stumpage (Standing Timber) Prices 
Stumpage price is the value of timber as it stands uncut on the stump and is what landowners are paid by 
loggers and other wood buyers for their standing timber.   
Table 19 below provides annual average stumpage prices in the Georgia catchment area for each of the 
five major timber products since 2000. Prices are also shown graphically in Figure 18 on the following 
page. For a detailed assessment of these prices and historic trends, see the Market Trends, Analysis, & 
Outlook section beginning on page 56.

4.2.4  Timber Price Drivers 
A detailed assessment of raw material prices and price trends is provided in the Market Trends, Analysis, 
& Outlook section beginning on page 56. However, we would like to point out and highlight some of the 
major price drivers of pine pulpwood – the predominant roundwood product consumed by the bioenergy 
sector in the Georgia catchment area. 
 
 Domestic Economy.  The state of the domestic economy, historically, has been a strong indicator 
of timber prices in both the Georgia catchment area and across the South. Financial markets 
generally reflect economic conditions, and the figure below shows that pine pulpwood stumpage 
prices in the catchment area have closely followed the Dow Jones Industrial Average (DJIA) since 
2000. Pine pulpwood prices and the DJIA did deviate from one another in 2018 and 2019. 
However, this deviation was due to excess supply (salvage wood) created by Hurricane Michael.

 Weather. Weather trends also impact timber prices in this catchment area and across the South. 
However, these trends are much more seasonal in nature and affect short-term price 
movements. In this region, wet conditions typically persist throughout the winter (in the 1st and 
4th quarters of the year), creating wood accessibility issues and constraining supply. And, as a 
result, timber prices increase over the short term. However, wet winters are followed by hot 
summers, which alleviate supply constraints and provide greater access to wood. In turn, with 
supply no longer an issue, timber prices decline in the short term (typically during the 2nd or 3rd 
quarter of the year).

Drax – September 2020 
The Georgia catchment area is also impacted periodically by hurricanes and tropical storms, with 
hurricane season typically occurring between July and October (3rd and 4th quarters of the year). 
These storms can bring heavy rainfall that constrain wood supply, driving prices upward in the 
short term. However, tropical storms with extremely high winds can also cause extensive forest 
damage, resulting in short-term oversupply from wood salvage and driving prices downward. 
The figure on the preceeding page shows quarterly average pine pulpwood stumpage prices in 
the Georgia catchment from 1Q 2000 through 1Q 2020, with seasonal weather-related price 
spikes highlighted in red. Note that of the 10 seasonal spikes identified in that figure, eight (80%) 
occurred in either the 1st or 4th quarter of the year. 
 
 Competition.  In the Georgia catchment area, demand for pine pulpwood (the primary 
roundwood product consumed for pellet production) is largely driven by the pulp/paper industry. 
Specifically, there are seven pine pulpwood-consuming pulp/paper mills located along the 
Atlantic Coast between Jacksonville FL and Savannah GA, which together consume an estimated 
6-8 million tons of roundwood (pulpwood) annually. Competition is inherently high as a result of 
this high level of mill concentration, especially with the Atlantic Ocean serving as a barrier to the 
east, leading to increased pine pulpwood prices (relative to the western portion of the catchment 
area as well as most other markets across the region).   
For a more detailed look at how mill concentration and mill competition impact pine pulpwood 
prices in the Georgia catchment area, see Annex 1.

5. Forest Management Practices Assessment 
Historic timber sales reported to TimberMart-South were examined to help assess how forest 
management practices in the Georgia catchment area and surrounding markets have changed since 2000. 
Specifically, we examined trends related to total sale volume, total sale area, and harvest type to identify 
how this area responds to various market conditions. Study details and key findings are detailed below 
and on the following pages.  
 
5.1  TimberMart-South Harvest Trends 
The TimberMart-South (TMS) sales database includes over 110,000 unique timber sales that have 
occurred throughout the TMS 11-state region since 2000. In addition to providing details regarding 
timber prices (by product), these reported sales include information regarding date of sale, location, sale 
volume, sale size (acres), sale type (final harvest/clearcut vs. thinning), and other unique sale 
characteristics. The data provided in the following section contains some of these stumpage characteristic 
details, particularly those related to trends in sale type and harvesting activities. 
The Georgia catchment area is located in two different TMS regions: Georgia Region 2 and Florida Region 
1 (see highlighted portion in Figure 21 below). Data and trends for this 2-region area (denoted ‘southeast 
Georgia market’ in this section) have been provided by TimberMart-South and are intended to be 
representative of the catchment area.   
Note that TMS database sales utilized for this portion of the assessment only includes those reported 
sales with total sale volumes between 500 and 50,000 tons. Sales that fell outside these parameters were 
excluded to ensure consistency and to mitigate potential bias from major outliers.

Drax – September 2020 
5.1.1  Total Sale Area 
In the southeast Georgia market, the total area of all timber sales reported to TMS has averaged roughly 
19,900 hectares per year since 2000 (see Figure 22). However, more importantly, TMS data shows a shift 
in the distribution of reported sale area by harvest type (clearcut vs. thinning) in comparing trends from 
2000-2010 versus those from 2012-2019.  
Clearcuts and thinnings are the two major types of harvests that occur in the region, both of which are 
long-standing, widely used methods of harvesting timber. In the southeast Georgia market, thinnings 
constituted a majority of the total reported harvest area through the 2000s. Specifically, thinnings 
accounted for 67% of total reported harvest area from 2000-2010 but only 43% of total reported harvest 
area since 2012.    
Ultimately, the southeast Georgia (and northeast Florida) market is driven to a large degree by the 
pulp/paper industry, with a significant portion of the timber management in this area focused on short 
pulpwood rotations (to take advantage of the historically strong pulpwood markets) that do not include 
thinnings. The reduced thinning area (relative to clearcut area) since around 2012 is also a function of the 
relative weakness of sawtimber markets in this area. For example, when pine sawtimber prices are 
strong, thinnings become more prevalent – to promote sawtimber production. However, since pulpwood 
markets are strong (and sawtimber markets are relatively weak), the focus appears to have shifted to 
short rotation timber management with less thinnings.

5.1.2  Total Sale Volume 
In the southeast Georgia market, the total volume of all timber sales reported to TMS has averaged 
approximately 7.1 million metric tons per year since 2000 (see Figure 23). However, as with reported sale 
area, what’s of specific interest are those trends, identified by data reported to TMS, as they relate to 
changes in harvest volume by specific harvest type. 
Specifically, examination of total sale volume reported to TMS by harvest type shows the proportion of 
total volume attributed to thinnings decreased substantially from 2010-2012. Specifically, thinnings 
accounted for 78% of total reported harvest volume in this market from 2000-2010, compared to 50% 
since 2011. Note that the increased distribution of volume thinned (relative to volume clearcut) coincided 
with strong sawtimber markets in the early to mid-2000s. Specifically, pine sawtimber stumpage prices 
averaged more than $45 per ton in this market from 2000-2006, and this high price led many landowners 
to focus on sawtimber production (which utilizes thinnings). However, since 2008, pine sawtimber 
stumpage prices have averaged less than $30 per ton in this market. So, given these relatively weak pine 
sawtimber prices, the focus shifted more towards short pulpwood rotations – a type of timber 
management that generally does not utilize thinnings.

5.1.3  Average Sale Size 
The average size of timber sales reported to TMS in the southeast Georgia market averaged 
approximately 64 hectares from 2000-2019. TimberMart-South data also shows that thinnings have 
averaged 51% (+24 hectares) larger than clearcuts since 2000, with thinnings averaging 73 hectares in 
size compared to 49 hectares for clearcuts. However, we’d like to note that the gap between average 
clearcut size and average thinning size has also narrowed in this market since 2012. Specifically, thinnings 
averaged 66% (+30 hectares) larger than clearcuts from 2000-2010 but only 31% (+16 hectares) larger 
than clearcuts since 2012. 
In general, clearcuts tend to be smaller than thinnings in size due to capital requirements for the 
logger/wood buyer. To elaborate, clearcuts typically remove more timber volume per acre (and higher-
value timber products) compared to thinnings. So, for example, given the same amount of capital, a wood 
buyer/logger can purchase a 50-hectare tract to be clearcut or a 75-hectare tract to be thinned. Also, 
loggers/wood buyers typically prefer larger tracts for thinning because it allows them to take advantage 
of economies of scale. Furthermore, timberland owners and managers that adhere to Sustainable 
Forestry Initiative (SFI) standards must limit the size of cleacuts to roughly 50 hectares or less.

6. Market Trends, Analysis, & Outlook  
The following section provides an examination and assessment of forest market trends in the Georgia 
catchment area since 2000, as well as a market outlook through 2022 which details anticipated changes 
in wood demand and how these changes are likely to impact this market over the next several years.  
6.1  Market Trends & Analysis 
A key aspect of this analysis includes assessing and identifying any links or relationships between biomass-
related wood demand and other market changes (i.e. forest area, inventory, raw material prices, etc.) in 
the catchment area, particularly since Georgia Biomass started up in 2011. As such, this section will begin 
with an assessment of annual wood demand. 
6.1.1  Wood Demand 
Annual wood demand6 in the Georgia catchment area held relatively steady, increasing modestly (+5% 
total; +0.3% per year average) from an estimated 19.3 million metric tons in 2000 to 20.2 million metric 
tons in 2014. Over the three years that followed, total demand increased at a much more rapid pace, 
increasing an average of 2.5% per year (+8% total) to 21.7 million metric tons in 2017. However, in 2018, 
total demand increased to nearly 23.6 million metric tons, up 8% (+1.8 million metric tons) from 2017. 
Note that this increase was due to Hurricane Michael, a Category 5 hurricane that impacted the Florida 
Panhandle before moving inland to the northeast and directly through the Georgia catchment area.

6.1.1.1  Biomass Demand & Total Pulpwood Demand 
Biomass demand is defined as softwood and hardwood pulpwood (roundwood) consumed by pellet or 
other bioenergy facilities.  
Presently, there are seven major wood pellet mills operating within the Georgia catchment area, and an 
additional four pellet mills operating within close proximity to the catchment area. However, only four of 
these 11 mills utilize roundwood for wood pellet production (the other seven mills utilize residuals only):

Enviva Cottondale was the first of these four roundwood-consuming pellet mills to startup, with 
roundwood (biomass) demand attributed to the Georgia catchment area estimated at roughly 20,000 
metric tons in 2008. Total catchment area biomass demand increased to roughly 800,000 metric tons in 
2011 with the startup of Georgia Biomass, and to nearly 1.5 million metric tons in 2015 (following 
Hazlehurst Wood Pellets’ startup in 2014 and Archer FP’s startup in 2015). The shutdown of E-Pellets 
reduced total biomass demand to between 1.2-1.3 million metric tons annually from 2016-2018. 
However, demand increased to nearly 1.6 million metric tons in 2019, following Fram’s purchase and 
restart of the former E-Pellets mill.  
Note that biomass demand is predominantly softwood (pine), with softwood biomass demand accounting 
for 94% of total biomass demand in the Georgia catchment area since 2008 (compared to 6% hardwood 
biomass demand7). Also, biomass-related pulpwood demand accounted for only 2% of total pulpwood 
demand in the Georgia catchment area from 2008-2011, compared to 12% from 2012-2019. For a 
detailed breakdown of biomass and non-biomass-related pulpwood demand in the catchment area since 
2000, see Table 23 on the following page. 
 
                                                           
7 Georgia Biomass is responsible for over 99% of total bioenergy-related hardwood pulpwood purchased in the Georgia catchment area since 
2012. Hardwood pulpwood (roundwood) purchases by Fram have totaled less than 6,400 metric tons overall, or less than 1% of total hardwood 
biomass demand since 2012.

6.1.2  Changes in Land Area & Use 
Notable changes in land area occurred in the Georgia catchment area from 2000-2018, including a 1.5% 
decrease in forestland and a 5.5% decrease in land in farms (i.e. cropland, woodland, and pastureland). 
Also, urban areas or land classified as having other uses more than quadrupled from 2000 to 2018. 
According to the USDA, total forestland decreased from an estimated 4,226,157 hectares in 2000 to 
4,161,035 hectares in 2018, or a net decrease of 65,122 hectares (-1.5%) over this 18-year period. Over 
this same period, land in farms decreased a total of 93,192 hectares, with woodland and pastureland 
decreasing a combined 191,629 hectares (-19%). However, cropland increased an estimated 98,436 
hectares (+14%) from 2000-2018.   
Urban areas and land classified as having other uses increased an estimated 158,315 hectares from 
49,311 hectares in 2000 to 207,627 hectares in 2018. However, note that urban and other lands have 
held relatively steady and averaged roughly 200,000 hectares since 2016. See Table 24 for details.

6.1.3  Changes in Forest Area (Timberland) 
According to the US Forest Service, the total area of timberland in the Georgia catchment area 
experienced a net decrease of 135,195 hectares (-3%) from 2000-2018, the latest available, decreasing 
from 4,130,223 to 3,995,028 hectares over this 18-year period. Specifically, total timberland area held 
relatively steady through the 2000s and early 2010s, averaging roughly 4,111,000 hectares from 2000-
2011. However, from 2011-2018, total Georgia catchment area timberland declined an estimated 
115,827 hectares, or a 2.8% decrease over this period.  
Note that while the total area of timberland has decreased in the catchment area since 2000, planted 
pine timberland (the predominant supplier of pine pulpwood consumed by the pulp/paper and bioenergy 
industries in this market) increased an estimated 51,195 hectares (+3%) from 2000-2018. This increase in 
planted pine timberland coincided with a simultaneous 52,490-hectare decrease in natural pine 
timberland – suggesting that, during this period, much of the natural pine timberland was converted to 
planted pine timberland following final harvest.

Correlation Analysis:  Biomass Demand vs. Timberland 
Figure 32 provides a side-by-side comparison of both biomass demand and total wood demand versus 
timberland area in the catchment area from 2000-2018. In comparing changes in biomass demand to 
changes in timberland area, no noticeable relationship appears evident, as total biomass demand has 
remained relatively constant since 2012 while the total area of timberland has steadily declined. 
Ultimately, correlation analysis identified a moderately strong negative correlation (correlation 
coefficient=-0.68) between biomass demand and timberland area from 2000-2018. 
Looking again at the figure below, notice that timberland area appeared to closely track total wood 
demand through the 2000s. However, since 2010, the two have moved in opposite directions. Ultimately, 
correlation analysis identified a strong negative relationship (correlation coefficient=-0.84) between total 
wood demand and timberland area from 2000-2018. However, we would like to note that a positive 
relationship, albeit weak, was found between total wood demand and planted pine timberland – the 
primary forest type that supports the forest products industry in this catchment area.

Drax – September 2020 
Ultimately, changes in timberland area appear to be more closely linked to both the strength of 
sawtimber markets as well as the alternatives provided by agriculture. Specifically, a positive correlation 
was found between timberland area and pine sawtimber stumpage price (correlation coefficient=0.46) 
while strong negative correlations were found between cropland and both timberland (correlation 
coefficient=-0.70) and pine sawtimber stumpage price (correlation coefficient=-0.90) from 2000-2018. 
This suggests that losses in timberland (since 2011), to some degree, have been impacted by both of 
these items, as weak pine sawtimber stumpage prices have made conversion and investment in 
agriculture more appealing to landowners. Furthermore, these findings also support the case that forest 
management decisions are not driven by biomass markets.

6.1.4  Changes in Timber Inventory 
Timber inventory data for the Georgia catchment area was provided by the US Forest Service - Forest 
Inventory & Analysis (FIA) program from 2000 through 20188, the most current available. According to FIA 
estimates, total growing stock inventory on timberland in the Georgia catchment area increased from 328 
million m3 in 2000 to 391 million m3 in 2018, or a net increase of over 63 million m3 (+19% total; +1.0% 
per year average) over this period.  
Table 27 below (as well as Figures 33 and 34 on the following page) provides a breakdown of timber 
inventory in the catchment area by major timber product from 2000-2018. Note that inventories of pine 
sawtimber and pine chip-n-saw both increased while inventories of pine pulpwood decreased slightly 
from 2000-2018. Inventories of hardwood sawtimber and hardwood pulpwood declined in the early 
2000s, but both have held relatively stable (increased slightly) since.

6.1.4.1  Diameter Class Distribution 
Total growing stock inventory on timberland increased from 328 million m3 in 2000 to 391 million m3 in 
2018, or a net increase of over 63 million m3 (+19% total; +1.0% per year average). Over this period, there 
were also some minor changes in the distribution of growing stock inventory by diameter class. 
Specifically, softwood and hardwood growing stock inventory both increased in average diameter. 
Table 28 below provides a comparison of growing stock inventory estimates in the catchment area by 
major species group and diameter class in 2000, 2009, and 2018. Specifically, USFS data shows that in 
both 2000 and 2009, approximately 87% of softwood growing stock inventory was less than 17 inches in 
diameter, with softwood inventory averaging 11.5 and 11.6 inches in diameter, respectively, in these two 
periods. However, in 2018, approximately 83% of softwood inventory was 17 inches or less in diameter, 
with softwood inventory averaging 12.5 inches in diameter.  
The historic distributions of hardwood growing stock inventory by diameter class show 84% of hardwood 
inventory was less than 19 inches in diameter in 2000, falling to 80% within these same parameters in 
2009 and to 79% in 2018. Hardwood growing stock inventory averaged an estimated 13.7 inches in 
diameter in 2000, compared to 14.2 inches in 2009 and 14.3 inches in 2018.

6.1.4.2  Age Class Distribution 
Changes in growing stock inventory by age class aligns with changes in diameter class distribution. 
Specifically, USFS data indicates that the average age of softwood growing stock inventory increased from 
36.9 years old in 2000 to 39.1 years old in 2018. The average age of hardwood growing stock inventory 
also increased over this same period – from 55.7 years old in 2000 to 60.6 years old in 2018. 
The increase in the average age of both softwood and hardwood growing stock inventory is reflected in 
changes in age class distributions over this period. Specifically, the distribution of softwood growing stock 
inventory 50 years of age or younger decreased from 75% in 2000 to 73% in 2009 and to 71% in 2018. 
Similarly, the distribution of hardwood growing stock inventory 65 years of age or younger decreased 
from 68% to 66% and to 55% over these same three periods.  
Table 29 below provides US Forest Service estimates of softwood and hardwood growing stock inventory 
by age class in 2000, 2009, and 2018. Corresponding values are shows graphically in Figure 36 on the 
following page.

Correlation Analysis:  Biomass Demand vs. Timber Inventory 
US Forest Service data shows that total timber inventory has steadily increased an average of 1.0% per 
year in the Georgia catchment area since 2000. Intuitively, timber inventories can increase one of two 
ways: 1) through additional timberland gains or 2) through an environment in which annual growth 
outpaces annual removals. In this catchment area, the latter has occurred. Specifically, annual timber 
growth has continued to outpace total annual removals (demand), leading to oversupply and increased 
inventory levels.  
However, we would like to note that inventories of pine pulpwood – the predominant timber product 
utilized by the bioenergy industry – have steadily declined since 2008, while total pulpwood demand has 
increased (see Figure 37). Although correlation analysis identified no meaningful relationship between 
pine pulpwood inventory and pine pulpwood demand from 2000-2018 (correlation coefficient=-0.32), a 
moderately strong negative relationship (correlation coefficient=-0.59) was found between these two 
variables from 2008-2018. Results were similar (correlation coefficient=-0.66) for pine pulpwood 
inventory and softwood biomass demand over this same period.

Drax – September 2020 
The negative correlations found between pine pulpwood inventory and both softwood biomass demand 
and non-biomass-related softwood pulpwood demand since 2008 suggest that increases in total 
pulpwood demand (from both bioenergy and other sources), to some degree, has resulted in decreased 
inventories of pine pulpwood. However, changes in softwood inventory by diameter class indicate the 
decrease in pine pulpwood inventory is more closely linked to changes in diameter class distribution. 
Specifically, this data indicates that the catchment area forest is in a state of transition, with pine 
pulpwood inventory moving up in product class and ultimately resulting in reduced pine pulpwood 
inventory levels.

6.1.5  Changes in Annual Timber Growth 
Timber growth data for the Georgia catchment area was provided by the US Forest Service - Forest 
Inventory & Analysis (FIA) program. However, note that FIA growth data for this catchment area is only 
available since 2004.  
According to US Forest Service data, net annual growth of growing stock timber steadily increased at an 
average rate of 0.5% per year from 20.9 million m3 in 2004 to 22.1 million m3 in 2016. However, since 
2016, annual growth has increased at a more accelerated rate, increasing an average of 3.2% per year to 
23.6 million m3 in 2018. Overall, total annual growth increased 13% from 2004-2018.  
Table 31 below (as well as Figure 38 on the following page) provides a breakdown of annual timber 
growth by major timber product from 2004 through 2018, the latest available. Note that annual growth 
of pine sawtimber and pine chip-n-saw both held relatively steady from 2004-2010 before increasing 78% 
and 22%, respectively, from 2010-2018. Annual growth of pine pulpwood also held steady from 2004-
2010, averaging 10.7 million m3 per year over this period. However, pine pulpwood growth proceeded to 
decline 14% over the eight years that followed, falling to 9.2 million m3 in 2018.

6.1.5.1  Growth Rates & Per-Hectare Growth 
According to USFS data, average annual growth rates in the catchment area remained nearly unchanged 
from 2004-2018, holding between 6.0% and 6.3% per year over this period. Specifically, average annual 
growth rates of pine pulpwood, the primary timber product consumed by the bioenergy sector, held 
between 12.2% and 12.8% per year from 2004-2018. See Table 32 below for details. 
Furthermore, average per-hectare volume growth in the Georgia catchment area increased from 5.1 m3 
in 2004 to 5.9 m3 in 2018, with average per-hectare growth increasing for both pine sawtimber and pine 
chip-n-saw but decreasing slightly for pine pulpwood over this period (see Table 33). Ultimately, this 
information taken together is suggestive of two things: 1) the catchment area forest has become more 
productive and 2) the forest is in a state of transition where timber is moving up in product class (i.e. 
pulpwood is moving up to chip-n-saw and chip-n-saw is moving up to sawtimber).  
In general, growth rates decline as timber ages. So, the decrease in pine pulpwood growth rate and 
simultaneous increase in pine chip-n-saw growth rate suggests that pine pulpwood is moving up in 
classification to pine chip-n-saw. Pine pulpwood growth declines as it moves closer to chip-n-saw 
classification, and just the opposite occurs with pine chip-n-saw, as its growth rate increases due to the 
influx of younger timber into this new classification.

Growth Rates, Age Class, & Diameter Class 
As was noted on page 76, the decrease in pine pulpwood growth rate and subsequent increase in 
pine chip-n-saw growth rate since 2012 suggests that softwood forests in the catchment area are 
transitioning, with a significant portion of softwood inventory moving up in product class (from pine 
pulpwood to pine chip-n-saw). To demonstrate and help further explain this transition – including 
how this impacts growth rates – let’s look at a typical yield curve for a pine timber stand as well as the 
growth rate curve. 
Figure 42, below, shows softwood growing stock inventory in the catchment area by age class in 
2018, including an overlay of the yield curve for a typical pine timber stand. Looking at this figure, 
notice that the majority of softwood growing stock inventory is located along the yield curve in those 
age classes where gross volume increases at a rapid pace. Specifically, according to USFS data, 56% of 
softwood inventory is 11-35 years of age, or within those age classes where pine pulpwood 
transitions to pine chip-n-saw and pine chip-n-saw transitions to pine sawtimber.  
Going a bit further, Figure 43 on the following page shows softwood growing stock inventory in the 
catchment area by diameter class, including the corresponding growth rate associated with each 
respective diameter class. Also note that specific product classifications have been identified and are 
highlighted in this figure. What we want to draw your attention to is where the highest distributions 
are located within each highlighted product class. Specifically, a majority of pine pulpwood inventory 
(highlighted in green) is at the top end of its diameter class range (and the bottom end of its growth 
rate rage), whereas a majority of pine chip-n-saw inventory (highlighted in yellow) is at the bottom 
end of its diameter class range (and the top end of its growth rate range).

Ultimately, the decline in pine pulpwood growth rate and increase in pine chip-n-saw growth rate 
since 2012 (as shown in Table 32 on pg. 76) indicate that the catchment area forest has been in a 
state of transition. And as these figures show/illustrate, this transition – and the change in growth 
rates – can be explained and better understood if we consider the natural growth cycle of timber and 
how this cycle impacts timber growth rates.

Correlation Analysis:  Biomass Demand vs. Timber Growth 
Figure 44 provides a side-by-side comparison of softwood pulpwood demand (including softwood 
biomass demand) and annual pine pulpwood growth in the catchment area from 2004-2018. This figure 
shows that, since 2004, total softwood pulpwood demand in the catchment area has increased while pine 
pulpwood growth has declined. However, since 2011, pine pulpwood growth has declined at a more rapid 
pace, despite softwood pulpwood demand remaining nearly unchanged (actually decreasing from 2011-
2017). Ultimately, statistical analysis identified a weak negative correlation (correlation coefficient=-0.47) 
between these two variables from 2004-2018. Findings were also similar in comparing softwood biomass 
demand and pine pulpwood growth over this same period (correlation coefficient=-0.59). 
Intuitively, an inverse relationship is generally expected between demand and growth. However, we see 
that softwood pulpwood demand and pine pulpwood growth moved in the same direction from 2011-
2017, even though softwood biomass demand increased over this period. Ultimately, there is little 
evidence that softwood biomass demand was responsible for this decrease in pine pulpwood growth. 
Rather, evidence points towards reduced sawtimber harvest levels through the second half of the 2000s, 
which translated to less new stand reestablishment, reduced pine pulpwood inventory levels, and 
ultimately a reduction in pine pulpwood growth.

6.1.6  Changes in Annual Removals 
According to the US Forest Service, annual removals of growing stock timber held relatively consistent in 
the catchment area, averaging 17.8 million m3 per year from 2000-2017. However, in 2018, total 
removals increased to an estimated 21.1 million m3, up 16% from 2017 levels. 
Table 35 below provides a breakdown of annual removal estimates by major timber product in the 
Georgia catchment area from 2000 through 2018. Annual removals of pine sawtimber and pine chip-n-
saw (i.e. softwood sawlogs) steadily declined from a combined 9.3 million m3 in 2000 to 8.2 million m3 in 
2014. However, removals of softwood sawlogs have steadily increased since and in 2018 totaled 11.0 
million m3, which was up 35% compared to 2014 levels.  
Annual removals of pine pulpwood (the primary roundwood product consumed by the bioenergy sector) 
increased 41% from 5.2 million m3 in 2000 to 7.6 million m3 in 2011 but then proceeded to decline an 
average of 2.3% per year (-13% total) to 6.6 million m3 in 2017. However, pine pulpwood removals 
increased to 8.7 million m3 in 2018, a year-over-year increase of 31%. (Note that the increase in pine 
pulpwood removals in 2018 was due to Hurricane Michael, a category 5 hurricane that hit the Florida 
Panhandle, causing damage to an estimated 2.1 million hectares of timberland, including 100 million 
metric tons of timber, in Florida and Georgia).

6.1.6.1  Growth-to-Removals Ratios 
Growth-to-removals analysis compares annual timber growth to annual harvests and provides a measure 
of market demand relative to supply. A growth-to-removals ratio of 1.0 indicates a balanced market 
where growth equals removals. A value of >1 indicates growth exceeds removals, signifying sustainable 
harvest levels (as well as oversupply). A value of <1 indicates removals (or harvest levels) exceed growth, 
signifying more highly competitive market conditions and harvest levels that are unsustainable over the 
long term. 
According to US Forest Service data, the growth-to-removals (G:R) ratio for pine pulpwood, the primary 
bioenergy feedstock, remained well above 1.0 in the catchment area from 2004-2017, indicating that 
harvest levels remained well below the sustainable yield capacity of the forest area over this period. 
Specifically, the pine pulpwood G:R ratio equaled nearly 2.0 in 2004, steadily declining over the seven 
years that followed but leveling out and averaging 1.43 from 2011-2017. However, as a result of the 
removals/salvage wood brought about by Hurricane Michael, the pine pulpwood G:R ratio fell to 1.06 in 
2018. 
Unsustainable harvest levels persisted in the catchment area for both pine (and hardwood) sawtimber 
through the 2000s. However, reduced harvest levels in the late 2000s through early 2010s (due to market 
conditions brough about by the Great Recession) allowed inventories to replenish, and since 2013, pine 
sawtimber markets have remained balanced – with harvest levels roughly equal to (slightly below) the 
sustainable yield capacity of the forest area.

Drax – September 2020 
Figure 47, below, shows growth-to-removals ratios in the catchment area for the major timber products 
from 2004-2018. As this figure shows (and was noted on the previous page), the pine pulpwood G:R ratio 
steadily declined from 2004-2011. Note that this decline was linked to a combination of reduced pine 
pulpwood growth and increased pine pulpwood removals.  
Specifically, the decrease in pine pulpwood growth coincided with reduced harvests of pine sawtimber, 
which resulted in a reduction in new reestablished pine stands, leading to reduced pine pulpwood 
inventory levels and ultimately reduced pine pulpwood growth. Furthermore, the increase in pine 
pulpwood removals can also be linked to reduced pine sawtimber production levels in the mid to late-
2000s. Specifically, reduced pine sawtimber production resulted in a reduction of sawmill residuals (which 
are utilized by both the pulp/paper industry and bioenergy industry), which in turn led to an increase in 
pine pulpwood removals (to account for the loss of sawmill residues).  
However, pine sawtimber production started to increase beginning in the early 2010s, resulting in an 
increase in sawmill residuals, and, as a result, pine pulpwood removals also begun to decrease. This 
ultimately resulted in the pine pulpwood G:R ratio leveling off and holding steady between 1.40 and 1.45 
from 2011-2017. The pine pulpwood G:R ratio declined substantially in 2018. However, as was previously 
noted, this decrease can be attributed to Hurricane Michael and the 31% year-over-year increase in pine 
pulpwood removals – which can be linked to this storm (salvage wood).

Correlation Analysis:  Biomass Demand vs. Timber Removals 
Figure 48 provides a side-by-side comparison of biomass demand and total pulpwood demand versus 
pulpwood removals in the catchment area from 2000-2018. Since pulpwood removals, in general, should 
be representative of pulpwood demand, we’d expected these two to be very strongly (positively) 
correlated, and that’s exactly what we see in Figure 48. Statistical analysis confirms this relationship, 
identifying a strong positive correlation between softwood pulpwood demand and pine pulpwood 
removals (correlation coefficient=0.94) as well as between hardwood pulpwood demand and hardwood 
pulpwood removals (correlation coefficient=0.96) in the catchment area over this period. 
Looking specifically at Figure 48(b), we also see that softwood biomass demand appears to loosely track 
pine pulpwood removals, particularly since around 2012. However, only a weak positive relationship was 
found between these two variables from 2008-2018 (correlation coefficient=0.47). Ultimately, softwood 
biomass demand, which accounts for only 10-15% of total softwood pulpwood demand, has had an 
impact on the total level of pine pulpwood removals in the Georgia catchment area. However, demand 
from other sources (i.e. pulp/paper) is the primary driver of pine pulpwood removals in the Georgia 
catchment area.

6.1.7  Changes in Raw Material Costs 
Historically, raw material purchases by Georgia Biomass and the Fram include a combination of pulpwood 
(roundwood), pulp quality chips, and sawmill residuals. However, in this section, pine and hardwood 
sawtimber prices are also examined to assess how these prices have changed and trended in the 
catchment area since 2000.  
Note that all prices have been provided by TimberMart-South and, unless otherwise stated, are specific to 
the Georgia catchment area. Also, historic quarterly raw material prices are provided in tabular form in 
Appendix A. 
 
6.1.7.1  Stumpage Prices 
Trends/changes with nominal stumpage prices in the catchment area since 2000 are as follows: 
 Pine Sawtimber Stumpage. Pine sawtimber (PST) stumpage prices held relatively steady and 
averaged $46.33 per ton from 1Q 2000-1Q 2007. However, PST stumpage prices proceeded to 
decline more than 45% over the six years that followed, bottoming out at $25.18 per ton in 4Q 
2012. Prices rebounded a bit but since 2013 have held more-or-less flat and averaged $29.95 per 
ton, down 35% from the 1Q 2000-1Q 2007 average of more than $46 per ton.  
 Pine Chip-n-saw Stumpage. Pine chip-n-saw (CNS) stumpage prices in the Georgia catchment area 
held steady and averaged $28.10 per ton from 2001-2006 before declining 45% over the three 
years that followed – to $ 15.36 per ton in 4Q 2009. CNS stumpage prices remained between 
$15-18 per ton from 4Q 2009-4Q 2012, rebounding to over $23 per ton in 3Q 2014. However, 
since 3Q 2014, CNS prices have held flat and averaged $23.65 per ton, down 16% from the 2001-
2006 average of more than $28 per ton.  
 Pine Pulpwood Stumpage. Pine pulpwood (PPW) stumpage prices declined from over $11 per ton 
in 1Q 2000 to roughly $6 per ton in 1Q 2003. However, PPW prices nearly tripled over the 10 
years that followed, increasing an average of 10% per year to over $17 per ton in 3Q 2013. Prices 
have since leveled off, averaging $17.03 per ton from 3Q 2013 – 1Q 2020.   
 Hardwood Sawtimber Stumpage. Hardwood sawtimber (HST) stumpage prices steadily increased 
from an average of roughly $18.50 per ton in 2000 to over $30 per ton in 2008 (+6.6% per year 
average). However, since 2008, HST stumpage prices have held steady (declined slightly) and 
averaged approximately $28.50 per ton in the Georgia catchment area.  
 Hardwood Pulpwood Stumpage. Hardwood pulpwood (HPW) stumpage prices, although somewhat 
volatile, trended overall flat and averaged $8.28 per ton from 1Q 2000-1Q 2012 before increasing 
to over $13.50 per ton in 4Q 2013. However, HPW prices have steadily declined since, falling to 
below $8 per ton in 1Q 2020.  
 
See Figures 49 and 50 for nominal and real quarterly average pine sawtimber, pine chip-n-saw, pine 
pulpwood, hardwood sawtimber, and hardwood pulpwood stumpage prices in the Georgia catchment 
area from 1Q 2000 – 1Q 2020. Corresponding prices are provided in tabular form in Appendix A.

5.1.7.2  Delivered Timber Prices 
Delivered prices are those paid for timber delivered to the mill. These prices include stumpage (standing 
timber) price plus any costs associated with cutting, loading, and hauling timber to the mill.  
Trends/changes with nominal delivered sawtimber prices in the catchment area since 2000 are as follows: 
 Delivered Pine Sawtimber. Delivered pine sawtimber (PST) prices experienced a bit of volatility 
from 2000-2007 but overall trended flat and averaged more than $57 per ton over this period. 
However, prices fell 30% over the two years that followed, bottoming out at $40.53 per ton in 4Q 
2009. Delivered PST prices proceeded to rebound to nearly $53 per ton in 2Q 2013 but since then 
have trended downward, decreasing an average of 2.5% per year and falling to $44.86 per ton in 
1Q 2020.  
 Delivered Pine Chip-n-saw. Delivered pine chip-n-saw (CNS) prices also experienced some volatility 
in the early to mid-2000s but ultimately averaged over $40 per ton from 2000-2006. Prices 
proceeded to decline 30% over the next several years, bottoming out at below $29 per ton in 4Q 
2009. However, delivered CNS prices steadily increased over the five years that followed and 
since 4Q 2014 have averaged over $40 per ton.  
 Delivered Pine Pulpwood. Delivered pine pulpwood (PPW) prices declined slightly in the early 
2000s, falling 14% from $24.48 per ton in 1Q 2000 to $21.79 per ton in 1Q 2002. Prices 
proceeded to increase an average 3.8% per year (+74% total) over the next 14 years, to $37.81 
per ton in 3Q 2016. However, delivered PPW prices have since declined approximately 16%, 
falling to $31.78 per ton in 1Q 2020.  
 Delivered Hardwood Sawtimber. Delivered hardwood sawtimber (HST) prices have been on a 
steady upward trajectory since 2000. Specifically, delivered HST prices have increased an average 
of 3.0% per year from $26.60 per ton in 1Q 2000 to $48.45 per ton in 1Q 2020.  
 Delivered Hardwood Pulpwood. Delivered hardwood pulpwood (HPW) prices, although a bit 
volatile, increased at an average rate of 3.3% per year (+59% total) from $20.94 in 1Q 2000 to 
$33.23 per ton in 2Q 2014. However, prices have since leveled out and averaged $31.46 per ton 
from 2Q 2014 – 1Q 2020.  
 
See Figures 51 and 52 for nominal and real quarterly average pine sawtimber, pine chip-n-saw, pine 
pulpwood, hardwood sawtimber, and hardwood pulpwood delivered prices in the Georgia catchment

5.1.7.3  Pulp Quality Chip & Sawmill Residual Prices 
Pulpwood quality chips (FOB point of production) include both pine and hardwood sawmill chips (sawmill 
residuals) and pine and hardwood chip mill chips. Trends/changes with nominal chip and sawmill residual 
prices since 2000 are as follows: 
 Pine Sawmill Chips (Sawmill Residuals). Pine sawmill chip prices held steady and averaged 
approximately $20 per ton from 1Q 2000 – 3Q 2004 before increasing an average of 4.1% per 
year (+58% total) to $31.55 per ton in 4Q 2015. Prices have since come down slightly but since 
2016 have averaged $29.45 per ton.  
 Pine Chip Mill Chips. Pine chip mill chip prices averaged approximately $26 per ton from 1Q 2000 
– 3Q 2004 before increasing an average of 4.3% per year (+51% total) to $39.10 per ton in 1Q 
2014. Prices proceeded to stabilize and average $38.90 per ton over the five years that followed. 
However, since 1Q 2019, pine chip mill chip prices have declined more than 20%, falling to 
$31.28 per ton in 1Q 2020.  
 Hardwood Sawmill Chips (Sawmill Residuals). Prices for hardwood sawmill chips held steady and 
averaged $16.60 per ton from 1Q 2000 – 2Q 2002. However, prices have steadily increased an 
average of 2.9% per year (+67% total) to $27.74 per ton in 1Q 2020.  
 Hardwood Chip Mill Chips. Hardwood chip mill chip prices increased from $23.50 per ton in 1Q 
2000 to $38.75 per ton in 4Q 2010, or a 65% increased (+4.7% per year average) over this period. 
However, prices have since trended flat, averaging just below $37 per ton from 4Q 2010 – 1Q 
2020.  
In addition, we’d like to note that chip mill chip prices have historically remained above sawmill 
chip prices, with pine and hardwood chip mill chip prices averaging a 31% and 47% premium, 
respectively, over pine and hardwood sawmill chip prices since 2000.  
See Figure 53 for nominal and real quarterly average prices for pine sawmill chips, pine chip mill 
chips, hardwood sawmill chips, and hardwood chip mill chips in the Georgia catchment area from 
1Q 2000 – 1Q 2020. Corresponding prices are provided in tabular form in Appendix A.

Correlation Analysis:  Biomass Demand vs. Raw Material Costs 
Historically, raw material purchases at Georgia Biomass and the Fram pellet mills have included a 
combination of predominantly softwood pulpwood (roundwood), pulp quality chips, and sawmill 
residuals. Specifically, softwood roundwood and residuals have constituted 86% of all raw materials 
consumed by these mills since 2012, compared to 14% for hardwood roundwood and residuals. 
Figure 54 provides a side-by-side comparison of softwood biomass demand and total softwood pulpwood 
demand versus delivered pine pulpwood, pine sawmill chip, and pine chip mill chip prices in the 
catchment area from 2000-2019. Intuitively, we’d expect to see prices and demand moving in the same 
direction, and that’s what this figure shows. Specifically, correlation analysis identified strong positive 
relationships between softwood pulpwood demand and each of these three pine raw material prices (see 
Table 39 on pg. 102). The same strong positive correlations were also found between softwood biomass 
demand and these raw material prices. 
We’d like to point out that the bioenergy sector has likely had a larger impact on pine chip and pine 
residual prices in the Georgia catchment area. Specifically, total pine chip and pine residual purchases by 
Georgia Biomass and Fram have totaled more than 0.9 million metric tons annually since 2016, and the 
increase in demand for chips and other residuals appears to have resulted in an upward shift in the price 
levels of these raw materials.

Hardwood Pulpwood & Hardwood Chip Prices 
Figure 55 provides a side-by-side comparison of hardwood pulpwood demand and hardwood raw 
material prices in the catchment area since 2000. Looking at this figure, hardwood raw material costs 
have steadily increased since 2000. while demand for hardwood pulpwood has declined (but holding 
relatively level since 2012). Ultimately, statistical analysis identified strong negative correlations between 
hardwood pulpwood demand and hardwood raw material costs from 2000-2019 (see Table 40 on pg. 
102). However, delivered hardwood pulpwood and hardwood sawmill chip prices were both found to 
have a moderately strong positive correlation to hardwood biomass demand over this period. 
These moderately strong positive correlations do not provide enough evidence to suggest that increased 
hardwood pulpwood demand attributed to bioenergy is largely responsible for increased hardwood 
pulpwood and hardwood chip prices in the catchment area. While it is completely plausible that 
increased demand attributed to bioenergy has impacted these hardwood raw material prices, ultimately, 
hardwood biomass demand accounts for only a small proportion (10-20%) of total hardwood pulpwood 
demand in the Georgia catchment area.

Sawtimber Prices 
Pine and hardwood sawtimber prices were also examined to assess the impact biomass demand has had 
on markets for other solid wood products. Specifically, Figure 56 provides a side-by-side comparison of 
biomass demand versus delivered pine sawtimber, pine chip-n-saw, and hardwood sawtimber prices in 
the catchment area from 2000-2019.  
Looking at this figure, prices of all three of these sawtimber products have generally followed total 
biomass demand since 2008. Correlation analysis confirms this – identifying moderately strong positive 
relationships between biomass and sawtimber prices from 2008-2019 (see Table 41 on pg. 102). 
However, note that these common trends appear to be more coincidental in nature, and there is little 
evidence to suggest that increases in biomass-related wood demand has caused these changes.

Drax – September 2020 
Changes in delivered pine sawlog prices, historically, have been largely driven by changes in softwood 
sawlog demand (see Figure 57 on the previous page). Specifically, strong positive correlations existed 
between softwood sawlog demand and both delivered pine sawtimber price (correlation 
coefficient=0.93) and delivered pine chip-n-saw price (correlation coefficient=0.88) from 2000-2014. 
However, we’d like to note that this relationship has fallen apart since 2014 – as delivered pine sawtimber 
and chip-n-saw prices have generally held flat despite demand for softwood sawlogs continuing to 
increase. 
Specifically, softwood sawlog demand in the Georgia catchment area averaged 8.6 million metric tons per 
year from 2000-2007, falling to an average of less than 8.0 million metric tons per year from 2008-2014. 
This reduction in softwood sawlog demand allowed inventory levels to increase, which ultimately altered 
the balance of supply and demand in this market. As a result of this imbalance, delivered pine sawtimber 
and chip-n-saw prices have not responded to increases in softwood sawlog demand the last 5-7 years. 
Specifically, a strong negative relationship has existed between softwood sawlog demand and delivered 
pine sawtimber prices (correlation coefficient=-0.86) in the catchment area since 2014.

5.2  Market Outlook: 2020-2022 
There have been several announcements related to mill openings and closings in the Georgia catchment 
area that stand to impact this market moving forward. These include: 
 Enviva announced in 2Q 2020 that the expansion project at its Greenwood SC pellet facility remain 
underway, with completion expected by yearend. The expansion project, once complete, will increase 
annual production capacity from 550,000 to 660,000 metric tons of wood pellets. However, given the 
facility’s location, no additional roundwood demand is expected to be place on the Georgia catchment area 
following the expansion.  
Separately, Enviva announced in June that the company had reached an agreement to acquire the Georgia 
Biomass pellet mill in Waycross GA. The change in ownership is not expected to impact roundwood 
demand attributed to this mill in the near term.  
 Georgia-Pacific (GP) announced in 2Q 2020 that it had increased tissue production at its mill in Palatka FL. 
Separately, GP also announced market-related production curtailments at both its Cedar Springs GA and 
Perry FL pulp mills. The Palatka (Putnam County FL) and Perry (Taylor County FL) mills are located 
approximately 150-160 kilometers south/southwest of Georgia Biomass. The Cedar Springs mill is located 
approximately 240 kilometers north of Georgia Biomass in Early County GA.  
GP also announced in 4Q19 the startup of its new sawmill in Warrenton GA. The mill has a production 
capacity of 350 million bf of lumber per year. In addition, GP announced in March 2020 that its new sawmill 
in Dougherty County GA was almost fully operational. The $150 million facility has an annual production 
capacity of 300 million bf and is expected to startup in the second half of 2020.  
Based on these announcements and given the locations of these various facilities, we estimate a net 
reduction of 25,000-45,000 metric tons of roundwood (pulpwood) demand in the Georgia catchment area 
in 2020, but a net increase of 35,000-55,000 metric tons of roundwood demand in 2021 and 2022.     
 Interfor announced in 3Q 2019 it had completed the Phase I project at its Meldrim GA sawmill, increasing 
annual production capacity to 135 million board feet (bf). The company also announced in May 2020 
modifications to its previously-announced $240 million Phase II strategic capital, including the 
postponement of the sawmill operation rebuild at its Thomaston GA sawmill and deferral of the sawmill 
portion of the rebuild at its Eatonton GA mill (completion now planned for 2022). 
The increase in production associated with these upgrade projects is expected to add an estimated 45,000-
55,000 metric tons per year of additional roundwood demand on the Georgia catchment area by 2022.  
 Klausner ceased lumber production at its Klausner Lumber One sawmill in Live Oak FL in mid-March 2020. 
The company has announced it has no plans to restart the mill, which is currently for sale. The shutdown of 
the Klausner mill is expected to reduce roundwood demand in the Georgia catchment area by an estimated 
345,000-380,000 metric tons in 2020, and an additional 70,000-90,000 metric tons in 2021 and 2022 
should the mill remain shut down.   
 Resolute Forest Products announced in 4Q 2019 the closure of its newsprint mill in Augusta GA. The mill, 
located approximately 190 kilometers north of Georgia Biomass in Richmond County, had a production 
capacity of 197,000 metric tons annually. Given the facility’s location, the shutdown is expected to reduce 
roundwood demand in the catchment area by 90,000-115,000 metric tons annually beginning in 2020.  
 West Fraser announced in early 2020 plans to build a new sawmill at its existing facility in Dudley GA, with 
startup planned for mid-2021. The new mill will increase site capacity from 100 to 250 million bf per year. 
The increase in production associated with this new replacement mill is expected to add an estimated 
165,000-180,000 metric tons per year of additional roundwood demand on the catchment area by 2022.

5.2.1  Wood Demand Outlook 
Based on the announcements highlighted on the previous page and other expected production changes, 
we anticipate total wood demand in the Georgia catchment area to decrease an estimated 4.0% from 
2019 to 2020, due in large part to COVID-19 and its impact on general market conditions. However, we 
project wood demand to increase an average of 0.5% per year the following two years, to an estimated 
22.9 million metric tons in 2022.  
Demand for softwood and hardwood sawlogs is forecasted to decrease a combined 2.1% in 2020 but 
increase 0.3% from 2020-2022. Combined softwood and hardwood pulpwood demand is also forecasted 
to decline in 2020 (-6.0% Y/Y), followed by a 1.8% increase from 2020-2022.

5.2.2  Raw Material Price Outlook 
Historically, raw material purchases for Georgia Biomass and Fram have predominantly included a mix of 
pine pulpwood (roundwood), pine chips, and pine sawmill residuals. Specifically, pine pulpwood 
constituted 42% of the total raw material purchases for these mills in 2019, with pine chips and 
secondary pine residuals accounting for an additional 42% of total purchases (84% total). Hardwood 
pulpwood, hardwood chips, and secondary hardwood residuals accounted for the remaining 16%.  
Given that pine pulpwood and pine chips constitute an overwhelming majority of the raw materials 
purchased by these mills, and that these specific raw materials are expected to account for a majority of 
the raw materials purchased by these mills over the next several years, our price forecasts focus 
specifically on these products.  
Delivered pine pulpwood, pine sawmill chips, and pine chip mill chip price forecasts area as follows: 
 Delivered Pine Pulpwood. Based on our analysis of raw material prices in the catchment area, 
including anticipated changes in biomass demand and total softwood pulpwood demand moving 
forward, we forecast a 4.2% decrease in delivered pine pulpwood (PPW) price from 2019 through 
2022. Specifically, delivered PPW price is forecasted to fall 5.8% Y/Y in 2020 due to market conditions 
brought about by COVID-19. However, prices are forecasted to improve in 2021 and hold steady in 
2022. Overall, delivered PPW prices are forecasted to average $32.10 per ton from 2020-2022, down 
4.6% (-$1.537 per ton) from the 2019 average of $33.63 per ton. 
 Pine Sawmill Chips. Pine sawmill chip prices are forecasted to decrease 3.9% from $29.47 per ton in 
2019 to $28.32 per ton in 2020. However, we anticipate a modest increase in sawmill chip price in 
2021, and for prices to hold steady and average $28.46 per ton in 2022. Overall, pine sawmill chip 
prices are forecasted to average $28.56 per ton from 2020-2022, down 3.1% (-$0.91 per ton) from the 
2019 average. 
 Pine Chip Mill Chips. As with pine pulpwood and pine sawmill chips, pine chip mill chip prices are 
also forecasted to fall in 2020 due to market conditions brought on by the COVID-19 pandemic. 
Specifically, chip mill chip prices are forecasted to fall 5.5% from $37.28 per ton in 2019 to $35.81 per 
ton in 2020. However, we anticipate a 1.6% increase in pine chip mill chip prices over the two years 
that follow, to $35.81 per ton in 2022. Overall, pine chip mill chip prices are forecasted to average 
$35.66 per ton from 2020-2022, down 4.3% (-$1.62 per ton) from the 2019 average.

Table 46 provides a cost index (2019=100) of historic and forecasted per-unit pine raw material costs for 
the Georgia Biomass and Fram pellet mills from 2012 through 2022. These index values are based on the 
actual distribution of pine pulpwood, pine sawmill chips, and pine chip mill chips purchases by Georgia 
Biomass and Fram, as well as respective product prices, and are intended to show how average per-unit 
raw material costs have changed and are projected to change for these pellet mills over the next several 
years. Note that these index calculations are not based on actual raw material costs incurred by either 
Georgia Biomass or Fram, but rather based on average market prices in the Georgia catchment area.  
Average per-unit pine costs for pellet mills in the Georgia catchment area increased an estimated 22% 
from 2012-2017, or an average of 4.0% per year over this period. However, from 2017-2019, average per-
unit costs declined 8%. Based on our forecasts and anticipated changes in product mix consumption, 
average per-unit pine raw material costs are projected to continue to decline in the Georgia catchment 
area, with the 2020-2022 average down 4.5% compared to 2019 levels.

6. Analysis Summary & Findings 
Provided below and on the following pages is Hood Consulting’s overall analysis summary, including a 
synopsis of key report elements and analysis findings. Please note that any conclusions drawn by Hood 
Consulting are based on a thorough assessment of the Georgia catchment area and on our professional 
expertise and market knowledge. 
 
 Changes in Forest Area 
According to the US Forest Service (USFS), the total area of timberland in the Georgia catchment 
area experienced a net decrease of 135,195 hectares (-3.3%) from 2000-2018, the latest 
available, decreasing from 4,130,223 to 3,995,028 hectares over this 18-year period. However, 
much of this decrease took place post-2011. Specifically, total timberland area held relatively 
steady (decreasing slightly) through the 2000s, averaging roughly 4,111,000 hectares from 2000-
2011. However, from 2011-2018, total Georgia catchment area timberland declined an estimated 
115,827 hectares, or a 2.8% decrease over this period. (Note that the loss in timberland since 
2011 coincided with a roughly 8,800-hectare increase in agricultural land and a roughly 93,000-
hectare increase in urban land and land classified as having other uses. This loss was also due to 
some land reclassification, as forestland not classified as timberland increased roughly 13,900 
hectares from 2011-2018.)  
The composition of timberland in the catchment area has also undergone changes. Specifically, 
natural and planted hardwood timberland decreased a combined 155,894 hectares (-9.9%) from 
2000-2018, the majority of which occurred from 2000-2009. However, planted pine timberland 
(the predominant supplier of pine pulpwood consumed by the pulp/paper and bioenergy 
industries in this market) increased an estimated 51,195 hectares (+3.3%) from 2000-2018. This 
increase in planted pine timberland coincided with a simultaneous 52,490-hectare decrease in 
natural pine timberland – suggesting that much of the natural pine timberland that was lost 
during this period was converted to more productive planted pine.  
Ultimately, combined planted and natural pine timberland (the predominant supplier of pine 
pulpwood in this market) has remained nearly unchanged in the catchment area since 2000 and 
been able to provide more than adequate supply to both the pulp/paper and bioenergy 
industries. Given that demand for pine pulpwood from the pulp/paper industry – bioenergy’s 
primary roundwood competitor – has steadily declined since 2011 and that no substantial 
increases in demand are expected from Georgia Biomass or Fram over the next several years, 
adequate wood supply is expected to remain in the Georgia catchment area (at least over the 
short to mid-term).

 Changes in Timber Inventory, Growth, & Removals 
According to USFS estimates, total growing stock inventory on timberland in the Georgia 
catchment area increased 19% from 328 million m3 in 2000 to 391 million m3 in 2018, or a net 
increase of over 63 million m3 over this period. However, from 2008-2018, inventories of pine 
pulpwood, specifically, declined an estimated 14 million m3 (-16%). Note that this decrease in 
pine pulpwood inventory was matched by a simultaneously 13 million m3 increase in pine chip-n-
saw inventory. This, along with observed changes in diameter class distribution since 2008, 
provide evidence of a catchment area forest that is not only aging but also in a state of transition, 
with pine pulpwood inventory moving up in product class to pine chip-n-saw. 
The increase in total timber inventory reflected both trends in growth and removals in the 
catchment area, as total annual timber growth has outpaced total annual removals every year 
since 2004 – the first year that growth estimates were made available by the USFS. Specifically, 
total annual growth of growing stock timber increased 13% (+0.9% per year average) from 20.9 
million m3 in 2004 to 23.6 million m3 in 2018. In comparison, total annual removals increased 19% 
(+1.3% per year average) over this same period, increasing from 18.0 million m3 in 2004 to 21.1 
million m3 in 2018. However, much of this increase occurred in 2018 – due to Hurricane Michael, 
a Category 5 hurricane that hit the Florida Panhandle and traveled inland and through parts of 
the Georgia catchment area, causing significant damage to timberland along its path. Note that 
from 2004-2017, total annual timber removals increased an average of only 0.2% per year. 
The decrease in pine pulpwood inventory since 2008 is less a reflection of growth and removal 
trends and more one of a forest in transition. Specifically, annual growth and removals of pine 
pulpwood decreased 10% and 13%, respectively, in the catchment area from 2011-2017. 
Typically, when growth exceeds removals, oversupply persists and inventory increases. However, 
in this case, pine pulpwood inventory declined. In the Georgia catchment area, removals of pine 
sawtimber declined 24% from 2005-2014 (due to the bursting of the US housing bubble and 
Great Recession that followed), and with the reduced harvest levels also came a reduction in 
newly-reestablished timber stands – the source of pine pulpwood. So, with less replantings 
occurring during this period, inventories of pine pulpwood were not replenished to the same 
degree they had been previously, and therefore this catchment area saw a reduction in pine 
pulpwood inventory levels. 
In terms of long-term resource availability and market sustainability, in the Georgia catchment 
area, the ratio of total growth to total removals has remained above 1.0 since 2004. (Recall that a 
value of >1 indicates growth exceeds removals, signifying oversupply and sustainable harvest 
levels). The growth-to-removals ratio of pine pulpwood, specifically, held very consistent and 
averaged 1.44 from 2012-2017. However, that radio dropped significantly in 2018 (to 1.06) due 
to the substantial amount of salvage wood created by Hurricane Michael.  
Overall, the impact of Hurricane Michael will likely be felt for several years, as this major storm 
cause some severe damage to parts of the Georgia catchment area. However, pine pulpwood 
inventory levels are expected to increase over the mid-to-long term as a result of increased pine 
sawtimber demand/production since 2012 (i.e. increased harvests of pine sawtimber have 
resulted in new replantings, which in turn will lead to increased inventories of pine pulpwood).

 Changes in Wood Demand 
Total wood demand in the Georgia catchment area increased an average of 2.0% per year (+19% 
total) from 2010 – the year prior to Georgia Biomass’ startup – through 2019. Specifically, 
demand for softwood sawlogs and softwood pulpwood, which, combined, accounts for over 90% 
of total wood demand in the catchment area, increased 42% and 8%, respectively, over this 
period. The increase in softwood sawlog demand was due in large part to improved market 
conditions coming off the heels of the Great Recession. However, the increase in softwood 
pulpwood demand was largely attributed to increased demand from bioenergy (from Georgia 
Biomass and Fram).  
Specifically, biomass-related softwood (pine) pulpwood demand increased from less than 19,000 
metric tons in 2010 to over 1.3 million metric tons in 2012. Softwood biomass demand remained 
between 1.3 and 1.5 million metric tons per year from 2013-2015 but declined nearly 20% (to 
less than 1.2 million metric tons) in 2016 with the shutdown of E-Pellets’ Nahunta GA pellet mill. 
Softwood biomass demand held between 1.0 and 1.2 million metric tons per year from 2016-
2018 before increasing to nearly 1.4 million metric tons in 2019 – following Fram’s purchase and 
restart of the former E-Pellets mill. Overall, the nearly 1.4 million metric ton increase in softwood 
pulpwood demand attributed to Georgia Biomass and Fram resulted in biomass-related pine 
pulpwood demand increasing from less than 0.5% of total catchment area pine pulpwood 
demand in 2010 to 13% of total pine pulpwood demand in 2019. Also worth noting is that non-
biomass-related pine pulpwood demand decreased an estimated 5% from 9.7 million metric tons 
in 2010 to 9.2 million metric tons in 2019.  
In terms of the short-term outlook, total pine pulpwood demand is projected to decrease 7% Y/Y 
in the Georgia catchment area in 2020 – back in line with pre-Hurricane Michael demand levels – 
but stabilize and average 10.1 million metric tons per year in 2021 and 2022. (Note that the 
impact of COVID-19 on production is also reflected in the decrease in demand in 2020). 
Specifically, softwood biomass demand is forecasted to decrease 2% from 2019-2022, compared 
to a 5% decrease in non-biomass-related softwood pulpwood demand over this same period. 
Ultimately, the anticipated decrease in total catchment area pine pulpwood demand the next 
several years is expected to result in reduced roundwood costs for Georgia Biomass and Fram 
Renewable Fuels. 
 
 Changes in Raw Material Prices 
Raw material purchases for Georgia Biomass and the Fram pellet mills include a combination of 
roundwood, chips, and secondary wood residues. Specifically, pine pulpwood (roundwood) has 
accounted for 53% of total raw material purchases by these pellet mills since 2011, compared to 
13% pine sawmill/chip mill/in-woods chips and 19% other secondary pine residuals (hardwood 
roundwood, chips, and secondary residuals have accounted for the remaining 14%). 
In the Georgia catchment area, the price of delivered pine pulpwood increased from $29.44 per 
ton in 2010 (the year prior to Georgia Biomass’ startup) to $36.63 per ton in 2017, or a 24% 
increase over this 7-year period. However, delivered pine pulpwood prices have declined 13% 
since 2017, falling to below $32 per ton in 1Q 2020. Note that this decrease in price was largely 
due to oversupply from salvage wood created by Hurricane Michael. Ultimately, delivered pine

Drax – September 2020 
pulpwood price increased 14% in the catchment area from 2010-2019, which coincided with an 
8% increase in total pine pulpwood demand over this same period.  
Pine sawmill chip prices held steady and averaged approximately $26 per ton in the Georgia 
catchment area from 2008-2012. However, prices increased more than 15% over the three years 
that followed, to $29.84 per ton in 2015. Pine sawmill chip prices have held steady since, 
averaging $29.53 per ton from 2015-2019. Pine chip mill chip prices followed a similar trend, 
increasing 7% from $36.67 per ton in 2012 to $39.12 per ton in 2015, but holding steady and 
averaging roughly $38.50 per ton since 2015. Note that the respective 15% and 7% increase in 
pine sawmill and pine chip mill chip prices from 2012-2015 coincided with a more than 200,000-
ton increase in pine chip purchases by Georgia Biomass and Fram over this period.  
The outlook for Georgia Biomass and Fram in terms of raw material costs is positive in the short 
term, with prices for all these three different pine products forecasted to decline slightly over the 
next several years. Specifically, delivered pine pulpwood, pine sawmill chips, and pine chip mill 
chips prices are all forecasted to decrease 3-4% in the catchment area from 2019-2022.  
 
 Management/Harvest Trends 
As part of this market analysis, Hood Consulting examined management practices to see how 
harvesting activities have changed in this market since 2000. Specifically, we wanted to assess 
whether landowners’ approach to timber management changed with changing market conditions 
in this catchment area.  
Clearcuts and thinnings are the two major types of harvests that occur in the region, both of 
which are long-standing, widely used methods of harvesting timber. TimberMart-South (TMS) 
data shows that thinnings accounted for 67% of total reported harvest area in the southeast 
Georgia market from 2000-2010, but only 43% of total reported harvest area from 2012-2019. 
Specifically, this downward shift was initiated by the bursting of the US housing bubble in the 
mid-2000s and had been completed by the early 2010s. We’d like to note that this shift coincided 
with a nearly 50% decrease in pine sawtimber stumpage prices from 2006-2012. This is important 
because the strength of pine sawtimber markets was a driving force behind timber management 
decisions in this region in the early and mid-2000s. 
Also, contributing to the decreased prevalence of thinnings was the strengthening of pine 
pulpwood markets in the mid-2000s, as pine pulpwood stumpage prices increased more than 
40% in the Georgia catchment area from 2003-2008. So, with sawtimber markets deteriorating 
rapidly and pulpwood markets doing just the opposite, many landowners decided to alter their 
management approach (to take advantage of strong pulpwood markets) and focus on short 
pulpwood rotations that typically do not utilize thinnings. 
Ultimately, our assessment shows the shift in management approach that occurred in this market 
was due to the weakening of one type of timber market and the strengthening of another. In the 
early and mid-2000s, timber management was focused on sawtimber production – a type of 
management that utilizes thinnings. However, for more than a decade now, this market has been 
driven to a large degree by the pulp/paper industry, with a significant portion of the timber 
management in this area focused on short pulpwood rotations.

 Impact of Biomass Demand on Raw Material Prices 
One of the important components of this analysis was to identify any relationships or linkages 
between changes in biomass demand and changes in raw material prices. Intuitively, an increase 
in demand should result in an increase in price, and this is what the data shows occurred in the 
Georgia catchment area as it relates to increased biomass demand from Georgia Biomass and 
Fram and changes in price of the various raw materials consumed by these mills.  
Specifically, the 1.4 million metric tons of combined softwood pulpwood demand added by 
Georgia Biomass and Fram coincided with a 20% increase in delivered pine pulpwood price and a 
10-15% increase in pine chip prices from 2011-2015. The apparent link between increased 
bioenergy demand and increased pine raw material prices was further supported by statistical 
analysis, as strong positive correlations were found between softwood biomass demand and both 
delivered pine pulpwood and pine chip prices. However, delivered pine pulpwood and pine chip 
prices were also found to have moderate-to-strong positive correlations to non-biomass-related 
pine pulpwood demand as well – suggesting that changes in these raw material prices are linked 
to changes in total softwood pulpwood demand (from both bioenergy and from other sources).  
Additionally, prices of non-biomass-related timber products (i.e. pine sawtimber, pine chip-n-saw, 
and hardwood sawtimber) were also examined, and our assessment found no relationships or 
links between changes in biomass demand and changes in these raw material prices.

Annex 1.  Test Analysis - Pine Pulpwood Stumpage Prices: 
Coastal vs. Interior Region 
 
As was noted in the Georgia catchment area analysis report, the eastern portion of this catchment area 
along the Atlantic Coast contains a high concentration of pulp/paper mills. Specifically, there are seven 
pine pulpwood-consuming pulp/paper mills located along the Atlantic Coast between Jacksonville FL and 
Savannah GA, which together consume an estimated 6-8 million tons of roundwood (pine pulpwood) 
annually. As a result of this high level of mill concentration, and with the Atlantic Ocean serving as a 
barrier to the east, competition amongst these pulp/paper mills for pulpwood is inherently high in the 
eastern portion of the Georgia catchment area. 
The figure below, on the left, identifies the locations of these pulp/paper mills and provides an overlay of 
the approximate catchment areas of each of these mills (100-mile radius) to illustrate the 
competitiveness of this market. Specifically, this figure indicates that competition for pine pulpwood from 
these mills is extremely high in the eastern half of the catchment area. However, to confirm this 
assertion, we took a closer look at how pine pulpwood prices vary throughout this catchment area.  
The figure below, on the right, shows county-level average pine pulpwood stumpage prices in the Georgia 
catchment area from 2Q 2019 – 1Q 2020 (provided by TimberMart-South). In comparing this figure to the 
one identifying pulp/paper mill competition levels, notice that prices are highest in those same areas 
where competition appears highest.

Drax – September 2020 
Given these initial findings, we decided to look further at pine pulpwood prices in the Georgia catchment 
area. Specifically, we took a closer look at how prices and price trends of pine pulpwood, the primary 
roundwood product consumed by these pulp/paper mills (as well as by Georgia Biomass and Fram), have 
historically differed in the ‘Coastal’ and ‘Interior’ regions of the Georgia catchment area (see figure below). 
 
 
 
 
Coastal vs. Interior Pine Pulpwood Stumpage Prices 
According to TimberMart-South, pine pulpwood (PPW) stumpage prices, overall, have trended similarly in 
the Coastal and Interior regions of the Georgia catchment area since 2000 (see figure on following page). 
Specifically, these prices have a high positive correlation to one another (correlation coefficient=0.97 
from 1Q00-1Q20). However, we’d like to point out two key observations. First, PPW stumpage prices 
have remained higher in the Coastal Region. And second, the gap between PPW stumpage prices in these 
two regions has widened since Georgia Biomass started up in 2Q 2011.  
Specifically, PPW stumpage prices in the Coastal Region averaged a 30% premium over those in the 
Interior Region from 1Q 2000 – 1Q 2011. However, that gap widened substantially during the two years 
that immediately followed Georgia Biomass’ startup, with Coastal Region PPW stumpage prices averaging 
a 55% premium over Interior Region PPW stumpage prices from 2Q 2011-1Q 2013 (and an overall

average premium of 35% since 2Q 2011). Adjusting for inflation, real PPW stumpage prices averaged 
$1.84 per ton higher in the Coastal Region from 1Q 2000-1Q 2011 compared to $2.94 per ton higher from 
2Q 2011-1Q 2020.  
Ultimately, this data and these findings seem to indicate that the pulp/paper mills located in the Coastal 
Region of the catchment area were/are willing to pay more for close-proximity wood fiber. As a result, 
Georgia Biomass and Fram have placed a higher focus on procuring roundwood from the less competitive 
western portion of the catchment area (a strategy confirmed by both Georgia Biomass and Fram 
personnel). Furthermore, the additional wood demand placed on the catchment area (primarily on the 
western portion) by Georgia Biomass and Fram was not sufficient enough to narrow the gap between 
pine pulpwood prices in the Interior Region versus those in the Coastal Region.  
 
 
 
Note that delivered timber prices are unavailable for these two smaller subregions due to data limitations and 
the limited number of contributing TimberMart-South data reporters (to protect reporter confidentiality). 
However, note that in the Georgia catchment area, pine pulpwood stumpage prices have a strong positive 
correlation to and are highly indicative of delivered pine pulpwood prices.

Glossary of Terms 
Average annual mortality of growing stock: The average cubic foot volume of sound wood in growing-stock trees that 
died in one year. 
Average annual net growth of growing stock: The annual change in cubic foot volume of sound wood in live 
sawtimber and poletimber trees, and the total volume of trees entering these classes through ingrowth, less volume 
losses resulting from natural causes, between 1999 and 2003.  
Average annual removals from growing stock: The average net growing-stock volume in growing-stock trees removed 
annually for roundwood forest products, in addition to the volume of logging residues and the volume of other 
removals.  
Basal area: Tree area in square feet of the cross section at breast height of a single tree.  When the basal areas of all 
trees in a stand are summed, the result is usually expressed as square feet of basal area per acre. 
Commercial species: Tree species suitable for industrial wood products. 
County and municipal: An ownership class of public lands owned by counties or local public agencies, or lands leased 
by these governmental units for more than 50 years.  
Cropland: Land under cultivation within the last 24 months, including cropland harvested, crop failures, cultivated 
summer fallow, idle cropland used only for pasture, orchards, active Christmas tree plantations indicated by annual 
shearing, nurseries, and land in soil improvement crops, but excluding land cultivated in developing improved 
pasture. 
Diameter class: A classification of trees based on diameter outside bark, measured at breast height 4.5 feet (DBH) 
(1.37m) above the ground or at root collar (DRC). Note: Diameter classes are commonly in 2-inch (5cm) increments, 
beginning with 2-inches (5cm). Each class provides a range of values with the class name being the approximate 
mid-point. For example, the 6-inch class (15-cm class) includes trees 5.0 through 6.9 inches (12.7 cm through 17.5 
cm) DBH, inclusive. 
Federal Land: An ownership class of public lands owned by the U.S. Government.  
Forest land: Land that has at least 10 percent crown cover by live tally trees of any size or has had at least 10 
percent canopy cover of live tally species in the past, based on the presence of stumps, snags, or other evidence. To 
qualify, the area must be at least 1.0 acre in size and 120.0 feet wide. Forest land includes transition zones, such as 
areas between forest and nonforest lands that meet the minimal tree stocking/cover and forest areas adjacent to 
urban and built—up lands. Roadside, streamside, and shelterbelt strips of trees must have a width of at least 120 
feet and continuous length of at least 363 feet to qualify as forest land. Unimproved roads and trails, streams, and 
clearings in forest areas are classified as forest if they are less than 120 feet wide or less than an acre in size. Tree-
covered areas in agricultural production settings, such as fruit orchards, or tree—covered areas in urban settings, 
such as city parks, are not considered forest land.  
Forest type: A classification of forest land based upon and named for the tree species that forms the plurality of live-
tree stocking. A forest type classification for a field location indicates the predominant live-tree species cover for the 
field location; hardwoods and softwoods are the first group to be determine predominant group, and Forest Type is 
selected from the predominant group. 
Growing stock tree: All live trees 5.0 inches (12.7) cm) DBH or larger that meet (now or prospectively) regional 
merchantability requirements in terms of saw-log length, grade, and cull deductions. Excludes rough and rotten cull 
trees. 
Hardwood: Tree species belonging to the botanical subdivision Angiospermae, class Dicotyledonous, usually broad-
leaved and deciduous.  
Land: The area of dry land and land temporarily or partly covered by water, such as marshes, swamps, and river 
flood plains.

Logging residues: The unused portions of trees cut or destroyed during harvest and left in the woods.  
Merchantable: Refers to a pulpwood or sawlog section that meets pulpwood or sawlog specifications, respectively. 
National forest: An ownership class of Federal lands, designated by Executive order or statute as National Forests or 
purchase units, and other lands under the administration of the Forest Service including experimental areas. 
Net annual growth: The average annual net increase in the volume of trees during the period between 
inventories.  Components include the increment in net volume of trees at the beginning of the specific year 
surviving to its end, plus the net volume of trees reaching the minimum size class during the year, minus the volume 
of trees that died during the year, and minus the net volume of trees that became cull trees during the year.  
Net volume in cubic feet: The gross volume in cubic feet less deductions for rot, roughness, and poor form.  Volume 
is computed for the central stem from a 1-foot stump to a minimum 4.0-inch top diameter outside bark, or to the 
point where the central stem breaks into limbs. 
Nonforest land: Land that does not support or has never supported, forests and lands formerly forested where use 
of timber management is precluded by development for other uses. Includes area used for crops, improved pasture, 
residential areas, city parks, improved roads of any width and adjoining rights-of-way, powerline clearings of any 
width, and noncensus water.  If intermingled in forest areas, unimproved roads and nonforest strips must be more 
than 120 feet (36.6m) wide, and clearings, etc., more than one acre (0.4ha) in size, to qualify as nonforest land. 
Ownership: A legal entity having an ownership interest in land regardless of the number of people involved. An 
ownership may be an individual; a combination of persons; a legal entity such as corporation, partnership, club, or 
trust; or a public agency. An ownership has control of a parcel or group of parcels of land. 
Pulpwood: Roundwood, whole-tree chips, or wood residues used for the production of wood pulp.  
Roundwood products: Logs, bolts, or other round timber generated from harvesting trees for industrial or consumer 
uses. Includes sawlogs; veneer and cooperage logs and bolts; pulpwood; fuelwood; pilings; poles; posts; hewn ties; 
mine timbers; and various other round, split or hewn products. 
Saw log: A log meeting minimum standards of diameter, length, and defect, including logs at least 8 feet long, sound 
and straight, and with a minimum diameter inside bark of 6 inches for softwoods and 8 inches for hardwoods, or 
meeting other combinations of size and defect specified by regional standards.   
Sawtimber tree: A live tree of commercial species containing at least a 12-foot sawlog or two noncontiguous saw 
logs 8 feet or longer and meeting regional specifications for freedom from defect.  Softwoods must be at least 9.0 
inches d.b.h.  Hardwoods must be at least 11.0 inches diameter outside bark (d.o.b.). 
Softwood: A coniferous tree, usually evergreen, having needles or scale-like leaves.  
Stand: A group of trees on a minimum of 1 acre of forest land that is stocked by forest trees of any size.  
State land: An ownership class of public lands owned by States or lands leased by States for more than 50 years.  
Timberland: Forest land that is producing or is capable of producing crops of industrial wood and not withdrawn 
from timber utilization by statute or administrative regulation.  (Note: Areas qualifying as timberland are capable of 
producing in excess of 20 cubic feet per acre per year of industrial wood in natural stands.  Currently inaccessible 
and inoperable areas are included.)   
Timber products output (TPO): All timber products cut from roundwood and byproducts of wood manufacturing 
plants.  Roundwood products include logs, bolts, or other round sections cut from growing-stock trees, cull trees, 
salvable dead trees, trees on nonforest land, noncommercial species, sapling-size trees, and limbwood.  Byproducts 
from primary manufacturing plants include slabs, edging, trimmings, miscuts, sawdust, shavings, veneer cores and 
clippings, and screenings of pulpmills that are used as pulpwood chips or other products. 
Tree: A woody perennial plant, typically large, with a single well-defined stem carrying a more or less definite crown; 
sometimes defined as attaining a minimum diameter of 3 inches (7.6) and a minimum height of 15 ft (4.6 m) at 
maturity. For FIA, any plant on the tree list in the current field manual is measured as a tree.

Tree size class: A classification of trees based on diameter at breast height, including sawtimber trees, poletimber 
trees, saplings, and seedlings. 
Urban forest land: Land that would otherwise meet the criteria for timberland but is in an urban-suburban area 
surrounded by commercial, industrial, or residential development and not likely to be managed for the production 
of industrial wood products on a continuing basis.  Wood removed would be for land clearing, fuelwood, or esthetic 
purposes.  Such forest land may be associated with industrial, commercial, residential subdivision, industrial parks, 
golf course perimeters, airport buffer strips, and public urban parks that qualify as forest land.  
Veneer log: A roundwood product from which veneer is sliced or sawn and that usually meets certain standards of 
minimum diameter and length and maximum defect.  
Weight: The weight of wood and bark, oven-dry basis (approximately 12 percent moisture content).
