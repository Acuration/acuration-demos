Summary 
1.1 
Abergelli Power Limited (APL) is promoting a new Power Generation Plant with its associated Gas 
and Electricity Connections (the ‘Project’) on agricultural land within Abergelli Farm north of 
Swansea in the City and County of Swansea (approximately at National Grid Reference 265284, 
201431). 
1.2 
A Habitat Suitability Index (HSI) assessment for great crested newts Triturus cristatus (GCN) was 
carried out at accessible ponds as part of the preliminary ecological appraisal of the Project Site at 
the time of the survey (hereafter referred to as the ‘Survey Site’). The results of the HSI 
assessment are set out in the Preliminary Ecological Appraisal (BSG, June 2014). APL 
subsequently commissioned BSG Ecology to undertake a presence/absence survey for GCN of 
ponds within 150 ha of pastoral farmland at and around Abergelli Farm in May 2014, to inform and 
support an application for Development Consent for the Project.  
1.3 
Owing to the size and nature of the Survey Site, and the lack of GCN records in the desk study 
search area, it was recommended that a survey for GCNs be conducted for all ponds within the 
Survey Site boundary and within 250 m of the Survey Site boundary. A total of five ponds were 
surveyed including three within the Survey Site and a further two within 250 m of the Survey Site 
boundary. It was not possible to access a number of ponds, which included: 
 
seven ponds outside of the Survey Site but within 250 m of the Survey Site boundary; and 
 
a further four ponds between 250m and 500m from the Survey Site boundary that formed part 
of a cluster of ponds, the remainder of which were within 250m of the Survey Site boundary. 
1.4 
The survey did not record any GCNs in the ponds surveyed, although palmate newts Lissotriton 
helveticus were recorded in three ponds and smooth newts Lissotriton vulgaris were recorded in 
two ponds. As a consequence, further surveys to establish the population size class of GCN were 
not necessary and were not undertaken.

Introduction 
 
2.1 
Abergelli Power Limited commissioned BSG Ecology to undertake a presence/absence GCN 
survey in May 2014 to inform and support an application for Development Consent for the Project 
described below.  
Site Description 
2.2 
The Survey Site consists of approximately 150 ha of pastoral farmland primarily grazed by horses. 
The extent of the Survey Site is shown in Figure 1 in Appendix 1 and is centred at National Grid 
Reference 265284, 201431. The nearest settlement is Felindre, which is located approximately 2 
km to the north of the Survey Site, with Swansea approximately 5 km to the south.    
2.3 
The Survey Site is largely agriculturally improved pasture with several areas of marshy grassland, 
particularly in the north, south and north-western ends of the Survey Site. The fields are bounded 
by fences, running along the line of defunct hedgerows, and often accompanied by ditches. There 
is a block of broadleaved woodland on the eastern boundary of the Survey Site and other areas of 
woodland around the marshy grassland to the west of the Survey Site, and around Felindre Gas 
Compressor Station and the two National Grid 400 kV electrical substations that lie at the south-
west end of the Survey Site.  The habitats in the surrounding landscape are similar to those within 
the Survey Site boundary – a mixture of improved and marshy grassland interspersed with 
occasional patches of woodland. 
Description of Project 
2.4 
APL is promoting a new Power Generation Plant with associated Gas and Electricity Connections 
within Abergelli Farm.  The Power Generation Plant would operate as a Simple Cycle Gas Turbine 
(SCGT) peaking plant and would be designed to provide an electrical capacity of up to 299 
Megawatts (MW).  It would be fuelled by natural gas, supplied by a new underground gas pipeline 
connecting the Power Generation Plant to the existing National Grid Gas (NGG) National 
Transmission System (NTS).  It would also connect to the National Grid Electrical Transmission 
System (NETS) via underground cable or overhead lines. 
2.5 
BSG Ecology has been appointed as the ecological consultant to undertake an ecology survey, 
which includes a desk study and Extended Phase 1 Habitat Survey as well as a range of Phase 2 
surveys, including presence / absence survey for GCNs. These baseline surveys will be included in 
an appendix to an ecology chapter of an Environmental Statement, which is intended for 
submission, in support of the application for Development Consent. 
Aims of Study 
2.6 
The aims of the GCN survey were to identify whether GCNs are present in the ponds within the 
Survey Site and those within 250 m of the Survey Site boundary using standard survey methods 
(as specified in Section 3).

Methods 
Desk Study 
3.1 
Existing ecological information for the Survey Site and its surrounding area was requested from the 
South East Wales Biodiversity Records Centre (SEWBReC).  Information on protected1 species, 
including GCNs, was requested covering the Survey Site and land up to 2 km from the Survey Site 
boundary. The National Biodiversity Network Gateway2 was also checked for records for 1 x 1 km 
grid squares in which GCN records have occurred. In addition, on-line mapping and aerial 
photography of the area were also reviewed to identify ponds that might be present within the 
Survey Site and 500 m of the boundary based on recommendations made in the Natural England 
(formerly English Nature) GCN Mitigation Guidelines3 (the selection of an appropriate buffer 
distance for survey is explained in more detail below). 
Scoping (HSI) Survey 
3.2 
A Preliminary Ecological Appraisal was carried out by BSG Ecology in February 2014 and updated 
in April 20144. As part of this survey, all accessible ponds within 250 m of the Survey Site were 
visited and assessed against the criteria of Oldham et al. (2000)5. This was to establish the 
likelihood of their use by GCNs using a Habitat Suitability Index (HSI), and to identify the scope of 
the GCN presence/absence field survey described below.  
3.3 
The information collected during the HSI assessment provides context of how ponds within or in 
proximity to the Survey Site may connect with habitat available for newts in the surrounding 
landscape, and also to give greater confidence to the assessment carried out on each pond.  
3.4 
Information on the physical features and characteristics of each pond within 250 m of the Survey 
Site was collected, to enable an HSI score to be derived for each pond, by applying the scoring 
system developed by the Herpetological Conservation Trust (HCT, 2008)6. Where a cluster of 
ponds was found (P01-P08; see Figure 1) with some ponds within 250 m of the Survey Site and 
some ponds beyond this distance, the intention was to carry out an HSI on all ponds within the 
cluster (although lack of access prevented this in this case).   
3.5 
The HSI is calculated by allocating scores to features associated with each pond including features 
such as size, quality of surrounding habitat and presence of fish. These scores are then used to 
calculate the overall HSI for each pond as a number between 0 and 1, with 0 being the least 
suitable and 1 being the most suitable. The HSI score allows each pond to be placed in one of five 
categories defining its suitability for GCNs as follows: 
 
<0.5  
 
= poor 
 
0.5 – 0.59 
= below average 
 
0.6 – 0.69 
= average 
 
0.7 – 0.79 
= good 
 
>0.8  
 
= excellent 
3.6 
In addition, there are a number of wet ditches present within the Survey Site and within 250 m of 
the Survey Site boundary. All of the wet ditches are narrow (<1 m width) and did not hold more 
than a few centimetres of water during February – June 2014 despite an exceptionally wet winter.

They are not thought to provide suitable habitat for GCNs and presence / absence surveys are not 
considered to be required for these waterbodies.  
Field Survey 
3.7 
Following the initial HSI assessment (see above) four GCN survey visits were undertaken within 
the period mid-March to mid-June to establish presence/absence (with at least two surveys during 
mid-April to mid-May), with an additional two surveys (six in total) required to estimate population 
size if GCN were found during the first four surveys. The GCN field survey work was undertaken in 
2014 and was completed in accordance with the Natural England (2001) GCN Mitigation 
Guidelines.  
3.8 
In determining the distance at which presence/absence survey of ponds would take place, Natural 
England guidance has been considered and an approach developed that is proportionate to the 
likelihood of encountering GCNs (Note that where a survey is conducted in Wales, Natural 
Resources Wales advise that the Natural England guidance is consulted.) 
3.9 
Natural England guidance on geographical limits of survey is discussed in Section 5.4 of the GCN 
Mitigation Guidelines which recommends that:  
“For a common situation, where a plot of land containing a pond is proposed for development, the 
pond itself should be surveyed, and other ponds up to 500 m away should also be checked, if it is 
thought likely that great crested newt populations centred on these ponds would be affected by 
changes to the plot.” 
3.10 
Natural England guidance is further developed in the GCN Method Statement7  which states that:  
“In keeping with a proportionate and risk-based approach, surveys need reasonable boundaries. 
The great crested newt mitigation guidelines explain that surveys of ponds up to around 500m from 
the development might need to be surveyed. The decision on whether to survey depends primarily 
on how likely it is that the development would affect newts using those ponds. For developments 
resulting in permanent or temporary habitat loss at distances over 250m from the nearest pond, 
carefully consider whether a survey is appropriate. Surveys of land at this distance from ponds are 
normally appropriate when all of the following conditions are met: (a) maps, aerial photos, walk-
over surveys or other data indicate that the pond(s) has potential to support a large great crested 
newt population, (b) the footprint contains particularly favourable habitat, especially if it constitutes 
the majority available locally, (c) the development would have a substantial negative effect on that 
habitat, and (d) there is an absence of dispersal barriers.” 
3.11 
The approach that has been taken for these field surveys is consistent with the above guidance 
and advice from Natural England. Where access was available, presence/absence surveys for 
GCN were carried out on all ponds within 250 m of the Project Site. The exception to this were 
pond clusters that are interconnected to each other (less than 250 m apart) and which therefore 
could be considered to be part of the same population (should GCN be found). However, no such 
ponds (P01-P08 and P012-P014) were accessible as shown on Figure 1. As explained in the 
limitations section below, it is not considered to be a significant constraint to the findings of the 
survey that some ponds could not be accessed. 
Limitations of study 
3.12 
The GCN field surveys were undertaken within the recommended survey period and in suitable 
weather conditions apart from the torchlight survey and egg search on 19/05/2014 where heavy 
rain occurred leaving some ponds turbid, making survey less effective for a short period. 
Nevertheless, the surveys were considered to be effective despite the reduced visibility. 
3.13 
Two ponds (P07 and P08) located within the Water Treatment Works to the northwest of Project 
Site that were classified during the HSI assessment as being of ‘average’ or ‘good’ value for GCNs 
could not be surveyed due to access not being granted by landowners. In addition, access was not 
granted by landowners to Ponds P01, P02, P03, P04, P05, P06, P12, P13 and P14, which would 
have been surveyed for presence/absence of GCN, had access been possible.

3.14 
In considering the significance of not surveying the inaccessible ponds both within and beyond 250 
m from the Project Site, it is useful to examine the results of the presence / absence surveys for 
those ponds that could be surveyed, as well as the results of the desk study, which places the 
Survey Site into a wider context (see 4.1). The presence/absence survey did not reveal the 
presence of GCNs in any of the five ponds surveyed, although three of the ponds supported 
smooth and /or palmate newts and were also thought to provide suitable habitat for GCNs. This 
included all ponds within the Survey Site, three of which were of ‘average’ suitability as derived 
from the Habitat Suitability Assessment. The Survey Site is on the edge of the known range of 
GCN and the lack of desk study records within 2 km of the Survey Site is consistent with this, as is 
a search of the National Biodiversity Network website where the closest record of GCN was 
approximately 7.5 km from the Survey Site.  
3.15 
The conclusion that may be drawn is that since suitable ponds within the Survey Site were not 
occupied by GCNs, and no GCN records have been located within 7 km of the Survey Site, it is 
unlikely that GCNs are present in the inaccessible ponds. Notwithstanding this, if any of the ponds 
that were not surveyed (most are beyond 250 m from the Survey Site) did indeed support GCNs, it 
is likely that they would be present in such low numbers and at a sufficient distance from the 
Survey Site as to be unaffected by the Project. A Natural England funded research report into 
trapping efficiency on sites where GCNs are present (Cresswell and Whitworth, 2004) supports this 
assertion. It arrives at the conclusion that very few animals were captured at distances greater than 
100 m from a breeding pond. As a consequence, it is not considered to be a significant constraint 
to the findings of the survey that some ponds could not be surveyed.

Results  
Desk Study 
4.1 
No records of GCNs within 2 km of the Survey Site were returned by SEWBReC.  The closest 1 x 1 
km Grid Square in which GCN records have occurred is ca. 7.5 km to the south-east of the Survey 
Site, near Llandarcy8. 
Scoping survey 
4.2 
Twelve ponds were identified within 250 m of the Survey Site boundary with the aid of aerial 
photographs and OS maps.  Of these, two (P16 and P17) were identified within the Survey Site 
boundary, 10 (P05, P06, P07, P08, P09, P10, P12, P13, P14, and P15) were located within 250 m 
of the Survey Site and another four (P01, P02, P03, and P04) beyond 250m of the Survey Site but 
forming part of a cluster of ponds (with P05-P08) within the Water Treatment Works to north-west 
of the Survey Site. An additional on-site pond (P11) was found whilst carrying out other survey 
work on 21 May 2014 in the marshy grassland in the north-west of the Survey Site. An HSI 
assessment was carried out on the seven ponds that were accessible within 250 m of the Survey 
Site boundary during the first Phase 1 survey visit (in February).  This included: the two on-site 
ponds (P16 and P17); one pond within 100 m of the Survey Site boundary (P15); and ponds within 
250 m of the Survey Site boundary for which access was possible (P07, P08, P09 and P10). An 
HSI assessment was also carried out on P11 following its discovery in May 2014.

The Survey Site lies in a part of Wales where the distribution of GCNs is patchy, with the species 
largely absent to the west of the Survey Site. Whilst this reduces the probability that GCNs would 
be present within the Survey Site, it does not rule out their presence.  There are a number of ponds 
in and around the Survey Site, and suitable habitat for newts in their terrestrial phase, including old 
hedge banks, marshy grassland and woodland within the Survey Site.  Accordingly, whilst the 
ponds surveyed did not have a ‘good’ or ‘excellent’ HSI score, they did have potential to provide 
breeding habitat for GCNs.  
4.6 
The scoping exercise concluded that surveys should be carried out on all ponds within 250 m of the 
Survey Site boundary, except P09, which was a small recession with a small amount of water in 
February and completely dry in April. In addition the cluster of inaccessible ponds within the 
grounds of the water treatment works (to the north-west of the Survey Site) are likely to be of 
similar ‘good’ quality as Pond 08 (which was visible through the gate) and it was concluded that 
surveys of this cluster of ponds (including P01, P02, P03 and P04) should also be carried out 
following the rationale explained in Section 3.7.

Field Survey  
4.7 
GCN presence-absence surveys were carried out on Ponds P10, P11, P15, P16, and P17. P15 
dried out completely between the first and second visits and was only surveyed once. The ponds 
within the Water Treatment Works (P01-P08), including four ponds beyond 250m from the Survey 
Site could not be surveyed: access to these ponds was denied on grounds of Health & Safety. In 
addition, access was denied to the cluster of three ponds (P12-P14) to the east of the Survey Site. 
The land surrounding these ponds contains Japanese Knotweed Fallopia japonica (an invasive 
species) and is subject to an exclusion and treatment programme which precludes access to third-
parties due to the risk of spreading the plant. 
4.8 
Surveys between May 12th and May 22nd were carried out by Stephanie Boocock MCIEEM under 
the class licence (WML-CL08) with assistance from Caitlin McCann, Owain Waters and Rachel 
Taylor. For Pond 11, which was identified late during other surveys, the third and fourth visits were 
carried out by Matthew Hobbs MCIEEM under license number (52219:OTH:SA:2014) with 
assistance from Rachel Taylor and Gareth Lang. On each visit, weather conditions, including air 
temperature were recorded. Table 1 gives details of the surveys.
