  Executive Summary 
1.1 
Overview of the Project and the DCO Application 
1.1.1 
The applicant for the Project is Millbrook Power Limited (MPL), a company 
registered in England (Company Number 8920458) and a wholly owned 
subsidiary of Drax Group PLC (incorporated in England and Wales with 
number 05562053), the ultimate holding company for the Drax group of 
companies.  
1.1.2 
MPL is applying to the Secretary of State (SoS) under the Planning Act 2008 
(PA 2008) for powers to construct, operate and maintain an Open Cycle Gas 
Turbine (OCGT) gas fired peaking power generating station, fuelled by 
natural gas with a rated electrical output of up to 299 Megawatts (MW). 
1.1.3 
The Project would be located at and in the vicinity of the former clay extraction 
pit at Rookery South, near Stewartby, Bedfordshire with the approximate 
centre of the Project Site at grid reference 501373, 240734. The boundary of 
the Project Site falls within both Central Bedfordshire Council (CBC) and 
Bedford Borough Council (BBC) areas.  
1.1.4 
The Planning Statement acts as the primary reference document for an 
explanation of the planning issues pertinent to the Project and a description 
of how the DCO Application addresses these. It forms part of the suite of 
documents accompanying the DCO Application submitted in accordance with 
Section 55 of the Act and Regulation 5 of the APFP Regulations. The DCO 
Application seeks the making of the Millbrook Power (Gas Fired Power 
Station) Order, which would confer the powers required. 
1.1.5 
The Order Limits comprise the land required for the Power Generation Plant, 
the Electrical Connection and the Gas Connection and are as shown on the 
Works Plans (Document Reference 2.7).   
1.1.6 
As the generation capacity of the Project will exceed 50MWe it is classed as 
a Nationally Significant Infrastructure Project (NSIP) and therefore 
Development Consent is required under the Planning Act 2008. 
1.1.7 
Development Consent for a NSIP may only be granted by a Development 
Consent Order through an application under Section 37 of the PA 2008 to the 
SoS. The Infrastructure Planning (Environmental Impact Assessment) 
Regulations 2009 (the EIA Regulations) require an Environmental Impact 
Assessment (EIA) to be carried out in respect of development that is classed 
as EIA development. All development in Schedule 1 of the EIA Regulations 
(“Schedule 1 development”) requires an EIA. Development in Schedule 2 of 
the EIA Regulations (“Schedule 2 development”) requires an EIA if it is likely 
to have significant effects on the environment. 
1.1.8 
The definition of a Schedule 1 development includes thermal generating 
stations with a heat output of 300 Megawatt Thermal (MWth) or more 
(Schedule 1 paragraph 2(a)).  The thermal output of the Power Generation 
4 
 
Plant will be greater than 300MWth and therefore an EIA will be required 
under the EIA Regulations. 
1.1.9 
Regulation 5 of the APFP Regulations requires that a series of documents 
must accompany the DCO Application.  This Planning Statement is not a 
required document pursuant to regulation 5 of the APFP Regulations but has 
been included as part of the DCO Application by MPL as MPL considers that 
it will assist in the consideration of the DCO Application by the Planning 
Inspectorate (PINS), interested parties and the SoS.  
1.2 
Need for and Benefits of the Project 
1.2.1 
The urgent need for energy generation, including gas fired generating 
stations and gas fired peaking plants, are set out within NPS EN-1 (paragraph 
3.8), the Gas Generation Strategy (DECC, 2012) (paragraph 1.36), and the 
National Infrastructure Plan (HM Treasury, 2014). In the Annual Energy 
Statement (AES) (DECC, 2014), DECC reiterated the need to build new 
power generation infrastructure and acknowledged the need for gas to 
feature strongly in the energy mix.  
1.2.2 
The Project would contribute materially to the immediate and medium term 
need for flexible, reliable, peak load power generation and facilitate the 
transition to a low carbon economy. The chosen technology for a peaking 
plant would help to ‘balance out’ the grid at times of peak electricity demand 
and help to support the grid at times when intermittent renewable sources 
cannot generate electricity.  
1.2.3 
The construction period is estimated to last 22 months from Q1 2020 to Q4 
2022, and is expected to be operational by 2022.  The number of construction 
workers onsite per month ranges from 25 to 122 during the peak construction 
period. 
1.2.4 
The construction and operation of the Project would benefit the local 
economy. Chapter 14 of the Environmental Statement (ES) (Document 
Reference 6.1) deals with the Socio-Economic Impacts of the Project. The 
Chapter concludes that inter alia the Project will deliver positive socio-
economic impacts through positive impacts on the labour market at the 
construction / decommissioning phases. It is further anticipated that the 
operation of the Project will have a positive impact on the labour market 
through the creation of local jobs.   
1.2.5 
Gross Value Added (GVA) is a measure of the value of goods and services 
produced in an area, industry or sector of an economy. Annual construction 
GVA per head in the East of England is £69,625. The construction phase will 
deliver £6.4 million GVA to the wider economy annually, as recorded within 
Chapter 14 of the ES (Document Reference 6.1).   
1.2.6 
Through assessing local and regional policy (set out and considered within 
sections 5 and 6 of this Planning Statement), it is evident that there is a 
significant requirement to create jobs in the Marston Vale area and across 
Bedford and Central Bedfordshire. The operational phase of the Project 
5 
 
would provide an estimated 10 FTE direct jobs.  The net effect, taking 
account of leakage, displacement and the multiplier effect would be 9.4 
additional regional FTE jobs and 5.5 national FTE jobs. Average GVA per 
utility employee in East of England is £90,071. Assuming Project related 
employment generated average levels of GVA, the Project’s operation would 
provide approximately £0.85m GVA and £0.5m GVA per annum to the local 
and national economy respectively.   
1.2.7 
It is further projected that should the construction, decommissioning or 
operation occur simultaneously with any other projects in the area, that this 
would enhance local benefits for goods, services and employment, thus 
resulting in a minor positive cumulative effect.  
1.3 
Planning Assessment 
1.3.1 
Under the Localism Act 2011 PINS became the agency responsible for 
operating the planning system for NSIPs and conducting the examination 
process. 
1.3.2 
The examination is a predominantly written process led either by a single 
appointed person or a panel, who submit a report with their recommendation 
to the relevant SoS who will take the final decision as to whether to make a 
Development Consent Order for the Project and in what terms. The relevant 
SoS for the Project is the SoS for Business, Energy and Industrial Strategy. 
1.3.3 
Section 104(2) of the PA 2008 provides that in making decisions on 
Development Consent Order applications, the SoS must have regard to any 
relevant National Policy Statement and must decide applications in 
accordance with it unless the adverse impacts of the proposal would 
outweigh its benefits (or in certain other limited circumstances). 
1.3.4 
As set out in National Policy Statement (NPS) EN-1, “this NPS, when 
combined with the relevant technology-specific energy NPS, provides the 
primary basis for decisions by the [SoS]” (paragraph 1.1.1) and that the SoS 
“should start with a presumption in favour of granting consent to applications 
for energy NSIPs” (paragraph 4.1.2). The relevant National Policy 
Statements in the context of the Project are: 
 National Policy Statement EN-1 - The Overarching National Policy 
Statement for Energy; 
 National Policy Statement EN-2- National Policy Statement for Fossil 
Fuel Electricity Generating Infrastructure; 
 National Policy Statement EN-4 - National Policy Statement for Gas 
Supply Infrastructure and Gas and Oil Pipelines; and, 
 National Policy Statement EN-5 – National Policy Statement for 
Electricity Networks Infrastructure. 
6 
 
1.3.5 
Section 104 of the Planning Act 2008 also requires the SoS to have regard 
to any Local Impact Report (see section 104(2)(b)) and other matters which 
the SoS “thinks are both important and relevant to the SoS’s decision”. A 
range of UK and local policy designations and evidence that may assist the 
SoS’s decision making is reproduced within sections 5 and 6. 
1.3.6 
The EIA Regulations require an EIA to be carried out for the Project. 
1.3.7 
In accordance with section 4.2 of NPS EN-1, the ES (Document Reference 
6.1) considers: 
 aspects of the environment likely to be significantly affected by the 
project, including social and economic effects and how any likely 
significant negative effects would be avoided or mitigated; 
 likely significant effects, including any significant residual effects 
taking account of any proposed mitigation measures or any adverse 
effects of those measures; 
 Distinctions between project stages and mitigation measures at those 
stages; 
 Information on how the effects of the applicant’s proposal would 
combine and interact with the effects of other development (including 
projects for which consent has been sought or granted, as well as 
those already in existence); and 
 Which elements of the proposals are detailed and which remain to be 
finalised, and reasons, with maximum extents of plant and site shown 
and appropriate requirements in the Draft DCO. 
1.3.8 
The EIA findings, set out within the ES (Document Reference 6.1) and 
referenced in section 6 of this Planning Statement, support the overall 
conclusion that there are no relevant adverse impacts or disbenefits which 
hold enough significance to outweigh the substantial weight that must be 
afforded to the Project’s contribution towards meeting national energy and 
climate change policies, including meeting the national need for flexible gas 
generation.  
1.3.9 
Having regard to the requirements of Section 104 of the PA 2008, and in the 
absence of sufficient indications to the contrary, there is a compelling case in 
the public interest for the Order to be made in the terms proposed.

2.2 
Project Overview 
2.2.1 
MPL is applying to the SoS under the PA 2008 for consent to construct, 
operate and maintain: 
 
a new Power Generation Plant in the form of an Open Cycle Gas 
Turbine (OCGT) peaking power generating station, fuelled by natural 
gas with a rated electrical output of up to 299 MW.  This is the output 
of the generating station as a whole, measured at the terminals of the 
generating equipment. The Power Generation Plant comprises: 
o generating equipment including one Gas Turbine Generator 
with one exhaust gas flue stack and Balance of Plant (together 
referred to as the ‘Generating Equipment’), which are located 
within the ‘Generating Equipment Site’; 
o a new purpose built access road from Green Lane to the 
Generating Equipment Site (the ‘Access Road’ or the ‘Short 
Access Road’); 
o a 
temporary 
construction 
compound 
required 
during 
construction only (the ‘Laydown Area’); 
 
a new underground gas pipeline connection, approximately 1.8 km in 
length (the ‘Pipeline’) to bring natural gas to the Generating Equipment 
from the National Transmission System (the ‘Gas Connection’). The 
Gas Connection also incorporates an Above Ground Installation (AGI) 
at the point of connection to the National Transmission System; and 
 
a new electrical connection to export power from the Generating 
Equipment to the National Grid Electricity Transmission System 
(NETS) (the ‘Electrical Connection’), comprising an underground 
double circuit Tee-in. This would require one new tower (which will 
replace an existing tower and be located in the existing Grendon – 
Sundon transmission route corridor, thereby resulting in no net 
additional towers). This option would require two SECs, one located 
on each side of the existing transmission line, and both circuits would 
then be connected via underground cables approximately 500 m in 
length to a new substation (the ‘Substation’). 
2.2.2 
The Generating Equipment, Access Road and Laydown Area are together 
known as the ‘Power Generation Plant’ and are located within the ‘Power 
Generation Plant Site’. The Power Generation Plant Site is approximately 
12.5 ha in area. 
2.2.3 
The Power Generation Plant, Gas Connection, and Electrical Connection, 
together with all access requirements are referred to as the ‘Project’. The 
land upon which the Project would be developed, or which would be required 
in order to facilitate the development of the Project, is referred to as the 
‘Project Site’. 
9 
 
2.2.4 
The Project is proposed at and in the vicinity of the former clay extraction pit 
at Rookery South, near Stewartby, Bedfordshire.  The boundary of the 
Project Site falls within both Central Bedfordshire Council (CBC) and Bedford 
Borough Council (BBC) areas.  
2.2.5 
A full glossary of defined terms is presented in the Project Glossary 
(Document Reference 1.4). 
2.3 
The Applicant 
2.3.1 
The Applicant for the Project is Millbrook Power Limited (MPL), an energy 
development company (Company Number 8920458) established for the 
Project. MPL is a wholly owned subsidiary of Drax Group PLC (Drax) 
(Company number 05562053), the ultimate holding company for the Drax 
group of companies.  
2.3.2 
MPL's registered office is at Drax Power Station, Drax, Selby, North 
Yorkshire, United Kingdom, YO8 8PH. The Project is being managed by 
MPL's project team based in Edinburgh (49 York Place Edinburgh EH1 3JD).  
2.3.3 
Drax acquired MPL from Watt Power Limited (Watt Power) in 2016. Stag 
Energy Development Company Ltd (Stag Energy) previously provided 
management services to Watt Power in relation to MPL. Stag Energy 
continues to provide resources to MPL through a management services 
agreement. Stag Energy was founded in 2002 and the company draws on a 
depth of experience within a team that has created and delivered over 10,000 
MW of power generation and related infrastructure projects across the globe, 
of which 2,500 MW has been delivered in the UK. 
2.3.4 
Drax currently has three other power generation projects which have either 
already been granted consent under or are being brought forward through 
the PA 2008 process. They are: Progress Power Ltd at Eye Airfield in Suffolk 
(www.progresspower.co.uk): Hirwaun Power Ltd at Hirwaun in South Wales 
(www.hirwaunpower.co.uk): and Abergelli Power Ltd at Abergelli in South 
Wales (www.abergellipower.co.uk).  The first two listed projects were granted 
Development Consent in July 2015. 
2.3.5 
 MPL is committed to the development of assets to support the UK 
Government’s drive to a low carbon economy.  MPL recognises the need to 
balance commercial issues with the environmental benefits and concerns 
relating to energy projects and believes this balance can be responsibly 
delivered. The Project would be designed and developed to high quality, 
safety and environmental standards. 
2.3.6 
MPL is also committed to acting in a socially and environmentally responsible 
manner.  As part of this policy, MPL has sought the views and concerns of 
the local community during two phases of consultation and has considered 
the representations made during this process in preparing the DCO 
Application.  Statutory consultation has been carried out in accordance with 
the requirements of primary and secondary legislation, in particular the PA 
10 
 
2008, the EIA Regulations 2009 and the APFP Regulations, and is recorded 
within the Consultation Report (Document Reference 5.1). 
2.3.7 
Further information on the companies referred to above is provided at 
www.millbrookpower.co.uk  or www.drax.com. 
2.4 
Requirement for Development Consent and for Environmental Impact 
Assessment 
2.4.1 
The generation capacity of the Power Generation Plant will exceed 50MWe 
and will therefore be classified as an NSIP under Section 15 of the PA 2008.  
Accordingly, Development Consent will be required in accordance with 
Section 31 of the PA 2008. 
2.4.2 
Development Consent for a NSIP may only be granted by a DCO through an 
application under Section 37 of the PA 2008 to the SoS. Section 37 of the PA 
2008 also governs the content of an application for a DCO, including the 
requirements for the necessary accompanying documents. These 
requirements are specified in the Infrastructure Planning (Applications: 
Prescribed Forms and Procedure) Regulations 2009 (“APFP Regulations”). 
2.4.3 
The Project falls under the EIA Regulations 2009 regime and not the 
Infrastructure Planning (Environmental Impact Assessment) Regulations 
2017 (EIA Regulations 2017) regime. This is because a scoping opinion was 
requested from the SoS under the EIA Regulations 2009 before the EIA 
Regulations 2017 came into effect. This means that, in accordance with the 
transitional arrangements at Regulation 37 of the EIA Regulations 2017, the 
EIA Regulations 2009 will continue to apply to the Project. 
2.4.4 
The Infrastructure Planning (Environmental Impact Assessment) Regulations 
2009 (the EIA Regulations) require an EIA to be carried out in respect of 
development that is classed as EIA development. All development in 
Schedule 1 to the EIA Regulations (“Schedule 1 development”) requires EIA. 
Development in Schedule 2 to the EIA Regulations (“Schedule 2 
development”) requires EIA if it is likely to have significant effects on the 
environment.  
2.4.5 
The definition of a Schedule 1 development includes thermal generating 
stations with a heat output of 300MWth or more (Schedule 1 paragraph 2(a)).  
The thermal output of the Power Generation Plant will be greater than 
300MWth and therefore an EIA for the Project will be required under the EIA 
regulations. 
2.4.6 
Section 5(2)(a) of the APFP Regulations requires that any Environmental 
Statement required pursuant to the EIA Regulations, together with any 
scoping or screening opinions or directions, must accompany the DCO 
Application. 
11 
 
2.5 
Composition of the DCO Application 
2.5.1 
The legislative requirements for applications for a Development Consent 
Order are principally contained in the PA 2008, the APFP Regulations and 
(in this instance) the EIA Regulations.  
2.5.2 
The DCO Application submitted for the Project complies with the 
requirements of the PA 2008, the APFP Regulations, the EIA Regulations 
and applicable SoS and Planning Inspectorate guidance, including in 
particular Planning Inspectorate Advice Note 7 (Preparation and submission 
of application documents, February 2016).  
2.5.3 
A full list of all documents to be provided alongside the Draft DCO has been 
supplied to PINS and is set out within Table 2.1 below.

Project Context and Site Description 
3.1 
The Project 
3.1.1 
MPL is applying to the SoS under the PA 2008 for consent to construct, 
operate and maintain an OCGT gas fired peaking power generating station, 
fuelled by natural gas with a rated electrical output of up to 299 Megawatts 
(MW), as set out within section 2.2 of this Planning Statement. 
3.1.2 
The land upon which the Project would be developed, or which would be 
required in order to facilitate the development of the Project, is referred to as 
the ‘Project Site’.  The Project is proposed at and in the vicinity of the former 
clay extraction pit at Rookery South, near Stewartby, Bedfordshire with the 
approximate centre of the Project Site at grid reference 501373, 240734. The 
boundary of the Project Site falls within both Central Bedfordshire Council 
(CBC) and Bedford Borough Council (BBC) areas. The location of the Project 
Site is shown in Figure 3.1 (illustrated by red star). 
Figure 3-1: Location of the Project Site 
 
3.1.3 
Figure 3.2 shows the Order Limits of the DCO Application (outlined and 
shaded in red).

Figure 3-2: Order Limits of the DCO Application 
 
3.2 
Description of the Project 
3.2.1 
The Project and its key elements are described in full below. Additional details 
can be found in the individual topic Chapters of the ES (Document Reference 
6.1) and other DCO Application documents (referred to in Table 2.1). 
19 
 
Generating Equipment 
3.2.2 
The Generating Equipment would be designed as a peaking plant fired by 
natural gas. It would have a rated electrical output of up to 299MW. 
3.2.3 
As a peaking plant, the Generating Equipment could run up to a maximum of 
2,250 hours in any given year, provided that the 5 year rolling average does 
not exceed 1,500 hours. For the purposes of the EIA, a worst case yearly 
maximum of 2,250 running hours has been assessed where appropriate. 
Peaking plants are required to operate when there is a ‘stress event’ on the 
grid. This occurs when there is a surge in demand for electricity associated 
with a particular event (e.g. where many people across the country might boil 
a kettle following the end of a popular television programme) or where there 
is a sudden drop in power being generated from plants which are constantly 
operational (e.g. a sudden outage). Peaking plants also help to ‘balance out’ 
the grid at other times of peak electricity demand and help to support the grid 
at times when other technologies (e.g. renewable energy sources, such as 
wind and solar farms) cannot generate electricity due to their intermittent 
operation and reliance on weather conditions. 
3.2.4 
Given these parameters, it has been determined that a OCGT plant is the 
preferred and most appropriate technology choice for the Generating 
Equipment. 
3.2.5 
The DCO Application has been prepared having regard to PINS advice note 
nine (AN9) – ‘Using the Rochdale Envelope’ (April 2012, Version 2). AN9 
states (at Page 6) that: 
“The Planning Inspectorate understands that in the early stages of preparing 
a DCO application it may not be possible for a developer to have resolved all 
the details of a project”. And that “The ‘Rochdale Envelope’ is an 
acknowledged way of dealing with an application comprising EIA 
development where details of a project have not been resolved at the time 
when the application is submitted”. 
3.2.6 
This approach will be flexible enough using the ‘Rochdale Envelope’ 
approach to allow the Applicant to achieve an up to 299 MW project by using 
equipment from a number of manufacturers which will include a Gas Turbine 
Generator, with a gas flue stack.  It is also noted in AN9 (page 10) that an 
EIA must: 
“…ensure that all the realistic and likely worst case variations of the project 
have been properly considered and clearly set out in the ES and such that 
the likely significant impacts have been adequately assessed”. 
3.2.7 
To this end, where flexibility in parameters for the Project has been provided, 
the Applicant has assessed the realistic worst case. 
Open Cycle Gas Turbine (OCGT) 
3.2.8 
An ‘industrial’ type gas turbine would be used for the Project. This type of 
turbine has been selected as it is suited to generating up to 299MW using 
20 
 
only one unit, thereby reducing potential effects of noise, air quality and visual 
impacts. Additionally, they are suitable for frequent and fast start-ups, 
flexibility, and high-availability maintenance techniques. 
3.2.9 
The main equipment in an OCGT is a Gas Turbine Generator, including the 
following components: 
 Gas turbine generator; 
 air inlet filter house; 
 air inlet duct; 
 exhaust diffuser; 
 Auxiliaries including: 
o Lube oil system; 
o Air dryers; 
o Fuel gas filter package; 
o Instrument air system; 
o Compressor washing; and 
o A stack with an exhaust silencer would also be part of the 
OCGT. 
3.2.10 
On entering the gas turbine, air would be compressed and natural gas 
injected into the air. The air and natural gas mixture would then burn in the 
combustion chamber producing hot, high pressure gases. The gas would 
then expand across the blades of the gas turbine driving the compressor and 
the electrical generator to produce electricity. 
3.2.11 
The waste gases and heat produced from this process would be released 
into the atmosphere via the stack. The stack would contain equipment which 
would reduce emissions released to the atmosphere, including a silencer. 
3.2.12 
Further information on why the exhaust gases are emitted to the atmosphere 
and cannot be recovered is given in Chapter 5 of this ES and in a separate 
Combined Heat and Power (CHP) statement (Document Reference 6.2).  
3.2.13 
A stack height sensitivity study (referred to within Chapter 6 of the ES 
(Document Reference 6.1)) has been undertaken for the Project to determine 
the minimum stack height for the Gas Turbine Generator required for 
adequate dispersion of emissions and to meet legislative air quality targets. 
The height parameters would apply to all technology choices. 
3.2.14 
Stack emissions would be continuously recorded to ensure correct and 
efficient operation of the Generating Equipment. Any significant deviations to 
21 
 
emission limit values specified in the Environmental Permit would be alarmed 
and corrections carried out on occurrence. Records of performance and 
deviation would be maintained. Full facilities for interfacing information, 
control and alarm systems would be installed so that the Generating 
Equipment can be operated from a central control room via a distributed 
control system (DCS). In the event of a fault in the Gas Turbine Generator or 
other major plant items, the Generating Equipment would shut down 
automatically in a controlled manner. 
3.2.15 
Processed natural gas sourced from the National Transmission System 
(NTS) is a clean burning fuel and does not produce the particulate or sulphur 
emissions associated with burning coal; consequently flue gas cleaning 
equipment is not required.   
3.2.16 
Figure 3.3 shows a simple schematic of OCGT operation. 
Figure 3-3 Schematic of OCGT Operation 
 
Other Generating Equipment Plant Items 
3.2.17 
In addition to the Gas Turbine Generator at the Generating Equipment Site, 
the following plant and buildings would also be present: 
 Raw / Fire Water Tank: The fire water storage tank would be designed 
to comply with the relevant fire regulations and would be installed 
together with fire pumps, hose reels, fire hydrants and portable 
extinguishers; 
 Demineralised Water Tank: Required to store demineralised water for 
the Generating Equipment (used for e.g. blade washing); 
 Control Room / office / workshop Building: Required in order to monitor 
the plant operation and house plant controls; 
 Gatehouse: Needed to provide security and maintain a log of site 
attendance, deliveries etc; 
22 
 
 Electrical Transformer Compound: Required to connect the electrical 
infrastructure from the Generating Equipment to transformers before 
export to the Substation which is part of the NETS, via overhead 
cables; 
 Natural Gas Receiving Station: Required to ensure that gas coming 
from the National Transmission System feeds into the Generating 
Equipment Site at the right flow and pressure conditions; 
 Fin-Fan Coolers to provide cooling to the Generating Equipment; 
 Telemetry apparatus including electrical cabinets; 
 Emergency Generator: A small diesel fired generator used to start up 
the plant independently of the NETS; and 
 Maintenance Compound: a small area of hard standing for use during 
maintenance procedures.  
3.2.18 
The maximum area for the Generating Equipment Site would be in the order 
of 4 ha.

Laydown Area 
3.2.20 
A temporary construction compound for the storage of plant and equipment 
during construction would be provided adjacent to the Generating Equipment 
Site.  
Access Road 
3.2.21 
An agricultural access track is already in existence at the Project Site, linking 
Green Lane to Rookery South Pit.  The LLRS (described further in section 
3.4 of this Planning Statement), includes work to build a new ramp into the 
Rookery South Pit itself. 
3.2.22 
The Rookery South RRF Project includes provision to upgrade this track 
further, to a tarmac road suitable for 594 traffic movements a day for the 
delivery of waste via HGV.  Should this road be developed as part of the 
Rookery South RRF Project prior to the development of this Project, it would 
be suitable to meet both the needs of the Project and the Rookery South RRF 
Project. In this instance, there would be a requirement for a short section of 
new Access Road (‘Short Access Road’) of up to 1.4 km in length connecting 
the end of the Rookery South RRF road to the Generating Equipment Site. 
References to the "Access Road" mean the up to 2.2 km access road referred 
to below and include the Short Access Road. References to the "Short 
Access Road" refer only to the approximately 1.4 km length road that MPL 
would construct in the event that the Covanta scheme commenced ahead of 
the Project. The Short Access Road would be constructed from tarmac 
bordered by a concrete kerb. The tarmacked surface would be 6 m wide 
allowing for two-way traffic. It is bordered on one side by a footway.  
3.2.23 
However, because it is not certain as to when or if the Rookery South RRF 
Project will be implemented, the Applicant has also included the provision of 
25 
 
a complete Access Road from Green Lane to the Power Generating Site 
within this Project. If the Rookery South RRF Project is not built before 
construction commences for the Project then the complete Access Road 
would be built. This complete 2.2 km long Access Road would be constructed 
from tarmac bordered by a concrete kerb. The tarmacked surface would be 
6 m wide allowing for two-way traffic. It would be bordered in part on one side 
by a footway where there is no existing footpath. 
3.2.24 
The route of the Access Road from Green Lane would follow the alignment 
of the access road proposed within the LLRS and Rookery South RRF 
Project along the existing access track which borders Rookery North Pit. On 
reaching Rookery South Pit, the Access Road (as would also be the case for 
the Rookery South RRF Project's access road) would use the access ramp 
(built to agricultural standard as part of the LLRS) to enter into the pit and 
cross through the base of the pit until it reaches the Generating Equipment 
Site.  
3.2.25 
Should the Access Road for the Project be constructed first, it would not 
prevent the Rookery South RRF Project or other developments from 
progressing at a later date, although it may mean that the Access Road would 
be upgraded as part of the other scheme(s). The upgrade of the Access Road 
would be the responsibility of Covanta in the event that the permission for 
that scheme is implemented after any DCO for the Project.  
Gas Connection 
3.2.26 
The Gas Connection would comprise all the necessary elements to enable 
gas to be imported to the Generating Equipment at a suitable rate and 
pressure to produce up to 299 MW, including a new underground pipeline, 
AGI and gas receiving station.  
3.2.27 
The underground gas pipeline connection (the Pipeline) would be 
constructed between the AGI (to be installed at the connection point with the 
National Transmission System) and the Generating Equipment. The Pipeline 
and AGI are required in order to connect the Generating Equipment to the 
existing high pressure National Transmission System so as to provide a 
reliable supply of fuel.  The feasibility and route selection studies undertaken 
for this connection are described in ES (Document Reference 6.1) Chapter 
5. 
Route  
3.2.28 
The route of the Gas Connection is approximately 1.82 km in length. It 
involves no major road crossings, one minor road crossing, one farm track 
crossing, no major or minor water crossings, two ditch crossings and no in-
road mains-laying. It also crosses the National Transmission System feeder 
9 gas pipeline and an oil pipeline.  
3.2.29 
The pipeline begins at the AGI which would allow connection into the National 
Transmission System Feeder 9, east of the Millbrook Proving Ground 
approximately 1.45 km south of the Generating Equipment Site. The Pipeline 
26 
 
exits the AGI to the north and immediately crosses a farm track which is 
connected to Lower Farm. The route then continues in a northerly direction 
for around 25 m before it turns 45 to the west crossing National 
Transmission System Feeder 9. It continues west for approximately 20 m 
before turning 45 back to the east. It continues in this northerly direction for 
approximately 110 m before crossing a PROW.  
3.2.30 
After another 70 m, the route turns 45 to the west before crossing Millbrook 
Road. The route then turns 45 back to the east for 100 m and then 45 further 
to the east before crossing under a set of overhead lines. After a further 30 
m the route turns 45° to the west and continues due north for approximately 
250 m before turning a further 22.5° west and crossing between a gap in the 
hedgerow of a field boundary. After crossing the hedgerow, the route turns a 
further 22.5° west and after approximately 300 m crosses beneath an oil 
pipeline. The route then continues in the same direction for approximately 
220 m before turning 11.25 to the east and after 80 m crosses a further 
PROW and a field drain. 
3.2.31 
The route then continues for a further 100 m before turning 90° west into the 
Generating Equipment Site.   
Connection to the National Transmission System 
3.2.32 
Connection of the Pipeline to a National Transmission System feeder will 
require an AGI to be installed which will include: a Minimum Offtake 
Connection (MOC) facility, which would be owned by National Grid Gas Plc 
(NGG), and a Pipeline Inspection Gauge (PIG) Trap Facility (PTF) which 
would be owned by the Applicant (together, referred to as the AGI). 
3.2.33 
The MOC (approximately 35 x 35 m in area) would contain: 
 Remotely operable valve (ROV); 
 Control and instrumentation kiosk; and 
 Electrical supply kiosk. 
3.2.34 
The PTF (approximately 45 x 30 m in area) would contain: 
 PIG launching facility; 
 Emergency control valve; 
 Isolation valve; 
 Control and instrumentation kiosk; and 
 Electrical supply kiosk. 
3.2.35 
Termination of the Gas Connection would be at the gas receiving station on 
the Generating Equipment Site.   
27 
 
3.2.36 
Two options will be used with regard to access for the Gas Connection.  
These access options are as follows:  
 through the Rookery South Pit, from the Power Generation Plant Site; 
and 
 from the A421, northwards along the A5141, westwards then 
southwards for approximately 7km along the B530 (referred to 
variously along its route as Ampthill Road / Hardwick Road / Bedford 
Road / Hazelwood Lane) to Millbrook Road. 
3.2.37 
An existing junction off Houghton Lane onto an existing agricultural track will 
be used to access the AGI. 
3.2.38 
During construction, a temporary laydown area would be required adjacent 
to the AGI for laydown of plant and equipment.  
Electrical Connection 
3.2.39 
The Electrical Connection would comprise all the necessary elements to 
enable power to be exported from the Generating Equipment to the NETS, 
such as the new Substation comprising switchgear bays, gantries, 
emergency power supply, welfare accommodation, battery rooms, control 
cubicles and internal site roads.  
3.2.40 
A grid connection assessment was undertaken in March 2014 (see Grid 
Connection Statement (Document Reference 9.1)) in order to define and 
evaluate the options available for connecting the Generating Equipment to 
the NETS. This (along with consultations undertaken with NGET) identified 
that the most suitable point of connection would be a new substation to be 
located adjacent to the western boundary of the Generating Equipment Site, 
which would connect into the existing NGET double circuit 400 kV line 
(forming part of the NETS) which runs from Sundon to Grendon.  The 400 kV 
line is located approximately 320 m southwest of the Generating Equipment 
Site. 
3.2.41 
Further refinement and discussion with NGET in 2017 have allowed the 
connection design to be reduced to a single option which is presented in the 
ES (Document Reference 6.1). This comprises one underground 400kV 
double circuit tee-in, requiring one new transmission tower, which would 
replace an existing tower, and be located in the existing Grendon – Sundon 
transmission route corridor, therefore resulting in no net additional towers. 
The Electrical Connection would also require two SECs, which will be located 
on either side of the existing transmission line.  Underground cables would 
be approximately 500 m in length buried in four trenches typically 5 m apart, 
to a new substation. Three cables would be laid together within each trench 
to make 12 cables in total.  
3.2.42 
The SECs and replacement tower may cause a permanent obstruction to the 
LLRS secondary access. If this is the case, a short permanent diversion 
would be provided.  
28 
 
Substation 
3.2.43 
A new 400Kv Substation would be located in Rookery South pit, adjacent to 
the Generating Equipment Site.  A substation can either be an air insulated 
substation (AIS) or a gas insulated substation (GIS). MPL considers that a 
Substation with AIS technology is appropriate and acceptable in the location 
(within Rookery South Pit). The Substation would be approximately 200 m x 
150 m. 
3.2.44 
Two access route options would be used for construction access for the 
Electrical Connection.  They are shown in ES (Document Reference 6.1) 
Figure 12.2 and are as follows: 
 through the Rookery South Pit, from the area of the Power Generation 
Plant Site; or 
 from the A421, northwards along the A5141, westwards then 
southwards for approximately 7 km along the B530 (Ampthill Road / 
Hardwick Road / Bedford Road / Hazelwood Lane) to Millbrook Road, 
Houghton Lane and Station Lane. The secondary access into the 
southern side of Rookery South Pit that is being constructed as part 
of the LLRS would then be used to access the Electrical Connection. 
3.2.45 
An assessment of both access routes has been undertaken and is presented 
in the ES (Document Reference 6.1). 
3.3 
Project Stages 
3.3.1 
The ES (Document Reference 6.1) describes the Project Stages in line with 
NPS EN-1 4.2.3, which are summarised below. 
Pre-Construction 
3.3.2 
An option agreement has been put in place between MPL and the landowner 
of Rookery Pit such that relevant elements of the LLRS (referred to in section 
3.4 below) will be completed prior to the commencement of the development 
of the Project, which is anticipated to be in 2020).  The option agreement 
ensures that, as a minimum, the following components of the LLRS will be 
complete prior to construction of the Project commencing: 
 
the re-profiling of the base of the pit involving the extraction of soils and 
clays from the permitted extraction area on the southern side with re-grading 
of the base of the pit to an approximate level of 15 mbgl; 
 
implementation of surface water drainage measures and construction of an 
attenuation pond and pumping station in order to facilitate a managed 
surface water drainage strategy; 
 
a landscape strategy to include planting on the boundary of the Rookery 
South Pit and the margins of the attenuation pond;  
29 
 
 
provision of buttresses to the southern, eastern and northern slopes to 
ensure the long-term stability of those slopes, and re-grading through 
excavation; 
 
provision of a series of permissive footpaths around the perimeter of 
Rookery North Pit and around the attenuation pond within Rookery South 
Pit; 
 
provision of an access ramp into Rookery South Pit from Rookery North Pit 
which connects to Green Lane, Stewartby via an existing track along the 
western side of Rookery North Pit. Note that the ramp and existing track are 
both of an agricultural standard; and 
 
provision of a further, smaller access track into and out of Rookery South 
Pit from the south side of the pit connecting with Station Lane, near Millbrook 
Station.     
3.3.3 
To facilitate the proposed LLRS works, extraction of clay from a currently un-
worked area situated directly to the south of the existing extent of Rookery South 
Pit will be undertaken. This area covers approximately 25 ha and forms part of 
the existing minerals extraction consent boundary, but has not historically been 
subject to excavation works. Deposits won from this area will provide material 
for use in the restoration, re-profiling and buttressing work to Rookery South Pit 
together with the implementation of a landscape and ecology strategy, which 
will integrate with ecological mitigation works and strategic landscape planting 
in Rookery North Pit.  
3.3.4 
The LLRS works will be completed prior to the commencement of construction 
works for the Project, with the possible exception of buttressing and re-profiling 
to the eastern side of Rookery South Pit, which has no bearing on the Project 
as it lies outside the boundary of the Project Site. 
3.3.5 
Once the LLRS works are completed, Rookery South Pit will be approximately 
15 m below the surrounding ground level in the vicinity of the Generating 
Equipment Site, Laydown Area and the Substation. 
Construction 
3.3.6 
Construction and commissioning of the Project would take approximately 22 
months. The main works associated with the construction phase would be 
preparation for new foundations, piling (if required), erection of the 
Generating Equipment, construction of the Access Road, the laying of the 
Pipeline, the construction of the AGI and erecting the Electrical Connection.  
No requirements for demolition or remediation have been identified at this 
stage.  
Operation 
3.3.7 
The Generating Equipment, Gas Connection, Electrical Connection and 
Access Road would be designed to have an operational life of at least 25 
years.  For the purposes of assessment, a 25 year life has been used as an 
assumption to allow for decommissioning effects to be assessed, however, it 
may be that in practice all or part of the Project operates for a longer period 
30 
 
of time than this. Following the end of the operational life of the Generating 
Equipment, it would be decommissioned. 
Decommissioning 
3.3.8 
Decommissioning would comprise the removal of all Generating Equipment 
plant items and restoration of the Generating Equipment Site to a similar 
condition compared to before the commencement of construction. This 
process would also take approximately 22 months.  A requirement has been 
inserted into the DCO to require the decommissioning of the Generating 
Equipment site if it ceases to be used for an extended period. 
3.3.9 
It is important to note that elements of both the Electrical Connection and 
Gas Connection will be owned and operated by National Grid.  In accordance 
with its statutory duties, National Grid may use these assets in the future as 
part of its wider network. As such, the date of any decommissioning cannot 
be certain and the 25 years working assumption has been used simply to 
allow for an assessment of decommissioning effects in the ES. In addition, 
elements of the Gas Connection and Electrical Connection may be left in situ 
as this is likely to cause less environmental effects than removal.  This would 
be the case for the Pipeline and underground cables, for example. 
3.4 
Planning History 
3.4.1 
Prior to the commencement of clay extraction, the area around the Marston 
Vale largely comprised open agricultural fields; however since the 1960s the 
area has been subject to clay extraction, primarily for use in the brick industry.  
Some of these areas have now been restored for amenity use or landfill, 
whilst others are in the process of being restored, notably through the Low-
Level Restoration Scheme (LLRS) at Rookery Pit. 
Rookery Pit 
Low-Level Restoration Scheme (LLRS) 
3.4.2 
In 1980, Bedfordshire County Council granted planning permission at land in 
the Marston Vale (incorporating Rookery Pit) for ‘new brickworks at 
Stewartby to replace the existing Stewartby Works and the excavation of clay 
for the new and existing brickworks, and landscaping works’ (Planning 
Permission Ref: 4/1980) (Appendix 1).  The planning permission included a 
condition requiring the site to be restored upon completion of clay extraction 
by either: i) landfill to the original lower levels; ii) restoration at a lower level, 
or iii) the creation of lakes. 
3.4.3 
In accordance with The Environment Act 1995 – which established a 
procedure for reviewing mineral planning permissions and updating planning 
conditions (a process known as ‘ROMP’ – Review of Old Mineral 
Permissions) – a ROMP application for a restoration scheme was initially 
submitted by O&H Properties at Rookery Pit in 2000 (Ref: BC/CM/2000/8).  
3.4.4 
The ROMP application was linked to a separate planning application, 
submitted later in 2000, for the infilling of Rookery South Pit to original ground 
31 
 
levels by way of landfill (Ref: 01/00095/CM).  The ROMP application was held 
in abeyance pending the outcome of the landfill restoration application. 
Following the refusal of the landfill restoration application by the SoS in 
January 2003, the ROMP application remained undetermined. 
3.4.5 
The ROMP application remained undetermined until the introduction in July 
2008 of The Town and Country Planning (Environmental Impact 
Assessment) (Minerals Permissions and Amendment) Regulations (England) 
2008, which allowed an EIA to be undertaken to inform an undetermined 
ROMP application.   
3.4.6 
By this stage, the development options for the site had been re-evaluated 
and the site was being promoted for lower-level restoration.  O&H Properties 
submitted an ES for the proposed low-level restoration scheme (LLRS), 
together with an updated schedule of planning conditions in 2009.  The 
ROMP application was granted planning permission by Central Bedfordshire 
Council in December 2010 (Appendix 2). 
3.4.7 
The proposed LLRS seeks to restore former clay workings and enhance the 
degraded landscape in the Marston Vale, through the restoration of the 
Rookery South Pit to low intensity agricultural use and measures to enhance 
biodiversity and the landscape. 
3.4.8 
More specifically, the LLRS works for Rookery South Pit which form part of 
the baseline for the ES (Document Reference 6.1) comprise: 
 The re-profiling of the base of the pit involving the extraction of soils 
and clays from the permitted extraction area on the southern side with 
regrading of the base of the pit to an approximate level of 15mbgl; 
 Implementation of surface water drainage measures and construction 
of an attenuation pond and pumping station in order to facilitate a 
managed surface water drainage strategy; 
 A landscape strategy to include planting on boundary of the Rookery 
South Pit and the margins of the attenuation pond;  
 Provision of buttresses to the southern, eastern and northern slopes 
to ensure the long-term stability of those slopes, and re-grading 
through excavation; 
 Provision of a series of permissive footpaths around the perimeter of 
Rookery North Pit and around the attenuation pond within Rookery 
South Pit; 
 
 Provision of an access ramp into Rookery South Pit from Rookery 
North Pit which connects to Green Lane, Stewartby via an existing 
track along the western side of Rookery North Pit. Note that the ramp 
and existing track are both of an agricultural standard; and 
32 
 
 Provision of a further, smaller access track into and out of Rookery 
South Pit from the south side of the pit connecting with Station Lane, 
near Millbrook Station.     
3.4.9 
An indicative scheme plan of the proposed LLRS works is contained in Figure 
3.4 below. 
Figure 3-4 LLRS Indicative Scheme Plan 
 
3.4.10 
As shown in Figures 3.1, 3.2 and 3.4, the LLRS works include Rookery South 
Pit and therefore cover the Project Site; however, the LLRS works are 
independent from the Project proposals.  As set out in section 3.3 of this 
33 
 
Planning Statement, an option agreement has been put in place between 
MPL and the landowner of Rookery Pit such that relevant elements of the 
LLRS will be completed prior to the commencement of the development of 
the Project (anticipated to be in 2020), with the possible exception of 
buttressing and re-profiling to the eastern side of the pit.  Once the LLRS 
works are completed, Rookery South Pit will be approximately 15 m below 
the surrounding ground level in the vicinity of the Generating Equipment Site 
and Laydown Area. 
3.4.11 
The LLRS has four phases of works involving extraction of clay from a 
previously unworked area to be used in the pit for the purposes of re-profiling. 
On completion the pit is intended to have a drainage system installed in 
accordance with approved details. This system is intended to drain the 
restored pit into an internal balancing pond. 
3.4.12 
Works to implement the LLRS commenced and are ongoing. 
3.4.13 
The Rookery South RRF project would need to make alterations to the 
approved LLRS drainage scheme and the Rookery South (Resource 
Recovery Facility) Order 2011 (the "RRF Order") Order allows this to occur. 
This Project is also designed to allow amendments to the site drainage 
scheme in order to facilitate the implementation of that scheme. 
Rookery South RRF Project 
3.4.14 
The Rookery South RRF Project, promoted by Covanta, was granted 
development consent pursuant to the Planning Act 2008 by virtue of the RRF 
Order.  
3.4.15 
The main component of the RRF comprises an Energy-from-Waste (EfW) 
Facility. The application to the IPC also sought consent for associated 
developments, including:  
 The post-treatment MRF; 
 The provision of a drainage channel;  
 The extension of the attenuation pond to be constructed in Rookery 
South Pit by the LLRS;  
 An underground connection to the electricity grid allowing the export and 
import of electrical power;  
 Works for the creation of an upgraded site access and new junction on 
Green Lane and at the internal entrance to the Marston Vale Millennium 
Park; 
 Improvements to Green Lane between its junction with footpath 4 and 
Stewartby Lake, including footway improvements; and  
 An improvement to the Green Lane level crossing, including the 
installation of full automatic barriers. 
34 
 
3.4.16 
The EfW facility is located in Rookery South Pit and MPL has an interest in 
certain parts of the land that is covered by the RRF DCO, through an option 
granted to it by the landowner, O&H Properties Limited (O&H). Accordingly, 
the cumulative impacts of the Project with the Rookery South RRF Project 
development have been considered in the ES (Document Reference 6.1). 
3.4.17 
Following submission, the Rookery South RRF Project became the focus of 
legal challenge. Accordingly, the IPC announced their decision that 
development consent should be granted in October 2011, subject to a 
Special Parliamentary Procedure to hear the petitions that had been 
submitted.   
3.4.18 
A Joint Committee Report was published by an appointed Committee on 13th 
February 2013, which concluded that there was no case for Covanta Rookery 
South Ltd to answer in respect of the petitions of general objection.  
Subsequently the DCO came into force on 28th February 2013.  The RRF 
Order was formally issued on 25th March 2013 (Appendix 4) with a signed 
s106 agreement. Schedule 1 Part 2 (1) of the DCO (‘Time limits’) sets out a 
requirement that, “The authorised development may commence no later than 
the expiration of 5 years beginning with the date that this Order comes into 
force.” 
3.4.19 
FCC Environment Ltd challenged the Order on the grounds that the decision 
to award compulsory acquisition powers was flawed and that the SoS had 
failed to consider whether it was necessary to update available environmental 
information. However, in February 2014, the judicial review was dismissed 
by a High Court judge. 
3.4.20 
FCC Environment Ltd subsequently challenged the High Court judgement; 
however, the challenge was dismissed by the Court of Appeal on 5th February 
2015.  
3.4.21 
MPL confirms that the Project has taken account of the extant consent for the 
Rookery South RRF Project. The ES (Document Reference 6.1) explains 
how the Rookery South RRF Project was considered for EIA purposes. 
3.4.22 
The Project Site and the Order limits for the Project Site (the Order limits are 
defined in the draft Development Consent Order (Document Reference 3.1) 
as being defined on the Works Plans (Document Reference 2.6)) sit within 
part of the order limits for the RRF Order. This means that there is the 
potential for overlap and inconsistent powers between the two DCOs. 
However, MPL have engaged with Covanta through the development of the 
Project and have suggested a number of ways in which the two schemes 
may potentially interact and put forward solutions to any overlap issues that 
can be delivered through the draft Order for the MPL Project (and the 
documents that accompany that Order). Therefore, MPL is satisfied that the 
two projects would be capable of coexisting should both be constructed and 
operated and positive discussions between the two parties will continue. MPL 
has prepared a position statement providing further information on this matter 
which is provided in Appendix 5 of this Statement. 
35 
 
Landfill and Integrated Waste Management Operations 
3.4.23 
In August 2013, O&H Properties submitted a request for a Scoping Opinion 
to Central Bedfordshire Council in respect of proposed landfill and integrated 
waste 
management 
operations 
at 
Rookery 
South 
Pit 
(ref: 
CB/13/02695/SCO).  The request noted the applicant’s intention to submit a 
full application for a range of integrated waste management facilities, 
including: 
 Non-hazardous landfill; 
 Hazardous waste landfill cell; 
 Construction and Demolition (C&D) Waste Recycling Facility; 
 Soil Treatment Centre; 
 Materials Recovery Facility (MRF); 
 Waste Electrical and Electronic Equipment (WEEE) Recycling; 
 Anaerobic Digestion (AD); and  
 Hazardous Waste Recycling and Bulking 
3.4.24 
The request for a Scoping Opinion included an indicative masterplan of the 
proposed landfill and integrated waste management site, as shown in Figure 
3.5 below.  As shown in Figures 3.1 and 3.5, the proposed landfill and 
integrated waste management development would occupy land at the Project 
Site.   
3.4.25 
Accordingly, the cumulative impacts of the Project with the proposed landfill 
and integrated waste management operations development have been 
considered in the ES (Document Reference 6.1). 
36 
 
Figure 3-5 Indicative Masterplan of O&H Properties’ proposed landfill and integrated waste management operations 
 
3.4.26 
Central Bedfordshire Council formally issued a Scoping Opinion on 5th 
September 2013 (Ref: CB/13/02695/SCO) (Appendix 3).  The Scoping 
Opinion set out the Council’s view that an EIA should consider the following 
subject areas: geology and ground conditions; landscape and visual impact; 
air quality and dust; noise and vibration; traffic and transport; ecology; 
hydrology, hydrogeology and drainage; and cultural heritage and 
archaeology.  It was also advised that an alternative site assessment is 
37 
 
undertaken, and that the cumulative impact of the Covanta development and 
the proposed development should be considered. 
MPL EIA Scoping 
3.4.27 
A request for an EIA Scoping Opinion, accompanied by an EIA Scoping 
Report for the Project, was submitted by MPL to PINS on 19th June 2014 
under the EIA Regulations. 
3.4.28 
The Scoping Report provided an introduction to the Project, including its need 
and benefits, the developer, the consenting regime and EIA process. It set 
out the intended scope and structure of the ES as well as detailed 
descriptions of the assessments proposed in order to understand the likely 
significant environmental effects of the Project. The Scoping Report set out 
MPL’s intention to assess the construction, operational and decommissioning 
phases of the Project. 
3.4.29 
An explanation of the technology, the technical studies and optioneering 
undertaken to date and indicative dimensions were provided for the Project 
description (and where options existed, for each option). 
3.4.30 
A Scoping Opinion was received from PINS on 28th July 2014, as referred to 
within the Consultation Report (Document Reference 5.1) and as appended 
to the ES (Document Reference 6.1). 
Surrounding Area 
3.4.31 
The wider area around the Project Site has been subject to a number of 
recent development proposals, which provide context for the Project and 
which are detailed below. 
The Forest Centre and Millennium Country Park 
3.4.32 
Marston Vale Community Forest submitted an application to Mid-
Bedfordshire District Council in June 1997 for the creation of the Marston 
Vale Millennium Country Park and Forest Centre (Ref: MB/97/00807), 
located outside of and adjacent to the west of the Project Site boundary.  The 
proposed development comprised the creation of a cycle path and horsetrail 
around the perimeter of the site, the creation of wetland habitat, a proposed 
visitor centre (including one wardens’ flat) and associated car parking and 
access.  Planning permission was granted by Mid Bedfordshire District 
Council in November 1997. 
3.4.33 
A planning application was submitted by the Marston Vale Trust in November 
2011 for the erection of a wind turbine up to 120.5m in height and ancillary 
infrastructure in the Country Park (Ref: CB/11/04077/FULL).  Planning 
permission for this application was granted in February 2012 and it has now 
been constructed. 
 
 
38 
 
The Brogborough Wind Energy Project  
3.4.34 
In March 2014, FCC Environment Ltd submitted an application to Central 
Bedfordshire Council for a wind energy development – comprising 6 wind 
turbines with associated access roads, control buildings and transformers – 
at Brogborough landfill site, approximately 4km from the Project Site 
boundary (CB/14/00925/FULL).  The application was subsequently refused 
in July 2014. The reasons for refusal include:  
 the impact on the landscape character of the Marston Vale and the 
Greensand and Clay Ridges; 
 the detrimental impact on the visual amenity of nearby properties 
within Cranfield;  
 adverse noise impact on the area where predicted turbine noise is in 
great excess of existing background noise levels; 
 the impact on the historic environment and on a number of designated 
heritage assets of the highest significance; 
 the lack of information required to adequately assess the degree of 
impact on and conflict with the existing approved restoration scheme 
for the landfill site and how the identified effects would be mitigated; 
and, 
 the lack of an assessment as to whether the proposed turbines on the 
eastern boundary of the landfill site would prejudice future 
development of the strategic waste management site allocation 
identified for waste recovery uses. 
3.4.35 
An appeal against the refusal of planning permission was not subsequently 
submitted within the required 6-month period, and as such the applicant is 
therefore no longer able to appeal the decision. 
Land at Moreteyne Farm at Wood End in Marston Moretaine 
3.4.36 
Land at Moreteyne Farm has been allocated for residential development 
under Policy MA4 of the Central Bedfordshire Site Allocations DPD (2011). 
This policy allocates land (approximately 1.5km to the west of the Project Site 
boundary) for a mixed-use phased development, comprising residential 
development of 125 dwellings, 7ha of employment land for B1, B2 and B8 
uses, and land reserved for contingency housing provision of 320 dwellings. 
3.4.37 
In December 2011, an outline planning application was submitted to Central 
Bedfordshire Council by Hallam Land Management for a mixed use 
development comprising up to 125 new dwellings (including affordable 
housing), employment uses (class B1 and B8), allotments, landscaping, 
balancing ponds and amenity space (Ref: CB/11/04445/OUT).  Planning 
permission was granted by the Council in September 2013.  The location of 
39 
 
the proposed mixed-use development site for which outline permission was 
granted, in relation to the Project Site, is shown in Figure 3.6 below. 
3.4.38 
A subsequent reserved matters application, pursuant to CB/11/04445/OUT, 
was submitted by Bovis Homes to the Council in November 2014 for approval 
of the appearance, landscaping, scale and layout of the residential 
development. 
3.4.39 
In November 2014, an EIA Screening Opinion was submitted by Hallam Land 
Management for a mixed use development comprising of housing, a care 
home and commercial/community units (Ref: CB/14/04319/SCN), at land 
adjacent to the consented outline application, approximately 1.5km from the 
Project Site boundary.  Central Bedfordshire Council issued a formal Scoping 
Opinion on 14th November 2014 stating that an EIA Screening Opinion was 
not required. The location of the proposed mixed-use development site for 
which a Screening Opinion was sought, in relation to the Project Site, is 
shown in Figure 3.6 below.

Land at Warren Farm, Flitwick Road, Ampthill 
3.4.40 
Policy HA4 of the Central Bedfordshire Site Allocations Development Plan 
Document allocates the land west of Abbey Lane, Ampthill (approximately 
2.5km to the south-east of the Project Site boundary) (also known as Warren 
Farm) for residential development of a minimum of 410 dwellings. 
3.4.41 
In April 2012, Connolly Homes and Denison Investments Ltd submitted an 
outline application for the development of up to 410 dwellings, together with 
open 
space, 
accesses 
and 
surface 
water 
retention 
basin 
(CB/12/01496/OUT).  Planning permission was granted in October 2013. The 
location of the proposed residential development site for which outline 
40 
 
planning permission was granted, in relation to the Project Site, is shown in 
Figure 3.7 below. 
Figure 3-7 Location of proposed development at land at Warren Farm in relation to the Project Site 
 
Land East and West of Broadmead Road, Stewartby  
3.4.42 
In August 1997, O&H Properties Ltd submitted an outline application to 
Bedford Borough Council for comprehensive redevelopment, including 
residential, employment, shop, public house, roads and open space, at land 
east and west of Broadmead Road, Stewartby (Ref: 97/01163/OUT), 
approximately 1km to the north of the Project Site boundary.  Planning 
permission was formally granted by the Council, with a signed s106 
agreement, in August 2009. 
3.4.43 
A subsequent reserved matters application, pursuant to 97/01163/OUT, for 
phase 1 infrastructure of the consented development, was submitted by O&H 
Properties Ltd in May 2013.  Planning permission was granted in September 
2013.  The location of the proposed development for which outline planning 
permission and subsequent reserved matters planning permission was 
granted, in relation to the Project Site, is shown in Figure 3.8 below.

Bedfordshire County Council, Mid-Bedfordshire District Council and Bedford 
Borough Council adopted a Planning and Development Brief in September 
1999 for a new settlement at Elstow Storage Depot to accommodate c.10,000 
people.   
3.4.45 
It is envisaged that Wixams new settlement will include a town centre and 
several villages with 4500 homes, employment land, schools, shops, 
landscaping and recreational space such as sports pitches and allotments 
and community buildings. The location of Wixams new settlement is 3 miles 
south of Bedford and approximately 5km to the north-east of the Project Site 
boundary. 
3.4.46 
In November 1999, Gallagher and RWE Npower submitted a joint venture 
outline application for built development consisting of building and 
engineering works for a mixed use development of residential, employment, 
retail (A1, A2, A3) leisure and community uses, open space and associated 
uses together with supporting infrastructure (roads, paths, cycleways, 
pumping stations, electricity substations), public transport, interchange and 
car parking (Ref: 99/01645/OUT).  Planning permission was formally granted 
by the Council, with a signed s106 agreement, in June 2006.  A series of 
reserved matters applications and applications to discharge planning 
conditions have subsequently been submitted and approved.  The 
construction of the new settlement is now progressing.  The location of the 
proposed development for which outline planning permission and 
subsequent reserved matters planning permissions were granted, in relation 
to the Project Site, is shown in Figure 3.9 below.

The Need for the Project 
4.1 
Overview 
4.1.1 
This section sets out why the Project is needed, as a viable proposal to 
contribute towards greater reliability of electricity supply in the UK. Given that 
this Planning Statement provides confirmation that, in MPL's view, the 
adverse impacts of the Project do not outweigh its benefits (see s104(7)), it 
is important to consider the need for the Project (and the NPS position on 
need for nationally significant energy projects more generally).  
4.1.2 
When determining an application for a DCO the SoS must have regard to, 
inter alia, any relevant NPSs designated in respect of that type of 
infrastructure (s.104 of the 2008 Act). S104(3) makes clear that the SoS must 
decide an application in accordance with any relevant NPS, except to the 
extent that particular circumstances apply (including where the SoS is 
satisfied that the adverse impact of a development would outweigh its 
benefits). 
4.1.3 
The overarching NPS for Energy is NPS EN-1 which sets out national policy 
for energy infrastructure and explains the UK-wide need for such 
infrastructure.  NPS EN-2, EN-4 and EN-5 are also relevant NPSs for this 
Project. 
4.2 
The Need for Flexible Gas Fired Power Station Infrastructure 
National Policy Statements (NPSs) 
4.2.1 
Section 3 of NPS EN-1 re-affirms the transitional role of new gas generation, 
confirms that a diverse energy mix is required and that there is a significant 
need for new energy generation infrastructure to replace capacity that will be 
lost through the closure of existing large coal plants. Indeed it states that the 
decision-maker should: “…start with a presumption in favour of granting 
consent to applications for energy NSIPs” (paragraph 4.1.2).   
4.2.2 
Paragraph 3.1.3 of NPS EN-1 states that the SoS should “assess all 
applications for development consent for the types of infrastructure covered 
by the energy NPSs on the basis that the Government has demonstrated that 
there is a need for those types of infrastructure...” Paragraph 3.1.4 of NPS 
EN-1 states that “The [SoS] should give substantial weight to the 
contribution which projects would make towards satisfying this need when 
considering applications for development consent under the Planning Act 
2008” [emphasis added]. 
4.2.3 
Paragraph 3.3.1 of NPS EN-1 acknowledges that, “Electricity meets a 
significant proportion of our overall energy needs and our reliance on it is 
likely to increase…”  Paragraph 3.6.1 of NPS EN-1 confirms that gas 
generation will play an important role in the UK's energy mix, stating that: 
"Fossil fuel power stations play a vital role in providing reliable electricity 
supplies: they can be operated flexibly in response to changes in supply and 
demand, and provide diversity in our energy mix. They will continue to play 
44 
 
an important role in our energy mix as the UK makes the transition to a low 
carbon economy..."  
4.2.4 
Similarly, Paragraph 1.1.1 of NPS EN-2 states “Fossil fuel generating stations 
play a vital role in providing reliable electricity supplies and a secure and 
diverse energy mix as the UK makes the transition to a low carbon 
economy…” 
4.2.5 
NPS EN-1 therefore establishes the general need case for energy NSIPs, 
including energy produced by gas generation.  
4.2.6 
NPS EN-2 does not repeat or add to the need case set out in NPS EN-1, but 
provides additional policy criteria and assessment principles relevant to fossil 
fuel generating stations.  Notably, Paragraph 2.2.1 of EN-2 states that: “…the 
Government does not seek to direct applicants to particular sites for fossil 
fuel generating stations”.  
Other Government Policy 
4.2.7 
The NPSs have been informed by and followed by other government policy 
and evidence as to the need for viable proposals to contribute towards 
greater reliability of electricity supply in the UK.  
4.2.8 
To ensure that there is reliability of supply, it is Government policy that the 
electricity generation mix needs to incorporate a balance of technologies that 
continuously and reliably produce stable and controllable power and that 
within this scenario, gas-fuelled electricity generating technologies can play 
a significant role. In the Annual Energy Statement (AES) (latest version 
published October 2014), the Department of Energy and Climate Change 
(DECC) (now BEIS) supported the role of gas in the energy sector and 
directed the need to build new power generation infrastructure.  
4.2.9 
The AES identifies the need to retain sufficient power generation capacity 
following the rapid closure of existing capacity, and acknowledges the role of 
gas in the energy sector.  The Statement also sets out the Government’s 
long-term direction for reducing energy demand and safeguarding energy 
security, by increasing the proportion of energy from renewable and low 
carbon sources. 
4.2.10 
The ‘Electricity Market Reform White Paper – Planning our electric future: a 
White Paper for secure, affordable and low-carbon electricity’ (DECC, 2011) 
“sets out the Government’s commitment to transform the UK’s electricity 
system to ensure that our future electricity supply is secure, low-carbon and 
affordable” (paragraph 1). A key part of this wide ranging reform is the 
introduction of a ‘Capacity Mechanism’ in order “to guarantee future security 
of electricity supply as a quarter of ageing plant closes during this decade 
and the proportion of intermittent or less flexible low-carbon generation rises” 
(paragraph 1.35). 
4.2.11 
The White Paper sets out, at page 24, a vision for the Electricity System 
following reform, in which it is stated, “The electricity grid has evolved to 
45 
 
accommodate more localised and intermittent sources of generation, as well 
as being smarter and more responsive.” A significant focus of the White 
Paper is to decarbonise electricity generation in the long term, although it is 
acknowledged at paragraph 2.4.23 that, “Whilst we are going to need new, 
unabated gas in the next few years, we recognise that, in the longer term, it 
is likely that emissions from gas plant will need to reduce if we are to largely 
decarbonise the electricity sector and meet our climate change targets.” 
4.2.12 
‘The Carbon Plan - delivering our low carbon future’ (HM Government, 2011) 
sets out the Coalition Government’s policies for how the UK will achieve 
decarbonisation within the framework of its energy policy; making the 
transition to low carbon economy while maintaining energy security, and 
minimising costs to customers. Paragraph 2.146 of the Plan recognises that 
the nature of the electricity network will need to change so that it becomes 
smarter at balancing demand and supply as generation/supply become more 
intermittent and demand increases. In light of this the Plan states that on the 
way to 2050, some flexible fossil fuel plant is likely to be needed to ensure 
security of supply. Paragraph 2.147 states that “over the next decade, the UK 
will need to invest in new generation capacity to replace the coal and nuclear 
power stations that are set to close by the early 2020s in order to maintain 
our energy security, while meeting our legal commitments to reduce carbon 
emissions and increase renewable electricity generation.” Paragraph 2.148 
goes on to outline that to do this, the coming years will see a continuation of 
previous trends, which will include more switching from coal to gas-powered 
generation. Thus the Carbon Plan reinforces the position set out in the White 
Paper and acknowledges that to meet our energy security needs and make 
the transition to a low carbon economy, gas will continue to play a valuable 
role. 
4.2.13 
‘Electricity System: Assessment of Future Challenges – Annex (DECC, 
August 2012)’ seeks to fully understand the implications of the challenges 
posed by moving to an energy mix with a greater proportion of intermittent 
and less flexible generation and identify means of addressing them. The 
overall aim is to ensure that the electricity system can facilitate future low 
carbon generation and expected increases in electricity demand in the most 
secure and affordable way, with the most efficient use of assets. Again, there 
is acknowledgement of the continued role for unabated gas fired generating 
plant. Paragraph 3.8 states that over the next two decades, gas will continue 
to play a key role in the UK’s energy mix alongside other lower carbon 
electricity sources. The paragraph goes on to state that new gas generation 
capacity will be needed to ensure security of supply, and to balance the 
electricity system as more low carbon technology become available.  
4.2.14 
The ‘Electricity Capacity Assessment’ (Ofgem, June 2014) assesses the 
risks to the security of Britain’s electricity supply over the winters 2014/15 to 
2018/19.  The report states that there is expected to be a reduction in 
electricity supply over the next two winters as a result of a reduction in 
supplies from conventional generation.  There has also been a recent 
reduction in demand due to: energy efficiency measures; an increase in 
generation connected to distribution networks; and demand reduction by the 
industrial and commercial sectors.  However, the report finds that the 
46 
 
decrease in demand has been offset by a greater reduction in available 
electricity supply than previously expected. 
4.2.15 
The ‘Gas Generation Strategy’ (DECC, December 2012) consolidates the 
range of government policy as set out above in setting out the important role 
for gas generation. It is stated that as a reliable, flexible source of electricity 
it will play a part in any future generation mix, supporting a secure, low-
carbon and affordable electricity system. It states that “Gas currently forms 
an integral part of the UK’s generation mix and is a reliable, flexible source 
of electricity. Using gas as a fuel in our power stations currently provides a 
significant proportion of our electricity generation (around 40% in 2011)” 
(Executive Summary). Moreover, it suggests that there could be as much as 
26 gigawatts (GW) of new gas generation infrastructure required if the 
decarbonisation target is set at 200g/CO2/kWh. It also indicates that in 2030 
we could need more overall gas capacity than we have today, although 
operating at lower load factors, reflecting the role of ‘peaking’ plant in backing 
up intermittent sources of energy generation. “The modelling shows that gas 
could play a more extensive role, with higher load factors, should the 4th 
Carbon Budget be revised upwards” (Executive Summary). The strategy also 
presents scenarios at Table 2B on page 22 which indicate that up to 41 GW 
of new gas generation capacity will be needed by 2030 to underpin long term 
electricity supplies and provide back-up to nuclear and wind generation at 
times of peak demand. 
4.2.16 
The National Infrastructure Plan (HM Treasury, December 2014) provides 
explicit support for this type of project, stating: “New gas plant is also needed 
and will be vital in supplying a backup for less flexible renewable generation 
and ensuring that the system can meet peak electricity demand” (Paragraph 
8.4).  Paragraph 8.3 adds that, “Large-scale investment in gas and low-
carbon electricity generation is vital in order to replace ageing energy 
infrastructure, maintain secure energy supplies and meet legally-binding 
environmental targets.” 
4.2.17 
The NPPF also establishes a need for low carbon energy sources.  
Paragraph 97 of the NPPF states that to help increase the use and supply of 
renewable and low carbon energy, local planning authorities should 
recognise the responsibility on all communities to contribute to energy 
generation from renewable or low carbon sources. Consequently, local 
planning authorities should “consider identifying suitable areas for renewable 
and low carbon energy sources, and supporting infrastructure, where this 
would help secure the development of such sources”, and “identify 
opportunities where development can draw its energy supply from 
decentralised, renewable or low carbon energy supply systems”.  
4.2.18 
In addition, Paragraph 162 of the NPPF states that local planning authorities 
should take account of the need for strategic infrastructure including 
nationally significant infrastructure within their areas.  
4.2.19 
In October 2016, The Energy and Climate Change Committee published The 
energy revolution and future challenges for UK energy and climate change 
policy — Third Report of Session 2016–17 (October 2016). The report 
47 
 
reflects on upcoming challenges for UK energy and climate policy. For energy 
supply it states that “The Government should seek to build investor 
confidence, to avoid exacerbating difficulties in bringing forward investment 
in new electricity capacity and new indigenous resources. The Government 
should also examine the role of the ‘solidarity principle’ in managing potential 
gas crises, specifically how the UK can continue to participate. If excluded 
from the ‘solidarity principle’ the UK Government must urgently investigate 
alternative back-up arrangements to ensure security of supply in the event of 
a crisis” (Paragraph 111). 
4.3 
Discussion 
4.3.1 
It can be seen that an array of government policy, both at a local level and 
UK-wide acknowledges the need for the electricity generation mix to 
incorporate a balance of technologies that reliably produce stable and 
controllable power during the transition to a low carbon economy. 
4.3.2 
The role of gas-fuelled electricity generating technologies is acknowledged 
throughout, with recognition given to the flexibility of gas generation in 
meeting ‘peak’ loads and enabling the grid to accommodate more 
intermittent, low carbon sources such as wind generation. This need is UK-
wide due to the national electricity system and the wide dispersal of 
intermittent sources. 
4.3.3 
At present, peaking capacity in the UK is relatively small due to the nature of 
the electricity generation mix on the National Grid. Although recently there 
has been a significant increase in the number of proposals for flexible / 
peaking plant in the UK, a large proportion of these are focussed on small 
capacity (c 20MWe) liquid fuel fired plants. 
4.3.4 
Moreover, there are thought to be limitations as to the suitability of the 
existing fleet of older gas fired plants for peak load operation (Electricity 
Market Reform White Paper – Planning our electric future: a White Paper for 
secure, affordable and low-carbon electricity’, DECC, 2011). It is recognised 
at page 28 of the White Paper that “frequent stop/start and fast ramp-up 
operations do have a significant impact on maintenance costs”. The detailed 
implementation proposals for the Capacity Mechanism may impose penalties 
for poor performance that is likely to limit the likely viability of plant with long 
ramp-up times or prone to unreliability in participating. 
4.3.5 
In conclusion, there is clearly a significant requirement for further gas 
generation capacity to provide reliable, peaking generation. The 
development of the Project, a dedicated gas fired peaking plant and electrical 
and gas connections, would allow for the rapid, reliable and viable provision 
of reserve capacity to the National Grid, supporting the transition to a low 
carbon economy by balancing some of the considerable scale of intermittent 
sources such as wind being developed UK-wide, and playing an important 
role in meeting the UK’s national energy requirements.

Planning Policy Context 
5.1 
Overview 
5.1.1 
This section sets out the relevant planning policies and guidance relevant to 
the Project, including reference to relevant planning guidance primarily 
contained with NPS EN-1, EN-2, EN-4 and EN-5, as well as the National 
Planning Policy Framework (NPPF), National Planning Policy Guidance 
(NPPG) and relevant local planning policy adopted or being prepared by 
Central Bedfordshire Council and Bedford Borough Council. 
5.1.2 
An assessment of the Project, in respect of the relevant planning policies and 
guidance contained within this section of the Planning Statement, is provided 
in section 6 of the Planning Statement. 
5.2 
The Planning Act 2008 and the Localism Act 2011 
5.2.1 
The process for considering proposed NSIPs was established by the 
Planning Act 2008, as amended by the Localism Act 2011. 
5.2.2 
Under the Localism Act 2011 PINS became the agency responsible for 
operating the planning process for NSIPs (previously, it had this role whilst 
also being the decision maker). As the Examining Authority (ExA), PINS 
conducts certain pre-application and application procedures (such as EIA 
Scoping consultation and conducting acceptance checks when the DCO 
Application is submitted) and the examination. 
5.2.3 
The examination is a predominantly written process led either by a single 
appointed person or a panel, who submit a report with their recommendation 
on an application to the relevant SoS who will take the final decision as to 
whether to make a DCO for a proposed project and in what terms. The 
relevant SoS for the Project is the SoS for Business, Energy & Industrial 
Strategy. 
5.2.4 
Section 104 of the PA 2008 provides that in making decisions on applications, 
the SoS must have regard (amongst certain other documents and matters) 
to any relevant NPS and must decide applications in accordance with such 
relevant NPS(s) unless the adverse impacts of the proposal would outweigh 
its benefits (or in certain other limited circumstances).  The NPSs relevant to 
this Application are NPS EN-1, NPS EN-2, NPS EN-4 and NPS EN-5, as set 
out below in section 5.3. 
5.2.5 
Section 104 of the PA 2008 also requires the SoS to have regard to any Local 
Impact Report and other matters which the SoS “thinks are both important 
and relevant to [the SoS’s] decision”.  Other national and local planning policy 
which may be relevant to this Application is set out in sections 5.4 and 5.5 
below. 
49 
 
5.3 
National Policy Statements 
5.3.1 
The Department for Energy and Climate Change (DECC) published 6 
National Policy Statements (NPS) for Energy in 2011: 
 Overarching National Policy Statement for Energy (EN-1); 
 National Policy Statement for Fossil Fuel Electricity Generating 
Infrastructure (EN-2); 
 National Policy Statement for Renewable Energy Infrastructure (EN-
3); 
 National Policy Statement for Gas Supply Infrastructure and Gas and 
Oil Pipelines (EN-4); 
 National Policy Statement for Electricity Networks Infrastructure (EN-
5); 
 National Policy Statement for Nuclear Power Generation (EN-6) 
5.3.2 
NPS EN-1 is a relevant NPS for any energy NSIP, along with the relevant 
technology specific NPS.  For the DCO Application this includes NPS EN-2 
National Policy Statement for Fossil Fuel Electricity Generating Infrastructure 
and NPS EN-4 - National Policy Statement for Gas Supply Infrastructure. The 
majority of NPS EN-5 does not directly relate to the Project, since its electrical 
infrastructure is to be predominantly underground. However, NPS EN-5 is of 
relevance in respect of the substation and SECs and so is referred to where 
relevant in this document. 
Overarching National Policy Statement for Energy (EN-1) 
5.3.3 
NPS EN-1 sets out the Government’s overall policy towards the delivery of 
major energy infrastructure. 
5.3.4 
Paragraph 1.1.1 of NPS EN-1 states that ‘this NPS, when combined with the 
relevant technology-specific energy NPS, provides the primary basis for 
decisions’.  The relevant technology-specific energy NPS for this Application 
are NPS EN-2, EN-4 and EN-5 as set out below.  In addition, Paragraph 4.1.5 
of NPS EN-1 states that Development Plan Documents or other documents 
in the Local Development Framework may be both important and relevant 
considerations to SoS decision-making.  Local planning policy for Central 
Bedfordshire and Bedford Borough relevant to this Application is set out in 
section 5.4 below. 
5.3.5 
Section 3 of NPS EN-1 considers the need for new NSIPs, which is set out 
in section 4 of this Planning Statement.   
5.3.6 
Paragraph 3.1.3 of NPS EN-1 states that all development consent 
applications for energy infrastructure should be assessed ‘on the basis that 
the Government has demonstrated that there is a need for those types of 
infrastructure and that the scale and urgency of that need is as described for 
50 
 
each of them in this Part.’  Accordingly, the SoS ‘should give substantial 
weight to the contribution which projects would make towards satisfying this 
need when considering applications for development consent under the 
Planning Act 2008’ (paragraph 3.1.4) [emphasis added]. 
5.3.7 
Section 3.3 of NPS EN-1 sets out the key reasons why the Government 
believes there is an ‘urgent need’ for new electricity NSIPs (paragraph 3.3.1), 
including: 
 Meeting energy security and carbon reduction objectives; 
 The need to replace closing electricity generating capacity; 
 The need for more electricity capacity to support an increased supply 
from renewables; and, 
 Future increases in electricity demand. 
5.3.8 
Furthermore, paragraph 3.7.3 of NPS EN-1 stresses that new electricity 
network infrastructure projects add to the reliability of the national energy 
supply and provide crucial national benefits which are shared by all users of 
the system. 
5.3.9 
Whilst alternatives to the need for new large scale electricity infrastructure 
have been considered – including: reducing demand; more intelligent use of 
electricity; and interconnection of electricity systems – the Government 
believes that these measures will not be sufficient to meet energy and climate 
change objectives on their own (paragraph 3.3.25 of NPS EN-1).   
5.3.10 
Paragraph 3.6.1 of NPS EN-1 recognises the ‘vital role’ that fossil fuel power 
stations play in providing electricity supplies, and states that ‘they will 
continue to play an important role in our energy mix as the UK makes the 
transition to a low carbon economy.’ 
5.3.11 
Section 4 of NPS EN-1 sets out the general assessment principles by which 
applications relating to energy infrastructure are to be decided. The general 
assessment principles are considered in the context of the Project in section 
6 of this Planning Statement. 
5.3.12 
Paragraph 4.1.2 of NPS EN-1 states that, given the level and urgency of need 
for energy infrastructure, the SoS ‘should start with a presumption in favour 
of granting consent to applications for energy NSIPs.’ 
5.3.13 
Paragraph 4.1.3 of NPS EN-1 explains that the SoS will weigh up a 
proposal’s contribution to meeting the need for energy infrastructure, job 
creation and other long term and wider benefits, against the potential adverse 
impacts of the proposal in question including ‘any long-term and cumulative 
adverse impacts, as well as any measures to avoid, reduce or compensate 
for any adverse impacts.’ 
5.3.14 
Paragraph 4.1.4 of NPS EN-1 continues and explains that the SoS should 
take into account ‘environmental, social and economic benefits and adverse 
51 
 
impacts, at national, regional and local levels’ whether identified in the NPSs 
or elsewhere, including in local impact reports.  
5.3.15 
Paragraph 4.1.5 of NPS EN-1 states that other matters that the SoS may 
consider both important and relevant to its decision-making could include 
Development Plan Documents or other documents in the Local Development 
Framework and explains that, ‘in the event of a conflict between these or any 
other documents and an NPS, the NPS prevails.’  The documents included 
within the Local Development Frameworks for both Central Bedfordshire 
Council and Bedford Borough Council are referenced in section 5.5. 
5.3.16 
Paragraph 4.1.7 of NPS EN-1 confirms that the SoS will have regard to the 
guidance in Circular 11/95, as revised, on “The Use of Conditions in Planning 
Permissions” in agreeing or suggesting requirements in a DCO. Although that 
circular has in part been superseded by advice contained within NPPG 
(published in March 2014), the Applicant notes that the general advice 
remains essentially similar.  
5.3.17 
Paragraph 4.1.8 states that, “The [SoS] may take into account any 
development consent obligations that an applicant agrees with local 
authorities.”   
5.3.18 
Paragraph 4.1.9 of NPS EN-1 states that viability issues are unlikely to be of 
relevance to decision making providing that the technical feasibility of the 
proposal has been properly assessed, but limited exceptions exist and are 
set out in NPS EN-1 and others. 
5.3.19 
Paragraph 4.2.1 of NPS EN-1 advises that, ‘All proposals for projects that are 
subject to the European Environmental Impact Assessment Directive must 
be accompanied by an Environmental Statement describing the aspects of 
the environment likely to be significantly affected by the project.’ The 
Environmental Statement should include an assessment of the likely 
significant effects of the proposed project on the environment, including 
direct, indirect, secondary, cumulative, short, medium and long-term, 
permanent and temporary, positive and negative effects at all stages of the 
project.  Paragraph 4.2.3 of NPS EN-1 adds that ‘the ES should cover the 
environmental, social and economic effects arising from pre-construction, 
construction, operation and decommissioning of the project.’  When 
considering cumulative effects, Paragraph 4.2.5 of NPS EN-1 advises that 
the ES should provide information on how the effects of the proposal combine 
and interact with the effects of other development, including projects for 
which consent is sought or granted, as well as those already in existence.  
5.3.20 
In respect of Habitats and Species Regulations, paragraph 4.3.1 of NPS EN-
1 advises applicants to consult with Natural England and to subsequently 
undertake an Appropriate Assessment if required.   
5.3.21 
Paragraph 4.4.1 of NPS EN-1 notes that, “the relevance or otherwise to the 
decision-making process of the existence (or alleged existence) of 
alternatives to the proposed development is in the first instance a matter of 
law, detailed guidance on which falls outside the scope of this NPS.  From a 
52 
 
policy perspective NPS EN-1 does not contain any general requirement to 
consider alternatives or to establish whether the proposed project represents 
the best option.” However, paragraph 4.4.2 of NPS EN-1 states that 
applicants are obliged to include in their ES, as a matter of fact, information 
about the main alternatives that have been considered,, including the main 
reasons for the applicant’s choice, taking into account the environmental, 
social and economic effects.   
5.3.22 
Paragraph 4.5.1 of NPS EN-1 states that good design for energy 
infrastructure ‘should produce sustainable infrastructure sensitive to place, 
efficient in the use of natural resources and energy used in their construction 
and operation, matched by an appearance that demonstrates good aesthetic 
as far as possible.’  However, paragraph 4.5.1 also acknowledges that ‘the 
nature of much energy infrastructure development will often limit the extent 
to which it can contribute to the enhancement of the quality of the area.’  
5.3.23 
Paragraph 4.5.3 of NPS EN-1 seeks that proposals are “sustainable and, 
having regard to regulatory and other constraints, are as attractive, durable 
and adaptable (including taking account of natural hazards such as flooding) 
as they can be”.   Further, Paragraph 4.5.3 states that “Whilst the applicant 
may not have any or very limited choice in the physical appearance of some 
energy infrastructure, there may be opportunities for the applicant to 
demonstrate good design in terms of siting relative to existing landscape 
character, landform and vegetation.”  
5.3.24 
Paragraph 4.5.4 of NPS EN-1 seeks that applicants “demonstrate in their 
application documents how the design process was conducted and how the 
proposed design evolved. Where a number of different designs were 
considered, applicants should set out the reasons why the favoured choice 
has been selected”.  Further, paragraph 4.5.4 of NPS EN-1 notes that “in 
considering applications the [SoS] should take into account the ultimate 
purpose of the infrastructure and bear in mind the operational, safety and 
security requirements which the design has to satisfy.” 
5.3.25 
Paragraph 4.5.5 of NPS EN-1 states that “applicants are encouraged” to use 
design review services. 
5.3.26 
Paragraph 4.6.6 of NPS EN-1 states that, ‘Under guidelines issued by DECC 
(then DTI) in 2006, any application to develop a thermal generating station 
under Section 36 of the Electricity Act 1989 must either include CHP or 
contain evidence that the possibilities for CHP have been fully explored to 
inform the IPC’s consideration of the application.’  Further, paragraph 4.6.7 
of NPS EN-1 advises that the opportunities for CHP should be considered 
from the outset of the site selection process.  
5.3.27 
Section 4.7 of NPS EN-1 explains the considerations to be given to CCS and 
Carbon Capture and explains that all applications for new combustion plant 
which are of a generating capacity at or over 300MW and of a type covered 
by the EU’s Large Combustion Plant Directive (LCPD) should demonstrate 
that the plant is “Carbon Capture Ready” (CCR).  
53 
 
5.3.28 
Section 4.8 of EN-1 sets out considerations that applicants and the 
Examining Authority/SoS should take into account to help ensure that new 
energy infrastructure is resilient to climate change.  Paragraph 4.8.5 of NPS 
EN-1 advises that applicants ‘must consider the impacts of climate change 
when planning the location, design, build, operation and, where appropriate, 
decommissioning of new energy infrastructure.’   
5.3.29 
Paragraph 4.9.1 of NPS EN-1 advises applicants to consult the National Grid 
and to ensure that there is the necessary infrastructure and capacity within 
an existing or planned transmission or distribution network to accommodate 
the electricity generated.   
5.3.30 
Paragraph 4.10.1 of NPS EN-1 advises that ‘Issues relating to discharges or 
emissions from a proposed project which affect air quality, water quality, land 
quality and the marine environment, or which include noise and vibration may 
be subject to separate regulation under the pollution control framework or 
other consenting and licensing regimes.’     
5.3.31 
Paragraph 4.11.1 of NPS EN-1 advises applicants to consult with the HSE 
on matters relating to safety which are relevant to the construction, operation 
and decommissioning of energy infrastructure.  
5.3.32 
Paragraph 4.12.1 of NPS EN-1 explains that all establishments wishing to 
hold stock of hazardous substances above a threshold will require Hazardous 
Substances consent, and thus should consult the HSE at the pre-application 
stage.  
5.3.33 
Section 4.13 of NPS EN-1 advises that energy production has the potential 
to impact on health and wellbeing (paragraph 4.13.1), through increased 
traffic, air or water pollution, dust, odour, hazardous waste and substances, 
noise, exposure to radiation and increases in pests (paragraph 4.13.3).  
Accordingly, the ES should assess these effects and identify any measures 
to avoid, reduce or compensate for these impacts as appropriate (paragraph 
4.13.2).   
5.3.34 
Paragraph 4.14.2 of NPS EN-1 stresses the importance of considering 
possible sources of nuisance and how they may be mitigated or limited at the 
pre-application stage under section 79(1) of the Environmental Protection Act 
1990.  
5.3.35 
Paragraph 4.15.2 of NPS EN-1 outlines that ‘Government policy is to ensure 
that, where possible, proportionate protective security measures are 
designed into new infrastructure projects at an early stage in the project 
development.’  
5.3.36 
Part 5 of NPS EN-1 explains the potential impacts of energy infrastructure, in 
terms of: air quality and emissions; biodiversity and ecological conservation; 
civil and military aviation and defence interests; coastal change; dust, odour, 
artificial light, smoke, steam and insect infestation; flood risk; historic 
environment; landscape and visual; land use including open space, green 
54 
 
infrastructure and Green Belt; noise and vibration; socio-economic; traffic 
and transport; waste management; and water quality and resources. 
5.3.37 
Paragraph 5.2.1 of NPS EN-1 advises that the construction, operation and 
decommissioning of infrastructure development ‘can involve emissions to air 
which could lead to adverse impacts on health, on protected species and 
habitats, or on the wider countryside.’  Paragraph 5.2.7 of NPS EN-1 provides 
that the applicant should undertake an assessment as part of the ES, 
describing:  
 “any significant air emissions, their mitigation and any residual effects 
distinguishing between the project stages and taking account of any 
significant emissions from any road traffic generated by the project; 
 the predicted absolute emission levels of the proposed project, after 
mitigation methods have been applied; 
 existing air quality levels and the relative change in air quality from 
existing levels; and 
 any potential eutrophication impacts.” 
5.3.38 
With regard to biodiversity and geological conservation for EIA development, 
paragraph 5.3.3 of NPS EN-1 advises that the ES ‘clearly sets out any effects 
on internationally, nationally and locally designated sites of ecological or 
geological conservation importance, on protected species and on habitats 
and other species identified as being of principal importance for the 
conservation of biodiversity.’  Appropriate mitigation measures should be an 
integral part of the proposed development and should demonstrate that: 
activities are confined to the minimum areas required during construction; 
best practice is followed during construction and operation; habitats are 
restored after construction works where practicable; and opportunities are 
taken to enhance or create new habitats (paragraph 5.3.18).  
5.3.39 
Paragraph 5.4.1 of NPS EN-1 advises that civil and military aviation and 
defence interests can be affected by new energy development, and as such 
an assessment of potential effects should be set out within the ES (paragraph 
5.4.10).  In addition, the MoD, CAA, NATS and any aerodrome likely to be 
affected by the proposed development should be consulted (paragraph 
5.4.11).  
5.3.40 
Paragraph 5.6.1 of NPS EN-1 states that, ‘during the construction, operation 
and decommissioning of energy infrastructure there is potential for the 
release of a range of emissions such as odour, dust, steam, smoke, artificial 
light and infestation of insects.’  Accordingly, applicants are required to 
assess the potential for emissions and the impact on amenity in the ES, in 
particular: the type, quantity and timing of emissions; aspects giving rise to 
emissions; locations affected by the emissions; effects of the emissions on 
identified locations; and measures to be employed in preventing or mitigating 
emissions (paragraph 5.6.5).  Paragraph 5.6.11 advises that mitigation 
55 
 
measures may be provided in respect of engineering, lay-out or 
administration.  
5.3.41 
Paragraph 5.7.4 of NPS EN-1 states that application for energy projects of 
1ha or greater in Flood Zone 1 and all energy projects in Flood Zones 2 and 
3 should be accompanied by a Flood Risk Assessment (FRA).  Where 
necessary, paragraph 5.7.18 of NPS EN-1 advises that flood risk should be 
mitigated by making arrangements to manage surface water and the impact 
of the natural water cycle on people and property.  
5.3.42 
Paragraph 5.8.1 of NPS EN-1 advises that the construction, operation and 
decommissioning of energy infrastructure has the potential to result in 
adverse impacts on the historic environment.  Accordingly, the applicant is 
required to ‘provide a description of the significance of the heritage assets 
affected by the proposed development and the contribution of their setting to 
that significance’ (paragraph 5.8.8).  
5.3.43 
Paragraph 5.9.1 of NPS EN-1 acknowledges that the landscape and visual 
effects of energy projects will vary according to the type of development, its 
location and the landscape setting.  Paragraphs 5.9.5 – 5.9.7 advise that the 
applicant should carry out a landscape and visual impact assessment of the 
effects during construction and operation, including light pollution effects on 
local amenity and nature conservation.  Paragraph 5.9.21 notes that reducing 
the scale of the project can help to mitigate the landscape and visual impacts, 
however it is acknowledged that amending the design of proposed energy 
infrastructure may result in a significant operational constraint and reduction 
in function.   
5.3.44 
Paragraph 5.10.1 of NPS EN-1 acknowledges that an energy infrastructure 
project ‘will have direct effects on the existing use of the proposed site and 
may have indirect effects on the use, or planned use, of land in the vicinity 
for other types of development.’  Accordingly, the applicants should consult 
the local community (paragraph 5.10.6) and the ES should include an 
assessment of the impact of the proposed development on existing and 
proposed land uses near the project.  Paragraph 5.10.19 notes that there 
may be little that can be done to mitigate the direct effects of the energy 
project on the existing use of the proposed site; however, the effects may be 
minimised through the application of good design principles, including the 
layout of the project.  
5.3.45 
Paragraph 5.11.1 of NPS EN-1 states that excessive noise can have wide-
ranging impacts on the quality of human life, health, and use and enjoyment 
of areas, as well as on wildlife and biodiversity (paragraph 5.11.2).  Where 
noise impacts arise, paragraph 5.11.4 states that a noise assessment should 
be provided, to include: a description of the noise generating aspects of the 
proposal, identification of noise sensitive areas, the characteristics of the 
existing noise environment, and a prediction of how the noise environment 
will change.  Mitigation measures may include engineering, layout design, or 
administrative measures (paragraph 5.11.12).  
56 
 
5.3.46 
Paragraph 5.12.1 of NPS EN-1 states that ‘The construction, operation and 
decommissioning of energy infrastructure may have socio-economic impacts 
at local and regional levels.’  Accordingly, an assessment should be 
undertaken of all relevant socio-economic impacts, which may include: the 
creation of jobs and training opportunities, the provision of additional local 
services and improvements to local infrastructure, effects on tourism, the 
impact of a changing influx of workers during different phases of the project, 
and cumulative effects.  Mitigation measures could include improvements to 
the visual and environmental experience for visitors and the local community 
through high quality design (paragraph 5.12.9).  
5.3.47 
Paragraph 5.13.1 of NPS EN-1 notes that ‘The transport of materials, goods 
and personnel to and from a development during all project phases can have 
a variety of impacts on the surrounding transport infrastructure and potentially 
on connecting transport networks.’  The applicant should therefore undertake 
a transport assessment and consult with the Highways Agency and Highways 
Authority regarding appropriate mitigation (paragraph 5.13.3).   
5.3.48 
Paragraph 5.14.1 of NPS EN-1 outlines that government policy on hazardous 
and non-hazardous waste is intended to ‘protect human health and the 
environment by producing less waste and by using it as a resource wherever 
possible.’  Paragraph 5.14.6 states that the applicant should set out the 
arrangements proposed for managing waste and include information on the 
proposed waste recovery and disposal system.   
5.3.49 
Paragraph 5.15.1 of NPS EN-1 advises that infrastructure development can 
have 
adverse 
effects 
during 
the 
construction, 
operation 
and 
decommissioning phases on the water environment, including groundwater, 
inland surface water, transitional waters and coastal waters.  Accordingly, the 
applicant should undertake an assessment of ‘the existing status of, and 
impacts of the proposed project on, water quality, water resources and 
physical characteristics of the water environment as part of the ES’ 
(paragraph 5.15.2).  Paragraphs 5.15.9 and 5.15.10 advise that the impacts 
on the water environment and local water resources can be mitigated through 
careful design.   
National Policy Statement for Fossil Fuel Electricity Generating 
Infrastructure (EN-2) 
5.3.50 
Paragraph 1.1.1 of NPS EN-2 states “Fossil fuel generating stations play a 
vital role in providing reliable electricity supplies and a secure and diverse 
energy mix as the UK makes the transition to a low carbon economy…” 
5.3.51 
Paragraph 1.2.1 of NPS EN-2 states that, NPS EN-2, together with NPS EN-
1, provides the primary basis for decisions by the SoS on applications for 
nationally significant fossil fuel electricity generating stations. 
5.3.52 
Part 2 of NPS EN-2 provides additional guidance to Part 4 and Part 5 of EN-
1 regarding the assessment of impacts specifically associated with fossil fuel 
generating stations.   
57 
 
5.3.53 
Paragraph 2.2.1 of NPS EN-2, "it is for energy companies to decide which 
applications to bring forward and the government does not seek to direct 
applicants to particular sites for fossil fuel generating stations." 
5.3.54 
NPS EN-2 notes that “Fossil fuel generating stations have large land 
footprints and will therefore only be possible where the applicant is able to 
acquire a suitably-sized site” (NPS EN-2, paragraph 2.2.2). It also notes that 
“Applicants should locate new fossil fuel generating stations in the vicinity of 
existing transport routes wherever possible.”   
5.3.55 
Section 2.3 of NPS EN-2 states that government policy criteria for fossil fuel 
generation stations relating to – CHP, CCR, CCS, climate change adaptation, 
and ‘good design’ – must be met before consent is given. 
5.3.56 
Section 2.3.13 of NPS EN-2 sets out considerations specifically for fossil fuel 
generating stations in respect of climate change. NPS EN-2 suggests that as 
fossil fuel generating stations are likely to be proposed for coastal or 
estuarine sites, applicants should set out how the proposal would be resilient 
to: coastal changes and increased risk from storm surge; effects of higher 
temperatures, including higher temperatures of cooling water; and increased 
risk of drought leading to a lack of available cooling water.  
5.3.57 
Paragraph 2.3.16 of NPS EN-2 states that, “Applicants should demonstrate 
good design particularly in respect of landscape and visual amenity ...and in 
the design of the project to mitigate impacts such as noise and vibration, 
transport impacts and air emissions.” 
5.3.58 
Section 2.4 of NPS EN-2 contains additional policy for assessing the potential 
impacts of energy infrastructure projects for fossil fuel generating stations, 
relating to: air emissions; landscape and visual; release of dust by coal-fired 
generating stations; residue management for coal-fired generating stations; 
and water quality and resources. 
5.3.59 
Paragraph 2.5.2 of NPS EN-2 acknowledges that CO2 emissions are a 
significant adverse impact of fossil fuel generating stations.  As such, 
paragraph 2.5.5 of EN-2 states that an assessment should be carried out at 
the initial stages of developing proposals, and Paragraph 2.5.8 of EN-2 states 
that the SoS and EA should be satisfied that the potential adverse impacts of 
mitigation measures are assessed.   
5.3.60 
Paragraph 2.6.2 of NPS EN-2 advises that the main structures of a fossil fuel 
generating station – including the turbine and boiler halls, exhaust gas stack, 
storage facilities, cooling towers, and water processing plant – are large and 
likely to have an impact on the surrounding landscape and visual amenity.  A 
landscape and visual impact assessment should therefore be included as 
part of the ES, and consideration should be given to the design of the plant, 
the materials to be used, and the visual impact of the stack (paragraphs 2.6.3 
and 2.6.4).  Paragraph 2.6.5 of EN-2 states that mitigation is to minimise 
impact on visual amenity as far as reasonably practicable; however, the 
visibility of a fossil fuel generating station should be given limited weight if the 
58 
 
SoS is satisfied that the location is appropriate for the project and that it has 
been designed sensitively (paragraph 2.6.10).  
5.3.61 
Paragraph 2.7.1 of NPS EN-2 advises that the sources of noise and vibration 
from fossil fuel generating stations may include the gas and steam turbines 
and external noise sources such as externally-sited air-cooled condensers.  
Paragraph 2.7.2 of EN-2 states that the ES should include a noise 
assessment, and paragraph 2.7.5 of NPS EN-2 states that mitigation should 
be achieved through ‘good design’, including enclosure of plant and 
machinery in noise-reducing buildings where possible.  
5.3.62 
Paragraph 2.10.1 of NPS EN-2 advises that water cooling systems for fossil 
fuel generating stations may have additional impacts on water quality, 
abstraction and discharge.  Where the project is likely to have an effect on 
water quality and resources, Paragraph 2.10.2 of EN-2 states that an 
assessment should be undertaken to ‘demonstrate that appropriate 
measures will be put in place to avoid or minimise adverse impacts of 
abstraction and discharge of cooling water.’  
National Policy Statement for Gas Supply Infrastructure and Gas and 
Oil Pipelines (EN-4) 
5.3.63 
NPS EN-4, together with NPS EN-1, provides the primary basis for decisions 
by the SoS on applications for gas supply infrastructure and gas and oil 
pipelines (Paragraph 1.2.1). 
5.3.64 
Part 2 of NPS EN-4 provides additional guidance to Part 4 and Part 5 of EN-
1 regarding the assessment of impacts specific to gas supply infrastructure 
and oil and gas pipelines. 
5.3.65 
Sections 2.20 – 2.23 of NPS EN-4 set out addition policy for assessing the 
potential impacts of gas and oil pipelines, relating to: noise and vibration; 
biodiversity, landscape and visual; water quality and resources; and soil and 
geology. 
5.3.66 
Paragraph 2.20.2 of NPS EN-4 states that there are specific noise and 
vibration impacts which apply to gas pipelines, including – ‘During the pre-
construction phase there could be vibration effects from seismic surveys. 
During construction, tasks may include site clearance, soil movement, 
ground excavation, tunnelling, trenching, pipe laying and welding, and 
ground reinstatement. In addition, increased HGV traffic will be generated on 
local roads for the movement of materials.’  The ES should include an 
assessment of all of the above noise and vibration effects during the pre-
construction and construction phases (paragraph 2.20.5).  
5.3.67 
Paragraph 2.21.1 of NPS EN-4 states that the construction of a pipeline can 
impact upon ‘specific landscape elements within and adjacent to the pipeline 
route, such as grasslands, field boundaries (hedgerows, hedgebanks, 
drystone walls, fences), trees, woodlands, and watercourses.’  Accordingly, 
the ES should include an assessment of the biodiversity and landscape and 
visual effects of the proposed route and of the main alternative routes 
59 
 
considered’ (paragraph 2.21.3 of EN4).  Where it is not possible to restore 
the landscape to its original state, Paragraph 2.21.3 of EN-4 also states that 
‘the applicant should set out measures to avoid, mitigate, or employ other 
landscape measures to compensate for, any adverse effect on the 
landscape.’  
5.3.68 
Paragraph 2.22.2 of NPS EN-4 advises that ‘constructing pipelines creates 
corridors of surface clearance and excavation that can potentially affect 
watercourses, aquifers, water abstraction and discharge points, areas prone 
to flooding and ecological receptors.  As such, an assessment should be 
provided in the ES where the project is likely to have effects on water 
resources or water quality, for example through impacts on: ‘groundwater 
recharge or on existing surface water or ground abstraction points; 
associated ecological receptors’, or through: ‘siltation or spillages, 
discharges from maintenance activities or the discharge of disposals such as 
wastewater or solvents’ (paragraphs 2.22.3 and 2.22.4).  
5.3.69 
Paragraph 2.23.1 of NPS EN-4 states that ‘it will be important for applicants 
to understand the soil types and the nature of the underlying strata.’  
Accordingly, applicants should consult with the relevant statutory consultees 
at an early stage regarding the potential impact of gas pipelines on soil and 
geology (paragraph 2.23.4).  Paragraph 2.23.2 states that applicants should 
assess the stability of the ground conditions associated with the pipeline 
route, including considering the options for installing the pipeline.  
National Policy Statement for Electricity Networks Infrastructure (EN-5) 
5.3.70 
NPS EN-5, together with NPS EN-1, provides the primary basis for decisions 
by the SoS on applications for electricity networks infrastructure NSIPs 
(Paragraph 1.2.1) such as overhead lines, and associated development of 
electrical networks infrastructure (such as substations) for other NSIPs. The 
Project considered an overhead line as an alternative for the Electrical 
Connection and includes a substation. Accordingly, the Project has had 
regard to the provisions of NPS EN-5 as they relate to substations and the 
consideration of alternative Electrical Connections, as set out below. 
5.3.71 
Part 2 of NPS EN-5 provides additional guidance to Part 4 and Part 5 of EN-
1 regarding the assessment of impacts specific to electricity networks 
infrastructure. 
5.3.72 
In respect of climate change adaptation, paragraph 2.4.1 of NPS EN-5 states 
that applicants should set out the extent to which the proposed development 
would be vulnerable and how it would be resilient to: flooding; the effects of 
wind and storms; higher average temperatures; and earth movement or 
subsidence. The Project is considered further in this respect at section 6.9 of 
this Planning Statement. 
5.3.73 
Paragraph 2.5.2 of NPS EN-5 states that, ‘proposals for electricity networks 
infrastructure should demonstrate good design in their approach to mitigating 
the potential adverse impacts which can be associated with overhead lines’, 
60 
 
particularly in respect of: biodiversity and geological conservation; landscape 
and visual; noise and vibration; and EMFs.  
5.3.74 
Paragraph 2.7.1 of NPS EN-5 advises that there is the potential for large birds 
to collide with overhead power lines, particularly in poor visibility.  
Accordingly, the EIA should consider whether the proposed line will cause 
problems at any point along its length, in particular regarding feeding and 
hunting grounds, migration corridors and breeding grounds (paragraph 
2.7.2).  Suitable mitigation measures may include: careful siting of the line; 
making lines more visible; or reducing electrocution risks through the design 
of crossarms and insulators (paragraphs 2.7.4 – 2.7.6).  
5.3.75 
Paragraphs 2.8.4 – 2.8.6 of NPS EN-5 state that applicants should follow 
guidance set out in the Holford Rules when considering the approach to the 
routeing of new overhead lines.  Paragraph 2.8.4 also states that applicants 
should offer ‘constructive proposals for additional mitigation of the proposed 
overhead lines’, and consider the ‘potential costs and benefits of other 
feasible means of connection or reinforcement’ where the proposed 
overhead line is likely to have a significant visual impact.  
5.3.76 
Paragraph 2.8.8 of NPS EN-5 acknowledges that, whilst the development of 
overhead lines will often be appropriate for meeting the need for new 
electricity lines of 132kV and above, there are cases where overhead lines 
are not appropriate.  This paragraph adds, “Where there are serious 
concerns about the potential adverse landscape and visual effects of a 
proposed overhead line, the IPC will have to balance these against other 
relevant factors, including the need for the proposed infrastructure, the 
availability and cost of alternative sites and routes and methods of installation 
(including undergrounding).”  
5.3.77 
Paragraph 2.8.9 of NPS EN-5 notes, “The impacts and costs of both 
overhead and underground options vary considerably between individual 
projects (both in absolute and relative terms). Therefore, each project should 
be assessed individually on the basis of its specific circumstances and taking 
account of the fact that Government has not laid down any general rule about 
when an overhead line should be considered unacceptable.” 
5.3.78 
Paragraph 2.10.1 of NPS EN-5 advises that ‘power frequency Electric and 
Magnetic Fields (EMFs) arise from generation, transmission, distribution and 
use of electricity and will occur around power lines and electric cables.  
Paragraph 2.10.15 of EN-5 states that in order to mitigate for EMFs, the 
applicant should consider: height, position, insulation and protection 
measures; optimal phasing of high voltage overhead power lines where 
possible and practicable; and any new Government advice. 
 
 
61 
 
5.5 
Other National Planning Policy 
5.5.1 
Section 104(2)(d) of the PA 2008 states that in determining Applications, the 
SoS should have regard to any other matters which are considered to be 
‘both important and relevant to the [SoS’s] decision.’ 
5.5.2 
Other national planning policy (in addition to the various high level energy 
policy documents referred to above) which is considered to be important and 
relevant to the DCO Application is contained within the National Planning 
Policy Framework (NPPF) (adopted in 2012) and National Planning Practice 
Guidance (NPPG) are summarised below. 
National Planning Policy Framework (NPPF) 
5.5.3 
The NPPF was adopted in March 2012 to replace previous planning policy 
statements and guidance, with one consolidated national planning statement. 
It sets out the Government’s planning policies for England and how these are 
expected to be applied. 
5.5.4 
The NPPF does not contain specific policies for NSIPs.  Instead, Paragraph 
3 of the NPPF states that NSIPs “are determined in accordance with the 
decision-making framework set out in the Planning Act 2008 and relevant 
national policy statements for major infrastructure, as well as any other 
matters that are considered both important and relevant (which may include 
the National Planning Policy Framework).”  
5.5.5 
The DCO Application is therefore to be determined primarily in accordance 
with NPS EN-1, NPS EN-2, NPS EN-4 and NPS EN-5.  However, the NPPF 
does contain some general planning guidance which may be considered to 
be ‘both important and relevant’ to the determination of the DCO Application. 
5.5.6 
Paragraph 14 of the NPPF sets out a ‘presumption in favour of sustainable 
development’, such that development that is sustainable is approved without 
delay.  Sustainable development incorporates: an economic role, which 
includes identifying and coordinating the provision of infrastructure; a social 
role, which includes meeting the community’s needs; and an environmental 
role, which includes protecting and enhancing the environment and adapting 
to a low carbon economy (paragraph 7).  Further, Paragraph 56 of the NPPF 
states that ‘good design is a key aspect of sustainable development’ and is 
‘indivisible from good planning.’   
 
 
62 
 
5.5.8 
Paragraph 17 of the NPPF sets out 12 core planning principles, which 
include: 
 Proactively driving and supporting economic development to deliver 
amongst other things the infrastructure that the country needs; 
 Always seeking to secure high quality design; 
 Taking account of the different roles and character of different areas; 
 Supporting the transition to a low carbon future; 
 Contributing to conserving and enhancing the natural environment; 
and 
 Encouraging the effective use of land by reusing land that has been 
previously developed. 
5.5.9 
Paragraph 18 of the NPPF explains that the Government is committed to 
securing economic growth and to meeting the challenge of a low carbon 
future. 
5.5.10 
Paragraph 66 of the NPPF states that proposals in which an applicant has 
worked closely with those directly affected by their views should be 
considered favourably. 
5.5.11 
Paragraph 93 of the NPPF acknowledges that planning plays a key role in 
supporting the delivery of low carbon energy and therefore achieving the 
economic, social and environmental dimensions of sustainable development.  
Paragraph 97 of the NPPF advises that, in order to increase the use and 
supply of low carbon energy, there should be a positive strategy to promoting 
energy from renewable and low carbon sources, whilst ensuring that adverse 
impacts are addressed satisfactorily. 
5.5.12 
Paragraph 109 of the NPPF states that ‘the planning system should 
contribute to and enhance the natural and local environment’ by: 
 protecting 
and 
enhancing 
valued 
landscapes, 
geological 
conservation interests and soils; 
 recognising the wider benefits of ecosystem services; 
 minimising impacts on biodiversity and providing net gains in 
biodiversity where possible; 
 preventing new development from contributing to or being put at 
unacceptable risk from, or being adversely affected by unacceptable 
levels of soil, air, water or noise pollution or land instability; and 
 remediating 
and 
mitigating 
despoiled, 
degraded, 
derelict, 
contaminated and unstable land, where appropriate. 
63 
 
5.5.13 
Paragraph 121 of the NPPF advises that a site should be suitable, taking into 
account ground conditions and land instability, pollution and proposed 
mitigation.   
5.5.14 
Paragraph 123 of the NPPF advises that planning decisions should seek to 
avoid noise from giving rise to significant adverse impacts on health and 
quality of life, and to mitigate any adverse impacts where necessary. 
National Planning Practice Guidance (NPPG) 
5.5.15 
On 6th March 2014, the Government published new online planning practice 
guidance to replace previous guidance documents and support the 
application of the NPPF. Sections of the NPPG are updated on a rolling basis.  
The NPPG resource provides planning guidance in respect of a number of 
topics, including: air quality, design, flood risk and coastal change, natural 
environment, noise, renewable and low carbon energy, and water supply, 
wastewater and water quality.  Relevant NPPG guidance, correct as at the 
end of September 2017, is set out below. 
5.5.16 
Paragraph 001 of guidance relating to air quality advises that air quality, 
odour and dust can be a planning concern because of the effect on 
biodiversity and local amenity.  Accordingly, assessments could include a 
description of baseline conditions, the assessment methods to be adopted 
and acceptable mitigation measures (paragraph 007).  The impacts of air 
quality could be mitigated through the design and layout of development, the 
use of green infrastructure, and controlling dust and emissions from 
construction, operation and demolition (paragraph 008). 
5.5.17 
Paragraph 001 of guidance relating to design highlights that good quality 
design is an integral part of sustainable development – “Good design 
responds in a practical and creative way to both the function and identity of 
a place. It puts land, water, drainage, energy, community, economic, 
infrastructure and other such resources to the best possible use – over the 
long as well as the short term.” 
5.5.18 
Paragraph 029 of guidance relating to flood risk and coastal change advises 
developers and applicants to consider flood risk to and from the development 
site as early as possible, and to follow the broad approach of assessing, 
avoiding, managing and mitigating flood risk.  Paragraph 030 states that a 
site-specific FRA should be carried out to demonstrate “how flood risk will be 
managed now and over the development’s lifetime, taking climate change 
into account, and with regard to the vulnerability of its users.” 
5.5.19 
Paragraph 016 of guidance relating to the natural environment states that the 
potential impacts on biodiversity should inform all stages of development.  
Biodiversity enhancement should seek to include habitat restoration, re-
creation and expansion (paragraph 017). 
5.5.20 
Paragraph 001 of guidance relating to noise states that “noise needs to be 
considered when new developments may create additional noise and when 
new developments would be sensitive to the prevailing acoustic 
64 
 
environment.”  Paragraph 008 advises that there are four broad types of 
mitigation: engineering, layout, using planning conditions/obligations and 
mitigating. 
5.5.21 
Paragraph 001 of guidance relating to renewable and low carbon energy 
acknowledges that increasing the amount of energy from low carbon 
technologies will help to make sure the UK has a secure energy supply, 
reduce greenhouse gas emissions to slow down climate change and 
stimulate investment in new jobs and businesses. 
5.5.22 
Paragraph 016 of guidance relating to water supply, wastewater and water 
quality states that a detailed assessment will be required where it is likely that 
a proposal will have a significant adverse impact on water quality.  The 
assessment should form part of an Environmental Statement. 
5.6 
Local Planning Policy 
5.6.1 
Prior to April 2009, the Project Site fell within Mid-Bedfordshire District 
Council, South Bedfordshire District Council and Bedford Borough Council. 
However, as part of the structural changes to local government in England, 
effected on 1 April 2009, new unitary authorities were created on existing 
borough boundaries, and in parts of the country which previously operated a 
‘two-tier’ system of counties and districts.  
5.6.2 
As a result of these changes, Mid Bedfordshire District Council and South 
Bedfordshire Council were combined to form Central Bedfordshire (a unitary 
authority). Bedford Borough Council also became a unitary authority on its 
existing boundaries.  
5.6.3 
Thus, the Project Site now falls within the jurisdiction of the unitary authorities 
of Central Bedfordshire Council and Bedford Borough Council. However, 
several of the planning documents from the previous districts were saved and 
therefore remain relevant to the Project Site and proposals. As such, adopted 
local planning policy is contained within the following documents: 
The Development Plan  
Central Bedfordshire Council 
 Central Bedfordshire Core Strategy and Development Management 
Policies (adopted 2009); and 
 Central Bedfordshire Site Allocations DPD (adopted 2011);

2014); 
Other Material Considerations  
5.6.4 
Central Bedfordshire Council and Bedford Borough Council are in the 
process of preparing new development plan documents for their respective 
local authorities. The draft versions of the development plans are material 
considerations to the determination of the proposed development.  
5.6.5 
Further, a number of Supplementary Planning Documents (SPDs) and 
guidance notes have been adopted in order to supplement and add further 
details to support the implementation of adopted planning policies. Additional 
planning guidance of potential relevance to the Project is contained within the 
following documents.  
5.6.6 
The material considerations to each respective local authority are listed 
below.

Proposals Maps (2011) 
5.6.8 
The adopted Proposals Maps form part of the Local Development Framework 
(LDF) for Central Bedfordshire (North), which also comprises Central 
Bedfordshire Core Strategy and Development Management Policies (2009) 
and Central Bedfordshire Site Allocations DPD (2011). 
5.6.9 
The Project Site is included on ‘Side A’ and in part on ‘Inset 39: Millbrook 
Proving Ground’ of the adopted Proposal Maps, as shown in Figures 5.2 and

5.6.10 
As illustrated on the adopted Proposals Maps, the Project Site is subject to 
the following designations and planning policy considerations: 
 Forest of Marston Vale – Policies CS16 and DM14 of Central 
Bedfordshire Core Strategy and Development Management Policies; 
 CWS – Policy CS18 of Central Bedfordshire Core Strategy and 
Development Management Policies; 
68 
 
 Floodplain – Policy CS13. 
5.6.11 
Reference to relevant planning policy considerations, relating to the 
designations of the Project Site on the Proposals Maps, is contained below. 
Central Bedfordshire Core Strategy and Development Management 
Policies (2009) 
5.6.12 
The Central Bedfordshire Core Strategy and Development Management 
Policies document was adopted in November 2009 as part of the LDF for 
Central Bedfordshire (North). This document is the key Development Plan 
Document (DPD) for the northern part of the district and provides the long-
term vision and direction for future development in this area over the period 
2001-2026.  
5.6.13 
The Project Site is located on the edge of the Northern Marston Vale 
Strategic Area, as identified on the Core Strategy Key Diagram.  The Spatial 
Vision for the Core Strategy states that the Northern Marston Vale will 
‘continue to be a growth location where development will help to bring about 
environmental regeneration, support the urban renaissance of Bedford and 
make the Vale a more attractive place to live, do business and enjoy leisure 
time’ (page 16).   
5.6.14 
Further, Policy CS1 states that sites within Northern Marston Vale will be 
identified and developed for new homes, jobs and key infrastructure, with a 
particular focus on delivery at Wixams (north-east of the Project Site) and 
Marston Moretaine (west of the Project Site). Wixams and Marston Moretaine 
are identified for housing provision of c.1000 dwellings and c.0-100 dwellings 
respectively in Policy CS5. 
5.6.15 
Policy CS9 states that the Council will plan for a minimum target of 17,000 
net additional jobs in the district over the period 2001-2026.  This target will 
be supported through the provision of 10-20ha of new employment land 
within Northern Marston Vale, in accordance with Policy CS10.  
5.6.16 
The Project Site is located within the floodplain as illustrated on the Central 
Bedfordshire LDF (North) Proposals Map, where Core Strategy Policy CS13 
applies.  Policy CS13 states that the Council will seek to minimise the risk of 
flooding and manage residual risks, as well as securing new development 
which incorporates measures to take account of climate change.  Policy 
CS13 also states that energy generating proposals with low carbon impact 
will be considered positively. 
5.6.17 
Policy CS14 states that the Council will require development to be of the 
highest quality by, inter alia, respecting local context and the varied character 
and local distinctiveness of Mid Bedfordshire. 
5.6.18 
The Project Site is located within the Forest of Marston Vale as illustrated on 
the LDF North Proposals Map, where Core Strategy Policy CS16 applies.  
Policy CS16 states that the Council will: 
69 
 
 Conserve and enhance the varied countryside character and local 
distinctiveness; 
 Resist development where it will have an adverse effect on important 
landscape features or highly sensitive landscapes; 
 Require development to enhance landscapes of lesser quality; 
 Continue to support the creation of the Forest of Marston Vale; 
 Conserve woodlands including ancient and semi natural woodland, 
hedgerows and veteran trees; and 
 Promote an increase in tree cover outside of the Forest of Marston 
Vale, where it would not threaten other valuable habitats. 
5.6.19 
Policy CS17 states that the Council will: 
 Seek a net gain in green infrastructure through the protection and 
enhancement of assets and the provision of new green spaces; 
 Take forward priority areas for the provision of new green 
infrastructure in the Forest of Marston Vale; and 
 Require new development to contribute towards the delivery of new 
green infrastructure and the management of a linked network of new 
and enhanced open spaces and corridors. 
5.6.20 
The Project Site is part-located within a County Wildlife Site (CWS) as 
illustrated on the Central Bedfordshire LDF (North) Proposals Map, where 
Core Strategy Policy CS18 applies.  Policy CS18 states that the Council will 
support the designation, management and protection of biodiversity and 
geology, including locally important CWS’s. Development that would 
fragment or prejudice the biodiversity network will not be permitted.  
5.6.21 
Policy DM3 requires that all proposals for new development will, inter alia: 
 Be appropriate in scale and design to their setting; 
 Respect local distinctiveness through design and use of materials; 
 Use energy efficiently; 
 Comply with the current guidance on noise, waste management, 
vibration, odour, water, light and airborne pollution; and 
 Incorporate appropriate access and linkages. 
5.6.22 
The Project Site is located within the Forest of Marston Vale as illustrated on 
the LDF North Proposals Map, where Core Strategy Policy DM14 applies.  
Policy DM14 states that the Council will ensure that the impact of proposed 
development on the landscape will be assessed.  Proposals for development 
70 
 
within the Northern Marston Vale and the Forest of Marston Vale will be 
required to provide landscape enhancement on or adjacent to the 
development site or contribute towards landscape enhancement in these 
areas.  Trees, woodland and hedgerows in the district will be protected by 
requiring developers to retain and protect such features in close proximity to 
building works.  Further, tree planting or contributions towards planting for 
the purposes of enhancing the landscape will be sought from new 
developments.  
5.6.23 
Policy DM15 states that the Council will ensure that advice is sought from 
relevant national and local organisations where proposed development is 
considered to have an impact on wildlife.  For developments where there is 
a need to protect or enhance biodiversity, developers will be required to carry 
out such work and/or make contributions to secure longer term benefits for 
wildlife. 
Central Bedfordshire Site Allocations DPD (2011) 
5.6.24 
The Central Bedfordshire Site Allocations DPD was adopted in April 2011.  
The document identifies sites and policies to help deliver the spatial vision, 
objectives and policies of the Core Strategy and Development Management 
Policies DPD. 
5.6.25 
Policy E1 states that the Council will safeguard a number of Key Employment 
Sites within the district, including Millbrook Proving Ground (approximately 
400m to the south of the Project Site). 
5.6.26 
Policy MA4 allocates land at Moreteyne Farm in Marston Moretaine 
(approximately 1.5km to the west of the Project Site) for a mixed-use phased 
development, comprising residential development of 125 dwellings, 7ha of 
employment land for B1, B2 and B8 uses, and land reserved for contingency 
housing provision of 320 dwellings. 
5.6.27 
Policy HA5 allocates land north of Church Street, Ampthill (approximately 
2km to the south-east of the Project Site) for residential development of 38 
dwellings and a public car park. 
5.6.28 
Policy HA4 allocates land west of Abbey Lane, Ampthill (approximately 2.5km 
to the south-east of the Project Site) for residential development of a 
minimum of 410 dwellings. 
Bedford Borough Council 
Bedford Borough Local Plan (2002) (Saved Policies) 
5.6.29 
The Bedford Borough Local Plan was adopted in October 2002.  The Local 
Plan set out a wide range of policies and proposals to guide development in 
the Borough in the period up to 2006.   
5.6.30 
Following its expiry, a number of Local Plan policies were ‘saved’ for 
continued use in development control.  Some ‘saved’ Local Plan policies 
have subsequently been deleted following the adoption of the Core Strategy 
71 
 
and Rural Issues Plan in 2008, the Town Centre Area Action Plan in 2008 
and the Allocations and Designations Local Plan in 2013; however, a number 
of ‘saved’ Local Plan policies remain in force and are applicable to the DCO 
Application. 
5.6.31 
As illustrated on the adopted Policies Map, the site is part-located within a 
designated County Wildlife Site and to the south-east of a designated Local 
Geological Site.  Saved Local Plan Policy NE3 states that development will 
not be permitted that may directly or indirectly destroy or adversely affect a 
County Wildlife Site or Regionally Important Geological Site.  
5.6.32 
Saved Policy NE4 states that the Borough Council will seek to protect and 
retain trees and hedges which are considered to be of amenity, landscape or 
wildlife significance. 
5.6.33 
Saved Policy NE8 states that where development would result in the loss of 
habitats or features, a replacement asset of a comparable or enhanced 
nature conservation value will be required.  Similarly, saved Policy NE9 seeks 
to control development which may have an impact on the nature conservation 
of a site, and saved Policy NE10 states that development will be expected to 
contribute to nature conservation. 
5.6.34 
Saved Policy NE12 seeks to ensure that development proposals make early 
provision for adequate and appropriate landscaping.  In addition, saved 
Policy NE13 advises that adequate provision should be made for the 
retention, protection, management and maintenance of landscape features.  
5.6.35 
Saved Policy NE24 seeks to ensure that development proposals do not 
adversely affect the quality or quantity of water resources or their amenity or 
nature conservation value. 
5.6.36 
Saved Policy H11 allocates land north of Fields Road, Wootton 
(approximately 4km to the north of the Site) for mixed development including 
approximately 450 dwellings. 
5.6.37 
Saved Policy H12 allocates land south of Fields Road, Wootton 
(approximately 3.5km to the north of the Site) for approximately 340 
dwellings. 
5.6.38 
Saved Policy H13 allocates land at Rousbury Road, Stewartby 
(approximately 1.5km to the north of the Site) for residential development of 
approximately 330 dwellings. 
5.6.39 
Saved Policy H14 allocates the Elstow Storage Depot (approximately 4km to 
the north-east of the Site) for mixed-use development, including 
approximately 375 dwellings. 
5.6.40 
Saved Policy T4 seeks to ensure the provision of landscape screening 
appropriate to the scale of proposed roads and the preservation of existing 
trees. 
72 
 
5.6.41 
Saved Policy LR10 states that the Borough Council will, inter alia: safeguard 
existing footpath/bridleway links; and seek opportunities to enhance existing 
footpath, bridleway and cycle networks in conjunction with new development 
from the urban area into the countryside and the Forest of Marston Vale.  
5.6.42 
Saved Policy BE9 states that the Borough Council will seek to protect the 
character and appearance of designed conservation areas through the 
careful control of development. The policy states that proposals which fail to 
preserve or enhance their character will not be permitted.  
5.6.43 
Saved Policy BE11 states that the Borough Council will ensure that all new 
development likely to affect the setting of conservation areas, preserves or 
enhances its character or appearance. Applications will be assessed 
according to the following criteria: design (scale, form, density & materials), 
traffic generation, visual impact (streetscape, roofscape, skyline & open 
space) and potential economic regeneration benefits.  
5.6.44 
The ES (Chapter 6.1) identifies there are no designated heritage assets 
located within the Power Generation Plant Site however there are two Grade 
I and four Grade II* listed buildings within the wider study area. Saved Policy 
BE21 states that the Borough Council will seek to preserve and enhance the 
setting of listed buildings through controlling the design of new development, 
use of adjacent land and preservation of trees and landscape features in the 
vicinity of listed buildings.  
5.6.45 
The ES (Chapter 6.1) identifies there are no scheduled monuments located 
within the Power Generation Plant Site however there is one scheduled 
monument (Ampthill Castle) located in the vicinity of the site. Saved Policy 
BE23 states that proposals which would have an adverse effect on scheduled 
ancient monuments and other important archaeological assets and their 
settings will not be permitted except where adverse impacts can be mitigated 
while keeping the asset physically preserved in situ.  
5.6.46 
Saved Policy BE24 states that the Borough Council will have regard to the 
need to protect, enhance and preserve sites of archaeological interest and 
their settings when considering planning applications. The policy goes on to 
state that planning permission will be refused where an adequate 
assessment has not been undertaken to evaluate the archaeological aspects 
of proposals.  
5.6.47 
Saved Policy BE29 Design states that the Borough Council expects all new 
development to be designed to the highest standards and the Council will 
promote good design by means of design guides, good design principles and 
other appropriate measures that it will publicise. 
5.6.48 
Saved Policy BE30 states that the Borough Council will have full regard to all 
material considerations when determining applications for new development 
and particular; visual impact; design quality of building and public spaces; 
traffic generation and potential for sustainable non-car modes; health and 
safety issues; generation of waste; adequacy of existing infrastructure; and 
73 
 
any adverse impacts on neighbours, the surrounding community, the natural 
environment and built heritage.  
5.6.49 
Saved Policy BE38 states that the Borough Council will not grant planning 
permission unless sufficient provision has been made for landscaping (on-
site or off-site) which results in an environmental / landscape benefit. The 
Borough Council may also negotiate commuted sums to secure the 
management and maintenance of landscaped areas where appropriate.  
Bedford Core Strategy and Rural Issues Plan (2008) 
5.6.50 
The Bedford Borough Core Strategy and Rural Issues Plan was adopted in 
2008.  The Plan sets out the long term vision and spatial strategy for Bedford 
Borough to 2021. The following key policies are relevant to the Project. 
5.6.51 
Policy CP2 sets out a number of sustainable development principles which 
seek to ensure that, inter alia: resources and infrastructure are used 
efficiently; biodiversity is protected and resources are conserved; and climate 
change is properly addressed. 
5.6.52 
Policy CP10 states that ‘a minimum of 16,000 net additional jobs will be 
provided in the borough by 2021’, and Policy CP11 states that up to 75ha of 
additional employment land will be provided in the period 2001-2021. 
5.6.53 
Policy CP21 advises that all new development should, inter alia, be of the 
highest design quality, fully consider the wider context and address 
sustainable design principles. 
5.6.54 
Policy CP24 states that ‘The Marston Vale will be the focus for landscape 
enhancement and restoration and the council will continue to support the 
Forest of Marston Vale.’  New development should protect and where 
appropriate enhance the quality and character of the landscape. 
5.6.55 
Policy CP25 states that the biodiversity and geodiversity of the borough will 
be protected and where appropriate enhanced.  Appropriate mitigation and/or 
compensation will be required where harm to biodiversity and/or geodiversity 
is likely to be a result of development. 
5.6.56 
In regards to climate change and pollution, Policy CP26 advises that the 
Council will require development to, inter alia: 
 Minimise the emission of pollutants into the wider environment; 
 Have regard to the cumulative impacts of development proposals on 
air quality; 
 Minimise the consumption and use of energy; 
 Utilise sustainable construction techniques; 
 Incorporate facilities to minimise the use of water and waste; and 
74 
 
 Limit any adverse effects on water quality, reduce water consumption 
and minimise the risk of flooding. 
Bedford Allocations and Designations Local Plan (2013) 
5.6.57 
The Bedford Borough Allocations and Designations Local Plan was adopted 
in 2013.  The Plan allocates sites to meet the Borough's future development 
needs and designates areas of land where specific policies will apply. 
5.6.58 
The Local Plan does not allocate any land within close proximity of the Site 
for new development; however Policy AD13 allocates the Marston Vale 
Innovation Park Phase 2 at Wootton (approximately 3km to the north of the 
Site) for a mix of classes B1(a)(b)(c) and B2 uses. 
Draft Bedford Borough Local Plan 2035 
5.6.59 
Bedford Borough Council is currently preparing a new Local Plan that will 
guide new development within the Borough up to 2035. The new Local Plan 
will allocate the amount and location of new development across the Borough 
and contain planning policies to manage the delivery of new development.   
5.6.60 
An initial ‘Call for Sites’ and Issues and Options consultation was undertaken 
in early 2014, and a further ‘Call for Sites’ was undertaken in late 2015.  A 
Consultation Paper was published in April 2017 and consultation ran from 
24th April to 9th June 2017. Further consultation is anticipated in early 2018, 
followed by submission of the Draft Local Plan in late 2018 and adoption in 
2019.  Upon adoption, the Local Plan 2035 will replace the adopted Core 
Strategy and Rural Issues Plan as the key DPD for the Borough.   
Mid-Bedfordshire Council 
Mid-Bedfordshire Local Plan (2005) (Saved Policies)  
5.6.61 
The Mid-Bedfordshire Local Plan: First Review was adopted in December 
2005.  The Local Plan set out a wide range of policies and proposals to guide 
development within the former Mid-Bedfordshire district.  The majority of the 
Local Plan policies have now been superseded by the Central Bedfordshire 
Core Strategy and Development Management Policies document (adopted 
in 2009), however some policies have not been superseded and continue to 
be part of the development plan. 
5.6.62 
Saved Local Plan Policy HO8 (1) allocates land east of Lidlington 
(approximately 2km to the west of the Project Site) for residential 
development of approximately 60 dwellings. 
5.6.63 
Saved Local Plan Policy HO8 (2) allocates land at Stewartby (to the north of 
the Project Site) for residential development of approximately 50 dwellings. 
5.6.64 
Saved Local Plan Policy HO8 (2A) allocates land at High Street, Houghton 
Conquest (approximately 2.5km to the east of the Project Site) for residential 
development of approximately 24 dwellings. 
75 
 
5.6.65 
Saved Local Plan Policy HO8 (3A) allocated land at Woburn Road, Marston 
Moretaine (approximately 1.5km to the east of the Project Site) for residential 
development of approximately 100 dwellings. 
5.6.66 
Saved Local Plan Policy HO8 (5) allocates land adjacent to Swaffield Close, 
Ampthill (approximately 3km to the south-east of the Project Site) for 
residential development of approximately 50 dwellings.   
Joint Waste Authority (Bedford Borough Council, Central Bedfordshire 
and Luton Borough Councils)  
Bedfordshire and Luton Minerals and Waste Local Plan (2005) 
5.6.67 
The Bedfordshire and Luton Minerals and Waste Local Plan was adopted in 
2005 and covers Bedford Borough, Central Bedfordshire and Luton Borough 
Councils.  The majority of the minerals and waste policies contained in the 
Local Plan have now been superseded by the Bedford Borough, Central 
Bedfordshire and Luton Borough Council Minerals and Waste Local Plan: 
Strategic Sites and Policies (2014).  However, some policies have not been 
superseded and continue to be part of the development plan. 
5.6.68 
Policy W4 states that an overall reduction in the amount of waste generation 
in the region will be actively encouraged. 
5.6.69 
Policy W5 requires that, where developments are likely to generate 
significant volumes of waste, a waste audit is undertaken which 
demonstrates that waste is minimised as far as possible and managed 
appropriately. 
5.6.70 
Policy W22 states that proposed waste management sites will be protected 
as far as practicable from development that may conflict or prejudice their 
waste management use.  
Bedford Borough, Central Bedfordshire and Luton Borough Council – 
Minerals and Waste Local Plan: Strategic Sites and Policies (2014) 
5.6.71 
The Minerals and Waste Local Plan: Strategic Sites and Policies 
(MWLP:SSP) was adopted by Bedford Borough, Central Bedfordshire and 
Luton Borough Councils on 30th January 2014.  The MWLP:SSP forms part 
of the Minerals and Waste Local Development Framework for the three 
Councils which also includes the Managing Waste in New Developments 
SPD (adopted in 2006), Minerals and Waste Development Scheme, 
Monitoring Report, Statement of Community Involvement (adopted in 2006) 
and Policies Map.  
5.6.72 
The General and Environmental Policies Local Development Document 
(LDD), which was anticipated for adoption in 2015/16, was also expected to 
form part of the MWLP:SSP. However instead of adopting this document, the 
saved minerals and waste policies will be replaced by new policy in the main 
Development Plan Documents being produced by the three authorities.   
76 
 
5.6.73 
The MWLP:SSP sets out a series of strategic objectives for waste and 
minerals over the period 2013-2028, together with strategic allocations for 
mineral extraction and waste management development and strategic 
policies to guide the ongoing supply of minerals and development of waste 
management facilities.   
5.6.74 
The MWLP:SSP sets out a presumption in favour of sustainable development 
when considering development proposals, at Policy MWSP1, reflective of 
that contained in the NPPF.  Accordingly, Bedford Borough, Central 
Bedfordshire and Luton Borough Council will work proactively to find 
solutions which mean that proposals can be approved wherever possible, to 
secure development that improves the economic, social and environmental 
conditions in the Plan area.  Policy MWSP1 further states that planning 
applications that accord with the MWLP:SSP and subsequent Local 
Development Documents will be approved without delay. 
5.6.75 
The MWLP:SSP addresses the provision of additional waste management 
capacity in a number of ways, including through various forms of recovery 
operations, in order to support the move towards a materials reusing 
economy.  As part of the Spatial Strategy for Waste, Policy WSP2 allocates 
four sites for waste recovery uses, at Elstow North, Land at Former 
Brogborough landfill, Rookery South Pit, and Land at Thorn Turn.  The site 
at Rookery South Pit (107ha), located predominantly within Central 
Bedfordshire Council and partly within Bedford Borough Council, is allocated 
for non-landfill waste management recovery operations and non-hazardous 
landfill, with opportunities for pre-treatment recovery operations prior to 
landfill. 
5.6.76 
Figure 5.1 shows an extract of the MWLP:SSP Policies Map, Inset 2, 
illustrating the extent of Rookery South Pit (shaded in yellow) allocated by 
Policy WSP2 for waste recovery uses. 
Figure 5-4: Extract of MWLP:SSP Policies Map Inset 2 
 
77 
 
5.6.77 
Policy MWSP2 requires that waste management and restoration proposals 
take account of climate change through measures to reduce greenhouse gas 
emissions and to adapt to future climate changes.  The supporting text to 
Policy MWSP2 acknowledges that all waste management developments 
have the scope to contribute to mitigating climate change (paragraph 4.15).  
Paragraph 4.16 of the MWLP:SSP states that applications should set out how 
waste 
management 
developments 
will 
make 
use 
of 
renewable, 
decentralised, and low carbon energy. 
5.6.78 
Paragraph 5.16 of the MWLP:SSP notes that a DCO was issued in March 
2013 for “the development [by Covanta Energy Ltd] of a Resource Recovery 
Facility on land at Rookery South Pit.”

78 
 
 Policy CC6: Water Quality  
 Policy CC7: Pollution 
 Policy HQ6: High Quality Development 
 Policy DC1: Development in the Countryside 
5.7.3 
The Central Bedfordshire Local Plan will be the key strategic planning 
document for Central Bedfordshire and will guide the delivery of new 
infrastructure. Once adopted the plan will replace the North Core Strategy 
and Development Management Policies Document (2009) and the majority 
of the remaining policies within the South Bedfordshire Local Plan (2004), the 
Mid Bedfordshire Local Plan (2005) and the remaining saved policies of the 
Bedfordshire and Luton Minerals and Waste Local Plan (2005) so far as they 
affect Central Bedfordshire. 
5.7.4 
The Draft Local Plan (July 2017) includes broad policies for steering and 
shaping development, and other more detailed policies for determining 
planning applications, it does not at this stage include allocation policies for 
specific sites. These will feature in the next draft of the plan in spring 2018 
known as the pre-submission plan.  
5.7.5 
Once adopted, the Local Plan will be accompanied by the Policies Maps 
which provide a spatial representation of the Local Plan policies. The Policies 
Map has not yet been published with the Draft Local Plan.  
5.7.6 
The Draft Policies relevant to the Project are detailed below:  
5.7.1 
Draft Policy SP1 sets out the Growth Strategy for Central Bedfordshire in the 
period 2011-2031, which includes the delivery of 31,000 new homes and 
27,000 new jobs.   
5.7.2 
Draft Policy SP2 states that development proposals will be considered in 
accordance with the presumption in favour of sustainable development set 
out within the NPPF. 
5.7.3 
Draft Policy T1 states that development will be required to evidence that there 
is sufficient capacity in the transport network to accommodate the increase 
in demand to travel as a result of the development. 
5.7.4 
Draft Policy T2 states that development will be required to evidence that 
sufficient mitigation measures are in place to alleviate any pressures that are 
demonstrated to occur. 
5.7.5 
Draft Policy T3 states that proposals for new development must not have a 
detrimental effect on highway safety, patterns of movement and the access 
needs of all people. It states that development will be permitted where, inter 
alia, the proposal does not impede the free flow of traffic on the existing 
network or create hazards to that traffic and other road users.  
79 
 
5.7.6 
Draft Policy EE4 seeks to protect existing trees, woodland and hedgerows. It 
states that existing hedgerows and trees should be integrated within 
developments, unless demonstrably inappropriate. Further, it states that any 
removal of trees or hedgerows to accommodate development must be 
justified, and should be replaced within the development site.  
5.7.7 
Draft Policy EE9 states that the Council will continue to support the creation 
of the Forest of Marston Vale. It required developments for new buildings 
within the Forest of Marston Vale to demonstrate how they will deliver 30% 
tree cover across their development site, through a combination of retaining 
and protecting existing trees and planting of new trees.  
5.7.8 
Draft Policy CC1 states that the Council will require that any new 
development minimises the vulnerability of the development and its 
surroundings to climate change. It lists the means through which new 
development will be required to incorporate measures that minimise and 
mitigate their impact on the environment.  
5.7.9 
Draft Policy CC3 states that development will be supported where inter alia, 
it located is in areas at lowest risk of flooding,  A sequential approach to site 
layout is applied; a site-specific FRA has been undertaken following the 
criteria within this policy and the NPPF and mitigation measures maximise 
water efficiency and contribute to a net gain in water quality, biodiversity, 
landscape character and green infrastructure. 
5.7.10 
Draft Policy CC5 states that all new development must, inter alia, 
demonstrate that the discharge of surface water obeys the priority order, 
demonstrate that surface water runoff is managed as close to its source as 
possible, and demonstrate that demonstrate that the run-off from all hard 
surfaces shall receive an appropriate level of treatment to minimise the risk 
of pollution. 
5.7.11 
Draft Policy CC6 requires all new developments to demonstrate that, inter 
alia, it has no adverse impact on the quality of waterbodies and groundwater, 
or will prevent future attainment of good status, and that development 
contributes positively to the water environment and its ecology and does not 
adversely affect surface and ground water quality.  
5.7.12 
Draft Policy CC7 states that development proposals which are likely to cause 
pollution or are likely to be exposed to potential unacceptable levels of 
pollution or land instability will only be permitted where it can be 
demonstrated that measures can be implemented to minimise impacts to a 
satisfactory level which protects health, environmental quality and amenity. 
5.7.13 
Draft Policy HQ6 states that the Council will ensure that all developments are 
of the highest possible quality and respond positively to their context. It states 
that all development proposals should ensure that, inter alia, a clear 
distinction between public and private space using clear boundaries. 
proposals are complimentary to the existing natural environment, there is not 
an unacceptable adverse impact upon nearby existing or permitted uses, 
including impacts on amenity, privacy, noise or air quality; resources are used 
80 
 
efficiently and energy and water efficiency is maximised; and any lighting 
associated with the development does not have a detrimental impact on the 
surrounding areas.  
5.7.14 
Draft Policy DC1 states that outside Settlement Envelopes the Council will 
work to maintain and enhance the intrinsic character and beauty of the 
countryside and only particular types of new development will be permitted. 
Central Bedfordshire Planning Obligations SPD (North) (2009) 
5.7.15 
The Central Bedfordshire Planning Obligations SPD (North) (2009) sets out 
proposals for negotiating and securing planning obligations associated with 
new development in Central Bedfordshire; however the approach contained 
within the Planning Obligations SPD (North) towards securing planning 
obligations is now no longer in use.   
5.7.16 
Central Bedfordshire Council is currently preparing a revised Planning 
Obligations Strategy for the whole of Central Bedfordshire which will sit 
alongside the CIL Charging Schedule. However, Central Bedfordshire 
Council are currently reviewing the charging schedule following the 
withdrawal of the Development Strategy in November 2015, and there is no 
agreed timescale for future work at this stage. due for adoption later in 2015.  
Prior to adoption of the revised Planning Obligations Strategy, planning 
obligations will be determined on a case-by-case basis. 
Central Bedfordshire Design Guide (2014) 
5.7.17 
The Central Bedfordshire Design Guide (2014) was adopted on 18th March 
2014 as technical guidance for development management purposes. The 
Design Guide sets out the key principles and standards to ensure the delivery 
of high quality design in Central Bedfordshire.  The document comprises one 
core chapter, entitled ‘Placemaking in Central Bedfordshire’, and nine 
accompanying themed supplements, including a chapter entitled ‘Green 
Infrastructure, Climate Change Adaptation and Sustainable Buildings’. 
Central Bedfordshire Sustainable Drainage Guide (2015) 
5.7.18 
The Central Bedfordshire Sustainable Drainage Guide provides technical 
guidance on the application of SuDS within Central Bedfordshire. It has been 
created to be a comprehensive resource for SuDS reference and policy 
development for decision makers and designers, developers and partner 
organisations to support the application of SUDS in a range of contexts 
across Central Bedfordshire.  
Central Bedfordshire Landscape Character Assessment (2015)  
5.7.19 
The Central Bedfordshire Landscape Character Assessment is a revision of 
the previous LCAs for the county of Bedfordshire covering the former Mid 
Beds and South Beds districts following unitary reorganisation. The LCA of 
Central Bedfordshire provides a comprehensive landscape evidence base to 
help underpin planning and management decisions in the Unitary Authority. 
The assessment presents a characterisation of the whole Unitary Authority 
81 
 
through 10 landscape types, and each landscape type is subdivided into 
component landscape character areas. 
Bedford Borough Council 
Bedford Borough Climate Change and Pollution SPD (2008) 
5.7.20 
The Bedford Borough Climate Change and Pollution SPD (2008) was 
adopted in December 2008 in order to give detailed guidance on the 
implementation of Policy CP26 of the Council’s Core Strategy and Rural 
Issues Plan, which concerns climate change and pollution. The document 
seeks to promote a more sustainable approach to energy use, and provide 
practical advice on, inter alia, how to reduce carbon emissions, conserve 
water, minimise waste and minimise pollution. 
Bedford Borough Planning Obligations SPD (2013) 
5.7.21 
The Bedford Borough Planning Obligations SPD (2013) was adopted in July 
2013.  The SPD explains the Council’s policies and procedures for securing 
developer contributions through planning conditions and obligations in S106 
Agreements, as well as providing evidence and guidance to developers about 
the types of contributions that will be sought.   
Forest of Marston Vale Plan (FoMVP) 
5.7.22 
The Project Site is located within the Forest of Marston Vale and therefore 
the Forest of Marston Vale Plan (FoMVP) provides planning guidance of 
relevance to the Project.  The FoMVP was published as non-statutory 
planning guidance by Marston Vale Trust in 2000, in order to guide the 
creation of the Forest of Marston Vale as a Community Forest.  The FoMVP 
is a tool to achieve Forest objectives and support countryside enhancement 
policies, and the plan provides that it shall be a material consideration in the 
local authority’s determination of planning applications for development 
within the Forest boundary.  The publication of the Plan followed the 
designation of the Forest of Marston Vale as a Community Forest through 
the Forests for the Community programme, which aimed to achieve major 
environmental improvements around towns and cities. 
5.7.23 
The Project Site is located within the Brickfields Landscape Zone of the 
Forest of Marston Vale (FoMVP pg.15), as illustrated in Figure 5.5. 
5.7.24 
The FoMVP identifies the site as located within the Brickfields Landscape 
Zone (Page 15). According to the Plan, the area is dominated by clay pits 
and their varying after-uses, transport infrastructure and expanding village 
settlements. This area is identified as a core area of the Vale where there is 
a need to secure a higher level of new planting than elsewhere in the 
community forest (Page 16).  
 
 
82 
 
Figure 5-5: Forest of Marston Vale Landscape Zones (Extract from FoMVP) 
 
5.7.25 
The FoMVP notes that the Brickfields Landscape Zone “is the core area of 
the Vale where there is a need to secure a higher level of new planting than 
elsewhere in the Community Forest”, in order to offer landscape, wildlife, 
recreation and amenity benefits (page 16).  Proposals for the Brickfields 
Landscape Zone include: “The Team will work with landowners to secure a 
higher proportion of woodland planting in this area than the more 
agriculturally productive land to either side of the Vale. All land types will need 
to be targeted to deliver the level of planting needed and landscape impacts 
of project work will need to be assessed from both the Vale floor and elevated 
positions on the ridges” (page 17). 
5.7.26 
The FoMVP also provides further guidance in respect of woodland creation 
and tree planting.  Page 21 of the FoMVP notes that, “Tree planting is the 
core objective of the Community Forest with the new woodland providing a 
setting for a wide range of other activities.  Significant areas of tree planting 
will be secured towards the 30% target, with the core Brickfields and urban 
fringe zones being targeted for the highest proportion of tree planting. 
Reduced tree cover will be sought on the land to the east and west.”  
Furthermore, in this regard, the FoMVP continues, that, “Opportunities 
offered through the restoration of landfill and derelict sites and planning 
agreements offer the greatest future prospects for large scale woodland 
creation” (page 21). 
 
 
83 
 
5.7.28 
The FoMVP states that woodland creation and tree planting will be achieved 
through a number of means, including: 
 “implementing an annual programme of tree planting towards realising 
the long-term aim of 30% woodland cover in the Vale over a 40 year 
period.  Joint working with landowners and organisations such as the 
Woodland Trust, local authorities and Forestry Commission will be 
promoted;” 
 “promoting well designed new woodlands, as a resource, to deliver a 
wide range of landscape, economic, social and environmental 
benefits. Particular emphasis will be placed on securing larger 
woodlands (>20 ha) and those that meet defragmentation, urban 
fringe and access objectives in accordance with the England Forestry 
Strategy and DETR targets;” 
 “encouraging and supporting landowners to ensure that all new 
woodlands are successfully established and well maintained, and 
developing new services to assist with this, where appropriate;” 
 “working with planning authorities to ensure that developments 
provide opportunities to secure large scale new woodland creation in 
appropriate areas;” 
 “working with site owners and planning authorities to ensure that 
restoration schemes for derelict land and landfill sites meet Forest 
landscape, wildlife and recreation objectives;” 
 “seeking opportunities to secure land for woodland creation. This 
could be through acquisition, leasing, management partnerships or 
other suitable mechanisms.” 
5.7.29 
The FoMVP also notes that, “As part of creating the varied and well-wooded 
countryside of the Community Forest, the creation and management of a 
range of habitats other than woodland, such as farmland, grassland, and 
wetland, is important” (page 24).  Accordingly, page 26 of the FoMVP states 
that non-woodland habitats will be managed and created through a number 
of means, including: 
 securing opportunities to maximise the ecological potential of the 
Marston Vale. This work will be done in conjunction with organisations 
such as the Wildlife Trust and English Nature and is to be guided by 
Biodiversity Action Plans where possible; 
 using the Countryside Stewardship Scheme or other means to secure 
new hedgerow planting and enhanced management. Networks of 
well-managed farmland and roadside hedges that link other habitats 
will be developed or strengthened; 
84 
 
 increasing and conserving areas of ecologically valuable grassland 
within the Community Forest, in partnership with the appropriate site 
owners and managers; 
 promoting the appropriate management and increasing the amount of 
wetland 
habitats 
throughout 
the 
Marston 
Vale, 
including 
watercourses, ponds, lakes and any marsh areas. 
 working with the Wildlife Trust, Bedfordshire County Council, English 
Nature and other partners to ensure that any rare habitats and species 
are conserved and their status enhanced. Sites of Special Scientific 
Interest and County Wildlife Sites will be particularly important in this 
area of work.

Assessment 
6.1 
Introduction 
6.1.1 
Section 104 of the PA 2008 provides that in making decisions on applications, 
the SoS must have regard (amongst certain other documents and matters) 
to any relevant NPS and must decide applications in accordance with such 
relevant NPS(s) unless the adverse impacts of the proposal would outweigh 
its benefits (or in certain other limited circumstances).   
6.1.2 
Section 104 of the PA 2008 also requires the SoS to have regard to any Local 
Impact Report and other matters which the SoS “thinks are both important 
and relevant to [the SoS’s] decision”.   
6.1.3 
This section of the Planning Statement provides an assessment of the Project 
in regard to relevant NPS guidance contained within NPS EN-1, NPS EN-2, 
NPS EN-4 and NPS EN-5, as well as other matters which are considered to 
be both “important and relevant” (Section 104, PA 2008). 
6.2 
National Policy Statements 
6.2.1 
NPS EN-1 is a relevant NPS for any energy NSIP, along with the relevant 
technology specific NPS.  For the DCO Application this includes NPS EN-2 
National Policy Statement for Fossil Fuel Electricity Generating Infrastructure 
and NPS EN-4 - National Policy Statement for Gas Supply Infrastructure. The 
majority of EN-5 does not apply to the Project, since its electrical 
infrastructure is to be predominantly underground. However NPS EN-5 is of 
relevance in respect of the substation and SECs and so is referred to where 
relevant in this document. 
6.2.2 
Section 6.2 of this Planning Statement provides an assessment of the Project 
in regard to relevant NPS guidance contained within NPS EN-1, NPS EN-2, 
NPS EN-4 and NPS EN-5. 
Overarching National Policy Statement for Energy (EN-1) 
General Approach 
6.2.3 
NPS EN-1 sets out the Government’s overall policy towards the delivery of 
major energy infrastructure. 
6.2.4 
Paragraph 1.1.1 of NPS EN-1 states that ‘this NPS, when combined with the 
relevant technology-specific energy NPS, provides the primary basis for 
decisions’.  The relevant technology-specific energy NPS for this Application 
are NPS EN-2, EN-4 and EN-5 as set out below. 
6.2.5 
Paragraph 4.1.5 of NPS EN-1 states that Development Plan Documents or 
other documents in the Local Development Framework may be both 
important and relevant considerations to SoS decision-making.  The 
provisions of documents from the Local Development Framework for both 
Central Bedfordshire and Bedford Borough which are both ‘important and 
86 
 
relevant’ to the DCO Application are set out and considered with reference 
to the Project in section 6.3 below. 
The need for new nationally significant infrastructure projects 
6.2.6 
Paragraph 3.1.3 of NPS EN-1 states that all development consent 
applications for energy infrastructure should be assessed ‘on the basis that 
the Government has demonstrated that there is a need for those types of 
infrastructure and that the scale and urgency of that need is as described for 
each of them in this Part.’  Accordingly, the SoS ‘should give substantial 
weight to the contribution which projects would make towards satisfying this 
need when considering applications for development consent under the 
Planning Act 2008’ (paragraph 3.1.4) [emphasis added].  Section 3.3 of NPS 
EN-1 sets out the key reasons why the Government believes there is an 
‘urgent need’ for new electricity NSIPs (paragraph 3.3.1), including: 
 Meeting energy security and carbon reduction objectives; 
 The need to replace closing electricity generating capacity; 
 The need for more electricity capacity to support an increased supply 
from renewables; and 
 Future increases in electricity demand. 
6.2.7 
The need for the Project, in the context of paragraph 3.1.3 and paragraph 
3.3.1 of NPS EN-1 is set out further in section 4 of this Planning Statement. 
6.2.8 
In the context of paragraph 3.1.3 and paragraph 3.3.1 of NPS EN-1, as 
explained throughout this Planning Statement, the development of the 
Project would allow for the rapid, reliable and viable provision of reserve 
capacity to the National Grid, supporting the transition to a low carbon 
economy by balancing some of the considerable scale of intermittent sources 
such as wind being developed UK-wide, and playing an important role in 
meeting the UK’s national energy requirements.  As such, the SoS should 
give substantial weight to the contribution of the Project to meeting the 
identified need for energy infrastructure, in accordance with paragraph 3.1.4 
of NPS EN-1. 
6.2.9 
Paragraph 3.7.3 of NPS EN-1 stresses that new electricity network 
infrastructure projects add to the reliability of the national energy supply and 
provide crucial national benefits which are shared by all users of the system. 
6.2.10 
The Project would add to the reliability of the energy supply and provide 
significant benefits in accordance with the provisions of paragraph 3.7.3 of 
NPS EN-1.  The Generating Equipment would operate as a ‘peaking plant’, 
designed to operate when there is a surge in demand for electricity or when 
there is a sudden drop in power being generated from power stations which 
are constantly in operation. It will also support intermittent forms of renewable 
energy which are weather dependent (e.g. wind and solar). 
87 
 
6.2.11 
Paragraph 3.3.25 of NPS EN-1 states that, whilst alternatives to the need for 
new large scale electricity infrastructure have been considered – including: 
reducing demand; more intelligent use of electricity; and interconnection of 
electricity systems – the Government believes that these measures will not 
be sufficient to meet energy and climate change objectives on their own.  
Further to this, paragraph 3.6.1 of NPS EN-1 recognises the ‘vital role’ that 
fossil fuel power stations play in providing electricity supplies, and states that 
‘they will continue to play an important role in our energy mix as the UK 
makes the transition to a low carbon economy.’ 
6.2.12 
MPL acknowledges the need for new large energy infrastructure identified in 
paragraph 3.3.25 of NPS EN-1 and the ‘vital role’ that fossil fuel power 
stations play in providing energy supplies as set out in paragraph 3.6.1 of 
NPS EN-1.  As explained throughout this Planning Statement, the 
development of the Project would allow for the rapid, reliable and viable 
provision of reserve capacity to the National Grid, supporting the transition to 
a low carbon economy by balancing some of the considerable scale of 
intermittent sources such as wind being developed UK-wide, and playing an 
important role in meeting the UK’s national energy requirements.   
Assessment Principles 
6.2.13 
Paragraph 4.1.2 of NPS EN-1 states that, given the level and urgency of need 
for energy infrastructure, the SoS ‘should start with a presumption in favour 
of granting consent to applications for energy NSIPs.’ 
6.2.14 
The Project is classified as an NSIP under Section 15 of the PA 2008, as 
explained at section 2.4 of this Planning Statement, and the urgent need for 
the Project is explained at section 4 of this Planning Statement.  As such, in 
accordance with paragraph 4.1.2 of NPS EN-1, there should be a 
presumption in favour of granting consent for the Project.   
6.2.15 
Paragraph 4.1.3 of NPS EN-1 explains that the SoS will weigh up a 
proposal’s contribution to meeting the need for energy infrastructure, job 
creation and other long term and wider benefits, against the potential adverse 
impacts of the proposal in question including ‘any long-term and cumulative 
adverse impacts, as well as any measures to avoid, reduce or compensate 
for any adverse impacts.’ 
6.2.16 
As explained at section 7.3 of this Planning Statement, the Project will 
provide a number of benefits and will contribute to the urgent need for energy 
generation, as identified throughout NPS EN-1, the Gas Generation Strategy 
(DECC, 2012), and the National Infrastructure Plan (HM Treasury, 2014). 
The Project would contribute materially to the immediate and medium term 
needs for flexible, reliable, peak load power generation and facilitate the 
transition to a low carbon economy.  The chosen technology for a peaking 
plant would help to ‘balance out’ the grid at times of peak electricity demand 
and help to support the grid at times when intermittent renewable sources 
cannot generate electricity.  Furthermore, as set out at Chapter 14 of the ES 
(Document Reference 6.1), the Project will deliver positive impacts through 
employment creation in construction, operation and decommissioning 
88 
 
stages; and supply chain linkages for goods and services and workers 
spending in the local economy.  The potential adverse impacts of the Project 
are explained at section 7.2 of this Planning Statement.  The likely impacts 
have been minimised wherever possible, and other effects avoided through 
appropriate specification, siting and design. 
6.2.17 
Paragraph 4.1.4 of NPS EN-1 explains that the SoS should take into account 
‘environmental, social and economic benefits and adverse impacts, at 
national, regional and local levels’ whether identified in the NPSs or 
elsewhere, including in local impact reports.  
6.2.18 
In accordance with the provisions of paragraph 4.1.4 of NPS EN-1, an EIA 
has been undertaken to consider the likely impacts of the Project in respect 
of air quality; noise and vibration; ecology; water quality and resources; 
geology, ground conditions and hydrogeology; landscape and visual impacts 
assessment; traffic, transport and access; archaeology and cultural heritage; 
socio-economics; waste; health; and EMF.  The findings of the EIA are 
presented in the ES (Document Reference 6.1). 
6.2.19 
Paragraph 4.1.5 of NPS EN-1 states that other matters that the SoS may 
consider both important and relevant to its decision-making could include 
Development Plan Documents or other documents in the Local Development 
Framework and explains that, ‘in the event of a conflict between these or any 
other documents and an NPS, the NPS prevails.’  The Project has sought to 
consider the provisions of the Local Development Frameworks for both 
Central Bedfordshire Council and Bedford Borough Council.  Matters which 
are both important and relevant from the Local Development Frameworks are 
set out and considered in the context of the Project at section 6.3 of this 
Planning Statement. 
6.2.20 
Paragraph 4.1.7 of NPS EN-1 confirms that the SoS will have regard to the 
guidance in Circular 11/95, as revised, on “The Use of Conditions in Planning 
Permissions” in agreeing or suggesting requirements in a DCO. Paragraph 
4.1.8 states that, “The [SoS] may take into account any development consent 
obligations that an applicant agrees with local authorities.”  Paragraph 4.1.9 
of NPS EN-1 states that viability issues are unlikely to be of relevance to 
decision making providing that the technical feasibility of the proposal has 
been properly assessed, but limited exceptions exist and are set out in NPS 
EN-1 and others. 
6.2.21 
In respect of paragraph 4.1.7 of NPS EN-1, although Circular 11/95 has in 
part been superseded by advice contained within NPPG, the Applicant notes 
that the general advice remains essentially similar.  MPL has had regard to 
this guidance in the preparation of the Statement of Proposed Heads of 
Terms for an Agreement Pursuant to s106 of the TCPA 1990 (Document 
Reference 10.3) which should be taken into account in accordance with 
paragraph 4.1.8 of NPS EN-1. 
 
 
89 
 
Environmental Statement 
6.2.22 
Paragraph 4.2.1 of NPS EN-1 advises that, ‘[a]ll proposals for projects that 
are subject to the European Environmental Impact Assessment Directive 
must be accompanied by an Environmental Statement describing the 
aspects of the environment likely to be significantly affected by the project.’  
Further, paragraph 4.2.1 of NPS EN-1 states that the Environmental 
Statement should include an assessment of the likely significant effects of 
the proposed project on the environment, including direct, indirect, 
secondary, cumulative, short, medium and long-term, permanent and 
temporary, positive and negative effects at all stages of the project.   
6.2.23 
In accordance with paragraph 4.2.1 of NPS EN-1, an ES (Document 
Reference 6.1) has been prepared and accompanies the DCO Application.  
The ES (Document Reference 6.1) includes an assessment of all likely 
significant effects at all stages of the Project, in respect of air quality; noise 
and vibration; ecology; water quality and resources; geology, ground 
conditions and hydrogeology; landscape and visual impacts; traffic, transport 
and access; archaeology and cultural heritage; and socio-economics. 
6.2.24 
Paragraph 4.2.3 of NPS EN-1 adds that ‘the ES should cover the 
environmental, social and economic effects arising from pre-construction, 
construction, operation and decommissioning of the project.’   
6.2.25 
In accordance with paragraph 4.2.3 of NPS EN-1, the ES (Document 
Reference 6.1) contains an assessment of all likely environmental, social and 
economic effects at all stages of the Project, in respect of air quality; noise 
and vibration; ecology; water quality and resources; geology, ground 
conditions and hydrogeology; landscape and visual impacts; traffic, transport 
and access; archaeology and cultural heritage; and socio-economics. 
6.2.26 
Paragraph 4.2.5 of NPS EN-1 advises that the ES should provide information 
on how the effects of the proposal combine and interact with the effects of 
other development, including projects for which consent is sought or granted, 
as well as those already in existence. 
6.2.27 
In accordance with paragraph 4.2.5 of NPS EN-1, the ES (Document 
Reference 6.1) contains information on the cumulative effects of the Project 
in combination with the effects of other development, including projects for 
which consent has been sought or granted, as well as those already in 
existence, in respect of air quality; noise and vibration; ecology; water quality 
and resources; geology, ground conditions and hydrogeology; landscape and 
visual impacts; traffic, transport and access; archaeology and cultural 
heritage; and socio-economics. 
Habitats and Species Regulations 
6.2.28 
In respect of Habitats and Species Regulations, paragraph 4.3.1 of NPS EN-
1 advises applicants to consult with Natural England and to subsequently 
undertake an Appropriate Assessment if required.   
90 
 
6.2.29 
MPL consulted Natural England during EIA Scoping, consultation meetings 
and two phases of statutory Section 42 consultation, as recorded within the 
Consultation Report (Document Reference 5.1) and ES (Document 
Reference 6.1), with regards to the potential ecological impacts of the Project 
and the potential need for a HRA Screening Assessment.  Natural England 
advised that it was unnecessary to undertake a HRA Screening Assessment 
given the distance (27km) from the Project Site to the nearest Natura 2000 
site.  Notwithstanding this, a No Significant Effects Report (Document 
Reference 5.7) has been prepared and forms part of this Application.  The 
No Significant Effects Report (Document Reference 5.7) concludes that the 
Project will not result in any significant adverse effects on the nearest 
European site, Chiltern Beechwoods SAC, either alone or in combination with 
other plans or projects. 
Alternatives 
6.2.30 
Paragraph 4.4.1 of NPS EN-1 notes that, “the relevance or otherwise to the 
decision-making process of the existence (or alleged existence) of 
alternatives to the proposed development is in the first instance a matter of 
law, detailed guidance on which falls outside the scope of this NPS. From a 
policy perspective this NPS does not contain any general requirement to 
consider alternatives or to establish whether the proposed project represents 
the best option.”  However, paragraph 4.4.2 of NPS EN-1 states that 
applicants are obliged to include, as a matter of fact, information about the 
main alternatives that have been considered within the ES, including the main 
reasons for the applicant’s choice, taking into account the environmental, 
social and economic effects.   
6.2.31 
In accordance with paragraph 4.4.2 of NPS EN-1, Chapter 5 of the ES 
(Document Reference 6.1) provides details regarding the alternatives that 
have been considered as part of the Project, as summarised below, in 
respect of:  
 Alternative development sites;  
 Alternative technologies for electricity generation;  
 Alternative layouts for the Gas Connection Route Corridor; and 
 Alternative options for Electrical Connection. 
6.2.32 
The Project alternatives have been assessed in detail by MPL and have been 
subject to consultation with key stakeholders and the local community during 
the two phases of non-statutory and statutory consultation, as recorded within 
the Consultation Report (Document Reference 5.1). 
Alternative Development Sites 
6.2.33 
In deciding upon the location of the Project Site, MPL undertook a detailed 
feasibility assessment having regard to a number of technical, environmental, 
and economic factors in accordance with NPS EN-1. The key factors 
91 
 
considered necessary in selecting a suitable site for a project such as this 
one were broadly fourfold; technical, environmental, economic, and in line 
with local planning policy.  
6.2.34 
As part of a detailed feasibility assessment, the Applicant looked at a range 
of sites around the UK to support power generation plants of this nature. This 
search for potential power generation plant sites across the UK was focused 
on areas that were capable of meeting the Applicant’s strategic project 
development criteria, which included:  
 Acceptable proximity to the national gas transmission system & the 
national electricity transmission system or local distribution networks;  
 Located within areas that are net importers of electricity; and 
 Located within areas of compatible land use designation/s. 
6.2.35 
In terms of technical constraints, the size of the site (i.e. large enough to 
support a power generation plant of up to 299 MW and integral infrastructure) 
and the proximity of a site to appropriate gas and electrical connection points 
were both key considerations. 
6.2.36 
From an environmental perspective, the site must have due regard to close 
sensitive receptors such as residential properties or sites of ecological 
importance (to avoid unacceptable impacts arising in respect of, amongst 
other considerations, noise and visual disturbance), the current nature of the 
surrounding area (to limit impacts on the landscape character of the area), 
previous site uses and land quality (to avoid sterilisation of the best and most 
versatile agricultural land or mineral assets) and proximity to sensitive 
ecological habitats. 
6.2.37 
Based on these factors, the Project Site was considered suitable for the 
following reasons: 
 Close proximity to the gas National Transmission System; 
 Close proximity to a suitable electrical connection (400 kV overhead 
line); 
 The Generating Equipment Site is within previously developed land, 
lying below ground level (which is of use in screening the 
development); 
 It is within an area identified as being potentially suitable for energy 
infrastructure; 
 It has a well-developed road network for access to the Generating 
Equipment Site; 
 The Project Site is outside of areas at risk of flooding; 
92 
 
 There is adequate space to develop the Power Generation Plant and 
integral infrastructure; and 
 The Project Site is located in an area of net electricity import, and 
therefore there is demand for this type of development. 
Alternative technologies for electricity generation 
6.2.38 
The following technology options have been considered for the Power 
Generation Plant: OCGT plant, Combined Cycle Gas Turbine (CCGT) plant, 
and Reciprocating Gas Engines (RGE) plant. 
6.2.39 
The operation of OCGT plant is described in the ES (Document Reference 
6.1) section 3.2.  CCGT plant consist of the same plant items as OCGT, 
although they also utilise a heat recovery steam generator (HRSG) which 
uses the waste heat from the exhaust gases to produce steam which is used 
to power a steam turbine. RGE plant are similar in operation to a large internal 
combustion engine, with a crankshaft driven by pistons. 
6.2.40 
OCGT is considered to be the most suitable technology choice for generating 
up to 299 MW as a peaking plant at the Project Site based on the following 
environmental, technical and feasibility considerations: 
 Visual Impact: OCGT plants require shorter stack(s) compared to 
CCGT plant and therefore are less visually intrusive in views from the 
surrounding environment;  
 Water Resources: Since no cooling is required for the condensing of 
steam, the cooling requirements of OCGT plants are significantly 
lower than, for example, CCGT plants. The auxiliary cooling 
requirements (for lubrication oil, etc.) would be met via dry air cooling 
through the use of fin-fan coolers or Air Cooled Condensers (ACC). 
The water requirement of a OCGT plant is therefore significantly lower 
than for CCGT plants;  
 Noise and Available Space: noise levels from a OCGT plant would 
typically be lower than for an RGE plant. A larger number of RGE units 
would be required at the Generating Equipment Site to generate up to 
299 MW.  Spatially this may not be possible; 
 Financial: based on the anticipated electricity market, it is essential 
that the Power Generation Plant of the size proposed would be 
particularly cost effective, as it would be called upon to operate flexibly 
to balance out the National Grid and meet changing demands of 
customers; and 
 Start-up times: OCGT plants are able to start up and shut down much 
quicker than similar sized CCGT plants and are, therefore, better 
suited to meeting variable demand. 
 
 
93 
 
Gas Connection  
6.2.41 
The Project Scoping Report described a Gas Connection ‘Opportunity Area’, 
to the south and east of the Generating Equipment Site, somewhere in which 
a new underground gas pipeline and AGI would be developed. Following 
publication of the Scoping Report, further studies refined this Opportunity 
Area such that there were two remaining Gas Connection Route Corridor 
Options presented in the 2014 PEIR and formally consulted upon in June 
2014 as part of the Phase 1 Statutory Consultation. A preferred gas 
connection route and AGI location were also presented within the more 
southerly Route Corridor Option at that consultation stage. 
6.2.42 
As a result of further refinement, studies and feedback received from the 
Phase 1 Statutory Consultation process, a spatially refined Gas Connection 
Route Corridor has been brought forward as the selected Gas Connection 
Option to be used in the design of the Project. The Gas Connection Route 
Corridor was chosen as the most suitable route because it is the most direct 
and shortest connection between the National Transmission System and the 
Generating Equipment Site, avoiding obstructions such as roads, other high 
pressure gas pipelines, railways, large changes in elevation, water bodies 
and protected sites as much as possible. It is therefore less expensive and 
damaging to agricultural land. An alternative AGI location to that suggested 
in the 2014 PEIR has been selected following consultation with the land 
owner, who was concerned about sterilisation of prime agricultural land.  
Electrical Connection 
6.2.43 
The Project's Scoping Report described an Electrical Connection Opportunity 
Area to the south of the Generating Equipment Site, somewhere in which the 
Electrical Connection would be developed. Following publication of the 
Scoping Report, further studies were undertaken to refine the available 
options.  
6.2.44 
Studies undertaken up to Phase 1 Statutory Consultation and feedback 
received during the Phase 1 Statutory Consultation determined that the most 
suitable location for the Substation was within Rookery South Pit, adjacent 
to the Generating Equipment Site. The main reasons for siting the substation 
in this location are as follows: 
 lower visual impact - the Substation would be located entirely within 
Rookery South Pit, which will be approximately 15m below ground 
once the LLRS works are complete. The maximum height of the tallest 
structures within the substation would be 17.5 m, meaning they would 
be substantially screened by the pit. If the substation were to be 
developed outside of the Rookery South Pit, it would need to be sited 
to the south on higher lying agricultural land. In this location, the 
substation would be substantially more visually intrusive, particularly 
if viewed from the south and east. 
 reduced effect on agricultural land – as stated above, should the 
substation be located outside of the Rookery South Pit, it would be 
94 
 
developed on agricultural land. This would not only take more 
greenfield land over and above the three net additional towers, but 
could also impact on drainage runoff rates as agricultural land would 
be replaced by hardstanding. 
 reduced effect on previously undisturbed ground – previously 
undeveloped land outside of the Generating Equipment Site is known 
to have the potential to support buried archaeology. Therefore, 
avoiding this area and instead using land in Rookery South Pit which 
has previously been disturbed, removes a potential impact on the 
archaeology and cultural heritage of the area. 
6.2.45 
The 2014 PEIR confirmed that the proposed substation would then connect 
to the existing 400 kV double circuit Grendon - Sundon 400 kV line, operated 
by NGET. The line is situated approximately 320 m southwest of the 
Generating Equipment Site. 
6.2.46 
With respect to the connection between the Substation to the NETS, a 
number of options have been considered and ruled out, for technical or 
financial reasons. 
6.2.47 
The 2014 PEIR also confirmed that for environmental assessment purposes, 
a worst case scenario of up to two 400 kV double circuit overhead line 
circuits with up to seven new transmission towers was considered. It was 
also explained that one of the proposed towers would replace an existing 
tower. Consultees were invited to comment on the proposed worst case 
connection scenario. 
6.2.48 
MPL explained in the 2014 PEIR (Chapter 5) that further liaison with NGET 
would take place regarding the indicative design of the [then] proposed 
connection prior to making a final decision which would be taken forward to 
the DCO Application. 
6.2.49 
Following the conclusion of the Phase 1 Statutory Consultation in 2014 
subsequent engagement and technical assessment concluded that there 
were four potentially viable electrical connection options, including two 
overhead line and two underground cable options. These options are 
summarised in detail in the PEIR (Chapter 5). 
6.2.50 
The Phase 1 Statutory Consultation generated a number of responses 
expressing concerns over the potential impacts of new pylons on the 
landscape and visual amenity, and in particular the potential for adverse 
effects on Ampthill Park. During its evaluation of responses, MPL recognised 
that consultees had expressed a strong preference for the development of 
an underground cable connection option. These views were taken on board 
by MPL and a presumption in favour of developing a wholly or partially 
underground cable option was adopted by the Project team. This was 
considered to represent more limited potential for significant adverse 
landscape and visual impacts than an overhead line option. 
95 
 
6.2.51 
As a result, two options were provided in respect of electrical connection, as 
detailed in section 3.4 of the PEIR. 
6.2.52 
Following further consultation with National Grid regarding the preferred 
choice of Electrical Connection from the MPL site to the 400kV National 
Electricity Transmission line to the south, it was concluded that Electrical 
Connection option 2 is less suitable than option 1. As a result, Electrical 
Connection option 1, comprising a double circuit tee-in and two SECs which 
will be located on either side of the existing transmission line. 
Criteria for “good design“ for energy infrastructure 
6.2.53 
Paragraph 4.5.1 of NPS EN-1 states that good design for energy 
infrastructure ‘should produce sustainable infrastructure sensitive to place, 
efficient in the use of natural resources and energy used in their construction 
and operation, matched by an appearance that demonstrates good aesthetic 
as far as possible.’  However, paragraph 4.5.1 of NPS EN-1 also 
acknowledges that ‘the nature of much energy infrastructure development 
will often limit the extent to which it can contribute to the enhancement of the 
quality of the area.’  
6.2.54 
In accordance with paragraph 4.5.1 of NPS EN-1, MPL has sought to adopt 
good design principles from the outset of the Project such that the 
development is sensitive to its setting and is of a good aesthetic as possible.  
As illustrated in the Design and Access Statement (Document Reference 
10.2), the form, scale, massing and landscaping has been designed so that 
the Power Generation Plant blends in with its surroundings minimising visual 
intrusion from key viewpoints.   
6.2.55 
Paragraph 4.5.3 of NPS EN-1 seeks that proposals are “sustainable and, 
having regard to regulatory and other constraints, are as attractive, durable 
and adaptable (including taking account of natural hazards such as flooding) 
as they can be”.   Further, Paragraph 4.5.3 of NPS EN-1 states that “Whilst 
the applicant may not have any or very limited choice in the physical 
appearance of some energy infrastructure, there may be opportunities for the 
applicant to demonstrate good design in terms of siting relative to existing 
landscape character, landform and vegetation.”  
6.2.56 
In accordance with paragraph 4.5.3 of NPS EN-1, and as set out in the 
Design and Access Statement (Document Reference 10.2), as far as is 
reasonably practical, the Power Generation Plant will use materials which 
can be disposed of sustainably (e.g. easily re-usable or recyclable) when the 
plant has reached the end of its life but primarily have been selected for their 
durability and safety across at least a 25-year lifespan. The technology 
chosen has an inherently low requirement for process water. As set out within 
the Outline Landscaping Plans (Document Reference 2.9), the design of 
landscape planting will enhance the area’s biodiversity through the retention 
of existing woodland; the planting of belts of trees to increase the amount of 
woodland in the area; the reinstatement of planting where possible and 
appropriate; and careful management of soils during construction works to 
96 
 
facilitate plant growth, to be implemented as part of the Construction 
Environmental Management Plant (CEMP).   
6.2.57 
Paragraph 4.5.4 of NPS EN-1 seeks that applicants “demonstrate in their 
application documents how the design process was conducted and how the 
proposed design evolved. Where a number of different designs were 
considered, applicants should set out the reasons why the favoured choice 
has been selected”.  Further, paragraph 4.5.4 of NPS EN-1 notes that “in 
considering applications the [SoS] should take into account the ultimate 
purpose of the infrastructure and bear in mind the operational, safety and 
security requirements which the design has to satisfy.” 
6.2.58 
In accordance with paragraph 4.5.4 of NPS EN-1, the design evolution is 
explained in the Design and Access Statement (Document Reference 10.2) 
and also the Consultation Report (Document Reference 5.1) which explains 
carefully each stage of the Project, the nature of consultation exercises, the 
responses received and which influenced the design.  
6.2.59 
In accordance with paragraph 4.5.4 of NPS EN-1, the main operational, 
safety and security requirements are set out in the ES (Document Reference 
6.1) which describes the requirements for sufficient space between certain 
installations (particularly the gas receiving installation and the banking 
compound), safety fencing, security perimeter and a gatehouse. The work 
packages are designed to achieve an appropriate balance between the likely 
operational requirements (and thus a deliverable energy generation project) 
and minimising visual effects.  The Design Principles (part of the Design and 
Access Statement (Document Reference 10.2, Appendix 2)) will also assist 
in achieving this balance.  The design has also sought to use the site layout 
in the most efficient way, by locating plant items in close proximity to 
connections (e.g. gas and electrical infrastructure) and by locating the Power 
Generation Plant so that it benefits from the maximum screening effects of 
other existing developments and natural site topography.  
6.2.60 
Paragraph 4.5.5 of NPS EN-1 states that “applicants are encouraged” to use 
design review services. 
6.2.61 
In accordance with paragraph 4.5.5 of NPS EN-1, the applicant has and will 
continue to liaise with the local authority in agreeing detailed designs prior to 
construction such as on detailed matters as to planting, signage and 
materials through the various requirements attached to the draft DCO 
(Document Reference 3.1, Schedule 2) and in compliance with the Design 
Principles (part of the Design and Access Statement (Document Reference 
10.2, Appendix 2)).  
Consideration of Combined Heat and Power (CHP) 
6.2.62 
Paragraph 4.6.6 of NPS EN-1 states that, ‘Under guidelines issued by DECC 
(then DTI) in 2006, any application to develop a thermal generating station 
under Section 36 of the Electricity Act 1989 must either include CHP or 
contain evidence that the possibilities for CHP have been fully explored to 
inform the IPC’s consideration of the application.’  Further, paragraph 4.6.7 
97 
 
of NPS EN-1 advises that the opportunities for CHP should be considered 
from the outset of the site selection process. 
6.2.63 
In accordance with paragraphs 4.6.6 and 4.6.7 of NPS EN-1, MPL has given 
due consideration to the potential inclusion of CHP alongside other Project 
alternatives from the outset of the Project, as set out in Chapter 5 of the ES 
(Document Reference 6.1). 
6.2.64 
Efficient CHP plants are usually designed to meet the known heat demands 
of a suitable process.  This is in direct contrast to the operation of a OCGT 
peaking plant, which is designed to operate intermittently and unpredictably 
which is not suitable for CHP where the requirements are for a constant 
supply of heat.  In addition, as OCGT plant do not have any associated HRSG 
/ steam turbine plant, the provision of steam from an OCGT plant would not 
be possible without the provision of additional steam raising plant / 
equipment, which would require more equipment to be constructed and a 
larger overall land take. As such, as explained in the ES (Document 
Reference 6.1) it is considered that there are prohibitive barriers to the 
application of CHP at the Project Site and therefore CHP is not included 
within the Project. 
Carbon Capture and Storage (CCS) and Carbon Capture Readiness (CCR) 
6.2.65 
Section 4.7 of NPS EN-1 explains the considerations to be given to CCS and 
Carbon Capture and explains that all applications for new combustion plant 
which are of a generating capacity at or over 300MW and of a type covered 
by the EU’s Large Combustion Plant Directive (LCPD) should demonstrate 
that the plant is “Carbon Capture Ready” (CCR).  
6.2.66 
The Project would not meet or exceed the threshold of 300MW and so is 
therefore not required to demonstrate Carbon Capture Readiness on the 
basis of section 4.7 of NPS-EN1. 
Climate change adaptation 
6.2.67 
Section 4.8 of EN-1 sets out considerations that applicants and the 
Examining Authority/SoS should take into account to help ensure that new 
energy infrastructure is resilient to climate change.  Paragraph 4.8.5 of NPS 
EN-1 advises that applicants ‘must consider the impacts of climate change 
when planning the location, design, build, operation and, where appropriate, 
decommissioning of new energy infrastructure.’   
6.2.68 
In accordance with paragraph 4.8.5 of NPS EN-1, MPL has considered the 
impacts of climate change in the design of the Project from the outset, as 
explained in the Design and Access Statement (Document Reference 10.2).  
MPL has undertaken detailed assessment work to consider the potential 
impacts of climate change for the Project, in accordance with paragraph 4.8.5 
of NPS EN-1.  A number of Project alternatives have been assessed by MPL, 
taking into account a range of environmental factors, as set out with Chapter 
5 of the ES (Document Reference 6.1).  The ES (Document Reference 6.1) 
contains a number of technical Chapters (including Chapters relating to air 
98 
 
quality, ecology, water quality and resources, and geology and ground 
conditions), which include consideration of the potential impacts of climate 
change and set out appropriate mitigation measures where necessary.  In 
addition, a FRA (Document Reference 5.4) has also been prepared to 
consider the potential impact of flooding on the Project. 
Grid connection 
6.2.69 
Paragraph 4.9.1 of NPS EN-1 advises applicants to consult the National Grid 
and to ensure that there is the necessary infrastructure and capacity within 
an existing or planned transmission or distribution network to accommodate 
the electricity generated.   
6.2.70 
In accordance with paragraph 4.9.1 of NPS EN-1, as part of the statutory 
phase of consultation, and as recorded within the Consultation Report 
(Document Reference 5.1), National Grid was consulted on the DCO 
Application in October/November 2014 (Phase 1 Consultation) and again in 
May-July 2017 (Phase 2 Consultation).  In order to define and evaluate the 
options available for connecting the Generating Equipment to the NETS, a 
grid connection assessment was undertaken in March 2014 (see Grid 
Connection Statement (Document Reference 9.1)). This assessment (along 
with consultations undertaken with NG) identified that the most suitable point 
of connection would be a new substation to be located adjacent to the 
western boundary of the Generating Equipment Site, which would connect 
into the existing NG double circuit 400 kV line (forming part of the NETS) 
which runs from Sundon to Grendon. The 400 kV line is located 
approximately 320 m southwest of the Generating Equipment Site (see Grid 
Connection Statement (Document Reference 9.1)). 
Pollution control and other environmental regulatory regimes 
6.2.71 
Paragraph 4.10.1 of NPS EN-1 advises that ‘Issues relating to discharges or 
emissions from a proposed project which affect air quality, water quality, land 
quality and the marine environment, or which include noise and vibration may 
be subject to separate regulation under the pollution control framework or 
other consenting and licensing regimes.’ 
6.2.72 
In accordance with paragraph 4.10.1 of NPS EN-1, MPL acknowledges that 
some issues may be subject to separate regulatory regimes, and has 
prepared a Details of Other Consents and Licences document (Document 
Reference 5.6) which set outs details of the other consents and licences 
required and when they will be applied for. The required additional consents 
and licences are set out in more detail in the Details of Other Consents and 
Licences Required document (Document Reference 5.6). 
Safety 
6.2.73 
Paragraph 4.11.1 of NPS EN-1 advises applicants to consult with the HSE 
on matters relating to safety which are relevant to the construction, operation 
and decommissioning of energy infrastructure. 
99 
 
6.2.74 
In accordance with paragraph 4.11.1 of NPS EN-1, MPL consulted the HSE 
during statutory Section 42 consultation in October/November 2014 and 
again in May-July 2017, as set out in the Consultation Report (Document 
Reference 5.1).  The HSE advised that the Project Site falls within the 
consultation zones of three major accident hazard pipelines – the 7 Feeder 
Old Warden/Slapton MAHP, the 9 Feeder Huntingdon/Whitwell MAHP, and 
the 36 Feeder Willington/Steppingley MAHP.  The Project Site lies outside of 
consultation zones for hazardous installations and does not impinge on the 
separation distances of any explosives licensed site. 
Hazardous Substances 
6.2.75 
Paragraph 4.12.1 of NPS EN-1 explains that all establishments wishing to 
hold stock of hazardous substances above a threshold will require Hazardous 
Substances consent, and thus should consult the HSE at the pre-application 
stage.  
6.2.76 
In accordance with paragraph 4.12.1 of NPS EN-1, MPL consulted the HSE 
during statutory Section 42 consultation in October/November 2014 and 
again in May-July 2017, as set bout in the Consultation Report (Document 
Reference 5.1).  As set out in Chapter 3 of the ES (Document Reference 6.1), 
embedded mitigation measures include spill response procedures and 
correct handling of any hazardous substances; however as set out in Chapter 
10 of the ES (Document Reference 6.1), it is not anticipated that the operation 
of the Project will require the use of any potentially hazardous substances.  
As set out in the Chapter 15 of the ES (Document Reference 6.1), only small 
quantities of potentially hazardous waste will be stored on the Project Site at 
any time, comprising e.g. lubricating oils for continued maintenance of the 
Generating Equipment and any such substances will be held in secured 
containers to prevent contaminant migration. Closed storage facilities or 
suitable dampening techniques will be utilised within the Project where 
emissions of dust etc. from waste are possible.  Accordingly, it is not 
anticipated that Hazardous Substances Consent will be required; however, 
an application would be made at the appropriate time if required. 
Health 
6.2.77 
Paragraphs 4.13.1 and 4.13.3 of NPS EN-1 advise that energy production 
has the potential to impact on health and wellbeing, through increased traffic, 
air or water pollution, dust, odour, hazardous waste and substances, noise, 
exposure to radiation and increases in pests. Where the Project does have 
an effect on human beings, paragraph 4.13.2 of NPS EN-1 requires that the 
ES (Document Reference 6.1) assesses these effects for each element of 
the project, and identifies measures to avoid, reduce or compensate for these 
impacts. 
6.2.78 
As set out in Chapter 15 of the ES (Document Reference 6.1), it is considered 
that the potential for likely significant effects of the Project on human health 
relate primarily to exposure to excessive levels of noise, pollutants released 
during construction or operation of the Project (to the air, water or land) as 
well as effects relating to EMFs. As such, in accordance with paragraph 
100 
 
4.13.2 of NPS EN-1, an assessment of the impacts of the Project in this 
respect has been undertaken as part of the EIA and appropriate measures 
have been set out to address these impacts as appropriate. 
6.2.79 
As set out in Chapter 15 of the ES (Document Reference 6.1), noise at the 
Project Site during construction and decommissioning could arise from e.g. 
excavation for foundations, delivery of plant, and excavation for laying the 
Gas Connection; however this will only be a temporary source of noise. The 
significance of the overall effect of construction and decommissioning noise 
is predicted to be neutral following the implementation of embedded 
mitigation measures, including: an appropriately placed acoustic screen, 
implementation of a CEMP, and use of appropriately maintained plant and 
equipment during construction and decommissioning.  During operation, as 
set out in Chapter 15 of the ES (Document Reference 6.1), noise could occur 
from the rotating components of the Generating Equipment and there may 
be limited noise from the Access Road, although the likely impact of this on 
human health will not be significant when compared to the existing traffic 
noise. There will also be small amounts of noise generated by the AGI, 
however this noise is rarely perceptible except when in very close proximity 
to the AGI. 
6.2.80 
The main potential effects on human health resulting from construction and 
decommissioning of the Project on air quality, as set out in Chapter 15 of the 
ES (Document Reference 6.1) are from dust generated from construction 
activities; however, it is considered unlikely that levels of atmospheric dust 
would be generated which would constitute a health hazard or nuisance to 
local people, in the vicinity of the Project Site.  Potential air quality impacts 
would be minimised through implementation of a CEMP, which would 
incorporate appropriate dust mitigation measures such as damping down or 
covering of stock piles and excavations during dry and windy weather (see 
Chapter 15 of the ES (Document Reference 6.1). 
6.2.81 
As set out in Chapter 15 of the ES (Document Reference 6.1), with regards 
to the impacts of pollution and contamination on human health during 
construction and decommissioning, the main potential impacts are from the 
disturbance of any existing contamination and the creation of pollution 
incidents (e.g. spillages).  However, mitigation measures such as working 
within best practice guidelines and adhering to a detailed CEMP will be 
employed to prevent any contamination or pollution incidents impacting on 
ground conditions. This will include having an appropriate spill response plan, 
correct re-fuelling of vehicles and plant on hardstanding and the correct 
storage of potentially hazardous substances in bunded storage tanks.  
Further, as set out in Chapter 15 of the ES (Document Reference 6.1), during 
operation of the Project, there is the potential for the contamination of surface 
water within the Project Site, however such impacts would be controlled by 
embedded mitigation measures implicit within the Project comprising best 
practice measures required to ensure legislative compliance, contained 
within an operational environmental management plan secured through the 
EP.   
101 
 
6.2.82 
A full EMF report has been prepared for the Project and is included as 
Appendix 15.1 to the ES (Document Reference 6.1) to consider the potential 
impacts of EMF generated from high voltage electrical equipment.  The EMF 
report (Appendix 15.1 of the ES (Document Reference 6.1)) concludes that 
it is likely that that the EMF field strength for the Project would be minimal 
given that the Electrical Connection (either option 1 or option 2) would be an 
underground cable. Any above ground elements would have a similar EMF 
field strength to that which is already present associated with the existing 400 
kV Sundon to Grendon overhead line. 
Common law nuisance and statutory nuisance 
6.2.83 
Section 4.14 of NPS EN-1 provides guidance in respect of common law 
nuisance and statutory nuisance.  Paragraph 4.14.2 of NPS EN-1 stresses 
the importance of considering possible sources of nuisance and how they 
may be mitigated or limited at the pre-application stage under section 79(1) 
of the Environmental Protection Act 1990. 
6.2.84 
In accordance with paragraph 4.14.2 of NPS EN-1, possible sources of 
nuisance have been considered, with mitigation identified where relevant, in 
the Statement of Engagement of Section 79(1) of the Environmental 
Protection Act 1990 (Document Reference 5.5).  The Statement of 
Engagement of Section 79(1) of the Environmental Protection Act 1990 
(Document Reference 5.5) explains the condition of the site, and findings as 
to potential air quality impacts, noise levels, artificial lighting and health 
effects generated by the Project during both construction and operation, and 
concludes that with the identified mitigation in place the building and 
operation of the Project is unlikely to give rise to nuisance. 
Security considerations 
6.2.85 
Paragraph 4.15.2 of NPS EN-1 outlines that ‘Government policy is to ensure 
that, where possible, proportionate protective security measures are 
designed into new infrastructure projects at an early stage in the project 
development.’  
6.2.86 
In accordance with paragraph 4.15.2 of NPS EN-1, MPL has considered 
appropriate security measures from the early stages of the Project.  As set 
out within Chapter 3 of the ES (Document Reference 6.1) and detailed within 
the Design and Access Statement (Document Reference 10.2), a Gatehouse 
would be developed at the Generating Equipment Site to provide security 
and maintain a log of site attendance and deliveries.  It is also proposed that 
lighting columns will be erected around the perimeter of the Generating 
Equipment in order to provide security lighting and lighting for safe working 
in dark conditions. The lighting columns will be approximately 8m in height 
and regularly spaced around the perimeter of the Generating Equipment Site.   
6.2.87 
During construction of the electrical connection, a temporary security fence 
with locked gates for main and emergency exits would be installed around 
the SECs and Substation.  A security cabin would be established to provide 
accommodation for full time security personnel for the duration of the works.  
102 
 
The above security measures would be implanted as part of the CEMP.  As 
detailed within the Consultation Report (Document Reference 5.1), no 
statutory Section 42 consultation responses were received raising relevant 
security concerns. 
Generic Impacts 
6.2.88 
Part 5 of NPS EN-1 explains the potential impacts of energy infrastructure, in 
terms of: air quality and emissions; biodiversity and ecological conservation; 
civil and military aviation and defence interests; coastal change; dust, odour, 
artificial light, smoke, steam and insect infestation; flood risk; historic 
environment; landscape and visual; land use including open space, green 
infrastructure and Green Belt; noise and vibration; socio-economic; traffic 
and transport; waste management; and water quality and resources. 
Air quality and emissions 
6.2.89 
Paragraph 5.2.1 of NPS EN-1 advises that the construction, operation and 
decommissioning of infrastructure development ‘can involve emissions to air 
which could lead to adverse impacts on health, on protected species and 
habitats, or on the wider countryside.’  Paragraph 5.2.7 of NPS EN-1 provides 
that the applicant should undertake an assessment as part of the ES, 
describing:  
 “any significant air emissions, their mitigation and any residual effects 
distinguishing between the project stages and taking account of any 
significant emissions from any road traffic generated by the project; 
 the predicted absolute emission levels of the proposed project, after 
mitigation methods have been applied; 
 existing air quality levels and the relative change in air quality from 
existing levels; and 
 any potential eutrophication impacts.” 
6.2.90 
In accordance with paragraphs 5.2.1 and 5.2.7 of NPS EN-1, an assessment 
of the likely impacts, in respect of air quality and emissions, has been 
undertaken in the EIA and findings, including appropriate mitigation 
measures where relevant, are presented in Chapter 6 of the ES (Document 
Number 6.1).  The assessment included consideration of the closest 
residential dwelling to the Power Generation Plant Site at South Pillinge 
Farm, located approximately 130 m to the west of the Project Site. 
6.2.91 
The main potential effects resulting from construction and decommissioning 
of the Project on air quality are from dust and particulate matter generated 
from construction activities, as detailed within Chapter 6 of the ES (Document 
Reference 6.1).  Despite this, it is considered unlikely that levels of dust or 
particulate matter would be generated which would constitute a health hazard 
or nuisance to human or ecological receptors in the vicinity of the Project Site.  
Impacts would be minimised through implementation of a CEMP, (an outline 
103 
 
of which is provided in Appendix 3.2 of the ES (Document Reference 6.2)) 
which would incorporate appropriate dust mitigation measures such as 
damping down or covering of stock piles and excavations during dry and 
windy weather. 
6.2.92 
The main potential effects arising from operation of the Project in respect of 
air quality are associated with the stack emissions arising as a result of the 
combustion of natural gas in the Generating Equipment (see Chapter 6 of the 
ES (Document Reference 6.1).  However, modern gas fired power plant are 
inherently clean and produce far fewer emissions than other fossil fuel power 
plants (e.g. coal) when compared on an energy output basis. Emissions of 
NOx are strictly limited under national and international guidelines such as 
the Industrial Emissions Directive (IED). Operation of the Generating 
Equipment will also be regulated by the Environment Agency under an 
Environmental Permit, which will limit emissions in line with national 
guidelines (as referenced at section 2.6 of this Planning Statement, and in 
the Details of Other Consents and Licences document (Document Reference 
5.6). It is concluded that there will be no likely significant effects during 
operation of the Generating Equipment on human or ecological receptors 
(see Chapter 6 of the ES (Document Reference 6.1)).  
6.2.93 
As explained in Chapter 6 of the ES (Document Reference 6.1), the 
construction, decommissioning and operation of the Project could occur 
simultaneously with other projects in the vicinity of the Project Site; however, 
most of the proposed developments are greater than 5km from the Project 
Site and outside of the study area for this topic within which potentially 
significant effects could occur. As such it is considered that no cumulative 
effects are likely to arise in relation to these projects in respect of air quality. 
It is considered, in Chapter 6 of the ES (Document Reference 6.1) that, based 
on professional judgement, with the implementation of the embedded 
mitigation described in the ES (Document Reference 6.1) along with the 
embedded mitigation in the Rookery South RRF Project, no likely significant 
cumulative effects will arise as between the Project and the Rookery South 
RRF Project. 
6.2.94 
With regard to biodiversity and geological conservation, paragraph 5.3.3 of 
NPS EN-1 advises that the Applicant should ensure that the ES ‘clearly sets 
out any effects on internationally, nationally and locally designated sites of 
ecological or geological conservation importance, on protected species and 
on habitats and other species identified as being of principal importance for 
the conservation of biodiversity.’   
Biodiversity and geological conservation 
6.2.95 
In accordance with paragraph 5.3.3 of NPS EN-1, an assessment of the likely 
effects on internationally, nationally and locally designated sites of ecological 
or geological conservation importance, on protected species, and on habitats 
and other species of principal importance has been undertaken in the EIA, 
and the findings are presented in Chapters 8 (Biodiversity) and 10 (Geology 
and Ground Conditions) of the ES (Document Reference 6.1). 
104 
 
6.2.96 
In respect of biodiversity, as explained in Chapter 8 of the ES (Document 
Reference 6.1), the potential effects on ecological receptors during the 
construction and decommissioning phases are likely to be from indirect noise, 
vibration and lighting, as well as direct disturbance of habitats or indirect 
impacts from pollution (e.g. silt entering watercourses). The impacts could 
lead to effects on habitats and species within and adjacent to the Project Site. 
However, work is and has been carried out (as part of the LLRS scheme) to 
translocate certain ecological species, (for example, Great Crested Newts, 
the translocation of which is now understood to have been completed) from 
the Project Site so that by the time the Project starts construction, the Power 
Generation Plant Site will be of negligible ecological value. Furthermore, the 
areas where the Gas and Electrical Connection would be located have been 
found to be of limited ecological value due to intensive agricultural practices 
on the land.   
6.2.97 
Further, as set out in Chapter 8 of the ES (Document Reference 6.1), during 
operation, the main potential effects on ecological receptors are likely to 
result from stack emissions impacting on sensitive ecological sites. An 
increase in nitrogen deposition above the critical load can cause a change in 
plant communities. An increase in acid deposition above the critical load can 
cause a decrease in soil base saturation and may cause toxicity to plants.  
However, air quality modelling (see section 3.3 and Chapter 6 of the ES 
(Document Reference 6.1)) has shown that setting the stack height at 
between 32.5 and 35 m will not result in any impacts to sensitive ecological 
sites. Therefore, no likely significant effects are predicted from operation of 
the Project on ecological receptors on the basis that the stack height will be 
32.5-35m in height.  
6.2.98 
As explained in Chapter 8 of the ES (Document Reference 6.1), the 
construction, decommissioning and operation of the Project could occur 
simultaneously with other projects in the vicinity of the Project Site; however, 
most of the proposed developments are greater than 5km from the Project 
Site and outside of the study area for this topic within which potentially 
significant effects could occur. The only projects which are considered 
relevant to the cumulative effects assessment for ecology are the proposed 
Integrated Waste Management Facilities proposed at Rookery South Pit and 
the Rookery South RRF Project at Rookery South Pit. The proposed 
Integrated Waste Management Facilities development is at an early stage 
and should it go ahead, it will have to consider the Project to ensure that no 
significant cumulative impacts will arise between it and the Project. The ES 
for the Rookery South RRF Project concluded that there were no likely 
significant effects arising from construction, operation or decommissioning of 
the project on ecology. It is considered, as set out in Chapter 8 of the ES 
(Document Reference 6.1) that, based on professional judgement, with the 
implementation of mitigation described in the ES (Document Reference 6.1) 
along with mitigation in the Rookery South RRF Project, no likely significant 
cumulative effects will arise as between the Project, the Rookery South RRF 
Project and other developments. 
6.2.99 
In respect of geology and ground conditions, in accordance with paragraph 
5.3.3 of NPS EN-1, Chapter 10 of the ES (Document Reference 6.1) states 
105 
 
that, during construction of the Power Generation Plant, the main potential 
impacts on ground conditions will be from: disturbance of any existing 
contamination and the creation of pollution pathways; unstable slopes 
associated with deep excavations or cuttings; uplift from high groundwater 
levels; and creation of pollution incidents from e.g. spillages.  
6.2.100 As set out in Chapter 10 of the ES (Document Reference 6.1), the 
construction, decommissioning and operation of the Project could occur 
simultaneously with other projects in the vicinity of the Project Site; however, 
most of the proposed developments are greater than 5km from the Project 
Site and outside of the study area for this topic within which potentially 
significant effects could occur.  
6.2.101 The only projects which are considered relevant to the cumulative effects 
assessment for ground conditions are the proposed Integrated Waste 
Management Facilities proposed at Rookery South Pit and the Rookery 
South RRF Project at Rookery South Pit. The proposed Integrated Waste 
Management Facilities development is at an early stage and should it go 
ahead, it will have to consider the Project to ensure that no significant 
cumulative impacts will arise between it and the Project. The ES for the 
Rookery South RRF Project concluded that there were no likely significant 
effects arising from construction, operation or decommissioning of the project 
on ground conditions. It is considered, as set out in Chapter 10 of the ES 
(Document Reference 6.1) that, based on professional judgement, with the 
implementation of mitigation described in the ES (Document Reference 6.1) 
along with mitigation in the Rookery South RRF Project, no likely significant 
cumulative effects will arise as between the Project, the Rookery South RRF 
Project and other developments. 
6.2.102 Paragraph 5.3.18 of NPS EN-1 states that appropriate mitigation measures 
in respect of biodiversity and geodiversity should be an integral part of the 
proposed development and should demonstrate that: activities are confined 
to the minimum areas required during construction; best practice is followed 
during construction and operation; habitats are restored after construction 
works where practicable; and opportunities are taken to enhance or create 
new habitats. 
6.2.103 In respect of biodiversity, in accordance with paragraph 5.3.18 of NPS EN-1, 
mitigation measures would be put in place to further limit potential impacts to 
ecology, including the careful timing of vegetation removal and maintaining 
an appropriate buffer around sensitive ecological sites during construction 
works. Compensatory planting and ponds would also be created as part of 
the landscaping mitigation strategy for the Project (see Appendix 11.3 of the 
ES (Document Reference 6.2)).  Therefore, as set out in Chapter 8 of the ES 
(Document Reference 6.1), no likely significant effects are predicted as a 
result of construction or decommissioning of the Project in respect of 
biodiversity. 
6.2.104 In respect of geology and ground conditions, in accordance with paragraph 
5.3.18 of NPS EN-1, mitigation measures such as working within best 
practice guidelines and adhering to a detailed CEMP will be employed to 
106 
 
prevent any contamination or pollution incidents impacting on ground 
conditions. This will include having an appropriate spill response plan, correct 
re-fuelling of vehicles and plant on hardstanding and the correct storage of 
potentially hazardous substances in bunded storage tanks, thus there will be 
no significant effects.  Furthermore given the historical extraction of clay 
undertaken in the Power Generation Plant Site there is no important geology 
(e.g. designated geological sites or minerals) or soils (e.g. fertile agricultural 
land) underlying the Power Generation Plant Site which could be affected or 
lost during construction. 
Civil and military aviation and defence interests 
6.2.105 Paragraph 5.4.1 of NPS EN-1 advises that civil and military aviation and 
defence interests can be affected by new energy development, and as such 
paragraph 5.4.10 of NPS EN-1 states that an assessment of potential effects 
should be set out within the ES.  Paragraph 5.4.11 of NPS EN-1 states that, 
in addition, the MoD, CAA, NATS and any aerodrome likely to be affected by 
the proposed development should be consulted. 
6.2.106 In accordance with paragraph 5.4.11 of NPS EN-1, the MoD, CAA and NATS 
were all consulted during statutory section 42 consultation, as detailed in the 
Consultation Report (Document Reference 5.1).  The MoD, NATS and the 
CAA raised no objection to the proposed development (see Consultation 
Report (Document Reference 5.1)). 
Dust, odour, artificial light, smoke, steam and insect infestation 
6.2.107 Paragraph 5.6.1 of NPS EN-1 states that, ‘during the construction, operation 
and decommissioning of energy infrastructure there is potential for the 
release of a range of emissions such as odour, dust, steam, smoke, artificial 
light and infestation of insects.’  As such, paragraph 5.6.5 of NPS EN-1 states 
that applicants are required to assess the potential for emissions and the 
impact on amenity, in particular in terms of the type, quantity and timing of 
emissions; aspects giving rise to emissions; locations affected by the 
emissions; effects of the emissions on identified locations; and measures to 
be employed in preventing or mitigating emissions.   
6.2.108 In accordance with paragraph 5.6.1 of NPS EN-1, a full assessment has been 
undertaken of the potential emissions resulting from the construction, 
operation and decommissioning of the Power Generation Plant, electrical 
connection and gas connection and is recorded in Chapter 6 of the ES 
(Document Reference 6.1), together with appropriate mitigation measures.  
A Statement of Engagement of Section 79(1) of the Environmental Protection 
Act 1990 (Document Reference 5.5) has also been prepared – fulfilling 
regulation 5(2)(f) of the AFFP Regulations – to assess the condition of the 
site, potential air quality impacts, noise levels, artificial lighting and health 
effects generated by the Project throughout its various stages. 
6.2.109 Chapter 6 of the ES (Document Reference 6.1) states that the main potential 
effects resulting from construction and decommissioning of the Project on air 
quality are from dust and particulate matter generated from construction 
107 
 
activities; however it is considered unlikely that levels of dust or particulate 
matter would be generated which would constitute a health hazard or 
nuisance to human or ecological receptors in the vicinity of the Project Site. 
6.2.110 Paragraph 5.6.11 of NPS EN-1 advises that mitigation measures relating to 
emissions may be provided in respect of engineering, lay-out or 
administration.   
6.2.111 Chapter 6 of the ES (Document Reference 6.1) states that any potential 
impacts would be minimised through implementation of a CEMP, (an outline 
of which is provided in Appendix 3.2 of the ES (Document Reference 6.2)) 
which would incorporate appropriate dust mitigation measures such as 
damping down or covering of stock piles and excavations during dry and 
windy weather.   
Flood risk 
6.2.112 Paragraph 5.7.4 of NPS EN-1 states that application for energy projects of 
1ha or greater in Flood Zone 1 and all energy projects in Flood Zones 2 and 
3 should be accompanied by a FRA.   
6.2.113 The Project Site is greater than 1ha and therefore an FRA (Document 
Reference 5.4) has been undertaken and is submitted as part of the DCO 
Application. 
6.2.114 Where necessary, paragraph 5.7.18 of NPS EN-1 advises that flood risk 
should be mitigated by making arrangements to manage surface water and 
the impact of the natural water cycle on people and property.  
6.2.115 In respect of paragraph 5.7.18 of NPS EN-1, the FRA (Document Reference 
5.4) has found that there are not likely to be any significant impacts resulting 
from the construction, operation and decommissioning of the Power 
Generation Plant, electrical connection and gas connection with regards to 
flooding.   
Historic environment 
6.2.116 Paragraph 5.8.1 of NPS EN-1 advises that the construction, operation and 
decommissioning of energy infrastructure has the potential to result in 
adverse impacts on the historic environment.  Accordingly, paragraph 5.8.8 
of NPS EN-1 states that the applicant is required to ‘provide a description of 
the significance of the heritage assets affected by the proposed development 
and the contribution of their setting to that significance’. 
6.2.117 In accordance with paragraph 5.8.1 of NPS EN-1, a full assessment has been 
undertaken in the EIA of the potential impacts of the Project on the historic 
environment, and the findings are presented in Chapter 13 of the ES 
(Document Reference 6.1). 
6.2.118 Chapter 13 of the ES (Document Reference 6.1) sets out that, given that the 
Power Generation Plant Site is within formerly developed land which is 
subject to ongoing construction works as part of the LLRS, it is likely that any 
108 
 
archaeology would have already been removed. Therefore, this preliminary 
assessment has concluded that there will be no physical direct impacts on 
any heritage assets. The majority of the construction works will not be visible 
outside of Rookery South Pit and therefore will have no impacts on the setting 
of any heritage assets.  The Access Road will have no potential impacts on 
designated heritage assets.  
6.2.119 Further, Chapter 13 of the ES (Document Reference 6.1) states that during 
operation, the introduction of the stack associated with the Generating 
Equipment have the potential to have minor adverse effects on surrounding 
cultural heritage assets such as listed buildings. There is also the potential 
for inter-visibility between the stack of the Generating Equipment, the SECs 
associated with the Electrical Connection and the AGI of the Gas Connection 
and up to five Scheduled Monuments. However, in all cases effects are 
anticipated to be no more than minor and are not significant. 
6.2.120 Chapter 13 of the ES (Document Reference 6.1) notes that the construction, 
decommissioning and operation of the Project could occur simultaneously 
with other projects in the vicinity of the Project Site; however, most of the 
proposed developments are greater than 5km from the Project Site and 
outside of the study area for this topic within which potentially significant 
effects could occur.  
6.2.121 The only projects which are considered relevant to the cumulative effects 
assessment for archaeology and cultural heritage are the proposed 
Integrated Waste Management Facilities proposed at Rookery South Pit and 
the Rookery South RRF Project at Rookery South Pit. The proposed 
Integrated Waste Management Facilities development is at an early stage 
and should it go ahead, it will have to consider the Project to ensure that no 
significant cumulative impacts will arise between it and the Project. The ES 
for the Rookery South RRF Project concluded that there were no likely 
significant effects arising from construction, operation or decommissioning of 
the project on archaeology and cultural heritage. It is considered, as part of 
Chapter 13 of the ES (Document Reference 6.1) that, based on professional 
judgement, with the implementation of mitigation described in the ES 
(Document Reference 6.1) along with mitigation in the Rookery South RRF 
Project, no likely significant cumulative effects will arise as between the 
Project, the Rookery South RRF Project and other developments. 
Landscape and visual 
6.2.122 Paragraph 5.9.1 of NPS EN-1 acknowledges that the landscape and visual 
effects of energy projects will vary according to the type of development, its 
location and the landscape setting.  Paragraphs 5.9.5 – 5.9.7 of NPS EN-1 
also advise that the applicant should carry out a landscape and visual impact 
assessment of the effects during construction and operation, including light 
pollution effects on local amenity and nature conservation.  
6.2.123 In accordance with the provisions of paragraphs 5.9.5 – 5.9.7 of NPS EN-1, 
an assessment of the likely landscape and visual impacts of the Project has 
109 
 
been undertaken and the findings are presented in Chapter 11 of the ES 
(Document Reference 6.1). 
6.2.124 Chapter 11 of the ES (Document Reference 6.1) states that the main 
potential sources of landscape and visual impact during construction of the 
Project are: earthworks, site clearance works, removal of vegetation (in the 
case of the Gas Connection and Electrical Connection), presence of 
construction traffic, construction of the Electrical Connection temporary 
diversion and presence of construction site lighting. During operation, effects 
on landscape and visual amenity will result from the introduction of 
permanent structures, particularly the stack of the Generating Equipment 
which will be the largest structure on the Project Site 
6.2.125 Paragraph 5.9.21 of NPS EN-1 notes that reducing the scale of the project 
can help to mitigate the landscape and visual impacts, however it is 
acknowledged that amending the design of proposed energy infrastructure 
may result in a significant operational constraint and reduction in function.  
6.2.126 In respect of paragraph 5.9.21 of NPS EN-1, the design of the proposed 
energy infrastructure has not significantly altered due to operational and 
functional requirements.  However, it is noted in Chapter 11 of the ES 
(Document Reference 6.1) that, given the limited construction period (22 
months) and the relatively modest construction operations, the construction 
effects are considered to be not significant from the majority of locations.  
Furthermore, during operation the Project will be largely screened from views 
by the fact that a large proportion is sited within the Rookery South Pit 
(meaning that only 17.5-20 m of the stack will be visible above the edge of 
the pit). The Project will also be viewed in the context of other industrial 
development such as large towers of the former London Brick Works, the 
existing Sundon to Grendon overhead line and towers and the wind turbine 
at the Millennium Country Park.  Views of the stack of the Generating 
Equipment will be clearly visible in some views from the south and south east, 
particularly along the Greensands Ridge and from footpath 14 (see Chapter 
11 of the ES (Document Reference 6.1)). 
Land use including open space, green infrastructure and Green Belt 
6.2.127 Paragraph 5.10.1 of NPS EN-1 acknowledges that an energy infrastructure 
project ‘will have direct effects on the existing use of the proposed site and 
may have indirect effects on the use, or planned use, of land in the vicinity 
for other types of development.’  Accordingly, the applicants should consult 
the local community (paragraph 5.10.6) and the ES should include an 
assessment of the impact of the proposed development on existing and 
proposed land uses near the project. Paragraph 5.10.19 notes that there may 
be little that can be done to mitigate the direct effects of the energy project 
on the existing use of the proposed site; however, the effects may be 
minimised through the application of good design principles, including the 
layout of the project.  
6.2.128 In respect of paragraph 5.10.1 of NPS EN-1 and in accordance with 
paragraph 5.10.6 of NPS EN-1, MPL has undertaken extensive pre-
110 
 
application consultation over two phases with statutory consultees, key 
stakeholders (including CBC, BBC, local councillors and local MPs) and the 
local community via a structured consultation programme, as recorded within 
the Consultation Report (Document Reference 5.1).  Further, in accordance 
with paragraph 5.10.6 of NPS EN-1, an assessment of the potential impact 
of the Project on existing and proposed land uses around the Project Site has 
been undertaken as part of the cumulative assessment within each technical 
section of the EIA (air quality; noise and vibration; ecology; water quality and 
resources; geology, ground conditions and hydrogeology; landscape and 
visual impacts; traffic, transport and access; archaeology and cultural 
heritage; and socio-economics), following consultation with CCS, and is 
recorded within the ES (Document Reference 6.1).  
6.2.129 In respect of the existing use of the site: the Project Site is partially located 
within The Rookery, which comprises two former clay pits (Rookery North 
and Rookery South) separated by an east-west spine of unexcavated clay 
covering an area of some 210 ha.  The Rookery is the subject of an ongoing 
LLRS being undertaken by the landowner pursuant to a separate planning 
consent (application ref.  BC/CM/2000/8) in order to restore the former clay 
workings (i.e. below pre-excavation ground levels) to low-intensity 
agricultural land, with measures included in the restoration to enhance 
biodiversity and landscape. This restoration work is taking place 
independently of the Project, and furthermore an option agreement has been 
put in place between MPL and the landowner of Rookery Pit such that 
relevant elements of the LLRS will be completed prior to the commencement 
of the development of the Project (anticipated to be in 2020).  Accordingly, 
the Project will not prejudice or have any direct adverse effects on the existing 
use of the Project Site for low-level restoration to low-intensity agricultural 
land. 
6.2.130 Paragraph 5.10.19 of NPS EN-1 notes that there may be little that can be 
done to mitigate the direct effects of the energy project on the existing use of 
the proposed site; however, the effects may be minimised through the 
application of good design principles, including the layout of the project. 
6.2.131 In accordance with the provisions of paragraph 5.10.19 of NPS EN-1, MPL 
has sought to adopt good design principles as part of the Project, including 
its layout.  As set out in the Design and Access Statement (Document 
Reference 10.2), the form, scale, massing and landscaping has been 
designed so that the Power Generation Plant blends in with its surroundings 
minimising visual intrusion from key viewpoints.  
6.2.132 In accordance with paragraph 5.10.6 of NPS EN-1, MPL has had regard to 
the proposed use of the Project Site.  As set out within section 3.4 of this 
Planning Statement, part of the Project Site is occupied by the Rookery South 
RRF Project, for which a DCO was formally issued on 25th March 2013 
(Appendix 4).  MPL confirms that the Project has taken account of the extant 
Consent for the Rookery South RRF Project.  The ES (Document Reference 
6.1) explains how the Rookery South RRF Project was considered for EIA 
purposes. 
111 
 
6.2.133 The Project Site and the Order limits for the Project Site (the Order limits are 
defined in the draft Development Consent Order (Document Reference 3.1) 
as being defined on the Works Plans (Document Reference 2.6)) sit within 
part of the order limits for the RRF Order. This means that there is the 
potential for overlap and inconsistent powers between the two DCOs. 
However, MPL have engaged with Covanta through the development of the 
Project and have suggested a number of ways in which the two schemes 
may potentially interact and put forward solutions to any overlap issues that 
can be delivered through the draft Order for the MPL Project (and the 
documents that accompany that Order). Therefore MPL is satisfied that the 
two projects would be capable of coexisting should both be constructed and 
operated and positive discussions between the two parties will continue. MPL 
has prepared a position statement providing further information on this matter 
which is provided in Appendix 5 of this Statement. 
6.2.134 Proposals for future development at the Project Site are also established 
within land-use allocations contained within local planning policy.  Section 6.3 
of this Planning Statement considers the Project in respect of the provisions 
of local planning policy which are considered to be both important and 
relevant. 
Noise and vibration 
6.2.135 Paragraph 5.11.1 of NPS EN-1 states that excessive noise can have wide-
ranging impacts on the quality of human life, health, and use and enjoyment 
of areas, as well as on wildlife and biodiversity (paragraph 5.11.2).  Where 
noise impacts arise, paragraph 5.11.4 of NPS EN-1 states that a noise 
assessment should be provided, to include: a description of the noise 
generating aspects of the proposal, identification of noise sensitive areas, the 
characteristics of the existing noise environment, and a prediction of how the 
noise environment will change.   
6.2.136 In accordance with paragraph 5.11.4 of NPS EN-1, an assessment of the 
likely noise and vibration impacts associated with the Project has been 
undertaken in the EIA and the findings are presented in Chapter 6 of the ES 
(Document Reference 6.1). A Statement of Engagement of Section 79(1) of 
the Environmental Protection Act 1990 (Document Reference 5.5) has also 
been prepared – fulfilling regulation 5(2)(f) of the AFFP Regulations – to 
assess the condition of the site, potential air quality impacts, noise levels, 
artificial lighting and health effects generated by the Project. 
6.2.137 Chapter 6 of the ES (Document Reference 6.1) states that the construction 
and decommissioning activity inevitably leads to some degree of noise 
disturbance at locations in close proximity to these activities. Noise at the 
Project Site during construction and decommissioning could arise from e.g. 
excavation for foundations, delivery of plant, and excavation of the trenches 
to lay the Gas Connection and Electrical Connection. This will however be a 
temporary source of noise. Based on a conservative, worst case assessment, 
where numerous large plant items are operating simultaneously across the 
Project Site, the significance of the overall effect of construction and 
decommissioning noise from the Project is predicted to be slight adverse and 
112 
 
therefore not significant following the implementation of embedded 
mitigation.  Further, Chapter 6 of the ES (Document Reference 6.1) states 
that, during operation, noise could occur from the rotating components of the 
Generating Equipment and there may be limited noise from the Access Road, 
although the likely impact of this on human health will not be significant when 
compared to the existing traffic noise.  There will also be small amounts of 
noise generated by the AGI, however this noise is rarely perceptible except 
when in very close proximity to the AGI. 
6.2.138 Paragraph 5.11.12 of NPS EN-1 states that mitigation measures relating to 
noise and vibration may include engineering, layout design, or administrative 
measures (paragraph 5.11.12).  
6.2.139 In respect of paragraph 5.11.12 of NPS EN-1, embedded mitigation 
measures in respect of noise and vibration, as set out in Chapter 3 of the ES 
(Document Reference 6.1) include: an appropriately placed acoustic screen, 
implementation of a CEMP, and inherent best practice design incorporating 
acoustic enclosures. 
Socio-economic 
6.2.140 Paragraph 5.12.1 of NPS EN-1 states that ‘[t]he construction, operation and 
decommissioning of energy infrastructure may have socio-economic impacts 
at local and regional levels’, and therefore an assessment should be 
undertaken of all relevant socio-economic impacts, which may include: the 
creation of jobs and training opportunities, the provision of additional local 
services and improvements to local infrastructure, effects on tourism, the 
impact of a changing influx of workers during different phases of the project, 
and cumulative effects.   
6.2.141 In accordance with the paragraph 5.12.1 of NPS EN-1, a socio-economic 
assessment has been undertaken as part of the EIA and is set out within 
Chapter 14 of the ES (Document Reference 6.1).  The socio-economic 
assessment identifies the likely significance of effects on the local, regional 
and national economy from the construction, operation and decommissioning 
of the Power Generation Plant, Gas Connection and Electrical Connection.  
The assessment shows that the project will deliver positive socio-economic 
impacts through: employment creation; supply chain linkages for goods and 
services; and workers spending in the local economy, when assessed for the 
Project as a whole (see Chapter 14 of the ES (Document Reference 6.1)).  
6.2.142 Paragraph 5.12.9 of NPS EN-1 states that mitigation measures relating to 
socio-economic measures could include improvements to the visual and 
environmental experience for visitors and the local community through high 
quality design.  
6.2.143 Chapter 14 of the ES (Document Reference 6.1) states that there are not 
anticipated to be any significant impacts on tourism and community 
infrastructure as a result of the Project.  However, as set out in the Design 
and Access Statement (Document Reference 10.2), MPL has sought to adopt 
good design principles as part of the Project.   
113 
 
Traffic and transport 
6.2.144 Paragraph 5.13.1 of NPS EN-1 notes that ‘The transport of materials, goods 
and personnel to and from a development during all project phases can have 
a variety of impacts on the surrounding transport infrastructure and potentially 
on connecting transport networks.’  Paragraph 5.13.3 of NPS EN-1 states 
that the applicant should therefore undertake a transport assessment and 
consult with the Highways Agency (Highways England) and Highways 
Authority regarding appropriate mitigation.   
6.2.145 In accordance with paragraph 5.13.1 and paragraph 5.13.3 of NPS EN-1, an 
assessment of the likely significant transport-related effects arising from the 
construction, operation and decommissioning of the Project has been 
undertaken and is recorded within Chapter 12 of the ES (Document 
Reference 6.1).  MPL has consulted the Highways Agency and Highways 
Authority as part of statutory consultation on the Project, as set out in the 
Consultation Report (Document Reference 5.1). 
6.2.146 Chapter 12 of the ES (Document Reference 6.1) states that the effects of the 
Project on traffic and transport during construction are predicted to be neutral 
and therefore there are no likely significant effects, taking into account 
mitigation measures, the temporary nature of the construction phase, and the 
relatively few numbers of abnormal loads anticipated.  Operational phase 
movements of the Project are below a level at which changes will be 
perceived and therefore normal operation of the Project is not anticipated to 
have any likely significant effects on the local road network. 
6.2.147 The embedded mitigation measures, as proposed in Chapter 3 of the ES 
(Document Reference 6.1), state that a Construction Access Strategy will be 
developed to manage the construction phase movements. This will consist 
of a series of measures including: 
 An Outline CEMP to reduce the transport impacts of the construction 
traffic servicing the Site, and the movements associated with 
construction waste;  
 a Route Management Plan to direct HGVs away from the sensitive 
local transport network; 
 a traffic management scheme at the Green Lane / Proposed Site 
Access to control queuing and to ensure no blocking of the railway 
develops; 
 the Construction Vehicle Parking Strategy to control the vehicle 
generation and minimise impact on the surrounding area;  
 a footpath management plan to ensure any footpath route affected by 
the works are protected, and that the pedestrians may use them 
safely; and 
114 
 
 an Abnormal Load Delivery strategy to manage the delivery to site of 
the major items of plant and apparatus that are indivisible.  
6.2.148 During the operation phase, as set out in Chapter 14 of the ES (Document 
Reference 6.1), mitigation comprises a Travel Plan that has been created 
specifically targeting employees to decrease the number of vehicles 
accessing the Project. This is contained in Appendix 12.2 of the ES 
(Document Reference 6.1). A range of non-car Initiatives will be implemented 
to encourage the use of alternative modes of travel to the private car. 
6.2.149 As explained in Chapter 14 of the ES (Document Reference 6.1), the 
construction, decommissioning and operation of the Project could occur 
simultaneously with other projects in the vicinity of the Project Site; however, 
most of the proposed developments are greater than 5km from the Project 
Site and outside of the study area for this topic within which potentially 
significant effects could occur. The only projects which are considered 
relevant to the cumulative effects assessment for traffic and transport are the 
proposed Integrated Waste Management Facilities proposed at Rookery 
South Pit and the Rookery South RRF Project at Rookery South Pit. The 
proposed Integrated Waste Management Facilities development is at an 
early stage and should it go ahead, it will have to consider the Project to 
ensure that no significant cumulative impacts will arise between it and the 
Project. The ES for the Rookery South RRF Project concluded that there 
were no likely significant effects arising from construction, operation or 
decommissioning of the project on traffic and transport. It is considered, as 
set out in Chapter 14 of the ES (Document Reference 6.1) that, based on 
professional judgement, with the implementation of mitigation described in 
the ES (Document Reference 6.1) along with mitigation in the Rookery South 
RRF Project, no likely significant effects will occur. 
Waste management 
6.2.150 Paragraph 5.14.1 of NPS EN-1 outlines that government policy on hazardous 
and non-hazardous waste is intended to ‘protect human health and the 
environment by producing less waste and by using it as a resource wherever 
possible.’  Paragraph 5.14.6 of NPS EN-1 states that the applicant should set 
out the arrangements proposed for managing waste and include information 
on the proposed waste recovery and disposal system.  
6.2.151 In accordance with paragraphs 5.14.1 and 5.14.6 of NPS EN-1, and as set 
out in Chapter 15 of the ES (Document Reference 6.1), MPL will produce a 
CEMP and seek to apply the waste hierarchy – consisting of (in order of 
preference): prevention; re-use; recycling; other recovery (e.g. energy 
recovery); and disposal – during all phases of the Project as part of their 
waste prevention and management policy.  Measures will include, amongst 
others, the stockpiling of excavated spoil and testing for Waste Acceptance 
Criteria, to determine whether it can be re-used on- or off-site, and the testing 
and removal, as appropriate, of any water from de-watering activities which 
will be handled by a suitably licensed waste contractor (see Chapter 15 of 
the ES (Document Reference 6.1). 
115 
 
6.2.152 Further, as set out in Chapter 15 of the ES (Document Reference 6.1), the 
CEMP will ensure that all construction waste will be dealt with in a manner 
that complies with relevant legislation and (upon leaving the Project Site) 
waste will be treated and disposed of by suitably licensed contractors. Where 
hazardous waste is transported from the Project Site, it will be handled in 
accordance with relevant regulations, and, where necessary, be transported 
in sealed tankers. 
6.2.153 During operation a feature of the Gas Turbine Generator technology to be 
incorporated in the Project is that waste generated should be minimal and 
will be restricted to the following (see Chapter 15 of the ES (Document 
Reference 6.1): 
 General office wastes; 
 Used air intake filters (typically replaced annually); 
 Used ion exchange resins or used membranes (typically replaced 
every 5 to 10 years); 
 Separated oil / sludge from oil / water separators; and 
 Used oil, chemicals or chemical containers. 
6.2.154 Based on the above, Chapter 15 of the ES (Document Reference 6.1) 
concludes that that the Project will result in no likely significant effects with 
respect to waste.  
Water quality and resources 
6.2.155 Paragraph 5.15.1 of NPS EN-1 advises that infrastructure development can 
have 
adverse 
effects 
during 
the 
construction, 
operation 
and 
decommissioning phases on the water environment, including groundwater, 
inland surface water, transitional waters and coastal waters.  Accordingly, 
paragraph 5.15.2 of NPS EN-1 states that the applicant should undertake an 
assessment of ‘the existing status of, and impacts of the proposed project on, 
water quality, water resources and physical characteristics of the water 
environment as part of the ES’.  
6.2.156 In accordance with paragraph 5.15.1 of NPS EN-1, an assessment of the 
likely effects on water quality and resources associated with the proposed 
development has been undertaken in the EIA and the findings are presented 
in Chapter 9 of the ES (Document Reference 6.1). 
6.2.157 As set out in Chapter 9 of the ES (Document Reference 6.1), the main 
potential impacts that may result from construction and decommissioning of 
the Project are contaminated material entering a surface water body or for 
the Generating Equipment Site to become inundated with flood water.  
However, there are not anticipated to be any effects on the water bodies 
identified as best practice working methods and mitigation will be employed. 
These mitigation measures include having appropriate spill response plans 
116 
 
in place, the refuelling of vehicles away from watercourses and the siting of 
stockpiles and materials away from watercourses and will all be contained 
within the CEMP. In order to minimise adverse effects best practice would be 
employed during construction of the Gas Connection to protect the water 
environment, in accordance with guidelines published by the Environment 
Agency and Internal Drainage Board. It is predicted that following the 
implementation of embedded mitigation and best practice construction 
methods referred to above, any effects on water quality and resources will be 
negligible (see Chapter 9 of the ES (Document Reference 6.1)). 
6.2.158 During operation, as set out in Chapter 9 of the ES (Document Reference 
6.1), the Power Generation Plant Site would be equipped with a surface water 
drainage system (which would tie into the drainage system developed as part 
of the LLRS and a sewerage system which would feed to a septic tank, with 
waste tankered off site. The surface water drainage system would remove 
any potentially polluted runoff through the use of oil interceptors and silt traps, 
prior to discharge into an attenuation pond created as part of the LLRS. The 
Project will lead to an increase in the amount of runoff from within the Power 
Generation Plant Site boundary due to the increase in hardstanding. 
However, part of the LLRS works to Rookery Pit mean that any excess 
surface water (e.g. from a large storm event) will be effectively managed 
through the construction of a new surface water drainage system, which will 
discharge to an attenuation pond, therefore posing no risk to the Project Site 
from flooding. In this regard, Chapter 9 of the ES (Document Reference 6.1) 
predicts that there will be no likely significant effects on water quality and 
resources during operation of the Project. 
6.2.159 Paragraph 5.15.9 of NPS EN-1 states that "the risk of impacts on the water 
environment can be reduced through careful design to facilitate adherence 
to good pollution control practice".  Further, Paragraph 5.15.10 of NPS EN-1 
states that “the impact on local water resources can be minimised through 
planning and design for the efficient use of water, including water and 
recycling”.  
6.2.160 In accordance with paragraphs 5.15.9 and 5.15.10 of NPS EN-1, the design 
of the Power Generation Plant, Electrical Connection and Gas Connection 
has been subject to detailed consideration and assessment in order to 
minimise the impact on water quality and resources, as explained in the 
Design and Access Statement (Document Reference 10.2) and as 
considered in Chapter 9 of the ES (Document Reference 6.1). 
6.2.161 Chapter 3 of the ES (Document Reference 6.1) sets out that, during 
construction, a series of embedded design mitigation measures will be 
implemented in respect of water resources.  The CEMP will include best 
practice working methods, including: siting stockpiles away from 
watercourses; refuelling on areas of hardstanding only away from 
watercourses and surface drains; and installing construction site drainage.  
In addition, all oil and chemical storage tanks and areas where drums are 
stored will be surrounded by an impermeable bund and located away from 
watercourses.  Any surface water contaminated by hydrocarbons will be 
passed through oil/grit interceptors prior to discharge.  
117 
 
6.2.162 During operation, as set out in Chapter 3 of the ES (Document Reference 
6.1), the EA will set limits on the quality of water that is discharged from the 
Project Site under the Environmental Permit.  Any surface water 
contaminated by hydrocarbons will be passed through oil/grit interceptors 
prior to discharge. Operational site drainage will be appropriately designed 
to meet the needs of the Project. Following the implementation of embedded 
mitigation measures (set out within Chapter 3 of the ES (Document 
Reference 6.1), it is concluded in Chapter 9 of the ES (Document Reference 
6.1) that impacts associated with the construction, operation and 
decommissioning phases are not significant.   
National Policy Statement for Fossil Fuel Electricity Generating 
Infrastructure (EN-2) 
Introduction 
6.2.163 Paragraph 1.1.1 of NPS EN-2 states “Fossil fuel generating stations play a 
vital role in providing reliable electricity supplies and a secure and diverse 
energy mix as the UK makes the transition to a low carbon economy…”    MPL 
acknowledges the ‘vital role’ of fossil fuel generating stations identified in 
paragraph 1.1.1 of NPS EN-2, as discussed further in section 4 of this 
Planning Statement. The Project will contribute materially towards the need 
for a diverse energy mix and the transition to a low carbon economy as 
required by NPS EN-2. 
6.2.164 Paragraph 1.2.1 of NPS EN-2 states that, NPS EN-2, together with NPS EN-
1, provides the primary basis for decisions by the SoS on applications for 
nationally significant fossil fuel electricity generating stations.  Accordingly, 
the Project has had regard to the provisions of NPS EN-2, as set out below. 
Factors influencing site selection by developers 
6.2.165 Part 2 of NPS EN-2 provides additional guidance to Part 4 and Part 5 of EN-
1 regarding the assessment of impacts specifically associated with fossil fuel 
generating stations.  Paragraph 2.2.1 of NPS EN-2, "it is for energy 
companies to decide which applications to bring forward and the government 
does not seek to direct applicants to particular sites for fossil fuel generating 
stations."  Paragraph 2.2.2 of NPS EN-2 notes that “Fossil fuel generating 
stations have large land footprints and will therefore only be possible where 
the applicant is able to acquire a suitably-sized site”. It also notes that 
“Applicants should locate new fossil fuel generating stations in the vicinity of 
existing transport routes wherever possible.”   
6.2.166 In respect of paragraphs 2.2.1 and 2.2.2 of NPS EN-2, in deciding upon the 
location of the Project Site, WPL undertook a detailed feasibility assessment1  
having regard to a number of technical, environmental, and economic factors, 
as explained in Chapter 5 of the ES (Document Reference 6.1). As part of 
the detailed feasibility assessment, WPL looked at a range of sites around 
the UK to support power generation plants of this nature. This search for 
                                                      
1 WPL undertook a detailed feasibility assessment in 2010 prior to the formation of MPL 
118 
 
potential power generation plant sites across the UK was focused on areas 
that were capable of meeting the Applicant’s strategic project development 
criteria:  
 Acceptable proximity to the national gas transmission system & the 
national electricity transmission system or local distribution networks;  
 Located within areas that are net importers of electricity; and 
 Located within areas of compatible land use designation/s. 
6.2.167 In terms of technical constraints, the size of the site (i.e. large enough to 
support a power generation plant of up to 299 MW and integral infrastructure) 
and the proximity of a site to appropriate gas and electrical connection points 
were both key considerations. 
6.2.168 From an environmental perspective, the site must have due regard to close 
sensitive receptors such as residential properties or sites of ecological 
importance (to avoid unacceptable impacts from noise and visual 
disturbance), the current nature of the surrounding area (to limit impacts on 
the landscape character of the area), previous site uses and land quality (to 
avoid sterilisation of the best and most versatile agricultural land or mineral 
assets) and proximity to sensitive ecological habitats. 
6.2.169 Based on these factors, the Project Site was considered suitable for the 
following reasons (see Chapter 5 of the ES (Document Reference 6.1)): 
 Close proximity to the gas National Transmission System; 
 Close proximity to a suitable electrical connection (400 kV overhead 
line) (see section 6.10 below); 
 The Generating Equipment Site is within previously developed land, 
lying below ground level (which is of use in screening the 
development) (see section 6.26 below); 
 It is within an area identified as being potentially suitable for energy 
infrastructure; 
 It has a well-developed road network for access to the Generating 
Equipment Site (see section 6.28 below); 
 The Project Site is outside of areas at risk of flooding (see section 6.24 
below); 
 There is adequate space to develop the Power Generation Plant and 
integral infrastructure; and 
 The Project Site is located in an area of net electricity import, and 
therefore there is demand for this type of development. 
 
 
119 
 
Government policy criteria for fossil fuel generating stations 
6.2.170 Section 2.3 of NPS EN-2 states that government policy criteria for fossil fuel 
generation stations relating to – CHP, CCR, CCS, climate change adaptation, 
and ‘good design’ – must be met before consent is given.  
6.2.171 In accordance with the requirements of section 2.3 of NPS EN-2, MPL has 
considered government policy criteria relating to CHP, CCR, CCS and 
climate change adaptation, as summarised below and explained throughout 
this Planning Statement and the ES (Document Reference 6.1). 
6.2.172 In respect of CHP, and as explained in Chapter 5 of the ES (Document 
Reference 6.1) efficient CHP plants are usually designed to meet the known 
heat demands of a suitable process.  This is in direct contrast to the operation 
of a OCGT peaking plant, which is designed to operate intermittently and 
unpredictably which is not suitable for CHP where the requirements are for a 
constant supply of heat.  In addition, as OCGT plant do not have any 
associated HRSG / steam turbine plant, the provision of steam from an 
OCGT plant would not be possible without the provision of additional steam 
raising plant / equipment, which would require more equipment to be 
constructed and a larger overall land take.  As such, it is considered, in 
Chapter 5 of the ES (Document Reference 6.1) that, following full exploration 
of possibilities for CHP in accordance with paragraph 4.6.6 of NPS EN-1, 
there are prohibitive barriers to the application of CHP at the Project Site and 
therefore CHP is not included within the Project. 
6.2.173 In respect of CCR, the Project would not meet or exceed the threshold of 
300MW and so is therefore not required to demonstrate Carbon Capture 
Readiness on the basis of section 4.7 of NPS-EN1. 
6.2.174 In respect of climate change adaptation, MPL has undertaken detailed 
assessment work to consider the potential impacts of climate change for the 
Project, in accordance with NPS EN-1 and NPS EN-2.  A number of Project 
alternatives have been assessed by MPL, taking into account a range of 
environmental factors, as set out with Chapter 5 of the ES (Document 
Reference 6.1).  The ES (Document Reference 6.1) contains a number of 
technical Chapters (including Chapters relating to air quality, ecology, water 
quality and resources, and geology and ground conditions), which include 
consideration of the potential impacts of climate change and set out 
appropriate mitigation measures where necessary.  In addition, a FRA 
(Document Reference 5.4) has also been prepared to consider the potential 
impact of flooding on the Project. 
6.2.175 Section 2.3.13 of NPS EN-2 sets out considerations specifically for fossil fuel 
generating stations in respect of climate change. Section 2.13.2 of NPS EN-
2 suggests that as fossil fuel generating stations are likely to be proposed for 
coastal or estuarine sites, applicants should set out how the proposal would 
be resilient to: coastal changes and increased risk from storm surge; effects 
of higher temperatures, including higher temperatures of cooling water; and 
increased risk of drought leading to a lack of available cooling water.  
120 
 
6.2.176 In respect of section 2.13.3 of NPS EN-2, the Project is not located in a 
coastal region or in close proximity to any tidal rivers and therefore 
consideration of coastal changes, higher temperatures and drought is not 
required in accordance with NPS EN-2.  Similarly, the Project does not 
require a supply of cooling water other than that in the proposed tank on site 
due to the proposed OCGT technology. 
6.2.177 Paragraph 2.3.16 of NPS EN-2 states that, “Applicants should demonstrate 
good design particularly in respect of landscape and visual amenity ...and in 
the design of the project to mitigate impacts such as noise and vibration, 
transport impacts and air emissions.” 
6.2.178 In accordance with paragraph 2.3.16 of NPS EN-2, MPL has sought to adopt 
good design principles as part of the Project and in respect of landscape and 
visual amenity as explained within the Design and Access Statement 
(Document Reference 10.2).  The form, scale, massing and landscaping has 
been designed so that the Power Generation Plant blends in with its 
surroundings minimising visual intrusion from key viewpoints, this includes a 
reduction in the amount of stacks proposed as part of the Project.  
6.2.179 An assessment of likely impacts of the Project in respect of noise and 
vibration, transport impacts and air emissions has been undertaken as part 
of the EIA and the findings, including appropriate mitigation measures, are 
presented in Chapters 6, 7 and 12 of the ES (Document Reference 6.1). 
Impacts of fossil fuel generating stations 
6.2.180 Section 2.4 of NPS EN-2 contains additional policy for assessing the potential 
impacts of energy infrastructure projects for fossil fuel generating stations, 
relating to: air emissions; landscape and visual; release of dust by coal-fired 
generating stations; residue management for coal-fired generating stations; 
and water quality and resources. 
6.2.181 In accordance with the provisions of section 2.4 of NPS EN-2, an assessment 
of the likely impacts of the Project in respect of air quality, emissions, 
landscape and visual impacts, and water quality and resources has been 
undertaken as part of the EIA and the findings, including appropriate 
mitigation measures, are presented in Chapters 6, 9, 11 and 15 of the ES 
(Document Reference 6.1). 
Air quality and emissions 
6.2.182 Paragraph 2.5.2 of NPS EN-2 acknowledges that CO2 emissions are a 
significant adverse impact of fossil fuel generating stations. As such, 
paragraph 2.5.5 of EN-2 states that an assessment should be carried out at 
the initial stages of developing proposals, and Paragraph 2.5.8 of EN-2 states 
that the SoS and EA should be satisfied that the potential adverse impacts of 
mitigation measures are assessed.  
6.2.183 In accordance with paragraphs 2.5.5 of NPS EN-2, an assessment of the 
likely impacts, in respect of air quality and emissions, has been undertaken 
121 
 
in the EIA and findings are presented in Chapter 6 of the ES (Document 
Reference 6.1).  The assessment included consideration of the closest 
residential dwelling to the Power Generation Plant Site at South Pillinge 
Farm, located approximately 130 m to the west of the Project Site. 
6.2.184 Chapter 6 of the ES (Document Reference 6.1) states that during the 
construction / decommissioning phase of the Power Generation Plant, the 
main potential air quality effects are dust deposition and therefore elevated 
PM10 concentrations.  During the construction / decommissioning of the Gas 
Connection and Electrical Connection, the risk of dust emissions is 
considered to be low (see Chapter 6 of the ES (Document Reference 6.1)). 
6.2.185 In order to limit dust during construction, embedded design mitigation 
measures would be incorporated, as set out within Chapter 3 of the ES 
(Document Reference 6.1).  These best practice measures, to be produced 
and implemented as part of the CEMP, would include wheel washing, 
damping down of stockpiles during dry and windy conditions, and sheeting 
materials to prevent dust migration.  
6.2.186 During the operational phase of the Power Generation Plant, there will be an 
insignificant effect in terms of: maximum predicted ground level 
concentrations; predicted annual mean oxides of nitrogen concentrations; 
predicted nitrogen deposition rates; and road traffic.  All acid deposition 
impacts are insignificant except for Rookery Clay Pit CWS (see Chapter 6 of 
the ES (Document Reference 6.1)). 
6.2.187 Emissions to air during the operational phase of the Gas Connection will 
potentially include infrequent emissions of natural gas; however these are 
expected to be minimal and limited to infrequent venting of gas from the AGI 
under abnormal, maintenance or emergency conditions. There is a very 
limited scope for potential impacts on air quality relating to the operation of 
the Electrical Connection with only minor infrequent emissions associated 
with road vehicles used for maintenance of the connection.  The Project has 
been designed from the outset to comply with legislative limits for the 
emissions of pollutants, particularly NOx (see Chapter 6 of the ES (Document 
Reference 6.1)).  
Landscape and visual 
6.2.188 Paragraph 2.6.2 of NPS EN-2 advises that the main structures of a fossil fuel 
generating station – including the turbine and boiler halls, exhaust gas stack, 
storage facilities, cooling towers, and water processing plant – are large and 
likely to have an impact on the surrounding landscape and visual amenity.  A 
landscape and visual impact assessment should therefore be included as 
part of the ES, and consideration should be given to the design of the plant, 
the materials to be used, and the visual impact of the stack (paragraphs 2.6.3 
and 2.6.4 of NPS EN-2).   
6.2.189 In accordance with paragraph 2.6.2 of NPS EN-2, an assessment of the likely 
landscape and visual impact associated with the proposed development has 
122 
 
been undertaken in the EIA and the findings are presented in Chapter 11 of 
the ES (Document Number 6.1). 
6.2.190 Chapter 11 of the ES (Document Reference 6.1) states that the main works 
associated with the construction / decommissioning phases of the Power 
Generation Plant would be excavation and site levelling for new foundations 
and, potential piling (if required) and craning the Gas Turbine Generator units 
into position.  Construction of the Gas Connection (particularly the AGI) and 
the Electrical Connection would have similar impacts, although they would 
be of a more limited extent.  It is considered that adverse temporary 
landscape and visual effects have the potential to arise, however, the 
construction phase is of a limited duration (22 months) and the potential 
impacts will not all occur simultaneously (as stated in Chapter 11 of the ES 
(Document Reference 6.1)). 
6.2.191 During the operation of the Power Generation Plant, Chapter 11 of the ES 
(Document Reference 6.1) states that significant effects are likely, due to the 
Generating Equipment and up to 35m high stack.  The stack is likely to be 
visible from certain locations in and around the Project Site (i.e. from the 
south and south-east of the Project Site).  However, the majority of views of 
the Power Generation Plant Site will be seen in the context of the existing 
wind turbine at the Millennium Country Park, and surrounding structures. In 
addition, the Project Site is approximately 15m below ground level, effectively 
ensuring that the stack is only part visible above ground level.  The Power 
Generation Plant is also very well screened by intermediate hedges and belts 
of woodland.  
6.2.192 As set out in Chapter 11 of the ES (Document Reference 6.1), during 
operation the majority of the Gas Connection (the pipeline) will be buried 
underground, and the typical design of the AGI would incorporate screen 
planting on all sides.  Given the significant distance of the AGI from 
residential properties, there are not considered to be any impacts arising from 
visual amenity as a result of operation of the Gas Connection. 
6.2.193 As set out in Chapter 11 of the ES (Document Reference 6.1), the Electrical 
Connection will be buried underground during operation and therefore there 
will not be any significant adverse effects on landscape or visual amenity.  
Whilst the undergrounding of the Electrical Connection would require one 
new tower, this would replace an existing tower and would be located in the 
existing Grendon – Sundon transmission route corridor, thereby resulting in 
no net additional towers and therefore no additional landscape and visual 
impacts. 
6.2.194 Paragraph 2.6.5 of EN-2 states that mitigation is to minimise impact on visual 
amenity as far as reasonably practicable; however, paragraph 2.6.10 of NPS 
EN-2 states that the visibility of a fossil fuel generating station should be given 
limited weight if the SoS is satisfied that the location is appropriate for the 
project and that it has been designed sensitively. 
6.2.195 As explained in the Design and Access Statement (Document Reference 
10.2) and Chapter 11 of the ES (Document Reference 6.1), the Project has 
123 
 
been designed sensitively by virtue of its appropriate siting within Rookery 
South Pit (which is approximately 15 m below ground level), and by 
surrounding vegetation, thereby limiting the landscape and visual impact to 
views from the south and south east of the Project Site, along higher ground. 
6.2.196 The construction period is of a limited duration (approximately 22 months), 
and therefore significant mitigation to limit landscape and visual impacts 
during this phase is not anticipated (see Chapter 11 of the ES (Document 
Reference 6.1). However, a number of measures will be applied through a 
CEMP (secured by way of a requirement in Schedule 2 to the DCO 
(Document Reference 3.1), including: limiting land/vegetation clearance; best 
practice temporary protection of vegetation; temporary storage of soils; 
appropriate layout of construction areas; restricting construction site lighting; 
maintenance of compounds; erection of hoardings; removal of temporary 
structures when appropriate; reinstatement of agricultural land; replacement 
of trees and hedgerows; and screening of the AGI. 
6.2.197 During operation, as set out in Chapter 11 of the ES (Document Reference 
6.1), embedded good design mitigation measures and additional planting in 
some areas across the Project Site will be incorporated in order to blend the 
Power Generation Plant into the landscape as much as possible. 
Noise and vibration 
6.2.198 Paragraph 2.7.1 of NPS EN-2 advises that the sources of noise and vibration 
from fossil fuel generating stations may include the gas and steam turbines 
and external noise sources such as externally-sited air-cooled condensers.  
Paragraph 2.7.2 of EN-2 states that the ES should include a noise 
assessment.   
6.2.199 In accordance with paragraph 2.7.1 of NPS EN-2, an assessment of the likely 
noise and vibration impacts associated with the Project has been undertaken 
in the EIA and the findings are presented in Chapter 7 of the ES (Document 
Reference 6.1). 
6.2.200 Chapter 7 of the ES (Document Reference 6.1) states that construction and 
decommissioning activity inevitably leads to some degree of noise 
disturbance at locations in close proximity to these activities. Noise at the 
Project Site during construction and decommissioning could arise from e.g. 
excavation for foundations, delivery of plant, and excavation of the trenches 
to lay the Gas Connection and Electrical Connection. This will however be a 
temporary source of noise. Based on a conservative, worst case assessment, 
where numerous large plant items are operating simultaneously across the 
Project Site, Chapter 7 of the ES (Document Reference 6.1) states that the 
significance of the overall effect of construction and decommissioning noise 
from the Project is predicted to be slight adverse and therefore not significant 
following the implementation of embedded mitigation.  During operation, 
noise could occur from the rotating components of the Generating Equipment 
and there may be limited noise from the Access Road, although the likely 
impact of this on human health will not be significant when compared to the 
existing traffic noise.  There will also be small amounts of noise generated by 
124 
 
the AGI, however this noise is rarely perceptible except when in very close 
proximity to the AGI (see Chapter 7 of the ES (Document Reference 6.1)). 
6.2.201 Paragraph 2.7.5 of EN-2 states that mitigation should be achieved through 
‘good design’, including enclosure of plant and machinery in noise-reducing 
buildings where possible. 
6.2.202 In accordance with paragraph 2.7.5 of NPS EN-2, the design of the Power 
Generation Plant, Electrical Connection and Gas Connection has been 
subject to detailed consideration and assessment in order to minimise the 
noise and vibration impact, as set out further within the Design and Access 
Statement (Document Reference 10.2).  Embedded mitigation measures in 
respect of noise and vibration, as set out at Chapter 3 of the ES (Document 
Reference 6.1) include: an appropriately placed acoustic screen, 
implementation of a CEMP, and inherent best practice design incorporating 
acoustic enclosures. All construction activities relating to the Power 
Generation Plant, Gas Connection and Electrical Connection would be 
carried out in accordance with the recommendations of BS 5228, along with 
embedded mitigation measures. The CEMP would incorporate best practice 
working methods. 
Water quality and resources 
6.2.203 Paragraph 2.10.1 of NPS EN-2 advises that water cooling systems for fossil 
fuel generating stations may have additional impacts on water quality, 
abstraction and discharge.  Where the project is likely to have an effect on 
water quality and resources, Paragraph 2.10.2 of EN-2 states that an 
assessment should be undertaken to ‘demonstrate that appropriate 
measures will be put in place to avoid or minimise adverse impacts of 
abstraction and discharge of cooling water.’  
6.2.204 In accordance with paragraph 2.10.2 of NPS EN-2 an assessment of the 
likely effects on water quality and resources associated with the proposed 
development has been undertaken in the EIA and the findings are presented 
in Chapter 9 of the ES (Document Reference 6.1). 
6.2.205 As set out in Chapter 9 of the ES (Document Reference 6.1), the main 
potential impacts that may result from construction and decommissioning of 
the Project are contaminated material entering a surface water body or for 
the Generating Equipment Site to become inundated with flood water.  
However, there are not anticipated to be any effects on the water bodies 
identified as best practice working methods and mitigation will be employed.  
6.2.206 These mitigation measures include having appropriate spill response plans 
in place, the refuelling of vehicles away from watercourses and the siting of 
stockpiles and materials away from watercourses and will all be contained 
within the CEMP. In order to minimise adverse effects best practice would be 
employed during construction of the Gas Connection to protect the water 
environment, in accordance with guidelines published by the Environment 
Agency and Internal Drainage Board. It is predicted that, as set out in Chapter 
9 of the ES (Document Reference 6.1), that following the implementation of 
125 
 
embedded mitigation and best practice construction methods referred to 
above, any effects on water quality and resources will be negligible. 
National Policy Statement for Gas Supply Infrastructure and Gas and 
Oil Pipelines (EN-4) 
Introduction 
6.2.207 Paragraph 1.2.1 of NPS EN-4, together with NPS EN-1, provides the primary 
basis for decisions by the SoS on applications for gas supply infrastructure 
and gas and oil pipelines.  Accordingly, the Project has had regard to the 
provisions of NPS EN-4, as set out below. 
6.2.208 Part 2 of NPS EN-4 provides additional guidance to Part 4 and Part 5 of EN-
1 regarding the assessment of impacts specific to gas supply infrastructure 
and oil and gas pipelines.   
Gas and Oil Pipelines Impacts 
6.2.209 Sections 2.20 – 2.23 of NPS EN-4 set out additional policy for assessing the 
potential impacts of gas and oil pipelines, relating to: noise and vibration; 
biodiversity, landscape and visual; water quality and resources; and soil and 
geology. 
6.2.210 In accordance with the provisions of sections 2.20 – 2.23 of NPS EN-4, an 
assessment of the likely impacts in respect of noise and vibration, 
biodiversity, landscape and visual impacts, water quality and resources, and 
ground conditions, has been undertaken as part of the EIA and the findings 
are presented in Chapters 7 – 11 of the ES (Document Reference 6.1). 
Gas and Oil Pipelines Impacts: Noise and Vibration 
6.2.211 Paragraph 2.20.2 of NPS EN-4 states that there are specific noise and 
vibration impacts which apply to gas pipelines, including – ‘During the pre-
construction phase there could be vibration effects from seismic surveys. 
During construction, tasks may include site clearance, soil movement, 
ground excavation, tunnelling, trenching, pipe laying and welding, and 
ground reinstatement. In addition, increased HGV traffic will be generated on 
local roads for the movement of materials.’  Paragraph 2.20.5 of NPS EN-4 
states that the ES should include an assessment of all of the above noise 
and vibration effects during the pre-construction and construction phases.  
6.2.212 In accordance with paragraph 2.20.5 of NPS EN-1, an assessment of the 
likely impacts of the Project in respect of noise and vibration, during 
construction, operation and decommissioning, has been undertaken as part 
of the EIA and the findings are presented in the ES (Document Reference 
6.1).  In respect of paragraph 2.20.2 of NPS EN-4, Chapter 7 of the ES 
(Document Reference 6.1) states that noise at the Project Site during 
construction could arise from excavation of the trenches to lay the Gas 
Connection. This will however be a temporary source of noise. Based on a 
conservative, worst case assessment, where numerous large plant items are 
operating simultaneously across the Project Site, the significance of the 
126 
 
overall effect of construction noise from the Project is predicted to be slight 
adverse for the Gas Connection and therefore not significant (see Chapter 7 
of the ES (Document Reference 6.1)).   
Gas and Oil Pipelines Impacts: Biodiversity, Landscape and Visual 
6.2.213 Paragraph 2.21.1 of NPS EN-4 states that the construction of a pipeline can 
impact upon ‘specific landscape elements within and adjacent to the pipeline 
route, such as grasslands, field boundaries (hedgerows, hedgebanks, 
drystone walls, fences), trees, woodlands, and watercourses.’  Accordingly, 
the ES should include an assessment of the biodiversity and landscape and 
visual effects of the proposed route and of the main alternative routes 
considered’ (paragraph 2.21.3 of NPS EN-4).  Where it is not possible to 
restore the landscape to its original state, paragraph 2.21.3 of EN-4 also 
states that ‘the applicant should set out measures to avoid, mitigate, or 
employ other landscape measures to compensate for, any adverse effect on 
the landscape.’  
6.2.214 In accordance with the provisions of paragraph 2.21.3 of NPS EN-4, an 
assessment of the likely landscape and visual impacts and biodiversity 
impacts has been undertaken as part of the EIA and the findings are 
presented in Chapters 11 and 8 of the ES (Document Reference 6.1). 
6.2.215 Chapter 11 of the ES (Document Reference 6.1) states that the main 
potential sources of landscape and visual impact during construction of the 
Project are: earthworks, site clearance works, removal of vegetation (in the 
case of the Gas Connection and Electrical Connection), presence of 
construction traffic, construction of the Electrical Connection temporary 
diversion and presence of construction site lighting. During operation, effects 
on landscape and visual amenity will result from the introduction of 
permanent structures, particularly the stack of the Generating Equipment 
which will be the tallest structure on the Project Site. 
6.2.216 However, it is noted in Chapter 11 of the ES (Document Reference 6.1) that, 
given the limited construction period (22 months) and the relatively modest 
construction operations, the construction effects are considered to be not 
significant from the majority of locations.  Furthermore, during operation the 
Project will be largely screened from views by the fact that a large proportion 
is sited within the Rookery South Pit (meaning that only 17.5-20 m of the 
stack will be visible above the edge of the pit). The Project will also be viewed 
in the context of other industrial development such as large towers of the 
former London Brick Works, the existing Sundon to Grendon overhead line 
and towers and the wind turbine at the Millennium Country Park.  Views of 
the stack will be clearly visible in some views from the south and south east, 
particularly along the Greensands Ridge and from footpath 14 (see Chapter 
11 of the ES (Document Reference 6.1)). 
6.2.217 Further, as set out within the Outline Landscaping Plans (Document 
Reference 2.9), the design of landscape planting will enhance the area’s 
biodiversity through the retention of existing woodland; the planting of belts 
of trees to increase the amount of woodland in the area; the reinstatement of 
127 
 
planting where possible and appropriate; and careful management of soils 
during construction works to facilitate plant growth, to be implemented as part 
of the CEMP. 
6.2.218 In respect of biodiversity, and in accordance with paragraph 2.21.3 of NPS 
EN-4, an assessment of the likely effects of the Project on site of ecological 
importance, protected species and habitats has been undertaken as part of 
the EIA and the findings are contained within Chapter 8 of the ES (Document 
Reference 6.1).  The ES (Document Reference 6.1) states that no likely 
significant effects are anticipated on ecological receptors as a result of the 
construction, operation or decommissioning of the Project. 
Gas and Oil Pipelines Impacts: Water Quality and Resources 
6.2.219 Paragraph 2.22.2 of NPS EN-4 advises that ‘constructing pipelines creates 
corridors of surface clearance and excavation that can potentially affect 
watercourses, aquifers, water abstraction and discharge points, areas prone 
to flooding and ecological receptors.  As such, an assessment should be 
provided in the ES where the project is likely to have effects on water 
resources or water quality, for example through impacts on: ‘groundwater 
recharge or on existing surface water or ground abstraction points; 
associated ecological receptors’, or through: ‘siltation or spillages, 
discharges from maintenance activities or the discharge of disposals such as 
wastewater or solvents’ (NPS EN-4 paragraphs 2.22.3 and 2.22.4). 
6.2.220 In accordance with paragraph 2.22.2 of NPS EN-4, an assessment of the 
likely impacts of the Project in respect of water quality and resources has 
been undertaken in the EIA and the findings are presented in Chapter 9 of 
the ES (Document Reference 6.1). 
6.2.221 As set out in Chapter 9 of the ES (Document Reference 6.1), the main 
potential impacts that may result from construction and decommissioning of 
the Project are contaminated material entering a surface water body or for 
the Generating Equipment Site to become inundated with flood water.  
However, there are not anticipated to be any effects on the water bodies 
identified as best practice working methods and mitigation will be employed. 
These mitigation measures include having appropriate spill response plans 
in place, the refuelling of vehicles away from watercourses and the siting of 
stockpiles and materials away from watercourses and will all be contained 
within the CEMP. In order to minimise adverse effects best practice would be 
employed during construction of the Gas Connection to protect the water 
environment, in accordance with guidelines published by the Environment 
Agency and Internal Drainage Board. It is predicted that following the 
implementation of embedded mitigation and best practice construction 
methods referred to above, any effects on water quality and resources will be 
negligible (see Chapter 9 of the ES (Document Reference 6.1)). 
6.2.222 During operation, as set out in Chapter 9 of the ES (Document Reference 
6.1), the Power Generation Plant Site would be equipped with a surface water 
drainage system (which would tie into the drainage system developed as part 
of the LLRS and a sewerage system which would feed to a septic tank, with 
128 
 
waste tankered off site. The surface water drainage system would remove 
any potentially polluted runoff through the use of oil interceptors and silt traps, 
prior to discharge into an attenuation pond created as part of the LLRS. The 
Project will lead to an increase in the amount of runoff from within the Power 
Generation Plant Site boundary due to the increase in hardstanding. 
However, part of the LLRS works to Rookery Pit mean that any excess 
surface water (e.g. from a large storm event) will be effectively managed 
through the construction of a new surface water drainage system, which will 
discharge to an attenuation pond, therefore posing no risk to the Project Site 
from flooding. In this regard, Chapter 9 of the ES (Document Reference 6.1) 
predicts that there will be no likely significant effects on water quality and 
resources during operation of the Project. 
Gas and Oil Pipelines Impacts: Soil and Geology 
6.2.223 Paragraph 2.23.1 of NPS EN-4 states that ‘it will be important for applicants 
to understand the soil types and the nature of the underlying strata.’  
Accordingly, applicants should consult with the relevant statutory consultees 
at an early stage regarding the potential impact of gas pipelines on soil and 
geology (paragraph 2.23.4).  Paragraph 2.23.2 states that applicants should 
assess the stability of the ground conditions associated with the pipeline 
route, including considering the options for installing the pipeline.  
6.2.224 MPL has consulted relevant statutory consultees regarding the potential 
impact of the Project on ground conditions from an early stage as recorded 
in the Consultation Report (Document Reference 5.1.0) in accordance with 
paragraph 2.23.1 of NPS EN-4.  An assessment of the potential impact of the 
Project on ground conditions has been undertaken as part of the EIA and is 
set out in Chapter 10 of the ES (Document Reference 6.1) in accordance with 
paragraph 2.23.2 of NPS EN-4. 
National Policy Statement for Electricity Networks Infrastructure (EN-5) 
Introduction 
6.2.225 NPS EN-5, together with NPS EN-1, provides the primary basis for decisions 
by the SoS on applications for electricity networks infrastructure NSIPs (NPS 
EN-5 Paragraph 1.2.1) such as overhead lines, and associated development 
of electrical networks infrastructure (such as substations) for other NSIPs. 
The Project considered an overhead line as an alternative for the Electrical 
Connection, and includes an electrical substation. Accordingly, the Project 
has had regard to the provisions of NPS EN-5 as they relate to substations 
and the consideration of alternative Electrical Connections, as set out below. 
6.2.226 Part 2 of NPS EN-5 provides additional guidance to Part 4 and Part 5 of EN-
1 regarding the assessment of impacts specific to electricity networks 
infrastructure.   
 
 
129 
 
Climate change adaptation 
6.2.227 In respect of climate change adaptation, paragraph 2.4.1 of NPS EN-5 states 
that applicants should set out the extent to which the proposed development 
would be vulnerable and how it would be resilient to: flooding; the effects of 
wind and storms; higher average temperatures; and earth movement or 
subsidence. 
6.2.228 In accordance with paragraph 2.4.1 of NPS EN-5, MPL has undertaken 
detailed assessment work to consider the potential impacts of climate change 
for the Project.  A number of Project alternatives have been assessed by 
MPL, taking into account a range of environmental factors, as set out with 
Chapter 5 of the ES (Document Reference 6.1).  The ES (Document 
Reference 6.1) contains a number of technical Chapters (including Chapters 
relating to air quality, ecology, water quality and resources, and geology and 
ground conditions), which include consideration of the potential impacts of 
climate change and set out appropriate mitigation measures where 
necessary.  In addition, a FRA (Document Reference 5.4) has also been 
prepared to consider the potential impact of flooding on the Project.  The 
Project is not located in a coastal region or in close proximity to any tidal 
rivers and therefore consideration of coastal changes, higher temperatures 
and drought is not required in accordance with NPS EN-2.  Similarly, the 
Project does not require a supply of cooling water other than that in the 
proposed tank on site due to the proposed OCGT technology. 
Consideration of good design / Landscape and visual 
6.2.229 Paragraph 2.5.2 of NPS EN-5 states that, ‘proposals for electricity networks 
infrastructure should demonstrate good design in their approach to mitigating 
the potential adverse impacts which can be associated with overhead lines’, 
particularly in respect of: biodiversity and geological conservation; landscape 
and visual; noise and vibration; and EMFs.  Paragraphs 2.8.4 – 2.8.6 of NPS 
EN-5 state that applicants should follow guidance set out in the Holford Rules 
when considering the approach to the routeing of new overhead lines.  NPS 
EN-5 paragraph 2.8.4 also states that applicants should offer ‘constructive 
proposals for additional mitigation of the proposed overhead lines’, and 
consider the ‘potential costs and benefits of other feasible means of 
connection or reinforcement’ where the proposed overhead line is likely to 
have a significant visual impact.  
6.2.230 Paragraph 2.8.8 of NPS EN-5 acknowledges that, whilst the development of 
overhead lines will often be appropriate for meeting the need for new 
electricity lines of 132kV and above, there are cases where overhead lines 
are not appropriate.  This paragraph adds, “Where there are serious 
concerns about the potential adverse landscape and visual effects of a 
proposed overhead line, the [SoS] will have to balance these against other 
relevant factors, including the need for the proposed infrastructure, the 
availability and cost of alternative sites and routes and methods of installation 
(including undergrounding).”  
130 
 
6.2.231 Paragraph 2.8.9 of NPS EN-5 notes, “The impacts and costs of both 
overhead and underground options vary considerably between individual 
projects (both in absolute and relative terms). Therefore, each project should 
be assessed individually on the basis of its specific circumstances and taking 
account of the fact that Government has not laid down any general rule about 
when an overhead line should be considered unacceptable.” 
6.2.232 In respect of section 2.8 of NPS EN-5, MPL has undertaken detailed 
consideration of the proposed Electrical Connection having regard to the 
provisions of NPS EN-5 guidance. The Scoping Report for the Project 
described an Electrical Connection opportunity area to the south of the 
Generating Equipment Site, in which the Electrical Connection would be 
developed. Following publication of the Scoping Report, further studies were 
undertaken to refine the available options.  
6.2.233 Based on these studies, it has been determined that the most suitable 
location for the substation is likely to be next to the Generating Equipment 
Site within Rookery South Pit. However, a number of options still existed on 
the best way to connect the substation to the existing NETS. These included 
the use of an overhead line connection requiring up to 6 additional pylons.    
6.2.234 As set out within Chapter 5 of the ES (Document Reference 6.1) and the 
Consultation Report (Document Reference 5.1), statutory consultation 
generated a number of responses expressing concerns over the potential 
impacts of new pylons on the landscape and visual amenity, and in particular 
the potential for adverse effects on Ampthill Park. During its evaluation of 
responses, the Applicant recognised that consultees had expressed a strong 
preference for the development of an underground cable connection option.   
6.2.235 These views were taken on board by MPL and a presumption in favour of 
developing a wholly or partially underground cable option was adopted by the 
project team. This was considered to represent more limited potential for 
significant adverse landscape and visual impacts than an overhead line 
option. 
6.2.236 Following further consultation with National Grid regarding the preferred 
choice of Electrical Connection from the MPL site to the 400kV National 
Electricity Transmission line to the south, it was concluded that Electrical 
Connection option 2 is less suitable than option 1. As a result, Electrical 
Connection option 1, comprising a double circuit tee-in and two SECs which 
will be located on either side of the existing transmission line.   
Electric and Magnetic Fields (EMFs) 
6.2.237 Paragraph 2.10.1 of NPS EN-5 advises that ‘power frequency Electric and 
Magnetic Fields (EMFs) arise from generation, transmission, distribution and 
use of electricity and will occur around power lines and electric cables.  
Paragraph 2.10.15 of EN-5 states that in order to mitigate for EMFs, the 
applicant should consider: height, position, insulation and protection 
measures; optimal phasing of high voltage overhead power lines where 
possible and practicable; and any new Government advice. 
131 
 
6.2.238 In accordance with the provisions of paragraph 2.10.1 and 2.10.15 of NPS 
EN-5, MPL has had regard to the potential impacts of the Project in respect 
of EMF.  A full EMF report has been prepared for the Project and is included 
as Appendix 15.1 to the ES (Document Reference 6.1) to consider the 
potential impacts of EMF generated from high voltage electrical equipment.  
The EMF report (Appendix 15.1 of the ES (Document Reference 6.1)) 
concludes that it is likely that that the EMF field strength for the Project would 
be minimal given that the Electrical Connection would be an underground 
cable. Any above ground elements would have a similar EMF field strength 
to that which is already present associated with the existing 400 kV Sundon 
to Grendon overhead line. 
6.3 
Other Important and Relevant Matters 
6.3.1 
Section 6.3 of this Planning Statement provides an assessment of the Project 
in regard to other matters which are considered to be both “important and 
relevant” (Section 104, PA 2008), which comprises the National Planning 
Policy Framework (NPPF), National Planning Policy Guidance (NPPG) and 
relevant local planning policy adopted or being prepared by Central 
Bedfordshire Council and Bedford Borough Council. 
Other National Planning Policy 
NPPF 
6.3.2 
The NPPF does not contain specific policies for NSIPs.  Instead, Paragraph 
3 of the NPPF states that NSIPs “are determined in accordance with the 
decision-making framework set out in the PA 2008 and relevant national 
policy statements for major infrastructure, as well as any other matters that 
are considered both important and relevant (which may include the National 
Planning Policy Framework).”  The DCO Application is therefore to be 
determined primarily in accordance with NPS EN-1, NPS EN-2, NPS EN-4 
and NPS EN-5.   
6.3.3 
However, the NPPF does contain some general planning guidance which 
may be considered to be “both important and relevant” (section 104, PA 
2008) to the determination of the DCO Application. 
6.3.4 
Paragraph 14 of the NPPF sets out a ‘presumption in favour of sustainable 
development’, such that development that is sustainable is approved without 
delay.  Sustainable development incorporates: an economic role, which 
includes identifying and coordinating the provision of infrastructure; a social 
role, which includes meeting the community’s needs; and an environmental 
role, which includes protecting and enhancing the environment and adapting 
to a low carbon economy (paragraph 7).  Further, Paragraph 56 of the NPPF 
states that ‘good design is a key aspect of sustainable development’ and is 
‘indivisible from good planning.’   
6.3.5 
As set out within the Design and Access Statement (Document Reference 
10.2) and the ES (Document Reference 6.1), the Project has been designed 
in accordance with good design principles.  The Project is considered to

constitute sustainable development, by virtue of its contribution to a low-
carbon future and its contribution to the local and national economy, and 
should therefore be considered favourably in accordance with the provisions 
of paragraph 14 of the NPPF. 
6.3.6 
Paragraph 17 of the NPPF sets out 12 core planning principles, which 
include: 
 Proactively driving and supporting economic development to deliver 
amongst other things the infrastructure that the country needs; 
 Always seeking to secure high quality design; 
 Taking account of the different roles and character of different areas; 
 Supporting the transition to a low carbon future; 
 Contributing to conserving and enhancing the natural environment; 
and 
 Encouraging the effective use of land by reusing land that has been 
previously developed. 
6.3.7 
Paragraph 18 of the NPPF explains that the Government is committed to 
securing economic growth and to meeting the challenge of a low carbon 
future. 
6.3.8 
In accordance with paragraph 18 of the NPPF, the Project will support 
national economic growth and the drive towards a low-carbon future, as 
demonstrated in the ES (Document Reference 6.1) and this Planning 
Statement.  
6.3.9 
The Project will have slight positive effects on the socio-economic status of 
the area during construction through both employment creation and capital 
expenditure and worker spending in the local economy, as set out in Chapter 
14 of the ES (Document Reference 6.1).  It is anticipated that up to 122 
construction workers would be required at the Project Site during peak 
periods at any one time. Project construction would support up to nine 
permanent full time equivalent construction jobs. Further, Chapter 14 of the 
ES (Document Reference 6.1) states that construction, decommissioning 
and operation of the Project could occur simultaneously with other projects 
in the vicinity of the Project Site. 
6.3.10 
Drax are seeking to develop flexible gas fired generation assets to support 
the UK Government's drive to a low carbon economy. The Project would 
contribute materially to the immediate and medium term need for flexible, 
reliable, peak load power generation and facilitate the transition to a low 
carbon economy. 
133 
 
6.3.11 
Paragraph 66 of the NPPF states that proposals in which an applicant has 
worked closely with those directly affected by their views should be 
considered favourably. 
6.3.12 
In accordance with the provisions of paragraph 66 of the NPPF, and as set 
out within the Consultation Report (Document Reference 5.1) MPL has 
invested considerable time and resources during the pre-application phase 
of the Project in order to encourage meaningful involvement by the local 
community, those interested in the Project Site, Local Authorities and other 
prescribed consultees. Consequently, the Project has developed in a 
consultative and iterative manner, during successive stages of development. 
6.3.13 
Paragraph 93 of the NPPF acknowledges that planning plays a key role in 
supporting the delivery of low carbon energy and therefore achieving the 
economic, social and environmental dimensions of sustainable development.  
Paragraph 97 of the NPPF advises that, in order to increase the use and 
supply of low carbon energy, there should be a positive strategy to promoting 
energy from renewable and low carbon sources, whilst ensuring that adverse 
impacts are addressed satisfactorily. 
6.3.14 
The Project seeks to develop low carbon energy infrastructure and should 
therefore be considered positively in accordance with the provisions of 
paragraphs 93 and 97 of the NPPF.  The likely adverse impacts of the Project 
have been assessed as part of the EIA and addressed with appropriate 
mitigation where necessary, as presented in the ES (Document Reference 
6.1). 
6.3.15 
Paragraph 109 of the NPPF states that ‘the planning system should 
contribute to and enhance the natural and local environment’ by: 
 protecting 
and 
enhancing 
valued 
landscapes, 
geological 
conservation interests and soils; 
 recognising the wider benefits of ecosystem services; 
 minimising impacts on biodiversity and providing net gains in 
biodiversity where possible; 
 preventing new development from contributing to or being put at 
unacceptable risk from, or being adversely affected by unacceptable 
levels of soil, air, water or noise pollution or land instability; and 
 remediating 
and 
mitigating 
despoiled, 
degraded, 
derelict, 
contaminated and unstable land, where appropriate. 
6.3.16 
In accordance with the provisions of paragraph 109 of the NPPF, the Project 
has been designed to contribute to and enhance the natural and local 
environment.  As set out within the Outline Landscaping Plans (Document 
Reference 2.9), the design of landscape planting will enhance the area’s 
biodiversity through the retention of existing woodland; the planting of belts 
of trees to increase the amount of woodland in the area; the reinstatement of 
134 
 
planting where possible and appropriate; and careful management of soils 
during construction works to facilitate plant growth, to be implemented as part 
of the CEMP. 
6.3.17 
Paragraph 121 of the NPPF advises that a site should be suitable, taking into 
account ground conditions and land instability, pollution and proposed 
mitigation.  
6.3.18 
In accordance with the provisions of paragraph 121 of the NPPF, in deciding 
upon the location of the Project Site, WPL undertook a detailed feasibility 
assessment having regard to a number of technical, environmental, and 
economic factors, as set out in Chapter 5 of the ES (Document Reference 
6.1). 
6.3.19 
Paragraph 123 of the NPPF advises that planning decisions should seek to 
avoid noise from giving rise to significant adverse impacts on health and 
quality of life, and to mitigate any adverse impacts where necessary. 
6.3.20 
In accordance with the provisions of paragraph 123 of the NPPF, MPL has 
sought to avoid significant adverse noise impacts through the design of the 
Project and appropriate mitigation measures.  An assessment of the likely 
effects of the Project in respect of noise has been undertaken as part of the 
EIA and the findings are presented in the ES (Document Reference 6.1).  The 
noise assessment states that no likely significant effects are anticipated from 
noise as a result of the construction, operation or decommissioning of the 
Project. 
NPPG 
6.3.21 
The NPPG resource provides planning guidance in respect of a number of 
topics, including: air quality, design, flood risk and coastal change, natural 
environment, noise, renewable and low carbon energy, and water supply, 
wastewater and water quality.  Relevant NPPG guidance, correct as at 
February 2015, is set out below. 
6.3.22 
Paragraph 001 of guidance relating to air quality advises that air quality, 
odour and dust can be a planning concern because of the effect on 
biodiversity and local amenity.  Accordingly, assessments could include a 
description of baseline conditions, the assessment methods to be adopted 
and acceptable mitigation measures (paragraph 007).  The impacts of air 
quality could be mitigated through the design and layout of development, the 
use of green infrastructure, and controlling dust and emissions from 
construction, operation and demolition (paragraph 008). 
6.3.23 
In accordance with the above NPPG guidance, a full assessment has been 
undertaken of the potential emissions resulting from the construction, 
operation and decommissioning of the Power Generation Plant, electrical 
connection and gas connection and is recorded in Chapter 6 of the ES 
(Document Reference 6.1), together with appropriate mitigation measures.  
The assessment included consideration of the closest residential dwelling to 
the Power Generation Plant Site at South Pillinge Farm, located 
135 
 
approximately 130 m to the west of the Project Site.  A Statement of 
Engagement of Section 79(1) of the Environmental Protection Act 1990 
(Document Reference 5.5) has also been prepared – fulfilling regulation 
5(2)(f) of the AFFP Regulations – to assess the condition of the site, potential 
air quality impacts, noise levels, artificial lighting and health effects generated 
by the Project throughout its various stages. 
6.3.24 
Chapter 6 of the ES (Document Reference 6.1) states that the main potential 
effects resulting from construction and decommissioning of the Project on air 
quality are from dust and particulate matter generated from construction 
activities; however it is considered unlikely that levels of dust or particulate 
matter would be generated which would constitute a health hazard or 
nuisance to human or ecological receptors in the vicinity of the Project Site, 
including South Pillinge Farm.  Chapter 6 of the ES (Document Reference 
6.1) states that any potential impacts would be minimised through 
implementation of a CEMP, (an outline of which is provided in Appendix 3.2 
of the ES (Document Reference 6.2)) which would incorporate appropriate 
dust mitigation measures such as damping down or covering of stock piles 
and excavations during dry and windy weather.   
6.3.25 
Paragraph 001 of guidance relating to design highlights that good quality 
design is an integral part of sustainable development – “Good design 
responds in a practical and creative way to both the function and identity of 
a place. It puts land, water, drainage, energy, community, economic, 
infrastructure and other such resources to the best possible use – over the 
long as well as the short term.” 
6.3.26 
In accordance with the provisions of this NPPG guidance, MPL has sought 
to adopt good design principles as part of the Project.  The form, scale, 
massing and landscaping has been designed so that the Power Generation 
Plant blends in with its surroundings minimising visual intrusion from key 
viewpoints.  
6.3.27 
As far as is reasonably practical, the Power Generation Plant will use 
materials which can be disposed of sustainably (e.g. easily re-usable or 
recyclable) when the plant has reached the end of its life but primarily have 
been selected for their durability and safety across at least a 25-year lifespan.  
The technology chosen has an inherently low requirement for process water. 
As set out within the Outline Landscaping Plans (Document Reference 2.9), 
the design of landscape planting will enhance the area’s biodiversity through 
the retention of existing woodland; the planting of belts of trees to increase 
the amount of woodland in the area; the reinstatement of planting where 
possible and appropriate; and careful management of soils during 
construction works to facilitate plant growth, to be implemented as part of the 
CEMP.   
6.3.28 
The design evolution is explained in the Design and Access Statement 
(Document Reference 10.2) and also the Consultation Report (Document 
Reference 5.1) which explains carefully each stage of the Project, the nature 
of consultation exercises, the responses received and which influenced the 
design. 
136 
 
6.3.29 
Paragraph 029 of guidance relating to flood risk and coastal change advises 
developers and applicants to consider flood risk to and from the development 
site as early as possible, and to follow the broad approach of assessing, 
avoiding, managing and mitigating flood risk. Paragraph 030 states that a 
site-specific FRA should be carried out to demonstrate “how flood risk will be 
managed now and over the development’s lifetime, taking climate change 
into account, and with regard to the vulnerability of its users.” 
6.3.30 
In accordance with the above NPPG guidance, MPL has considered the 
potential impacts of the Project in respect of flood risk. An FRA (Document 
Reference 5.4) has been prepared and is submitted as part of the DCO 
Application.  The FRA (Document Reference 5.4) has found that there are 
not likely to be any significant impacts resulting from the construction, 
operation and decommissioning of the Power Generation Plant, electrical 
connection and gas connection with regards to flooding.  The Project is not 
located in a coastal region or in close proximity to any tidal rivers and 
therefore consideration of coastal changes, higher temperatures and drought 
is not considered to be required. 
6.3.31 
Paragraph 016 of guidance relating to the natural environment states that the 
potential impacts on biodiversity should inform all stages of development.  
Biodiversity enhancement should seek to include habitat restoration, re-
creation and expansion (paragraph 017). 
6.3.32 
In accordance with the above NPPG guidance, an assessment of the likely 
effects of the Project on site of ecological importance, protected species and 
habitats has been undertaken as part of the EIA and the findings are 
contained within Chapter 8 of the ES (Document Reference 6.1).  The ES 
(Document Reference 6.1) states that no likely significant effects are 
anticipated on ecological receptors as a result of the construction, operation 
or decommissioning of the Project.  
6.3.33 
Paragraph 001 of guidance relating to noise states that “noise needs to be 
considered when new developments may create additional noise and when 
new developments would be sensitive to the prevailing acoustic 
environment.”  Paragraph 008 advises that there are four broad types of 
mitigation: engineering, layout, using planning conditions/obligations and 
mitigating. 
6.3.34 
In accordance with the provisions of the above NPPG guidance, MPL has 
considered the likely impacts of the Project in respect of noise as part of the 
EIA, and the findings are presented in the ES (Document Reference 6.1).  
The assessment finds that no likely significant effects are anticipated from 
noise as a result of the construction, operation or decommissioning of the 
Project.  Further, no cumulative effects are likely to arise in relation to the 
Project and other projects in respect of noise and vibration during 
construction, decommissioning or operation. 
6.3.35 
Paragraph 016 of guidance relating to water supply, wastewater and water 
quality states that a detailed assessment will be required where it is likely that 
137 
 
a proposal will have a significant adverse impact on water quality.  The 
assessment should form part of an Environmental Statement. 
6.3.36 
In accordance with the provisions of the above NPPG guidance, an 
assessment of the likely effects on water quality and resources associated 
with the proposed development has been undertaken in the EIA and the 
findings are presented in Chapter 9 of the ES (Document Reference 6.1).  
The assessment finds that no likely significant effects are anticipated on 
water quality and resources or from flooding as a result of the construction, 
operation or decommissioning of the Project.  Furthermore, it is considered 
that, as explained in Chapter 9 of the ES (Document Reference 6.1), with the 
implementation of embedded mitigation, no likely significant cumulative 
effects will arise between the Project and the other developments. 
Local Planning Policy 
6.3.37 
Section 104(2)(d) of the PA 2008 states that, in determining applications, the 
SoS should have regard to any other matters which are considered to be 
“both important and relevant to the [SoS’s] decision.”  The Project Site falls 
within the jurisdiction of both Central Bedfordshire Council and Bedford 
Borough Council, and therefore other local planning policy which is 
considered to be important and relevant to the DCO Application is contained 
within the following documents (listed chronologically): 
Bedford Borough Council and Central Bedfordshire Council (combined) 
 Bedfordshire and Luton Minerals and Waste Local Plan (2005); and, 
 Bedford Borough, Central Bedfordshire and Luton Borough Council – 
Minerals and Waste Local Plan: Strategic Sites and Policies 
(MWLP:SSP) (adopted 2014); 
Central Bedfordshire Council 
 Central Bedfordshire Core Strategy and Development Management 
Policies (adopted 2009); 
Bedford Borough Council 
 Bedford Borough Local Plan 2002 (adopted 2002) (Saved Policies); 
 Bedford Core Strategy and Rural Issues Plan (adopted 2008); 
Supplementary Local Planning Policy 
 Forest of Marston Vale Plan (FoMVP) 
Emerging Planning Policy 
 Central Bedfordshire Local Plan 2015-2035 (Draft Plan – 2017) 
 
 
138 
 
Bedfordshire and Luton Minerals and Waste Local Plan (2005) and, Bedford 
Borough, Central Bedfordshire and Luton Borough Council – Minerals and 
Waste Local Plan: Strategic Sites and Policies (MWLP:SSP) (2014) 
6.3.38 
As part of the Spatial Strategy for Waste, Policy WSP2 of the MWLP:SSP 
allocates four sites for waste recovery uses, at Elstow North, Land at Former 
Brogborough landfill, Rookery South Pit, and Land at Thorn Turn.  The site 
at Rookery South Pit (107ha), which includes the Project Site, is allocated for 
non-landfill waste management recovery operations and non-hazardous 
landfill, with opportunities for pre-treatment recovery operations prior to 
landfill. 
6.3.39 
Policy W22 of the Bedfordshire and Luton Minerals and Waste Local Plan 
(2005) states that proposed waste management sites will be protected as far 
as practicable from development that may conflict or prejudice their waste 
management use. 
6.3.40 
It is acknowledged that the Project Site is allocated for proposed waste 
management uses by Policy WSP2 of the MWLP:SSP, and thus the Project 
would therefore conflict with Policy WSP2 of the MWLP:SSP and Policy W22 
of the Bedfordshire and Luton Minerals and Waste Local Plan.   
6.3.41 
However, the Project Site is only partially located within Rookery South Pit, 
and that Rookery South Pit is allocated as one of four identified waste 
management sites, and therefore is not to be solely depended upon as a 
strategic waste management site. Furthermore, the urgent need for electricity 
generation, including gas fired generating stations and unabated flexible gas 
and peaking plants, is provided in a range of national government guidance, 
national planning policy as well as local planning policy (as set out within 
section 4 of this report), including NPS EN-1, the Gas Generation Strategy 
(DECC, 2012) and the National Infrastructure Plan (HM Treasury, 2014).  It 
is also acknowledged that, by virtue of this allocation, the principle of the 
development of the Project Site is considered acceptable. 
6.3.42 
Section 104 of the PA 2008 provides that in making decisions on applications, 
the SoS must decide applications in accordance with relevant NPS(s) unless 
the adverse impacts of the proposal would outweigh its benefits (or in certain 
other limited circumstances).  Furthermore, paragraph 3.1.3 of NPS EN-1 
states that all development consent applications for energy infrastructure 
should be assessed ‘on the basis that the Government has demonstrated 
that there is a need for those types of infrastructure and that the scale and 
urgency of that need is as described for each of them in this Part.’  
Accordingly, the SoS ‘should give substantial weight to the contribution 
which projects would make towards satisfying this need when considering 
applications for development consent under the Planning Act 2008’ 
(paragraph 3.1.4) [emphasis added]. 
6.3.43 
Whilst the Project conflicts with the provisions of Policy WSP2 of the 
MWLP:SSP and Policy W22 of the Bedfordshire and Luton Minerals and 
Waste Local Plan; given the need to determine NSIPs primarily in 
accordance with relevant NPSs, and the substantial weight that should be 
139 
 
applied to energy infrastructure applications set out in NPS EN-1, the Project 
should be weighed favourably in balance of the DCO Application. 
Central Bedfordshire Core Strategy and Development Management Policies 
(adopted 2009) 
6.3.44 
The Project Site is located on the edge of the Northern Marston Vale Strategic 
Area, as identified on the Central Bedfordshire Core Strategy and 
Development Management Policies Key Diagram.  The Spatial Vision for the 
Core Strategy states that the Northern Marston Vale will ‘continue to be a 
growth location where development will help to bring about environmental 
regeneration, support the urban renaissance of Bedford and make the Vale 
a more attractive place to live, do business and enjoy leisure time’ (page 16).  
Further, Policy CS1 of the Core Strategy and Development Management 
Policies document states that sites within Northern Marston Vale will be 
identified and developed for new homes, jobs and key infrastructure. 
6.3.45 
As set out in Chapter 14 of the ES (Document Reference 6.1), there are likely 
to be minor beneficial effects from investment and job creation at all stages 
of the Project, and therefore the Project will contribute to the status of the 
Northern Marston Vale as a growth location as set out in Policy CS1 of the 
Core Strategy and Development Management Policies document. 
6.3.46 
Policy CS9 of the Central Bedfordshire Core Strategy and Development 
Management Policies (2009) states that the Council will plan for a minimum 
target of 17,000 net additional jobs in the district over the period 2001-2026.  
This target will be supported through the provision of 10–20 ha of new 
employment land within Northern Marston Vale, as required by Policy CS10.  
6.3.47 
The Project will contribute to the provisions of Policy CS9 of the Central 
Bedfordshire Core Strategy and Development Management Policies (2009), 
as explained in Chapter 14 of the ES (Document Reference 6.1).  The Project 
will have slight positive effects on the socio-economic status of the area 
during construction through both employment creation and capital 
expenditure and worker spending in the local economy, as set out in Chapter 
14 of the ES (Document Reference 6.1).  It is anticipated that up to 122 
construction workers would be required at the Project Site during peak 
periods at any one time. Project construction would support up to nine 
permanent full time equivalent construction jobs. Further, Chapter 14 of the 
ES (Document Reference 6.1) states that construction, decommissioning 
and operation of the Project could occur simultaneously with other projects 
in the vicinity of the Project Site. 
6.3.48 
The Project Site is located within the floodplain as illustrated on the Central 
Bedfordshire LDF (North) Proposals Map, where Core Strategy Policy CS13 
applies.  Policy CS13 states that the Council will seek to minimise the risk of 
flooding and manage residual risks, as well as securing new development 
which incorporates measures to take account of climate change.  Policy 
CS13 also states that energy generating proposals with low carbon impact 
will be considered positively. 
140 
 
6.3.49 
In respect of Policy CS13, an FRA (Document Reference 5.4) has been 
undertaken and is submitted as part of the DCO Application. The FRA 
(Document Reference 5.4) has found that there are not likely to be any 
significant impacts resulting from the construction, operation and 
decommissioning of the Power Generation Plant, electrical connection and 
gas connection with regards to flooding.   
6.3.50 
Policy CS14 states that the Council will require development to be of the 
highest quality by, inter alia, respecting local context and the varied character 
and local distinctiveness of Mid Bedfordshire. 
6.3.51 
In accordance with the provisions of Policy CS14, MPL has sought to adopt 
good design principles from the outset of the Project such that the 
development is sensitive to its setting and is of a good aesthetic as possible.  
As illustrated in the Design and Access Statement (Document Reference 
10.2), the form, scale, massing and landscaping has been designed so that 
the Power Generation Plant blends in with its surroundings minimising visual 
intrusion from key viewpoints. Furthermore, significant areas of planting are 
proposed within the Project Site.   
6.3.52 
Notwithstanding this, as set out within Chapter 11 of the ES (Document 
Reference 6.1), the Project has the potential to affect the landscape and 
people’s views and visual amenity due to the processes involved in 
construction (e.g. ground clearance, use of large plant) and operation from 
the introduction of new large structures into the landscape (e.g. the stack of 
the Generating Equipment and SECs associated with the Electrical 
Connection).  In this respect, the Project has the potential to conflict with the 
provisions of Policy CS14, in regards to the impact of the Project on the local 
character.  However, the Project will be largely screened from views by the 
fact that a large proportion is sited within the Rookery South Pit (meaning 
that only 17.5 - 20 m of the stack will be visible above the edge of the pit), 
and the Project will also be viewed in the context of other industrial 
development such as large towers of the former London Brick Works, the 
existing Sundon to Grendon overhead line and towers and the wind turbine 
at the Millennium Country Park. 
6.3.53 
The Project Site is located within the Forest of Marston Vale as illustrated on 
the LDF North Proposals Map, where Core Strategy Policy CS16 applies.  
Policy CS16 states that the Council will: 
 Conserve and enhance the varied countryside character and local 
distinctiveness; 
 Resist development where it will have an adverse effect on important 
landscape features or highly sensitive landscapes; 
 Require development to enhance landscapes of lesser quality; 
 Continue to support the creation of the Forest of Marston Vale; 
141 
 
 Conserve woodlands including ancient and semi natural woodland, 
hedgerows and veteran trees; and 
 Promote an increase in tree cover outside of the Forest of Marston 
Vale, where it would not threaten other valuable habitats. 
6.3.54 
Further, Core Strategy Policy CS17 states that the Council will: 
 Seek a net gain in green infrastructure through the protection and 
enhancement of assets and the provision of new green spaces; 
 Take forward priority areas for the provision of new green 
infrastructure in the Forest of Marston Vale; and 
 Require new development to contribute towards the delivery of new 
green infrastructure and the management of a linked network of new 
and enhanced open spaces and corridors. 
6.3.55 
The Project Site is part-located within a County Wildlife Site (CWS) as 
illustrated on the Central Bedfordshire LDF (North) Proposals Map, where 
Core Strategy Policy CS18 applies.  Policy CS18 states that the Council will 
support the designation, management and protection of biodiversity and 
geology, including locally important CWS’s. Development that would 
fragment or prejudice the biodiversity network will not be permitted. 
6.3.56 
In respect of Policy CS18 of the Core Strategy, an assessment of the likely 
effects of the Project on site of ecological importance, protected species and 
habitats has been undertaken as part of the EIA and the findings are 
contained within Chapter 8 of the ES (Document Reference 6.1).  The ES 
(Document Reference 6.1) states that no likely significant effects are 
anticipated on ecological receptors as a result of the construction, operation 
or decommissioning of the Project.  In this regard, the Project respects the 
designation of the Project Site as a County Wildlife Site. 
6.3.57 
Policy DM3 requires that all proposals for new development will, inter alia, be 
appropriate in scale and design to their setting, and respect local 
distinctiveness through design and use of materials. 
6.3.58 
In accordance with the provisions of Policy DM3, MPL has sought to adopt 
good design principles from the outset of the Project such that the 
development is sensitive to its setting and is of a good aesthetic as possible.  
As illustrated in the Design and Access Statement (Document Reference 
10.2), the indicative form, scale, massing and landscaping has been 
designed so that the Power Generation Plant blends in with its surroundings, 
minimising visual intrusion from key viewpoints.   
6.3.59 
Notwithstanding this, as set out within Chapter 11 of the ES (Document 
Reference 6.1), the Project has the potential to affect the landscape and 
people’s views and visual amenity due to the processes involved in 
construction (e.g. ground clearance, use of large plant) and operation from 
the introduction of new large structures into the landscape (e.g. the stack of 
142 
 
the Generating Equipment and SECs associated with the Electrical 
Connection).  In this respect, the Project has the potential to conflict with the 
provisions of Policy DM3, in regards to the impact of the scale of the Project 
on the local setting.  However, the Project will be largely screened from views 
by the fact that a large proportion is sited within the Rookery South Pit 
(meaning that only 17.5-20 m of the stack will be visible above the edge of 
the pit), and the Project will also be viewed in the context of other industrial 
development such as large towers of the former London Brick Works, the 
existing Sundon to Grendon overhead line and towers and the wind turbine 
at the Millennium Country Park. 
6.3.60 
The Project Site is located within the Forest of Marston Vale as illustrated on 
the LDF North Proposals Map, where Core Strategy Policy DM14 applies.  
Policy DM14 states that the Council will ensure that the impact of proposed 
development on the landscape will be assessed.  Proposals for development 
within the Northern Marston Vale and the Forest of Marston Vale will be 
required to provide landscape enhancement on or adjacent to the 
development site or contribute towards landscape enhancement in these 
areas.  Trees, woodland and hedgerows in the district will be protected by 
requiring developers to retain and protect such features in close proximity to 
building works.  Furthermore, tree planting or contributions towards planting 
for the purposes of enhancing the landscape will be sought from new 
developments. 
6.3.61 
MPL has had regard to the provisions of relevant planning guidance set out 
above, relating to the Forest of Marston Vale, in the design of the Project, 
and accordingly has considered opportunities for landscape enhancement 
across the Project Site, as detailed with the ES (Document Reference 6.1) 
and Design and Access Statement (Document Reference 10.2).  MPL 
acknowledges CBC’s target of achieving 30% woodland cover in the Forest 
area by 2030, but notes that there is not a requirement for developers to 
provide a specific proportion of land towards this target.  Notwithstanding this, 
MPL are proposing a significant area of planting within the Project Site, in line 
with the above target. 
Bedford Borough Local Plan 2002 (adopted 2002) (Saved Policies) 
6.3.62 
Saved Bedford Borough Local Plan (2002) Policy NE3 states that 
development will not be permitted that may directly or indirectly destroy or 
adversely affect a County Wildlife Site or Regionally Important Geological 
Site. 
6.3.63 
In respect of saved Policy NE3 of the Bedford Borough Local Plan, an 
assessment of the likely effects of the Project on site of ecological 
importance, protected species and habitats has been undertaken as part of 
the EIA and the findings are contained within Chapter 8 of the ES (Document 
Reference 6.1).  The ES (Document Reference 6.1) states that no likely 
significant effects are anticipated on ecological receptors as a result of the 
construction, operation or decommissioning of the Project.  In this regard, the 
Project respects the designation of the Project Site as a County Wildlife Site.

6.3.64 
Policy CP10 of the Bedford Core Strategy and Rural Issues Plan (2008) 
states that ‘a minimum of 16,000 net additional jobs will be provided in the 
borough by 2021’, and Policy CP11 states that up to 75ha of additional 
employment land will be provided in the period 2001-2021. 
6.3.65 
The Project will contribute to the provisions of Policy CP10 of the Bedford 
Core Strategy and Rural Issues Plan (2008), as explained in Chapter 14 of 
the ES (Document Reference 6.1). The Project will have slight positive effects 
on the socio-economic status of the area during construction through both 
employment creation and capital expenditure and worker spending in the 
local economy, as set out in Chapter 14 of the ES (Document Reference 6.1).  
It is anticipated that up to 122 construction workers would be required at the 
Project Site during peak periods at any one time. Project construction would 
support up to nine permanent full time equivalent construction jobs. Further, 
Chapter 14 of the ES (Document Reference 6.1) states that construction, 
decommissioning and operation of the Project could occur simultaneously 
with other projects in the vicinity of the Project Site. 
6.3.66 
Policy CP21 advises that all new development should, inter alia, be of the 
highest design quality, fully consider the wider context and address 
sustainable design principles.  Policy CP24 states that ‘The Marston Vale will 
be the focus for landscape enhancement and restoration and the council will 
continue to support the Forest of Marston Vale.’  New development should 
protect and where appropriate enhance the quality and character of the 
landscape. 
6.3.67 
In accordance with the provisions of Policy CP21 and CP24, MPL has sought 
to adopt good design principles from the outset of the Project such that the 
development is sensitive to its setting.  As illustrated in the Design and 
Access Statement (Document Reference 10.2), the indicative form, scale, 
massing and landscaping has been designed so that the Power Generation 
Plant blends in with its surroundings minimising visual intrusion from key 
viewpoints.    
6.3.68 
Notwithstanding this, as set out within Chapter 11 of the ES (Document 
Reference 6.1), the Project has the potential to affect the landscape and 
people’s views and visual amenity due to the processes involved in 
construction (e.g. ground clearance, use of large plant) and operation from 
the introduction of new large structures into the landscape (e.g. the stack of 
the Generating Equipment and SECs associated with the Electrical 
Connection).  In this respect, the Project has the potential to conflict with the 
provisions of Policies CP21 and CP24, in regards to the impact of the Project 
on the quality and character of the landscape.  However, the Project will be 
largely screened from views by the fact that a large proportion is sited within 
the Rookery South Pit (meaning that only 17.5-20 m of the stack will be visible 
above the edge of the pit), and the Project will also be viewed in the context 
of other industrial development such as large towers of the former London 
Brick Works, the existing Sundon to Grendon overhead line and towers and 
the wind turbine at the Millennium Country Park. 
144 
 
Forest of Marston Vale Plan (FoMVP) 
6.3.69 
The Project Site is located within the Forest of Marston Vale and therefore 
the FoMVP provides planning guidance of relevance to the Project. The 
FoMVP was published as non-statutory planning guidance by Marston Vale 
Trust in 2000, in order to guide the creation of the Forest of Marston Vale as 
a Community Forest.   
6.3.70 
The Project Site is located within the Brickfields Landscape Zone of the 
Forest of Marston Vale.  The FoMVP notes that the Brickfields Landscape 
Zone “is the core area is the core area of the Vale where there is a need to 
secure a higher level of new planting than elsewhere in the Community 
Forest”, in order to offer landscape, wildlife, recreation and amenity benefits 
(page 16).  Proposals for the Brickfields Landscape Zone include: “The Team 
will work with landowners to secure a higher proportion of woodland planting 
in this area than the more agriculturally productive land to either side of the 
Vale. All land types will need to be targeted to deliver the level of planting 
needed and landscape impacts of project work will need to be assessed from 
both the Vale floor and elevated positions on the ridges” (page 17). 
6.3.71 
The FoMVP also provides further guidance in respect of woodland creation 
and tree planting.  Page 21 of the FoMVP notes that, “Tree planting is the 
core objective of the Community Forest with the new woodland providing a 
setting for a wide range of other activities.  Significant areas of tree planting 
will be secured towards the 30% target, with the core Brickfields and urban 
fringe zones being targeted for the highest proportion of tree planting. 
Reduced tree cover will be sought on the land to the east and west.”  
Furthermore, in this regard, the FoMVP continues, that, “Opportunities 
offered through the restoration of landfill and derelict sites and planning 
agreements offer the greatest future prospects for large scale woodland 
creation” (page 21) 
6.3.72 
The FoMVP states that woodland creation and tree planting will be achieved  
through a number of means, including: 
 “implementing an annual programme of tree planting towards realising 
the long-term aim of 30% woodland cover in the Vale over a 40 year 
period.  Joint working with landowners and organisations such as the 
Woodland Trust, local authorities and Forestry Commission will be 
promoted;” 
 “promoting well designed new woodlands, as a resource, to deliver a 
wide range of landscape, economic, social and environmental 
benefits. Particular emphasis will be placed on securing larger 
woodlands (>20 ha) and those that meet defragmentation, urban 
fringe and access objectives in accordance with the England Forestry 
Strategy and DETR targets;” 
 “encouraging and supporting landowners to ensure that all new 
woodlands are successfully established and well maintained, and 
developing new services to assist with this, where appropriate;” 
145 
 
 “working with planning authorities to ensure that developments 
provide opportunities to secure large scale new woodland creation in 
appropriate areas;” 
 “working with site owners and planning authorities to ensure that 
restoration schemes for derelict land and landfill sites meet Forest 
landscape, wildlife and recreation objectives;” 
 “seeking opportunities to secure land for woodland creation. This 
could be through acquisition, leasing, management partnerships or 
other suitable mechanisms.” 
6.3.73 
The FoMVP also notes that, “As part of creating the varied and well-wooded 
countryside of the Community Forest, the creation and management of a 
range of habitats other than woodland, such as farmland, grassland, and 
wetland, is important” (page 24).  Accordingly, page 26 of the FoMVP states 
that non-woodland habitats will be managed and created through a number 
of means, including: 
 securing opportunities to maximise the ecological potential of the 
Marston Vale. This work will be done in conjunction with organisations 
such as the Wildlife Trust and English Nature and is to be guided by 
Biodiversity Action Plans where possible; 
 using the Countryside Stewardship Scheme or other means to secure 
new hedgerow planting and enhanced management. Networks of 
well-managed farmland and roadside hedges that link other habitats 
will be developed or strengthened; 
 increasing and conserving areas of ecologically valuable grassland 
within the Community Forest, in partnership with the appropriate site 
owners and managers; 
 promoting the appropriate management and increasing the amount of 
wetland 
habitats 
throughout 
the 
Marston 
Vale, 
including 
watercourses, ponds, lakes and any marsh areas. 
 working with the Wildlife Trust, Bedfordshire County Council, English 
Nature and other partners to ensure that any rare habitats and species 
are conserved and their status enhanced. Sites of Special Scientific 
Interest and County Wildlife Sites will be particularly important in this 
area of work. 
6.3.74 
MPL has had regard to the provisions of relevant planning guidance set out 
above, relating to the Forest of Marston Vale, in the design of the Project, 
and accordingly has considered opportunities for landscape enhancement 
across the Project Site, as detailed with the ES (Document Reference 6.1) 
and Design and Access Statement (Document Reference 10.2).  MPL 
acknowledges CBC’s target of achieving 30% woodland cover in the Forest 
area by 2030, but notes that there is not a requirement for developers to 
provide a specific proportion of land towards this target.  Notwithstanding this, 
146 
 
MPL are proposing a significant area of planting within the Project Site, in line 
with the above target. 
Central Bedfordshire Local Plan 2015-2035 (Draft Plan – 2017) 
6.3.75 
MPL has had regard to the Central Bedfordshire Draft Local Plan during the 
assessment of the Project. However, it is noted that the Draft Local Plan is 
still at the early stages of development and has yet to go through Examination 
in Public. The weight which can be attributed to the draft policies set out in 
this document is therefore limited at this stage. 
6.3.76 
Notwithstanding the above, there are no clear conflicts with the draft policies 
set out in the Draft Local Plan. 
6.4 
Interpretation of Planning Assessment 
6.4.1 
Section 104 of the PA 2008 provides that in making decisions on applications, 
the SoS must have regard (amongst certain other documents and matters) 
to any relevant NPS and must decide applications in accordance with such 
relevant NPS(s) unless the adverse impacts of the proposal would outweigh 
its benefits (or in certain other limited circumstances).   
6.4.2 
Section 104 of the PA 2008 also requires the SoS to have regard to any Local 
Impact Report and other matters which the SoS “thinks are both important 
and relevant to [the SoS’s] decision”.   
6.4.3 
As demonstrated above in section 6 of this Planning Statement, the Project 
complies with all provisions of relevant NPS guidance contained within NPS 
EN-1, NPS EN-2, NPS EN-4 and NPS EN-5.  The Project therefore needs to 
be balanced against whether any adverse impacts of the proposal would 
outweigh its benefits.  As explained above and in the ES (Document 
Reference 6.1), some adverse impacts may occur as a result of the Project, 
however likely impacts have been minimised wherever possible through 
appropriate specification, siting and design.  As such, no adverse residual 
impacts are anticipated as a result of the Project. 
6.4.4 
It is acknowledged that the Project Site is allocated in the Development Plan 
(Policy W22 of the Bedfordshire and Luton Minerals and Waste Local Plan 
(2005)) for waste management use, and therefore the Project will to some 
extent conflict with the proposed allocated use. However, it is acknowledged 
that the Project Site is only partially located within Rookery South Pit, and 
that Rookery South Pit is allocated as one of four identified waste 
management sites, and therefore is not to be solely depended upon as a 
strategic waste management site.  It is also acknowledged that, by virtue of 
this allocation, the principle of the development of the Project Site is 
considered acceptable. 
6.4.5 
However, as the Project is an NSIP for energy infrastructure, the Project 
should be considered primarily in accordance with NPS guidance.  
Furthermore, paragraph 3.1.3 of NPS EN-1 states that all development 
consent applications for energy infrastructure should be assessed ‘on the 
147 
 
basis that the Government has demonstrated that there is a need for those 
types of infrastructure and that the scale and urgency of that need is as 
described for each of them in this Part.’   
6.4.6 
In light of the Project’s compliance with all relevant NPS guidance and the 
identified urgent need for energy infrastructure set out within NPS EN-1, the 
planning balance should be weighed in favour of the DCO Application.  In this 
respect, paragraph 3.1.4 of NPS EN-1 states that the SoS ‘should give 
substantial weight to the contribution which projects would make towards 
satisfying this need when considering applications for development consent 
under the Planning Act 2008’. 
148

Likely Benefits and Disbenefits 
7.1 
Introduction 
7.1.1 
Section 104(3) of the PA 2008 provides that "[t]he [Secretary of State] must 
decide the application in accordance with any relevant national policy 
statement, except to the extent that one or more of subsections (4) to (8) 
applies."  Section 104(7) of the PA 2008 provides that: "[t]his subsection 
applies if the [Secretary of State] is satisfied that the adverse impact of the 
proposed development would outweigh its benefits".   
7.1.2 
Section 6 of this Planning Statement explained the extent to which the Project 
complies with the relevant NPSs as well as other matters which the SoS may 
consider to be both important and relevant to his or her decision on the 
Project.  In accordance with section 104(7) of the PA 2008, this section 
considers and weighs up the potential adverse impacts and the likely benefits 
of the Project. 
7.2 
Potential Adverse Impacts 
7.2.1 
NPS EN-1 and EN-2 identify that fossil fuel generating stations are expected 
to have adverse impacts in relation to: air quality and emissions, biodiversity 
and geological conservation, flood risk, the historic environment, landscape 
and visual amenity, land use/land take, noise and vibration, socio-economics, 
traffic and transport, waste, and water quality and resources. 
7.2.2 
Some of these adverse impacts may occur as a result of this Project, as set 
out in the ES (Document Reference 6.1) and summarised below: 
 Based on a conservative, worst case assessment, where numerous 
large plant items are operating simultaneously across the Project Site, 
the significance of the overall effect of construction and 
decommissioning noise from the Project is predicted to be slight 
adverse for the Electrical Connection and slight adverse for the Gas 
Connection (see Chapter 7 of the ES (Document Reference 6.1)); 
 The Project has the potential to affect the landscape and people’s 
views and visual amenity due to the processes involved in construction 
(e.g. ground clearance, use of large plant) and operation from the 
introduction of new large structures into the landscape (e.g. the stack 
of the Generating Equipment and SECs associated with the Electrical 
Connection) (see Chapter 11 of the ES (Document Reference 6.1)); 
and 
 During operation, the introduction of the stack associated with the 
Generating Equipment has the potential to have minor adverse effects 
on surrounding cultural heritage assets such as listed buildings (see 
Chapter 13 of the ES (Document Reference 6.1)). 
149 
 
7.2.3 
However, the likely impacts have been minimised wherever possible, and 
other effects avoided through appropriate specification, siting and design. 
7.2.4 
The overall effect of construction and decommissioning noise from the 
Project will not be significant following the implementation of embedded 
mitigation measures, including an appropriately placed acoustic screen, 
adoption of a CEMP and inherent best practice plant design incorporating 
acoustic enclosures (see Chapter 7 of the ES (Document Reference 6.1)).  
The impact of the Project on land used for the SECs and AGI will not be 
significant following the implementation of best working methods, limiting 
working width and reinstating the route with topsoil (see Chapter 10 of the 
ES (Document Reference 6.1)). 
7.2.5 
Landscape planting, as set out within the Landscape and Ecology Mitigation 
and Management Strategy (LEMMS) (Appendix 11.3 of the ES, Document 
Reference 6.2) will be implemented in order to mitigate the impact of the 
Project on landscape and visual amenity and the setting of designated 
heritage assets and to assist in meeting CBC and FoMVP targets.  
Furthermore, as explained in Chapter 11 of the ES (Document Reference 
6.1), the Project will be largely screened from views by the fact that a large 
proportion is sited within the Rookery South Pit (meaning that only 17.5-20 
m of the stack will be visible above the edge of the pit), and the Project will 
also be viewed in the context of other industrial development such as large 
towers of the former London Brick Works, the existing Sundon to Grendon 
overhead line and towers and the wind turbine at the Millennium Country 
Park.   
7.2.6 
No mitigation measures are proposed in relation to the impact of the stack on 
the settings of designated heritage assets, as the stack will form part of a 
landscape that already contains a number of significant tall industrial 
structures.  The height of the stack will appear to be significantly lower than 
these structures and will not be out of keeping with the existing setting of the 
designated heritage assets (see Chapter 13 of the ES (Document Reference 
6.1)). 
7.2.7 
The Project Site is allocated for proposed waste management uses by Policy 
WSP2 of the MWLP:SSP, and thus the Project would therefore conflict with 
Policy WSP2 of the MWLP:SSP and Policy W22 of the Bedfordshire and 
Luton Minerals and Waste Local Plan, and potentially prejudice the use of 
the site for allocated waste management uses. However, the Project Site is 
only partially located within Rookery South Pit, and that Rookery South Pit is 
allocated as one of four identified waste management sites, and therefore is 
not to be solely depended upon as a strategic waste management site.   
7.2.8 
Whilst some adverse impacts are likely, they are largely of a nature that are 
inherently likely for fossil fuel generating stations, and as such anticipated in 
policy (particularly NPS EN-2) and have been anticipated by the Applicant 
and assessed throughout the pre-application process and extensive 
consultation processes. This has allowed appropriate siting, specification and 
design to provide appropriate mitigation and ensure that the impacts are not 
significant.  Conflict with Policy WSP2 of the MWLP:SSP should be weighed 
150 
 
against national policy contained within NPS EN-1 and the urgent need 
identified for energy infrastructure 
7.3 
Likely Benefits 
7.3.1 
Balanced against the potential adverse impacts outlined above, there are 
important benefits that need to be weighed appropriately. 
7.3.2 
Considerable weight needs to be attributed to the urgent need for energy 
generation, including gas fired generating stations and gas fired peaking 
plants, are provided in NPS EN-1, the Gas Generation Strategy (DECC, 
2012), and the National Infrastructure Plan (HM Treasury, 2014).  
7.3.3 
The construction period is estimated to last 22 months from Q1 2020 to Q4 
2022, and is expected to be operational by 2022. The Project would, 
therefore, contribute materially to the immediate and medium term needs for 
flexible, reliable, peak load power generation and facilitate the transition to a 
low carbon economy.  
7.3.4 
The chosen technology for a peaking plant would help to ‘balance out’ the 
grid at times of peak electricity demand and help to support the grid at times 
when intermittent renewable sources cannot generate electricity. 
7.3.5 
Besides this considerable public benefit, there would be benefits to the site 
and its locality. The construction and operation of the Project would benefit 
the local economy. The Project will deliver positive impacts through 
employment creation in construction, operation and decommissioning 
stages; and supply chain linkages for goods and services and workers 
spending in the local economy. 
7.3.6 
The number of construction workers onsite ranges from 25 to 122 at any 
given time during the peak construction period. 
7.3.7 
GVA is a measure of the value of goods and services produced in an area, 
industry or sector of an economy. Annual construction GVA per head in the 
East of England is £69,625. The construction phase will deliver £6.4 million 
GVA to the wider economy annually, as recorded within Chapter 14 of the 
ES (Document Reference 6.1). 
7.3.8 
The operational phase of the Project would provide up to 10 FTE direct jobs.  
The net effect, taking account of leakage, displacement and the multiplier 
effect would be 9.4 additional regional FTE jobs and 5.5 national FTE jobs. 
Average GVA per utility employee in East of England is £90,071. Assuming 
Project related employment generated average levels of GVA, the Project’s 
operation would provide approximately £0.85m GVA and £0.5m GVA per 
annum to the local and national economy respectively.   
7.4 
Summary 
7.4.1 
Paragraph 4.1.3 of NPS EN-1 explains that the SoS will weigh up a 
proposal’s contribution to meeting the need for energy infrastructure, job 
creation and other long term and wider benefits, against the potential adverse 
151 
 
impacts of the proposal in question including ‘any long-term and cumulative 
adverse impacts, as well as any measures to avoid, reduce or compensate 
for any adverse impacts.’ 
7.4.2 
In respect of paragraph 4.1.3 of NPS EN-1, the potential adverse impacts 
and the likely benefits of the Project are set out above at sections 7.2 and 7.3 
of this Planning Statement. 
7.4.3 
The Project is likely to result in adverse impacts in respect of construction 
and decommissioning noise, land-take for the SECs and the AGI, and effects 
on landscape and visual amenity and surrounding cultural heritage assets 
(see ES (Document Reference 6.1)).  However, the implementation of 
embedded mitigation measures such as the adoption of a CEMP, inherent 
best practice plant design, best working methods and landscape planting will 
ensure that any adverse impacts are not significant (see ES (Document 
Reference 6.1)). 
7.4.4 
The Project would conflict with the allocation of the site in Policy WSP2 of the 
MWLP:SSP for waste management uses; however, in accordance with 
section 104 of the PA 2008 and NPS EN-1, this should be weighed against 
national policy contained within NPS EN-1 and the urgent need identified for 
energy infrastructure, in particular paragraph 3.1.4 of NPS EN-1 which states 
the SoS ‘should give substantial weight to the contribution which projects 
would make towards satisfying [the urgent need for energy infrastructure] this 
need when considering applications for development consent under the 
Planning Act 2008’.  Furthermore, it is acknowledged that the principle of 
development at the Project Site is effectively considered acceptable by virtue 
of this allocation, and it is noted that Rookery South Pit is one of four identified 
waste management sites within the MWLP:SSP, and therefore is not to be 
solely depended upon as a strategic waste management site.   
7.4.5 
There are a number of benefits associated with the Project, including the 
material contribution of the Project towards the urgent need for flexible, 
reliable, peak load power generation and supporting the transition to a low 
carbon economy.  Furthermore, the Project will deliver positive impacts 
through 
employment 
creation 
in 
construction, 
operation 
and 
decommissioning stages; and supply chain linkages for goods and services 
and workers spending in the local economy.  The operational phase of the 
Project would provide an estimated 10 FTE direct jobs.  The net effect, taking 
account of leakage, displacement and the multiplier effect would be 9.4 
additional regional FTE jobs and 5.5 national FTE jobs. Average GVA per 
utility employee in East of England is £90,071. Assuming Project related 
employment generated average levels of GVA, the Project’s operation would 
provide approximately £0.85m GVA and £0.5m GVA per annum to the local 
and national economy respectively.   
7.4.6 
Paragraph 3.1.3 of NPS EN-1 states that all development consent 
applications for energy infrastructure should be assessed ‘on the basis that 
the Government has demonstrated that there is a need for those types of 
infrastructure and that the scale and urgency of that need is as described for 
each of them in this Part.’  Accordingly, the SoS ‘should give substantial 
152 
 
weight to the contribution which projects would make towards satisfying this 
need when considering applications for development consent under the 
Planning Act 2008’ (paragraph 3.1.4, NPS EN-1). 
7.4.7 
Given the need for energy infrastructure as identified in paragraphs 3.1.3 and 
3.1.4 of NPS EN-1, it is considered that the Project would contribute 
materially towards meeting the national need for energy infrastructure. 
153

Conclusions 
8.1 
Summary 
8.1.1 
The urgent need for electricity generation, including gas fired generating 
8.1.1stations and unabated flexible gas and peaking plants, is provided in 
NPS EN-1, the Gas Generation Strategy (DECC, 2012) and the National 
Infrastructure Plan (HM Treasury, 2014). The Project would contribute 
materially to meeting this need. 
8.1.2 
Due regard has been paid to all relevant and important considerations. These 
include the findings of community and statutory consultation processes 
which, as documented in the Consultation Report (Document Reference 5.1), 
have influenced considerations as to the design and siting of the Project.  
Local economic development and environmental policy designations have 
been considered in the design, siting and mitigation proposals within the 
Project. 
8.1.3 
The Project will achieve the relevant objectives of the applicable National 
Policy Statements, being NPS EN-1, NPS EN-2, NPS EN-4 and NPS EN-5.  
Considerations as to siting, Habitats and Species Regulations, alternatives, 
good design, consideration of Combined Heat and Power, grid and gas 
connections, safety, health, nuisance and security, amongst other matters, 
have been given due regard as demonstrated in the ES (Document 
Reference 6.1) and its appendices (Document Reference 6.2), the Design 
and Access Statement and its appended Design Principles Statement 
(Document Reference 10.2), this Planning Statement (Document Reference 
10.1), the Grid Connection Statement (Document Reference 9.1) and the 
Gas Connection Statement (Document Reference 9.2). The ES (Document 
Reference 6.1) has also assessed all relevant likely significant environmental 
effects and has proposed appropriate mitigation wherever feasible. This is to 
be secured through compliance with various submitted documents and 
further approvals such as under the proposed requirements attached to the 
draft DCO (see Schedule 2 to the draft DCO, Document Reference 3.1). 
8.1.4 
It is considered that, on balance, the likely benefits of the Project significantly 
outweigh any potential adverse impacts of the Project. These benefits include 
(amongst others), the local and regional economic benefits, and the 
considerable public benefit to meeting the national need for flexible electricity 
generation. 
8.1.5 
The development of the Project, a dedicated gas fired peaking plant and 
electrical and gas connections, would allow for the rapid, reliable and viable 
provision of reserve capacity to the National Grid, supporting the transition to 
a low carbon economy by balancing some of the considerable scale of 
intermittent sources such as wind being developed UK-wide, and playing an 
important role in meeting the UK’s national energy requirements.  The Project 
would therefore deliver significant national benefits. 
154 
 
8.1.6 
In this respect, the Project should be considered in light of paragraph 3.1.4 
of NPS EN-1, which states that,“[t]he [SoS] should give substantial weight to 
the contribution which projects would make towards satisfying [the urgent 
need for energy infrastructure] when considering applications for 
development consent under the Planning Act 2008”. 
8.1.7 
The Applicant has maintained dialogue throughout the pre-application period 
with local authorities, political representatives and other consultees and 
regulators, and will continue to do so at all relevant stages prior to the 
operation of the Project, if the Order is made. 
8.1.8 
There are considered to be no likely significant effects in respect of sites 
designated under the Habitats Directive as set out in the No Significant 
Effects Report (Document Reference 5.7), nor species protected thereunder 
as set out in the ES (Document Reference 6.1, Chapter 8). 
8.1.9 
Paragraph 4.1.2 of NPS EN-1 confirms a presumption in favour of granting 
consent to applications for energy NSIPs. That presumption applies unless 
any more specific and relevant policies set out in the relevant NPSs clearly 
indicate that consent should be refused. It is the Applicant’s view that there 
are no other policy reasons why consent should be withheld. The Applicant 
does not consider that there are any other important or relevant 
considerations including the relevant National Planning Policy Framework 
(NPPF) or local development plan policies which require an alternative 
position to be taken. 
8.1.10 
It is our conclusion that, having regard to the requirements of section 104 of 
the PA 2008 there is a compelling case in the public interest for the Order to 
be made in the terms proposed.

MILLBROOK POWER PROJECT AND THE ROOKERY 
SOUTH RESOURCE RECOVERY FACILITY 
DEVELOPMENT CONSENT ORDER (DCO) 
 
1. 
Overview 
1.1 
Millbrook Power Limited ("MPL") is promoting a gas fired power station 
of up to 299MW along with associated development of electrical and 
gas connections in Rookery South Pit in Bedfordshire (the "MPL 
Project").   Consent for the MPL Project is being sought by means of a 
Development Consent Order (DCO), a draft of which has been 
submitted with the DCO Application (the “draft MPL DCO”).   
1.2 
Covanta Rookery South Limited ("Covanta") has successfully promoted 
a Resource Recovery Facility (“the RRF Project”) also in Rookery South 
Pit which was granted development consent pursuant to the Planning 
Act 2008 by virtue of the Rookery South (Resource Recovery Facility) 
Order 2011 (the "RRF DCO"). 
1.3 
The MPL Order limits (as defined in the draft MPL DCO (Document 
Reference 3.1) by reference to the Works Plans (Document Reference 
2.6)) are shown coloured green, blue and blue and hatched black on 
the plan appended at Annex 2 and sit within part of the RRF DCO Order 
limits (shown edged red on the plan appended at Annex 2). This means 
that there is an overlap between the two DCOs. 
1.4 
This document seeks to describe the areas of overlap and explains how 
MPL proposes to use the draft MPL DCO to ensure that both schemes 
can be delivered without causing any adverse impacts to the other 
scheme.  
2. 
Status Report 
2.1 
The status of the RRF Project, as of the date of this note, is that it has 
not formally commenced and that pre-commencement RRF DCO 
Requirements are in the process of being discharged. Requirement 1 of 
the RRF DCO states that “the authorised development may commence 
no later than the expiration of 5 years beginning with the date that this 
Order 
comes 
into 
force”. 
Covanta 
must 
therefore 
trigger 
‘commencement’ by 28 February 2018, unless an extension to the time 
limit secured in the RRF DCO is granted. As of the date of this note, no 
application has been made relating to securing an extension to the time 
limit. 
2.2 
It should also be noted that, as of the date of this note, no application to 
make a material or non-material amendment to the RRF DCO has been 
submitted to the Secretary of State via the Planning Inspectorate. 
 
88595265.1\cb57

2.3 
MPL has engaged with Covanta through the course of developing the 
MPL Project. There have been a number of meetings between MPL and 
Covanta where MPL has presented solutions which can be delivered 
through the draft MPL DCO (and the documents that accompany the 
draft MPL DCO), or included in an interface agreement, in order to allow 
both projects to successfully co-exist.  
2.4 
MPL consulted publicly on the MPL Project in May-June and October-
November 2014. On 10 November 2014, Covanta submitted a written 
representation in response to the statutory consultation (a copy of the 
letter is appended at Annex 1). On 10 March 2015, Covanta submitted 
a letter to the Planning Inspectorate stating that Covanta is “committed 
to working with MPL to finalise the management arrangements between 
the two Projects” (a copy of the letter is appended at Annex 1). MPL 
undertook a second round of statutory consultation during May–July 
2017.  Covanta did not formally respond to the second round of 
statutory consultation. MPL understands that Covanta is still committed 
to finalising the management arrangements between the two Projects 
as set out in its letter dated 10 March 2015. 
2.5 
MPL continues to engage with Covanta. It is acknowledged that this 
liaison will continue once the Application has been submitted and 
throughout the Examination process in order to reach agreement on the 
proposed final drafting of the draft MPL DCO and/or an interface 
agreement. 
3. 
Option Agreements 
3.1 
MPL entered into an Option Agreement (dated 14 July 2014) with the 
freehold owner of Rookery South Pit, O&H Q7 Limited ("O&H") (the 
"MPL Option Agreement"). The MPL Option Agreement provides MPL 
with the ability to acquire the freehold and the necessary rights for part 
of the Project Site (including the Generating Equipment Site and 
Substation).  
3.2 
A provision is contained within the MPL Option Agreement that MPL will 
not exercise any powers of compulsory acquisition to acquire land or 
rights from O&H.  
3.3 
Covanta has entered into an Option Agreement with O&H relating to 
land on which consent has been granted to build out the RRF Project 
(the "Covanta Option Agreement"). It is understood that the Covanta 
Option Agreement provides for the RRF Project to be built in a specific 
location. However, the RRF DCO has Limits of Deviation (LoD) which 
extend beyond the land within the Covanta Option Agreement and 
would therefore allow greater flexibility as to the location of certain 
elements of the RRF Project than is permitted under the Covanta 
Option Agreement. These LoD (shown with a dashed blue line on the 
plan appended at Annex 2) are set out on the works plans for the RRF 
Project and are defined in the RRF DCO. 
 
88595265.1\cb57 
3 
3.4 
The MPL Option Agreement and the Covanta Option Agreement do not 
overlap except for the access road leading from Rookery South Pit 
alongside Rookery North Pit to the principal entrance at Green Lane 
which is intended as a joint access road into Rookery South Pit for all 
users of the Pit. 
3.5 
MPL considers that its proposed solution to areas of interaction 
between the two Orders (given that MPL understands there are virtually 
no areas of interaction between the two Option Agreements) reflects the 
terms of the option agreements that both parties have entered into with 
O&H.  
4. 
Potential Interaction 
4.1 
There are key areas of potential interaction between the RRF Project 
and the MPL Project and these can be broken down into four broad 
areas: works packages; Rights of Way; temporary use and other 
statutory powers; and proposed mitigation and enhancement measures. 
These are explained further below. 
4.2 
The RRF DCO contains wide powers of compulsory acquisition which 
have a potential interaction with the Project Site. MPL understands that 
Covanta has sought to exercise these powers of compulsory acquisition 
in respect of specific interests within part of the Project Site. 
5.

5.2 
It is worth noting that MPL has provided for two Access Road Options 
as, in the event that Covanta implements the RRF Project ahead of the 
MPL Project, MPL would simply use the access road constructed for the 
RRF Project and construct a further short section of Access Road (the 
‘Short Access Road’) into the Project Site. If MPL implemented its 
scheme first, then MPL would build the Access Road from the junction 
of Green Lane to the Power Generation Plant Site and, as and when 
the RRF Project came forward, Covanta would simply upgrade the 
relevant parts of that road in accordance with the requirements of the 
RRF DCO.  This is an example of how MPL has designed the MPL 
Project to successfully co-exist with the RRF Project.   
5.3 
The RRF DCO provides consent for the RRF Project to be constructed 
within LoD as set out on the RRF DCO works plans. Comparing the 
RRF DCO LoD against the proposals for the MPL Project, Works 1 and 
2 of the former (the main Electricity Generating Station and post 
combustion MRF area respectively) (shown edged purple on the plan 
appended at Annex 2) and the Generating Equipment and Substation 
(shown coloured blue and hatched black on the plan appended at 
Annex 2) are located in separate areas and will not overlap. As such, 
there is no inconsistency between the key works packages for both 
projects.  
Overlaps between MPL and RRF DCOs 
5.4 
The plan appended at Annex 2 indicates that there is an element of 
physical overlap between the MPL Project Access Road (shown 
coloured green) and the RRF Project LoD for numbered works 1, 2, 3, 
4, 5A, 6A, 7B, 7C and 8B (shown with a dashed blue line). 
MPL Access Road 
5.5 
MPL, in designing its indicative Access Road (see Document Reference 
2.3), has sought to follow the location of the right of way that it has been 
granted by virtue of the MPL Option Agreement. MPL understands that 
the same right of way has been granted for the RRF Project. As such, 
were MPL to construct the Access Road ahead of the RRF Project (i.e. 
Option 2A), MPL’s works would be constructed to dovetail with 
proposed RRF site access. In the event that the RRF was implemented 
 
88595265.1\cb57 
5 
first, the RRF Project would be able to ensure that its access road did 
not cut across its proposals for numbered works 1, 2, 3, 4, 5A, 6A, 7B, 
7C and 8B and MPL would simply have to have regard to where these 
works are located in constructing its Option 2B short road into the 
Project Site. This is explored further below but the key point to note is 
that whilst there is overlap between MPL’s Access Road and the RRF 
LoD, the Access Road can be located to enable co-existence between 
the two projects.  
5.6 
In relation to the overlap between MPL's Access Road and a number of 
the RRF works packages, MPL has incorporated two options for the 
Access Road in the draft MPL DCO. MPL has ensured that its LoD for 
Options 2A and 2B within which it can construct its Access Road align 
with the RRF access road LoD within Rookery South Pit. This means 
that if the RRF Project wishes to make full use of its access road LoD, 
there will be room for them to do so, as MPL's Access Road can move 
accordingly within that section of the Pit. The Works Plans (Document 
Reference 2.6) and the Land Plans (Document Reference 2.5) illustrate 
this solution.  
MPL Construction Laydown Area 
5.7 
There was an overlap between part of MPL's proposed construction 
laydown 
area 
as 
shown 
during 
statutory 
consultation 
in 
October/November 2014 (numbered work 8) and the RRF Project's 
LoD. In order to resolve this, MPL has reduced its Order limits to 
remove this potential overlap (see the Works Plans (Document 
Reference 2.6) and the plan appended at Annex 2). 
Proposed Solutions to the DCO overlaps 
5.8 
To support the delivery of Options 2A and 2B as described above, MPL 
has obtained the necessary land rights by agreement with O&H. 
However, MPL is also including provision for compulsory acquisition of 
such rights over a 10m strip (15m during construction) to ensure that 
there is no impediment to the delivery of the MPL Project. 
5.9 
To recognise the interaction between the RRF Project and the MPL 
Project, MPL has included a suggested set of protective provisions for 
the benefit of Covanta in Part 6 of Schedule 10 of MPL's draft DCO 
(Document Reference 3.1). One of the limbs of these protective 
provisions requires that MPL consults with Covanta prior to submitting 
the final design for the Access Road (either Option 2A or 2B) to the 
relevant planning authority for approval.  This way, whichever Option is 
implemented by MPL, Covanta will have the opportunity to engage with 
MPL as it develops its final design and alignment of the Access Road.  
5.10 
The second element to MPL's solution is to use its DCO to modify the 
RRF DCO (pursuant to s120 of the Planning Act 2008). The 
modification is contained within Schedule 11 of the draft MPL DCO 
(Document Reference 3.1) and includes an amendment to article 33 of 
 
88595265.1\cb57 
6 
the RRF DCO to also refer to MPL (in addition to Network Rail) and the 
inclusion in Schedule 7 of the RRF DCO of a Part 2, which contains 
protective provisions for MPL to govern the interaction between MPL 
and the RRF Project.  
5.11 
In the same way that the RRF DCO contains protective provisions for 
statutory undertaker Network Rail, MPL proposes the inclusion of 
similar provisions to protect MPL as a prospective statutory undertaker. 
These protective provisions would broadly do the following: 
5.11.1 Ensure that MPL’s access to the Project Site is maintained and 
that MPL is not prevented from constructing or using the 
Access Road;  
5.11.2 Ensure that the statutory powers set out in the RRF DCO 
cannot be used in the context of the Project unless otherwise 
agreed with MPL;  
5.11.3 Require cooperation between MPL and Covanta and their 
contractors in order to ensure that access is provided to both 
projects during construction and operation and that the parties 
work together to discuss construction programming and works 
where required; and  
5.11.4 Provide that Covanta would not be in breach of any planning 
condition or requirement if, in the event that the authorised 
development were commenced, the MPL protective provisions 
prevented Covanta from complying with such condition or 
requirement. 
5.12 
In addition, it is proposed that protective provisions in favour of MPL 
would ensure that both the powers to extinguish private rights and 
powers of temporary possession for maintenance conferred by the RRF 
DCO could not be exercised in respect of land on which the Project is 
permitted unless agreed with MPL. This is to ensure that it is clear on 
the face of the draft MPL DCO and the RRF DCO that any overlap 
between the two projects has been satisfactorily addressed, and further 
to provide certainty that the MPL works will not be compromised in the 
event that the powers conferred by the RRF DCO. 
5.13 
The use of the draft MPL DCO to modify the RRF DCO ensures that in 
the event that the MPL Project is not consented then the RRF DCO 
would not be modified unnecessarily. Further detail is set out in the 
Explanatory Memorandum (Document Reference 3.2). 
6. 
Rights of Way 
6.1 
The RRF DCO provides for the extinguishment and creation/upgrade of 
a number of Rights of Way. At present, the MPL Project Access Road 
(numbered work 2A) overlays a proposed upgrade of a cycleway that 
Covanta has committed to deliver as part of the RRF Project.  
 
88595265.1\cb57 
7 
6.2 
In addition, the location of the MPL Access Road (Option 2A) and short 
Access Road (Option 2B), the Generating Equipment (numbered works 
1A to 1D), the Substation (numbered work 5), part of the Gas and 
Electrical Connections (numbered works 4A and 6 respectively) and the 
construction laydown area (numbered work 8) lie within an area within 
which Rights of Way can be extinguished pursuant to the RRF DCO. 
6.3 
MPL has proposed that the protective provisions referred to above 
regulate the overlap of Rights of Way extinguishment powers. 
6.4 
In relation to the upgrade of the cycleway referred to above, MPL has 
drafted its Land Plans (Document Reference 2.5) in order to take a 
permanent right of access only over the access road itself (whether 
constructed by the RRF Project or MPL). MPL will only seek temporary 
use powers over the land where the cycle way is proposed to be 
upgraded by the RRF Project. This solution means that if MPL 
constructs first, the route of the cycle way shown on the RRF DCO 
Rights of Way Plan is protected. Equally, if the RRF Project constructs 
first, this aligns the access rights that MPL is seeking to secure with the 
location of the cycleway in order to avoid overlap. 
7. 
Temporary Use and Other Statutory Powers 
7.1 
There are various statutory powers within the RRF DCO (including 
temporary use powers) which interact with the MPL Order limits. These 
include: article 10 (street works); article 11 (public Rights of Way); 
article 12 (temporary stopping up of streets); article 13 (access to 
works); article 15 (discharge of water); article 16 (authority to survey 
and investigate the land); article 24 (rights under or over streets); article 
25 (temporary use of land for carrying out the authorised development); 
article 26 (temporary use of land for maintaining authorised 
development); and article 31 (felling or lopping of trees). 
7.2 
MPL proposes to use the protective provisions referred to above to 
regulate any overlap of temporary use or other statutory powers with 
the MPL Order limits. MPL notes that the interaction between the MPL 
Order limits and Covanta’s statutory powers relate only to areas where 
the RRF Project is not proposing to construct its works packages (save 
for the overlaps referred to at paragraph 5.4 above). 
8. 
Proposed Mitigation and Enhancement Measures 
8.1 
As part of its Environmental Impact Assessment, MPL has cumulatively 
assessed its likely significant environmental effects together with those 
of other projects, including the RRF Project. Where necessary, 
mitigation and enhancement measures have been proposed or 
designed with cumulative effects with the RRF Project in mind. 
Landscaping 
 
88595265.1\cb57 
8 
8.2 
The RRF DCO requires that prior to commencement of the RRF 
Project, Phase 1 of the low level restoration scheme ("LLRS") that is 
required pursuant to a Review of Old Minerals Permissions (ROMP) 
consent has to be completed (see requirement 31 of the RRF DCO). 
Certain planting is required as part of Phase 1 of this scheme.  
8.3 
In addition, requirement 8 of the RRF DCO entails the submission by 
Covanta of a landscaping scheme prior to commencement (various 
landscaping plans are also referred to in requirement 6). Certain areas 
within which LLRS and RRF Project planting are proposed to overlap 
with certain MPL Project numbered works including the Access Road 
(numbered works 2A and 2B); the Gas Pipeline (numbered work 4A); 
and the Electrical Connection (numbered work 6 and 7)). 
8.4 
MPL has therefore considered the effect of any necessary removal of 
LLRS and/or RRF mitigation planting (based on the indicative plans that 
are available) and has set out the likely significant environmental effects 
of this. To the extent that replacement planting is required in order to 
mitigate any cumulative effects (which supposes that the RRF Project is 
implemented first), this is being delivered within the MPL Order limits.  
8.5 
In the event that the MPL Project commences prior to the RRF Project, 
then MPL would place restrictions in relation to the MPL Pipeline and 
Cables that would prevent certain planting on top of these assets (see 
the Book of Reference (Document Reference 4.3)). MPL has therefore 
proposed that the protective provisions which benefit Covanta include a 
provision that, in the event that the MPL Project is implemented before 
the RRF Project, MPL must consult with Covanta to discuss any areas 
of planting that may be required in order to mitigate the effects of both 
schemes considered together. As such, MPL does not consider that any 
overlap of mitigation measures should be an issue of concern. 
Ecology 
8.6 
The Landscape and Ecology Mitigation and Management Strategy 
(Appendix 11.3 of Document Reference 6.2) developed for the MPL 
Project has taken into consideration landscape and ecology mitigation 
and management proposals set out by the RRF Project to ensure both 
projects can deliver ecological and landscape enhancements.  
8.7 
However, during construction of the MPL Project, there may be a need 
to protect and avoid damage to new habitats created by the RRF 
Project, that are within the red line boundary should the RRF project be 
constructed ahead of the MPL Project. If required, measures to protect 
such new habitats would be inlcuded in the Landscape and Ecology 
Mitigation and Management Strategy (Appendix 11.3 of Document 
Reference 6.2). 
8.8 
Areas for the RRF Project sensitive lighting scheme during construction 
are within the MPL Order limits. Sensitive lighting is also proposed for 
MPL scheme. There will therefore be a need to adopt the same 
 
88595265.1\cb57 
9 
measures/ lighting in any overlap areas. This will be written into outline 
lighting strategy for the MPL Project.  
Noise 
8.9 
A construction noise limit at South Pillinge Farm and Pillinge Cottages 
has been set in the RRF DCO as 55 dB LAeq,1h. If both the RRF 
Project and the MPL Project were constructed at the same time, there 
are likely to be cumulative noise impacts at South Pillinge Farm and 
Pillinge Cottages. However, the noise assessment set out in Chapter 7 
of the ES for the MPL Project (Document Reference 6.1) has concluded 
that any cumulative construction noise impacts will be low and therefore 
not significant.  
8.10 
There is also potential for cumulative noise impacts to occur during 
operation of both the RRF Project and the MPL Project at South Pillinge 
Farm. Requirements to regulate and monitor noise are set out in both 
the RRF DCO and the draft MPL DCO. The noise assessment set out in 
ES for the MPL Project (Document Reference 6.1) has concluded that 
any cumulative operational noise impacts will be low and therefore not 
significant 
9. 
Protective Provisions for the Benefit of Covanta 
9.1 
As noted above, MPL has included within the draft MPL DCO 
(Document Reference 3.1) protective provisions for the benefit of 
Covanta. In addition to the two provisions referred to above 
(consultation regarding location of the Access Road in the event that 
MPL implements first; and consultation regarding the location of 
landscape planting in the event that MPL implements first), the 
protective provisions for the RRF Project also state that: 
9.1.1 
MPL must consult with Covanta before exercising any power to 
temporarily stop up any street or carry out any street works 
located within the RRF DCO LoD; and 
9.1.2 
MPL must co-operate with Covanta with a view to ensuring the 
co-ordination of construction programming and the carrying out 
of works and that access for Covanta to the RRF Project is 
maintained. 
10. 
Conclusions 
10.1 
MPL is actively engaging with Covanta and O&H to discuss the areas of 
interaction and the proposed solutions outlined above that will allow 
both the MPL Project and the RRF Project to successfully co-exist. 
10.2 
Given the needs case that is set out in the relevant National Policy 
Statements that apply to both projects, MPL considers that it is vital that 
both projects should be capable of implementation, with neither project 
adversely affecting the other.  
 
88595265.1\cb57 
10 
10.3 
MPL will continue to work with Covanta on the matters referred to 
above following submission of its Application and throughout the 
Examination of its Application.
