COMMUNITY BENEFITS
This £200m Project would be a substantial investment in the area and would deliver 
significant economic benefits for a period of at least 25 years.
 
 
• Creation of around 150-250 jobs during a 2-3 year construction period
 
•  Creation of up to 15 permanent skilled jobs for on-going operation  
and maintenance of the facility 
 
• Potential business opportunities for local suppliers 
PPL will consult MSDC and SCC on ways to bring wider social and environmental benefits  
to the surrounding area.
ENVIRONMENT
PPL’s steps to mitigate the impact of the Project on the local environment, during its construction, 
operation and maintenance, are a major part of the consultation and planning process. 
Due to the nature and size of the Project, PPL is undertaking an Environmental Impact 
Assessment (EIA). The Project is classified as EIA development. The EIA considers the 
potential impacts, both positive and negative, of the Project. As part of the pre-application 
consultation materials on the proposed Project, PPL has published its interim findings of the 
EIA in the PEIR. These findings indicate the following key potential impacts, all of which will 
be mitigated through the final design process:
 
•  transport - impact to the local network from construction traffic confined to the 
construction and decommissioning periods; 
 
•  air quality and emissions – resulting from construction activities, and during 
operation of the power generation plant;
 
•  noise – potential increase in background noise during construction and operation 
within the vicinity of the site; 
 
•  visual impact and effects on cultural heritage setting – introduction of up to five  
30m stacks and a new substation into the local landscape;
 
•  local ecology – no anticipated negative impacts, but opportunity to improve local 
habitat through additional planting.

The key details of the proposed Project are:
 
•  the construction, operation and maintenance of a Simple Cycle Gas Turbine  
power generation plant capable of generating up to 299MW of electricity; 
 
 
• the power generation plant will have up to five stacks, each up to 30m in height;
 
 
•  the site for the power generation plant covers an area of approximately 10ha  
and is located within the Eye Airfield business and industrial estates. However,  
the footprint of the power generation plant would be smaller than the full site; 
 
 
•  the power generation plant is designed to provide back-up generation capacity  
which can operate flexibly to respond quickly and efficiently to both short-term  
variation in customer demand and intermittent output from renewable power 
generation. It is anticipated that it will operate for no more than 1500 hours per year;
 
• the power generation plant will produce electricity from natural gas;
 
•  the proposed Project includes the construction, operation and maintenance 
of a new underground electrical connection together with a new substation 
and equipment (referred to as a sealing end compound) to connect the power 
generation plant to the existing nearby overhead power line which is part of 
the National Electricity Transmission System. The substation with dimensions 
approximately 160m x 150m, up to 12.5m in height and sealing end compound  
with dimensions approximately 45m x 25m, up to 10m in height are together 
referred to as the electrical connection compound;
 
•  the proposed Project also includes the construction of a new underground  
pipeline to bring natural gas to the power generating plant from the National  
Gas Transmission System, located close to the site;
 
•  subject to public consultation, planning and financing, the power generation  
plant could enter commercial operation in 2018;
At this stage the preferred route options for the gas and electricity connection corridors have  
yet to be finalised. The location and layout of the electrical connection compound have also  
to be finalised, although two possible areas of approximately 12ha have been identified, and 
preliminary preferred locations for the electrical connection compound site identified within 
each site. Continued consultation and environmental assessment on the connection route  
options and possible electrical connection compound sites is required before each can be 
confirmed. In addition, although a preliminary preferred location of the power generation plant 
within the 10ha site has been identified, the final location and layout are yet to be determined.
PPL is liaising closely with Mid Suffolk District Council (MSDC) and Suffolk County Council 
(SCC). It is also engaging with the Parish Councils in the area as well as organisations such  
as the Environment Agency, Natural England and English Heritage, to ensure that the plant  
will be designed, built, operated and maintained to the highest relevant and current safety  
and environmental standards. 
For the purposes of pre-application consultation, PPL has prepared a Preliminary 
Environmental Information Report (PEIR) and a non-technical summary. These documents 
are described in more detail in the section on “Environment”.
THE NEED FOR GAS GENERATION
The Government’s policies in relation to Nationally Significant Infrastructure Projects are set out 
in National Policy Statements (NPSs). NPS EN-1 (Energy) states that “gas will continue to play 
an important role in the electricity sector – providing vital flexibility to support an increasing 
amount of low-carbon generation and to maintain security of supply.”
Gas is a reliable fuel source. It is acknowledged by the Government as being essential to a 
low-carbon economy and to underpin the country’s energy security.  In addition, gas provides 
back-up to power generation from renewable sources, particularly wind power – which is 
an increasingly prevalent but intermittent energy source. Modern gas-fired power plants are 
among the most efficient and cleanest forms of electricity power generation. The need for the 
Project is established through the NPSs and is not a topic for consultation.
WHY EYE AIRFIELD? It has three advantages:
 
1. Proximity to the national gas and electricity transmission networks
 
2. National Grid encourages new power generation development in the region
 
3.  MSDC is considering whether a part of the former Eye Airfield could be 
appropriate for energy-related use

Progress Power Limited (PPL) proposes to develop a gas-fired electricity generation project 
which includes a power generation plant and gas connection at the former Eye Airfield in 
Suffolk, together with an electrical connection and substation to connect the power generation 
plant to the existing nearby overhead transmission line (the Project). It would be capable of 
generating up to 299MW of electricity, enough to power the equivalent of 400,000 homes.
WHO IS PROGRESS POWER?
www.progresspower.co.uk
PPL is an energy development company established for the Eye Airfield project by Watt  
Power Limited of Edinburgh. Watt Power wishes to develop gas fired power plants at Eye  
and elsewhere in the UK to support the UK Government’s drive to a low carbon economy.
PLANNING & PUBLIC CONSULTATION
The Project is classified as a Nationally Significant Infrastructure Project, which means that 
a Development Consent Order (DCO) is required to build, operate and maintain it. The DCO 
application will be processed and examined by the Planning Inspectorate who will make a 
recommendation to the Secretary of State for Energy and Climate Change (Secretary of State). 
The final decision on the application is made by the Secretary of State. It is possible that the 
electrical connection and substation will need to be consented separately from the DCO and 
not as part of the Project (this is subject to ongoing discussions with National Grid). At present 
it is PPL’s intention and preference to include these elements in its proposed DCO application. 
Those responding to this consultation are requested to assume these elements will form part  
of the Project.
Consultation with local people, businesses, and organisations is an essential part of the DCO 
process and will help to influence the final designs of the Project. 
 
PPL first shared its initial plans with the public at exhibitions held at Eye Community Centre  
in May 2013. At the exhibitions and since, PPL has received and responded to comments on 
its plans. 
Several significant changes have occurred since the previous round of consultation including:  
a narrowed technology choice, a reduction to two route options for the gas connection 
corridor, confirmation that the electrical connection will be underground, a preliminary decision 
that PPL will apply for consent for the substation (rather than National Grid), a reduction in  
the maximum height of the stacks, a reduction of the footprint of the plant, and a reduction  
of building heights on the site.
Additionally, PPL has undertaken detailed technical and environmental studies, and associated 
design work to refine the design of the plant – this work is on-going. 
Illustrative visual of the five unit power generation plant. If fewer 
units are required they may be larger, though this will not impact 
the maximum stack height, which is 30m. Additional visuals will be 
available at the exhibitions and in other consultation materials.
