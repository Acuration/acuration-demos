Introduction  
1.1 
Overview 
1.1.1 This document is the non-technical summary (PEIR NTS) of the Preliminary 
Environmental Information Report (PEIR) for the proposed Millbrook Power 
Project (hereafter referred to as the Project). It has been prepared by Peter 
Brett Associates LLP (PBA) on behalf of Millbrook Power Limited (MPL) (the 
"Applicant"). 
1.1.2 The Project is proposed at and in the vicinity of the former clay extraction pit at 
Rookery South, near Stewartby, Bedfordshire.  The boundary of the Project 
Site falls within both Central Bedfordshire Council (CBC) and Bedford Borough 
Council (BBC) areas.  
1.1.3 The location of the Project Site is shown in Figure 1.1 
1.1.4 The Project would comprise: 
• 
A new Power Generation Plant in the form of a Simple Cycle Gas Turbine 
(SCGT) peaking power generating station, fuelled by natural gas and 
capable of providing a rated electrical output of up to 299 Megawatts 
(MW). The Power Generation Plant comprises: 
 Generating equipment including up to five Gas Turbine Generators, up 
to five exhaust gas flue stacks  and balance of plant, which are located 
within the Generating Equipment Site (together the "Generating 
Equipment"); 
 A new purpose built access road from Green Lane to the Generating 
Equipment Site (the "Access Road");  
 A temporary construction compound required during construction only 
(the "Laydown Area"); 
• 
A new gas connection to bring natural gas to the Generating Equipment 
from the National Transmission System (NTS) (the "Gas Connection"); 
and 
• 
A new electrical connection to export power from the Generating 
Equipment to the National Grid Electricity Transmission System (NETS) 
(the "Electrical Connection"). 
1.1.5 The Generating Equipment, Access Road and Laydown Area are together 
known as the "Power Generation Plant", and are located within the Power 
Generation Plant Site.  
1.1.6 The Power Generation Plant, Gas Connection, and Electrical Connection, 
together with all access requirements are referred to as the ‘Project’ and are 
PEIR Non-Technical Summary

all integral to the generation of electricity and subsequent export of that 
electricity to the National Grid. The land upon which the Project would be 
developed, or which would be required in order to facilitate the development of 
the Project, is referred to as the ‘Project Site’. 
1.1.7 All elements of the Project are shown on Figure 1.2.  
1.1.8 The Generating Equipment would operate as a ‘peaking plant’. This means it 
would operate intermittently, with maximum operation not exceeding 1,500 
hours per year. A peaking plant is designed to operate when there is a surge 
in demand for electricity associated with a particular event (e.g. when a large 
number of people boil their kettles following the end of a popular TV 
programme) or when there is a sudden drop in power being generated from 
power stations which are constantly in operation. It will also support 
intermittent forms of renewable energy which are weather dependent (e.g. 
wind and solar). 
1.1.9 The Project constitutes a Nationally Significant Infrastructure Project (NSIP) 
pursuant to the Planning Act 2008 which means that a Development Consent 
Order (DCO) is required to build, operate and maintain it. The proposed DCO 
Application will be processed and examined by the Planning Inspectorate who 
will make a recommendation on whether the DCO should be granted to the 
Secretary of State for Energy and Climate Change (Secretary of State) with 
whom the final decision lies. It is anticipated that the DCO Application will be 
submitted in the first quarter of 2015.The PEIR and this PEIR NTS have been 
prepared in accordance with Regulation 2 and 10 of the Infrastructure 
Planning (Environmental Impact) Assessment Regulations (the "EIA 
Regulations").  They present information specifically aimed at assisting 
consultees and local communities to understand the nature, scale and location 
of the Project. 
1.1.10 Copies of the PEIR and this PEIR NTS may be examined during a 
consultation exercise being carried out by the Applicant between 13th October 
2014 until 16th November 2014 at Central Bedfordshire Council Office (Priory

1.2 
Purpose of this Document 
1.2.1 An Environmental Impact Assessment (EIA) is being undertaken to determine 
the likely significant effects of the Project on the environment. The purpose of 
the PEIR is to present preliminary environmental information relating to the 
Project, including the preliminary findings of the assessments undertaken to 
date together with a summary of the additional information or studies required 
to complete the EIA. This will enable consultees, including the local 
community, to understand the likely significant environmental effects of the 
Project so they can provide a comprehensive response to the consultation.  
Feedback received during the consultation process will help inform the 
development and design of the Project and further refine the EIA. 
1.2.2 Under Regulation 10(b) of the EIA Regulations, the Applicant must consult on 
preliminary information relating to the Project.  The consultation responses 
received to date have been considered and referenced in the PEIR as 
summarised in this PEIR NTS. 
PEIR Non-Technical Summary

1.2.3 Once complete, the findings of the EIA will be reported in full in the 
Environmental Statement (ES) to be submitted with the application for 
Development Consent. 
1.2.4 This document is a summary (in non-technical language) of the PEIR for the 
Project. 
1.3 
The Developer 
1.3.1 The Applicant is MPL, which has been set up to develop the Project and has 
been established by Watt Power Limited (WPL). WPL has been established to 
develop flexible gas-fired power stations, designed to meet the Government’s 
energy policy objectives of security of supply and affordability, in support of 
the UK's transition to a low carbon economy. 
1.3.2 For further details on MPL please visit: http://www.millbrookpower.co.uk or 
http://www.wattpowerltd.co.uk. 
1.4 
Need for the Project 
1.4.1 National planning policy supports the need for new electricity infrastructure 
due to the current ageing and inevitable closure of older coal fired power 
plants and the likely increase in demand for electricity over the coming 
decades. 
1.4.2 The Government's policies in relation to NSIPs are set out in National Policy 
Statements (NPSs).  NPS EN-1 (the overarching energy NPS) states that "gas 
will continue to play an important role in the electricity sector - providing vital 
flexibility to support an increasing amount of low-carbon generation and to 
maintain security of supply (paragraph 3.6.2)". 
1.4.3 Gas is a reliable fuel source. It is acknowledged by the Government as being 
essential to a low-carbon economy and to underpin the country’s energy 
security. In addition, gas peaking plants provide back-up to power generation 
from renewable sources, particularly wind power, which is an increasingly 
prevalent but intermittent energy source. Modern gas fired power plants are 
among the most efficient and cleanest forms of generating electricity. 
1.4.4 Indications from the Government, in key documents (e.g. the ‘Gas Generation 
Strategy’, released by DECC in December 20121) are that up to 26 gigawatts 
(GW) of new gas generation will be needed nationally by 2030 to underpin 
long term electricity supplies and provide back-up to nuclear and wind 
generation at times of peak demand.

1.5 
Planning Policy Context 
1.5.1 The PEIR and this PEIR NTS have been prepared with reference to all 
relevant European, national, regional and local policy.   Details of these are 
contained in Section 3 of the PEIR.  
1.5.2 As referred to in paragraph 1.4.2 above, the Department for Energy and 
Climate Change has published a number of NPSs in relation to energy 
infrastructure, which were designated by the Secretary of State in July 2011. 
These NPSs set out national policy against which proposals for NSIPs are 
assessed and decided on. 
1.5.3 Due to the nature of the Project (which will generate over 50 MW of 
electricity), four of the designated NPSs are considered relevant to the 
determination of the proposed DCO Application: 
� 
NPS for Energy EN-1: This sets out national policy for energy 
infrastructure as defined by the Planning Act 2008, which provides the 
primary basis for decisions by the Secretary of State; 
� 
NPS for Fossil Fuel Electricity Generating Infrastructure EN-2: This sets 
out policies specific to the determination of applications for fossil fuel 
electricity generating infrastructure; 
� 
NPS for Gas Supply Infrastructure and Gas and Oil Pipelines EN-4: This 
sets Government policy on the relevant considerations and factors that 
should be taken into account as to route selection for developers for, inter 
alia, gas pipelines; and 
� 
NPS for Electricity Networks Infrastructure (EN-5): This provides the 
primary basis for decisions taken by the Secretary of State on applications 
it receives for electricity network NSIPs, including the relevant 
considerations and factors that should be taken into account related to 
route selection. 
1.5.4 NPS EN-1 states that consideration may be given to planning policy outside 
the NPSs where it is important and relevant to the Secretary of State's 
decision. Other national planning policies have therefore been considered in 
the preparation of the PEIR as these may be relevant to the determination of 
the proposed DCO Application.

Site and Project Description 
2.1 
Site and Surroundings 
2.1.1 The Project Site is shown in Figure 1.2 and encompasses all elements of the 
Project described in Section 1.1 of this PEIR NTS. 
2.1.2 The Power Generation Plant Site and part of the Gas and Electrical 
Connection would be situated on land within former clay pits known as ‘The 
Rookery’. The Rookery is situated in the Marston Vale between Milton Keynes 
and Bedford, approximately 3 km north-west of Ampthill, and 7 km south west 
of Bedford.  
2.1.3 The Rookery comprises two large former clay pits, Rookery North and 
Rookery South Pits. The Generating Equipment Site, Laydown Area and parts 
of the Access Road and Gas and Electrical Connections would be located 
within Rookery South Pit. Part of the Access Road would lie within Rookery 
North Pit. 
2.1.4 The Gas Connection and Electrical Connection would be located within the 
areas identified on Figure 1.2 and would extend from Rookery South Pit into 
agricultural land to the south and/or east. 
2.1.5 To the west of the Project Site is Marston Vale Millennium Country Park, 
which provides indoor and outdoor community amenities. There is a Forest 
Centre within the Marston Vale Millennium Country Park located just to the 
south of Stewartby Lake which provides the focal point for the indoor and 
outdoor community amenities. In addition Millbrook Proving Ground, a vehicle 
testing ground, is located to the south-west of the Project Site. 
2.1.6 The closest residential dwelling to the Power Generation Plant Site is South 
Pillinge Farm, located approximately 150 m to the west of the Project Site. To 
the north of Green Lane and The Rookery, lies Stewartby. Other neighbouring 
residential areas include: Houghton Conquest approximately 1.5 km to the 
east of the Project Site boundary; Marston Moretaine approximately 1.2 km to 
the west of the Project Site boundary; and Millbrook approximately 400 m to 
the south of the Project Site boundary. 
Low Level Restoration Scheme (LLRS) 
2.1.7 The Rookery is the subject of an ongoing Low Level Restoration Scheme 
(LLRS) being undertaken by the landowner.  This was the subject of a 
separate planning permission and would be taking place regardless of the 
Applicant's proposals for the Project. The objective of the LLRS is to restore 
the former clay workings to low grade agriculture. This would be achieved 
through the restoration of The Rookery at a low level (i.e. below pre-
excavation ground levels), with measures included in the restoration to 
enhance biodiversity and landscape. Further details of the LLRS are described 
in Section 2.6 of the PEIR.

2.2 
Generating Equipment Technology 
2.2.1 The Generating Equipment would provide a rated electrical output of up to 299 
MW, operate as a peaking plant fired on natural gas, and run up to 1500 hours 
per annum. Given these parameters, it has been determined that a Simple 
Cycle Gas Turbine (SCGT) plant is the preferred and most appropriate 
technology choice for the Generating Equipment for the Project. Further detail 
is provided in Section 3.3 of this PEIR NTS and Section 2.3 of the PEIR and a 
schematic showing SCGT operation is shown below in Insert 1. 
2.2.2 There are several technology options of SCGT plant available to generate up 
to 299 MW. These different options mainly relate to the number and type of 
Gas Turbine Generators used. 
2.2.3 SCGT plant often use aero-derivative Gas Turbine Generators (i.e. turbines 
derived from the aeronautical industry), primarily because of their suitability to 
frequent start-ups, flexibility, high efficiency and easy maintenance. However, 
‘industrial’ type units can also be used. These are typically larger and often 
more suited to longer operational hours. For the Project it is envisaged that 
either 3, 4 or 5 individual aero-derivative Gas Turbine Generators or, 
alternatively 1 or 2 industrial Gas Turbine Generators will be used to generate 
up to 299 MW.  
2.2.4 The Power Generation Plant will have up to five gas turbine generators and up 
to five stacks, each between 30 and 40 m in height. 
2.2.5 Section 3.1.3 sets out the worst case scenario of the Project from the above 
parameters which has been assessed in the topic sections.  
2.2.6 The main equipment in an SCGT is a Gas Turbine Generator, comprising of 
the following components(shown in Insert 1): 
� 
 Inlet air filter; 
� 
 Air compressor 
� 
Combustion chamber; 
� 
Gas turbine; and 
� 
Exhaust silencer. 
2.2.7 In the gas turbines air is compressed and natural gas is injected. The fuel will 
then burn in the combustion chamber producing hot, high pressure gases. 
This gas expands across the blades of the gas turbine which drives the 
electrical generators to produce electricity. The exhaust silencer will reduce 
noise pollution from this process. 
2.2.8 The waste gases and heat produced from this process will be released to the 
atmosphere via stacks. The stack(s) will be equipped with emissions control 
technologies which will reduce emissions released to the atmosphere

2.2.9 In addition to the Gas Turbine Generator Units at the Generating Equipment 
Site the following integral plant and buildings will also be present and can be 
seen on Insert 2. 
� 
Fire Water Tank: in order to control any fire at the Power Generation 
Plant Site; 
� 
A Control Building: Required in order to monitor the Generating 
Equipment operation and house plant controls; 
� 
A Workshop and Stores Building: To store certain strategic and routine 
maintenance spares and to provide a facility for carrying out minor 
maintenance of the Generating Equipment;  
� 
A Gatehouse: Needed to provide security and maintain a log of site 
attendance, deliveries etc; 
� 
An Electrical Banking Compound: Required to connect the electrical 
infrastructure from the Power Generation Plant to transformers before 
export to the National Grid; and 
� 
A Gas Receiving Installation: Required to regulate gas coming from the 
NTS to feed into the Generating Equipment Site at the right flow and 
pressure conditions.

2.3 
Gas Connection 
2.3.1 A new underground gas pipeline is required to connect the Generating 
Equipment to the existing NTS to provide a reliable supply of fuel. 
2.3.2 After detailed feasibility studies, it has been determined that there are two 
suitable Gas Connection options, as shown on Figure 1.2. Further details of 
these feasibility studies are provided in Section 2 of the PEIR. 
2.3.3 Gas Connection Route Corridor Option 1 ("Option 1”) is the current preferred 
option to connect the Generating Equipment to the National Electricity 
Transmission System (NETS) as it is of a shorter length and avoids crossing 
the railway line.   
2.3.4 As an alternative to the current preferred Option 1, other options that the 
Applicant considers are less technically and environmentally preferable are 
still potentially deliverable, being the Gas Connection Route Corridor 2 
("Option 2").  Although Option 2 has not been defined in as much detail as 
Option 1, it has been included within the redline boundary for the Project as 
the Applicant has not as yet made any final decisions on the location of the 
routing of the Gas Connection.  The final routing will be finalised following 
consultation and further assessment work.   
PEIR Non-Technical Summary 
Millbrook Power Project

2.4 
Electrical Connection 
2.4.1 A new electrical connection would be required to allow electricity generated by 
the Generating Equipment to be exported to the National Grid. The most 
suitable point of connection would be a new substation (likely to be located 
adjacent to the Generating Equipment within Rookery South Pit), which would 
connect in to the line of the existing National Grid 400 kV overhead line which 
runs from Sundon to Grendon.  The 400 kV line is located approximately 320 
m southwest of the Project Site and is shown on Figure 1.2.  
2.4.2 For the purposes of the assessments undertaken to date a realistic worst case 
scenario of to two overhead line double circuits (including up to seven new 
towers one of which will replace an existing tower resulting in a net addition of 
six towers) has been assumed and assessed for the connection between the 
substation and the NETS. However, the Applicant will continue to work with 
National Grid on the indicative design of the Electrical Connection over the 
coming months.    
2.4.3 
In conjunction with the construction of the Electrical Connection a temporary 
diversion of the existing 400 kV line located adjacent to the three most 
westerly existing transmission towers within the Project Site may be required.  
It is anticipated that the temporary diversion is likely to be constructed as a 
single circuit outage of the existing 400 kV line. The circuit is likely to comprise 
between one and up to four Lindsey towers, each being approximately up to 
39 m high. The temporary works may also include the temporary erection of 
scaffolding over Station Lane.  
2.4.4 
Access for the purposes of installing and dismantling the temporary diversion 
would be as described for the Electrical Connection above. At this stage, it is 
anticipated that the installing and dismantling of the temporary works may 
require a closure of Station Lane for a number of hours and that the temporary 
diversion of the existing 400 kV line would be in place for approximately three 
months.   
2.4.5 Insert 2 below shows a 3D visualisation of an indicative layout of the Project, 
including the worst case Electrical Connection that has been assessed.

2.5 
Alternatives 
Sites 
2.5.1 The Applicant has looked at a range of sites around the UK to support power 
generation plants being of the same nature as the Project. The key factors 
which were considered necessary in a site were broadly four fold: technical 
(e.g. the size of the site and the proximity to appropriate gas and electrical 
connection points), environmental, economic and whether the proposals would 
be in line with local planning policy. 
2.5.2 Based on these factors, the Project Site was considered suitable for the 
following reasons:  
� 
Close proximity to the NTS; 
� 
Close proximity to a suitable electrical connection (400 kV overhead line) 
(NETS); 
� 
The Generating Equipment Site is within previously developed land, lying 
below ground level; 
PEIR Non-Technical Summary 
Millbrook Power Project 
 
14 
 
� 
It is within an area identified as being potentially suitable for energy 
infrastructure; 
� 
It has a well-developed road network for access to the Project Site; 
� 
The Project Site is outside of areas at risk of flooding; and  
� 
There is adequate space to develop the Power Generation Plant and 
integral infrastructure. 
Generating Equipment  
2.5.3 Although other technology choices were considered for the Generating 
Equipment, SCGT is considered to be the most suitable technology choice for 
generating up to 299 MW as a peaking plant based on the following 
environmental, technical and feasibility considerations: 
� 
Visual impact: SCGT plants require shorter stack(s) compared to 
Combined Cycle Gas Turbine (CCGT) plant and therefore are less visually 
intrusive in views from the surrounding environment; 
� 
Water resources: the water requirement of a SCGT plant is significantly 
lower than for CCGT plants; 
� 
Noise and available space: noise levels from a SCGT plant would typically 
be lower than for a Reciprocating Gas Engine (RGE) plant. A larger 
number of RGE units would be required at the Generating Equipment Site 
to generate up to 299 MW. Spatially this may not be possible; 
� 
Financial: based on the anticipated electricity market, it is essential that 
the Power Generation Plant of the size proposed will be particularly cost 
effective, as it will be called upon to operate flexibly to balance out the 
National Grid and meet changing demands of customers; and 
� 
Start up times: SCGT plants are able to start up and shut down much 
quicker than similar sized CCGT plants and are, therefore, better suited to 
meeting variable demands. 
Gas Connection 
2.5.4 The Scoping Report for the Project2 described a gas connection ‘opportunity 
area’, to the south of the Generating Equipment Site, in which a new gas 
pipeline and AGI would be developed. Since the publication of the Scoping 
Report, further studies have refined this opportunity area such that there are 
now two remaining Gas Connection options (as described in section 2 of the 
PEIR).  
2.5.5 These options have been chosen as the most direct connections between the 
Generating Equipment Site and the NTS, avoiding obstructions such as

roads, large changes in elevation, waterbodies and protected sites as much 
as possible.  
2.5.6 Option 1 is the preferred Gas Connection Corridor Route. This is because it is 
shorter (and therefore less expensive and less damaging to agricultural land), 
it avoids crossing the midland mainline railway line, and other high pressure 
gas pipelines. 
2.5.7 Nevertheless, Option 2 remains a viable alternative should further studies 
reveal any as yet unknown constraints on Option 1 such as previously 
undiscovered archaeological remains.  
2.5.8 Consultation feedback will be considered in determining which option is the 
most appropriate. 
Electrical Connection 
2.5.9 The Scoping Report for the Project described an electrical connection 
opportunity area to the south of the Generating Equipment Site, in which the 
Electrical Connection would be developed. Since publication of the Scoping 
Report, further studies have been undertaken to refine the available options.  
2.5.10 Based on these studies, it has been determined that the most suitable 
location for the substation is likely to be next to the Generating Equipment 
Site within Rookery South Pit. However, a number of options still exist on the 
best way to connect the substation to the existing NETS.   The Applicant will 
continue to work with the National Grid on the indicative design of the 
Electrical Connection over the coming months.

Assessment findings  
3.1 
Introduction 
3.1.1 This section sets out, by topic area, a summary in non-technical language, of 
the preliminary findings of the assessment of likely significant environmental 
effects of the Project. It is based on information gathered from studies to date 
and will be updated and revised following further work with the final results 
reported in the ES.  
3.1.2 Throughout the following sections, the terms construction, operation and 
decommissioning have been used. These are defined as follows: 
� 
Construction – Construction of the Project. Depending on the final plant 
selection, this is anticipated to take approximately 22 months; 
� 
Operation – Operation of all aspects of the Project, including maintenance. 
The Project is anticipated to have a lifetime of approximately 25 years; and 
� 
Decommissioning – Removal of some plant items and site reinstatement 
when the Project has reached the end of its operational life. This is 
anticipated to take a similar time to construction. 
3.1.3 The following assumptions have been made prior to and in the carrying out of 
the preliminary assessment: 
� 
Embedded mitigation will be employed - namely design/standard control 
measures, such as working within best practice guidance, which will 
routinely be incorporated for the Project or for any similar project 
constructed in the UK, and as such will be used to produce the initial 
assessment as to the likely significant effects of the Project. Embedded 
mitigation includes the implementation of a construction environmental 
management plan (CEMP) which is a document designed to ensure best 
practice working methods are maintained on construction sites so that any 
risk of causing environmental harm is minimised as far as is reasonably 
practicable, such as spill prevention plans, correct storage of waste and 
prevention of pollution to land, air and water.  
� 
A worst case scenario for assessment has been undertaken for each 
topic. For the majority of topics this worst case scenario assumes that up 
to five Gas Turbine Generators will be built on the Generating Equipment 
Site, each with their own stack being up to 40 m in height. For air quality 
and ecology, a worst case scenario has been assessed assuming that up 
to five Gas Turbine Generators will be built on the Generating Equipment 
Site, each with their own stack being up to 30 m in height. This is because 
a lower stack gives rise to potentially more significant emissions. Further 
detail is provided in Section 6.2 of the PEIR. It has also been assumed 
that the Electrical Connection will include two overhead line double 
circuits, including up to seven new transmission towers one of which will 
PEIR Non-Technical Summary 
Millbrook Power Project 
 
17 
 
be replacing an existing tower and is likely to be located in close proximity 
to the location of that existing tower, thereby resulting in 6 net additional 
towers, each of up to 45 m high.  
� 
The total construction programme will be approximately 22 months, with a 
start date of 2017 and an end date of 2019;  
� 
The operational life of the Power Generation Plant will be 25 years; 
� 
The Generating Equipment will be decommissioned and removed at the 
end of its operational life; 
� 
The Gas Pipeline will be left in situ at the end of its operational life;  
� 
The decommissioning phase will be similar in duration to the construction 
phase; 
� 
The Power Generation Plant will operate for up to 1500 hours per year. 
This could be at any time during the year and for any length of time up to 
1500 hours; 
� 
The Power Generation Plant will have a rated electrical output of between 
50 and up to 299 MW; 
� 
Current surrounding land uses do not change, with the exception of the 
developments to be cumulatively assessed with the Project that have been 
identified as referred to at section 3.1.5 below; 
� 
Assessments are based on published sources of information and primary 
data collection. 
3.1.4 The following topic sections are covered by this assessment: 
� 
Air Quality; 
� 
Noise; 
� 
Ecology; 
� 
Water Quality and Resources; 
� 
Ground Conditions; 
� 
Landscape and Visual Impacts; 
� 
Traffic and Transport; 
� 
Archaeology and Cultural Heritage;  
� 
Socio-economics; and  
PEIR Non-Technical Summary 
Millbrook Power Project 
 
18 
 
� 
Other topics considered, including waste and electromagnetic frequency 
(EMF).  
3.1.5 Schedule 4, Part 1 (para 20) of the EIA Regulations requires an ES to include 
"....a description of the likely significant effects of the development on the 
environment, which should cover......cumulative effects".  For the assessment 
of cumulative effects, the effects of the Project, together with other major 
developments that are proposed or consented but not yet built have been 
assessed. The developments which have been assessed cumulatively 
include:  
� 
The proposed Covanta RRF Project to be developed to the north of the 
Generating Equipment Site; 
� 
Integrated Waste Management Operations at Rookery South, 
Bedfordshire; 
� 
Brogborough Wind Energy Project at Brogborough Landfill Site; 
� 
Land at Moreteyne Farm at Wood End in Marston Moretaine; 
� 
Land at Warrant Farm on Flitwick Road in Ampthill proposed for residential 
properties; 
� 
Land East and West of Broadmead Road, Stewartby proposed for 
residential properties - under construction; and 
� 
The new settlement at Wixams. 
3.1.6 As part of the initial scoping of the EIA it was determined that certain topics 
are more likely to give rise to potential significant cumulative effects than 
others, based on the nature of the Project and surrounding development 
proposals. Therefore certain topic assessments have focused specifically, at 
this preliminary stage of the assessment, on potential cumulative effects and 
interactions.  These topics are air quality, noise, traffic and landscape and 
visual effects.  For example, air quality may give rise to a potential cumulative 
effect given that there are emissions from the Generating Equipment and also 
potential emissions from, for example, the proposed Covanta RRF Project. 
3.1.7 For those remaining topics where cumulative effects and interactions are 
unlikely, due for example to the limited geographical nature or significance of 
the potential effect, potential cumulative effects have been considered at a 
commentary level only at this preliminary stage and will be considered in detail 
as the assessment is completed. An example of this is in relation to ground 
conditions where there will be no significant effects arising from the Project 
and therefore no potential cumulative effects are anticipated.

3.2 
Air Quality 
Introduction  
3.2.1 The construction, operation and decommissioning of the Project have the 
potential to affect air quality both through the generation of dust during the 
construction and decommissioning phases and the generation of stack 
emissions during operation. 
3.2.2 A desk based assessment, together with air dispersion modelling have been 
carried out to assess any potential air quality effects resulting from the Project 
on identified residential and ecological receptors. 
Construction and Decommissioning 
3.2.3 The main potential effects resulting from construction and decommissioning of 
the Project on air quality are from dust generated from construction activities 
(e.g. excavation for new foundations, excavation of the gas pipeline route and 
excavation for the electrical towers). There is also a small potential for effects 
arising from exhaust emissions from construction traffic. 
3.2.4 However, based on the preliminary assessment, it is considered unlikely that 
levels of atmospheric dust would be generated which would constitute a health 
hazard or nuisance to local people, ecology or industry in the vicinity of the 
Project Site. The limited numbers of vehicle movements associated with the 
project also means that there is not anticipated to be any impacts from 
exhaust emissions. Impacts would be minimised through implementation of a 
Construction Environmental Management Plant (CEMP), which would 
incorporate appropriate dust mitigation measures such as damping down or 
covering of stock piles and excavations during dry and windy weather. 
Additionally, the majority of particulates from construction activities settle 
within a very short distance of the construction site. Therefore, effects on 
receptors further afield from the Project Site will be negligible.  
Operation 
3.2.5 The main potential effects arising from operation of the Project are associated 
with the stack emissions arising as a result of the combustion of natural gas in 
the Generating Equipment. Emissions from the stack(s) include Nitrous 
Oxides (NOx). 
3.2.6 However, modern gas fired power plant are inherently clean and produce far 
fewer emissions than other fossil fuel power plants (e.g. coal) when compared 
on an energy output basis. Emissions of NOx are strictly limited under national 
and international guidelines such as the Industrial Emissions Directive. 
Operation of the Generating Equipment will also be regulated by the 
Environment Agency under an Environmental Permit, which will limit 
emissions in line with national guidelines.  
3.2.7 Initial air quality modelling has shown that an appropriate stack height which 
will achieve adequate dispersion of NOx to meet legislative limits and prevent 
PEIR Non-Technical Summary 
Millbrook Power Project 
 
20 
 
any impacts to identified receptors is between 30 m and 40 m. It is concluded, 
therefore, that effects on air quality during operation will be negligible. 
3.2.8 Emissions during the operational phase of the Gas Connection will potentially 
include infrequent emissions of natural gas and also minor emissions from 
vehicles accessing the above ground installation (AGI) for maintenance 
reasons. In terms of the Electrical Connection, very infrequent maintenance 
visits will also take place. There is therefore a very limited scope for potential 
impacts on air quality from the Gas connection or Electrical Connection.  
Cumulative Effects 
3.2.9 The only development in the vicinity of the Project from the list set out in 
paragraph 3.1.5 above which has the potential to cumulatively interact in 
terms of air quality are  the Covanta RRF Project and the Integrated waste 
management facilities planned for Rookery South Pit. The other developments 
listed are at such a distance from the Project Site so as to not to give rise to 
the potential for cumulative effects. However, very few details are available 
about the Integrated waste management facilities as at present only a Scoping 
Report has been submitted which is a high level outline conceptual design. 
Should further information on the scheme become available, then a more 
detailed cumulative assessment will be undertaken in the ES.  
3.2.10 There is also the potential that the Covanta RRF Project and the Project could 
operate simultaneously, giving rise to cumulative effects through combined 
stack emissions. However, initial modelling has been undertaken which has 
shown that given the proposed differences in stack heights between the 
Project and the Covanta RRF Project, no cumulative effects in terms of air 
quality are anticipated. Furthermore, the Covanta RRF Project will incorporate 
similar controls on dust during construction, so that no cumulative effects 
during construction are predicted either.  
Conclusions and Next Steps 
3.2.11 Based on the preliminary assessment, no likely significant effects are 
anticipated on air quality as a result of the construction, operation or 
decommissioning of the Project. A more detailed assessment will be 
undertaken for the EIA which will provide further information on the potential 
for any impacts on air quality arising from the Project. Further work will include 
a more detailed assessment of cumulative effects with other projects, as well 
as the production of figures accurately showing the distribution of stack 
emissions.  
3.3 
Noise and Vibration 
Introduction 
3.3.1 The construction, operation and decommissioning of the Project all have the 
potential to affect local noise levels and generate vibration, which may affect 
sensitive receptors in the vicinity of the Project Site. 
PEIR Non-Technical Summary 
Millbrook Power Project 
 
21 
 
3.3.2 A desk based assessment, noise survey and preliminary noise modelling have 
been undertaken at the nearest noise sensitive receptor (South Pillinge Farm) 
(approximately 150 m west of the Project Site) to assess the potential noise 
effects that may be caused by the Project. 
Construction and Decommissioning 
3.3.3 Construction and decommissioning activity inevitably leads to some degree of 
noise disturbance at locations in close proximity to these activities. Noise at 
the Project Site during construction and decommissioning could arise from 
e.g. excavation for foundations, delivery of plant, and excavation of the Gas 
Connection. This will however be a temporary source of noise. Based on a 
conservative, worst case assessment, where numerous large plant items are 
operating simultaneously, the significance of the overall effect of construction 
and decommissioning noise from the Power Generation Plant is predicted to 
be neutral at all receptor locations following the implementation of embedded 
mitigation measures which include:  
� 
All calculations for construction noise assume a 10 dB reduction due to 
use of an appropriately placed acoustic screen, which is typical of this type 
of construction / decommissioning activity. 
� 
Inherent best practice plant design incorporating acoustic enclosures to 
limit operational noise.  
� 
Implementation of a CEMP; 
� 
Use of appropriately maintained plant and equipment during construction, 
decommissioning and operation.  
3.3.4 Additionally, further noise mitigation is available in the form of programming of 
construction activities not to occur simultaneously, utilising a temporary noise 
bund and using quieter equipment. 
Operation 
3.3.5 During operation, noise disturbance could potentially occur from the rotating 
components of the Generating Equipment (e.g. the Gas Turbine Generator 
units) when operational. There may also be a limited amount of noise from the 
Access Road from the small number of vehicles associated with the operation 
of the Generating Equipment, although this will not be significant when 
compared to the existing traffic noise.  
3.3.6 In order to predict operational noise, background noise measurements taken 
at South Pillinge Farm were modelled alongside noise levels predicted for 
typical Generating Equipment similar to that expected for the Project. 
3.3.7 This preliminary assessment has shown that there are not predicted to be any 
significant noise effects at South Pillinge Farm. As this is the closest property 
to the Generating Equipment Site, it therefore follows that, by proxy, no 
PEIR Non-Technical Summary 
Millbrook Power Project 
 
22 
 
significant effects from noise are predicted at any other properties in close 
proximity to the Generating Equipment Site.  
3.3.8 During operation, there will be small amounts of noise generated by the gas 
AGI. This may be a low ‘hum’ noise or ‘hiss’ type of noise as the AGI regulates 
the flow of gas from the NTS to the Power Generation Plant. 
3.3.9 This noise is rarely perceptible except when in very close proximity to the AGI. 
Given that there are no residential properties in close proximity to the current 
preferred location for the AGI, based on the preliminary assessment, it is 
considered that the operational noise from the Gas Connection would be 
neutral. 
3.3.10 At this preliminary stage of the EIA, no impacts are anticipated from operation 
of the Electrical Connection, given the distance between the Electrical 
Connection and residential properties (approximately 100 m minimum), and 
the typically low levels of noise generated from such electrical equipment. 
However, these studies will be further refined and a more detailed assessment 
undertaken and presented in the final ES.  
Cumulative Effects 
3.3.11 The only development in the vicinity of the Project which has the potential to 
cause a cumulative effect in terms of noise is the Covanta RRF Project and 
the Integrated waste management facilities at Rookery South pit, given the 
distance from the Project of the other developments listed in Section 3.1.5, as 
well as their nature. However, very few details are available about the 
Integrated waste management facilities as at present only a Scoping Report 
has been submitted which is a high level outline conceptual design. Should 
further information on the scheme become available, then a more detailed 
cumulative assessment will be undertaken in the ES.  
3.3.12 Initial modelling has been undertaken which has shown that given the noise 
limits which the Covanta RRF Project must adhere to, added to the predicted 
noise from the Project, no cumulative effects are anticipated during 
construction or operation.  However, this will be further assessed as part of the 
ES.  
Conclusions and Next Steps 
3.3.13 Based on the preliminary assessment, no likely significant effects are 
anticipated from noise as a result of the construction, operation or 
decommissioning of the Project. Further work will be undertaken to carry out 
background monitoring at more potential sensitive receptors, as well as better 
defining any potential effects from operation of the Electrical Connection, and 
quantifying cumulative effects with the Covanta RRF Project.

3.4 
Ecology 
Introduction 
3.4.1 The construction, operation and decommissioning of the Project has the 
potential to affect sensitive ecological receptors. The Project also has the 
potential to provide ecological value, for example, by reinforcing existing 
habitats or through the introduction of screen planting, which could provide 
additional habitat for some species. 
3.4.2 In order to assess the potential for the Project to affect sensitive ecological 
receptors, desk studies and site walkover studies known as a “Phase 1 habitat 
surveys” were undertaken.  
3.4.3 Once the Phase 1 habitat surveys were completed, the resulting information 
obtained from them was then used to inform species specific surveys termed 
“Phase 2 protected species surveys”. These surveys involved field based 
assessments to determine the presence / absence of notable species and 
their population size if present. 
3.4.4 Phase 2 surveys have been undertaken for the following species:  
� 
Invertebrates; 
� 
Great Crested Newts; 
� 
Breeding Birds; 
� 
Reptiles; 
� 
Bats 
� 
Otters and Water Voles; and  
� 
Badgers.  
Construction and Decommissioning  
3.4.5 The potential effects on ecological receptors during the construction phase are 
likely to be from indirect noise, vibration and lighting, as well as direct 
disturbance of habitats. However, work is being carried out (as part of the 
LLRS scheme) to translocate certain ecological species, (for example, Great 
Crested Newts) from the Project Site so that by the time the Project starts 
construction, the Power Generation Plant Site will be void of ecological value. 
Furthermore, the areas where the Gas and Electrical Connection would be 
located have been found to be of limited ecological value.  
3.4.6 Furthermore, mitigation measures would be put in place to further limit 
potential impacts to ecology, including the careful timing of vegetation removal 
(outside of times when species are active) and maintaining an appropriate 
buffer around sensitive ecological sites during construction works. Therefore, 
PEIR Non-Technical Summary 
Millbrook Power Project 
 
24 
 
based on the preliminary assessment, no effects are predicted as a result of 
construction or decommissioning of the Project.  
Operation 
3.4.7 During operation, the main potential effects on ecological receptors are likely 
to result from stack emissions impacting on sensitive ecological sites through 
acid deposition. However, air quality modelling has shown that setting the 
stack height of between 30 and 40 m will not result in any impacts to sensitive 
ecological sites. Therefore, no effects are predicted from operation of the 
Project.  
Cumulative Effects 
3.4.8 The preliminary assessment has shown that it is unlikely that there will be any 
ecological impacts as a result of the Project.  Accordingly then, based on this 
preliminary assessment, given that the Project alone is not anticipated to  give 
rise to any ecological effects, it follows that the Project is also unlikely to result 
in or contribute to any likely significant cumulative or in-combination effects 
with other developments in the vicinity of the Project Site.  As such, it is 
anticipated that no cumulative effects assessment is required.    
Conclusions and Next Steps 
3.4.9 Based on the preliminary assessment, no likely significant effects are 
anticipated on ecological receptors as a result of the construction, operation or 
decommissioning of the Project. Further work will be undertaken to finalise the 
Phase 2 surveys, as at the time of writing, there are still some outstanding 
surveys to undertake for invertebrates and bats. The results of the completed 
surveys will be included in the ES. 
3.5 
Water Quality and Resources 
Introduction 
3.5.1 The construction, operation and decommissioning of the Project all have the 
potential to affect water quality and resources, for example through 
introduction of pollutants and sediments to watercourses or for the Project to 
be impacted by flooding. 
3.5.2 A desk based assessment has been carried out with regards to water quality 
and resources. This has identified all surface water resources within the 
vicinity of the Project Site, as well as previous pollution incidents which may 
have impacted on water bodies. The potential for the Project to be impacted 
by flooding, or for development of the Project to result in an increased 
likelihood of flooding occurring elsewhere has also been assessed.  
Construction and Decommissioning 
3.5.3 Based on the preliminary environmental assessment data, the main potential 
impacts that may result from construction and decommissioning of the Project 
PEIR Non-Technical Summary 
Millbrook Power Project 
 
25 
 
are contaminated material entering a surface water body or for the Generating 
Equipment Site to become inundated with flood water. 
3.5.4 However, there are not anticipated to be any effects on the water bodies 
identified as best practice working methods and mitigation will be employed. 
These mitigation measures include having appropriate spill response plans in 
place, the refuelling of vehicles away from watercourses and the siting of 
stockpiles and materials away from watercourses. The Gas Connection will 
need to potentially cross one minor watercourse (a drainage ditch). In order to 
minimise adverse effects best practice would be employed during construction 
of the Gas Connection to protect the water environment, in accordance with 
guidelines published by the Environment Agency and Internal Drainage Board. 
These include re-routing of drainage ditches if necessary and undertaking 
work at a time of year when ditches are likely to have lowest flow (e.g. 
summer).  
3.5.5 It is predicted that following the implementation of embedded mitigation and 
best practice construction methods referred to above, any effects on water 
quality and resources will be negligible. 
Operation 
3.5.6 During operation, the Power Generation Plant Site would be equipped with a 
surface water drainage system and a sewerage system. The surface water 
drainage system would remove any potentially polluted runoff through the use 
of oil interceptors and silt traps, prior to reaching the main sewerage network.  
3.5.7 Due to the very limited water demand of the Power Generation Plant once 
operational (only required for fire water tanks and cleaning the blades of the 
Gas Turbine Generators), all water is anticipated to be tankered to the Power 
Generation Plant Site and stored in water storage tanks adjacent to the 
administration buildings. No surface water or groundwater abstraction would 
be required. 
3.5.8 Any water generated during washing will be retained on the Power Generation 
Plant Site in a storage tank and subsequently tankered off-site by a licensed 
contractor. 
3.5.9 Additionally, part of the LLRS works to Rookery Pit mean that any excess 
surface water (e.g. from a large storm event) will be effectively managed 
through the construction of a new surface water drainage system, which will 
discharge to an attenuation pond, therefore posing no risk to the Project Site 
from flooding. Further details regarding the LLRS drainage strategy are 
provided in Section 9.4 of the PEIR.  
3.5.10 Neither the Gas Connection nor Electrical Connection will require water during 
operation, nor will they have any impact on flooding or run off rates.  
3.5.11 It is predicted that any effects on water quality and resources during operation 
will therefore be negligible and therefore not significant.

Cumulative Effects 
3.5.12 Construction or decommissioning of the Project could occur simultaneously 
with other projects in the vicinity of the Project Site.  However, the preliminary 
assessment has shown no significant effects on water quality and resources 
are anticipated to arise from the Project.  Accordingly then, given that the 
Project alone is anticipated to have no significant effects on water quality and 
resources, it follows that the Project is also unlikely to result in or contribute to 
any likely significant cumulative effects with other developments in the vicinity 
of the Project Site.  As such, it is anticipated that no cumulative impacts 
assessment is required.  
Conclusions and Next Steps 
3.5.13 Based on the preliminary assessment, no significant effects are anticipated on 
water quality and resources as a result of the construction, operation or 
decommissioning of the Project. Further work will be undertaken to produce a 
detailed flood risk assessment which will be submitted as a supporting 
document to the final ES.  
3.6 
Ground Conditions 
Introduction 
3.6.1 The construction, operation and decommissioning of the Project have the 
potential to affect ground conditions, for example, the removal of good quality 
agricultural land or from contamination (existing or created) impacting on 
human health and other sensitive receptors. 
3.6.2 An initial desk based assessment has been carried out to assess the baseline 
geology and ground conditions underlying the Project Site. The assessment 
studied information regarding previous land uses of the Project Site and the 
surrounding area, the soils and geology present at the Project Site, any 
potential contamination issues resulting from former site uses and any 
potential ground stability hazards. 
Construction and Decommissioning 
3.6.3 During construction of the Power Generation Plant, the main potential impacts 
on ground conditions will be from; 
� 
Disturbance of any existing contamination and therefore causing effects to 
receptors through the creation of pollution pathways; and 
� 
Creation of pollution incidents from e.g. spillages. 
3.6.4 Further information is provided in Section 10.4 of the PEIR.  
3.6.5 However, mitigation measures such as working within best practice guidelines 
and adhering to a detailed CEMP will be employed to prevent any 
contamination or pollution incidents impacting on ground conditions. This will 
PEIR Non-Technical Summary 
Millbrook Power Project 
 
27 
 
include having an appropriate spill response plan, correct re-fuelling of 
vehicles and plant on hardstanding and the correct storage of potentially 
hazardous substances in bunded storage tanks, thus the effect will be not 
significant.  Furthermore given the historical extraction of clay undertaken in 
the Power Generation Plant Site there is no important geology or soils 
underlying the Power Generation Plant Site. 
3.6.6 Construction of the Gas Connection will result in the temporary loss of 
agricultural land. However, this will be a relatively narrow corridor (maximum 
of 30 m working width) and any effects would be temporary. There is therefore 
considered to be a minor adverse effect. Given that land underlying the Gas 
Connection has not been subject to industrial development, the potential for 
encountering contaminated materials is considered to be low. 
Cumulative Effects 
3.6.7 Construction, decommissioning and operation of the Project could occur 
simultaneously with other projects in the vicinity of the Project Site.  However, 
the preliminary assessment has shown no significant effects on ground 
conditions are anticipated to arise from the Project.  Accordingly then, given 
that the Project alone is anticipated to have no significant effects on ground 
conditions, it follows that the Project is also unlikely to result in or contribute to 
any likely significant cumulative or in-combination effects with other 
developments in the vicinity of the Project Site.  As such, it is anticipated that 
no cumulative impacts assessment is required.    
Conclusions and Next Steps 
3.6.8 Based on the preliminary assessment, no significant effects are anticipated on 
ground conditions as a result of construction, operation or decommissioning of 
the Project. Further work will be undertaken to carry out ground water 
monitoring at the Project Site to confirm the results of the desk based work 
carried out to date.   The results of this further work will be included in the ES. 
A further appraisal of slope stability and foundation requirements will also be 
undertaken.  
3.7 
Landscape and Visual Impacts 
Introduction 
3.7.1 A desk based assessment and site visit have been undertaken to determine 
the baseline landscape character in which the Project would sit and the 
sensitive receptors which may be affected by the visual appearance of the 
Project. This study identified landscape designations, nature conservation 
designations, public rights of way, residential settlements, infrastructure and 
the historic landscape. 
3.7.2 Photographs were also taken from key viewpoints in order to produce 
photographic models (termed photomontages) showing how the Project would 
look in the landscape when viewed from key viewpoints. Key viewpoints were

agreed with consultees and include, amongst others; residential areas, public 
rights of way and historic monuments.  
Construction and Decommissioning 
3.7.3 The main potential sources of landscape and visual impact during construction 
of the Project are: earthworks, site clearance works, removal of vegetation (in 
the case of the Gas Connection), presence of construction traffic and 
presence of construction site lighting. However, given the limited construction 
period (22 months) and the relatively modest construction operations, these 
effects are considered to be not significant from the majority of locations. 
However, at one viewpoint, located on footpath 14 adjacent to Gas 
Connection Route Corridor Option 1 there is the potential for significant effects 
given the close proximity of the views. Work is ongoing to determine effective 
mitigation to limit these effects.  
Operation 
3.7.4 During operation, effects on landscape and visual amenity will result from the 
introduction of permanent structures, particularly the stacks of the Generating 
Equipment (up to five stacks) and towers (up to seven new towers) and 
overhead line required for the Electrical Connection, which will be the largest 
structures on the Project Site. 
3.7.5 However, the Project will be largely screened from views by the fact that a 
large proportion is sited within the Rookery South Pit. The Project will also be 
viewed in the context of other industrial development such as large towers of 
the former London Brick Works, the existing Sundon to Grendon overhead line 
and towers and the wind turbine at the Millennium Country Park.  Views of the 
Electrical Connection and stacks of the Generating Equipment will be clearly 
visible in some views from the south and south east, particularly along the 
Greensands Ridge and from footpath 14, as described above for the 
construction phase. A preliminary assessment is that these impacts will be 
significant at worst, and may reduce to not significant following mitigation in 
the form of landscaping and planting of vegetation.  
Cumulative Effects 
3.7.6 Construction or decommissioning of the Project could occur simultaneously 
with other projects in the vicinity of the Project Site.  However, the preliminary 
assessment has shown in the majority of cases that there will be no significant 
effects on landscape or visual amenity arising from the Project during 
construction or decommissioning.  However, there is the potential for 
significant impacts to occur from views to the south, particularly footpath 14. 
Should construction of other developments occur simultaneously, then a 
significant cumulative effect may arise. However, work is ongoing to determine 
effective mitigation to limit these effects. Furthermore, other developments 
would also be required to mitigate any construction effects through e.g. screen 
planting or use of hoardings.  
PEIR Non-Technical Summary 
Millbrook Power Project

3.7.7 During operation, there is the potential for cumulative effects to arise from the 
Project together with other planned developments. The most significant of 
these other planned developments from a landscape and visual impacts 
perspective are anticipated to be from large scale industrial or power 
developments such as the Covanta Rookery RRF, the Integrated waste 
management operations planned for the Rookery and the Brogborough Wind 
Energy Project.  
3.7.8 Whilst work is ongoing as to the cumulative impacts assessment with these 
other developments, a preliminary assessment has been undertaken which 
has concluded the following: 
� 
Not enough details are available at this time to make an assessment of 
cumulative impacts with the Integrated waste management operations 
proposed for the Rookery South Pit. The scheme is a high level outline 
concept only at this stage.  
� 
The Brogborough Wind Energy Project is approximately 4.5 km from the 
Project site and the Project and Project would not be seen in views 
together apart from when viewed from a significant distance away. 
Therefore no significant cumulative effects are anticipated.  
� 
It is recognised that the addition of the Project and the Covnanta RRF 
within close proximity would have the potential to cause cumulative 
effects, particularly for visual receptors to the south. Although the two 
projects would be viewed in the context of other industrial development 
and would look to be complimentary to each other in terms of layout and 
design. Although there is the potential for a moderately significant impact 
cumulatively, the Project would add little to the much larger Covanta RRF 
project.  
Conclusions and Next Steps 
3.7.9 Based on the preliminary assessment, there is the possibility for moderately 
significant effects from certain views, primarily from the south and east of the 
Project Site. Further work will be undertaken to produce photomontages in the 
winter to ensure that a worst case scenario is being assessed when screening 
effects of vegetation are at the minimum.  Further work will also focus on 
designing appropriate mitigation such as screen planting in order to limit 
impacts from views to the south and east of the Project Site. The results of the 
further work will be included in the ES. 
3.8 
Traffic and Transport 
Introduction 
3.8.1 The construction, operation and decommissioning of the Project has the 
potential to affect the local transport network, through the generation of 
additional traffic movements to the area in the vicinity of the Project Site. 
PEIR Non-Technical Summary 
Millbrook Power Project 
 
30 
 
3.8.2 An initial desk based assessment has been carried out as part of the PEIR. 
This identified and assessed the following: 
� 
Pedestrian and cycle facilities; 
� 
Public transport services including bus and rail services; 
� 
Private transport services including parking provision; 
� 
Highways networks and junctions; 
� 
Road safety and collision statistics; and  
� 
Impacts from increased traffic movements as a result of construction, 
operation and decommissioning of the Project.  
3.8.3 Access to the Power Generation Plant Site is proposed from the north near 
Stewartby via Green Lane. Green Lane links to Bedford Road and the A421 to 
the west, and Stewartby Way and the B530 to the east. There is a junction on 
Green Lane leading to an access track on the previously unexcavated land on 
the western side of Rookery North Pit which extends southwards into Rookery 
South Pit.  
3.8.4 A new purpose built access road would be constructed within the Power 
Generation Plant Site from Green Lane to the Generating Equipment Site (the 
"Access Road"). The route of the Access Road from Green Lane would follow 
the existing track which borders the lake within Rookery North Pit. On 
reaching Rookery South Pit the Access Road would use the access ramp 
(which will be constructed as part of the LLRS scheme) to enter into the south 
pit and cross through the base of the pit until it reaches the Generating 
Equipment Site along the alignment shown on Figure 1.2. It is proposed that 
the 1.7 km long Access Road would be bitumen construction formed with 
kerbs, and would be approximately 6 m wide allowing for two-way traffic.  
3.8.5 Several options are being considered with regard to accessing the Gas 
Connection. These options are as follows:  
� 
From M1 Junction 13 via the A507, Sandhill Close, Houghton Lane, 
Millbrook Road and the B530 Ampthill Road;  
� 
From Bedford Road, via Woburn Road, Manor Road, B530 Ampthill Road 
and Millbrook Road, or;  
� 
Through the Rookery South Pit, from the area of the Power Generation 
Plant area; or 
� 
from the A421, northwards along the A5141, westwards then southwards 
for approximately 7km along the B530 (referred to variously along its route 
as Ampthill Road / Hardwick Road / Bedford Road / Hazelwood Lane) to 
Millbrook Road.  
PEIR Non-Technical Summary 
Millbrook Power Project 
 
31 
 
3.8.6 Several options are still being considered with regard to accessing the 
Electrical Connection. They are as follows:  
� 
From Junction 13 of the M1 via the A507, Sandhill Close and Station 
Lane;  
� 
From Bedford Road, via Woburn Road, Manor Road, B530 Ampthill Road 
Millbrook Road, Houghton Land and Station Lane;  
� 
Through the Rookery South Pit, from the area of the Power Generation 
Plant area; or 
� 
From the A421, northwards along the A5141, westwards then southwards 
for approximately 7km along the B530 (Ampthill Road / Hardwick Road / 
Bedford Road / Hazelwood Lane) to Millbrook Road, Houghton Land and 
Station Lane.  
3.8.7 Any off-road site construction access would be temporary in nature, and would 
be removed following completion of the Access Road. In addition, any 
operational access requirement would have minimal and ephemeral usage. 
Construction and Decommissioning  
3.8.8 During construction, the Power Generation Plant is anticipated to require up to 
120 HGV movements and 20 car movements workers at its peak construction 
phase (for approximately three months over a 22 month construction phase). 
Construction / decommissioning of the Gas Connection will require 
approximately 68 vehicle movements at the construction peak, and the 
Electrical Connection will require approximately 34.  
3.8.9 The construction of the Project will also require the delivery of large plant 
items such as the Gas Turbine Generators, stacks, components for the new 
towers associated with the Electrical Connection and sections of gas pipeline. 
There is therefore the potential to impact on the surrounding road network 
through for example, temporary road closures and requirement for escort 
vehicles. Notwithstanding, to minimise the impact of the contractor’s vehicles 
on local towns and villages (particularly Stewartby), the Applicant will seek to 
agree a contractor's Route Management Plan at the detailed design stage of 
the Project to ensure the vehicles stick to agreed access routes and avoid built 
up residential areas as far as reasonably practical. Given these measures, 
together with the temporary nature of the construction phase, and the 
relatively few numbers of abnormal loads anticipated the effects on traffic and 
transport are predicted to be neutral and therefore not significant.  
Operation 
3.8.10 During normal operation of the Project, up to five members of staff would be 
working at the Generating Equipment Site at any one time. Three shifts per 
day are assumed, to provide 24 hour coverage. These shift changes would be 
timed to avoid the network peak hour i.e. morning and evening rush hours, 
PEIR Non-Technical Summary 
Millbrook Power Project 
 
32 
 
hence the highway impact would be minimised. Additionally, there will be 
infrequent maintenance visits by one or two engineers.  
3.8.11 Neither the Gas, nor Electrical Connection will be manned. They will have very 
infrequent service and maintenance visits.  
3.8.12 Therefore, normal operation of the Project is not anticipated to have any 
negative effects on the local road network. 
Cumulative Effects 
3.8.13 Given that the Project will not give rise to any traffic and transport effects on its 
own, no cumulative effects are predicted with other developments. However, it 
is recognised that there is the potential for the Project to be operational at the 
same time as the Covanta RRF Project, which will produce a large volume of 
additional traffic movements during operation. However, the very limited 
number of vehicles accessing the Project Site during operation (five workers 
on the Project Site at any one time) will not dramatically change the 
assumptions made by Covanta RRF in the mitigation required to alleviate the 
effects from their scheme.  Therefore, it is considered that these mitigation 
measures will still be suitable for use with the Covanta RRF and the Project. 
Should the Covanta RRF Project not progress, it is anticipated that no 
measures would be required for the Project given the limited number of traffic 
movements generated.  
Conclusions and Next Steps 
3.8.14 Based on the preliminary assessment, no significant effects are anticipated 
from traffic and transport as a result of the construction, operation or 
decommissioning of the Project. Further traffic counts will be undertaken on 
the local road network and included in the ES. 
3.9 
Archaeology and Cultural Heritage 
3.9.1 The construction, operation and decommissioning of the Project has the 
potential to affect both above ground and buried archaeological assets, as well 
as the potential to affect the setting and appreciation of assets of Cultural 
Heritage importance, including, for example, surrounding Listed Buildings, 
Registered Parks and Gardens, Scheduled Monuments and Conservation 
Areas. 
3.9.2 An archaeological desk based assessment and preliminary site visit were 
carried out as part of the archaeological assessment which identified 
archaeological and cultural heritage assets in the vicinity of the Project Site. 
Construction 
3.9.3 The extent of any previous disturbance to buried archaeological remains is an 
important factor in assessing the potential impact of the Project.  
PEIR Non-Technical Summary 
Millbrook Power Project 
 
33 
 
3.9.4  Given that the Power Generation Plant Site is within formerly developed land 
(e.g. previously excavated Rookery clay pits, it is likely that any archaeology 
would have already been removed. Therefore, this preliminary assessment 
has concluded that there will be no physical direct impacts on any heritage 
assets. The preliminary assessment has shown that no features or structures 
of archaeological interest have been recorded on the Bedfordshire Historical 
Environmental Record (HER) within the area of the Power Generation Plant.   
3.9.5 The majority of the construction works will not be visible outside of Rookery 
South Pit and therefore will have no impacts on the setting of any heritage 
assets.   
3.9.6 The Access Road will have no potential impacts on designated heritage 
assets.  
3.9.7 The Gas and Electrical Connection are in previously undeveloped agricultural 
land, and therefore there remains the potential for impacts on as yet 
undiscovered 
buried 
archaeology. 
Although 
previous 
archaeological 
investigations in the areas where the Gas and Electrical Connections are 
proposed did not reveal any significant archaeology, further assessment of 
this area will be undertaken as part of ongoing works and presented in the 
final ES.  
Operation  
3.9.8 During operation, the introduction of the stack(s) (up to five) associated with 
the Generating Equipment, as well as the towers (up to six net additional 
towers) to support an overhead electrical line, have the potential to have minor 
adverse effects on surrounding cultural heritage assets such as listed 
buildings. There is also the potential for intervisibility between the stacks of the 
Generating Equipment and the Electrical Connection and up to five Scheduled 
Monuments however, in all cases effects are anticipated to be no more than 
minor and therefore are not significant for EIA purposes. 
Cumulative Effects 
3.9.9 The Project could occur simultaneously with other projects in the vicinity of the 
Project Site.  However, the preliminary archaeology assessment has shown 
that no significant effects on heritage assets are predicted as a result of the 
Project.  Given that the Project alone is predicted to have no significant effects 
on heritage assets, it follows on that the Project is also unlikely to result in or 
contribute to any likely significant cumulative or in-combination effects with 
other developments in the vicinity of the Project Site.  As such, it is anticipated 
that no cumulative impacts assessment is required.   
Conclusions and Next Steps 
3.9.10 Based on the preliminary assessment, no likely significant effects are 
anticipated on archaeology and cultural heritage as a result of the 
construction, operation or decommissioning of the Project. Further work will be 
PEIR Non-Technical Summary 
Millbrook Power Project 
 
34 
 
undertaken to confirm the potential effects of the Gas Connection on buried 
archaeology and in relation to the operation of the Generating Equipment and 
Electrical Connection and the potential effects on cultural heritage assets such 
as Listed Buildings and Scheduled Monuments. A visit will also be made to 
Rookery south pit to assess the potential for any heritage associated with the 
pit. The results of the further assessments will be included in the ES. 
3.10 Socio-economics 
Introduction 
3.10.1 The construction, operation and decommissioning phases of the Project have 
the potential to affect the area’s labour markets, community facilities and 
tourism sector. 
3.10.2 A desk based assessment has been undertaken which has assessed the 
socio-economic makeup of the local and wider areas surrounding the Project 
through a review of statistics.  
3.10.3 The baseline socio-economic status of the local area surrounding the Project 
is characterised by a pattern of population increase which is expected to 
continue until 2021. The area has a declining work age population with more 
than one fifth of the population expected to be at retirement age by 2021. This 
is also coupled with high economic activity which is higher than the UK 
average. Retail work is the main employment category in the local area, and is 
above the national average. 
3.10.4 The Project will have slight positive effects on the socio-economic status of the 
area through both employment creation and capital expenditure and worker 
spending in the local economy. It is anticipated that up to 150 construction 
workers would be required at the Project Site during peak periods. These 
workers would not only benefit the economy directly, but would also have 
knock on effects on other businesses (e.g. slight positive impact to 
accommodation providers in providing accommodation for temporary 
workers). 
3.10.5 No impacts are predicted on tourism and community infrastructure as a result 
of the Project from visual, noise, traffic and accessibility and air quality 
impacts, given that the preliminary assessment has concluded that there will 
be no likely significant effects arising from these areas.  
Operation 
3.10.6 During operation, there will be a limited number of staff employed (of the order 
of five on the Project Site at any one time). This is anticipated to bring minor 
beneficial effects to the area in the vicinity of the Project Site through the 
generation of jobs and investment of staff from e.g. spending their wages 
locally.  
PEIR Non-Technical Summary 
Millbrook Power Project 
 
35 
 
Cumulative Effects 
3.10.7 The Project could occur simultaneously with other projects in the vicinity of the 
Project Site.  However, the preliminary socio-economic assessment has 
shown that there are minor positive effects associated with the Project. Should 
construction, decommissioning or operation occur simultaneously with any 
other projects in the area, it is anticipated that this would enhance local 
benefits for goods, services and employment, resulting in a minor positive 
cumulative effect.  
Conclusions and Next Steps 
3.10.8 Based on the preliminary assessment, no likely significant effects are 
anticipated on socio-economics as a result of the construction, operation or 
decommissioning of the Project. However, there are likely to be minor 
beneficial effects from investment at all stages of the Project. Further work will 
be undertaken to distribute a questionnaire in the area to ascertain people’s 
opinions of the Project, particularly focusing on local businesses, as well as 
mapping of tourism receptors alongside the ZTV to assess impact; review of 
relevant findings of LVIA, Noise, Traffic and Air Quality chapters to confirm 
that impacts on receptors are not significant, community infrastructure 
mapping and a review of existing capacity in the local labour market to apply 
for jobs connected with the Project.  , The results of this further work will be 
included in the ES. 
3.11 Other Topics Considered  
3.11.1 It is recognised that some of the statutory consultees have raised concerns 
that the Project may give rise to environmental impacts over and above those 
described in this PEIR NTS. Specifically, it has been requested that the 
Applicant assesses waste arising from the Project and Electromagnetic 
Frequency (EMF) arising from operation of the Electrical Connection.  
Waste 
3.11.2 As part of the construction works, there is likely to be limited potential for the 
generation of waste given that the LLRS will ensure that a level platform is 
created in the base of the Rookery South Pit on which to site the Generating 
Equipment. There may be small amounts of waste spoil produced from 
excavations for foundations, for the Gas Connection and for the new towers 
associated with the Electrical Connection, although it is hoped that as much of 
this as possible can be re-used on site.  
3.11.3 The Project will operate in full accordance with the Waste Framework 
Directive, the EPR and the Waste (England and Wales) Regulations 2011 
(where relevant). The Applicant, at all phases of the Project, will seek to apply 
the waste hierarchy as part of their waste prevention and management policy. 
3.11.4 The waste hierarchy consists, in order of preference, of: 
� 
 Prevention; 
PEIR Non-Technical Summary 
Millbrook Power Project 
 
36 
 
� 
 Re-use; 
� 
Recycling; 
� 
Other recovery (e.g. energy recovery); and 
� 
Disposal 
3.11.5 A CEMP will be produced, which provides for the submission of construction 
method statements for approval by the local authority prior to commencement 
of construction, secured by a requirement attached to the DCO. 
3.11.6 Measures will include, amongst others, the stockpiling of excavated spoil and 
testing for Waste Acceptance Criteria, to determine whether it can be re-used 
on- or off-site, and the testing and removal, as appropriate, of any water from 
de-watering activities which will be handled by a suitably licensed waste 
contractor. 
3.11.7 In order to facilitate the implementation of the Waste Framework Directive 
during decommissioning, much of the structures and equipment for the 
proposed Project will be made of materials suitable for recycling as far as is 
practicable. For example, a large proportion of the buildings will be 
constructed of pre-fabricated steel and will therefore be of interest to scrap 
metal merchants. 
3.11.8 Only small quantities of potentially hazardous waste will be stored on the 
Project Site at any time, and any such substances will be held in secured 
containers to prevent contaminant migration. Closed storage facilities or 
suitable dampening techniques will be utilised within the Project where 
emissions of dust etc. from waste are possible. All mitigation measures will be 
in full accordance with industry good practices. 
3.11.9 The CEMP will ensure that all construction waste will be dealt with in a 
manner that complies with relevant legislation and (upon leaving the Project 
Site) waste will be treated and disposed of by suitably licensed contractors. 
Where hazardous waste is transported from the proposed Project Site, it will 
be handled in accordance with relevant regulations, and, where necessary, be 
transported in sealed tankers. 
3.11.10 During operation a feature of the Gas Turbine Generator technology to be 
incorporated in the proposed Project is that waste generated should be 
minimal and will be restricted to the following: 
� 
General office wastes; 
� 
Used air intake filters (typically replaced annually); 
� 
Used ion exchange resins or used membranes (typically replaced every 5 
to 10 years); 
� 
Separated oil / sludge from oil / water separators; and 
PEIR Non-Technical Summary 
Millbrook Power Project 
 
37 
 
� 
Used oil, chemicals or chemical containers. 
3.11.11 Based on the above, it can be concluded that that the proposed Project will 
result in no likely significant effects with respect to waste.  
EMF 
3.11.12 The potential effects of electric and magnetic fields is a very specialised area 
which relies upon extensive work of worldwide experts. UK Power developers 
(such as the Applicant) rely on national guidelines in accordance with 
Government advice to ensure that new installations consider health risks 
based on current knowledge. The UK’s Health Protection Agency, previously 
the National Radiological Protection Board NRPB, provides independent 
recommendations to the Government based on reviews of international study 
results. 
3.11.13 In the absence of statutory regulations to limit the exposure of people to 
power-frequency electric or magnetic fields, guidelines published in 1998 by 
the International Commission on Non-Ionizing Radiation Protection (ICNIRP) 
are adopted in the UK as recommended by the NRPB. 
3.11.14 Based on these guidelines, it is likely that that the EMF field strength for the 
Project would be the same as that which is already present associated with 
the existing 400 kV Sundon to Grendon overhead line, and that the field 
strength remains within the1998 ICNIRP occupational exposure Reference 
Level. 
3.11.15 A full EMF report will be produced as part of the ongoing EIA and reported in 
the ES.

Overall Conclusions 
4.1.1 This PEIR NTS provides a background and sets the context of the proposed 
Millbrook Power Project and summarises the preliminary assessment of 
environmental effects from the Project, based on work done to date. 
4.1.2 It has concluded that the use of SCGT is the most appropriate technology 
choice for the Generating Equipment and that the Project Site is appropriate to 
support a project of this nature. Key features of the Project site are the close 
proximity to existing gas and electrical connection infrastructure.   
4.1.3 The preliminary assessment of environmental effects has shown that the 
Project can be responsibly delivered without causing significant harm to the 
environment. No effects are predicted on local air quality, noise sensitive 
receptors, ecology, water quality, ground conditions, traffic and transport or 
archaeology and cultural heritage during the construction, operation or 
decommissioning phases, or cumulatively with those developments listed in 
Section 3.1.5.  
4.1.4 Minor positive effects are likely to result on the socio-economics of the area 
surrounding the Project Site due to an increase in workforce during all phases 
of the Project.  
4.1.5 Potentially significant effects have been identified from one of the visual 
receptors on a footpath within the Project Site. However, further assessment 
will be undertaken to determine whether this impact can be mitigated through 
the use of strategic planting. 
4.1.6 Further work is ongoing to cement the assessments undertaken to date and 
will be reported in the ES.
