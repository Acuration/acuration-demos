General - 
CEMP 
Construction During Construction of the Project a Construction Environmental Management Plan (CEMP) would 
be followed. The CEMP would set out best practice construction methods and safe working 
practices to be followed so as to limit construction impacts on the environment. Specific items 
included in a CEMP for the Project are discussed below topic by topic. An outline CEMP for the 
Project is provided as Appendix 3.2 of the ES.  
3.6.3 
DCO Requirement 10 
which sets out the need 
for a CEMP 
Air Quality 
Construction Best practice measures to limit dust would be set out in the CEMP. This includes mitigation relating 
to: site planning, construction activities and site activities. Key measures include wheel washing, 
damping down of stockpiles during dry and windy conditions, and sheeting materials to prevent dust 
migration. Good site management practices (e.g. adherence to guidance such as ‘control of dust 
and emissions from construction and demolition, best practice guidance’ 2006) during the 
construction works will help to prevent the generation of airborne dust. It will be the responsibility of 
the nominated main contractor and site manager to ensure through the CEMP that sufficient 
precautionary measures to limit dust generation are undertaken. 
Additionally, standard mitigation measures for low risk sites, taken from the Institute of Air Quality 
Management (IAQM) document ‘Dust and Air Emissions Mitigation Measures’ tables would also be 
applied. These are: 
 
Record all dust and air quality complaints, identify cause(s), take appropriate measures to 
reduce emissions in a timely manner, and record the measures taken; 
 
Make the complaints log available to the local authority when asked; 
 
Record any exceptional incidents that cause dust and/or air emissions, either on- or off- site, 
and the action taken to resolve the situation in a log book; 
 
Avoid bonfires and burning of waste materials on site; and 
 
Ensure vehicles entering and leaving sites are covered to prevent escape of materials during 
transport.

CEMP - DCO 
Requirement 10  
Air Quality 
Operation 
The Project has been designed from the outset to comply with legislative limits for the emissions of 
pollutants, particularly NOx. Together, NOx control on the turbine (through dry low NOx burners) 
and an appropriate stack height to ensure adequate dispersion of pollutants (between 32.5 and 
35m) mean that breaches of assessment levels for pollutant concentrations during operation of the 
Project will be extremely unlikely under normal operating conditions.

Vibration; 
 
Construction works shall not take place outside the hours of 07:00 – 19:00 Monday to Friday 
and 07:00 – 13:00 on a Saturday, with no working on Sundays or Bank Holidays unless 
otherwise agreed with BBC / CBC;

Ecology 
Construction Appropriate regard for the protection of habitats and protected species during the construction 
works will be included within the final CEMP and will incorporate the following measures: 
 
Work compounds and access tracks etc. will not be located in, or adjacent to, areas that 
maintain habitat value wherever possible. This includes surface water management ditches, and 
areas of tree and scrub planting; 
 
Site fencing will be used to prevent access to areas outside working areas, particularly in areas 
adjacent to features of ecological value; 
 
Procedures will be implemented to address site safety issues, including storage of potentially 
dangerous materials; and 
 
Briefings and instruction would be given to contractors regarding the biodiversity issues 
associated with the Project Site.

Ecology 
Operation 
The Landscape and Ecology Mitigation Strategy for the Project will ensure that any habitats of 
ecological value that would have been created as part of the LLRS (in the absence of the Project) 
will be incorporated into the design of the Project.  This includes surface water management ditches 
(albeit with minor realignments to the north and south of the Generating Equipment and Substation), 
and areas of tree and scrub planting.  Should the construction of the Access Road result in the loss 
of any vegetation, this would be replanted with appropriate native species.  In addition, the 
enhancement of retained vegetation and creation of new habitats, through tree and hedgerow 
planting and new ponds (as detailed in the Landscape and Ecology Mitigation Strategy) would be 
expected to result in a net gain in biodiversity.

Ecology 
Construction The management measures identified below are required in order to avoid the incidental 
mortality/injury of Great Crested Newts during the implementation of the Project, and to ensure that 
the favourable conservation status of the local great crested newt population is maintained. Great 
Crested Newts should be considered with regard to the following works in particular, as identified 
through the ecological assessment within the EIA:  
 
Any requirement to carry out the works under a precautionary method statement included within 
the CEMP or a derogation licence issued by Natural England to ensure that no newts are 
harmed during the construction process, will be determined prior to construction; 
 
If required, appropriate mitigation measures will involve the appropriate timing of works, 
avoidance of suitable terrestrial habitat as far as possible, and the careful removal/ dismantling 
by hand of any suitable refugia beneath the footprint of the works; 
 
The working width of the Gas Connection through the hedgerows will be minimised as far as 
possible and gaps will be used in the hedgerows to reduce the habitat loss.

Construction A strip of plantation woodland (indicated by Target Note 2 on Figure 2, Appendix 8.1) will require 
removal within 250 m of Pond C, the area of trees which require clearance has been reduced to 
0.17 ha (85 m x 20 m), and a proportion of this vegetation will be coppiced/ pollarded to reduce 
ground disturbance. This would minimise any potential impacts in ecological receptors.

Ecology 
Construction Any elements of the Project affecting the limited areas of potential reptile habitat will give due regard 
to the legislation protecting common and widespread reptile species, i.e. protection against injury 
and killing.  This will be achieved through the displacement of any reptiles present into areas of 
retained habitat within and adjacent to the Project Site prior to construction works commencing 
through the following approach: 
 
Progressive removal of suitable low-lying vegetation, including long grass, ruderals and 
scrub, using hand-held tools.  The final stages of clearance to ground level should take 
place during suitable climatic conditions at a time of year when reptiles are active (generally 
April to September inclusive); 
 
Dismantling of any potential hibernacula or refugia by hand, including compost heaps and 
log piles; 
 
Where appropriate, ground level clearance work will be overseen by a suitably experienced 
ecologist who would relocate any reptiles encountered to an area of suitable retained 
habitat within and adjacent to the site; 
 
Following the clearance of vegetation, the vegetation will be maintained at ground level to 
prevent re-colonisation prior to works commencing. 
 
This will be outlined in the Landscape and Ecology Mitigation Strategy.

Construction Nesting birds are protected under the Wildlife and Countryside Act 1981.  Any clearance or cutting 
of woody vegetation will avoid the breeding bird season (generally taken to be March to August 
inclusive) in order to avoid the destruction of active birds' nests. If this is not possible, the vegetation 
will be checked prior to removal for the presence of any active birds' nests.  If active nests are 
present, an appropriate exclusion zone will be retained around the nest and such works will be 
delayed until the young birds have fledged and the nest becomes inactive.

The Project layout has been designed to ensure that the tree and scrub-lined Access Road, which 
was found to constitute an important resource for foraging and commuting bats will be retained.

Operation 
The planting proposed has been designed to ensure the value for biodiversity is maximised, whilst 
performing a landscape screening function.  This will involve the creation of a new structurally 
diverse and species-rich belt of woodland planting, to reflect the species composition within the 
wider Marston Vale Forest.  The existing species-poor hedgerow would be augmented and 
additional planting and appropriate management of existing blocks of planted woodland would be 
expected to enhance their nature conservation value.  Native species of local provenance will be 
used, wherever possible. These new areas of planting linking existing habitats would be expected to 
increase the connectivity of the site for wildlife.

In addition, a series of small ponds will be created within the Project Site, designed to be of value to 
wildlife, with shallow sloping edges planted with marginal vegetation to provide egg laying 
opportunities for newts. This new pond creation would also contribute towards the current Froglife 
project in the Marston Vale, which is aiming to increase the number of ponds available for meta-
populations of newts within the Vale. Indicative locations of ponds are included in the outline 
LEMMS, in Appendix 11.3 of the ES. The exact location of the ponds would be defined prior to 
construction, in liaison with stakeholders and would be included in the approved Landscape and

conditions 
Construction The CEMP would include best practice working methods to prevent pollution to the ground and 
groundwater. These would include: 
 
Conduct a Foundation Works Risk Assessment (FWRA) by the contractor once the proposed 
foundation solutions are known (to form part of the CEMP) to prevent the proposed 
foundations from adversely affect the water environment beneath the site; 
 
Construction activities will be carried out in full compliance with appropriate health and safety 
legislation, at current amendments, and with reference to appropriate guidance documents 
and approved Codes of Practice published by the HSE; 
 
Where there is the potential for instability to occur, temporary works measures including trench 
sheeting in any excavations will be utilised. 
 
Apply the following procedures if unidentified contaminant “hotspots” showing visual or 
olfactory evidence of contamination are discovered during construction works: Stop work 
immediately; Report the discovery to the Site Manager;  Seal off the area to contain the 
spread of contaminants; Clear the area to ensure there is nothing that could cause fire or 
explosion;  Contact the regulator or local authority once it is confirmed that contamination is 
found;  Arrange for testing to be carried out/agree changes to the existing contamination 
strategy;  Record details of the incident, including photos and relevant information; and any 
soils which are considered to be contaminated hotspots will be removed and disposed of by a 
suitably licensed contractor or treated onsite. 
 
Material which is excavated and free from visual and olfactory evidence of contamination will 
be stockpiled/tested to assess its suitability for reuse on the Project Site.  
 
Temporary dewatering pumps will be implemented, if significant groundwater flows are 
encountered within excavations; 
 
Design and construction of piled foundations will be undertaken in accordance with EA 
guidance ‘Piling and Penetrative Ground Improvement Methods on Land Affected by 
Contamination’ (EA, 2001), and therefore will follow best practice to ensure that groundwater 
mixing does not occur; 
 
All water from dewatering activities shall either be transported off site by a suitably licensed 
contractor or treated on site. Any proposed discharges to existing land drains (or other surface 
water bodies) will be undertaken in accordance with the requirements of the EA Regulatory 
Position Statement on temporary water discharges from excavations. 
 
Where soils are imported onto the Project Site, they shall be subject to testing to ensure they 
are not contaminated.  
 
Imposition of speed restrictions onsite to minimise disturbance of bare surfaces. Measures 
shall be put into place to ensure that the length of time bare surfaces are left exposed are 
minimised. 
 
Imposition of the following measures in accordance with the EA’s Pollution Prevention

Construction workers will wear appropriate PPE for the nature of works being undertaken. This 
will involve standard site PPE, plus overall, gloves and eye protection where required. 
 
Any soils excavated which are considered to be potentially contaminated (e.g. visual or 
olfactory evidence) will be reported to site management and left alone until their appropriate 
treatment. Suitable training will be provided to site personnel to ensure the correct 
identification of potentially contaminated soils by olfactory means;  
 
Site personnel will be made aware of the potential impact on ground and surface water 
associated with certain aspects of the construction works to further reduce the incidence of 
accidental impacts;

 
In the relation to the potential to induce mixing of confined groundwater bodies by construction 
of piled foundations, the design and construction will be undertaken in accordance with EA 
guidance ‘Piling and Penetrative Ground Improvement Methods on Land Affected by 
Contamination’ (EA, 2001), and therefore will follow best practice to ensure that groundwater 
mixing does not occur.

reappraisal of risk. There are not expected to be any effects following the implementation of these 
additional mitigation measures.

conditions 
Construction A detailed assessment of the uplift forces acting upon any permanent buried structures will be 
undertaken following confirmation of the construction technique and therefore the mass of any 
buried structures.  If uplift forces exceed the mass of the structure and any permanent contents, 
then foundations will be designed to accommodate uplift forces with appropriate factors of safety.  
Appropriate method statements and foundation works risks assessments will be developed in 
accordance with industry guidelines. A range of different foundation designs can all be incorporated 
within the boundary of the Generating Equipment Site.

CEMP 
LVIA 
Construction As the construction period is of a limited duration (approximately 22 months), significant mitigation 
to limit landscape and visual impacts is not anticipated. However, the following would be applied 
through a CEMP: 
 
Land / vegetation clearance and occupation would be limited to the minimum area necessary 
for the works; 
 
Temporary protection of vegetation and other vulnerable features to be retained would be 
undertaken in accordance with prevailing best practice; 
 
Temporary storage of soils and other material considered of value for retention would be 
undertaken in accordance with prevailing best practice. Where practical stockpiles would be 
sited to screen the construction works from sensitive receptors such as PROW; 
 
Construction areas would be laid out to minimise adverse impacts arising from temporary 
structures, construction activities and lighting; 
 
Construction roads would be on the same alignment as permanent access roads where 
possible; 
 
Use of construction site lighting outside normal working hours would be restricted to the 
minimum necessary for workforce and public safety, and for security. Directional luminaries 
would be used to limit unwanted light spills 
 
Maintenance of tidy and contained site compounds; 
 
Hoardings erected around the area of construction works, for reasons of creating a visual 
barrier to construction activities and also as a safety measure, to prevent access to the 
general public; 
 
Temporal measures including the removal of all temporary structures and stockpiles when no 
longer required, and prompt reinstatement of construction areas; 
 
Reinstatement of all agricultural land required temporarily during construction, and a five-year 
aftercare plan to seek to ensure land is returned to its former productivity; and

Operation 
An outline Landscape and Ecology Mitigation and Management Strategy (LEMMS) is included as 
Appendix 11.3 of the ES. The strategy seeks to implement appropriate landscape screen planting 
and enhancement on the Project Site and has been designed taking into consideration both the 
LLRS and any landscape planting proposed by Covanta for the Rookery South RRF Project.

The Applicant is working with appropriate advisors to ensure good design which will seek to blend 
the Power Generation Plant into the landscape as much as possible through layout, scale and 
external appearance and will be fit for purpose for the lifetime of the Project.

Traffic and 
Transport 
Construction Separate to the CEMP, the mitigation measures designed to limit potential impacts from 
construction phase traffic movements are described in an outline Construction Traffic Management 
Plan (CTMP (Appendix 12.4)) which would include:  
 
Route Management Plan to direct HGVs away from the sensitive local transport network;¡ a 
traffic management scheme at the junction with Green Lane and the Access Road to control 
queuing and to ensure no blocking of the railway develops; 
 
Traffic management scheme for the Gas Connection access at Houghton Lane; 
 
Traffic management scheme for the Electrical Connection Access at Station Lane; 
 
Construction Vehicle Parking Strategy to control the vehicle generation and minimise impact 
on the surrounding area;  
 
Footpath management plan to ensure any footpath route affected by the works are protected, 
and that the pedestrians may use them safely; and 
 
Abnormal Load Delivery strategy to manage the delivery to site of the major items of plant and 
apparatus that are indivisible.

Operation 
Whilst any significant mode shift away from the private car is unlikely for the Project - there are likely 
to be only five workers on site at the same time - a Travel Plan has been created specifically 
targeting employees to decrease the number of vehicles accessing the Project. This is contained in 
Appendix 12.2. A range of non-car Initiatives will be implemented to encourage the use of 
alternative modes of travel to the private car.

Lighting 
Construction 
and 
Operation 
The contractor should follow relevant guidance and legislation relevant to lighting, including:  
 
Institution of Lighting Professionals (ILP) Guidance Notes for the Reduction of Obtrusive Light, 
(2011); 
 
The English Department for Communities and Local Government (DCLG) Guidance on Lighting 
in the Countryside: Towards Good Practice (1997); 
 
Assessment of the Problem of Light Pollution from Security and Decorative Light produced by 
Temple and NEP Lighting Consultancy on behalf of Defra; 
 
The Bat Conservation Trust – Bats and Lighting in the UK (May, 2009). 
 
The Bat Conservation Trust (BCT) – Statement on the Impact and Design of Artificial Light on 
Bats; 
 
Environmental Protection Act 1990 (as amended); 
 
The general design objectives that will be used to ensure that potential adverse effects of 
lighting associated with construction of the Project are minimised are listed below: 
o 
Use appropriately designed luminaires for the task at hand; 
o 
Use louvres and shields to prevent undesirable light break-out; 
o 
Demolition and construction lighting should be directed away from all sensitive receptors; 
o 
Preference should be given to several, lower lighting units rather than tall, wide beam 
lighting units to illuminate large areas as it will limit light trespass, glare and sky glow from 
the Project Site; 
o 
Vehicle lights should be properly directed (conforming to MOT requirements) and lenses 
must be intact to prevent un-necessary glare and light intrusion; 
o 
Lighting should be reduced or switched off when not required for safety purposes. Security 
lighting should be kept at the minimum level needed for visual and security protection; and 
o 
Motion sensitive lighting will be used in order to avoid unnecessary lighting. 
 
Light fittings will comply with the specifications and the requirements of CIE 150 (2003) and 
Institute of Lighting Engineer’s Guidance Notes for the Reduction of Obtrusive Light.

Archaeology 
and Cultural 
Heritage 
Construction A programme of archaeological mitigation will be undertaken on the Gas and Electrical Connection 
as a requirement of the DCO.  This has been agreed with the Central Bedfordshire Council’s 
Archaeologist during consultations.  The exact scope of these works will be agreed with the 
Council’s Archaeologist following the granting of the DCO.  Ahead of these discussions, it is 
envisaged that the mitigation will compromise the stripping of the Gas Connection under 
archaeological supervision followed by the full excavation and recording of archaeological features 
exposed.
