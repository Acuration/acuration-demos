1. Headlines
2017 finished by continuing the familiar trends for Britain’s electricity: 
renewables replacing fossil fuels and carbon emissions falling. Article 2 begins 
with a review of events in 2017 – which saw half of Britain’s electricity come from 
low-carbon sources, as coal and gas output fell by a tenth and wind farms posted  
a record year.
Wind generation grew 45% between 2016 and 2017. Article 3 explores how higher 
wind speeds and the completion of several onshore and offshore wind farms 
contributed to record-breaking wind output over the year, and especially in  
Quarter 4. Together, wind, solar, biomass and hydro produced 96 TWh of electricity 
in 2017, enough to power the whole of Britain sixty years ago. Article 4 looks at the 
long-term diversification of electricity supply, and how far low-carbon energy  
has come. 
Together, these changes meant that carbon emissions from Britain’s electricity 
consumption fell by 12% last year. This saving amounts to 10 million tonnes  
of CO2 in a year, equivalent to taking one in seven of Britain’s cars off the road  
(see Article 5).
After seeing record electricity imports in Quarter 3, Article 6 explores why net 
trade between Britain and France fell to zero during Quarter 4. Article 7 rounds up 
the statistics for the quarter.
Generation mix in Britain over the last eight years. Generation from fossil 
fuels has almost halved since 2010, demand has fallen by a tenth, and 
output from renewables has increased six-fold.

2. 2017 in review
Britain’s power system once again enjoyed its greenest year, with 50% of 
electricity coming from low-carbon sources. 2017 saw generation from fossil fuels 
fall by a tenth; driven down by lower demand and greater wind output (see Article 3). 
Even after the historic reductions in carbon emissions in 2016, the CO2 from British 
electricity fell by another 12% in 2017 (see Article 5).
The share of fossil fuels has fallen from 80% to 50% since 2010, and with it the 
share of flexible, controllable capacity. Coal and gas produced just 140 TWh of 
Britain’s electricity last year, having fallen for seven consecutive years from  
260 TWh in 2010. Nuclear, renewables and low-carbon imports together produced 
139 TWh, and as Carbon Brief reported, the share of low-carbon generation rose to 
over 50% averaged over the year.1
The chart below shows how the daily mix of generation varied through the year. 
After plummeting 60% in 2016, coal generation fell by a further quarter in 2017. 
Coal is now the preserve of the colder months when demand is over 35 GW. April 
saw the first ever full day with no coal generation, and across the year there were 
618 hours that were coal-free. Solar power has become a major supplier during the 
summer months, with more electricity coming from the sun than from coal on  
183 days last year.
Despite demand for electricity being highest during the winter months, this 
coincided with times when Britain was exporting electricity, primarily to France. 
With French nuclear reactors offline again during Quarter 4 for safety upgrades, 
France was willing to pay more for electricity and so our generators profited from 
exporting (see Article 6).
With more low-carbon capacity due to come online during 2018, the coming year 
may also see the majority of Britain’s power coming from low-carbon sources.

This milestone includes the output from smaller generators which are ‘invisible’ to the electricity system. Some ‘captive’ power stations – or 
‘autogenerators’ – are used to power industrial sites and never export electricity onto the national grid. No estimates of their half-hourly 
output exist, so they cannot be included in the Electric Insights data.

3. Wind power grows 45%
Wind farms produced a record 15% of Britain’s electricity last year, up from 10% 
in 2016. They produced 45 TWh of electricity over the year, more than twice the 
output from coal. The dramatic increase comes from both higher wind speeds and 
a jump in installed capacity. Several large offshore farms came online and onshore 
wind had a record year for deployment.
Quarter 4 saw Britain’s wind farms smash previous records, producing 15 TWh in 
three months, or 19% of electricity consumed. Their production averaged 6.6 GW 
in each of the three months – double the anticipated production from the Hinkley 
Point C nuclear plant. However, the output from wind is more variable than from 
nuclear and thermal power stations. During Quarter 4, wind farms spent 24 hours 
producing less than 1 GW, and 24 hours producing more than 11.7 GW (chart,  
below right).
The very active hurricane season boosted wind speeds, which were 5% higher in 
2017 than 2016.2 However, the year-round average of 10.1 mph was in line with 
the long-term average for Britain, meaning expectations for 2018 should be just 
as good. Quarter 4 brought three named storms and an ‘ex-hurricane’,3 and saw 
Britain’s record for peak wind output broken four times. Wind output surpassed 
11 GW for the first time in October then 12 GW in December. It hit 12.4 GW on New 
Year’s Eve as Storm Dylan swept across the North Sea – and wind has continued 
breaking records into the New Year.
Registered wind capacity also increased by 20% (3.2 GW) over the last twelve 
months.4 Several large offshore farms and record new onshore wind capacity were 
installed in 2017, as reported by RenewableUK. Dudgeon and Race Bank on the east 
coast, Walney in the north-west and Rampion off the south coast each added over 
400 MW (powering approximately 400,000 houses). These farms span dozens of 
square miles, and the latter two are still being commissioned, so operating capacity 
will continue to grow over the coming months.

4. Powering the past
Britain’s renewable output grew 27% last year, and would have been sufficient 
to power the entire country 60 years ago. This year’s renewables produced more 
than the country’s annual electricity demand in 1958. At the height of Beatlemania 
in 1964, electricity use had risen sharply, but putting this year’s renewables and 
nuclear together could have powered Britain without fossil fuels.
Renewable energy surged in 2017 thanks to windier weather and more capacity 
coming online. Of the 294 TWh of grid-supplied electricity consumed in Britain, a 
quarter came from biomass, hydro, wind and solar plants. Electric Insights recorded 
73 TWh of renewable output from plants which operate in the electricity market 
or export to the national grid. Adding on the many smaller ‘embedded generators’ 
which produce electricity locally,5 the renewable total rises to 96 TWh.6
In 1958, Britain’s 52 million people consumed a little less than this – 91 TWh. The 
year that brought us Blue Peter, “A Bear Called Paddington” and the Hula Hoop, could 
have been powered by today’s renewable electricity – averaged over the year. At the 
time, 92% of electricity came from coal, and the power system emitted 93 million 
tonnes of CO2. Last year, Britain’s renewables produced as much electricity with just 
3 million tonnes of emissions (due to processing and importing biomass).
Of course, producing the same amount of energy over the year is very different 
to balancing the nation’s electricity demand hour by hour. Running the country 
on renewables and nuclear would need tremendous support from integrating 
technologies (energy storage, responsive demand and interconnection) – but still, 
this shows just how far clean energy has come in Britain.

5. Carbon emissions down 12%
2017 was once again the cleanest year for electricity production in Britain. 
Carbon emissions (including those from imported electricity) were 72 million 
tonnes over the year, down 12% on 2016 due to lower coal and gas production. This 
amounts to 150 kg of CO2 saved per person – equivalent to taking one in seven 
cars off the road (4.7 million in total).7
 Yet this saving comes without requiring any 
active change in people’s lifestyles.
The average carbon content of electricity has fallen to 237 g/kWh over 2017. The 
average during Quarter 4 was 272 g/kWh, greater than the year-round number 
as more fossil fuels are used when demand is higher. The range8 last quarter was 
140–360 g/kWh, compared to 400–510 g/kWh just four years ago (see chart bottom 
left). The instantaneous carbon intensity hit a record low of 56 g/kWh just after 
midnight on the 2nd of October (20% below the previous minimum in June). At 
the time, just 12% of electricity came from gas, the rest was low carbon. Q4 saw 
41 hours with a carbon intensity under the important threshold of 100 g/kWh, 
bringing the total for the year to 139 hours (up from just 4 hours in 2016).
What does a low-carbon grid mix look like? The chart below-right shows Britain’s 
average grid mix for different levels of carbon intensity. The cleanest mixes are 
only seen during times of low demand (e.g. overnight in summer). Reaching below 
100 g/kWh generally requires 50% renewable energy and demand below 30 GW. 
An absence of coal is generally needed to stay below 200 g/kWh. As all of these 
features are becoming more common, we expect more time under 100 or  
200 g/kWh in the future.

6. Moving electricity across the channel
Electricity trade between Britain and France was exactly balanced, but still worth 
nearly £34 million this quarter. Since the interconnector between France and 
England was built, Britain has tended to import electricity from France. There have 
been periods when the power flows in the other direction, such as in Quarter 4 of 
2016 when many French nuclear reactors were offline for safety tests. This quarter, 
the flows were almost exactly in balance with 1.57 TWh going in each direction.
The complex pattern of flows (see chart below left) cannot be explained by looking 
at Britain alone. There is no correlation between the amount of power imported 
from France in each half hour and the level of electricity demand, wind and solar 
output, or wholesale electricity prices in Britain.
Flow are more strongly related to, but not completely explained by, the cross-
channel difference in day-ahead electricity prices (see chart below right). The blue 
points show ‘efficient arbitrage’ – times when electricity is bought cheap and sold 
expensive. These trades earned around £36 million over the quarter, less the cost 
of using the interconnector.
There are also many periods when power appears to flow the wrong way (shown in 
orange). 13% of Britain’s imports and 15% of exports were sent to a market where 
the price was at least £1/MWh lower than where the power came from. These 
wrong-way flows were smaller and less common, but still substantial. If the traders 
had bought and sold power in the two countries’ day-ahead markets, they would 
have lost £2.7 million, before deducting interconnector costs.
In practice, flows may have been agreed before the day-ahead prices were known. 
They may also be adjusted in response to real-time events that changed the 
situation after those prices were determined. National Grid sometimes have to 
counteract the profit-driven trades to preserve system security.

The relationship between power flow between Britain 
and France and the difference in day-ahead power price 
in each country. Profitable trades are shown in blue, loss-
making trades in red.
While the interconnector responds reasonably well to economic signals, does it 
respond to the system’s needs? There were eight half-hours with very high demand 
(over 50 GW) in which Britain exported power. This might be the ‘neighbourly thing 
to do’ if the French grid was under greater stress, but in four of those periods, the 
day-ahead prices suggest that traders would have lost money.
The interconnectors are taken into account in the government’s annual auctions 
for generating capacity. It would be silly to ignore them, but we should keep track 
of their actual ability to deliver electricity when required, as with any other power 
source. National Grid, as the electricity system operator, have the authority to 
directly control British generators if the situation calls for it. With interconnectors, 
power flows will follow the money.

7. Capacity and production statistics
This quarter saw wind output grow by 65% on this quarter last year, increasing its 
share of generation by 8 percentage points. This extra wind pushed down output 
from gas plants, which lost 6 percentage points of the mix versus Quarter 4 2016. 
Output from nuclear and biomass plants was lower than last year due to outages. 
Sizewell B went offline for statutory maintenance in November, and a small fire 
closed two biomass units at Drax in late December.
Coal supplied 3.5 GW averaged over the quarter, meaning the coal fleet ran at only 
¼ utilisation. At its peak though, four fifths of coal capacity ran simultaneously, 
producing 12.4 GW. The only new capacity to come online during 2017 was wind 
and solar farms. Over 4 GW of capacity was commissioned, bringing the total to 
almost 31 GW.
Power prices were stable and similar to last year, averaging £50/MWh over the 
quarter. Prices were negative for 15 hours, and there were no extraordinary price 
spikes. The marked reduction in volatility meant the highest price over the quarter 
was £178/MWh – down from £1500/MWh seen earlier in the year.
The year ended on a green note. Once again British electricity had its cleanest 
ever Christmas, as high winds combined with low demand, caused by Christmas 
Day being the second warmest on record (averaging 9.7°C). One third of electricity 
came from renewables, and one third from nuclear, meaning the carbon intensity 
ranged from just 72 g/kWh overnight up to 208 g/kWh at lunch time.
Installed capacity and electricity produced by each technology9
9 Other statistical sources give different values because of the types of plant they consider. For example, BEIS Energy Trends records an 
additional 900 MW of wind, 600 MW of biomass and 500 MW of solar, respectively producing 1.4, 1.2 and 0.2 TWh extra per quarter. These 
plants and their output are not visible to the electricity system and so cannot be reported on in Electric Insights.
