EXECUTIVE SUMMARY 
Drax Group plc is a large British energy company, encompassing three 
principal activities: generating electricity; providing electricity, gas and energy 
services to businesses; and processing compressed wood pellets for use in 
electricity production. 
Its main generation asset, Drax Power Station, is the largest in the UK, 
contributing six percent of all electricity production in the country. The 
station’s major decarbonisation project, that has taken place over recent years, 
has seen half of its six generation units converted to burn compressed wood 
pellets in place of coal. About two-thirds (65 percent) of its electricity output is 
now provided by these biomass units, a volume of energy that amounts to 
around 15 percent of the UK’s entire renewable electricity supplies in 2017.1 A 
fourth coal unit was converted to biomass in August 2018, which will further 
boost the proportion of its energy generated via renewable sources. 
Haven Power and Opus Energy are leading retail companies that are a 
part of Drax Group, and together supply energy to over 376,000 British 
business meters. These companies work to promote energy efficiency and 
sustainability among other businesses, including making 100% renewable 
power available to supply customers. 
Through its operations and investments, Drax Group supports a 
significant volume of employment and economic activity across the UK. 
This report quantifies Drax Group’s economic contribution in 2017, 
encompassing the direct, indirect and induced impact of the Group’s activities. 
In total, Drax Group’s operations contributed over £1.6 billion to UK GDP 
in 2017. This figure includes the value created by the Group’s production and 
supply of wholesale energy, the activity across the Group’s supply chain that is 
attributable to its demand for inputs, and the wages that its staff (and suppliers’ 
staff) spend in the wider consumer economy. 
One-quarter of this GDP impact, equivalent to £431 million, was generated 
in the Yorkshire and the Humber region, home of Drax Power Station. The 
Group also contributed a sizeable economic impact in the regions where Haven 
Power and Opus Energy are based. Their operations helped to generate a 
£658 million GDP impact (40 percent of the Group’s total in 2017) across the 
East Midlands, East of England, South East and Wales. 
In addition to these contributions to economic output, 17,500 jobs across 
the UK were supported by Drax Group in 2017. One-third of this 
employment impact, equivalent to 5,800 jobs, was felt in the north of England, 
highlighting the Group’s importance to employment across the region.

1. INTRODUCTION 
This report sets out the results of Oxford Economics’ assessment of Drax 
Group’s economic contribution to the UK during 2017. The report is the latest 
analysis in Oxford Economics’ programme of research for Drax Group, that has 
quantified the Group’s economic impact in both 2015 and 2016.2  
1.1 DRAX GROUP 
Drax Group is a large British energy company, that is helping to sustain the 
UK’s transition towards a low-carbon future. In recent years, half of Drax Power 
Station—a nationally significant energy asset—has been converted to use 
sustainably-sourced wood pellets instead of coal. In doing so, it has become 
the single largest source of renewable power in the country. A fourth coal unit 
was converted to biomass in August 2018, further elevating the power station’s 
status as the largest renewable generator in the UK. 
During 2017, Drax also acquired Opus Energy and consolidated this business 
into its operations. This consolidation allows Drax Group to expand its offer of 
renewable and sustainable power to small and medium-sized businesses 
across the UK. 
The Group’s three principal activities are generating electricity; supplying 
energy and energy services to businesses; and making compressed wood 
pellets for use in electricity production. Drax has several businesses working 
across the energy sector in the UK, that are considered in this report. We 
present results broken down into the following entities: 
• 
Drax Power, Drax’s generation business that owns and operates Drax 
Power Station in North Yorkshire. In our analysis, the activities of the 
Group’s head office are included within this entity; 
• 
Haven Power, a leading supplier of energy to industrial and 
commercial users; and 
• 
Opus Energy, one of the largest suppliers of energy to small and 
medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) in the UK.

METHODOLOGICAL OUTLINE 
Oxford Economics assessed the economic benefits of Drax Group using a standard means of 
analysis, called an economic impact assessment. Three ‘core’ channels of impact are 
considered: termed the direct, indirect and induced impact. These can be understood as 
follows: 
• 
Its direct impact relates to the Group’s own activities, such as the GDP it generates 
and its direct employment; 
• 
Its indirect impact encapsulates the activity and employment supported in the 
Group’s, or contractors’ supply chains as a result of their procurement of goods and 
services; and, 
• 
Its induced impact, comprising the wider economic benefits that arise when 
employees within the Group and contractors, and their supply chain spend their 
earnings, for example in local retail and leisure establishments. 
Fig. 1:  The channels of Drax Group’s economic impact 
 
These economic impacts can be measured in one of three ways: 
• 
GDP, or more specifically, the Group’s gross value added (GVA) contribution to 
GDP; 
• 
Employment meaning the number of people employed, measured on a headcount 
basis; and, 
• 
Tax revenue, the estimated fiscal contribution resulting from corporate activity and 
employment sustained by the Group. 
The calculations undertaken to quantify these impacts draw upon data supplied by Drax 
Group. The modelling is conducted using an Input-Output (I-O) based model of the UK 
economy, and regional modules describing the economies of its constituent nations and 
regions. This model was constructed by Oxford Economics, using macroeconomic, 
employment and tax data published by the Office for National Statistics (ONS) and HMRC.

2. RESULTS 
2.1 DIRECT IMPACT 
The activities of Drax Group contributed £355 million to UK GDP during 2017. 
This figure encompasses the gross profits it earned through its operations, and 
the gross wages paid to its workers. This figure represents an annual increase 
of 18 percent, relative to 2016.  
The Group also employed some 2,315 workers in 2017 throughout the UK, 
measured as the average of monthly employment levels during the year. 
Fig. 2: Direct impact of Drax Group, by entity, 2017 
 
In addition to these GVA and employment contributions, the Group directly 
generated around £98 million in tax revenues.  
This total is made up of Corporation Tax and business rates paid by the Group, 
and product-specific taxes (such as carbon costs and Waste Levy) levied on 
the Group’s activities. Also included are the labour taxes of its direct workforce, 
such as income tax, and employers’ and employees’ National Insurance 
Contributions (NICs).  
2.2 INDIRECT IMPACT 
The Group’s indirect impact on the UK economy is driven by its procurement of 
goods and services from other domestic businesses. In order to avert double-
counting, this indirect impact excludes the spending between the various 
entities of Drax Group.3 The economic benefits of this spending are already 
captured within the direct impact, discussed above. 
                                                      
3 During 2017, the Group completed the consolidation of Opus Energy. One consequence of this has been that 
many transactions (that would have otherwise driven some of the indirect impact), were replaced by intra-group 
transactions, thereby restraining the Group’s indirect impact, relative to 2016.

Drax Group’s external spending reached £2.4 billion in 2017, including 
£1.2 billion that was with UK-based suppliers.  
Fig. 3 (below) sets out the industries and geographies across which this 
external procurement was distributed. 
Fig. 3: Drax Group's total procurement expenditure, by sector, 2017 
 
In order to meet the intermediate demands of Drax Group, these businesses 
make purchases from their own suppliers, and so on down the supply chain. 
The sum of all these supply chain interactions produces the indirect impact, 
that ripples out across the regions and nations of the UK.  
The Group’s indirect impact supported £921 million in GVA during 2017, 
while supporting over 9,300 jobs throughout the UK. The Group’s indirect 
jobs contribution is four times as large as its direct employment, pointing 
towards the capital-intensive nature of its activities. This illustrates that Drax 
Group’s spending within the UK is with predominately with relatively more 
labour-intensive industries. Fig. 4 (overleaf) sets out the geographic distribution 
of the indirect GVA and employment impacts.

2.3 INDUCED IMPACT 
Drax Group paid £107 million in gross employee compensation during 
2017. This figure encompasses wages and salaries, pensions contributions, 
share-based payments and compensation costs (where relevant).  
This remuneration supported household consumption across all regions of the 
UK, as shown in Fig. 5 (overleaf). The following analysis rests upon the 
simplifying assumption that salary income is spent in the region where the 
recipient employee is resident.

Fig. 5: Gross salaries paid by Drax Group, by region of employee 
residence, 2017 
 
A portion of these salaries are spent in the consumer economy, for example in 
retail and leisure outlets. In addition, the wages paid to employees of firms 
within Drax Group’s supply chains also support further consumption spending. 
Further, in order to meet this induced demand, retail and leisure businesses 
draw upon their supply chains, producing a further supply-chain effect that is 
also a part of Drax Group’s induced impact. These factors explain why the 
Group’s induced impact is much broader (in geographic terms) than the 
distribution of its direct wage payments.  
We estimate that Drax Group’s induced GVA impact reached £373 million 
in 2017. Its induced impact also supported 5,800 jobs across all nations and 
regions of the UK, as illustrated in Fig. 6 (overleaf).  
This induced activity was also associated with tax revenues of £114 
million. This sum encompasses all the taxes on profits, wages and 
procurement discussed previously; while also including the VAT accrued as a 
result of Drax Group’s induced consumption impact.

2.4 TOTAL IMPACT 
By adding the three channels discussed above, we arrive at our estimates for 
the total impact of Drax Group’s activities during 2017. This can be considered 
the Group’s ‘footprint’ on the UK economy in that year.   
Fig. 7: Total impact of Drax Group, by entity, 2017 
 
We estimate that Drax Group’s activities generated around £1.6 billion in 
GVA during 2017, whilst supporting around 17,500 jobs. In doing so, the 
Group supported an estimated £387 million in revenues for the Exchequer.
