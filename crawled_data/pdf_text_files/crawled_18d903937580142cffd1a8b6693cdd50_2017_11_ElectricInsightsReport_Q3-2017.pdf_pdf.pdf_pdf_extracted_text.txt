This quarter’s issue looks at how Britain’s power system decarbonisation 
compares globally, and how it can be taken further. We unveil the international 
league table for low carbon electricity in Article 1, which charts the carbon 
intensity of electricity production across 33 countries. In the last four years, Britain 
has jumped 13 places to have the 7th cleanest major power system. 
National Grid released the world’s first grid carbon forecast: predicting the 
cleanest times to use electricity over the coming 48 hours. Article 2 looks at how 
this could underpin new services that enable people and businesses to shift when 
they consume electricity and lower their carbon emissions by up to 25%.
Article 3 charts the growing importance of imports: 9% of Britain’s electricity was 
generated overseas during July and August. But as we import electricity, we export 
emissions. Britain’s power system has decarbonised to the point that imports now 
raise the average carbon content of our electricity. Article 4 follows on by looking 
at the future of Britain’s interconnectors, and the regulatory uncertainty they face 
from exiting the European Union.
The last three months were relatively quiet for the power system after several 
records were broken in Quarter 2. The generation mix was unchanged, and coal 
output remained at historic lows (see Article 5). Low-carbon sources edged 
upwards slightly to 55% of the mix despite wind and solar output being down on 
last quarter (due to the weather), and a week of zero output from transmission-
connected biomass plants in September (due to maintenance). Prices were 
uneventful, with no spikes above £200/MWh, and only 13 hours with zero or 
negative prices. Article 6 rounds up the statistics for the quarter.

Electricity carbon intensity (g/kWh)
In its first year, Electric Insights charted the rapid changes that are cleaning up 
Britain’s power system. Carbon emissions from electricity halved in the last four 
years thanks to the growth of renewable energy, and the switch from coal to gas 
driven by the UK’s carbon price. But how does Britain’s power sector compare to 
other major countries?
We compiled data on the generation mix and the resulting carbon intensity of the 
world’s largest power systems, and rank them in the chart below. Britain’s pace of 
decarbonisation is unrivalled: the carbon intensity of electricity production has 
fallen more than twice as fast as any other major country.2 This comes as PwC 
report that the UK came top of their 2017 Low Carbon Economy Index.
The low carbon electricity league table
The low carbon electricity league table for 2012 and 2016.1  The 33 countries which produce over 100 TWh of electricity per year are ranked 
by their carbon intensity of production. Lines show countries which have moved by more than one place in the ranking.

The energy sector is conservative and usually slow to change as infrastructure has 
long lifetimes. While Britain’s carbon intensity halved, most other countries have 
only moved by 10% over the last four years.
In 2012, Britain was ranked 20th out of 33. In the four years since, Britain has 
jumped 13 places to become 7th. The most any other country has moved was 8 
places by the Netherlands – and that was in the wrong direction.
While coal generation in Britain fell 80% between 2012 and 2016, it rose by 40% in 
the Netherlands. Coal usage has increased in the Netherlands specifically as three 
new coal power stations were built there recently. Another thing that separates 
these countries is the Carbon Price Floor – Britain charges £23 per tonne of CO2 
versus just £5 per tonne on the continent. Weakening or scrapping the carbon 
price now could see Britain slide back down the table just as fast as it climbed.
Most countries in the ranking lie in the region of 400 to 600 g/kWh. Four years 
ago, Britain sat centrally among the mid-table countries from Italy to Saudi Arabia, 
which are powered by various mixes of coal, gas and nuclear, hydro and other 
renewables. India and South Africa have the dirtiest power sectors, powered by 
75–90% coal. The top six are all under 200 g/kWh, and are either mountainous 
countries blessed with substantial hydropower resources, or heavily rely on nuclear 
power (France has 58 reactors).3 
The make-up of the top six suggests it could be difficult for Britain’s electricity to 
decarbonise much further without a massive shift in either geography or opinion 
towards infrastructure megaprojects. Nonetheless, Britain’s example shows just 
what can be achieved in four years with a modest price on carbon emissions. 
2 
Britain’s carbon intensity fell by 241 g/kWh from 516 to 275 g/kWh. The next largest fall was 90 g/kWh in Australia (805 to 715 g/kWh). 
France and Sweden also registered large percentage decreases, but only fell by 21 and 5 g/kWh in absolute terms, as they started with 
such clean systems.
3 
Note that hydro output varies from year to year with the level of rainfall, hence these countries register large changes 
(in percentage terms) as more or less backup power from fossil fuels is required. 2012 was a wet year for Brazil, so its carbon intensity 
was unusually low, hence the higher carbon intensity in 2016.

The world’s first low-carbon electricity forecast enables people to use power when 
it is cleanest. In September, National Grid in partnership with Environmental Defense 
Fund Europe and WWF launched the carbon intensity forecast, a website that 
estimates the CO2 emissions from consuming electricity over the coming 48 hours. 
This combines National Grid and Met Office data to forecast the generation mix, 
and the Electric Insights methodology to estimate the resulting carbon emissions.4 
Carbon intensity data is estimated every half hour, with an accuracy typically 
better than ±10%, depending on the weather and forecast errors in demand, wind 
and solar generation. 
Turning this information into real-world carbon savings requires people and 
businesses to be flexible on when they run their appliances (from washing 
machines and electric vehicles to steel furnaces). The unreliable British weather 
makes it hard enough to plan when to do the laundry – and very few people 
will have the time and dedication to routinely check the ‘carbon forecast’ as 
well. National Grid therefore provide their forecast through an API5 that allows 
developers to build new apps and products to help people and firms optimise when 
to use electricity. Just as the ‘internet of things’ means you can now automate 
your home’s heating and lighting, soon you may also be able to control your carbon 
footprint without thinking about it.

It is challenging to estimate the size of ‘the prize’: how much carbon could be 
saved from people changing when they consume electricity. On the individual level, 
delaying your consumption reduces the output of a flexible ‘marginal’ generator at 
one time, but increases output from another generator later on. This is likely to be 
a similar flexible generator (probably gas-fired), as changing when you wash your 
clothes will not affect when the wind blows.
However, widespread load-shifting across the country would allow low-carbon 
baseload generators to have longer running hours, and mean less need for diesel 
and coal peaking plants. It would also smooth out power prices between peak 
and off-peak times, reducing trading risk for all market participants. Ultimately, 
this could allow the system to absorb more intermittent renewable energy, thus 
lowering emissions.
In the long-term, if load shifting altered the average grid mix, this service could 
lower the carbon emissions from electricity consumption by up to a quarter. The 
historic Electric Insights data lets us estimate what a perfectly flexible consumer 
could save by delaying their consumption until the lowest-carbon period. Being 
flexible over 12 hours would allow electricity to be consumed with 14% lower 
carbon intensity on average. Extend this to 48 hours and the saving is 25%. These 
savings are growing as the carbon intensity of Britain’s electricity swings more 
widely with renewables output.

Importing electricity, exporting emissions?
Imports of electricity into Britain are at record highs: 9% of the electricity we 
used in July and August was generated overseas. Debates around energy imports 
normally focus on oil from the Middle East or gas from Russia6; however, electricity 
from Europe is becoming ever more significant. In Q3, Britain sourced 5.6 TWh of 
electricity from abroad, enough to power 7.2 million homes. 60% of this came from 
France, 30% from the Netherlands and 10% from the island of Ireland.
Even though a smaller share comes from Ireland and the Netherlands, they rely 
heavily on fossil fuels. So much so that Britain’s imports had a 30% higher carbon 
intensity than locally generated power (314 vs 245 g/kWh over the last twelve 
months). It is unclear whether these imports actually raised global CO2 emissions 
though. We could not have increased output from wind, solar, biomass and nuclear 
instead of importing; the extra electricity would likely have come from coal and gas. 
Imports are expected to become a larger part of the mix in future as more links to 
France, Norway and Denmark are built. National Grid anticipate that we could import 
10–24% of our electricity in just five years’ time. We need to ensure this supports the 
continuing decarbonisation of electricity, rather than simply ‘offshoring’ our emissions.

Electricity imports grow ever more important, yet several questions hang over the future of 
Britain’s interconnectors: not least the impacts of Brexit. The UK is part of Europe’s internal 
energy market (IEM) which allows prices to determine how power flows between countries. 
This future is unclear as participation is based on membership of the European single 
market, and no specific trade rules have been announced for the post-Brexit energy sector.7  
Leaving the IEM would revert us back to less efficient interconnector trading. 
Uneconomic trades (buying dear, selling cheap) could occur up to 20% of the 
time8, leading to higher consumer bills9. Also, the UK has been the fourth highest 
recipient of European funds for energy infrastructure, with its interconnectors 
being awarded 17 out of 195 EU Projects of Common Interest (PCIs) and 12% 
(£100m) from the European Energy Programme for Recovery (EEPR). 
7 GW of new interconnector capacity is planned to be built over the next 5 years, 
almost tripling the current 4 GW of links (see figure, left). These will provide greater 
flexibility as weather-dependent renewable sources continue to grow, and greater 
security of supply whilst coal and nuclear capacity is rapidly retiring. British 
consumers have arguably benefitted from lower bills as our exporting neighbours 
have 20% lower electricity prices (see figure, below). Together, these benefits are 
predicted to reach £500 million per year by 202010.

However, this has led to Britain importing high-carbon electricity from Dutch and 
Irish generators. Overseas fossil-fuel generators benefit from an uneven playing 
field in two ways. British power stations must pay the Carbon Price Floor 
(£18 per tonne of CO2) on top of the £5/tCO2 European ETS price paid by imported 
electricity. This disadvantage for British power stations will diminish if and when 
the ETS price strengthens. Applying a levelling border tax on electricity would 
be administratively difficult, and so Britain’s price floor should be maintained to 
continue our decarbonisation objective. 
Secondly, British generators pay to access the national grid (via TNUoS 
charges)13, but imported electricity does not. These charges pay for transmission 
infrastructure, and could instead be paid directly by electricity consumers so 
that generators don’t face different charges depending on their nationality. This 
may prove easier than requiring European generators to pay TNUoS charges, as 
it is unlikely the EU would allow a single country to levy charges on European 
generators. 
Together these exemptions give European generators an estimated £10/MWh 
advantage over domestic generators, around a fifth of the market price. The UK 
must therefore come up with a feasible way to ensure electricity flows efficiently 
between borders to keep down costs and carbon emissions. If the markets either 
side of an interconnector have different charging arrangements, the outcome 
cannot be efficient.

Coal generation remained historically low with just a 1.9% share of generation 
over the summer. Between April and August Britain’s 14 GW of coal stations 
produced just 0.6 GW on average. This rose to 1.4 GW in September as demand 
started rising, suggesting that coal is now practically a winter-only fuel used to 
meet peak demand.
Averaged over this quarter, only 6% of the installed coal capacity was used. 
However, on the 19th of September 40% of the coal fleet was called upon to 
produce 5.7 GW. This highlights the need to retain spare capacity for times of peak 
demand.
Britain’s mix of installed capacity and its production have evolved dramatically 
over the last eight years (see below). Part of coal’s decline is due to the wave 
of retirements over the last five years. Coal capacity fell from 28 GW in 2012 to 
14 GW in 2016, either because plants reached the end of their lifetime, became 
uneconomical, or were forced to close because of clean air legislation.
The amount of controllable capacity (which can be dispatched when needed) has 
fallen by 20 GW since its peak in 2012, despite total capacity having increased 
since then. The difference in scale between capacity and output is most obvious 
for renewables. The 28 GW of installed wind and solar capacity produces less 
energy than the 9 GW of installed nuclear power.

It was an uneventful three months for Britain’s power system, looking very similar 
to Quarter 2. Low carbon sources continued to supply more electricity than fossil 
fuels, generating 33.5 TWh over the quarter, compared to 30 TWh from gas and 
coal. Coal formed less than 3% of generation over the quarter. 4 in 5 days saw more 
output from wind than coal, more from solar than coal, and more from biomass 
than coal.
The share of low-carbon generation reached a new high of 55.0%, slightly up from 
54.7% in Quarter 2. Output from all renewable sources was up on last year, with 
wind and biomass both increasing by over 30%. 
Demand was unchanged from this quarter last year, marking a brief pause in the 
1–2% annual decline seen since 2005. Temperatures were 1.3ºC lower than this 
time last year, prompting more demand from electric heating.
Electricity consumption resulted in carbon emissions of 13.6 million tonnes of CO2, 
of which 1.3 Mt were produced abroad. The carbon intensity of electricity averaged 
202 g/kWh, one-fifth lower than the average over the last twelve months. Total 
emissions are down from 15.0 Mt in Q3 last year, and 22.2 Mt the year before. The 
lowest instantaneous carbon intensity was 95 g/kWh, and 250 hours had a carbon 
intensity of below 150 g/kWh.

14 Other statistical sources give different values because of the types of plant they consider. For example, BEIS Energy Trends 
records an additional 900 MW of wind, 600 MW of biomass and 500 MW of solar, respectively producing 1.4, 1.2 and 0.2 TWh 
extra per quarter. These plants and their output are not visible to the electricity system and so cannot be reported on here.
15 These are the raw values from National Grid and Elexon, and may differ from other sources (such as BEIS or DUKES) due to 
which farms are included in the data and the estimation of installed capacity.
