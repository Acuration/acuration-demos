Regulations 2009 
Notice of acceptance of an application for a Development Consent Order to construct, operate and maintain the Progress Power 
Project, former Eye airfield, Eye, Mid Suffolk, England 
Planning Inspectorate reference: EN010060 
The DCO Application for the Project 
 
1. 
Notice is hereby given that the  Secretary of State for Energy and Climate Change has accepted an application for a Development Consent Order (“DCO”) made by Progress Power Limited 
(“PPL”) of 33 Cavendish Square, London W1G 0PW under the Planning Act 2008 (the "Application"). The Application was submitted to the Secretary of State (via the Planning Inspectorate) 
on Monday 31st March 2014 and accepted for examination on Friday 25th April 2014. The reference number applied by the Planning Inspectorate, on behalf of the Secretary of State, to the 
Application is EN010060. 
 
2. 
The Application seeks consent for the construction, operation and maintenance of a new gas fired thermal generating station of up to 299MW and integral electrical and gas connections on 
land at the former Eye airfield, Eye, Mid Suffolk, England in the County of Suffolk and within the administrative boundary of Mid Suffolk District Council (the "Project”). 
 
3. 
The Project comprises the following elements: 
 
a. 
The Power Generation Plant - a simple cycle gas turbine gas fired ‘peaking’ power generating plant. To generate up to 299 MW, between 1 and 5 gas turbine generators would be used, 
each with its own emission flue stack between 25m and 30m in height. The Power Generation Plant would include the gas turbine generators; a banking compound; a natural gas receiving 
station and gas treatment compound; a black start generator; water tanks; and support buildings, structures and equipment. 
b. 
The Electrical Connection – a new underground electrical cable connection to export electricity from the Power Generation Plant into the National Electricity Transmission System (the 
Cable). This would be composed of a new underground cable circuit connection of approximately 1.6 kilometres, and a new Access Road, with a new road junction off the A140 (the A140 
Junction), and a new Electrical Connection Compound comprising of a new substation and sealing end compound.  
c. 
The Gas Connection - a new underground gas pipeline connection to bring natural gas to the Power Generation Plant from the existing high pressure gas network National Transmission 
System located off Potash Lane. The Gas Connection would include an Above Ground Installation comprising of a Pipeline Inspection Gauge ("PIG") Trap Facility alongside a Minimum 
Offtake Connection, and an approximately 1.7 kilometre gas pipeline laid to the gas receiving installation within the Power Generation Plant. 
4. 
The Power Generation Plant, together with the integral Gas Connection and Cable, form the nationally significant infrastructure project, with associated development comprising the Electrical 
Connection Compound, Access Road and A140 Junction. 
 
5. 
The DCO will, if granted, authorise the construction, operation and maintenance of the Project and would, amongst other things, make provision for the following:  
 
a. 
Tree and hedge removal along the routes of the Electrical Connection and the Gas Connection. 
b. 
Replacement and compensatory planting, landscaping and ecological mitigation. 
c. 
The temporary prohibition or restriction of use of public footpaths during the construction works described above. 
d. 
Creation of new permanent accesses from the highway network for the Project, modification of existing accesses and creation of other temporary accesses along with temporary lane 
closures and streetworks. 
e. 
The permanent and temporary compulsory acquisition of land and rights in land for the Project. 
f. 
Overriding of easements and other rights over or affecting land for the Project. 
g. 
The application and/or disapplication of legislation relevant to the Project. 
h. 
Such ancillary, incidental and consequential works (including demolition), provisions, permits consents, waivers or releases as are necessary and/or convenient for the successful 
construction, operation and maintenance of the Project. 
 
6. 
Due to its nature and size the Project is classified as EIA development under the Infrastructure Planning (Environmental Impact Assessment) Regulations 2009. The Application is accompanied 
by an Environmental Statement.
