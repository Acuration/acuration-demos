Millbrook Power Design & Access Statement
Introduction
01.  Introduction
1.1. 
This document is the Design and Access Statement 
for the Millbrook Power Project. It has been prepared 
by Sheppard Robson on behalf of Millbrook Power 
Limited (MPL). 
1.2. 
MPL are promoting a new thermal generating station 
(hereafter referred to as the Power Generation Plant) 
on land at Rookery South Pit located approximately 2 
km to the east of the A421 which connects directly to 
Junction 13 of the M1 Motorway, approximately 6 km 
to the south west of the Project Site.  
1.3. 
The Power Generation Plant would operate as a 
Open Cycle Gas Turbine (OCGT) peaking plant and 
would be  designed to  provide an  electrical output 
of up to 299 Megawatts (MW). The plant would be 
fuelled by natural gas.  
1.4. 
The 
three 
main 
elements 
of 
the 
Millbrook 
Power 
Project 
comprise:  
A new Power Generation Plant, a OCGT  gas  fired 
power generating station fuelled by natural gas 
capable of providing up to 299 MW. The Power 
Generation Plant incorporates: 
• 
Generating Equipment including one Gas 
Turbine Generator with one exhaust gas flue 
stack and Balance of Plant (together referred 
to as the ‘Generating Equipment’), which are 
located within the ‘Generating Equipment Site’;
• 
A new purpose built access road from Green 
Lane to the Generating Equipment Site (the 
‘Access Road’);
• 
A temporary construction compound required 
during construction only (the ‘Laydown Area’). 
1.5. 
A new underground gas pipeline connection, 
approximately 1.8 km in length (the ‘Pipeline’) to bring 
natural gas to the Generating Equipment from the 
National Transmission System (the ‘Gas Connection’). 
The Gas Connection also incorporates an Above 
Ground Installation (AGI) at the point of connection to 
the National Transmission System; and
1.6. 
A new electrical connection to export power from 
the Generating Equipment to the National Grid 
Electricity Transmission System (NETS) (the ‘Electrical 
Connection’), comprising an underground double 
circuit Tee-in. This would require one new tower 
(which will replace an existing tower and be located 
in the existing Grendon – Sundon transmission route 
corridor, thereby resulting in no net additional towers). 
This option would require two SECs, one located on 
each side of the existing transmission line, and both 
circuits would then be connected via underground 
cables approximately 500 m in length to a new 
substation (the ‘Substation’).
1.7. 
The Generating Equipment, Access Road and 
Laydown Area are together known as the ‘Power 
Generation Plant’ and are located within the ‘Power 
Generation Plant Site’. The Power Generation Plant 
Site is approximately 12.5 ha in area. 
1.8. 
The Power Generation Plant, Gas Connection, 
and Electrical Connection, together with all access 
requirements are referred to as the ‘Project’. The 
land upon which the Project would be developed, 
or which would be required in order to facilitate the 
development of the Project, is referred to as the 
‘Project Site’. The Project Site is approximately 48 
ha in area.
1.9. 
A glossary of defined terms is presented in Document 
Reference 1.4.
1.10. 
Millbrook Power Limited 
 
The Applicant for the Project is MPL, an energy 
development company established for the Project 
and recently acquired by Drax Group PLC (Drax).
1.11. 
Drax is responsible for generating 7% of the UKs 
electricity, predominantly via Drax power station 
in Selby.  Drax is one of the UK’s largest energy 
producers and is committed to helping to reduce 
carbon emissions, displacing more coal off the 
system and providing additional system support to 
plug the gaps created by intermittent renewables and 
boost security of supply. 
1.12. 
MPL is committed to the development of assets to 
support the UK Government’s drive to a low carbon 
economy.  MPL recognises the need to balance 
commercial issues with the environmental benefits 
and concerns relating to energy projects and 
believes this balance can be responsibly delivered. 
The Project would be designed and developed to 
high quality, safety and environmental standards.

1.14. 
Policy background 
 
Decisions on energy Nationally Significant Infrastructure 
Projects (NSIPs), such as the Project, are made in 
accordance with Section 104 of the Planning Act 
2008 which provides that in making decisions on 
DCO applications, the Secretary of State (SoS) must 
have regard to any relevant NPS and must decide 
applications in accordance with it unless the adverse 
impacts of the proposal would outweigh its benefits (or 
in certain other limited circumstances).
1.15. 
National Policy Statements (NPS)  
NPS EN-1 - The Overarching National Policy Statement 
for Energy is a relevant NPS for any  energy NSIP, 
along with the relevant technology specific NPS. For 
the DCO Application this includes NPS EN-2 National 
Policy  Statement  for  Fossil  Fuel Electricity Generating 
Infrastructure. The Gas Connection and Electrical 
Connection are below the relevant size thresholds to 
be categorised as NSIPs themselves. These elements 
are associated  development, so are included in the 
Application. Accordingly, NPS EN-4 and EN-5 are likely 
to be important and relevant in the determination of the 
application in respect of these components.
1.16. 
NPS EN-1 recognises that there is a significant need for 
new energy infrastructure (paragraphs 3.3.7 to 3.3.9).

Introduction
01.  Introduction
1.17. 
NPS EN-1 considers that energy NSIPs should 
demonstrate ‘good design’ and defines this in 
section 4.5.1 as being able to produce “sustainable 
infrastructure sensitive to place, efficient in the 
use of natural resources and energy used in 
their construction and operation, matched by an 
appearance that demonstrates good aesthetic as far 
as possible”. 
1.18. 
It is acknowledged that the nature of much energy 
infrastructure development will often limit the extent 
to which it can contribute to the enhancement of the 
quality of the area.
1.19. 
It is stated at paragraph 4.5.3 that the SoS shall 
need to be satisfied that “energy infrastructure 
developments are sustainable and, having regard to 
regulatory and other constraints, are as attractive, 
durable and adaptable (including taking account of 
natural hazards such as flooding) as they can be 
… (and) that the applicant has taken into account 
both functionality (including fitness for purpose 
and sustainability) and aesthetics (including its 
contribution to the quality of the area in which it would 
be located) as far as possible”. 
1.20. 
Paragraph 4.5.3 acknowledges that “whilst the 
applicant may not have any or very limited choice 
in the physical appearance of some energy 
infrastructure, there may be opportunities for the 
applicant to demonstrate good design in terms 
of siting relative to existing landscape character, 
landform and vegetation”.
1.21. 
The Secretary of State seeks that applicants 
“demonstrate in their application documents how 
the design process was conducted and how 
the proposed design evolved” and explain the 
operational, safety and security requirements which 
the design has to satisfy.
1.22. 
Paragraph 4.5.5 advises that applicants consider 
“taking independent professional advice on the design 
aspects of a proposal” such as Design Review.
1.23. 
Specific guidance on good design for fossil fuel 
generating stations is provided in NPS EN-2, 
including that “applicants should demonstrate good 
design particularly in respect of landscape and 
visual amenity (…) and in the design of the project 
to mitigate impacts such as noise and vibration, 
transport impacts and air emissions.” (Paragraph 
2.3.16).  
 
 
 
 
  
 
 
1.24. 
Requirement and Purpose  
The requirement for Design and Access Statements 
is set out in the Department for Communities & 
Local Government (DCLG) guidance and information

requirements and validation (March 2010) – a 
response to the need to deliver better quality and 
more sustainable development through the planning 
system. 
1.25. 
The guidance sets out the role of the Design and 
Access Statement as being to illustrate the process 
that has led to the Project and to explain the proposals 
in a structured way.
1.26. 
The purpose of this Design and Access Statement 
is, in accordance with NPS EN-1 and NPS EN-2, to 
assist the Secretary of State and others in:
• 
Understanding the site and its neighbourhood 
and wider context;
• 
Understanding the process that has led to 
the chosen design; and 
• 
How the proposals have been designed to 
be attractive, durable, adaptable, functional, 
and minimise visual intrusion. 
1.27. 
This statement should be read in conjunction with 
the submitted plans, Planning Statement (Document 
Reference 10.1), and Environmental Statement 
(Document Reference 6.1), which also accompany 
the Application. The Planning Statement describes 
the background to this Application in further detail.
1.28. 
Consultation 
 
The Planning Act 2008 requires developers to consult 
certain prescribed bodies and the local community.  
1.29. 
In this regard, the development of the Project has 
undergone extensive consultation with stakeholders, 
some of which has resulted in changes to the design 
and development of the Project. 
1.30. 
Document Structure  
 
This Statement is set out as follows:
• 
Chapter 2: Appreciating the Wider Context 
set out an assessment of the Project Site’s 
wider context, connection with the wider 
landscape and the local areas of Millbrook 
and other surrounding villages. This will be 
described in terms of Built Form and Visual 
Structure; Movement and Connections; and 
Landscape and Ecology. 
• 
Chapter 3: Site Setting sets out a more 
detailed focus of the site and immediate 
surroundings of Rookery South Pit, described 
in terms of Built Form and Visual Structure; 
Movement and Connections; and Landscape 
and Ecology. 
• 
Chapter 4: Design Response sets out key 
design principles which inform the proposals 
for the site.  
 
 
• 
Chapter 5: Indicative Development Proposals 
presents 2D and 3D illustrations of the 
proposed scheme with a detailed description 
of use and amount, layout and access, scale 
and massing, landscape and appearance.
• 
Chapter 6: sets out the Summary & 
Conclusions of the Statement. 
 
1.31. 
The key factors for consideration when selecting a 
suitable site for the Project were broadly fourfold: 
technical, environmental, economic and whether the 
location of the development site would be in line with 
local planning policy. 
1.32. 
Technical & Economic Considerations  
 
The site selection process began in 2010. A range 
of sites around the UK were looked at in order to 
find suitable locations to support power generation

Introduction
01.  Introduction : Why Millbrook
plants of this nature. The search focused on areas 
that would meet the following key strategic criteria: 
• 
Acceptable 
proximity 
to 
the 
National 
Transmission System and NETS or local 
distribution networks;
• 
Located within areas that are net importers 
of electricity; 
• 
Located within areas of compatible land use 
designation/s;
• 
Size of site suitable to support a power 
generation plant of up to 299 MW, as well 
as infrastructure such as gas and electrical 
connection
1.33. 
Environmental Considerations 
 
From an environmental perspective, during the 
site selection process MPL has to consider the 
location of the site in relation to sensitive receptors 
such as residential properties or sites of ecological 
importance (to avoid unacceptable impacts such as 
those from noise and visual disturbance, or air quality 
impacts), the current nature of the surrounding area 
(to limit impacts on the landscape character of the 
area), previous site uses and land quality (to avoid 
sterilisation of the best and most versatile agricultural 
land or mineral assets) and proximity to sensitive 
ecological habitats.
1.34. 
Other Sites 
 
Drax is bringing forward three other similar power 
generation projects. They are: Progress Power Ltd at 
Eye Airfield in  Suffolk, which received Development 
Consent in July 2015 (www.progresspower.co.uk): 
Hirwaun Power Ltd at Hirwaun in South Wales, 
which received Development Consent in July 2015 
(www.hirwaunpower. co.uk): and Abergelli Power 
Ltd at Abergelli in South Wales, which is in the pre 
application phase of the Planning Act 2008 process 
(www.abergellipower.co.uk).
1.35. 
Project Site 
 
Based on these site considerations, a number of 
reasons meant that Rookery South Pit was selected 
as a suitable location for the Project. 
• 
Close proximity to gas National Transmission 
System – both National Transmission System 
feeder 7 and National Transmission System 
feeder 9.
• 
Close proximity to a suitable electrical 
connection – the existing Grendon to Sundon 
400kV overhead line.
• 
In a location with adequate space to develop 
the Power Generation Plant, and gas and 
electrical connection infrastructure.
• 
Located within previously developed land.
• 
Lies below ground level which is useful in 
screening the Project. 
• 
Located within an area identified as being 
potentially suitable for energy infrastructure.
• 
Situated in an area with a well-developed 
road network.
• 
Located outside of areas at risk of flooding. 
• 
Located in an area which is a net importer of 
electricity signifying existing demand for this 
type of development. 
1.36. 
More discussion about site selection can be found in 
the Environmental Statement (Document Reference 
6.1), chapter 5 ‘Alternatives Considered’, as well as 
Planning Statement (Document Reference 10.1).

Millbrook Power Design & Access Statement
2.1  Appreciation of Wider Context
2.1.1. This chapter describes the Project Site at two spatial 
scales of context. Initially from a historic context 
and then, an overview of the Project Site’s wider, 
strategic context along with consideration of the site’s 
immediate context described under the headings of:
• 
Built form and visual structure;
• 
Movement and connections; and
• 
Landscape.
2.1.2. A number of emerging principles will be identified 
at this spatial scale and will be taken forward to 
influence the key design principles for the Project Site 
described in chapter 4.
2.1.3. Strategic setting  
The Power Generation Plant Site and part of the Gas 
and Electrical Connections would be situated on 
land within former clay pits known as ‘The Rookery’, 
covering an area of some 210ha, and situated in the 
Marston Vale between Milton Keynes and Bedford, 
approximately 3km north-west of Ampthill, and 7km 
south west of Bedford.
2.1.4. The Rookery is situated within a post-industrial 
landscape, which is presently undergoing significant 
change. It comprises two large former clay pits, 
Rookery North and Rookery South Pits, separated 
by an east-west spine of unexcavated clay. The 
Generating Equipment Site, Laydown Area and 
parts of the Access Road and Gas and Electrical 
Connections would be located within Rookery 
South Pit which is approximately 95ha and is bound 
by steep clay banks that are varied in nature and 
substrate. Part of the Access Road would lie within 
Rookery North Pit.
2.1.5. Road access to the Power Generation Plant Site is 
currently from the north near Stewartby via the A421, 
Bedford Road and Green Lane. There is a junction 
on Green Lane leading to an access track which 
extends southwards into Rookery South Pit and the 
Generating Equipment Site. The Gas and Electrical 
Connections would be primarily accessed from the 
A421, northwards along the A5141, westwards then 
southwards for approximately 7km along the B530 
(referred to variously along its route as Ampthill Road 
/ Hardwick Road / Bedford Road / Hazlewood Lane) 
to Millbrook Road, Houghton Lane then (in the case 
of the Electrical Connection) Station Lane. 
2.1.6. The Gas and Electrical Connection would be located 
largely outside of Rookery South Pit, within a mostly 
undeveloped agricultural landscape which includes 
areas of woodland, native hedgerows and a number 
of water-bodies such as ditches.
2.1.7. Nearby roads include the A421 which is approximately 
2km to the west and the B530 which lies to the 
east of the Project Site. The A421 connects directly 
to Junction 13 of the M1 Motorway which is 
approximately 5.6km to the south west of the Project 
Site. Furthermore the Midland Mainline Railway and 
Marston Vale Line border the Power Generation Plant 
Site to the east and west respectively. 
2.1.8. The closest residential dwelling to the Power 
Generation Plant Site is South Pillinge Farm, located 
approximately 130m to the west of the Project Site 
boundary. South Pillinge Farm is separated from the 
Project Site by a small deciduous woodland. To the 
north of Green Lane and The Rookery lies Stewartby. 
Other 
neighbouring 
residential 
areas 
include: 
Houghton Conquest approximately 1.5km to the 
east of the Project Site boundary; Marston Moretaine 
approximately 1.2km to the west; and Millbrook 
approximately 400m to the south. 
2.1.9. To the west of the Project Site is Marston Vale 
Millennium Country Park, which provides habitat 
conservation opportunities, indoor and outdoor 
community amenities and a wind turbine. There is also 
a Forest Centre within the Marston Vale Millennium 
Country Park located just to the south of Stewartby 
Lake which provides the focal point for the indoor 
and outdoor community amenities. Millbrook Proving 
Ground, a vehicle testing ground, is located to the 
south west of the Electrical Connection.

2.2  Appreciation of Wider Context
2.2.1. Landscape Character 
 
The Project is located within the North Marston Clay 
Vale, a large-scale landscape with a low-lying, flat 
landform providing distant views in all directions.
2.2.2. To the south of the Clay Vale lies an elevated 
wooded, mixed greensand/sandstone escarpment 
the Greensand Ridge, to the west is the Milton 
Keynes Clayland Fringe used predominately as 
farmland. These elevated landscapes form prominent 
backdrops and offer a sense of containment.
2.2.3. The 
North 
Marston 
Clay 
Vale 
landscape 
is 
characterised 
by 
large 
geometric 
field 
units 
with variable field boundaries including remnant 
hedgerows, scrubby margins and drainage channels. 
Mature woodland is relatively scarce, the area does 
contain Marston Thrift SSSI, a nationally important 
ancient ash / maple woodland site and other areas 
of ancient woodland with Wootton Wood, forming 
the heart of The Forest of Marston Vale. The North 
Marston Clay Vale has several dominant land uses:
• 
Arable farming contained within large open 
fields, 
• 
Large scale clay extraction for the brick 
making industry,
• 
Areas of landscape restoration notably the 
flooded clay pits forming a series of lakes, 
• 
The ongoing establishment of the Forest of 
Marston Vale, 
• 
Areas of landfill.
2.2.4. Historically the Clay Vale’s extensive extraction 
supported the areas brick work industry leading to 
extensive disturbance of the landscape and providing 
a strong industrial character. The Vale is currently in 
the process of large scale restoration of previous 
extraction sites to create new landscape features in 
the environment. 
2.2.5. The agricultural landscape is further fragmented 
by current and former industrial activity including 
open cast clay pits, landfill, distribution centres 
and industrial estates. The most visibly prominent 
industrial features are the line of Stewartby Brick 
work chimney stacks to the North of the Project Site 
and further out, the airship sheds at Shortstown and 
large distribution warehouses south of Bedford. Lines 
of pylons cut across the landscape and are highly 
visible extending from the Greensand Ridge.
2.2.6. The Forest of Marston Vale stretching between 
Bedford, Ampthill and Milton Keynes is one of 12 
Community Forests in England. Flooded clay pits 
form a series of lakes throughout the vale providing 
valuable ecological, recreational and landscape 
resources such as at Stewartby Country Park. 
2.2.7. A number of busy transport routes cut north south 
through the landscape including the M1, A421(T) the 
A6 and two railway lines, the Marston Vale Line and 
Midland Mainline. Both have an audible and visual 
presence in the landscape.
2.2.8. Bedford, on the northern boundary, brings strong 
urban fringe characteristics to the landscape - large 
scale industrial estates/retail parks south of Kempston 
typifying views to the town. Settlement occurs across 
the Vale, often associated with minor tributary valley, 
characterised by a mix of building age, style and 
materials. Significant late 20th century development 
has resulted in the coalescence of settlement as at 
Wootton and Marston Moretaine.
2.2.9. By contrast to the North Marston Clay Vale, the 
elevated landscape of the Greensand Ridge, to 
the south, has a more intact and static character. 
The key defining features include a strong wooded 
context with extensive areas of deciduous woodland, 
mixed woodland and coniferous plantations; a strong 
underlying heathland character; a large number of 
historic parks and gardens, with parkland forming a 
dominant land use influencing the wider landscape; 
and far-reaching, clear views across the low clay 
Vale.
2.2.10. The western and northern limits of the ridge are 
dominated by intensive farmed arable land, though 
important features such as blocks of ancient 
woodland, valleys and streams are also found. This 
landscape is in a state of transition, exemplified by 
significant development at Cranfield together with the 
development of roads, pylon lines and the frequent 
occurrence of other ‘fringe’ land uses.

2.3  History of Wider Context
Houghton House
Amphill Park House
2.3.1. The rapid expansion of the brick industry in the 
20th century affected the settlement pattern of the 
Vale, but it is still possible to identify older (medieval) 
villages at Wootton, Marston Moretaine, Houghton 
Conquest and Lidlington. 
2.3.2. All of the villages have been greatly enlarged by 20th 
century house building, but there is a small historic 
core to each settlement. Only Church End, Wootton 
and Stewartby are designated as Conservation Areas 
within the immediate vicinity of the Project Site. The 
villages are associated with medieval churches, many 
of which are Grade I or II* Listed which tend to be 
located on the edge of the village with towers that 
form local landmarks in the Vale. A number of smaller 
hamlets and isolated farmsteads certain remnants 
of medieval moated sites, some designated as 
Scheduled Monuments. Others have Grade II and II* 
Listed farmhouses. 
2.3.3. Key cultural heritage assets of relevance to the design 
of the Project comprise:
A. 
Ampthill Park - lies to the south east of the MPL 
project site and is a Grade II Registered landscape 
located on the north side of Ampthill and extends 
from the crest of the ridge down into the Vale. The 
park encompasses Ampthill Castle, (a Scheduled 
Monument, which is now marked by an 18th century 
memorial cross to Katherine of Aragon (Grade II 
Listed). The Park is now a public park; 
B. 
Ampthill Park House - lies to the south east of the 
Project Site and is a Grade II* Listed building located 
towards the foot of the scarp with views over the vale 
to the north-west. The house is now detached from 
the surviving portions of its 18th century designed 
landscape of the Park and is a private house in 
multiple ownership. The house overlooks the Project 
Site at a lower elevation than Ampthill Park;
C. 
Millbrook Village - lies to the west of Ampthill 
Park and is a Conservation Area. The village has 
good examples of estate houses built for the Duke 
of Bedford which are strung along the main village 
road. The medieval church (Grade II* Listed) is sited 
in a prominent high point above the village and is a 
landmark on the scarp when viewed from the Vale 
below. The northern end of the main village road 
joins Station Road and looks towards the Project Site 
across intervening undulating farmland;
D. 
Houghton House - lies to the east of the Project 
Site and is a Grade I Listed building and a Scheduled 
Monument and was built in the early 17th century 
as a hunting lodge and survived until 1794 when it 
was partially dismantled. The house is located in a 
commanding position just below the crest of the ridge 
with north-facing views over the Vale. The house is 
a publicly accessible monument and overlooks the 
Project Site;

2.3  History of Wider Context
2.3.4. Of particular local importance is Stewartby Brick 
Works and the four remaining chimneys to the west 
of the village. The chimneys and two Hoffman Kilns of 
the former brickworks are Grade II Listed. 
2.3.5. Other listed buildings in close proximity to the Project 
Site include South Pillinge Farm (Grade II Listed). 
2.3.6. The decommissioned conveyor over the Marston 
Vale Line has been partially demolished.
2.3.7. The proximity of the cultural heritage assets identified 
has been a major influence driving the design of the 
Project giving consideration to siting of buildings, 
landscape integration strategy and building design. 
In many instances the design of the Project has been 
tested during the iterative process in assessment 
view points from these cultural assets.
2.3.8. The excavation of the pit has led to the destruction of 
assets where clay extraction occurred.
2.3.9. Within the Rookery, evidence of past land uses 
remain in the form of brick piles and other detritus, 
and include parts of the decommissioned conveyor 
which previously crossed the Marston Vale Line to 
the north west of Rookery North Pit.
2.3.10. These cultural heritage assets referred to above did 
not significantly affect the development of the Project. 
2.3.11. All designated and undesignated cultural heritage 
assets within a 3km radius of the Project Site together 
with selective sites of greatest cultural heritage 
merit within a 10km radius of the site are illustrated 
opposite.
E. 
Stewartby - lies to the north of the Project Site 
and within the Vale and is in part designated as a 
Conservation Area. The village is generally inward 
facing with a tree screen separating it from the 
Project Site;
F. 
Cardington Hangars - which are former air ship 
hangars, lie to the north east of the Project Site and 
some 8km distant. The buildings are Grade II* listed 
and lie within an flat open former airfield outside 
Bedford.

2.5  Wider Context - Built Form & Visual Structure
2.5.1. The Project lies in the Forest of Marston Vale, an 
evolving community forest which runs south west from 
the towns of Bedford and Kempston in towards the 
M1 motorway. The Vale is traditionally a brickmaking 
area, and consequently there are a number of large 
empty pits, some of which have now been converted 
into lakes.
2.5.2. The wider context to the Project Site is predominantly 
rural, interspersed with farm, villages and market 
towns. The closest villages to the Project Site are 
Millbrook, Stewartby, and Lidlington, with Ampthill, 
Houghton Conquest and Wootton lying further out. 
2.5.3. The nearest major settlements are Bedford 9km to 
the north and Milton Keynes 16km to the west.
2.5.4. To the North of the Project Site is the village of 
Stewartby, which is part of a designated Conservation 
Area. The village grew rapidly to house workers of the 
Stewartby Brick Works and operated under various 
ownership from 1897 to 2008. The four remaining 
brick towers are a highly visible local landmark and 
have been used as a reference point for the Project 
design and mitigation.
2.5.5. Another highly visible landmark is the Marston Mill 
Wind Turbine (120.5m to tip) at the Marston Vale 
Forest Centre to the immediate west of the Project 
Site. With blades approximately 35m long the Marston 
Mill is estimated to produce around 4,500,000KWh 
of electricity per year.
2.5.6. The Marston Vale Forest Centre is located on 
reclaimed clay pits similar to Rookery South Pit. The 
clay pits are characterised by large bodies of open 
water and woodland planting. 
2.5.7. The skyline in the area of the Project Site, with its 
disused brickworks chimneys and the Marston Vale 
Forest Centre Wind Turbine is further cluttered by the 
electricity pylons of the Grendon – Sundon 400kV 
overhead line, which run more or less in a north-
south direction. 
2.5.8. The largest body of water in the proximity of the 
Project Site  is the 200 acre Stewartby Lake situated 
northwest. The Lake is home to the Stewartby Water 
Sports Club offering a range of activities such as 
Angling, Sailing, Skiing, and Power Boat Racing.

2.7.1. There is significant intervisibility between the distant 
elevated Greensand Ridge landscape and the flat, 
low lying, clay vale in which the Project is to be 
located.
2.7.2. The nearest residential dwellings and settlements 
to the Power Generation Plant Site are South 
Pillinge Farm to the south west (an isolated farm 
and associated cottages), Stewartby to the north 
and Marston Moretaine to the west. From these 
locations views of the Power Generation Plant 
Site are substantially screened in many ways by 
built development, woodland areas, tree belts and 
hedges. Where views over the Project are anticipated, 
these have influenced the layout of the Generating 
Equipment Site to minimise the proportion of new 
buildings that are visible from these viewpoints.
2.7.3. The Marston Vale Millennium Country Park is located 
immediately to the west of the Power Generation Plant 
Site. Views towards the Project from the rear elevation 
of the Forest Centre are screened by intervening 
woodland within the Country Park. The extent of view 
from the Country Park is likely to change over time 
as young woodland planting matures. From footpath 
FP72 within the Park, there are open views towards 
where the Project will be located, although views into 
the base of Rookery South Pit are screened by low 
level scrub planting along either side of the Marston 
Vale Line.
2.7.4. The views from the Country Park are an important 
consideration addressing amenity considerations and 
cultural associations. The Forest Centre promotes 
sustainable environmental initiatives and recreation 
and the Project promotes sustainable energy 
production.

2.8  Wider Context: Movement & Connections
2.8.1. Roads 
 
The A421 joins the M1 at Junction 13 and forms the 
principal local transport corridor close to the Project 
Site, extending northeast-southwest and linking to 
the A1.
2.8.2. The M1 runs in a Northwest-Southeast direction 
5km to the South / West of the Project Site and 
forms one of the main strategic north-south highway 
routes through Great Britain. It connects some of the 
major conurbations of the north (Sheffield, Leeds), 
the Midlands (Nottingham, Northampton), Milton 
Keynes and London. A connection from the M1 to 
the M6 provides a link to Liverpool, Manchester and 
Birmingham.
2.8.3. The existing A421 has recently been subject to major 
improvement works, creating a new A421 dual and 
3-lane carriageway between Bedford (at the southern 
by-pass) and the M1. Works include re-routing of 
the carriageway to the west of Marston Moretaine, 
new junctions provided at Marston Moretaine and at 
Marsh Leys and major improvements to Junction 13 
on the M1.
2.8.4. The A507 by passes Ampthill to the south east; and 
the A6 extends north-south into Bedford. The A421 
connects Bedford and Milton Keynes.
2.8.5. The Project Site will be accessed from the former 
A421, now known as C94, via Green Lane, which is 
an unclassified road providing access to the former 
Stewartby brickworks site and Stewartby, connecting 
with the B530. The road crosses the Marston Vale 
Line at a level crossing and passes under the Midland 
Mainline to the east of the village via a low bridge 
with height restriction where Stewartby Way meets 
the B530.
2.8.6. Railway  
Both the Stewartby and Millbrook Rail Stations 
are served by the Marston Vale Line that provides 
an hourly service operated by London Midlands in 
each direction between Bedford and Bletchley from 
Mondays to Saturdays (16 trains per day in each 
direction).
2.8.7. There are links from Millbrook and Stewartby Rail 
Stations to Bedford, Bedford St Johns, Kempston 
Hardwick, Lidlington, Ridgmont, Aspley Guise, 
Woburn Sands, Bow Brickhill, Fenny Stratford and 
Bletchley.
2.8.8. The Midland Main Line runs to the east of the Project 
Site providing services from Bedford to London St 
Pancras, the Midlands and northern England. The 
nearest railway station to the Project Site served by 
the Midland Main Line is the Bedford Railway Station, 
served by the adjacent Marston Vale Line, located 
approximately 9.3km north-east from the centre of 
the Project Site.

2.8.9. Public Right of Way 
 
There are over 1341km of public rights of way in 
Central Bedfordshire that run between towns and 
villages and out into the wider countryside. Central 
Bedfordshire Council are responsible for the day to 
day maintenance of the network which consists of 975 
km of Public Footpaths, 340km of Public Bridleway 
and 26km of Byways Open to All Traffic (BOATS). 
These rights of way are recorded on the Definitive 
Map and Statement that can be found at: http://
www.centralbedfordshire.gov.uk/onlinemapping/
map.aspx
2.8.10. Footways 
 
The most prominent footway to the Project Site is 
the John Bunyan Long Distance Walkers Association 
Trail. The trail stretches from Pavenham in the north 
to Lilley in the south with the trail running through the 
Village of Millbrook and Ampthill Park.
2.8.11. The Milton Keynes Boundary walk, 8km to the north 
west of the Project Site, is a 60km route around the 
Milton Keynes town boundary through the valleys of 
the Rivers Tove and Ouse. The landscape includes 
canal towpath, forest and thatched cottages using 
mainly exisiting footpaths.
2.8.12. The Greensand Ridge Walk passes through Bedford, 
Buckinghamshire and Cambridgeshire. The route 
follows a ridge of greensand which rises from the 
clay vales on either side.  
 
 
 
2.8.13. The 64km walk starts in Leighton Buzzard and 
finishes in Gamlingay, Cambridgeshire. The route has 
been split into five sections to enable the route  to be 
walked in stages or as a whole. The Stages are:
• 
Leighton Buzzard to Woburn 13km
• 
Woburn to Ampthill  
15.5km
• 
Ampthill to Haynes  
13.5km
• 
Haynes to Sandy 
 
11.5km
• 
Sandy to Gamlingay  
8.5km 
 
2.8.14. Cycle Routes 
 
National Cycle Route (NCR) 51 connects Milton 
Keynes to Bedford. The route follows the north bank 
of the River Great Ouse through Bedford town, before 
crossing the river into Kempston and the Bedford 
western bypass via Wootton to Marston Moretaine.
2.8.15. The route travels through the Forest of Marston Vale 
where there is a cycleway connecting with Millbrook 
railway station.
2.8.16. From the Forest of Marston Vale, the NCR 51 takes 
residential roads, tracks, and bridleways to Cranfield.
2.8.17. At Cranfield, there are no further NCR signs 
westbound until Salford, where the route crosses the 
M1 towards Wavendon and Woburn Sands before 
entering the eastern edge of Milton Keynes. 
2.8.18. Bedfordshire Cycle Route 3 extends to the west 
and south of The Rookery and through the village of 
Marston Moretaine.

2.9  Wider Context: Landscape
2.9.1. Policy Context 
 
Green Infrastructure (GI) policy relating to the Project 
has historically been driven by the East of England 
Plan (EoEP), and promoted in the Bedfordshire and 
Luton Strategic Infrastructure Plan (2007) and the 
Forest of Marston Vale Plan (2000) policy objectives. 
The EoEP no longer forms part of the development 
plan but its aspirations and objectives are referred 
to in this DAS as the EoEP informed the adoption 
of existing development plan policies relating to GI. 
Emerging development plan policies, for example in 
the Central Bedfordshire Local Plan 2015-2035 (Draft 
Plan – 2017), seek to continue support for improved 
GI.
2.9.2. The retention, protection and enhancement of GI 
assets was regarded as vital to ensure that major 
planned growth within the region will be sustainable. 
A summary of relevant GI planning policy is provided 
below and within the Planning Statement (Document 
Reference 10.1) accompanying the Application.
2.9.3. Existing Green Infrastructure Provision 
 
Existing strategic and local GI assets within the 
Marston Vale comprise:
• 
Open water bodies created within former 
quarry pits which have both recreational 
and ecological value (designated as County 
Wildlife Sites);
• 
Natural and semi-natural habitat for wildlife 
including large areas of woodland, parkland 
and remnant heathland;
• 
A network of hedgerows and watercourses, 
including the Elstow Brook;
• 
The Marston Vale Millennium Country Park;
• 
Historic parks and gardens and historic 
landscapes 
including 
Ampthill 
Park, 
a 
Capability Brown designed parkland and 
the biggest expanse of acid grassland in the 
County;
• 
Designated 
and 
undesignated 
cultural 
heritage assets which include Ampthill Castle 
and Houghton House (both Scheduled 
Monuments) 
and 
Stewartby 
Chimneys 
(Grade II Listed);
• 
A network of public rights of way, cycleways 
and other recreational routes; and
• 
A local, regional and national railway network.
2.9.4. Green Infrastructure Initiatives 
 
The Marston Vale Trust’s Forest Plan is the key local 
delivery document for GI across the Marston Vale. 
Working with local communities, government and 
businesses, the 40-year vision (now into its 10th 
year) is to deliver environmental regeneration that will 
act as a catalyst to social and economic regeneration 
of the area, whilst providing major recreation, 
landscape, biodiversity, cultural heritage and quality 
of life benefits. 
2.9.5. Major potential development in the area, which 
includes the Millbrook Project, will be expected to 
contribute to delivering the Trust’s policy objectives.
2.9.6. There are major GI initiatives for wetland creation in 
relation to the proposed Milton Keynes to Bedford 
Waterway Park (see below) and restored brick pits 
together with significant new areas of accessible 
green space and woodland and other habitat 
linkages between the existing ancient woodlands on 
the wooded slopes surrounding the Vale.
2.9.7. The Milton Keynes and Bedford Waterway comprises 
construction of a broad waterway which will link the 
Grand Union Canal in Milton Keynes to the River 
Great Ouse in Bedford through a series of waterway 
parks. The waterway will provide the opportunity to 
enhance strategic bridleway, cycle and footpath links 
and will create natural and semi-natural habitat for 
wildlife.
2.9.8. The Project responds to delivery of these GI initiatives 
by recognising the changing context of the site and 
the key role The Rookery plays in securing repair 
and enhancement to the rights of way network east 
of the Forest Centre linking the Millennium Country 
Park to the Greensand Ridge, planting of woodland 
and provision towards the Trust Fund proposed by 
Covanta to further support the objectives of the 
Forest of Marston Vale.

3.1  Site Setting
3.1.1. Overview  
This chapter considers the more immediate context 
of the Project Site itself in further detail under the 
headings of:
• 
Built form and visual structure;
• 
Movement and connections; and
• 
Landscape.
3.1.2. These are described in detail over the following pages 
and illustrated in the plan opposite.
3.1.3. A number of factors relating to the above headings 
will be identified at this spatial scale and will be taken 
forward to influence the key design principles for the 
Project described in Chapter 4. 
3.1.4. Project Site Description 
 
The Power Generation Plant Site and part of the Gas 
and Electrical Connections would be situated on land 
within a former clay pits known as ‘The Rookery’ and 
more specifically Rookery South Pit. The Generating 
Equipment Site plot is a rectangular shaped site of 
approximately 4 ha and is shown outlined on the plan 
opposite. 
3.1.5. The immediate context for the proposed Power 
Generation Plant is the post-industrial landscape 
within the pit itself and the mature rural landscape out 
with the pit. The pit itself is sunken and on a ground 
plane 15 m lower than the surrounding ridge and 
landscape beyond.
3.1.6. Additional factors that require consideration to 
influence the key design principles of this Project are: 
• 
A separate but complementary restoration project 
is underway and on-going in respect of proposals 
to restore both Rookery North and Rookery 
South Pits. This is referred to as the Low Level 
Restoration Scheme (LLRS). The LLRS is focused 
predominantly on Rookery South Pit and will 
include slope stabilisation works; establishment 
of woodland planting; establishment of grassland 
and; the establishment of an attenuation pond 
and associated drainage channels.
• 
The Covanta RRF, which comprises and Energy 
from Waste (EfW) and Material Recovery Facility 
(MRF). Although the Covanta RRF has statutory 
consents the facility has not yet been built, 
though elements of the LLRS program are 
underway. 
• 
This Design and Access Statement not only 
takes cognisance of all the above but also has 
been set out to recognise and respond to the 
two separate scenarios: one where the Covanta 
RRF is complete and operational and the other 
where it may not be and therefore the Project is 
built and operational without the Covanta RRF.

3.2.1. Road access  
 
Road access to the Generating Equipment Site is 
currently from the north near Stewartby via the A421, 
Bedford Road and Green Lane. There is a junction 
on Green Lane leading to an access track which 
extends southwards into Rookery South Pit and the 
Generating Equipment Site. 
3.2.2. The Gas and Electrical Connections would either 
be accessed via the route described in 3.2.1 above 
or from the A421, northwards along the A5141, 
westwards then southwards for approximately 7 km 
along the B530 (referred to variously along its route 
as Ampthill Road / Hardwick Road / Bedford Road / 
Hazelwood Lane)  to Millbrook Road, Houghton Lane 
and (in the case of the Electrical Connection) Station 
Lane.
3.2.3. Nearby roads include the A421 which is approximately 
2 km to the west and the B530 which lies to the 
east of the Project Site. The A421 connects directly 
to Junction 13 of the M1 Motorway which is 
approximately 5.6 km to the south east of the Project 
Site. Furthermore the Midland Mainline Railway and 
Marston Vale Line border the Power Generation Plant 
Site to the east and west respectively. 
3.2.4. Railway  
The Marston Vale Line runs adjacent to the Project 
Site. There are a number of local stations along 
the line to the west, including those at Lidlington, 
Millbrook, Stewartby and Kempston Hardwick. The 
line forms part of the east west rail proposal, which 
seeks to provide a high speed rail freight route from 
Bristol to Felixstowe via Oxford and Cambridge.
3.2.5. The Marston Vale is slightly elevated above the 
Project Site, with a near continuous narrow tree and 
scrub belt separating. There are some maturing trees 
straddling the fence line. 
3.2.6. Rights of Way 
 
There are no Public Rights of Way within the Power 
Generation Plant Site. Footpaths within close 
proximity to the Power Generation Plant Site:
• 
To the north-west of the Power Generation 
Plant Site FP72 provides a leisure footpath 
around the Stewartby Lake. In order to form 
an access between Stewartby and FP72, 
there is a footpath link to Green Lane 160m 
west of the railway crossing.
• 
To the west of Stewartby Lake, there is a 
footpath link to Bedford Road, via FP19. This 
joins Bedford Road within a national speed 
limit zone, where no footway is present.
3.2.7. A number of Permissive Footpaths will be delivered 
within the Rookery as part of the LLRS, but their 
precise location is not known at present.

3.3  Site Setting : Landscape
3.3.1. Substantial areas of land around Stewartby, including 
the Rookery South Pit, have been previously worked 
for clay that was used in Stewartby Brickworks until 
it closed in 2008. To the north of The Rookery there 
remain some buildings associated with the former 
Stewartby Brick Works, including four chimneys 
which are now listed structures. Following clay 
extraction, these former clay working sites have been 
restored (to varying levels of completion) by different 
means (including the disposal of waste) and for 
different uses, including water based recreation and 
commercial uses.
3.3.2. Furthermore, 
significant 
regeneration 
and 
development is allocated for the Northern Marston 
Vale Growth Area, in which the Project Site is located. 
This will result in further change within the landscape, 
not least represented by substantial residential and 
employment development such as in the nearby 
settlements of Marston Moretaine and Stewartby.
3.3.3. There are overhead power lines that run west to east 
south of Rookery South Pit as well as a number of 
existing public footpaths located in and around the 
Project Site, linking it to the wider Marston Vale. 
However there is limited public access to Rookery 
South Pit itself until the permissive footpaths of the 
LLRS are completed.

direction along the western flank of Rookery South Pit 
whilst a tributary watercourse, passing to the south 
of Rookery South Pit within the Project Site, joins

3.4  Site Setting : The Rookery & Immediate Setting
3.4.1. A separate but complementary restoration project is 
proposed and on-going in respect of proposals to 
restore both Rookery North and Rookery South Pits. 
This will provide for implementation of what is referred 
to as the LLRS. The Project design proposals have 
been developed on the basis of these infrastructure 
works being completed. Therefore any works 
associated with the Project that impinge on the LLRS 
such as laying the underground cable for the Electrical 
Connection or constructing the Gas Connection will 
also propose reinstatement where necessary.  
3.4.2. The LLRS proposals have Statutory Consents and 
works are currently underway. The overarching 
objective of the work is to fulfil the requirements of a 
Review of Old Minerals Permissions (ROMP). 
3.4.3. The LLRS proposals have been developed with the 
objective of restoring the former clay workings at 
The Rookery to enable a low intensity agricultural 
end use with particular attention to biodiversity and 
landscape enhancement. The restoration scheme 
is focused predominantly on Rookery South Pit and 
will include slope stabilisation works; establishment 
of woodland planting; establishment of grassland 
and; the establishment of an attenuation pond and 
associated drainage channels. Once restored, the 
base of Rookery South will form the platform for the 
Project. The LLRS works being carried out in Rookery 
North Pit are focusing on nature conservation. These 
include lowering lake water levels to establish greater 
areas of wetland, localised slope stability / erosion 
control works, limited woodland planting, and the 
introduction of footpaths.
3.4.4. The design proposals for the Project should have 
a strong landscape and ecological rational – taking 
cognisance and respecting/considering the existing 
and mature landscaping but also the LLRS for The 
Rookery.
3.4.5. The Rookery comprises two large clay pits, Rookery 
North Pit and Rookery South Pit, separated by an 
east-west spine of unexcavated clay, covering an area 
of approximately 210ha. The Project Site comprises 
approximately 48ha in total with the Generating 
Equipment Site and Substation taking up 10ha of  the 
south western quadrant of Rookery South Pit. 
3.4.6. The Rookery has a long history of clay working, 
supplying Oxford Clay for brick manufacture at the 
London Brick Company works at Stewartby. The 
winning and working of clay was originally permitted 
in 1952. Since then, clay extraction has taken place 
over the majority of the permitted area at The Rookery. 
Some reserves remain, being largely confined to land 
within the south western corner of Rookery South.
3.4.7. The existing physical characteristics of both Rookery 
North and Rookery South Pits, which are described 
in the following paragraphs, will be subject to change 
as the approved LLRS works are implemented. These 
works would return The Rookery to low intensity 
agricultural land (in large part) and will provide 
additional ecological and amenity benefits.
3.4.8. Rookery North Pit  
Rookery North Pit is approximately 70ha in area and 
presently encompasses a deep lake in the central / 
western area fringed by extensive stands of reed-
swamp which extend into a coarse and relatively 
species-poor grassland. There is a backfilled area 
in the east and south east part of Rookery North 
comprised largely of mineral (clay) waste deposited 
under a Waste Management Licence. The base of 
the flooded pit sits approximately 20m below the 
surrounding ground level at circa 17.5m AOD at its 
deepest, with a berm along the western edge at circa 
32m AOD. The smaller water body located at the 
south western corner of Rookery North has a base 
level of 28m AOD. A continuous belt of trees along the 
northern boundary provides a buffer between Rookery 
North Pit and Green Lane, Stewartby. The elevated 
portions of Rookery North Pit include species-poor 
neutral grassland, immature broadleaved plantation 
woodlands, scattered broadleaved trees and shrubs, 
and both dry and seasonally-wet ruderal communities. 
The North Pit abuts Green Lane and Stewartby.
3.4.9. Rookery 
North 
Pit 
supports 
an 
assemblage 
of 
protected 
species 
and 
species 
groups, 
most notably great crested newts, aquatic and 
terrestrial invertebrate assemblages and stonewort 
communities. In addition, several species of bat 
forage extensively over the waterbodies and use the 
linear vegetated features for commuting.

3.4.10. Under the LLRS the Rookery North Pit lake will be 
partially drained to improve lake-edge habitat and 
areas of habitat created as translocation habitat 
for protected species removed as part of the lake 
draining works in Rookery South Pit.
3.4.11. Rookery South Pit 
 
Rookery South Pit is approximately 95 ha in area. 
The majority of the pit is approximately 10-24m 
below surrounding ground levels and is currently 
bounded by steep clay banks, which have a stepped 
profile to the west and southeast corner with 
instability observed in many areas principally to the 
south, east and northeast of the pit. The instability 
of the clay banks is to be addressed via the LLRS, 
as explained further below. The base of the pit 
comprises large, ephemeral waterbodies which are 
fringed by extensive stands of reed-swamp and 
coarse, relatively species-poor, grassland. The land 
around the periphery of the pit that remains at the 
original ground level, approximately 42m AOD, is 
primarily grassland with scattered scrub and maturing 
woodland to the southeast.
3.4.12. In addition, there are seasonally parched areas 
of bare ground (predominantly on the exposed 
slopes) 
which 
support 
a 
ruderal 
botanical 
community. The Pit is accessed from Green 
Lane by a track, some 700m long, which extends 
along the western boundary of the Project Site 
adjacent and parallel to the Marston Vale Line. 
3.4.13. The Rookery, like many other remnant clay pits in the 
area, is designated as a County Wildlife Site.
3.4.14. Low Level Restoration Scheme 
 
Under the LLRS proposals, the base level of Rookery 
South Pit and the existing bank profiles will be 
altered with slacker slopes and a re-graded pit base 
including drainage ditches draining to an attenuation 
pond including access tracks extending down the 
pit embankment face. Protected species have been 
translocated to Rookery North Pit and the receptor 
site at Stewartby Way 2.
3.4.15. The LLRS is being implemented on a phased basis 
and the Project design proposals are developed 
on the basis that those works will be substantially 
completed.
The key aspects of the LLRS strategy are outlined in the diagram 
below.

3.5.1. Further site setting considerations for the Project is 
the Covanta RRF, on an immediately adjacent site. 
This Design and Access Statement document in the 
following chapters considers not only the site setting 
at the Rookery South Pit with the Covanta RRF as a 
completed project with associated landscape design 
but also the separate scenario where the Covanta 
RRF and associated landscape design has not 
proceeded.
3.5.2. The main components of the Project are an EfW 
Facility with an average gross electrical output of 
65 Mega Watts (MWe) Facility, and a post treatment 
MRF to recover/recycle bottom ash and metals. The 
nominal capacity of the EfW Facility is 585,000 tonnes 
per year of mixed residual municipal, commercial and 
industrial waste.
3.5.3. The Project obtained the necessary statutory 
consents in 2011 and is proposed as an important 
source of renewable energy. Sufficient electricity 
could be generated to serve the needs of 82,500 
homes.

3.5.4. The Covanta RRF comprises a series of buildings 
associated with the EfW Facility and MRF. It also 
includes a new access road and upgraded junction 
from Green Lane; extensive landscape works 
(significantly increasing the extent of tree planting 
around Rookery South); ecological habitat creation; 
improvements to the rights of way network; provision 
of a visitor interpretation / education centre within 
the main EfW Facility building; and underground 
electricity grid connection infrastructure. The nature 
of these elements has been informed by extensive 
design work and a detailed understanding of the 
surrounding environment so as to ensure successful 
integration of the Covanta RRF into the Marston Vale.
3.5.5. The sectional drawing studies on the adjacent page 
taken through the Rookery South Pit indicate the 
Covanta RRF and its relationship to upper banks 
of the pit. The top section is looking South and the 
bottom section is looking West towards Marston 
Vale Train Line. The sections indicate clearly the 
ground plane level of the RRF some 25m below the 
perimeter banks and this level difference would assist 
in mitigating any visual impact.

Millbrook Power Design & Access Statement
4.1  Design Response : Overview
4.1.1. This Chapter sets out the design criteria developed 
in response to the emerging principles identified 
in Chapter 3. The Design Principles have been 
developed under the following headings again:
• 
Built Form and Visual Structure;
• 
Movement and Connections;
• 
Landscape
4.1.2. These principles set the brief for the Indicative Design 
Proposals which are described in Chapter 5 of this 
statement.
4.1.3. The following tables demonstrate how the design 
principles form the framework for the Project Site in 
terms of the three headings.
4.1.4. Additional factors influencing the key design principles 
include the following: 
• 
A separate but complementary restoration 
project is ongoing at the Rookery, referred to as 
the LLRS. The restoration scheme is focused 
predominantly on Rookery South Pit and will 
include slope stabilisation works; establishment 
of woodland planting; establishment of grassland 
and; the establishment of an attenuation pond 
and associated drainage channels.
• 
The Covanta RRF, comprising an EfW facility and 
MRF.  Although the RRF has statutory consents 
the facility has not yet been built. 
• 
This Design and Access Statement in the 
following section takes cognisance of all the 
above, and has been set out to recognise and 
respond to two separate scenarios. One where 
the Covanta RRF is complete and operational 
and the other where it may not be build: the 
second scenario therefore only considers the 
Project in isolation.

DESIGN PRINCIPLE 
MILLBROOK POWER PRINCIPLE 
Built Form, Uses & Activities
Specify or design items of larger  
plant with consideration to their visual 
appearance in the local and wider 
landscape.
The proposed buildings, structures and perimeter security fencing shall be of high quality design. 
Materials used for cladding shall above all need to be durable and functional, as appropriate for 25 
years operation in a power station environment. 
The design should be such that it minimises visual impact and blends with the background and 
foreground as far as possible, with recessive colouring. 
Consideration should be given to cladding in scale & grades of colour appropriate to the local sur-
rounding backdrop, to minimise visibility in long distance views. 
Stack heights shall be minimised to 32.5m - 35m height and will not be illuminated or contain sig-
nage unless for safety/ operational requirements.
Built Form, Uses & Activities
Lighting shall be appropriate to the 
local context and avoid lighting impacts 
upon identified habitats, neighbouring 
occupiers, and the wider landscape.
The overarching philosophy underpinning the design of the lighting for the project is as far as pos-
sible, to maintain a ‘dark’ site. Only critical light sources such as emergency exit illumination and 
security lighting at low level will remain on during the night. 
The scheme of lighting should minimise detrimental visual and environmental impacts. This would be 
achieved through appropriate placing, directionality, and technology of lighting and a preference for 
a greater number of lower level building mounted lamps. 
Built Form, Uses & Activities
Stack should be designed at a height 
which causes minimum visual impact 
whilst also allowing for adequate 
dispersion of stack emissions.
The height of all plant should be minimised. The design of the project utilises technology (OCGCT) 
that allows a significant reduction in stack height compared to other technology types. Stack shall 
be between 32.5 m – 35m height and shall not be illuminated or contain signage or branding unless 
necessary for a recognised safety / operational requirement.

Built Form, Uses & Activities
The Power Generation Plant Site 
shall be laid out and, where possible, 
maintained in a safe and attractive 
manner and which supports a positive 
public perception of the operation.
The main entrance and other permanent accesses shall have high quality branded signage so that 
visitors and passers-by can understand the use of the site. 
Vehicle parking, storage areas and smaller structures shall be laid out and screened so as to minimise 
visual clutter and improve the safety and perception of safety of the site operation. 
The Construction Environment Management Plan (CEMP)  shall include measures for the maintenance 
of a tidy and contained site compound during construction.
Built Form, Uses & Activities
The site layout shall consider the need 
to minimise noise and vibration impacts 
on the wider area.
Detailed design shall ensure that noise is mitigated as far as possible, through the Project Site 
layout and consideration of the orientation of plant items associated with higher sound power levels. 
Inherently quiet plant items shall be selected wherever practicable. Consideration shall be given to 
the use of silencers and housing plant items in acoustic enclosures where practicable.
Noisy elements of the plant shall be located away from the nearest noise sensitive receptor (South 
Pillinge Farm). The Stack would be located at the eastern side of the Generating Equipment Site, 
furthest away from the farm property. 
Built Form, Uses & Activities
Consideration shall be given to the 
most appropriate choice of materials. 
Materials should be agreed with the 
local planning authority.
Materials chosen shall be robust, high quality and cost-effective. The architectural design, use of 
cladding materials and colours of the buildings and structures on the Rookery South Pit site shall be 
designed to reduce glare and blend into the surrounding landscape.
Built Form, Uses & Activities
Site layout and location of Substation to 
minimise impact and be compliant.
Substation design, layout, and related access must be compliant with NGET requirements 
The Substation shall be been located in close proximity (within 500m) of the existing 400kV overhead 
line to reduce impacts associated with the construction of the Electrical Connection.

in the local and wider landscape.
Siting the Stack and larger plant in a centralised location within the pit maximises the ability to provide 
and achieve visual mitigation from landscape screening positioned on the upper bank of the pit, at 
the pit boundary. 
Siting more visually prominent plant in a centralised location will take advantage of the lowest ground 
plane levels within the pit and opportunities for natural screening to be provided by existing and 
proposed landscape at the perimeter of the site on the upper bank of the pit.
Built Form, Uses & Activities
Site layout of plant will take account of 
neighbouring land and property uses.
The Project Site layout and landscaping proposals shall be designed to take account of the LLRS

DESIGN PRINCIPLE 
MILLBROOK POWER PRINCIPLE 
Landscape,  Environment  & 
Ecology
Minimise impacts on existing habitats 
and species within the site.
The design of landscape planting should enhance the area’s biodiversity through: the retention of 
existing  trees & bushes; the planting of belts of broadleaved woodland to increase the amount of 
natural green landscape in the area; the reinstatement of planting where possible and appropriate; 
and careful management of soils.
The routing and installation of the utility connections should minimise the impact on existing landscape 
and ecological features and the sterilisation of land – careful routing to  be   used   where   possible.
Landscape,  Environment  & 
Ecology
Reinstate the routes of the Gas and 
Electrical Connections with appropriate 
planting for their wider and local 
landscape and habitat setting, taking 
into account the need to avoid damage 
from roots.
Soft planting along connection routes should be reinstated in accordance with soil handling and 
reinstatement strategy. 
Where existing trees or soft planting are lost, and cannot be replaced through tree planting due to 
restrictions above and adjacent to the pipeline or cable, appropriate planting should be reinstated to 
retain the linear feature and provide connectivity for wildlife. 
Where inside the permanent easement of the Gas and Electrical Connections, only shallow-rooting 
tree/shrub species should be used.
Any existing woodland, LLRS or Covanta RRF planting removed/lost due to Electrical Connections 
shall be replaced with appropriate native species with a view towards not eroding or undermining 
existing or already planned screening objectives.
Landscape,  Environment  & 
Ecology
The use of soft landscaping should be 
maximised within the Power Generation 
Plant Site where safety and operational 
considerations  allow.
Amenity planting should be used to enhance and reinforce the character of the surrounding area.
The design of perimeter security fencing and its alignment inside boundary structure planting should 
provide a ‘soft’ edge to the industrial development, and connect with adjacent trees and vegetation.

A landscaping scheme should be 
developed that ensures the Project 
Site is designed and landscaped to 
complement the local and wider setting,

4.3  Design Response : Initial Design Approach
4.3.1. At the outset of the Project, a number 
of different engineering and plant 
options were considered. The initial 
design response in absence of a 
finalised engineering solution was 
to consider (as is typical of many 
similar NSIP projects of this nature) 
a development “envelope” enclosure 
for the various plant components, not 
dissimilar to the Covanta RRF. This 
approach would provide a degree of 
flexibility to arrange the components 
with the Order Limits. It would also 
allow engineering optioneering to 
continue and broad concepts for 
visual screening to be developed. 
4.3.2. The 
design 
concept 
graphics 
adjacent indicate the initial approach 
adopted to address and minimise the 
visual impact of an enclosure within 
an integrated design landscape to 
mitigate/filter views. The architectural 
design intention visually was that the 
building colour, materiality and texture 
would be informed by features in the 
surrounding and distance landscape. 
4.3.3. Sheppard Robson carried out a 
detailed study of the landscape 
character not only in the near vicinity 
of the Project Site, but also in a wider 
study area taking in Millbrook, Stewartby, 
and Ampthill, and stretching out further 
in all directions to investigate and more 
closely understand the texture and mix 
of colour and tones in the environment 
that could then be translated into the 
enclosure elevations. The mixture of 
tones and colours would also have to 
be representative, as much as possible, 
of the changing seasons in and around 
the site. The graphics (to the right) 
demonstrate in more detail how this 
analysis translates into colour contrast 
and tones.
4.3.4. Various surrounding and long distance 
photographs 
were 
taken, 
then 
broken down into a pixelation of the 
representative colours. From this, the 
predominant and highlight colours were 
established, along with matching tones 
that could then be tested in the façade 
cladding of the proposed enclosure. 
Not only colour combinations were 
investigated, but also the orientation of 
panels, and size of panels to achieve 
a scale and harmony with the existing 
backdrop landscape.

4.4  Design Response : Built Form
4.4.1. As the continual review of various engineering/
plant options progressed through the early design 
development stages, the necessity for design flexibility 
became a primary consideration.  As a consequence 
of this, the decision was taken to pursue a ‘Rochdale 
Envelope’ type engineering solution approach. This 
approach requires that the various plant and buildings 
are strategically planned out on the Project Site and 
negate the requirement to house everything in an 
envelope enclosure. The various plant as indicated on 
the adjacent page range in scale and type from Gas 
Turbine Generator and Stack to water tanks and other 
small scale buildings.  
4.4.2. This site planning of the various items of plant and 
buildings has to ensure efficient and safe working 
arrangements and direct routes for Gas and Electrical 
Connections with minimum disruption. At the same 
time, the strategic siting of the various different items 
of plant and buildings can be planned to address a 
number of other environmental and visual impact type 
criteria. As the various plant and buildings are planned 
and separated out on the site as opposed to the large 
envelope enclosure approach, the visual impact is 
reduced immediately and the ability to address any 
other key issues such as noise sensitive receptors is 
improved. Interrupted views towards the site and beyond 
can be minimised by this separating out and careful 
planning of the larger pieces of engineering plant such 
as gas turbine and stack. Along with this, the aligning of 
taller elements like the Stack will immediately reduce the 
visual impact from key view corridors. 
4.4.3. The design concept intention developed for the 
‘envelope enclosure’ approach on the previous pages 
would be maintained but then adopted for the various 
buildings and engineering plant components around 
the site. The colour response would take reference 
from the immediate rural surroundings and more distant 
landscape context. From this sampling, the horizontal 
strata and bands of landscape colour are established, 
taken from foreground all the way to the backdrop of the 
distant hills and sky.
4.4.4. Detailed studies of the landscape were undertaken as 
indicated on the following pages. These studies were 
then translated into elevational studies. The mixture of 
tones would also be representative of changing seasons 
in and around the wider area of Stewartby, Millbrook, 
and Ampthill. 
4.4.5. The graphics demonstrate in more detail how this 
analysis translates into colour contrast and tones. 
Particular photographs were taken from within the Project 
Site looking out to the distant relatively flat planes which 
are only broken by trees, bushes and hedgerows then 
broken this into a pixilation of the colours. From these 
colours along with colour matching, horizontal strata 
were established that can be applied to the various plant 
components from base to top.

4.5.1. The Design Response diagrams on the following pages 
relate to the previous series of principles (Section 4.2 
Design Principles) and demonstrate graphically how they 
may be addressed. 
4.5.2. The sketch diagrams on this page and the next 
demonstrate initially the intentions with respect to 
Project Site layout and how the orientation and plan 
arrangement of the plant and buildings can be set out 
to minimise visual impact from exposed viewpoints. The 
layout at the same time has to be efficient and workable 
in terms of Gas and Electrical Connections to create 
minimum impact.
4.5.3. The location within the pit takes advantage of the lowest 
ground plain levels available to assist in mitigation from 
key visual receptors. 
4.5.4. Noisy elements of the plant shall be located furthest 
from the noise sensitive receptors (South Pillinge Farm).

4.5.5. The sketch diagram on this page demonstrates the 
design intention where the reduced and mitigated visual 
impact can be initially achieved by strategic siting of plant 
and buildings and then further assisted by perimeter 
landscape screening.

What will the building and spaces be used for? 
How much will be built on site?
5.1.3. Layout and Access 
 
How will the building and spaces be arranged on site, 
and what is the relationship between them?

5.1.8. Sustainability 
 
What are the key principles for energy efficiency and 
sustainability? 
5.1.9. Use & Amount 
 
In terms of use and amount, the Project consists 
of three main elements, as described in Chapter 1.  
These are: 
 
Power Generation Plant;  
Gas Connection; and  
 
Electrical Connection
5.1.10. The use and amount of these elements of the Project 
are described in more detail below:
5.1.11. Power Generation Plant 
 
The Power Generation Plant incorporates the 
Generating Equipment, the Access Road and the 
Laydown Area.
5.1.12. Generating Equipment 
 
The Generating Equipment in the Power Generation 
Plant comprises a single Gas Turbine Generator. 
The Gas Turbine Generator consists of gas turbine, 
generator, air inlet filter house, air inlet duct, exhaust 
diffuser, and auxiliaries such as lube oil system, air 
dryers, fuel gas filter package, instrument air system, 
compressor washing.
5.1.13. Air would be compressed in the compressor of the 
Gas Turbine Generator and natural gas injected 
into the combustion chamber where it would burn 
producing hot, high-pressure gases. These gases 
would expand across the rotor blades of the gas 
turbine, which would drive both the compressor and 
the generator.
5.1.14. The hot exhaust gases would then be routed directly 
to the stack and emitted to the atmosphere. The 
stack contains a silencer to reduce noise emissions. 
5.1.15. A schematic of the Generating Equipment Site is 
shown on page 89. 
5.1.16. The following ancillary items would also be present at 
the Generating Equipment Site: 
• 
Raw / Fire Water Tank: The fire water storage tank 
would be designed to comply with the relevant 
fire regulations and would be installed together 
with fire pumps, hose reels, fire hydrants and 
portable extinguishers;
• 
Demineralised 
Water 
Tank: 
Required 
to 
store demineralised water for the Generating 
Equipment (used for e.g. blade washing);
• 
Control Room / office / workshop Building: 
Required in order to monitor the plant operation 
and house plant controls;
• 
Gatehouse: Needed to provide security and 
maintain a log of site attendance, deliveries etc.;
• 
Electrical Transformer Compound: Required to 
connect the electrical infrastructure from the 
Generating Equipment to transformers before 
export to the Substation which is part of the 
NETS, via overhead cables. This would also 
include a generator step-up transformer, unit and 
other transformers, an overhead line gantry and 
associated equipment;
MillbrookDesign&AccessStatement4.indd   82
16/10/2017   17:22:06

Millbrook Power Design & Access Statement
KEY
Project Site Boundary
• 
Natural Gas Receiving Station: Required to 
ensure that gas coming from the National 
Transmission System feeds into the Generating 
Equipment Site at the right flow and pressure 
conditions. This would include a compression 
station, emergency generator, Joule-Thompson 
boilers and auxiliary control cabinets; 
• 
Fin-Fan Coolers to provide cooling to the 
Generating Equipment;
• 
Telemetry apparatus including electrical cabinets;
• 
Emergency Generator: A small diesel fired 
generator to provide power for the safe shutdown 
of the Gas Turbine Generator and running 
of essential security systems in emergency 
situations; and 
• 
Maintenance Compound: an area of hard 
standing for use during maintenance procedures.
5.1.17. Laydown Area 
 
A temporary Laydown Area for the storage of 
plant and equipment during construction would be 
provided adjacent to the Generating Equipment Site. 
5.1.18. Access Road  
 
An agricultural access track is already in existence at 
the Project Site, linking Green Lane to Rookery South 
Pit. This access will be upgraded to provide access 
to the Project. Further detail about the Access Road 
is provided in 5.3 and 5.4 - Indicative Development 
Proposals: Layout & Access.

5.2  Indicative Development Proposals : Gas In Electricity Out
5.2.1. Gas Connection  
 
 
 
A new underground gas pipeline, approximately 1.8 
km in length, is required to connect the Generating 
Equipment to the existing National Transmission 
System to provide a reliable supply of fuel. Connection 
to the National Transmission System would require 
two above ground facilities to be installed, a minimum 
off-take connection facility (containing monitoring 
and control equipment), which would be owned 
by National Grid Gas, and a Pipeline Inspection 
Gauge launching facility (required for maintenance 
operations on the Pipeline) which would be owned by 
MPL. Together these form the AGI.
5.2.2. The pipeline begins at the AGI which would allow 
connection into the National Transmission System 
Feeder 9, east of the Millbrook Proving Ground 
approximately 1.45km south of the Generating 
Equipment Site. The Pipeline crosses a farm track 
which is connected to Lower Farm, National 
Transmission System Feeder 9, a PROW, drainage 
ditches, Millbrook Road and then an oil pipeline. The 
route then turns down into Rookery South Pit before 
terminating at the Gas Receiving Station within the 
Generating Equipment Site.  
5.2.3. Construction of the Gas Connection would likely 
take place within a 50m wide strip of land along the 
Gas Connection route, which would be increased 
or decreased in size where required (for example, 
decreased adjacent to nature conservation areas). 
It is expected that the Pipeline will be constructed 
using standard open-cut cross-country pipeline 
construction techniques (i.e. a trench). Trenchless 
techniques (e.g. Drilling) may be used in some 
locations to reduce impacts on sensitive areas or 
public highways.
5.2.4. Connection to the National Transmission System 
would require two adjacent above ground facilities to 
be installed; a Minimum Off-take Connection (MOC) 
facility, and a PIG Trap Facility (PTF) (these two facilities 
together are referred to as the AGI).  The AGI would 
contain the following pieces of equipment to allow for 
the regulation of gas delivery to the Power Generation 
Plant and to allow monitoring and maintenance.
5.2.5. The MOC would contain:
• 
Remotely Operable Valve (ROV);
• 
Control and Instrumentation Kiosk;
• 
Electrical Supply Kiosk.
5.2.6. The PTF would contain:
• 
PIG Launching Facility;
• 
Emergency Control Valve;
• 
Isolation Valve;
• 
Control and Instrumentation Kiosk;
• 
Electrical Supply Kiosk. 
5.2.7. Electrical Connection 
 
The Electrical Connection for the Project has been 
designed to provide the most direct and least 
environmentally damaging route between the Power 
Generation Plant and the NETS.
5.2.8. Following 
statutory 
consultation, 
subsequent 
engagement 
and 
technical 
assessment, 
MPL 
considered that there were four potentially viable 
electrical connection options, including two overhead 
line and two underground cable options. Statutory 
consultation generated a number of responses 
expressing concerns over the potential impacts of 
the overhead line connection options, which would 
require new pylons on the landscape, resulting 
in impacts on visual amenity, and in particular in 
potential adverse effects on Ampthill Park. During 
its evaluation of responses, MPL recognised that 
consultees had expressed a strong preference 
for the development of an underground cable 
connection option. These views were taken on board 
by MPL and a presumption in favour of developing 
a wholly or partially underground cable option was 
adopted by the Project team. This was considered 
to represent more limited potential for significant 
adverse landscape and visual impacts than an 
overhead line option. Further information about the 
iterative process behind the design and layout of the 
Electrical Connection is described in chapter 5 of the 
Environmental Statement (Document Reference 6.1).
5.2.9. The Electrical Connection will connect into the 
existing double circuit 400kV line (forming part of 
the NETS) which runs from Sundon to Grendon. The 
400kV line is located approximately 320m southwest 
of the Generating Equipment Site. The Electrical 
Connection will require two SECs, one located on 
each side of the existing transmission line at the point 
of connection. Underground cables approximately

SEALING END COMPOUND
500m in length would connect the SECs to the new 
substation (to be constructed within Rookery South 
Pit).
5.2.10. Substation 
 
A new 400kV substation to be located in the Rookery 
South Pit, adjacent to the Generating Equipment Site. 
A substation can either be an air insulated substation 
(AIS) or a gas insulated substation (GIS). MPL 
considers that the Substation with AIS technology is 
appropriate and acceptable within Rookery South Pit 
– an AIS substation would be approximately 200m x 
150m.
5.2.11. The plans and descriptions on the following pages 
describe how the Project will be laid out and 
accessed. 
5.2.12. The maximum area for the Generating Equipment Site 
would be approximately 4ha. It consists of a series of 
buildings, structures and plant which are all integral

natural gas, as well as areas of hard-standing, internal 
roads, car parking, landscaping and a laydown area.

5.3  Indicative Development Proposals : Access
Green Lane Looking West
Access track to Rookery South Pit off Green Lane 
Green Lane Looking East
5.3.1. An agricultural access track is already in existence 
at the Project Site, linking Green Lane to Rookery 
South Pit. The Covanta RRF and the LLRS include 
work to upgrade this track and build a new ramp 
into the Rookery South Pit. The Covanta RRF 
includes provision to upgrade the track to a tarmac 
road suitable for 352 traffic movements a day for 
the delivery of waste via HGV. Should this road 
be developed as part of the Covanta RRF prior to 
the development of the MPL Project, it would be 
suitable to meet both the needs of the Project and 
the Covanta RRF. In this instance, there would be a 
requirement for a short section of new Access Road 
(the Short Access Road) of approximately 400m in 
length connecting the end of the Covanta RRF road 
to the Generating Equipment Site. 
5.3.2. However, because it is not certain as to when or 
if the Covanta RRF will be implemented, MPL has 
also included the provision of a complete Access 
Road from Green Lane to the Power Generating Site 
within this Project. If the Covanta RRF is not built 
before construction commences for the Project then 
this complete 2.2km long Access Road would be 
constructed. The complete Access Road would be 
constructed from tarmac, bordered by a concrete 
kerb and be 6m wide to allow for two-way traffic.
5.3.3. The route of the Access Road from Green Lane would 
follow the alignment of the access road proposed 
within the LLRS and the Covanta RRF along the 
existing access track which borders Rookery North 
Pit. On reaching Rookery South Pit, the Access Road 
would use the LLRS access ramp to enter into the pit 
and cross through the base of the pit until it reaches 
the Generating Equipment Site.
5.3.4. Two options will be used with regard to access for the 
Gas Connection during construction. These access 
options are as follows: 
• 
Through Rookery South Pit, from the Power 
Generation Plant Site;
• 
From the A421, northwards along the A5141, 
westwards then southwards for approximately 
7km along the B530 (referred to variously 
along its route as Ampthill Road / Hardwick 
Road / Bedford Road / Hazelwood Lane) to 
Millbrook Road. 
5.3.5. An existing junction off Houghton Lane onto an 
existing agricultural track will be used to access the 
AGI. This short access track would be upgraded to 
tarmac top.

5.4  Indicative Development Proposals : Layout
5.4.1. The maximum area for the Generating Equipment Site 
would be approximately 4 ha. It consists of a series 
of buildings, structures and plant which are required 
for the generation of electricity through combustion of 
natural gas, as well as areas of hardstanding, internal 
roads, car parking and landscaping.
5.4.2. Each individual component of the Project is necessary 
for its operation. These components have been sited 
according to the operational requirements of the 
Project, whilst having regard for the need to protect 
the amenity of surrounding uses and ensure visual 
impact is mitigated and minimised. 
5.4.3. The key Project components are set out in the 
section above and an indicative Project Site layout 
is shown overleaf. The Project has been laid out to 
take advantage of the proximity to gas and electricity 
infrastructure and maximises the use of space within 
the Power Generation Plant footprint.
5.4.4. The layout and design of the Electrical Connection 
has gone through a detailed and iterative process, 
which is described in chapter 5 of the Environmental 
Statement (Document Reference 6.1). The chapter 
details the options for the connection between the 
Substation and the NETS, along with the justification 
for ruling them out and for the selection of the 
underground cable option.
5.4.5. The electrical transformer is located at the western 
end of the Power Generation Plant, closest to the 
400kV NETS, in order to limit the length of electrical 
cable across the Power Generation Plant footprint. 
Furthermore, MPL have elected to progress an 
underground cable option for connection between 
the Substation and the existing 400kV overhead line 
in response to feedback received during statutory 
consultation. By undergrounding the cable, the 
potential impacts of the Project on visual amenity will 
be minimised.
5.4.6. Similarly, the gas infrastructure is located in the south 
of the Project Site to limit the amount of excavation 
for the gas pipeline. 
5.4.7. The Gas Turbine Generator is located in the east 
of the Power Generation Plant Site, in order to be 
as far away as possible from the nearest residential 
receptor. 
5.4.8. The Power Generation Plant Site has also been laid 
out to provide a safe working environment and to 
allow sufficient space for maintenance. 
5.4.9. Although 
the 
Project 
represents 
industrial 
development, and the design and layout are in line 
with relevant safety standards, MPL has sought to 
mitigate impacts on the countryside as much as 
possible by, e.g., careful landscape planting and 
undergrounding of the electrical cable. 
5.4.10. The layout and landscaping plans seek to limit visual 
impact and reduce impact on farming operations.

5.5  Indicative Development Proposals : Scale & Massing
5.5.1. The plan overleaf and the following drawings 
illustrate the scale and massing of the main Project 
components. 
5.5.2. In order to reduce the mass of the Generating 
Equipment, it was decided that a single Gas Turbine 
Generator would replace up to 5 Gas Turbine 
Generators. The Gas Turbine Generator will be 
contained within it’s own acoustic enclosure which 
will limit noise emissions.
5.5.3. This helps to lessen both the bulk and mass of the 
Generating Equipment and minimise its visual impact 
from key viewpoints.
5.5.4. The tallest component(s) of the Power Generation 
Plant is the Stack. The height has been determined 
as a result of air dispersion modelling at 32.5m – 
35m.  
5.5.5. Similarly the air insultation switchgear (AIS) Substation 
was selected as the most appropriate design option 
given the ‘openness’ of the structure and the spaces 
and gaps between the switchgear and insulators, 
which help to minimise the mass of the structure and 
provide views through to the surrounding landscape, 
rather than of one large structure. 
5.5.6. The design of the Project is commensurate with 
its intended use. The Gas  Turbine  Generator will 
be a single unit and will not be sited within a large 
building, but will be left as individual unit within an 
acoustic enclosure. This will limit the  overall ‘mass’ 
of  the Power Generation Plant, and will provide a less 
dense appearance when viewed from outside of the 
Power Generation Plant Site.
5.5.7. Enclosing the unit within it’s own acoustic enclosure 
will limit noise and vibration.

5.6.1. Electrical Connection 
 
The Electrical Connection will export power from 
the Generating Equipment to the NETS. It includes 
a Substation, two electrical circuits and up to two 
SECs to connect the Substation to the Generating 
Equipment and the existing 400 kV network. 
5.6.2. Any existing woodland lost to Electrical Connection 
work will be replanted with appropriate native species.

5.7.1. The LEMMS includes the creation of a new structurally 
diverse and species-rich belt of woodland planting, 
to reflect the species composition within the wider 
Marston Vale Forest.  
5.7.2. Management 
of 
existing 
blocks 
of 
planted 
woodland would be expected to enhance their 
nature conservation value. Native species of local 
provenance will be used, wherever possible. These 
new areas of planting linking existing habitats would 
be expected to increase the connectivity of the 
Project Site for wildlife. The planting proposed has 
been designed to ensure the value for biodiversity is 
maximised, whilst performing a landscape screening 
and integration function.

5.7.3. Should the Covanta RRF be constructed, a separate 
proposal for a LEMMS has been developed which 
specifically considers the proposals put forward 
for landscape and ecology mitigation as a result 
of construction of the Covanta RRF alongside the 
Project.  
5.7.4. Where the Project would result in the loss of 
mitigation put forward as part of the Covanta RRF, 
provision has been made to offset this loss with 
equivalent planting and habitat creation of the same 
volume with the same or similar species mixes. The 
outline LEMMS for the Project (should Covanta RRF 
proceed) has been designed to integrate with the 
planting proposals for the Covanta RRF by using 
complimentary species mixes, having regard to any 
particularly sensitive areas of mitigation proposed, 
and enhancing existing planting and filling gaps where 
appropriate. This will ensure that the required level of 
mitigation for the Project and the Covanta RRF can 
be met simultaneously and exist together, delivering 
adequate and appropriate screening, and ecological 
enhancement for both projects.

5.10  Development Proposals : Sustainability
5.10.1. The Project is a 299MW gas fired peaking plant, 
which will provide enough energy, at times of peak 
demand, to power the equivalent of up to 400,000 
homes. 
5.10.2. The Project represents a significant capital investment 
(in the order of £100M) and will provide up to 150 
jobs during construction.
5.10.3. There is a clear need for such plant, as identified in 
latest government policy, the key elements of which 
are set out in chapter 1 of this statement. 
5.10.4. The Project would not only provide energy at times 
of peak demand, but would also support intermittent 
forms of renewable energy (e.g. wind and solar) at 
times when they are unable to generate electricity. 
As such, the Project supports the UK Government’s 
drive towards a low carbon economy.
5.10.5. The site selection process for the Project has 
taken account of the proximity to available gas 
and electrical connection infrastructure in order to 
minimise the Project footprint as much as possible 
and limit environmental impacts associated with the 
connections. 
5.10.6. The Power Generation Plant will be entirely situated 
within a disused clay excavation pit. There is also 
an existing consent relating to the site adjacent to 
the Project Site for the Covanta RRF development. 
Directing development to a site such as this steers 
development away from the best quality and most 
valuable greenfield land and minimizes environmental 
impacts. 
5.10.7. The Project is also entirely situated within an area 
deemed not to be at risk from flooding, even taking 
into consideration future predictions of climate 
change.
5.10.8. The Power Generation Plant will be constructed from 
high quality materials which will be designed to blend 
in with its surroundings and the other consented 
development and LLRS at Rookery South Pit. The 
materials will be designed to withstand the wear and 
tear of at least 25 years of operation.
5.10.9. As far as is reasonably practical, the Project will use 
materials which can be disposed of sustainably (e.g. 
easily re-usable or recyclable) when the plant has 
reached the end of its operational life.

Millbrook Power Design & Access Statement
06.  Summary & Conclusions
6.1.1. MPL is promoting a new thermal generating station 
on land at the former clay pits near Millbrook, Central 
Bedfordshire.  
6.1.2. The Power Generation Plant would operate as an 
Open Cycle Gas Turbine (OCGT) peaking plant could 
run up to a maximum of 2,250 hours in any given 
year, provided that the 5 year rolling average does not 
exceed 1,500 hours. It would be designed to provide 
a rated electrical output of up to 299 Megawatts 
(MW) at times of peak demand. The plant would be 
fuelled by natural  gas.
6.1.3. The strategic need for the Project is outlined in 
various government policies and strategies including, 
amongst others: National Policy Statements, the 
Annual Energy Statement (latest version published by 
DECC, October 2014), the Electricity Market Reform 
White Paper – Planning our electric future (DECC, 
2011), the National Infrastructure Plan (HM Treasury, 
December 2014), and the report published in October 
2016 by The Energy and Climate Change Committee 
entitled The energy revolution and future challenges 
for UK energy and climate change policy — Third 
Report of Session 2016–17. Further details are 
provided within the Planning Statement (Document 
Reference 10.1) accompanying the Application. 
6.1.4. The Project contains a number of key features 
which support the proposed use and minimise 
environmental impact. These include:
• 
Close proximity to gas and electrical 
infrastructure and a well developed road 
network.
• 
Easily accessible site.
• 
Not in immediate proximity to residential 
centres. 
• 
The Power Generation Plant is to be sited 
within a disused clay pit.
• 
Close proximity to other similar industrial 
developments.
6.1.5. In terms of design, the Project is commensurate 
with its intended use. The form, scale, massing and 
landscaping has been designed so that the Power 
Generation Plant blends in with its surroundings as 
much as possible.
6.1.6. To help limit it’s visual impact in long views including 
from higher ground, it was decided that the Gast 
Turbine Generator would be contained within its own 
acoustic enclosure. 
6.1.7. The layout has been conceived to use the Project 
Site in the most efficient way, by locating plant items 
in close proximity to connections (gas and electrical) 
and by locating the Power Generation Plant to benefit 
from the maximum screening effects.  
6.1.8. The Power Generation Plant, Gas and Electrical 
Connections have been designed to limit massing and 
provide broken views through the main development 
components to the landscape beyond, rather than 
creating massive structures. 
6.1.9. The Generating Equipment and the Substation will 
be constructed from high quality materials which will 
blend in with the proposed development in Rookery 
South Pit. 
6.1.10. The main plant components have been selected to be 
durable and suitable for their intended use throughout 
the proposed 25 year lifetime of the Project. 
6.1.11. The Electrical Connection for the Project has been 
designed to provide the most direct and least 
environmentally 
damaging 
route 
between 
the 
Generating Equipment and the NETS. Furthermore, 
MPL have elected to underground the cable 
connecting the two, greatly reducing any visual 
impacts associated with the Electrical Connection.

Millbrook Power Design & Access Statement
6.1.12. Key design principles have been followed through 
from Section 3 of this Statement into a set of design 
responses which have been described in detail in 
Section 4. Some of these key design responses 
include
• 
Site plan arrangement of the various plant 
components to minimise any visual impact.
• 
Introduction of planted trees/hedgerows/
shrubs linking with the already established 
mature planting.
• 
Colour strategy on various plant components 
reflecting surrounding near and distant 
landscape.
6.1.13. In conclusion, this statement supports the approval 
of the Project.
