Introduction

development consent order (Document Reference 3.1 and referred to in this book of reference as the 
"Order") authorising the construction, operation and maintenance of an up to 299MW gas fired peaking 
power generation plant. 
 
2. This book of reference is required by regulation 5(2)(d) of the Infrastructure Planning (Applications: 
Prescribed Forms and Procedure) Regulations 2009 (the "Regulations") and describes the land affected by 
the Order and details of its ownership.  
 
3. This book of reference describes the land parcels over which the Order grants powers of compulsory 
acquisition or to take temporary possession, and which are shown on the Land Plans (Document 
Reference 2.2 which accompany the application. This land is defined as the "Order Land" in the Order. The 
descriptions of the parcels include their approximate areas in square metres. 
 
4. The purpose of the book of reference is to list: 
 
a. the plots of land over which powers of temporary possession or compulsory purchase are 
sought in the development consent order (including the creation and acquisition of new rights 
and imposition of restrictive covenants); 
 
b. any owners of land outside the boundaries of the proposed development who might have a 
statutory claim for compensation as a result of the construction and/or use of the proposed 
development; 
 
c. any easements, servitudes or other rights (including restrictive covenants) over land which 
may be interfered with, suspended or extinguished as a result of the proposed development;  
 
d. any of the land required for the project which is owned, or potentially owned, by the Crown; 
and 
 
e. any land required for the project which falls into a 'special category'.  
 
5. The book of reference must be in five parts: 
 
• 
Part 1 – Names and addresses for service for each person within Categories 1 and 2 in 
respect of any land which it is proposed shall be subject to (i) powers of compulsory 
acquisition; (ii) rights to use land, including the right to attach brackets or other equipment to 
buildings; or (iii) rights to carry out protective works to buildings. 
 
• 
Part 2 – Names and addresses for service for each person within Category 3. 
 
• 
Part 3 – Names of those persons entitled to enjoy easements or other private rights over land 
which it is proposed shall be interfered with, suspended or extinguished. 
 
• 
Part 4 – Names and addresses for service for each Crown interest in land which is proposed 
to be used for the purposes of the Order for which this application is being made. 
 
• 
Part 5 – Names and addresses for service for each person and description of land subject to 
special parliamentary procedure, special category land or replacement land. 
 
6. A person is within Category 1 if the applicant, after making diligent inquiry knows that the person is an 
owner, lessee, tenant (whatever the tenancy period) or occupier of the land (s.57(1)). 
 
7. A person is within Category 2 if the applicant, after making diligent inquiry knows that the person, is: (a) 
interested in the land; (b) has the power to: (i) to sell or convey the land; or (ii) to release the land s.57(2)). 
 
8. A person is within Category 3 if the applicant thinks (after making diligent inquiry) that, if the order sought 
by the application were to be made and fully implemented, the person would or might be entitled: (a) as a

result of the implementing of the order; (b) as a result of the order having been implemented; or (c) as a 
result of use of the land once the order has been implemented; to make a relevant claim (s.57(4)). 
 
9. Part 2 has been split to accommodate those persons who, if the Order were to be made or fully 
implemented, would or might be entitled to make a claim pursuant to Section 10 of the Compulsory 
Purchase Act 1965 or s152(3) of the Planning Act 2008 (Part 2a), and those persons who would or might 
be entitled to make a claim pursuant to Part 1 of the Land Compensation Act 1973 (Part 2b).
