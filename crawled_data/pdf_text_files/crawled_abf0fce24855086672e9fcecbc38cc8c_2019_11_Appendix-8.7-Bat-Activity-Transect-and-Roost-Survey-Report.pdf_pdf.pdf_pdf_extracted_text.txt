Bat Survey Report  
1.1 
Introduction  
1.1.1 
AECOM was commissioned to undertake a suite of ecological survey work to 
inform the Abergelli Power Project (the “Project”).  
1.1.2 
The Project Site is located near to the village of Felindre, Swansea, as shown in 
Figure 1.1. The central grid reference for the Project Site is SN65280143. 
1.1.3 
The Preliminary Ecological Appraisal (PEA) Report (AECOM, 2017) identified that 
surveys for bats were required at the Project Site.  The Project Site was assessed 
as having ‘High’ commuting and foraging potential (Collins, 2016).  Four buildings 
(outside of, but adjacent to the Project Site boundary) were assessed as having the 
potential to support roosting bats (AECOM, 2017).  
1.1.4 
This baseline report outlines the presence of bat species within the Project Site 
boundary and makes initial indications of potential effects and outlines initial 
recommendations for further surveys, mitigation and enhancement.   
1.1.5 
The bat survey encompasses suitable habitat in close proximity to and within the 
Project Site boundary, as shown on Figure 1 and Figures 3.1-3.3.  
1.1.6 
Previous surveys have been undertaken by BSG Ecology in 2014 which are 
presented in Appendix 8.8 of the PEIR.  
1.2 
Site Description 
1.2.1 
The Project Site supports semi-natural broadleaved and plantation woodland, rows 
of broadleaved trees, standalone broadleaved trees, dense and scattered scrub, 
improved and semi-improved grassland and marshy grassland, tall ruderal, running 
water ditches, ponds, species-rich hedgerow with trees, species-poor hedgerow 
with trees, species-poor intact hedgerows, earth banks fences and bare ground 
(hard standing). In order to cover the Project Site adequately two walked transects 
were undertaken. 
1.2.2 
The walked transect North predominantly encompasses improved grassland fields 
with hedgerows and mature tree lines. It also includes a few areas of dense scrub, 
semi-improved neutral grassland, and a running water ditch (which is connected to 
the Afon Llan watercourse outside of the Project Site) and a tree lined minor road 
and track. 
1.2.3 
The walked transect South predominantly encompasses; marshy and improved 
grassland fields with hedgerows and treelines, with ancient and semi-natural 
woodland. It also includes semi-improved neutral grassland and areas of scattered 
scrub.  There are three running water ditches and the walked transect runs 
adjacent to a an area of running water on the eastern Project Site boundary which 
connects to the Afon Llan watercourse, which is outside of the Project Site.

 Objectives of the Study  
1.4.1 
The objectives of this study were: 
 
To identify nature conservation sites within the Project Site or within 10km of 
the Project Site boundary designated for bats; 
 
To identify any known records and/or populations of bats within the Project Site 
or within 2km of the Project Site boundary; 
 
To establish the presence of any bat roosts within the Project Site; 
 
To establish bat species composition within the Project Site; 
 
To record and map spatial distribution and temporal bat activity within the 
Project Site;  
 
To highlight any potential ecological constraints in respect to bats; 
 
To outline further survey work that may be required; and, 
 
To make suggestions for mitigation, compensation and enhancement of the 
natural features identified within the Project Site in respect to bats.    
1.5 
Legislation 
1.5.1 
All bats and their roosts in Wales are fully protected under Schedule 5 of the 
Wildlife and Countryside Act 1981 (as amended).  They are also included in 
Schedule 2 of the Conservation of Habitats and Species Regulations 2010, known 
as The Habitats Regulations.  The Wildlife and Countryside Act 1981 was amended 
by the Countryside and Rights of Way Act 2000 (CRoW) which adds an extra 
offence of recklessly disturbing roosting bats or obstructing access to their roosts; 
makes species offences arrestable, increases the time limits for some prosecutions 
and increases penalties.  
1.5.2 
The Wildlife and Countryside Act, the Habitats Regulations and the CRoW Act, 
together make it an offence, among other things, to recklessly, intentionally or 
deliberately: 
 
Deliberately capture, injure or kill any wild animal of an EPS, 
 
Deliberately disturb wild animals of any such species, and, 
 
Damage or destroy a breeding site or resting place of such an animal 
1.5.3 
Disturbance is defined as that which is likely: 
 
To impair their ability: 
o To survive, to breed or reproduce, or to rear or nurture their young, or 
o In the case of animals of a hibernating or migratory species, to hibernate 
or migrate; or 
 
To affect significantly the local distribution or abundance of the species to 
which they belong.

1.5.4 
A bat roost is defined as “any structure or place (including trees) which any bat 
uses for shelter or protection”.  Because bats tend to re-use the same roosts, legal 
opinion is that the roost is protected whether or not the bat(s) are present at the 
time.  
1.5.5 
If the proposed Project is likely to destroy or disturb bats or their roosts, then a 
European Protected Species License (EPSL) will be required from Natural 
Resources Wales (NRW), which would be subject to appropriate mitigation and 
working methods to protect bats.  
1.5.6 
This is a brief summary of the legislation.  When dealing with individual cases, the 
client is advised to consult the full texts of the relevant legislation and obtain further 
legal advice. 
1.6 
Quality Assurance 
1.6.1

Integrated Management System (IMS).  Our IMS places great emphasis on 
professionalism, technical excellence, quality, environmental and Health and Safety 
management.  All staff members are committed to establishing and maintaining our 
certification to the international standards BS EN ISO 9001:2008 and 14001:2004 
and BS OHSAS 18001:2007.  In addition, our IMS requires careful selection and 
monitoring of the performance of all sub-consultants and contractors.   
1.6.2 
All AECOM Ecologists who worked on this project are members of (at the 
appropriate level) the Chartered Institute of Ecology and Environmental 
Management (CIEEM) and follow their code of professional conduct (CIEEM, 2013) 
when undertaking ecological work.  
1.7 
Methodology 
a) Desk study 
1.7.1 
The desk study was completed as part of the AECOM PEA (AECOM, 2017).  In 
relation to bats, the objectives of the desk study were to review the existing 
information available in the public domain to identify the following: 
 
Special Areas of Conservation (SACs) and Sites of Special Scientific Interest 
(SSSIs) designated for bats within a 10km radius of the Project Site boundary 
paying due regard to Bat Conservation Trust (BCT) guidelines (Collins, 2016) , 
using the Multi Agency Geographic Information for the Countryside (MAGIC) 
website (NE, 2017);  
 
Bat records up to 2km from the Project Site boundary, purchased from the 
South East Wales Biodiversity Records Centre (SEWBReC);  
 
Ancient Semi-Natural Woodland (ASNW), Plantation on Ancient Woodland Site 
(PAWS), Restored Ancient Woodland Site (RAWS) or Ancient Woodland Site 
of Unknown category (AWSU) within or adjacent to the Project Site using 
Ancient Woodland Inventory 2011 dataset downloaded from the Lle website 
(WG and NRW, 2017);

 
The Section 7 list of species of Principal Importance for Conservation of 
Biological Diversity in Wales; and, 
 
Features of ecological interest surrounding the Project Site, and features 
connecting these habitats (e.g. hedgerows, watercourses, railway lines) using 
aerial photographs and Ordnance Survey (OS) maps.   
1.7.2 
The County Ecologist and Glamorgan Bat Group was consulted regarding locally 
designated site citations, local bat records not available from SEWBReC and any 
local knowledge about the area. 
b) Bat Roosts in Buildings 
i. 
Preliminary Ground Level Roost Assessments 
1.7.3 
There are no buildings within the Project Site. Buildings adjacent (adjacent is 
defined as up to 20m from the Site boundary) to the Project Site boundary were 
classified into categories dependent on the presence of features suitable as bat 
roost habitat.   
1.7.4 
The assessment was conducted via an external appraisal from the ground using 
binoculars where necessary.  Table 1.1 provides descriptions of the roost potential 
categories for buildings.  
ii. Emergence/Re-Entry Surveys  
1.7.5 
Surveys paid due regard to Bat Surveys: Good Practice Guidelines (Collins, 2016).  
Each survey consisted of two surveyors stood around the buildings so that bats 
could be observed leaving/re-entering Potential Roost Features (PRF).  Bat activity 
was also recorded if observed by the surveyors.  
1.7.6 
Emergence surveys started at least 15 minutes before sunset and continued for 2 
hours.  The dawn re-entry survey started at least 2 hours before sunrise and 
continued until 15 minutes after sunrise.   
1.7.7 
Broadband frequency division detectors were used and digital recordings were 
made to assist with species identification if required.

High 
A structure with one or more potential roost 
sites that are obviously suitable for use by 
larger numbers of bats on a more regular 
basis and potential for longer periods of time 
due to their size, shelter, protection, 
conditions (e. g.  temperature, humidity, 
height above ground level, light levels or 
levels of disturbance) and surrounding 
habitat.   
Can include structures with points of access 
to the interior of the building and poorly 
maintained fabric providing ready access 
points for bats into structures, but at the same 
time not draughty.  Structures of traditional 
stone, brick or timber construction.  
Structures with large (>20cm) roof timbers 
with mortice joints, cracks and holes.  
Structures of pre or early 20th century 
construction.  Structures with large 
complicated and/or uncluttered roof spaces 
providing unobstructed flying spaces.  
Structures with weather boarding and/or 
hanging tiles with gaps.  Structures with 
accessible south facing roofs.  Structures with 
proximity to good foraging habitat such as 
woodland, wetland, water and /or good 
hedgerows.  
A tree with one or more 
potential roost sites that 
are obviously suitable 
for use by larger 
numbers of bats on a 
more regular basis and 
potential for longer 
periods of time due to 
their size, shelter, 
protection, conditions (e. 
g.  temperature, 
humidity, height above 
ground level, light levels 
or levels of disturbance) 
and surrounding habitat.  
Moderate 
A structure with one or more potential roost 
sites that could be used by bats due to their 
size, shelter, protection, conditions (e. g.  
temperature, humidity, height above ground 
level, light levels or levels of disturbance) and 
surrounding habitat but unlikely to support a 
roost of high conservation status.   
Can include structures with some potential to 
support roosting bats, but fewer features than 
a high risk building.  Features may include 
areas suitable for crevice dwelling and/or 
access points into structures.  Some proximity 
to foraging habitat.   
A tree with one or more 
potential roost sites that 
could be used by bats 
due to their size, shelter,

Can include structures constructed from 
unsuitable materials e. g.  prefabricated with 
steel and sheet material.  Structure is 
draughty, light and cool buildings with no 
roosting opportunities.  High levels of regular 
disturbance including external and/or internal 
lighting.  Building is isolated from areas of

c) Bat Roosts in Trees 
i. 
Preliminary Ground Assessment 
1.7.8 
Trees within or adjacent (adjacent is defined as up to 20m from the Site boundary) 
to the Project Site boundary were classified into categories dependent on the 
presence of features suitable as bat roost habitat.   
1.7.9 
Trees up to 50m from the Generating Equipment Site were classified into 
categories dependent on the presence of features suitable as bat roost habitat. 
1.7.10 The assessment was conducted via an external appraisal from the ground using 
binoculars where necessary.  Table 1.1 provides descriptions of the roost potential 
categories for trees.  
1.7.11 Eleven trees with bat roost potential were identified during the PEA (AECOM, 
2017).  Thirty four trees were identified during a ground level roost assessment of 
trees in July 2017.   
ii. Potential Roost Feature Climbed Inspection Survey  
1.7.12 Following the ground level roost assessment trees which were assessed as having 
‘Low or Moderate’ bat roost potential were subject to a PRF climbed inspection.  No 
trees with High bat roost potential were identified.  
1.7.13 These PRF climbed inspections were undertaken in August 2017.  The inspections 
were completed by certified and bat licenced tree climbers.  
1.7.14 The inspections paid due regard to Bat Surveys: Good Practice Guidelines (Collins, 
2016), Bat Workers Manual (Mitchell-Jones and McLeish, 2004) and Bats and 
Woodland Management (Forestry Commission, 2005).  
1.7.15 Trees were climbed using ropes and/or ladders.  Once accessed, features were 
examined in detail using a torch, endoscope or mirror to inspect (where possible) 
the full extent of the features and search for bats or evidence of bat activity (e. g.  
droppings, urine stains, odour, feeding remains, scratch marks, grease stains, wear 
marks).  Where necessary, trees were re-categorised following the PRF climbed 
inspection.  
1.7.16 Two trees identified as having bat roost potential during the preliminary ground 
level roost assessments were not climbed as they were approximately 20 and 55 
metres outside of the Project Site boundary. 
1.7.17 Sixteen trees could not be accessed and two could not be found during the PRF 
climbed inspections, as described in the Limitations.

iii. Emergence/Re-Entry Surveys  
1.7.18 Following the ground level roost assessment and PRF climbed inspections, 
emergence/re-entry surveys were undertaken on trees with a category of Moderate 
or above.  
1.7.19 Surveys paid due regard to Bat Surveys: Good Practice Guidelines (Collins, 2016). 
Each survey consisted of one surveyor stood so that bats could be observed 
leaving/re-entering the PRF. Bat activity was also recorded if observed by the 
surveyors. 
1.7.20 Emergence surveys started at least 15 minutes before sunset and continued for 2 
hours (see Limitations). The dawn re-entry survey started at least 2 hours before 
sunrise and continued until 15 minutes after sunrise.  
1.7.21 Broadband frequency division detectors were used and digital recordings were 
made to assist with species identification if required. The weather conditions during 
the surveys were recorded and were largely considered favourable for bats.  
Survey dates and weather conditions are given in Table 1.3. 
d)  Bat Activity Surveys 
i. 
Preliminary Assessment of Potential Commuting and Foraging Habitat 
1.7.22 The Project Site was assessed as having High commuting and foraging potential 
for bats (Collins, 2016) during the PEA (AECOM, 2017).  Habitats within the Project 
Site were classified into categories dependent on the presence of features suitable 
for bats to commute and forage.  Table 1.2 provides category descriptions for 
commuting and foraging habitat.

water.   
Low 
Habitat that could be used by small numbers of commuting bats 
such as a gappy hedgerow or un-vegetated stream, but isolated, 
i. e.  not very well connected to the surrounding landscape by 
other habitat.   
Suitable, but isolated habitat that could be used by small number 
of foraging bats such as a lone tree (not in a parkland situation) or 
a patch of scrub.   
Negligible 
Negligible habitat features on site likely to be used by commuting 
or foraging bats.

ii. Bat Activity – Walked Transects 
1.7.23 Surveys paid due regard to Bat Surveys: Good Practice Guidelines (Collins, 2016).  
Two walked transect routes were developed to sample the Project Site, one in the 
north and one in the south. These are shown on Figures 3.1-3.3.  
1.7.24 Each transect was walked twice per month. Dusk activity surveys were completed 
in June, July, August, September and October 2017. One dusk and dawn survey 
within one 24 hour period was completed in September 2017.  
1.7.25 No surveys were completed in April and May 2017 due to the late commencement 
of the Project.   Activity surveys following the methodology above are due to be 
undertaken in April and May 2018.  
1.7.26 Each survey consisted of two surveyors walking a pre-determined transect route at 
a steady pace across the Project Site.  The start point and direction of each 
transect was varied across the months to reduce bias. 
1.7.27 The transect contained set Listening Points (LPs) which the surveyors stopped at 
for three minutes.  Each transect contained 12 LPs, with the exception of the first 
set of surveys in June which had 11 LPs (see Limitations). The locations of the LPs 
are shown on Figures 3.1 to3.3.  
1.7.28 Tables 1.17 and 1.18 describe the habitat at each of the LPs. 
1.7.29 Dusk transect surveys began 15 minutes before sunset and continued for up to 3 
hours after sunset, except for on one occasion (see Limitations).  The dawn 
transect started at least 2 hours before sunrise and continued until sunrise, except 
for on one occasion (see Limitations).   
1.7.30 A broadband frequency division detector was used (Bat Box Duet with EM3) and 
digital recordings made to assist with species identification if required.   
1.7.31 The weather conditions for all but one of the surveys (see Limitations) completed to 
date was considered to be favourable for bats.  The weather conditions and survey 
dates are given in Table 1.3. 
e) Data Analysis and Interpretation 
1.7.32 Bat echolocation call analysis where required was undertaken by a suitably 
experienced ecologist, with support from reference material including the British Bat 
Calls Species Identification Guide (Russ, 2012).  The Analook software programme 
was used to analyse bat calls.  
1.7.33 Long-eared bats have very quiet calls and these are often not recorded on bat 
detectors but may be audible using bat detectors. Where long-eared bats are 
suspected but the call has not been recorded then the long-eared bat (possible) 
category has been used. This is shown in Tables 1.8 to 1.12.

1.7.34 Using the walked transect data, a Bat Activity Index (BAI) was calculated as the 
number of passes per hour divided by the survey time.  Survey time has been 
calculated to the nearest 15 minutes, expressed as 0.25 hours, to account for minor 
differences in survey duration (see Limitations).  
1.7.35 Bat activity is an indication of the amount of use bats make of an area (Collins, 
2016). A bat pass is defined by BCT as a sequence of greater than two 
echolocation calls made as a single bat flies past the microphone (BCT, 2017).  A 
bat pass is an index of bat activity rather than a measure of number of individuals in 
a population (Collins, 2016).  
1.7.36 Calculated values within this report have been given to one decimal place, except 
for in Table 1.13.

1.8 
Limitations 
1.8.1 
Biological records can be received from a wide variety of sources and may or may 
not be comprehensive and accurate.  However, if assessed in conjunction with a 
survey, they can contribute to a robust ecological assessment of a site.   
a) 
Potential Roost Feature Climbed Inspection Survey  
1.8.2 
There are 16 trees which were not climbed due to access and/or health and safety 
restrictions and there are two trees which were not climbed as they could not be 
found due to dense woodland, however were the subject of emergence survey at a 
later date.  These trees did not have their bat roost potential category altered from 
the original assigned category and all trees with a Moderate bat roost potential 
category subsequently had an emergence/re-entry surveys. Therefore this is not 
deemed to be a significant limitation.  
b) 
Roost Survey  
1.8.3 
Building 1 was not fully assessed due to time constraints (AECOM, 2017). However 
this building is approximately 120m outside of the Project Site boundary and no 
further surveys were considered necessary on this building. Therefore this is not a 
significant limitation.  
1.8.4 
Access was not granted to Buildings 6, 7 and 8 (collectively known as Abergelli 
Farm) to the west of, but outside, the Project Site and these could not be assessed 
for their potential to support roosting bats.  However, these buildings (BSG 
Buildings 3, 4 and 5) were previously assessed by BSG (PEIR Appendix 8.8) (see 
Table 1.4).  The previous results will be used in the assessment. 
c) Bat Activity Walked Transect Survey 
1.8.5 
The first set of June walked transect surveys had 11 LPs per transect, this was 
increased to 12 LPs per transect for all subsequent surveys.  This was done to 
increase the spread of sample points.  This is not deemed to be a significant 
limitation to the surveys or this report.  
1.8.6 
On 10 July 2017 during the Northern Transect the SD recording card briefly came 
out of the EM3 bat detector and calls during that period were not recorded 
electronically.  However, this was replaced and all bats heard during the period 
were recorded on the survey sheet and were of common species which the 
surveyor was able to determine species identification with confidence.  This is not 
deemed to be a significant limitation to the survey or the results.   
1.8.7 
On 13 September 2017 the dawn South Transect survey finished at 06:42 which 
was 5 minutes before sunrise, however no bats had been heard since 06:16 and 
therefore this is not deemed to be a significant limitation. 
Abergelli PEIR 2018 – BAT ACTIVITY TRANSECT AND ROOST SURVEY

AECOM 
20 
 
 
1.8.8 
On a small number of occasions surveyors walked past an LPs or LPs were not 
accessible meaning that bat data was not recorded for 3 minutes at that location. 
For calculations of Bat Activity Index, the survey time at each LP has been adjusted 
to reflect this variation and should mitigate the impact of this limitation of the 
comparisons of bat activity between LPs. The occasions are listed below:  
 
On 10 July 2017 North Transect LP 4 was missed;   
 
On 23 August and 7, 11 and 12 September 2017, North Transect LP1 was not 
accessible due to horses being present in the field. A replacement LP was 
completed as close as possible to the original location at LP1a, as shown on 
Figure 5.2; 
 
On 7 and 13 September 2017 LP7 on the South Transect not accessible due to 
the presence of rams in the field.  On 7 September 2017, LP9 was missed, this 
was replaced with LP9a (see Table 1. 11, LP9a and Figure 5. 3).  As LP9 was 
replaced with another LP close to the original location, this is not deemed to be 
a significant limitation;  
 
On 3 October 2017, LP9 was missed, this was replaced with LP9b (See Table 
1. 11, LP9b and Figure 5. 3).  As LP9 was replaced with another LP close to 
the original location, this is not deemed to be a significant limitation.  
1.8.9 
No surveys were completed in April and May 2017 due to the late commencement 
of the Project.  Best practice guidelines recommend transect surveys are 
undertaken between April and October (Collins, 2016).  Activity walked transect 
surveys following the methodology described above are due to be undertaken in 
April and May 2018.   
1.8.10 The weather conditions encountered on the dusk transect surveys on 13 
September 2017 (see Table 1.3) were not considered wholly favourable for bats, 
but not so bad as to need to abandon the survey.  There was light rain at 21:33 and 
a spell of heavy rain between 21:50 and 22:17.  The North Transect was also 
sampled at dusk on 11 September 2017 in September in favourable weather 
conditions. 
1.8.11 It was not possible to incorporate land within the National Grid land within a walked 
bat activity transect due to due to site access restrictions at night and during the 
early morning.     
d) Data Analysis and Interpretation 
1.8.12 Different bat species vary in their likelihood of detection using bat detectors and 
therefore it is not relevant to compare numbers of bat passes from different species 
(Collins, 2016).

Previous Bat Roost 
and Activity Surveys -  
BSG Ecology 2014  
Previous surveys have been undertaken by BSG Ecology. See 
PEIR Appendix 8.8 . 
 
The Site boundary included within these reports is different to the 
2017 Project Site boundary. The 2017 Project Site is smaller than 
the red line boundary used by BSG in 2014, however lies entirely 
within the area covered by the 2014 BSG surveys. A summary of 
the previous bat species surveys is detailed below:

inspections of buildings confirmed non- maternity roosts in three 
buildings. These are shown in Appendix 2A: 
 BSG Building 4: A scattering of long-eared bat, pipistrelle and 
lesser horseshoe bat droppings were found in the store rooms; 
 BSG Building 8: Small piles of long-eared bat and pipistrelle 
droppings found in both first and second storey at the north of 
the building; and,  
 BSG Building 10: Two pipistrelle droppings were found on the 
floor.  
 
BSG Building 1, 2, 5 and 11 were categorised as having 
Moderate bat roost potential.  BSG Building 7 was categorised as 
having Low bat roost potential.  BSG Building 3 and 9 were 
categorised as having Negligible bat roost potential (Hundt, 
2012). 
The buildings identified by BSG in 2014 fall outside of the 2017 
Project Site.  However, some of these buildings adjacent to the 
Project Site have been reassessed by AECOM in 2017.  Details 
are provided in Table 1.5.   
 
Tree – Ground Level Roost Assessments 
Thirty three trees were considered to have potential to support 
roosting bats.  29 of these were subject to a climbed inspection. 
Emergence and/or re-entry surveys were carried out on eight 
trees.  BSG Trees T3, T4 and T9 are located within the 2017 
Project Site.  No bats were recorded emerging or re-entering any 
potential roost features. No tree roosts were identified. Trees 
within the Project Site have been reassessed by AECOM in 2017.  
Details are provided in Section 1. 11.  
Bat Activity Walked Transect Surveys 
At least seven species of bat were recorded during transect 
surveys; common pipistrelle, soprano pipistrelle, Myotis sp., long-
eared bat, noctule, Leisler’s bat, and lesser horseshoe bat.  All of 
these species and an additional three were recorded during 
automated 
static 
detector 
surveys; 
Nathusius’ 
pipistrelle 
Pipistrellus nathusii, serotine Eptesicus serotinus and greater 
horseshoe Rhinolophus ferrumequinum.

Buildings - Preliminary Ground Level Roost Assessments 
1.9.2 
Five buildings were assessed for their potential to support roosting bats in 2017 
and 11 buildings were assessed by BSG in 2014.  The results of the assessment 
are provided in Table 1.5.  
1.9.3 
Building locations are provided in Figure 2. A map showing the AECOM 2017 
results is provided in Figure 4.1 and a map showing the 2014 BSG building 
locations is provided in Figure 4.2. 
1.9.4 
Access was not granted to Buildings 6, 7 and 8 (known as Abergelli Farm) in 2017 
(outside the Project Site) and therefore these could not be assessed for their 
potential to support roosting bats in 2017.  Details are given in Section 1.9 
Limitations.

ii. Bat Roosts in Trees 
Trees - Preliminary Ground Level Roost Assessment 
1.9.7 
The results of the preliminary ground level roost assessment are provided in 
Appendix 1A.  
Trees - Potential Roost Feature Climbed Inspections 
1.9.8 
All trees with Low or Moderate bat roost potential were put forward for climbed 
inspection.  A full table of results from the climbed inspections are provided in 
Appendix 1A.  
1.9.9 
All trees inspected were reduced to Negligible or Low bat roost potential. No bat 
roosts were identified.   
1.9.10 Trees 3, 19, 21, 36 and 44 could not be accessed and therefore retained their 
original Moderate rating. These trees were taken forward for emergence and re-
entry surveys, in the absence of the climbed inspection assessment.  
1.9.11 Trees with Low bat roost potential do not require further survey but may need to be 
checked for roosting bats before removal.   
Emergence/Re-entry Surveys 
1.9.12 The results of the emergence /re-entry surveys are provide in Table 1.7. The 
locations of the trees and the roost results are shown on Figure 4.   
1.9.13 Of the five trees surveyed, one bat roost was confirmed in Tree 19.  Whilst the bat 
was seen entering the tree, no calls were detected. This is possibly due to the 
distance of the tree canopy from the surveyor, and the angle of the bat from the 
detector. It has been concluded that the species is likely to be a common pipistrelle, 
because a brief common pipistrelle pass was heard approximately nine seconds 
before the roosting bat was seen flying around and then disappearing into the 
crown of Tree 19.  
1.9.14 A Photograph of Tree 19 is provided in Plate 1.1.

Preliminary Project Site Assessment 
a) Bat Roosts 
i. 
Bat Roosts in Buildings  
1.10.1 There are no buildings, and hence no building bat roosts, within the Project Site.  
1.10.2 Buildings adjacent to the Project Site were assessed. None of the buildings 
surveyed by AECOM supported bat roosts. Previous surveys by BSG in 2014 
confirmed roosts in buildings not surveyed by AECOM in 2017 (PEIR Appendix 
8.8). This is expressed below and shown on Figure 4.2:  
 
AECOM Building 1:  Unknown Roost Status. Not surveyed by AECOM or BSG, 
Building is approximately 125m from the Project Site boundary. 
 
AECOM Building 2:  Confirmed as a long-eared and pipistrelle roost by BSG in 
2014 (BSG Building 8) (PEIR Appendix 8.8). Not surveyed by AECOM. It is 
approximately 120m outside of the Project Site boundary. 
 
AECOM Building 3:  No Roost. 
 
AECOM Building 4:  No Roost. 
 
AECOM Building 5:  No Roost. 
 
AECOM Building 6:  No Roost. 
 
AECOM Building 7:  Confirmed as a lesser horseshoe, long-eared and 
pipistrelle roost by BSG in 2014 (BSG Building 4) (PEIR Appendix 8.8). Not 
surveyed by AECOM. It is approximately 90m outside of the Project Site 
boundary. 
 
AECOM Building 8:  Unknown Roost Status.  BSG internal inspection did not 
find evidence of bats but not all areas were accessible (BSG Building 5) (PEIR 
Appendix 8.8). Due to the bat roost features identified by BSG an internal 
inspection only is not sufficient to determine if this building is being used as a 
bat roost.  Not surveyed by AECOM. The building is approximately 65m from 
the Project Site boundary. 
 
BSG Building 1: Unknown Roost Status.  BSG internal inspection did not find 
evidence of bats but not all areas were accessible (BSG (PEIR Appendix 8.8). 
Due to the bat roost features identified by BSG an internal inspection only is not 
sufficient to determine if this building is being used as a bat roost.  Not 
surveyed by AECOM. The building is approximately 265m from the Project Site 
boundary. 
 
BSG Building 2:  Unknown Roost Status.  BSG internal inspection did not find 
evidence of bats but not all areas were accessible (BSG (PEIR Appendix 8.8). 
Due to the bat roost features identified by BSG an internal inspection only is not 
sufficient to determine if this building is being used as a bat roost.  Not 
surveyed by AECOM as the building is approximately 290m from the Project 
Site boundary. 
 
BSG Building 9:  No Roost.  BSG internal inspection did not find any evidence 
of use by bats (PEIR Appendix 8.8). Due to the lack of features suitable for bats 
an internal inspection is sufficient to determine if this building as a roost. Not 
surveyed by AECOM as the building is approximately 235m from the Project 
Site boundary.

 
BSG Building 10: Confirmed as a pipistrelle roost by BSG in 2014 (PEIR 
Appendix 8.8). Not surveyed by AECOM. It is approximately 155m outside of 
the Project Site boundary. 
 
BSG Building 11:  Unknown Roost Status.  BSG internal inspection did not find 
any evidence of use by bats (PEIR Appendix 8.8). Due to the bat roost features 
identified by BSG an internal inspection only is not sufficient to determine if this 
building is being used as a bat roost.  Not surveyed by AECOM. The building is 
approximately 195m from the Project Site boundary. 
 
ii. Bat Roosts in Trees 
1.10.3 Tree 19 is a lone male or non-breeding female common pipistrelle summer roost.  
No other trees were identified as bat roosts. A photograph of Tree 19 is shown in 
Plate 1.1.  
b) Bat Activity – Walked Transect - Species Composition 
1.10.4 At least 10 species of bat were recorded foraging and/or commuting in close 
proximity of and within the Project Site.  The following species have been identified 
during bat surveys at the Project Site: 
 
Lesser horseshoe; 
 
Common pipistrelle; 
 
Soprano pipistrelle; 
 
Nathusius’ pipistrelle; 
 
Daubenton’s; 
 
Natterer’s; 
 
Mytois species; 
 
Noctule; 
 
Serotine; 
 
Long-eared species; and, 
 
Indeterminate species.  
1.10.5 Nathusius’ pipistrelle and serotine were not identified during the BSG 2014 activity 
transect surveys (PEIR Appendix 8.8).  Leisler’s bat was identified during the BSG 
2014 activity transect surveys (PEIR Appendix 8.8) but was not identified during the 
2017 surveys.  
1.10.6 Common and soprano pipistrelles were the most commonly recorded species in the 
Project Site.  Overall pipistrelle species comprised 86.8 % of all passes recorded 
on the transect surveys; they were also the most commonly recorded species 
during the emergence/re-entry surveys. Pipistrelle species comprised of 89.5% of 
the passes recorded on the North Transect and 84.6% of the passes recorded on 
the South Transect.   
1.10.7 Pipistrelle species were similarly the most commonly recorded species during the 
BSG 2014 transects surveys (PEIR Appendix 8.8).

43 
 
 
1.10.8 Two passes of Nathusius’ pipistrelle were recorded during the July transect 
surveys, one record from the South Transect and one record from the North 
Transect, making up 0.2% of total bat passes.  
1.10.9 Overall Myotis species comprised 9.8% of the total calls recorded on the transect 
surveys. Myotis species comprised 7.7% of the passes recorded on the North 
Transect and 11.5% of the calls recorded on the South Transect  
1.10.10 Activity levels for Myotis species during the 2017 transects surveys were 
comparable with the activity levels recorded during the BSG 2014 transect surveys 
(PEIR Appendix 8.8).  
1.10.11 Overall noctule and serotine bats comprised 1.8% of the passes recorded on 
transect surveys. Noctule and serotine bats comprised of 1.9% of the passes 
recorded on the North Transect and 1.8% of the passes recorded on the South 
Transect.   BSG did not breakdown these species into percentages.  
1.10.12 Long-eared and possible long-eared bat comprised a total of 0.5% of the passes 
recorded on the North Transect and 0.6% recorded on the South Transect   
surveys.  BSG did not breakdown these species into percentages. 
1.10.13 There was a single lesser horseshoe bat pass, recorded on the South Transect, 
equating to 0.2% of the total passes for the South Transect and 0.1% of the total 
passes for the Project Site.  This was recorded in August 2017.  BSG 2014 also 
recorded only one lesser horseshoe bat pass, again recorded on the BSG south 
transect.

c) Bat Activity – Walked Transect - Spatial Distribution 
1.10.14 Figure 5.1 shows the spatial distribution of individual bat passes recorded during 
the transect surveys.  
1.10.15 In total 940 bat passes were recorded during the walked transects.   
1.10.16 Higher levels of activity were recorded in the Southern Transect (513 bat passes; 
15.2 BAI), compared to the Northern Transect (427 bat passes, 13. 2 BAI). The bat 
activity levels are broadly similar.  
1.10.17  Bat activity was recorded across the Project Site (Figure 5.1). Vegetated stream or 
wet ditch corridors appear to be important for bats within the Project Site. The 
distribution of bat call suggests the following general patterns of activity. This is a 
qualitative assessment only: 
 
Pipistrelle bats were recorded across the Project Site;  
 
Myotis Species showed some association with mature tree lines and/or areas 
near water; 
 
Noctule and Serotine bats were primarily recorded at height over open fields 
across the Project Site; 
 
Long-eared bats showed some association with mature tree lines and are 
focused more towards the centre and south-east of the Project Site.  The 
passes recorded are within approximately 315m to 700m of the BSG confirmed 
long-eared roost in Building 7 and approximately 270m and 850m of the BSG 
confirmed long-eared roost in Building 2;  
 
The single lesser horseshoe was recorded on the South Transect along a 
mature tree line approximately 900m south of the closest known lesser 
horseshoe roost in Building 2. 
 
i. 
North Transect 
1.10.18 Figure 5.2 shows the spatial spread of bat passes recorded on the North Transect.  
1.10.19 Table 1.16 below, provides the BAI values for the North Transect LPs and a 
description of the habitat at the LP. 
1.10.20 LP2 and LP8 had the highest diversity of bat species, with a total of four different 
species recorded at each.  
1.10.21 LP3 had the highest BAI, with LP4 having the second highest BAI. LP11 had the 
lowest BAI, with only one bat pass was recorded over all the months. 
1.10.22 LP3 is located adjacent to a watercourse and riparian woodland with mature trees.  
LP4 is located next to a row of mature trees which are connected to the Abergelli 
Farm buildings to the west and a watercourse to the east.  
1.10.23 Photographs highlighting some of the habitat types within the North Transect are 
provided in Plate 1.2.

1.10.24 Figure 5.3 shows the spatial spread of individual bat records during the north 
transect surveys.  
1.10.25 Table 1.17 provides the BAI values for the South Transect LPs and a description of 
the habitat at the LP. 
1.10.26 LP4, LP8 and LP10 had the highest level of diversity of bat species, with a total of 
four different species recorded at each.  
1.10.27 LP5 had the highest BAI, with LP6 having the second highest BAI.  Only one bat 
pass was recorded at LP12 over all the months.   
1.10.28 LP5 is located next to an area of riparian woodland and watercourse.  
1.10.29 LP6 is located at the end of a mature tree line, next to a wet ditch and marshy 
grassland. LP5 and LP6 are located within the south-east of the Project Site.

d) Bat Activity – Walked Transect - Temporal Distribution 
1.10.31 Bat activity was recorded at the Project Site between June and October 2017.  Bat 
surveys for April and May are due to be undertaken in 2018.  
1.10.32 August had the highest BAI for both transects. The North Transect had a BAI of 8.5 
and the South Transect had a BAI of 4.8 
1.10.33 For the North Transect, the second highest BAI was in June and July, both with Bai 
of 7.0. 
1.10.34 For the South Transect, the second highest BAI was 3.0 in July and the third 
highest was 2.8 in October.   
1.10.35 Young bats are typically born in June and July and during August the young are 
starting to leave the roosts to fly and feed. October is part of the bat mating period 
and a time when bats are extensively foraging for food as they are looking to store 
fat for the winter hibernation period. The general ecology of bat species is likely to 
influence the temporal activity for the Project Site.

1.11 
Preliminary Potential Effects 
1.11.1 A full assessment of effects at construction and operation has been undertaken for 
the Ecological Impact Assessment (EcIA) and reported in the ES.  
1.11.2 Figure 7 indicates the location of potential constraints / impacts.  At this stage the 
following potential effects have been identified:  
a) Bat Roosts 
i. 
Destruction and Loss of a Roost 
1.11.3 Tree 19 was the only confirmed roost within the Project Site.  The proposed Project 
will not require the removal of Tree 19.   
ii. Killing and Injury 
1.11.4 Based on the current known distribution of bat roosts within the Project Site, there 
is no risk of killing or injuring bats during construction and operation.  
iii. Disturbance 
1.11.5 Without mitigation, there is potential for disturbance to bats due to noise and 
vibration during construction and operation and external lighting during construction 
and operation.  
b) Bat Commuting and Foraging 
i. 
Habitat Loss 
1.11.6 The Project Site is used by bats, particularly the vegetated watercourse/wet ditch 
corridors, followed by woodland edges and hedgerows with mature trees.   
1.11.7 A proportion of the broadleaved semi-natural woodland, semi-improved grassland 
and marshy grassland will be removed as part of the proposed Project. Without 
mitigation, hedgerows and mature trees lines will be removed for construction of 
the cable route and access track. This will reduce the amount of habitat available to 
foraging bats.  
ii. Severance and Fragmentation 
1.11.8 The removal of trees and woodland is required to facilitate the construction of the 
proposed access track. Without mitigation, this will sever the connectivity to 
habitats either side of the track, resulting in severance and fragmentation of 
retained areas.  
1.11.9 The removal of tree lines and hedgerows may be required in order to facilitate the 
construction of the new gas route in the north of the Project Site. Removal or 
severance of tree lines and hedgerow will sever the connectivity they provide and 
create fragmentation of retained habitat.

AECOM

1.11.10 During construction of the Project natural habitats including hedgerows and tree 
lines will be removed and converted to new areas of hardstanding and buildings.  
This will fragment and sever the connectivity of the habitats located to the north and 
to the south of the Project. This will impact on bats using the existing features in the 
landscape to commute and forage between these two areas.  
1.11.11 There will be an increase in external lighting at the Project Site during construction 
and operation. There is currently no external lighting within the majority of the 
Project Site. Many species of bat are adverse to light, with different species having 
different tolerances.  External lighting can make areas of previous foraging habitat 
unsuitable and fragment commuting routes.  If external lighting for the proposed 
Project is poorly designed there is potential for a light spill onto hedgerows, tree 
lines, woodland edges and vegetated areas which will negatively impact on bats, 
severing commuting routes and impeding access to foraging habitat.  Poorly 
designed lighting also has the potential to affect areas outside the Project Site 
boundary.

1.12 
Preliminary Recommendations for Further Surveys and Mitigation 
a) Recommendations for Further Surveys 
1.12.1 A full assessment of required further surveys has been made during EcIA and 
reported in the ES.  At this stage it is anticipated that further surveys will be 
required. The following recommendations have been made:  
 
Walked bat activity transect surveys in April and May 2018 using the same 
methodology for the walked bat activity surveys undertaken in 2017; 
 
Static detector bat surveys and assessment to augment the walked transect 
data.  
 
Building assessments and further bat surveys on Buildings 6, 7 and 8  within 
the Abergelli Farm;  
 
In November 2011, a mine shaft and adit, adjacent to the Project Site was 
identified. Underground sites can be of value to hibernating bats, including 
horseshoe, long-eared and Myotis species.  The status of these sites is 
currently unknown, in that it is not known if these features are completely 
capped with no potential bat access points or if they a freely accessible to bats.  
Consultation with National Grid and Abergelli Farm owner is ongoing as well as 
the Coal Authority report on any remediation works which may have been 
undertaken.  Should Health and Safety provisions allow, static bat detectors will 
be placed as near as to the estimated location of the mine shaft and adit during 
December 2017, and January and February 2018. This will be done with the 
aim of any bat activity being recorded in these areas, suggesting a nearby 
hibernation site; and, 
 
Pre-construction checks on trees scheduled for removal for their current bat 
roost potential with consideration of the seasonal survey timings. 
1.12.2 Although further surveys are recommended it is considered that, utilising data from 
2014 and 2017 surveys undertaken to date, an accurate assessment of bat activity 
within the Project Site has been made. Further surveys are recommended to allow 
the most appropriate and effective mitigation measures to be determined and will 
be included in a subsequent CEMP or Ecological Mitigation Plan 
b) Recommendations for Mitigation 
1.12.3 A full series of recommendations for further surveys and mitigation at construction 
and operation has been undertaken for the EcIA and reported in the ES.  At this 
stage the following key recommendations have been made:  
 
Based on the current Project proposals a European Protected Species Licence 
(EPSL) is not a requirement. However, should the scope of the Project  change 
and/or if further bat roosts are identified a EPSL may be required; 
 
Compensate for loss of foraging habitat; 
 
Maintain connectivity of foraging and commuting habitats by the retention of 
trees and hedgerows wherever possible. Figure 7 shows areas of potential 
conflict; 
 
Utilising ‘brown hedgerows’ of brash, to maintain connectivity during 
construction  
Abergelli PEIR 2018 – BAT ACTIVITY TRANSECT AND ROOST SURVEY 
 
 
Prepared for:  Abergelli Power Limited 
AECOM 
54 
 
 
 
Create new green corridors to mitigate loss, provide alternative routes and 
enhance the local landscape;  
 
For construction of the cable route consider directional drilling under 
hedgerows and mature tree lines to avoid felling and avoid severance; 
 
If less important hedgerows need to be severed temporarily during construction 
of the cable route the severed areas should be replanted with whips and 
standards; 
 
It is recommended that reasonable avoidance measures should be taken if any 
trees with a Low bat roost potential need removing as part of the Project 
(Hundt, 2012).  This is likely to include soft-felling of trees under ecological 
supervision from a bat licenced ecologist; 
 
Plant a mix of locally native species of standard trees and whips along both 
sides of the access road to create a ‘hedgerow with trees’; and, 
 
Avoid external lighting wherever possible. Only light areas which need to be lit 
to meet minimum standard. Where external lighting is needed it should be 
designed to avoid and reduce light spill following best practice guidelines for 
lighting and bats (Gunnell 2012, BCT 2009), and should be reviewed by an 
ecologist. Where external road lighting is needed the use of bollards with 
louveres should be considered to keep lighting directional and below head 
height, timer or motion sensors should be used. 
c) Recommendations for Biodiversity Enhancement  
1.12.4 A full series of recommendations for biodiversity enhancement has been made 
during the EcIA and reported in the ES.  At this stage the following precautionary 
recommendations have been made:  
 
Woodcrete bat boxes on trees; 
 
Improve existing hedgerows by infilling with locally native species standard 
trees to maintain connectivity to key foraging areas; and, 
 
Creation of new hedgerows and green corridors of locally native species.
