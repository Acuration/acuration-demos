INTRODUCTION 
1.1 
Overview 
1.1.1 
This document is the non-technical summary (NTS) of the Preliminary 
Environmental Information Report (PEIR) for the Hirwaun Power 
Project (hereafter referred to as the Project). It has been prepared by 
Parsons Brinckerhoff on behalf of Hirwaun Power Limited (HPL). 
1.1.2 
HPL is promoting a new gas fired power station  on land at the Hirwaun 
Industrial Estate, South Wales (approximate grid reference SN 938 
061).  
1.1.3 
The Project comprises three main elements: 
� A new gas fired power generating station (referred to as the Power 
Generation Plant), designed to provide an electrical output of up to 
299 Megawatts (MW); 
� A new electrical connection (referred to as the Electrical 
Connection), which will export electricity from the Power Generation 
Plant to the National Grid substation at Rhigos for distribution to 
homes and businesses; and 
� A new gas connection (referred to as the Gas Connection), which 
will transport  natural gas from the Gas National  Transmission 
System to the Power Generation Plant for use as fuel, together with 
all access requirements.  
1.1.4 
The proposed Power Generation Plant would operate as a ‘peaking 
plant’.  This means it would operate intermittently, with  maximum 
operation not exceeding 1,500 hours per year.  A peaking plant is 
designed to operate  when there is a surge in demand for electricity 
associated with a particular event (e.g. when a large number of people 
boil their kettles following the end of a popular TV programme) or when 
there is a sudden drop in power being generated from power stations 
which are constantly operational (e.g. sudden outages). It will also 
support intermittent forms of renewable energy which are weather 
dependant (e.g. wind and solar).  
1.1.5 
The Power Generation Plant, together with the integral Electrical 
Connection and Gas Connection, constitutes a Nationally Significant 
Infrastructure Project (NSIP), which means that a Development 
Consent Order (DCO) is required to build, operate and maintain it. The 
proposed DCO Application will be processed and examined by the 
Planning Inspectorate who will make a recommendation on whether the

DCO should be granted to the Secretary of State for Energy and 
Climate Change (Secretary of State). The final decision on the 
proposed DCO Application is made by the Secretary of State.  
1.1.6 
Rhondda Cynon Taf County Borough Council (RCTCBC) and the 
Welsh Government will be key consultees throughout the DCO 
process. 
1.1.7 
Consultation with local people, businesses and organisations is also an 
essential part of the DCO process and will help to influence the final 
designs of the Project. 
1.1.8 
The main PEIR and this NTS have been prepared in accordance with 
Regulations 2 and 10 of the Infrastructure Planning (Environmental 
Impact Assessment) Regulations 2009 (the ‘EIA Regulations’).  They 
present information specifically aimed at assisting consultees and local 
communities to understand the nature, scale, and location of the 
proposed Project.   
1.1.9 
Copies of the main PEIR and this NTS may be examined during a 
consultation exercise being carried out by HPL between 17 October 
2013 until 28 November 2013 at Hirwaun Library, Aberdare Library, 
Treherbert Library, Glynneath Library and Merthyr Tydfil Central Library 
and also at the main office of Rhondda Cynon Taf County Borough 
Council Planning Department.  
1.1.10 
Copies of the main PEIR and this NTS can also be found on the Project 
website: www.hirwaunpower.co.uk.  
1.1.11

1.1.12 
Representations must be received on or before 28 November 2013.  
1.2 
Needs and Benefits of the Project 
1.2.1 
National planning policy supports the need for new electricity 
infrastructure due to the current ageing and inevitable closure of older 
coal fired power plants and the likely increase in demand for electricity 
over the coming decades.

1.2.2 
The Government’s policies in relation to NSIPs are set out in National 
Policy Statements (NPSs). NPS EN-1 (the Overarching Energy NPS) 
states that “gas will continue to play an important role in the electricity 
sector – providing vital flexibility to support an increasing amount of 
low-carbon generation and to maintain security of supply” (paragraph 
3.6.2).  
1.2.3 
Gas is a reliable fuel source.  It is acknowledged by the Government as 
being essential to a low-carbon economy and to underpin the country’s 
energy security.  In addition, gas provides back-up to power generation 
from renewable sources, particularly wind power, which is an 
increasingly prevalent but intermittent energy source.  Modern gas fired 
power plants are among the most efficient and cleanest forms of 
electricity power generation. 
1.2.4 
Indications from the Government, in other documents (e.g. the ‘Gas 
Generation Strategy’, released by DECC in December 2012) are that 
up to 26 gigawatts (GW) of new gas generation will be needed by 2030 
to underpin long term electricity supplies and provide back-up to 
nuclear and wind generation at times of peak demand. 
1.2.5 
‘Energy Wales – a low carbon transition’ published by the Welsh 
Assembly states that gas is also a flexible, responsive and reliable 
source of electricity that should support the transition to a low carbon 
economy.  
1.2.6 
With the large number of wind turbines that are now providing electricity 
to the National Grid and the many proposals for further wind turbines 
onshore and offshore, coupled with proposed solar farm developments 
including in South Wales, significant consideration is being given to the 
need for flexible / peaking power on the network. 
1.2.7 
At present, thermal peaking capacity in the UK is relatively small due to 
the nature of the electricity generation mix on the National Grid.  
1.2.8 
There is therefore a clear and significant requirement for further 
capacity to meet the projected need for reactive/flexible generation.  A 
dedicated gas fired peaking plant at the Hirwaun Industrial Estate could 
allow for the rapid provision of reserve capacity to the National Grid, 
thus playing a role in meeting the energy requirements of the UK going 
forward.  
1.3 
The Developer 
1.3.1 
The developer of the proposed Project is HPL.  HPL is the Special 
Purpose Vehicle (SPV) which has been set up to develop the Project

and has been established by Watt Power Limited (WPL). WPL has 
been established to develop flexible gas-fired power stations, designed 
to meet the Government’s energy policy objectives of security of supply 
and affordability, in support of the UK's transition to a low carbon 
economy.  
1.3.2

or http://www.wattpowerltd.co.uk 
1.4 
Purpose of the document 
1.4.1 
The Project requires an Environmental Impact Assessment (EIA) in 
accordance with the EIA Regulations.  EIA is an assessment of the 
Project’s likely significant environmental effects. Under Regulation 
10(b) of the EIA Regulations, HPL must consult on preliminary 
environmental information relating to the Project.  That information has 
been compiled into the main PEIR and summarised in this NTS.    
1.4.2 
The PEIR has been prepared to provide information on the Project as 
part of the pre-application consultation process for the proposed DCO 
Application.  It presents the preliminary environmental information and 
assessments which have been completed to date and identifies the 
additional information or studies required in order to complete the EIA.  
Feedback received during the pre-application consultation process will 
help inform the development of the Project and further refine the EIA. 
The full findings of the EIA will be presented in an Environmental 
Statement (ES) that will be submitted with the proposed DCO 
Application.  
1.4.3 
This document is a summary (in non-technical language) of the PEIR 
for the Project  
1.5 
Planning Policy Context 
1.5.1 
The Department for Energy and Climate Change has published a 
number of NPSs in relation to energy infrastructure, which were 
designated by the Secretary of State in July 2011. These NPSs set out 
national policy against which proposals for NSIPs are assessed and 
decided on.  
1.5.2 
Due to the nature of the proposed Project (which will generate over 
50MW of electricity), four of the designated NPSs are considered 
relevant to the determination of the proposed DCO Application:  
� Overarching National Policy Statement for Energy EN-1: This sets 
out national policy for energy infrastructure as defined by the

Planning Act 2008, which provides the primary basis for decisions 
by the Secretary of State;  
� National Policy Statement for Fossil Fuel Electricity Generating 
Infrastructure EN-2: This sets out policies specific to the 
determination of applications for fossil fuel electricity generating 
infrastructure; 
� National Policy Statement for Gas Supply Infrastructure and Gas 
and Oil Pipelines EN-4: This sets Government policy on the 
relevant considerations and factors that should be taken into 
account as to route selection for developers for, inter alia, gas 
pipelines; and  
� National Policy Statement for Electricity Networks Infrastructure 
(EN-5): This provides the primary basis for decisions taken by the 
Secretary of State on applications it receives for electricity network 
NSIPs, including the relevant considerations and factors that should 
be taken into account related to route selection.  
1.5.3 
NPS EN-1 states that consideration may be given to planning policy 
outside the NPSs where it is important and relevant to the Secretary of 
State's decision. Other national planning policies have therefore been 
considered in the preparation of the PEIR as these may be relevant to 
the determination of the proposed DCO Application

PROJECT AND SITE DESCRIPTION 
2.1 
Site and Surroundings 
2.1.1 
The site for the Project (hereafter referred to as the Project Site) is 
illustrated by the red line in Insert 1 and encompasses all three 
elements of the Project as described in Section 1.1.  Any temporary 
areas for equipment / material laydown, required during construction of 
the Project, would also be located within the Project Site.  The Project 
Site lies entirely within the administrative boundary of RCTCBC, 
although it is also close to the area administered by the Brecon 
Beacons National Park Authority (BBNPA). 
Insert 1 – Location of the Project Site 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
2.1.2 
The Power Generation Plant would be located within the Project Site, 
approximately 1.3 km north east of Rhigos, 1.4 km west of Hirwaun and 
5 km west of Aberdare. The Power Generation Plant Site within the 
Project Site covers an area of approximately 7.5ha. However, the 
footprint of the Power Generation Plant would be smaller than this 
(approximately 5ha). The Power Generation Plant Site is currently 
occupied by large industrial buildings, used for storage and distribution, 
which is owned by International Greetings UK Ltd.   
2.1.3 
The Power Generation Plant Site and immediate surrounding area are 
characterised by industrial buildings, hardstanding, scrub grassland

and plantation woodland.  The A465 ‘Heads of the Valleys’ Road runs 
approximately 0.1km north of the Power Generation Plant Site, Tower 
Colliery is approximately 1 km to the south and Penderyn Reservoir is 
approximately 1 km north.  
2.1.4 
Insert 2 shows an illustrative visual of the Power Generation Plant Site. 
Insert 2 – Illustrative Visual of the Power Generation Plant Site 
 
2.1.5 
At this stage in the Project, the route of the Gas Connection and 
Electrical Connection have yet to be confirmed.  There are  two options 
for each under consideration. Further detail on these options is outlined 
in Sections 2.3 and 2.4 below.  
2.2 
Power Generation Technology 
2.2.1 
The Power Generation Plant would be fired on natural gas. It would 
provide a total output of up to 299 MW (enough to power the equivalent 
of 400,000 homes) and operate as a peaking plant.  Given these 
parameters, it has been determined that a Simple Cycle Gas Turbine 
(SCGT) plant is the preferred and most appropriate technology choice 
for the Project. Further detail is provided in Section 3.3 and a schematic 
showing SCGT operation is shown below in Insert 3. 
2.2.2 
There are several options of SCGT plant available to generate up to 
299 MW.  These different options mainly relate to the number and type 
of gas turbine generator used.

2.2.3 
SCGT plant usually use aero-derivative gas turbine generators (i.e. 
turbines derived from the aeronautical industry), primarily because of 
their suitability to frequent start-ups, flexibility, high efficiency and high-
availability maintenance options.  However, ‘industrial’ type units can 
also be used.  These are typically larger and often more suited to 
longer operational hours.  For the Power Generation Plant, HPL 
envisages using 3, 4 or 5 individual aero-derivative gas turbine 
generators or, alternatively 1 or 2 industrial gas turbine generators to 
generate up to 299 MW.  To allow for a precautionary approach, the 
assessments in the PEIR have been based on the Power Generation 
Plant using 5 individual aero-derivative gas turbine generators unless 
otherwise stated.  This is because 5 gas turbine generators would 
generally have greater impacts on the environment than fewer units 
and is therefore considered to be the realist worst case scenario. 
 
Insert 3 – SCGT Schematic 
 
 
2.2.4 
The main equipment in an SCGT is a gas turbine generator, comprising 
of the following components: 
� Inlet air filter; 
� Air compressor;

� Combustion chamber;  
� Power turbine; and  
� Exhaust silencer. 
2.2.5 
In the gas turbines air is compressed and natural gas is injected.  The 
fuel will then burn in the combustion chamber producing hot, high 
pressure gases.  This gas expands across the blades of the gas turbine 
which drives the electrical generators to produce electricity.  The 
exhaust silencer will reduce noise pollution from this process.  
2.2.6 
The waste gases and heat produced from this process will be released 
to the atmosphere via stacks.  The stack(s) will be equipped with 
emissions control technologies which will reduce emissions released to 
the atmosphere.  
2.2.7 
The Power Generation Plant will have up to five gas turbine generators 
and five stacks, each up to 35m in height.  
2.2.8 
In addition to the gas turbine generators, the following will also be 
present on the Power Generation Plant Site: 
� Process water tanks – for the storage of high purity water for use in 
the gas turbines; 
� Fire Water Tanks; 
� A control building – in order to monitor the plant operation; 
� A workshop and stores building – to store maintenance spares and 
to provide a facility to carry out minor maintenance of the plant; 
� A gatehouse – needed to provide security and maintain a log of site 
attendance / deliveries; 
� Site lighting infrastructure, including perimeter lighting columns; 
� A switchyard – required to connect the Power Generation Plant to 
the National Grid;  
� A gas receiving installation; and  
� A black start generator;

� Internal roadways, car parking, pedestrian network, cycle parking 
and potentially hardstanding for planned maintenance car parking; 
and  
� Site vehicular access(es) potentially including works to the junction 
at Main Avenue 
2.3 
Gas Connection 
2.3.1 
A new underground gas pipeline is required to connect the Power 
Generation Plant to the existing Gas National Transmission System to 
provide a reliable supply of fuel.   
2.3.2 
There are two  connection options (referred to as route corridor options 
1 and 2) for the Project. These are described in more detail below. 
Gas Connection Route Corridor option 1 
2.3.3 
This route is approximately 1.1 km long. 
2.3.4 
It begins at the Power Generation Plant Site, heading south, past 
industrial buildings in the Hirwaun Industrial Estate, across Main 
Avenue and then under Rhigos Road; a single carriageway that runs 
along the entire south side of Hirwaun Industrial Estate.  
2.3.5 
The route continues south of Rhigos Road into fields where it crosses 
under a set of overhead lines and continues heading south east where 
it then crosses two field drains.  The route then turns east where it 
crosses under an unnamed minor road and another field drain. It then 
turns south east again, and heads towards the A4061. The route 
crosses under A4061 in an easterly direction. The route reaches the 
Gas National Transmission System east of the A4061 at Grid 
Reference SN938055.  
Gas Connection Route Corridor Option 2 
2.3.6 
This route is approximately 1.25 km long.  
2.3.7 
The route begins at the Power Generation Plant Site heading south, 
immediately turning east, with mainlaying (laying pipe beneath the 
road) required down Main Avenue. Mid way down Main Avenue the 
route passes under an overhead walkway. The route then continues for 
a short distance up Main Avenue before turning south east through a 
field and reaches Fifth Avenue.  
2.3.8 
The route then turns south, mainlaying down Fifth Avenue, the single 
carriageway road that runs along part of the eastern boundary to the

Power Generation Plant Site.  The route then continues being 
mainlayed across the Rhigos Road/A4061 and continues heading 
south where it crosses under a set of overhead lines.  The route 
continues being mainlayed down Rhigos Road/A4061 before leaving 
the road. 
2.3.9 
The route turns into the field east of the A4061 for a short distance 
before turning back to run south, parallel to the A4061 where it crosses 
under another set of overhead lines. Shortly after crossing the 
overhead lines the route turns to the east where it connects to the Gas 
National Transmission System east of A4061at the same point as route 
corridor option 1.  
Common Elements 
2.3.10 
Land over which Gas Connection route corridor options 1 and 2 will 
cross is initially similar to the Power Generation Plant Site (i.e. 
characterised by the Hirwaun Industrial Estate) although the final two 
thirds of the routes are characterised by agricultural land.   
2.3.11 
The AGI for both connection routes would be accessed via a short 
stretch of track which would be constructed between the A4061 and the 
AGI.  
2.4 
Electrical Connection 
2.4.1 
A new electrical connection would be required to allow electricity 
generated by the Power Generation Plant to be exported to the 
National Grid.  The point of connection to the national grid will be at the 
National Grid Rhigos substation (to the north west of the Power 
Generation Plant Site) which is expected to be completed in 2016.  
2.4.2 
There are two electrical route connection corridors being considered 
and these are as follows.  
Electrical Connection Route Corridor Option 1 
2.4.3 
This route is approximately 250m in length and would consist of a 400 
kV overhead line.  The line would run directly west from the Power 
Generation Plant into the Rhigos Substation. This route option is 
entirely within the area administered by RCTCBC.  
2.4.4 
A maximum of three pylons would be required to support the overhead 
line. The pylons would be approximately 35m in height. One or two 
would be located within the Power Generation Plant Site and one would 
be located within the Rhigos substation.

2.4.5 
Electrical Connection route corridor option 2 crosses over marshy, 
waterlogged ground to the west of the Power Generation Plant Site. 
The closest residential properties to the Electrical Connection are the 
same as those identified for the Power Generation Plant Site. 
Electrical Connection Route Corridor Option 2 
2.4.6 
The route is approximately 650m in length.  It would consist of a 400 Kv 
buried underground cable.  The cable would run from the Power 
Generation Plant Site, alongside Main Avenue, to the south of a 
disused industrial warehouse, before heading north, alongside 
Fourteenth Avenue in between disused industrial warehouse buildings 
before connecting into the Rhigos Substation. This route option is 
entirely within the area administered by RCTCBC.

Hirwaun Industrial Estate. The closest residential properties to the 
Electrical Connection are the same as those identified for the Power 
Generation Plant Site.

SITE SELECTION, ALTERNATIVES AND DESIGN EVOLUTION 
3.1 
Introduction 
3.1.1 
An overview of the alternatives that have been considered for the 
proposed Project as part of the design evolution process is provided 
below.    
3.2 
Alternative Development Sites 
3.2.1 
As part of a detailed feasibility assessment, WPL has looked at a range 
of sites around the UK to support power generation plants of this 
nature. The key factors which WPL considered necessary in a site were 
broadly four fold: technical (e.g. the size of the site and the proximity to 
appropriate gas and electrical connection points), environmental, 
economic and whether the proposals would be in line with local 
planning policy. 
3.2.2 
Based on these factors, the Project Site was considered suitable as it is 
within close proximity to the Gas National Transmission System and to 
a high voltage electrical transmission infrastructure.  The Project Site is 
also within an existing industrial estate, surrounded by similar industrial 
developments. The aims of local planning policy steer employment 
development towards the Hirwaun Industrial Estate.  In addition, there 
is more than adequate space to develop the Power Generation Plant 
and integral infrastructure. 
3.3 
Power Generation Plant 
3.3.1 
Four technology options were originally considered for the 299MW 
Power Generation Plant: SCGT plant, Combined Cycle Gas Turbine 
(CCGT) plant and Reciprocating Gas Engines (RGE) plant.  The 
potential for utilising Combined Heat and Power (CHP) opportunities 
using these technologies was also considered. 
3.3.2 
HPL has undertaken a number of studies as to the technology choice 
and it has been concluded that an SCGT is the most suitable 
technology choice for generating up to 299MW as a peaking plant at 
the Power Generation Plant Site. This has been determined based on 
the following environmental, technical and feasibility considerations: 
� 
Visual impact: the use of a SCGT plant over a CCGT plant limits 
the height of the stack(s) required and therefore the visual impacts 
associated with the Power Generation Plant.   
� 
Water resources: the water requirement of a SCGT plant is 
significantly lower than for a CCGT and CHP plant.

� 
Noise and available space; noise levels from a SCGT plant would 
typically be lower than for an RGE plant. A larger number of RGE 
units would be required at the Power Generation Plant Site to 
generate up to 299MW. Spatially this may not be possible.  
� 
Financial: based on the current electricity market, it is essential that 
the Power Generation Plant of the size proposed will be particularly 
cost effective, as it will be called upon to operate flexibly to balance 
out the National Grid and meet changing demands of customers. 
SCGT plants are better suited to this type of operational regime.  
� 
Start up times: SCGT plants are able to start up and shut down 
much quicker than similar sized CCGT plants and are, therefore, 
better suited to meeting flexible demands.  
3.4 
Gas Connection 
3.4.1 
Four potential options to connect the Power Generation Plant to the 
Gas National Transmission System  were assessed.  Further analysis 
discounted two of the routes for a combination of reasons, including 
proximity to a cemetery and a nature reserve.  Accordingly, the two 
routes described above have been taken further into the assessment.   
3.5 
Electrical Connection 
3.5.1 
Two routes have been considered for the electrical connection. These 
have subsequently been refined and their footprint reduced. The two 
options, as discussed in Section 2.4 have been taken further into the 
assessment.

PRELIMINARY ENVIRONMENTAL IMPACT ASSESSMENT 
4.1 
Environmental Impact Assessment Methodology 
4.1.1 
In accordance with relevant regulations, the EIA process for the Project 
incorporates the following:  
� Establishing, through consultation, the Scope of the EIA including 
obtaining a Scoping Opinion from the Secretary of State; 
� Consideration of any potential technical and environmental 
alternatives;  
� Establishing a comprehensive understanding of the existing 
baseline environmental conditions for the Project Site and the 
relevant study areas for each topic;  
� Identifying the potential environmental impacts resulting from the 
Project;  
� Determining how the potential environmental impacts can be 
avoided, reduced or off-set through informed design and / or further 
mitigation and how its benefits may be enhanced; 
� Assessing the significance of the potential environmental impacts in 
conjunction with other impacts arising from the Project and those 
from other neighbouring developments and / or sources (in-
combination and cumulative impacts); and 
� Proposing options as to how any significant residual impacts will be 
mitigated, managed and monitored.  
4.1.2 
The PEIR is an intermediate step of the EIA process required by the 
EIA Regulations, reporting on information currently available and some 
likely approaches to mitigation measures which might be used to avoid, 
reduce and if possible remedy any significant adverse impacts.   
4.1.3 
Before commencing the EIA for the Project, HPL requested a Scoping 
Opinion from the Secretary of State in May 2013, who then consulted 
bodies such as RCTCBC and Natural Resources Wales (NRW).The 
views given in the formal Scoping Opinion, received in July 2013, have 
been taken into account in preparing the PEIR. 
4.1.4 
Throughout the following sections, the terms construction, operation 
and decommissioning have been used. These are defined as follows:

� Construction – Construction of the Project, including demolition of 
existing buildings. Depending on the final plant selection, this is 
anticipated to take between 18 and 36 months.  
� Operation – Operation of all aspects of the Project, including 
maintenance. The Project is anticipated to have a lifetime of 
approximately 25 years.  
� Decommissioning – Removal of some plant items and site 
reinstatement when the Power Generation Plant has reached the 
end of its operational life. This is anticipated to take a similar time to 
construction. It is likely that the Gas Connection would be left in 
situ.  
4.2 
Air Quality 
Introduction  
4.2.2 
The construction, operation and decommissioning of the Project have 
the potential to impact on air quality both through the generation of dust 
during the construction phase and the generation of stack emissions 
during operation.  
4.2.3 
A desk based assessment, together with air dispersion modelling have 
been carried out to assess any potential air quality impacts resulting 
from the construction, operation and decommissioning of the Project on 
identified receptors. These include residential areas in Hirwaun, 
Pontbren Llwyd and Rhigos, as well as ecological receptors within 10 
km of the Power Generation Plant Site.  
Preliminary Assessment of Potential Impacts 
Power Generation Plant 
Construction  
4.2.4 
The main potential impacts resulting from construction of the Power 
Generation Plant on air quality are from dust generated from 
construction activities (e.g. demolition of existing buildings and 
excavation for new foundations). There is also a small potential for 
impacts arising from exhaust emissions from construction traffic.  
4.2.5 
Despite this, it is considered unlikely that levels of atmospheric dust 
would be generated which would constitute a health hazard or nuisance 
to local people or industry.  Impacts would be minimised through 
successful implementation of an agreed Construction Environmental

Management Plant (CEMP), which would incorporate appropriate dust 
mitigation measures such as damping down or covering of stock piles 
and excavations during dry and windy weather. Additionally, the 
majority of particulates from construction activities settle within a short 
distance of the construction site. Therefore, impacts on receptors 
further afield will be minor following implementation of the CEMP.    
Operation  
4.2.6 
The main potential impacts arising from operation of the Power 
Generation Plant are associated with the stack emissions arising as a 
result of the combustion of natural gas. Emissions from the stack(s) 
include Nitrous Oxides (NOx) and Carbon Monoxide (CO).   
4.2.7 
However, modern gas fired power plant are inherently clean and 
produce far fewer emissions than other fossil fuel power plants (e.g. 
coal) when compared on an energy output basis. Emissions of both 
NOx and CO are strictly limited under national and international 
guidelines such as the Industrial Emissions Directive.  
4.2.8 
Initial air quality modelling has shown that an appropriate stack height 
which will achieve adequate dispersion of NOx and CO to meet 
legislative limits and prevent any impacts to identified receptors is 
between 25m and 35m. It is concluded, therefore, that impacts on air 
quality during operation will be minor.     
Decommissioning  
4.2.9 
During decommissioning of the Power Generation Plant, there is the 
potential for similar impacts as identified during construction. However, 
the same mitigation measures and best practice working guidelines 
would be put in place to ensure any impacts on receptors will be minor 
following implementation of the CEMP.    
Gas Connection (route corridor options 1 and 2) 
Construction 
4.2.10 
Movement of soils from construction activities is anticipated to lead to 
the generation of some short-term airborne soil dust. However, at any 
one location, the construction activities will only occur for a short period 
of time as construction moves along the gas pipeline route.  In some 
locations the impact will be no greater than that experienced by existing 
dust producing agricultural activity and therefore any impacts are likely 
to be minor.

4.2.11 
Given the similarity of the two Gas Connection route corridor options, 
there are not considered to be differences in the potential impacts of 
the different routes.  
Operation 
4.2.12 
During operation of the Gas Connection (no matter which option is 
selected), there will be no impacts to air quality.  
Decommissioning  
4.2.13 
During decommissioning of the Gas Connection, there is the potential 
for similar impacts as identified during construction. However, the same 
mitigation measures and best practice working guidelines would be put 
in place to ensure any impacts are minor.  
Electrical Connection (route corridor options 1 and 2) 
Construction 
4.2.14 
The construction of the Electrical Connection is not anticipated to 
generate significant dust, plant / machinery or traffic emissions due to 
the small scale of the construction / installation works. In the case of 
route corridor option 1 (overhead), there will be a minimal amount of 
construction work within the Power Generation Plant Site and the 
impacts would be considered as part of those construction works. 
4.2.15 
In the case of route corridor option 2 (underground), there will be a 
minimal amount of excavation / trenching within the Hirwaun Industrial 
Estate and adjacent to the Power Generation Plant Site.  
4.2.16 
For both route corridor options there is the potential for generation of 
dust. However, in reality this can be considered as part of the same 
potential impacts as the construction of the Power Generation Plant, 
given their close proximity and that the same receptors will potentially 
be impacted.  
4.2.17 
Additionally, given that both Electrical Connection route corridor options 
will give rise to minimal construction works and they are in close 
proximity to one another, there are not considered to be differences in 
the potential impacts of the different routes. 
Operation  
4.2.18 
During operation of the electrical connection (no matter which option is 
selected), there will be no impacts to air quality.

During decommissioning of the Electrical Connection, there is the 
potential for similar impacts as identified during construction. However, 
the same mitigation measures and best practice working guidelines 
would be put in place to ensure any impacts are minor.  
Conclusions 
4.2.20 
Based on the results of the preliminary environmental assessment, 
taking into account potential mitigation measures, the Project is not 
predicted to have any likely significant effects on air quality.   
Next Steps 
4.2.21 
A full air quality impact assessment will be undertaken to determine the 
likely environmental impacts of operation of the proposed Project, both 
in isolation and in conjunction with other significant emissions sources 
identified through consultation with the relevant authorities.  The impact 
of emissions from traffic during the construction and decommissioning 
phases of the proposed Project will also be assessed in greater detail.  
The results of this assessment work will be presented within the ES. 
4.3 
Noise and Vibration 
Introduction  
4.3.1 
The construction, operation and decommissioning of the Project have 
the potential to impact upon local noise levels and generate vibration, 
which may impact on sensitive receptors. 
4.3.2 
A desk based assessment, a noise survey and preliminary noise 
modelling have been undertaken to make a preliminary assessment of 
the potential noise impacts caused by the construction, operation and 
decommissioning of the Project.  
4.3.3 
Background noise measurements were made at the following six 
residential locations in the vicinity of the Project in order to determine 
the existing baseline noise climate: 
� Rhigos Road;  
� Hoel Y Graig; 
� Halt Lane; 
� Castell Farm;

� Tai Cwplau; and  
� Willow Farm 
4.3.4 
These locations were determined as representative of properties which 
have the potential to be impacted by noise produced from the Project 
and were agreed in consultation with RCTCBC.  
Preliminary Assessment of Potential Impacts 
Power Generation Plant  
Construction 
4.3.5 
Construction activity inevitably leads to some degree of noise 
disturbance at locations in close proximity to construction activities.  
Noise at the Power Generation Plant Site could arise from demolition of 
existing buildings, excavation for foundations and delivery of plant. This 
will however be a temporary source of noise.  Based on a conservative, 
worst case assessment, where numerous large plant items are 
operating simultaneously, the significance of the overall impact of 
construction noise from the Power Generation Plant is predicted to be 
minor at all receptor locations following the implementation of the 
CEMP which will include noise reducing measures. 
Operation  
4.3.6 
During operation, noise disturbance could potentially occur from the 
operation of the Power Generation Plant from, such as from the. 
rotating components of the Power Generation Plant (e.g. the gas 
turbine generator units).  
4.3.7 
In order to predict operational noise, the background noise 
measurements taken at the receptors were modelled alongside noise 
levels predicted for typical power generation plants similar to that 
expected at Hirwaun.  
4.3.8 
This preliminary assessment has shown that there are potential noise 
impacts predicted at nearest sensitive receptors during operation of the 
Power Generation Plant. However, at this stage. this is an initial worst 
case assessment. Several mitigation measures and further refinements 
in plant design will be put in place to ensure that there are no significant 
impacts at any of the receptor locations during operation. These 
mitigation measures include: the fitting of high performance silencers 
and the acoustic cladding of all gas turbine generator units. Following

this mitigation, it is predicted that the noise impact of the Power 
Generation Plant on sensitive receptors will be minor.    
4.3.9 
Additionally, operational noise will be continuously monitored to ensure 
that there are no breaches of allowed noise limits.    
4.3.10 
During operation, vibration effects are anticipated to be imperceptible at 
the nearest receptors.    All plant items will also be designed and 
positioned so that they do not generate vibration impacts.  
Decommissioning  
4.3.11 
During decommissioning, similar impacts to those predicted during 
construction will be experienced (i.e. minor at all receptors) as the 
construction and decommissioning phases will involve similar activities.  
Gas Connection (route corridor options 1 and 2) 
Construction 
4.3.12 
Construction of the Gas Connection (both route corridor options) is 
expected to lead to the generation of some short-term construction 
noise, primarily from the excavation of the trench in which the pipeline 
will sit.  However, at any one location, the construction activities will 
only occur for a short period of time as construction moves along the 
gas pipeline route.  In some locations the impact will be no greater than 
that experienced currently with the movement of agricultural machinery. 
Therefore a preliminary assessment of the significance of noise 
impacts can be considered as minor. 
4.3.13 
Given the similarity of the two Gas Connection route corridor options, 
there are not considered to be differences in the potential impacts of 
the different routes. 
Operation  
4.3.14 
During operation, there will be small amounts of noise generated by the 
gas AGI. This may be a low ‘hum’ noise or ‘hiss’ type of noise as the 
AGI regulates the flow of gas from the Gas National Transmission 
System to the Power Generation Plant.  
4.3.15 
This noise is rarely perceptible except when in very close proximity to 
the AGI. Given that there are no residential properties in close proximity 
to the proposed location for the AGI, an initial assessment is that the 
operational noise from the Gas Connection would be negligible.  
4.3.16 
This applies to either Gas Connection option.

Decommissioning  
4.3.17 
During decommissioning, similar impacts to those predicted during 
construction may be experienced (i.e. minor) as the construction and 
decommissioning phases will involve similar activities.  
Electrical Connection (route corridor options 1 and 2) 
Construction  
4.3.18 
The construction of the Electrical Connection is not anticipated to 
generate significant noise from plant / machinery or traffic due to the 
small scale of the construction / installation works. In the case of route 
corridor option 1, there will be a minimal amount of construction work 
within the Power Generation Plant Site and the impacts would be 
considered as part of those construction works. 
4.3.19 
In the case of route corridor option 2, there will be a minimal amount of 
excavation / trenching within the Hirwaun Industrial Estate and adjacent 
to the Power Generation Plant Site. The cable would be installed 
between 1 and 2 m below ground and in a corridor of no more than 3 m 
wide.  
4.3.20 
For both Electrical Connection route corridor options there is the 
potential for generation of noise during construction, however, in reality 
this can be considered as part of the same potential impacts as the 
construction of the Power Generation Plant, given their close proximity 
and that the same receptors will potentially be impacted.  
Additionally, given that both Electrical Connection route corridor options 
will give rise to minimal construction works and they are in close 
proximity to one another, there are not considered to be differences in 
the potential impacts of the different routes. 
Operation  
4.3.21 
Should an overhead electrical connection be selected (i.e. Electrical 
Connection route corridor option 1) then it is possible that it will produce 
a low ‘hum’ during operation caused by the flow of electricity through 
the line. However, this noise is usually imperceptible except when 
directly under the line. Additionally, the connection at Hirwaun would be 
very short and not in close proximity to residential properties. An initial 
assessment is therefore that the operational noise from the Electrical 
Connection would be negligible.

4.3.22 
Should option 1 be pursued (i.e. an underground cable) then there 
would be no perceptible noise during operation.  
Decommissioning  
4.3.23 
During decommissioning, similar impacts to those predicted during 
construction may be experienced. (i.e. minor).  
Conclusions  
4.3.24 
Based on the preliminary assessment undertaken to date, there are not 
considered to be any likely significant environmental effects on noise 
due to construction of the Power Generation Plant, Gas Connection or 
Electrical Connection. Additionally, no impacts from noise are predicted 
during operation of the Gas Connection or Electrical Connection. A 
worst case assessment has predicted noise impacts at nearest 
sensitive receptors from operation of the Power Generation Plant. 
However, these will be subject to mitigation measures which will mean 
that there are no significant impacts.  
Next Steps 
4.3.25 
Further detailed noise modelling will be undertaken as part of the 
ongoing EIA process, as well as establishing ways to mitigate noise 
impacts during operation.  
4.4 
Ecology 
Introduction  
4.4.1 
The construction, operation and decommissioning of the Project have 
the potential to impact upon sensitive ecological receptors. The Power 
Generation Plant also has the potential to provide ecological value, for 
example, by reinforcing existing habitats or through the introduction of 
screen planting, which could provide additional habitat for some 
species. 
4.4.2 
In order to assess the current ecological conditions at the Project Site 
the following steps have been / are being undertaken: 
� Ecological 
consultations 
with 
statutory 
and 
non 
statutory 
stakeholders is ongoing to understand where the areas of potential 
ecological sensitivity are most likely to be located.  
� Local desk studies and site walkover and habitat classification 
studies known as a “phase 1 habitat surveys” were undertaken to 
assess the habitats and notable species at the Project Site.

� Once the desk studies, the phase 1 surveys were completed, the 
resulting information obtained from them was then used to inform 
species specific surveys termed “Phase 2 protected species 
surveys”. These surveys involved field based assessments to 
determine the presence / absence of notable species and their 
population size if present.  
� All desk studies and Phase 1 studies have been completed for the 
Project, as have the majority of Phase 2 studies.   
4.4.3 
The assessments undertaken so far have identified sensitive ecological 
areas and species in close proximity to the Project Site, including the 
Hirwaun Industrial Estate Site of Importance for Nature Conservation 
(SINC), and populations of bats. As a precautionary measure, surveys 
for reptiles, important breeding birds and Great Crested Newts were 
also undertaken, although no populations were found.  Surveys for 
otters are currently still ongoing.  
Preliminary Assessment of Potential Impacts 
Power Generation Plant  
Construction  
4.4.4 
During construction, potential impacts on ecological receptors could 
occur from habitat loss, increased noise and vibration, increased traffic 
movement, increased dust and habitat disturbance. This could impact 
on bats and the Hirwaun SINC. However, based on a preliminary 
assessment, the significance of these impacts, after appropriate 
mitigation, is considered to be minor.  
4.4.5 
Elements anticipated to require the greatest consideration are potential 
air/water-borne pollutants on the adjacent Hirwaun Industrial Estate 
SINC and the demolition of buildings known to be used by nesting birds 
and roosting bats.  
4.4.6 
Based on the preliminary assessment undertaken to date, it is 
envisaged that there will be some compensatory habitat creation 
required for any bat roosts that are lost as part of the demolition of 
existing buildings prior to construction of the Power Generation Plant.  
4.4.7 
However, no significant impacts on ecological receptors are predicted 
following the implementation of mitigation.  
Operation

4.4.8 
During operation of the Power Generation Plant, the main potential 
impacts to ecology will arise from stack emissions impacting on 
ecologically sensitive sites. Other impacts may include increased light 
spill affecting bats and increased noise and vibration, affecting the 
SINC and bats and birds However, based on a preliminary assessment, 
the significance of these impacts, after appropriate mitigation, is 
considered to be minor.   
Decommissioning   
4.4.9 
During decommissioning, similar impacts to those predicted during 
construction 
may 
be 
experienced 
as 
the 
construction 
and 
decommissioning phases will involve similar activities. 
Gas Connection (route corridor options 1 and 2) 
Construction  
4.4.10 
The majority of the potential impacts associated with the proposed Gas 
Connection will be temporary in nature and related to habitat 
disturbance whilst the trench is being excavated and the pipeline laid.  
Habitats present would be reinstated following installation of the 
pipeline, and would be restored to as closely match pre-existing 
habitats as possible. There are, therefore, not anticipated to be any 
significant impacts resulting from construction of the Gas Connection.  
4.4.11 
Given the similarity of the two gas connection route corridor options, 
there are not considered to be differences in the potential impacts of 
the different routes. 
Operation  
4.4.12 
During operation, there will be no impacts on ecology from the Gas 
Connection (no matter which option is chosen).  
Decommissioning  
4.4.13 
During decommissioning, no impacts are predicted as the pipeline will 
be most likely left in-situ.  
Electrical Connection  
Construction  
4.4.14 
Electrical Connection route corridor option 1 would be an overhead line.

Generation Plant, the impacts of the connection could be considered as 
part of the construction of the Power Generation Plant.   
4.4.15 
Electrical Connection route corridor option 2 would be a buried 
underground cable which would be sited entirely on in hardstanding on 
the Hirwaun Industrial Estate. Although there would be increases in 
disturbance to the area during construction, due to the nature of the 
location of the electrical connection, the small construction footprint and 
remoteness from any sensitive ecological sites, it is not anticipated to 
have any impacts on ecological receptors.  
Operation  
4.4.16 
During operation, there will be no impacts on ecology from the 
Electrical Connection (no matter which option is chosen).  
Decommissioning  
4.4.17 
During decommissioning, similar impacts to those predicted during 
construction may be experienced. 
Conclusions 
4.4.18 
There are potential impacts to ecological habitats during construction, 
operation and decommissioning of the Power Generation Plant. 
However, following the implementation of mitigation measures, these 
are not anticipated to be significant. The specific mitigation measures 
will be determined once all of the phase 2 protected species surveys 
have been completed .   
Next Steps 
4.4.19 
As the ecological impact assessment progresses, specific ecological 
consultation will include further detailed correspondence with NRW and 
RCTCBC. 
4.4.20 
The Phase 2 species surveys which are still ongoing will be completed 
and the results of the other surveys which have recently been 
completed will be finalised .

Water Resources 
Introduction 
4.5.1 
The construction, operation and decommissioning of the Project have 
the potential to impact upon local water quality and water resources. 
Although the Power Generation Plant would utilise air cooling,

substantially reducing the need for water during operation, small 
quantities of water would still be required. Consequently, any water use 
at the Project Site has the potential to impact upon the water resources 
in the area. 
4.5.2 
A Desk based assessment has been carried out with regards to water 
resources.  This has identified all surface water resources within the 
study area, as well as any areas of vulnerability and previous pollution 
incidents which may have impacted on water bodies. 
4.5.3 
The main water bodies within the vicinity of the Project Site are 
considered to be: 
� 
Penderyn Reservoir which is around 800m north of the Power 
Generation Plant Site; 
� 
River Camnant which is culverted underneath the Power 
Generation Plant Site; 
� 
Fishing pond approximately 200 m south of the Power Generation 
Site;  
� 
Numerous drainage ditches and several small ponds on agricultural 
land to the south of Rhigos Road; and 
� 
Hirwaun Ponds approximately 1 km east of the Power Generation 
Plant Site.  
Preliminary Assessment of Potential Impacts 
Power Generation Plant  
Construction  
4.5.4 
Based on the preliminary environmental assessment data, the main 
potential impact that may result from construction of the Power 
Generation Plant is contaminated material entering a surface water 
body.  However, there are not anticipated to be any impacts on the 
water bodies listed above as the majority are a significant distance from 
the Power Generation Plant Site.  Best practice would also be 
employed during construction to protect the water environment, in 
accordance with guidelines published by NRW.  
4.5.5 
It is predicted that following mitigation, any impacts on water quality 
and resources will be negligible.   
Operation

4.5.6 
During operation, the Power Generation Plant Site would be equipped 
with a surface water drainage system and a sewerage system.  The 
surface water drainage system would remove any potentially polluted 
runoff, prior to reaching the main sewerage network.  It is currently 
anticipated that the on-site sewerage system would connect to the 
existing mains drainage system, currently present at the Power 
Generation Site and used by International Greetings UK Ltd.  
4.5.7 
Due to the intermittent water demand of the Power Generation Plant, all 
water would be tankered to the Power Generation Plant and stored in 
water storage tanks adjacent to the administration buildings.  No 
surface water or groundwater abstraction would be required.  
4.5.8 
It is predicted that any impacts on water quality and resources will be 
negligible.   
Decommissioning   
4.5.9 
During decommissioning, similar impacts to those predicted during 
construction may be experienced. 
Gas Connection (route corridor options 1 and 2)  
Construction  
4.5.10 
Gas Connection route corridor option 1 requires the crossing of three 
minor field drains and route corridor option 2 requires the crossing of 
one field drain. The exact construction methods used to cross these 
drains has not yet been determined and it is likely that this will need to 
be done in consultation with the landowner. It could be that these field 
drains are re-routed or it could be that the pipeline is laid under these 
drains.  However, no matter what construction method is used, due 
care and attention will be paid so that no potential pollutant pathways 
are opened up which could impact on the field drains. As for 
construction of the Power Generation Plant, best practice will be 
followed including the implementation of a CEMP.  It is predicted that 
following this mitigation, any impacts on water quality and resources 
will be negligible.   
4.5.11 
Given the similarity of the two gas connection route corridor options, 
there are not considered to be differences in the potential impacts of 
the different routes.

4.5.12 
During operation, there will be no impacts on water quality or resources 
from the Gas Connection (no matter which option is chosen).  
Decommissioning  
4.5.13 
During decommissioning, no impacts on water quality and resources 
are anticipated as the Gas Connection will be left in situ.  
Electrical Connection (route corridor options 1 and 2) 
Construction  
4.5.14 
Electrical Connection route corridor option 1 does not cross any water 
bodies. It does cross over a waterlogged and marshy area to the north 
and west of the Power Generation Plant. However, route corridor option 
1 will be an overhead line and therefore no direct impacts to this area 
are anticipated.  
4.5.15 
Electrical Connection route corridor option 2 runs through the Hirwaun 
Industrial Estate and not in close proximity to any watercourses. 
Therefore no impacts to water quality are anticipated.  
Operation  
4.5.16 
During operation, there will be no impacts on water quality or resources 
from the Electrical Connection (no matter which option is chosen).  
Decommissioning  
4.5.17 
During decommissioning, as for construction, no impacts on water 
quality and resources are anticipated.  
Conclusions  
4.5.18 
The Power Generation Plant requires a small amount of water during 
construction 
and 
operation. 
However, 
no 
likely 
significant 
environmental effects on water quality or resources are anticipated.    
4.5.19 
Due to the nature of the Gas Connection and Electrical Connection, no 
likely significant environmental effects  on water quality and resources 
are anticipated.

Geology, Ground Conditions and Hydrogeology  
Introduction 
4.6.1 
The construction, operation and decommissioning of the proposed 
Project has the potential to impact upon geology, ground conditions 
and hydrogeology by, for example, the removal of good quality 
agricultural land.  The proposed Project also has the potential to result 
in impacts from contamination (existing or created) on human health 
and sensitive ecological receptors. 
4.6.2 
An initial desk based assessment has been carried out to assess the 
baseline geology and ground conditions underlying the Project Site.  
The assessment studied information regarding previous land uses of 
the Project Site and the surrounding area, the soils and geology 
present at the Project Site, any potential contamination issues resulting 
from former site uses and any potential mining and ground stability 
hazards. 
4.6.3 
Several former landfill sites are present in the vicinity of the Project 
Site, as are areas of deep peat deposits and areas previously affected 
by coal mining, which all have the potential to impact on the 
development of the Project. 
4.6.4 
The Power Generation Plant, Gas Connection route corridors and 
Electrical Connection route corridors are all underlain by the ‘South 
Wales Lower Coal Measures’ formation.  
4.6.5 
The superficial deposits covering a small area in the centre of the 
Power Generation Plant Site and the majority of the Gas Connection 
route corridor options is Devensian Till – a diamicton which includes a 
mixture of clay, sands and gravels.   
4.6.6 
The majority of the Power Generation Plant Site and Electrical 
Connection route corridor options are covered by Peat deposits 
(waterlogged organic material).

4.6.7 
A Conceptual Site Model (CSM) approach has been used to assess the 
risk posed by contaminants on human health and other sensitive 
receptors.  This examines the potential sources of contamination (e.g. 
historical sources), the potential receptors that could be affected (e.g. 
soil and construction workers) and the pathways to these receptors 
(e.g. 
leaching 
in 
surface 
water 
and 
inhalation 
of 
airborne 
contaminants). 
Preliminary Assessment of Potential Impacts 
Power Generation Plant  
Construction  
4.6.8 
During construction of the Power Generation Plant, the main potential 
impacts on geology and land contamination will be from; 
� Disturbance of existing contamination and creation of pollution 
pathways; and  
� Creation of pollution incidents from e.g. spillages.  
4.6.9 
Despite this, stringent mitigation measures such as working within best 
practice guidelines and adhering to a detailed CEMP will be employed 
to prevent any contamination or pollution incidents impacting on the 
local geology or soils, thus the impact will be negligible.  Furthermore 
given the previous industrial land use of the Power Generation Plant 
Site there are no important geology or soils underlying the site.  
Operation  
4.6.10 
During operation of the Power Generation Plant, no further impacts on 
geology and soils are anticipated as there will be no further ground 
disturbance. Accordingly, any impacts will be negligible.  
4.6.11 
Any potential impacts resulting from e.g. ground instability will be 
mitigated by the undertaking of a detailed geotechnical site 
investigation prior to construction. 
Decommissioning   
4.6.12 
During decommissioning, similar impacts to those predicted during 
construction may be experienced.

4.6.13 
The construction of Gas Connection route corridor option 1 will result in 
the temporary sterilisation of agricultural land.  However, this will be a 
relatively narrow corridor (maximum of 30m working width) and any 
impacts would be temporary. There is therefore considered to be a 
minor impact. Given that land underlying gas connection route corridor 
option 1 has not been subject to industrial development, the potential 
for encountering contaminated materials is considered to be low.    
4.6.14 
The construction of Gas Connection route corridor option 2 would be 
alongside roads for its majority and would therefore not result in the 
sterilisation of a large quantity of agricultural land. Therefore any 
impacts would be negligible. 
Operation  
4.6.15 
During operation, there will be no impacts on geology, ground 
conditions or hydrogeology from the Gas Connection (no matter which 
option is chosen).  
Decommissioning  
4.6.16 
During decommissioning, no impacts are anticipated as the Gas 
Connection will be left in situ. 
Electrical Connection (options 1 and 2) 
Construction  
4.6.17 
The construction of Electrical Connection route corridor option 1 is not 
considered to have any impact on geology, soils or hydrogeology. The 
connection will be an overhead line.  Although some above ground 
infrastructure would be required, this would be sited within the Power 
Generation Plant Site and no construction would take place outside of 
this, other than at the Rhigos substation. Any impacts will therefore be 
negligible.  
4.6.18 
Electrical Connection route corridor option 2 would involve the 
excavation of a narrow trench (of the order of 3m wide) alongside roads 
and in hard standing on the Hirwaun Industrial Estate. This excavation 
will therefore have a negligible impact on geology and soils.   
Operation  
4.6.19 
During operation, there will be no impacts on geology, ground 
conditions or hydrogeology from the electrical (no matter which option 
is chosen).

Decommissioning  
4.6.20 
Decommissioning impacts are considered to be the same as those set 
out for construction.  
Conclusions 
4.6.21 
Based on the preliminary assessment undertaken to date taking into 
account potential mitigation measures, the proposed Project is not 
predicted to have any likely significant effects on geology, ground 
conditions and agriculture.  As part of the full EIA process a more 
detailed assessment will be carried out.  The results of this assessment 
work will be presented within the ES. 
Next Steps 
4.6.22 
The following next steps will be undertaken in order to complete the 
assessment of potential impacts on ground conditions from the Project:  
� Further, more in depth assessment of potential contamination at the 
Power Generation Plant Site from previous land uses; 
� Further consultation with NRW and RCTCBC to determine the 
nature, scope and timing of any intrusive ground investigation works 
considered necessary; and  
� Further risk assessment of ground instability issues.

Landscape and Visual Impacts  
Introduction  
4.7.1 
A desk based assessment and preliminary site visit have been 
undertaken to determine the baseline landscape character in which the 
Project would sit and the sensitive receptors which may be impacted by 
the visual appearance of the Project.  This study identified landscape 
designations, nature conservation designations, public rights of way, 
settlements, infrastructure and the historic landscape in the vicinity of 
the Project. 
4.7.2 
Preliminary Assessment of Potential Impacts 
Power Generation Plant  
Construction  
4.7.3 
The main potential sources of landscape and visual impact during 
construction of the Project are: earthworks, site clearance works, the

removal of vegetation, construction traffic and construction site lighting.  
However, given the already industrial nature of much of the Project 
Site, as well as the limited construction period, these impacts are 
considered to be minor.  
Operation  
4.7.4 
During operation, impacts on landscape and visual amenity will result 
from the introduction of permanent structures, particularly the stacks of 
the Power Generation Plant which will be the largest structure on site.  
4.7.5 
No direct impacts are likely to be felt during operation as a result of 
landscape losses, because the Project would not intensify the existing 
industrial landscape as it will directly replace an existing industrial 
building.  Furthermore, impacts on visual amenity to the immediate 
surrounding area are likely to be negligible for the same reason, and 
also because of the low lying nature of the Hirwaun Industrial Estate 
and the level of tree screening it is afforded. 
Decommissioning   
4.7.6 
During decommissioning, similar impacts to those predicted during 
construction may be experienced. 
Gas Connection (route corridor options 1 and 2) 
Construction  
4.7.7 
During construction, similar potential impacts to those identified for the 
Power Generation Plant may be experienced (e.g. through land 
clearance and presence of construction plant), although construction of 
the Gas Connection would be a smaller undertaking than for the Power 
Generation Plant. Hence impacts would be minor or negligible.  
Operation  
4.7.8 
During operation, there will be no impacts on landscape or visual 
impacts from the majority of the Gas Connection (no matter which 
option is chosen) as it would be a buried pipeline.  
4.7.9 
There may be minor impacts from the AGI, although this would be a 
small structure and it would be screened with vegetation to prevent any 
significant landscape and visual impacts. Additionally, there are no 
residential receptors in close proximity to the AGI.

Electrical Connection (route corridor options 1 and 2) 
Construction 
4.7.11 
During construction, similar potential impacts to those identified for the 
Gas Connection are predicted (e.g. presence of large construction plant 
items.  
Operation  
4.7.12 
During operation, there may be some minor impacts resulting from 
Electrical Connection  route corridor option 1 as it will be an overhead 
line, supported by up to three towers of approximately 35m in height. 
However, these impacts could be considered as part of the overall 
infrastructure of the Power Generation Plant. It is predicted, therefore, 
that the landscape and visual impact of the Electrical Connection option 
1  is minor. . 
4.7.13 
 There will be no impacts on landscape or visual amenity from Electrical 
Connection option 2 as it will be a buried cable.  
Decommissioning  
4.7.14 
During decommissioning, similar impacts to those predicted during 
construction may be experienced. 
Conclusions 
4.7.15 
Given the current industrial nature of the Power Generation Plant Site, 
no likely significant environmental effects are anticipated on landscape 
and visual amenity. However, further studies are required to establish 
the exact nature of any impacts.   
Next Steps 
4.7.16 
A full Landscape and Visual Impacts Assessment is currently being 
undertaken, the results of which will be presented within the ES.  The 
methodology for the full LVIA is based on current best practice and 
guidance.  It will include a visual survey during the winter to assess 
potential views of the development when screening from vegetation is 
at its least effective.  The visual assessment will consider viewpoints 
from locations throughout the Study Area that are representative of 
potential views from residential properties, public rights of way, 
recreational resources and heritage assets.  Separate computer

Waste Management and Health 
Introduction  
4.8.1 
The construction, operation and decommissioning of the Project have  
the potential to generate a variety of waste material that would need to 
be handled and disposed of with care in order to avoid impacts upon 
public health.   
4.8.2 
The Project could also create impacts relating directly to human health 
(e.g. through changes to air quality or water quality).  
Preliminary Assessment of Potential Impacts 
Power Generation Plant  
Construction  
4.8.3 
It is anticipated that the majority of waste would be generated during 
the construction and decommissioning phases of the Power Generation 
Plant, when significant quantities of wastes such as concrete, inert 
builders rubble, spoil and scrap metal would be produced, particularly 
during demolition of the existing industrial buildings at the Power 
Generation Plant Site. 
4.8.4 
Additionally, there is the potential to generate noise, air quality and 
pollution impacts which could negatively impact on human health. 
However, it is predicted that none of these impacts are likely to be 
significant.  
Operation 
4.8.5 
During operation, the production of waste is likely to be significantly 
less than for construction, although minimal quantities of both non-
hazardous and hazardous waste would be likely to be produced, 
including used air filters, scrap metal, used insulation material, general 
office waste, and other miscellaneous wastes, as well as small 
quantities of waste water. These impacts will not be significant.  
The main potential impact on human health during operation of the 
plant is from the generation of stack emissions which may impact air 
quality. However, it is predicted that any impact is not likely to be 
significant.

4.8.6 
During decommissioning, similar impacts to those predicted during 
construction may be experienced. 
Gas Connection (route corridor options 1 and 2) 
Construction  
4.8.7 
During construction of the Gas Connection, small quantities of spoil and 
construction waste will require disposal, although on a smaller scale 
than for the Power Generation Plant. No significant impacts are 
anticipated.  
4.8.8 
There may also be minor impacts from dust generation.  
4.8.9 
Given the similarity of the two Gas Connection route corridor options, 
there are not considered to be differences in the potential impacts of 
the different routes. 
Operation  
4.8.10 
During operation, there will be no impacts from waste generation or on 
human health from the gas connection (no matter which option is 
chosen).  
Decommissioning  
4.8.11 
During decommissioning, no impacts are anticipated as the Gas 
Connection will be left in situ. 
Electrical Connection (route corridor options 1 and 2) 
Construction  
4.8.12 
During construction of the Electrical Connection, small quantities of 
spoil and construction waste will require disposal. In the case of route 
corridor option 1 this will be from excavation works required to site 
pylons and for route corridor option 2 this will be from excavation works 
when laying the cable. However, this will be  on a smaller scale than for 
the Power Generation Plant. Therefore no significant impacts are 
anticipated.  
4.8.13 
There may also be minor impacts from dust generation.

Decommissioning  
4.8.15 
During decommissioning, similar impacts to those predicted during 
construction may be experienced. 
Conclusions 
4.8.16 
All types of waste generated can have a detrimental impact on the 
environment if not appropriately managed and controlled. HPL would, 
therefore, ensure that all waste would be dealt with in a manner that 
complies with the relevant regulations and (upon leaving the site) waste 
would be treated and disposed of by suitably licensed contractors.  As 
such, taking into account potential mitigation measures, the preliminary 
environmental assessment has identified that the proposed Project is 
not predicted to have any likely significant effects on waste 
management. 
4.8.17 
At present, it is anticipated that the main potential impacts to public 
health arising from the proposed Project would result from changes to 
local air quality, although potential impacts may also arise from 
contaminated land, site run-off and noise impacts.  A CSM approach 
has been used to assess the risks posed by contaminants to public 
health.  This examines the cause of the impact (e.g. stack emissions 
may result in a change in air quality), the potential human receptors 
that could be affected and the pathways to these receptors.  Based on 
the results of the preliminary environmental assessment, taking into 
account potential mitigation measures, the proposed Project is not 
predicted to have any likely significant effects on public health. 
Next Steps 
4.8.18 
As part of the ongoing assessments, further work will be undertaken to 
fully characterise any impacts on human health from noise and air 
quality from all aspects of the Project.  When more detail is known 
about the construction programme, further details will be provided on 
the likely quantities and composition of waste.

4.9.1 
The construction, operation and decommissioning of the Project have 
the potential to impact upon the local transport network, through the 
generation of additional traffic movements to the area. 
4.9.2 
An initial desk based assessment has been carried out as part of the 
PEIR.  This identified and assessed the following: 
� Pedestrian and cycle facilities including the National Cycle Network 
Route 46; 
� Public transport services including bus and rail services; 
� Private transport services including parking provision; 
� Highways networks and junctions; and 
� Road safety and collision statistics. 
4.9.3 
Access to the Power Generation Plant Site and Electrical Connection is 
currently anticipated to be from the A4061, Rhigos Road and Main 
Avenue via an existing gated access, which is currently used for the 
International Greetings UK Ltd. site. Access to the Gas Connection is 
anticipated to be from the A4061, from which a small new access track 
will be created.  
Preliminary Assessment of Potential Impacts 
Power Generation Plant  
Construction  
4.9.4 
During construction, the Power Generation Plant is anticipated to 
require up to 250 workers at its peak construction phase. Assuming 
that two workers share a vehicle on average, this will result in 
approximately 125 journeys to the Power Generation Plant Site to start 
work and 125 journeys away from work.  
4.9.5 
The construction of the Power Generation Plant will also require the 
delivery of large plant items such as the gas turbine generators and 
stacks.  There is therefore the potential to impact on the surrounding 
road network through for example, temporary road closures and 
requirement for escort vehicles. However, given the temporary nature 
of the construction phase, the impacts on traffic and transport are 
predicted to be minor.

4.9.6 
During operation of the Power Generation Plant, up to a maximum of 
15 construction staff are anticipated to be employed full time. 
Additionally, there will be infrequent maintenance visits by 1 or 2 
engineers.  This will generate very similar traffic movements as are 
currently experienced in the local area due to the existing staff levels at 
the International Greetings UK Ltd. site.  
4.9.7 
Therefore, operation of the Power Generation Plant is not anticipated to 
have any negative impacts on the local road network.   
Decommissioning   
4.9.8 
During decommissioning, similar impacts to those predicted during 
construction will be experienced, assuming that all plant items are 
removed. 
Gas Connection (route corridor options 1 and 2) 
Construction  
4.9.9 
During Construction, there would be an increase in the number of 
vehicle movements associated with the main construction works (e.g. 
excavation of the trenches for laying the pipeline in) as well as loads 
associated with the delivery of large sections of pipe.  This may also 
have an impact on the local road networks although due to the 
relatively small nature of the construction works, these impacts are 
likely to be minor.  
Operation  
4.9.10 
Operation of the Gas Connection would not create any impacts as the 
only traffic movements would be associated with maintenance visits by 
one or two engineers very infrequently.   
Decommissioning  
4.9.11 
During decommissioning, no impacts are anticipated as the Gas 
Connection will be left in situ.. 
Electrical Connection (options 1 and 2) 
Construction  
4.9.12 
During Construction, there would be an increase in the number of 
vehicle movements associated with main construction works (e.g. 
excavation of the trenches for laying the electrical cable or erection of 
pylons to support the overhead line).  This may also have an impact on

the local road networks although due to the relatively small nature of 
the construction works for the electrical connection, this is likely to be 
minor.  
Operation  
4.9.13 
Operation of the electrical  connection would not create any impacts as 
the only traffic movements would be associated with maintenance visits 
by one or two engineers very infrequently.  
Decommissioning  
4.9.14 
During decommissioning, similar impacts to those predicted during 
construction may be experienced. 
Conclusions 
4.9.15 
The construction phase of the Project has the potential to generate 
traffic impacts through the increase in construction staff, plant and 
equipment.  Impacts could include the temporary closure of highways 
whilst large plant is delivered to the Power Generation Plant Site and 
increased congestion on the road network in the vicinity of the Power 
Generation Plant Site.  However, this impact would be temporary and, 
through the use of mitigation measures would not be significant.  
4.9.16 
The operational phase of the Project is not anticipated to generate any 
traffic impacts as levels of permanent staff would be similar to those 
currently experienced at the Power Generation Plant Site. 
Next Steps 
4.9.17 
Further assessment and more detail of construction traffic, including a 
breakdown of construction vehicles will be provided.

Cultural Heritage and Archaeology 
Introduction  
4.10.1 
The construction, operation and decommissioning of the Project has 
the potential to impact upon both above ground and buried 
archaeological assets, as well as having an impact upon the setting 
and appreciation of assets of Cultural Heritage importance, including 
surrounding Listed Buildings, Scheduled Monuments and Conservation 
Areas. 
4.10.2 
An archaeological desk based assessment and preliminary site visit 
were carried out as part of the archaeological assessment.

4.10.3 
The assessment identified 16 heritage assets: 3 within the Project Site 
(HA06, HA08, HA09) and one within the proposed Power Generation 
Plant Site (HA06).  These assets are as follows: 
� HA06 – Site of former Royal Ordnance Factory; 
� HA08 – Tappenden’s Tramroad West; and 
� HA09 – Hirwaun Toll House. 
4.10.4 
Preliminary Assessment of Potential Impacts 
Power Generation Plant  
Construction  
4.10.5 
As Hirwaun Industrial Estate was originally a WWII Royal Ordnance 
munitions factory, it is likely that any buried remains were disturbed 
during its construction. Therefore, there are not anticipated to be any 
impacts on buried archaeology from the construction of the Power 
Generation Plant.  
Operation  
4.10.6 
During operation, the introduction of the Power Generation Plant 
including the associated stack(s) has the potential to have minor 
impacts on surrounding cultural heritage assets such as listed 
buildings, although none of these impacts are considered likely to be 
significant.    
Decommissioning   
4.10.7 
During decommissioning, as for construction, no impacts are predicted.  
Gas Connection  
Construction (route corridor options 1 and 2) 
4.10.8 
Land under which Gas Connection route corridor option 1has remained 
as undeveloped agricultural land as far as the earliest maps go back. 
The land was formerly part of Hirwaun Common. There is potential, 
therefore, for the survival of buried archaeology in these areas, 
particularly relating to mineral extraction, as this has not been 
disturbed. Any groundworks associated with development have the 
potential to impact directly on these assets.

4.10.9 
The majority of Gas Connection route corridor option 2 runs alongside 
roads, which may have previously impacted on any buried archaeology 
present. However, the roads are a relatively recent addition to the 
landscape (approximately 1940s to 1950s). Prior to these roads the 
land was agricultural and also part of the Hirwaun Common. There is 
potential, therefore, for the survival of buried archaeology in these 
areas, particularly relating to mineral extraction, as this has not been 
disturbed. Any groundworks associated with development have the 
potential to impact directly on these assets. 
Operation  
4.10.10 
During operation, there will be no impacts on archaeology from the Gas 
Connection (no matter which option is chosen).  
Decommissioning  
4.10.11 
During decommissioning, no impacts are predicted as the Gas 
Connection will be left in situ.  
Electrical Connection (route corridor options 1 and 2) 
Construction  
4.10.12 
Land under which Electrical Connection route corridor option 1 is 
situated has not previously been the subject of any development. 
However, as this connection option will be an overhead line, and the 
only ground disturbance will be within the Power Generation Plant Site / 
Rhigos Substation there is not considered to be any potential to impact 
on buried archaeology. As with the Power Generation Plant, Electrical 
Connection route corridor option 2 is situated within the Hirwaun 
Industrial Estate and will be buried beneath hardstanding and areas 
which would have previously been impacted by development. 
Therefore, there is not considered to be any impact on buried 
archaeology.  
Operation  
4.10.13 
During operation, there may be minor impacts on above ground 
heritage assets such as listed buildings from Electrical Connection 
option 1 as it will be an overhead line. However, these impacts will be 
seen as part of the Power Generation Plant given their close proximity 
and similar landscape setting.  
4.10.14 
There will be no operational impacts on archaeology from the electrical 
Connection option 2 as it will be a buried underground cable.

Decommissioning  
4.10.15 
During decommissioning, as for construction, no impacts are predicted.  
Conclusions 
4.10.16 
The development of the Project is not anticipated to have any impacts 
on buried archaeology given the previous Power Generation Plant Site 
uses.  The operational phase of the Project is also unlikely to have any 
impacts on above ground archaeology, given the already industrial 
nature of the Project Site and the lack of intervisibility between the 
Power Generation Plant Site and important heritage assets.  
Next Steps 
4.10.17 
A photographic and interpretative survey of any buildings relating to the 
Royal Ordnance Factory will be undertaken to a sufficient level to allow 
a descriptive record and interpretation to be compiled. The Heritage 
Assets that lie within the Project Site may also be affected by the 
proposed development and it is recommended that a low-level of 
building investigation should be carried out on them.   
4.10.18 
The most appropriate mitigation strategy will be discussed with the 
GGAT Planning Archaeologist as part of further ongoing consultations.

Socio-economics 
Introduction 
4.11.2 
The construction, operation and decommissioning phases of the 
Project have the potential to impact on the area’s labour markets, 
community facilities and tourism sector. 
4.11.3 
The baseline socio-economic status of the local area surrounding the 
Project is characterised by a pattern of population increase which is 
expected to continue until 2021. The area has a declining work age 
population with more than one fifth of the population expected to be at 
retirement age by 2021.  This is also coupled with low economic activity 
which is lower than the UK average. Health and social work is the main 
employment category in the local area, and is above the national 
average.   
4.11.4 
One of the top ten paid and unpaid visitor’s attractions in Wales is 
located within 15 km of the Project: Cyfarthfa Castle.  Further 
attractions within 15 km include: Dare Valley County Park, Penderyn 
Distillery, Garwnant Visitors Centre, Cynon Valley Museum and Gallery 
and Brecon Mountain Railway. Services within 5 km of the Project

include but are not limited to: 1 hospital, 3 GP surgeries, 1 community 
sports hall, 2 parks, 1 library, 6 local bus routes, 7 primary schools and 
2 special schools. 
Preliminary Assessment of Potential Impacts 
Power Generation Plant 
Construction 
4.11.5 
The Project will have minor positive impacts on the socio-economic 
status of the area through both employment creation and capital 
expenditure and worker spending in the local economy. It is anticipated 
that up to 250 construction workers would be required at the Project 
Site during peak periods. These workers would not only benefit the 
economy directly, but would also have knock on effects on other 
businesses (e.g. guest houses and bakeries).  
4.11.6 
Impacts on tourism and community infrastructure are predicted as a 
result of visual, noise, traffic and accessibility and air quality impacts.  
Visual impacts will likely decrease with distance from the Project Site 
and thus are predicted to be minor.  Noise / Air Quality impacts will be 
minor.  The effects of noise emissions from construction equipment and 
air emissions such as dust will be restricted to the immediate area.  
There are no significant clusters of tourism attractions or community 
infrastructure in the area.   
4.11.7 
Traffic / accessibility impacts resulting from an increase in construction 
traffic will be temporary during the construction phase and will be 
effectively managed by a Traffic Management Plan thus impacts are 
predicted to be minor.  
Operation 
4.11.8 
Impacts on tourism and community infrastructure are predicted as a 
result of visual, noise, traffic and accessibility and air quality impacts.  
Visual impacts will likely decrease with distance from the Power 
Generation Plant Site and thus are predicted to be minor.  Noise / Air 
Quality impacts will be minor. Noise emissions and air emissions from 
operation will only impact the immediate area and there are no 
significant clusters of tourism attractions or community infrastructure in 
the area.   
4.11.9 
Traffic / accessibility impacts as a result of operational traffic are 
predicted to be minor as operational traffic will be lower than

construction and it will be effectively managed by a Traffic Management 
Plan.  
Decommissioning 
4.11.10 
During decommissioning, similar impacts to those predicted during 
construction may be experienced. 
Gas Connection (route corridor options 1 and 2) 
Construction 
4.11.11 
During construction there are likely to be minor positive socioeconomic 
impacts due to employment creation and capital expenditure and 
worker spending in the local economy. 
4.11.12 
Minor negative impacts will be felt on tourism and community 
infrastructure in the local area as a result of visual, noise, traffic and 
accessibility and air quality impacts. 
Operation 
4.11.13 
The operation of the Gas Connection will be buried underground.  It will 
not generate any perceptible noise or air emissions and will generate 
very infrequent vehicle trips.  Therefore the Gas Connection will have 
no further impacts on the socio-economics of the local area, tourism or 
community infrastructure.  
Decommissioning 
4.11.14 
During decommissioning, no impacts are anticipated as the Gas 
Connection will be left in situ. 
Electrical Connection (route corridor options 1 and 2) 
Construction 
4.11.15 
During construction there are likely to be minor positive socio-economic 
impacts due to employment creation and capital expenditure and 
worker spending in the local economy. 
4.11.16 
Minor negative impacts will be felt on tourism and community 
infrastructure in the local area as a result of visual, noise, traffic and 
accessibility and air quality impacts.

Operation 
4.11.17 
Although Electrical Connection route corridor option 1 is an overhead 
line, it will have negligible noise and emissions impacts and only minor 
traffic impacts. It will be a noticeable, above ground structure, although 
it will be viewed in the context of the Power Generation Plant, Rhigos 
substation and the existing industrial nature of the Power Generation 
Plant Site, therefore, landscape and visual impacts are not considered 
to be significant. It is therefore not anticipated that Electrical 
Connection option 1 will have further impacts on the socioeconomics of 
the local area, tourism or community infrastructure. 
4.11.18 
 Electrical Connection route corridor option 2 will be a buried 
underground cable.   It will not generate noise or air emissions and will 
generate very infrequent vehicle trips.  Therefore the Electrical 
Connection will have no further impacts on the socio-economics of the 
local area, tourism or community infrastructure.  
Decommissioning 
4.11.19 
During decommissioning, similar impacts to those predicted during 
construction may be experienced. 
Conclusions 
4.11.20 
The Project is likely to generate minor positive socio-economic benefits 
during construction, operation and decommissioning due to the 
potential to use local workforce and resources.  
Next Steps 
4.11.21 
The following steps will be undertaken in the next phase of socio-
economic analysis: 
� A mapping of the ZTV analysis against tourism and recreational 
receptors in the area to gain a better understanding of the potential 
visual impact of the assessment; 
� Detailed estimates of the economic impact of the construction and 
operation of the proposed Project and the construction of the gas 
and electricity components. 
� An impact assessment of the community facilities  
4.12 
Cumulative Impacts 
4.12.1 
Cumulative impacts can be either:

� Type 1 Cumulative Impacts: These are combined effects of 
different types of impact on a single receptor. For example: dust, 
noise and visual impacts resulting from construction and operation 
of the proposed Project and other reasonably foreseeable future 
developments; or 
� Type 2 Cumulative Impacts: These are the same type of impact 
from the Project and current or reasonably foreseeable future 
developments which may individually be insignificant, but could be 
cumulatively significant. For example: cumulative traffic impacts 
during construction. 
4.12.2 
As part of the preliminary cumulative impact assessment, three 
reasonably foreseeable future developments have been considered as 
part of the cumulative impacts, these are: 
� Enviroparks Hirwaun Energy from Waste plant (located to the north 
of the Power Generation Plant Site);  
� Hirwaun Energy Centre; and .  
� Rhigos Substation.  
4.12.3 
Based on the assessment work done to date, it is predicted that there 
will be no significant cumulative impacts arising from these 
developments.
