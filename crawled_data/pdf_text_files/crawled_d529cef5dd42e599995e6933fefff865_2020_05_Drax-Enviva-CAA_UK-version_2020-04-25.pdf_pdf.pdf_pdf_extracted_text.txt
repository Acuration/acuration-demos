Drax – April 2020 
Executive Summary 
The fiber catchment area in North Carolina and Virginia that supports Enviva Pellets Ahoskie, Enviva 
Pellets Northampton, and Enviva Pellets Southampton was examined in accordance with Drax’s initiative 
to monitor forest management and timber market trends across its supply chain. Details regarding these 
three mills include: 
 Enviva Pellets Ahoskie is located in Ahoskie, North Carolina, and commenced pellet production in 
November of 2011. The Ahoskie pellet mill was built on the site of a former Georgia-Pacific sawmill with 
new infrastructure purpose-built for wood pellet production. Enviva Pellets Ahoskie has a production 
capacity of approximately 370,000 metric tons of pellets per year. 
 Enviva Pellets Northampton is located in Northampton County, North Carolina, near the towns of Gaston, 
Roanoke Rapids and Garysburg, and commenced pellet production in April of 2013. The facility has a 
production capacity of 510,000 metric tons of pellets per year. 
 Enviva Pellets Southampton is located in Southampton County, Virginia, just outside the towns of Courtland 
and Franklin, and commenced pellet production in October of 2013. The facility was developed by its 
sponsor, Enviva Holdings LP, under a joint venture with affiliates of John Hancock Life Insurance Company 
and later acquired by Enviva Partners in 2015. Enviva Pellets Southampton has a production capacity of 
510,000 metric tons of pellets per year. 
The following catchment area analysis examines and identifies trends with timber inventory, growth, 
removals, wood demand, raw material prices, and harvest activities and practices in the Enviva 
Chesapeake catchment area since 2000. It also includes an assessment of long-term market sustainability 
and provides a market outlook through 2022. 
Key report findings are highlighted and summarized on the following pages.

Drax – April 2020 
Is there any evidence that 
bioenergy demand has 
caused the following:  
Analysis Findings 
Deforestation? 
No. US Forest Service (USFS) data shows the opposite. The total area of timberland in 
the Enviva Chesapeake catchment area has increased an estimated 82,818 
hectares (+1.8%) since Enviva Pellets Ahoskie commenced full production in 2012.  
A change in management 
practices (rotation lengths, 
thinnings, conversion from 
hardwood to pine)? 
No / Inconclusive. Changes in management practices have occurred in the catchment 
area since 2012, but there is little evidence to suggest that bioenergy demand has 
caused these changes.  
Conversion of hardwood and mixed pine-hardwood timberland to planted pine 
timberland has occurred in the catchment area. Specifically, hardwood and mixed 
pine-hardwood timberland decreased an estimated 32,662 hectares (-1.3%) from 
2012-2018, compared to an increase of 33,083 hectares (+2.6%) in planted pine 
timberland. However, it is inconclusive as to whether bioenergy demand caused 
this change. Conversion from naturally regenerated timber to planted pine is 
typical in this market. As less productive naturally regenerated timber stands are 
harvested, these stands are replaced with more productive planted pine (improved 
genetics that offer better growth, improved form, reduced susceptibility to 
disease, and improved financial returns). 
Also, worth noting is that naturally regenerated pine timberland increased an 
estimated 82,397 hectares (+10.7%) over this same period. However, data 
provided by the US Department of Agriculture (USDA) suggests that this significant 
increase in naturally regenerated pine timberland is largely attributed to land 
reclassification. Specifically, land classified by the USDA as woodland (wooded land 
used for pasture and grazing) decreased an estimated 72,109 hectares (-10.9%) 
from 2012-2018, close to the amount in which naturally regenerated pine 
timberland increased over this period. 
Timber management in this area is largely focused on the production of sawtimber 
grade timber, and rotation lengths of managed forests have remained unchanged 
(between 25-35 years of age) despite increases in bioenergy demand. Increased 
bioenergy demand, however, has benefited landowners in this catchment area, 
providing additional outlets for pulpwood removed from thinnings – a 
management activity necessary for sawtimber production. 
Market research also shows that changes in management activities as it relates to 
harvest activities has changed very little in the catchment area since 2012. 
Specifically, thinnings have become no more or no less prevalent in the catchment 
area since Enviva Pellets Ahoskie commenced full production in 2012.  
Diversion from other 
markets? 
No / Inconclusive. Since 2012, pulpwood demand not attributed to bioenergy has 
decreased 19%; however, this decrease is largely attributed to decreased demand 
from the pulp/paper sector. Also, demand for softwood and hardwood sawlogs 
have increased an estimated 14% and 7%, respectively, since 2012.  
An unexpected increase in 
wood prices? 
No / Inconclusive. From 2012 through 2014, the first year all three of Enviva’s mills 
together operated at full production, hardwood biomass-related wood demand 
more than quadrupled. This increase in hardwood biomass demand coincided with 
price increases of 10-24% for delivered hardwood pulpwood and hardwood chips 
(the primary raw materials consumed by Enviva’s three pellet mills). However, 
these price increases were also likely linked to a combination of both supply chain 
issues (shortage of local loggers following pulp/paper mill closures in the region) 
and elevated prices offered by Enviva to ensure guaranteed wood supply the first 
several years of operation, as prices for delivered hardwood pulpwood and 
hardwood chips proceeded to decline 16% and 9%, respectively, from 2014 to 
C  A  T  C  H  M  E  N  T     A  R  E  A     A  N  A  L  Y  S  I  S    –    E  N  V  I  V  A     P  E  L  L  E  T  S

Drax – April 2020 
Is there any evidence that 
bioenergy demand has 
caused the following:  
Analysis Findings 
2017 (despite hardwood biomass demand holding steady at between 1.9 and 2.1 
million metric tons per year during this period). Ultimately, hardwood raw material 
prices have increased in the Chesapeake catchment area since Enviva entered this 
market in 2012, and there is sufficient evidence that links changes in these 
hardwood prices to changes in total hardwood pulpwood demand (from all 
sources). However, these changes cannot be linked or attributed to increased 
demand from bioenergy alone.   
Delivered pine pulpwood and pine chips account for a much smaller percentage of 
Enviva’s total wood purchases, and prices for these products increased between 
11-19% from 2012-2014. However, since 2014, prices for these pine products have 
held flat even though softwood raw material purchases (demand) by Enviva have 
more than doubled. In this catchment area, changes in pine pulpwood and pine 
chip prices are largely driven by demand attributed to the pulp/paper sector, and 
there is little evidence to suggest that increased bioenergy-related wood demand 
has caused an abnormal or unexpected increase in these pine raw material prices. 
A reduction in growing stock 
timber? 
No. Total growing stock inventory in the catchment area increased 19% from 2012 
through 2018, the latest available. Specifically, over this period, inventories 
increased as follows for each of the five major timber products: +33% for pine 
sawtimber, +23% for pine chip-n-saw, +14% for pine pulpwood, +12% for 
hardwood sawtimber, and +14% for hardwood pulpwood. 
The increase in timber inventory can be linked to a combination of increased forest 
area (additional hectares = additional inventory) and annual harvest levels below 
the sustainable yield capacity of the catchment area forest (i.e. annual growth has 
continued to exceed annual removals, resulting in increased inventory levels).  
A reduction in the 
sequestration rate of 
carbon? 
No. US Forest Service data shows the average annual growth rate of growing stock 
timber has increased slightly since 2012, and a faster timber growth rate 
essentially represents an increase in the sequestration rate of carbon.  
Increased timber growth rates/carbon sequestration rates can be linked to a 
combination of changes in species composition and silvicultural practices. 
Softwood (pine) grows at a much quicker rate compared to hardwood species, and 
in the Enviva Chesapeake catchment area, pine timberland area increased from 
43.6% of total timberland area in 2011 to 46.0% in 2018. Also, improvements in 
silviculture have continued to enhance growth and overall productivity. Together, 
these factors help explain how average per hectare volume growth increased from 
5.9 m3 in 2011 to 7.7 m3 in 2018. 
Also, worth noting is that increases in timberland area since 2011 have elevated 
total carbon sequestration levels in the catchment area (i.e. more forest area, 
more trees, and more carbon sequestered).  
An increase in harvesting 
above the sustainable yield 
capacity of the forest area? 
No. Growth-to-removals ratios, which compare annual timber growth to annual 
harvests, provides a measure of market demand relative to supply as well as a 
gauge of market sustainability. In 2018, the latest available, growth-to-removals 
ratio for pine and hardwood pulpwood, the timber products utilized by bioenergy, 
equaled 2.49 and 2.76, respectively (a value greater than 1.0 indicates sustainable 
harvest levels). Even with the increased harvesting required to satisfy bioenergy 
demand, harvest levels remain well below the sustainable yield capacity of the 
catchment forest area.

Impact of bioenergy 
demand on:  
Analysis Findings 
Timber growing stock 
inventory 
Neutral. Total wood demand increased an estimated 14% from 2012-2018, and much of 
that increase can be attributed to increased demand from bioenergy. Intuitively, 
increased demand means more timber is harvested, which reduces total growing stock 
inventory. However, in this catchment area, inventories are so substantial that increases 
in demand from bioenergy, as well as from other sources, have not been great enough to 
offset annual timber growth, and, as such, total growing stock inventory has continued to 
increase – an average of 2.9% per year since Enviva first entered this market in 2012.  
Timber growth rates 
Neutral. Timber growth rates have increased for pine sawtimber, pine chip-n-saw, pine 
pulpwood, and hardwood pulpwood since 2012; hardwood sawtimber growth rates have 
declined slightly. Evidence suggests these overall increases in growth rates are linked to 
changes in age class distribution (i.e. a younger forest), not due to changes in bioenergy 
demand.  
Increased growth rates are typically indicative of a younger forest, and this, in part, is 
what USFS data shows. Specifically, USFS data indicates that the average age of softwood 
growing stock timber decreased from 38.8 years old in 2009 to 38.5 years old in 2018. 
However, the average age of hardwood growing stock timber increased from 58.1 to 
60.9 years old over this period. Increases in softwood growth rates reflect the decrease 
in softwood growing stock age, so too is the increase in hardwood growing stock age 
reflected in the decreased hardwood sawtimber growth rates. 
Forest area 
Positive / Neutral. Total forest (timberland) area in the catchment area increased nearly 
83,000 hectares (+1.8%) from 2012 through 2018, the latest available. Our analysis of 
biomass demand and forest area found a strong positive correlation between these two 
variables but also a moderately strong correlation between softwood sawlog demand 
and forest area. However, changes in timberland area were not found to be linked to 
changes in other (non-biomass-related) pulpwood demand or changes in hardwood 
sawlog demand. These findings suggest that increases in timberland area can be 
attributed, in part, to increases in both biomass demand and softwood sawlog demand.  
Wood prices 
Neutral / Negative. Intuitively, an increase in demand should result in an increase in price, 
and that’s what the data shows in this catchment area as it relates to increased biomass 
demand from Enviva’s three pellet mills and the prices of the various raw materials 
consumed by these mills. Specifically, the additional wood demand placed on this market 
by Enviva from 2012-2014 coincided with a 19% increase in delivered pine pulpwood 
price and a 24% increase in delivered hardwood pulpwood price. Pine and hardwood 
chip prices also increased 10-11% over this period.  
However, since 2014, delivered pine and hardwood pulpwood prices, respectively, have 
not moved in sync with softwood biomass demand and hardwood biomass demand. 
While softwood raw material purchases (demand) by Enviva have more than doubled 
since 2014, overall demand for pine pulpwood (from both bioenergy and other sources) 
has remained nearly unchanged, and so too have delivered pine pulpwood prices. Also, 
bioenergy-related hardwood pulpwood demand has held relatively constant since 2014 
but delivered hardwood pulpwood prices have declined. 
Ultimately, while delivered pine pulpwood and pine chip prices have increased in the 
catchment area since Enviva entered this market, results are inconclusive as to the 
impact bioenergy demand has had on these prices, as changes in these prices appear to 
be more directly linked to other sources of demand (i.e. pulp/paper). Also, our analysis 
found evidence that increases in hardwood pulpwood and hardwood chip prices can be 
linked to increases in total hardwood pulpwood demand. However, given that hardwood 
bioenergy demand has accounted for over 75% of total hardwood pulpwood demand in 
the catchment area since 2014, it is reasonable to conclude that hardwood pulpwood

Drax – April 2020 
Impact of bioenergy 
demand on:  
Analysis Findings 
demand attributed to bioenergy has had some level of impact on delivered hardwood 
pulpwood and hardwood chip prices. 
Markets for solid wood 
products 
Positive. In the Enviva Chesapeake catchment area, demand for softwood and hardwood 
sawlogs used to produce lumber and other solid wood products increased 15% and 9%, 
respectively, from 2012-2018. A by-product of the sawmilling process are sawmill 
residuals – a material utilized by Enviva’s three mills to produce wood pellets. With the 
increased production of both softwood and hardwood lumber, so too has come an 
increase in sawmill residuals, some of which has been purchased/consumed by Enviva. 
Not only has Enviva benefited from the greater availability of this by-product, but lumber 
producers have also benefited, as Enviva’s three mills have provided an additional outlet 
for these producers and their by-products. 
Forest landowners 
Positive. Increased demand attributed to bioenergy has been a positive for forest 
landowners in the Chesapeake catchment area. Not only has bioenergy provided an 
additional outlet for pulpwood (particularly hardwood pulpwood), but the increase in 
pulpwood prices as a result of an overall increase in both softwood and hardwood 
pulpwood demand has transferred through to landowners (improved compensation). 
Specifically, since 2013 (the first year all three Enviva pellet mills were operating), 
hardwood pulpwood stumpage price – the price paid to landowners – has averaged 
roughly $5.60 per ton in the Chesapeake catchment area. This represents a 47% increase 
over the approximately $3.80 per ton averaged by hardwood pulpwood stumpage in the 
catchment area over the 10 years prior (2003-2012). Similarly, pine pulpwood stumpage 
price has averaged $12.95 per ton in the catchment area since 2013, up 67% from the 
2003-2012 average of $7.75 per ton. 
Moreover, with increased hardwood pulpwood prices, returns associated with hardwood 
timber management have also been improved, providing landowners with more 
flexibility and expanded timber management options.

2. Market Profile & Resource Assessment  
A mill’s catchment area is the area in which a single pellet mill (“nucleus mill”) has directly acquired fiber 
since the mill started operations, including any additional forest areas where future purchase contracts 
exist. However, given the proximity of Enviva Pellets Ahoskie, Enviva Pellets Southampton, and Enviva 
Pellets Northampton, these three mills operate under a single, extended catchment area to procure the 
required fiber to meet cumulative production needs.  
According to Enviva Biomass, the combined catchment area for these three mills (denoted ‘Chesapeake’ 
catchment area hereafter) extends as far as 480 kilometers north-south and 290 kilometers east-west, 
covering an area nearly 90,000 square kilometers in size. Specifically, this area includes 39 counties in 
North Carolina and 33 counties or independent cities in Virginia (Figure 1).

2.1.1  Forestland 
Forestland, defined by the USDA as land at least 10% stock with trees of any kind, totals approximately 
4,820,507 hectares and constitutes 61% of the catchment area’s total land area.  
Ownership of forestland in the Enviva Chesapeake catchment area is predominantly privately owned. 
According to US Forest Service - Forest Inventory and Analysis (FIA) data from 2018, the latest available, 
privately-owned forestland constitutes 89% of total forestland and totals approximately 4,281,425 
hectares. Public forestland constitutes 11% of total forestland in the catchment area, with National 
Forests totaling 63,376 hectares (1%), other federal forestland totaling 220,647 hectares (5%), and 
forestland owned by state and local authorities totaling 255,059 hectares (5%).

2.1.1.1  Timberland 
Not all forestland is capable of commercial timber production. However, the USDA provides an alternative 
designation for forestland that can be commercially productive. Timberland is defined by the USDA as 
forestland that is capable of producing at least 0.57 m3 of industrial wood per year.  
In the Enviva Chesapeake catchment area, timberland constitutes nearly 98% of total forestland and 
totals approximately 4,704,058 hectares. Note that this report will focus specifically on timberland, and all 
data provided hereafter regarding timber inventory, growth, and removals will be from timberland only. 
Ownership of timberland in the Enviva Chesapeake catchment area is similar to that of forestland, with 
91% (4,278,481 hectares) of total timberland privately owned, compared to 1% (56,006 hectares) 
National Forests, 3% (132,813 hectares) other federal, and 5% (236,757 hectares) owned by state and 
local authorities.

Age Class Distribution 
According to US Forest Service data, of the 11,623,969 hectares of timberland in the catchment area, 
approximately 44% (2,092,411 hectares) is softwood, 43% (2,008,138 hectares) is hardwood, and 13% 
(603,508 hectares) is mixed pine-hardwood. 
Distribution of timberland area by age class varies by forest type. Approximately 83% of softwood 
timberland is 40 years of age or younger, with 56% less than 26 years of age. Distribution of mixed pine-
hardwood timberland closely resembles that of softwood timberland, with approximately 70% of mixed 
pine-hardwood timberland 45 years of age or younger. 
US Forest Service data shows that approximately 11% of hardwood timberland is five years of age or 
younger. This value presumably includes transitional stands and those with low stocking levels that will 
likely not reach maturity. However, if we exclude this youngest age class, hardwood timberland area has a 
bimodal distribution – with approximately 29% of the remaining area 6-30 years old and 44% of 
hardwood timberland 51-90 years old.

Stand Origin 
The US Forest Service provides two classifications for stand origin: 1) naturally regenerated and 2) 
planted. The USFS defines a naturally regenerated timber stand as one that has been established 
naturally. A planted timber stand is defined as an artificially regenerated stand established by planting or 
artificial seedling.  
Based on the most current USFS estimates, approximately 69% (3,264,169 hectares) of total catchment 
area timberland is classified as naturally regenerated forests versus 31% (1,439,889 hectares) planted 
forests. However, the distribution of timberland area by stand origin varies widely by major forest type. 
US Forest Service data shows approximately 46% (1,106,234 hectares) of softwood timberland is naturally 
regenerated versus 54% (1,313,217 hectares) planted. In contrast, approximately 94% (2,157,934 
hectares) of hardwood timberland is naturally regenerated, compared to 6% (126,672 hectares) planted.

2.2  Timber Inventory 
Timber inventory data for the Enviva Chesapeake catchment area is provided by the US Forest Service - 
Forest Inventory & Analysis (FIA) program. FIA data utilizes approximately 50-60 sample plots per county 
to calculate inventory estimates, with sampling errors of 10-25%.  
Note that this section profiles timber inventory, growth, and removal details as of 20181, the most 
current available. Further analysis, including inventory trends since 2000 and projections through 2022, is 
provided in the Market Trends, Analysis, & Outlook section beginning on page 51. 
2.2.1  By Ownership Group 
Growing stock inventory on timberland in the Enviva Chesapeake catchment area totals an estimated 693 
million m3, of which approximately 86% (617 million m3) is privately owned, 6% (38 million m3) is owned 
by state and local authorities, 4% (29 million m3) is owned by other federal authorities, and 1% (9 million 
m3) is National Forest.  
Note that the distributions of both softwood and hardwood growing stock inventory by ownership group 
are nearly identical to that of total growing stock inventory. See Table 7 for details.

2.2.2  By Diameter Class Distribution 
Distribution of total growing stock inventory on timberland by diameter class varies by major species 
group. Based on the most current US Forest Service data, the distribution of softwood growing stock 
inventory shows approximately 74% (262 million m3) is 7- 17 inches in diameter, with 89% (314 million 
m3) of total softwood inventory 5-19 inches in diameter. 
Hardwood growing stock inventory’s distribution is a bit more widespread than that of softwood 
inventory, with 73% (250 million m3) of hardwood inventory 5-19 inches in diameter, and 91% (312 
million m3) less than 25 inches in diameter.  
Based on these diameter class distributions, softwood growing stock inventory averages an estimated 
12.9 inches in diameter, compared to 15.5 inches for hardwood growing stock.

In addition, FIA estimates of diameter class distribution by major species group allow us to break down 
volume estimates according to major timber product. Since pine constitutes 97% of total softwood 
inventory in the catchment area (according to FIA data), for these calculations, all softwood inventory is 
considered pine. Individual product specifications are defined as follows: 
Major Product  
DBH (inches) 
Pine Pulpwood  
5.0 – 8.9 
Pine Chip-n-saw 
9.0 – 11.9 
Pine Sawtimber  
12.0+ 
Hardwood Pulpwood 
5.0 – 9.9 
Hardwood Sawtimber  10.0+ 
 
Based on these product specifications, approximately 180 million m3 of total growing stock inventory is 
classified as pine sawtimber (26%), compared to 93 million m3 of pine chip-n-saw (13%), 79 million m3 of 
pine pulpwood (12%), 263 million m3 of hardwood sawtimber (38%), and 79 million m3 of hardwood 
pulpwood (11%).

2.2.3  By Age Class Distribution 
Distribution of total growing stock volume on timberland by age class is bimodal, with approximately 51% 
of total inventory 11-45 years of age and 37% of total inventory 51-95 years of age (see Figure 8). 
However, this is explained by major species composition and its respective age class distribution. 
According to US Forest Service data, the distribution of softwood growing stock volume by age class shows 
that 64% (226 million m3) is 11-40 years of age, with only 17% (61 million m3) greater than 60 years of age. 
In contrast, hardwood inventory’s distribution is more widespread, with 54% (183 million m3) 56-95 years 
of age and 87% (296 million m3) 21-95 years of age. 
Based on these age class distributions, softwood growing stock inventory averages an estimated 38.6 
years old, compared to 60.9 years old for hardwood growing stock.

2.2.4  By Stand Origin 
US Forest Service data includes two classifications for stand origin: 1) naturally regenerated timber stands 
and 2) planted timber stands. Specifically, naturally regenerated timber stands are defined by the USFS as 
those that have been established naturally. A planted timber stand is defined as an artificially regenerated 
stand established by planting or artificial seedling. 
Based on the most current US Forest Service FIA estimates, approximately 73% of total growing stock 
volume in the catchment area, or 505 million m3, is naturally regenerated timber, compared to 27% (189 
million m3) that was planted. However, stand origin distribution varies widely by major species group. 
US Forest Service data shows approximately 51% (179 million m3) of softwood growing stock is naturally 
regenerated versus 49% (173 million m3) planted. In contrast, approximately 95% (326 million m3) of 
hardwood inventory is naturally regenerated, compared to 5% (16 million m3) planted.

2.3  Timber Growth & Removals 
2.3.1  Timber Growth 
According to US Forest Service data, net annual growth of growing stock timber in the Enviva Chesapeake 
catchment area totaled an estimated 35.7 million m3 in 2018, the latest available. Specifically, 70% (24.8 
million m3) of total growth was attributed to softwood species compared to 30% (10.9 million m3) 
hardwood species.  
Annual growth was highest for pine pulpwood, totaling 9.2 million m3 and accounting for 26% of total 
volume growth, followed by pine sawtimber at 8.6 million m3 (24%), pine chip-n-saw at 7.0 million m3 
(20%), hardwood sawtimber at 6.2 million m3 (17%), and hardwood pulpwood at 4.8 million m3 (13%).

2.3.2  Timber Removals 
According to the USFS, timber removals in the catchment area totaled 19.8 million m3 in 2018, of which 
approximately 73% (14.4 million m3) was softwood timber and 27% (5.4 million m3) was hardwood timber.  
Of the five major timber products, removals were highest for pine sawtimber, totaling 6.6 million m3 and 
accounting for 33% of total removals, followed by pine chip-n-saw at 4.1 million m3 (20%), pine pulpwood 
at 3.7 million m3 (19%), hardwood sawtimber at 3.7 million m3 (19%), and hardwood pulpwood at 1.7 
million m3 (9%).

2.3.3  Growth-to-Removals Ratios 
Growth-to-removals analysis compares annual timber growth to annual harvests and provides a measure 
of market demand relative to supply. A growth-to-removals ratio of 1.0 indicates a balanced market 
where growth equals removals. A value of >1 indicates growth exceeds removals, signifying sustainable 
harvest levels (as well as oversupply). A value of <1 indicates removals (or harvest levels) exceed growth, 
signifying more highly competitive market conditions and harvest levels that are unsustainable over the 
long term. 
According to US Forest Service data from 2018, the latest available, overall inventory growth totaled 35.7 
million m3, compared to total removals of 19.8 million m3, or a growth-to-removals ratio of 1.81. The 
growth-to-removal ratio for softwood species was 1.71 compared to 2.03 for hardwood species. 
Growth-to-removals ratios by species and individual timber product are as follows: pine sawtimber=1.30, 
pine chip-n-saw=1.72, pine pulpwood=2.49, hardwood sawtimber=1.68, and hardwood pulpwood=2.76. 
Note that growth-to-removal ratios for all five major timber products are well above 1.0, indicating 
sustainable market conditions as well as oversupply.

3.  Wood Demand & Raw Material Cost Assessment 
 
3.1  Mill Capacity & Wood Demand 
According to TimberMart-South’s mill database, as of the end 2019, there were 146 wood-consuming 
mills operating in and around the Enviva Chesapeake catchment area (within 175 miles of Enviva Pellets 
Ahoskie, Northampton, or Southampton). This includes 106 lumber mills (54 softwood mills and 52 
hardwood mills), 12 pulp/paper mills, 13 panel (plywood/OSB) mills, 8 chip mills, and 7 pellet mills 
(including the three Enviva mills).  
Total production capacity associated with these 146 mills translates to over 46 million metric tons of 
roundwood per year. However, not all wood consumed by these mills are procured from within the 
Enviva Chesapeake catchment area. Based on the relative location of these mills to Enviva’s three mills 
and the catchment area, we estimate the total allocated capacity of these mills to the Enviva Chesapeake 
catchment area at approximately 24,586,402 metric tons.

3.1.1  Catchment Area Wood Demand 
Note that total capacity is not the same as actual demand, but rather the maximum potential demand 
associated with mills running at full production capacity. While total capacity is estimated at 
approximately 24.6 million metric tons, actual wood demand2 in the Enviva Chesapeake catchment area 
in 2018, the latest available, was estimated at 23.6 million metric tons. 
Distribution of total wood demand by major species in 2018 included 67% (15.8 million metric tons) 
softwood and 33% (7.8 million metric tons) hardwood. Specifically, 74% of total softwood demand was 
attributed to softwood sawlogs, compared to 26% softwood pulpwood. Of total hardwood demand, an 
estimated 67% was attributed to hardwood sawlogs versus 33% hardwood pulpwood.

3.1.1.1  Biomass Demand 
Biomass demand, defined in this analysis as softwood and hardwood pulpwood (roundwood) consumed 
by pellet or other bioenergy facilities, totaled an estimated 2.4 million metric tons in 2018, the latest 
available, accounting for approximately 36% of total pulpwood demand. Non-bioenergy related pulpwood 
demand, predominately for pulp/paper production, accounted for approximately 64% of total pulpwood 
demand in the catchment area. 
Note that not all wood consumed by a pellet mill or other bioenergy facility is encompassed in biomass 
demand. Wood consumption (demand) at pellet and other bioenergy facilities generally includes a 
combination of wood chips and sawmill residuals. However, sawmill residuals are a by-product of the 
sawmilling process – from the processing of sawlogs, not pulpwood. As such, sawmill residuals consumed 
by biomass facilities are not included in our calculation of biomass demand.

3.2  Raw Material Costs   
Current and historic prices for both stumpage and delivered timber as well as pulp quality chips have 
been provided by TimberMart-South (TMS). Note that these prices are specific to the Enviva Chesapeake 
catchment area and are average market prices calculated from actual timber sales reported to TMS.  
 
3.2.1  Stumpage (Standing Timber) Prices 
Stumpage price is the value of timber as it stands uncut on the stump and is what landowners are paid by 
loggers and other wood buyers for their standing timber.   
Table 19 below provides annual average stumpage prices in the Enviva Chesapeake catchment area for 
each of the five major timber products since 2000. For a detailed assessment of these prices and historic 
trends, see the Market Trends, Analysis, & Outlook section beginning on page 51.

3.2.4  Timber Price Drivers 
A detailed assessment of raw material prices and price trends is provided in the Market Trends, Analysis, 
& Outlook section beginning on page 51. However, we would like to point out and highlight some of the 
major price drivers and indicators. 
 Production.  Production levels for forest products are representative of wood demand and have 
historically been a strong indicator of timber price. The figure below shows annual Southern pine 
lumber production and annual average pine sawtimber stumpage prices in the Enviva 
Chesapeake catchment area from 2000-2019. Looking at this figure, pine sawtimber price closely 
tracked lumber production through around 2010. However, the relationship has been much 
weaker since. Specifically, according to the Southern Forest Products Association, southern pine 
lumber production increased 55% from 2010-2019, whereas pine sawtimber stumpage price 
increased only 7% over this period. This divergence in production and price is largely due to 
increases in wood supply, which is documented in detail in subsequent sections of this report.  
 
Source: Southern Forest Products Association, TimberMart-South 
 
 Domestic Economy.  The state of the domestic economy also drives changes in timber prices both 
locally and across the Southern region. Financial markets generally reflect economic conditions 
and have historically been a strong indicator of price. For instance, the figure below shows pine 
sawtimber stumpage prices in the catchment area closely followed the Dow Jones Industrial 
Average (DJIA) from 2000-2010. However, persistent wood oversupply since that time has caused 
these two to diverge and financial markets to weaken as an indicator of sawtimber price.

Drax – April 2020 
 Housing Starts. US residential building construction is a principal driver of the wood products 
industry, and domestic housing starts have historically been a major indicator of sawtimber price. 
However, the relationship between these two has been much weaker through the 2010s due in 
large part to wood oversupply. Specifically, according to the US Census Bureau, US housing starts 
have increased 61% since 2012, compared to an increase of 22% for pine sawtimber stumpage 
prices in the Enviva Chesapeake catchment area. See figure below.  
 
Source: US Census Bureau, TimberMart-South 
 
 International Trade. International trade and foreign trade policy also drive changes in timber 
prices, particularly those of hardwood sawtimber. Specifically, hardwood log and lumber exports, 
which constitute around 65-75% of total US log and lumber exports, averaged approximately 4.7 
million m3 per year from 2000-2012. However, exports increased 24% from 2012 to 2014 and 
since have averaged 5.9 million m3 per year. Hardwood sawtimber stumpage prices in the Enviva 
Chesapeake catchment area closely tracked exports (see figure below), increasing more than 40% 
from 2012-2014. However, trade policies enacted by the current US President over the last 
several years have slowed growth in US exports and, consequently, hardwood sawtimber prices 
have held relatively flat since.

 Weather. Weather trends also impact timber prices; however, these trends are much more 
seasonal in nature and affect short-term price movements. In this region, wet conditions typically 
persist throughout the winter (in the 1st and 4th quarters of the year), creating wood accessibility 
issues and constraining supply. And, as a result, timber prices increase over the short term. 
However, wet winters are followed by hot summers, which alleviate supply constraints and 
provide greater access to wood. In turn, with supply no longer an issue, timber prices decline in 
the short term (typically during the 2nd or 3rd quarter of the year). 
However, the Chesapeake market is also impacted periodically by hurricanes and tropical storms, 
with hurricane season typically occurring between July and October (3rd and 4th quarters of the 
year). These storms can bring heavy rainfall that constrain wood supply, driving prices upward in 
the short term. However, tropical storms with extremely high winds can also cause extensive 
forest damage, resulting in short-term oversupply from wood salvage and driving prices 
downward. 
The figure below shows quarterly average pine pulpwood and hardwood pulpwood stumpage 
prices in the Enviva Chesapeake catchment from 2000 through 2019, identifying seasonal 
weather-related price spikes as well as major hurricanes and tropical storms that impacted this 
market. Note that of the 15 seasonal spikes identified below, 14 (93%) occurred in either the 1st 
or 4th quarter of the year or within two quarters of a major hurricane or tropical storm.

4. Forest Management Practices Assessment 
Historic timber sales reported to TimberMart-South were examined to help assess how forest 
management practices in the Enviva Chesapeake catchment area and surrounding markets have changed 
since 2000. Specifically, we examined trends related to total sale volume, hectares, and harvest type to 
identify how this area responds to various market conditions. Study details and key findings are detailed 
below and on the following pages.  
 
4.1  TimberMart-South Harvest Trends 
The TimberMart-South (TMS) sales database includes over 105,000 unique timber sales that have 
occurred throughout the TMS 11-state region since 2000. In addition to providing details regarding 
timber prices (by product), these reported sales include information regarding date of sale, location, sale 
volume, sale size (hectares), sale type (final harvest/clearcut vs. thinning), and other unique sale 
characteristics. The data provided in the following section contains some of these stumpage characteristic 
details, particularly those related to trends in sale type and harvesting activities. 
The Enviva Chesapeake catchment area is located in two different TMS regions: North Carolina Region 2 
and Virginia Region 2 (see highlighted portion Figure 19). Data and trends for this 2-region area (denoted 
‘Chesapeake market’ hereafter) have been provided and are intended to be representative of the 
catchment area.   
Note that TMS database sales utilized for this portion of the assessment only includes those reported 
sales with total sale volumes between 450 and 45,000 metric tons. Sales that fell outside these 
parameters were excluded to ensure consistency and to mitigate potential bias from major outliers.

4.1.1  Total Sale Area 
In the Chesapeake market, total reported sale area has remained fairly consistent since 2000. However, 
the data shows a noticeable shift occurred in the distribution of reported sale area by harvest type 
(clearcut vs. thinning) from 2007-2012.  
Clearcuts and thinnings are the two major types of harvests that occur in the region, both of which are 
long-standing, widely used methods of harvesting timber. Specifically, in the Chesapeake market, thinned 
hectares as a percentage of total reported sale area remained between roughly 30-45% from 2000-2005 
before increasing and peaking at 73% in 2009. This percentage proceeded to decline through the early to 
mid-2010s, but since 2014 has held relatively steady and average approximately 40%.  
This data shows thinnings increased (and clearcuts decreased) when market conditions tighten with the 
bursting of the US housing bubble in 2006 and Great Recession that followed. Specifically, thinnings 
increased and accounted for 65% of the total sale area from 2006-2012. In contrast, if we consider 2000-
2005 and 2013-2019, over these periods, thinnings accounted for less than 40% of total sale area.

4.1.2  Total Sale Volume 
In the Chesapeake market, total reported sale volume has fluctuated to a certain extent but overall held 
relatively steady and averaged approximately 950,000 metric tons per year since 2007. Prior to this 
(2000-2006), total reported sale volume averaged roughly 645,000 metric tons per year.  
However, as with total sale area, the distribution of total sale volume by harvest type shows that the 
proportion of total volume attributed to thinnings increased substantially between 2007 and 2012, with 
thinnings accounting for 46% of total reported sale volume over this period. In contrast, from 2000-2006 
and from 2013-2019, thinnings accounted for an average of 22% of total reported sale volume.  
Note that the increase in thinning volume (as a percentage of total sale volume) from 2007-2012 suggests 
landowners altered their management approach in response to poor market conditions. More 
specifically, this data suggests that many landowners in this market opted to thin when markets 
weakened, presumably waiting until timber prices improved before proceeding with the clearcut of 
mature timber stands. However, the data suggests that as markets conditions settled and stabilized in the 
early 2010s, many landowners in this market reverted to more standard management practices, deciding 
to clearcut, not thin, mature timber stands.

4.1.3  Average Sale Size 
Average sale size in the Chesapeake market averaged approximately 44 hectares in size from 2000-2019. 
However, reported sale data shows that thinnings have averaged 49% (+19 hectares) larger than clearcuts 
since 2000, with thinnings averaging 57 hectares in size compared to 38 hectares for clearcuts.  
Also, worth noting is that the average size of clearcuts in this market have increased since 2000 while the 
average size of thinnings have decreased. Specifically, clearcuts averaged 33 hectares in size from 2000-
2006, increasing to an average of 41 hectares from 2012-2019. In contrast, over these same two periods, 
thinnings decreased from an average of 59 to 51 hectares in size. In comparison, thinnings averaged 79% 
(+26 hectares) larger than clearcuts from 2000-2006 but 26% (+10 hectares) larger than clearcuts from 
2012-2019.  
In general, clearcuts tend to be smaller than thinnings in size due to capital requirements (for the 
logger/wood buyer), as clearcuts typically remove more timber volume per hectare and are more costly 
than thinnings. For example, given the same amount of capital, a wood buyer/logger can purchase a 50-
hectare tract to be clearcut or a 75-hectare tract to be thinned. Also, loggers/wood buyers typically prefer 
larger tracts for thinning because it allows them to take advantage of economies of scale.

5. Market Trends, Analysis, & Outlook  
The following section provides an examination and assessment of market trends in the Enviva 
Chesapeake catchment area since 2000, including changes in land use, forest area, timber inventory, 
growth, removals, wood demand, and raw material costs. In addition, a market outlook through 2022 is 
also provided in this section. This outlook details anticipated changes in wood demand and how these 
changes are likely to impact this market over the next several years.  
5.1  Market Trends & Analysis 
A key aspect of this analysis includes assessing and identifying any links or relationships between biomass-
related wood demand and other market changes (i.e. forest area, inventory, raw material prices, etc.) in 
the catchment area, particularly since Enviva commenced pellet production at its Ahoskie mill in late 
2011. As such, this section will begin with an assessment of annual wood demand. 
5.1.1  Wood Demand 
Annual wood demand3 in the Enviva Chesapeake catchment area increased at a steady rate of 1.4% per 
year from 25.9 million metric tons in 2000 to 27.7 million metric tons in 2005. However, demand started 
to decline in 2006 and by 2011 had fallen to 20.1 million metric tons, or a 27% decrease in just a 6-year 
period. Total annual wood demand held steady through 2012 but proceeded to increase an average of of 
2.2% per year over the six years that followed, to an estimated 23.6 million metric tons in 2018.

5.1.1.1  Biomass Demand 
Biomass demand is defined as softwood and hardwood pulpwood (roundwood) consumed by pellet or 
other bioenergy facilities.  
Prior to 2008, there was no wood demand attributed to pellet or other bioenergy facilities. However, with 
the startup of Biomass Energy LLC in Bumpass, Virginia, biomass demand totaled an estimated 15,231 
metric tons in 2008, and steadily increased to approximately 24,059 metric tons in 2011. Biomass 
demand increased to an estimated 503,779 metric tons in 2012 following the startup of Enviva Pellets 
Ahoskie (in late 2011) and continued to increase over the next several years with the startup of Enviva 
Pellets Northampton in early 2014 and Enviva Pellets Southampton in late 2015, with bioenergy-related 
wood demand increasing to 2.41 million metric tons in 2016. Biomass demand has decreased slightly 
since that time, averaging 2.34 million metric tons per year from 2017 through 2019.  
Also note biomass demand’s changing contribution towards total pulpwood demand in the catchment 
area. Specifically, biomass demand as a percentage of total pulpwood demand increased from <1% from 
2008-2011, to 9% in 2012, to 28% in 2014, and to an average of 36% from 2016-2019.

5.1.2  Changes in Land Area & Use 
Notable changes in land area have occurred in the catchment area since 2000, including a 0.8% increase 
in forestland and a 16% decrease in land in farms (i.e. cropland, woodland, and pastureland). Also, urban 
areas or land classified as having other uses more than doubled from 2000 to 2018. 
According to the USDA, total forestland increased from 4,784,081 hectares in 2000 to 4,820,507 hectares 
in 2018, or a net increase of 36,426 hectares (+0.8%) over this 18-year period. Also, over this same 
period, land in farms decreased a total of 442,819 hectares, with cropland decreasing 120,905 hectares (-
7%), woodland decreasing 181,756 hectares (-24%), and pastureland decreasing 140,159 hectares (-37%).  
Urban areas and land classified as having other uses increased an estimated 406,393 hectares from 2000-
2018. However, note that urban and other lands have held steady at an average of approximately 
760,000 hectares since 2009. See Table 24 for details.

Drax – April 2020 
Figures 28 and 29 provide a side-by-side comparison of biomass demand versus forestland and land in 
farms in the catchment area from 2000-2018. Looking at these figures, particularly since 2011, we see 
that forestland has closely tracked biomass demand while land in farms has continued its downward 
trend, despite changes in biomass demand. Correlation analysis confirmed these relationships, identifying 
a moderately strong positive correlation between biomass demand and forestland (correlation 
coefficient=0.64) and a moderately strong negative correlation between biomass demand and land in 
farms (correlation coefficient=-0.64). 
Further analysis also identified moderately strong negative relationships between forestland and other 
(non-biomass) pulpwood demand and a weak positive relationship between forestland and total sawlog 
demand in the catchment area over this period, suggesting that increases in biomass demand and (to a 
lesser degree) sawlog demand have caused increases in forestland (conversion from farmland).  
Ultimately, it does seem completely plausible and very likely that the emergence and growth of bioenergy 
markets in this region have had some positive influence on forestland, but there is not enough evidence 
to conclude that bioenergy markets alone have caused these changes.

5.1.3  Changes in Forest Area (Timberland) 
According to US Forest Service data, timberland area in the Enviva Chesapeake catchment area 
experienced a net increase of 31,200 hectares (+0.7%) from 2000-2018, the latest available, increasing 
from 4,672,857 to 4,704,058 hectares over this 18-year period. However, note that the total area of 
timberland declined in the mid to late-2000s, but from 2010-2018, timberland area increased an 
estimated 88,896 hectares, or a 1.9% increase compared to 2010 levels.  
The composition of timberland in the catchment area also underwent changes between 2000 and 2018. 
Specifically, planted pine timberland increased 339,055 hectares (+35%) and natural pine increased 
12,948 hectares (+2%) over this period. Planted and naturally regenerated hardwood timberland 
decreased 67,869 hectares (-35%) and 246,383 hectares (-11%), respectively, from 2000-2018. Natural 
mixed pine-hardwood timberland decreased 6,551 hectares (-1%). 
Note that the significant increase in planted pine timberland since 2000 has coincided with a 
simultaneous decrease in farmland in the catchment area. Specifically, the 339,055-hectare increase in 
planted pine timberland accounts for nearly 80% of the 442,819-hectare decrease in farmland since 
2000.

5.1.3.1  By Forest Type & Physiographic Class 
According to the US Forest Service, timberland classified as uplands and flatwoods4 increased from an 
estimated 3,903,238 hectares in 2000 to 3,950,799 hectares in 2005, or a net increase of 47,562 hectares 
(+1.2%) over this 5-year period. Uplands and flatwoods timberland held steady over the next several 
years and was down and up through the late 2000s and early-to-mid-2010s. However, this classification 
of timberland has held steady and averaged just under 3,950,000 hectares since 2014.  
Bottomland and other hydric5 timberland declined from an estimated 769,620 hectares in 2000 to 
680,330 hectares in 2007, or a net decrease of 89,290 hectares (-12%) over this period. However, since 
2007, bottomland and other hydric timberland has increased an estimated 76,212 hectares (+11%), to 
756,542 hectares in 2018.  
We’d like to note that since 2011, only upland/flatwood hardwood and mixed pine-hardwood timberland 
has declined in the catchment area. Specifically, from 2011-2018, upland/flatwood hardwood timberland 
decreased an estimated 90,508 hectares (-6%) and upland/flatwood mixed pine-hardwood timberland 
decreased 8,130 hectares (-1%). Over this same period, bottomland softwood, hardwood, and mixed 
pine-hardwood timberland all increased – a combined 58,974 hectares (+8%).

Correlation Analysis:  Biomass Demand vs. Timberland 
Figures 32 provides a side-by-side comparison of both biomass demand and total wood demand versus 
area of timberland in the catchment area from 2000-2018. In comparing changes in biomass demand to 
changes in timberland area, what we see is that biomass demand and timberland area have closely 
tracked one another since around 2012, and to a lesser degree from 2008-2011. Prior to 2008, there was 
no biomass-related wood demand in the catchment area. However, overall, correlation analysis identified 
a moderately strong positive correlation (correlation coefficient=0.61) between biomass demand and 
timberland area from 2000-2018. 
Figure 32(b), which compares total wood demand to area of timberland in the catchment area since 
2000, provides a bit more insight and shows that total wood demand loosely tracked timberland area 
from 2000-2007; however, the two have more closely followed one another since 2008. Correlation 
analysis ultimately identified a weak positive correlation between total demand and timberland 
(correlation coefficient=0.41) from 2000-2018. However, note that a strong correlation (correlation 
coefficient=0.79) was found between total wood demand and total area of timberland from 2008-2018.

5.1.4  Changes in Timber Inventory 
Timber inventory data for the Enviva Chesapeake catchment area is provided by the US Forest Service - 
Forest Inventory & Analysis (FIA) program from 2000 through 20186, the most current available.  
According to US Forest Service data, total growing stock inventory on timberland in the Enviva 
Chesapeake catchment area increased from 523 million m3 in 2000 to 693 million m3 in 2018, or a net 
increase of 170 million m3 (+32%) over this period. Note, however, that much of this growth in inventory 
has occurred since 2011. Specifically, total growing stock inventory increased 11% (+0.9% per year) from 
2000-2011 but 19% (+2.9% per year) from 2011-2018.  
See Table 28 below for timber inventory estimates, including a breakdown by major timber product, in 
the catchment area from 2000 through 2018, the latest available.

Figure 33. Enviva Chesapeake Catchment Area - Timber Inventory by Major Timber Product (2000-2018) 
 
 
Note that inventories of all five major timber products increased from 2000-2018. Pine sawtimber 
inventory increased the largest amount over this period, increasing 67 million m3 (+59%) from 2000-2018, 
followed by inventories of hardwood sawtimber (+48 million m3; +22%), pine chip-n-saw (+29 million m3; 
+45%), pine pulpwood (+17 million m3; +27%), and hardwood pulpwood (+9 million m3; +13%).   
However, also note the rate at which inventory levels increased went up substantially from 2011-2018. 
Reduced harvest levels in the late 2000s and early 2010s allowed inventory levels to grow so large that 
annual timber growth far outpaced removals, resulting in an inventory compounding affect. Specifically, 
comparing the average annual rate of inventory growth for each of the five major products from 2000-
2011 versus 2011-2018:

5.1.4.1  Diameter Class Distribution 
Total growing stock inventory on timberland increased from 523 million m3 in 2000 to 693 million m3 in 
2018, or a net increase of 170 million m3 (+32% total; +1.6% per year average). However, the actual 
distribution of growing stock inventory by diameter class in the catchment area has remained nearly 
unchanged for softwood inventory since 2000 (and changed only slightly for hardwood inventory).  
Table 29 below provides a comparison of growing stock inventory estimates in the catchment area by 
major species group and diameter class in 2000, 2009, and 2018. Specifically, USFS data shows that in 
2000, 2009, and 2018, approximately 94% of softwood growing stock inventory was less than 21 inches in 
diameter, with approximately 75% of softwood inventory 7-17 inches in diameter in each of these three 
periods.  
The historic distributions of hardwood growing stock inventory by diameter class show 91-94% of 
hardwood inventory was less than 25 inches in diameter in 2000, 2009, and 2018. However, in 2000, 
approximately 79% of hardwood growing stock inventory was less than 19 inches in diameter, compared 
to 76% in 2009 and 73% in 2018 within these same parameters.

5.1.4.2  Age Class Distribution 
Examination of changes in growing stock inventory by age class reveals some interesting trends amongst 
major species groups. Specifically, USFS data indicates average age of softwood growing stock inventory 
in the catchment area decreased from 40.2 years old in 2000 to 38.8 years old in 2009 and to 38.5 years 
old in 2018. However, the average age of hardwood growing stock inventory increased over this same 
period – from 55.9 to 58.1 and to 60.9 years old in 2000, 2009, and 2018, respectively. 
These changes in average age are explained by changes in age class distribution over this period. 
Specifically, the distribution of softwood growing stock inventory 40 years of age or younger increased 
from 58% in 2000 to 63% in 2009 and to 65% in 2018. Conversely, the distribution of hardwood growing 
stock inventory greater than 50 years of age increased from 61% to 64% and to 67% over these same 
three periods.  
Table 30 below provides US Forest Service estimates of softwood and hardwood growing stock inventory 
by age class in 2000, 2009, and 2018. Corresponding values are shows graphically in Figure 36.

Correlation Analysis:  Biomass Demand vs. Timber Inventory 
US Forest Service data shows that, since 2000, timber inventory has continued to increase in the 
catchment area, and at a more rapid pace since around 2010-2011. Intuitively, timber inventories can 
increase one of two ways: 1) through additional timberland gains or 2) through an environment in which 
annual growth outpaces annual removals.  
In the Enviva Chesapeake catchment area, both have occurred. Specifically, total timberland in the 
catchment area increased by over 31,000 hectares from 2000-2018, largely from the conversion of 
agricultural land. In addition, the extended period of reduced wood demand from 2007-2011 (caused by 
the bursting of the US housing bubble in 2006 and Great Recession that followed) allowed timber 
inventory in the catchment area to grow to such substantial levels that annual timber growth has 
continued to outpace annual removals (demand), leading to persistent oversupply and increased 
inventory levels. 
Correlation analysis confirms the direct relationship between timberland and timber inventory as well as 
the inverse relationship between agricultural land (land in farms) and timber inventory. Specifically, 
timber inventory was found to have a moderately strong positive correlation (correlation 
coefficient=0.46) with timberland and a strong negative correlation (correlation coefficient=-0.76) with 
land in farms in the catchment area from 2000-2018.

Like total timber inventory, inventories of both pine and hardwood pulpwood have also increased in the 
catchment area since 2000, and there is some evidence that links these increases to changes in wood 
demand. Specifically, Figures 38 provides a side-by-side comparison of pulpwood demand (which includes 
both biomass-related and other pulpwood demand) versus pulpwood inventory in the catchment area 
from 2000-2018.   
Figure 38(a), which provides a comparison of softwood pulpwood demand and pine pulpwood inventory, 
shows these two sets of variables have tracked one another fairly closely since 2000. Correlation analysis 
confirmed this relationship, identifying a strong positive correlation (correlation coefficient=0.81) 
between softwood pulpwood demand and pine pulpwood inventory from 2000-2018. 
On the other hand, Figure 38(b), which provides a comparison of hardwood pulpwood demand and 
hardwood pulpwood inventory, shows no clearly identifiable relationship between these two sets of 
variables. Hardwood pulpwood inventory appears to move inversely to hardwood pulpwood demand 
from 2000-2010; however, after this, these two variables more closely track one another. Correlation 
analysis confirms the lack of an identifiable relationship, identifying no correlation (correlation 
coefficient=-0.08) between hardwood pulpwood demand and hardwood pulpwood inventory from 2000-
2018.

Note, however, that statistical analysis identified a strong positive correlation (correlation 
coefficient=0.96) between hardwood biomass demand, which has accounted for over 75% of total 
hardwood pulpwood demand since 2015, and hardwood pulpwood inventory. 
The strong positive correlations found between pulpwood/biomass demand and pulpwood inventories 
are largely coincidental in nature, not indicative of a causal relationship. In other words, increases in 
softwood or hardwood biomass demand have not caused softwood/hardwood pulpwood inventory levels 
to increase in the catchment area. As we will detail in subsequent sections, annual growth has continued 
to outpace annual removals every year since 2005 (despite increases in biomass demand), and as a result 
inventory levels have continued to increase.

5.1.5  Changes in Annual Timber Growth 
Timber growth data for the Enviva Chesapeake catchment area is provided by the US Forest Service - 
Forest Inventory & Analysis (FIA) program. However, note that FIA growth data for this catchment area is 
only available since 2005. As such, this section provides an examination of historical timber growth from 
2005 through 2018, the latest available. 
According to US Forest Service data, net growth in timber volume totaled 27.2 million m3 in 2005, 
decreasing to 26.3 million m3 in 2010. However, since that time, total annual growth has increased an 
average of 3.9% per year (+36% total), to 35.7 million m3 in 2018. See Table 32.

5.1.5.1  Growth Rates & Per-Acre Growth 
According to USFS data, average annual growth rates in the catchment area declined slightly from 2005-
2009. However, over the last nine years, the annual timber growth rates have steadily risen, increasing 
from 4.7% in 2010 to 5.2% in 2018. Specifically, since 2010, growth rates have increased for all three 
major pine products but more-or-less held constant for both hardwood sawtimber and hardwood 
pulpwood. See Table 33. 
Examination of changes in average per-hectare volume growth provides a bit more insight and evidence 
of a more productive forest. Specifically, US Forest Service data indicates the average per-hectare growth 
increased from 5.64 m3 in 2010 to 7.71 m3 in 2018, with average per-hectare growth increasing for all five 
major timber products over this period (see Table 34).  
Evidence of a more productive forest aligns with what we’ve observed with changes in land use and 
timber management trends. Specifically, nearly 68,000 hectares of farmland (i.e. cropland, woodland, and 
pastureland) was converted to timberland from 2010-2018. In addition, FIA data indicates that roughly 
3% of naturally regenerated hardwood timberland was converted to more productive pine timberland 
over this period.

Correlation Analysis:  Biomass Demand vs. Timber Growth 
Figure 42(a) provides a side-by-side comparison of softwood pulpwood demand (including softwood 
biomass demand) and annual pine pulpwood growth in the catchment area from 2005-2018. This data 
shows softwood pulpwood demand and pine pulpwood growth have closely tracked one another since 
2005. Correlation analysis confirmed this relationship, identifying a strong positive correlation 
(correlation coefficient=0.90) between these two from 2005-2018.  
In Figure 42(b), no clear relationship stands out between hardwood pulpwood demand and hardwood 
pulpwood growth in the catchment area, and this lack of an identifiable relationship is confirmed by 
correlation analysis, which found no correlation (correlation coefficient=-0.05) between total hardwood 
pulpwood demand and hardwood pulpwood growth from 2005-2018. However, a direct relationship does 
appear present between hardwood biomass demand, specifically, and annual hardwood pulpwood 
growth. Correlation analysis confirmed this relationship, identifying a strong positive correlation 
(correlation coefficient=0.92) between these two sets of variables from 2005-2018.  
We’d like to note that these results do not indicate that increases in pulpwood/biomass demand have 
caused increases in annual growth of pulpwood in the catchment area. These strong positive correlations 
appear to be more coincidental, not evidence of a causal relationship.

Drax – April 2020 
US Forest Service data shows that annual growth of both pine and hardwood pulpwood held relatively 
steady from 2005-2010, after which annual growth started to increase at a much more rapid pace. 
Specifically, from 2010-2018, annual growth of pine pulpwood increased 26%, compared to a 20% 
increase for hardwood pulpwood. 
Evidence suggests that these increases in annual timber growth are more directly linked to increased 
inventory levels – from increased timberland area as well as from persistent oversupply (growth in excess 
of removals). Specifically, annual growth of both pine and hardwood pulpwood were found to have a 
strong positive correlation to pine pulpwood inventory (correlation coefficient=0.92) and hardwood 
pulpwood inventory (correlation coefficient=0.96), respectively, from 2005-2018.

5.1.6  Changes in Annual Removals 
According to the US Forest Service, timber removals totaled 24.3 million m3 in 2000, steadily increasing 
over the next five years and peaking at approximately 26.0 million m3 in 2005. Total removals proceeded 
to decline 30% over the nine years that followed, bottoming out at 18.1 million m3 in 2014. However, 
total removals increased 9% over the four years that followed, to an estimated 19.8 million m3 in 2018. 
In terms of historical context, total annual removals averaged an estimated 24.6 million m3 per year 
through the 2000s. In comparison, total annual removals have averaged 19.2 million m3 per year in the 
2010s (2010-2018), which was down approximately 22% compared to the average level of removals in 
the 2000s.    
See Table 36 below for a breakdown of annual removal estimates by major timber product in the Enviva 
Chesapeake catchment area from 2000 through 2018.

increased since that time and in 2018 totaled a combined 10.7 million m3, up 15% compared to 2014 
levels. On the other hand, hardwood sawtimber removals declined 48% from a peak of 8.1 million m3 in 
2005 to 4.2 million m3 in 2013. Removals of hardwood sawtimber have held relatively steady since, 
declining only slightly and averaging 3.9 million m3 per year since 2013. 
Annual removals of pine pulpwood held relatively steady and averaged 3.3 million m3 per year from 2002-
2010. However, since 2010, pine pulpwood removals have steadily increased at an average rate of 2.5% 
per year, to 3.7 million m3 in 2018. Removals of hardwood pulpwood, the other major bioenergy 
feedstock, peaked in 2006 at an estimated 2.6 million m3 before falling 42% over the seven years that 
followed, to 1.5 million m3 in 2013. Note that this decrease can be linked to both mill closures and 
weakening pulp/paper markets over this period. However, since 2013, hardwood pulpwood removals 
have increased 17%, to an estimated 1.7 million m3 in 2018.

5.1.6.1  Growth-to-Removals Ratios 
Recall that growth-to-removals analysis compares annual timber growth to annual harvests and provides 
a measure of market demand relative to supply. A growth-to-removals ratio of 1.0 indicates a balanced 
market where growth equals removals. A value of >1 indicates growth exceeds removals, signifying 
sustainable harvest levels (as well as oversupply). A value of <1 indicates removals (or harvest levels) 
exceed growth, signifying more highly competitive market conditions and harvest levels that are 
unsustainable over the long term. 
According to US Forest Service data, growth-to-removals ratios for pine and hardwood pulpwood, the 
two primary bioenergy feedstocks, have both remained well above 1.0 in the catchment area since 2005, 
indicating that harvest levels have remained well below the sustainable yield capacity of the forest area. 
Growth-to-removals ratios have also remained above 1.0 for pine chip-n-saw since 2005.  
Unsustainable harvest levels had persisted in the catchment area for both pine and hardwood sawtimber, 
as growth-to-removals ratios fell below 1.0 from 2005-2013 for pine sawtimber and from 2005-2010 for 
hardwood sawtimber. However, reduced harvest levels through much of the 2010s allowed inventories to 
replenish, and since 2014, harvest levels have remained below the sustainable yield capacity of the forest 
area.

Correlation Analysis:  Biomass Demand vs. Timber Removals 
Figure 46 provides a side-by-side comparison of biomass demand and total pulpwood demand versus 
pulpwood removals in the catchment area from 2000-2018. Since pulpwood removals should be 
representative of pulpwood demand, we’d expected these two to be very strongly (positively) correlated, 
and that’s exactly what this figure shows. Statistical analysis confirms this relationship, identifying a 
strong positive correlation (correlation coefficient=0.77) between softwood pulpwood demand and pine 
pulpwood removals in the catchment area over this period.   
Note, however, that statistical analysis identified only a weak positive relationship between hardwood 
pulpwood demand and hardwood pulpwood removals (correlation coefficient=0.35). This is primarily due 
to the assumed hardwood pulpwood product specifications (5.0-10.0 inches DBH), as hardwood logs 
larger than this in diameter may be consumed and utilized as hardwood pulpwood. A more accurate 
comparison is total hardwood demand versus total hardwood removals, which statistical analysis found 
to be highly positively correlated (correlation coefficient=0.90).

5.1.7  Changes in Raw Material Costs 
Historically, raw material purchases at Enviva Pellets Ahoskie, Enviva Pellets Northampton, and Enviva 
Pellets Southampton have included a combination of pulpwood (roundwood), pulp quality chips, and 
sawmill residuals. However, in this section, pine and hardwood sawtimber prices are also examined to 
assess how these prices have changed and trended in the catchment area since 2000.  
Note that all prices, expressed in US dollars (USD) per short ton, have been provided by TimberMart-
South and unless otherwise stated are specific to the Enviva Chesapeake catchment area. Also, these 
historic quarterly raw material prices can be found in tabular form in Appendix A. 
 
5.1.7.1  Stumpage Prices 
Trends/changes with nominal stumpage prices in the catchment area since 2000 are as follows: 
 Pine Sawtimber Stumpage. Pine sawtimber stumpage prices held relatively steady and averaged 
nearly $39 per ton from 1Q 2000-2Q 2006. However, after peaking at $43.31 per ton in 2Q 2006, 
pine sawtimber prices proceeded to decline nearly 50% over the five years that followed, 
bottoming out at $22.60 per ton in 3Q 2011. Prices rebounded modestly over the next two years 
but since 2013 have held more-or-less flat and averaged just over $27 per ton.  
 Pine Chip-n-saw Stumpage. Pine chip-n-saw stumpage prices have followed a trend very similar to 
that of pine sawtimber stumpage, holding steady from 2000-2006 ($23.92 per ton average) 
before declining 43% over the five years that followed – and bottoming out $14.78 per ton in 4Q 
2011. Pine chip-n-saw prices have improved modestly over the two years that followed but since 
2013 have held relatively steady and averaged $18.44 per ton.  
 Pine Pulpwood Stumpage. Pine pulpwood stumpage prices held steady through the 2000s and 
early 2010s, averaging $7.70 per ton from 1Q 2000 through 3Q 2012. However, prices proceeded 
to increase 70% over the next four years, peaking at $15.28 per ton in 2Q 2016. Pine pulpwood 
stumpage prices have come down slightly since but have averaged $13.31 per ton since 1Q 2017.  
 Hardwood Sawtimber Stumpage. Hardwood sawtimber stumpage prices held steady and averaged 
$20.24 per ton from 1Q 2000 through 2Q 2012. However, prices increased more than 80% over 
the 11 quarters that followed, peaking at $33.16 per ton in 2Q 2015. Hardwood sawtimber prices 
have come down slightly but have held relatively steady and averaged greater than $29 per ton 
since.  
 Hardwood Pulpwood Stumpage. Hardwood pulpwood stumpage prices steadily increased through 
the 2000s and early 2010s, increasing at an average rate of 4.1% per year from $2.79 per ton in 
1Q 2000 to $4.88 per ton in 4Q 2013. Prices increased 34% the following quarter and from 1Q 
2015 through 1Q 2016 averaged $6.81 per ton. However, hardwood pulpwood prices fell to 
$5.30 per ton in 2Q 2016 and proceeded to hold steady and average roughly $4.40 per ton 
through 2Q 2018. Prices started to rebound in the second half of 2018 and in 2019 averaged 
$6.50 per ton, up nearly 50% from 2016-2018 levels.

5.1.7.2  Delivered Sawtimber Prices 
Delivered prices are those paid for timber delivered to the mill. These prices include stumpage (standing 
timber) price plus any costs associated with cutting, loading, and hauling timber to the mill.  
Trends/changes with nominal delivered sawtimber prices in the catchment area since 2000 are as follows: 
 Delivered Pine Sawtimber. Delivered pine sawtimber prices experienced a bit of volatility through 
the early to mid-2000s before ultimately peaking in 1Q 2007 at nearly $59 per ton. However, 
prices fell 29% over the nine quarters that followed, to below $42 per ton in 2Q 2009. Prices have 
held relatively steady and trended slightly upwards since that time, increasing at an average 
annual rate of 1.5% to over $49 per ton in 2019.  
 Delivered Pine Chip-n-saw. Delivered pine chip-n-saw prices also experienced some volatility in the 
early to mid-2000s but ultimately averaged nearly $40 per ton from 2000-2006. Prices proceeded 
to fall 18% over the five years that followed, bottoming out at just over $33 per ton in 4Q 2011. 
However, delivered pine chip-n-saw prices rebounded over the next three years and have 
averaged nearly $39 per ton since 4Q 2014 (and averaging more than $40 per ton in 2019).  
 Delivered Hardwood Sawtimber. Delivered hardwood sawtimber prices steadily increased from 
$31.45 per ton in 1Q 2000 to $36.50 per ton in 2Q 2012, increasing at an average rate of 1.2% 
per year over this more than 12-year period. However, prices proceeded to increase 54% over 
the three years that followed, peaking at more than $56 per ton in 2Q 2015. Delivered hardwood 
sawtimber prices have come down slightly since, stabilizing and averaging nearly $51 per ton 
since 1Q 2016.

5.1.7.3  Delivered Pulpwood Prices 
Prices for delivered pine and hardwood pulpwood closely tracked one another from 2000-2015, with pine 
pulpwood averaging a 15% premium over hardwood pulpwood over this period. However, beginning in 
2016, prices started to diverge, as delivered pine pulpwood prices held steady while delivered hardwood 
pulpwood prices started to fall. Delivered hardwood pulpwood prices rebounded in late 2018 and since 
that time have more closely tracked those of delivered pine pulpwood, albeit at a lower level.  
Trends/changes with nominal delivered pulpwood prices since 2000 are as follows: 
 Delivered Pine Pulpwood. Delivered pine pulpwood prices steadily increased at an average rate of 
0.7% per year from $23.75 per ton in 1Q 2000 to $25.76 per ton in 1Q 2012. However, prices 
proceeded to increase 34% over the 10 quarters that followed, to $34.43 per ton in 3Q 2014. 
Delivered pine pulpwood prices have held steady since, averaging just over $33 per ton for the 
last five-plus years.  
 Delivered Hardwood Pulpwood. Like with pine pulpwood, delivered hardwood pulpwood prices 
steadily increased through the 2000s and early 2010s, increasing at an average rate of 1.0% per 
year from $19.86 per ton in 1Q 2000 to $22.67 per ton in 1Q 2013. Prices started to increase 
rapidly thereafter and by 4Q 2014 had reached $29.46 per ton – a 30% increase in less than two 
years. However, delivered hardwood pulpwood prices proceeded to fall 24% over the next 14 
quarters, bottoming out at $22.43 per ton in 2Q 2018. Prices started to rebound in the second 
half of 2018 and in 2019 averaged $26.91 per ton, up 20% from 2Q 2018 levels.

5.1.7.4  Pulp Quality Chip & Sawmill Residual Prices 
Pulpwood quality chips (FOB point of production) include both pine and hardwood sawmill chips (sawmill 
residuals) and pine and hardwood chip mill chips. Trends/changes with nominal chip and sawmill residual 
prices since 2000 are as follows: 
 Pine Sawmill Chips (Sawmill Residuals). Pine sawmill chip prices declined in the early 2000s and 
reached as low as $18.76 per ton in 2Q 2002. However, prices proceeded to increase 60% (+7% 
per year average) over the next seven years, to $29.94 per ton in 1Q 2009. Pine sawmill chip 
prices fell rapidly through the remainder of 2009 and by 1Q 2010 had fallen to $22.68 per ton, or 
a 24% decrease is just a 1-year period. Prices then resumed to increase at an average rate of 5.6% 
per year over the five years that followed, to $30.43 per ton in 2Q 2015. Pine sawmill chip prices 
have since stabilized and averaged just over $30 per ton over the last 19 quarters.  
 Pine Chip Mill Chips. Pine chip mill chip prices steadily increased at an average rate of 4.0% per 
year from $23.88 per ton in 2Q 2002 to $39.22 per ton in 4Q 2014. Prices have come down 
slightly since but have held relatively steady and averaged $37.69 per ton over the last five years. 
Note that pine chip mill chip prices have remained above those of pine sawmill chips since 2000. 
Specifically, pine chip mill chip prices have averaged a roughly 30% premium over pine sawmill 
chip prices since 2000.   
 Hardwood Sawmill Chips (Sawmill Residuals). Prices for hardwood sawmill chips increased at an 
average rate of 2.1% per year from the 20-year low of $18.25 per ton in 2Q 2002 to $23.27 per 
ton in 1Q 2014. Prices increased 30% over the seven quarters that followed, to $30.34 per ton in 
4Q 2015. However, hardwood sawmill chip prices fell 14% from 3Q 2016 to 4Q 2016 and over the 
two years that followed averaged $25.38 per ton. Prices have rebounded a bit since and in 2019 
averaged $28.44 per ton.  
 Hardwood Chip Mill Chips. Prices for hardwood chip mill chips have trended similarly to those of 
hardwood sawmills chips. Specifically, prices increased at an average rate of 2.8% per year from 
$25.50 per ton in 1Q 2001 to $37.22 per ton in 4Q 2014. However, hardwood chip mill chip prices 
started to decline shortly thereafter and by 4Q 2016 had fallen to $33.33 per ton. Prices held 
steady and averaged approximately $33 per ton over the two years that followed before 
rebounding and averaging more than $36 per ton in 2019.  
Note that prices of hardwood chip mill chips have historically remained above those of hardwood 
sawmill chips, with hardwood chip mill chip prices averaging a 34% premium over hardwood 
sawmill chip prices since 2000. 
 
In addition, we’d like to note that pine prices have historically been higher than hardwood prices, 
with pine sawmill and chip mill chip prices averaging a 6% and 3% premium, respectively, over 
hardwood sawmill and chip mill chip prices since 2000. However, these premiums have averaged 10% 
and 8%, respectively, since 2012.

Correlation Analysis:  Biomass Demand vs. Raw Material Costs 
Historically, raw material purchases at Enviva Pellets Ahoskie, Enviva Pellets Northampton, and Enviva 
Pellets Southampton have included a combination of softwood and hardwood pulpwood (roundwood), 
pulp quality chips, and sawmill residuals. Specifically, softwood species have constituted 13% of all raw 
materials consumed by these mills since 2012, compared to 87% hardwood species. 
Figure 52 provides a side-by-side comparison of softwood biomass demand and total softwood pulpwood 
demand versus delivered pine pulpwood, pine sawmill chip, and pine chip mill chip prices in the 
catchment area from 2000-2019. Intuitively, we’d expect to see prices and demand moving in the same 
direction, and that’s what we see in this figure, particularly since around 2008. 
Correlation analysis confirms these direct relationships, identifying strong positive correlations between 
softwood pulpwood demand and delivered pine pulpwood prices (correlation coefficient=0.83), pine 
sawmill chip prices (correlation coefficient=0.73), and pine chip mill chip prices (correlation 
coefficient=0.69). The same strong positive correlations are also found between softwood biomass 
demand and these raw material prices.

Hardwood Pulpwood & Hardwood Chip Prices 
Figure 53 provides a side-by-side comparison of hardwood pulpwood demand and hardwood raw 
material costs in the catchment area since 2000. Looking at this figure, raw material costs have tracked 
demand fairly closely since around 2010. However, prior to that, the relationships appear much weaker. 
Statistical analysis confirms what we see, identifying only weak positive correlations between hardwood 
pulpwood demand and hardwood raw material costs from 2000-2019. However, analysis of both of 
hardwood biomass demand and non-biomass hardwood pulpwood demand versus hardwood raw 
material costs provides much greater insight. 
Specifically, correlation analysis identified strong positive correlations between hardwood biomass 
demand and delivered hardwood pulpwood prices (correlation coefficient=0.81), hardwood sawmill chip 
prices (correlation coefficient=0.74), and hardwood chip mill chip prices (correlation coefficient=0.68) 
from 2000-2019. Conversely, moderately strong negative correlations were found between other 
hardwood pulpwood demand and delivered hardwood pulpwood prices (correlation coefficient=-0.66), 
hardwood sawmill chip prices (correlation coefficient=-0.64), and hardwood chip mill chip prices 
(correlation coefficient=-0.61) over this same period. See Table 41. However, these results are heavily 
influenced by the lack of hardwood biomass-related wood demand from 2000-2007 (and marginal levels 
of hardwood biomass demand from 2008-2011).

Drax – April 2020 
Results of the statistical analysis are quite different when we examine demand and raw material prices 
from 2013 (the first year all three Enviva pellet mills were operating) through 2019. Specifically, 
correlation analysis identified only weak positive correlations between delivered hardwood pulpwood 
price and both hardwood biomass demand (correlation coefficient=0.37) and other hardwood pulpwood 
demand (correlation coefficient=0.36) from 2013-2019. Similar results were found between hardwood 
chip mill chip prices and both hardwood biomass and other hardwood pulpwood demand over this same 
period (see Table 42). However, moderately strong to strong correlations were found between total 
hardwood pulpwood demand and both delivered hardwood pulpwood price (correlation 
coefficient=0.75) and hardwood chip mill chip price (correlation coefficient=0.55) from 2013-2019. 
Ultimately, the significant increase in hardwood raw material costs from 2012 through 2014 coincided 
with a substantial increase in hardwood biomass demand (attributed to the startup Enviva’s three pellet 
mills), and the link between the two appears obvious. However, further evidence suggests that changes in 
hardwood prices since 2012 are linked to changes in total hardwood pulpwood demand, not demand 
attributed to bioenergy alone. Furthermore, the results of this analysis taken together with our 
understanding of the laws of supply and demand are suggestive of a causal relationship. That is, increases 
(decreases) in hardwood pulpwood demand, to some degree, are responsible for increases (decreases) in 
hardwood raw material costs in the Enviva Chesapeake catchment area.

Sawtimber Prices 
Pine and hardwood sawtimber prices were also examined to assess the impact biomass demand has had 
on markets for other solid wood products. Specifically, Figure 54 provides a side-by-side comparison of 
biomass demand versus delivered pine sawtimber, pine chip-n-saw, and hardwood sawtimber prices in 
the catchment area from 2000-2019.  
Looking at this figure, no discernable relationship is apparent between biomass demand and both 
delivered pine sawtimber prices and delivered pine chip-n-saw prices. However, delivered hardwood 
sawtimber prices have closely tracked biomass demand, particularly since 2012. Correlation analysis 
confirms what we see in Figure 54, identifying no (or a weak negative) correlation between biomass 
demand and both delivered pine sawtimber prices (correlation coefficient=-0.39) and delivered pine chip-
n-saw prices (correlation coefficient=0.07). However, a strong positive correlation was identified between 
biomass demand and delivered hardwood sawtimber prices (correlation coefficient=0.95). 
Note that the strong positive correlation found between biomass demand and delivered hardwood 
sawtimber prices appears much more coincidental in nature, not indicative of a causal relationship. 
Increases in hardwood sawtimber prices have occurred across the US South since 2013, and these price 
increases are largely due to increases in both domestic consumption of hardwood products and foreign 
demand of US hardwood logs and lumber.

5.2  Market Outlook: 2020-2022 
There have been several announcements related to mill openings and closings in the Enviva Chesapeake 
catchment area that stand to impact this market moving forward. These include: 
 Active Energy Group (AEG) announced in the 4th Quarter of 2019 the startup of its softwood lumber mill at 
its facility in Lumberton NC. The sawmill is a joint venture with Renewable Logistics Systems LLC and will 
manufacture railroad ties as well as wood chips for other operations. Annual production capacity has not 
been disclosed. 
The company also nears completion of its CoalSwitch biomass plant, which the company expects to be fully 
operational in early 2020. This facility will utilize residuals and other wood residues in combination with 
other feedstock options (e.g. chicken litter and miscanthus grass) for production of its black pellets and 
other CoalSwitch products.  
The AEG Lumberton facility is located approximately 260 kilometers southwest of Enviva Pellets 
Northampton in Robeson County, North Carolina. Given the facility’s location, only a marginal amount of 
additional wood demand is expected to be placed on the Enviva Chesapeake catchment area due to these 
startups.    
 Cascades Inc. announced plans to invest $275 million to convert the Bear Island VA facility it purchased 
from White Birch Paper in 2018 to recycled linerboard production by the end of 2021. Once the conversion 
is complete, the facility is expected to have a production capacity of 360,000 metric tons per year of 
recycled linerboard.  
The Bear Island facility is located approximately 160 kilometers north of Enviva Pellets Southampton in 
Hanover County, Virginia. The mill will primarily utilize recycled containerboard to produce its linerboard. 
Given this and the facility’s location, we anticipate no significant increase in wood demand placed on the 
Enviva Chesapeake catchment area as a result of the conversion.   
 Enviva announced in mid-2019 that the expansion projects at its Northampton NC and Southampton VA 
pellet facilities were underway and expected to be completed in the first half of 2020. The two expansion 
projects are expected to increase combined pellet capacity at these two facilities by 400,000 metric tons 
per year. In addition, the environmental permit received from the Virginia Department of Environmental 
Quality on November 20th, 2019, allows for the increased consumption of pine (softwood) at the 
Southampton facility.  
The increased production associated with these expansion projects are expected to add 800,000 metric 
tons per year of additional roundwood demand on the Enviva Chesapeake catchment area.  
 Teal-Jones announced plans to invest more than $31 million to expand production and dry kiln capacity at 
its two southern pine sawmills located in Kinsale VA and Martinsville VA. The two mills currently have a 
combined production capacity of 125 million bf of lumber per year. The company has yet to disclose 
anticipated production capacity following the investment.  
The Kinsale facility is located approximately 225 kilometers north of Enviva Pellets Southampton in 
Westmoreland County, Virginia. The Martinsville facility is located approximately 240 kilometers west of 
Enviva Pellets Northampton in Henry County, Virginia. The increased production associated with these 
expansion projects are expected to add 10,000-25,000 metric tons per year of additional roundwood 
demand on the Enviva Chesapeake catchment area.

5.2.1  Wood Demand Outlook 
Based on the announcements highlighted on the previous page and other expected production changes, 
we anticipate total wood demand in the Enviva Chesapeake catchment area to increase an estimated 
4.1% from 2019 to 2022, due in large part to Enviva’s expansion projects at its Northampton NC and 
Southampton VA pellet mills.  
Demand for softwood and hardwood sawlogs is forecasted to increase a combined 1.8% from 2019-2022, 
compared to an 10% increase in softwood and hardwood pulpwood demand over this same period. 
Specifically, with Enviva’s anticipated production increases, biomass-related wood demand is projected to 
increase 32% from less than 2.3 million metric tons in 2019 to 3.0 million metric tons in 2022. Softwood 
and hardwood biomass demand are forecasted to increase 120% and 13%, respectively, over this period.

5.2.2  Raw Material Price Outlook 
Raw material purchases for Enviva Pellets Ahoskie, Enviva Pellets Northampton, and Enviva Pellets 
Southampton have historically included a mix of both pine and hardwood pulpwood (roundwood), chips, 
and sawmill residuals. Specifically, roundwood constituted 36% of the total raw material purchases for 
these three mills in 2019, compared to 51% chips and 13% other wood residues (e.g. sawdust, shavings, 
and bark).  
In 2019, pine (softwood) constituted only 25% of Enviva’s total wood purchases. However, with the 
expansion projects at Enviva’s Northampton and Southampton pellet mills, that species mix is projected 
to increase to 30% pine versus 70% hardwood by 2022.  
Since pine pulpwood (roundwood) and pine chips are expected to account for a majority of the pine 
purchases for these three mills over the next several years, our pine price forecasts focus specifically on 
delivered pine pulpwood, pine sawmill chips, and pine chip mill chips. Forecasts include: 
 Delivered Pine Pulpwood. Based on our analysis of raw material prices in the catchment area, 
including anticipated changes in biomass demand and total softwood pulpwood demand moving 
forward, we forecast a 9% increase in delivered pine pulpwood prices from 2019 through 2022. 
Overall, delivered pine pulpwood prices are forecasted to average $34.89 per ton from 2020-2022, up 
6% (+$2.07 per ton) from the 2019 average of $32.82 per ton. 
 Pine Sawmill Chips. Pine sawmill chip prices are forecasted to increase more than 6% from $30.28 per 
ton in 2019 to $32.25 per ton in 2022. Overall, pine sawmill chip prices are forecasted to average 
$31.70 per ton from 2020-2022, up 5% (+$1.42 per ton) from the 2019 average. 
 Pine Chip Mill Chips. Pine chip mill chip prices are forecasted to increase 7% from $37.49 per ton in 
2019 to $40.10 per ton in 2022. Overall, pine chip mill chip prices are forecasted to average $39.38 
per ton from 2020-2022, up 5% (+$1.89 per ton) from the 2019 average.

Drax – April 2020 
Similarly, hardwood raw material purchases for these three Enviva pellet mills have historically included a 
combination of hardwood pulpwood (roundwood), chips, and other residuals. Specifically, our hardwood 
price forecasts focus specifically on hardwood pulpwood and hardwood chips, which are expected to 
continue to account for a majority of the hardwood purchases for these three mills over the next several 
years. Forecasts include:  
 Delivered Hardwood Pulpwood. Based on our analysis of raw material prices in the catchment area, 
including anticipated changes in biomass demand and total hardwood pulpwood demand moving 
forward, we forecast delivered hardwood pulpwood prices to increase 5% from $26.91 per ton in 
2019 to $28.30 per ton in 2022. Overall, delivered hardwood pulpwood prices are forecasted to 
average $27.71 per ton from 2020-2022, up 3% (+$0.93 per ton) from the 2019 average. 
 Hardwood Sawmill Chips. Hardwood sawmill chip prices are forecasted to increase more than 5% 
from $28.44 per ton in 2019 to $29.82 per ton in 2022. Overall, hardwood sawmill chip prices are 
forecasted to average $29.32 per ton from 2020-2022, up 3% (+$0.88 per ton) from the 2019 average. 
 Hardwood Chip Mill Chips. Hardwood chip mill chip prices are forecasted to increase 4% from $36.09 
per ton in 2019 to $37.51 per ton in 2022. Overall, hardwood chip mill chip prices are forecasted to 
average $36.94 per ton from 2020-2022, up 2% (+$0.86 per ton) from the 2019 average.

Table 48 provides a cost index (2019=100) that shows Enviva’s historic and forecasted per unit raw 
material costs from 2012 through 2022. These index values are based on Enviva’s specific species and 
product mix, as well as the respective product price, are intended to show how average per unit raw 
material costs have changed and are projected to change for Enviva over the next several years. Note that 
these index calculations are not based on actual raw material costs incurred by Enviva, but rather average 
market prices for the Enviva Chesapeake catchment area.  
Average per unit costs for Enviva’s three pellet mills increased an estimated 29% from 2012-2019, or an 
average increase of 3.7% per year over this period. However, based on our forecasts and anticipated 
changes in species and product mix consumption, average per unit raw material costs for Enviva are 
projected to increase an average of 2.3% per year through 2022, or a total of 7% from 2019-2022.

6. Analysis Summary & Findings 
Provided below and on the following pages is Hood Consulting’s overall analysis summary, including a 
synopsis of key report elements and analysis findings. Please note that any conclusions drawn by Hood 
Consulting are based on a thorough assessment of the Enviva Chesapeake catchment area and on our 
professional expertise and market knowledge. 
 
 Changes in Forest Area 
According to US Forest Service (USFS) data, timberland in the Enviva Chesapeake catchment area 
increased 31,200 hectares (+0.7%) from 2000-2018. However, this increase primarily took place 
post-2010. Specifically, timberland in the catchment area decreased 57,696 hectares from 2000-
2010. However, from 2010-2018, timberland increased an estimated 88,896 hectares, or a 1.9% 
increase over this 8-year period. 
The composition of timberland in the catchment area has also undergone changes. Specifically, 
since Enviva commenced production at its Ahoskie pellet mill in 2012, naturally regenerated and 
planted pine timberland has increased a combined 115,480 hectares (+5.6%); naturally 
regenerated hardwood timberland, mixed pine-hardwood timberland, and planted hardwood 
timberland has decreased a combined 32,662 hectares (-1.3%).  
The net increase in total timberland area – considering pine timberland hectares increased but 
both hardwood and mixed pine-hardwood timberland hectares decreased – to us indicates three 
things. First, land not formerly classified as timberland has been converted to timberland. 
Second, much of the non-pine timberland that has been harvested in this catchment area has 
been reestablished in pine. And third, harvested pine timberland continues to be replanted in 
pine. 
A major topic of interest specific to this area has been the loss of bottomland hardwood 
timberland. According to the USFS, total hardwood timberland decreased an estimated 14,470 
hectares (-0.7%) from 2012-2018. However, this was due to losses of upland/flatwood hardwood 
timberland, not losses of bottomland hardwood timberland. Specifically, upland/flatwood 
hardwood timberland decreased an estimated 61,653 hectares (-4.3%) from 2012-2018. 
Bottomland hardwood timberland increased 47,183 hectares (+8.2%) over this period. 
Ultimately, the increases in timberland, particularly pine timberland, in the catchment area 
provide great indication that adequate supply will be available for the anticipated future increase 
in softwood (pine) consumption by Enviva. However, given that Enviva’s product mix is expected 
to be around 70-75% hardwoods versus 25-30% softwoods over the next several years, continued 
supply from hardwood and mixed pine-hardwood timberland will remain important for Enviva. 
Since 2012, natural hardwood and mixed pine-hardwood timberland area has held relatively 
steady in the catchment area, so adequate supply is expected to remain (at least over the short 
to mid-term).

Drax – April 2020 
 Changes in Timber Inventory, Growth, & Removals 
Total timber inventory in the catchment area increased 11% (+0.9% per year average) from 2000-
2012. However, since 2012, inventory levels have risen at a more accelerated rate, increasing 
19% from 2012-2018, or an average of +2.9% per year over this period. Specifically, inventories of 
pine pulpwood and hardwood pulpwood both increased 14% from 2012-2018, or an average of 
+2.2% per year over this period.  
The increase in timber inventory reflected trends in both growth and removals. Specifically, 
annual growth of total growing stock timber increased 24% (+3.7% per year) from 2012-2018, 
compared to an increase of only 3% (+0.4% per year) in annual removals over this period.  
Another way to gauge long-term resource availability and market sustainability is to examine 
growth-to-removal ratios. In this catchment area, total growth-to-removals has remained well 
above 1.0, increasing rapidly through the mid to late-2010s and peaking at 1.84 in 2016. This ratio 
has come down only slightly since and equaled 1.81 in 2018. (Recall that a value of >1 indicates 
growth exceeds removals, signifying oversupply). Growth-to-removals ratios of both pine and 
hardwood pulpwood have remained between 2.0 and 3.0 since Enviva entered this market in 
2012, with pine pulpwood and hardwood pulpwood growth-to-removals equaling 2.49 and 2.76, 
respectively, in 2018 – indicating that annual growth is 2-3x that of annual removals for both of 
these timber products. 
For Enviva’s three pellet mills, this indicates, first, that current harvest levels (demand) are 
sustainable, and second, that both softwood and hardwood pulpwood demand (including 
biomass-related wood demand) can increase much further without jeopardizing the long-term 
sustainability of this market.  
 
 Changes in Wood Demand 
Total wood demand in the Enviva Chesapeake catchment area increased an estimated 17% from 
2011 (the year prior to Enviva’s entrance in this market) through 2019, with softwood and 
hardwood pulpwood demand both increasing an estimated 27% over this period.  
Note that the increases in both softwood and hardwood pulpwood demand were largely 
attributed to Enviva, which accounted for 0% of total pulpwood demand in the catchment area in 
2011, compared to an estimated 34% in 2019. And with the expansions of both Enviva Pellets 
Northampton and Enviva Pellets Southampton, total pulpwood demand attributed to Enviva is 
projected to increase to over 40% in 2022. 
For Enviva, the increased wood demand that will be placed on this catchment area could likely 
lead to higher raw material costs – as the company may be forced to increase the price they’re 
willing to pay for raw materials to secure adequate wood to meet their production needs. 
However, given the current imbalance in supply and demand in this market, the impact of 
increased demand on raw material prices will likely be far smaller than would be expected under 
balanced conditions.

Drax – April 2020 
 Changes in Raw Material Prices 
Raw material purchases for Enviva Pellets Ahoskie, Enviva Pellets Northampton, and Enviva 
Pellets Southampton include a combination of pine and hardwood pulpwood (roundwood), chips, 
sawmill residuals, and other wood residues – with hardwood pulpwood and hardwood chips 
accounting for approximately 75% of total wood purchases by these three mills from 2012-2019. 
Pine pulpwood and pine chips accounted for roughly 11% of total wood purchases over this same 
period. However, with the expansions and increased ability to utilize softwood (pine) beginning in 
2020, consumption of pine pulpwood and pine chips is expected to increase significantly over the 
next several years. 
Delivered hardwood pulpwood prices in the catchment area trended upwards from 2000-2014, 
increasing an average of 2.5% per year over this period. However, since 2014, delivered 
hardwood pulpwood prices have been a bit more volatile but trended relatively flat to slightly 
downwards overall. Hardwood sawmill and chip mill chip prices have followed a similar trend. 
Prices of both raw materials increased an average of approximately 1.8% per year from 2000 
through the mid-2010s but trending flat overall the last 3-4 years.  
Delivered pine pulpwood prices in the catchment area increased only modestly from 2000-2011, 
increasing 9% (+0.8% per year average) over this 11-year period. Prices proceeded to increase 
28% from 2011-2014; however, since then, delivered pine pulpwood prices have held flat, with 
annual average prices fluctuating only ±$0.24 per ton the last five years. Similarly, pine sawmill 
chip prices increased only 7% (+0.6% per year average) from 2000-2012 and then proceeded to 
increase 25% over the three years that followed. However, since 2015, pine sawmill chip prices 
have held flat. Pine chip mill chip prices declined 19% from 2000-2002 but proceeded to increase 
57% (+3.8% per year average) over the 12 years that followed. However, since 2014, pine chip 
mill chip prices have held relatively flat, decreasing only slightly over the last five years.  
Prices for all these different raw materials are forecasted to increase slightly over the next several 
years, with delivered hardwood pulpwood and hardwood chip prices forecasted to increase 4-5% 
and delivered pine pulpwood and pine chips prices forecasted to increase 6-8% from 2019-2022. 
However, the outlook for Enviva’s three mills in terms of raw material costs is positive given the 
anticipated increases in wood purchases and changes in product mix. With pine expected to 
represent an increasing percentage of total raw material purchases moving forward, average per 
unit raw material costs are forecasted to increase an average of only 2.3% per year over the next 
three years, down from the estimated +3.7% per year average incurred from 2012-2019. 
 
 Management/Harvest Trends 
As part of this market analysis, Hood Consulting examined management practices to see how 
harvesting activities have changed since in this market since 2000. Specifically, we wanted to 
assess how harvest activities change when market conditions weaken versus when market 
conditions are stable or strong.  
TimberMart-South data shows that thinnings increased when poor market conditions persisted in 
the late 2000s and early 2010s. Specifically, hectares thinned as a percentage of total hectares 
harvested (thinned or clearcut) averaged between 35-40% in the early 2000s (when market 
C  A  T  C  H  M  E  N  T     A  R  E  A     A  N  A  L  Y  S  I  S    –    E  N  V  I  V  A     P  E  L  L  E  T  S

conditions were strong) and in the latter half of the 2010s (when market conditions were what 
we would consider stable). However, from 2007-2011, that percentage increased significantly, as 
thinned hectares accounted for 69% of the total hectares harvested over this period. Similarly, 
harvest volume attributed to thinnings as a percentage of total harvest volume held between 
roughly 20-25% from 2000-2006 and from 2013-2019. However, from 2007-2011, approximately 
50% of the total reported harvest volume was from thinnings. 
Ultimately, our assessment shows that this market’s response to poor market conditions is to 
decrease clearcuts and increase thinnings. The data suggests that many landowners in this 
market opted to thin when markets weakened, presumably waiting until timber prices improved 
before proceeding with the clearcut of mature timber stands. As markets conditions settled and 
stabilized in the early 2010s, many landowners in this market reverted to more standard 
management practices, deciding to clearcut, not thin, mature timber stands.   
 
 Impact of Biomass Demand on Raw Material Prices 
One of the important components of this analysis was to identify any relationships or linkages 
between changes in biomass demand and changes in raw material prices. Intuitively, prices and 
demand should move in the same direction, and that’s exactly what the data shows in this 
catchment area.  
Specifically, delivered pine pulpwood and pine chip prices were found to have a strong positive 
correlation to both softwood biomass demand and other (non-biomass-related) softwood 
pulpwood demand. However, changes in pine pulpwood and pine chip prices are impacted to a 
greater degree by other softwood pulpwood demand (i.e. from pulp/paper mills), as other 
softwood pulpwood demand accounts for approximately 90% of total softwood pulpwood 
demand in the catchment area. 
Delivered hardwood pulpwood price was found to have only a weak positive correlation to both 
hardwood biomass demand and other (non-biomass-related) hardwood pulpwood demand. 
However, a strong positive correlation does exist between delivered hardwood pulpwood price 
and total hardwood pulpwood demand. Ultimately, these findings along with additional analysis 
provide evidence in support of a causal relationship between total hardwood pulpwood demand 
and hardwood pulpwood raw material costs. That is, increases (decreases) in total hardwood 
pulpwood demand, to some degree, are responsible for increases (decreases) in delivered 
hardwood pulpwood prices. However, changes in hardwood biomass demand alone are not 
responsible for changes in hardwood pulpwood price. 
(Note that while delivered hardwood pulpwood price increased 17% from 2013 to 2014 (coinciding with a nearly 
70% increase in hardwood biomass demand), this increase in price was also likely linked to a combination of both 
supply chain issues – a shortage of local loggers following pulp/paper mill closures in the region – and elevated 
prices offered by Enviva to ensure guaranteed wood supply the first several years of operation).  
Additionally, we examined prices of non-biomass-related timber products (i.e. pine sawtimber, 
pine chip-n-saw, and hardwood sawtimber) and found no relationships or links between changes 
in biomass demand and changes in these raw material prices.

Glossary of Terms 
Average annual mortality of growing stock: The average cubic foot volume of sound wood in growing-stock trees 
that died in one year. 
Average annual net growth of growing stock: The annual change in cubic foot volume of sound wood in live 
sawtimber and poletimber trees, and the total volume of trees entering these classes through ingrowth, less volume 
losses resulting from natural causes, between 1999 and 2003.  
Average annual removals from growing stock: The average net growing-stock volume in growing-stock trees 
removed annually for roundwood forest products, in addition to the volume of logging residues and the volume of 
other removals.  
Basal area: Tree area in square feet of the cross section at breast height of a single tree.  When the basal areas of all 
trees in a stand are summed, the result is usually expressed as square feet of basal area per acre. 
Commercial species: Tree species suitable for industrial wood products. 
County and municipal: An ownership class of public lands owned by counties or local public agencies, or lands leased 
by these governmental units for more than 50 years.  
Cropland: Land under cultivation within the last 24 months, including cropland harvested, crop failures, cultivated 
summer fallow, idle cropland used only for pasture, orchards, active Christmas tree plantations indicated by annual 
shearing, nurseries, and land in soil improvement crops, but excluding land cultivated in developing improved 
pasture. 
Diameter class: A classification of trees based on diameter outside bark, measured at breast height 4.5 feet (DBH) 
(1.37m) above the ground or at root collar (DRC). Note: Diameter classes are commonly in 2-inch (5cm) increments, 
beginning with 2-inches (5cm). Each class provides a range of values with the class name being the approximate 
mid-point. For example, the 6-inch class (15-cm class) includes trees 5.0 through 6.9 inches (12.7 cm through 17.5 
cm) DBH, inclusive. 
Federal Land: An ownership class of public lands owned by the U.S. Government.  
Forest land: Land that has at least 10 percent crown cover by live tally trees of any size or has had at least 10 
percent canopy cover of live tally species in the past, based on the presence of stumps, snags, or other evidence. To 
qualify, the area must be at least 1.0 acre in size and 120.0 feet wide. Forest land includes transition zones, such as 
areas between forest and nonforest lands that meet the minimal tree stocking/cover and forest areas adjacent to 
urban and built—up lands. Roadside, streamside, and shelterbelt strips of trees must have a width of at least 120 
feet and continuous length of at least 363 feet to qualify as forest land. Unimproved roads and trails, streams, and 
clearings in forest areas are classified as forest if they are less than 120 feet wide or less than an acre in size. Tree-
covered areas in agricultural production settings, such as fruit orchards, or tree—covered areas in urban settings, 
such as city parks, are not considered forest land.  
Forest type: A classification of forest land based upon and named for the tree species that forms the plurality of live-
tree stocking. A forest type classification for a field location indicates the predominant live-tree species cover for the 
field location; hardwoods and softwoods are the first group to be determine predominant group, and Forest Type is 
selected from the predominant group. 
Growing stock tree: All live trees 5.0 inches (12.7) cm) DBH or larger that meet (now or prospectively) regional 
merchantability requirements in terms of saw-log length, grade, and cull deductions. Excludes rough and rotten cull 
trees. 
Hardwood: Tree species belonging to the botanical subdivision Angiospermae, class Dicotyledonous, usually broad-
leaved and deciduous.  
Land: The area of dry land and land temporarily or partly covered by water, such as marshes, swamps, and river 
flood plains.

Logging residues: The unused portions of trees cut or destroyed during harvest and left in the woods.  
Merchantable: Refers to a pulpwood or sawlog section that meets pulpwood or sawlog specifications, respectively. 
National forest: An ownership class of Federal lands, designated by Executive order or statute as National Forests or 
purchase units, and other lands under the administration of the Forest Service including experimental areas. 
Net annual growth: The average annual net increase in the volume of trees during the period between 
inventories.  Components include the increment in net volume of trees at the beginning of the specific year 
surviving to its end, plus the net volume of trees reaching the minimum size class during the year, minus the volume 
of trees that died during the year, and minus the net volume of trees that became cull trees during the year.  
Net volume in cubic feet: The gross volume in cubic feet less deductions for rot, roughness, and poor form.  Volume 
is computed for the central stem from a 1-foot stump to a minimum 4.0-inch top diameter outside bark, or to the 
point where the central stem breaks into limbs. 
Nonforest land: Land that does not support or has never supported, forests and lands formerly forested where use 
of timber management is precluded by development for other uses. Includes area used for crops, improved pasture, 
residential areas, city parks, improved roads of any width and adjoining rights-of-way, powerline clearings of any 
width, and noncensus water.  If intermingled in forest areas, unimproved roads and nonforest strips must be more 
than 120 feet (36.6m) wide, and clearings, etc., more than one acre (0.4ha) in size, to qualify as nonforest land. 
Ownership: A legal entity having an ownership interest in land regardless of the number of people involved. An 
ownership may be an individual; a combination of persons; a legal entity such as corporation, partnership, club, or 
trust; or a public agency. An ownership has control of a parcel or group of parcels of land. 
Pulpwood: Roundwood, whole-tree chips, or wood residues used for the production of wood pulp.  
Roundwood products: Logs, bolts, or other round timber generated from harvesting trees for industrial or consumer 
uses. Includes sawlogs; veneer and cooperage logs and bolts; pulpwood; fuelwood; pilings; poles; posts; hewn ties; 
mine timbers; and various other round, split or hewn products. 
Saw log: A log meeting minimum standards of diameter, length, and defect, including logs at least 8 feet long, sound 
and straight, and with a minimum diameter inside bark of 6 inches for softwoods and 8 inches for hardwoods, or 
meeting other combinations of size and defect specified by regional standards.   
Sawtimber tree: A live tree of commercial species containing at least a 12-foot sawlog or two noncontiguous saw 
logs 8 feet or longer and meeting regional specifications for freedom from defect.  Softwoods must be at least 9.0 
inches d.b.h.  Hardwoods must be at least 11.0 inches diameter outside bark (d.o.b.). 
Softwood: A coniferous tree, usually evergreen, having needles or scale-like leaves.  
Stand: A group of trees on a minimum of 1 acre of forest land that is stocked by forest trees of any size.  
State land: An ownership class of public lands owned by States or lands leased by States for more than 50 years.  
Timberland: Forest land that is producing or is capable of producing crops of industrial wood and not withdrawn 
from timber utilization by statute or administrative regulation.  (Note: Areas qualifying as timberland are capable of 
producing in excess of 20 cubic feet per acre per year of industrial wood in natural stands.  Currently inaccessible 
and inoperable areas are included.)   
Timber products output (TPO): All timber products cut from roundwood and byproducts of wood manufacturing 
plants.  Roundwood products include logs, bolts, or other round sections cut from growing-stock trees, cull trees, 
salvable dead trees, trees on nonforest land, noncommercial species, sapling-size trees, and limbwood.  Byproducts 
from primary manufacturing plants include slabs, edging, trimmings, miscuts, sawdust, shavings, veneer cores and 
clippings, and screenings of pulpmills that are used as pulpwood chips or other products. 
Tree: A woody perennial plant, typically large, with a single well-defined stem carrying a more or less definite crown; 
sometimes defined as attaining a minimum diameter of 3 inches (7.6) and a minimum height of 15 ft (4.6 m) at 
maturity. For FIA, any plant on the tree list in the current field manual is measured as a tree.

Tree size class: A classification of trees based on diameter at breast height, including sawtimber trees, poletimber 
trees, saplings, and seedlings. 
Urban forest land: Land that would otherwise meet the criteria for timberland but is in an urban-suburban area 
surrounded by commercial, industrial, or residential development and not likely to be managed for the production 
of industrial wood products on a continuing basis.  Wood removed would be for land clearing, fuelwood, or esthetic 
purposes.  Such forest land may be associated with industrial, commercial, residential subdivision, industrial parks, 
golf course perimeters, airport buffer strips, and public urban parks that qualify as forest land.  
Veneer log: A roundwood product from which veneer is sliced or sawn and that usually meets certain standards of 
minimum diameter and length and maximum defect.  
Weight: The weight of wood and bark, oven-dry basis (approximately 12 percent moisture content).
