reappointed.

Independence, including the provision of non-audit services 
The Committee shall: 
• assess at least annually the independence and objectivity of the external auditors, 
taking into account relevant UK professional and regulatory requirements and the 
relationship with the auditor as a whole, including the provision of any non-audit 
services; 
• satisfy itself that there are no relationships (such as family, employment, investment, 
financial or business) between the auditor and the company (other than in the ordinary 
course of business) which could adversely affect the auditor’s independence and 
objectivity; 
• agree with the Board, and monitor the application of, a policy on the employment of 
former employees of the company's auditor; 
• monitor the auditor's processes for maintaining independence and compliance with 
relevant ethical and professional guidance on the rotation of audit partners, the level 
of fees paid by the company compared to the overall fee income of the firm, or relevant 
part of it, and other related requirements; and 
• develop and implement a policy on the provision of non-audit services by the external 
auditor, to include consideration of:

safeguards in place;

the general principle will be that no non-audit services are undertaken by the incumbent 
audit firm. Such appointment will only be permitted where the work is pre-approved in 
accordance with paragraph 5.2 of the Group’s Auditor Independence Policy, the work to 
be allocated requires a certificate or other assurance of the Company’s appointed auditor, 
the services provided relate to reporting accountant activity, or exceptional circumstances 
warrant it, and only then where the work is permitted by the Revised Ethical Standard 
(2019), the non-audit fee cap (70% of the average audit fees paid by the Group for the 
preceding three financial years) is not breached, and the Committee is satisfied the 
engagement of the audit firm is justified on merits which are clearly articulated by 
management and agreed in advance by the Committee.  
In the first instance, the Audit Committee Chair should be consulted on any proposed 
work to be undertaken, explaining the scope, rationale for the engagement of the audit 
 
 
firm, expected cost and management’s explanation of other service providers which have 
been considered. If necessary, and to the extent determined by the Audit Committee 
Chair, the work will be referred to the wider Committee before a decision is made. 
Annual audit cycle

(a) meet with the external auditor, including at the audit planning stage and at the conclusion 
of the audit, in addition to planning for and feedback on the half-year review. The 
Committee shall meet the external auditors at least twice a year without management 
being present, to discuss their remit and their perceptions of their interactions with senior 
management and other members of the finance team; 
(b) consider whether the auditors’ overall work plan, including planned levels of materiality 
and proposed resources to execute the plan, appears consistent with the scope of the 
audit engagement, having regard to the seniority, expertise and experience of the audit 
team;

The Committee shall assess the effectiveness of the audit process in the particular circumstances 
of the company. The assessment will take account in particular of the mind-set, skills and 
character of the audit team, their understanding of the company’s business, their perceptiveness 
and robustness in handling key areas of audit risk and accounting judgement, and the quality of 
their reports to the Committee and of the responses to questions from the Committee. The
