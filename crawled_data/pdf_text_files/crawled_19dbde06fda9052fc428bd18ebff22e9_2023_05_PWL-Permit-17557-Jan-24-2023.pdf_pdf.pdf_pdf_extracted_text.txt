5.2 Non-compliance Reporting  
 
 
If the permittee fails to comply with any of the requirements of this 
Authorization, the permittee must, within 30 days of such non-compliance, 
submit to the director a written report that is satisfactory to the director and 
includes, but is not necessarily limited to, the following: 
 
 
a) all relevant test results obtained by the permittee related to the non-
compliance, 
b) an explanation of the most probable cause(s) of the non-compliance, and 
c) a description of remedial action planned and/or taken by the permittee to 
prevent similar non-compliance(s) in the future. 
 
 
 
The permittee must submit all non-compliance reporting required to be 
submitted under this section by email to the Ministry’s Compliance Reporting 
Mailbox (CRM) at EnvironmentalCompliance@gov.bc.ca or as otherwise 
instructed by the director. For guidelines on how to report a non-compliance 
or for more information visit the Ministry website:

5.3 Non-compliance source testing 
 
 
If any sampling event is found to exceed the limits identified in this 
Authorization, then the permittee must immediately notify the director as per 
section 5.1 and re-test the non-compliant emission source within 30 calendar 
days of receipt of the failed test result. The director may provide additional 
direction on the timing of the follow-up tests.  
 
If the results of the re-test exceed any of the limits in Section 1, then the 
discharge from the non-compliant emission source must cease until the 
problem has been corrected, unless authorized in writing, by the director. 
Upon completion of the corrective action, the permittee may resume 
operation of the authorized works. However, a third confirmation test must be 
conducted as soon as practicable to ensure the works meet the allowable 
limits. This additional testing and verification does not grant an allowance to 
exceed the Authorization limits.
