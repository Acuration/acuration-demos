Study Objectives and Overview
The focus of this engagement has been to build a primarily 
quantitative evidence base to understand the system value of BECCS-
Power and the role of the Drax-BECCS project within this. 
Drax is considering the potential retrofit of 2 of its existing 630 MW 
biomass units with CCS1, with the first unit online from 2027. Each 
unit has the potential to deliver 4 MTpa of negative emissions. The 
project is unique as a relatively inexpensive source of negative 
emissions that can be deployed before 2030 and is an important first 
step in a wider UK BECCS programme.
We have explored the role of BECCS-Power in driving cost-optimal 
energy system outcomes for the UK Net Zero targets using three 
scenarios: Central, Downside and Upside. The latter frame conditions 
that are less or more favourable for BECCS-Power compared to other 
negative emission routes, such as BECCS-Hydrogen.
The analysis has deployed both a “whole energy systems” modelling 
lens, given the multi-sector/energy-vector nature of BECCS, as well as 
a “detailed power system” lens to explore the nuances of the specific 
role for BECCS-Power and the Drax BECCS-project.
Key assumptions have been aligned to the extent possible with key 
UK Government and Climate Change Committee (CCC) published 
sources, in particular benchmarking our results with analysis seen in 
the recent CCC 6th Carbon Budget.
Baringa has been engaged to help Drax understand the system value of Biomass with CCS (BECCS) 
both within power and whole system decarbonisation, as part of meeting the UK’s Net Zero targets
Questions the study addresses
Emissions
• To meet Net Zero is there significant demand for 
negative emissions in the energy system?
• How early do we need negative emissions?
Economics
• What is the optimal build-out and role of BECCS-
Power given competing abatement options?
• How do system costs change in the absence of 
building BECCS-Power?
Role of Drax
• What is the role and value of the Drax-project as 
part of a broader need for BECCS-Power?

Drax already plays a major role in UK decarbonisation efforts
A unique opportunity to provide negative emissions from 2027
Drax is looking to transition from its existing renewable 
biomass operations to fitting carbon capture and storage and 
producing negative emissions
– Converting existing biomass units to BECCS would secure 
the long-term future of the site
– A Carbon Payment + Power Contract for Difference (CfD) 
would underpin the necessary investment at the Selby 
site and enable capture of 8MTCO2 per year – a 
significant contribution to the 20 to 40 MTCO2 per year 
the CCC say will be required in 2050
There is currently a window of opportunity to deliver a 
crucial element of the UK’s decarbonisation infrastructure. 
Baringa has modelled the case for deploying BECCS at Drax 
from 2027 and shown that:
– Achieving the net-zero target without BECCS-Power 
would cost the UK an additional £15bn, or £17 a year for 
every household 
– Not deploying Drax in 2027 would cost the UK an 
additional £5bn and make achieving the 5th and 6th 
carbon budgets significantly harder
Conversion of the existing biomass units to BECCS is a unique opportunity to make Drax the UK’s 
first negative emissions power station from 2027
Drax: A Vital Contribution to UK Decarbonisation
Drax has already made a material contribution to the 
decarbonisation of the UK’s energy system, converting four 
of its coal power units to biomass
– Three of the biomass units are supported by a 
Renewables Obligation accreditation and the fourth by 
an Investment Contract 
– All four support mechanisms expire in 2027
Drax has a unique opportunity to make another significant 
advance towards the UK’s 2050 net-zero emissions target by 
adding carbon capture (CC) to its biomass units and 
becoming the UK’s first negative emissions power station 
from 2027
– Plans are progressing to add CC to two biomass units 
(just under 1GW). A final investment decision will be 
required in 2024 to achieve this
– The capital cost of retrofitting CC at Selby is significantly 
lower than developing a new build Bioenergy Carbon 
Capture and Storage (BECCS) facility
– As the largest CO2 capacity project on the T&S system 
Drax would significantly lower the unit cost, enabling the 
connection of other strategically important power and 
industrial CC sites in the region

The Drax-BECCS project is a ‘no regrets’ option
Negative emissions across a broad range of sectors are required at significant scale to achieve Net Zero 
– Negative emissions are required to offset residual emissions across the economy. Engineered solutions such as BECCS-Power can make a 
major contribution.
It is cost-optimal to deploy BECCS-Power in the late 2020s
– Early deployment of negative emissions technologies is critical to achieving the UK’s intermediate carbon targets. Deployment of BECCS-
Power before 2030 is cost-optimal in all scenarios and early deployment will enable BECCS-Power to scale up ahead of 2050.
BECCS-Power has a critical and significant role to play in achieving Net Zero 
– BECCS-Power is deployed in all scenarios – with 2-10 GW of capacity in 2050 – providing 13-73 MTpa of negative emissions.  The Downside
and Central cases (13-29 MTpa) are broadly in line with the 16-39Mtpa of negative emissions from BECCS-Power suggested by the CCC, 
whilst the Upside case (73MTpa) shows an outcome where the economics strongly favour BECCS-Power over alternative BECCS options.  
Running BECCS at high load factors will provide strategically important benefits, including banking negative emissions to mitigate the risk of 
under-performance in other sectors, while also providing a valuable source of firm, reliable negative carbon power to complement
intermittent renewable technologies.
Achieving Net Zero will be significantly more expensive without BECCS-Power
– This ranges from a further £4-69bn in total discounted system costs across the pathway to 2050. In our Central case, without BECCS-Power, 
discounted system costs will be circa £15bn higher by 2050, equating to around £17 every year for each household in the UK.
The conversion of Drax’s existing biomass units from 2027 provides a unique opportunity to achieve low-cost negative emissions at scale
– Drax BECCS is deployed in all scenarios – with between 1 and 9 GW of additional new build capacity required by 2050. Without Drax BECCS, 
discounted system costs of achieving net zero by 2050 rise significantly, ranging from £2-6bn across the pathway. 
While the optimum mix of negative emissions technologies in 2050 is unclear, deploying BECCS-Power in the late 2020s is “no regrets”
– Conversion of Drax’s existing biomass units can pave the way to a substantial programme of new build BECCS and other negative emissions 
technologies, such as biomass gasification to produce hydrogen with negative emissions, with the optimum pathway being refined as 
technologies mature and costs evolve.  Drax BECCS can also provide an important “anchor project” for development of the CO2 
Transmission & Storage infrastructure as part of the Humber CCS cluster. Additionally, Drax’s consistent demand for biomass can aid in the 
development of sustainable biomass supply chains.
Our analysis demonstrates the Drax BECCS-Power project is a ‘no regrets’ option across a wide 
range of scenario conditions, enabling the UK to meet net-zero in a cost optimal manner

Net Emissions
Negative emissions are critical to achieving Net Zero 
Negative emissions are required to offset residual 
emissions across the economy. Engineered solutions 
such as BECCS-Power can make a major contribution.
Our analysis suggests there is very strong demand for CO2 
removals (50-90 MT CO2e) in addition to LULUCF (Land 
Use, Land Use Change and Forestry) to offset residual 
emissions from sectors that are harder to decarbonise, 
e.g. agriculture, aviation and certain heavy industries.
BECCS-Power provides a large portion of negative 
emissions in all cases, even in scenarios where conditions 
for BECCS-Power are less favourable compared to other 
BECCS negative emission routes.
BECCS-H2 plays an important complementary role to 
BECCS-Power, and is a key biomass consumer in the 
Central and Downside scenarios. In both cases, BECCS-
Power is added earlier in the pathway, while the need for 
BECCS-H2 develops later.
These are required at scale across various sectors, including engineered removals such as BECCS

Deployment of BECCS is cost-effective in the late 2020s
Early deployment of negative emissions technologies is 
critical to achieving the UK’s intermediate carbon 
targets. Deployment of BECCS-Power before 2030 is 
cost-optimal in all scenarios and early deployment will 
enable BECCS-Power to scale up ahead of 2050.
This is necessary if the UK is to reach both its 
intermediate targets (e.g. 68% reduction in overall 
emissions by 2030) and Net Zero by 2050 in a cost-
effective manner. To achieve this, significant investment 
in and support for BECCS will need to be undertaken. This 
is consistent with the key messages in the CCC’s recent 6th
Carbon Budget publication.
Deployment of BECCS-Power in the late 2020’s is integral 
to meeting the targets in the Fifth Carbon Budget. In all 
scenarios, it is cost-optimal to deploy BECCS-Power in the 
late 2020s. The total gross removals from BECCS-Power is 
8 MTpa in 2030, growing to 16-33 MTpa in 2040, and 13-
73 MTpa in 2050.

Drax-BECCS in the late 2020s is a “no regrets” option
BECCS-Power is deployed in all scenarios – with 2-10 GW 
of capacity in 2050 – providing 13-73 MTpa of negative 
emissions.  The Downside to Central cases (13-29 MTpa) 
are broadly in line with the 16-39Mtpa of negative 
emissions from BECCS-power suggested by the CCC, 
whilst the Upside case (73MTpa) shows an outcome 
where the economics strongly favour BECCS-Power over 
alternative BECCS options.  Running BECCS at high load 
factors will provide strategically important benefits, 
including banking negative emissions to mitigate the risk 
of underperformance in other sectors while also 
providing a valuable source of firm, reliable negative 
carbon power to complement intermittent renewable 
technologies.
Two Drax biomass units* are converted to BECCS in 2027-
29 in all three cases. An additional 1-9 GW of new build 
BECCS is added from 2030-2050.
In the Downside case, where conditions are deliberately 
less favourable for BECCS-Power, an additional 1 GW of 
new build BECCS is still deployed over and above Drax by 
the mid-2030s.
Material capacity of BECCS-Power, including the Drax project, is chosen to be deployed across all 
scenarios as part of driving cost-optimal pathways to meet Net Zero

Achieving Net Zero without BECCS-Power is more expensive
The additional total system costs, in the absence of 
BECCS-Power, range from a further £4-69bn across the 
pathway to 2050. In our Central case, without BECCS-
Power, system costs will be circa £15bn higher by 2050, 
equating to a cost of £17 every year for each household 
in the UK.
This measure of the “value of BECCS” power is defined by 
an opportunity cost approach,  i.e. if BECCS-Power as a 
technology was not allowed, how much more expensive 
would the system design be in its absence to achieve the 
same outcomes in terms of net zero targets, security of 
supply, etc.
Even in the Downside, which is unfavourable for BECCS-
Power by design, BECCS-Power delivers a £4bn net 
benefit to the system.
In our Central case this is broadly equivalent to around £17/household/year to 2050

Achieving Net Zero without Drax-BECCS is more expensive
Drax-BECCS is deployed in all scenarios – with between 1 
and 9GW of additional new build capacity required by 
2050. Without Drax-BECCS, system costs rise significantly, 
ranging from £2-6bn across the pathway. By not 
deploying Drax-BECCS in 2027, the system is unable to 
deploy any BECCS-Power until the 2030s.
The opportunity cost of not having the Drax-BECCS project 
is driven by both the lower cost of the Drax project 
compared to new build, as well as the value of facilitating 
power sector and broader decarbonisation efforts earlier in 
the pathway, particularly given the UK’s challenging target 
of a 68% reduction in emissions by 2030. 
There are additional associated benefits of Drax-BECCS:
– Conversion of Drax’s existing biomass units can pave 
the way to a substantial programme of new build 
BECCS and other negative emissions technologies, 
such as biomass gasification to produce hydrogen with 
negative emissions, with the optimum pathway being 
refined as technologies mature and costs evolve.  
– Drax-BECCS can also provide an important “anchor 
project” for development of the CO2 Transmission & 
Storage infrastructure as part of the Humber CCS 
cluster as well as providing a bank of early negative 
emissions in case of slow progress decarbonising other 
sectors.
In all scenarios the decarbonisation pathway is lower cost if Drax-BECCS is deployed in 2027 
compared with waiting to implement new build BECCS in the 2030s

The value of Drax materialises early in the pathway
Decarbonising the UK without Drax-BECCS comes at a significant cost, of which the majority is 
concentrated during the period of the 5th Carbon Budget.
The additional system costs without Drax-BECCS are 
particularly material in the short term.  In the Central Case, 
over 80% of these cost increases, due to not building Drax, 
are incurred before the end of the Fifth Carbon Budget.
In particular, this is driven by the reduction in emissions that 
would need to happen elsewhere in the energy system 
(power and other sectors) in the absence of Drax-BECCS, 
across the Fifth Carbon Budget period.  This is equivalent to 
a cumulative total reduction of circa 38 MtCO2.
In power, incremental emissions abatement would need to 
come from a significant net increase in wind and solar build 
across the Fifth Carbon Budget.  This amounts to more than 
10 GW of new capacity, over and above the 30 GW that 
already needs to be built across this period, even when Drax 
is deployed.
Similarly, significant additional investment in 
decarbonisation of domestic heating and road transport is 
also required in the absence of Drax-BECCS.  This includes a 
further 2 MTpa reduction in domestic heating emissions.  
This is approximately equivalent to deploying an extra 0.5M 
heat pumps (or a city the size of Birmingham) across the 
Fifth Carbon Budget, on top of the circa 3M already being 
deployed.

BECCS-Power plays a critical role in achieving Net Zero
Drax BECCS is deployed in all scenarios, even the 
Downside, which is deliberately unfavourable for BECCS-
Power. In addition to being deployed, the operation of 
Drax is robust across the scenarios, with operation at 
high load factors. 
Whilst we have imposed a floor of 85% on the Drax load 
factor until 2045*, Drax is still chosen to be deployed in 
all scenarios, and in many cases operates above this floor.
Later in the pathway, BECCS can potentially provide 
dispatchable negative emissions generation, supporting 
the base of intermittent renewables and filling in for the 
diminished role of flexible fossil fuel plant.
In the Downside and Central cases, it is cost-effective to 
run the BECCS capacity at high load factors for a significant 
part of the pathway. However, in the last 10 years, some 
biomass is diverted to BECCS-H2 reducing load factors for 
flexible BECCS to around 70%. In the Upside case, high 
load factor operation is seen throughout. 
The load factor for BECCS-Power remains high through to 2050, with flexibility to balance 
intermittent renewables becoming increasingly important in the latter part of the timeline

The power sector capacity mix is transformed by 2050
Heavy electrification in many sectors of the wider energy system leads to a huge increase in 
decarbonised power with the system becoming carbon neutral by the early 2030s
Power Sector Generation Capacity (Central Scenario) 
Other includes Hydro, Marine, Waste CCS, Oil, Unabated Biomass/Waste
By 2050 the power sector sees a huge expansion in 
renewable electricity, with capacity increasing 7-fold 
from today and representing 65% of (nameplate) 
capacity. All coal plant is shut by 2024.
The capacity of BECCS reaches 5 GW by 2050 (Central 
case). Both units of Drax-BECCS are deployed in 2027/ 
28. Drax combined with rapid expansion of renewables 
helps the system become carbon neutral by the early 
2030s. Continuing expansion of BECCS leads to the 
power sector being significantly net negative by 2050.
There is also significant expansion of low carbon 
flexible plant in the form of batteries, H2 turbines and 
mid-merit gas with CCS, as well as a gradual expansion 
of interconnectors and demand side flexibility. 
Managing a grid with an increasing proportion of 
intermittent generation is becoming a challenge. Low 
and negative carbon technologies that provide inertia 
and other ancillary services, such as BECCS, are 
increasingly important.
