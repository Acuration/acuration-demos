MARKET CONTEXT CONTINUED
ACROSS PELLET PRODUCTION, 
POWER GENERATION AND 
B2B ENERGY SUPPLY, DRAX’S 
BUSINESSES ARE RESPONDING 
TO THE NEEDS OF A CHANGING 
ENERGY SYSTEM
POWER GENERATION
2017 saw the continuation of key themes 
which characterised 2016: the further 
deployment of intermittent renewables and 
the impact of less thermal generation. Coal 
continued to play a less signiﬁcant role than 
in the past, reflecting diminishing economic 
returns, principally due to the UK carbon tax 
and uncertainty against a backdrop of the 
UK Government’s ambition to end unabated 
coal generation by 2025. Coal produced 
7% of UK power compared to 43% in 2012.
Forward prices remained low in 2017 by 
historical standards. More distributed 
generation and the increase in intermittent 
renewables are driving increased levels of 
volatility in short-term prices and a need for 
assets to provide system support services. 
In June 2017 National Grid set out its 
“System Needs and Product Strategy” 
(SNAPS) consultation which outlined the 
system balancing needs (Response, Reserve, 
Reactive Power, Black Start and Inertia) and 
set out how these products are likely to 
develop over time. The large scale, flexible 
and low-carbon proposition of biomass and 
options to develop new gas generation 
assets means Drax is well placed to provide 
these services. With more wind, solar and 
nuclear planned for the coming decade, 
Drax is well positioned to support the system 
in the long term.
The need to decarbonise heating, transport 
and other sectors of the economy may lead 
to an absolute increase in the level of power 
demand in the UK.
In the near-term, there continues to be an 
important role for the efﬁcient coal assets 
Drax operates, often not as baseload 
generation but in the provision of system 
support services such as flexible generation 
at times of peak and low demand. In the past 
these services were typically provided 
by large thermal plant, but with fewer 
generation assets now able to provide 
these services the value of this market 
should increase.

PELLET PRODUCTION
2017 saw an increase in spot market prices 
for wood pellets. Our focus on long-term 
contracts and self-supply offers us 
protection from price rises. By approaching 
the market in this way we see opportunities 
to create value, such as through the addition 
of further pellet capacity to progress 
towards our target to self-supply up to 30% 
of our requirement.
 
For the volume of biomass procured from 
third parties, our approach remains to 
source sustainable pellets underpinned by 
long-term contracts with ﬁxed formula 
pricing and to actively hedge our long-term 
foreign exchange requirement. This 
approach gives us good long-term visibility 
of our biomass costs over a ﬁve-year period.
B2B ENERGY SUPPLY
In the context of a converging energy 
market, business to business (B2B) 
customers are seeking more support from 
their energy suppliers, including: competitive 
prices, expert support, renewable offers and 
flexible terms. 
Smart meters are becoming a central part of 
the customer experience and their beneﬁts 
are starting to be seen across the market. As 
of October 2017, 7.7 million smart meters had 
been installed in the UK and research by 
Smart Energy GB(1) shows they are driving 
behavioural change, with 86% of customers 
who have had a meter installed making 
energy saving changes. 
Through our brands, Opus Energy and Haven 
Power, in the B2B market our offers are 
distinctive, tailored to the needs of 
customers which will allow the Group to 
play a signiﬁcant role in the changing 
energy market.
In October 2017 the Government published 
a Bill to implement an energy price cap on 
default tariffs in the domestic supply market 
(commonly known as Standard Variable 
Tariffs). Drax is monitoring this development 
closely but we do not operate in the 
domestic market.

OUR STRATEGIC OBJECTIVES CONTINUED
PELLET PRODUCTION
ACQUISITION OF 
LASALLE BIOENERGY 
(LASALLE)
In April we completed the 
acquisition of LaSalle which 
will provide an additional 450k 
tonnes of pellet capacity and 
make a meaningful contribution 
to our target of self-supplying 
30% of our pellet requirement 
for power generation.
LaSalle was acquired for 
$35 million and after a $27 million 
investment programme the unit 
is now commissioning.
The plant is located in close 
proximity to our existing assets 
in the US Gulf region and will 
deliver signiﬁcant operational 
and ﬁnancial beneﬁts, once 
fully commissioned.
PELLET PRODUCTION
ADDITIONAL LOW-COST 
PELLET CAPACITY AT 
AMITE AND MOREHOUSE
During 2017 we installed and commissioned 150kt of 
additional unloading and storage capacity at our Amite 
and Morehouse pellet plants, which allows us to receive 
and process a greater amount of lower cost residues 
from commercial forestry and lumber mill processes. 
These facilities will help reduce our overall biomass cost.
LOOKING AHEAD
As the UK transitions to a low-carbon 
economy, major carbon savings will need 
to be delivered across generation heating 
and transport. 
If the UK is to achieve its aims it will need to 
electrify heating and transport, which will 
increase power demand and require new 
sources of generation.
We take a long-term approach, seeking to 
identify options which can deliver value-
accretive growth to 2025 and beyond. 
To that end we continue to look for 
opportunities through Research and 
Innovation (R&I) to support our ambitions 
for 2025, identifying additional sources of 
value from our core areas of activity – Pellet 
Production, Power Generation and B2B 
Energy Supply.
FLEXIBLE, LOW-CARBON 
AND RELIABLE – THE LONG-TERM 
NEED FOR BIOMASS ELECTRICITY
Demand for low-carbon electricity is 
set to increase with more intermittent 
renewables and less thermal generation 
available to support the system.
National Grid’s System Needs and 
Product Strategy report suggests that 
within four years the generation schedule 
presented by the market will be 
inadequate to maintain security of 
supply up to 60% of the time, without 
some form of intervention.
We therefore see a long-term role for 
biomass in the UK generation market. 
To help deliver this, our R&I team is 
highly focused on opportunities to drive 
efﬁciencies into our supply chain and 
reduce biomass costs.
PROGRESSING OUR  
STRATEGY FOR 2025
During 2017 we made excellent progress in  
delivering our strategy for 2025 and beyond.

TURBINE (OCGT) 
DEVELOPMENT
During the year we progressed development 
of four OCGT projects which will begin 
construction once we have secured a 15-year 
capacity contract for their power. These plants 
will take three years to build and commission 
before the delivery period for the contract 
commences.
Once operational, the plants will each provide 
299MW of fast, flexible gas generation to meet 
peak power demand and provide system 
support services.

B2B ENERGY SUPPLY
ACQUISITION OF 
OPUS ENERGY
In February 2017 the Group acquired Opus 
Energy, a leading player in the SME sector 
of the B2B energy supply market. Opus 
Energy has now been successfully 
integrated with the Group alongside our 
existing Haven Power business, positioning 
the Group as the ﬁfth largest B2B energy 
supply operator in the UK.
POWER GENERATION
COAL TO BIOMASS 
CONVERSION
In January 2018 the UK government 
conﬁrmed support for conversion of a 
fourth unit to biomass fuel. The conversion 
of unit 4 will complete during 2018 allowing 
us to optimise generation across three ROC 
accredited units.
COAL-TO-GAS REPOWERING
We are developing an option for up to 3.6GW of gas generation by 
repowering two of our remaining coal units at Drax Power Station. 
This would utilise existing infrastructure to deliver a lower cost 
solution for new Combined Cycle Gas Turbines (CCGT) and reduce 
carbon emissions versus coal, with a wide operating range covering 
baseload and peaking generation, in addition to system support 
services. Alongside this we are developing an option for a new 
200MW battery storage facility through which we could provide 
immediate system support services as part of the UK’s energy 
revolution.
These developments are progressing through a public consultation 
after which they could participate in a future capacity market 
auction and receive a 15-year capacity agreement, which would 
underpin the investment decision.
ACADEMIC PARTNERSHIPS 
FOR FUTURE INNOVATION
We are funding postgraduate research at Shefﬁeld University’s 
Centre for Doctoral Training in Energy Storage and its Applications. 
Can flow batteries support the national high voltage transmission 
system, once dominated by thermal generators? How will customers 
interact with us, using smart technology to turn their company car 
fleets into mini power plants? And how may we be able to scrub the 
flue gas – and potentially capture or use carbon dioxide emissions?

In 2017 we made signiﬁcant progress 
with the strategy we announced in 
December 2016. 
First, we completed the acquisition of Opus 
Energy – a leading challenger brand in the 
UK Small and Medium-sized Enterprise 
(SME) energy market; second, we acquired 
a third biomass pellet plant (LaSalle 
Bioenergy), which signiﬁcantly increases 
our pellet production capacity; and third, we 
continued to develop options for flexible gas 
generation at four sites around the UK. 
We also began developing longer-term 
options for growth, with the exploration 
of coal-to-gas repowering at Drax Power 
Station, as we look to provide new sources of 
flexible generation backed up by long-term 
capacity contracts. To support our strategy, 
we completed a reﬁnancing in May and 
announced a new dividend policy in June.
At the same time, we have continued to 
provide a signiﬁcant amount of the UK’s 
renewable electricity. With conﬁrmation of 
Government support for further biomass 
generation at Drax Power Station we plan 
to continue our work to develop a low-cost 
solution for a fourth biomass unit 
conversion, allowing us to provide even 
more renewable electricity, whilst 
supporting system stability at minimum 
cost to the consumer.
Opus Energy performed well, delivering 
on the plans we set out at the time of 
acquisition and, in North America, LaSalle 
Bioenergy is successfully commissioning. 
This performance alongside safety, 
sustainability and expertise in our core 
markets acts as a strong base from which 
the business can grow and deliver long-term 
sustainable value.
We have a major role to play in supporting 
the UK energy system, as it becomes 
increasingly ambitious in decarbonising, ﬁrst 
the electricity sector and subsequently 
transport and heating. In doing so, through 
our flexible, low-carbon and customer-
focused approach we aim to deliver higher 
quality earnings, with a reduction in 
commodity exposure alongside 
opportunities for growth.
Our people – employees and contractors – 
remain a key asset of the business. Their 
safety remains at the centre of our 
operational philosophy and we have 
performed well in this regard, although 
we continue to work to improve our 
performance across the Group.

EBITDA in 2017 of £229 million was 
signiﬁcantly ahead of 2016 (£140 million). 
This increase was principally from producing 
high levels of renewable power from 
sustainable biomass. We also beneﬁted from 
our growing B2B Energy Supply and Pellet 
Production businesses. Through these 
activities we are improving the visibility of 
our earnings.
In June we announced a new dividend 
policy. This policy is to pay a dividend which 
is sustainable and expected to grow as the 
implementation of the strategy generates an 
increasing proportion of stable earnings and 
cash flows. In determining the rate of growth 
in dividends the Board will take account of 
contracted cash flows, the less predictable 
cash flows from the Group’s commodity 
based business and future investment 
opportunities. If there is a build-up of capital 
the Board will consider the most appropriate 
mechanism to return this to shareholders.
At the 2017 half year results we conﬁrmed an 
interim dividend of £20 million (4.9 pence per 
share) representing 40% of the full year 
expected dividend of £50 million (12.3 pence 
per share) (2016: £10 million, 2.5 pence per 
share). Accordingly, the Board proposes to 
pay a ﬁnal dividend in respect of 2017 of 
£30 million, equivalent to 7.4 pence per 
share. In addition, the Board has decided 
to announce a £50 million share buy-back 
programme, which will take place during 
2018, which is consistent with our capital 
allocation policy.
CORPORATE GOVERNANCE
In September, Dorothy Thompson CBE 
announced her intention to stand down as 
Group Chief Executive Ofﬁcer (CEO). I would 
like to thank Dorothy for her enormous 
contribution to the Group over the last 
13 years. During her tenure Dorothy led the 
transformation of the business and leaves 
the Group in a strong position with a clear 
strategy that lays the foundations for further 
success in a changing energy sector.
Dorothy is succeeded by Will Gardiner, who 
was previously Group Chief Financial Ofﬁcer 
(CFO) and a key architect of the strategy. His 
appointment follows a thorough review of 
internal and external candidates and is a 
natural progression after two years working 
alongside Dorothy developing a strategy 
which I am conﬁdent will create signiﬁcant 
beneﬁts for all Drax’s stakeholders. 
A process to appoint a permanent CFO 
is underway and Den Jones has been 
appointed as Interim CFO. Den is highly 
experienced, having previously served as 
CFO of both Johnson Matthey and BG Group. 
Drax remains committed to the highest 
standards of corporate governance. The 
Board and its committees play an active role 
in guiding the Company and leading its 
strategy. We greatly value the contribution 
made by our Non-Executive Directors (NEDs) 
and during a time of transition their role is 
especially important. 
We indicated last year that we were seeking 
additional NEDs with experience in 
sustainability and energy supply to 
complement our already experienced Board. 
I am therefore delighted to welcome two 
new NEDs to the Drax Board. Firstly, David 
Nussbaum, whose in-depth knowledge of 
sustainability will support our continued 
focus in this area; and secondly, Nicola 
Hodson, whose experience in technology, 
business transformation and energy, will 
provide real value as the Group delivers 
its strategy. 
Sustainability remains at the heart of the 
business, both the speciﬁc sustainability of 
biomass and more broadly the long-term 
sustainability of the business. As such I am 
pleased to note that alongside this year’s 
annual report and accounts the Group has 
published a a comprehensive overview of 
our sustainability progress in 2017 on our 
website www.drax.com/sustainability. 
Full details of our corporate governance can 
be found on page 64.
OUR PEOPLE
As the Group grows I would also like to 
welcome colleagues from Opus Energy 
and our other developments. On-boarding is 
proceeding well and by working together in 
our common goal to help change the way 
energy is generated, supplied and used, we 
are creating real value for all stakeholders.
I must thank all the employees and 
contractors who have worked so hard to 
help the Group succeed in the last 12 
months. It is through their skill, expertise 
and hard work that we are able to deliver 
our strategy for the business. 
My sincere thanks to colleagues for their 
commitment and hard work.
It only remains for me to say that your 
Board remains totally committed to the 
complementary aims of delivering 
sustainable long-term value for the Group, 
and of helping our country build a low-
carbon economy.

MARKET BACKGROUND
The UK is undergoing an energy revolution 
– a transition to a low-carbon economy 
requiring new energy solutions for power 
generation, heating, transport and the wider 
economy. Through our flexible, lower carbon 
electricity proposition and business to 
business (B2B) energy solutions, the Group 
is positioning itself for growth in this 
environment. More details can be seen 
on page 4.
OUR STRATEGY
Our purpose is to help change the way 
energy is generated, supplied and used.
Through addressing UK energy needs, and 
those of our customers, our strategy is 
designed to deliver growing earnings and 
cash flow, alongside signiﬁcant cash returns 
for shareholders.
Our ambition is to grow our EBITDA to over 
£425 million by 2025, with over a third of 
those earnings coming from Pellet 
Production and B2B Energy Supply to create 
a broader, more balanced earnings proﬁle. 
We intend to pay a sustainable and growing 
dividend to shareholders. Progression 
towards these targets is underpinned by 
safety, sustainability, operational excellence 
and expertise in our markets.
SUMMARY OF 2017
We made signiﬁcant progress during 2017, 
but were below our expectations on the 
challenging scorecard targets we set 
ourselves in pellet production and biomass 
availability, the latter reflecting the 
signiﬁcant incident we experienced on our 
biomass rail unloading facilities at the end 
of 2017, which extended into January 2018. 
Energy Supply performed well with Opus 
Energy in line with plan and Haven Power 
exceeding its targets. Through a 
combination of this performance and the 
progress of our strategy we have delivered 
EBITDA of £229 million, signiﬁcantly ahead 
of 2016 (£140 million) and with each of our 
three businesses contributing positive 
EBITDA for the ﬁrst time.
The Group scorecard is reported in full in the 
Remuneration Report and the KPIs are also 
shown on the following pages of this review. 
They reflect the diversity of our operations 
and our need to maintain clear focus on 
delivering operational excellence.
On a statutory basis we recorded a loss of 
£151 million, which reflects unrealised losses 
on derivative contracts, previously 
announced accounting policy on the 
accelerated depreciation on coal-speciﬁc 
assets as well as amortisation of newly-
acquired intangible assets in Opus Energy. 
We also calculate underlying earnings, a 
proﬁt after tax of £2.7 million, which excludes 
the effect of unrealised gains and losses on 
derivative contracts and, to assess the 
performance of the Group without the 
income statement volatility introduced by 
non-cash fair value adjustments on our 
portfolio of forward commodity and 
currency futures contracts.
During the year we reﬁnanced our existing 
debt facilities, reducing our debt cost. We 
also conﬁrmed a new dividend policy which 
will pay a sustainable and growing dividend 
(£50 million in respect of 2017), consistent 
with our commitment to a strong balance 
sheet and our ambitions for growth. At year 
end our net debt was £91 million below our 
2x net debt to EBITDA target, providing 
additional headroom. There is more detail on 
our ﬁnancial performance in the Group 
Financial Review on page 46.
In the US, our Pellet Production operations 
recorded year-on-year growth in output of 
35%, with our ﬁrst two plants now producing 
at full capacity. During the second half of 
2017 we also completed the installation of 
additional capacity enabling our Morehouse 
and Amite facilities to handle a greater 
amount of residue material, supporting 
efforts to produce good quality pellets at the 
lowest cost. 
As part of our target to expand our biomass 
self-supply capability we completed the 
acquisition of LaSalle Bioenergy (LaSalle) 
adding pellet production capacity. LaSalle 
commenced commissioning in November 
2017 and due to its close proximity to our 
existing US facilities, once complete, will 
provide further opportunities for supply 
chain optimisation.
As in 2016, we beneﬁted from the flexibility 
of self-supply. This often overlooked 
attribute of our supply chain enables us to 
manage biomass supply across the Power 
Generation business’ planned outage 
season and to beneﬁt from attractively 
priced biomass cargoes in the short-term 
spot market.
In Power Generation, we experienced a 
signiﬁcant incident on our biomass rail 
unloading facilities, including a small ﬁre on 
a section of conveyor. We fully investigated 
the incident and following repairs over the 
Christmas period have now recommissioned 
the facility, with enhanced operating 
procedures. This is a timely reminder of the 
combustible nature of biomass and the need 
for strong controls and processes to protect 
our people and assets.
Our biomass units continued to produce 
high levels of renewable electricity from 
sustainable wood pellets for the UK market 
– Drax produced 15% of the UK’s renewable 
electricity – enough to power Shefﬁeld, 
Leeds, Liverpool and Manchester combined. 
In doing so, we are making a vital 
contribution to the UK’s ambitious targets 
for decarbonisation across electricity 
generation, heating and transport – an 80% 
reduction by 2050 vs. 1990 levels.
We beneﬁted from the ﬁrst year of operation 
of our third biomass unit under the Contract 
for Difference (CfD) scheme which provides 
an index-linked price for the power produced 
until March 2027. The unit underwent a 
major planned outage between September 
and November, with a full programme of 
works successfully completed.
The flexibility, reliability and scale of our 
renewable generation, alongside an 
attractive total system cost, means we are 
strongly placed to play a long-term role in the 
UK’s energy mix. To that end we continue to 
see long-term biomass generation as a key 
enabler, allowing the UK Government to 
meet its decarbonisation targets and the 
system operator to manage the grid.
The UK Government recently conﬁrmed 
support for further biomass generation at 
Drax Power Station and we now plan to 
continue our work to develop a low-cost 
solution for a fourth biomass unit, allowing 
us to provide even more renewable 
electricity, whilst supporting system stability 
at minimum cost to the consumer.

Our heritage is coal, but our future is flexible 
lower-carbon electricity. We are making 
progress with the development of four new 
standalone OCGT plants situated in eastern 
England and Wales and our work to develop 
options for coal-to-gas repowering with 
battery technologies. If these options would 
be supported by 15-year capacity market 
contracts, providing a clear investment 
signal and extending visibility of contract-
based earnings out to the late 2030s.
In B2B Energy Supply, we completed the 
acquisition of Opus Energy, a supplier of 
electricity and gas to corporates and small 
businesses. The transaction completed in 
February 2017 and Opus Energy has 
continued to operate successfully within the 
Group, achieving its targets and making an 
immediate and signiﬁcant contribution 
to proﬁtability. Alongside this good 
performance we have also implemented 
the operational steps necessary to realise 
further operational beneﬁts of the 
acquisition, and we now source all of 
Opus’ power and gas internally. 
Haven Power delivered a strong 
performance with the sale of large volumes 
of electricity to industrial customers. 
Through our customer focus and 
efﬁciencies, margins have improved and 
the business generated a positive EBITDA 
for the ﬁrst time.
Together, our B2B Energy Supply business 
now has over 375,000 customer meters, 
making it the ﬁfth largest B2B power 
supplier in the UK. We are delivering 
innovative low-carbon power solutions, with 
46% of our energy sold from renewable 
sources. As the power system transforms, 
we will be working closely with our 
customers to help them adapt to a world 
of more decentralised and decarbonised 
power. We see this as a signiﬁcant 
opportunity for the Group in the medium 
to long term.
In October 2017 we completed the sale of 
Billington Bioenergy (BBE) to Aggregated 
Micro Power Holding (AMPH). Consideration 
for the transaction was £2.3 million, 
comprised of £1.6 million of shares in AMPH 
and £0.7 million of cash.
The sale of BBE is aligned with our strategy 
to focus on B2B energy supply. However, 
through our shareholding in AMPH, we will 
retain an interest in the UK heating market, 
whilst gaining exposure to the development 
of small-scale distributed energy assets.
POLITICAL, REGULATORY AND 
ECONOMIC BACKGROUND
We continue to operate in a changing 
environment. The full impact of the UK’s 
decision to leave the EU is still unknown. 
The immediate impact on the Group was a 
weakening of Sterling and an associated 
increase in the cost of biomass, which is 
generally denominated in other currencies. 
Through our utilisation of medium-term 
foreign exchange hedges the Group 
protected the cash impact of this weakness. 
In 2017, Sterling has generally strengthened, 
and we have been able to extend our hedged 
position out to 2022 at rates close to those 
that we saw before Brexit. 
In terms of UK energy policy, the 
Government’s main focus has been on 
what it sees as unfair treatment of domestic 
consumers on legacy standard variable tariff 
(SVT) contracts. SVT are not a common 
feature of the B2B market. At the 
microbusiness end of this market, which 
is closer in size to domestic, most of our 
customers are on ﬁxed price products 
and are active in renewing contracts.
The UK Government’s response to its 
consultation on the cessation of coal 
generation by 2025 has conﬁrmed an end to 
non-compliant coal generation by October 
2025. We believe our assets, projects and 
ability to support our customers’ electricity 
management will support the Government’s 
ambition to maintain reliability when coal 
generation ceases.
Running a resilient, reliable grid is not simply 
about meeting the power demand on the 
system; there are also system support 
services which are essential to its effective 
operation. As the grid decentralises and 
becomes dependent on smaller, distributed 
generation, the number of plants able to 
provide these services is reducing. Biomass 
generation, our proposed OCGTs and our 
repowering project would allow us to meet 
these needs, but this will not come for free. 
A reliable, flexible, low-carbon energy system 
will require the right long-term incentives.
In November 2017, the Government 
conﬁrmed that the UK will maintain a total 
carbon price (the combined UK Carbon Price 
Support – CPS – and the European Union 
Emissions Trading Scheme – EU ETS) at 
around the current level. CPS has been the 
single most effective instrument in reducing 
the level of carbon emissions in generation 
and we continue to support the pricing of 
carbon, a view echoed in a report prepared 
for the UK Government by the leading 
academic Professor Dieter Helm. (www.biee.
org/wpcms/wp-content/uploads/Cost_of_
Energy_Review.pdf)
Against this backdrop we continue to 
make an important contribution to the 
UK economy. According to a study 
published by Oxford Economics in 2016 
(Draximpact.co.uk), Drax’s total economic 
impact – including our supply chain and 
the wages our employees and suppliers’ 
employees spend in the wider consumer-
economy was £1.7 billion, supporting 
18,500 jobs across the UK.
SAFETY, SUSTAINABILITY AND PEOPLE
The health, safety and wellbeing of our 
employees and contractors is vital to the 
Group, with safety at the centre of our 
operational philosophy. We also recognise 
the growing need to support the wellbeing 
of our employees and their mental health.

During the year we continued to use Total 
Recordable Injury Rate (TRIR) as our primary 
KPI in this area. Performance was positive, 
at 0.27, but we expect this to improve in the 
coming year.
The incident at our biomass rail unloading 
facilities in December did not lead to physical 
injuries but was nonetheless a signiﬁcant 
event and caused disruption into 2018. 
We consequently launched an incident 
investigation to ensure our personal and 
process safety management procedures 
are robust. 
To promote greater awareness around 
wellbeing we have embedded this in our new 
people strategy (see below) and expect to 
focus more energy and resources on this 
important area during 2018.
Strong corporate governance is at the heart 
of the Group – acting responsibly, doing the 
right thing and being transparent. As the 
Group grows the range of sustainability 
issues we face is widening and recognising 
the importance of strong corporate 
governance, we have published a 
comprehensive overview of our 
sustainability progress in 2017 on our 
website. This also highlights future priorities 
to broaden our approach to sustainability 
and improved reporting of environment, 
social and governance (ESG) performance. 
We have also completed the process which 
allows us to participate in the UN Global 
Compact (UNGC) – an international 
framework which will guide our approach 
in the areas of human rights, labour, 
environment and anti-corruption.
During 2017 we published our ﬁrst statement 
on the prevention of slavery and human 
trafﬁcking in compliance with the UK 
Modern Slavery Act. We have added modern 
slavery awareness to our programme of 
regular training for contract managers 
and reviewed our counterparty due 
diligence processes.
Total Recordable Injury Rate
0.27
(2016: 0.22)
We have continued to maintain our rigorous 
and robust approach to biomass 
sustainability, ensuring the wood pellets we 
use are sustainable, low-carbon and fully 
compliant with the UK’s mandatory 
sustainability standards for biomass. The 
biomass we use to generate electricity 
provides a 64% carbon emissions saving 
against gas, inclusive of supply chain 
emissions. Our biomass lifecycle carbon 
emissions are 36g CO2/ MJ, less than half the 
UK Government’s 79g CO2/ MJ limit.
Our people are a key asset of the business. 
Through 2017 we developed a new people 
strategy. The strategy focuses on driving 
performance and developing talent to 
deliver the Group’s objectives. We have 
established Group-wide practices, including 
a career development and behaviour 
framework focused on performance and 
personal development.
RESEARCH AND INNOVATION
A key part of our strategy is to identify 
opportunities to improve existing operations 
and create options for long-term growth. To 
that end we have established a dedicated 
Research and Innovation (R&I) team led by 
the Drax engineers who delivered our 
world-ﬁrst biomass generation and supply 
chain solution.
 
We are actively looking at ways to improve 
the efﬁciency of our operations, notably in 
our biomass supply chain. Biomass is our 
largest single cost and as such we are 
focused on greater supply chain efﬁciency 
and the extraction of value from a wide 
range of low-value residue materials.
In B2B Energy Supply we are using our 
engineering expertise to help offer our 
customers value-adding services and 
products which will improve efﬁciency 
and allow them to optimise their energy 
consumption.

CASE STUDY
Low-cost, high-impact 
capacity increase
By-products of higher value wood industries, such as sawdust from sawmills, 
offer a low-cost source of residues for use in our pellet production process 
and during 2017 we added an additional 150k tonnes of capacity at our pellet 
plants to allow us to use more of this material. By investing in giant hydraulic 
platforms known as “truck dumps”, operators at Amite and Morehouse can 
unload a 50-foot truck carrying either sawdust or wood chips and weighing 
60 tonnes in less than two minutes, increasing processing capacity, reducing 
the cost of processing and increasing the use of lower cost residues.

PELLET PRODUCTION 
Our pellets provide a sustainable, low-carbon 
fuel source – one that can be safely and 
efﬁciently delivered through our global 
supply chain and used by Drax’s Power 
Generation business to make renewable 
electricity for the UK. Our manufacturing 
operations also promote forest health by 
incentivising local landowners to actively 
manage and reinvest in their forests.
OPERATIONAL REVIEW
Safety remains our primary concern and 
we have delivered year-on-year reduction 
in the level of recordable incidents.
Output at our Amite and Morehouse pellet 
plants increased signiﬁcantly, although 
was below our target for the year.
We have remained focused on opportunities 
to improve efﬁciencies and capture cost 
savings as part of our drive to produce 
good quality pellets at the lowest possible 
cost. We still have more work to do in this 
area to optimise quality and cost, as our 
performance was below target for the year. 
As part of our plans to optimise and 
improve operations we added 150k tonnes 
capacity at our existing plants, bringing 
total installed capacity to 1.1 million 
tonnes and increasing the amount of 
lower cost sawmill residues we are able 
to process and used in our pellets.
At our Baton Rouge port facility greater 
volumes of production from our facilities 
drove higher levels of throughput 
with 17 vessels loaded and dispatched 
during the year (2016: 11 vessels).
In April, in line with our strategy to increase 
self-supply, we acquired a 450k tonne wood 
pellet plant – LaSalle Bioenergy (LaSalle). 
Commissioning of the plant began in 
November 2017 and we expect to increase 
production through 2018. LaSalle is within 
a 200-mile radius of our existing facilities. 
By leveraging the locational beneﬁts of 
these assets we aim to deliver further 
operational and ﬁnancial efﬁciencies.

FINANCIAL RESULTS
There was a signiﬁcant improvement in 
2017, with EBITDA of £5.5 million (2016: 
£6.3 million negative EBITDA), driven 
by increasing volumes of wood pellets 
produced and sold to the Power Generation 
business. Sales of pellets in the year 
ending 31 December 2017 totalled £136 
million, an increase of 84% over 2016.
Gross margin increased, reflecting higher 
production volumes. Raw ﬁbre procurement, 
transportation and processing comprised 
the majority of cost of sales and as such 
this remains an important area of focus 
and an opportunity for the business. 
Through incremental investment in plant 
enhancements we expect to see further 
beneﬁts from efﬁciencies and greater 
utilisation of lower cost residues.
Total operating costs have increased, 
reflecting an increase in operations at 
Amite, Morehouse and the Port of Baton 
Rouge, alongside the addition of LaSalle.
We acquired LaSalle for $35 million and have 
invested an additional $27 million as part of 
a programme to return the unit to service.
LOOKING AHEAD
Through 2018 we expect to continue 
to deliver growth in EBITDA from our 
existing assets. Our focus is on the 
commissioning of LaSalle alongside 
opportunities for optimisation and 
efﬁciencies in our processes, to deliver 
good quality pellets at the lowest cost.
We remain alert to market opportunities 
to develop further capacity as part 
of our self-supply strategy.

STRATEGY IN PROGRESS 
Gas power station 
development
We are developing options for four new OCGT gas power stations, two of 
which already have planning permission and could be on the system in the 
early 2020s, subject to being awarded a capacity agreement.
A high-tech new control room at Drax Power Station will allow engineers 
to have real time remote control of our OCGT assets via a ﬁbre-optic cable 
network. Able to ﬁre up from cold and produce power in minutes rather 
than hours, our OCGTs will help maintain system security as intermittent 
renewable sources of power increase and older thermal plants close.
Investment case
– Option to develop 1.2GW of new OCGT gas
– Investment decisions subject to 15-year capacity agreement
– Multiple revenue streams, with high visibility from capacity contract
– Low capital and operating cost
– Attractive return on capital
– Broader generation asset base and location

POWER GENERATION
Drax Power Station remains the largest 
power station in the UK (almost twice the 
size of the next largest). During the year the 
station met 6% of the UK’s electricity needs, 
whilst providing 15% of its renewable 
electricity, alongside important system 
support services. 
With an increase in intermittent renewables 
and a reduction in the responsive thermal 
generation historically provided by coal, the 
system of the future will require capacity 
which is reliable, flexible and able to respond 
quickly to changes in system demand and 
provide system support services. These 
long-term needs inform our biomass 
generation and the development of options 
for investment in gas – Open Cycle Gas 
Turbines (OCGTs) and coal-to-gas 
repowering.
REGULATORY FRAMEWORK
In October the Government published its 
Clean Growth Plan, setting out its plans for 
delivery of its legally binding target to reduce 
2050 carbon emissions by 80% versus 1990 
levels across electricity generation, heating 
and transport. This reinforces the Drax 
proposition – flexible, reliable, low-carbon 
electricity.
In November the Government updated its 
intentions regarding the future trajectory of 
UK Carbon Price Support (CPS), indicating 
that the total cost of carbon tax in the UK 
(the total of CPS and the EU Emissions 
Trading Scheme) would continue at around 
the current level (the tax is currently set 
at £18/tonne) whilst coal remains on the 
system. We believe that CPS has been the 
single most effective instrument in reducing 
carbon emissions from generation and that 
having an appropriate price for carbon 
emissions is the right way to provide a 
market signal to further reduce emissions 
in support of the UK’s long-term 
decarbonisation targets.
The UK Government has now conﬁrmed an 
end to non-compliant coal generation by 
2025. We support this move subject to an 
appropriate alternative technology being in 
place. With this in mind we have continued 
to develop options for our remaining coal 
assets to convert to biomass or gas, to 
provide the reliable, flexible capacity which 
we believe will be required to manage the 
increasingly volatile energy system of 
the future.

CHIEF EXECUTIVE’S REVIEW
Most recently with conﬁrmation of 
Government support for further biomass 
generation at Drax Power Station we plan 
to continue our work to develop a low-cost 
solution for a fourth biomass unit, 
accelerating the removal of coal-ﬁred 
generation from the UK electricity system, 
whilst supporting security of supply. 
GENERATION CAPACITY  
AND SYSTEM SUPPORT
2017 saw the ﬁrst full year of operation of 
our biomass unit under the Contract for 
Difference (CfD) mechanism, which provides 
index-linked revenues for renewable 
electricity out to 2027.
Our other biomass units are supported by 
the Renewable Obligation Certiﬁcate (ROC) 
mechanism which, similar to the CfD, is also 
index-linked to 2027. This acts as a premium 
above the price of power we sell from these 
units. We sell power forward to the extent 
there is liquidity in the power markets 
which, combined with our fuel hedging 
strategy, provides long-term earnings and 
revenue visibility.
Lower gas prices, higher carbon costs and 
the continued penetration of intermittent 
renewables have kept wholesale electricity 
prices subdued. 
With increasing levels of intermittent 
renewables we are continuing to see 
opportunities to extract value from flexibility 
– short-term power and balancing market 
activity, the provision of Ancillary Services 
and the value achieved from out-of-
speciﬁcation fuels. To capture value in this 
market we continue to focus resource on 
optimising availability and flexibility of both 
coal and biomass units. This whole process 
requires a high level of teamwork between 
the operational and commercial teams 
across the Group to capture and protect 
value.
Over the period 2017 to 2022 we expect to 
earn £90 million from a series of one-year 
capacity market contracts for our coal units, 
demonstrating that they still have a role 
to play. The ﬁrst of these contracts 
commenced in October 2017, adding 
£3 million to EBITDA.
Lastly, we continue to source attractively 
priced fuel cargoes – out-of-speciﬁcation 
coals and distressed cargoes, which help 
keep costs down for the business and 
consumers. We do this for both coal and 
biomass. This is a good example of how our 
commercial and operational teams work 
together to identify opportunities to create 
value for the business, as these fuels 
typically require more complex handling 
processes.

OPERATIONAL REVIEW
Overall, we delivered a good performance 
during 2017 and maintained a strong safety 
performance.
We completed a major planned outage on 
the unit supported by the CfD contract. This 
unit provides stable and reliable baseload 
renewable electricity to the network and 
long-term earnings visibility for the Group. 
The safe and efﬁcient completion of these 
complex works is a credit to those involved 
and reflects our continued focus on 
opportunities for improvement 
and efﬁciencies.
STRATEGY IN PROGRESS 
Repowering away 
from coal
Options for Drax Power Station to operate into the late 2030s and beyond 
moved up a gear in 2017 with the development of an option to repower two 
coal units to gas. Drax gave notice of the nationally signiﬁcant infrastructure 
project to the Planning Inspectorate in September 2017. One of the units 
could be eligible for the capacity market auction planned for December 2019.
Local community consultations began in November 2017 and continued 
in February 2018 on options including up to 3.6GW of new gas generation 
capacity, a gas pipeline and 200MW of battery storage in line with 
Government plans to end non-compliant coal generation by 2025 and 
Drax Group’s strategy of playing a vital role in the future energy system.

The entire organisation has responded to a 
number of challenging unplanned events. 
Most notably, in December we experienced a 
ﬁre on a section of conveyor at our biomass 
rail unloading facility and consequently an 
unplanned outage from late December 2017 
to mid-January 2018. Following investigation 
and recommissioning, the facility has 
returned to service with enhanced operating 
procedures. Although this issue did not 
relate to the operation of the biomass-
generating units, the resulting restriction 
on fuel deliveries by rail required the 
optimisation of generation across our 
biomass units, resulting in lower EBITDA 
and full year biomass availability than 
our target for the year.
FINANCIAL RESULTS
Financial performance has signiﬁcantly 
improved, with EBITDA of £238 million 
(2016: £174 million), principally due to the 
CfD mechanism.
Value from flexibility was below our target 
for the year, principally reflecting a lower 
level of Ancillary Service payments 
versus 2016.
Our operational performance drives 
the results. The ﬁnancial impact of the 
unplanned outage on the rail unloading 
facility was mitigated by optimisation of our 
available biomass and the use of additional 
generation capacity retained for self-
insurance purposes. However, this incident 
is a reminder of the need to invest 
appropriately to maintain a high level 
of operational availability and flexibility.
At the operating cost level, we have reduced 
costs reflecting the efﬁcient single outage 
and our focus on the implementation of lean 
management techniques.

B2B ENERGY SUPPLY
Our B2B Energy Supply business – 
comprised of Opus Energy and Haven Power  
– is the ﬁfth largest B2B power supplier in 
the UK. As the power system transforms, 
we will be working closely with our 
customers to help them adapt to a world 
of more decentralised and decarbonised 
power. The key factors influencing our 
business are regulation, competition and 
our operational performance.
REGULATION AND COMPETITION
The UK Government’s main focus has 
been on what it sees as unfair treatment 
of domestic consumers on legacy 
standard variable tariff (SVT) contracts. 
The Government will take forward legislation 
which will provide the regulator Ofgem with 
the authority to cap these domestic tariffs. 
SVTs are not a feature of our business. Our 
focus remains on the B2B market. At the 
microbusiness end of the market, which is 
closer in proximity to domestic, most of our 
customers are on ﬁxed price products and 
are actively rather than passively renewing 
their power supply contracts.
STRATEGY IN PROGRESS 
An innovative energy 
supplier
90% of the electricity that Opus Energy supplied last year came from clean, 
renewable sources, at no extra cost to their predominantly small and 
medium-sized business customers. For those customers who want it, 
100% renewable energy contracts are also available.
This was exactly what All Saints Church in Ascot was looking for to power 
their business. 
Assistant Church Warden, Chris Gunton, commented: “We wanted to move 
to a greener energy supplier, without paying a premium, so approached an 
energy broker for guidance. They advised us that Opus Energy were a reliable 
company with a good reputation, and when we asked for a quote they were 
the most competitive.”
It was a similar story for the Salisbury Museum, in Wiltshire. 
“We were looking for an energy supplier that offered great value, combined 
with the right length of contract and good ethics,” commented Finance 
Manager, Nicola Kilgour-Croft. “Opus Energy ticked all these boxes for us.”
Alongside supplying customers, Opus Energy has Power Purchase 
Agreements with over 2,300 independent UK renewable energy generators. 
These could be anything from a single wind turbine owned by a village 
community, to Europe’s greenest zoo, Hamerton Zoo Park.
Commented Andrew Swales, Director of Hamerton Zoo: “Working with Opus 
Energy has given us competitive prices, considerably better documentation 
and a highly efﬁcient service. We’d happily recommend them.”

PERFORMANCE REVIEW: B2B ENERGY SUPPLY CONTINUED
The B2B market remains competitive with 
65 different suppliers across the market. Our 
Haven Power and Opus Energy businesses 
offer customer-centric power, gas and 
services. We offer simplicity and flexibility 
across our products and actively engage 
with customers to help them manage their 
energy requirements and reduce carbon 
emissions. 
OPERATIONAL REVIEW
We have remained focused on delivering 
an excellent standard of customer service, 
which is central to our proposition.
February 2017 saw the completion of the 
acquisition of Opus Energy, which has made 
good progress integrating into the Group 
supported by a dedicated team, who have 
been working on systems, people and 
commercial projects to ensure our 
processes work effectively together.
In March we completed the purchase of a 
new ofﬁce facility in Northampton, enabling 
the consolidation of four Opus Energy offices 
into one and the centralisation of the 
operational teams.
Sales volumes at Opus Energy were lower 
than target, reflecting our focus on margin 
which has remained strong and customer 
renewal rates were towards the high end of 
expectation. This reflects the continued 
commitment to a strong level of customer 
service and in recognition of this Opus 
Energy was awarded Utility Provider to 
Small Businesses of the Year 2017 at the 
British Business Awards.
At Haven Power we have continued to 
focus on value-adding flexible products 
and services particularly to Industrial & 
Commercial customers whose needs 
extend beyond commodity supply. This is 
demonstrated through our ability to help 
customers manage and optimise their 
power consumption proﬁles through 
collaboration with our carefully selected 
partners. Through better systems and 
services, customer targeting and a keener 
focus on cost to serve we are driving 
efﬁciencies and improved margin at 
Haven Power.
Following the acquisition of Opus Energy the 
major Enterprise Resource Platform (ERP) 
system upgrade was re-planned which has 
led to a revised timeline from Q2 2018 onwards.
We continue to actively manage credit 
risk by assessing the ﬁnancial strength 
of customers and applying rigorous credit 
management processes, with a strong 
focus continuing to be placed on billing 
and cash collection.
Health and safety remains an area of focus 
for the business and we continue to target 
a reduction in the level of recordable incidents.
FINANCIAL RESULTS
Financial performance has signiﬁcantly 
improved, with EBITDA of £29 million 
in line with our guidance (2016: £4 million 
negative). This was principally due to the 
acquisition of Opus Energy, which added 
10 months of EBITDA, but also improved 
ﬁnancial performance from Haven Power, 
which was ahead of plan. 
Third Party Costs (TPCs) include grid 
charges, the cost of meeting our obligations 
under the Renewable Obligation (RO) and 
small-scale Feed-in-Tariff schemes. Grid 
charges include distribution, transmission 
and system balancing costs. TPCs have 
continued to increase and now account 
for 50% of revenue.
Total operating costs have risen with the 
acquisition of Opus Energy. We remain 
conﬁdent that over time the beneﬁts of 
common platforms and knowledge sharing 
will lead to efﬁciencies.
LOOKING AHEAD
In 2018 we will focus on Opus Energy 
on-boarding, systems development and 
the roll out of smart meters. 
We continue to see opportunities for EBITDA 
growth in the B2B markets, which we will 
deliver through our customer-focused 
supply proposition.

OUTLOOK
Our focus in 2018 remains on the delivery 
of our strategy and long-term ambitions for 
earnings growth, underpinned by safety, 
sustainability, operational excellence and 
expertise in our markets. We also recognise 
that being the most efﬁcient operator in each 
of our markets is a key factor in our success.
Our objective in Pellet Production remains 
the commissioning of LaSalle, the 
production of good quality pellets at the 
lowest cost, cross-supply chain optimisation 
and identifying attractive options to 
increase self-supply.
Our biomass proposition is strong – reliable, 
flexible, low-carbon renewable electricity 
and system support which, combined with 
an effective fuel hedging strategy, will 
provide long-term earnings visibility. We 
remain focused on ways to increase supply 
chain efﬁciency and make biomass 
competitive beyond 2027. As part of this we 
remain focused on the optimisation of our 
assets in the US Gulf and reduction in pellet 
cost. To support this focus we are moving 
our US headquarters from Atlanta to 
Monroe, Louisiana, which beneﬁts from 
a much closer proximity to these assets.
In Power Generation, we continue to explore 
ways to optimise our existing operations, 
whilst meeting the needs of the changing 
UK electricity system.
We remain supportive of the UK 
Government’s decarbonisation targets and 
will continue our work to deliver four OCGTs 
and a low-cost biomass unit conversion 
utilising existing infrastructure at Drax 
Power Station, alongside developing the 
option to repowering the remaining coal 
units to gas.
In B2B Energy Supply, we will continue to 
grow our B2B offering, with signiﬁcant 
opportunities to grow market share. At 
the same time, we will invest in supporting 
infrastructure to ensure we can continue 
to grow, offer market-leading digital 
propositions and smart metering services.

ETHICS AND INTEGRITY
At Drax Group we believe in doing the right 
thing. We are committed to conducting 
business with honesty and integrity, and we 
comply with all relevant laws and regulations. 
We do not tolerate any form of bribery, 
corruption or improper business conduct. 
Our compliance framework sets out the 
ethical principles that our people must 
uphold, as outlined in the Group ethics guide, 
Doing the Right Thing. The framework was 
updated in 2017 to reflect new legislation 
and to encourage whistleblowing in all 
appropriate circumstances.
The framework is underpinned by policies 
and procedures. Our principles regarding 
ethics, integrity and anti-bribery and 
corruption are supported by the Group 
corporate crime policy. Compliance is 
overseen by the Group Ethics and Business 
Conduct Committee (EBCC). Internal and 
external audits ensure compliance with our 
ethical principles. Corporate Compliance 
also conducts an annual Bribery Act risk 
assessment. 
We expect the same high standards from 
everyone we work with in the United 
Kingdom, United States and elsewhere. 
Third parties are subject to our due diligence 
checks at the time of contracting and on an 
ongoing basis through continual monitoring 
(via our third party due diligence solution).
ANTI-BRIBERY AND CORRUPTION
Our internal processes ensure consistency 
with our zero tolerance approach to bribery 
and corruption. Requests to do business in 
new countries pass through our country risk 
process. Medium and high scoring countries 
are reviewed by the Currency and 
Commodity Risk Management Committee 
(CCRMC), as required. Associated 
counterparties are then put forward for 
our due diligence process. We refresh due 
diligence for high risk counterparties on an 
annual basis and all other counterparties are 
evaluated every three years. In 2017, Drax 
Group was not involved in any legal cases 
related to corruption and bribery.
WHISTLEBLOWING
We encourage anyone with a concern to 
speak out and report concerns through our 
whistleblowing procedure. Employees can 
raise issues through internal channels and 
an anonymous, third-party hotline is 
available to internal and external 
stakeholders. Should concerns be raised, 
we have a strict non-retaliation policy. 
During 2017 there was one whistleblowing 
case which was raised. Two investigations 
were carried out, one by the local business 
and one by the Group team, neither ﬁnding 
any evidence that Company policy and 
procedures had been breached.

BUILDING A SUSTAINABLE BUSINESS CONTINUED
Energy Awards 2017, and named the UK’s 
best performing energy supplier by Third 
Party Intermediaries (TPIs) in this year’s 
Cornwall Insight Report. Opus Energy won 
“Utilities Provider of the Year” at the British 
Small Business Awards 2017(1) and was 
shortlisted in the National Business Awards 
2017. 
Our B2B Energy Supply businesses support 
customers to be more sustainable. Haven 
Power offers industrial and commercial 
customers 100% renewable electricity at 
an affordable price, powered by biomass 
supplied from Drax Power. Opus Energy 
offers SME businesses renewable energy, 
makes it easy for them to switch suppliers 
and reduce their energy costs.
Opus Energy also buys energy from 
renewable generators across the UK, from 
sources including wind turbines, solar panels 
and anaerobic digestion plants. In 2017 
this amounted to 992GWh of renewable 
energy generated from 2,300 generators.
A LOWER CARBON COMPANY
As a major electricity producer, we have a 
signiﬁcant role to play in the transition to a 
low carbon future. We are determined to 
continue to reduce our carbon emissions 
while providing the power the economy 
requires.
Climate change poses both risks and 
opportunities for Drax Group. To reduce 
the risks to our business, we are committed 
to reducing our operational carbon 
emissions and emissions from our supply 
chain, by transitioning away from coal 
and using sustainable biomass, as well as 
investing in lower carbon energy sources 
such as Open Cycle Gas Turbine (OCGT) 
generation plants. We are also exploring 
innovative battery technology. We are 
enabling the use of solar and wind energy, 
with our biomass, gas and potential 
battery storage options all supporting the 
capacity and stability of the UK energy 
grid, providing services such as voltage 
control, frequency response and inertia.
We recognise that investors and other 
stakeholders increasingly require clear 
information about the climate change risks 
to our business and we are fully committed 
to transparent disclosure of climate 
information. We welcomed the 
Government’s Clean Growth Strategy to 
ensure a green economy and energy are 
at the heart of the UK’s industry strategy. 
We believe this will provide certainty for 
businesses investing in lower-carbon and 
renewable capacity, and incentivise the 
development of new lower-carbon 
technology. The signiﬁcant investments 
we have made to upgrade our units to 
renewable biomass, coupled with a 
reduction in coal-ﬁred generation, 
have resulted in a 73% reduction in 
carbon emissions since 2012.
Carbon Emissions
We calculate and report our carbon 
emissions in accordance with the 
Companies Act 2006 and the European 
Union Emissions Trading System (EU ETS), 
as disclosed in Table 1.
We are also required to disclose emissions 
from biologically sequestered carbon, which 
includes emissions released through the 
combustion of biomass to generate 
electricity. These emissions are shown in 
Table 2. The ﬁgures do not take into account 
the CO2 that has been absorbed from the 
atmosphere during the growth of feedstocks 
which are used to manufacture the biomass 
pellets used at Drax to generate electricity.
The biogenic CO2 emissions resulting from 
power generation are counted as zero in 
ofﬁcial reporting to both UK authorities and 
under the EU ETS as the use of sustainable 
biomass is considered to be carbon neutral 
at the point of combustion. This 
methodology originates from the United 
Nations Framework Convention on Climate 
Change (UNFCCC).
The majority of our emissions result from the 
process of using solid fuel. This can make it 
difﬁcult to identify other smaller trends that 
are still signiﬁcant. To counteract this 
dominance and to ensure we retain a 
balance between highlighting signiﬁcant 
developments and providing meaningful 
data, we have adopted a materiality 
threshold of 100,000 tonnes of CO2.

STRATEGY IN PROGRESS 
Providing customers with 
great value and good ethics
Founded in 1860, Salisbury Museum is located in a Grade I listed building 
opposite Salisbury Cathedral. As a charitable, not-for-proﬁt organisation, 
the museum relies on entry fees, grants, donations and the support of its 
members to continue its vital work. Finding a business energy supplier that 
offered the best prices on the market, as well as the right length of contract 
and good ethics, was important for the museum.
SMEs are a key part of the business and we know that a business energy 
service that is as smooth and efﬁcient as possible is a top priority. Nicola 
Kilgour-Croft, Finance Manager at Salisbury Museum, commented: “The 
switching process went through really smoothly, and the facility to receive 
invoices via email means I don’t need to spend time on the phone trying to 
sort out payment. Having 12-month contracts really works for us.”

In 2017, our electricity generated from 
sustainable biomass was 13 TWh, an increase 
of 300MW from 2016. However, our Scope 1 
fossil fuel combustion emissions have 
increased by 2%. This can in part be 
attributed to the ﬁre at our Power 
Generation biomass unloading facilities in 
December, which did cause an unplanned 
outage at two of our biomass units
Biomass Supply Chain Emissions
We monitor every step in the supply chain to 
ensure that our sustainability standards are 
being met and that greenhouse gas (GHG) 
emissions associated with producing our 
biomass are calculated according to the 
regulatory requirements.
Emissions from each stage and in each 
different supply region are calculated and 
reported. The most signiﬁcant GHG impacts 
in the biomass supply chain are the 
electricity used in pelletisation and the sea 
freight emissions in transport. Pellet mills are 
ideally located close to the forest resource 
and close to ports in order to minimise 
transport emissions.
The UK Government has set a limit on the 
maximum supply chain GHG emissions 
permitted in order for biomass to be eligible 
for support under the Renewables 
Obligation. The current limit for CO2 
emissions from life cycle analysis of biomass 
supplies is 79.2g CO2/MJ – reducing to 50g 
CO2/MJ by 2025.
In 2017, the average supply chain 
greenhouse gas emissions from all of Drax’s 
biomass supplies amounted to 36g CO2/MJ. 
This is an increase of 6% compared with 
2016 because we sourced a higher 
proportion of our biomass supplies from the 
US. The UK Government has provided a 
benchmark ﬁgure for GHG emissions from 
coal which is 256.9g CO2/MJ; therefore in 
the 2016–17 compliance year Drax saved 
around 86% of CO2 emissions compared to 
the coal benchmark.

BUILDING A SUSTAINABLE BUSINESS CONTINUED
RESPONSIBLE SOURCING
Being a responsible business means we 
source raw materials, including important 
resources such as sustainable biomass and 
coal, in a responsible manner. We aim to treat 
suppliers fairly and pay them promptly. We 
expect our suppliers to uphold the same high 
ethical standards we apply to our business, 
which are outlined in our Group ethics guide, 
Doing the Right Thing. 
SUSTAINABLE BIOMASS
We believe the best way to ensure our 
biomass is sustainable and legal is through  
a combination of proactive supplier 
engagement, third party certiﬁcation and 
our own audits and checks. We rely on a 
number of forest certiﬁcation programmes, 
including the Sustainable Forest Initiative 
(SFI), Forest Stewardship Council® (FSC®)(1), 
the Programme for the Endorsement of 
Forest Certiﬁcation (PEFC) and Sustainable 
Biomass Program (SBP).
Our requirements are laid out in our Group 
sustainability policy: www.drax.com/
sustainability/sustainability-policy/. We 
adhere to the UK Government criteria for 
sustainable biomass, the Forest Europe 
Sustainable Forest Management Criteria and 
we comply with the European Union Timber 
Regulation (EUTR).
The Group Director of Corporate Affairs has 
overall responsibility for ensuring biomass 
meets the Government’s sustainability 
criteria. Cases requiring special attention 
are escalated to the Ethics and Business 
Conduct Committee (EBCC) or the 
Executive Committee.
An example of this in 2017 was when new 
information came to light on one of our 
suppliers through an SBP audit report. 
Background information collected during 
preparation for SBP assessment highlighted 
that our supplier had not provided us with 
the most accurate information regarding 
harvesting locations. Without this, we 
cannot carry out the regional risk-based 
assessment required under the legislation.
Although the volume in question was low, 
we halted deliveries until our supplier could 
properly identify the material and we could 
carry out the appropriate due diligence.
In 2017, Drax Group started a review 
and update of our policy with various 
stakeholders to ensure that it is still relevant 
and addresses the key biomass sustainability 
issues. We also asked the non-proﬁt TFT 
(The Forest Trust, www.tft-earth.org) to visit 
our key supply regions to examine local 
challenges and identify opportunities 
for improved environmental and social 
performance. TFT is a UK-registered charity 
working with other global companies to 
improve the environmental and social 
impact of their supply chains.
Maintaining forest carbon stocks
Ensuring that forest carbon stocks are 
maintained, or not adversely impacted by 
biomass demand, is one of the requirements 
of the UK Government’s criteria for 
sustainable biomass. Drax only sources 
sustainable biomass from working forests. 
We regularly monitor forest inventory data, 
in addition to our detailed certiﬁcation and 
auditing process, to ensure that biomass 
demand is having a positive impact on 
regional forest industries.
 
Recent analysis of historical trends in the 
southern US has shown that as demand 
for wood products increased over the last 
60 years, management practices have also 
improved to increase forest growth rates 
and more than double the amount of carbon 
stored in the working forest from 4 billion m3 
to 8.4 billion m3.(2)
Healthy markets for wood products have 
led to an increase in forest growth (carbon 
sequestration) and stored carbon. The total 
growing stock in the forests of the 28 EU 
member states increased by 7.4 billion m3 
between 1990 and 2015, an increase of 
38%(3). Over this same period, total 
production of roundwood (harvesting) also 
increased by 103 million m3, around 29%(4). 
This demonstrates that increasing demand 
for wood products and increased harvesting 
does not necessarily lead to deforestation or 
lower forest carbon stocks.
The continual cycle of sustainable forest 
management, production of wood products, 
improving management practice and 
increased sequestration of atmospheric 
carbon leads to substantial GHG beneﬁts. 
These beneﬁts are even greater when 
compared to the linear emissions associated 
with burning coal.
OUR BIOMASS SUSTAINABILITY 
REQUIREMENTS
 – Group sustainability policy – in place 
since 2008, our policy covers our core 
sustainability values on protecting 
biodiversity, reduction of greenhouse 
gas emissions and contribution to 
social values.
 – UK Government criteria for sustainable 
biomass – we report monthly on 
compliance with the UK sustainability 
criteria, including life cycle emissions 
limits and the land criteria. This covers 
the requirements of the Forest Europe 
Sustainable Forest Management 
criteria, including: maintaining forest 
area and carbon stocks; encouraging 
the production of forest products; 
maintaining the forest ecosystem 
health and vitality; conserving and 
enhancing biological diversity; 
contributing socio-economic beneﬁts; 
and ensuring that soil and water 
protection is maintained.
 – European Union Timber Regulation – 
in place since 2013, the EUTR requires 
purchasers of wood products to have 
coherent due diligence processes in 
place to ensure a negligible risk of 
trading illegally logged timber.

How we ensure sustainable biomass 
sourcing
Drax has developed a rigorous process 
to ensure that new and existing biomass 
suppliers demonstrate that all sustainability 
and legal requirements are being met. Our 
eight key stages for ensuring compliance 
are: chain of custody; supplier audits; the 
EUTR legality assessment; GHG life 
cycle assessment and monitoring; the 
sustainability data return (SDR) captured 
in the contract; the SDR and annual 
declaration; regional and country risk 
assessments; and supplier relationship 
management and monitoring. These stages 
are implemented in an ongoing cycle to provide 
robust evidence across each element.
Our due diligence process always begins 
with a regional risk assessment, which 
identiﬁes high-level risks such as 
deforestation or illegal logging, corruption 
and issues with workers’ rights. This ensures 
focus on these high risks and that they are 
mitigated. These reports are renewed every 
three years, or more frequently if there is 
cause for concern, to ensure that we always 
stay on top of developing issues.
This is followed by a sustainability data 
return (SDR), where we ask each supplier 43 
detailed questions about all aspects of their 
supply chain and they are required to provide 
documentary evidence to support their 
answers. This sustainability declaration 
subsequently forms part of the contract 
between Drax and the supplier.
Our supplier audit process
Each new supplier is subject to an 
independent audit before pellets can be 
delivered. Existing suppliers are audited at 
least once every three to four years. The 
audit requires the supplier to pass a series 
of detailed environmental and social checks 
along the whole length of their supply chain 
and pellet manufacturing process. Findings 
are categorised into three priorities: high, 
medium and low.
High-priority ﬁndings can result in 
termination of a supplier agreement. 
Medium-priority ﬁndings result in the 
supplier being given a set timescale within 
which to rectify them. Low-priority issues 
highlight areas where our independent 
auditors believe suppliers have room to 
improve their practices. Drax engages with 
our suppliers to share best practice and 
support and encourage improvements 
to procedures.
The Sustainable Biomass Program
Alternatively, suppliers can evidence the 
necessary sustainability requirements 
through Sustainable Biomass Program (SBP) 
certiﬁcation, as SBP-compliant material has 
been benchmarked by Ofgem to fully meet 
the UK sustainability requirements. If a 
supplier can provide all of their biomass to 
Drax with an SBP compliant biomass claim, 
Drax does not require an audit to be carried 
out and the supplier can progress through 
the process much faster. We encourage our 
suppliers to move towards SBP certiﬁcation 
and we aim to achieve 90% SBP-compliant 
material by the end of 2018.
Drax Power is certiﬁed under the SBP Chain 
of Custody standard. In 2017, 2.7 million 
tonnes of Drax Power’s sourced biomass 
came from SBP-certiﬁed pellet mills. 
Drax Biomass is an SBP-certiﬁed 
Biomass Producer.
DRAX POWER SUPPLIER AUDIT AND SBP 
FIGURES FOR 2017  (1)
Suppliers assessed through
Drax audit process 
12.8%
SBP-certiﬁed suppliers 
87.2%
The number of audits has decreased since 
2016 because increasingly more audits are 
covered by SBP. In 2017, 69.6% of our 
biomass suppliers were in the audit cycle. 
34 of the 56 pellet mills we sourced from 
were SBP certiﬁed and were audited by an 
independent third party. In addition, we 
carried out ﬁve ﬁrst party audits by Drax 
staff and six third party audits by 
independent auditors. In 2017, three of the 
suppliers that we audited did not meet our 
standards and as a result we made the 
decision not to contract them.
Forest management certiﬁcation
In addition to the Drax internal process and 
third party SBP certiﬁcation, sustainability 
can also be demonstrated through Forest 
Management (FM) certiﬁcation. This 
conﬁrms that the forest is being managed in 
a way that preserves the natural ecosystem 
and beneﬁts the lives of local people and 
workers, while ensuring it sustains economic 
viability. In 2017, Drax Power purchased 
1.3 million tonnes of wood ﬁbre from 
FM-certiﬁed forests, 20% of our total supply 
of pellets.
FM certiﬁcation may be difﬁcult to achieve 
for some types of forest owners and, for this 
reason, a secondary level of assessment 
called Controlled Wood is available. This 
ensures that wood ﬁbre is not: illegally 
harvested; harvested in violation of 
traditional and human rights; harvested in 
forests in which high conservation values 
are threatened by management activities; 
harvested in forests being converted to 
plantations or non-forest use; or from 
forests in which genetically modiﬁed trees 
are planted. In 2017, Drax Power purchased 
4.9 million tonnes of wood ﬁbre from 
Controlled Wood sources.
Chain of Custody
Once certiﬁed, Chain of Custody (CoC) can 
be used as a mechanism for tracking wood 
ﬁbre from the forest to the ﬁnal product and 
destination. Each supplier in the chain must 
have a documented system to be able to 
identify and trace the wood ﬁbre at each 
stage. Drax requires that all of its suppliers 
achieve CoC certiﬁcation before contracts 
are signed and pellets can be delivered. 
At Drax Power, our key biomass buyers, 
logistics, legal and communications 
employees are required to complete 
Chain of Custody training with the 
sustainability team.

ENSURING A COAL-FREE FUTURE
Reducing our reliance on coal
Our business is changing rapidly. Today 
we have cut our coal consumption by 72%, 
from 9.8 million tonnes in 2011 to 2.7 million 
tonnes in 2017, with three units upgraded 
to run on renewable biomass.
Given the UK Government’s policy decision 
to remove coal from the nation’s energy 
system by 2025, we are preparing for a 
post-coal future. Our goal is to replace coal 
with alternative lower-carbon fuels (subject 
to alternative generation being available). 
In June 2017 we announced plans to consult 
on upgrading two of the remaining coal-ﬁred 
units at Drax Power Station to become 
gas-powered generating plants. This is in 
addition to our plans to construct four 
fast-response Open Cycle Gas Turbine 
(OCGT) generation plants at new sites 
across England and Wales.
The upgraded gas-powered units could 
provide flexible and reliable electricity for 
the UK’s homes and businesses and facilitate 
other investments in renewable energy such 
as wind and solar power by helping to bridge 
intermittent renewable supplies.
In January 2018 the UK government 
conﬁrmed support for conversion of a fourth 
unit to biomass fuel. The conversion of unit 4 
will complete during 2018 allowing us to 
optimise generation across three ROC 
accredited units.
Sourcing coal responsibly 
Transitioning away from coal is challenging 
and will take time. In the meantime, we must 
continue to secure reliable and responsible 
sources of coal. Our coal sourcing approach 
is strictly governed by our compliance, 
sustainability and risk teams. Drax’s 
corporate social responsibility (CSR) 
statement sets out the legal, ethical, 
environmental and social standards we 
expect of our suppliers. Requirements are 
also set out in our contracts, including our 
preference for Bettercoal.
THE BETTERCOAL INITIATIVE
Bettercoal is a global, not-for-proﬁt 
initiative established by a group of  
major utilities to promote the 
continuous improvement of corporate 
responsibility in the coal supply chain 
www.bettercoal.org.
We buy coal only from known sources and 
from suppliers that are transparent about 
origin mines. Any jurisdictions we source 
from are vetted against our policies. In 2017, 
31% of the coal we used came from UK deep 
and surface mines, with the remainder 
coming predominantly from the US, 
Colombia and Russia. Where possible, we 
use pond ﬁnes (the ﬁltered residue of coal 
washings) and other advantaged fuels to 
reduce the amount of raw coal extracted 
and burned. 
As we look to the future, coal sourcing will 
continue to be governed by our focus on 
responsible sourcing. Origins will be 
determined by balancing quality and 
economics. Where possible, we source 
from Bettercoal-engaged mines. 
We carry out due diligence to ensure coal is 
supplied in line with our CSR policy and carry 
out visits to suppliers’ sites. Where our 
checks raise any “red flags” we undertake 
enhanced due diligence and commission 
third party investigations. Results and 
concerns are reviewed by Drax’s Ethics and 
Business Conduct Committee if necessary.
Partnering with others to raise standards
We work with a range of stakeholders to try 
and improve standards in the coal industry. 
For example, we engage with coal suppliers 
through conferences and through our 
membership of industry initiatives such as 
Bettercoal. In 2017, we attended conferences 
with large suppliers such as Cerrejón, to 
understand developments in their 
sustainability approach. We also enhanced 
our risk assessment process by capturing 
key questions on potential risks to revisit 
with suppliers. 
The Bettercoal initiative works with coal 
suppliers to encourage continuous 
improvements in social, ethical and 
environmental standards. Suppliers 
complete a self-assessment process and 
are independently audited against the 
Bettercoal Code by approved assessors. We 
make it clear in supplier contracts that we 
prefer to source Bettercoal. Results from 
Bettercoal assessments form part of our 
supply chain due diligence procedures and 
any new information on suppliers is reviewed 
by Drax’s procurement and compliance teams. 
In 2017, 23% of the coal we sourced was 
Bettercoal. As a member of the Technical & 
Advisory Committee (TAC), in 2017 we 
worked with other members to further 
develop rigorous procedures, protocols 
and assurance in the Bettercoal system.

REDUCE OUR ENVIRONMENTAL IMPACT
We are committed to managing, monitoring 
and reducing our environmental impact and 
the Group environment policy outlines our 
approach. Our Environmental Management 
System (EMS) covering Drax Power Station 
and its associated ash disposal site is 
certiﬁed to IS0 14001. We are committed to 
complying with all relevant environmental 
legislation and there were no major or minor 
breaches to our environmental permits at 
Drax Power in 2017.
In addition to carbon, we manage our other 
emissions to air including sulphur dioxide 
(SO2), nitrogen oxides (NOX) and particulates. 
Managing the use of water and other natural 
resources, along with disposal of waste, is 
also important across our business. We aim 
to protect biodiversity both at our own sites 
and through our biomass sourcing.
POSITIVE SOCIAL IMPACT
We strive to have a positive social impact in 
the communities and countries in which we 
operate, through the jobs we provide, our 
wider economic contribution, the tax we pay 
and the education and charity projects we 
support. Communicating effectively with 
people is a vital aspect of being a successful 
business and we aim to be transparent and 
open. We are in constant dialogue with our 
local communities and the diverse group of 
stakeholders affected by our business 
(see page 42, Stakeholder Engagement).
In 2017, we commissioned Oxford Economics 
to analyse Drax’s economic footprint across 
the UK. The researchers found that Drax 
contributed an estimated £1.67 billion to the 
UK economy in 2016, through the 18,500 
people we directly employ, the supply chain 
we support and the goods and services we 
purchase. 
Local recruitment is important to us. Opus 
Energy works with a network of education 
providers in Northampton to recruit local 
talent for apprenticeships in business 
administration and its graduate programme 
in the areas of risk management and IT. In 
the United States, our business activities 
have helped to revitalise communities which 
have lost jobs in traditional industries, such 
as pulp and paper, and our Pellet Production 
business provides a steady income for 
landowners who supply us with low-grade 
wood.
We also make a positive contribution by 
investing in skills and education projects, 
particularly in STEM (science, technology, 
engineering and maths) subjects which are 
aligned to our future business needs. In 2017 
we supported education projects to develop 
STEM skills in schools and through 
apprenticeships to nurture the STEM skills 
and talents of young people.
Our businesses support local projects 
through fundraising, partnerships and 
volunteering. Each business has strong links 
to its local communities and we focus our 
charitable support on the areas where we 
operate. During 2017, the Group donated a 
total of £185,888 to a range of charities 
and £53,465 to non-charitable causes.
We take a responsible approach to managing 
our tax affairs and we will always comply 
with applicable tax laws and regulations in 
the countries in which we operate. In 2017 
we paid taxes of more than £150 million. 
These included taxes on our proﬁts, taxes on 
our workforce, taxes levied for burning fossil 
fuels as well as environmental taxes. This 
ﬁgure excludes VAT.
CASE STUDY
American Tree Farm
The majority of forestlands in the southern US are privately owned 
(86%) and two-thirds of these forests are owned by families and 
individuals. The American Tree Farm System (ATFS), administered by  
the American Forest Foundation, was established over 75 years ago 
to provide support and recognition to these non-corporate landowners 
who play such a key role in forest sustainability. Today, the 74,000 tree 
farmers across the US manage approximately 20.5 million acres of 
forestland. The programme has evolved into an internationally 
recognised, third party veriﬁed certiﬁcation standard sanctioned by 
the Programme for the Endorsement of Forest Certiﬁcation (PEFC) 
standards. The ATFS now provides a means by which family tree 
farmers can be recognised and rewarded in the marketplace for 
meeting rigorous sustainability standards analogous to large 
corporate owners certiﬁed to Sustainable Forestry Initiative (SFI) 
or Forest Stewardship Council (FSC) standard.

CASE STUDY
Restoring Brickmakers’ 
Wood
The Eden-Rose Coppice Trust is a woodland network that 
transforms urban environmental disasters into beautiful, natural 
high-biodiversity woodland settings for people living with a terminal 
illness. Haven Power has been supporting the Trust’s ambitious 
Brickmakers’ Wood project in Ipswich since April 2016.
Brickmakers’ Wood is a three-and-a-half-acre site that is 
being transformed into a peaceful space for cancer patients, 
disadvantaged children and people with mental or physical health 
problems and learning difﬁculties. Throughout 2017, up to 12 Haven 
Power employees spent time volunteering at the project each 
month. Volunteers contributed to the restoration of the site and 
relished getting their hands dirty, clearing rubbish and dense 
overgrowth, building new structures, creating an allotment 
and planting wild flowers.
Without Haven Power’s contribution, the charity founders would 
have had to undertake most of the work at Brickmakers’ Wood 
themselves. In their words: “The continual volunteering has 
transformed the project, so we are now two to three years 
ahead of where we would have been otherwise.”
The site is being transformed into a town centre oasis and has 
already been put to good use. The charity has run skills workshops 
for 12–16 year-olds who have been excluded from school, 
encouraging them to learn about woodcraft and how to run 
a business.

PEOPLE AND CULTURE
Drax Group maintains high standards in its 
employment practices and all our employees 
beneﬁt from a range of policies to support 
them in the workplace. These include 
policies designed to enable different work 
and lifestyle preferences, processes whereby 
employees can raise grievances or concerns 
about safety, along with supporting a diverse 
and inclusive workplace.
As at 31 September 2017, Drax Group 
employed a total number of 2,558 people 
and almost all our employees were on 
permanent contracts.
Of the total, 1,714 were male and 844 were 
female. There were eight Board directors 
(one female) and three members of the 
Executive Committee who were not 
directors (one female).
Diversity and inclusion
Drax Group is fully committed to the 
elimination of unlawful and unfair 
discrimination and values the differences 
that a diverse workforce brings to the 
organisation. Our goal is to create and 
maintain a working environment that is 
supportive of all our people and where every 
employee has the opportunity to realise his 
or her potential. We believe that a 
commitment to diversity is critical to 
achieving our strategic goals. We are 
determined to be a place where employees, 
customers and suppliers alike feel respected, 
comfortable and supported in all their diversity.
Employee representation  
and engagement
Overall, 22% of the workforce across the 
Group is covered by collective bargaining. 
We have representative employee 
consultation and information arrangements 
in place for those employees who have 
individual employment contracts.
We communicate with employees through 
a range of channels, including our internal 
intranet, quarterly newsletter and Open 
Forum meetings. We track employee 
engagement through our opinion surveys. 
The 2016 survey of all UK and US employees 
(prior to Opus Energy joining the Group) was 
completed by 79% of employees. Key issues 
raised included the need for clearer learning 
and development programmes and more 
effective communication. The results were 
used to inform the development of our new 
people strategy. The next employee 
engagement survey will take place in 2018.

Our people strategy
In 2017, we launched our new Group-wide 
people strategy, One Drax. The strategy 
focuses on valuing our people, driving business 
performance and developing talent to deliver 
our strategic and operational objectives. 
LABOUR AND HUMAN RIGHTS
Our commitment to the protection of human 
rights includes not tolerating the use of 
underage workers or forced labour. This is 
captured in our ethics guide, “Doing the 
Right Thing”, in our Corporate Crime policy 
and our corporate social responsibility 
(CSR) statement.
Our CSR statement outlines the standard 
of ethical business conduct we expect from 
suppliers. Businesses in our supply chain 
should offer a safe workplace for their 
employees that is free from harm, intimidation, 
harassment and fear. We have incorporated 
further provisions into our statement 
template to manage and reduce these risks 
within our procurement contracts. 
We encourage suppliers and contractors 
working on our behalf to challenge unethical 
behaviour and promote a “speak up” culture.
MODERN SLAVERY
In 2017 we published our ﬁrst statement to 
comply with the UK Modern Slavery Act. This 
describes the steps we are taking to reduce 
the risk of modern slavery in our supply 
chain. We have added modern slavery 
awareness to our programme of regular 
training for contract managers, provided 
classroom-based training to higher-risk 
teams and reviewed our counterparty due 
diligence processes. Our most recent 
statement is available on our website.
HEALTH, SAFETY AND WELLBEING
The Drax Group approach is outlined in our 
Group Health and Safety policy.
www.drax.com/about-us/health-and-safety/
Each business unit and corporate team 
has local arrangements in place, appropriate 
to the operating environment and hazards 
inherent in the workplace, to ensure that 
high standards are set and maintained.
We have well-established Safety 
Management Systems (SMS) in place to 
ensure safe workplaces for all our people. At 
Drax Power, the SMS is certiﬁed to OHSAS 
18001 and subject to regular compliance 
reviews, the last of which took place in 2017. 
At Drax Biomass, the SMS meets the 
requirements of OHSAS 18001 and the 
United States certiﬁcation ANSI Z10.
Safety performance is reported and 
reviewed regularly by local management 
teams, the Executive Committee and the 
Board. Each incident is comprehensively 
analysed and reviewed, lessons learnt are 
shared with employees and actions are 
taken to mitigate the risk of future failures. 
At Drax Power, a weekly safety update is 
uploaded to our intranet and at Drax 
Biomass, information is made available 
to employees through a health and safety 
online portal. 
The Board receives monthly reports which 
include Lost Time Injury Rates (LTIR), Total 
Recordable Injury Rates (TRIR) and numbers 
of Reporting of Injuries, Diseases and 
Dangerous Occurrences Regulations 
(RIDDORs) (or US equivalent) for the Group. 
TRIR is included in the Group scorecard. 
The results for 2017 were in line with targets, 
but the number of incidents increased from 
previous years, partly reflecting the 
increased headcount of the Group.
While the Group’s TRIR remained on target 
in 2017, the incident at our biomass rail 
unloading facilities in December did cause 
a ﬁre. It highlighted once again that the 
risks of generating using biomass must be 
mitigated through robust safety procedures 
and a risk-based plant investment and 
maintenance programme.

We engage with a range of people who 
are directly or indirectly involved in our 
business and affected by what we do.
IDENTIFYING STAKEHOLDERS 
Like many businesses we have a diverse 
group of stakeholders who are affected by 
our activities across the United Kingdom, 
Europe and the US. These include our 
shareholders, employees, customers, 
suppliers, communities, government 
regulators and policymakers, academia, 
non-governmental organisations, opinion 
formers and the media.
We communicate with different audiences 
regularly and keep track of stakeholder 
relationships. We use stakeholder feedback 
to inform the planning and delivery of our 
business activities. 
We conduct an ongoing mapping exercise 
to assess how the stakeholder landscape is 
developing and to ensure we are recognising 
the expectations of a broad range of 
stakeholders and that across our businesses 
we do the right thing every day.
 Investor engagement is discussed

PUBLIC AFFAIRS
It is vital to our business that we develop 
and maintain good relationships with 
governments, regulators and individuals 
in public life.
No party political donations were made in 
the UK or elsewhere in 2017 or 2016 and 
our interactions with those engaged in the 
political arena were aimed solely at the 
promotion of the Group’s business interests.
What counts as political expenditure 
within the EU encompasses a wide range 
of activities, many of which would not be 
considered as political in the normal 
sense. For that reason, in order to avoid 
inadvertently breaching EU legislation, Drax 
presents a resolution at its Annual General 
Meeting to seek shareholders’ approval for 
expenditure of up to £100,000 by the 
Company and its subsidiaries.

COMMUNICATING WITH STAKEHOLDERS
Communicating effectively is a vital aspect 
of being a successful business. Honesty is 
one of the Drax core behaviours and we aim 
to be transparent and open. 
Drax has a long history of engaging with 
people, businesses and local authorities. 
We engage with stakeholders and partner 
with many other organisations to make 
progress on sustainability topics throughout 
the year. We use the most appropriate 
communication channels to listen to our 
stakeholders and ensure they can access 
the information they need about our policies, 
practices and strategic direction.
The table below summarises our key 
stakeholder engagement activities in 2017

Key engagement activities in 2017
Overview of topics raised
Government 
and regulators
We regularly engage with regulators and policymakers to ensure our business 
understands and contributes to the evolving regulatory agenda. 
We engage with the UK Government, particularly the Department for Business, 
Energy, Innovation and Skills and Her Majesty’s Treasury, on a range of topics 
including: the importance of biomass sustainability; carbon price support; the future 
of coal; the decarbonisation, decentralisation and digitisation of the energy sector; 
and innovation, training and skills.
We engaged with representatives from the European Commission, European 
Parliament and Council of Ministers to inform the development of pan-European 
sustainability criteria for biomass as part of the Renewable Energy Directive II. The 
Directive is expected to be ﬁnalised in early 2018.
 – European Union’s 
biomass sustainability 
policy
 – Ofgem’s Targeted 
Charging Review
 – Closure of unabated coal 
power stations
 – Controlling the costs 
of biomass under the 
Renewable Obligation
Non-governmental 
organisations (NGOs)
NGOs play an important part in challenging our thinking and we engage with 
representatives from a number of leading UK and international NGOs active on 
climate and energy issues.
In November, we invited a number of NGOs and other stakeholders to two 
roundtables in London and Brussels to discuss our approach to biomass 
sustainability. The roundtables were facilitated by leading environmentalist 
Tony Juniper, who presented on his recent fact-ﬁnding visit to Drax’s Biomass 
operations in the United States.
Drax Biomass conducted a stakeholder consultation on risks associated with wood 
ﬁbre procurement, as part of its efforts to meet the standards set out by the 
Sustainable Biomass Program (SBP) and the Forest Stewardship Council (FSC).
 – Emissions to air, including 
particulates
 – Closure of coal 
generation
 – Carbon Price Support
Regulator and network 
businesses
We have engaged with Ofgem and National Grid on the need to deliver a secure and 
reliable network at least cost to the consumer, in addition to promoting efﬁcient 
investment decisions and market behaviours via the system operator incentive 
scheme and industry licence, code and charging arrangements.
 – Delivery of a secure 
and reliable network
Shareholders 
and investors
Sharing timely and accurate communication with shareholders is central to our 
relationship with investors. We shared results, prospects and our latest thinking with 
investors through a wide range of channels. These included our Capital Markets Day, 
Annual General Meeting, our Preliminary and Interim results announcements, our 
annual report and accounts and trading updates. Relevant documents can all be 
found online at www.drax.com.
The remuneration policy for 2017-2019 and the Annual Report on Remuneration for 
2016 were approved by the majority of investors in 2017 but we are conscious that a 
signiﬁcant minority of shareholders voted against the policy and particularly the 
report. This feedback has been considered and noted.
 – Results and prospects
 – Operations
 – Business strategy
 – Remuneration policy
Suppliers and 
Contractors
We engage proactively with our key fuel suppliers. We have developed a biomass 
supplier engagement programme and our approach includes regular site visits to 
improve overall performance. For coal sourcing, we carry out visits to suppliers’ sites.
Drax Biomass requires and monitors biomass suppliers’ professional logger training 
as part of our certiﬁcation requirements and commitment to our stakeholders.
 – Expected standards 
of conduct 
 – Prompt Payment Code
 – Guidance on statutory 
obligations, such as 
modern slavery
Trade and industry 
associations
We work closely with a number of trade and industry associations, particularly those 
active in the energy, renewable energy, timber and forestry sectors.
We continued to play an active role in Energy UK, the trade body for the UK’s 
electricity industry, with our Group Chief Executive on its Board. We are a founding 
member of Biomass UK (the Renewable Energy Association’s biomass power sector 
group). Drax also serves on the Policy Board of the Renewable Energy Association. 
We are co-founders and an active member of the Sustainable Biomass Program (SBP).
SBP’s vision is an economically, environmentally and socially sustainable woody 
biomass supply chain that contributes to a low carbon economy.
In Europe we are represented on the Board of the European Biomass Association 
(AEBIOM) and are members of Eurelectric.
The US Industrial Pellet Association, of which Drax Biomass is a member, has regular 
meetings at which members share best practice for managing health and safety, a 
critical part of our industry.

INTRODUCTION 
The Group’s performance for 2017 was 
signiﬁcantly improved from 2016, with 
EBITDA(1) of £229 million (2016: £140 million). 
This principally reflects contributions 
from recently acquired Opus Energy and 
the operation of a biomass unit in Power 
Generation under a CfD. This was delivered 
alongside a well-supported reﬁnancing, 
a positive result for the Pellet Production 
business and good operational performance.
Proﬁt before tax was adversely impacted 
by higher depreciation (£13 million), which 
included the previously announced 
accelerated depreciation of coal-speciﬁc 
assets, one off costs associated with the 
Opus Energy acquisition (£8 million) and 
the reﬁnancing (£24 million), as well as 
amortisation of newly acquired intangible 
assets in Opus Energy (£37 million). 
Non-cash unrealised losses on derivative 
contracts in the period of £156 million 
(2016: proﬁt £197 million), principally a 
result of foreign exchange rate movements, 
materially affected the result and led to a 
loss before tax of £183 million for the period. 
The underlying proﬁt performance, which 
excludes the volatility of open derivative 
contract valuations and associated 
tax charges and one off transaction 
costs, resulted in underlying earnings of 
£2.7 million, as shown in note 2.7 to the 
consolidated ﬁnancial statements. 
The ﬁnancial structure of the business 
has changed over the year and the Group 
beneﬁts from increasingly visible and 
growing earnings from a broader base, with 
reducing exposure to commodity prices, and 
strong cash generation potential. We expect 
the CfD will provide high quality earnings 
through the life of the contract (to March 
2027), supported by growing contributions 
from expanding Pellet Production 
operations and B2B Energy Supply.
On 10 February 2017 we completed the 
acquisition of Opus Energy Group Limited 
for total consideration of £367 million. 
The acquisition was funded from the 
Group’s own resources and £200 million 
from an acquisition facility and resulted in 
£159 million of goodwill and £224 million 
of intangible assets (see note 5.1 to the 
consolidated ﬁnancial statements). 
The Group is supported by a strong balance 
sheet, strengthened in the period by 
the reﬁnancing and restructuring of the 
Group’s debt and a continued focus on 
working capital and cash optimisation. 
Net debt was £367 million at 31 December, 
increased from £93 million in 2016, largely 
driven by debt funding drawn to ﬁnance 
the acquisition of Opus Energy. However, 
continued focus on working capital and 
cash optimisation resulted in net debt 
at 1.6x EBITDA at the end of the year.
The results for 2017 demonstrate clear 
progress with the Group’s strategy. Positive 
contributions were made from across the 
Group, the balance sheet was restructured 
and investment targeted in areas with 
the potential to deliver strong returns. 
This provides an excellent platform from 
which to increase shareholder value.
INCOME STATEMENT
REVENUE
Consolidated revenue for 2017 of £3,685 
million was £735 million greater than 2016, 
driven by higher Power Generation sales 
and the acquisition of Opus Energy. 
Electrical output from Power Generation 
of 20.0TWh was in line with our plan, 65% 
from biomass units and 35% from coal units. 
This included the impact of maintenance 
outages for two biomass units and the 
impact of low load factors on coal units 
during the summer. 2017 saw the ﬁrst 
full year of generation under the CfD, 
contributing £248 million of revenue.
Revenues from system support services 
and the business’ ability to respond flexibly 
to grid demands grew during the year, 
contributing £88 million. The revenues 
available from flexibility recognises the 
value of the Drax plant in an increasingly 
volatile and intermittent generation market. 
Renewable Obligation Certiﬁcate (ROC) 
revenues, recognised when we sell ROCs to 
third parties, of £368 million were recorded 
during the year (2016: £362 million).
B2B Energy Supply revenues increased 
from £1,326 million in 2016 to £1,999 
million in 2017. This included contributions 
from Opus Energy (from 10 February) and 
included sales of gas, a key contributor 
to revenues over the winter period.
Revenues of our US-based Pellet Production 
business continued to rise, as we increased 
production from 607,000 tonnes in 2016 
to 822,000 tonnes in the year. Revenues 
are based on sales of pellets from the US to 
our Power Generation business, based on 
an arms-length contract. Volumes included 
18,000 tonnes of commissioning production 
from our new plant at LaSalle Bioenergy.
GROSS MARGIN
Consolidated gross margin for 2017 
of £545 million (2016: £376 million) 
was primarily derived from our 
generation and supply activities. 
Power Generation delivered £398 million of 
gross margin from biomass units operating 
under a CfD and the ROC regime and coal 
units providing system support. ROCs 
continue to form a key component of 
ﬁnancial performance and the expected 
beneﬁt of ROCs earned is recognised 
as a reduction in our biomass fuel costs 
at the point of generation. Each ROC is 
subsequently recognised as revenue 
when that ROC is sold to a third party. We 
earned ROCs, reducing costs, with a total 
value of £481 million in 2017 (2016: £536 
million) as CfD replaced ROC generation.
B2B Energy supply gross margin improved 
from £24 million in 2016 to £117 million 
in 2017, with positive contributions from 
Haven Power and Opus Energy. Electricity 
sales were supplemented, for the ﬁrst 
time, with gas sales by Opus Energy. 
Pellet Production gross margin relies 
on pellet sales and close control over 
production and operating costs. 
Increasing volumes and stable costs 
allowed margins to improve to £39 million 
during the year and deliver a positive 
EBITDA contribution for the ﬁrst time. 
Further segmental ﬁnancial 
performance data is provided in the 
notes to our consolidated ﬁnancial 
statements on page 127.
OPERATING COSTS
Operating costs of £316 million increased 
from the previous year (2016: £236 million). 
This increase largely reflected the addition of 
Opus Energy to the Group and the expansion 
of the Pellet Production business. Operating 
costs in Power Generation included a major 
planned outage on one of the biomass units.
Central costs for 2017 were £34 million, 
compared with £21 million in 2016. 
The increase reflected investment in 
strategy, innovation and development 
activities, the majority of which is 
not expected to be recurring. 
We incurred transaction costs of £8 
million during the year (2016: £nil), 
supporting the delivery of strategic 
options, including the acquisition of 
Opus Energy. Transaction costs were 
also incurred as part of the disposal of 
Billington Bioenergy to Aggregated Micro 
Power Holdings plc on 31 October. These 
costs were all one off in nature, related 
to asset acquisitions and disposals, and 
were therefore excluded from EBITDA. 
EBITDA
As a result of the ﬁnancial performance 
described above, consolidated 
EBITDA for 2017 was £229 million, 
compared to £140 million in 2016. 
DEPRECIATION AND AMORTISATION
Depreciation of £123 million in the year 
was £13 million higher than 2016, largely 
driven by the acceleration of charges 
following the shortening of useful economic 
lives for certain coal-speciﬁc assets and 
including write off of obsolete assets. We 
assume that assets which are only able 
to support coal-ﬁred generation will not 
operate beyond 2025, in line with the 
Government’s declared intention to cease

GROUP FINANCIAL REVIEW CONTINUED
unabated coal generation, resulting in 
accelerated depreciation charges between 
1 January 2017 and 31 December 2025. 
Amortisation charges of £44 million included 
£37.5 million relating to intangible assets 
arising from the Opus Energy acquisition. 
These assets totalled £224 million and were 
comprised of customer contracts, brand 
value and software, as shown in note 5.3. 
Charges in the year also include the impact 
of reclassifying software assets in use across 
the Group as intangible assets, following 
investment in new systems capability.
UNREALISED LOSSES ON DERIVATIVE 
CONTRACTS
A key component of the Group’s risk 
management strategy is the use of forward 
contracts to secure and de-risk the 
future cash flows of the business. Whilst 
these contracts are all entered into for 
risk management purposes, a proportion 
of our portfolio is not designated into a 
hedge accounting relationship under 
IFRS. Where this is the case, the unrealised 
gains and losses arising from the change 
in fair market value of these contracts is 
recognised in our income statement.
In 2017, we recognised unrealised losses 
of £156 million (2016: gain £177 million) 
within the income statement in respect of 
outstanding contracts for future delivery. 
This was recorded below EBITDA and 
excluded from underlying earnings. In our 
balance sheet a similar loss of £209 million 
was recognised (2016: gain £330 million) 
in the hedge reserve (2016: gain £327 
million). The losses, which do not impact 
cash, principally relate to forward foreign 
currency purchase contracts designed to 
ﬁx the Sterling cost of future purchases of 
biomass. The majority of our fuel purchases 
are denominated in US Dollars, with the 
remainder in Canadian Dollars and Euros. 
The losses reflect the change in value of 
our hedge as Sterling has strengthened 
against the US Dollar during the year. The 
strengthening in Sterling during 2017 
partially reversed the signiﬁcant mark 
to market gains posted during 2016 as 
its value fell following the Brexit vote. 
In addition to hedging foreign currency 
commitments we also forward purchase, 
as required, coal, oil, gas and carbon. 
An increase to oil prices during 2017 
drove an unrealised gain from forward 
contracts for these commodities, which 
partially offset the unrealised losses on 
forward foreign exchange purchases.
Despite the loss in the year the Group 
continues to beneﬁt from the hedging 
programme, securing medium-term 
fuel costs and other liabilities. 
The term of our hedges is limited by available 
credit lines and market liquidity. We have 
hedges in place to cover anticipated 
exposures until 2022, beyond which there 
is a risk that the cost of our fuel purchases 
will materially increase. We remain very 
focused on reducing the long- term cost 
of biomass fuel to preserve gross margins 
beyond the current currency hedge period. 
The accounting treatment of derivative 
contracts is set out in note 7.2 to the 
consolidated ﬁnancial statements.
EBIT
Loss before interest and tax (Operating loss) 
fell from £204 million in 2016 to a loss 
of £117 million in 2017, influenced by 
the items described above, a loss on 
disposal of Billington Bioenergy (£4 million), 
but principally reflecting the volatility 
in the unrealised gains and losses on 
derivative contracts. The impact of these 
movements is excluded in the calculation 
of underlying earnings (see below). 
NET INTEREST CHARGES
Net interest charges of £66 million 
include costs incurred as a result of 
the Group’s reﬁnancing. This includes 
acceleration of deferred ﬁnancing costs, 
the one-off cost of early repayment 
charges for loans outstanding at the 
reﬁnancing date (£24 million) and interest 
costs driven by a higher quantum of debt 
than the previous year. A full breakdown 
of interest payable is shown in note 2.5.
PROFIT/LOSS BEFORE AND AFTER TAX
The Group’s loss before tax, calculated 
in accordance with IFRS, was £183 
million for 2017, compared to a proﬁt 
of £197 million for the previous year. 
The reduction predominantly reflects 
improvements to EBITDA, offset by 
higher depreciation and amortisation 
and unrealised losses on forward 
foreign currency purchase contracts.
The net tax credit of £32 million compares 
to £3 million in 2016. It includes two 
one-off items arising in the year. 
Firstly, a tax credit of £13 million arising 
from a patent relating to biomass was 
granted to the Group in late 2016. Under 
the UK Patent Box tax regime, this enables 
the Group to pay corporate taxes at a 
lower rate on proﬁts which arise from 
the use of innovation. We have agreed 
the claim with HMRC for prior years 2013 
to 2016 (£10 million) and have included 
our best estimate of the beneﬁt arising 
under the tax regime for 2017 (£3 million). 
However, for accounting purposes our best 
estimate is made of the beneﬁt arising 
under the tax regime from 2013 to 2017. 
Offsetting this credit is a non-cash 
deferred tax charge of £16 million arising 
from the reduction in US Federal tax 
rates to 21% from 1 January 2018. 
Applying the tax credit results in a loss 
after tax of £151 million (2016: £194 
million) and a basic loss per share of 
37.2 pence (2016: 47.7 pence).
UNDERLYING EARNINGS
Underlying proﬁt (also referred to as 
underlying earnings) is used to assess the 
performance of the Group without the P&L 
volatility caused by derivative contracts 
and any other material, one-off items. 
The reconciliation of IFRS earnings to 
underlying earnings is shown in note 2.7. 
Underlying proﬁt before tax for 2017 of 
£5 million reduced from £21 million in 2016, 
reflecting higher EBITDA offset by higher 
depreciation, amortisation and interest 
charges.
The underlying tax charge for the year of 
£2 million (2016: £nil) excludes the tax 
effect of non-underlying translations.
Underlying proﬁt after tax for the year was 
£3 million (2016: £21 million), resulting in 
underlying EPS of 0.7 pence per share 
(2016: 5.0 pence per share).
FINANCIAL POSITION
CAPITAL EXPENDITURE
The Group has a disciplined approach to 
capital expenditure, with all projects subject 
to review by investment committees and 
large projects requiring Board approval. 
Investment is prioritised to address safety 
and regulatory requirements, ensure plant is 
fully maintained and ﬁt for purpose, and only 
released to enhancement projects where 
incremental returns have been identiﬁed.
Capital expenditure in the year was £181 
million, increased from £97 million during 
2016. This included the purchase, at auction, 
of the pellet-production assets at LaSalle 
Bioenergy and investment to recommission 
the plant and achieve throughput of 
450k tonnes of wood pellets per annum. 
In total the LaSalle investment was 
£48 million. Details are shown in note 3.1.
At Drax Power Station investment 
reflected routine asset replacement 
and upgrades (£62 million), including 
the purchase of strategic spares, and 
payments to secure development 
options for four OCGT power plants.
In B2B Energy Supply the development of a 
new information technology platform and 
preparations for Smart meters adoption 
added £9 million and an ofﬁce facility 
was purchased in Northampton (£17 
million), which will be used to consolidate 
existing Opus Energy operations 
from four ofﬁces into a single facility, 
enhancing operational effectiveness.
CASH GENERATED FROM OPERATIONS
Cash generated from operations was 
£315 million in 2017, an increase of 
Drax Group plc Annual report and accounts 2017
49
Drax Group plc Annual report and accounts 2017
49
£125 million from the previous year. 
Key drivers were the improvement in 
EBITDA and cash inflows generated 
from working capital management. 
Working capital management included 
use of a committed facility to manage 
receivables in our B2B Energy Supply 
business, providing cash in advance 
of normal payment terms. More 
details can be found in note 4.4 to the 
consolidated ﬁnancial statements.
A cash inflow was also generated from ROC 
sales. Cash from ROCs is typically realised 
several months after the ROC is earned 
however, we have optimised our trading 
activities to enable us to accelerate the 
cash flows over a proportion of these assets. 
This provided a £142 million cash beneﬁt 
during 2017. In 2016, three uncommitted 
ROC facilities were used to accelerate 
ROC receivables, these were unused at 
31 December 2017 (2016: £111 million).
The net cash outflow for the year was 
£6 million (2016: £95 million inflow), after 
cash payments for capital expenditure 
of £159 million (2016: £93 million) and 
dividend payments of £22 million (2016: 
£11 million). Cash taxes paid during the 
year were £14 million (2016: £2 million).
NET DEBT AND FUNDING
The cash position of the Group during the 
year was signiﬁcantly impacted by a full 
Group reﬁnancing, which was executed 
on 5 May 2017. The Group successfully 
raised £550 million of publicly traded bonds, 
supported by a revised revolving credit 
facility and indexed loan notes totalling 
£350 million. The newly raised funds 
were used to repay the £200 million Opus 
Energy acquisition facility. The remaining 
funds will provide support for the Group’s 
investment and strategic programmes. 
The use of the receivables facility and ROC 
sales mentioned above accelerated cash 
flows to a value of £110 million (2016: £74 
million) with a corresponding reduction 
to net debt. We expect to continue to use 
the receivables facility throughout 2018. In 
addition we expect to maintain the flexibility 
to accelerate ROC cash flows through 
optimising our trading activities or through 
uncommitted ROC receivable facilities.
The Group also has access to secured 
trading lines, available with certain 
counterparties, providing support 
to the trading programme. 
Net debt at 31 December 2017 was £367 
million, an increase of £273 million from 
31 December 2016 (£94 million).
We remain committed to a strong balance 
sheet and maintaining an appropriate credit 
rating. Cash optimisation contributed to 
achieving a ratio of net debt to EBITDA 
of 1.6x at 31 December and we remain 
focused on further reductions, supported 
by improved cash generation. 
Further information on funding 
arrangements is included in note 4.3 to 
the consolidated ﬁnancial statements, 
on page 144.
PENSIONS
The Group operates a deﬁned contribution 
pension scheme in each of its operating 
companies and, in addition, the Power 
Generation business operates a deﬁned 
beneﬁt scheme within the Electricity 
Supply Pension Scheme framework. The 
triannual valuation for this scheme (dated 
31 March 2016) completed during the 
year, resulting in an agreement with the 
Trustees for the Company to make deﬁcit 
repair contributions, totalling £52 million, 
from 1 January 2017 to 31 December 2025. 
The agreement also establishes a legally 
binding journey plan, involving the deﬁcit 
contributions, improved investment returns 
and liability reductions, targeting ﬁnancial 
self-sufﬁciency for the scheme by 2025. 
OTHER INFORMATION
ACQUISITION OF OPUS ENERGY 
GROUP LIMITED
On 6 December 2016 we announced the 
proposed acquisition of Opus Energy 
Group Limited, a well-established and 
proven B2B energy supply business serving 
the SME market, for consideration of 
£340 million cash, plus locked box interest.
The acquisition was partly ﬁnanced by a 
short-term debt facility of up to £375 million, 
of which £200 million was initially drawn 
down and then repaid during the year.
The proposed acquisition was approved 
by shareholders at a general meeting 
on 8 February 2017 and concluded on 
10 February 2017, with Drax obtaining 
control of Opus Energy at that date. Opus 
Energy is expected to deliver enhanced 
margins to Drax’s retail business and 
drive our growth in the SME market. The 
business made a positive contribution 
to performance during 2017.
Financial information on the assets and 
liabilities acquired, plus an assessment 
of the impact of the acquisition on our 
ﬁnancial statements, is provided in 
note 5.1 to the consolidated ﬁnancial 
statements on page 148.
IMPACT OF BREXIT
We have continued to monitor the progress 
of the UK’s Brexit negotiations and the 
potential impact on the Group. Whilst 
we continue to expect limited impact on 
our operations, any associated Sterling 
weakness may influence the future cost 
of fuel used by the Power Generation 
business. To manage this risk a number 
of ﬁnancial instruments, including FX 
options, were added to the foreign 
exchange hedging programme during 
the year, effectively capping future FX 
liabilities on an additional proportion of the 
future foreign currency fuel exposures. 
DISTRIBUTIONS
On 15 June we announced a new dividend 
policy, consistent with maintaining the 
Group’s credit rating and investing in its 
business. As part of this announcement the 
Board expected to recommend a dividend of 
£50 million with regard to the 2017 ﬁnancial 
year, with growth expected in future years.
The Board is conﬁdent that this level of 
dividend is sustainable and expects it to 
grow from this level as the implementation 
of the strategy generates an increasing 
proportion of stable earnings and cash 
flows. In determining the rate of growth 
in dividends the Board will take account 
of future investment opportunities and 
the less predictable cash flows from the 
Group’s commodity based businesses. 
If there is a build-up of capital in excess 
of the Group’s investment needs the 
Board will consider the most appropriate 
mechanism to return this to shareholders.
At the Annual General Meeting on 
13 April 2017, shareholders approved 
payment of a ﬁnal dividend for the year 
ended 31 December 2016 of 0.4 pence 
per share (£1.6 million). The ﬁnal dividend 
was subsequently paid on 12 May 2017.
On 18 July 2017, the Board resolved to pay 
an interim dividend for the six months 
ended 30 June 2017 of 4.9 pence per share 
(£20 million), representing 40% of the 
expected full year dividend. The interim 
dividend was paid on 6 October 2017.
At the forthcoming Annual General Meeting, 
on 25 April 2018, the Board will recommend 
to shareholders that a resolution is 
passed to approve payment of a ﬁnal 
dividend for the year ended 31 December 
2017 of 7.4 pence per share (£30 million), 
payable on or before 11 May 2018.
Shares will be marked ex-dividend on  
19 April 2018. In addition, in line with our 
capital allocation policy, the Board has 
agreed to undertake a £50 million share buy 
back programme during 2018 to return cash 
to our shareholders.

VIABILITY STATEMENT
The risks were evaluated, where possible, 
to assess the potential impact of each 
on the viability of the Group, should that 
risk arise in its unmitigated form. The 
potential inputs were included, where 
appropriate, as sensitivities to the Plan 
and considered by the Board as part of 
the approval process required before 
the Plan was adopted by the Group.
In this regard, the Group has a proven 
track record of adapting to changes 
to its environment and deploying 
innovative solutions to protect ﬁnancial 
performance. Recent developments 
suggest that this will continue in the 
future as the Group invests in new plant, 
equipment and systems and broadens 
the business in line with the strategy.
REVIEW OF FINANCIAL FORECASTS
The Plan considers the Group’s ﬁnancial 
position, performance, cash flows, covenant 
compliance and other key ﬁnancial ratios 
and was most recently updated to reflect 
current market and external environment 
conditions in December 2017. It is built 
by business and segment, and includes 
growth assumptions appropriate to 
the markets each business serves. 
The Plan includes certain assumptions, 
the most material of which relate to 
commodity market price curves and levels 
of subsidy support available to the Group 
through the generation of biomass-fuelled 
renewable power. It is underpinned by 
the stable revenues available through the 
generation of CfD-backed electricity and 
sales to B2B Energy Supply customers.
The Plan is subject to stress testing, which 
involves the construction of reasonably 
foreseeable scenarios, including those 
aligned to the principal risks, which test the 
robustness of the Plan when key variables 
are flexed both individually and in unison. 
Where such a scenario suggests a risk 
to viability, the availability and quantum 
of mitigating actions is considered.
The Board considers the most signiﬁcant 
of these scenarios in the assessment 
period to be a signiﬁcant deterioration 
of commodity market prices, leading 
to a fall in the available price for power 
and thus a fall in the margins available 
to the Group from power generation 
and supply activities. This impact would 
however be partially mitigated through 
the earnings stability provided by the CfD 
and a reducing reliance on commodity 
price-dependant earnings. Based on its 
review the Board is satisﬁed that in such a 
scenario sufﬁcient actions could be taken 
to preserve the viability of the Group.
AVAILABILITY OF ADEQUATE FUNDING
The sources of funding available to 
the Group are set out in note 4.3 to the 
consolidated ﬁnancial statements (see 
page 144). The Board expects these 
sources, along with cash flows generated 
by the Group from its normal operations, 
to provide adequate levels of funding to 
support the execution of the Group’s Plan.
Reﬁnancing of the Group’s debt facilities 
during the year, and in particular the 
placement of a new bond facility, has 
provided the Group with enhanced 
facilities and the ability to access debt 
markets, should that need arise during 
the viability assessment period. 
EXPECTATIONS
The directors have considered all the factors 
in their assessment of viability over the 
next three years, including the latest Plan, 
scenario analysis, levels of funding, control 
environment and the principal risks and 
uncertainties facing the Group. The directors 
have also considered the availability of 
actions within their control in the event of 
plausible negative scenarios occurring. They 
have a reasonable expectation that the 
Group will be able to continue in operation 
and meet its liabilities as they fall due over 
the three-year period of their assessment.
The assessment of viability was led by 
the Group Chief Executive and Interim 
Chief Financial Ofﬁcer in conjunction with 
divisional and functional management teams 
and presented to the Board. In reviewing this 
assessment the Board has considered the 
principal risks faced by the Group, relevant 
ﬁnancial forecasts and sensitivities, the 
availability of adequate funding and the 
strength of the Group’s control environment. 
ASSESSMENT PERIOD
The Board conducted this assessment 
over a period of three years, which was 
selected for the following reasons:
 
– The Group’s Business Plan, which is 
reviewed and assessed on a quarterly 
basis and is used for strategic decision 
making, includes a range of ﬁnancial 
forecasts and associated sensitivity 
analysis. This Plan covers a three-year 
period in detail. 
 
– Within the three-year period liquid 
commodity market curves and established 
contract positions are used in the 
forecasts. Liquid curves typically cover a 
one to two-year window and contracts 
cover periods between one and ten years. 
In particular, we beneﬁt from the stable 
and material earnings stream available 
from the CfD until 2027. Selecting a 
three-year period balances short-term 
market liquidity against our longer term 
contractual positions. 
 
– Within a three-year horizon there is limited 
certainty around markets and regulatory 
regimes. However, in selecting this period 
the Board has assumed no material 
changes to the Group’s mid-term 
regulatory environment and associated 
support regimes. 
REVIEW OF PRINCIPAL RISKS
The Group’s principal risks and uncertainties, 
set out in detail on pages 51 to 57, have 
been considered over the period.
The principal risks with the potential to 
exert signiﬁcant influence on viability are: 
commodity price changes, political and 
regulatory changes, biomass acceptability 
changes and plant operating failures. 
A signiﬁcant adverse change to the status 
of each risk has the potential to place 
material ﬁnancial stress on the Group.
IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE UK CORPORATE GOVERNANCE  
CODE, THE DIRECTORS HAVE ASSESSED THE PROSPECTS OF  
THE GROUP OVER A PERIOD SIGNIFICANTLY LONGER THAN THE 
12 MONTHS REQUIRED BY THE GOING CONCERN PROVISION.

PRINCIPAL RISKS AND UNCERTAINTIES
GROUP APPROACH TO RISK 
MANAGEMENT
The effective identiﬁcation and 
management of risk across the Group is 
integral to the delivery of our strategy. 
The Group has a Risk Management Policy, 
approved by the Board, which deﬁnes the 
Group’s approach to risk management. The 
key elements of the policy are as follows:
 
– identify principal risks that threaten the 
achievement of our strategic objectives 
then assess their signiﬁcance to the 
business; 
 
– put in place appropriate mitigating 
controls to manage identiﬁed risks to an 
acceptable level; 
 
– escalate and report principal risk and 
control information to support 
management decision making; 
 
– assign responsibility and deﬁne 
accountabilities for risk management and 
put these into practice across the Group;
 
– continuously monitor the changing risk 
environment, the Group’s principal risks, 
the effectiveness of mitigation strategies 
and the application of the risk framework. 
The approach manages rather than 
eliminates the risk of failure to achieve 
business objectives, and provides 
reasonable, not absolute, assurance 
against material misstatement or loss.
RISK MANAGEMENT COMMITTEES
The risk management governance 
structure includes seven business risk 
management committees (RMCs). 
Each RMC:
 
– reports to the executive management 
of that area, assisting in the management 
of their risks. In turn, each executive is 
responsible for their risks to the Group 
Executive Committee with responsibility 
for ensuring that all risks associated with 
their speciﬁc area of the business are 
identiﬁed, analysed and managed 
systematically and appropriately. This 
includes new and emerging risks and 
changes to existing risks. New risks are 
also identiﬁed during development of the 
Business Plan;
 
– has terms of reference that require local 
level risk policies and control systems to 
be approved, implemented and monitored 
in order to ensure that activities are 
commensurate with the risk appetite 
established by the Board, are adequately 
resourced and comply with applicable 
legal and regulatory requirements.
The Group Executive Committee and the 
Board review reporting on risks from each 
RMC and from Group Risk. In addition, the 
Audit Committee reviews the suitability and 
effectiveness of risk management processes 
and controls on behalf of the Board.
We manage the commercial and 
operational risks faced by the Group in 
accordance with policies approved by the 
Board. We have reviewed the principal 
risks and consider they are broadly 
unchanged from the previous year.
The Board is responsible for deﬁning risk 
appetite and ensuring the effectiveness 
of risk management and internal controls 
across the Group. The Group has a 
comprehensive system of governance 
controls to manage key risks.
WE MANAGE THE COMMERCIAL  
AND OPERATIONAL RISKS FACED  
BY THE GROUP IN ACCORDANCE WITH  
POLICIES APPROVED BY THE BOARD.

INTERNAL CONTROL
The Group has a comprehensive and well-
deﬁned internal control system with clear 
structures, delegated authority levels and 
accountability. The Board has adopted a 
schedule of matters which are required to 
be brought to it for decision. The internal 
control system is designed to ensure that 
the directors maintain full and effective 
control over all signiﬁcant strategic, 
ﬁnancial and organisational issues.
Through the Audit Committee, the Board 
has implemented a programme of internal 
audits of different aspects of the Group’s 
activities. The programme is developed 
based on an assessment of the key risks 
of the Group, the existing assurance and 
controls in place to manage the risks and 
the core ﬁnancial control framework.
The results of each internal audit are 
documented in a report for internal 
distribution and action. A full copy of 
the report is distributed to the Group 
Executive Committee and the Chair of 
the Audit Committee, with an executive 
summary going to the other members of 
the Audit Committee. Each report includes 
management responses to Internal Audit’s 
ﬁndings and recommendations and an 
agreement of the actions that management 
will take to improve the risk management 
and the internal control framework. In 
addition to the results of work undertaken 
by Internal Audit, the Audit Committee 
also satisﬁes itself that an action plan is 
in place and management are addressing 
issues raised by the external auditor 
in their yearly management letter.
Based on the reporting from the RMCs 
and from the Audit Committee in 2017, the 
Board determined that it was not aware 
of any signiﬁcant deﬁciency or material 
weakness in the system of internal control.
CHANGE IN RISK PROFILE
Risks are reported to the Board and 
disclosed in the annual report and accounts

Context
The Group has a strategy designed to 
strengthen the long-term future of 
the Group. The strategy includes:
 
– Higher quality, diversiﬁed earnings and 
management of commodity market 
exposure by increasing contractual 
and non-commodity related earnings 
and;
 
– Targeted long-term growth 
opportunities with priority on post 
2027 earnings and creating new 
opportunities in all the markets in 
which we operate.
Risk and impact
 
– Development of the four OCGT plants 
acquired in 2016 and re-powering of 
coal units to gas with battery storage 
option is dependent on winning 
contracts with acceptable returns 
in capacity market auctions which is 
uncertain.
 
– Post 2027 biomass generation 
dependent upon cost of generation 
relative to market prices.
 
– Biomass self-supply requires 
acquisition and/or expansion in 
order to achieve the 30% self-supply 
target. Acquisition opportunities 
are dependent on willing vendors or 
distressed plants coming to market.
 
– The energy markets in which we 
operate are evolving at a rapid 
pace with new entrants competing 
with existing players in both Power 
Generation and B2B Energy Supply.
 
– Continue work on reducing 
projects’ costs to increase 
competitiveness in the capacity 
market auction; a disciplined 
approach to the auction means 
such projects will only go forward 
upon obtaining a 15-year capacity 
market contract (“CM” contract) 
which meets our hurdle rate.
 
– Continued work on cost reductions 
from biomass supply and 
generation efﬁciency to support 
post-2027 operations.
 
– We continue to actively pursue 
potential acquisitions of pellet plant 
facilities and evaluate the case for 
expansion of existing facilities.
 
– We continually analyse the 
changing dynamics of the markets 
in which we operate. A programme 
of product incubation to bring new 
energy services to market and 
research/development into new 
technologies is in place.
 
– Acquisition of Opus Energy and 
integration into the Group provides 
support to diversiﬁcation of 
earnings.
 
– Acquisition and start of 
commissioning of LaSalle pellet 
facility supports self-supply target.
 
– Announcement of a cap to 
standard variable tariffs (SVTs) for 
residential customers increases 
regulatory risk to the sector.
 
– Announcement of a de-rating 
mechanism for battery storage will 
result in a fairer competition for 
CM contracts.

2. Political and regulatory risks
Context
We remain vulnerable to changes 
in government policy at UK and EU 
level. The energy sector is subject to 
detailed legislation and regulation 
that is frequently changing as 
the economy decarbonises and 
decentralises and is ever more 
stringent. Regulation and compliance 
generally applicable to businesses is 
also increasing with a trend towards 
transparency and accountability.
Risk and impact
 
– Changes to UK policy and regulations 
may reduce our ability to deliver our 
forecast earnings from our base 
business and our growth strategy 
putting pressure on our ﬁnancial 
results and cash flows. 
 
– More complex and challenging 
regulations increase the potential for 
non-compliant outcomes, regulatory 
investigation and sanctions.
 
– Engagement with politicians 
across the political spectrum and 
Government ofﬁcials to influence 
thinking.
 
– Communication of our socio- 
economic value to the UK.
 
– Working with think tanks and 
specialist consultants to establish 
Drax as a thought leader on priority 
policy and regulatory issues.
 
– Engagement with regulators to 
influence strategic direction of, and 
ensure compliance with, regulatory 
requirements.
 
– Working with Energy UK to identify 
market improvements, enhance 
competition and develop voluntary 
codes of practice. 
 
– Regulatory and compliance 
programmes in place proportionate 
to the risk of non-compliance. Key 
programmes include compliance 
with the Criminal Finances Act 2017 
and the General Data Protection 
Regulation (GDPR) and associated 
data protection laws.
 
– The Government has conﬁrmed 
the Carbon Price Floor will remain 
in place and at its current level until 
the end of coal generation in the 
power sector (by 2025).
 
– The Government has unveiled 
a successor to the Levy Control 
Framework to monitor the cost of 
subsidies and conﬁrmed no new 
funding commitments until 2025.
 
– Brexit continues to create 
uncertainty over UK participation 
in, and influence over, discussions 
on new EU legislation.
 
– The Government has published 
a Bill to introduce a price cap 
for domestic power retailers; we 
remain vigilant to the risk this could 
be extended to some SMEs.
 
– The smart meter roll out continues 
and the obligation to install a 
smart meter for every customer 
(where reasonable steps have been 
exhausted) remains.
 
– Many ancillary services require 
policy, regulatory and market 
change to ensure generators are 
suitably compensated for these 
services. 
 
– Ofgem is reviewing the way in 
which network businesses are 
remunerated, which will impact 
network charging and access rights 
for generators and demand users.
 
– New Data Protection Bill 
announced due to Brexit to ensure 
the UK is regarded as an “approved 
country” to continue to process EU 
citizen personal data.
 
– The introduction of the Markets in 
Financial Instruments Directive 2 
(MiFID2) increases the regulatory 
requirements placed on businesses 
participating in non-physical 
commodity markets.

3. Biomass acceptability risks
Context
The biomass market is still relatively 
new, sustainability legislation at 
both an EU and UK level and public 
understanding of the beneﬁts of 
the technology are evolving.
Risk and impact
 
– EU or UK sustainability policy changes 
could be excessively onerous and 
make it difﬁcult for us to comply with 
policy requirements and claim subsidy 
in support of economic biomass 
generation. 
 
– Detractors and some eNGOs try and 
influence policymakers against wider 
biomass use and future biomass 
conversions, which could make it 
difﬁcult to gain support for further 
conversions. 
 
– Increased engagement across all 
European Institutions (Commission, 
Parliament, Council), and relevant 
UK Government departments.
 
– Strong coalition with other utilities 
and those engaged in forest 
industries including using EU 
and US forestry expertise to brief 
Brussels.
 
– Increased transparency in how we 
evidence sustainability.
 
– Working with academics, think 
tanks and specialist consultants 
to improve understanding and 
analysis of the beneﬁts of biomass.
 
– Engagement with key NGOs to 
discuss issues of contention.
 
– Media, including social media, 
presence to respond in the public 
domain to eNGOs.
 
– Forging closer relationships 
with suppliers on sustainability 
through the supplier relationship 
programme.
 
– Strong processes to ensure 
compliance with regulation.
 
– EU consultation on the next 
version of the Renewables 
Energy Directive, including the 
sustainability requirements for 
biomass. 
4. Plant operating risks
Context
The reliability of our operating 
plant is central to our ability to 
create value for the Group.
Risk and impact
 
– Single point failures of plant and 
incidents arising from the handling 
and combustion of biomass could 
result in forced outages in our 
generation or pellet production plants.
 
– Successful generation using biomass 
requires stringent quality throughout 
the supply chain, which continues to 
evolve and mature. Poor quality could 
result in unplanned loss of generation.
 
– Robust management systems 
designed to mitigate risk.
 
– Comprehensive risk-based plant 
investment and maintenance 
programme.
 
– Stringent safety procedures in 
place for handling biomass and 
dust management.
 
– Plant designed to prevent and 
control major hazards.
 
– Signiﬁcant research and 
development on the production of 
wood pellets as well as the handling 
and burning of biomass.
 
– Adequate insurance in place to 
cover losses from plant failure 
where possible.
 
– Full testing of all biomass supplies 
prior to acceptance and the use of 
contractual rights to reject out of 
speciﬁcation cargoes.
 
– Sampling and analysis through 
the supply chain to increase 
understanding of causes of fuel 
quality issues.
 
–  Acquisition and start of 
commissioning of LaSalle 
Bioenergy plant.

5. Trading and commodity risks
Context
The margins of our Power Generation 
and B2B Energy Supply businesses 
are influenced by commodity market 
movements, which are inherently volatile.
Risk and impact
 
– Fluctuations in commodity prices, 
particularly gas and power, could result 
in lower margins and a reduction in 
cash flow in our generation business.
 
– Drax Power may fail to secure future 
grid system services contracts which 
are a source of revenue diversity for 
the Group.
 
– The value of ROCs generated may be 
lower than forecast if the recycle value 
outturns below BEIS’ projections due 
to higher than anticipated renewable 
generation.
 
– High levels of forward power 
sales for 2018 and a CfD for one 
generation biomass unit.
 
– Hedging energy supply commodity 
price exposures when ﬁxed price 
sales are executed with third 
parties.
 
– Wood pellets purchased under 
long-term contracts with ﬁxed 
pricing.
 
– Signiﬁcant forward foreign 
exchange hedging in place.
 
– Hedging fluctuations in ROC 
generation from wind farms 
through weather derivatives.
 
– Sterling exchange rates against 
the Euro and Dollar remain weak. 
 
– Power prices remain low with 
increased volatility in short-term 
prices. 
 
– Prices for wood pellets increased 
as oversupply reduced.
 
– Opus Energy’ supply to smaller 
customers, including gas, increases 
commodity exposure relating 
to weather impacts on demand 
patterns.
6. Information systems and security risks
Context
The availability, integrity and 
security of our IT systems and 
Company data are essential to 
support operations of the Group.
Risk and impact
 
– Non-availability of IT systems, or a 
breach in their security, could result in 
the inability to operate systems or our 
information could be compromised. 
 
– If our IT architecture does not meet 
the increasingly demanding and 
complex requirements of the Group, 
we may not deliver our growth plans 
effectively. 
 
– Business continuity, disaster 
recovery and crisis management 
plans in place across the Group. 
 
– Cyber security measures, including 
a defence, detect, remedy strategy, 
in place. 
 
– IT transformation programme 
in place to deliver upgraded 
architecture. 
 
– Signiﬁcant investment in our 
critical IT systems has improved 
the general resilience of the core 
systems.
 
– Implementation of the IT 
transformation programme. 
7. People risks
Context
We need to ensure we have the right 
people in place with the leadership 
and specialist skills to help the Group 
to compete, innovate and grow.
Risk and impact
 
– Our performance and the delivery 
of our strategy is dependent upon 
having strong, high-quality leaders 
and engaged and talented people 
at all levels of the organisation.
 
– Consistent Group-wide 
performance management, 
potential assessment and career 
development frameworks.
 
– Regular staff surveys to monitor 
engagement levels and alignment 
of people with Group values.
 
– Investment in leadership 
development. 
 
– Regular staff communications.
 
– Reward packages to aid retention.
 
– Development and launch of a new 
people strategy centred around 
valuing people, driving business 
performance and focusing on 
talent. This is placing greater onus 
on performance, learning, equitable 
treatment and consistency in 
approach across the Drax Group.

8. Environment, health and safety risks
Context
The health and safety of all our 
employees, contractors and visitors is of 
paramount importance to us. We believe 
that a safe, compliant and sustainable 
business model is critical to the delivery 
of our strategy and crucial for sustained 
long-term performance. Safety is at 
the heart of our operational philosophy 
and we continue to work across the 
Group to maintain high standards and 
a culture of safe working. Compliance 
with environmental legislation and 
our environmental permits and 
consents is essential to ensure the 
long-term future of the business.
Risk and impact
 
– Our operations involve managing a 
range of hazards to personnel and 
the environment that arise from 
the processes we operate. 
 
– Training staff to a high level of 
competence to appreciate and 
manage risk.
 
– Robust management systems 
designed to mitigate risk.
 
– Continuous reporting of events 
and prompt implementation of 
corrective actions. 
 
– Continuous monitoring of 
processes to identify trends 
in performance.
 
– Rigorous auditing of compliance 
against standards, policy and 
procedures.
 
– Engagement with regulators 
and stakeholders to identify 
improvements to our systems and 
operations.
 
– Investigating underlying reasons 
for events and implementing 
any necessary changes in the 
management system and culture.
 
– Timely identiﬁcation of future 
legislation and appropriate 
investment in order to optimise 
performance into the future.
 
– World-class personal safety 
performance for the year with 
improved TRIR continuing well 
above the industry benchmark.
 
– Changes under the Industrial 
Emissions Directive set demanding 
emissions limits that come fully into 
force in the next four years.

Dear shareholders
Drax places considerable emphasis on governance and in 
this section of the Annual Report, we describe governance at 
Drax, the principal activities of the Board and its committees and 
how we have complied with the principles of the UK Corporate 
Governance Code (the Code).
MY ROLE AS CHAIRMAN
The division of responsibilities between the roles of Chairman 
and Group Chief Executive Ofﬁcer (CEO) is well established, as 
shown below. As Chairman I am responsible for leading the Board 
and ensuring it operates effectively. The Group CEO is responsible 
for running the business and the implementation of the strategy 
and policies adopted by the Board.
Chairman’s responsibilities
 – Chairing and managing the business of the Board.
 – Together with the Group CEO, ensuring the Board carries out a full 
and robust review of the strategy of the business and ensuring 
effective implementation of the strategy by the executive 
management team.
 – Engagement with shareholders and other key stakeholders.
 – In conjunction with the Nomination Committee, taking 
responsibility for the composition of the Board.
 – Overseeing the annual Board evaluation and acting on its results.
 – Ensuring effective contribution and constructive challenge from 
non-executive directors and a productive relationship between 
executive and non-executive directors.
 – Ensuring Board agendas cover all material aspects of the business.
 – Overseeing a thorough process for succession management, both 
for the Board and for the executive management.
 – Ensuring Group policies, including policies for health and safety, 
trading, environment, diversity, ethical, social and sustainability 
standards are ﬁt for purpose and appropriately implemented.
 – Oversight of risk management and internal control systems.
Group CEO’s responsibilities
 – Communicating the culture, vision and values of the Group.
 – The development and implementation of the Group’s strategy.
 – The day-to-day management of the Group.
 – Leading the Executive Committee.
 – Managing relationships with key stakeholders.
 – With the Group Chief Financial Ofﬁcer, communicating the 
Group’s ﬁnancial performance to shareholders.
KEY AREAS OF FOCUS
In 2017 signiﬁcant progress was made with the strategy. 
The on-boarding of Opus Energy following its acquisition in February 
continues to go well and the acquisition of LaSalle Bioenergy in the 
US Gulf region signiﬁcantly increased our biomass pellet capacity. 
In developing longer-term options for growth we continue to explore 
the option of coal-to-gas repowering at Drax Power Station and 
construction of new OCGT plants, in order to provide new sources of 
flexible generation backed up by long-term contracts. 
The health and safety of all employees and contractors is of 
paramount importance and safety remains at the centre of our 
operational philosophy. We have performed well in this regard and 
we continue to work to improve our performance across the Group.
SUCCESSION PLANNING AND DIVERSITY
We recognise that in order to maintain an effective Board it is 
essential to plan for the future and to ensure the right individuals are 
appointed to the Board from a diverse pool of talent. We are strong 
advocates of diversity and we consider the Board to be diverse in 
terms of the background, skills and experience each individual brings 
to the Board.
All appointments will continue to be based on merit. More detail on 
the work of the Nomination Committee can be found in the 
Nomination Committee Report on pages 71–75.
We recognise the importance of diversity within the Group and we 
have reported on Board and Executive Committee composition and 
diversity earlier on pages 59 and 60. Currently around 25% of Drax’s 
senior management are women and we recently appointed a new 
female non-executive director, Nicola Hodson. Drax’s business and 
demographics are changing and we are committed to improving 
gender diversity across the Group. 
BOARD DIRECTORATE CHANGES
Executive directorate changes
In September 2017, we announced that Will Gardiner would succeed 
Dorothy Thompson as Group CEO in January 2018. Will was 
previously the Group Chief Financial Ofﬁcer (CFO) and his 
appointment is a natural progression after two years working 
alongside Dorothy.
A process to appoint a permanent Group CFO is underway and in the 
meantime Den Jones has been appointed as Interim Group CFO. 
Non-executive directorate changes
The Board membership has been refreshed and diversiﬁed with 
the appointments of David Nussbaum and Nicola Hodson as 
non-executive directors in August 2017 and January 2018 
respectively. David’s knowledge of sustainability will support our 
good work in this area and Nicola’s experience in technology, sales 
and marketing, business transformation and energy will provide real 
value as Drax delivers on its strategy.
BOARD AND COMMITTEE EVALUATION
During 2017 we conducted an internal evaluation of the Board and 
its committees. The evaluation process involved the completion of 
questionnaires and interviews by the Chairman. More information on 
the process and the key action areas can be found on page 72 in the 
report of the Nomination Committee. 
During 2018 and beyond I am conﬁdent that we have the right team 
in place to meet the challenges and opportunities of the future.

Responsible for overseeing the Group’s strategy and risk appetite, 
monitoring performance and ensuring that the necessary controls and resources 
are in place to deliver the Group’s plans
EXECUTIVE COMMITTEE
Focuses on the Group’s strategy, ﬁnancial structure, planning and performance, 
succession planning and organisational development
All Board committees are authorised to obtain legal or other 
professional advice as necessary, to secure the attendance of 
external advisers at their meetings and to seek information required 
from any employee of the Group in order to perform their duties. 
ROLE OF THE BOARD
The Board determines: the Group’s strategy; the Group’s appetite 
for risk; the risk management policies; the annual plan and key 
performance indicators; acquisitions and disposals and other 
transactions outside delegated limits; material changes to 
accounting policies or practices; signiﬁcant ﬁnancial decisions; 
capital structure and dividend policy; shareholder communications; 
prosecution, defence or settlement of material litigation; Group 
remuneration policy; the terms of reference of Board committees; 
and the Board structure, composition and succession.
TERMS OF REFERENCE
The Board has a schedule of matters reserved for its decisions and 
formal terms of reference for its committees. These are reviewed 
annually and are available to view on the Group’s website at  
www.drax.com.
Matters which are not speciﬁcally reserved to the Board and its 
committees under their terms of reference, or to shareholders in 
General Meeting, are delegated to the Executive Committee or 
otherwise delegated in accordance with a schedule of delegated 
authorities approved by the Board.
HOW THE BOARD FUNCTIONS
At each meeting the Board receives a report from the Group Chief 
Executive Ofﬁcer in relation to key business and operational matters 
and from the Group Chief Financial Ofﬁcer updating the Board on 
the ﬁnancial performance of the Group. It also receives regular 
reports on performance against the Business Plan, safety, 
operational, ﬁnancial and periodic business reports from senior 
management across the Group. Of equal importance, the Board also 
receives industry, regulatory and topical updates from external 
experts and advisers, as well as internal specialists, from time to time. 
Papers are distributed in advance of Board and committee meetings, 
to brief directors.
The core activities of the Board and its committees are documented 
and planned on an annual basis and a list of matters arising from 
each meeting is maintained and followed up at subsequent 
meetings. 
Directors may, in the furtherance of their duties, seek independent 
professional advice at the Company’s expense. During 2017, no 
director sought independent professional advice.
The Company Secretary advises the Board on all governance 
matters, ensuring good information flows within the Board, its 
committees, the Executive Committee and senior management. 
He ensures that Board processes are complied with and is also 
responsible for compliance with the Listing, Prospectus,

Disclosure Guidance and Transparency Rules and the Companies 
Act. There is collaboration with other parties to ensure wider 
corporate compliance. 
The Company’s Articles of Association (the Articles), give the 
directors power to authorise conflicts of interest. The Board has 
an effective procedure to identify potential conflicts of interest, 
consider them for authorisation and record them. The Articles 
also allow the Board to exercise voting rights in Group companies 
without restriction (for example to appoint a director to a Group 
company).
The Company has appropriate insurance cover in place in respect of 
legal action against directors of the Company and its subsidiaries.
The Nomination Committee report contains details of the selection, 
appointment, review and re-election of directors, as well as the 
Board performance review and directors’ development. The Articles 
are available on the Group’s website at www.drax.com.
SCHEDULE OF MATTERS RESERVED FOR THE BOARD
At least once a year the Board reviews the nature and scale of 
matters reserved for its decision and these include:
 
– Dividend policy.
 
– Company strategy, business objectives and annual budgets.
 
– Succession planning for the Board and senior management.
 
– Approval of signiﬁcant funding decisions.
 
– Review and approval of corporate transactions.
Other day-to-day operational decisions are delegated by the Board 
to the Executive Committee, subject to formal delegated authority 
limits. 
GOVERNANCE OVERVIEW
The Board recognises that there is always scope for improvement to 
make us better able to achieve our aspirations and deal with the 
challenges we face. To address this, we continually work to ensure 
that our governance structures and processes are aligned with the 
requirements of the business and that good governance is 
embedded by management throughout the Group. At Drax we 
believe that governance is not only about following the rules, but 
also about doing things in the right way. We believe that it is 
important for the Board to establish and lead a strong moral and 
ethical culture within the organisation. The values of the Group are 
expressed as; honest, energised, achieving and together, or “HEAT” 
as it is known within the business. These values have been 
established for several years, and are embedded throughout the 
organisation in the way our people go about their everyday business.

BOARD DIVERSITY
In 2017, there were seven male directors and one female director on 
the Board.
NUMBER OF MEETINGS HELD
The Board and its committees have regular scheduled meetings and 
hold additional meetings as required. Directors are expected, where 
possible, to attend all Board meetings, relevant committee meetings, 
the Annual General Meeting (AGM) and any General Meetings. 
 
– The Board has eight scheduled meetings each year.
 
– In 2017, an additional three meetings were held by telephone to 
address matters requiring formal decisions and a Shareholder 
General Meeting was held to approve the Opus Energy acquisition.
 
– In addition, the Board meets at least annually to consider strategy.
TIME COMMITMENT
Under the terms of his letter of appointment, the Chairman is 
expected to commit between 50 and 70 full days a year to this role.
Under the non-executive directors’ letters of appointment, each is 
expected to commit 12 to 15 full days a year. That includes 
attendance at Board meetings, the AGM, one annual Board strategy 
day and at least one site visit per year. In addition, they are expected 
to devote appropriate preparation time ahead of each meeting. The 
time commitment expected in respect of their membership of the 
Audit, Nomination and Remuneration Committees is an additional 
three to four full days a year in each case. However, in practice 
considerably more time is devoted, particularly by the Chairmen of 
the Board committees. Non-executive directors also spend time with 
management, to maintain their knowledge of the developing 
business and to understand the operational challenges being faced.
COMPLIANCE WITH THE UK CORPORATE GOVERNANCE CODE
It is the Board’s view that throughout the period commencing on 
1 January 2017, the Company has complied in full with the principles 
of the Code issued in April 2016. The Code can be found on the 
Financial Reporting Council website at www.frc.org.uk.
With the exception of David Nussbaum who was appointed as a 
director on 1 August 2017, and Nicola Hodson who was appointed 
as a director on 12 January 2018, all of the directors listed on pages 
58–59 served throughout the year. Each of those listed, except for 
Dorothy Thompson, remained directors as at the date of the approval 
of this report. Biographical details of the directors appear on pages 
58–59.
DIRECTORS’ INTERESTS, INDEMNITY ARRANGEMENTS 
AND OTHER SIGNIFICANT AGREEMENTS
Other than a service contract between the executive directors and a 
Group company, or as noted in the Remuneration Committee report, 
no director had a material interest at any time during the year in any 
signiﬁcant contract with the Company or any of its subsidiary 
undertakings.
There are no agreements between the Group and its directors 
providing for compensation for loss of ofﬁce or employment because 
of a takeover bid.
The Board has reviewed the independence of each non-executive 
director. None of the non-executive directors who served during the 
year had any material business or other relationship with the Group, 
and there were no other matters that were likely to affect their 
independence of character and judgement. The Board recognises 
that in view of the characteristics of independence set out in the UK 
Corporate Governance Code, length of service is an important factor 
when considering the independence of non-executive directors and 
that directors having served for longer than nine years may not be 
considered independent. In November, David Lindsell was re-
appointed for a fourth time until the 2019 AGM. The Board considers 
that David Lindsell’s experienced oversight in ensuring careful 
ﬁnancial stewardship as Chairman of the Audit Committee is crucial 
during a period of change in the implementation of the new strategy 
and the development of the new Group CEO into that role, and the 
establishment of a new Group CFO. The established Chairman of the 
Audit Committee continuing in post during this period of transition 
and assisting in the recruitment and induction of a new Audit 
Committee Chairman in 2018 will be an integral part of ongoing good 
ﬁnancial governance. The Board is satisﬁed that David Lindsell’s 
judgement has remained wholly independent and that he has 
consistently displayed all of the behaviours expected of 
our independent non-executive directors. The Board therefore 
considers all of the non-executive directors to be independent.

DIRECTORS’ DEVELOPMENT
The Board is committed to the development of all employees 
and directors and has reviewed, and will continue to review, 
each director’s development requirements and make appropriate 
arrangements to address them. For example, as part of his ongoing 
development, Will Gardiner worked with an executive coach during 
2017. In addition to regular coaching sessions, where his coach 
reviewed priorities and challenges with him, his coach also prepared 
360 degree feedback to support more in-depth coaching.
The non-executive directors visit operational sites both in the UK 
and the US. In 2017 a delegation of the Board visited operational and 
administrative sites in the US, and over a three-day period carried out  
 
visits to Drax Biomass operations and reviewed the wider 
sustainability programme and activities. Periodically, the non-
executive directors also meet with senior management to be 
briefed on the Group’s business and speciﬁc Board training 
is arranged covering key relevant topics. For example, in 
September the Board held its meeting at one of the Opus Energy 
ofﬁces in Northampton where the Board received presentations 
on the operation of the retail business by members of the senior 
management team. The directors were then taken through 
various customer scenarios to illustrate the customer experience.
These programmes are reviewed regularly during the year. 
 
STRATEGY IN PROGRESS
Succession planning, 
development and induction
In September 2017 we announced that 
after 12 successful years as Group Chief 
Executive Ofﬁcer, Dorothy Thompson would 
be leaving the Group at the end of the year 
and that Will Gardiner would be appointed 
as Group Chief Executive Ofﬁcer with effect 
from 1 January 2018.
The Nomination Committee has a well-
established and robust succession planning 
process in place and it regularly identiﬁes 
and monitors potential suitable internal 
candidates for senior roles. The Chairman of 
the Nomination Committee led the process 
to appoint a new Group Chief Executive 
Ofﬁcer and had a number of discussions 
with the Nomination Committee to scope 
out the best approach to take and the 
requirements for the role. The Committee 
enlisted the help of a professional external 
executive recruitment agency, Russell 
Reynolds Associates. Aside from assisting 
with the recruitment, Russell Reynolds has 
no connection with the Group. 
A timetable was adopted for the process 
and regular Committee discussions and 
updates were held throughout. From a 
detailed understanding of our requirements 
and speciﬁcation of the role, a list was 
compiled of potential external candidates 
and an assessment of both the external and 
internal candidates was carried out using 
the same criteria to ensure consistency. 
A shortlist was then drawn up and the 
shortlisted candidates met the Committee.
The Nomination Committee unanimously 
agreed that Will Gardiner had the blend of 
skills and experience to be our next Group 
Chief Executive Ofﬁcer. Will joined Drax as 
Group Chief Financial Ofﬁcer and a member 
of the Group Board in November 2015. He 
has been a key architect of our new strategy 
and is a focused, innovative and engaging 
leader.

The Group has a comprehensive investor relations programme, 
maintaining regular dialogue with shareholders and investors.
Throughout the year, meetings are held for the Group Chief 
Executive Ofﬁcer, Group Chief Financial Ofﬁcer and Head of 
Investor Relations to meet with institutional shareholders and 
sell-side analysts. These meetings allow us to discuss the Company’s 
business model, strategy and marketplace, as well as update on 
performance. Meetings are arranged proactively and on request 
and often include site visits, which provide shareholders with 
valuable insight into the Group’s operations.
Digital communication is increasingly used as a means of keeping in 
touch with shareholders. During 2017 we introduced a new Investor 
Relations section to the Drax Group website. In addition to providing 
information on RNS announcements, Company publications and a 
calendar of events, the website provides content relating to 
the markets in which the Group operates.
The Board receives reports of meetings with institutional 
shareholders together with regular market updates which give the 
directors a clear understanding of shareholders’ views and concerns. 
The Chairman is also available to meet with shareholders, 
independently of the executive directors, as required. 
The Annual report and accounts is sent to all shareholders who wish 
to receive a copy. It is also available in the investor section of the 
Company’s website www.drax.com.
Communication with all our stakeholders is an essential part of 
our business. Details of communications with stakeholders are 
contained in the Stakeholder engagement section of this report 
beginning on page 42, with further details of our communications 
with investors set out below.
SHAREHOLDER ENGAGEMENT IS A PRIORITY  
FOR THE GROUP TO ENSURE GOOD UNDERSTANDING 
OF OUR INVESTMENT CASE
THE DRAX INVESTOR RELATIONS PROGRAMME INCLUDES THE FOLLOWING ACTIVITIES
1. SHAREHOLDER MEETINGS
Through the year the 
management team are available 
to meet shareholders and, in 
addition, following the full and 
half year results, a structured 
programme of meetings is 
arranged to allow management 
to meet with shareholders and 
prospective investors. 
Why it is important
The Group considers that it is 
important that the owners of 
the business have access to 
management in order to 
understand the business, 
its operation and strategy. 
Frequency
Ongoing.
2. THE ANNUAL  
GENERAL MEETING
The AGM is attended by the full 
Board of directors. Details of the 
resolutions to be proposed at 
the AGM on 25 April 2018 can be 
found in the Notice of AGM 
which is available at www.drax.
com, and will be dispatched to 
shareholders who have 
requested a hard copy of the 
documentation from the 
Company. All shareholders 
are invited to vote on the 
resolutions and the results 
are made available after the 
meeting and published on 
our website.
Why it is important
The AGM provides all 
shareholders with a forum to 
put questions to the Board of 
Directors, and to vote on 
important issues.
Frequency
Once a year.
3. SELL-SIDE ANALYST  
ENGAGEMENT
The executive directors and 
members of the senior 
management team engage with 
sell-side analysts formally at the 
full and half year results 
presentations. In addition, the 
Group CFO and Head of Investor 
Relations are in regular dialogue 
with analysts as they publish 
research on the Company.
Why it is important
Sell-side analysts write research 
on the Company, which is sent 
to their clients, existing and 
prospective investors. It is 
therefore important that 
analysts have up-to-date and 
accurate information on the 
business and its strategy in order 
to present an informed view to 
the equity market.
Frequency
Periodically.
4. CAPITAL MARKETS 
DAY EVENTS
A Capital Markets Day was 
held in June and included 
management presentations. 
The executive directors were 
present, as well as members of 
the senior management team.
Why it is important
Capital Markets Days allow the 
Group to provide the capital 
markets with insight on strategy 
as well as the different aspects 
of the business and expand on 
its plans to create shareholder 
value.
Frequency
Periodically.

Communications with shareholders are given a high priority and the 
Chairman is keen to ensure that he maintains an open relationship 
with the Company’s major shareholders and communicates directly 
with them and offers them the opportunity to meet any other 
directors. This enables the Board to understand their views on the 
Group and its governance. The Company has implemented the 
provisions of the Companies Act 2006 regarding electronic 
communication with its shareholders, in order to give shareholders 
more choice and flexibility in how they receive information from the 
Company. The Group’s website www.drax.com contains a wide 
range of information on the Group, including a dedicated Investors 
section and all information reported to the market via a regulatory 
information service also appears as soon as practicable on 
the website.
Financial results are communicated to the market twice a year and 
at the preliminary and interim results, a presentation is given to 
sell-side analysts, which is made available to the public through a 
webcast on the Group’s website www.drax.com. The Board also 
reviews and discusses the investor feedback from post-results 
investor meetings conducted by the Group Chief Executive and the 
Chief Financial Ofﬁcer. The Group engages Makinson Cowell, part of 
the KPMG Group, to advise and assist with communications with 
shareholders and regularly discusses matters with its brokers, 
JP Morgan.
This year the Chair of the Remuneration Committee, Tony Thorne, 
also consulted with shareholders on the proposed changes to the 
current remuneration policy.

Communication with shareholders and 
shareholder representative bodies on proposed 
changes to the Company’s remuneration policy
The Company’s private registered shareholders hold, in aggregate, 
approximately 0.65% of the issued share capital. The Board is as 
interested in their views as it is in the views of institutional and 
corporate shareholders. All shareholders are free to put questions to 
the Board at the AGM. Questions asked in person at the AGM will 
receive a verbal response whenever possible. Otherwise, a written 
response will be provided as soon as practicable after the AGM. 
Questions asked at other times will normally receive a written 
response. Shareholders attending the AGM will have an opportunity 
to meet informally with the directors immediately after the meeting.
The Annual report and accounts is available to shareholders at least 
20 working days before the AGM. Registered shareholders receive a 
Form of Proxy which allows them to vote for or against, or to abstain, 
on each resolution. Particulars of aggregate proxies lodged are 
announced to the London Stock Exchange and appear on the 
Group’s website as soon as practicable after the conclusion of 
the AGM.
OTHER STAKEHOLDER ENGAGEMENT
We communicate with our employees through various channels 
such as open forums and the employee newsletter. We seek 
employee feedback through our All Ideas Matter (AIM) initiative and 
we regularly carry out a full employee engagement survey with 
Towers Watson. 
We strive to have a positive impact on local communities and work 
hard to ensure we understand the potential impacts of our business 
now, and in the future. We regularly meet with local people, as well as 
with community and local authority representatives, to make sure 
that people’s voices are heard. We work closely with a number of 
trade and industry associations, particularly those active in energy, 
renewable energy, timber and forestry sectors, and our Corporate 
Affairs team engages with regulators and policy makers to ensure 
our business understands and contributes to the evolving 
regulatory agenda. Sustainability remains at the heart of our 
business and as we grow this will be a continued focus to enable us 
to achieve a positive economic, social and environmental impact.
The feedback from all of these activities is available to the Board 
through the Executive Committee, ensuring that the interests of 
all stakeholders are considered, when relevant, in decision making. 
This is supportive of the Board’s duty to promote the success of 
the Company as set out in Section 172 of the Companies Act 2006. 
(For further detail and information on stakeholder engagement 
and communication please refer to pages 42–45.)

NOMINATION COMMITTEE REPORT CONTINUED
The Chairman of the Committee reports on the Committee’s 
proceedings to the following Board meeting.
The Committee has had a busy year as following Dorothy 
Thompson’s decision to stand down as Group Chief Executive Ofﬁcer 
(CEO). it led the process of the search for a replacement. Will 
Gardiner, formerly Group Chief Financial Ofﬁcer (CFO) was appointed 
as the new Group CEO, effective 1 January 2018 with Den Jones 
appointed as Interim Group CFO until the process for appointing 
a permanent Group CFO has been completed. 
During the year an additional non-executive director, David 
Nussbaum, was appointed and the announcement of another 
non-executive director, Nicola Hodson, to be appointed in January 
2018, was made.
DIRECTORATE CHANGES
The past year has been a signiﬁcant year for the Board with the 
announcement in September 2017 that Will Gardiner, Group CFO was 
to succeed Dorothy Thompson as Group CEO with effect from 
1 January 2018 following Dorothy Thompson’s decision to step down 
after 12 years as Group CEO.
Will’s appointment is a natural progression after two years 
working alongside Dorothy developing the new strategy. The 
Board is progressing the process to appoint a permanent Group 
CFO as soon as practicable, but in the meantime Den Jones was 
appointed on 1 November 2017 as Interim Group CFO. Den is highly 
experienced, having previously been the CFO at Johnson Matthey 
and BG Group.
On behalf of the Board I would like to thank Dorothy for her 
enormous contribution to Drax. She has led the transformation of 
the business during her tenure and leaves the Group in a strong 
position with a clear strategy that lays the foundations for further 
success in a changing energy sector.
I am pleased to welcome two new non-executive directors to the 
Board, David Nussbaum and Nicola Hodson. David, who was 
appointed on 1 August 2017, has a strong background in 
sustainability, environmental, ethical and social responsibility, and 
Nicola, who was appointed on 12 January 2018, has signiﬁcant 
experience in the technology, business transformation, IT, sales and 
marketing and energy sectors. I am conﬁdent that with their breadth 
of experience and expertise, they will be valuable additions to the 
Board.
NON-EXECUTIVE DIRECTORS
It is the Board’s policy that each non-executive director will be 
appointed for a term of three years which, subject to the Board being 
satisﬁed as to the director’s performance and commitment, and a 
resolution to re-elect at the appropriate AGM, may be renewed by 
mutual agreement. The Board will not normally extend the 
aggregate period of service of any independent non-executive 
director beyond nine years, and any proposal made to extend a 
non-executive director’s aggregate period of ofﬁce beyond six years 
is subject to rigorous review. All directors are subject to annual 
re-election at our Annual General Meeting.
BOARD AND COMMITTEE EVALUATION
The Board continually strives to improve its effectiveness and 
recognises that the performance evaluation process represents an 
annual opportunity to enhance overall Board effectiveness. In 2016 
the Board conducted an externally facilitated Board evaluation 
which resulted in some important recommendations for improving 
the Board’s effectiveness which have subsequently been 
implemented, including inviting advisers and external experts to 
selectively attend Board meetings to share their perspective on the 
business and the markets in which we operate. In 2017 the Board 
received presentations from external consultants on: energy, 
marketing and branding, and from the Company’s brokers. 
In addition, presentations from Group senior management were 
received on a wide range of issues such as safety, operational 
integrity, risk analysis, IT and cyber security, people development, 
innovation and development. There has also been some 
restructuring of how the Board conducts its meetings in order to 
increase the effectiveness of meetings, by the introduction of 
pre-meetings for the Chairman and non-executive directors before 
the Board meeting.
This year, in view of the externally facilitated evaluation carried out 
in 2016, it was agreed that an internal Board performance evaluation 
would be most beneﬁcial to the Company. The Chairman and the 
Company Secretary discussed how best to facilitate this and it was 
decided that the Company Secretary should prepare a questionnaire 
for this purpose.
The questionnaire was approved by the Chairman and was 
subsequently completed by all directors to evaluate the 
performance of the Board, each of its committees and individual 
Board members. Following completion of the questionnaires, the 
Chairman held a series of one-to-one meetings with each of the 
directors in order to discuss the outcomes of the evaluation.

Drax Group plc Annual report and accounts 2017

The main points arising from the 2017 performance evaluation 
include the following:
Key strengths
 – Board meetings are conducted in a way that ensures open and 
meaningful participation. Non-executive directors are given 
full transparency and are actively included on all matters. The 
Board also has regular engagement with management levels 
below the executive, through presentations and visits to all 
business units.
 – The Board is very aware of the risk of political and regulatory 
changes. There is strong engagement with policy makers. The 
executives keep the non-executives well informed of political 
and regulatory developments, and key milestones.
 – The Board has an appropriate variety of skills and experience 
which is aligned to the strategy.
 – The Board is very effective in managing change within the 
business. The organisation has managed a signiﬁcant scale 
change over the last few years which has gone well.
 – The duties and responsibilities of the Board and its committees 
have been clearly deﬁned and are carried out well.
 – The ethics and corporate responsibility processes are highly 
effective.
Principal areas of focus for 2018
 – Improving diversity, as it was recognised that additional focus is 
needed to further widen the composition of the Board.
 – The Board has developed a clear and coherent strategy. The 
focus is now on the successful implementation of this strategy.
 – Risk – increased discussion on risk and the Board’s appetite 
for risk.
 – More focus on assessing the non-ﬁnancial, qualitative and 
quantitative measures when assessing company performance.
 – Further examination of new technologies in the energy sector, 
and continued focus on cyber security risk.
 – Implementation of the new employee performance and 
appraisal process to drive forward talent development.
SUCCESSION PLANNING AND DIVERSITY
Maintaining and improving the effectiveness of the Group’s 
succession planning process is key to the success of the business 
in the future. Selecting and supporting the right individuals are 
essential in leading the delivery of the new strategy. We will be 
assisted in this by the implementation of the new people strategy 
which will help to create opportunities for talented individuals to 
develop and to lead the Group in the future.
Diversity is one aspect of the succession planning process and 
includes: gender, age, race, religion, background and experience. 
The Board is committed to expanding the diversity of the workforce 
across the Group, including its top management. This ongoing 
commitment is reflected in the recent appointments of David 
Nussbaum and Nicola Hodson to the Board. 
SKILLS AND KNOWLEDGE OF THE BOARD
A key responsibility of the Committee is to ensure that the Board 
maintains a balance of skills, knowledge and experience appropriate 
to the operation of the business and required to deliver the strategy. 
As in past years, the Nomination Committee has reviewed the 
composition of the Board and as part of this review the Committee 
considered whether the:
 – Board contains the right mix of skills, experience and diversity; 
 – Board has an appropriate balance of executive directors and 
non-executive directors; and
 – non-executive directors are able to commit sufﬁcient time to the 
Company in order to discharge their responsibilities effectively.
Following the review, the Committee was satisﬁed that the Board 
continues to have an appropriate mix of skills and experience to 
operate effectively. All the directors have many years of experience, 
all gained from a broad range of businesses and they collectively 
bring a range of expertise and knowledge of different business 
sectors to Board deliberations, which encourage constructive, 
challenging and innovative discussions.
In addition to the speciﬁc focus for 2017, there is an annual 
programme of work which is designed to fulﬁl its principal duties. 
This programme reviews:
 – Re-election and appointment of directors  
The Committee met on 15 February 2018, following the 
completion of the 2017 Board evaluation and performance review 
process, (described above) and determined that all of the directors 
who are the subject of annual re-election will retire at the 
forthcoming AGM and, being eligible, offer themselves for 
re-election. The Board evaluation and performance review 
concluded that the directors offering themselves for re-election 
continue to demonstrate commitment to their particular role and 
to perform effectively. 
 – Size, structure and composition of the Board  
At its meeting in February 2017, the Chairman provided the 
Committee with an update in the search for and recruitment of 
two additional non-executive director roles. The Committee 
concluded that the Board, constituted with three executive 
directors, ﬁve independent non-executive directors and a 
Chairman who was independent on appointment, was appropriate 
for the Company . 
 – Membership of Board committees  
It is the Board’s policy to invite all independent non-executive 
directors to join the Audit, Nomination and Remuneration 
committees. The Committee reviewed this policy, and also the 
composition of the Board committees. It was noted that the 
committees remained compliant with the provisions of the Code 
and thus no changes to membership of the committees were 
recommended.

 – Succession planning  
The Committee reviews the succession plan at least annually. 
The Group has a well-established and robust succession planning 
process, which covers all Executive Committee members and their 
direct reports, as well as other individuals within the Group who 
have been identiﬁed as having longer-term potential for senior 
roles. In the Committee’s opinion, the plan is well prepared and 
appropriate for the size of the Group’s business and management 
structure, and there is a range of strong candidates for most 
senior roles. Any potential gaps are the subject of both internal 
development plans and/or selected external recruitment. 
 – Appointment of new Group CEO  
The Committee led the process for the search of a new Group CEO 
to replace Dorothy Thompson. The Committee engaged an 
external recruitment agency, Russell Reynolds, to assist in the 
search. Russell Reynolds does not have any other connection with 
the Company. A suitable list of external candidates was drawn up 
and an assessment of both the external and internal candidates 
was carried out. A shortlist of candidates then met the Committee 
and it was decided to appoint Will Gardiner. 
 – Appointment of two new non-executive directors  
The Committee continued its search to broaden non-executive 
strength and diversify the Board’s skills and experience base, 
leading to the appointments of David Nussbaum in August 2017 
and Nicola Hodson in January 2018. External recruitment 
agencies, Acre and Heidrick & Struggles, were used to assist in the 
recruitment process for David Nussbaum and Nicola Hodson 
respectively. Aside from assisting with recruitment, Acre and 
Heidrick & Struggles have no other connection with the Company. 
 – Board diversity  
In addition to the regular programme of work and the evaluation 
mentioned below, the Committee recognises the diversity 
challenge and considers the question of Board diversity in its 
widest sense, and gender diversity in particular. The Committee 
identiﬁed a number of additional capabilities in its non-executive 
director search speciﬁcation which were used in the successful 
recruitment of David Nussbaum, who has a background in the 
charity and sustainability sectors, and Nicola Hodson who has 
extensive experience in technology, business transformation, IT 
sales and marketing, and energy. The Committee recognises the 
strength that can be achieved through diversity in the Group’s 
management and this is an important consideration in the 
recruitment, promotion and training of the senior management 
team. The Company participated in the Hampton Alexander 
review into increasing the number of women in senior positions in 
FTSE 350 companies. The Board fully supports the ﬁndings of this 
review. Looking forward we have further opportunities to address 
our diversity agenda. We have already started in 2018 the search 
to recruit a non-executive director who will shadow David Lindsell 
as Chair of the Audit Committee, and in 2019 the scheduled 
retirements of Tim Cobbold and Tony Thorne from the Board will 
provide further planned opportunities. To assist in this process the 
Board plans to only use executive search agencies which have 
signed up to the Hampton Alexander voluntary code of conduct 
on gender diversity. Further details of our commitment to diversity 
can be found on page 40.

STRATEGY IN PROGRESS
Induction of 
David Nussbaum
All new directors receive a comprehensive 
and tailored induction programme including 
wider background brieﬁngs on the Group’s 
activities, meetings with key managers and 
visits to the Group’s operational sites. In 
August 2017 David Nussbaum joined the 
Board as an independent non-executive 
director, bringing with him valuable 
experience and expertise particularly in 
the charity and sustainability sectors. 
David’s induction programme included a 
visit to our US operations, and the Drax 
Power Station site in Selby which included 
a site tour and meetings with some of the
senior management team as well as the 
Group Company Secretary who provided 
an overview of the Board procedures and 
governance framework. David was provided 
with a comprehensive induction pack 
which contained a wide range of material 
including: Board papers and minutes of 
previous meetings; schedule of matters 
reserved for the Board; schedule of dates 
for Board and committee meetings; terms 
of reference for all Board committees; 
Group company structure chart and senior 
management structure chart.
RENEWAL AND RE-ELECTION
The Company’s Articles provide that, unless otherwise determined 
by the Company, the Board must consist of at least two, and no more 
than 15 directors. The shareholders and the Board have the power to 
appoint any person who is willing to act as a director. If the Board 
appoints a director, that director must retire at the ﬁrst AGM 
following their appointment. That director may, if they so wish, put 
themselves forward for re-election. Nicola Hodson and David 
Nussbaum were appointed by the Board subsequent to the 2017 
AGM and therefore they will retire and offer themselves for re-
election by shareholders at the forthcoming AGM. 
The Articles provide that, one-third of directors shall retire by 
rotation each year and are eligible for re-election by shareholders at 
the AGM. In accordance with the Code, the Company will continue 
its practice to propose all directors for annual re-election. 
Accordingly, each of Tim Cobbold, Philip Cox, Will Gardiner, Andy 
Koss, David Lindsell and Tony Thorne will retire at the forthcoming 
AGM and, being eligible, offer themselves up for re-election.
Following the evaluation and review of the Board described above, 
I concluded that the directors offering themselves for re-election 
continue to demonstrate commitment, management and industry 
expertise in their particular role and continue to perform effectively. 
The re-election of each director is recommended by the Board. 
Details of the service contracts for the executive directors and 
letters of appointment for the non-executive directors are set out 
in a table on page 103.
The Company may however, remove a director by ordinary resolution 
before the expiration of the director’s period of ofﬁce (without 
prejudice to any claim the director may have for breach of any 
service contract) and may appoint another person who is willing to 
act to be a director in their place. The replacement director is 
regarded as a director from the outgoing director’s date of last 
appointment/re-appointment.
The executive directors’ service contracts and non-executive 
directors’ letters of appointment are available for inspection by 
prior arrangement during normal business hours at the Company’s 
registered ofﬁce. They will also be available for inspection at the 
venue of the AGM, prior to the meeting, details of which are 
contained in the Notice of Meeting.
During the year, the Chairman held meetings with the non-executive 
directors in the absence of the executive directors, and, separately, 
the Senior Independent Director held a meeting with the non-
executive directors without the Chairman being present, as required 
by provision A.4.2 of the Code.
This report was reviewed and approved by the Nomination 
Committee on 26 February 2018.

AUDIT COMMITTEE REPORT CONTINUED
The Committee met twice in the absence of management with each of the external auditor (February and July) and Head of Group Risk 
and Internal Audit (April and November). No matters of concern were drawn to the Committee’s attention at any of these meetings. The 
Committee’s understanding with both the external and internal auditor is that, if they should at any time become aware of any matters 
giving them material concern, they will immediately draw it to the Committee’s attention via the Chairman of the Committee. 
REVIEWING THE 2017 ANNUAL REPORT AND ACCOUNTS
Between the year-end date and the date of the approval of the annual report and accounts, the Committee met in February 2018 principally 
to review the draft 2017 Annual report and accounts and the external auditor’s ﬁndings. The Committee reviewed papers prepared by 
management on accounting issues and judgements affecting the accounts and a report from Deloitte LLP setting out their audit ﬁndings. 
The Committee also reviewed the underlying process, internal controls, forecasts and relevant assumptions made in preparing the Viability 
Statement, disclosed on page 50. Having challenged the assumptions made in this process and considered the appropriateness of the 
three-year period of assessment, the Committee concluded that the process supporting the Viability Statement was robust.
Explanations of the critical accounting judgements, estimates and assumptions are set out in detail throughout the notes to the 
consolidated ﬁnancial statements, with a summary on pages 119 and 120 which also includes an explanation of the two non-IFRS measures 
of performance used by the Group. The Committee reviewed these aspects of the ﬁnancial statements, paying particular attention to those 
issues that involve the most subjective and complex judgements, namely impairment of ﬁxed assets, valuation of derivative ﬁnancial 
instruments and business combinations, which are discussed below. In previous years, ROC valuations were among such aspects. However, 
following several years in which the net realised value of ROCs, including value recovered through the ROC recycling fund, has not differed 
signiﬁcantly from the expected realisable value at which they were stated in the balance sheet, the Committee no longer considers the 
valuation of ROCs to be subject to such a high level of subjectivity and complexity. 
The existence and valuation of fuel inventories was also regarded as an area of signiﬁcant risk in previous years, principally due to the need to 
derive year-end volumes of biomass on-site at Drax Power Station from data on the weight of inventory movements and thermal efﬁciency 
calculations, since it is not practicable to physically count the stocks at the year end. During 2017, management reviewed the IT systems 
which sit behind the weighing process, the data flows between them, and the accuracy of the calculations, all of which has provided greater 
assurance regarding the accuracy of the biomass inventory valuation. The Committee noted also that an internal audit review was carried 
out during the year of the processes and controls to manage biomass stocks held off-site and managed by third-party service providers, and 
that the review had concluded that the controls in place to measure and report biomass volumes were appropriate in design and effective in 
operation. Accordingly, the Committee does not regard biomass inventories as a signiﬁcant issue in relation to the 2017 ﬁnancial statements.
The signiﬁcant issues in relation to the ﬁnancial statements were as follows: 
Matter
Issue and key judgements
Factors considered and conclusions reached
Carrying value of 
Power Generation 
ﬁxed assets
In 2017 the market capitalisation of the Group remained 
materially below the carrying value of the Group’s net 
assets. In addition, the value of Sterling against both 
the Euro and US Dollar indicated a potentially material 
increase in the long-term costs of fuel for our generation 
business, which are predominantly priced in these 
currencies.
As a result, in accordance with the requirements of IFRS, 
management conducted an impairment review in respect 
of the Drax Power cash-generating unit (CGU). They did 
so by comparing the present value of the future cash 
flows of the CGU with the carrying value of its tangible 
and intangible assets.
The assumptions that underpin such calculations 
are, by their nature, dependent upon the application 
of judgement and are thus subject to uncertainty. In 
particular this is because observable market information 
is only available for a limited proportion of the remaining 
lives of the Group’s power generation assets.
Management presented an overview of the methodology 
and most critical assumptions to the Committee meeting 
in November 2017.
The Committee reviewed an updated report at its 
meeting in February 2018 that considered reﬁnements in 
assumptions and key judgements up to the present time, 
as described in note 2.4.
It was noted that the cash flows that underpin the 
value in use calculation for the Drax Power CGU were 
derived from the Group’s ﬁve-year business plan, which 
was subject to review by the Board in January 2018. 
This review included challenge of the key assumptions, 
including commodity and currency forward curves, the 
expected useful life of the coal generating units (see note 
3.1) and revenue sources after the expiry of the current 
Renewables Obligation certiﬁcate scheme in 2027.
After challenging management regarding these longer-
term assumptions, the Committee concluded that a 
reasonable, supportable and consistent approach had 
been taken in preparing the review and that there was no 
current indication of impairment.

Matter
Issue and key judgements
Factors considered and conclusions reached
Valuation of 
derivative ﬁnancial 
instruments
The Group makes extensive use of derivative ﬁnancial 
instruments in order to manage key risks facing the 
business and its balance sheet includes signiﬁcant 
assets and liabilities arising from derivatives which are 
stated at their fair value. In particular, the asset values of 
forward foreign currency purchase contracts reduced 
substantially in the period following the recovery 
of Sterling against US Dollar.
Changes in the fair value of such instruments are 
recognised in the income statement or when the speciﬁc 
criteria for hedge accounting are met, in the hedge 
reserve.
The fair values for derivative ﬁnancial instruments are 
determined using forward price curves and, where an 
instrument incorporates an element of optionality, an 
option pricing model.
The inputs to these calculations include assumptions 
regarding future transactions and market movements, 
as well as credit risk, and are therefore subjective.
The Committee reviewed the Group’s derivative position 
in February, July and November 2017 having regard in 
particular to the critical judgemental areas described in 
note 7.2 and considered the position as at 31 December 
2017 at its meeting in February 2018.
At each meeting, management explained the trends 
in market prices that underpinned changes in the fair 
value of the derivative portfolio and highlighted any 
new types of derivative instrument for the Committee’s 
consideration.
The Committee concluded that the fair value calculations 
had been performed in a reasonable and consistent 
manner based on quoted market prices as explained 
in note 7.2 and that the system of controls in place was 
ﬁt for purpose. Accordingly, it was concluded that the 
amounts included in the ﬁnancial statements were 
appropriate.
Business 
combinations
During the year, the Group acquired Opus Energy Group 
Limited, a well-established energy retail business serving 
customers in the SME market. To account for the 
business combination the identiﬁable assets acquired 
and liabilities assumed are required to be measured 
at their acquisition-date fair values. This process can 
require estimation of the effects of uncertain events on 
those assets and liabilities. In the case of Opus Energy, 
as stated page 148, the fair value measurement of the 
existing customer contracts depends on a number of 
assumptions, and in particular requires estimates to be 
made of likely margins on current customer contracts, 
future contract renewal rates and future margins on 
renewed contracts.
The Committee reviewed management reports detailing 
the valuations and key judgements and estimates, noting 
that management had been assisted by independent 
valuation specialists in measuring the fair value of 
existing customer contracts. The Committee concluded 
that the assumptions used to value the contracts were 
appropriately supported and reasonable.
Unbilled B2B Energy 
Supply revenue
The acquisition of Opus Energy resulted in a signiﬁcant 
increase in the amount of revenue from electricity and 
gas supplied to customers between the date of the last 
meter reading and the ﬁnancial year end. The amount 
of this revenue is based on estimates in relation to the 
volume of energy consumed and the valuation of that 
consumption.
The Committee reviewed the process for and 
assumptions applied in determining the calculation 
of unbilled receivables, noting that historically, ﬁnal 
settlements had been closely in line with the unbilled 
receivables recognised in the ﬁnancial statements. The 
Committee concluded that the process and assumptions 
applied were appropriate and reasonable.
FAIR, BALANCED AND UNDERSTANDABLE
As a result of its review of the Annual report and accounts, underpinned by its discussions with operating and ﬁnance management 
regarding the strategic report, and with the Group ﬁnance team regarding the ﬁnancial statements, the Audit Committee advised the 
Board that, in the Committee’s view, the Annual report and accounts, taken as a whole, is fair, balanced and understandable and provides 
the information necessary for shareholders to assess the company’s position and performance, business model and strategy.
REVIEW OF AUDIT COMMITTEE EFFECTIVENESS BY MEMBERS
In line with the FRC’s Guidance on Audit Committees, the Committee reviewed its own effectiveness and concluded that the composition 
of its membership, the manner in which it operates and the reviews that it undertakes throughout the year all contribute to the 
continued effective functioning of the Committee.
The Board performance evaluation questionnaire referred to on page 72 included questions on the effectiveness of the Audit Committee, in 
particular its effectiveness in monitoring the integrity of the Group’s ﬁnancial statements, the Group’s internal controls and risk management 
systems, its arrangements and processes to ensure compliance with its ethical standards, and the effectiveness of the internal audit 
activities and the external audit process. The questionnaire also asked whether the Committee has sufﬁcient expertise, time and access to 
key staff and information to enable it to discharge its monitoring and oversight role effectively. Based on responses to the questionnaire, the 
Committee, the members of which between them have extensive experience and expertise in business management, ﬁnancial management, 
ﬁnancial reporting and auditing, discharged its responsibilities effectively in 2017.

AUDIT COMMITTEE REPORT CONTINUED
EXTERNAL AUDITOR EFFECTIVENESS
The Committee reviewed the effectiveness of the external auditor, 
Deloitte LLP, who have performed the role continuously since the 
Company’s listing in 2005 and were reappointed in 2017 following a 
tender process. The review of effectiveness incorporated feedback 
from management and key individuals across the Group, as well as 
the Committee’s own experience. The assessment considered the 
independence and objectivity of Deloitte, the robustness of the 
audit process, the quality of delivery of the audit plan, the quality of 
reporting on ﬁndings and recommendations to the Committee and 
management, and the experience and expertise of the audit team 
and the quality of service provided.
INDEPENDENCE OF THE EXTERNAL AUDIT
The Group has an Auditor Independence Policy, the provisions of 
which include:
 
– seeking conﬁrmation that the auditor is, in its professional 
judgement, independent of the Group, and obtaining from 
it an account of all relationships which may affect the ﬁrm’s 
independence and the objectivity of the audit partner and staff; 
 
– a requirement to rotate the lead audit partner every ﬁve years. The 
current lead audit partner, James Leigh, has completed four years 
of his term;
 
– a policy governing the engagement of the auditor to conduct 
non-audit work, under which: 
• the auditor may not be engaged to provide certain categories of 
work, including those where they may be required to audit their 
own work or make management decisions, or where the auditor 
would act in an advocacy role for the Group; 
• there is a clear approval process for engaging the auditor to 
conduct other categories of non-audit work, subject to ﬁnancial 
limits. Permitted non-audit services for which the fee exceeds 
£50,000 is required to be approved in advance by the Audit 
Committee;
• all engagements of the auditor to conduct non-audit work are 
reported to the next meeting of the Committee; and 
• the balance between the fees paid to the external auditor for 
audit and non-audit work is monitored by the Committee. 
The Policy can be found on the Company’s website at  
www.drax.com.
The Committee receives reports from the external auditor on its 
own processes and procedures, to ensure its independence and 
objectivity and to ensure compliance with the relevant standards.
Details of the amounts paid to the external auditor during the year 
for audit and other services are set out in note 2.3 to the 
consolidated ﬁnancial statements on page 131.
No contractual obligations exist that restrict the Group’s choice of 
external auditor.
AUDITOR REAPPOINTMENT
The Group has complied with the provisions of The Statutory Audit 
Services for Large Companies Market Investigation (Mandatory Use 
of Competitive Tender Processes and Audit Committee 
Responsibilities) Order 2014.
The Group conducted a tender to appoint the external auditor during 
2016 and the Board agreed to reappoint Deloitte LLP. Deloitte have 
now been the Group’s auditor for the past 12 years.
Having considered the effectiveness and independence of the 
external auditor as described above, the Audit Committee agreed to 
recommend to the Board that the a resolution to reappoint Deloitte 
LLP as the company’s external auditor should be put to shareholders 
at the AGM in April 2018.
INTERNAL AUDIT
The Group operates a co-sourced model for its internal audit 
function.
Under this model, the internal team conducts core ﬁnancial control 
reviews. Reviews of specialist technical areas are outsourced to 
ﬁrms with appropriate experience and qualiﬁcations.
The Committee receives reports at each meeting regarding the 
internal audit programme and reviews undertaken. 
Recommendations are made to management for control 
improvements as appropriate. Topics dealt with by internal audit 
reports reviewed by the Committee during 2017 included:
 
– ROC controls and veriﬁcation
 
– Fixed asset capitalisation
 
– Financial risk management processes
 
– Controls around the power trading strategy
 
– Foreign currency risk management
 
– Cyber security
 
– Derivatives accounting
 
– Off-site biomass stocks
 
– Opus Energy commodity hedging
In addition, at the April and November meetings the Committee 
received reports detailing progress with implementing 
recommendations previously raised by internal audit. Following the 
most recent of these updates, in November 2017, the Committee was 
satisﬁed that management is taking appropriate steps to deal with 
the recommendations raised.
The Chairman of the Committee, independent of management, 
maintains regular and direct contact with both the internal and 
external auditor, allowing open dialogue and feedback. At it’s annual 
review, the Committee concluded that the internal audit function 
remains effective.
This report was reviewed and approved by the Audit Committee on 
15 February 2018.

REMUNERATION COMMITTEE REPORT CONTINUED
ANNUAL STATEMENT TO SHAREHOLDERS
Dear shareholders
This report reviews the key matters considered by the Remuneration 
Committee in the past year and the future matters we expect to 
consider. Before reviewing the past year I want to highlight two 
proposed changes in the current remuneration policy that require 
your consideration.
We believe the changes to be incremental to the approved policy 
but we are required to submit the revised policy to a shareholder 
vote at the 2018 AGM. We hope that the revised policy will receive 
your support. 
Technically the revised policy, if approved, would be valid for three 
years, until the AGM in 2021. However, we intend to keep to the 
timetable for the original policy. Therefore, we will make a full review 
of the revised policy in 2019, incorporating the results of this review 
into a new policy for shareholder consideration at the 2020 AGM. 
CHANGES TO THE REMUNERATION POLICY
At the 2017 AGM, shareholders approved a new remuneration policy 
for the executive directors. A component of this policy, namely the 
operation of the annual bonus, applies both to executive directors 
and employees. As part of a wider project to align processes and raise 
efﬁciency, a decision has been taken as to how the bonus formula will 
apply to employees from the ﬁnancial year ending 31 December 2018 
onwards. The changes we are proposing comprise two amendments 
to the approved Remuneration Policy, which are designed to ensure 
a consistent approach to our bonus arrangements for executive 
directors and employees. These changes are set out in detail in the 
report but in summary they are:
(i) removal of the personal performance component of the bonus 
formula. In future, bonuses will be earned for the delivery of 
stretching corporate and divisional related ﬁnancial, strategic 
and operational targets, as measured through the Corporate 
Scorecard; and 
(ii) an increase in the level of Corporate Scorecard performance 
which must be attained for maximum bonus payout, thereby 
strengthening the link between corporate performance and 
incentive payouts.
The rigour in setting and scoring the Corporate Scorecard will not 
be changed. The Committee will retain the discretion to adjust the 
bonus if the Corporate Scorecard outcome is not reflective of 
corporate or an individual executive’s performance.
The proposed changes simplify the remuneration arrangements 
for the executive directors as well as aligning the approach to bonus 
for all employees. As set out further in the report, I believe that the 
removal of the personal performance component also addresses the 
concern raised by shareholders in feedback on our current policy 
about the continuing use of such a component in the determination 
of bonus.
We are not proposing changes to the 2017 Performance Share Plan. 
Therefore our incentive arrangements will be linked only to 
performance under the Corporate Scorecard and Total Shareholder 
Return from 2018.
The proposed changes substantially toughen the operation of bonus 
arrangements. The Committee recognises that they will most likely 
lead to lower bonuses but believes it right that the bonus outcome 
should be on demonstrable performance and that there is a 
consistent approach across all employees. I would add that the 
changes have the full support of the executive directors.
Full details on the changes and the policy are set out later in the report.
REVIEW OF 2017 
2017 was the ﬁrst year following the announcement of our new 
strategy. It was a year of change and challenge for the Group as we 
set about implementing this strategy. Management delivered a 
substantial uplifting of ﬁnancial performance, with EBITDA of £229 
million (2016: £140 million). This was principally due to high levels of 
renewable generation, but also from the growth of our B2B Energy 
Supply business. A new capital structure and dividend policy were 
concluded, which will see the Group pay a sustainable and growing 
dividend to shareholders.
In support of the strategy, the Group acquired Opus Energy (the 
leading challenger brand in the UK SME energy market). In-sourcing 
of this business has progressed well. The Group also acquired a third 
biomass pellet plant (LaSalle Bioenergy). This has been upgraded and 
at the end of the year was commissioning. In Power Generation, plans 
for a fourth biomass unit were progressed. Having received the 
necessary Government support the conversion will go ahead in 2018. 
The development of the options for rapid response gas generation at 
four sites around the UK was continued, with two sites ready for 
construction, subject to securing a capacity market agreement. The 
repowering project, being two combined cycle gas turbine plants 
plus battery storage, to be built on the Drax site, was scoped and 
taken into the planning process. 
Operationally, performance was mixed. The ramp up of pellet output 
at Drax Biomass was down on plan but this reflected a slower start to 
the year, followed by a strong ﬁnish which augurs well for 2018. 
Power Generation continued to meet a signiﬁcant amount of the 
UK’s renewable electricity and provided good support to the 
electricity system’s stability. However, plant availability was below 
plan, including the December unplanned outage which impacted 
the end of 2017 with the disruption continuing into 2018. The energy 
supply businesses performed well. Opus Energy met the planned 
EBITDA and had a high customer retention while Haven Power 
exceeded planned EBITDA and was well up on the prior year.
Management continued to make the case for biomass with the result 
that the Government, in early 2018, provided the necessary support 
to allow the conversion of a fourth unit. There was continued high 
attention to biomass sustainability. Feedback to the Board from 
various site visits and the results of third party audits gives 
conﬁdence that sustainability is well embedded.

The Group is committed to paying an externally competitive salary 
consistent with an employee’s role. In order to provide the basis 
for a consistent approach to setting salary across the Group, 
management carried out a Group-wide job grading and salary 
benchmarking exercise. The results will now be worked through. This 
exercise was in addition to the review of performance management 
that led to the changes in the bonus formula discussed above. In line 
with the Gender Pay Gap reporting requirements, details for the 
individual subsidiary companies in the UK will be submitted by the 
required deadline. 
I hope you ﬁnd the above statement helpful background to the 
following section on the Committee’s assessment of executive 
performance. 
ANNUAL ASSESSMENT OF PERFORMANCE IN 2017 
Please note that the assessment of performance for 2017 is made 
under the current policy. The proposed changes to the policy, as 
described above and in greater detail on page 87, would not come 
into effect until immediately after the 2018 AGM.
The Committee determines the remuneration of the executive 
directors and members of the Executive Committee against the 
strategic objectives and priorities of the company. Executive 
performance is therefore closely aligned to business performance 
with a high proportion of total remuneration delivered through 
variable pay designed to reward achievement of short and long-term 
strategic targets.
There is a detailed review of performance against our balanced 
scorecard measures on page 99. Components within the scorecard 
can be scored between 0 and 2.0. A score of 1 represents an 
on-target performance. For 2017 the Board assessed the overall 
performance at 0.84. The Committee, having reviewed the 
performance of the Group over the year, believes this outturn of the 
Corporate Scorecard is reflective of overall performance.
The score is applied both to the annual bonus and the Bonus 
Matching Plan (BMP). For the purposes of the annual bonus the 
overall score in any year is capped at 1.5. There is no cap on the annual 
score when applied to the BMP scorecard, but there is a cap of 1.5 on 
the average for the three years.
The Committee assessed the personal performance of each 
executive in driving the 2017 performance and delivering on the 
strategy. This assessment was both as regards their individual 
contribution and as a member of the executive team. 
Based on performance, a corporate score of 0.84 out of 2 and 
personal score of 1.25 out of 1.5 was agreed by the Committee, 
resulting in annual bonuses of approximately 53% of maximum. 
The Committee believes that this bonus outcome fairly reflects 
executive directors’ performance. 
LONG-TERM ASSESSMENT OF PERFORMANCE
BMP awards made in 2015 were tested at the end of 2017 by 
reference to relative Total Shareholder Return (TSR) performance 
(50%) and on the three-year average of the Corporate Scorecard 
(50%). The Company’s TSR over the period was below the median of 
the comparator group, and the Committee therefore conﬁrmed that 
none of the TSR element of the award would vest. The average 
Corporate Scorecard outcome over the same period was 0.97 out of 
1.5, and as the vesting threshold is 1.0 there will be a nil vesting of the 
executive directors’ 2015 BMP performance awards.
The Committee decided not to exercise its discretion in determining 
the outcome for the possible vesting of performance awards.
SHAREHOLDER ENGAGEMENT
The current remuneration policy and the Annual Report on 
Remuneration for 2016 were approved by the majority of investors 
in 2017, but we are conscious that a signiﬁcant minority of shares 
were voted against the policy and, particularly, the annual report. The 
Committee has discussed the shareholder feedback and noted areas 
of concern for future consideration. As outlined above, a concern 
we propose to address short term is the use of personal measures 
in the calculation of the executives’ annual bonuses. Our proposal 
to remove the personal element simpliﬁes the remuneration 
arrangements and aligns the approach to the executives’ bonuses 
with that of our other employees. 
We continue to monitor developments in executive remuneration. 
Notably this year, we have considered the likely revisions to 
the Corporate Governance Code. We are supportive of the changes. 
We recognise that these will widen the Remuneration Committee’s 
responsibility, both in overseeing pay arrangements across the 
Company and being seen to take into account the different 
stakeholder views when setting executive director remuneration. 
APPLICATION OF POLICY
During the year we applied the executive remuneration policy 
that was approved by shareholders in 2017. We have listened to 
shareholders and taken account of emerging “best practice” and 
this is reflected in the outcomes to the following areas addressed 
in the year:
(i) proposed an amendment to the policy for 2018 onwards to 
remove the personal element of the annual bonus, which will 
simplify the bonus arrangements, align pay and performance 
and ensure bonus arrangements for executive directors are 
consistent with those for the wider workforce;
(ii) used judgement as regards the treatment of the outgoing Group 
CEO, Dorothy Thompson, taking into account the remuneration 
policy, plan rules and her service agreement;
(iii) applied judgement on the remuneration package for the 
incoming Group CEO, balancing the need to remunerate 
competitively a high quality individual with the objective to stop 
the ratcheting up of remuneration; and
(iv) used judgement in determining the pay outcomes for the year in 
the context of performance achieved.
In addition to the above, the Committee reviewed and approved the 
proposed changes resulting from the extensive project in employee 
job grading and pay benchmarking carried out across the Group.

REMUNERATION COMMITTEE REPORT CONTINUED
CHANGES TO THE BOARD
We announced in September 2017 that Dorothy Thompson, Chief 
Executive Ofﬁcer, had given notice of her intention to stand down as 
Group CEO. It was agreed that she would leave prior to the 
completion of her 12 month notice period on 31 December 2017. 
The Committee undertook a detailed review of the treatment of 
Dorothy’s remuneration, taking into account the circumstances of 
her leaving Drax and her performance up to the date of retirement 
which has continued to be strong. Further detail is provided on the 
individual elements of remuneration within the Annual Report on 
Remuneration but in summary:
 – Dorothy was treated as a good leaver for the purpose of the  
outstanding share awards, with pro-rating from the date the 
award was granted to the date of leaving i.e. 31 December 2017; 
 – pro-rated performance related share awards will vest at the 
normal vesting date subject to performance conditions being met; 
 – pro-rated deferred share awards granted under the legacy BMP 
vested shortly after retirement in accordance with the provisions 
of the previous remuneration policy and the BMP scheme rules; 
and
 – Dorothy is entitled to salary, pension and other beneﬁts for the 
unworked period of notice from 1 January 2018 to 20 September 
2018 and is also contractually eligible to be considered for a bonus 
for the unworked period of notice during which she was unable to 
earn a bonus, with the bonus amount to be determined in the 
usual way for all executives, early in 2019.
The Committee is conﬁdent that the decisions made in relation to 
Dorothy’s remuneration are fair to her and to the Company, taking 
into account her outstanding performance, the agreed termination 
date, the provisions of the remuneration policy applying to executive 
directors and her employment contract. We are conscious that the 
payment of bonus for the unworked notice period as provided for in 
Dorothy’s contract and our remuneration policy, is less common in 
the market and, as discussed with our major shareholders, we have 
committed not to include this for any newly appointed directors in 
future service contracts, including that of the new Group CEO.
Dorothy is succeeded by Will Gardiner, who has been our Group CFO 
since his appointment in November 2015. Will’s base salary was 
increased to £530,000 on his promotion. His other elements of pay 
will be in line with those for Dorothy. Will has been a member of the 
Board over the last two years and is a key architect of the Company 
strategy. We look forward to working with him in his new role over the 
coming years.
A process to appoint a new permanent Group CFO is underway and in 
the meantime Den Jones has been appointed as Interim Group CFO. 
Den is highly experienced, having previously been CFO at Johnson 
Matthey and BG Group.
BASE SALARIES
The salaries of Dorothy Thompson, Will Gardiner and Andy Koss were 
reviewed and increased by 2.5% with effect from 1 April 2017. This was 
in line with the average increase for the wider workforce.
SUMMARY
I, and the other members of the Committee, are satisﬁed that the 
2017 remuneration outcomes fairly reflect corporate and personal 
performance. We are conﬁdent that the changes to our policy to 
remove the personal element of the bonus formula and to increase 
the level of performance required for maximum bonus, provide a fair 
and consistent approach to remuneration across the Group and are 
in the shareholders’ interests.

DIRECTORS’ REMUNERATION POLICY
As set out in the Chairman of the Committee’s Annual Statement to Shareholders, we are proposing changes to the current remuneration 
policy which, in order to be effected, require shareholders’ approval.
This revised remuneration policy, subject to shareholder approval at the 2018 AGM, will be effective from immediately after the AGM on 
25 April 2018. Normally it would be binding on the Group for three years but, as outlined earlier, the Committee intends to review the policy in 
2019 and incorporate the results of this review in a policy to be presented to shareholders at the 2020 AGM. Therefore the results of the 
2018 vote on the revised policy will be binding for two years, until the close of the 2020 AGM. 
The core principles of the remuneration policy are set out below:
 – making sure that executive remuneration is linked strongly to performance and the achievement of strategic objectives;
 – ensuring transparency in executive pay reporting through simpliﬁcation in design and appropriate reporting; 
 – securing and retaining top talent and incentivising strong performance; and 
 – maintaining flexibility, to recognise the uncertain business environment, whilst ensuring that remuneration outcomes are aligned to 
shareholder interests. 
CHANGES TO THE POLICY
As described in the Chairman’s Statement, the proposed changes to the current remuneration policy ensure a consistent approach to our 
bonus arrangements for executive directors and employees. These changes are:
 – removal of the personal performance component of the bonus formula such that the formula moves from target bonus x corporate 
score x personal score to target bonus x corporate score. In future, bonuses will be earned solely for the delivery of stretching corporate 
and divisional related ﬁnancial, strategic and operational targets, as measured through the Corporate Scorecard; and
 – raising the level of Corporate Scorecard performance which must be attained for maximum bonus pay out (from maximum bonus pay out 
being possible at a score of 1.5 to a score of 2.0) thereby strengthening the link between corporate performance and incentive pay outs. 
The rigour in setting and scoring the Corporate Scorecard will not be changed. The proposed changes toughen the operation of bonus 
arrangements as the executives’ personal score in recent years has had the effect of increasing the bonus outcome from what would have 
been earned through the Corporate Scorecard alone. The Committee will retain the overall discretion to adjust the bonus if the Corporate 
Scorecard outcome is not reflective of corporate or individual performance in the year. We are not proposing any other change to the 
Directors’ Remuneration Policy approved at the 2017 AGM, except for minor changes to the wording to clarify the operation of the policy. 
The following is an overview of our remuneration framework under the revised policy.

Drax Group plc Annual report and accounts 2017

KEY COMPONENTS OF REMUNERATION 
The remuneration policy for executive directors has been designed to support the delivery of strong business performance and the creation 
of shareholder value. We set out in the table below the policy relating to the key components of the remuneration policy for executive 
directors, and in the notes following the table we comment on differences between this policy and that for the remuneration of employees 
generally.
BASE SALARY
Base salary helps to attract, reward and retain the right calibre of executive to deliver the leadership and management needed to execute 
the Group’s vision and Business Plan.
PRACTICAL OPERATION
Base salary reflects the role, the executive’s skills and experience, 
and market level. It is paid in 12 monthly instalments.
To determine the market level, the Committee reviews 
remuneration data on executive positions at companies which 
the Committee considers to be appropriate comparators.
The comparator companies are selected, with advice from the 
Committee’s remuneration advisers, taking into account factors 
such as, but not limited to, sector, size, and international presence.
On appointment, an executive director’s base salary is set at the 
market level, or below if the executive is not fully experienced at 
this level.
Where base salary on appointment is below market level to reflect 
experience, it will be increased over time to align with the market 
level, subject to performance.
Base salaries of all executive directors are generally reviewed 
once each year, with increases applying from April. Reviews cover 
individual performance, experience, development in the role and 
market comparisons.
MAXIMUM POTENTIAL VALUE
The base salaries of executive directors in post at the start of the 
policy period, and who remain in the same role throughout the policy 
period, will not usually be increased by a higher percentage than the 
average annual percentage increase in salaries of all other Group 
employees in the Group.
Exceptions to this, subject to performance and development, are 
where:
(i) An executive director has been appointed at below market level to 
reflect experience. Under this scenario, increases will be capped 
at 5% above the average annual percentage increase in salaries of 
all other Group employees. 
(ii) An executive director has been promoted internally and their 
salary is below market level. Under this scenario, increases will not 
be capped and the Committee can increase base salary to the 
market level within an appropriate timeframe. 
PERFORMANCE MEASURES
No performance measures apply.

ANNUAL BONUS
The award of annual bonuses is linked directly to personal performance and to achieving the annual Business Plan targets.
The aim of the deferred portion of annual bonus is to further align executives to shareholders’ interests, by linking share-based reward to 
long-term sustainable performance.
PRACTICAL OPERATION
65% of annual bonus earned is paid in cash, normally three months 
after the end of the ﬁnancial year to which it relates.
35% of annual bonus earned is deferred in nil cost awards over 
shares under the Deferred Share Plan (DSP), which vest after 
three years subject to continued employment or “good leaver” 
termination provisions.
The DSP was introduced in 2017, as a vehicle for deferring the 
relevant proportion of annual bonus in shares.
Annual bonus earned (subject to the maximum opportunity) is:
Target bonus x corporate score.
Target bonus is 50% of maximum.
Corporate score ranges from zero to 2.0.
Each measure in the corporate scorecard is assigned a weighting 
and three performance levels (low, target and stretch). The score is 
zero if performance is below the low target, one if performance is 
at target and two for stretch performance. 
Dividends in respect of the deferred shares are reinvested in 
additional shares, which vest when the deferred shares vest.
In certain circumstances, the Committee can apply clawback to 
any annual bonus awards, as set out in the notes to the policy table.
Summary corporate scorecard and performance results are 
published in the Annual report on remuneration.
The Committee will review the formulaic outcome of the Annual 
bonus and has the discretion to amend the ﬁnal outcome to make 
sure that bonus payments reflect overall performance. The use of 
such discretion will be explained fully in the relevant Annual report 
on remuneration.
MAXIMUM POTENTIAL VALUE
Role
Maximum bonus potential  
(% of base salary)
Chief Executive, Drax Group

There is no payment for below threshold performance.
PERFORMANCE MEASURES
Corporate score is based on performance, against the Corporate 
Scorecard, of strategic and Business Plan targets set, each year, by 
the Committee, in conjunction with the Board. Performance measures 
include ﬁnancial, operational and strategic objectives. Typically, 
across the Group and Business Units, around 40% of the Scorecard 
is based on ﬁnancial objectives, 30–40% on strategic goals with the 
balance on operational issues. The Committee has the discretion to 
vary the weightings from year to year. 
The corporate scorecard is amended each year, in line with business 
strategy and objectives.
In exceptional circumstances such that the Committee believes 
the original measures and/or targets are no longer appropriate, the 
Committee has discretion to amend performance measures and 
targets during the year.

DRAX 2017 PERFORMANCE SHARE PLAN (PSP)
The PSP is the Company’s new long-term incentive plan. It replaces the legacy BMP and links long-term share-based incentives to TSR 
and to the achievement of Business Plan strategic targets.
PRACTICAL OPERATION
The PSP was approved by shareholders at the 2017 AGM.
Under the PSP, executive directors receive an annual grant of nil 
cost conditional awards over shares.
Shares vest on the third anniversary of the grant, subject to 
continued service or “good leaver” termination provisions, and the 
achievement of performance conditions over a three-year period 
determined by the Committee. Vested awards are subject to a 
further holding period of two years.
Dividends or dividend equivalents (which may assume notional 
reinvestment) are paid on PSP awards.
The Committee will include an override provision in each grant 
under the PSP. This will give the Committee discretion to determine 
that no vesting shall occur, or that vesting shall be reduced, if there 
are circumstances (relating to the Company’s overall performance 
or otherwise) which make vesting when calculated by reference to 
the performance conditions alone inappropriate.
In certain circumstances, the Committee can apply malus or 
clawback to unvested/vested awards, as set out in the notes to the 
policy table.
The Committee reserves discretion to:
(i) amend the performance conditions/targets attached to 
outstanding awards granted under this policy, in the event 
of a major corporate event or signiﬁcant change in economic 
circumstances, or a change in accounting standards having 
a material impact on outcomes; and 
(ii) adjust the vesting of PSP awards and/or the number of shares 
underlying unvested PSP awards, on the occurrence of a 
corporate event or other reorganisation. 
In the event of a change of control, the treatment of long-term 
incentives will be determined in accordance with the relevant 
plan rules.
MAXIMUM POTENTIAL VALUE
The maximum annual grant is 175% of base salary.
PERFORMANCE MEASURES
There are two performance measures which apply to PSP awards, as 
follows:
(i) TSR performance over three years relative to FTSE 350 
comparator group (50% of award), vesting as follows: 
 
Below Median = 0% 
 
At Median = 25% 
 
Upper Quartile = 100% 
(ii) Average corporate scorecard (as described in the annual bonus) 
over three ﬁnancial years (50% of award), vesting as follows: 
 
Average Score 0.75 = 0%
 
Average Score 1 = 50%
 
Average Score 1.5 = 100%
While each annual corporate score can range from zero to 2.0, the 
three-year average corporate score is capped at 1.5. For illustration:
Year 1 Score 1.8
Year 2 Score 0.9
Year 3 Score 1.2
Average corporate score = 1.3
Straight line vesting occurs between performance levels for both 
conditions.

PENSION
Pension provision is one of the components to attract, reward and retain the right calibre of executive, to ensure delivery of the leadership 
and management needed to execute the Group’s vision and Business Plan.
PRACTICAL OPERATION
Executive directors are entitled to non-contributory membership 
of the Group’s deﬁned contribution pension plan. The employer’s 
contribution for executive directors is 20% of base salary.
Alternatively, at their option, executive directors may either have 
contributions of the same amounts made to their personal pension 
schemes, cash in lieu of pension (subject to normal statutory 
deductions); or a combination of pension contributions and cash in 
lieu of pension.
MAXIMUM POTENTIAL VALUE
Maximum is 20% of base salary.
PERFORMANCE MEASURES
No performance measures apply.
BENEFITS
Beneﬁts are provided to be market competitive as an integral part of directors’ total remuneration.
PRACTICAL OPERATION
Executive directors receive a car allowance, life assurance (four 
times salary), the opportunity to participate in all-employee share 
plans on the same basis as other employees, annual private health 
assessment and annual private medical cover.
Additional beneﬁts may be provided if the Committee considers 
them appropriate.
Relocation expenses and/or second base expenses are paid, where 
appropriate, in individual cases. Directors’ relocation expenses are 
determined on a case-by-case basis. The policy is designed to 
assist the director to relocate to a home of similar standing.
MAXIMUM POTENTIAL VALUE
Beneﬁts are set at a level appropriate to the individual’s role and 
circumstances.
The maximum opportunity will depend on the type of beneﬁt and cost 
of its provision, which will vary according to the market and individual 
circumstances.
PERFORMANCE MEASURES
No performance measures apply.
SHARE OWNERSHIP GUIDELINE
The Group’s share ownership guidelines align the interests of executives with shareholders.
PRACTICAL OPERATION
The share ownership guideline is that all executive directors should 
retain shares to the value of 200% of base salary, to be 
accumulated over ﬁve years. Until this level is reached, directors 
who receive shares by virtue of any share plan award or who 
receive deferred bonus shares must retain 50% of the shares 
received net (i.e. after income tax and national insurance 
contributions). Only shares that have actually vested count 
towards the threshold.

PERFORMANCE MEASURES AND APPROACH TO SETTING TARGETS
The measures for elements of variable pay are:
 – Corporate Scorecard, consisting of strategic and Business Plan targets set by the Committee each year in conjunction with the Board. 
The Corporate Scorecard aligns incentives of executive directors with achievement of key business goals. 
 – Relative TSR, which aligns executive director remuneration with creation of long-term shareholder value. 
 – The Committee sets targets for the performance measures each year, taking into account market conditions, the Business Plan and other 
circumstances as appropriate. A summary of the Corporate Scorecard targets that apply for the following year are disclosed in the Annual 
Report on Remuneration.
CIRCUMSTANCES IN WHICH MALUS OR CLAWBACK MAY APPLY
Malus and/or clawback may be applied to incentive awards under the following circumstances:
 – Clawback for the annual bonus – the Committee may require a director to repay any amount of annual bonus payment it considers 
appropriate, in circumstances of ﬁnancial misstatement, or misconduct, or if assessment of a performance condition is found to have been 
based on an error, inaccuracy or misleading information, or in other circumstances that the Committee considers to justify the operation of 
the clawback provision. 
 – Malus and clawback for the BMP – if a repayment of bonus is required (see “annual bonus” above) the Committee shall reduce the number 
of shares that may vest under the BMP by an appropriate amount (in respect of an award made pursuant to the annual bonus payment 
subject to the clawback). The Committee may also reduce the number of shares under a BMP award in circumstances of ﬁnancial 
misstatement, or if assessment of a performance condition is found to have been based on an error, inaccuracy or misleading information, 
or in other circumstances that the Committee considers to justify the operation of the clawback provision. 
 – Malus and clawback for the PSP and DSP – the Committee may also reduce the number of shares under a PSP and/or DSP award in 
circumstances of ﬁnancial misstatement, or if assessment of a performance condition is found to have been based on an error, inaccuracy 
or misleading information, or in other circumstances that the Committee considers to justify the operation of the clawback provision.
 
COMMITTEE’S JUDGEMENT AND DISCRETION
In addition to assessing and making judgements on the meeting of performance targets and the appropriate incentives payable, the 
Committee has certain operational discretions it can exercise in relation to executive directors’ remuneration. These include, but are not 
limited to:
 – reviewing the formulaic outcome of the annual bonus and applying discretion to amend the ﬁnal outcome, to ensure that bonus payments 
reflect overall performance or an individual executive’s performance; 
 – deciding whether to apply malus or clawback to an award; and
 – determining whether a leaver is a “good leaver”. 
Where such discretion is exercised, it will be explained in the relevant directors’ remuneration report.

APPROACH TO RECRUITMENT REMUNERATION
The Committee will apply the core principles on page 87 and the components set out in the table on pages 88 to 92 to determine the 
remuneration of newly appointed directors. Base salary will be set at a level appropriate to the role and the experience of the director being 
appointed. Where this is below the market level, it will be adjusted over time to align with the market level, subject to good performance. 
The incentive provision for a new executive director will include annual bonus up to 150% of salary and a PSP award of up to 175% of salary.
In relation to directors appointed from outside the Group, where the Committee considers it to be necessary to secure the appointment of 
the director, the Committee may:
 – pay compensation for loss of beneﬁts on resignation from a previous employer, such as loss of long-term share incentives (subject to the 
right to phase any payment to reflect performance, the requirement to mitigate loss and the Company’s right to claw back any amount 
which is subsequently paid to the executive by the former employer, and to claw back an appropriate proportion of the payment if the 
executive leaves soon after appointment); and 
 – make appropriate payments in circumstances where a director is relocated from outside the UK. 
SERVICE AGREEMENTS AND COMPENSATION ON LOSS OF OFFICE
Executive directors’ service agreements are of indeﬁnite duration, terminable at any time by either party giving 12 months’ notice.
Element
Details
Notice periods
Executive directors may be required to work during the notice period or may be provided with pay in lieu of notice if not required to 
work the full notice period. 
Under each of the executive directors’ service agreements, the Company has the right to make a payment in lieu of notice of 
termination, the amount of that payment being the salary and beneﬁts that would have accrued to the executive director during the 
contractual notice period.
Compensation
for loss of ofﬁce
If an executive director’s employment is brought to an end by either party and if it is necessary to determine a termination payment, 
the Committee’s policy, in the absence of a breach of the service agreement by the director, is to determine a director’s termination 
payment in accordance with his/her service agreement. The termination payment will be calculated based on the value of base salary 
and contractual beneﬁts that would have accrued to the director during the contractual notice period. The Committee will seek 
mitigation to reduce the amount of any termination payment to a leaving director when appropriate to do so, having regard to the 
circumstances and the law governing the agreement. It may, for example, be appropriate to consider mitigation if the director has 
secured another job at a similar level. Mitigation would not apply retrospectively to a contractual payment in lieu of notice. 
In addition, the director may be entitled to a payment in respect of his/her statutory rights. The Group may pay reasonable fees for 
a departing director to obtain independent legal advice in relation to their termination arrangements and nominal consideration 
for agreement to any contractual terms protecting the Company’s rights following termination. No service agreement includes 
any provision for the payment of compensation upon termination. Any compensation payable in those circumstances would need 
to be determined at the time and in the light of the circumstances.
Treatment of annual 
bonus on termination
All bonus payments are discretionary beneﬁts. The Committee will consider whether a departing director should receive an annual 
bonus in respect of the ﬁnancial year in which, and/or immediately preceding which, the termination occurs, pro-rated to reflect 
the period of the performance year completed at the date of termination. The Committee will take into account performance; 
cooperation with succession; any breach of goodwill, and adherence to contractual obligations/restrictions. If the termination is by 
the Company on less than the notice speciﬁed in the director’s service agreement and, if required, in order to adhere to contractual 
obligations, the Committee will also consider whether the director should receive an annual bonus in respect of any period of the 
ﬁnancial year following termination for which the director has been deprived of the opportunity to earn annual bonus. As outlined 
earlier in the report the latest Chief Executive service contract for Will Gardiner as Group CEO, does not allow for the payment of 
bonus after termination. If the employment ends in any of the following circumstances, the director will be treated as a “good leaver” 
and the director will be eligible for a bonus payment:
 – redundancy; 
 – retirement; 
 – ill-health or disability, proved to the satisfaction of the Company; and 
 – death. 
If the termination is for any other reason, a bonus payment will be at the Committee’s discretion and it is the Committee’s policy to 
ensure that any such bonus payment properly reflects the departing director’s performance and behaviour towards the Company. 
Therefore the amount of any such payment will be determined as described in the table on page 92, taking into account (i) the 
director’s personal performance and behaviour towards the Company and (ii) the Group performance. If a bonus payment is made, it 
will normally be paid as soon as is reasonably practicable after the Group performance element has been determined for the relevant 
period. There may be circumstances in which the Committee considers it appropriate for the bonus payment to be made earlier, for 
example, on termination due to ill-health, in which case, on-target Group performance score shall be assumed. 
No payment will be made unless the director is employed on the date of bonus payment, except for “good leavers” as deﬁned above.

Treatment of unvested 
long-term incentive and 
deferred share awards 
on termination
The Committee will consider the extent to which deferred and conditional share awards held by the director under the BMP, DSP 
and PSP should lapse or vest. Any determination by the Committee will be in accordance with the rules of the BMP, DSP and PSP 
(as approved by shareholders).
In summary, the rules of the BMP and PSP provide that awards will vest (pro-rated to the date of employment termination) 
if employment ends for any of the following reasons (“long-term good leaver reasons”):
 – redundancy;
 – retirement;
 – ill-health or disability proved to the satisfaction of the Company;
 – change of ownership; and
 – death.
If employment ends for any other reason, the rules of the BMP and PSP require the Committee to exercise its discretion. In doing so, it 
will take account of all relevant circumstances, in particular, the Company’s performance; the director’s performance and behaviour 
towards the Company during the performance cycle of the relevant awards; and other relevant factors, including the proximity of the 
award to its maturity date.
The rules of the BMP also provide that in circumstances where awards vest, deferred and conditional shares vest as soon as 
reasonably practicable following termination. Awards, which vest subject to satisfaction of the relevant performance conditions, will 
be time pro-rated and will be phased over the performance cycle of the relevant awards.
The rules of the DSP provide that deferred bonus awards will vest (in full) if employment ends for any of the “long-term good leaver 
reasons” detailed above. If employment ends for any other reason, the rules of the DSP require the Committee to exercise its 
discretion. In doing so it will take account of all relevant circumstances, in particular, the Company’s performance; the director’s 
performance and behaviour towards the Company during the performance cycle of the relevant awards; and a range of other relevant 
factors, including the proximity of the award to its maturity date.
The rules of the DSP and PSP also provide that in circumstances where awards vest, they do so at the normal vesting date, unless 
the Committee exercises discretion to vest awards earlier. Awards which vest subject to satisfaction of the relevant performance 
conditions will be (time) pro-rated.
Outside appointments
Executive directors may accept external Board appointments, subject to the Chairman’s approval. Normally only one appointment to 
a listed company would be approved. Fees may be retained by the director.
CONSIDERATION OF CIRCUMSTANCES FOR LEAVERS
The Committee will consider whether the overall value of any beneﬁts accruing to a leaving director is fair and appropriate, taking account of 
all relevant circumstances. Examples of circumstances in which the Committee may be minded to award an annual bonus payment and/or 
permit the vesting of PSP awards include:
 – the director’s continued good performance up to and following the giving of notice; and 
 – the director accommodating the Company in the timing of his/her departure and handover arrangements. 
Conversely, the Committee may be minded not to allow such payments if the reason for the departure is:
 – poor performance; or 
 – the director does not continue to perform effectively following notice.

REMUNERATION OF NON-EXECUTIVE DIRECTORS AND CHAIRMAN
Remuneration component and link to strategy
Practical operation
Maximum potential value
Fees 
To attract a Chairman and independent 
non-executive directors who, together 
with the executive directors, form a 
Board with a broad range of skills and 
experience.
The Chairman’s remuneration is determined by the Committee 
whilst that of the other non-executive directors is determined by the 
Chairman and the executive directors. These are determined in the 
light of:
 – fees of chairmen and non-executive directors of other listed 
companies selected for comparator purposes, on the same basis as 
for executive directors;
 – the responsibilities and time commitment; and
 – the need to attract and retain individuals with the necessary skills 
and experience. 
Non-executive directors’ fees are reviewed periodically against market 
comparators. They were last reviewed in 2017. Current fee levels are 
shown in the annual report on remuneration.
The Chairman receives an annual fee.
Non-executive directors receive an annual base fee.
Additional annual fees are paid:
 – to the Senior Independent Director (which includes the fee for 
chairing a Board Committee other than the Audit Committee);
 – to the Chair of the Audit Committee;
 – to the Chair of the Remuneration Committee; and
 – to the Chair of any other committee (this is not paid to the Chairman 
of the Nomination Committee if he or she is also the Chairman of the 
Board).
Non-executive directors are not entitled to participate in any 
performance related remuneration arrangements.
Overall aggregate fees paid to all non-
executive directors will remain within the 
limit as stated in the Company’s Articles 
(currently £1,000,000).
Expenses
Reasonable travel and accommodation expenses are reimbursed 
as applicable.
Non-executive directors do not receive any beneﬁts in kind, nor are they eligible for any annual performance bonus, pension or any of the 
Group’s share-based reward plans.
The Chairman’s notice period is six months whilst the other non-executive directors have a notice period of one month.

DIFFERENCES BETWEEN THE POLICY AND THAT OF THE REMUNERATION OF EMPLOYEES GENERALLY
The following differences apply between the remuneration of directors and the policy on the remuneration of employees generally:
 – executive directors and a number of senior employees are eligible for PSP awards, although there are differences in terms of levels 
of grant; 
 – annual bonus levels vary across the workforce, but the requirement to defer a portion of annual bonus applies only to executive directors; 
 – employees in the collective bargaining unit have a contractual right to receive an annual bonus subject to Company performance and 
continued employment, whereas directors and all other UK-based employees participate in a discretionary bonus scheme; and 
 – hourly paid employees qualify for overtime payments. 
CONTEXT
Wider employee population
In determining executive remuneration, the Committee also takes into account the level of general pay increases within the Group.
The Committee’s policy is that annual salary increases for executive directors should not exceed the average annual salary increase 
for the wider employee population unless there is a particular reason for a higher increase, such as a change in the nature or scope of 
responsibilities or if an executive director has been appointed at a salary below market level reflecting experience in the role.
The Committee has considered a number of comparison metrics when determining its approach to executive remuneration, including the 
ratio of Group Chief Executive to median employee pay. 
Views taken from the employee population
In the course of discussions on pay with employee representatives, the Group discusses executive remuneration policy and provides details 
of the process by which the Committee establishes executive remuneration packages. The information provided includes details of the 
benchmarking of executive director remuneration, as well as information benchmarking the pay of employees in the collective bargaining 
unit with pay elsewhere in the industry.
Environmental, social and governance issues
The Committee is able to consider corporate performance on environmental, social and governance issues when setting the remuneration 
of executive directors. Speciﬁc measures can be included in the balanced Corporate Scorecard. The Committee is also able to consider 
these issues in determining whether to exercise its discretion to adjust the overall score, and in considering the performance conditions 
override under the PSP, as described on page 92.
Shareholder engagement
The Company holds regular meetings with its largest shareholders, and the Committee takes into account all shareholder views or 
representations relating to executive remuneration. We held discussions with a number of shareholders leading up to and around the time of 
the 2017 AGM and the Committee has considered this feedback. The proposal to remove the personal element from the annual bonus within 
the current policy takes on board that feedback. We wrote to a number of shareholders in late 2017 to explain the proposed changes to the 
remuneration policy for executive directors. The Committee takes shareholder feedback very seriously and will continue to engage.

Notes:
The targets were aligned with the Group’s strategy and 2017 Business Plan and reviewed regularly by the Board as part of their ongoing scrutiny of business and executive performance
ND – Not Disclosed. It is considered that the disclosure of detailed performance against these metrics would be commercially sensitive. It would therefore not be appropriate to disclose 
these figures. To do so may result in unfair competitive disadvantage to the Group and to consumers. All results were reviewed by the Committee prior to values being removed
Drax Group plc Annual report and accounts 2017

Drax Group plc Annual report and accounts 2017

Outlined below is a brief synopsis of the KPIs used and their strategic rationale:
 
Group 
 – Safety is the ﬁrst priority for the business. The Total Recordable Incident Rate (TRIR) is deﬁned as the number of incidents per 100,000 
hours worked. A TRIR of 0.30 represents industry upper quartile safety performance.
 – Financial performance metrics are based on underlying EBITDA, underlying EPS and Net Debt. The weighting at 30% reflects the priority 
given to a strong Group ﬁnancial performance.
 – Pellet quality impacts both Drax Biomass and Drax Power. The Group’s strategic objective is 30% self-supply of high quality pellets, to fuel 
its biomass generation units. The “ﬁnes” metric is used to drive pellet quality, from own supply. 
 – New strategy implementation allows the Board to assess progress against a small number of speciﬁc strategic objectives. The weighting 
demonstrates the Board’s commitment to the further development of the Group. 
Drax Biomass
 – We remain focused on developing strong in-house pellet supply capability, able to provide up to 30% of the biomass fuel required by Drax 
Power. Aside from “ﬁnes” whch are a Group issue, the focus is pellet output, particularly relevant as plants are commissioned and rise up 
their development curve, and pellet production costs, which have a direct impact on gross margins available from generation. 
Drax Power
 – The value available to the Group from biomass-fuelled generation is a key driver of gross margins. Biomass unit technical availability 
reflects the value that can be derived from maximising biomass unit output. 
 – The value from operational flexibility acknowledges the changing nature of the UK’s electricity sector and the value available to 
generators able to fully support the grid. This system support has emerged as a key revenue driver as coal-fuelled generation has declined. 
Haven Power
 – During 2017 our Haven Power retail business has focused on improving proﬁtability and making a positive ﬁnancial contribution to the 
Group. The EBITDA reflects this ambition. 
 – To drive the future performance of the business it will need to engage with customers through suitable digital platforms and the 
implementation of new IT systems forms part of this development. 
Opus Energy
Opus Energy was acquired in February 2017 and, in the year, there has been a strong attention to its successful integration, with emphasis on 
maintaining its growth and proﬁtability. The targets within the three metrics are consistent with the acquisition case. 
Further details of how these individual metrics support the business strategy and drive both shareholder value and performance can be 
found on pages 1–57.
The Committee made an in-depth review of the score for each of the performance measures, to make sure these were individually 
supportable, and then reviewed the overall outcome, to determine whether to exercise its discretion and adjust the ﬁnal score. 
The majority of the measures are quantitative but for reasons of commercial sensitivity some of the targets are not disclosed in the 
Annual report. The Committee aims for maximum transparency so the decision not to disclose a target is closely reviewed. 
PERSONAL PERFORMANCE
The members of the Executive Committee, including the executive directors were assessed both relative to their individual contribution in 
driving 2017 performance, and as a team. Key to the assessment was each individual’s contribution to delivering the Group’s strategy and 
2017 Business Plan plus the promotion of the Drax values. 
Individual and executive team performance were both considered to be strong. This included good cooperation across the team, which was 
key to progressing the strategy and to the successful integration of Opus Energy. 
With respect to the executive directors, areas of particular note included the:
 – Group CEO’s strong and effective leadership of the Group, the work on sustainability and the development, promotion and implementation 
of the new strategy, which included two signiﬁcant acquisitions. She also gave strong support to the new HR strategy; 
 – Group CFO’s success in leading on the acquisition of Opus Energy, which was well integrated, the acquisition of LaSalle Bioenergy, which 
increased our pellet capacity by 50% and is now successfully commissioning, the successful completion of the Group reﬁnancing in May 
and a new dividend policy which was announced in June. He has also been instrumental in the overhaul of IT across the Group; 
 – Chief Executive of Drax Power’s strong leadership of the Drax generating plant, including good interaction with Government leading to the 
support for the fourth biomass unit, the acquisition of four permitted UK sites to develop as gas “peaking plants“ and the development of 
longer-term options for growth through coal-to-gas repowering on the Drax site. 
The Committee determined that the three executive directors had performed strongly and that it was appropriate to give the same personal 
performance score to each. A score of 1.25 out of 1.5 was awarded.

PAYMENTS FOR LOSS OF OFFICE
Dorothy Thompson ceased to be a director on 31 December 2017 and her service agreement terminated on that date. For the purpose of 
outstanding incentive awards under the BMP and PSP, the Committee determined that Dorothy should be treated as a good leaver. Upon 
leaving the Company she received the following payments which were in line with the provisions of her service agreement and the 
Company’s Remuneration Policy which was approved by shareholders at the 2017 Annual General Meeting:
 – In accordance with the relevant provisions of her service agreement, payment in lieu of the residual part of the period of 12 months’ notice 
commencing on 1 January 2018 and terminating on 20 September 2018, in respect of salary, pension payments and contractual beneﬁts 
(the “PILON payment”). In accordance with the terms of the service agreement, the PILON payment will be made in instalments, with an 
initial payment of 50% of the PILON payment paid within 30 days of the termination date, a second instalment of 25% to be paid within six 
months of the termination date and a third instalment of 25% to be paid within nine months of the termination date; 
 – Annual bonus in respect of 2017 was determined in accordance with the Remuneration Policy. It is payable in early 2018 and totals 
£463,300. 35% of this bonus awarded for 2017 will be deferred as an award under the Deferred Share Plan (DSP) and will vest in 
accordance with the rules of the DSP;
 – Annual bonus in respect of the unworked period of notice (1 January 2018 to 20 September 2018) will, in accordance with the service 
agreement and the Remuneration Policy, be determined (and will be payable in early 2019). 35% of any such bonus will be deferred as an 
award under the DSP and will vest in accordance with the rules of the DSP;
 – Deferred bonus awards granted in 2015, 2016 and 2017 will vest in accordance with the leaver provisions of the BMP, pro-rated to the date 
on which employment ceased. A total of 110,667 shares will vest, as soon as practicable, with a sufﬁcient number being sold to meet 
income tax and National Insurance Contributions. The value of these shares based on a share price of £2.706 as at 29 December 2017 is 
£299,465;
 – Pro-rata vesting of performance related BMP and PSP Awards made in 2016 and 2017 to the extent that any such awards vest, subject to 
fulﬁlling performance conditions, in accordance with the rules of the BMP and PSP. These awards will vest at the normal vesting date. The 
PSP awards are subject to a two year post-vesting holding period in accordance with the remuneration policy and the PSP rules . A total of 
216,340 shares including dividend shares were outstanding as at 31 December 2017. An estimated maximum value of these based on the 
closing share price on 29 December 2017 of £2.706 is 585,416; and
 – Long term incentive awards will remain subject to malus and clawback provisions.

STATEMENT OF DIRECTORS’ SHAREHOLDING AND SHARE INTERESTS (AUDITED INFORMATION)
The shareholding guidelines require executive directors who receive shares by virtue of share plan awards, or who receive deferred bonus 
shares, to retain 50% of the shares received net (i.e. after income tax and national insurance contributions) until the value is equal to at least 
200% of salary. Only shares that have actually vested count towards the threshold.
As at 31 December 2017, the shareholding guidelines had not been met, as detailed in the table below, which also shows the executive

returns given that, in recent years, the Company has been a member of the FTSE 350 Index. The graph reflects the TSR (determined 
according to usual market practice) for the Company and the index referred to on a cumulative basis over the period from 31 December 2008

The remuneration policy and the 2016 Directors’ Remuneration Report were approved by the majority of shareholders but there was a 
signiﬁcant minority of shares voted against, particularly against the Remuneration Report. We had consulted on the new policy with the 
major holders of the issued share capital, representing a signiﬁcant majority of the shares. Most of these investors were supportive, but not 
all. Feedback from investors, particularly those who did not support either or both the report and the policy, has been considered by the 
Remuneration Committee. Further discussion will take place with investors as part of an ongoing programme.

ADVISER TO THE COMMITTEE
The adviser to the Committee for the year was PwC. PwC is an independent adviser appointed by the Committee in October 2010, following 
a competitive tender process, to advise on market practice and remuneration of executive and non-executive directors . PwC is a member of 
the Remuneration Consultants Group and a signatory to its Code of Conduct. In addition, the Committee has satisﬁed itself that the advice it 
receives is objective and independent as PwC has conﬁrmed there are no conflicts of interest.
From time to time the Group engages PwC to provide ﬁnancial, taxation and related advice on speciﬁc matters. The Committee will continue 
to monitor such engagements in order to be satisﬁed that they do not affect PwC’s independence as an adviser to the Committee.
PwC was paid £233,000 during 2017 in respect of advice given to the Committee.
The Committee also considers the views of the Group Chief Executive regarding the performance and remuneration of the other executive 
directors and senior staff.
During 2017, the Committee has also been advised by David McCallum, the Group Company Secretary, and Samantha Brook, Head of 
Corporate HR.

RIGHTS AND OBLIGATIONS ATTACHING TO SHARES
There are various rights and obligations attaching to the ordinary shares which are set out in the Articles. A copy of the Articles can 
be accessed on the Company’s website at www.drax.com/about-us/compliance-and-policies.
Attention should be given to the following sections within the Articles, covering the rights and obligations attaching to shares:
Variation of rights – which covers the rights attached to any class of shares that may be varied with the written consent of the holders of not 
less than three-quarters in nominal value of the issued shares of that class, or with the sanction of an extraordinary resolution passed at a 
separate General Meeting of the holders of those shares.
Transfer of shares – provides detail of how transfers of shares in certiﬁed and uncertiﬁed form may be undertaken. It also sets out the 
directors’ rights of refusal to effect a transfer and the action that directors must take following such refusal. It should be noted that a 
shareholder does not need to obtain the approval of the Company, or of other holders of shares in the Company, for a transfer of shares to 
take place.
Voting and deadlines for exercising voting rights – these sections of the Articles deal with voting on a show of hands and on a poll. They also 
cover the appointment of a proxy or corporate representative. In respect of voting deadlines, the Articles provide for the submission of proxy 
forms not less than 48 hours before the time appointed for the holding of the meeting. It has been the Company’s practice since 
incorporation to hold a poll on every resolution at Annual General Meetings and Extraordinary General Meetings.
A trustee holds shares on behalf of employees in respect of the Group’s Share Incentive Plan. The voting rights attached to such shares are 
not directly exercisable by the employees. The employee may direct the trustee on how to vote at a General Meeting and the trustee may 
only cast its vote in respect of shares over which it has received a valid direction from employees.
Changes to the Articles – the Articles may only be changed by shareholders by special resolution.

The Group has two main ﬁnancing agreements: 
 – A £350 million facilities agreement dated 20 December 2012 
(as amended and restated on 10 December 2015 and 21 April 2017

agreement dated 4 May 2017) between, amongst others, Drax 
Corporate Limited and Barclays Bank PLC (as facility agent) 
(the Facilities Agreement). 
 – An indenture dated 5 May 2017 between, amongst others, Drax 
Finco plc and BNY Mellon Corporate Trustee Services Limited

Group plc or if Drax Group plc no longer holds directly or indirectly 
100% of the issued share capital of Drax Group Holdings Limited or 
else if a party other than Drax Group plc becomes the beneﬁcial 
owner of more than 50% of the voting rights of Drax Group plc’s 
direct subsidiary, Drax Group Holdings Limited. Following a change 
of control, if any lender requires, it may by giving notice to the 
relevant Group entity within 30 days of receiving notice from such 
Group entity that a change of control has occurred, cancel its 
commitments and require the repayment of its share of any 
outstanding amounts within three business days of such 
cancellation notice being given.
Under the Indenture, a change of control occurs if a party other than 
Drax Group plc becomes the beneﬁcial owner of more than 50% of 
the voting rights of Drax Group plc’s direct subsidiary, Drax Group 
Holdings Limited, or else if all or substantially all of the assets of Drax 
Group Holdings Limited are disposed outside of the Drax corporate 
group. No later than 60 days after any change of control, Drax Group 
Holdings must offer to purchase any outstanding Fixed Rate Notes 
and Floating Rate Notes at 101% of the principal amount of such

AUDITORS AND THE DISCLOSURE OF INFORMATION  
TO THE AUDITOR
So far as each person serving as a director at the date of approving 
this report is aware, there is no relevant audit information, being 
information needed by the auditor in connection with preparing the 
report, of which the auditor is unaware. Having made enquiries of 
fellow directors, each director has taken all steps that he/she ought 
to have taken as a director to ascertain any relevant audit 
information and to establish that the auditor is aware of that 
information. This information is given and should be interpreted in 
accordance with the provisions of Section 418 of the Companies Act.
Resolutions will be proposed at the AGM for (i) the reappointment of 
Deloitte LLP as the auditor of the Group; and (ii) authorising the 
directors to determine the auditor’s remuneration. As explained, the 
Audit Committee reviews the appointment of the auditor, the 
auditor’s effectiveness and its relationship with the Group, including 
the level of audit and non-audit fees paid to the auditor. Further 
details on the work of the auditor and the Audit Committee are set 
out in the Audit Committee report on pages 76–80.

Drax Group plc Annual report and accounts 2017
111
The directors are responsible for preparing the Annual report and the ﬁnancial statements in accordance with applicable law and 
regulations.
Company law requires the directors to prepare ﬁnancial statements for each ﬁnancial year. Under that law the directors are required to 
prepare the Group ﬁnancial statements in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRSs) as adopted by the European 
Union and Article 4 of the IAS Regulation and have elected to prepare the Parent Company ﬁnancial statements in accordance with United 
Kingdom Generally Accepted Accounting Practice (United Kingdom Accounting Standards and applicable law), set out in FRS 101 “Reduced 
Disclosure Framework”. Under company law the directors must not approve the accounts unless they are satisﬁed that they give a true and 
fair view of the state of affairs of the Company and of the proﬁt or loss of the Company for that period.
In preparing the Parent Company ﬁnancial statements, the directors are required to:
 – select suitable accounting policies and then apply them consistently; 
 – make judgements and accounting estimates that are reasonable and prudent; 
 – state whether applicable UK Accounting Standards have been followed, subject to any material departures disclosed and explained 
in the ﬁnancial statements; and 
 – prepare the ﬁnancial statements on the going concern basis unless it is inappropriate to presume that the Company will continue 
in business. 
In preparing the Group ﬁnancial statements, International Accounting Standard 1 requires that directors:
 – properly select and apply accounting policies; 
 – present information, including accounting policies, in a manner that provides relevant, reliable, comparable and understandable 
information; 
 – provide additional disclosures when compliance with the speciﬁc requirements in IFRSs are insufﬁcient to enable users to understand 
the impact of particular transactions, other events and conditions on the entity’s ﬁnancial position and ﬁnancial performance; and 
 – make an assessment of the Company’s ability to continue as a going concern. 
The directors are responsible for keeping adequate accounting records that are sufﬁcient to show and explain the Company’s transactions 
and disclose with reasonable accuracy at any time the ﬁnancial position of the Company and enable them to ensure that the ﬁnancial 
statements comply with the Companies Act 2006. They are also responsible for safeguarding the assets of the Company and hence for 
taking reasonable steps for the prevention and detection of fraud and other irregularities.
The directors are responsible for the maintenance and integrity of the corporate and ﬁnancial information included on the Company’s 
website. Legislation in the United Kingdom governing the preparation and dissemination of ﬁnancial statements may differ from legislation 
in other jurisdictions.
RESPONSIBILITY STATEMENT
We conﬁrm that to the best of our knowledge:
 – the ﬁnancial statements, prepared in accordance with the relevant ﬁnancial reporting framework, give a true and fair view of the assets, 
liabilities, ﬁnancial position and proﬁt or loss of the Company and the undertakings included in the consolidation taken as a whole; 
 – the Strategic report includes a fair review of the development and performance of the business and the position of the Company and the 
undertakings included in the consolidation taken as a whole, together with a description of the principal risks and uncertainties that they 
face; and 
 – the annual report and ﬁnancial statements, taken as a whole, are fair, balanced and understandable and provide the information necessary 
for shareholders to assess the Company’s performance, business model and strategy.

REPORT ON THE AUDIT OF THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
Opinion
In our opinion:
 – the ﬁnancial statements give a true and fair view of the state of the group’s and of the parent company’s affairs as at 31 December 2017 
and of the group’s loss for the year then ended;
 – the group ﬁnancial statements have been properly prepared in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRSs) as 
adopted by the European Union;
 – the parent company ﬁnancial statements have been properly prepared in accordance with United Kingdom Generally Accepted 
Accounting Practice including Financial Reporting Standard 101 “Reduced Disclosure Framework”; and
 – the ﬁnancial statements have been prepared in accordance with the requirements of the Companies Act 2006 and, as regards the group 
ﬁnancial statements, Article 4 of the IAS Regulation.
We have audited the ﬁnancial statements of Drax Group plc (the "parent company") and its subsidiaries ("the group") which comprise:
 – the consolidated income statement;
 – the consolidated statement of comprehensive income;
 – the consolidated and parent company balance sheets;
 – the consolidated and parent company statements of changes in equity;
 – the consolidated cash flow statement;
 – the basis of preparation and statement of accounting policies;
 – the related group notes 2.1 to 8.3; and
 – the related parent company notes 1 to 9
The ﬁnancial reporting framework that has been applied in the preparation of the group ﬁnancial statements is applicable law and IFRSs as 
adopted by the European Union. The ﬁnancial reporting framework that has been applied in the preparation of the parent company ﬁnancial 
statements is applicable law and United Kingdom Accounting Standards, including FRS 101 “Reduced Disclosure Framework” (United 
Kingdom Generally Accepted Accounting Practice).
BASIS FOR OPINION
We conducted our audit in accordance with International Standards on Auditing (UK) (ISAs (UK)) and applicable law. Our responsibilities 
under those standards are further described in the auditor’s responsibilities for the audit of the ﬁnancial statements section of our report. 
We are independent of the group and the parent company in accordance with the ethical requirements that are relevant to our audit of the 
ﬁnancial statements in the UK, including the FRC’s Ethical Standard as applied to listed public interest entities, and we have fulﬁlled our 
other ethical responsibilities in accordance with these requirements. We conﬁrm that the non-audit services prohibited by the FRC’s Ethical 
Standard were not provided to the group or the parent company.
We believe that the audit evidence we have obtained is sufﬁcient and appropriate to provide a basis for our opinion.
SUMMARY OF OUR AUDIT APPROACH
Key audit matters
The key audit matters that we identiﬁed in the current year were:
 – Asset impairment of Drax Power
 – Valuation of commodity and foreign exchange contracts 
 – Estimation of retail unbilled revenue 
Within this report, any new key audit matters are identiﬁed with 
 and any key audit matters which are the 
same as the prior year identiﬁed with 
Materiality
The materiality that we used for the group ﬁnancial statements was £6.8m (2016: £4.2m). This was 
determined on a blended basis taking into consideration a number of available metrics, with particular focus 
on Earnings before Interest, Taxation, Depreciation and Amortisation (EBITDA) and excluding unrealised gains 
or losses on derivative contracts and material one-off items, as this measure is of direct relevance to readers 
of the ﬁnancial statements. Our selected materiality represents approximately 3% of EBITDA for the year.
Scoping
We focused our group audit scope primarily on the audit work at four locations, being Drax Power, Haven 
Power, Opus Energy and Drax Biomass. All of these were subject to a full scope audit. These four locations 
represent the principal business units and account for virtually all of the group’s net assets, revenue and 
proﬁt before tax.
Signiﬁcant changes 
in our approach
We have completed the audit of Opus Energy for the ﬁrst time, following its acquisition by the Group in 
February 2017. Other aspects of our audit approach remain broadly consistent to the prior year but we have 
continued to reﬁne our key audit matters as detailed below.

CONCLUSIONS RELATING TO GOING CONCERN, PRINCIPAL RISKS AND VIABILITY STATEMENT
Going concern
We have reviewed the directors’ statement on page 119 to the ﬁnancial statements about whether they 
considered it appropriate to adopt the going concern basis of accounting in preparing them and their 
identiﬁcation of any material uncertainties to the group’s and company’s ability to continue to do so over a 
period of at least 12 months from the date of approval of the ﬁnancial statements.
We are required to state whether we have anything material to add or draw attention to in relation to that 
statement required by Listing Rule 9.8.6R(3) and report if the statement is materially inconsistent with our 
knowledge obtained in the audit.
We conﬁrm that we have 
nothing material to report, add 
or draw attention to in respect 
of these matters.
Principal risks and viability statement
Based solely on reading the directors’ statements and considering whether they were consistent with the 
knowledge we obtained in the course of the audit, including the knowledge obtained in the evaluation of 
the directors’ assessment of the group’s and the company’s ability to continue as a going concern, we are 
required to state whether we have anything material to add or draw attention to in relation to:
 – the disclosures on pages 51–57 that describe the principal risks and explain how they are being 
managed or mitigated;
 – the directors' conﬁrmation on page 111 that they have carried out a robust assessment of the principal 
risks facing the group, including those that would threaten its business model, future performance, 
solvency or liquidity; or
 – the directors’ explanation on page 50 as to how they have assessed the prospects of the group, over 
what period they have done so and why they consider that period to be appropriate, and their statement 
as to whether they have a reasonable expectation that the group will be able to continue in operation 
and meet its liabilities as they fall due over the period of their assessment, including any related 
disclosures drawing attention to any necessary qualiﬁcations or assumptions.
We are also required to report whether the directors’ statement relating to the prospects of the group 
required by Listing Rule 9.8.6R(3) is materially inconsistent with our knowledge obtained in the audit.
We conﬁrm that we have 
nothing material to report, add 
or draw attention to in respect 
of these matters.
KEY AUDIT MATTERS
Key audit matters are those matters that, in our professional judgement, were of most signiﬁcance in our audit of the ﬁnancial statements for 
the current period and include the most signiﬁcant assessed risks of material misstatement (whether or not due to fraud) that we identiﬁed. 
These matters included those which had the greatest effect on: the overall audit strategy, the allocation of resources in the audit; and 
directing the efforts of the engagement team.
These matters were addressed in the context of our audit of the ﬁnancial statements as a whole, and in forming our opinion thereon, and we 
do not provide a separate opinion on these matters.
We previously identiﬁed onsite biomass stocks as a key audit matter reflecting the judgement inherent in calculating the volume of biomass 
stocks owned by the Group. Following the reduction in biomass stock as a result of an onsite ﬁre during December 2017, we no longer 
consider this to be a key audit matter.
The appropriateness of asset useful economic life assumptions is no longer considered to be a key audit matter following the reduction in 
the accounting lives of the coal speciﬁc assets from 1 January 2017.
The valuation and recoverability of Renewable Obligation Certiﬁcates (ROCs) is no longer considered to be a key audit matter. The ROC 
valuation process has historically been free from material error and it is well established.

INDEPENDENT AUDITOR’S REPORT TO THE MEMBERS OF DRAX GROUP PLC CONTINUED
ASSET IMPAIRMENT OF DRAX POWER 
Key audit matter description
Property, plant and equipment of £1.7bn (2016: £1.6bn) is held on the balance sheet at the year end, the 
majority of which relates to the power generation plant. Net assets at the year end were £1.7bn (2016: £2bn) 
and the market capitalisation was £1.1bn (2016:£1.5bn).
Management considered indicators of impairment in respect of each Cash Generating Unit (CGU). Despite 
improvements in achieved spreads within key commodity markets and a period of relative stability with 
respect to relevant government policy, the market capitalisation of the Group continues to be below the 
net asset value. This is considered to be an indicator of the risk of impairment and accordingly management 
performed an impairment review for the Drax Power CGU in the current year, as this is the CGU which 
contains the majority of the Group’s assets.
As noted in the Group’s critical accounting judgements, estimates and assumptions in note 2.4 and the Audit 
Committee report on page 76, asset impairment has been considered a key risk by the Audit Committee. Fixed 
assets are disclosed in note 3.1.
The impairment testing is subject to the application of management judgement in identifying relevant 
CGUs and various assumptions underlying the calculation of the value in use for each CGU identiﬁed. These 
assumptions include the achievability of the long-term business plan. Management’s assessment also 
considers changes in the business which may give rise to additional CGUs, for example the acquisition of 
Opus Energy in February 2017. 
Due to the level of management judgement involved in assessing impairment, we have identiﬁed this as a 
fraud risk.
The signiﬁcant judgements made by management have been disclosed in note 2.4 and include:
 – The expected operating lives of the six generating units;
 – Future commodity prices beyond the horizon of existing contracted purchases, particular long-term power 
prices at both baseload and peak times, and future biomass prices, particularly given that biomass is not a 
standardised commodity traded openly on exchanges;
 – The continuance of existing biomass support regimes until 2027 and the existence of a favourable 
economic environment for biomass generation thereafter; and
 – The discount rate applied to forecast future cashflows.
How the scope of our audit 
responded to the key audit 
matter
We evaluated the design and implementation of key controls related to asset impairment testing.
We have challenged management’s identiﬁcation of CGUs, taking into consideration the independence of 
cash flows across key components of the business and across the power generating units.
We identiﬁed the key judgements made by management and utilised our internal valuation specialists to 
benchmark key market related assumptions including future commodity prices, current and future capacity 
and other support mechanisms and discount rates against external data where available. For example, we 
have compared the commodity price assumptions to the latest available Department for Business, Energy 
and Industrial Strategy (DBEIS) and National Grid forecasts.
We have considered the liquidity of the biomass market and the impact that Drax could have on that market 
as a result of the volumes of biomass it requires and its potential impact on price.
We have also challenged the underlying assumptions and signiﬁcant judgements used in management’s 
impairment model by:
 – Running a range of sensitivities to assess whether an impairment would be required if a range of more 
conservative assumptions were adopted;
 – Assessing the historical accuracy of management’s budgets and forecasts by comparing them to actual 
performance;
 – Verifying the mathematical accuracy of the cash flow models; and 
 – Assessing whether the disclosures in note 2.4 of the ﬁnancial statements appropriately disclose the key 
judgements taken so that the reader of the accounts is aware of the impact in the ﬁnancial statements of 
changes to key assumptions that may lead to impairment.
Drax Group plc Annual report and accounts 2017

ASSET IMPAIRMENT OF DRAX POWER CONTINUED
Key observations
We are satisﬁed that the discount rate is determined based on acceptable valuation methodologies. While it 
is lower than the ranges determined by our internal valuation specialists, increasing the discount rate to be 
within our range would not lead to an impairment.
Although we note that assumptions relating to long term revenues and costs are inherently difﬁcult 
to assess, we believe that the assumptions used by management were reasonable, and based on the 
sensitivities that we performed on these assumptions, we are satisﬁed that no impairment is required. 
VALUATION OF COMMODITY AND FOREIGN EXCHANGE CONTRACTS 
Key audit matter description
Unrealised losses on derivative contracts recognised in the income statement in the year are £156m (2016: 
unrealised gains of £177m), with related derivative assets of £366m and liabilities of £204m recognised on the 
balance sheet as at 31 December 2017.
The valuation of derivative contracts is complex and requires judgement in areas including the selection 
of appropriate valuation methodologies, and assumptions in respect of future market prices and credit risk 
factors.
Due to the large amount of data involved in the contract valuations, and the requirement for certain manual 
adjustments, we have identiﬁed a fraud risk relating to management or employees of the company valuing 
trades inappropriately.
Further detail of the key judgements are disclosed in the Group’s critical accounting judgements, estimates 
and assumptions set out on pages 119 and 120 and the Audit Committee report on pages 76 to 80. Section 7 
sets out the ﬁnancial risk management notes.
How the scope of our audit 
responded to the key audit 
matter
We evaluated the design and implementation and tested the operating effectiveness of key controls related 
to the valuation of commodity and foreign exchange contracts.
We used our internal ﬁnancial instrument specialists to test management’s key judgements and calculations, 
including testing a sample of trades undertaken to trade tickets, conﬁrming key contractual terms such as 
volumes and contracted prices.
We have assessed the valuation models used by management, including any manual adjustments to 
determine the fair value of the derivative instruments and performed independent valuations across a 
sample of both commodity and foreign exchange contracts.
We have analysed the appropriateness of management’s forward price curve assumptions by benchmarking 
these to third party sources and reviewed the consistency of the assumptions used across other areas of the 
ﬁnancial statements, such as asset impairment.
We have challenged management’s approach and assumptions involved in assessing fair value adjustments 
such as credit risk, time value of money and spread adjustments.
Key observations
From our testing, we are satisﬁed that the valuation of commodity and foreign exchange contracts is 
appropriate. We consider the valuation models used by management to be appropriate and the forward curve 
assumptions adopted are within an acceptable range.

ESTIMATION OF RETAIL UNBILLED REVENUE 
Key audit matter description
The recognition of retail revenue requires an estimation of customer usage between the date of the last 
meter reading and year end, which is known as unbilled revenue. 
Across the retail division, unbilled revenue at the balance sheet date amounted to £195 million 
(2016: £119 million). 
The method of estimating unbilled revenues is complex and judgemental and requires assumptions for both 
the volumes of energy consumed by customers and the related value.
We identiﬁed a fraud risk in relation to revenue recognition in the retail business, in particular to the estimates 
underpinning unbilled revenue as these judgement areas could be manipulated by management to mis-report 
revenue. 
Further detail of the key judgements are disclosed in the Group’s critical accounting judgements, estimates 
and assumptions set out on pages 119 and 120 and the Audit Committee report on pages 76 to 80. Accrued 
income is disclosed in note 3.5.
How the scope of our audit 
responded to the key audit 
matter
We evaluated the design and implementation and tested the operating effectiveness of key controls related 
to the estimation of unbilled revenue. This included controls over the reconciliation of meter readings 
provided by the energy markets, and which are used by management to estimate the power supplied. We also 
tested the controls over the price per unit applied in the valuation of unbilled revenue.
When external market information was not available at the balance sheet date we also obtained and 
considered management’s reconciliation of the volume of power purchased to their calculations of 
revenue supplied and completed sample tests to check that the December unbilled revenue amount was 
subsequently billed.
We also reviewed the aggregate unbilled revenue balance from previous periods to test that the amounts 
recognised were subsequently billed in line with the values accrued. 
Key observations
 Our retrospective reviews of estimated revenues found that management have historically achieved a high 
level of accuracy. We considered the estimates for revenue made in the year to be appropriate.
OUR APPLICATION OF MATERIALITY
We deﬁne materiality as the magnitude of misstatement in the ﬁnancial statements that makes it probable that the economic decisions of a 
reasonably knowledgeable person would be changed or influenced. We use materiality both in planning the scope of our audit work and in 
evaluating the results of our work.
Based on our professional judgement, we determined materiality for the ﬁnancial statements as a whole as follows:
Group ﬁnancial statements
Parent company ﬁnancial statements
Materiality
£6.8m (2016: £4.2m)
£4.1m (2016: £3.8m)
Basis for determining 
materiality
We have determined materiality by considering 
a range of possible benchmarks and the ﬁgures 
derived from those, with a particular focus on 
selecting a materiality within the range that we 
considered appropriate. This included EBITDA 
(excluding unrealised gains or losses on derivative 
contracts and material one-off items), proﬁt before 
and after interest and tax as well as the scale of the 
balance sheet and the overall size of the business. 
The increase in materiality from prior year is 
primarily due to the acquisition of Opus Energy.
Our selected materiality represents approximately 
3% of EBITDA for the year.
We have capped materiality at 60% of the materiality 
identiﬁed for the Group. This is a judgement and 
reflects the signiﬁcant value of investments held on 
the balance sheet at the year end (£713m).
Rationale for the  
benchmark applied
When determining materiality, we have considered 
the size and scale of the business and the nature 
of its operations. We have also considered which 
benchmarks would be of relevance to the users of 
the ﬁnancial statements. 
When determining materiality, we considered the net 
assets of the company as its principal activity is as an 
investment holding company for the Group.
INDEPENDENT AUDITOR’S REPORT TO THE MEMBERS OF DRAX GROUP PLC CONTINUED
Drax Group plc Annual report and accounts 2017

We agreed with the Audit Committee that we would report to the Committee all audit differences in excess of £0.3m (2016: £0.2m) for the 
parent company and group, as well as differences below that threshold that, in our view, warranted reporting on qualitative grounds. We also 
report to the Audit Committee on disclosure matters that we identiﬁed when assessing the overall presentation of the ﬁnancial statements.
AN OVERVIEW OF THE SCOPE OF OUR AUDIT
Our group audit was scoped by obtaining an understanding of the group and its environment, including group-wide controls, and assessing 
the risks of material misstatement at the group level. Based on that assessment, we focused our group audit scope primarily on the audit 
work at four locations (2016: three locations which excludes Opus Energy which was acquired in February 2017), being Drax Power, Haven 
Power, Opus Energy and Drax Biomass. All of these locations were subject to a full scope audit and they represent the principal business 
units and account for virtually all of the group’s net assets, revenue and proﬁt before tax, in line with 2016. They were also selected to provide 
an appropriate basis for undertaking audit work to address the risks of material misstatement identiﬁed above. Our audit work at four 
locations was executed at levels of materiality applicable to each individual entity which were lower than group materiality and ranged from 
£3.5 million to £5.2 million (2015: £2.1 million to £3.8 million).
At the parent company level we also tested the consolidation process and carried out analytical procedures to conﬁrm our conclusion that 
there were no signiﬁcant risks of material misstatement of the aggregated ﬁnancial information of the remaining components not subject to 
audit or audit of speciﬁed account balances.
During 2017 the Senior Statutory Auditor visited two of the four key locations being Drax Power and Drax Biomass, and other senior team 
members visited the remaining two. 
OTHER INFORMATION
Our opinion on the ﬁnancial statements does not cover the other information and, except to the extent 
otherwise explicitly stated in our report, we do not express any form of assurance conclusion thereon.
In connection with our audit of the ﬁnancial statements, our responsibility is to read the other information 
and, in doing so, consider whether the other information is materially inconsistent with the ﬁnancial 
statements or our knowledge obtained in the audit or otherwise appears to be materially misstated.
If we identify such material inconsistencies or apparent material misstatements, we are required 
to determine whether there is a material misstatement in the ﬁnancial statements or a material 
misstatement of the other information. If, based on the work we have performed, we conclude that there 
is a material misstatement of this other information, we are required to report that fact.
In this context, matters that we are speciﬁcally required to report to you as uncorrected material 
misstatements of the other information include where we conclude that:
 – Fair, balanced and understandable – the statement given by the directors that they consider the annual 
report and ﬁnancial statements taken as a whole is fair, balanced and understandable and provides the 
information necessary for shareholders to assess the group’s position and performance, business model 
and strategy, is materially inconsistent with our knowledge obtained in the audit; or
 – Audit committee reporting – the section describing the work of the audit committee does not 
appropriately address matters communicated by us to the audit committee; or
 – Directors’ statement of compliance with the UK Corporate Governance Code – the parts of the 
directors’ statement required under the Listing Rules relating to the company’s compliance with the UK 
Corporate Governance Code containing provisions speciﬁed for review by the auditor in accordance 
with Listing Rule 9.8.10R(2) do not properly disclose a departure from a relevant provision of the UK 
Corporate Governance Code.
We have nothing to report in 
respect of these matters
RESPONSIBILITIES OF DIRECTORS
As explained more fully in the directors’ responsibilities statement, the directors are responsible for the preparation of the ﬁnancial 
statements and for being satisﬁed that they give a true and fair view, and for such internal control as the directors determine is necessary to 
enable the preparation of ﬁnancial statements that are free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error.
In preparing the ﬁnancial statements, the directors are responsible for assessing the group’s and the parent company’s ability to continue as 
a going concern, disclosing as applicable, matters related to going concern and using the going concern basis of accounting unless the 
directors either intend to liquidate the group or the parent company or to cease operations, or have no realistic alternative but to do so.
AUDITOR’S RESPONSIBILITIES FOR THE AUDIT OF THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
Our objectives are to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the ﬁnancial statements as a whole are free from material misstatement, 
whether due to fraud or error, and to issue an auditor’s report that includes our opinion. Reasonable assurance is a high level of assurance, 
but is not a guarantee that an audit conducted in accordance with ISAs (UK) will always detect a material misstatement when it exists. 
Misstatements can arise from fraud or error and are considered material if, individually or in the aggregate, they could reasonably be 
expected to influence the economic decisions of users taken on the basis of these ﬁnancial statements.
A further description of our responsibilities for the audit of the ﬁnancial statements is located on the Financial Reporting Council’s website 
at: www.frc.org.uk/auditorsresponsibilities. This description forms part of our auditor’s report.

INTRODUCTION 
The consolidated ﬁnancial statements provide detailed information 
about the ﬁnancial performance (Consolidated income statement), 
ﬁnancial position (Consolidated balance sheet), and cash flows 
(Consolidated cash flow statement) of Drax Group plc (the Company) 
together with all of the entities controlled by the Company 
(collectively, the Group). 
The notes to the ﬁnancial statements provide additional information 
on the items in the Consolidated income statement, Consolidated 
balance sheet and Consolidated cash flow statement. The notes 
include explanations of the information presented. In general, the 
additional information in the notes to the ﬁnancial statements is 
required by law, International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS) 
or other regulations to facilitate increased understanding of the 
primary statements set out on pages 122–126.
 
BASIS OF PREPARATION 
The ﬁnancial statements have been prepared in accordance 
with IFRS as adopted by the European Union and therefore the 
consolidated ﬁnancial statements comply with Article 4 of the 
EU IAS Regulation and the Companies Act 2006. 
The ﬁnancial statements have been prepared on the historical cost 
basis, except for certain ﬁnancial assets and liabilities (principally 
derivative ﬁnancial instruments) that have been measured at fair 
value. 
Foreign currency transactions
Transactions in foreign currencies are translated into Sterling at the 
exchange rate ruling at the date of the transaction. At each balance 
sheet date, monetary assets and liabilities that are denominated in 
foreign currencies are retranslated at the rates prevailing at that 
date. Non-monetary items are not retranslated.
Foreign exchange gains and losses arising on such revaluations are 
recognised in the income statement within ﬁnance costs.
Foreign operations
The assets and liabilities of foreign operations with a functional 
currency other than Sterling are translated into Sterling using 
published exchange rates at the reporting date. The income and 
expenditure of such operations are translated into Sterling using the 
exchange rate prevailing at the date of the transaction. Foreign 
exchange gains and losses resulting from the retranslation of the 
operation’s net assets and its results for the year are recognised in 
the Consolidated statement of comprehensive income.
Going concern 
The Group’s business activities, along with future developments 
that may affect its ﬁnancial performance, position and cash flows, 
are discussed within the Strategic report on pages 1–57 of this 
Annual Report.
 
In the viability statement on page 50 the directors state that they 
have a reasonable expectation that the Group will be able to 
continue in operation and meet its liabilities as they fall due over the 
next three years. 
Consequently, the directors also have a reasonable expectation that 
the Group will continue in existence for the next 12 months and, 
therefore, have adopted the going concern basis in preparing these 
ﬁnancial statements. 
FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
Basis of consolidation 
These consolidated ﬁnancial statements incorporate the ﬁnancial 
results of the Company and of all entities controlled by the Company, 
(its subsidiaries) made up to 31 December each year. The Company 
owns 100% of the equity of all subsidiaries. 
The Group acquired and gained control of Opus Energy on 
10 February 2017 (see note 5.1). Opus Energy's ﬁnancial results from 
this date are included in the Group's Consolidated income statement.
The Group sold its holding in Billington Bioenergy on 31 October 2017. 
Billington Bioenergy's ﬁnancial results, until this date, are included 
within the Consolidated income statement.
ACCOUNTING POLICIES 
The signiﬁcant accounting policies for the measurement of an 
individual item in the ﬁnancial statements are described in the note 
to the ﬁnancial statements relating to the item concerned (see 
contents on page 121).
No changes have been made to accounting policies in the year. 
A full listing of new standards, interpretations and pronouncements 
under IFRS applicable to these ﬁnancial statements is presented in 
note 8.2. The application of these new requirements has not had a 
material effect on the ﬁnancial statements. Note 8.2 also includes 
the anticipated impact of IFRS 9, 15 and 16 which will affect the 
ﬁnancial statements in future periods.
JUDGEMENTS AND ESTIMATES 
The preparation of ﬁnancial statements requires judgement to be 
applied in forming the Group’s accounting policies. It also requires 
the use of estimates and assumptions that affect the reported 
amounts of assets, liabilities, income and expenses. Actual results 
may differ from these estimates. 
Estimates and underlying assumptions are reviewed on an ongoing 
basis, with revisions recognised in the period in which the estimates 
are revised and in any future periods affected. 
The judgements involving a higher degree of estimation or 
complexity are set out below and in more detail, including sensitivity 
analysis where appropriate, in the related notes. 
Critical accounting judgements 
The following are the critical judgements, apart from those involving 
estimation (which are dealt with separately below), made in the 
process of applying the Group's accounting policies during the year 
that have the most signiﬁcant effect on the amounts recognised in 
the ﬁnancial statements:
 
Accounting treatment applied to acquisition of LaSalle pellet 
production assets – the Group acquired the assets at the LaSalle 
pellet production plant on 13 April 2017. Having assessed the 
circumstances, notably that the plant was acquired without 
employees, input or output contracts and required signiﬁcant 
investment prior to commissioning, it was concluded that the 
transaction represented an asset purchase and not the acquisition 
of a business. Accordingly, the assets have been recognised as 
additions to property, plant and equipment in the year.

Sources of estimation uncertainty
The following are the sources of estimation uncertainty that carry 
the most signiﬁcant risk of a material effect on next year's accounts 
– that is, the items where actual outcomes in the next 12 months 
could vary signiﬁcantly from the estimates made in determining the 
reported amount of an asset or liability.
Property, plant and equipment – property, plant and equipment is 
depreciated on a straight-line basis over its useful economic life. 
Useful economic lives are estimated and based on past experience, 
future replacement cycles and other available evidence. Useful 
economic lives are reviewed annually. We reduced the useful lives of 
coal-speciﬁc generation assets in our Power Generation business 
from 1 January 2017.
  See note 3.1 on page 138 
Intangible assets – intangible assets acquired through the purchase 
of Opus Energy have been recognised at their fair value. The fair 
value measurement of the existing customer contracts depends on a 
number of assumptions, and in particular requires estimates to be 
made about likely margins on current customer contracts, future 
contract renewal rates and future margins on renewed contracts. 
The assets are amortised over their useful economic lives, which in 
the case of the customer-related assets, have also been assessed 
based on the future contract renewal rates. The amortisation rate 
will change if the assumed renewal rates differ from actual 
experience.
  See note 5.3 on page 150
Impairment – an impairment review is conducted annually of 
goodwill and of other assets and cash-generating units where an 
indicator of possible impairment exists. In 2017, an impairment 
assessment has been completed for three of the Group's CGUs. The 
assessment of future cash flows that underpins such a review is 
based on management’s best estimate of future commodity prices, 
supply volumes and economic conditions. The calculations are 
particularly sensitive to changes in the assumptions applied given 
the long time period covered by the assessment.
  See note 2.4 on page 131 and note 5.2 on page 149
Derivatives – derivative ﬁnancial instruments are recorded in the 
Group's balance sheet at fair value. The assessment of fair value is 
derived from assuming a market price for the instrument in question. 
The Group bases its assessment of market prices upon forward 
curves that are largely derived from readily obtainable quotations 
and third party sources. However, any forward curve is based at least 
in part upon assumptions about future transactions and market 
movements. Where such instruments extend beyond the liquid 
portion of the forward curve, the level of estimation increases as the 
number of observable transactions decreases.
  See note 7.2 on page 164
Revenue recognition – the nature of some of the Group’s activities, 
particularly within the B2B Energy Supply segment, results in 
revenue being based on the estimated volumes of power supplied to 
customers at an estimated average price per unit. Assumptions that 
underpin these estimates are applied consistently and comparison 
of past estimates to ﬁnal settlements suggests a high degree of 
accuracy. However, actual outcomes may vary from initial estimates.
  See note 2.2 on page 129 
Renewable Obligation Certiﬁcates (ROCs) – ROC assets generated 
by the Group's Power Generation business and held in the Group’s 
balance sheet are stated at the lower of their deemed cost at the 
point of generation and expected realisable value. The calculation of 
this value depends upon estimates of likely future sales prices.
  See note 3.3 on page 140
Pensions – the Group records a liability in its balance sheet for its 
obligation to provide beneﬁts under an approved deﬁned beneﬁt 
pension scheme, less the fair value of assets held by the pension 
scheme. The actuarial valuation of the scheme assets and liabilities 
is performed annually and depends on assumptions regarding 
interest rates, inflation, future salary and pension increases, 
mortality and other factors, any of which are subject to future 
change.
  See note 6.3 on page 156
Taxation – in accounting for both current and deferred tax the Group 
makes assumptions regarding the likely treatment of items of 
income and expenditure for tax purposes. These assumptions are 
based on interpretation of relevant legislation and, where required, 
consultation with external advisers.
  See note 2.6 on page 134
ALTERNATIVE PERFORMANCE MEASURES (APMs)
We present two APMs (measures without formal deﬁnition in IFRS) 
on the face of our income statement, EBITDA and underlying 
earnings, to assist users of the accounts in evaluating the 
comparability of the Group’s ﬁnancial performance and the 
performance against strategic objectives. 
EBITDA is deﬁned as earnings before interest, tax, depreciation, 
amortisation and material one-off items that do not reflect the 
underlying trading performance of the business. Interest, tax, 
depreciation and amortisation are calculated in accordance 
with IFRS. 
EBITDA is the primary measure used by the Board and market 
analysts to assess our ﬁnancial performance. 
The purpose of EBITDA is to provide a consistent, comparable 
measure of the trading performance of the Group’s businesses 
year on year.
Underlying earnings is deﬁned as proﬁt after tax, as calculated in 
accordance with IFRS, adjusted to exclude unrealised gains and 
losses on derivative contracts, which introduce volatility to IFRS 
measures of net proﬁtability, and material one-off items that do not 
reflect the underlying performance of the business. 
The purpose of underlying earnings is to provide a consistent, 
comparable measure of the overall ﬁnancial performance of the 
Group’s businesses year-on-year, including costs of servicing the 
existing debt, allocations of the cost of non-current assets and tax. 
Judgement is applied in determining transactions which are not 
considered to reflect the underlying trading performance of the 
business.
EBITDA is reconciled to both gross proﬁt and operating proﬁt on 
the face of the income statement. A reconciliation of underlying 
earnings to proﬁt after tax attributable to shareholders is provided 
in note 2.7.

disposed of in the transaction was negligible. There were no other non-cash transactions in either the current or previous year.
SECTION 1: CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
Drax Group plc Annual report and accounts 2017

SECTION 2
Financial performance
The ﬁnancial performance section gives further information about the items in the Consolidated income statement. It includes a summary of 
ﬁnancial performance by each of our businesses (2.1), analysis of certain income statement items (2.2–2.6) and information regarding 
underlying earnings, distributable proﬁts and dividends (2.7–2.10). Further commentary on our trading and operational performance during 
the year, which is predominantly reflected in EBITDA, can be found in the Strategic report on pages 1–57, with particular reference to key 
transactions and market conditions that have affected our results.
2.1 SEGMENTAL REPORTING
The Group is organised into three businesses, with a dedicated management team for each and a central corporate ofﬁce providing certain 
specialist and shared functions. Our businesses are:
 –  Power Generation: power generation activities in the UK, including at Drax Power Station and the development of OCGT projects; 
 –  Pellet Production: production of sustainable compressed wood pellets at our processing facilities in the US; and
 –  B2B Energy Supply: the supply of electricity and gas to business customers in the UK. 
The operating segments have been renamed to align more closely with the strategy, but are consistent with the prior year, except for 
changes due to business combinations as noted below. Each business is an operating segment for the purpose of segmental reporting. 
Information reported to the Board for the purposes of assessing performance and making investment decisions is based on these three 
operating segments. The measure of proﬁt or loss for each reportable segment presented to the Board on a regular basis is EBITDA (as 
deﬁned on page 120).
Operating costs are allocated to segments to the extent they are directly attributable to the activities of that segment. Corporate ofﬁce 
costs are included within central costs.
During the year, the Group acquired 100% of the share capital of Opus Energy Group Limited (see note 5.1), an energy supply business 
providing electricity and gas to business customers. Opus Energy’s activities are closely-related to those of the existing B2B Energy Supply 
business and the B2B Energy Supply management structure has been reorganised to integrate Opus Energy into the existing structure. 
Financial results are reported to the Board for the larger combined business. Accordingly, this new acquisition forms part of the B2B Energy 
Supply segment in the year ended 31 December 2017. Note 5.1 details the additional revenue and proﬁt attributable to the Group from the 
new acquisition. 
As noted on page 16, the Group sold its interest in Billington Bioenergy in the year. The B2B Energy Supply segment includes £6.3 million of 
revenue and £0.2 million EBITDA losses in respect of this business for the 10-month period to the date of disposal.

The accounting policies applied for the purpose of measuring the segments’ proﬁts or losses, assets and liabilities are the same as those 
used in measuring the corresponding amounts in the Group’s ﬁnancial statements. The external revenues and results of all the reporting 
segments are subject to seasonality, with higher dispatch and prices in the winter months compared to summer months.

Total cash outflows in relation to capital expenditure during the year were £175.2 million (2016: £93.2 million). The increase in capital 
expenditure compared to the previous year principally reflects the acquisition of the LaSalle pellet plant and subsequent investment to bring 
the site into operation in the Pellet Production segment, and investment in ofﬁce space for Opus Energy in the B2B Energy Supply segment.
Intra-group trading
Intra-group transactions are carried out on arm’s-length, commercial terms that, where possible, equate to market prices at the time of 
the transaction. During 2017, the Pellet Production segment sold wood pellets with a total value of £135.7 million (2016: £72.9 million) to 
the Power Generation segment and the Power Generation segment sold electricity, gas and ROCs with a total value of £1,033.4 million 
(2016: £868.2 million) to the B2B Energy Supply segment.
The impact of all intra-group transactions, including any unrealised proﬁt arising (£9.8 million at 31 December 2017), is eliminated on 
consolidation. Following the increase in output from Pellet Production during the year and reduced generation in Power Generation 
at the end of the year, intra-group stocks were higher at the end of 2017 than previously, resulting in an increase in this provision.
Major customers
Total revenue for the year ended 31 December 2017 does not include any amounts from individual customers (2016: amounts of £541.5 
million and £399.3 million derived from two customers) that represent 10% or more of total revenue for the year. The Group's largest two 
customers contributed 9% and 8% of total consolidated revenue respectively. These revenues arose in the Power Generation segment.
Drax Group plc Annual report and accounts 2017

2.2 REVENUE
Accounting policy
Revenue represents amounts receivable for goods or services provided in the normal course of business, net of trade discounts, VAT and 
other sales-related taxes and excluding transactions between Group companies.
Revenues from the sale of electricity from our Power Generation business are measured based upon metered output delivered at rates 
speciﬁed under contract terms or prevailing market rates as applicable.
Two of our biomass-fuelled generating units earn Renewable Obligation Certiﬁcates (ROCs) under the UK Government’s Renewables 
Obligation (RO) regime. The ﬁnancial beneﬁt of a ROC is recognised in the income statement at the point the relevant renewable biomass 
fuel is burnt and power dispatched as a reduction in the cost of the biomass fuel. A corresponding asset is recognised on the balance sheet 
(see note 3.3 on page 140). Revenue from sale of ROCs is recognised when the ROC is transferred to a third party.
The Group recognises the income or costs arising from the CfD (see below) in the income statement, as a component of revenue, at the point 
the flow of economic beneﬁt becomes probable. This is considered to be the point at which the relevant generation is delivered and the 
payment becomes contractually due.
Revenue from the sale of electricity and gas directly to business customers through our B2B Energy Supply businesses, Haven Power and 
Opus Energy, is recognised on the supply of electricity or gas when a contract exists, supply has taken place, a quantiﬁable price has been 
established or can be determined and the receivables are expected to be recovered at the point of sale. Energy supplied is measured based 
upon metered consumption and contractual rates; however, where a supply has taken place but is not yet measured or billed, the revenue is 
estimated based on consumption statistics and selling price estimates and is included as accrued income on the balance sheet.
Other revenues derived from the provision of services (for example, the supply of system support services, such as black start and frequency 
response) to National Grid are recognised by reference to the stage of completion of the contract. Most such contracts are for the delivery of 
a service either continually or on an ad-hoc basis over a period of time and thus stage of completion is calculated with reference to the 
amount of the contract term that has elapsed. Depending on the contract terms this approach may require judgement in estimating 
probable future outcomes.
Other revenues derived from the sale of goods (for example, by-products from electricity generation such as ash and gypsum) are recognised 
at the point the risks and rewards of ownership pass to the customer, typically at the point of delivery to the customer’s premises.
CfD payments
The Group is party to a Contract for Difference (CfD) with the Low Carbon Contracts Company (LCCC), a Government-owned entity 
responsible for delivering elements of the Government’s Electricity Market Reform Programme. Under the contract, the Group makes or 
receives payments in respect of electricity dispatched from a speciﬁc biomass-fuelled generating unit. The payment is calculated with 
reference to a strike price of £100 per MWh. The base year for the strike price was 2012 and it increases each year in line with the UK 
Consumer Price Index and changes in system balancing costs. The strike price at 31 December 2017 was £106 per MWh.
When market prices at the point of generation are above/below the strike price, the Group makes/receives an additional payment to/from 
LCCC equivalent to the difference between the market power price at the point of dispatch and the strike price. Such payments are in 
addition to amounts received from the sale of the power in the wholesale market and either increase or limit the total income from the power 
dispatched from the relevant generating unit to the strike price in the CfD contract.
The year ended 31 December 2017 is the ﬁrst full year of generation under the CfD contract, which commenced on 21 December 2016.
ROC sales
The generation and sale of ROCs is a key driver of the Group’s ﬁnancial performance. The RO scheme started in April 2002 and places an 
obligation on electricity suppliers to source an increasing proportion of their electricity from renewable sources. Under the RO, ROCs are 
certiﬁcates issued to generators of renewable electricity which are then sold to suppliers to demonstrate that they have fulﬁlled their 
obligations under the RO. ROCs are managed in compliance periods (CPs), running from April to March annually, CP1 commenced in April 
2002. At 31 December 2017 we are in CP16.
To meet its obligations a supplier can either submit ROCs or pay the “buy-out” price at the end of the CP. The buy-out price was set at £30 per 
ROC in CP1 and rises with inflation. The buy-out price in CP16 is £45.58. ROCs are typically procured in arm’s-length transactions with 
renewable generators at a market price typically slightly lower than the buy-out price for that CP. At the end of the CP, the amounts collected 
from suppliers paying the buy-out price form the “recycle fund”, which is distributed on a pro-rata basis to ROC generators.
The ﬁnancial beneﬁt of a ROC recognised in the income statement at the point of generation is thus comprised of two parts: the expected 
value to be obtained in a sale transaction with a third party supplier and the expected recycle fund beneﬁt to be received at the end of the 
CP. See note 3.3 on page 140 for further details of ROCs generated and sold by our Power Generation business and those utilised by our B2B 
Energy Supply business in the year.

2.4 REVIEW OF FIXED ASSETS FOR IMPAIRMENT 
Accounting policy
The Group reviews its ﬁxed assets (or, where appropriate, groups of assets known as cash-generating units (CGUs)) whenever there is an 
indication that an impairment loss may have been suffered. The Group assesses the existence of indicators of impairment annually. The 
Group considers the smallest collections of assets that generate independent cash flows to be its operating entities (Drax Power, Haven 
Power, Opus Energy and Drax Biomass) and accordingly considers the Group to be comprised of four CGUs.
If an indication of potential impairment exists, the recoverable amount of the asset or CGU in question is assessed with reference to the 
present value of the future cash flows expected to be derived from the continuing use of the asset or CGU (value in use) or the expected 
price that would be received to sell the asset to another market participant (fair value less costs to sell). The initial assessment of recoverable 
amount is normally based on value in use.
Where value in use is calculated, the assessment of future cash flows is based on the most recent approved business plan and includes all of 
the necessary costs expected to be incurred to generate the cash inflows from the CGU’s assets in their current state and condition, 
including an allocation of centrally managed costs. Central costs are only allocated where they are necessary for and directly attributable to 
the CGU’s activities. Future cash flows include, where relevant, contracted cash flows arising from our cash flow hedging activities and as a 
result the carrying amount of each CGU includes the mark-to-market value of those cash flow hedges.

SECTION 2: FINANCIAL PERFORMANCE
2.4 REVIEW OF FIXED ASSETS FOR IMPAIRMENT CONTINUED
The additional value that could be obtained from enhancing or converting the Group’s assets is not reflected, nor the potential beneﬁt of any 
future restructuring or reorganisation. In determining value in use, the estimate of future cash flows is discounted to present value using a 
pre-tax rate reflecting the speciﬁc risks attributable to the CGU in question.
If the recoverable amount is less than the current carrying amount in the ﬁnancial statements, a provision is made to reduce the carrying 
amount of the asset or CGU to the estimated recoverable amount. Impairment losses are recognised immediately in the income statement.
Goodwill balances are assessed for impairment annually (see note 5.2).
Assessment of indicators of impairment
The Group's market capitalisation has remained below the carrying value of its net assets this year. As part of the most recent annual review, 
the Group considered this and concluded that a potential indicator of impairment existed in respect of the Drax Power CGU. This assessment 
was based upon continued weakness in commodity markets, volatility in foreign exchange rates, perceived levels of regulatory uncertainty 
and the sensitivity of the recoverable amount of Drax Power's assets to changes in these factors.
Accordingly, an impairment review of the Drax Power CGU was undertaken at the balance sheet date. A review of other CGUs suggested no 
indicators of impairment.
Signiﬁcant estimation uncertainty
The assessment of the present value of future cash flows on which such a review is based is dependent upon a number of assumptions. In 
particular, expected future cash flows are based upon management’s estimates of future prices, output, costs, economic support for 
renewable energy generation and access to contracts for electricity generation and supply. Where relevant and to the fullest extent possible, 
the key assumptions are based on observable market information. However, observable market information is only available for a limited 
proportion of the remaining useful lives of the assets under review.
Impairment review
The carrying amount of the Drax Power CGU at 31 December 2017 was £1,430 million. The value in use of the Drax Power CGU was tested 
using the Group’s established planning model.
The analysis assumed that Drax Power’s three biomass-fuelled generating units will continue in operation until the end of their estimated 
useful lives, currently considered to be 2039. In line with our assumption that coal-ﬁred generation will cease by 2025, applied in light of the 
Government's announced intention to close coal-ﬁred generation following recent consultations, the three remaining coal-ﬁred units were 
assumed to cease coal-ﬁred generation by this date but will then be available for conversion to alternative fuels. No account has been taken 
of any cash inflows that could result from such a conversion (which could take place earlier than 2025) in measuring the value in use of the 
Drax Power CGU. This includes potential cash flows arising from the fourth unit conversion to biomass and possible repowering of the ﬁfth 
and sixth units to gas.
The analysis depends on a broad range of assumptions, including the expected life of the six power generating units and the regulatory 
regime under which they might operate. The key assumptions (i.e. those most sensitive to a change, possibly resulting in a different outcome 
for impairment) are considered to be:
 – the expected operating lives of the six generating units, as described above; 
 – future commodity prices beyond the horizon of our existing contracted purchase and sale commitments – notably power prices and 
biomass prices; 
 – future foreign exchange rates beyond the horizon of our existing contracted purchase commitments; and 
 – the continuance of existing biomass support regimes – CfD and RO – until 2027 and the existence of a favourable economic environment 
for biomass generation thereafter. This includes future capacity market and system support revenues. 
These assumptions are all dependent on external market movements. The historic volatility in these assumptions is reflected in the ﬁnancial 
performance of the Group but past performance is not necessarily a reliable indicator of future values.
Where available, estimates of future prices are based on signed contracts for purchases and sales with third parties. Intra-group purchases 
of biomass are included at contract prices which are based on our view of future market prices. Transactions beyond contracted positions 
are valued using market data and forward price curves, based where possible on data points provided by a reputable third party source, 
independent to the Group. In particular, longer-term power prices are based on assumptions from Aurora Energy Research. The contracted 
period for biomass purchases is substantially longer, with the longest-dated contracts expiring in 2027. Beyond this point, estimated biomass 
prices are largely based on our internal models which reflect our assessment of future market prices.
Future foreign exchange rates are based on contracted foreign currency purchases to the extent possible. Beyond our contracted position, 
exchange rate estimates are based on market forward curves.
Current Government plans for existing renewable support mechanisms, namely the CfD and RO, assume these cease in 2027. The 
impairment analysis made no assumptions regarding the direct replacement of these support mechanisms beyond this date. The biomass-
fuelled units that are assumed to continue to generate power do so supported by the prevailing wholesale power price, delivery of ancillary 
services to the UK grid and an expectation that capacity market revenues will be available to these units. Our power price forecasts reflect 
increased volatility between peak and baseload prices. Assumed revenues from ancillary services and the capacity market are based on 
projections derived from current contracts and capacity market outcomes and how we expect the market to evolve. These assumptions 
Drax Group plc Annual report and accounts 2017
133
2.4 REVIEW OF FIXED ASSETS FOR IMPAIRMENT CONTINUED
reflect our expectation that Drax will be required to provide generation to support intermittent renewable power and be an essential part of 
the UK’s energy mix throughout the life of the units.
The expected future cash flows were discounted using a pre-tax nominal rate of 7.3%. The discount rate is supported by observable market 
reports and independent analysis commissioned by, and speciﬁc to the circumstances of, the Group and the Power Generation business. This 
indicated that the recoverable amount of the Drax Power CGU exceeded its carrying value and therefore that no provisions for impairment 
were required.
Sensitivity analysis indicated that, when compared to our base case assumptions, a reduction of approximately 21% in market power prices, 
an increase in biomass prices of approximately 31%, or a depreciation of Sterling against the US Dollar of approximately 24% throughout the 
22-year term of the valuation would result in a recoverable amount for the Drax Power CGU that is lower than its carrying amount. 
Furthermore, the valuation includes cash flows for the period from 2027–2039 in line with the assumed useful economic lives of the assets. 
If the value from this period was removed in its entirety, it would not result in an impairment charge. The analysis does not consider the 
interaction effect of potential changes in several or all of the assumptions simultaneously, and the sensitivities do not take account of any 
mitigating actions that could be taken should the changes referred to materialise. In addition, in relation to central costs, no reasonable 
change in the method of allocation would result in an impairment charge.
2.5 NET FINANCE COSTS
Finance costs reflect expenses incurred in managing our debt structure (such as interest payable on our bonds) as well as foreign exchange 
gains and losses, the unwinding of discounting on provisions for reinstatement of our sites at the end of their useful lives (see note 5.4) and 
net interest charged on the Group’s deﬁned beneﬁt pension scheme obligation (see note 6.3). These are offset by interest income that we 
generate through efﬁcient use of short-term cash surpluses – for example through investment in money market funds.
On 5 May 2017, the Group reﬁnanced its external debt. The resulting cost of £24.2 million (2016: £nil) reflects the costs incurred to extinguish 
the existing debt together with the release of the related deferred borrowing costs. As described in note 2.7, these costs have been excluded 
from the calculation of underlying earnings. Further information about the new ﬁnance structure can be found in note 4.3.

Foreign exchange gains and losses recognised in interest arise on the retranslation of non-derivative balances and investments 
denominated in foreign currencies to prevailing rates at the balance sheet date. Sterling strengthened against the US Dollar and Euro 
during 2017, resulting in losses being recognised on assets the Group holds denominated in these currencies.

SECTION 2: FINANCIAL PERFORMANCE
2.6 CURRENT AND DEFERRED TAXATION
The tax charge includes both current and deferred tax. Current tax is the estimated amount of tax payable on this year’s taxable proﬁts 
(which are adjusted for items upon which we are not required to pay tax or, in some cases, for items which are not allowable for tax purposes 
and therefore on which we are required to pay additional tax) and adjusted for estimates for previous years. Deferred tax is an accounting 
adjustment which reflects where more or less tax is expected to arise in the future due to differences between the accounting and tax rules 
(reflected in differences between the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities in the balance sheet and the corresponding tax bases used in 
the computation of taxable proﬁts). The tax credit reflects the estimated effective tax rate on the loss before tax for the Group for the year 
ended 31 December 2017 and the movement in the deferred tax balance in the year, so far as it relates to items recognised in the income 
statement.
Accounting policy
Current tax, including UK corporation tax and foreign tax, is based on the taxable proﬁt or loss for the year in the relevant jurisdiction. Taxable 
proﬁt or loss differs from proﬁt/loss before tax as reported in the income statement because it excludes items of income or expenditure that 
are either taxable or deductible in other years or never taxable/deductible. The Group’s liability (or asset) for current tax is provided at 
amounts expected to be paid (or recovered) using the tax rates and laws that have been enacted or substantively enacted by the balance 
sheet date.
Deferred tax is the tax expected to be payable or recoverable on differences between the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities in the 
ﬁnancial statements and the corresponding tax bases used in the computation of taxable proﬁt. Deferred tax liabilities are generally 
recognised for all taxable temporary differences and deferred tax assets are recognised to the extent that it is probable that taxable proﬁts 
will be available against which deductible temporary differences can be utilised.
Current and deferred tax are recognised in proﬁt or loss, except when they relate to items that are recognised in other comprehensive 
income or directly in equity, in which case the current and deferred tax are recognised in other comprehensive income or directly in equity 
respectively.
Signiﬁcant estimation uncertainty
In accounting for taxation the Group makes assumptions regarding the treatment of items of income and expenditure for tax purposes. The 
Group believes that these assumptions are reasonable based on prior experience and consultation with advisers. Full provision is made for 
deferred taxation at the rates of tax prevailing at the period end date unless future rates have been substantively enacted. Deferred tax 
assets are recognised where it is considered more likely than not that they will be recovered. Where such assets relate to losses incurred by a 
business unit, particularly one with a history of losses, the Group seeks evidence other than its own internal forecasts to support recognition 
of the related deferred tax asset.

UK corporation tax is the main rate of tax for the Group and is calculated at 19.25% (2016: 20%) of the assessable proﬁt or loss for the year. 
Tax for other jurisdictions is calculated at the rates prevailing in the respective jurisdictions. 
Deferred tax is calculated at the tax rates that are expected to apply in the period when the liability is settled or the asset is realised based on 
jurisdictional tax laws and rates that have been enacted or substantively enacted at the balance sheet date. In December 2017, US Tax 
Reforms were legislated and introduced a package of tax measures, including a reduction in the US federal tax rate from 35% to 21% from 
January 2018. This rate reduction has been reflected in the US deferred tax balances at 31 December 2017. We do not anticipate any other 
impact of the US Tax Reforms on the deferred tax balances.

The Group’s underlying effective tax rate is sensitive to the mix of operating results between our UK and US businesses and the tax rates 
which apply in those jurisdictions. However, as a result of the reduction in the US federal tax rates from 2018 to 21%, and tax relief now arising 
to the group from the UK Patent Box regime (see below), in the medium term we anticipate our group underlying effective tax rate to be 
marginally lower than the main rate of corporation tax in the UK. The adjustments in respect of prior periods principally relate to a Patent Box 
claim. Drax Power was granted a patent to protect certain intellectual property it owns and which attaches to the technology developed to 
manage the combustion process in generating electricity from biomass. Under UK tax legislation the Company is now entitled to apply a 
lower rate of tax to some of its proﬁts each year which are derived from utilisation of that technology. The Company has agreed a claim with 
HMRC for tax relief covering the period from the patent application in 2013 to 2016 amounting to £10.4 million. In line with the policy 
intentions of IFRIC 23 “Uncertainty over Income Tax Treatments”, the Group has also recognised an estimated beneﬁt from the tax regime for 
the ﬁnancial year 2017 of £2.6 million (included in the “Other” line in the table above). The movements in deferred tax assets and liabilities 
during each year are shown below.

2.6 CURRENT AND DEFERRED TAXATION CONTINUED
Deferred tax assets and liabilities are offset where the Group has a legally enforceable right to do so, otherwise they are shown separately in 
the balance sheet.
Within the above deferred tax balances is a net deferred tax asset of £22.7 million in relation to start-up losses and other temporary 
differences in the US-based Pellet Production business. Based on its business plan and reflecting continuing improvement in operational 
performance, the Group anticipates generating sufﬁcient proﬁts in future periods against which to utilise this asset.
2.7 UNDERLYING EARNINGS
Following the announcement of the change in the Group's dividend policy on 15 June 2017, there is no longer a link between underlying 
earnings and the calculation of distributions. We have continued to present underlying earnings, an alternative performance measure 
(see page 120), to provide a consistent, comparable measure of the overall ﬁnancial performance of the Group year-on-year.
Underlying earnings is deﬁned as proﬁt after tax, as measured in accordance with IFRS, adjusted to exclude unrealised gains and losses on 
derivative contracts and material one-off items that do not reflect the underlying performance of the business. 
This note analyses the items which are included in our results for the year but are excluded from underlying earnings:
 – Unrealised gains and losses on derivative contracts: calculated in accordance with IAS 39 on derivative contracts not designated into 
hedge relationships for accounting purposes but held for the purposes of de-risking future cash flows (see note 7.2), excluded due to their 
inherent volatility which does not reflect current operational performance.
 – Acquisition-related costs: material one-off costs associated with the acquisition and integration of Opus Energy during 2017.
 – Cost of debt restructure: material one-off costs incurred as part of the restructuring of the Group's debt in May 2017.
 – In 2016, deferred tax on start-up losses and other temporary differences: a material one-off credit arising from the recognition of a 
deferred tax asset relating to the Pellet Production business.

2.8 EARNINGS PER SHARE AND UNDERLYING EARNINGS PER SHARE
Earnings per share (EPS) represents the amount of our earnings (post-tax proﬁts) that is attributable to each ordinary share we have in issue. 
Basic EPS is calculated by dividing our earnings (proﬁt after tax calculated in accordance with IFRS) by the weighted average number of 
ordinary shares that were in issue during the year. Diluted EPS demonstrates the impact if all outstanding share options (such as those to be 
issued under our employee share schemes – see note 6.2), that are expected to vest on their future maturity dates, were exercised and 
treated as ordinary shares as at the balance sheet date.
In addition to EPS, we calculate underlying EPS. Underlying EPS is based upon underlying earnings as deﬁned in note 2.7. 
The effect of potentially dilutive options on the weighted average number of shares in issue at the balance sheet date is shown below:

As described on page 49, on 15 June 2017 we announced a new dividend policy. 
At the forthcoming Annual General Meeting the Board will recommend to shareholders that a resolution is passed to approve payment of 
a ﬁnal dividend for the year ended 31 December 2017 of 7.4 pence per share (equivalent to approximately £30 million) payable on or before 
11 May 2018. The ﬁnal dividend has not been included as a liability as at 31 December 2017. This would bring total dividends payable in respect 
of the 2017 ﬁnancial year to £50 million.
 
In future years, in determining the value of dividends the Board will take account of future investment opportunities and the less predictable 
cash flows from the Group’s commodity based businesses. If there is a build-up of capital in excess of the Group’s investment needs the 
Board will consider the most appropriate mechanism to return this to shareholders.

Retained proﬁts are a component of our equity reserves. The overall balance reflects the total proﬁts we have generated over our lifetime,

Distributable proﬁts
The capacity of the Group to make dividend payments is primarily determined by the availability of retained distributable profits and cash resources. 
The immediate cash resources of the Group of £222.3 million are set out in note 4.2 and the recent history of cash generation within note 
4.4. The majority of these cash resources are held centrally within the Group by Drax Corporate Limited. The Parent Company ﬁnancial 
statements, set out on pages 172–177 of this report, disclose the Parent Company’s distributable reserves of £229.7 million. Sufﬁcient 
reserves are available across the Group as a whole to make future distributions in accordance with the Group’s updated dividend policy for 
the foreseeable future.
The majority of the Group’s distributable reserves are held in holding and operating subsidiaries. Management actively monitors the level of 
distributable reserves in each company in the Group, ensuring adequate reserves are available for upcoming dividend payments and that the 
Parent Company has access to these reserves.
The Group's new ﬁnancing facilities (see note 4.3) place certain conditions on the value of dividend payments to be made in any given year. 
We expect to be able to make dividend payments, in line with our new policy, within these conditions for the foreseeable future.

This section gives further information on the operating assets we use to generate revenue and the short-term liquid assets and liabilities, 
managed during day-to-day operations, that comprise our working capital balances.
3.1 PROPERTY, PLANT AND EQUIPMENT
This note shows the cost, depreciation and net book value of the physical assets controlled by us that we use in our businesses to generate 
revenue. The cost of an asset is what we paid to purchase or construct the asset. Depreciation reflects the usage of the asset over time and 
is calculated by taking the cost of the asset, net of any residual value, to the income statement evenly over the useful economic life of the 
asset. An asset’s net book value is its cost less any depreciation (including impairment, if required) charged to date.
On 13 April 2017, the Group acquired the wood pellet manufacturing plant owned by Louisiana Pellets Inc, for consideration of $35 million 
(£27.4 million). The assets of the plant were acquired at auction through a bankruptcy court and did not constitute a business in their own 
right. At the point of acquisition, the plant was not operational, there was no workforce in place and no raw material contracts for it to 
operate as a business. In accordance with the requirements of IFRS 3 – Business combinations, the acquisition has been accounted for as an 
asset purchase. Since the date of acquisition, further costs totalling £20.4 million have been capitalised and the plant is expected to begin 
commercial operations in 2018.
Accounting policy
Property, plant and equipment are initially measured at cost. Cost comprises the purchase price (after deducting trade discounts and 
rebates), any directly attributable costs of bringing the asset to the location and condition necessary for it to be capable of operating in the 
manner intended by management, and the estimate of the present value of the costs of dismantling and removing the item and restoring the 
site. Property, plant and equipment are stated at cost less accumulated depreciation and any provision for impairment in value.
We construct many of our assets as part of long-term development projects. Assets that are in the course of construction are not 
depreciated until they are ready for us to use in the way intended.
Depreciation is provided on a straight-line basis to write down assets to their residual value evenly over the estimated useful lives (UEL) of the 
assets from the date of acquisition (where relevant, limited to the expected decommissioning date of the power station – currently expected 
to be 2039). The table below shows the range of useful lives at the date of acquisition and the average remaining useful life at the balance 
sheet date of the main categories of asset we own in years:

Freehold land held at cost is considered to have an unlimited useful life and is not depreciated.
Electricity generation plant refers to core electricity generation assets at Drax Power Station which are fuel agnostic. Biomass-speciﬁc and 
coal-speciﬁc assets are those assets that are only necessary to support electricity generation from the speciﬁed fuel and include fuel 
storage and distribution systems.
Within the plant and equipment categories shorter lives are attributed to components that are overhauled and upgraded as part of rolling 
outage cycles. The majority of assets within these categories have a remaining useful life in excess of 15 years.
Plant spare parts are depreciated over the remaining useful life of the power station.
Costs relating to major inspections, overhauls and upgrades to the power station are included in the asset’s carrying amount or recognised 
as a separate asset, as appropriate, if the recognition criteria are met; namely, when it is probable that future economic beneﬁts associated 
with the item will flow to the Group and the cost of the item can be measured reliably. All other repairs and maintenance costs are expensed 
as incurred.
Estimated useful lives and residual values are reviewed annually, taking into account regulatory change and commercial and technological 
obsolescence as well as normal wear and tear. Residual values are based on prices prevailing at each balance sheet date. Any changes are 
applied prospectively.

3.1 PROPERTY, PLANT AND EQUIPMENT CONTINUED
Signiﬁcant estimation uncertainty
Asset lives are reviewed annually at each balance sheet date. The estimated useful lives of coal-speciﬁc assets at Drax Power Station have 
been revised with effect from 1 January 2017 as a result of the Government’s announcement that all coal generation will be closed during 
2025. Having considered this event, the Group concluded that coal generation will cease during 2025, but that the three existing coal units 
will be retained for conversion to alternative fuels in the period to 2039. This results in the useful lives of the coal-speciﬁc assets which will 
not be required to support generation after this date being shortened to no later than 2025. This change has been applied prospectively, 
from 1 January 2017, and has resulted in an increase of approximately £15 million per annum in depreciation charges in 2017 compared to 
2016, which will recur in each year until 2025. The useful lives of electricity generation plant currently fuelled by biomass are unaffected by 
this change. No further changes to the useful economic lives of assets have been made as a result of the most recent review.
At each balance sheet date, the Group reviews its property, plant and equipment to determine whether there is any indication that these 
assets may be impaired. The Group's accounting policy in respect of impairment, along with details of the impairment review conducted 
during 2017, are set out in note 2.4.

SECTION 3: OPERATING ASSETS AND WORKING CAPITAL
3.1 PROPERTY, PLANT AND EQUIPMENT CONTINUED
Reflecting continued investment in the Group's IT software systems and the increasing signiﬁcance of the value of such assets as a result, IT 
software assets have been presented as a component of intangible assets from 2017 (see note 5.3). As a result of this change in presentation, 
assets with a net book value of £14.4 million previously presented in property, plant and equipment have been transferred in this period.
Issues and transfers reflect changes in the categorisation of assets during the period, or the issue of spare parts for use in repair and 
maintenance projects. When spares are utilised in such projects, the cost of the part is transferred from the property, plant and equipment 
balance and recognised as an expense in the income statement within operating costs.
Losses on disposal in the income statement of £15.4 million include £3.6 million relating to the disposal of Billington Bioenergy on 31 October 
2017.
3.2 OTHER FIXED ASSET INVESTMENTS
During 2017, the Group acquired 1.6 million shares in Aggregated Micro Power Holdings plc (AMPH) as part-consideration for the disposal of 
Billington Bioenergy. AMPH is an AIM-listed energy company specialising in the sale of wood fuels and the development of distributed energy 
assets, including biomass boilers and battery storage. Through its shareholding in AMPH, the Group retains an interest in the UK heating 
market, whilst gaining exposure to the development of small-scale distributed energy assets.
Accounting policy
Other investments are recognised at fair value, based on quoted market prices, at the date of transfer. The assets are classiﬁed at fair value 
through proﬁt and loss in accordance with IAS 39. Subsequent movements in the fair value are recognised in the income statement.

3.3 ROC ASSETS
We earn Renewable Obligation Certiﬁcate (ROC) assets, which are accredited by the Ofﬁce for Gas and Electricity Markets (Ofgem), as a 
result of burning sustainable compressed wood pellets to generate electricity. This note sets out the value of these assets that we have 
earned but not yet sold.
Total ROC generation has reduced in 2017, compared to previous periods, following the approval of the CfD contract for one of our biomass-
fuelled units in December 2016, which was previously supported by the ROC regime. Haven Power and Opus Energy provide us with a 
credit-efﬁcient and timely route to market for these ROCs.
Accounting policy
ROCs are recognised as current assets in the period they are generated and are initially measured at fair value based on anticipated sales 
prices. The value of ROCs earned is recognised in the income statement as a reduction in fuel costs in that period.
Where our B2B Energy Supply electricity sales incur an obligation to deliver ROCs to Ofgem, that obligation is provided for in the period 
incurred.
At each reporting date the Group reviews the fair value of ROC assets generated but not sold against updated anticipated sales prices 
including, where relevant, agreed forward sale contracts and taking into account likely utilisation of ROCs generated to settle our own 
ROC obligations. Any impairments required are recognised in the income statement in the period incurred.
Drax Group plc Annual report and accounts 2017

3.3 ROC ASSETS CONTINUED
Signiﬁcant estimation uncertainty
The fair values and net realisable values of ROCs referred to above are calculated with reference to assumptions regarding future sales prices 
in the market, taking into account agreed forward sale contracts where appropriate. Historic experience indicates that the assumptions 
used in the valuation are reasonable; however, actual sales prices may differ from those assumed.
ROC valuations also include an estimate of the future beneﬁt that may be obtained from the ROC recycle fund at the end of the compliance 
period. The recycle fund provides a beneﬁt where supplier buy-out charges (incurred by suppliers who do not procure sufﬁcient ROCs to 
satisfy their obligations) are returned to renewable generators on a pro-rata basis. The estimate is based on assumptions about likely levels 
of renewable generation and supply over the compliance period and is thus subject to some uncertainty. The Group utilises external sources 
of information in addition to its own forecasts in making these estimates. Past experience indicates that the values arrived at are reasonable 
but they remain subject to possible variation.

3.4 INVENTORIES
We hold stocks of fuels and other consumable items that we use in the process of generating electricity, and raw materials used in the 
production of compressed wood pellets. This note shows the cost of coal, biomass, other fuels and plant consumables that we held at the 
end of the year, including items at Drax Power Station, our facilities in the US and those owned by us but stored in off-site locations.
Accounting policy
Our raw materials and fuel stocks are valued at the lower of the weighted average cost to purchase and net realisable value.
The cost of fuel stocks includes all direct costs and overheads incurred in bringing the fuel to its present location and condition, including the 
purchase price, import duties and other taxes (including amounts levied on coal under the UK carbon price support mechanism) and 
transport/ handling costs.
Both coal and biomass stocks are weighed when entering, moving within or exiting our sites using technology regularly calibrated to industry 
standards. Fuel burn in the electricity generation process is calculated using a combination of weights and thermal efﬁciency calculations to 
provide closing stock volumes. Both calibrated weighers and efﬁciency calculations are subject to a range of tolerable error. All fuel 
inventories are subject to regular surveys to ensure accuracy of these measurements.
Coal stocks are veriﬁed by an independent stock survey carried out by a suitably trained specialist, and a provision is made where the survey 
indicates a lower level of stock than indicated by the methods described above. Despite being an independent process, the survey depends 
on estimates and assumptions and as a result actual values may differ.
The characteristics of biomass require specialist handling and storage. On-site biomass at Drax Power Station is stored in sealed domes with 
a carefully controlled atmosphere for ﬁre prevention purposes and thus cannot be surveyed using traditional methods. Biomass stock is 
surveyed using regularly calibrated state-of-the-art RADAR scanning technology.

The cost of inventories recognised as an expense in the year ended 31 December 2017 was £1,285.8 million (2016: £1,173.5 million).
3.5 TRADE AND OTHER RECEIVABLES
Trade receivables represent amounts owed to us by our customers for goods or services we have provided but not yet been paid for. Other 
receivables include accrued income, which is income earned in the period but not yet invoiced, largely in respect of power delivered that will 
be invoiced the following month, and prepayments, which are amounts paid by the Group for which we are yet to receive the relevant goods 
or services in return (e.g. insurance premiums relating to periods after the balance sheet date).
Accounting policy
Trade and other receivables, given their short tenor, are measured at cost. A provision for impairment of trade receivables is established 
where there is objective evidence that the Group will not be able to collect all amounts due according to the original terms of the receivable.

Trade receivables and accrued income principally represent sales of energy to counterparties within both our Power Generation and B2B 
Energy Supply businesses. At 31 December 2017, the Group had amounts receivable from ﬁve (2016: four) signiﬁcant counterparties 
representing 20% (2016: 46%) of total trade receivables and accrued income.
The increase in trade receivables and accrued income is principally the result of Opus Energy joining the Group in 2017. 
Of total trade and other receivables at 31 December 2017, £123.9 million (2016: £33.4 million) relates to B2B Energy Supply sales. The risk 
proﬁle of B2B Energy Supply debt is different from that of the Power Generation business due to a larger volume of smaller counterparties, 
and therefore a lower concentration of credit risk, with different payment terms. 
The Group does not consider there to be any requirement for further provisions in excess of the provision for doubtful debts of £28.2 million 
(2016: £4.0 million). This provision, which largely relates to B2B Energy Supply receivables, has been determined with reference to past 
default experiences in line with our policies. Credit and counterparty risk are both discussed in further detail in note 7.1.
All past-due receivables are assessed against the Group’s credit risk policies for indicators of impairment and provisions made where 
appropriate. 
The movement in the allowance for doubtful debts is laid out in the following table:

The customer base of Opus Energy is comprised of a large number of smaller enterprises. Accordingly, Opus Energy carries lower 
concentrations but higher levels of credit risk compared to the rest of the Group. This is reflected in the increase of the allowance for 
doubtful debts acquired when the Group obtained control of Opus Energy.
The value of trade receivables that are past due and not provided against, in accordance with the assessment described above, is 
£32.2 million (2016: £3.6 million). An ageing analysis of this amount is provided in the table below:

Energy Supply activities. The remaining balance principally comprises third party grid charge accruals of £36.8 million (2016: £26.5 million) 
and FiT accruals of £25.9 million (2016: 21.2 million).
The Group recognises a liability in respect of its unsettled obligations to deliver emissions allowances under the EU Emission Trading Scheme 
(ETS). Accruals at 31 December 2017 include £30.6 million (2016: £2.8 million) with respect to the Group’s estimated net liability to deliver CO2 
emissions allowances. Allowances are purchased in the market and are recorded at cost.
At 31 December 2017, the amounts payable in respect of acquisitions reflect the contingent consideration payable in relation to the 
acquisition of four Open-Cycle Gas Turbine (OCGT) projects in 2016. Initial consideration of £18.6 million was settled in cash on 3 January 
2017, with the amount held as a liability in the balance sheet at 31 December 2016. The ﬁnal purchase price depends upon future clearing 
prices in T-4 capacity market auctions from 2016 to 2020. The range of possible outcomes being zero further consideration if the capacity 
market clearing price does not exceed £28/KW in these auctions, with a maximum contingent consideration payable of £72 million, based 
on a clearing price of £75/KW. The fair value of the contingent consideration at 31 December 2017 was assessed at £4.1 million (2016: 
£3.8 million) based on a projection of likely future capacity market clearing prices, discounted to present value at a risk-free rate of 2%.

4.3 BORROWINGS
On 10 February 2017, the Group entered into a £375 million acquisition ﬁnance facility, of which £200 million was drawn and utilised in the 
purchase of Opus Energy (see note 5.1). This facility, along with the existing term loans at 1 January 2017, was repaid in full on 5 May 2017, 
when the Group undertook a reﬁnancing exercise. 
The new ﬁnancing structure consists of £550 million of high-yield, publicly traded bonds listed on the Luxembourg exchange. This includes 
£350 million 4.25% ﬁxed rate notes and £200 million floating rate notes of 4.00% above LIBOR, which all mature in April 2022.
On the same day, the Group entered into a £350 million Facility comprised of a revolving credit facility (RCF) with a value of £315 million (2016: 
£400 million) and an index-linked term loan of £35 million.
The RCF matures in April 2021, with an option to extend by one year, and has a margin of 150 basis points over LIBOR. At 31 December 2017, 
the RCF had been utilised to draw down letters of credit with a total value of £35.7 million (2016: 57.9 million). 
The Group also has access to a $25 million revolving 30 day facility in the US business. This facility was fully drawn down at 31 December 
2017 and had a Sterling equivalent value of £18.5 million at that date. 
The term loan was fully drawn at inception and remains fully drawn at 31 December 2017 (2016: term loans of £325 million fully drawn). 
The Group has no other undrawn debt facilities, although it does have access to certain non-recourse trade receivable ﬁnance facilities as 
described on note 4.4 which are utilised to accelerate working capital cash flows.
Accounting policy
The Group measures all debt instruments (whether ﬁnancial assets or ﬁnancial liabilities) initially at fair value, which equates to the principal 
value of the consideration paid or received. Subsequent to initial measurement, debt instruments are measured at amortised cost using the 
effective interest method. Transaction costs (any such costs incremental and directly attributable to the issue of the ﬁnancial instrument) 
are included in the calculation of the effective interest rate and are amortised through the income statement over the life of the instrument.
Fees paid on the establishment of loan facilities are recognised as transaction costs of the loan to the extent that it is probable that some or 
all of the facility will be drawn down. Where this is the case, the fee is deferred until the draw-down occurs.

Note:
(1) During 2016 we closed out a number of in-the-money forward foreign currency purchase contracts with a total value of £14 million. As these contracts were designated into hedge accounting 
relationships under IAS 39, the benefit is being recognised in the income statement in the period the hedged transaction occurs. The net loss for 2017 includes £10 million of income in relation to the 
unwinding of this position, for which the cash was received in 2016.
The Group has access to a facility that enables it to accelerate the cash flows associated with trade receivables arising from B2B Energy 
Supply sales on a non-recourse basis. The net cash beneﬁt derived from this facility during 2017 was £110 million (2016: £74 million) and is 
recognised as a reduction in receivables in the table above. We estimate that approximately 30% of this cash would have been received in 
the ordinary course of business by 31 December 2017 had the facility not been in place.
The Group also has access to similar non-recourse facilities to accelerate cash flows on ROC receivables. No ROC receivables have been sold 
through these facilities in 2017 (2016: net cash beneﬁt of £111 million). The reduction in ROCs in the table above reflects a reduction in the 
number of generation units that give rise to ROCs following the approval of the CfD contract for one of our biomass-fuelled units in 
December 2016.

SECTION 5
Other assets and liabilities
This section provides information on the assets and liabilities in the Consolidated balance sheet that are not covered in other sections, 
including goodwill, other intangible assets and the provision for reinstatement.
5.1 ACQUISITIONS
Accounting policy
Acquisitions of businesses are recognised at the point the Group obtains control of the target (the acquisition date). The consideration 
transferred and the assets and liabilities acquired are measured at their fair value on the acquisition date. The assets and liabilities acquired 
are recognised in the Consolidated balance sheet and the proﬁts of the acquired business are recognised in the Consolidated income 
statement from the acquisition date. Acquisition-related costs are recognised in the income statement in the period the acquisition occurs 
in the transaction costs line. Goodwill is measured as the excess of the fair value of the consideration transferred over the fair value of the 
identiﬁable net assets acquired.
Acquisition of Opus Energy Group Limited (Opus Energy)
The acquisition of Opus Energy was approved by shareholders on 8 February 2017 and subsequently completed on 10 February 2017; the 
Group acquired 100% of the issued share capital on this date.
Opus Energy is a well-established B2B energy supply business serving business customers principally in the SME market, providing 
diversiﬁcation of our retail offering and a robust platform for growth in line with our strategy. Opus Energy has contributed positively to 
earnings and cash flow immediately following the acquisition.
The purchase consideration was £340 million plus interest calculated on the amount of Opus Energy’s net assets from 31 March 2016 to 
the acquisition date. The total consideration of £367 million was funded by a combination of existing cash reserves (£167 million) and partial 
drawing of a £375 million acquisition facility (£200 million). This facility was repaid as part of the reﬁnancing described in note 4.3.
Acquisition-related costs amounted to £7.8 million.
Following a detailed exercise to review the assets and liabilities, including intangible assets, the fair values acquired were as follows:

The ﬁgures above have changed from those disclosed in the interim ﬁnancial statements published on 19 July 2017. The Group has continued 
to review and align estimates for the B2B Energy Supply business. This process resulted in a number of remeasurements reducing the fair 
value of the net assets acquired by £4.4 million, with a corresponding increase in goodwill. The values shown above are now ﬁnal.
Following the acquisition, the Group has been able to identify and measure the fair value of existing customer contracts, the Opus Energy 
brand and software. The assets will be amortised over their useful economic lives as follows:
 – Existing customer contracts 11 years (reducing balance)
 – Brand 10 years (straight line)
 – Software 3 years (straight line)
Drax Group plc Annual report and accounts 2017
149
5.1 ACQUISITIONS CONTINUED
The fair value measurement of the existing customer contracts requires assumptions to be made, in particular regarding margins on current 
customer contracts, future contract renewal rates and future margins on renewed contracts. The goodwill of £159 million recognised on 
acquisition is largely reflective of potential customer contracts and growth opportunities together with the assembled workforce. None of 
the goodwill is deductible for tax purposes.
The ﬁnancial assets acquired include £130 million of receivables, the majority of which reflect trade receivables for energy supplied to 
customers. By virtue of their short tenor, the fair value of these receivables is considered to be the contractual amounts receivable less any 
provision for doubtful debts. The provision for doubtful debts as at the acquisition date was £20 million.
Additional ﬁnancial information
The consolidated results of the Group, assuming Opus Energy had been acquired at the beginning of the year, would show revenue of 
£3,775.7 million (compared to reported revenue of £3,685.2 million), EBITDA of £231.6 million (compared to the reported EBITDA of £228.9 
million) and a loss after taxation of £149.0 million (compared to a reported loss after taxation of £151.1 million). This information includes the 
revenue and proﬁts made by Opus Energy between 1 January 2017 and 10 February 2017, without accounting policy alignments and/or the 
impact of fair value uplifts resulting from acquisition accounting adjustments. This information is not necessarily indicative of the results of 
the combined Group that would have occurred had the acquisition actually been made at the beginning of the year, or indicative of the 
future results of the combined Group.
5.2 GOODWILL
Goodwill arises on the acquisition of a business when the consideration paid exceeds the fair value of the assets acquired. During 2017, 
we recognised additional goodwill on the purchase of Opus Energy (see note 5.1), and wrote off goodwill of £3.8 million in respect of 
Billington Bioenergy following the sale of the business.
Accounting policy
Goodwill is initially recognised and measured at the acquisition date. Goodwill is not amortised but reviewed for impairment at least annually. 
For the purpose of impairment testing, goodwill is allocated to the CGU to which it relates and the recoverable amount for that CGU 
assessed. The table below shows movements and balances:

Goodwill
Total goodwill in the Consolidated balance sheet at 31 December 2017 was £170 million, with £11 million arising on the acquisition of Haven 
Power in 2009 attributed to the Haven Power CGU and £159 million arising on the acquisition of Opus Energy in the year (see note 5.1)
attributed to the Opus Energy CGU. 
The recoverable amount of the Haven Power and Opus Energy CGUs is measured annually, based on a value-in-use calculation using the 
Group's established planning model. The elements reflected in this calculation are the same as those used for the wider asset impairment 
review conducted by the Group as at 31 December 2017 and are disclosed in note 2.4. Cash flows beyond the business plan period are 
inflated into perpetuity using a growth rate of 1%.
The carrying amount of the Haven Power CGU at 31 December 2017 was £23 million. The expected future cash flows of the CGU were 
discounted using a pre-tax discount rate of 8.1% (calculated based on independent analysis commissioned by the Group, adjusted to the 
speciﬁc circumstances and risk factors affecting the Group's B2B Energy Supply business). We believe that this rate reflects the prospects 
for a well-established B2B Energy Supply business. The value in use of the Haven Power CGU, including the goodwill, was signiﬁcantly in 
excess of its carrying amount.
The carrying amount of the Opus Energy CGU at 31 December 2017 was £366 million, including intangible assets with a net book value of 
£186 million as described in note 5.3. Following the acquisition in 2017, the appropriate discount rate was assessed as being higher for Opus 
Energy than for Haven Power. The expected future cash flows were discounted using a range of discount rates from the Group's central B2B 
Energy Supply assumption (8.1%) to the rate used in the valuation of Opus Energy at the acquisition date (10.7% – see note 5.3). The 
application of discount rates across this range does not result in a recoverable amount for Opus Energy below its carrying amount. 
The Group has conducted a sensitivity analysis of the estimates of future cash flows of each CGU. This analysis indicates that any reasonably 
possible change in the key assumptions, which are customer margins and supply volumes, would not cause an impairment loss in respect of 
goodwill.

SECTION 5: OTHER ASSETS AND LIABILITIES
5.3 INTANGIBLE ASSETS
Intangible assets are not physical in nature but are identiﬁable and separable from other assets. Intangible assets can be acquired in 
business combinations (such as the acquisition of Opus Energy during 2017) or purchased separately. The Group routinely purchases 
computer software and carbon emissions allowances, which are considered intangible assets.
Accounting policy
Intangibles acquired in business combinations are measured at fair value on the acquisition date. Other intangible assets are measured at 
cost. Cost comprises the purchase price (net of any discount or rebate) and any directly attributable costs to bring the asset into the 
condition and location required for use as intended by management.
Intangible assets are amortised over their anticipated useful lives. Useful lives are reviewed at each balance sheet date. No changes to useful 
lives were made as at 31 December 2017. Amortisation calculations are speciﬁc to each category of assets and are explained in further detail 
below. 
Carrying amounts are assessed for indicators of impairment at each balance sheet date. The customer-related assets and brand are 
attributed to the Opus Energy CGU and details of the impairment test relating to this CGU are included in note 5.2. 
Signiﬁcant estimation uncertainty
The valuation of the intangible assets recognised on the acquisition of Opus Energy is dependent upon a number of assumptions. The most 
signiﬁcant of these assumptions are explained under each of the asset headings below.

5.3 INTANGIBLE ASSETS CONTINUED
Customer-related assets
Customer-related assets reflect the value of customer contracts acquired on the acquisition of Opus Energy in February 2017, which 
provided the Group with access to a broad customer base with contracted cash flows. The asset valuation of £211 million reflects the 
estimated acquisition-date value of the future cash flows associated with this customer base and is dependent upon estimates of both 
current and expected future contract margins and assumed customer retention rates. The cash flows have been discounted using a pre-tax 
discount rate of 10.7%. The asset has a useful life of 11 years, calculated based on customer churn-rate analysis, and is being amortised on a 
reducing balance basis to reflect the diminishing rate of contract renewals over time.
Opus Energy brand
The Opus Energy brand was acquired as part of the acquisition in February 2017 and valued at £11 million on a relief-from-royalty method. 
The brand is being amortised on a straight-line basis over its assumed 10 year useful life.
Computer software
In light of continued investment and the increased signiﬁcance of the carrying amount, the Group’s software assets are presented 
separately within intangible assets (2016: included within tangible ﬁxed assets, see note 3.1). Additions in the period include assets acquired 
in the Opus Energy acquisition in addition to those in the ordinary course of business, which principally reflect ongoing investment in 
business systems to support the B2B Energy Supply segment. Software assets are amortised on a straight-line basis over estimated useful 
lives ranging between three and ﬁve years.
Computer software assets in the course of construction of £11.1 million at 31 December 2017 (2016: £nil) were capitalised in the year.
Development assets
The development assets arose on the acquisition of four Open Cycle Gas Turbine projects in December 2016 and reflect the value of planning 
and consents acquired as part of that transaction. Until operations commence, the assets are considered to have an indeﬁnite life and thus 
are not amortised and will be subject to impairment testing at each balance sheet date. 
At 31 December 2017, the recoverable amount of the development assets was established using a value-in-use calculation derived from the 
Group's established planning model, consistent with the approach described in note 2.4. The assessment incorporated assumptions related 
to likely capacity market clearing prices, construction costs, the ongoing revenues to be derived from the projects once constructed and the 
direct costs of generating those revenues. The analysis indicated a recoverable amount for the development assets in excess of their 
carrying amount.
Carbon assets
Carbon assets arise on the purchase of CO2 emissions allowances in excess of the amount allocated under the Emissions Trading Scheme 
and required for the current ﬁnancial year, and are measured at cost, net of any impairment. Given their short tenor, carbon assets are not 
amortised.
The charge to the income statement, within fuel costs, reflects the cost of emissions allowances required to satisfy the obligation for the 
current year and takes into account generation and market purchases allocated to the current ﬁnancial year, and to the extent further 
purchases are required, the market price at the balance sheet date.
Post balance sheet events
The 2021 T-4 capacity market auction closed in February 2018 at a clearing price of £8.40/KW. The Group secured agreements to provide a 
total of 1,217MW of capacity from two existing coal units, worth a total of £10 million for the period October 2021 to September 2022.
Two of the Group’s Open Cycle Gas Turbine (OCGT) projects also participated in the auction but exited above the clearing price. The Group 
will continue to develop these options with an expectation that they will go on to participate in the next T-4 auction. This outcome does not 
change the Group’s view of the recoverable amount of the existing investments in the OCGT projects (see above) or the fair value of the 
contingent consideration that may become payable following future capacity market outcomes (see note 3.6).

SECTION 5: OTHER ASSETS AND LIABILITIES
5.4 PROVISIONS
We make provision for reinstatement to cover the estimated costs of decommissioning and demolishing our generation assets and 
remediating the site at the end of the useful economic lives of the assets. The amount represents the present value of the expected costs.
Accounting policy
Provisions are recognised when the Group has a present obligation (legal or constructive) as a result of a past event, it is probable that the 
Group will be required to settle that obligation and a reliable estimate can be made of the amount of the obligation.
Speciﬁcally, provision is made for the estimated decommissioning costs at the end of the useful economic life of the Group’s generating 
assets, when a legal or constructive obligation arises, on a discounted basis. The amount provided represents the present value of the 
expected costs. In view of the uncertainty of assessing the amount of any proceeds from the disposal of the assets at the decommissioning 
date, no reduction in the provision is made for any such proceeds. The discount rate used is a risk-free pre-tax rate of 1.8% (2016: 1.9%), 
reflecting the fact that the estimated future cash flows have built-in risks speciﬁc to the liability. An amount equivalent to the discounted 
provision is capitalised within property, plant and equipment and is depreciated over the useful lives of the related assets. The unwinding of 
the discount is included in interest payable and similar charges. The balance also includes a small provision in respect of dilapidation 
provisions for leased ofﬁces acquired in the Opus Energy transaction in 2017.

The decommissioning provision is based on the assumption that the decommissioning and reinstatement will take place at the end of the 
expected useful life of the power station in 2039, and has been estimated using existing technology at current prices based on independent 
third-party advice, updated on a triennial basis. The most recent update took place in December 2017.
Post balance sheet events
Subsequent to the year end, on 8 February 2018 the Group announced its intention to close the headquarters of the Pellet Production 
business in Atlanta, Georgia and move these functions to a location closer to the operational sites in Monroe, Louisiana. No amounts have 
been included in respect of this decision in these ﬁnancial statements.

incur a non-cash charge in respect of these schemes in our income statement, which is set out below along with a detailed description of 
each scheme and the number of options outstanding.
Accounting policy
All of the Group’s share-based payments are equity settled. Equity-settled share-based payments are measured at the fair value of the equity 
instrument at the date of grant and are recognised in the income statement on a straight-line basis over the relevant vesting period, based 
on an estimate of the shares that will ultimately vest as a result of the effect of non-market-based vesting conditions, which is revised at each 
balance sheet date.
Costs recognised in the income statement in relation to share-based payments during the year were as follows:

Share Incentive Plan (SIP)
Between 2008 and 2010, qualifying employees could buy up to £1,500 worth of Partnership Shares in any one tax year. Matching shares 
were awarded to employees to match any shares they bought, in a ratio of one-to-one, with the cost of matching shares borne by the Group. 
There have been no awards under the SIP Partnership and Matching Share plan since 2010.

2017 Performance Share Plan (PSP) and Deferred Share Plan (DSP)
In 2017, a new share plan was introduced for directors and senior executives, replacing the Bonus Matching Plan. Under the PSP, annual 
awards of performance and service-related shares are made for no consideration to executive directors and other senior executives up to a 
maximum of 175% of their annual bonus. Vesting of a proportion of shares is conditional upon whether the Group’s Total Shareholder Return 
(TSR) matches or outperforms an index (determined in accordance with the scheme rules) over three years and vesting of a proportion of 
shares is conditional upon performance against the internal balanced corporate scorecard. The fair value of the 2017 PSP awards of 
£2.8 million is being charged to the income statement on a straight-line basis over the three-year vesting period.
The fair value of PSP awards is calculated using a Monte-Carlo valuation model, which takes into account the estimated probability of 
different levels of vesting. The key inputs to the valuation model for the 2017 awards are the share price at the grant date (325 pence), 
expected volatility (44%), and risk-free interest rate (0.13%). 
In addition, the Group operates the DSP, which was introduced in 2017 as a vehicle for deferring 35% of the annual bonus of executive 
directors, which are granted at nil cost and vest after three years subject to continued employment or “good leaver” termination provisions. 
The share price on the grant date of DSP awards made in 2017 was 325 pence and the fair value of these awards of £0.6 million is being 
charged to the income statement on a straight-line basis over the three-year vesting period.

50% of the PSP options granted in 2017 will vest conditional on Group TSR relative to the TSR of a comparator group of companies, with 
the remaining 50% vesting conditional upon the internal balanced corporate scorecard. The share price on the grant date for PSP options 
awarded in the year was 325 pence and the weighted average fair value of the PSP options granted during the year was 177 pence.
All of the PSP options outstanding at the end of the period had an exercise price of £nil. The weighted average remaining contractual life was 
28 months.
The number of options exercisable at the year end was nil.

Bonus Matching Plan (BMP)
Under the BMP, annual awards of performance and service-related shares were made for no consideration to executive directors and other 
senior executives up to a maximum of 150% of their annual bonus up until 2016. The BMP was replaced in 2017 by the PSP. For awards prior 
to 2017, a proportion of the shares vesting under the BMP are conditional upon whether the Group’s Total Shareholder Return (TSR) matches 
or outperforms an index (determined in accordance with the scheme rules) over three years and a proportion of the shares vesting is 
conditional upon performance against the internal balanced corporate scorecard. The fair value of the 2017, 2016 and 2015 BMP awards 
of £0.6 million, £2.6 million and £3.3 million respectively, are being charged to the income statement on a straight-line basis over the 
corresponding three-year vesting periods.
The fair value of BMP awards is calculated using a Monte-Carlo valuation model, which takes into account the estimated probability of 
different levels of vesting. No BMP awards were made in 2017.

The number of options exercisable at the year end was nil (2016: nil).
Savings-Related Share Option Plan (SAYE)
In April 2017, participation in the SAYE plan was offered again to all qualifying employees. Options were granted for employees to acquire 
shares at a price of 280 pence (2016: 203 pence), representing a discount of 20% to the prevailing market price determined in accordance 
with the scheme rules. The options are exercisable at the end of three or ﬁve-year savings contracts. The fair value of the options granted 
in connection with the SAYE plan of £0.9 million (2016: £3.9 million) is being charged to the income statement over the term of the relevant

Expected volatility was determined by calculating the historical volatility of the Group’s share price over the previous three and ﬁve years 
respectively. The expected life used in the model has been adjusted, based on management’s best estimate, for the effects of non-
transferability, exercise restrictions and behavioural considerations.
For the SAYE options exercised during the period, the weighted average share price at the date of exercise was 305 pence (2016: 337 pence).
The weighted average exercise price of SAYE options outstanding at the end of the period was 224 pence (2016: 216 pence). The weighted 
average remaining contractual life was 22 months (2016: 31 months).
The number of options exercisable at the year end was nil (2016: nil).
Additional information in relation to the Group’s share-based incentive plans is included in the Remuneration Committee report.
6.3 RETIREMENT BENEFIT OBLIGATIONS
We operate one deﬁned beneﬁt and four deﬁned contribution pension schemes.
The Drax Power Group (DPG) section of the Electricity Supply Pension Scheme (ESPS) is a deﬁned beneﬁt scheme; a pension arrangement 
under which participating members receive a pension beneﬁt at retirement determined by the scheme rules. Members are typically entitled 
to an annual pension on retirement of 1/80th of ﬁnal pensionable salary for each year of service plus a tax-free lump sum of three times 
pension.
The Drax Group Personal Pension Plan, Haven Power Personal Pension Plan, Opus Energy Group Personal Pension Plan and Drax Biomass 
Inc. 401(K) Plan are deﬁned contribution schemes, which provide a retirement beneﬁt that is dependent upon actual contributions made by 
the Group and members of the relevant scheme.
Accounting policy
Payments to deﬁned contribution schemes are recognised as an expense when employees have rendered services that entitle them to the 
contributions. The income statement charge for the deﬁned contribution scheme represents the contributions due to be paid by the Group 
in respect of the current period.
For the deﬁned beneﬁt pension scheme, the cost of providing beneﬁts is determined using the projected unit credit method, with actuarial 
valuations being carried out at the end of each reporting period. Remeasurement of the obligation, comprising actuarial gains and losses, the 
effect of the asset ceiling (if applicable) and the return on scheme assets (excluding interest), is recognised immediately in the balance sheet 
with a charge or credit to the statement of comprehensive income in the period in which it occurs. Deﬁned beneﬁt costs, including current 
service costs, past service costs and gains and losses on curtailments and settlements are recognised in the income statement as part of 
operating and administrative expenses in the period in which they occur. The net interest expense is recognised in ﬁnance costs.
Signiﬁcant estimation uncertainty
Measurement of the deﬁned beneﬁt obligation using the projected unit credit method involves the use of key assumptions, including 
discount rates, inflation rates, salary and pension increases, and mortality rates. These actuarial assumptions are reviewed annually and 
modiﬁed as appropriate. The Group believes that the assumptions utilised in measuring obligations under the scheme are reasonable based 
on prior experience, market conditions and the advice of scheme actuaries. However, actual results may differ from such assumptions.
The assumptions applied in 2017 have been prepared on a consistent basis with those in the previous period and in accordance with 
independent actuarial advice received.

6.3 RETIREMENT BENEFIT OBLIGATIONS CONTINUED
Deﬁned contribution schemes
The Group operates four deﬁned contribution schemes, the Drax Group Personal Pension Plan, Haven Power Personal Pension Plan, Opus 
Energy Group Personal Pension Plan and Drax Biomass Inc. 401(K) Plan, for all qualifying employees. Pension costs for the deﬁned 
contribution schemes are as follows:

As at 31 December 2017, contributions of £nil (2016: £0.5 million) due in respect of the current reporting period had not been paid over to the 
schemes. The Group has no further payment obligations once the contributions have been paid.
Deﬁned beneﬁt scheme
The DPG section of the ESPS was closed to new members as from 1 January 2002 unless they qualify through being existing members of 
another part of the ESPS. Members who joined before this date continue to build up pension beneﬁts as part of the scheme.
The DPG ESPS exposes the Group to actuarial and other risks, the most signiﬁcant of which are considered to be:
Investment risk
The scheme liabilities are calculated using a discount rate set with reference to corporate bond yields; if assets 
underperform this yield, this will create a deﬁcit. The scheme holds a signiﬁcant proportion of growth assets 
(equities, property and direct lending) which, though expected to outperform corporate bonds in the long term, 
create volatility and risk in the short term. The allocation to growth assets is monitored to ensure it remains 
appropriate given the scheme’s long-term objectives.
Discount rate risk
A decrease in corporate bond yields will increase the value placed upon the scheme’s liabilities, although this will be 
partially offset by an increase in the value of the scheme’s bond holdings.
Longevity risk
The majority of the scheme’s obligations are to provide beneﬁts for the life of the member, so increases in life 
expectancy will result in an increase in the liabilities of the scheme.
Inflation risk
The majority of the scheme’s obligations to pay beneﬁts are linked to inflation, and, as such, higher inflation will lead 
to higher liabilities. The majority of the assets held by the scheme are either unaffected by or only loosely correlated 
with inflation, such that an increase in inflation will also increase the deﬁcit. In most cases, caps on inflationary 
increases are in place to protect against extreme inflation.
Other risks include operational risks (such as paying out the wrong beneﬁts), legislative risks (such as the Government increasing the burden 
on pension schemes through new legislation) and other demographic risks (such as making a higher proportion of members with dependants 
eligible to receive pensions from the Group). The Trustees insure certain beneﬁts payable on death before retirement.
A contingent liability exists in relation to the equalisation of Guaranteed Minimum Pension (GMP). See note 7.5 for details.
The most recent funding valuation of the DPG ESPS was carried out by Aon Hewitt, a qualiﬁed independent actuary, as at 31 March 2016. 
The actuarial review at 31 December 2017 is based on the same membership and other data as this funding valuation. The scheme board 
accepted the advice of the actuary and approved the use of these assumptions for the purpose of assessing the scheme cost. Future 
valuations are required by law at intervals of no more than three years.
The results of the latest funding valuation at 31 March 2016 have been adjusted to the balance sheet date, taking into account experience 
over the period since 31 March 2016, changes in market conditions and differences in ﬁnancial and demographic assumptions. The present 
value of the deﬁned beneﬁt obligation, and the related current service costs were measured using the projected unit credit method. The 
principal assumptions used, which reflect the nature and term of the scheme liabilities, are as follows:

Mortality assumptions are based on recent actual mortality experience of scheme members and allow for expected future improvements 
in mortality rates. The assumptions are that a member aged 60 in 2017 will live, on average, for a further 26 years if they are male 
(2016: 27 years) and for a further 29 years if they are female (2016: 29 years). Life expectancy at age 60 for male and female non-pensioners 
currently aged 45 is assumed to be 27 and 30 years respectively (2016: 28 and 31 years respectively).

The actuarial gains of £4.8 million (2016: £58.8 million losses) reflect losses of £4.5 million arising from changes in ﬁnancial assumptions

experience of £3.8 million (2016: gains of £1.9 million and £10.7 million respectively).
The losses due to changes in ﬁnancial assumptions principally reflect the increase in the present value of the scheme liabilities arising as a 
result of the change in discount rate assumption to 2.60% (2016: 2.75%) following reductions in corporate bond yields.

Notes:
(1) At 31 December 2017 the scheme’s long-term asset strategy was: global equity (20%), direct lending (10%), emerging market equity (5%), fixed interest bonds (15%), corporate bonds (6%), liability driven 
investing (29%) and long lease property (15%)
(2) Fixed interest bonds include a mixture of corporate, Government and absolute return bonds. Approximately 10% of the bonds have a sub-investment grade credit rating (i.e. BB+ or lower)
(3) Other assets include £19.0 million of investments in direct lending, a type of private equity vehicle, which is not quoted in an active market (2016: £17.9 million)
The pension plan assets do not include any ordinary shares issued by Drax Group plc or any property occupied by the Group.
The Group employs a building block approach in determining the long-term rate of return on pension plan assets. Historical markets are 
studied and assets with higher volatility are assumed to generate higher returns consistent with widely accepted capital market principles. 
The overall expected rate of return on assets is then derived by aggregating the expected return for each asset class relative to the actual 
asset allocation for the scheme.
The assumptions for discount rate, inflation rate, rate of increase in pensions paid and expected return on plan assets all have a potentially 
signiﬁcant effect on the measurement of the scheme deﬁcit. The following table provides an indication of the sensitivity of the pension 
deﬁcit at 31 December 2017 to changes in these assumptions:

is estimated that the beneﬁts will not be met from regular contributions and expected investment income.

The deﬁned beneﬁt obligation includes beneﬁts for current employees of the Group (60%), former employees of the Group who are yet to 
retire (5%) and retired pensioners (35%). The weighted-average period over which beneﬁt payments are expected to be made, or the duration 
of the scheme liabilities, was assessed at the 31 March 2016 funding valuation to be 21 years.
Future contributions
The Group expects to make regular contributions, in respect of service costs, of £10.8 million to the deﬁned beneﬁt pension plan during the 
12 months ended 31 December 2018.
In addition to regular contributions, deﬁcit contributions have been agreed with the Trustees based upon the Technical Provisions as at the 
31 March 2016 valuation. The Technical Provisions indicate a deﬁcit of £64 million including an estimate of the impact of future service costs, 
which do not meet the deﬁnition of a liability at 31 December 2017 for inclusion in the ﬁnancial statements. This valuation has not changed 
materially between the 31 March 2016 valuation date and 31 December 2017.
The Group has agreed to make additional contributions over the period to 31 December 2025 to eliminate the deﬁcit. At this point the 
scheme is expected to be self-sufﬁcient, unless material adverse changes in economic conditions arise compared to those assumed in the 
valuation. The Group is conﬁdent that the additional contributions are manageable within the Group's business plan. The terms of the Trust 
Deed allow the Group to recover any surplus once the liabilities of the scheme have been settled, accordingly the deﬁcit contributions will 
not give rise to an unrecognised surplus.

SECTION 7 
Risk management
This section provides disclosures around ﬁnancial risk management, including the ﬁnancial instruments we use to mitigate such risks.
7.1 FINANCIAL RISK MANAGEMENT
The Group’s activities expose it to a variety of ﬁnancial risks, including commodity price risk, interest rate risk, foreign currency risk, liquidity 
risk, counterparty risk and credit risk. The Group’s overall risk management programme focuses on the unpredictability of commodity and 
ﬁnancial markets and seeks to manage potential adverse effects on the Group’s ﬁnancial performance.
The Group uses derivative ﬁnancial instruments to hedge certain risk exposures. Risk management is carried out by the risk management 
committees as explained in principal risks and uncertainties (page 51) which identify, evaluate and hedge ﬁnancial risks in close coordination 
with the Group’s trading function under policies approved by the Board of directors.
Commodity price risk
The Group is exposed to the effect of fluctuations in commodity prices, particularly the price of electricity, the price of coal, sustainable 
wood ﬁbre and pellets and other fuels, and the price of CO2 emissions allowances. Price variations and market cycles have historically 
influenced the ﬁnancial results of the Group and are expected to continue to do so.
The Group has a policy of securing forward power sales, purchases of fuel and CO2 emissions allowances when proﬁtable to do so. All 
commitments to sell power under ﬁxed price contracts are designated as cash flow hedges as they reduce the Group’s cash flow exposure 
resulting from fluctuations in the price of electricity.
The Group purchases coal, sustainable biomass and other fuels under either ﬁxed or variable priced contracts with different maturities from 
a variety of domestic and international sources. All international physical coal purchase contracts transacted at a ﬁxed price, and ﬁnancial 
coal contracts exchanging floating price coal for ﬁxed price amounts, are designated as cash flow hedges as they reduce the Group’s cash 
flow exposure resulting from fluctuations in the price of coal.
The Group purchases CO2 emissions allowances under ﬁxed price contracts with different maturity dates from a range of domestic and 
international sources. All commitments to purchase CO2 emissions allowances under ﬁxed price contracts are designated as cash flow 
hedges as they reduce the Group’s cash flow exposure resulting from fluctuations in the price of CO2 emissions allowances.
Commodity price sensitivity
The sensitivity analysis below has been determined based on the exposure to commodity prices for outstanding monetary items at the 
balance sheet date. The analysis is based on the Group’s commodity ﬁnancial instruments held at each balance sheet date.
If commodity prices had been 5% higher/lower and all other variables were held constant, the Group’s:
 – loss after tax for the year ended 31 December 2017 would decrease/increase by £1.5 million (2016: proﬁt after tax would increase/decrease 
by £3.4 million). This is mainly attributable to the Group’s exposure to oil derivatives; and 
 – the hedge reserve would increase/decrease by £5.6 million (2016: increase/decrease by £36.3 million) mainly as a result of the changes in 
the fair value of ﬁnancial coal and power derivatives. 
Interest rate risk
The Group is exposed to interest rate risk, principally in relation to its net debt to the extent arising from floating rate debt instruments. 
Historically, the Group has sought to mitigate this risk with interest rate hedges on a proportion of its debt facilities. The Group has no 
interest rate swaps outstanding at the balance sheet date; however, this risk management tool remains available to the Group. Information 
about the Group’s instruments that are exposed to interest rate risk and their repayment schedules is provided below.
Interest rate sensitivity
The sensitivity analysis below has been determined based on the exposure to interest rates for non-derivative instruments at the balance 
sheet date. For floating rate liabilities, the analysis is prepared assuming the amount of the liability outstanding at the balance sheet date 
was outstanding for the whole year.
If interest rates had been 1% higher/lower and all other variables were held constant, the Group’s loss after tax and net assets for the year 
ended 31 December 2017 would decrease/increase by £2.2 million (2016: proﬁt after tax would decrease/increase by £1.8 million) as a result 
of the changes in interest payable during the period.
Foreign currency risk
Forward foreign currency exchange contracts are entered into principally in order to hedge purchases of fuel for use in the Power 
Generation business. These purchases are typically denominated in US Dollars, Canadian Dollars or Euros.
Exchange rate exposures are managed within approved policy parameters utilising a variety of foreign currency exchange contracts. The 
Group enters into both forward currency purchase and currency option contracts to manage its anticipated foreign currency requirements 
over a rolling ﬁve-year period for both contracted and forecast transactions.

7.1 FINANCIAL RISK MANAGEMENT CONTINUED
Foreign currency sensitivity
If Sterling exchange rates had been 5% stronger/weaker against other currencies and all other variables were held constant, the Group’s:
 – loss after tax for the year ended 31 December 2017 would increase/decrease by £351.1 million/£285.5 million (2016: proﬁt after tax would 
decrease/increase by £252.6 million/£277.7 million). This is mainly attributable to the Group’s exposure to foreign currency exchange 
contracts entered in relation to fuel purchase contracts; and 
 – other equity reserves would decrease/increase by £111.1 million/£122.8 million (2016: decrease/increase by £78.7 million/£87 million) as a 
result of the changes in the fair value of foreign currency exchange contracts. 
Liquidity risk
The treasury function is responsible for liquidity, funding and settlement management under policies approved by the Board of directors. 
Liquidity needs are monitored using regular forecasting of operational cash flows and ﬁnancing commitments. The Group maintains a 
mixture of cash and cash equivalents, and committed facilities in order to ensure sufﬁcient funding for business requirements.
The following tables set out details of the expected contractual maturity of non-derivative ﬁnancial liabilities. The tables include both 
interest and principal cash flows. To the extent that interest flows are floating rate, the undiscounted amount is derived from interest rate 
curves at the balance sheet date.

7.1 FINANCIAL RISK MANAGEMENT CONTINUED
In managing liquidity risk, the Group has access to facilities that enable it to accelerate the cash flows associated with certain of its 
receivables (principally those related to ROC sales and retail power sales). Each of these facilities is provided on a non-recourse basis and 
accordingly receivables sold under each facility are derecognised from the balance sheet at the point of sale. The impact on the Group’s cash 
flows is detailed in note 4.4.
Counterparty risk
As the Group relies on third party suppliers for the delivery of currency, coal, sustainable compressed wood pellets and other goods and 
services, it is exposed to the risk of non-performance by these third party suppliers. If a large supplier were to fall into ﬁnancial difﬁculty and/
or fail to deliver against its contract with the Group, there would be additional costs associated with securing the lost goods or services from 
other suppliers.
The Group enters into contracts for the sale of electricity to a number of counterparties. The failure of one or more of these counterparties 
to perform their contractual obligations may cause the Group ﬁnancial distress or increase the risk proﬁle of the Group.
Credit risk
The Group’s exposure to credit risk is limited to the carrying amount of ﬁnancial assets recognised at the balance sheet date, as summarised 
below:

Trade and other receivables are stated gross of the provision for doubtful debts of £28.2 million (2016: £4.0 million).
Credit exposure is controlled by counterparty limits that are reviewed and approved by risk management committees. Where considered 
appropriate, counterparties are required to provide credit support in the form of a parent company guarantee, letter of credit, deed of charge, 
or cash collateral. In addition, where deemed appropriate, the Group has historically purchased credit default swaps.
The investment of surplus cash is undertaken to maximise the return within Board-approved policies. These policies manage credit risk 
exposure by setting out minimum rating requirements, maximum investment with any one counterparty and the maturity proﬁle.
Capital management
The Group manages its capital to ensure it is able to continue as a going concern, and maintain its credit rating while maximising the return 
to shareholders through the optimisation of the debt and equity balance. The capital structure of the Group consists of shareholders’ equity 
(excluding the hedge reserve), plus net debt. Net debt is comprised of borrowings disclosed in note 4.3 and cash and cash equivalents in 
note 4.2.

7.2 DERIVATIVE FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS
We enter into forward contracts for the purchase and sale of physical commodities (principally power, gas, coal, sustainable biomass and CO2 
emissions allowances) to secure market level bark and dark green spreads on future electricity sales, and also ﬁnancial forward and option 
contracts (principally currency exchange contracts and ﬁnancial coal and oil derivatives) to ﬁx Sterling cash flows.
We hold these contracts for risk management purposes, to manage key risks facing the business, including commodity price risk and foreign 
currency risk (see note 7.1).
A successful commercial hedging strategy is critical to our business model. Our policy is to ﬁx exposures to commodity price movements 
and changes in foreign exchange rates using derivative contracts such as those described above. This strategy aims to de-risk the business, 
providing security and certainty over cash flows into the future. As at 31 December 2017, due to the strengthening of Sterling against the 
US Dollar, the fair value of our forward derivative contracts, consisting largely of forward contracts for the purchase of foreign currencies 
(principally for the purpose of ﬁxing the Sterling cost of sustainable compressed wood pellet purchases), decreased to £160.0 million 
(2016: £527.8 million). The strengthening in Sterling during 2017 partially reversed the signiﬁcant mark to market gains posted during 2016 
as its value fell following the Brexit vote.
Accounting policy
At the balance sheet date all contracts (subject to certain exemptions described below) must be measured at fair value, which is in essence 
the difference between the price we have secured in the contract, and the price we could achieve in the market at that point in time.
Changes in fair value are recognised either within the income statement or the hedge reserve, dependent upon whether the contract in 
question qualiﬁes as an effective hedge under IFRS (see note 7.4).
Where possible, the Group has taken advantage of the own-use exemption which allows qualifying contracts to be excluded from fair value 
mark-to-market accounting. This applies to certain contracts for physical commodities entered into and held for our own purchase, sale or 
usage requirements, including forward contracts for the purchase of biomass, and coal from domestic sources.
Contracts which do not qualify for the own-use exemption – principally power, gas, ﬁnancial oil, ﬁnancial coal, CO2 emissions allowances and 
forward foreign currency exchange contracts – are accounted for as derivatives in accordance with IAS 39 and are recorded in the balance 
sheet at fair value, with changes in fair value reflected through the hedge reserve (note 7.4) to the extent that the contracts are designated 
as effective hedges in accordance with IAS 39, or the income statement where the hedge accounting requirements are not met. The Group 
enters into forward contracts solely for the purpose of ﬁnancial risk management and considers all of its contracts to be economic hedges, 
regardless of whether the speciﬁc criteria for hedge accounting are met.
Derivative ﬁnancial instruments with a maturity date within 12 months from the balance sheet date are classiﬁed as current assets or 
liabilities. Instruments with a maturity date beyond 12 months are classiﬁed as non-current assets or liabilities.
The location in the consolidated ﬁnancial statements of the changes in fair value of derivative contracts in 2017 is summarised in the table

7.2 DERIVATIVE FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS CONTINUED
Signiﬁcant estimation uncertainty
The fair values of derivative instruments for commodities and foreign currency exchange contracts are determined using forward price 
curves. Forward price curves represent the Group’s estimates of the prices at which a buyer or seller could contract today for delivery or 
settlement of a commodity or foreign exchange payment or receipt, at future dates. The Group generally bases forward price curves upon 
readily obtainable market price quotations, as the Group’s commodity and forward foreign exchange contracts do not generally extend 
beyond the actively traded portion of these curves. However, the forward price curves used are only an estimate of how future prices will 
move and are, therefore, subjective. Where derivative ﬁnancial instruments include options these are valued using an option pricing model. 
Inputs to the model include market commodity prices, forward price curves, the term of the option, discount rate and assumptions around 
volatility based on historical movements. The inputs include assumptions around future transactions and market movements, as well as 
credit risk and are, therefore, subjective.
Fair value accounting
Forward contracts for the sale of power, purchase of coal from international sources, purchase of CO2 emissions allowances, ﬁnancial coal, 
ﬁnancial oil, gas (collectively “Commodity contracts”) and foreign currency exchange contracts are recorded in the balance sheet at fair 
value as follows:

7.2 DERIVATIVE FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS CONTINUED
A material proportion of these contracts are not designated in hedge accounting relationships under IAS 39 and thus the gains on these 
contracts were recognised in the income statement.
Unrealised losses recognised in the hedge reserve principally reflect losses on the portion of our forward currency exchange contracts that 
are designated in effective hedge relationships in accordance with IAS 39.
Fair value measurement
 – Commodity contracts fair value – The fair value of open commodity contracts that do not qualify for the own-use exemption is calculated 
by reference to forward market prices at the balance sheet date. As contracts are generally short-term, forward market price curves are 
available for the duration of the contracts. The quoted market price used for ﬁnancial assets held by the Group is the current bid price; the 
quoted price for ﬁnancial liabilities is the current ask price. 
 – Forward foreign currency exchange contracts fair value – The fair value of forward foreign currency exchange contracts is determined 
using forward currency exchange market rates at the balance sheet date. 
 – Other ﬁnancial contracts fair value – The fair value of other ﬁnancial contracts that do not qualify for the own-use exemption, is 
calculated by reference to forward market prices at the balance sheet date. As contracts are generally short-term, forward market price 
curves are available for the duration of the contracts. 
The fair values of all derivative ﬁnancial instruments are discounted to reflect the credit risk inherent within the instrument.
The Group has reviewed all signiﬁcant contracts for the presence of embedded derivatives. Where contracts were found to contain 
embedded derivatives, they were considered to be closely related to the economic characteristics and risks of the host contract, and 
therefore do not require separate valuation from their host contracts.
We are required by IFRS to categorise our ﬁnancial instruments in accordance with the following hierarchy in order to explain the basis on 
which their fair values have been determined:
 – Level 1 – fair value measurements are those derived from quoted prices (unadjusted) in active markets for identical assets or liabilities;
 – Level 2 – fair value measurements are those derived from inputs, other than quoted prices included within Level 1, that are observable for 
the asset or liability, either directly (i.e. as prices) or indirectly (i.e. derived from prices); and
 – Level 3 – fair value measurements are those derived from valuation techniques that include inputs for the asset or liability that are not 
based on observable market data (unobservable inputs).
Categorisation within this fair value measurement hierarchy has been determined on the basis of the lowest level input that is signiﬁcant to 
the fair value measurement of the relevant asset or liability.
The fair value of commodity contracts, forward foreign currency exchange contracts and the contingent consideration in the Open Cycle 
Gas Turbine sites acquisition (see note 3.6) are largely determined by comparison between forward market prices and the contract price; 
therefore these contracts are categorised as Level 2.
There have been no transfers during the year between Level 1, 2 or 3 category inputs.
7.3 OTHER FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS
We hold a variety of other non-derivative ﬁnancial instruments, including cash and cash equivalents, borrowings, payables and receivables 
arising from our operations.
Accounting policy
Cash and cash equivalents (note 4.2), trade and other receivables (note 3.5), and trade and other payables (note 3.6) generally have a short 
time in which to mature. For this reason their carrying values, on the historical cost basis, approximate to their fair value. The Group’s 
borrowings are set out in detail in note 4.3.
SECTION 7: RISK MANAGEMENT
Drax Group plc Annual report and accounts 2017

7.4 HEDGE RESERVE
Changes in the fair value of our derivative commodity, ﬁnancial and currency contracts are recognised in the hedge reserve, to the extent 
that they qualify as effective hedges under accounting rules. The cumulative gains and losses unwind and are released as the related 
contracts mature and we take delivery of the associated commodity or currency.
As described in note 7.2, all of our derivative contracts are entered into for the purpose of commercial hedging; however, not all of these 
contracts qualify as effective hedges under IAS 39. The changes in fair value of contracts that do not meet the deﬁnition of an IFRS effective 
hedge are recognised in the income statement. Managing our principal risks and uncertainties is about locking down exposures to moving 
prices and securing market level dark green and bark spreads for the future.
The Group designates certain hedging instruments used to address commodity price risk and foreign exchange risk as cash flow hedges. 
At the inception of the hedge, the relationship between the hedging instrument and hedged item is documented, along with its risk 
management objectives. Furthermore, at the inception of the hedge and on an ongoing basis, the Group documents whether the hedging 
instruments used in hedging transactions are highly effective in offsetting changes in cash flows of hedged items. Changes in fair value of 
contracts designated into such hedging relationships are recognised within the hedge reserve to the extent they are effective.

The Group’s cash flow hedges relate to commodity contracts (principally commitments to sell power) and forward foreign currency 
exchange contracts. Amounts are recognised in the hedge reserve as the designated contracts are marked to market at each period end 
for the effective portion of the hedge, which is generally 100% of the relevant contract. Amounts held within the hedge reserve are then 
released as the related contract matures and the hedged transaction impacts proﬁt or loss. For power sales contracts, this is when the 
underlying power is delivered. For currency contracts, this is when the associated foreign currency transaction is recognised. Further 
information about the Group’s accounting for ﬁnancial instruments is included in note 7.2.
No ineffectiveness was recognised in the income statement in the year (2016: £6.4 million).

7.5 CONTINGENT LIABILITIES
Contingent liabilities are potential future outflows of cash that are dependent on a future event that is outside of our control. The amount 
and timing of any payment is uncertain and cannot be measured reliably.
Guaranteed Minimum Pension (GMP)
The UK Government intends to implement legislation to equalise the GMP, resulting in an increase in the value of GMP for males. This would 
correspondingly increase the deﬁned beneﬁt pension obligation of the Group (note 6.3). At present, the methodology for implementing the 
equalisation is uncertain and thus the impact cannot be reliably measured. As a result, no allowance has been made for GMP equalisation in 
the calculation of the deﬁned beneﬁt obligation within these consolidated ﬁnancial statements.
Guarantees
In addition to the amount drawn down against the bank loans, certain members of the Group guarantee the obligations of a number of banks 
in respect of letters of credit issued by those banks to counterparties of the Group. As at 31 December 2017, the Group’s contingent liability in 
respect of letters of credit issued under the revolving credit facility amounted to £35.7 million (2016: £57.9 million). 
The Group also guarantees obligations in the form of surety bonds with a number of insurers amounting to £41.3 million (2016: £nil).
7.6 COMMITMENTS
We have a number of ﬁnancial commitments (i.e. a contractual requirement to make a cash payment in the future) that are not recorded in 
our balance sheet as the contract is not yet due for delivery. Such commitments include contracts for the future purchase of coal and 
biomass, operating leases for land and buildings, contracts for the construction of assets and contracts for the provision of services.

these contracts relate to the purchase of wood pellets, they are not reflected elsewhere in our ﬁnancial statements owing to application of

SECTION 8
Reference information
This section details reference information relevant to the accounts. Here we describe the general information about the Group 
(e.g. operations and registered ofﬁce). We also set out the basis of preparation of the accounts and general accounting policies that are not 
speciﬁc to any one note.
8.1 GENERAL INFORMATION
Drax Group plc (the Company) is incorporated in England and Wales under the Companies Act. The Company and its subsidiaries (together, 
the Group) have three principal activities:
 –  electricity generation;
 –  electricity supply to business customers; and
 –  manufacturing of sustainable compressed wood pellets for use in electricity production.
The Group’s activities are principally based within the UK, with the wood pellet manufacturing activities situated in the US. 
The address of the Company’s registered ofﬁce and principal establishment is Drax Power Station, Selby, North Yorkshire, YO8 8PH, United 
Kingdom. A full list of operating companies of the Group is disclosed in note 5 to the Company’s separate ﬁnancial statements, which follow 
these consolidated ﬁnancial statements.
8.2 BASIS OF PREPARATION
Adoption of new and revised accounting standards
A number of new and amended standards became effective for the ﬁrst time in 2017. The Group adopted the following from 1 January 2017:
IAS 12 (amended) – Income Taxes – effective for annual reporting periods beginning on or after 1 January 2017.
IAS 7 (amended) – Statement of Cash Flows – effective for annual periods beginning on or after 1 January 2017.
The adoption of these updates and amendments has not had a material impact on the ﬁnancial statements of the Group.
At the date of authorisation of these ﬁnancial statements, the following new or amended standards and relevant interpretations, which have 
not been applied in these ﬁnancial statements, were in issue but not yet effective (and some of which were pending endorsement by the EU 
– marked by *):
IFRS 2 – Classiﬁcation and Measurement of Share-based Payment Transactions – effective for annual periods beginning on or after 
1 January 2018.
IFRS 9 – Financial Instruments – effective for annual reporting periods beginning on or after 1 January 2018.
IFRS 15 (including clariﬁcations issued on 12 April 2016) – Revenue from Contracts with Customers – effective for annual reporting periods 
beginning on or after 1 January 2018.
IAS 40 (amended) – Investment Property – effective for annual reporting periods beginning on or after 1 January 2018.*
IFRIC 22 – Foreign Currency Transactions and Advance Consideration – effective for annual reporting periods beginning on or after 
1 January 2018.*
IFRIC 23 – Uncertainty over Income Tax Treatments – effective for annual reports beginning on or after 1 January 2019.*
IFRS 16 (amended) – Leases – effective for annual reporting periods beginning on or after 1 January 2019.
IFRS 10 (amended) – Consolidated Financial Statements and IAS 28 (amended) – Investments in Associates and Joint Ventures (2011) – 
effective date deferred indeﬁnitely.*
Adoption of the other standards in future periods is not expected to have a material impact on the ﬁnancial statements of the Group, other 
than the three standards noted below.
IFRS 9 – Financial Instruments 
The Group adopted IFRS 9 with effect from 1 January 2018. IFRS 9 addresses the classiﬁcation, measurement and derecognition of ﬁnancial 
assets and ﬁnancial liabilities, introduces new rules for hedge accounting and a new impairment model for ﬁnancial assets, replacing the 
previous requirements of IAS 39.
The Group's current accounting for ﬁnancial instruments is set out in further detail in note 7.2.

8.2 BASIS OF PREPARATION CONTINUED
The Group does not expect the new requirements to have a signiﬁcant impact on the classiﬁcation and measurement of its ﬁnancial assets 
or ﬁnancial liabilities.
The new hedge accounting rules will align the accounting for hedging instruments more closely with the Group's risk management 
practices. The Group's existing hedge relationships will continue to qualify as hedges. No new hedge relationships have been designated as 
at 1 January 2018; however, we anticipate opportunities to designate additional contracts into hedge relationships in future, potentially 
reducing income statement volatility from fair value movements on such contracts.
IFRS 9 allows a policy choice to designate the fair value movements relating to forward basis points and the time value of money of options 
as a "cost of hedging" and recognise these movements as a component of other comprehensive income (OCI). The Group intends to adopt 
this policy. Currently these values are recognised in the unrealised gains/losses on derivative contracts line in the income statement. Had 
this policy been in place during the year ended 31 December 2017, the impact would have been to reduce the loss before tax by approximately 
£32 million and the loss after tax by approximately £26 million, with an identical post-tax expense recognised in other comprehensive 
income. There is no impact on the balance sheet valuation of derivative contracts.
As unrealised gains and losses on derivative contracts are currently recognised in the income statement below EBITDA and are excluded 
from underlying earnings (see note 2.7), the changes described above will have no impact on EBITDA or underlying earnings.
The new impairment model requires the measurement of impairment provisions to be based on expected credit losses, rather than incurred 
credit losses as is the case under IAS 39. We expect this to impact the Group's calculation of impairment provisions in respect of trade 
receivable balances. We estimate that such impairment provisions will increase modestly as a result (less than £1 million) with a one-off 
corresponding reduction in EBITDA and underlying earnings in 2018.
The new standard also introduces additional disclosure requirements in respect of ﬁnancial instruments. We anticipate an increase in the 
level of ﬁnancial instrument disclosure, particularly in the year ended 31 December 2018 following the adoption of the new standard.
IFRS 15 – Revenue from Customer Contracts 
The Group has completed an impact assessment for the adoption of IFRS 15. The standard has been adopted from 1 January 2018.
IFRS 15 introduces a ﬁve-step model for determining the recognition and measurement of revenue, which is more in-depth and provides 
additional guidance compared to the previous revenue standard. The Group's main sources of revenue and existing revenue recognition 
policies are described in more detail in note 2.2. 
Having assessed the Group's material contracts against the new model, a signiﬁcant change to the quantum and timing of the recognition of 
revenue and proﬁts is considered unlikely. The review has included the sources of revenue referred to in note 2.2.
IFRS 15 introduces a number of areas of judgement into the revenue recognition process. In determining that no signiﬁcant change is 
anticipated, the most critical areas of judgement relate to the B2B Energy Supply businesses. Our assessment has considered the 
identiﬁcation of performance obligations within the customer contracts, the assessment of when each performance obligation is satisﬁed 
and the treatment of variable consideration. In all three of these areas, the current policies have been assessed and we have concluded that 
they are in line with the new requirements.
In the Group's other businesses, the signiﬁcant contracts are not complex, being characterised by a single performance obligation that is 
satisﬁed at a point in time with a ﬁxed consideration. Therefore, we have concluded that there will be no impact on transition to IFRS 15.
IFRS 16 – Leases 
IFRS 16 introduces a new model for accounting for leases. The principal change compared to the current standard is to bring leases 
previously classiﬁed as operating leases onto the balance sheet, subject to exemptions and exceptions for short-term and low-value leases.
This will result in an increase in assets, lease liabilities, depreciation and ﬁnance charges, and a reduction in operating expenditure, when 
compared to previous periods.
At 31 December 2017, the Group has non-cancellable operating lease commitments of £43.5 million (see note 7.6).
The Group intends to undertake a comprehensive review, prior to the effective date, to quantify the above effects. This review will also 
consider whether certain contracts currently not classiﬁed as leases meet the deﬁnition of a lease under IFRS 16.
The Group intends to adopt IFRS 16 in the ﬁrst period it becomes mandatory, which commences on 1 January 2019.

Notes to the Company financial statements
1. BASIS OF PREPARATION
The separate ﬁnancial statements of the Company are presented as required by the Companies Act 2006.
The Company meets the deﬁnition of a qualifying entity under Financial Reporting Standard 100 (FRS 100) issued by the Financial Reporting 
Council (FRC).
The ﬁnancial statements have been prepared in accordance with FRS 101 (incorporating the amendments to FRS 101 issued by the FRC in 
July 2015 and July 2016 and the amendments to company law made by the Companies, Partnerships and Groups (Accounts and Reports) 
Regulations 2015).
As permitted by FRS 101, the Company has taken advantage of the disclosure exemptions available under that standard in relation to 
presentation of a cash flow statement, ﬁnancial instruments, share-based payments, capital risk management, standards not yet effective 
and certain related party transactions. Where required, equivalent disclosures are given in the consolidated ﬁnancial statements.
The ﬁnancial statements have been prepared under the historical cost convention. The principal accounting policies adopted are 
summarised below, and have been consistently applied to both years presented.
2. SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES
(A) Fixed asset investments
Fixed asset investments in subsidiaries are stated at cost less, where relevant, provision for impairment.
(B) Financial instruments
Issued equity – Ordinary shares are classiﬁed as equity as evidenced by their residual interest in the assets of the Company after deducting 
all of its liabilities. Incremental costs directly attributable to the issue of new shares or options are shown in equity as a deduction, net of tax, 
from the proceeds. The share premium account records amounts by which the proceeds from issuing shares exceeds the nominal value of 
the shares issued unless merger relief criteria within the Companies Act 2006 are met, in which case the difference is recorded in retained 
earnings.
Cash and cash equivalents – Cash and cash equivalents includes cash in hand, deposits held at call with banks, other short-term highly liquid 
investments with original maturities of three months or less, and bank overdrafts.
3. CRITICAL ACCOUNTING JUDGEMENTS
(A) Critical judgements in applying the Company’s accounting policies
The critical accounting judgements, to the extent they apply to the Company, are consistent with those of the Group described on page 119.
(B) Impairment of ﬁxed asset investments
Determining whether the Company’s investments in subsidiaries have been impaired requires estimates of the investment’s values in use. 
The methodology for calculation of value in use is consistent with that of the Group, as described in note 2.4.
4. PROFIT AND LOSS ACCOUNT
As permitted by Section 408 of the Companies Act 2006, the Company has elected not to present its own proﬁt and loss account for the 
year. The Company’s proﬁt and loss account was approved by the Board on 27 February 2018. The proﬁt attributable to the Company is 
disclosed in the statement of changes in equity.
The Company received dividend income from its subsidiary undertakings totalling £19.9 million in 2017 (2016: £14.7 million).
The Company has no employees other than the directors, whose remuneration was paid by a subsidiary undertaking and a proportion was 
recharged to the Company.
The auditor’s remuneration for audit services provided to the Company for the year ended 31 December 2017 was £20,500 (2016: £20,000).

7. DISTRIBUTABLE RESERVES
Note 8 sets out the proposed ﬁnal dividend of £30 million in respect of 2017.
The Company considers its distributable reserves to be comprised of the proﬁt and loss account with a total value of £229.8 million. 
Accordingly, the Company considers itself to have sufﬁcient distributable proﬁts from which to pay the current year ﬁnal dividend. Based on 
a total dividend for 2017 of £50 million, the Company has sufﬁcient distributable reserves to pay four years of dividend at the current level 
without generating further distributable proﬁts. In addition to its own reserves, the Company has access to the distributable reserves of its 
subsidiary undertakings with which future dividend payments can be funded (see note 2.10 to the consolidated accounts for additional 
information).
The Company is dependent upon its subsidiaries for the provision of cash with which to make dividend payments. As shown in note 4.2 to 
the consolidated ﬁnancial statements, the Group has sufﬁcient cash resources with which to meet the proposed dividend.

a ﬁnal dividend for the year ended 31 December 2017 of 7.4 pence per share (equivalent to approximately £30 million) payable on or before 
11 May 2018. The ﬁnal dividend has not been included as a liability as at 31 December 2017.
9. CONTINGENT LIABILITIES
The Company has provided unsecured guarantees to third parties in respect of contracts held by a subsidiary company. The guarantees have 
been issued for £nil consideration and the Company has not charged the subsidiary for the guarantees.
The Company has granted a charge over the assets of certain of its subsidiaries, in respect of the Group’s debt (detailed in note 4.3 to the 
consolidated ﬁnancial statements), which is guaranteed and secured directly by each of the subsidiary undertakings of the Company that is 
party to the security arrangement. The Company itself is not a guarantor of the Group’s debt.

Once registered with Shareview you are able to:
 – elect how Drax communicates with you;
 – amend some of your personal details; 
 – amend the way you receive dividends; and
 – buy or sell shares online. 
Registering for electronic communications does not mean that you 
can no longer receive paper copies of documents. We are able to 
offer a range of services and tailor the communications to meet 
your needs.
A range of frequently asked shareholder questions can also be found 
on our website at www.drax.com/investors/faq.
TAX ON DIVIDENDS
In the 2015 Budget, the Chancellor announced changes in the way 
that dividends would be taxed in the future. Below is a brief summary 
of the guidance provided by HMRC. If you are in any doubt as to the 
impact on your personal circumstances, you are recommended to 
seek your own ﬁnancial advice from a professional adviser 
authorised under the Financial Services and Markets Act 2000.
The long-standing system of tax credits attached to dividends was 
replaced with a new tax-free Dividend Allowance. This means that 
there is no tax to pay on the ﬁrst £5,000 of dividend income, no 
matter what non-dividend income a shareholder may have. 
Dividends paid on shares held within pensions and ISAs will be 
unaffected, remaining tax-free.
Non-taxpayers and basic rate taxpayers who receive dividend 
income between £5,001 and £10,000 will need to make a declaration 
(to HMRC) for the ﬁrst time. Individuals with dividend income of more 
than £10,000 are already required to be in HMRC’s Self-Assessment 
regime. The impact on Share Incentive Plan participants receiving 
cash dividends on their plan shares align with those for Shareholders. 
Further information and updates on tax on dividends can be found 
on the HMRC website at www.gov.uk/tax-on-dividends/overview.
As the Dividend Tax Credit will no longer be required it is expected 
that a dividend conﬁrmation will still need to be sent to shareholders 
to replace the old “tax voucher”. The Company is currently 
considering whether to move to the practice of issuing just one 
dividend conﬁrmation document towards the end of the tax year, 
irrespective of the number of cash payments made during the 
course of the year, rather than issuing a document each time a 
dividend is paid. Shareholders will be advised of the outcome in 
due course.
BENEFICIAL OWNERS AND “INFORMATION RIGHTS”
If your shares are registered in the name of a third party (i.e. an ISA 
provider or other nominee company) you may, if you wish, receive 
information rights under Section 146 of the Companies Act 2006. 
In order for this to happen, you must contact the third party 
registered holder, who will then nominate you. All communications 
by beneﬁcial owners of shares where the shares are held by third 
party registered holders must be directed to that registered holder 
and not to Drax or Equiniti.
SHAREGIFT
ShareGift (registered charity No. 1052686) is an independent charity 
which provides a free service for shareholders wishing to dispose 
charitably of small parcels of shares, which would most likely cost 
more to sell than they are worth. There are no capital gains tax 
implications (i.e. no gain or loss) on gifts of shares to charity and it is 
possible to obtain income tax relief. Further information can be 
obtained directly from the charity at www.sharegift.org.
SHARE FRAUDS (“BOILER ROOM SCAMS”)
In recent years, many companies have become aware that their 
shareholders have received unsolicited phone calls or 
correspondence offering to purchase their shares at apparently 
inflated prices. It is often the case that the caller, or message in the 
correspondence claims that they represent a majority shareholder 
who is looking to take over the Company. At the time of this report, 
the Company was not the subject of a take-over attempt, hostile or 
otherwise, and approaches such as those outlined are usually made 
by unauthorised companies and individuals. Shareholders should be 
very wary of any unsolicited advice, offers to buy shares at a 
premium or offers of free reports into the Company. Below is the 
advice from the Financial Conduct Authority (the “FCA”).

BEWARE OF SHARE FRAUD
Fraudsters use persuasive and high-pressure tactics to lure investors 
into scams. They may offer to sell shares that turn out to be 
worthless or non-existent, or to buy shares at an inflated price in 
return for upfront payment. While high proﬁts are promised, if you 
buy or sell shares in this way you will probably lose your money.
How to avoid share fraud:
 – Keep in mind that ﬁrms authorised by the FCA are unlikely to 
contact you out of the blue with an offer to buy or sell shares. 
 – Do not get into a conversation, note the name of the person and 
ﬁrm contacting you and then end the call. 
 – Check the Financial Services Register from www.fca.org.uk to see 
if the person and ﬁrm contacting you is authorised by the FCA. 
 – Beware of fraudsters claiming to be from an authorised ﬁrm, 
copying its website or giving you false contact details. 
 – Use the ﬁrm’s contact details listed on the Register if you want to 
call it back. 
 – Call the FCA on 0800 111 6768 if the ﬁrm does not have contact 
details on the Register or you are told they are out of date. 
 – Search the list of unauthorised ﬁrms to avoid at  
www.fca.org.uk/scams. 
 – Consider that if you buy or sell shares from an unauthorised ﬁrm 
you will not have access to the Financial Ombudsman Service or 
Financial Services Compensation Scheme. 
 – Think about getting independent ﬁnancial and professional advice 
before you hand over any money. 
Remember, if it sounds too good to be true, it probably is!
REPORT A SCAM
If you are approached by fraudsters please tell the FCA using the 
share fraud reporting form at www.fca.org.uk/scams, where you can 
ﬁnd out more about investment scams.
You can also call the FCA Consumer Helpline on 0800 111 6768.
If you have already paid money to share fraudsters you should 
contact Action Fraud on 0300 123 2040.

Such fuels include pond ﬁnes, off-speciﬁcation coal and petcoke.
ANCILLARY SERVICES
Services provided to national grid used for balancing supply and 
demand or maintaining secure electricity supplies within acceptable 
limits, for example Black Start contracts. They are described in 
Connection Condition 8 of the Grid Code.
AVAILABILITY
Average percentage of time the units were available for generation.
BALANCING MECHANISM
The sub-set of the market through which the system operator can 
call upon additional generation/consumption or reduce generation/

A tax upon fossil fuels (including coal) used to generate electricity. 
It is charged as a levy on coal delivered to the power station.
CONTRACTS FOR DIFFERENCE (CFD)
A mechanism to support investment in low-carbon electricity 
generation. The CfD works by stabilising revenues for generators at 
a ﬁxed price level known as the “strike price”. Generators will receive 
revenue from selling their electricity into the market as usual. 
However, when the market reference price is below the strike price 
they will also receive a top-up payment from suppliers for the 
additional amount. Conversely if the reference price is above the 
strike price, the generator must pay back the difference.
DARK GREEN SPREAD
The difference between the power price and the cost of coal and 
carbon, including CO2 allowances under the EU Emissions Trading 
Scheme and the UK Carbon Price Support (CPS) Mechanism.

extended to cover all greenhouse gas emissions.
FEED-IN TARIFF
A long-term contract set at a ﬁxed level where variable payments are 
made to ensure the generator receives an agreed tariff. The feed-in 
tariff payment would be made in addition to the generator’s 
revenues from selling in the market.

FORCED OUTAGE RATE
The capacity which is not available due to forced outages or 
restrictions expressed as a percentage of the maximum theoretical

intended to make sure that BEIS achieves its fuel poverty, energy and 
climate change goals in a way that is consistent with economic 
recovery and minimising the impact on consumer bills.
LOAD FACTOR
Net sent out generation as a percentage of maximum sales.
LOST TIME INJURY RATE (LTIR)
The frequency rate is calculated on the following basis: lost time 
injuries/hours worked x 100,000. Lost time injuries are deﬁned as 
occurrences where the injured party is absent from work for more 
than 24 hours.
NET BALANCING MECHANISM
Net volumes attributable to accepted bids and offers in the 
balancing mechanism.
NET CASH/(DEBT)

of power sold before deduction of transmission and distribution 
losses incurred in transporting this power from the grid to the 
customer meter.
