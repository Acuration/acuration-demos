Interim Management Statement 
 
Drax today publishes its interim management statement for the period from 1 July 2012 to 
date. 
 
Trading Performance 
Since publishing our half year results on 31 July, trading conditions in the commodity 
markets in which we operate have improved, except for domestic coal, where some of our 
suppliers continue to face challenges. 
 
Although virtually fully hedged for 2012 at the time of our half year results, we have taken 
advantage of better dark green spreads since then to strengthen our contracted position, 
including additional power sales of 3.5TWh and 2.9TWh for 2013 and 2014 respectively. We 
have also continued to deliver good operating performance. 
 
These factors currently underpin our expectations for the full year, which remain unchanged.

Notes to Positions Under Contract: 
(1) Fixed price power sales include approximately 6.3TWh supplied to Centrica in the period 1 January 2012 to 
19 October 2012 under the ﬁve and a quarter year 600MW baseload contract which commenced on 1 
October 2007 and the five year 300MW baseload contract which commenced on 1 October 2010. 
 
(2) Fixed margin and structured power sales include approximately 1.6TWh in 2012 and 2.6TWh both in 2013 
and 2014 in connection with the above contracts.  Under these contracts the Group will supply power on 
terms which include Centrica paying for coal, based on international coal prices, and delivering matching CO2 
emissions allowances amounting in aggregate to approximately 7.2 million tonnes in 2012 and 2.4 million 
tonnes in each of 2013 and 2014.  The contracts provide the Group with a series of ﬁxed dark green spreads, 
with the spreads in the first contract having been agreed in the ﬁrst quarter of 2006 and with those in the 
second contract having been agreed in October 2009. 
 
 
 
 
 
We will next update the market on the Group’s positions under contract on 19 February 
2013, when we announce our preliminary results for the year ending 31 December 2012.   
 
Placing 
In a separate announcement issued today, we have set out our intention to raise 
approximately £180 million via a placing of new ordinary shares. We have previously 
announced our intention to transform Drax into a predominantly biomass-fuelled generator. 
The proposed placing is an integral part of the funding for the £650 million to £700 million 
capital investment required for this transformation.  
 
Other than as described in the separate announcement issued today, there have been no 
material events or transactions, nor any material change in the underlying financial position 
of the Group during the period.
