Pre Close Statement 
 
Whilst the commodity markets in which we operate remain challenging, as previously 
described, we benefit from a strong contracted position. Good operational performance has 
continued to allow us to take advantage of Drax Power Station’s reliability and flexibility to 
maintain a high load factor and improve profitability. As a result, we now anticipate that full 
year EBITDA (1) and underlying earnings per share (2) for 2010 will be slightly ahead of 
current market consensus. 
 
We indicated in our interim management statement on 9 November 2010 that we will next 
update the market on the Group’s positions under contract on 22 February 2011, when we 
announce our results for the year ending 31 December 2010. 
 
Since publishing our interim management statement, there have been no material events or 
transactions, nor any material change in the underlying financial position of the Group.  
 
 
 
Notes: 
(1) EBITDA is profit before interest, tax, depreciation, amortisation and loss on disposal of fixed assets and 
unrealised gains and losses on derivative contracts. 
(2) Underlying earnings per share excludes unrealised gains and losses on derivative contracts and the 
associated tax effect.
