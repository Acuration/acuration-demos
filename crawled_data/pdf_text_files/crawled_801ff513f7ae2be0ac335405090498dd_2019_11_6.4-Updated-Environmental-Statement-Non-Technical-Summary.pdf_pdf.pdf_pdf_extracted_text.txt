INTRODUCTION 
1.1 
Overview 
1.1.1 
This document is the non-technical summary (NTS) of the 
Environmental Statement (ES - Document Reference 6.1) for the 
Progress Power Project (hereafter referred to as the Project).  It has 
been prepared by Parsons Brinckerhoff on behalf of Progress Power 
Limited (PPL). 
1.1.2 
PPL is promoting a new thermal generating station (hereafter referred 
to as the Power Generation Plant) on land at the former Eye Airfield 
located in Eye, Mid Suffolk, England, (approximate grid reference 
613239 275109).  The site for the Project (hereafter referred to as the 
Project Site) is shown in ES Figures 1.1 (Document Reference No: 
6.3). 
1.1.3 
The Power Generation Plant will operate as a Simple Cycle Gas 
Turbine peaking plant and will be designed to provide an electrical 
output of up to 299 Megawatts.  As a peaking plant, the Power 
Generation Plant would operate for up to 1500 hours per year. 
1.1.4 
Peaking plants are required to operate when there is a surge in 
demand for electricity associated with a particular event (e.g. where 
many people across the country boil kettles following the end of a 
popular television programme) or where there is a sudden drop in 
power being generated from plant which are constantly operational 
(e.g. a sudden outage).  
1.1.5 
Peaking plants also help to ‘balance out’ the grid at other times of peak 
electricity demand and help to support the grid at times when other 
technologies (e.g. renewable energy sources, such as wind and solar 
farms) cannot generate electricity due to their intermittent operation and 
reliance on weather conditions. 
1.1.6 
The Project constitutes a Nationally Significant Infrastructure Project 
under the Planning Act 2008, which means that a Development 
Consent Order is required to build, operate and maintain it.  The 
proposed application for Development Consent will be processed and 
examined 
by 
the 
Planning 
Inspectorate 
who 
will 
make 
a 
recommendation to the Secretary of State for Energy and Climate 
Change on whether the Development Consent Order should be 
granted.  The final decision on the Development Consent Order 
Application is made by the Secretary of State.  The legal context of the 
Development Consent Order process is explained further in Section 1.3 
of the ES.

1.1.7 
The three main elements of the proposed Progress Power Project 
would comprise:  
• A new Power Generation Plant, a Simple Cycle Gas Turbine gas 
fired power generating station capable of providing up to 299 
Megawatts, incorporating up to five gas turbine generators with up 
to five exhaust gas flue stacks. 
• A new electrical connection, (referred to as the Electrical 
Connection) to export electricity from the Power Generation Plant 
to the National Grid Electricity Transmission System.  This element 
incorporates a new underground cable circuit connection (the 
Cable), and a new access road (the Access Road), with a new 
road junction off the A140 (the A140 Junction), and a new Electrical 
Connection 
Compound 
comprising 
a 
new 
substation 
(the 
Substation) and sealing end compound (the Sealing End 
Compound); and 
• A new gas pipeline connection (referred to as the Gas Connection) 
to bring natural gas to the Power Generation Plant from the Gas 
National Transmission System in the vicinity of the Project Site.  
This element incorporates an above ground installation (AGI) at its 
southern end and a new access road off Potash Lane. 
1.1.8 
The Power Generation Plant, Electrical Connection, and Gas 
Connection are referred to as the Project.  All of the land upon which 
the Project will be developed is referred to as the Project Site.  The 
land upon which the Power Generation Plant is situated is referred to 
as the Power Generation Plant Site, the land upon which the Gas 
Connection is situated is referred to as the Gas Connection Site, the 
land upon which the Electrical Connection is situated is referred to as 
the Electrical Connection Site, the land upon which the Electrical 
Connection Compound is situated is referred to as the Electrical 
Connection Compound Site and the land upon which the AGI is 
situated is referred to as the AGI Site.  
1.1.9 
The Application for Development Consent includes the whole of the 
Project.  The Project Site is shown in ES Figure 1.1 (Document 
Reference: 6.3).  The Power Generation Plant Site, Gas Connection 
Site and Electrical Connection Site are shown in ES Figures 4.1, 4.2 
and 4.3 (Document Reference: 6.3). 
1.2 
Needs and Benefits of the Project 
1.2.1 
There is a considerable national need for this type of project, 
acknowledged at all levels of government policy.  National planning

Statement Non-Technical Summary 
 
6 4-Non-Technical Summary_Updated v1

- 15 - 
 
policy supports the need for new electricity infrastructure due to the 
current ageing and inevitable closure of older coal fired power plants 
and the likely increase in demand for electricity over the coming 
decades. 
1.2.2 
The Government’s policies in relation to Nationally Significant 
Infrastructure Projects are set out in National Policy Statements. 
Paragraph 3.6.1 of National Policy Statement EN-1 (Overarching 
National Policy Statement for Energy) states “Fossil fuel power stations 
play a vital role in providing reliable electricity supplies: they can be 
operated flexibly in response to changes in supply and demand, and 
provide diversity in our energy mix.” 
1.2.3 
Gas is a reliable fuel source.  It is acknowledged by the Government as 
being essential to a low-carbon economy and to underpin the country’s 
energy security.  In addition, gas peaking plants such as the Project 
provide back-up to power generation from renewable sources, 
particularly wind power, which is an increasingly prevalent but 
intermittent energy source. Modern gas fired power plants are among 
the most efficient and cleanest forms of electricity power generation. 
1.2.4 
At present, thermal peaking capacity in the UK is relatively small due to 
the nature of the electricity generation mix on the national electricity 
transmission system.  There is therefore a clear and significant 
requirement for further capacity to meet the projected need for 
reactive/flexible generation.  A dedicated gas fired peaking plant such 
as the Project could allow for the rapid provision of reserve capacity to 
the national electricity transmission system, thus playing a role in 
meeting the energy requirements of the UK going forward. 
1.3 
The Developer 
1.3.1 
The developer of the Project is Progress Power Limited (PPL).  PPL is 
an energy development company established for the Project by Watt 
Power Limited (WPL).  WPL has been established to develop flexible 
gas fired generation assets to support the UK Government drive to a 
low carbon economy. WPL is resourced through Stag Energy, a 
company founded in 2002.

Assessment) Regulations 2009 (the EIA Regulations)1.  EIA is an 
assessment of the Project’s likely significant environmental effects.  
This document is a summary (in non-technical language) of the ES for 
the Project which details the results of the EIA.  The full ES is available 
separately (Document Reference 6.1). 
1.5 
Planning Policy Context 
1.5.1 
The Department for Energy and Climate Change has published a 
number of National Policy Statements in relation to energy 
infrastructure, which were designated by the Secretary of State in July 
2011.  These National Policy Statements set out national policy against 
which proposals for Nationally Significant Infrastructure Projects are 
assessed and decided on.  
1.5.2 
Due to the nature of the Project (which will generate over 50 Megawatts 
of electricity), four of the designated National Policy Statements are 
considered relevant to the determination of the proposed Application for 
Development Consent:  
• Overarching National Policy Statement for Energy EN-1: This sets 
out national policy for energy infrastructure as defined by the 
Planning Act 2008, which provides the primary basis for decisions 
by the Secretary of State.  It recognises that there is a significant 
need for new energy infrastructure, which the Project supports.  It 
states that pending plant closures in the UK will reduce available 
capacity by 22 Gigawatts by 2020 as a result of tightening 
environmental legislation and older power stations approaching the 
end of their useful life;  
• National Policy Statement for Fossil Fuel Electricity Generating 
Infrastructure EN-2: This sets out policies specific to the 
determination of applications for fossil fuel electricity generating 
infrastructure; 
• National Policy Statement for Gas Supply Infrastructure and Gas 
and Oil Pipelines EN-4: This sets Government policy on the 
relevant considerations and factors that should be taken into 
account as to route selection for developers for, inter alia, gas 
pipelines, although it is not directly related to this Project as it 
relates principally to more significant gas pipelines than the Gas 
Connection.  It is therefore considered that the policies of this 
National Policy Statement are less likely to be important and

relevant in the determination of the Application for Development 
Consent; and 
• National Policy Statement for Electricity Networks Infrastructure 
(EN-5): This provides the primary basis for decisions taken by the 
Secretary of State on applications it receives for electricity network 
Nationally Significant Infrastructure Projects, including the relevant 
considerations and factors that should be taken into account related 
to route selection.  The Electrical Connection is not the relevant 
type (being underground rather than overhead) to be categorised as 
a Nationally Significant Infrastructure Project by itself, therefore it is 
considered that the policies of this National Policy Statement are 
less likely to be important and relevant in the determination of the 
Application for Development Consent. 
1.5.3 
National Policy Statement EN-1 states that consideration may be given 
to planning policy outside the National Policy Statements where it is 
important and relevant to the Secretary of State's decision.  Further 
detail is provided in the ES (Document Reference No: 6.1) and 
Planning Statement (Document Reference No: 10.1).

The Project Site is shown in ES Figure 1.1 (Document Reference: 6.3) 
and encompasses all three elements of the Project.  Any temporary 
areas for equipment / material laydown, required during construction of 
the Project, would also be located within the Project Site.  The Project 
Site lies entirely within the administrative boundary of Mid Suffolk 
District Council.  The works are listed in Schedule 1 of the Draft 
Development Consent Order2 and described in Section 4 of the ES. 
2.1.2 
The Power Generation Plant would be situated on land within the 
former Eye Airfield, approximately 1 km north west of Eye, 1.3 km west 
of Langdon Green, approximately 1.5 km east of Yaxley, in Mid Suffolk, 
and 4 km south of Diss in South Norfolk.  The land within the former 
Eye Airfield has been designated as a Strategic Site for development 
by Mid Suffolk District Council. 
2.1.3 
The Power Generation Plant Site covers an area of approximately 10 
ha. However, the footprint of the Power Generation Plant itself would 
be smaller than this (approximately 5.37 ha). 
2.1.4 
The Power Generation Plant Site is currently comprised of agricultural 
land surrounded by a belt of trees and earth bund to the east, over 
which lies the National Grid Gas Compressor Station.  The immediate 
surrounding area is characterised by the remnants of the airfield, 
including the runway and associated access roads.  Buildings that once 
formed part of the airfield have been replaced by units accommodating 
various industrial activities including a power generation facility (the 
12.7 Megawatts Eye Chicken Litter Power Plant).  Additionally, there 
are four large (130 m high) wind turbines located on the former Eye 
Airfield.  Two turbines to the west of Potash Lane operated by Triodos 
Renewables and two more to the south of the Power Generation Plant 
Site at Baldwin Farm. 
2.1.5 
The Power Generation Plant Site is accessed from a private road to the 
south, Potash Lane, which in turn connects to Castleton Way, via the 
former main runway.  Castleton Way provides connectivity to either 
from the B1077 to the east and the A140 to the west. 
2.1.6 
The Electrical Connection is proposed to run west over open 
agricultural land for a distance of approximately 1.5 km to the existing 
overhead power cables north east of the village of Yaxley.  It is 
proposed to construct an Electrical Connection Compound at this

location. The surrounding area is mainly open agricultural land with 
scattered residential dwellings and the village of Yaxley to the south at 
a distance of approximately 500 m. 
2.1.7 
The Gas Connection will also largely cross agricultural land.  Refer to 
Section 2.3 below for more information. 
2.2 
Power Generation Plant 
2.2.1 
The Power Generation Plant would be a peaking plant fired on natural 
gas. It will provide a total output of up to 299 Megawatts (enough to 
power the equivalent of 400,000 homes).  Given these parameters, it 
has been determined that a Simple Cycle Gas Turbine plant is the 
preferred and most appropriate technology choice for the Project.  
Further detail is provided in Section 3.3 and a schematic showing this 
type of plant operation is shown below in Insert 1. 
Insert 1 – Simple Cycle Gas Turbine Schematic 
 
 
2.2.2 
The main equipment in a Simple Cycle Gas Turbine is a gas turbine 
generator, comprising of the following components: 
• Inlet air filter; 
• Air compressor;

• Combustion chamber;  
• Power turbine; and  
• Exhaust silencer. 
2.2.3 
In the gas turbines air is compressed and natural gas is injected.  The 
fuel will then burn in the combustion chamber producing hot, high 
pressure gases.  This gas expands across the blades of the gas turbine 
which drives the electrical generators to produce electricity.  The 
exhaust silencer will reduce noise pollution from this process.  
2.2.4 
The waste gases and heat produced from this process will be released 
to the atmosphere via stacks (chimneys).  The stacks will be equipped 
with emissions control equipment which will limit emissions of Nitrous 
Oxide (NOx) to the atmosphere by the use of water injection or dry low 
emission combustors. 
2.2.5 
A stack height sensitivity study has been undertaken for the Project 
which has determined that the minimum stack height for the Power 
Generation Plant, required for adequate dispersion of emissions and to 
meet legislative air quality targets, is 25 m.  The maximum stack height 
would be 30 m.  This height applies to all technology choices, as 
discussed below, and is not dependent on the number of units present 
at the site.  Further information on this is provided in Section 6 of the 
ES3. 
2.2.6 
There are several options of Simple Cycle Gas Turbine plant available 
to generate up to 299 Megawatts.  Simple Cycle Gas Turbine plants 
often use aero-derivative gas turbines (i.e. turbines derived from 
aeronautical applications), primarily because of their suitability for 
frequent start-ups, flexibility, high efficiency and high-availability 
maintenance techniques.  For the aero-derivative case, PPL envisages 
using 3, 4 or 5 individual aero-derivative gas turbine generators to 
achieve 299 Megawatts. 
2.2.7 
However, ‘industrial’ type gas turbines can also be used which are 
typically larger and often more suited to longer operational hours.  They 
offer similar efficiency but less fast loading flexibility.  Industrial gas 
turbines differ from aeronautical designs in that the casings, rotors and 
blading are of heavier construction.  For the industrial gas turbine case 
PPL would likely use 1 or 2 individual industrial gas turbine generators 
to achieve 299 Megawatts.

2.2.8 
The Development Consent Order Application is flexible enough to allow 
PPL to achieve a 299 Megawatts project by building between one to 
five gas turbines generators. 
2.2.9 
In addition to the main gas turbine generator units at the Power 
Generation Plant Site, the following would also be present: 
• 
Process Water Tank - In order to provide make up water and store 
demineralised water to the plant.  
• 
Fire Water Tank - The fire water storage tank would be designed 
to comply with the relevant fire regulations and would be installed 
together with fire pumps, hose reels, fire hydrants and portable 
extinguishers. 
• 
Control Building – Required in order to monitor the plant 
operation and house plant controls. 
• 
Workshop and Stores Building - To store certain strategic and 
routine maintenance spares and to provide a facility for carrying out 
minor maintenance of the plant. . 
• 
A Gatehouse – Needed to provide security and maintain a log of 
site attendance, deliveries etc;  
• 
A Switchyard / Banking Compound - Required to connect the 
electrical infrastructure from the Power Generation Plant to 
transformers before export to the National Grid; and  
• 
A Gas Receiving Station - Required to meter and process gas 
coming from the NTS to feed into the Power Generation Plant Site 
at the correct flow and pressure conditions.   
• 
Black Start Generator – used to start the main GT’s in the event 
of a failure of the grid i.e. no power is on the network, this is termed 
a black condition.  Therefore in order to start the gas turbines a 
diesel generator is install on site to produce enough power to start 
the gas turbine).   
2.2.10 
An illustrative visual of the Power Generation Plant site is provided in 
Insert 2.  The final layout proposal for the Power Generation Plant Site 
would incorporate a degree of flexibility with respect to the actual sizing 
and siting of the structures and buildings shown within the Power 
Generation Plant Site. 
2.2.11 
Sufficient spares will be held on site to ensure reliable operation of the 
plant. Periodic and routine maintenance would take place on average 
once every six months, to ensure optimal operation at all times.

2.3 
Gas Connection 
2.3.1 
A new underground gas pipeline (the Pipeline) would be required to 
connect the Power Generation Plant to the existing high pressure Gas 
National Transmission System in order to provide a reliable supply of 
fuel.  Connection to the Gas National Transmission System at any high 
pressure pipeline would require two above ground facilities to be 
installed, a minimum offtake connection facility (containing monitoring 
and control equipment), which would be owned by National Grid, and a 
Pipeline Inspection Gauge trap launching facility (required for 
maintenance operations on the Pipeline) which would be owned by 
PPL.  Together these form the AGI.   
2.3.2 
The Pipeline would run to the Power Generation Plant from Feeder 5 
on the Gas National Transmission System (see Insert 3).  The route of 
the Pipeline would begin at the new AGI, located to the south of the 
former Eye Airfield, north of Castleton Way and east of Potash Lane.  
From here the Pipeline would cross Potash Lane heading west and 
around the perimeter of an agricultural field.  To the north of 
Whitehouse farm, the route would traverse east, south of the 
Speeddeck Factory, then turn north up the west side of Potash Lane 
before crossing the runway and continuing north into the south west

corner of the Power Generation Plant Site.  The approximate length of 
the Pipeline would be 1.7 km. 
Insert 3 – The Gas Connection Site 
 
2.3.3 
Construction and maintenance access to the AGI will be via a new road 
turn in off Potash Lane. 
2.3.4 
Construction of the Gas Connection would likely take place within a 50 
m wide temporarily fenced strip of land along the Gas Connection 
Route Corridor, which would be increased or decreased in size where 
required (for example, decreased adjacent to nature conservation 
areas).  It is expected that the Pipeline will be constructed using 
standard open-cut cross-country pipeline construction techniques (i.e. a 
trench).  Trenchless techniques (e.g. Horizontal Directional Drilling) 
may be used in some locations to reduce impacts on sensitive areas.  
The main activities will include topsoil stripping; pipe stringing (the 
process of laying the pipe end to end) and welding; trench excavation; 
pipe laying (positioning of the welded pipe into the trench); back filling; 
pressure testing, drying and pipeline pigging operations; and re-
instatement of the land.

2.4 
Electrical Connection 
2.4.1 
A new Electrical Connection would be required to allow electricity 
generated by the Power Generation Plant to be exported to the 
National Grid Electricity Transmission System.  During the development 
of the Project, a number of connection options have been considered, 
arriving at the decision to connect via an underground cable from the 
Power Generation Plant Site to the existing 400 kilovolt overhead 
National Grid Electricity Transmission System to the north of Yaxley 
(refer to Section 3.5 below for further information).   
Electrical Connection Compound 
2.4.2 
To connect into the existing overhead lines, an Electrical Connection 
Compound is required.  The location for the Electrical Connection 
Compound is shown on Insert 4, to the south of The Leys, west of Leys 
Lane. 
Insert 4 – The Electrical Connection Site 
 
2.4.3 
The outline design for the Electrical Connection Compound shows that 
that it would be composed of a new Sealing End Compound and the 
Substation. The Sealing End Compound would be approximately 45 m

X 22 m located on the west side of the existing overhead line.  A 
substation can either be an air insulated substation or a gas insulated 
substation.  PPL considers that the Substation with air insulated 
technology is appropriate and acceptable in the location of the 
Electrical Connection Compound Site.  The Substation with air 
insulated technology would be 150 m X 150 m, located on the east side 
of the overhead line.  In the event that it is considered that for the 
Electrical Connection Compound Site the Substation should be of a gas 
insulated design, then the Substation would be 100 m x 80 m located 
on the east side of the overhead line.  For the purposes of this ES, 
unless the text expressly states otherwise, references to "Substation" 
refers to both a substation with air insulated technology and a 
substation with gas insulated technology. 
The Cable 
2.4.4 
The Cable would exit the western edge of the Power Generation Plant 
Site and head south down Potash Lane before turning west, to the 
south of the Speeddeck factory, and crossing the northern edge of the 
agricultural field towards the A140.  At the A140, the Cable would pass 
under the road before heading in a westerly direction across the 
agricultural land towards the 400 kilovolt line.  On the west of the A140, 
the Cable would cross the agricultural fields in a near perfect east – 
west orientation.  To the west of these fields, the Cable would pass 
under Leys Lane and continue west, running parallel to an existing 
hedge line until it meets the Electrical Connection Compound Site (see 
Figure 4.3 Document Reference 6.3).  The approximate length of the 
Cable would be 1.6 km. 
2.4.5 
Cable installation would follow a similar method to that for the Gas 
Connection.  It would predominantly be carried out in an excavated 
trench with cable directly buried in the trench (open-cut method).  The 
cable bedding will be laid and the cable pull set up.  Once the cables 
are pulled in and the rollers removed, the cable surround can be 
installed with cable protection cover slabs placed over the cable.  
Finally, the backfilling and final reinstatement will be undertaken.  
Telemetry apparatus (within the cable trench) would report back any 
issues to a central control room during operation. 
2.4.6 
For cable installation across the A140, installation would use trenchless 
techniques (such as Horizontal Directional Drilling) to prevent the 
potential impacts to road traffic and to the small ponds located west of 
Old Norwich Road. The need for trenchless techniques may also be 
identified during detailed design of the Project.

A140 and the Electrical Connection Compound Site (see Insert 5). 
Insert 5 – The Access Road and A140 Junction

life of up to 25 years, after which time it will be decommissioned or re-
powered depending on the nature of the electricity market and energy 
mix at the time.  The Electrical Connection Compound, AGI and 
respective cables and pipelines will be designed to be operational for

SITE SELECTION, ALTERNATIVES AND DESIGN EVOLUTION 
3.1 
Introduction 
3.1.1 
The Project has gone through several iterations and evolutions in 
design, and the site selection itself has been an iterative process. The 
following alternatives have been considered for the Project as part of 
the design evolution process:  
• Alternative development sites;  
• Alternative layouts;   
• Alternative technologies for electricity generation; 
• Alternative options for the Electrical Connection; and 
• Alternative options for the Gas Connection. 
3.1.2 
An overview of the alternatives that have been considered for the 
Project are provided below.  Further detail is provided in Section 5 of 
the ES5 and further detail on consultation is provided in the separate 
Consultation Report (Document Reference 5.1).  Further discussion of 
alternatives and the suitability of the site can also be found in the 
Planning Statement (Document reference 10.1) and the Electrical 
Connection Sighting Report (Document reference 10.3). 
3.2 
Alternative Development Sites 
3.2.1 
As part of a detailed feasibility assessment, WPL studied a range of 
sites around the UK to support power generation plants of this nature.  
The key factors which they considered necessary in a site were broadly 
four-fold: technical (e.g. the size of the site and the proximity to 
appropriate Gas and Electrical Connection points), environmental, 
economic and whether the proposals would be in line with local 
planning policy. 
3.2.2 
Based on these factors, the Project Site was considered suitable as it is 
within close proximity to the Gas National Transmission System and to 
high voltage electrical transmission infrastructure.  The Project Site is 
also within an existing industrial estate, surrounded by similar industrial 
developments. The area is designated as a Strategic Site for 
development by Mid Suffolk District Council and Mid Suffolk District 
Council has aspirations to safeguard the area for an energy park.  In

addition, there is more than adequate space to develop the Power 
Generation Plant and integral infrastructure. 
3.3 
Power Generation Plant 
3.3.1 
The following technology options were originally considered for the 299 
Megawatt Power Generation Plant: Simple Cycle Gas Turbine plant, 
Combined Cycle Gas Turbine plant and Reciprocating Gas Engine 
plant.  The potential for using Combined Heat and Power (CHP) 
opportunities using these technologies was also considered. The 
European Commission Directive 2004/8/EC promotes the used of 
Combined Heat and Power in the internal energy market and supports 
installation where there is a significant demand for heat.  
3.3.2 
PPL has undertaken a number of studies in relation to the technology 
choice and has concluded that a Simple Cycle Gas Turbine is the most 
suitable technology choice for generating up to 299 Megawatts as a 
peaking plant at the Power Generation Plant Site. This has been 
determined based on the following environmental, technical and 
feasibility considerations: 
• 
Visual impact: the use of a Simple Cycle Gas Turbine plant over a 
Combined Cycle Gas Turbine plant limits the height of the stack(s) 
required and therefore the visual impacts associated with the 
Power Generation Plant.  This is due to a Combined Cycle Gas 
Turbine plant needing a higher stack height to achieve adequate 
dispersion of emissions to meet air quality standards.  The stack 
heights for a Simple Cycle Gas Turbine plant and a Reciprocating 
Gas Engine plant would be similar.  
• 
Noise and available space: noise levels from a Simple Cycle Gas 
Turbine plant would typically be lower than for a Reciprocating Gas 
Engine plant, as the latter operates using ignition of gaseous fuels 
and air in a specific mix which causes motion of a piston to 
generate electricity.  A larger number of Reciprocating Gas Engine 
units would also be required at the Power Generation Plant Site to 
generate up to 299 Megawatts; spatially this may not be possible.  
• 
Emissions: Due to the method in which fuel is combusted in 
Reciprocating Gas Engine plants, there is also usually a 
requirement for additional control of NOx emissions in order to 
meet Industrial Emissions Directive guidelines.  This additional NOx 
control would usually be in the form of Selective Catalytic 
Reduction which would not only require further landtake and more 
maintenance, but may also require ammonia or urea injection to 
operate.  This then has impacts in terms of environmental disposal

of catalysts, as well as ammonia slip which is released from the 
stack.  
• 
Water resources: the water requirement of a Simple Cycle Gas 
Turbine plant is significantly lower than for a Combined Cycle Gas 
Turbine and Combined Heat and Power plant.  The availability of 
water in the local area is extremely limited, there are no surface 
watercourses that would be suitable for abstractions, and although 
the Project Site is underlain by a principle aquifer PPL understands 
that this is already heavily abstracted, putting significant pressure 
on the local water supply, therefore a Simple Cycle Gas Turbine is 
more suitable.   
• 
Financial: compared to both Reciprocating Gas Engine plant and 
Combined Cycle Gas Turbine plant, Simple Cycle Gas Turbine 
units typically have a smaller capital cost per Megawatt installed.  
This is largely because Combined Cycle Gas Turbine plants are 
more complex in their operation, despite being more efficient. 
Reciprocating Gas Engine plants are also more flexible and allow 
operation on different fuels.  However, the nature of the Power 
Generation Plant is that of a peaking plant which would operate for 
up to 1500 hours per year.  Over this timescale, it is considered 
that the benefits in efficiencies or flexibility which can be achieved 
by using a Combined Cycle Gas Turbine plant or Reciprocating 
Gas Engine plant are very minimal and do not justify the additional 
capital costs of these plants.  As Simple Cycle Gas Turbine plants 
are less complex in operation, they are also cheaper to construct 
and maintain.  
• 
Start up times: In order to respond in the most effective way to 
changing demands placed on the grid, peaking plants must be able 
to start up and generate electricity to their full capacity at short 
notice.  Conversely, they also need to shut down rapidly and safely, 
so that excess electricity is not generated and then wasted when 
the demands on the grid even out and can be met by baseload 
plants.  Simple Cycle Gas Turbine plants are able to start up and 
shut down much quicker than similar sized Combined Cycle Gas 
Turbine plants.  Typically, a Simple Cycle Gas Turbine plant can 
start up to full load in around 15 minutes, whereas for a Combined 
Cycle Gas Turbine plant this could be as much as 2 hours (from 
hot) depending on the technology selected, and from cold, start up 
times are as much as 8 hours. Simple Cycle Gas Turbine plants 
are therefore better suited to meeting flexible demands. 
• 
Efficiency: Although Combined Cycle Gas Turbine plant typically 
have efficiencies of around 50-60% (compared with 40% for Simple 
Cycle Gas Turbine plant), these gains in efficiency are only realised

when the plant is up to running temperature and working 
continuously.  For a peaking plant operating for a limited number of 
hours, efficiency gains are marginal and outweighed by the other 
environmental benefits and the fast start-up times of Simple Cycle 
Gas Turbine plants.  
3.3.3 
Combined Heat and Power is not considered to be technically or 
economically feasible with a Simple Cycle Gas Turbine peaking power 
station because the profile for the generation of electrical energy from 
the station cannot be guaranteed to coincide with the required heat 
demand profile of any potential consumer.  Periods of electricity 
generation from the Project would typically be for 1-2 hours on 
occasional days, and of limited duration over the year.  Heat demands, 
where they exist in the locality, are, by contrast, generally steady and 
persist over some 7 months of the year for residential heating or for the 
full year for industrial or commercial uses.  This lack of demand 
coincidence renders the concept of Combined Heat and Power 
ineffective and unfeasible. 
3.3.4 
Unlike Combined Cycle Gas Turbine plants, Simple Cycle Gas Turbine 
plants do not produce steam as part of the electricity generating 
process, so the provision of Combined Heat and Power capability 
would require the addition of steam raising plant, resulting in a greater 
cost and visual impact (i.e. a higher stack).  Furthermore, in order to 
generate steam a significant quantity of water would be required.  The 
availability of water in the local area is extremely limited.  There are no 
surface watercourses that would be suitable for abstractions and 
although the Project Site is underlain by a principle aquifer PPL 
understands that this is already heavily abstracted, putting significant 
pressure on the local water supply. 
3.3.5 
Maintaining a low capital cost for the Project is essential as plants 
selected to operate are chosen based on their ability to deliver fast 
reliable power at times of peak demand at the most economically 
advantageous price.  Further information is provided in the Design Note 
on Combined Heat and Power (Document Reference 6.2, Appendix 
5A). 
3.4 
Gas Connection 
3.4.1 
Seven potential Gas Connection Route Corridor options were assessed 
at the commencement of the Project (see Insert 6).  All seven options 
connect to Feeder 5, a 600mm high pressure steel pipeline that runs 
between Yelverton to Stowmarket and passes to the south and east of 
the Power Generation Plant Site.  Following consultation at both the

Scoping and Preliminary Environmental Information Report stage, a 
final preferred route corridor, Option 4, was chosen. 
Insert 6 – Gas Connection Route Corridor Options 
 
3.4.2 
After the Scoping stage, further analysis from additional studies 
determined that five of the Gas Connection Route Corridor options 
(Options 2, 2a, 2b, 3 and 5) were not feasible due to a combination of 
factors, including the proximity to recently consented wind turbines, the 
potential to render large areas of fields unusable and the potential to 
cause significant disruption to a currently busy and operational part of 
the former Eye Airfield Industrial Estate. 
3.4.3 
Options 1 and 4 were therefore taken forward for consultation at the 
Preliminary Environmental Information Report stage.  Following 
consultation, Option 1, which is the shortest, was considered 
favourable due to its most direct and therefore less disruptive route.  
However, further studies and consultation with National Grid found that 
no safe route or connection point could be found within the National 
Grid Gas Compressor Station site.  As such, this option had to be 
dropped on technical grounds. 
3.4.4 
The preferred option for the Gas Connection Route Corridor therefore 
is Option 4, which connects to the NTS at the south of the former Eye 
Airfield.

Electrical Connection 
3.5.1 
The Electrical Connection for the Project has been designed to provide 
the most technically acceptable, direct and least environmentally 
damaging route between the Power Generation Plant and the National 
Grid Electricity Transmission System, as described below. 
3.5.2 
At the Scoping stage, decisions about the exact nature and location of 
the Electrical Connection for the Project had yet to be made and the 
following two options were being considered: 
• 
Option 1 - Bring the National Grid Electricity Transmission System 
400 kilovolt line to the Power Generation Plant Site which would 
allow the Electrical Connection Compound to be located on the 
Power Generation Plant Site;  
• 
Option 2 - Locate the Electrical Connection Compound adjacent to 
the 400 kilovolt overhead lines and bring the 299 Megawatts 
generated by the Power Generation Plant to the existing network.   
3.5.3 
As such, an “Electrical Opportunity Area” was identified, which 
stretched from the Power Generation Plant Site in the east to just 
beyond the existing 400 kilovolt overhead lines in the west, and from 
just north of Yaxley in the south to Malting Farm in the north. 
3.5.4 
Further to this, an Electrical Connection Siting Report was undertaken 
by PPL (Document Reference 10.3).  Due to environmental, technical 
and commercial considerations the location of the Electrical Connection 
Compound on the Power Generation Plant Site was discarded as a 
connection option.  In addition, to ensure that the potential Electrical 
Connection Compound would not introduce unwanted visual impacts, it 
was decided that the search area for the siting study would be limited to 
an area that could be reached by an underground cable, thus ensuring 
that additional overhead lines could be ruled out at the offset. 
3.5.5 
A combination of ecological and cultural heritage constraints 
subsequently led to the elimination of all Electrical Opportunity Area 
land to the north of Goswold Hall.  Due to the cluster of properties at 
The Leys, the remaining Electrical Opportunity Area land was further 
subdivided naturally into two separate areas (refer to Insert 7): 
• 
Electrical Connection Compound Option 1: located to the south of 
The Leys, within agricultural land to the north of Mellis Road;

• 
Electrical Connection Compound Option 2: located to the north of 
The Leys, within agricultural land off Leys Lane between The Leys 
and Goswold Hall. 
3.5.6 
These options were consulted upon at the Preliminary Environmental 
Information Report stage. 
Insert 7 – Electrical Connection Compound Area Options 
 
3.5.7 
Following formal consultation and further analysis, it is considered that 
both options have the potential to give rise to adverse effects on visual 
amenity and landscape character.  On balance, it is considered that 
Option 2 has the greater potential for adverse visual impacts (it is 
closer to residential receptors and potentially more exposed) and 
landscape impact (due to existing field boundary structure).  However, 
it is also recognised that mitigation in the form of landscaping would be 
available and effective.   
3.5.8 
It is also considered that Option 1 has the potential to give rise to 
adverse effects on: an established watercourse which would require 
diversion and have consequences on the wider drainage network; a 
Public Right of Way which is an ancient Green Lane and would require 
diversion; mature trees and hedgerows and associated habitat 
(including biodiversity adjacent to the Green Lane) which would require 
removal; and buried archaeology.

3.5.9 
As well as the environmental implications, it is considered that the 
potential adverse impacts associated with Option 1 (in particular the 
watercourse and drainage effects) have the potential to increase the 
technical difficulty and costs of development.   
3.5.10 
In view of the availability of mitigation for landscape and visual impacts, 
and the greater number of potentially adverse effects associated with 
Option 1, and the absence of other differentiating factors, Option 2 (the 
southern site) has been selected as the preferred location for the 
Electrical Connection Compound. 
3.5.11 
Having established a preferred Electrical Connection Compound 
location, the Electrical Connection Route Corridor has been designed in 
a manner that would have the least environmental impact, whilst also 
keeping agricultural loss and disruption to a minimum.  
3.5.12 
This has been achieved by selecting the most direct route possible 
from the A140 to the Electrical Connection Compound, maintaining a 
route that is, as close as possible to existing field boundaries to reduce 
disruption of historic field boundaries as well as farming practices, and 
avoiding sensitive ecological habitat.

ENVIRONMENTAL IMPACT ASSESSMENT 
4.1 
Environmental Impact Assessment Methodology 
4.1.1 
In accordance with Planning Act 2008 and the EIA Regulations, the EIA 
process for the Project incorporates the following (further detail is 
provided in Section 3 of the ES (Document reference 6.1)):  
• Establishing, through consultation, the Scope of the EIA including 
obtaining a combined Screening and Scoping Opinion from the 
Secretary of State; 
• Consideration of any potential technical and environmental 
alternatives;  
• Establishing a comprehensive understanding of the existing 
baseline environmental conditions for the Project Site and the 
relevant study areas for each topic;  
• Identifying the potential environmental impacts resulting from the 
Project;  
• Determining how the potential environmental impacts can be 
avoided, reduced or off-set through informed design and / or further 
mitigation and how its benefits may be enhanced; 
• Assessing the significance of the potential environmental impacts in 
conjunction with other impacts arising from the Project and those 
from other neighbouring developments and / or sources (in-
combination and cumulative impacts); and 
• Proposing options as to how any significant residual impacts will be 
mitigated, managed and monitored.  
4.1.2 
Before commencing the EIA for the Project, PPL requested a Scoping 
Opinion from the Secretary of State in May 2013, who then consulted 
bodies such as Mid Suffolk District Council, Natural England and the 
Environment Agency.  The formal Scoping Opinion was received in 
June 2013 and is included in Appendix 3.B of the ES.  Further 
consultation was subsequently undertaken based on a Preliminary 
Environmental Information Report which was issued in October 2013. 
4.1.3 
Throughout the following sections, the terms construction, operation 
and decommissioning have been used.  These are defined as follows:

• Construction – Including site clearance, earthworks and general 
construction activities.  Depending on the final plant selection, this 
is anticipated to take around 21 months.  
• Operation – Operation of all aspects of the Project, including 
maintenance.  The Project is anticipated to have a lifetime of 
approximately 25 years.  
• Decommissioning – Removal of all Power Generation Plant, AGI 
and Electrical Connection Compound items and restoration of sites 
when the Power Generation Plant has reached the end of its 
operational life.  This is anticipated to take a similar time to 
construction.  It is likely that underground structures, including the 
Cable and Pipeline, would be left in situ to avoid any adverse 
environmental impacts associated with their removal.   
4.1.4 
To allow for a precautionary approach, the assessments in the ES have 
been based on a realistic worst case scenario specific to each topic 
area.  For most topics this means assessing a Power Generation Plant 
configuration of five stacks at 30 m each, with the exception of air 
quality and ecology where five stacks at 25 m (the lowest possible 
height) are considered to represent the worst case scenario. 
4.1.5 
The assessments consider the sensitivity of a receptor and the 
magnitude of impact on a receptor.  The significance of the effect on 
the receptor is then determined.  Further detail is provided in the 
methodology section for each environmental topic in the ES (Document 
Reference 6.1) (Sections 6 - 15). A brief summary is provided below. 
4.1.6 
The sensitivity of a receptor is categorised from very high (for example 
an internationally designated site such as a Special Area of 
Conservation), high (for example a nationally designated site such as a 
Site of Special Scientific Interest), medium (for example a regionally 
designated site), low (for example a locally designated nature 
conservation site) to negligible (no sensitivity to change).  The 
magnitude of impact on a receptor is categorised from major, 
moderate, minor, negligible to no change.  The significance of the effect 
is then determined following the method shown below:

the 
Electrical 
Connection 
during 
construction, 
operation 
and 
decommissioning, a summary of the cumulative impacts and a 
summary of the residual impacts.  All sections assess the impacts of 
the anticipated works to be undertaken by National Grid to connect the 
Electrical Connection Compound into the National Grid Transmission 
System (i.e. the existing 400kV overhead line).  A summary of the 
mitigation measures and residual impacts for the overall Project for 
each environmental assessment topic is provided in the Conclusion 
section at the end of the NTS (Section 4.12). 
4.1.9 
A Habitat Regulations Screening Assessment was also undertaken due 
to the proximity of the Project Site to a Special Area of Conservation 
and a Ramsar Site.  This No Significant Effects Report can be found at 
Document Reference 5.7. 
4.2 
Air Quality 
Introduction 
4.2.2 
The construction, operation and decommissioning of the Project have 
the potential to impact on air quality both through the generation of dust 
during the construction and decommissioning phases and from stack 
emissions during operation.

4.2.3 
A desk based assessment, together with air dispersion modelling has 
been carried out to assess any potential air quality impacts resulting 
from the Project on identified receptors.  These include residential 
settlements nearest to the Power Generation Plant Site; namely Eye, 
Yaxley, Brome, Mellis and Diss and sensitive ecological receptors 
within 10 km of the Project Site.  The full assessment for this topic is 
provided in Section 6 of the ES (Document Reference No: 6.1).  A brief 
summary is provided below. 
Baseline 
4.2.4 
The Project Site is located in Mid Suffolk District Council.  In their 2011 
Air Quality Progress Report6, Mid Suffolk District Council reported that 
no areas were exceeding the Air Quality Objectives. 
Assessment of Potential Impacts 
Power Generation Plant 
Construction 
4.2.5 
The main potential impacts resulting from construction of the Power 
Generation Plant on air quality are from dust generated from 
construction activities (e.g. earthworks, stockpiling, materials transport 
etc.).  There is also a small potential for impacts arising from exhaust 
emissions from on-site plant (e.g. diesel generators) and construction 
traffic.  
4.2.6 
Despite this, it is considered unlikely that levels of atmospheric dust 
would be generated which would constitute a health hazard or nuisance 
to local people or industry.  For ecological receptors, potential risks 
relate to the deposition of dust onto foliage.  However, given the nature 
of the area surrounding the site (agricultural land, with the potential for 
bare soils during normal use) risks of dust deposition are unlikely to be 
significantly greater than at present. 
4.2.7 
Impacts would be minimised through successful implementation of an 
agreed Construction Environmental Management Plan (a draft of which 
is provided in Appendix 4A of the ES), which would incorporate 
appropriate dust mitigation measures such as damping down or 
covering of stock piles and excavations during dry and windy weather.  
Additionally, the majority of particulates from construction activities 
settle within short distances of construction sites.  Impacts on receptors 
are therefore considered negligible following implementation of the 
Construction Environmental Management Plan.

Operation 
4.2.8 
The main potential impacts arising from operation of the Power 
Generation Plant are associated with the stack emissions arising as a 
result of the combustion of natural gas.  Emissions from the stack(s) 
include NOx and carbon monoxide (CO).   
4.2.9 
However, modern gas fired power plant are inherently clean and 
produce far fewer emissions than other fossil fuel power plants (e.g. 
coal) when compared on an energy output basis.  Emissions of both 
NOx and CO are strictly limited under national and international 
guidelines such as the Industrial Emissions Directive.  
4.2.10 
Air quality modelling has shown that an appropriate stack height (25 m 
minimum and 30 m maximum) would achieve adequate dispersion of 
NOx and CO to meet legislative limits and prevent any significant 
impacts to identified receptors.  For nitrogen and acid deposition no 
significant effects on habitats are expected as a result of the operation 
of the Power Generation Plant. 
Decommissioning 
4.2.11 
During decommissioning, temporary air quality impacts are likely to 
arise due to dust and particulate matter emissions.  It is likely that these 
impacts would be similar to those of the construction phase.  The 
principal effects would arise due to demolition / removal of installations 
and earthworks, but impacts can be reduced to negligible significance 
with the application of the mitigation measures set out for construction 
phase. 
Gas Connection 
Construction 
4.2.12 
As with the Power Generation Plant, the main potential impacts on air 
quality resulting from construction of the Gas Connection are from dust 
generated from construction activities (e.g. earthworks, stockpiling, 
materials transport and trenching etc.).  Impacts on receptors are 
considered negligible following implementation of the Construction 
Environmental Management Plan. 
Operation 
4.2.13 
During operation of the Gas Connection there would be no impacts to 
air quality as the AGI does not routinely produce emissions to air.

Decommissioning  
4.2.14 
During decommissioning, temporary air quality impacts are likely to 
arise due to dust and particulate matter emissions.  The principal 
effects would arise due to demolition / removal of installations and 
earthworks associated with the AGI, but impacts can be reduced to 
negligible significance with the application of the mitigation measures 
set out for construction phase.  It is likely that the Pipeline would be left 
in-situ which would reduce impacts to levels below those seen during 
construction. 
Electrical Connection 
Construction 
4.2.15 
As with the Power Generation Plant, the main potential impacts on air 
quality resulting from construction of the Electrical Connection are from 
dust generated from construction activities (e.g. earthworks, stockpiling, 
materials transport and trenching etc.).  Impacts on receptors are 
considered negligible following implementation of the Construction 
Environmental Management Plan. 
Operation  
4.2.16 
No significant air quality impacts will arise as a result of the operation of 
the Electrical Connection as the infrastructure itself does not routinely 
produce emissions to air.  In the event that the Electrical Connection 
Compound is comprised of a gas insulated substation, the potential for 
emissions to air of sulphur hexafluoride (SF6) would arise.  SF6 is not 
toxic to humans, but is a powerful greenhouse gas.  As such, a 
programme of leakage detection and prevention will be put in place to 
minimise emissions of the insulating gas, sulphur hexafluoride (SF6). 
Decommissioning  
4.2.17 
During decommissioning, temporary air quality impacts are likely to 
arise due to dust and particulate matter emissions.  It is likely that these 
impacts will be similar to those described above for construction.  The 
principal effects would arise due to demolition / removal of installations 
and earthworks associated with the Electrical Connection Compound, 
but impacts can be reduced to negligible significance with the 
application of the mitigation measures set out for construction phase. 
4.2.18 
In the event that the Electrical Connection Compound is comprised of a 
gas insulated substation, procedures will be put in place to reclaim, with 
minimal losses, the SF6 gas prior to demolition or decommissioning of

the substation housing.  The impacts of decommissioning on the 
release of SF6 will therefore be negligible. 
Cumulative Impacts 
4.2.19 
For air quality, cumulative impacts generally relate to multiple schemes 
with the potential to generate emissions to air.  The impacts of third 
party combustion facilities (namely the National Grid Gas Compressor 
Station and Eye Power Station) in the vicinity of the Power Generation 
Plant Site are implicitly included in the baseline and operational impact 
assessments. 
4.2.20 
Cumulative impacts during operation of the Power Generation Plant are 
possible where nearby wind turbine developments have the potential to 
affect the dispersion of the emissions from the stack(s).  As a result, the 
cumulative impacts of the Eye Airfield and Eye Wind Power Ltd wind 
turbines and the Project have been assessed using dispersion 
modelling.  This has concluded that no significant cumulative impacts 
are predicted and that the overall conclusions of the impact 
assessment hold for both the Power Generation Plant operating alone 
and in combination with nearby industrial processes. 
4.2.21 
There is also the potential for cumulative construction impacts with the 
Project during the temporary diversion of the existing overhead line in 
the vicinity of Electrical Connection Compound.  Whilst works 
associated with the overhead line diversion and the construction of the 
Electrical Connection Compound may overlap in time, no significant 
cumulative impacts are predicted since impacts from the overhead line 
will be spatially limited and works at both the same time and location 
are unlikely. 
Residual Impacts 
4.2.22 
Based on the results of the environmental assessment, taking into 
account potential mitigation measures, the air quality impacts of the 
Project will not give rise to any significant effects on sensitive habitats 
or human health during construction, operation or decommissioning. 
4.3 
Noise and Vibration 
4.3.1 
The construction, operation and decommissioning of the Project have 
the potential to impact upon local noise levels and generate vibration, 
which may impact on sensitive receptors.  
4.3.2 
A desk based assessment, a noise survey and noise modelling have 
been undertaken to make an assessment of the potential noise impacts

caused by the Project.  The full assessment for this topic is provided in 
Section 7 of the ES (Document Reference No: 6.1).  A brief summary is 
provided below. 
Baseline 
4.3.3 
The baseline noise climate in the area of the Power Generation Plant 
Site is largely dominated by road traffic during the daytime.  During the 
night time when road traffic levels reduce, a continuous low level noise 
can be heard from the Eye Power Station.  The baseline noise climate 
in the area of the Gas and Electrical Connections is largely dominated 
by road traffic during the daytime and evening, with occasional distant 
road traffic during the night time. 
4.3.4 
Background noise measurements were made at eight Noise Sensitive 
Receptors in the vicinity of the Project Site in order to determine the 
existing baseline noise climate (refer to the ES7 for further information).  
Six of these locations were concentrated on the Power Generation 
Plant Site and two on the Electrical Connection Compound Site.  These 
locations were agreed in consultation with Mid Suffolk District Council, 
Suffolk County Council and the Environment Agency. 
Assessment of Potential Impacts 
4.3.5 
For the purposes of this Noise and Vibration section, the assessments 
of the Power Generation Plant, Gas Connection and Electrical 
Connection are presented together for the Project under the headings 
of Construction, Operation and Decommissioning.  This differs from the 
general section structure described in Section 4.1 to reduce repetition. 
The Project 
Construction 
4.3.6 
Construction activity inevitably leads to some degree of noise 
disturbance at locations in close proximity to the construction activities.  
It is, however, a temporary source of noise.  Noise at the Project Site 
could arise, for example, from excavation for foundations, delivery of 
plant and trenching activities.  Based on a conservative, worst case 
assessment, where numerous large plant items are operating 
simultaneously across the Project Site, the overall impact of 
construction noise from the Project is predicted to be minor adverse at 
all noise sensitive receptor locations, which is not significant.  This 
assumes the use of best available techniques to reduce noise and the

successful implementation of an agreed Construction Environmental 
Management Plan, which would include noise reducing measures.   
4.3.7 
It is considered that the noise impact from construction traffic using 
existing local roads would be negligible, given that the increase in traffic 
flow during construction would be below 25%.  However, noise 
modelling has been conducted to determine the impact on Noise 
Sensitive Receptors from construction traffic using the Access Road 
between the A140 Junction and the Electrical Connection Compound.  
Based on the results, it is predicted that the overall impact of 
construction noise traffic using the Access Road is minor at all Noise 
Sensitive Receptors. 
4.3.8 
Vibration from construction activities (e.g. piling activities) may impact 
on adjacent buildings.  However, with the distances involved between 
the Project Site and sensitive receptors, the vibration impact is 
predicted to be negligible. 
Operation 
4.3.9 
In order to predict operational noise from the Project, noise modelling 
has been undertaken using sound power levels from representative 
plant items.  The predicted noise levels from the noise modelling 
exercise have then been compared to the measured background noise 
at the Noise Sensitive Receptors.  Note the noise modelling takes into 
account operational noise from both the Power Generation Plant and 
the AGI (part of the Gas Connection).  Operational noise from the 
Electrical Connection has not been modelled as, although there will be 
a low level electrical hum produced at the Electrical Connection 
Compound this will not be perceptible at the Noise Sensitive Receptors.  
In addition, in the event that the Electrical Connection Compound is 
comprised of a substation with gas insulated technology some low level 
noise would be produced from the operation of circuit breaker switching 
devices.  These switches would, however, have very occasional usage 
(several times in a typical year), would operate for a very short duration 
(fraction of a second) and would be housed within the substation 
building, further mitigating any noise.  
4.3.10 
Based on British Standard 4142, the assessment has shown that at 
Noise Sensitive Receptors 2 and 5 the impact of operational noise from 
the Power Generation Plant and AGI is minor adverse and not 
significant.  
4.3.11 
At Noise Sensitive Receptors 1, 3, 4, 6, 7 and 8 background noise 
levels were found to below the British Standard 4142 assessment 
threshold.  As such, these Noise Sensitive Receptors have been

assessed using a combination of British Standard 8233 and the World 
Health Organisation guidelines.   
4.3.12 
External noise levels from the Power Generation Plant and the AGI are 
well below the World Health Organisation guideline for minimal and 
moderate annoyance at Noise Sensitive Receptors 1, 3, 4, 6, 7 and 8.  
The impact of operational noise at these Noise Sensitive Receptors is 
therefore considered to be negligible. 
4.3.13 
Internal noise levels at Noise Sensitive Receptors 1, 3, 4, 6, 7 and 8 
comfortably achieve the British Standard 8223 ‘Good’ design range for 
resting and sleeping conditions in the living rooms and bedrooms of 
residential dwellings.  The impact of operational noise from the Power 
Generation Plant and AGI on internal noise levels within these Noise 
Sensitive Receptors is therefore negligible. 
4.3.14 
Detailed design will ensure that noise is mitigated as far as possible, 
through the Power Generation Plant Site and AGI layout and 
consideration of the orientation of plant items associated with higher 
sound power levels.  Inherently quiet plant items will be selected 
wherever practicable.  In addition high performance silencers will be 
fitted to achieve maximum noise attenuation on plant including gas 
turbine inlets and ductwork.  Acoustic lagging and low noise trims will 
be fitted to all pipe-work and noise generating steam valves and high 
performance acoustic enclosures will be considered for all plant items 
where practicable. 
4.3.15 
In addition, to ensure that the predicted operational noise levels are not 
exceeded, and to ensure that any breaches can be remedied, noise 
limits would be set at specific measurement locations on the boundary 
of the Project Site. 
4.3.16 
During operation, vibration effects are anticipated to be unnoticeable at 
the nearest sensitive receptors.  All plant items would also be designed 
and positioned so that they do not generate vibration impacts.  
Decommissioning  
4.3.17 
During decommissioning of the Project, similar noise impacts to those 
predicted during construction would be experienced (i.e. minor adverse 
at all receptors and not significant) assuming the application of the 
mitigation measures set out for construction phase.  As with 
construction, the vibration impact is predicted to be negligible.

4.3.18 
There is the potential for cumulative construction impacts with the 
Project during the diversion of the existing overhead line in the vicinity 
of Electrical Connection Compound and construction of the terminal 
tower.  However, provided best available techniques are used to 
minimise noise and vibration during the works the cumulative impact is 
considered to be minor, which is not significant. 
Residual Impacts 
4.3.19 
Based on the results of the environmental assessment, taking into 
account potential mitigation measures, the Project will not result in any 
likely significant noise and vibration effects during construction, 
operation or decommissioning.

Ecology 
Introduction  
4.4.1 
The construction, operation and decommissioning of the Project have 
the potential to impact upon sensitive ecological receptors.  
4.4.2 
In order to assess the current ecological conditions at the Project Site 
the following steps have been undertaken: 
• Ecological 
consultations 
with 
statutory 
and 
non-statutory 
stakeholders to understand where the areas of potential ecological 
sensitivity are located; 
• Desk studies, site walkovers and habitat classification studies 
known as “Extended Phase 1 Habitat Surveys” undertaken to 
assess the habitats present and their potential to support notable 
species at the Project Site and immediate vicinity; 
• Following the Extended Phase 1 Surveys, the resulting information 
was used to inform species specific surveys termed “Phase 2 
protected species surveys”, involving field based assessments to 
determine the presence / absence of notable species and their 
population size where present. 
4.4.3 
The study area is 10 km from the Project Site for European and 
nationally designated sites, 2 km for local/non-statutory designated 
sites and up to 1 km for desk study records of protected and notable 
species (extended to 10 km from the Project Site for bat species).  Field 
surveys were undertaken in individually defined survey areas.

4.4.4 
The full assessment for this topic is provided in Section 8 of the ES.  A 
brief summary is provided below. 
Baseline 
4.4.5 
The assessments undertaken have identified sensitive ecological areas 
and species in close proximity to the Project Site, including a number of 
statutory designated sites (see Figure 8.1 (Document Reference 6.3).  
Thirteen statutory designated sites were identified within 10 km of the 
Project Site.  Of these the following seven are considered to be within 
the zone of influence for ecology, although none are located within the 
Project Site: Redgrave and Lopham Fens Ramsar Site, Site of Special 
Scientific Interest and National Nature Reserve; Waveney & Little Ouse 
Valley Fens Special Area of Conservation; Major Farm, Braiseworth 
Special Scientific Interest; Gypsy Camp Meadows, Thrandeston 
Special Scientific Interest; and The Pennings, Eye Local Nature 
Reserve. 
4.4.6 
Three non-statutory designated sites are also present within 2 km of 
the Project Site (see Figure 8.2 (Document Reference 6.3): Braiseworth 
Wood / Stegall’s Wood County Wildlife Site, Suffolk Wildlife Trust 
Reserve; Mellis Common County Wildlife Site; and Thrandeston Marsh 
County Wildlife Site. 
4.4.7 
A large proportion of the Project Site is situated within arable farmland, 
which is of limited nature conservation value.  More valuable habitats 
present include species-rich hedgerow with trees, species-poor 
hedgerow with trees, species-poor intact hedgerow, semi-natural 
broadleaved woodland and two standing water bodies (Yaxley Lake 
and adjacent wet ditch to the south)  
4.4.8 
Phase 2 protected species surveys were undertaken for badgers, bats, 
breeding birds, reptiles and great crested newts.  The surveys recorded 
locally important populations of foraging and commuting bats, wintering 
birds and brown hares. The breeding bird assemblage of the Project 
Site is considered to be of district level importance.   
4.4.9 
Great crested newts were recorded within one pond approximately 1 
km to the north of the Project Site; however a number of water bodies 
within the survey area could not be surveyed due to access and / or 
health and safety restriction limitations.  Given this a precautionary 
approach has been adopted whereby a medium population of great 
crested newts is assumed present in all suitable habitats (which are 
limited within the Project Site to field margins).   Further detailed great 
crested newt surveys will be carried out to inform the need for a 
European Protected Species Mitigation Licence for the Project.  Should

great crested newts be found present a European Protected Species 
Mitigation Licence application will be produced and submitted to 
Natural England for consideration. 
4.4.10 
A small proportion of the habitat within the Project Site may be suitable 
for grass snake.  Mitigation would therefore be implemented during the 
construction phase of the Project in line with their legal protection and 
as good ecological practice. 
Assessment of Potential Impacts 
Power Generation Plant  
Construction 
4.4.11 
During construction, potential impacts on ecological receptors could 
occur from habitat loss or disturbance, increased noise and vibration, 
increased dust, or accidental release of water-borne pollutants.  The 
impacts could lead to effects on habitats within and adjacent to the 
Power Generation Plant Site.   
4.4.12 
Construction activities could also result in disturbance or incidental 
mortality of species using habitats within and adjacent to the Power 
Generation Plant, principally brown hares, foraging and commuting 
bats, breeding birds and wintering birds.  Note the Power Generation 
Plant Site would not result in the loss, fragmentation or destruction of 
any suitable great crested newt habitat. 
4.4.13 
A variety of measures would be used to avoid, minimise and mitigate 
impacts.  These include embedded measures within the design of the 
Project, such as altering the layout to reduce the impact on ecological 
receptors, as well as the successful implementation of an agreed 
Construction Environmental Management Plan, which would include 
pollution control measures.  In addition, the landscaping strategy will 
incorporate significant hedgerow and woodland habitat planting which 
will provide a net gain in habitat quality, and will also improve the green 
infrastructure (habitat connectivity) across the arable landscape. 
4.4.14 
Following the implementation of mitigation, no significant adverse 
effects on ecological receptors are predicted during construction of the 
Power Generation Plant.  
Operation  
4.4.15 
During operation of the Power Generation Plant, the main potential 
impacts to ecology would arise from stack emissions impacting on

- 56 - 
 
ecologically sensitive sites.  This is through deposition of nitrogen and 
acidification to habitats.  An increase in nitrogen deposition above the 
critical load can cause a change in plant communities.  An increase in 
acid deposition above the critical load can cause a decrease in soil 
base saturation and may cause toxicity to plants.  However, the 
specified stack height for the Power Generation Plant will ensure that 
any impacts on ecological receptors are negligible and not significant.   
4.4.16 
Other potential impacts during operation include increased light spill 
and noise affecting brown hares, foraging and commuting bats, 
breeding birds and wintering birds.  The lighting scheme for the Power 
Generation Plant will ensure minimal light spillage and directional 
lighting therefore ensuring that compensatory habitat is not lit and 
suitable for use as nesting, commuting and refuge for wildlife.  
Following appropriate mitigation, impacts are not expected to lead to 
significant adverse effects on ecological receptors. 
Decommissioning 
4.4.17 
During decommissioning, similar impacts to those predicted during 
construction 
may 
be 
experienced 
as 
the 
construction 
and 
decommissioning phases would involve similar activities. 
Gas Connection  
Construction  
4.4.18 
The majority of the potential impacts associated with the construction of 
the Gas Connection would be temporary in nature and related to 
habitat disturbance whilst the trench is being excavated and the 
Pipeline laid.  The habitats present, including arable land, grassland, 
scrub and trees, would be reinstated following installation of the 
Pipeline, and would be restored to match pre-existing habitats as 
closely as possible.  Where the Pipeline runs parallel to a species-rich 
hedgerow with trees, which borders the arable field adjacent to the 
former Eye Airfield runway, root protection zones will be demarked 
within which construction activities will not be undertaken.  This will 
help prevent damage to the root systems and soil compaction around 
the base of the trees. 
4.4.19 
Construction activities could also result in disturbance / displacement of 
species including brown hares, foraging and commuting bats, breeding 
birds, wintering birds and great crested newts. 
4.4.20 
A variety of measures would be used to avoid, minimise and mitigate 
impacts.  These include embedded measures within the design of the

Project, such as altering the layout to reduce the impact on ecological 
receptors, as well as the successful implementation of an agreed 
Construction Environmental Management Plan, which would include 
pollution control measures.  In addition, the landscaping strategy will 
incorporate significant hedgerow and woodland habitat planting which 
will provide a net gain in habitat quality, and will also improve the green 
infrastructure (habitat connectivity) across the arable landscape. 
4.4.21 
If great crested newts are found to be present during further survey 
work, a European Protected Species Mitigation Licence application will 
be produced and submitted to Natural England for consideration.  
Mitigation embedded in the landscaping proposals follows Natural 
England Great Crested Newt guidance.  Further discussions with 
Natural England would take place in the event that Great Crested Newt 
presence is confirmed in future surveys. 
4.4.22 
Following the implementation of mitigation, no significant adverse 
effects on ecological receptors are predicted during construction of the 
Gas Connection. 
Operation 
4.4.23 
The AGI would be situated within 50 m of a species-poor hedgerow 
with trees, however this habitat is not considered to be sensitive to any 
indirect operational impacts (such as increased traffic, noise, vibration, 
lighting) and, as such, operational effects to this ecological receptor are 
considered to be negligible and not significant. 
4.4.24 
Lighting at the AGI will introduce new lighting into a predominantly 
arable landscape potentially affecting brown hares, foraging and 
commuting bats, breeding birds and wintering birds.  The lighting 
scheme for the Above Ground Installation will ensure minimal light 
spillage and directional lighting therefore ensuring that compensatory 
habitat is not lit and suitable for use as nesting, commuting and refuge 
for wildlife.  Following appropriate mitigation, impacts are not expected 
to lead to significant adverse effects on ecological receptors. 
4.4.25 
It is anticipated that there would be no other impacts on ecology from 
operation of the Gas Connection. 
Decommissioning  
4.4.26 
Any decommissioning work associated with the AGI is likely to result in 
similar impacts to those predicted during construction as the 
construction and decommissioning phases would involve similar 
activities.  The Pipeline would most likely be left in-situ.

Electrical Connection  
Construction  
4.4.27 
During construction of the Electrical Connection, potential impacts on 
ecological receptors could occur from habitat loss or disturbance, 
increased noise and vibration, increased dust, or accidental release of 
water-borne pollutants. 
4.4.28 
In order to create the A140 Junction for the Access Road there is 
potential for fragmentation of hedgerows and loss of small sections of 
hedgerow.  A total of 254.6 m of hedgerow within the Electrical 
Connection Compound Site will be lost during the construction phase.  
A further 10 m of hedgerow will be lost along the Old Norwich Road to 
construct the Access Road.  To mitigate for these impacts, the 
landscaping strategy for the Project will incorporate significant 
hedgerow and woodland habitat planting which will provide a net gain 
in habitat quantity and quality, and will also improve the green 
infrastructure (habitat connectivity) across the arable landscape.  In 
addition, to avoid further habitat loss or fragmentation to hedgerows, 
Horizontal Directional Drilling will be used to install the Cable 
underneath the hedgerow to the south of Yaxley Lake. 
4.4.29 
Construction activities could also result in disturbance / displacement of 
species including brown hares, foraging and commuting bats, breeding 
birds, wintering birds and great crested newts. 
4.4.30 
Impacts would be minimised through embedded measures within the 
design of the Project, such as altering the layout to reduce the impact 
on ecological receptors, as well as the successful implementation of an 
agreed Construction Environmental Management Plant.  In addition, 
the landscaping strategy will incorporate significant hedgerow and 
woodland habitat planting which will provide a net gain in habitat 
quality, and will also improve the green infrastructure (habitat 
connectivity) across the arable landscape. 
4.4.31 
If great crested newts are found to be present during further survey 
work, a European Protected Species Mitigation Licence application will 
be produced and submitted to Natural England for consideration.  .  
Mitigation embedded in the landscaping proposals follows Natural 
England Great Crested Newt guidance.  Further discussions with 
Natural England would take place in the event that Great Crested Newt 
presence is confirmed in future surveys.

4.4.32 
Given the above, following the implementation of mitigation, no 
significant adverse effects on ecological receptors are predicted during 
construction of the Electrical Connection. 
Operation  
4.4.33 
The Access Road and A140 Junction would be installed immediately 
adjacent to Yaxley Lake to the west of the A140.  Use of the Access 
Road and A140 Junction during operation could lead to the run-off of 
oils and other pollutants into the water body.  The road drainage design 
will therefore not allow road drainage to enter Yaxley Lake. 
4.4.34 
Lighting at the Electrical Connection Compound would introduce new 
lighting into a predominantly arable landscape potentially affecting 
brown hares, foraging and commuting bats, breeding birds and 
wintering birds.  The lighting scheme for the Electrical Connection 
Compound will ensure minimal light spillage and directional lighting 
therefore ensuring that compensatory habitat is not lit and suitable for 
use as nesting, commuting and refuge for wildlife.  Following 
appropriate mitigation, impacts are not expected to lead to significant 
adverse effects on ecological receptors. 
4.4.35 
The Electrical Connection Compound is located approximately 50 m 
from a water body which may be suitable for great crested newts.  The 
Project drainage will be designed so that there is no risk of run-off or 
contamination into surrounding water bodies or other habitats, thereby 
avoiding any adverse impacts. 
4.4.36 
It is anticipated that there would be no other impacts on ecology from 
operation of the Electrical Connection. 
Decommissioning  
4.4.37 
Any decommissioning work associated with the Electrical Connection is 
likely to result in similar impacts to those predicted during construction 
as the construction and decommissioning phases would involve similar 
activities.  The Cable would most likely be left in-situ. 
Cumulative Impacts 
4.4.38 
No adverse significant residual effects have been identified as a result 
of the construction or operation of the Project, and as such it follows 
that there will be no cumulative effects in combination with other 
projects in the vicinity, namely the overhead line diversion works and 
Triodos Renewables and Wind Power Renewables Ltd. Wind Farms.

Residual Impacts 
4.4.39 
There are potential impacts to ecological receptors during construction, 
operation and decommissioning of the Project.  Where significant 
adverse effects are anticipated appropriate mitigation has been 
identified, thereby ensuring no significant net loss of ecological habitats 
and no significant detrimental effects to any of the protected species 
populations.  Residual effects for ecological receptors are therefore 
considered to be either not significant or to deliver positive effects. 
4.5 
Water Quality and Resources 
Introduction 
4.5.1 
The construction, operation and decommissioning of the Project have 
the potential to impact upon local water quality and water resources. 
Although the Power Generation Plant would utilise air cooling, 
substantially reducing the need for water during operation, limited 
amounts of water would still be required for processes such as turbine 
blade cleaning. 
4.5.2 
A desk based assessment and site visit has been carried out in order to 
identify all surface water bodies within the vicinity of the Project Site, as 
well as any areas of vulnerability and previous pollution incidents which 
may have impacted on water bodies. 
4.5.3 
The full assessment for this topic is provided in Section 9 of the ES and 
a separate Flood Risk Assessment has been prepared (Document 
Reference 5.4). A brief summary is provided below. 
Baseline 
4.5.4 
The main water bodies within the vicinity of the Project Site are 
considered to be (see Figure 9.1(Document Reference 6.3): 
• 
River Dove, the closest Main River to the Project, which flows from 
southwest to northeast, approximately 2 km east of the Power 
Generation Plant Site; 
• 
Unnamed culverted watercourse to the north of the Power 
Generation Plant Site; 
• 
Castleton Way Highway Drain, located immediately south of the 
Gas Connection Route Corridor and approximately 280 m west of 
the AGI;

• 
Water body 2 - A140 Drain (east side), located approximately 695 
m south west of the Power Generation Plant Site running 
intermittently along the field boundary to the east of the A140; 
• 
Water body 3 – Yaxley Lake, located approximately 665 m south 
west of the Power Generation Plant Site; 
• 
Water body 4 – Small pond south of Yaxley Lake, located 
immediately south of the Electrical Connection Route Corridor; 
• 
Water body 5 – Field drain, located approximately 15 m south of 
the Electrical Connection Route Corridor, running along a field 
boundary to the south of Yaxley Lake; 
• 
Water body 6 – Small pond within agricultural fields, located 
approximately 50 m south of the Electrical Connection Route 
Corridor and approximately 260 m west of the A140; 
• 
Water body 7 - Channel north of The Leys, located approximately 
50m north west of the Electrical Connection Compound, originating 
from field drains through agricultural fields. 
4.5.5 
The bedrock of the Project Site is classified as a Principal Aquifer, 
which provides water for agricultural and industrial use.  The Project 
Site also falls within a Groundwater Source Protection Zone, which 
denotes an aquifer that is used for public potable water supply.  
Activities within the Source Protection Zone are controlled by the 
Environment Agency to reduce contaminations risks. 
Assessment of Potential Impacts 
Power Generation Plant  
Construction  
4.5.6 
A small amount of water would be required each day for general 
construction works (e.g. wheel washing and dust suppression) and 
hygiene.  It is likely that this water will be brought in by bowser and 
therefore no surface water or groundwater abstraction will be required.  
In addition, in order to avoid the need for a local water supply, ready 
mixed concrete will be delivered to site.  The impact of construction on 
water use from local sources will therefore be negligible. 
4.5.7 
The main potential impacts that may result from construction of the 
Power Generation Plant are the risk of contaminated material entering 
a surface water body through natural surface runoff from the Power 
Generation Plant Site.  There are not anticipated to be any impacts on 
the water bodies listed above as the majority are located a significant 
distance from the Power Generation Plant Site and therefore will not be

- 62 - 
 
directly impacted during construction.  The potential to impact upon 
groundwater is also considered negligible.  Best practice would be 
employed during construction to protect the water environment, in 
accordance with guidelines published by the Environment Agency. 
Operation  
4.5.8 
The largest operational demand for water in the majority of UK power 
stations is cooling.  However the Power Generation Plant will be air 
cooled therefore water use on-site will be limited to NOx control, 
potable water for drinking and sanitation purposes and plant washing.  
If water is required for NOx control a considerable amount of water 
would be required and it is not considered appropriate to tanker such a 
quantity to the site.  As such, a permanent water supply will be sought 
and agreed with the local water supplier (Essex and Suffolk Water).  If 
such a supply cannot be guaranteed, Dry Low NOx gas turbine 
generators will be used to reduce the water requirement of the plant. 
4.5.9 
The Power Generation Plant Site will be equipped with a surface water 
drainage system and a sewerage system.  The surface water drainage 
system will discharge into an attenuation pond in the north of the Power 
Generation Plant Site.  Before reaching the main sewerage network the 
runoff will pass through oil interceptors.  The impacts on water bodies 
from accidental spillages and leaks will therefore be negligible. 
4.5.10 
The Project will lead to an increase in the amount of runoff from within 
the Power Generation Plant Site boundary due to the increase in 
hardstanding.  However this additional runoff will be captured by the 
surface water drainage system so that there is no impact on the 
surrounding land. 
Based on the assessment, following the implementation of mitigation, it 
is predicted that there would be a negligible impact on water quality and 
resources during operation of the Power Generation Plant. 
Decommissioning 
4.5.11 
During decommissioning, similar impacts to those predicted during 
construction may be experienced. 
Gas Connection  
Construction 
4.5.12 
The Gas Connection is located within close proximity to two water 
bodies, which could be at risk due to potential contamination of surface

water runoff.  Best practice would, however, be followed and an agreed 
Construction Environmental Management Plan implemented. 
4.5.13 
Prior to operation, the Pipeline will be tested by closing off the ends, 
filling it with water and increasing the pressure to a pre-determined 
level higher than the pressure at which it is designed to operate.  The 
water used for this operation would likely be tankered to and from site, 
from where it will be disposed at a suitable disposal facility. 
4.5.14 
It is therefore considered that construction of the Gas Connection will 
have negligible impacts on water quality and water resources in the 
area. 
Operation  
4.5.15 
During operation, there would be negligible impacts on water quality 
and resources from the operation of the Gas Connection. 
Decommissioning  
4.5.16 
During decommissioning, it is likely that the AGI will be removed.  As 
such, similar impacts to those predicted during construction may be 
experienced. 
Electrical Connection  
Construction  
4.5.17 
Installation of the Cable requires the crossing of two surface water 
bodies, however these will be crossed using Horizontal Directional 
Drilling in order to ensure that there is no interaction between the water 
body and the construction works. 
4.5.18 
The Access Road will also cross one water body; water body 4, the 
small pond south of Yaxley Lake and lies in close proximity to water 
body 3, Yaxley Lake.  The Access Road may therefore cause a 
reduction in the overall extent of water body 4 resulting in a minor 
impact, although this is not considered significant.  In addition, Yaxley 
Lake could be at risk due to potential contamination of surface water 
runoff.  Best practice would, however, be followed including the 
implementation 
of 
an 
approved 
Construction 
Environmental 
Management Plan resulting in a negligible impact. 
4.5.19 
The construction of the Electrical Connection Compound will require a 
number of activities similar to those described for the construction of 
the Power Generation Plant, including large excavations, but would not 
result in any significant effects on water quality or resources.

Operation  
4.5.20 
During operation, the impact on water resources arising from the 
operation of the Electrical Connection is considered to be negligible as 
the Cable will be buried and water usage at the Electrical Connection 
Compound is expected to be minimal. 
4.5.21 
The Access Road along the Electrical Connection Route Corridor will 
result in the generation of additional surface water runoff.  However, 
this is likely to be minimal and would be controlled with an appropriately 
designed drainage system.  In addition, as the Access Road would 
impinge on the north edge of water body 4 there is the potential for 
spillages or dust generation from vehicle movements along the Access 
Road to impact on this water body.  Given the low value of water body 
4 it is likely that such impacts would have a slight adverse impact upon 
the water body. 
Decommissioning  
4.5.22 
During decommissioning, similar impacts to those predicted during 
construction may be experienced. 
Cumulative Impacts 
4.5.23 
There is the potential for cumulative construction impacts with the 
Project during the diversion of the existing overhead line in the vicinity 
of Electrical Connection Compound.  These impacts would be as a 
result of the movement of construction vehicles along the line of the 
overhead line in the vicinity of the Electrical Connection Compound 
Site.  However, provided best practice is followed no significant impacts 
are predicted. 
Residual Impacts 
4.5.24 
Based on the results of the environmental assessment, taking into 
account potential mitigation measures, construction, operation and 
decommissioning of the Project will not result in any likely significant 
effects on water quality or water resources. 
4.6 
Geology, Ground Conditions and Agriculture 
Introduction 
4.6.1 
The construction, operation and decommissioning of the Project has 
the potential to impact upon geology, ground conditions and agriculture.  
The Project also has the potential to result in impacts from

contamination (existing or created) on human health and sensitive 
ecological receptors. 
4.6.2 
A desk based assessment has been carried out to assess the baseline 
geology and ground conditions underlying the Project Site.  The 
assessment studied information regarding previous land uses of the 
Project Site and the surrounding area, the soils and geology present at 
the Project Site and any potential contamination issues resulting from 
former site uses, including unexploded ordnance. 
4.6.3 
A Conceptual Site Model approach has been used to assess the risk 
posed by contaminants on human health and other sensitive receptors.  
This examines the potential sources of contamination (e.g. historical 
sources), the potential receptors that could be affected (e.g. soil and 
construction workers) and the pathways to these receptors (e.g. 
leaching in surface water and inhalation of airborne contaminants). 
4.6.4 
The full assessment for this topic is provided in Section 10 of the ES. A 
brief summary is provided below. 
Baseline 
4.6.5 
Ground conditions across the Project Site comprise Chalk overlain 
unconformably by the sands of the Crag Formation and drift deposits of 
Lowestoft Glacial Till.  The drift deposits are classed as unproductive 
strata, likely due to the high clay content.  These are geological strata 
with low permeability that have negligible significance for water supply 
or river base flow.  The soils at the Project Site are therefore likely to be 
moderately to poorly drained. 
4.6.6 
The Project Site overlies a Principal Aquifer.  The nearest active 
groundwater abstraction to the Project Site is located approximately 
480 m south and is listed for general farming and domestic / agriculture 
(general) use and is sourced from the Chalk Aquifer.  Although this is a 
sensitive receptor it is considered likely to be up hydraulic gradient of 
the Project Site. 
4.6.7 
The desk based assessment has identified that historical / registered 
landfills, licensed waste management facilities and waste treatment or 
disposal sites are not considered to present significant risks of ground 
contamination due to their distance (at least 300 m) and location down 
regional hydraulic gradient of the Project Site. 
4.6.8 
Due the Project Site’s former use as an airfield during World War 2 a 
specialist unexploded ordnance desk study has been undertaken.  The 
results of the study classify the majority of the Project Site as low risk

for unexploded ordnance, although part of the Gas Connection is 
classified as moderate risk as this area was reportedly used for a bomb 
dump when the former Eye Airfield was operational. 
4.6.9 
The Project Site has moderate agricultural value, although it is 
considered unlikely to be classified as ‘best and most versatile land’. 
Assessment of Potential Impacts 
Power Generation Plant  
Construction 
4.6.10 
During construction of the Power Generation Plant, the main potential 
impacts on geology, ground conditions and agricultural would be from: 
• Disturbance of existing contamination and creation of pollution 
pathways;  
• Disturbance to or loss of deposits of geology, soils and agricultural 
land; and  
• Creation of pollution incidents from e.g. spillages. 
4.6.11 
At the pre-construction stage a geoenvironmental site investigation 
would be conducted across the Project Site to confirm the baseline 
conditions.  During construction stringent mitigation measures such as 
working within best practice guidelines and adhering to a detailed 
Construction Environmental Management Plan will be employed to 
prevent any contamination or pollution incidents.  As such, effects on 
construction workers, surrounding land uses, controlled waters 
(Principal Aquifer and surface water bodies) and the built environment 
are expected to be negligible and not significant. 
4.6.12 
The construction of the Power Generation Plant will result in loss of 
approximately 5.37 ha of moderate agricultural value land, with an 
additional 2.28 ha of land, directly south of the Power Generation Plant, 
used during construction for the construction and maintenance 
compound.  This is considered to be a significant adverse impact, 
however, this area of land has been designated as a Strategic Site for 
development by Mid Suffolk District Council and is likely to be lost to 
some form of development in the near future.  In addition, as part of the 
embedded design mitigation, land take has been minimised wherever 
possible.

4.6.13 
During operation there are anticipated to be negligible impacts to end 
users (site workers) from contaminated soils as the Power Generation 
Plant Site would be predominantly covered with hardstanding with 
limited areas of softstanding.  There will also be negligible impacts to 
off-site human receptors due to reduced dust production compared with 
the current baseline.  No other impacts on geology and ground 
conditions are anticipated. 
4.6.14 
The loss of 5.37 ha of moderate agricultural value land for the 
operational life of the Power Generation Plant is considered to be a 
significant adverse impact. 
Decommissioning 
4.6.15 
During decommissioning, stringent mitigation measures such as 
working within best practice guidelines and adhering to a detailed 
Environmental Management Plan will be employed to prevent any 
contamination 
or 
pollution 
incidents. 
 
As 
such, 
effects 
on 
decommissioning workers, surrounding land uses and controlled waters 
(Principal Aquifer and surface water bodies) are expected to be 
negligible and not significant. 
4.6.16 
Any future land use will be determined by planning policy at the time 
and therefore any impact to agricultural land cannot be determined at 
this time. 
Gas Connection  
Construction 
4.6.17 
During the excavation process there is risk associated with the 
possibility of unidentified unexploded ordnance buried below ground in 
the eastern part of the Gas Connection Site.  This will be managed via 
the use of Explosive Ordnance Clearance operatives during both the 
geoenvironmental investigation and construction phases, as required. 
4.6.18 
During construction stringent mitigation measures such as working 
within best practice guidelines and adhering to a detailed Construction 
Environmental Management Plan will be employed to prevent any 
contamination or pollution incidents.  As such, effects on construction 
workers, surrounding land uses, controlled waters (Principal Aquifer 
and surface water bodies) and the built environment are expected to be

construction phase.  The total area of land is approximately 6.15 ha.  
This is considered to be a significant local adverse impact. 
Operation 
4.6.20 
During operation of the Gas Connection there are anticipated to be 
negligible effects on end users (site workers) with limited or no 
exposure to ground contamination.  No other impacts on geology and 
ground conditions are predicted. 
4.6.21 
The agricultural land within the Gas Connection Route Corridor would 
be reinstated and would be able to be farmed normally.  The site of the 
AGI (approximately 1.1 ha) would be lost for agricultural use.  This is 
considered to be a significant adverse impact. 
Decommissioning  
4.6.22 
Decommissioning of the AGI may result in exposure to contaminants in 
soil (dermal, oral, inhalation of dust), although this is likely to be limited 
as the service corridors etc. will be backfilled with inert backfill and 
exposure will be mitigated through the implementation of industry 
standard best practice.  Stringent mitigation measures such as working

4.6.25 
The construction of the Electrical Connection will result in loss of 
approximately 11.53 ha of moderate agricultural value land.  This is 
considered to be a significant adverse impact.  This area may be 
reduced by up to approximately 0.50 ha if a gas insulated substation is 
constructed, as opposed to an air insulated substation. 
Operation  
4.6.26 
During operation of the Electrical Connection there are anticipated to 
be negligible effects on end users (site workers) with limited or no 
exposure to ground contamination.  No other impacts on geology and 
ground conditions are predicted. 
4.6.27 
The agricultural land within the Electrical Connection Route Corridor 
would be reinstated and be able to be farmed normally.  A total of 7.51 
ha of agricultural land will, however, be lost in the Access Road Site, 
A140 Junction Site and Electrical Connection Compound Site.  This is 
considered to be a significant adverse impact.  This area may be 
reduced by up to approximately 0.50 ha if a gas insulated substation is 
constructed, as opposed to an air insulated substation. 
Decommissioning  
4.6.28 
Decommissioning of the Electrical Connection Compound may result in 
exposure to contaminants in soil (dermal, oral, inhalation of dust), 
although this is likely to be limited as the service corridors etc. will be 
backfilled with inert backfill and exposure will be mitigated through the

Cumulative Impacts

There is the potential for cumulative construction impacts with the 
Project during the diversion of the existing overhead line in the vicinity 
of Electrical Connection Compound.  An estimate of the additional 
agricultural land loss during construction and operation is undetermined

at this stage, although effects during construction and operation are 
considered to be large. 
Residual Impacts 
4.6.31 
Based on the results of the environmental assessment, taking into 
account potential mitigation measures, construction, operation and 
decommissioning of the Project is predicted to result in a residual slight 
adverse impact on geology and ground conditions.  The residual impact 
on agriculture, however, during construction and operation of the 
Project is anticipated to be large on a local scale as a result of the loss 
of agricultural land. 
4.7 
Landscape and Visual Impacts 
Introduction 
4.7.1 
The construction, operation and decommissioning of the Project has 
the potential to impact upon the landscape character and visual 
amenity of the area. 
4.7.2 
A desk based assessment and site visit along with compilation of 
photomontages have been undertaken to determine the baseline 
landscape character of the area and the sensitive receptors which may 
be impacted by the Project in a 15 km study area.  Areas with potential 
views of the Project have been defined through site survey, the extent 
of which have been shown on Zone of Theoretical Visibility maps. 
4.7.3 
The full assessment for this topic is provided in Section 11 of the ES. A 
brief summary is provided below. 
Baseline 
4.7.4 
The area in the immediate vicinity of the Power Generation Plant Site 
and Gas Connection Site comprises medium to large scale industrial 
development within the former Eye Airfield (Eye Airfield Industrial 
Estate and Mid Suffolk Business Park), and is surrounded by semi-rural 
landscape that includes arable farmland, the A140 major transport 
route, prominent pylons and an overhead transmission line, and small 
villages / farmsteads.  Mature tree belts and hedgerows within the 
former Eye Airfield reduce views of existing industrial development. 
4.7.5 
The Electrical Connection would be sited within agricultural land 
characterised by a strong, historic field pattern, comprising small to 
medium scale rectangular fields enclosed by hedgerows and small 
copses.  The topography of the surrounding area is generally flat which,

in combination with existing field hedges and woodland, limits views of 
the site. 
4.7.6 
There are no nationally designated landscapes within the 15 km study 
area, although two locally important Special Landscape Areas, 
designated by Mid Suffolk District Council, are located within the study 
area: River Dove, which runs south-west to north-east on the eastern 
side of the study area and River Waveney which runs west to east 
across the northern part of the study area. 
4.7.7 
A well developed network of Public Rights of Way also lies within the 
inner part of the study area. 
Assessment of Potential Impacts 
Power Generation Plant 
Construction 
4.7.8 
The main potential sources of landscape and visual impacts during 
construction of the Power Generation Plant are: site clearance works, 
earthworks, vegetation removal, construction traffic and construction 
lighting.  The construction compounds and activities would temporarily 
disturb an area of agricultural land, which would be reinstated on 
completion of the works.  There will be a loss of agricultural land within 
the footprint of the built development.  Tall structures, such as the 
construction cranes and the upper portions of the stacks, would be 
seen in the context of other taller, more prominent vertical industrial 
structures within the former Eye Airfield.  These include the 130 m high 
wind turbines, ~50 m high National Grid Gas Compressor Station mast 
and 40 m high Eye Power Station stack.  It is therefore predicted that 
during construction there would be a short term moderate adverse 
impact to the landscape and a short term moderate adverse visual 
impact from two viewpoints to the south of the Power Generation Plant. 
Operation 
4.7.9 
During operation, impacts on landscape and visual amenity will result 
from introduction of permanent structures, particularly the stacks of the 
Power Generation Plant, which would be the largest structure on the 
Power Generation Plant Site.  Agricultural land would be lost 
permanently from the Power Generation Plant Site and replaced by 
built elements and hard surfacing. 
4.7.10 
Woodland planting associated with the National Grid Gas Compressor 
Station and other existing structures will largely screen the Power

Generation Plant from the north, north-east and north-west.  There will, 
however, be an indirect effect on the landscape character of areas to 
the south and south-east of the Power Generation Plant Site from 
where views of the Power Generation Plant would be available.  The 
areas include sections of public footpaths and residential development 
on the north western edge of Eye in particular. 
4.7.11 
As part of the iterative design process for the Project, primary mitigation 
relating to the design has been developed with reference to potential 
effects.  Where specific residual adverse effects of the Project cannot 
be designed out, mitigation in the form of landscaping and planting has 
been developed.  Mitigation planting has been developed to fulfil 
landscape and ecological objectives and to enhance landscape and 
biodiversity where possible. 
4.7.12 
Localised effects arising from the Power Generation Plant would be of 
moderate significance at commissioning when mitigation planting would 
have some visual impact but would not provide an effective screen.  At 
maturity (around 15 years after planting), the planting would integrate 
with adjacent woodland planting surrounding the National Grid Gas 
Compressor Station and Eye Power Station to provide a significant 
woodland belt.  It would screen the smaller structures and ground level 
activities leaving only the upper elevation of the turbines and stacks 
visible. 
4.7.13 
The residual landscape and visual impact during operation of the 
Power Generation Plant is therefore not predicted to be significant and 
there would be a minor beneficial impact from mitigation woodland / 
hedgerow screen planting. 
Decommissioning 
4.7.14 
During decommissioning, temporary activities likely to affect landscape 
and visual receptors would take place over a period of several months, 
similar to those described for construction.  Landscape restoration and 
management plans would be submitted for agreement with Mid Suffolk 
District Council prior to commencement of any demolition works.  The 
landscape and visual impact is predicted to be negligible and not 
significant. 
4.7.15 
Gas Connection 
Construction 
4.7.16 
Sources of impact during construction would be similar to those 
described above in relation to the Power Generation Plant.  However,

the visual impact of the construction works would be more prominent 
due to the close proximity with Castleton Way and the settlement of 
Yaxley. 
4.7.17 
The construction works would be sited within open, rural landscape that 
is visually sensitive to change of this nature.  Approximately 0.32 ha of 
agricultural land would be temporarily displaced in order to construct 
the Pipeline and to accommodate the construction works.  Removal of 
hedgerows and trees to construct the Pipeline would have a direct 
effect on landscape elements and National Grid planting constraints in 
the vicinity of the Pipeline may prevent their reinstatement.  There 
would also be a permanent displacement of approximately 0.2 ha 
agricultural land for the AGI and mitigation planting. 
4.7.18 
It is therefore predicted that during construction of the Gas Connection 
there would be a short term moderate adverse impact to the landscape 
and a short term large adverse visual impact from one viewpoint to the 
south (Hall Farm, Public Right of Way, Yaxley), due to combined 
impacts with the Power Generation Plant. 
4.7.19 
Operation 
4.7.20 
During operation, long term landscape and visual impacts would arise 
from the AGI.  The introduction of the proposed industrial structures up 
to 3 m high, perimeter security fencing and hard surfacing will add man-
made elements to a rural, agricultural landscape where no similar 
structures currently exist.   
4.7.21 
The AGI would be visible from the wider landscape to the south.  
Extensive structure planting will be undertaken on all boundaries, along 
with new hedgerow planting adjacent to Castleton Way and Potash 
Lane.  The proposed rectangular block of screen planting around the 
AGI would, however, be uncharacteristic of the surrounding vegetation 
pattern until it integrated with adjoining new hedgerow planting on 
Castleton Way and Potash Lane. 
4.7.22 
In the longer term, when mitigation planting had established (after 
approximately 5 - 7 years), views of the AGI would be screened from 
nearby receptors, including residents at the edges of settlements 
located south, south-west and south-east of the Project Site at Yaxley 
and Eye. 
4.7.23 
It is therefore predicted that during operation of the Gas Connection 
there would be a moderate adverse impact on the landscape, with a 
localised effect up to 1 km, reducing to a slight adverse impact after 5 – 
7 years when mitigation planting had established.  There would also be

- 74 - 
 
a moderate adverse visual impact from the viewpoint to the south (Hall 
Farm, Public Right of Way, Yaxley), but again this impact would be 
reduced when mitigation planting had established.  The mitigation 
screen planting would result in a minor beneficial impact.  The residual 
impact is therefore considered to be slight adverse and not significant. 
Decommissioning 
4.7.24 
During decommissioning, temporary activities likely to affect landscape 
and visual receptors would take place over a period of several months, 
similar to those described for construction.  Landscape restoration and 
management plans would be submitted for agreement with Mid Suffolk 
District Council prior to commencement of any demolition works.  The 
residual impact is predicted to be moderate adverse, short term and not 
significant. 
4.7.25 
Electrical Connection 
Construction 
4.7.26 
During construction, potential adverse temporary landscape and visual 
impacts would arise from activities including the removal of hedgerows, 
topsoil and subsoil stripping from agricultural land, earthworks, 
construction traffic and construction lighting.  Construction plant and 
activities would be distinguishable over intervening vegetation, causing 
a change in the composition of the existing view, which is characterised 
by the existing overhead high voltage line.  There would be a loss of 
agricultural land within the footprint of the Electrical Connection 
Compound and Access Road.  Agricultural land would also be 
temporarily displaced in order to construct the Cable and to 
accommodate the construction works, although this land would 
subsequently reinstated.  Trees and hedgerows would be removed 
where ‘trenchless’ construction is impractical in the vicinity of the new 
A140 Junction.  It is therefore predicted that during construction of the 
Electrical Connection there would be a short term slight adverse impact 
on the landscape and a moderate adverse and short term visual 
impact. 
Operation 
4.7.27 
During operation, long term landscape and visual impacts would arise 
from the Electrical Connection Compound, Access Road and A140 
Junction.  The Access Road would, however, be designed to resemble 
a farm track and all land adjacent to the Access Road would be 
returned to agriculture following construction.  Depending on the 
Substation design, an air insulated substation would be more extensive

than a gas insulated substation and the structures would be visible 
through the security fence.  The footprint of a gas insulated substation 
would be significantly smaller and the majority of the industrial 
structures would be sited within buildings. 
4.7.28 
Increased industrial development associated with the Electrical 
Connection Compound and Access Road, and the corresponding loss 
of small scale arable farmland, would form a permanent noticeable 
change in the composition of near distance views from residential 
properties in Yaxley to the south and the surrounding network of Public 
Rights of Way and permissive paths. The visual impact would be 
reduced if a gas insulated substation is used.  These receptors, which 
have a high sensitivity to change of this nature, would experience long 
term moderate adverse visual impacts until mitigation planting matured 
and screened the industrial structures.  This is anticipated to occur after 
approximately 15 years. 
4.7.29 
The orientation of the Electrical Connection Compound diagonally to 
the small-scale rectangular fields would also sever the pattern of 
landscape, although it would gradually re-establish as mitigation screen 
planting matured. 
4.7.30 
It is therefore predicted that during operation of the Electrical 
Connection there would be a slight adverse impact on the landscape 
and a moderate adverse visual impact until mitigation planting is 
effective.  The mitigation screen planting would result in a minor 
beneficial impact.  The residual impact is therefore considered to be 
moderate adverse, medium term and significant. 
Decommissioning 
4.7.31 
During decommissioning, temporary activities likely to affect landscape 
and visual receptors would take place over a period of several months, 
similar to those described for construction.  Landscape restoration and 
management plans would be submitted for agreement with Mid Suffolk 
District Council prior to commencement of any demolition works.  The 
residual impact is predicted to be moderate adverse, short term and not 
significant. 
Cumulative Impacts 
4.7.32 
Potential cumulative impacts will arise from requirement to construct a 
new connection between the existing overhead electrical transmission 
lines and the new Electrical Connection Compound.  The new 
connection would be designed, constructed and operated by National 
Grid.  Short term significant cumulative visual effects would be

generated by the new connection in combination with the proposed 
Electrical Connection Compound during construction.  No significant 
cumulative visual effects would be generated by the new connection in 
combination with the proposed Electrical Connection Compound during 
operation.  The assessed significance of residual impacts at operation 
would remain as identified for the proposed Electrical Connection 
Compound (i.e. slight adverse impact on the landscape and a moderate 
adverse visual impact until mitigation planting is effective). 
Residual Impacts 
4.7.33 
Based on the results of the environmental assessment, taking into 
account potential mitigation measures, it is considered that potential 
residual landscape and visual effects would be localised due to the 
industrial character of the area surrounding the proposed Project, and 
by the extensive network of hedgerows and woodland within the vicinity 
of the Project Site.  There would, however, be moderate adverse, short 
to medium term, significant impacts associated with the operation of the 
Project, primarily associated with the AGI and Electrical Connection 
Compound given their rural location, until mitigation planting is 
effective. 
4.8 
Traffic, Transport and Access 
Introduction  
4.8.1 
The construction, operation and decommissioning of the Project have 
the potential to impact upon the local transport network, through the 
generation of additional traffic movements to the area. 
4.8.2 
Baseline traffic data was collected in October 2013 and the number of 
additional traffic movements generated during construction, operation 
and decommissioning of the Project and how these may impact on 
traffic infrastructure and safety have been assessed.  Other 
developments, such as nearby residential developments, have been 
accounted for by applying traffic growth factors. 
4.8.3 
The full assessment for this topic is provided in Section 12 of the ES. A 
brief summary is provided below. 
Baseline 
4.8.4 
The Power Generation Plant Site would be accessed from the existing 
road network via Castleton Way (an unrestricted country road) via an 
existing junction to the former main runway.  Castleton Way provides 
access to the B1077 to the east and the A140 to the west.  The A140, 
which runs north-south linking Ipswich and Norwich, is a major

- 77 - 
 
transport route from which the national road network is easily 
accessible.  For all life cycle phases of the proposed Project, it is 
proposed that access to / from Castleton Way would be mainly via the 
A140. 
4.8.5 
Access to the AGI will be taken via the Power Generation Site 
Compound Area and therefore access to this will be taken from 
Castleton Way. 
4.8.6 
Access to the Electrical Connection Compound Site is proposed via a 
new junction, the A140 Junction, consisting of a priority T-junction with 
the A140 at the location of the stopped-up Old Norwich Road, north of 
Castleton Way junction.   
4.8.7 
A footpath runs from Victoria Hill (B1077) on the east of the Project Site 
to the A140 on the west.  For part of the route, the footpath runs along 
the southern border of the Power Generation Plant Site, but then cuts 
through the Project Site when the footpath crosses the runway of the 
former airfield. 
Assessment of Potential Impacts 
Power Generation Plant 
Construction  
4.8.8 
Due to the nature of traffic interactions, the profile of construction 
workers required for the Power Generation Plant has been combined 
with that for the Gas Connection and Electrical Connection.  It is 
anticipated that a total of up to 127 workers would be required during 
the peak construction phase for the Project, which is forecast to occur 
in Quarter 5.  With a construction start date of 2017, the peak 
construction phase would therefore occur in early 2018.  The total 
construction period is estimated as being 21 months.  Assuming an 
average car occupancy of 1.6, the AM (8.00am – 9.00am) and PM 
(5.00pm – 6.00pm) peak hours are each anticipated to generate around 
41 vehicle trips to and from the Project Site. 
4.8.9 
A number of Heavy Goods Vehicles would also be required to deliver 
construction materials to the Power Generation Plant Site.  There is 
therefore the potential to impact on the surrounding road network 
through for example, temporary road closures and requirement for 
escort vehicles. However, given the temporary nature of the 
construction phase, the impacts on traffic and transport are predicted to 
be minor.  Calculations show that the peak in Heavy Goods Vehicles 
movements would occur during the first quarter of construction for the

Project, with an average of 74 vehicle trips per day being generated 
over a 3 month period.  Over the 11 hour daily period for arrivals and 
departures, this equates to just under 7 inbound and 7 outbound trips 
per hour. 
4.8.10 
From testing of the 2013 baseline traffic data and the predicted 2018 
traffic data, it is predicted that the Power Generation Plant will have no 
significant impact on the A140 corridor.  Traffic travelling northbound 
and southbound will experience similar levels of delay to the 2013 base 
year during the construction period and overall traffic speed is unlikely 
to be affected.  However, it is expected that effects will occur on the 
side roads at junctions with the A140.  All junctions within the study 
area can cope with additional traffic with the exception of  A140 / B1077 
where Project traffic at the peak of construction contributes to 
increased delay on an already over saturated junction.  No direct 
mitigation measure has been proposed as the construction traffic will 
only temporarily contribute to increased flow of only 1% on an already 
over saturated junction.  A Traffic Management Plan will, however, be 
prepared to manage construction traffic and limit potential impacts.  An 
Interim Construction Traffic Management Plan for the Project can be 
found in Appendix 12.D of the ES. 
4.8.11 
Throughout the construction phase of the Power Generation Plant, 
there may be temporary restrictions on use of the footpath that runs 
from Victoria Hill (B1077) on the east of the Project Site to the A140 on 
the west.  Two other footpath routes are available across the airfield. 
Operation 
4.8.12 
During operation of the Power Generation Plant, up to a maximum of 
15 staff are anticipated to be employed full time.  Occasional 
maintenance vehicles, deliveries and visitor access to the Power 
Generation Plant may also be required.  It is anticipated that if a mains 
supply of water is not connected, then then minimal water tankering 
may be required to deliver water to site for the operation of the Power 
Generation plant.  However, given the low volume of traffic generated 
during the operational phase, any impacts on the surrounding transport 
network will be negligible.  Nonetheless, Travel Plan measures to 
encourage sustainable transport are set out within an Interim 
Construction Worker and Operational Worker Travel Plan for the 
Project, which can be found in Appendix 12.E (Document Reference 
No: 6.2).

4.8.13 
During decommissioning, similar impacts to those predicted during 
construction would be experienced. 
Gas Connection 
Construction 
4.8.14 
The number of construction workers required to construct the Gas 
Connection would be low in relation to the Power Generation Plant.  As 
such, there is likely to be limited impacts associated with additional trips 
on the transport network.  There would be some additional traffic 
caused by the arrival and departure of construction workers and Heavy 
Goods Vehicles delivering and removing goods from the Gas 
Connection Site, however, this is anticipated to be low.   
4.8.15 
Road works will be required for the routing of the Gas Connection 
across Potash Lane and access roads within the former Eye Airfield 
site.  This will have a minor impact on surrounding road network.  A 
Traffic Management Plan will be prepared to minimise any disruption. 
Operation 
4.8.16 
Maintenance vehicles are expected to be infrequent and are not 
anticipated to cause any detriment to the local transport network. 
Decommissioning 
4.8.17 
The decommissioning stage would generate very few vehicle 
movements, as it is likely that the Gas Connection would be left in situ. 
Some elements of the AGI may be removed, although there are not 
anticipated to be any impacts on the traffic network. 
Electrical Connection 
Construction 
4.8.18 
A new access from the A140 (the A140 Junction) has been proposed to 
allow safer and easier movement of construction traffic to the Electrical 
Connection Site.  This will avoid the need for construction traffic to use 
routes in the village of Yaxley.  The number of Heavy Goods Vehicles 
required for the construction of the Electrical Connection is anticipated 
to be low compared to the Power Generation Plant with less than 10 
per day at the peak of construction activity.  This is anticipated to have 
a minor impact on the surrounding road network. 
4.8.19 
There will, however, be temporary disruption to traffic on the A140 
caused by the construction of the Access Road to the Electrical

Connection Compound.  Works on the A140 would likely last 
approximately 4 weeks and may involve temporary (night time) full 
closure of the road.  Temporary diversions routes would be agreed with 
Suffolk County Council prior to any works being carried out.  
4.8.20 
The Electrical Connection will cut across Leys Lane to the south of a 
bridleway.  Access to the Leys will be maintained by way of providing 
temporary surfacing parallel to Leys Lane during construction of the 
Electrical Connection over Leys Lane.  Alternatively, a diversion of the 
Public Right of Way could be taken via Judas Lane. 
4.8.21 
Allotments are located on the northern-most edge of Old Norwich Road 
and lie to the north of the proposed Electrical Connection Compound 
access track.  Access to the allotments will be maintained by way of 
provision of the A140 Junction or through temporary surfacing on Old 
Norwich Road if construction of the A140 Junction is underway. 
Operation 
4.8.22 
Maintenance access to the Electrical Connection Compound will be via 
the Access Road, which would connect to the A140 via the A140 
Junction.  Discussions will be held with Suffolk County Council to 
determine the ownership of the Access Road and accessibility by the 
public during operation.  During operation, maintenance vehicles are, 
however, expected to be infrequent and would therefore have a 
negligible impact on surrounding road network.   
Decommissioning  
4.8.23 
During decommissioning, similar impacts to those predicted during 
construction would be experienced. 
Cumulative Impacts 
4.8.24 
It has been concluded that there will be no cumulative impacts from 
traffic from neighbouring developments to the Project. 
Residual Impacts 
4.8.25 
Based on the results of the environmental assessment, taking into 
account potential mitigation measures, construction, operation and 
decommissioning of the Project will result in negligible or minor impacts 
on traffic, transport and access.

4.9.1 
The construction, operation and decommissioning of the Project has 
the potential to impact upon the setting and significance of Heritage 
Assets; both statutory designated such as Scheduled Monuments, 
Listed Buildings and Conservation Areas and other non-designated 
Heritage Assets. 
4.9.2 
An archaeological desk based assessment and site visit were carried 
out as part of the archaeological assessment which considered an 
inner study area (extending 1 km from the edge of the Project Site) and 
outer study area (extending 5 km from the centre of the Project Site).  A 
geophysical survey was also carried within and around the Project Site 
in order to detect areas of archaeological potential. 
4.9.3 
The full assessment for this topic is provided in Section 13 of the ES. A 
brief summary is provided below. 
Baseline 
4.9.4 
The desk based assessment identified a total of 48 Heritage Assets 
(excluding Listed Buildings) within the Project Site and inner study 
area.  A total of 71 Listed Buildings were also recorded within the 
Project Site and inner study area (see Figure 13.2 (Document 
Reference No: 6.3).   
4.9.5 
Within the Power Generation Plant Site, only two Heritage Assets have 
been identified: Medieval field boundaries and the former Eye Airfield.  
A further Heritage Asset, a lane that follows the parish boundary 
between Eye and Yaxley, may continue across the Project Site. 
4.9.6 
Within the Electrical Connection Site are seven fields / field boundaries 
of potential Iron Age date.  A further Heritage Asset is a Roman Road, 
part of which runs through the Access Road, the A140 Junction and the 
Electrical Connection Route Corridor.  A collection of metalwork that is 
indicative of an Anglo-Saxon cemetery has been recovered from part of 
the Electrical Connection Route Corridor. 
4.9.7 
The results of the geophysical survey have indicated that there are 
three main areas (Plots A, B and C) of potential archaeological 
evidence within and around the Project Site:  
• Within Plot A located outside of the Project Site to the north of The 
Leys, is an eroded enclosure, which has been interpreted as a 
structure of possible Romano-British date. An east/west aligned 
ditch runs across the field, which may represent the remains of an 
ancient enclosure or field system or could be a more recent ditch or 
drain. Of interest, is a curvilinear ditch, which could be part of an

archaeological feature, such as an enclosure of Iron Age/Romano-
British date; 
• Plot B, located outside the Project Site, to the west of the A140 and 
south of the Access Road, shows anomalies that have been 
interpreted as an infilled pond, along with more recent drains and 
ditches; 
• Plot C, located to the south of the former Eye Airfield, within the 
Gas Connection Site, shows a weak curvilinear anomaly that may 
be archaeological in nature. 
4.9.8 
Assessment of Potential Impacts 
Power Generation Plant  
Construction 
4.9.9 
The excavation of foundations for the Power Generation Plant along 
with its ancillary structures, all have the potential to impact directly on 
buried archaeology, both known and unknown. 
4.9.10 
Two Heritage Assets are located within the Power Generation Plant 
Site and would be directly impacted by the construction of the Power 
Generation Plant.  A third Heritage Asset, a lane that may continue into 
the Power Generation Plant, could also be directly impacted.  In 
addition, there is high potential for buried archaeology within the Power 
Generation Plant Site due to the presence of known archaeology, such 
as findspots.  It is anticipated therefore that construction of the Power 
Generation Plant would result in substantial adverse effects on non-
designated Heritage Assets, which is significant.  The proposed 
mitigation in relation to known sites will be to preserve by record.  This 
will most likely take the form of targeted trial trenches within the Project 
Site.  A contingency for further excavation work has been presented in 
the Written Scheme of Investigation, which can be found in Appendix 
13.C of the ES. 
4.9.11 
The direct impact on the setting of the non-designated Heritage Assets 
within the Power Generation Plant Site during construction is 
considered to be of negligible magnitude and not significant.  In 
addition, some of the designated Heritage Assets within the outer study 
area will have a direct line of sight to the construction of the Power 
Generation Plant.  There would be a negligible or slight effect in the 
setting for these Heritage Assets, although this is not considered to be 
a significant impact.

Operation 
4.9.12 
Once the Power Generation Plant is operational, the main potential 
impacts are likely to be the disruption of the setting and appreciation of 
Heritage Assets, particularly Scheduled Monuments and tall Listed 
Buildings, such as churches.  None of these impacts are, however, 
considered likely to be significant.  It is envisaged that mitigation 
measures, such as hoardings or barriers are likely to cause more 
adverse visual impacts than if only the Power Generation Plant were 
present, therefore, no mitigation measures are proposed.  
Decommissioning 
4.9.13 
During the decommissioning of the Power Generation Plant, it is not 
anticipated that there will be any additional impacts other than those 
mentioned for construction. 
Gas Connection 
Construction 
4.9.14 
The excavation of the Gas Connection Route Corridor and the AGI has 
the potential to impact directly on buried archaeology, both known and 
unknown.  There are, however, no known Heritage Assets within the 
Gas Connection Site. 
4.9.15 
The direct impact on the setting of the non-designated Heritage Assets 
within the Gas Connection Site during construction is considered to be 
of negligible magnitude and not significant.  In addition, some of the 
designated Heritage Assets within the outer study area will have a 
direct line of sight to the construction of the Gas Connection.  There 
would be a negligible or slight effect in the setting for these Heritage 
Assets, although this is not considered to be a significant impact. 
Operation 
4.9.16 
During the operational phase, the main potential impacts are likely to 
be the disruption of the setting and appreciation of the Heritage Assets 
as a result of the AGI, however these impacts are not considered likely 
to be significant. 
Decommissioning  
4.9.17 
During the decommissioning phase, it is not anticipated that there will 
be any additional impacts other than those mentioned for construction.

Construction 
4.9.18 
The excavation of the Electrical Connection Route Corridor and the 
foundations for the Electrical Connection Compound, as well as the 
Access Road and A140 Junction, has the potential to impact directly on 
buried archaeology, both known and unknown.  Several findspots have 
been recovered from the vicinity of the Electrical Connection Route 
Corridor highlighting its high archaeological potential. 
4.9.19 
Within the Electrical Connection Compound lies an ancient field system 
comprising seven fields / field boundaries of potential Iron Age date.  In 
the event that the Electrical Connection Compound is comprised of an 
air insulated substation, all seven field boundaries will be impacted 
upon.  However, if a gas insulated substation is constructed, only one 
existing field boundary and one historic field boundary will be affected.  
In addition to this Heritage Asset, a collection of metalwork finds 
indicative of an Anglo-Saxon cemetery, would also be directly impacted 
upon by the construction of the Electrical Connection Compound.  The 
significance of both of these assets is uncertain at this stage in the 
Project as they have not been fully investigated.  As such, they are 
considered to have regional significance and it is preferred that these 
assets are retained in situ. However, if this is unavoidable, then a 
programme of mitigation is recommended comprising a topographic 
survey of any extant earthworks followed by trial trenching. 
4.9.20 
A Roman Road will also be directly impacted upon by the construction 
of the Electrical Connection Route Corridor resulting in substantial 
adverse effects on this non-designated Heritage Asset.  As with the 
Power Generation Plant Site, the proposed mitigation in relation to 
known sites will be to preserve by record.  This will most likely take the 
form of targeted trial trenches within the Project Site.  A contingency for 
further excavation work has been presented in the Written Scheme of 
Investigation (Appendix 14.C of the ES (Document Reference No: 6.2, 
Vol I). 
4.9.21 
The direct impact on the setting of the non-designated Heritage Assets 
within the Electrical Connection Site during construction is considered 
to be minor and not significant.  In addition, some of the designated 
Heritage Assets within the outer study area will have a direct line of 
sight to the construction of the Electrical Connection.  There would be a 
negligible or slight effect in the setting for these Heritage Assets, 
although this is not considered to be a significant impact.

4.9.22 
During the operational phase, the main potential impacts are likely to 
be the disruption of the setting and appreciation of the Heritage Assets 
as a result of the above ground elements of the Electrical Connection.  
None of these impacts are, however, considered likely to be significant. 
Decommissioning  
4.9.23 
During the decommissioning phase, it is not anticipated that there will 
be any additional impacts other than those mentioned for construction. 
Cumulative Impacts 
4.9.24 
Several developments in the vicinity of the Project Site have been 
assessed for cumulative impacts.  The existing wind turbines are visible 
across the landscape surrounding the Project Site, but are at a greater 
height than the Power Generation Plant would be.  The new overhead 
line diversion towers may cause a slight cumulative impact for the 
settings of some of the designated Heritage Assets, however this 
impact is not considered to be significant.  The ground disturbance 
during the construction of these towers will impact substantially on any 
below ground archaeological remains.  The existing Eye Power Station 
and National Grid Gas Compressor Station are not visible from the 
designated Heritage Assets and therefore do not add to the cumulative 
impacts. 
Residual Impacts 
4.9.25 
Based on the results of the environmental assessment, taking into 
account potential mitigation measures, construction, operation and 
decommissioning of the Project will not result in any significant effects 
on cultural heritage and archaeology.

Socio-economics 
Introduction 
4.10.2 
The construction, operation and decommissioning phases of the 
Project have the potential to impact on the labour market, community 
facilities and tourism sector in the area.  A limited amount of agricultural 
land will also be affected by the Project. 
4.10.3 
The socio-economic assessment is based on drive time catchment 
areas from the Project Site.  The ‘local area’ is defined within a 30 
minute drive time, ‘wider area’ within a 45 minute drive time, and ‘wider 
region’ within a 60 minute drive time. The tourism and agricultural 
assessments focus on a 15 km radius from the Project Site and the

community infrastructure assessment considers a 5km radius from the 
Project Site. 
4.10.4 
The full assessment for this topic is provided in Section 14 of the ES. A 
brief summary is provided below. 
Baseline 
4.10.5 
The baseline socio-economic status of the local area surrounding the 
Project is characterised by a pattern of population increase which is 
expected to continue until 2021.  The area has a declining work age 
population with over a quarter of the population expected to be at 
retirement age by 2021.  The local area’s level of economic activity is 
comparable to the national average and unemployment levels are 
relatively low. Retail and wholesaling activity is the single largest 
employment category in the local area.  Agriculture, manufacturing and 
construction employment in the local area is above the national 
average. 
4.10.6 
Visitor attractions within 15 km of the Project Site include Eye Castle, 
Banham Zoo, Mid Suffolk Light Railway Museum, Bressingham Steam 
and Gardens, Diss Museum, The 100th Bomb Group Memorial 
Museum, Burston Strike School and Mechanical Music Museum.  
Services within 5 km of the Project include but are not limited to: twenty 
five schools, one hospital, two doctors surgeries, five community 
centres/town halls, five parks/community spaces, one sports ground, 
two libraries, fourteen local bus routes and one train station. 
4.10.7 
Within the study area there is no excellent quality agricultural land and 
limited very good agricultural land.  Overall, the vast majority of 
agricultural land in the study area is classed as good or moderate 
(Grade 3) and, based on the available information, the area affected by 
the Project is uniformly Grade 3 (including good and moderate quality). 
Assessment of Potential Impacts 
Power Generation Plant 
Construction 
4.10.8 
The Project would have minor positive impacts on the socio-economic 
status of the area through both employment creation and capital 
expenditure and worker spending in the local economy. It is anticipated 
that up to 127 construction workers would be required at the Project 
Site during peak periods. These workers would not only benefit the

economy directly, but would also have knock on effects on other 
businesses (e.g. guest houses and bakeries).  
4.10.9 
Impacts on tourism and community infrastructure are predicted as a 
result of visual, noise, traffic and accessibility and air quality impacts.  
Visual impacts would likely decrease with distance from the Project Site 
and thus are predicted to be minor.  Noise / air quality impacts would 
be minor.  The effects of noise emissions from construction equipment 
and air emissions such as dust would be restricted to the immediate 
area.  There are no significant clusters of tourism attractions or 
community infrastructure in close proximity to the Power Generation 
Plant Site. 
4.10.10 
Traffic / accessibility impacts resulting from an increase in construction 
traffic would be temporary during the construction phase and would be 
effectively managed by a Traffic Management Plan thus impacts are 
predicted to be minor. 
4.10.11 
The amount of agricultural land lost as a result of the Power Generation 
Plant Site is minimal and therefore not significant. 
Operation 
4.10.12 
The Project would have minor positive impacts on the socio-economic 
status of the area during operation. The operational phase would 
provide an estimated 15 full time equivalent direct jobs. 
4.10.13 
Impacts on tourism and community infrastructure are predicted as a 
result of visual, noise, traffic and accessibility and air quality impacts.  
Visual impacts would likely decrease with distance from the Power 
Generation Plant Site and thus are predicted to be minor.  Noise / Air 
Quality impacts would be minor. Noise emissions and air emissions 
from operation would only impact the immediate area and there are no 
significant clusters of tourism attractions or community infrastructure in 
close proximity to the Power Generation Plant Site. 
4.10.14 
Traffic / accessibility impacts as a result of operational traffic are 
predicted to be minor as operational traffic would be lower than 
construction and it would be effectively managed by a Traffic 
Management Plan. 
Decommissioning 
4.10.15 
During decommissioning, similar impacts to those predicted during 
construction are likely to be experienced, with minor positive impacts 
on the socio-economic status of the area.

Gas Connection 
Construction 
4.10.16 
During construction there are likely to be minor positive socioeconomic 
impacts due to employment creation and capital expenditure and 
worker spending in the local economy. 
4.10.17 
Minor negative impacts would be felt on tourism and community 
infrastructure in the local area as a result of visual, noise, traffic and 
accessibility and air quality impacts. 
4.10.18 
The amount of agricultural land lost as a result of the Gas Connection 
is minimal and therefore not significant. 
Operation 
4.10.19 
The operation of the Gas Connection would not generate any 
noticeable noise or air emissions and would generate very infrequent 
vehicle trips.  Visual impacts would likely decrease with distance from 
the AGI and thus are predicted to be minor.  Therefore, operation of the 
Gas Connection would not have any significant impacts on the socio-
economics of the local area, tourism or community infrastructure.

Road to Norwich to the west of the Project Site.  As the main trunk road 
between Ipswich and Norwich, visitors may experience some delays 
during the construction period, although the implementation of an

Traffic Management Plan should ensure that no tourism or recreational 
related businesses / receptors are significantly impacted. 
4.10.24 
The amount of agricultural land lost as a result of the Electrical 
Connection is minimal and therefore not significant. 
Operation 
4.10.25 
The operation of the Electrical Connection would not generate any air 
emissions and vehicle trips would be very infrequent.  Visual impacts 
would likely decrease with distance from the Electrical Connection 
Compound and thus are predicted to be minor.  Any noise produced 
from the Electrical Connection Compound would be extremely 
localised.  Operation of the Electrical Connection would, therefore, not 
have any significant impacts on the socio-economics of the local area, 
tourism or community infrastructure.   
Decommissioning 
4.10.26 
During decommissioning, similar impacts to those predicted during 
construction are likely to be experienced, with minor positive impacts 
on the socio-economic status of the area. 
Cumulative Impacts  
4.10.27 
The construction job requirements associated with other projects in the 
area which are likely to be constructed at the same time as the Project 
have been assessed.  It has been concluded that there is sufficient 
labour within a 60 minute drive time of the Project to build each of the 
projects, excluding the East Anglia ONE offshore wind farm which will 
have a wider regional and possibly national catchment area.  However, 
the assessment shows there is sufficient capacity in the East of 
England region to accommodate the development of the cumulative 
projects including East Anglia. 
Residual Impacts 
4.10.28 
The Project’s construction and operational phases will provide an 
overall ‘slight’ significant positive employment impact.  It would also 
present an opportunity to reskill a small section of the currently 
available workforce, helping to lower the area’s unemployment rate and 
improve productivity and competitiveness.  No tourism or recreation 
receptors or community facilities would be significantly impacted during 
either the construction or operational phase.  The amount of agricultural 
land lost as a result of the Project is minimal and therefore not 
significant.

Waste Management and Health 
Introduction 
4.11.1 
The construction, operation and decommissioning of the Project have 
the potential to generate a variety of waste material that would need to 
be handled and disposed of correctly in order to avoid impacts on 
people or the environment.  The Project could also create impacts 
relating directly to human health (e.g. through changes to air quality or 
water quality).  
4.11.2 
The main potential impacts regarding waste management will be from 
site preparation during construction.  It is anticipated that the main 
potential impacts to human health arising from the Project will result 
from changes to local air quality, with potential impacts also arising 
from pollution incidents, site surface water run-off, electro-magnetic 
fields and noise. 
4.11.3 
A Conceptual Site Model approach has been used to assess the risks 
posed by contaminants to public health.  This examines the cause of 
the impact (e.g. stack emissions may result in a change in air quality), 
the potential human receptors that could be affected and the pathways 
to these receptors (e.g. exposure via dermal contact, oral contact or 
inhalation). 
4.11.4 
The full assessment for this topic is provided in Section 15 of the ES. 
An Electro-Magnetic Field (EMF) Study is included in Appendix 15.A of 
the ES (Document Reference No: 6.2).  A brief summary is provided 
below. 
Baseline (Receptors) 
4.11.5 
For this assessment potential receptor groups refer only to human 
receptors that could potentially come into contact with contaminants 
resulting from the Project.  These receptors include: 
• 
Residents of surrounding towns / villages; 
• 
Adjacent commercial users; 
• 
Recipients of agricultural produce; 
• 
Recreational users (e.g. users of public rights of way); and  
• 
Users of transport infrastructure.  
4.11.6 
Surrounding residential settlements to the Project Site include: 
• 
Eye (1.7 km south east of the Power Generation Plant);

Adjacent commercial users include other businesses within the former 
Eye Airfield. 
Potential Impacts  
Power Generation Plant  
Construction 
4.11.8 
During construction, the pathways for the Project to impact upon 
human receptors will potentially be through inhalation of emissions from 
waste and dermal contact / ingestion of leachate from waste that could 
contaminate soils. 
4.11.9 
In order to limit any impacts, an agreed Construction Environmental 
Management Plan will be implemented to ensure that all construction 
waste is dealt with in a manner that complies with relevant legislation.  
The Construction Environmental Management Plan provides for the 
submission of a Site Waste Management Plan for approval by the local 
authority prior to commencement of construction.  Mitigation measures 
will include, amongst others, the stockpiling of excavated spoil and 
testing for Waste Acceptance Criteria, to determine whether it can be 
re-used on- or off-site, and the testing and removal, as appropriate, of 
any water from de-watering activities which will be handled by a 
suitably licensed waste contractor. 
4.11.10 
The Construction Environmental Management Plan would also include 
measures to mitigate public health impacts including controlling dust 
and noise, preventing the escape of contaminants and a suggested 
protocol to follow in the event of construction workers discovering 
contaminated materials or unexploded ordinance. 
4.11.11 
Following the implementation of mitigation, no significant public health 
impacts are predicted with regards to air quality, noise, water quality or 
land contamination during construction of the Power Generation Plant. 
Operation 
4.11.12 
During operation of the Power Generation Plant, minimal quantities of 
waste would be generated, such as general office wastes, separated oil 
/ sludge from oil / waste separators and used oil, chemicals or chemical 
containers.

4.11.13 
During operation, only small quantities of potentially hazardous waste 
will be stored on the Power Generation Plant Site at any one time, and 
any such substances will be held in secured containers to prevent 
contaminant migration.  Closed storage facilities or suitable dampening 
techniques will be utilised within the Power Generation Plant where 
emissions of dust etc. from waste are possible.  All mitigation measures 
will be in full accordance with industry good practices.  All waste will be 
dealt with in a manner that complies with relevant legislation. 
4.11.14 
The main potential impact on human health during operation of the 
Power Generation Plant is from the generation of stack emissions 
which could affect air quality. As explained in the Air Quality Section of 
the ES, no significant adverse air quality impacts are predicted and it is 
extremely unlikely that the Power Generation Plant will have any 
adverse public health impacts with respect to air quality.   
Decommissioning 
4.11.15 
A full Environmental Departure Audit will be carried out prior to 
decommissioning.  This will examine, in detail, all potential 
environmental risks existing at the Power Generation Plant Site and 
make comprehensive recommendations for any remedial action 
required to remove such risks. 
4.11.16 
During decommissioning, impacts on public health will be similar to 
those for construction.  An agreed demolition and restoration plan 
would be implemented to mitigate any effects on public health from the 
decommissioning of the Power Generation Plant. 
4.11.17 
Following completion of the demolition, a Final Environmental 
Departure Audit will be carried out to ensure that all remedial work has 
been completed successfully. 
Gas Connection 
Construction 
4.11.18 
During construction of the Gas Connection, activities would involve 
excavation of a trench, temporary stockpiling of soils and subsoils and 
then subsequent backfilling. 
4.11.19 
As with the Power Generation Plant, an agreed Construction 
Environmental Management Plan will be implemented to ensure that all 
construction waste is dealt with in a manner that complies with relevant 
legislation.  Measures to mitigate public health impacts including 
controlling dust and noise, preventing the escape of contaminants and 
a suggested protocol to follow in the event of construction workers

discovering contaminated materials or unexploded ordinance will also 
be included within the Construction Environmental Management Plan. 
4.11.20 
Following the implementation of mitigation, no significant public health 
impacts are predicted with regards to air quality, noise, water quality or 
land contamination during construction of the Gas Connection. 
Operation 
4.11.21 
No waste will be generated through the operation of the Gas 
Connection and no pollutants will be emitted.  Small amounts of noise 
would be generated by the AGI, although this will rarely be perceptible 
except when in very close proximity to the AGI.  As such, operation of 
the Gas Connection will result in no adverse public health impacts. 
Decommissioning 
4.11.22 
During decommissioning, impacts on public health will be similar to 
those for construction.  An agreed demolition and restoration plan 
would be implemented to mitigate any effects on public health. 
Electrical Connection  
Construction  
4.11.23 
During construction of the Electrical Connection, activities would 
involve excavation of a trench, temporary stockpiling of soils and 
subsoils and then subsequent backfilling. 
4.11.24 
As with the Power Generation Plant, an agreed Construction 
Environmental Management Plan will be implemented to ensure that all 
construction waste is dealt with in a manner that complies with relevant 
legislation.  Measures to mitigate public health impacts including 
controlling dust and noise, preventing the escape of contaminants and 
a suggested protocol to follow in the event of construction workers 
discovering contaminated materials or unexploded ordinance will also 
be included within the Construction Environmental Management Plan. 
4.11.25 
Following the implementation of mitigation, no significant public health 
impacts are predicted with regards to air quality, noise, water quality or 
land contamination during construction of the Electrical Connection. 
Operation 
4.11.26 
No waste will be generated through the operation of the Electrical 
Connection and no pollutants will be emitted.  It is possible that a low 
‘hum’ may be audible during operation of the Electrical Connection

Compound, however, this noise is usually imperceptible except when 
within close proximity or during specific meteorological conditions.  The 
EMF study for the Project has also concluded that the EMF strength for 
the Project would be the same as that which is already present 
associated with the existing 400 kilovolts Norwich Main to Bramford 
overhead line and remains within occupational exposure guideline 
levels.  As such, operation of the Electrical Connection will result in no 
adverse public health impacts. 
Decommissioning 
During decommissioning, impacts on public health will be similar to 
those for construction.  An agreed demolition and restoration plan 
would be implemented to mitigate any effects on public health. 
Residual Impacts 
4.11.27 
Based on the results of the environmental assessment, taking into 
account potential mitigation measures, construction, operation and 
decommissioning Project will not result in adverse public health 
impacts.  In addition, the Project is not predicted to have any likely 
significant adverse effects arising from waste management. 
4.12 
Conclusion 
4.12.1 
Table 2 overleaf provides a summary of the mitigation measures and 
residual impacts of the Project for each environmental assessment 
topic.  Further detail is provided in the ES (Document Reference 6.1) 
under the mitigation section for each topic (Sections 6-15).
