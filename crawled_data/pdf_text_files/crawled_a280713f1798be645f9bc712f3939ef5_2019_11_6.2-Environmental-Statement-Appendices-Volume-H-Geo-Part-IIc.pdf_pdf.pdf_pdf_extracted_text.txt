Introduction

Radon Potential dataset Copyright Notice
The Environment Act 1995 has made site sensitivity a key issue, as the legislation pays as much attention to the pathways by which 
contamination could spread, and to the vulnerable targets of contamination, as it does the potential sources of contamination. 
For this reason, Landmark's Site Sensitivity maps and Datasheet(s) place great emphasis on statutory data provided by the Environment 
Agency/Natural Resources Wales and the Scottish Environment Protection Agency; it also incorporates data from Natural England (and the 
Scottish and Welsh equivalents) and Local Authorities; and highlights hydrogeological features required by environmental and geotechnical 
consultants. It does not include any information concerning past uses of land. The datasheet is produced by querying the Landmark database 
to a distance defined by the client from a site boundary provided by the client. 
In the attached datasheet the National Grid References (NGRs) are rounded to the nearest 10m in accordance with Landmark's agreements 
with a number of Data Suppliers.

Soils of Low Leaching Potential - Soils in which pollutants are unlikely to 
penetrate the soil layer because water movement is largely horizontal or they 
have large ability to attenuate diffuse pollutants. Lateral flow from these soils 
contribute to groundwater recharge elsewhere in the catchment
Sheet 35 West Glamorgan
1:100,000
Soils of High Leaching Potential (H2) - Deep, permeable, coarse textured soils
which readily transmit a wide range of pollutants because of their rapid 
drainage and low attenuation potential
Sheet 35 West Glamorgan
1:100,000
Soils of High Leaching Potential (H1) - Soils which readily transmit liquid 
discharges because they are either shallow, or susceptible to rapid by-pass 
flow directly to rock, gravel or groundwater
Sheet 35 West Glamorgan
1:100,000
Soils of Intermediate Leaching Potential (I1) - Soils which can possibly 
transmit a wide range of pollutants

Geology 1:50,000 Maps
This report contains geological map extracts taken from the BGS Digital 
Geological map of Great Britain at 1:50,000 scale and is designed for users
carrying out preliminary site assessments who require geological maps for 
the area around the site. This mapping may be more up to date than 
previously published paper maps.
The various geological layers - artificial and landslip deposits, superficial 
geology and solid (bedrock) geology are displayed in separate maps, but 
superimposed on the final 'Combined Surface Geology' map. All map 
legends feature on this page. Not all layers have complete nationwide 
coverage, so availability of data for relevant map sheets is indicated below.

Artificial Ground and Landslip
Artificial ground is a term used by BGS for those areas where the ground 
surface has been significantly modified by human activity. Information about
previously developed ground is especially important, as it is often 
associated with potentially contaminated material, unpredictable 
engineering conditions and unstable ground.
Artificial ground includes: 
- Made ground - man-made deposits such as embankments and spoil 
heaps on the natural ground surface.
- Worked ground - areas where the ground has been cut away such as 
quarries and road cuttings.
- Infilled ground - areas where the ground has been cut away then wholly or
partially backfilled.
- Landscaped ground - areas where the surface has been reshaped.
- Disturbed ground - areas of ill-defined shallow or near surface mineral 
workings where it is impracticable to map made and worked ground 
separately.
Mass movement (landslip) deposits on BGS geological maps are primarily 
superficial deposits that have moved down slope under gravity to form 
landslips. These affect bedrock, other superficial deposits and artificial 
ground. The dataset also includes foundered strata, where the ground has 
collapsed due to subsidence.

Superficial Geology
Superficial Deposits are the youngest geological deposits formed during the
most recent period of geological time, the Quaternary, which extends back 
about 1.8 million years from the present. 
They rest on older deposits or rocks referred to as Bedrock. This dataset 
contains Superficial deposits that are of natural origin and 'in place'. Other 
superficial strata may be held in the Mass Movement dataset where they 
have been moved, or in the Artificial Ground dataset where they are of 
man-made origin.
Most of these Superficial deposits are unconsolidated sediments such as 
gravel, sand, silt and clay, and onshore they form relatively thin, often 
discontinuous patches or larger spreads.

Bedrock and Faults
Bedrock geology is a term used for the main mass of rocks forming the 
Earth and are present everywhere, whether exposed at the surface in 
outcrops or concealed beneath superficial deposits or water. 
The bedrock has formed over vast lengths of geological time ranging from 
ancient and highly altered rocks of the Proterozoic, some 2500 million years
ago, or older, up to the relatively young Pliocene, 1.8 million years ago.
The bedrock geology includes many lithologies, often classified into three 
types based on origin: igneous, metamorphic and sedimentary.
The BGS Faults and Rock Segments dataset includes geological faults 
(e.g. normal, thrust), and thin beds mapped as lines (e.g. coal seam, 
gypsum bed). Some of these are linked to other particular 1:50,000 
Geology datasets, for example, coal seams are part of the bedrock 
sequence, most faults and mineral veins primarily affect the bedrock but cut
across the strata and post date its deposition.

Published 1884
Source map scale - 1:10,560
The historical maps shown were reproduced from maps predominantly held 
at the scale adopted for England, Wales and Scotland in the 1840`s. In 1854 
the 1:2,500 scale was adopted for mapping urban areas; these maps were 
used to update the 1:10,560 maps. The published date given therefore is 
often some years later than the surveyed date. Before 1938, all OS maps 
were based on the Cassini Projection, with independent surveys of a single 
county or group of counties, giving rise to significant inaccuracies in outlying 
areas. In the late 1940`s, a Provisional Edition was produced, which updated 
the 1:10,560 mapping from a number of sources. The maps appear 
unfinished - with all military camps and other strategic sites removed. These 
maps were initially overprinted with the National Grid. In 1970, the first 
1:10,000 maps were produced using the Transverse Mercator Projection. The
revision process continued until recently, with new editions appearing every 
10 years or so for urban areas.

Source map scale - 1:10,000
These maps were produced by the Russian military during the Cold War 
between 1950 and 1997, and cover 103 towns and cities throughout the U.K. 
The maps are produced at 1:25,000, 1:10,000 and 1:5,000 scale, and show 
detailed land use, with colour-coded areas for development, green areas, and
non-developed areas. Buildings are coloured black and important building 
uses (such as hospitals, post offices, factories etc.) are numbered, with a 
numbered key describing their use. 
They were produced by the Russians for the benefit of navigation, as well as 
strategic military sites and transport hubs, for use if they were to have 
invaded the U.K. The detailed information provided indicates that the areas 
were surveyed using land-based personnel, on the ground, in the cities that 
are mapped.

areas. In the late 1940`s, a Provisional Edition was produced, which updated 
the 1:10,560 mapping from a number of sources. The maps appear 
unfinished - with all military camps and other strategic sites removed. These 
maps were initially overprinted with the National Grid. In 1970, the first 
1:10,000 maps were produced using the Transverse Mercator Projection. The
revision process continued until recently, with new editions appearing every 
10 years or so for urban areas.

Ordnance Survey Plan
Published 1993
Source map scale - 1:10,000
The historical maps shown were reproduced from maps predominantly held 
at the scale adopted for England, Wales and Scotland in the 1840`s. In 1854 
the 1:2,500 scale was adopted for mapping urban areas; these maps were 
used to update the 1:10,560 maps. The published date given therefore is 
often some years later than the surveyed date. Before 1938, all OS maps 
were based on the Cassini Projection, with independent surveys of a single 
county or group of counties, giving rise to significant inaccuracies in outlying 
areas. In the late 1940`s, a Provisional Edition was produced, which updated 
the 1:10,560 mapping from a number of sources. The maps appear 
unfinished - with all military camps and other strategic sites removed. These 
maps were initially overprinted with the National Grid. In 1970, the first 
1:10,000 maps were produced using the Transverse Mercator Projection. The
revision process continued until recently, with new editions appearing every 
10 years or so for urban areas.

Source map scale - 1:10,000
VectorMap Local (Raster) is Ordnance Survey's highest detailed 'backdrop' 
mapping product. These maps are produced from OS's VectorMap Local, a 
simple vector dataset at a nominal scale of 1:10,000, covering the whole of 
Great Britain, that has been designed for creating graphical mapping. OS 
VectorMap Local is derived from large-scale information surveyed at 1:1250 
scale (covering major towns and cities),1:2500 scale (smaller towns, villages 
and developed rural areas), and 1:10 000 scale (mountain, moorland and 
river estuary areas).

Glamorganshire
Published 1877
Source map scale - 1:2,500
The historical maps shown were reproduced from maps predominantly held 
at the scale adopted for England, Wales and Scotland in the 1840`s. In 1854 
the 1:2,500 scale was adopted for mapping urban areas and by 1896 it 
covered the whole of what were considered to be the cultivated parts of Great
Britain. The published date given below is often some years later than the 
surveyed date. Before 1938, all OS maps were based on the Cassini 
Projection, with independent surveys of a single county or group of counties, 
giving rise to significant inaccuracies in outlying areas.

Source map scale - 1:2,500
The historical maps shown were reproduced from maps predominantly held 
at the scale adopted for England, Wales and Scotland in the 1840`s. In 1854 
the 1:2,500 scale was adopted for mapping urban areas and by 1896 it 
covered the whole of what were considered to be the cultivated parts of Great
Britain. The published date given below is often some years later than the 
surveyed date. Before 1938, all OS maps were based on the Cassini 
Projection, with independent surveys of a single county or group of counties, 
giving rise to significant inaccuracies in outlying areas.

Supply of Unpublished Survey 
Information
Published 1975
Source map scale - 1:2,500
SUSI maps (Supply of Unpublished Survey Information) were produced 
between 1972 and 1977, mainly for internal use at Ordnance Survey. These 
were more of a `work-in-progress' plan as they showed updates of individual 
areas on a map. These maps were unpublished, and they do not represent a 
single moment in time. They were produced at both 1:2,500 and 1:1,250 
scales.

Large-Scale National Grid Data
Published 1993
Source map scale - 1:2,500
'Large Scale National Grid Data' superseded SIM cards (Ordnance Survey's 
'Survey of Information on Microfilm') in 1992, and continued to be produced 
until 1999. These maps were the fore-runners of digital mapping and so 
provide detailed information on houses and roads, but tend to show less 
topographic features such as vegetation. These maps were produced at both 
1:2,500 and 1:1,250 scales.

Supply of Unpublished Survey 
Information
Published 1975
Source map scale - 1:2,500
SUSI maps (Supply of Unpublished Survey Information) were produced 
between 1972 and 1977, mainly for internal use at Ordnance Survey. These 
were more of a `work-in-progress' plan as they showed updates of individual 
areas on a map. These maps were unpublished, and they do not represent a 
single moment in time. They were produced at both 1:2,500 and 1:1,250 
scales.

Published 1877
Source map scale - 1:2,500
The historical maps shown were reproduced from maps predominantly held 
at the scale adopted for England, Wales and Scotland in the 1840`s. In 1854 
the 1:2,500 scale was adopted for mapping urban areas and by 1896 it 
covered the whole of what were considered to be the cultivated parts of Great
Britain. The published date given below is often some years later than the 
surveyed date. Before 1938, all OS maps were based on the Cassini 
Projection, with independent surveys of a single county or group of counties, 
giving rise to significant inaccuracies in outlying areas.

Geology 1:10,000 Maps
This report contains geological map extracts taken from the BGS 
Digital Geological map of Great Britain at 1:10,000 scale and is 
designed for users carrying out preliminary site assessments who 
require geological maps for the area around a site. This mapping 
may be more up to date than previously published paper maps.
The various geological layers - artificial and landslip deposits, 
superficial geology and solid (bedrock) geology are displayed in 
separate maps, but superimposed on the final 'Combined Surface 
Geology' map. All map legends feature on this page.
Please Note: Not all of the layers have complete nationwide 
coverage, so availability of data for relevant map sheets is 
indicated below.

Artificial Ground and Landslip
Artificial ground is a term used by BGS for those areas where the 
ground surface has been significantly modified by human activity. 
Information about previously developed ground is especially 
important, as it is often associated with potentially contaminated 
material, unpredictable engineering conditions and unstable 
ground.
Artificial ground includes: 
- Made ground - man-made deposits such as embankments and 
spoil heaps on the natural ground surface.
- Worked ground - areas where the ground has been cut away 
such as quarries and road cuttings.
- Infilled ground - areas where the ground has been cut away then 
wholly or partially backfilled.
- Landscaped ground - areas where the surface has been 
reshaped.
- Disturbed ground - areas of ill-defined shallow or near surface 
mineral workings where it is impracticable to map made and 
worked ground separately.
Mass movement (landslip) deposits on BGS geological maps are 
primarily superficial deposits that have moved down slope under 
gravity to form landslips. These affect bedrock, other superficial 
deposits and artificial ground. The dataset also includes foundered
strata, where the ground has collapsed due to subsidence.

Superficial Geology
BGS 1:10,000 Superficial Deposits are the youngest geological 
deposits formed during the most recent period of geological time, 
which extends back about 1.8 million years from the present. 
They rest on older deposits or rocks referred to as Bedrock. This 
dataset contains Superficial deposits that are of natural origin and 
'in place'. Other superficial strata may be held in the Mass 
Movement dataset where they have been moved, or in the Artificial
Ground dataset where they are of man-made origin.
Most of these Superficial deposits are unconsolidated sediments 
such as gravel, sand, silt and clay, and onshore they form 
relatively thin, often discontinuous patches or larger spreads.

Bedrock and Faults
Bedrock geology is a term used for the main mass of rocks 
forming the Earth and are present everywhere, whether exposed at
the surface in outcrops or concealed beneath superficial deposits 
or water. 
The bedrock has formed over vast lengths of geological time 
ranging from ancient and highly altered rocks of the Proterozoic, 
some 2500 million years ago, or older, up to the relatively young 
Pliocene, 1.8 million years ago.
The bedrock geology includes many lithologies, often classified 
into three types based on origin: igneous, metamorphic and 
sedimentary.
The BGS Faults and Rock Segments dataset includes 
geological faults and thin beds mapped as lines such as coal 
seams and mineral veins. These are not restricted by age and 
could relate to features of any of the 1:10,000 geology datasets.
