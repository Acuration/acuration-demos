 Overview 
1.1
1.1.1 
Progress Power Limited (PPL) is making an application for a 
Development Consent Order (DCO) to the Secretary of State for Energy 
and Climate Change (SoS). The DCO will authorise PPL to construct 
and operate a new 299 megawatt electrical (MWe) simple cycle gas 
turbine (SCGT) Power Generation Plant together with integral Gas and 
Electrical Connections (hereafter referred to as ‘the Project’). The Power 
Generation Plant will be located at the former Eye Airfield, Suffolk. 
 
Purpose of this document 
1.2
1.2.1 
This document provides an outline from which a final Construction 
Environmental Management Plan (CEMP) will be produced which will 
govern the construction works (including site preparation/demolition) 
associated with the Project for all contractors. This document will be 
hereafter referred to as the ‘outline CEMP’. This outline CEMP is 
informed by the Environmental Statement (ES) and associated DCO 
documents. 
1.2.2 
Schedule 2 of the DCO includes a requirement to approve CEMP(s) in 
a staged manner by the local planning authority, namely Mid Suffolk 
District Council (MSDC), prior to the commencement of any works. 
Such CEMP(s)) will be developed after any grant of a DCO, in 
conjunction with, or by, the main contractor/s appointed for such works 
once the timescales for the detailed implementation are defined. 
1.2.3 
The final CEMP should consider the following: 
 
Complaints procedures; 
 
Nuisance management including measures to avoid or minimise the 
impacts of construction works (covering dust, noise, vibration and 
lighting); 
 
Lighting; 
 
Waste management; 
 
Surface and ground water mitigation measures; 
 
Procedure in the event significant archaeological remains are 
encountered; 
 
Landscape and visual impact mitigation (such as retention of 
existing trees and minimising visual intrusion of construction works 
 
Security measures;

 
Traffic and Transport mitigation measures (such as a Construction 
Traffic Management Plan (CTMP)) prepared by the main 
contractors); and 
 
Ecological mitigation measures (such as an EcMP) 
1.2.4 
In considering these environmental matters the final CEMP will provide 
information on: 
 
A register of environmental aspects [the effects of the Scheme]; 
 
Roles and responsibilities; 
 
Communication and co-ordination; 
 
Training and awareness; 
 
Operational control; 
 
Checking and corrective action; and 
 
Environmental control measures. 
1.2.5 
The final CEMP will fall within the scope of the main contractor’s 
externally certified international environmental management systems, 
and as such will be subject to independent audits by the relevant 
certification bodies. 
1.2.6 
This outline CEMP provides sufficient information, based on best 
practice guidance and mitigation measures in the ES to act as a 
framework for the final CEMP and to provide assurance to the decision 
maker and stakeholders that all appropriate measures will be taken 
forward to the construction phase. 
 
Project Description 
1.3
1.3.1 
The Power Generation Plant will operate as a Simple Cycle Gas Turbine 
(SCGT) peaking plant and has been designed to provide an electrical 
output of up to 299 Megawatts electrical (MWe). The plant will be fuelled 
by natural gas. 
1.3.2 
The three main elements of the Project comprise: 
 
A new Power Generation Plant, a SCGT gas fired power 
generating station capable of providing up to 299 MW, incorporating 
up to five gas turbine generators (GTG) with up to five exhaust gas 
flue stacks. 
 
A new electrical connection, (referred to as the Electrical 
Connection) to export electricity from the Power Generation 
Plantto the National Grid Transmission System. This element 
incorporates a new underground cable circuit connection (the 
Cable), and a new access road (the Access Road), with a new 
road junction off the A140 (the A140 Junction), and a new Electrical

Connection 
Compound 
comprising 
a 
new 
substation 
(the 
Substation) and sealing end compound (the Sealing End 
Compound); and 
 
A new gas pipeline connection (referred to as the Gas Connection) 
to bring natural gas to the Power Generation Plant from the NTS in 
the vicinity of the Project Site. This element incorporates an above 
ground installation (AGI) at its southern end and a new access road 
off Potash Lane. 
1.3.3 
The Power Generation Plant, Gas Connection and Electrical Connection 
together are referred to as the Project. 
1.3.4 
The Project constitutes a Nationally Significant Infrastructure Project 
(NSIP) by virtue of section 14 (1)(a) and section 15 of the Planning Act 
2008 (PA 2008) which includes within the definition of an NSIP any 
onshore generating station in England or Wales of 50 MWe capacity or 
more. Under section 31 PA 2008 a development consent order (DCO) is 
required to develop a NSIP. Under section 37 PA 2008 this can only be 
granted if an application is made for it to the Secretary of State (SoS) 
(the DCO Application). 
1.3.5 
This outline CEMP is part of a suite of documents which accompany 
the DCO Application and should be read in conjunction to gain a fuller 
understanding of the Project.

OUTLINE CEMP – GENERAL INFORMATION 
2
 
Register of Environmental Impacts 
2.1
2.1.1 
A register of Environmental Impacts is required to be produced as part 
of the CEMP. This Register would be used to inform the environmental 
procedures and provide a tool for construction teams when preparing 
construction method statements or field briefings. This register would 
also comprise the various risks identified in the Environmental 
Statement (ES) and would be regularly updated to reflect any additional 
risks resulting from the main contractor/s selected methods of working, 
changing site conditions etc. Risks would be identified under the 
following general headings: 
 
Noise & Vibration; 
 
Air Quality & Emissions; 
 
Geology & Soils; 
 
Water Quality, Drainage & Hydrology; 
 
Landscape and Visual Impacts; 
 
Ecology; 
 
Traffic and Transport; 
 
Health and Waste; 
 
Archaeology and Cultural Heritage; and 
 
Combined Impacts. 
 
Risk Assessments 
2.2
2.2.1 
All activities undertaken on-site would be subject to an environmental 
risk assessment. Environmental risk assessments would be undertaken 
by trained staff following an approved procedure which will: 
 
Identify potential environmental impacts that can be anticipated; 
 
Assess the risks from these impacts; 
 
Identify the control measures to be taken and re-calculate the risk; 
and 
 
Report where an unacceptable level of residual risk is identified so 
that action can be taken through design changes, re-scheduling of 
work or alternative methods of working in order to reduce the risk to 
an acceptable level. 
2.2.2 
The results of risk assessments, and their residual risks are only 
considered acceptable if: 
 
 
Progress Power Project Outline Construction 
Environmental Management Plan  
 
PPL CEMP GIS.docx 
Prepared by Parsons Brinckerhoff 
December 2014 
for Progress Power Limited 
 
- 15 - 
 
The severity of outcome is reduced to the lowest practical level; 
 
The number of risk exposures are minimised; and 
 
All reasonably practical mitigating measures have been taken and 
the residual risk rating is reduced to a minimum. 
2.2.3 
The findings of the risk assessment and in particular the necessary 
controls would be explained to all contractors before the commencement 
of the relevant works using an agreed instruction format (e.g. Toolbox 
Talks). 
 
Method Statements 
2.3
2.3.1 
Method statements would be completed by the main contractor or sub- 
contractor by trained engineers or other appropriately experienced 
personnel, in consultation with on-site staff and, where necessary, 
environmental specialists. Their production would include a review of 
the environmental risks and commitments, so that appropriate control 
measures are developed and included within the construction process. 
2.3.2 
Method statements would be reviewed by the main contractor or sub 
contractor’s appointed environmental manager and, where necessary, 
by an appropriate environmental specialist. Where required, method 
statements would also be submitted to the enforcement agencies 
(Environment Agency, Environmental Health Officer etc.). Method 
statements would most likely contain the following: 
 
Location of the activity and access/egress arrangements; 
 
Work to be undertaken and methods of construction; 
 
Plant and materials to be used; 
 
Labour and supervision requirements; 
 
Health, safety and environmental considerations; and 
 
Any permit or consent requirements beyond those already obtained 
(including the DCO). 
 
Site Environmental Standards 
2.4
2.4.1 
Site Environmental Standards would be agreed with the main contractor 
and would detail the minimum measures that should be achieved for 
general operations falling outside the risk assessment/method statement 
procedure. The site environmental standards would be designed to 
cover the majority of construction activities in accordance with the ES 
submitted with the application and requirements associated with the 
DCO. 
2.4.2 
These will cover issues such as storage of materials, management of 
waste, noise and vibration, and water pollution control. The standards

- 16 - 
will be printed on A3 posters, placed on site notice boards and used as 
a briefing tool on site. These standards will also form the basis of 
Toolbox talks which will inform all contractors working on site of the 
potential environmental risks arising from construction activities. 
2.4.3 
Best practice construction site management techniques will be 
implemented to avoid/minimise the generation of excessive waste, dust, 
noise, lighting, noise and vibration, in accordance with the ES and 
relevant requirements associated with the DCO. These are discussed 
in more detail in Section 3 of this document. 
 
Environmental Management System 
2.5
2.5.1 
Following construction, an Environmental Management System for 
commercial operation will be developed and contained within the overall 
Business Management System prepared by the operator and designed 
to comply with ISO 14001 or an equivalent recognised standard. 
2.5.2 
Implementation of ISO 14001 is a Key Strategy for PPL and the use of 
an Environmental Management Plan for commissioning based on 
ISO14001 (or similar) will be used to support implementation and 
compliance with the DCO and the Environmental Permit that will be 
required for operation of the Project under the Environmental Permitting 
(England and Wales) Regulations 2011. All operational staff for the 
Project will be given comprehensive environmental awareness training 
as part of this process. 
2.5.3 
During the commissioning phase of the Project, PPL will require its 
environmental and compliance procedures to be implemented and used 
by the main contractor and the operator. 
 
Public Relations 
2.6
2.6.1 
The following steps will be taken to make the public aware of the 
activities on site and the available lines of communication with PPL: 
 
A Community Liaison Group will be set up to include members of 
the Local Community and Councils. PPL suggest that the 
Community Liaison Group invite a member of the British Horse 
Society to be one of their number; 
 
Neighbouring occupiers will be notified of the start of site works and 
the likely duration of the overall demolition and construction phases; 
 
A telephone number for environmental complaints will be published 
local to the site. The site safety, health and environment (SHE) 
officer will be responsible for dealing with any complaints and will 
have the appropriate authority to resolve any issues that may occur. 
The SHE and Site Managers out of office contact details will be 
available at all times;

for Progress Power Limited 
 
- 17 - 
 
The SHE officer will maintain a close liaison with the council’s 
Environmental Health Officer (EHO) at all times; 
 
Should any complaints regarding dust, noise or light be received 
by the SHE officer the details will be passed to the EHO for 
verification purposes; and 
 
Should any unforeseen event occur within the construction site that 
has the potential to cause off-site pollution then the SHE officer will 
immediately notify the EHO by phone and e-mail. As far as possible 
notice will be issued to the EHO for dealing with an unforeseen 
activity which may give rise to a particular dust problem. 
 
Monitoring and Measurement 
2.7
2.7.1 
Weekly site inspections will be carried out which will assess the potential 
for environmental emergency situations to arise on the site. Additionally 
the main contractor will assess the potential for environmental incidents 
on a daily basis across the site. Particular notice will be taken during 
and following extreme weather events, when working in areas of known 
contamination, and when particularly hazardous activities are being 
carried out. Method Statements will be required where the risk 
assessment has identified a significant risk to the environment. 
2.7.2 
In the event of any environmental incident the most senior 
representative of the main contractor will take the role of the responsible 
person and will take charge of the situation. Where possible, the 
responsible person will take immediate steps to eliminate the impact on 
the environment and mitigate/minimise any environmental damage. 
 
Roles and Responsibilities 
2.8
2.8.1 
Suggested specific roles and responsibilities for the implementation of 
the final CEMP are described below: 
PPL Project Director 
2.8.2 
The PPL Project Director would have overall responsibility for 
environmental performance throughout the construction period and will 
ensure

OUTLINE CEMP – SPECIFIC MEASURES 
3
 
Introduction 
3.1
3.1.1 
This section outlines some of the specific design and mitigation 
measures which will be used in the CEMP for the Project in order 
to limit impacts on noise and vibration, air quality, contaminated land 
and groundwater, ecology, archaeology and cultural heritage and 
landscape and visual amenity. It will additionally outline the measures 
to prevent impacts arising from artificial lighting. 
 
Noise and Vibration 
3.2
3.2.1 
This section outlines the potential sources of nuisance noise created by 
construction works and the methods of mitigation proposed to 
limit these impacts which should be adopted in a CEMP. 
3.2.2 
All construction activities will be undertaken in accordance with 
requirements attached to the DCO and the recommendations of 
BS5228 ‘Noise and Vibration Control on Construction and Open Sites’. 
It details the legislative background to noise control, along with the 
recommended procedures for effective liaison between developers, site 
operators and local authorities. Methods of how to minimise the impact 
of site noise on workers and local residents are also provided. 
3.2.3 
The main mitigation measure to limit impacts of nuisance noise on 
human receptors is to ensure noise levels do not exceed the noise 
thresholds set out in the ES (65 dBA daytime) and to undertake noise 
monitoring during construction to make sure these agreed thresholds 
are not breached. 
3.2.4 
In addition, construction works shall not take place outside the hours 
of 07:00-19:00 Monday to Saturday, unless otherwise agreed with 
MSDC/ SCC. 
3.2.5 
If works are required outside of these core construction hours 
then method statements and risk assessments will be required to be 
submitted to the local planning authority for approval. 
3.2.6 
To minimise the risk of noise complaints, the main contractor will 
advise potentially affected residents of the works to be undertaken 
outside of working hours. The residents will also be provided with a 
point of contact for any queries or complaints. 
3.2.7 
The main contractor and all sub-contractors working on-site have 
a general duty to take all reasonably practicable measures to minimise 
nuisance from noise and vibration that has the potential to impact

on the local community or environment. To achieve this and avoid the 
potential for construction works to give rise to consequences that 
would otherwise be statutory nuisances (but for the provision of the

Buildings). 
 
Air Quality 
3.3
3.3.1 
Relevant air quality mitigation measures are outlined in Chapter 6 
of the ES and in the Statement of Engagement of Section 79(1) of the 
Environmental Protection Act 1990 (Document number: 5.5). However, 
the following provides an outline of the processes which could be 
employed in the final CEMP in order to reduce dust and exhaust 
emissions during construction. 
3.3.2 
This section outlines the potential sources of air pollution created by 
construction works and the methods of mitigation proposed to 
limit these impacts which should be adopted in the final CEMP. The 
following provides an outline of the processes which should be 
employed in the final CEMP in order to reduce dust and exhaust 
emissions during construction. 
3.3.3 
Construction/demolition activities associated with the greatest potential 
for dust generation are: 
 
Earthworks including excavation of topsoil, handling on site and 
deposition; 
 
Handling and storage of materials (including loading and 
unloading); 
 
Wind blow across disturbed/exposed site surfaces and materials; 
and 
 
Mechanical operations such as crushing, drilling, concrete mixing 
and cutting. 
3.3.4 
In order to ensure the employment of BPM to minimise the risk 
of adverse effects from construction dust and causing nuisance or 
damage to flora and fauna specific control measures for limiting 
nuisance dust and exhaust emissions during construction are as 
follows:

Site Management 
 
Records of dust and air quality complaints to be kept, including 
likely causes and mitigation measures to reduce impacts if 
appropriate; 
 
Keep site perimeter, fences etc. clean.  
Site Planning 
 
Consideration of weather conditions, dust generating potential of 
material to be excavated prior to commencement of works; 
 
Plan site layout to maximise distance from plant/stockpiles etc. to 
sensitive receptors; 
 
Dusty materials should be removed from site as soon as possible. 
Construction Traffic 
 
Loads entering and leaving the site with dust generating potential 
should be covered and wheel washing facilities made available; 
 
No idling of vehicles; 
 
Vehicles to comply with site speed limits (15mph on hard surfaces, 
10mph on unconsolidated surfaces); 
 
Water assisted sweeping of local roads to be undertaken if material 
tracked out of site; and 
 
Install hard surfacing as soon as practicable on site and ensure that 
they are maintained in good condition. 
Site Activities 
 
Exposed soils should be revegetated as soon as practicable. Near 
residential properties or sensitive ecosystems (<50m), use 
hessian/mulches etc. where not possible to revegetate or cover 
with topsoil; 
 
Minimise dust generating activities, particularly near residential 
receptors/sensitive ecosystems during prolonged dry, dusty 
weather unless damping / other suppressants are used; 
 
Ensure an adequate water supply to site and use water as dust 
suppressant where applicable; 
 
Ensure any site machinery is well maintained and in full working 
order;

 
Ensure equipment available for cleaning spills etc available at all 
times; and 
 
Sand and aggregates should be stored away from sensitive 
receptors and screened/shielded. 
Similarly concrete batching 
should take place away from receptors. 
 
To ensure that dust generated by construction works does not 
exceed levels which could constitute a nuisance; 
 
The prolonged storage of debris on-site, in temporary stockpiles will 
be avoided. 
 
Vehicles removing demolition or site clearance materials must have 
their loads effectively sheeted on all sides. 
 
Crushing of material for reuse, transportation or disposal should be 
undertaken as far away as possible from sensitive receptors. 
3.3.5 
On-site burning of waste material will be forbidden. 
3.3.6 
The number of handling operations should be minimised, ensuring that 
dusty material is not moved or handled unnecessarily. Fine material 
should be delivered to site in bags. Drop heights must be kept to a 
minimum. 
3.3.7 
Hard-standing areas for vehicles entering, parking and leaving the 
Project Site should be provided, with wheel washing facilities at access 
points where there is a risk of tracking mud onto local roads. Plant and 
wheel washing will be carried out in a designated area of hardstanding 
at least 10 m from a watercourse or surface water drain. Where this is 
not possible alternative mitigation will be implemented. 
3.3.8 
The performance of the wheel washing system will be maintained 
by the regular removal of settled sediment from within the sump. Run-
off from this area will be collected in a dedicated sump and water will 
be recycled/re-used wherever possible. Where recovery is not 
possible, water from the sump system will be emptied to a 
dedicated storage tank prior to its removal from site for authorised 
disposal by a suitably licensed contractor. 
3.3.9 
Site roads should be cleaned regularly, and damped down if necessary 
to prevent nuisance dust. Site vehicle movements should be kept to a 
minimum and, where possible, restricted to paved haulage routes. 
Vehicle speeds will be limited to 10 km/h. The idling of vehicles will be 
kept to a minimum. 
3.3.10 
The main contractor will have responsibility on a day to day basis for 
determining if either the nature of the activities on site or weather 
conditions would be likely to result in the unacceptable transfer of dust

off site. In cases where this is anticipated, remedial action will be taken 
to minimise emissions, including the application of appropriate control 
measures, or if necessary, the temporary suspension of works. 
3.3.11 
Good site management practices during the construction works will 
help to prevent the generation of airborne dust. It will be the 
responsibility of the nominated main contractor and site manager to 
ensure through the final CEMP that sufficient precautionary measures 
to limit dust generation are in fact taken.

Pollution and Groundwater 
3.4
3.4.1 
Desk based assessment of the area around the Project Site have 
not revealed levels of contamination which are likely to pose a risk 
to human health or cause a statutory nuisance. Intrusive ground 
investigations will be undertaken at the Project Site prior to construction 
which will further define the exact nature of ground conditions. 
However, based on evidence to date, there are not anticipated to 
be any significant issues with contamination at the Project Site. 
3.4.2 
Land under which the Project will be developed has remained as 
undeveloped greenfield land and therefore there is low likelihood of 
contamination. 
3.4.3 
Professional standards and guidance relating to contamination will 
be consulted to provide advice on best practice mitigation measures 
which will be employed during the construction/demolition phase of the 
Project. 
3.4.4 
This multi-stage process is only to cover unexpected contamination. 
3.4.5 
Sensitive receptors are as follows:- 
 
Construction workers (during excavation and works); 
 
Site users; 
 
Groundwater; and 
 
Surface water bodies. 
3.4.6 
There is a small risk of construction workers coming into contact with 
contaminated soils and groundwater during construction. 
3.4.7 
There will be no access to construction areas by the general 
public. 
3.4.8 
The site will be secured to avoid unauthorised access and contact with 
contaminated soil or groundwater. 
3.4.9 
In the case that unidentified contaminant “hotspots” showing visual of 
olfactory evidence of contamination are discovered during construction 
works, the following procedure will be applied: 
 
Stop work immediately; 
 
Report the discovery to the construction manager; 
 
Seal off the area to contain the spread of contaminants;

 
Clear the area to ensure there is nothing that could cause fire or 
explosion; 
 
Contact the regulator or local authority once it is confirmed that 
contamination is found; 
 
Arrange for testing to be carried out and agree changes to the 
existing contamination strategy; and 
 
Record details of the incident, including photos and relevant 
information on the Environmental Incident Report Form. 
3.4.10 
Any material which is excavated and free from visual and 
olfactory evidence of contamination will be stockpiled and tested for 
metal (and other determinants) for reuse on site. Any soils which are 
considered to be contaminated hotspots (either identified through 
testing or through visual or olfactory evidence of contamination on site) 
will be removed and disposed of by a suitably licensed contractor or 
treated on-site. 
3.4.11 
All water from dewatering activities shall either be transported off site 
by a suitably licensed contractor or treated on site. Any proposed 
discharges to existing land drains (or other surface water bodies) will 
be undertaken in accordance with the requirements of the EA 
Regulatory Position Statement on temporary water discharges from 
excavations. 
3.4.12 
Where soils are imported onto the site then they shall be subject to 
testing to ensure contaminated soils are not being brought onto 
the site. 
3.4.13 
Speed restrictions will be imposed onsite to minimise disturbance of 
bare surfaces. Measures shall also be put into place to ensure that the 
length of time bare surfaces are left exposed are minimised. 
3.4.14 
Precautions will be undertaken in accordance with the EA’s Pollution 
Prevention Guidance to ensure that silt laden runoff, arisings or 
chemicals are not allowed to enter watercourses. Measures will 
include, testing of arisings to see whether they are suitable for reuse on 
site, siting stockpiles well away from watercourses, covering stockpiles 
in inclement weather, use of impermeable liners and use of fixing 
agents. 
3.4.15 
Although the main contractor undertaking the works will be required to 
produce a risk assessment and method statement detailing how 
they will minimise the risk of coming into contact with potentially 
contaminated materials, the following can be considered as a guide for 
the final CEMP:

3.4.16 
Compliance with the mitigation measures set out in the following 
documents: 
 
Protection of Workers and the general public during the 
development of contaminated land (HSE 1991); and 
 
If applicable, a guide to safe working on contaminated sites R132 
(CIRIA 1996). 
3.4.17 
The use of deep bore soakaways (including boreholes or other 
structures that bypass the soil layers) at the site carries groundwater 
pollution risks and for surface water or effluent disposal are only 
acceptable if it can be demonstrated that: 
 
there are no other feasible disposal options such as shallow 
soakaways (for surface water) or drainage fields/mounds (for 
effluents) that can be operated in accordance with current British 
Standards;  
 
the system is no deeper than is required to obtain sufficient 
soakage; 
 
pollution control measures are in place; 
 
a risk assessment demonstrates that no unacceptable discharge to 
groundwater will take place, in particular that inputs of hazardous 
substances to groundwater will be prevented; and 
 
that there are sufficient mitigating factors or measures to 
compensate for the increased risk arising from the use of deep 
structures. Details of mitigation and procedures should be provided 
through 
the 
preparation 
of 
the 
Construction 
Environment 
Management Plan (CEMP), necessary to satisfy draft DCO 
Requirement 11. 
3.4.18 
Work will be carried out in accordance with best practices and 
safe working practices will be maintained. 
3.4.19 
Construction workers will wear appropriate personal protective 
equipment (PPE) for the nature of works being undertaken. This will 
involve standard site PPE, plus overall, gloves and eye protection. 
3.4.20 
Additional measures that will likely be taken are: 
 
Eating, drinking and smoking will be limited to a designated ‘clean’ 
area of the site; 
 
Site welfare facilities will be made available; 
 
All workers will be required to wash their hands and remove 
overalls/boots when moving from ‘dirty’ to ‘clean’ areas of the site;

 
Any soils excavated which are considered to be potentially 
contaminated (e.g. visual or olfactory evidence) will be reported to 
site management and left alone until their appropriate treatment. 
Suitable training will be provided to site personnel to ensure the 
correct identification of potentially contaminated soils by olfactory 
means; and 
 
Water inflows to excavated areas will be minimised by the use of 
lining materials, good housekeeping techniques and by the control 
of drainage and construction materials in order to prevent the 
contamination of ground water. Site personnel will be made aware 
of the potential impact on ground and surface water associated 
with certain aspects of the construction works to further reduce the 
incidence of accidental impacts. 
 
Measures should be taken to avoid/minimise the potential for 
fuel and chemical spills. A spill response procedure will also apply 
on- site; and indicative procedure is shown in Insert 3.1 below.

Surface Water 
3.5
3.5.1 
To ensure that there will be no discharges to any watercourses as a 
result of construction activities at the Project Site, the following matters 
should be included in the detailed CEMP: 
 
Oil storage will be undertaken in accordance with the Control of 
Pollution (Oil Storage) Regulations 2001. Storage tanks will be 
located on an impervious base provided with bund walls to give 
a containment capacity of the greater of 110 per cent of the 
largest tank volume within the bund or 25 per cent of the total 
storage capacity of all tanks within the bund. All valves and 
couplings will be contained within the bunded area; 
 
Any surface water which has the potential to be contaminated 
by hydrocarbons (e.g. from car parks), which are used during the 
construction phase, to be passed through oil interceptor(s) prior to 
discharge; 
 
Measures will be taken to ensure that no leachate, or any 
surface water that has the potential to be contaminated, will be 
allowed to enter directly or indirectly into any water course, 
underground strata or adjoining land; 
 
Provisions will be made so that all existing drainage systems 
continue to operate; 
 
Water inflows to excavated areas will be minimised by the use of 
lining materials, good housekeeping techniques and by the control 
of drainage and construction materials in order to prevent the 
contamination of ground water. Site personnel will be made aware 
of the potential impact on ground and surface water associated 
with certain aspects of the construction works to further reduce the 
incidence of accidental impacts; 
 
Refuelling of construction vehicles and equipment will be restricted 
to a designated area with properly designed fuel tanks and bunds 
and suitable operating procedures; and 
 
The British Standard Code of Practice for Earthworks BS 
6031:1981 and British Standard Code of Practice for Foundations 
BS 8004:1086 contains detailed methods that will be adopted 
during construction. 
 
Ecology 
3.6
3.6.1 
Relevant works to protect/mitigate impacts on ecology and biodiversity 
are described in more detail in the ES. The preparation of the CEMP 
will be consistent with the best practice advice on CEMPs contained 
within Chapter 10 of BS42020 (or its updates). Appropriate regard for

- 31 - 
the protection of local habitats and protected species during the 
construction works will be included within the CEMP and will 
incorporate the following measures: 
 
Work compounds and access tracks etc. will not be located in, or 
adjacent to, areas that maintain habitat value; 
 
Site fencing will be used to prevent access to areas outside 
working areas, particularly in areas adjacent to features of 
ecological value; 
 
Procedures will be implemented to address site safety issues, 
including storage of potentially dangerous materials; 
 
Briefings 
and 
instruction 
would 
be 
given 
to 
contractors 
regarding the biodiversity issues associated with the site; and 
 
Pollution prevention guidelines provided by the Environment 
Agency (including but not limited to PPG01, PPG02, PPG03, 
PPG05 and PPG06) would be followed to prevent pollution of water 
courses by silt or chemicals. 
3.6.2 
An Ecological Clerk of Works will be appointed to undertake pre-
construction ecological surveys, supervise vegetation clearance and be 
available to advise the contractor and liaise with the County Ecologist 
and Natural England should protected species be found or disturbed 
during the construction process. 
 
Landscape and Visual Impacts 
3.7
3.7.1 
The following mitigation measures, as outlined in the ES will be 
implemented during the construction phase in order to specifically limit 
impacts on landscape and visual amenity of the surrounding area: 
 
Land / vegetation clearance and occupation will be limited to the 
minimum necessary for the works; 
 
Temporary protection of trees and hedgerows and other vulnerable 
features will be undertaken in accordance with BS5837:2012 or its 
updates. Details of existing trees to be retained, with measures for 
their protection, will be submitted for the approval of MSDC prior to 
the 
commencement 
of 
development 
in 
accordance 
with 
Requirement 5. An Arboricultural Clerk of Works will be appointed 
to ensure protection measures are implemented and maintained 
during construction and to liaise with MSDC Tree Officer as 
required. ; 
 
Temporary storage of soils and other material considered of value 
for retention. Where practical stockpiles would be sited to screen 
the construction works from highly sensitive receptors;

 
Construction areas will be laid out to minimise adverse impacts 
arising from temporary structures, construction activities and 
lighting; 
 
Construction roads will use the same route as permanent access 
roads where possible; 
 
Use of construction site lighting outside normal working hours will 
be restricted to the minimum necessary for workforce and public 
safety, and for security. Directional luminaries will be used to limit 
unwanted light spill; A detailed scheme of lighting for the 
Construction period will be agreed with MSDC see 3.9 below. 
 
Maintenance of tidy and contained site Compounds; 
 
Temporal measures including the removal of all temporary 
structures and stockpiles when no longer required, and prompt 
reinstatement of construction areas; 
 
Reinstatement of all agricultural land required temporarily during 
construction, and a 5 year aftercare plan to seek to ensure land is 
returned to its former productivity; and 
 
Replacement of all trees, shrubs and hedgerows removed to 
accommodate the utility Connections, subject to NG locational 
planting constraints.  
 
A detailed scheme for the restoration of land occupied during the 
construction period will be agreed with the relevant local authority 
 
The location and installation of the gas pipeline shall be such so as 
to, wherever possible, minimise future constraints on planting as 
indicated in the Eye Airfield Development Framework 
 
Archaeology / Cultural Heritage 
3.8
3.8.1 
An 
assessment 
of 
the 
potential 
archaeological 
and 
cultural 
heritage resource at the site has been undertaken as part of the ES.  
3.8.2 
Written Schemes of Investigation (WSI) have been prepared for the 
further evaluation and excavation to be undertaken prior to the start of 
construction.  
 
Artificial Lighting 
3.9
3.9.1 
The Project Site will require artificial lighting during construction to 
provide a safe working site during hours of darkness. An Outline 
Lighting Layout (Document number: 2.10) has been prepared to 
support the DCO Application. The general design objectives that will 
be used to ensure that adverse effects of lighting associated with

- 33 - 
demolition and construction of the Project are minimised are listed 
below: 
 
Use appropriately designed luminaires for the task at hand; 
 
Use louvres and shields to prevent undesirable light break-out; 
 
Demolition and construction lighting should be directed away 
from all sensitive receptors; 
 
Preference should be given to several, lower lighting units 
rather than tall, wide beam lighting units to illuminate large areas 
as it will limit light trespass, glare and sky glow from the plant; 
 
Vehicle lights should be properly directed (conforming to MOT 
requirements) and lenses must be intact to prevent un-
necessary glare and light intrusion; 
 
Lighting should be reduced or switched off when not required 
for safety purposes. Security lighting should be kept at the 
minimum level needed for visual and security protection; and
 
Motion sensitive lighting will be used in order to avoid 
unnecessary lighting. 
3.9.2 
Arrangements for construction lighting following these principles should 
be set out in the final CEMP, to be agreed with MSDC. 
 
Equestrian Management 
3.10
3.10.1 
Due to known equestrian activity in and around the villages to the west 
of the A140, the safety of horses and their riders in the vicinity of the 
Project Site must be a consideration, particularly during the 
construction and decommissioning phases when traffic and plant 
movements will be at their highest. 
3.10.2 
In order to ensure safety of horses and their riders, PPL will work with 
SCC, MSDC, and the community liaison group (see section 2.6 above) 
to agree a scheme of mitigation for horses and equestrians that is in 
line with guidance produced by the British Horse Society. 
3.10.3 
The types of mitigation to be agreed may include: 
 
Use of advance signage on the approach to the construction area 
to provide warning to horse riders and equestrians (signage should 
be of a suitable, secure type to ensure it does not pose a risk to 
horse and rider safety, i.e. no loose, flapping boards of plastic), 
 
Maintenance of sight lines, wherever practical, to  avoid sudden 
exposure of equestrians to construction activities

- 34 - 
 
Use of noise attenuation measures such as low level acoustic 
screening in areas closest to equestrian routes, where practicable, 
and subject to safety requirements relating to visibility and access. 
 
The use of banks men to provide plant operators with warning of 
approaching horses so that appropriate action can be taken (such 
as stopping 20m from crossing points and turning off engines until 
horses have passed). 
 
Use of appropriate, secure fencing and gates to ensure horses 
cannot stray into construction areas. 
 
Instruction of construction staff regarding correct behaviour in close 
proximity of horses and riders. 
3.10.4 
It is not anticipated that any special surfacing measures will be 
required as the construction will only affect short sections of tarmac 
road currently used by equestrians. This road is to be excavated, and 
then reinstated to its original condition. In the event that temporary 
surfaces are required, these will be designed to be compatible with 
British Horse Society guidelines. 
 
Protection of Historic Field Boundaries 
3.11
3.11.1 
Temporary protection of historic field boundaries will be undertaken in 
tandem with the temporary protection of trees and hedgerows. Historic 
field boundaries within the Order Limits that are to be specifically 
protected are identified in the Protected Field Boundaries Plan at 
Appendix A. In addition, PPL commits to retain all historic field 
boundaries within the Order Limits, other than the lengths that are 
listed in Table 3.1. 
3.11.2 
Protective measures and working methodologies required in order to 
protect the historic field boundaries that PPL has committed to 
specifically protect or to retain (i.e. all historic field boundaries within 
the Order Limits other than the lengths that are listed in Table 3.1 
below) would be determined following: 
 
the undertaking by PPL of an arboriculture assessment report of 
the historic field boundaries to be impacted by the development; 
 
the undertaking by PPL of a detailed site survey of the historic field 
boundaries to be impacted by the development, such survey to 
include a topographic survey, and preparation of a method 
statement for the protection of retained boundaries and features in 
liaison with SCC in order to agree  with SCC appropriate barriers, 
ground protection and stand-off.

3.11.3 
Protective measures/working methodologies are likely to include, but 
not be limited to, the following: 
1. All field boundaries (FBs): Demarcate section of boundarie sto be 
retained on the ground, using unique and readily visible materials 
and erect appropriate signage, barriers, and ground protection at 
agreed stand-off distance, prior to the commencement of 
construction, so as to avoid accidental damage; 
2. FBs 1,4,7,9,16,17: a) Demarcate section of boundaries to be 
permanently removed on the ground, using unique and readily 
visible materials and erect appropriate signage, prior to the 
commencement of construction, so as to avoid exceeding agreed 
lengths (see Table 3.1); b) Record sections of boundaries to be 
removed in accordance with the archaeological WSI to be finalised 
as part of the approval of the Written Scheme of Investigation 
pursuant to Requirement 9 of the DCO; 
3. FB9: a) Undertake a viability assessment of hedgerow coppicing on 
FB9; b) undertake a viability assessment of plating over/bridging of 
FB9 (GIS); 
4. FB9: a) Following the viability assessments referred to in point 3 
above,  and assuming a positive outcome to the viability 
assessment demarcate section of boundary hedgerow to be 
temporarily removed on the ground, using unique and readily visible 
materials 
and 
erect 
appropriate 
signage, 
prior 
to 
the 
commencement of construction, so as to avoid compromising 
agreed mitigation; b) coppice hedgerow along defined section, c) 
plate/bridge over to create construction access across boundary, 
and d) construction operations to be undertaken in accordance with 
agreed working methodology (to be finalised as part of the approval 
of the Final CEMP pursuant to Requirement 11 of the DCO); 
5. All FBs: Appointment of Archaeological Monitor to ensure protection 
measures are implemented and maintained during construction and 
to liaise with SCC.  Archaeological Monitor would regularly inspect 
all identified historic boundaries throughout the construction phase i) 
to assess for signs of deterioration or accidental damage, ii) to 
assess the adequacy and effectiveness of the protective measures 
and working methodologies, and iii) to review/amend them, as 
necessary.

CONCLUSIONS
4
4.1.1
This outline CEMP provides a framework on which the construction
contractor should base a more detailed CEMP.
4.1.2
Mitigation measures have been outlined to limit impacts of noise levels,
air quality, contaminated land and groundwater, ecology, archaeology
and cultural heritage, landscape and visual amenity and artificial
lighting. These mitigation measures should be taken forward for further
consideration when preparing the detailed CEMP.
4.1.3
It has also outlined a series of general best practice principles which
should be adhered to, including; a register of environmental impacts,
the production of risk assessments and Method Statements, the
adherence to Site Environmental Standards, the production of an
operations Environmental Management System, dealing with Public
