Electricity Market Reform Consultations (“EMR”) – December 2010
What it does
Our View
Feed-in-
tariffs for
low carbon
generation
 Contract for difference feed-in-tariff
 Proposed as lead support for
renewables post 2017
 Level playing field for new entrants and
independent generators
 Greater income stability
 Value to consumer – no windfall profits
Capacity
payments
for back-up
generation
 Proposal focused on extreme peak
demand
 5GW provided by low-load peaking
plant from 2020
 Too narrow to provide desired security of
supply
Advocate alternative – ensure adequate returns
for making capacity available
Reward flexibility
Carbon
price floor
 Boost returns from low carbon
generation
 Expensive for the consumer – windfall profits
 Supports specific technologies – likely to distort
wholesale market
 Does not achieve CO2 abatement across EU

generation has a great deal of
potential to help us meet our

API2 is the main reference price (including cost, freight and insurance) for steam coal to be delivered to
Amsterdam, Rotterdam and Antwerp. API4 is the reference price for steam coal to be delivered free on
board (“FOB”) to Richards Bay, South Africa. API6 is the reference price for steam coal to be delivered
FOB to Newcastle, Australia.
API2/4/6
CESP has been created as part of the Government's Home Energy Saving Programme. It requires gas
and electricity suppliers and electricity generators to deliver energy saving measures to domestic
consumers in specific low income areas of Great Britain. CESP came into force on 1 September
2009. The CESP obligation period will run from 1 October 2009 to 31 December 2012.

Appendix 10: Plant Flexibility
The market provides power to meet forecast demand - it
does not provide the required system reserve/flexibility
National Grid (NG) must maintain both positive and
negative reserve to balance the system second by second

Upward response to sudden loss in generation or increase in
demand

Downward response to sudden loss in demand or increase in
generation

To respond generation needs to be reliable and controllable
Flexibility on the system is achieved by NG trading with
plant to get a position that provides room to turn up
generation (head-room) or turn down generation (foot-
room)
Why is this important to Drax?
Increasing wind and nuclear generation lowers the amount
of flexible plant able to run in low demand periods
In future inflexible plant may be ‘bought off’ and replaced
with flexible units to provide the required reserve levels

To reduce their price exposure, NG contracted 3 Drax units for
Summer 2010 overnights

Part loaded to 420MW; capable of providing +90 / -70MW per unit
in 10 seconds
Example - Snapshot Period 11 Sunday June 27th 2010
NG was presented with a system that was 800MW long

Estimated Footroom of c1.5GW, headroom of 6GW.
In order to balance the system and provide the required
flexibility, the grid had to reposition 26 units.

Increased output on 20 units and desynchronised 5
