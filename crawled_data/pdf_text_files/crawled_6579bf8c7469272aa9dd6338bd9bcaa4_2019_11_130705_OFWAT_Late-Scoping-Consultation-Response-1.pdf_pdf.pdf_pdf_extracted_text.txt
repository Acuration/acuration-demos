LATE SCOPING CONSULTATION RESPONSES 
 
Consultation bodies have 28 days to respond with any comments, 
stating either the information that they consider should be included 
in the ES or that they do not have any comments. 
 
Any responses received after the deadline will not be considered 
within the scoping opinion but are forwarded to the applicant for 
consideration in accordance with the policy set out in Advice Note 
7: Environmental Impact Assessment, Screening and Scoping. 
 
The following EIA scoping consultation responses were received 
after the consultation deadline specified under legislation and 
therefore did not form part of the Secretary of State's scoping 
opinion.
