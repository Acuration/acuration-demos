Consultees

The local community and non-statutory interest groups. 
s42
Statutory consultees as defined by the Planning Inspectorate: includes 
local authorities and government bodies such as the Environment 
Agency, landowners and significantly affected persons.
s48
Publicity (notices published in regional and national newspapers)
What is Consultation? Non-statutory
•
A developer may engage with the local community and any affected parties 
in a number of different ways but is not legally required to do so. This could 
be done by: 
•
Meetings with local authorities, including Parish Councils
•
Non statutory exhibitions
•
Press releases, radio and TV interviews
•
etc
•
This form of consultation at an early stage is a great way of understanding 
the key local concerns and may inform the evolution of the Project design.
