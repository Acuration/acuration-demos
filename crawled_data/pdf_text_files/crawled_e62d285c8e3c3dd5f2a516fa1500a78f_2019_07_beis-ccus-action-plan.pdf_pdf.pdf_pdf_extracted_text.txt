Foreword
As the Prime Minister said in her foreword to the Clean Growth 
Strategy, “Clean growth is not an option, but a duty we owe to the 
next generation”. 
To demonstrate this commitment, 
the Government has placed Clean 
Growth at the heart of our modern 
Industrial Strategy and it has become 
a great British success story; we have 
demonstrated that growth of our 
national income can go hand in hand 
with cutting greenhouse emissions.
Integral to our modern Industrial 
Strategy is the determination to 
seize the opportunities that drive 
productivity, and to foster emerging 
sectors that have the potential to 
create new high-value jobs, industries 
and companies. Innovation in 
decarbonisation technologies drives 
Clean Growth, meaning that not 
only are we rapidly decarbonising 
parts of the domestic economy, 
but we are successfully exporting 
goods and services around the 
world. This progress now means 
there are more than 390,000 jobs 
in low carbon businesses and their 
supply chains, employing people in 
locations right across the country.
I believe that carbon capture, usage 
and storage (CCUS) represents a huge 
opportunity for the UK to become a 
global leader in a technology which 
will have a key role to play in tackling 
climate change – one of the most 
pressing global challenges. And we 
share in the broad international 
consensus that CCUS will be essential 
to meet the ambitions set out in the 
Paris Agreement, reinforced by the 
IPCC’s recent 1.5 degree Special Report.
CCUS deployment has the potential 
to support decarbonisation in several 
ways. Firstly, for countries such as the 
UK who have made great progress in 
decarbonising power, we know that 
flexible gas generation still has a role 
to play in generation as we transition to 
the inexpensive but intermittent world 
of renewables; CCUS technologies 
can help to take the carbon out of this 
valuable service. Secondly, I believe 
that if we are to enjoy the benefits of 
a broad and thriving industrial base in 
the second half of the century, CCUS 
gives us credible routes to decarbonise 
the processes that underpin many of 
these sectors. In the coming decades 
CCUS has the potential to be an 
4
 5
essential component of thriving low 
carbon industrial centres. Finally, 
CCUS could play a pivotal role in the 
huge challenge of decarbonising 
heat, through the development of 
the hydrogen economy, especially in 
countries with advanced gas networks.
The main barriers now are not 
technological: rather, government 
and the sector need to work together 
to build the frameworks to enable 
CCUS to deploy at scale. This is a 
partnership, but one in which we must 
be clear that government can only be 
expected to bear the irreducible risks, 
and where market mechanisms must 
come to bear to deliver best value 
solutions for taxpayers. The companies 
involved, many of whom rely on fossil 
fuels for the bulk of their revenues, 
must see finding routes to deploying 
CCUS solutions as an essential to their 
license to operate, as well as a chance 
to share in the economic rewards of 
leading in this burgeoning sector. This 
report delivers a plan to work with 
them to deliver on this opportunity.

Executive Summary
We are committed to playing a leading role in supporting 
the development of the technologies of the future. Carbon 
capture usage and storage (CCUS) is one of the most promising 
technologies. 
CCUS has economy-wide qualities 
which could be very valuable to 
delivering clean industrial growth. 
It could deliver tangible results 
in tackling some of the biggest 
challenges we face in decarbonising 
our economy, contributing to industrial 
competitiveness and generating new 
economic opportunities – a key part 
of our modern Industrial Strategy. 
Our vision is to become a global 
leader in CCUS, unlocking the 
potential of the technology and 
securing the added value which it 
can bring to our industrial centres 
and businesses all across the UK. 
Our ambition is that the UK should 
have the option to deploy CCUS at 
scale during the 2030s, subject to 
the costs coming down sufficiently. 
Our Industrial Strategy set out four 
Grand Challenges to put the UK at 
the forefront of the industries of 
the future. The Clean Growth Grand 
Challenge seeks to maximise the 
advantages for UK industry from 
the global shift to clean growth. 
CCUS can be an important part 
of achieving these objectives.
However, no technology can proceed 
at any price. We will look to ensure that 
the CCUS industry can operate within 
a supportive business environment 
that delivers a cost reduction 
trajectory, and in return we expect that 
industry will play the leading role in 
delivering CCUS. Our CCUS innovation 
programmes will continue to support 
cost reduction and position the UK 
as a leader in CCUS technologies 
and enabling infrastructure. 
In parallel, we will shift our approach 
to focus on domestic deployment 
by continuing to work with industry, 
building on the CCUS Cost Challenge 
Taskforce report, to identify cost 
effective private sector-led ways of 
developing, financing and delivering 
CCUS. Central to this will be the 
conclusion of our review of CCUS 
Delivery and Investment Frameworks 
in 2019, which, working with industry, 
will seek to identify investable 
commercial models and establish 
market-based frameworks for bringing 
forward CCUS. In addition, our new 
Industrial Energy Transformation 
Fund will provide funding for a range 
of transformative decarbonisation 
investments potentially including 
fuel switching and carbon capture.
 7
Through our Clean Growth Strategy 
we re-affirmed our commitment to the 
domestic deployment of CCUS subject 
to cost reduction. This Plan sets out our 
next steps to progress this commitment. 
We are committed to the UK having 
the option to deploy CCUS at scale 
during the 2030s subject to the 
costs coming down sufficiently. To 
realise our ambition, our Action 
Plan is designed to enable the 
development of the first CCUS 
facility in the UK, commissioning 
from the mid-2020s.
We will not deploy CCUS at any price, 
however, and the first CCUS facility will 
need to demonstrate that it will be cost 
effective. In 2019 we will commence 
detailed engagement with industry 
on the critical challenges to delivering 
CCUS in the UK, in particular the cost 
structures, risk sharing arrangements 
and the necessary market mechanisms 
which take full advantage of innovation 
and competition. This work will support 
the review of delivery and investment 
frameworks, described in more detail in 
this document. This engagement will be 
an important further step in assessing 
whether CCUS can be sustainably 
financed in the UK and credibly 
demonstrate value for money for 
consumers, businesses and taxpayers.
Our vision and ambition can only be 
achieved through close Government 
and industry partnership, and 
our commitment is contingent 
on industry joining us in meeting 
the challenge of delivery. 
`
`  This Action Plan is designed to enable the development of the first 
CCUS facility in the UK, commissioning from the mid-2020s.
`
`  Commissioning of the first CCUS facility from the mid-2020s would 
help the UK to meet our ambition of having the option to deploy CCUS 
at scale during the 2030s, subject to costs coming down sufficiently.

CCUS can help to deliver Clean Growth as 
part of the UK’s Industrial Strategy
This year marks 10 years since the passage of the Climate Change 
Act 2008, a world first. 
In this time we have shown that we 
can tackle climate change while 
delivering real economic growth – 
reducing emissions by more than 
40% since 1990 while growing the 
economy by more than two thirds. 
Our Clean Growth Grand Challenge 
seeks to maximise the advantages 
for UK industry that the global shift 
to clean growth presents. Through 
its potential role across the economy, 
coupled with the UK’s strengths in 
the technology, CCUS could play 
a central role in the transition to a 
low carbon economy and provide 
new markets for UK business. 
Through our modern Industrial 
Strategy we are dedicated to creating 
an economy that works for everyone. 
That means putting more money into 
research, development and innovation, 
investing in skills throughout the 
country and working with businesses 
to encourage growth in the areas 
where the UK has an advantage. 
It also means identifying and 
capturing the economic and industrial 
opportunities of the future. CCUS has 
the potential to play an important role 
in supporting our Industrial Strategy. 
CCUS could reduce emissions from 
our industrial centres, protecting 
existing industries and jobs, improving 
productivity and presenting 
opportunities for direct, low carbon 
investment. It is why our industrial 
centres in Scotland, South Wales, 
Humberside, Merseyside, and 
Teesside all see CCUS as central to 
their long-term competitiveness.
We see an opportunity for the UK 
to be a global technology leader in 
CCUS, and we are putting in place the 
foundations to achieve this and grasp 
the opportunities a growing global 
CCUS market presents. We are already 
well placed: innovative companies 
across the UK are developing cutting 
edge CCUS technologies; we have 
world leading academic institutions 
focused on solving key questions to 
reduce the costs of CCUS deployment; 
we have one of the largest potential 
carbon dioxide storage capacities in 
Europe; our existing industries have the 
skills and capability required to deploy 
CCUS at scale; and we are exploring 
investable commercial models to ensure 
a supportive business environment 
for those wishing to develop CCUS.

Enabling the UK’s first CCUS facility from the mid-2020s
Our Action Plan is aimed at establishing a cost-effective, 
investable, and sustainable pathway for CCUS that supports cost 
reduction and enables commercial deployment in the UK. 
We will seek to develop a new 
partnership between Government 
and industry to secure the benefits 
of CCUS to the UK. This joined 
up, integrated approach lies at 
the heart of our Action Plan. 
Delivering this will require significant 
collaboration with industry, 
academia and industrial centres. 
It will require collaborative effort 
to move beyond supporting CCUS 
through innovation to establishing 
CCUS infrastructure in the UK.
This will ensure that the business 
environment works for all involved 
in CCUS through developing the 
appropriate commercial frameworks 
to enable investment, innovation 
and cost reduction. Should the 
costs come down sufficiently this 
may enable the deployment of 
CCUS at scale in the 2030s.

CCUS has the potential to support 
strong local economies, creating 
high value jobs for people across the 
UK. The majority of our industrial 
centres have all identified that CCUS 
has an important role in supporting 
their competitiveness and creating 
low carbon industrial clusters. 
Our Action Plan aims, under the 
right circumstances, to enable the 
establishment of the first CCUS facility 
in the UK, operating commercially from 
the mid-2020s. Deployment would 
be subject to the value for money 
case being made and we envisage 
development being primarily led and 
financed by the private sector. 
We will work to position the UK as a 
global leader in CCUS through our 
leadership of multilateral organisations, 
working with our international partners 
to accelerate the global deployment 
of CCUS and support global cost 
reductions. An important element of 
this will be to continue to support our 
innovators to lead the way. We are 
committed to positioning the UK as 
a global leader in tackling the issues 
that have prevented the deployment 
of CCUS previously in the UK as well 
as globally. This Action Plan seeks 
to start a process of working in 
partnership with industry to address 
the commercial challenges while 
providing clarity on how we intend 
to meet our 2030s ambition.

Our Vision for Carbon 
Capture, Usage and Storage
We see an opportunity to become a global leader in CCUS. 
To achieve our vision, we are 
determined to grasp this opportunity, 
identified in our Clean Growth Strategy, 
to unlock the potential of CCUS and to 
secure the added value CCUS can bring 
to our industrial centres and businesses 
across the UK. Our ambition is that the 
UK should have the option to deploy 
CCUS at scale during the 2030s, subject 
to the costs coming down sufficiently.
Our vision and ambition can only be 
achieved through close Government 
and industry partnership, and 
our commitment is contingent 
on industry joining us in meeting 
the challenge of delivery. 
Successful delivery of our vision and 
ambition will mean joint industry and 
Government action and a growing CCUS 
industry committed to its development 
in the UK. It will mean we will know 
whether we have a scalable, cost-
competitive decarbonisation pathway 
that supports clean economic growth 
and the delivery of our carbon budgets, 
putting us at the forefront of a growing 
global CCUS market. An initial phase of 
deployment will be required if we are to 
know that this pathway is achievable.
It will also mean that we have 
secured the benefits laid out in 
the Industrial Strategy1 through:
`
`  Ideas: Being an innovation leader 
across the CCUS value chain, with new 
technologies being pulled through 
as a result of our initial deployment 
phase, driving further cost reductions 
and securing an increasing share of 
a global market as well as stimulating 
new products, markets and services.
`
`  People: Having the necessary skills 
base to support a domestic supply 
chain, extending the longevity of our 
offshore oil and gas and chemicals 
industries, securing high value jobs 
in key industrial sectors such as iron 
and steel, cement and chemicals 
and building an export opportunity.
`
`  Infrastructure: Developing a 
carbon dioxide infrastructure 
network to support decarbonisation 
across the economy, in particular 
those parts of the economy that 
are hardest to decarbonise.

`
`  Our vision is to become a global leader in CCUS, unlocking the 
potential of CCUS and securing the added value CCUS can bring 
to our industrial centres and businesses all across the UK. 
`
`  Our ambition is that the UK should have the option to deploy CCUS at

`
`  Our Action Plan aims to enable the establishment of the first CCUS

achieved through close Government and industry partnership.
Key messages
`
`  Business Environment: Developing 
a sustainable and investable 
commercial model for CCUS in the UK, 
supporting public-private partnerships 
and private sector investment, 
underpinned by appropriate risk 
sharing arrangements between 
Government and the private sector.
`
`  Places: Supporting local industrial 
competitiveness, supporting our 
industrial centres and attracting new 
high tech companies to their areas.
CCUS is thought to be central 
to a least cost energy system 
decarbonisation pathway to 2050. 
The Committee on Climate Change 
(CCC) stresses the importance of 
CCUS to “achieving an 80% emissions 
reduction at lowest cost, as well as 
its crucial role in enabling deeper 
emissions reduction beyond that”2. 
Modelling by the Energy Systems 
Catapult (ESC) for the Energy 
Technologies Institute (ETI)3 supports 
the conclusion by the CCC that energy 
system decarbonisation could be up to 
fifty per cent cheaper by 2050 if CCUS 
is deployed at scale4, and conclude that 
delaying deployment beyond the 2020s 
will increase the risks of decarbonising 
the UK’s energy system5. Both the CCC 
and ETI analysis concludes that initial 
deployment is required during the 
2020s in order to have the option of 
deploying at scale during the 2030s, 
and in particular to keep open the 
option of UK CCUS deployment towards 
the levels both state are required in 
2050. This timeline was endorsed by 
the CCUS Cost Challenge Taskforce6, 
and the conclusion was also reached 
by the Parliamentary Advisory Group 
on CCS7. A key message from all 
these independent bodies is that 
deployment of CCUS during the 2020s 
is essential to unlock the greatest 
opportunities for cost reduction. 
 15
Industrial Strategy Growing the Bioeconomy
The definition of the ‘scale’ in these 
reports which may be required 
between 2030 and 2050 varies 
widely, depending on application. 
For example, the CCC state that the 
scale of CCUS required by 2050 may 
be between 60-180 MtCO2/ year8,9, 
whilst ESC modelling shows capacity 
of ~80 MtCO2/ year by 204510. At 
an individual facility level, according 
to the Global CCS Institute, a large-
scale facility is defined as “involving 
the capture, transport and storage of 
carbon dioxide at a scale of at least 
400,000 tonnes of CO2 annually”11.
BEIS’ industrial decarbonisation 
and energy efficiency action plans 
highlighted the importance of CCUS 
for industrial decarbonisation across 
our energy intensive sectors12. Two 
of the three indicative pathways in 
the Clean Growth Strategy showed 
that CCUS could play a key role in 
decarbonisation of heat, power, and 
in providing negative emissions13. 
As we set out in the Industrial Strategy, 
the role of Government is not to pick 
winners and subsidise or protect them. 
The Strategy’s Grand Challenges 
advocate taking a mission-based 
approach to innovation14, an approach 
that we have followed in progressing 
CCUS. This means that we set ambitious 
goals and make decisions focused 
on achieving these. Our ambition to 
develop CCUS at scale during the 
2030s, subject to costs coming 
down sufficiently, is one such goal. 
A CCUS project, incorporating capture, 
transport and storage infrastructure, 
takes between five and eight years 
from commencing detailed engineering 
work to operation15. Therefore to 
support meeting our ambition of 
having the option of deploying CCUS 
at scale during the 2030s, subject 
to costs coming down sufficiently, 
we can use the 2020s to test and 
develop CCUS in the UK context. 
We recognise that this also needs to 
be supported by market mechanisms 
that bring in private investment and 
enable a clear cost reduction pathway, 
by taking full advantage of innovation 
and competition. To achieve this, we 
will seek to progress CCUS in the UK 
through a staged approach, to allow 
us, and industry, to develop and test 
commercial and regulatory concepts 
incrementally during the 2020s, 
including through initial deployment. 
The aim of this approach is to allow 
lessons to be learned and applied, to 
identify, test and then secure initial 
cost reductions with the ultimate goal 
of enabling commercial deployment 
of CCUS in the UK should it be cost 
effective and value for money to do so. 
A staged approach will enable us to 
assess progress against our ambition 
of having the option to deliver CCUS 
at scale during the 2030s, whilst 
monitoring costs and industry’s 
commitment to deploying CCUS in the 
UK and for all parties to learn by doing.

Developing CCUS will also support 
and contribute to the development 
of evidence to support decisions 
on the long term decarbonisation 
of heat, potential for the large 
scale use of hydrogen and the 
deployment of GGRs in the UK. 
In doing this, we recognise the 
need for continued cost reduction 
and are encouraged by recent 
evidence suggesting that the costs of 
capturing carbon dioxide are falling. 
Value for money and the cost of 
energy for consumers, businesses, 
and taxpayers will remain central 
to our consideration and we will 
monitor this on an ongoing basis. 
`
`  In 2019 we will commence 
detailed engagement with 
industry on the critical 
challenges to delivering CCUS 
in the UK, in particular the 
cost structures, risk sharing 
arrangements and the necessary 
market-based frameworks.

Action since the publication 
of the Clean Growth Strategy
The Government published its approach to CCUS in the Clean 
Growth Strategy in October 201716. 
This confirmed that we see CCUS 
as having the potential to support 
decarbonisation of the economy, 
subject to its costs coming down 
sufficiently. The approach confirmed 
that we see a new opportunity for the 
UK to become a global technology 
leader for CCUS. Working domestically 
and internationally with industry and 
other governments to accelerate 
global deployment and bring about 
global cost reductions, we will seek to 
progress CCUS through three themes.
Re-affirming our commitment 
to deploying CCUS in the UK, 
subject to cost reduction
`
`  Established CCUS Council: Our 
CCUS Council17, co-chaired by the 
Minister for Energy and Clean Growth 
and James Smith, former Chair of 
Shell UK and the Carbon Trust, has 
been set up to advise us on progress 
and priorities as set out in the Clean 
Growth Strategy, and to monitor 
costs and deployment potential.
 
`
`  Received CCUS Cost Challenge 
Taskforce report: The CCUS Cost 
Challenge Taskforce, established by 
the Minister for Energy and Clean 
Growth in January 2018, comprised 
forty-five leading experts from the 
CCUS, oil and gas, energy, finance, 
academic, and NGO sectors. The 
Taskforce published their report in 
July 201818, setting out their view on 
how to reduce the costs of deploying 
CCUS at scale in the UK. We set out 
the Government’s response to those 
recommendations in this Action Plan. 
`
`  Reviewing CCUS Delivery and 
Investment Frameworks: We have 
started a review of CCUS Delivery 
and Investment Frameworks in 
industry, power and carbon dioxide 
infrastructure, in order to understand 
and develop options for addressing 
the commercial barriers to deploying 
CCUS in the UK through market 
based frameworks. In parallel, we 
have continued to engage with CCUS 
project developers and potential CCUS 
industrial clusters around the UK.

International collaboration 
to drive down the cost and 
accelerate deployment of CCUS
The Intergovernmental Panel on 
Climate Change (IPCC) has said 
that CCUS will need to become a 
globally significant technology in 
order to address the challenge of 
reducing our emissions. Increasingly 
countries are looking at CCUS to 
support the decarbonisation of their 
economies. We will continue to work 
with other governments and industry 
to accelerate global deployment and 
drive down the costs of CCUS. We 
are playing a leading role in this. 
`
`  Accelerating CCUS Summit: Our 
global Accelerating CCUS Summit, 
co-hosted with the International 
Energy Agency (IEA), and conference 
with the Global CCS Institute, brought 
together governments, industry and 
others to discuss and agree concrete 
actions to accelerate deployment.
`
`  Mission Innovation: We have 
confirmed that we are, with 
Saudi Arabia and Mexico, leading 
the Mission Innovation CCUS 
Challenge19 and are also co-leading 
the Clean Energy Ministerial CCUS 
Initiative, with the United States, 
Norway, and Saudi Arabia20.
`
`  International CCUS Programme: 
We are continuing to support 
developing countries and emerging 
economies to develop their technical 
and institutional knowledge of 
CCUS through our £70 million 
international CCUS programme.
`
`  We are acting to advance the deployment of CCUS in the UK, 
and have established the CCUS Council, received and considered 
the CCUS Cost Challenge Taskforce’s report, and started a 
review of CCUS Delivery and Investment Frameworks. 
`
`  We are collaborating with international partners to drive down the 
cost and accelerate deployment of CCUS, including hosting our global 
Accelerating CCUS Summit with the International Energy Agency. 
`
`  We have announced CCUS innovation programmes worth £45 million.

Delivering our 2030s ambition
The Government has put achieving clean growth, while ensuring 
value for money for businesses and consumers, at the heart of our 
Industrial Strategy. 
We have been among the most 
successful countries in growing our 
economy while reducing emissions. 
Since 1990, we have cut emissions 
by 43 per cent23 while our economy 
has grown by over two thirds24. 
CCUS has a potentially significant 
role in supporting the UK to meet 
our legally binding target of reducing 
emissions by at least 80% compared 
to 1990 levels25. This is because CCUS 
could help the UK meet the challenges 
remaining in decarbonising our 
economy, primarily in how we provide 
low carbon heat and cut emissions 
from industry and transport, as well 
as supporting low carbon gas use. 
Our ambition for CCUS is consistent 
with our Industrial Strategy ambition 
of positioning the UK as “a leader in 
clean and efficient power, transport 
and heat through an integrated 
approach to decarbonising these 
increasingly connected systems”26.
Through our Clean Growth Grand 
Challenge, we aim to maximise the 
advantages for UK industry from the 
global shift to clean growth. The role 
that CCUS could play in the transition 
to a low carbon economy, coupled 
with the UK’s strengths in CCUS, 
means that development of CCUS 
technologies could strengthen local 
economies across the UK. It is why our 
industrial centres in Scotland, South 
Wales, Humberside, Merseyside, and 
Teesside all see CCUS as central to 
their long-term competitiveness.
That is why working with the UK’s 
industrial centres, the private 
sector, including energy intensive 
industries, oil and gas companies, the 
investment community and academia 
is central to progressing CCUS and 
achieving our 2030s ambition.

`
`  CCUS has a potentially significant role in supporting UK emissions 
reductions across several sectors, and in driving clean growth. 
`
`  We will complete our review of CCUS Delivery and Investment Frameworks, 
considering how to deliver a supportive business environment.
`
`  We will work with stakeholders to identify existing infrastructure that could 
be re-used to support CCUS projects and will develop a policy on re-use of 
infrastructure for the purpose of CCUS.

Development of CCUS in clusters
The CCUS Cost Challenge Taskforce27 and Lord Oxburgh’s 
Parliamentary Advisory Group on CCS28 recommended the 
deployment of CCUS in industrial centres. 
Both highlighted the opportunities to 
maximise economies of scale to lower 
the unit costs of developing a carbon 
dioxide infrastructure network in an 
industrial centre where costs across 
a number of users can be shared, if 
the right business model for carbon 
dioxide infrastructure is put in place. 
Deploying CCUS in industrial centres 
has the potential to allow a number 
of carbon capture applications – from 
industry, to hydrogen, to low carbon 
gas in power – to connect to shared 
carbon dioxide infrastructure, improving 
resilience of carbon dioxide supply, 
availability of carbon dioxide storage (if 
multiple pipelines and stores are used), 
and mitigating potential cross-chain 
risk. We will examine and report, during 
2019, on the opportunity of maximising 
economies of scale by developing 
shared carbon dioxide infrastructure 
network in an industrial centre, and the 
potential for cost effective deployment 
that provides value for money. 
Deploying CCUS in industrial centres 
is considered to have the added 
benefit of helping protect existing 
industry, increase productivity and 
encourage inward investment29. 
At a local and regional level, direct high 
value jobs in capital intensive industries, 
such as oil and gas, chemicals, and 
other energy intensive industries have 
been shown to support up to four jobs 
in indirect employment30. Decarbonising 
these industries, potentially through 
deployment of CCUS, allows their 
sustained contribution to economic 
growth both nationally and in the 
regions in which the industry is 
concentrated. This is a key reason why 
CCUS is being progressed in other 
European industrial centres such as 
the Port of Rotterdam31. Furthermore, 
skills and supply chains from the oil 
and gas and chemicals industries could 
transition to service a growing CCUS 
industry, allowing the retention and 
creation of further high value jobs. 
At this stage we recognise that 
a successful proposition for a 
CCUS facility and carbon dioxide 
infrastructure network could enable 
innovation, bring economies of 
scale and provide an integrated 
decarbonisation solution for a 
diverse range of industries, including 
the potential of using the carbon 
dioxide to create new products 
and services, stimulating clean 
growth within a defined place. 
Industrial Strategy Carbon Capture Usage and Storage
30
A successful proposition will be 
one that is supported by local and 
regional communities, authorities and 
businesses. It will need to be consistent 
with the market based framework set 
out by Government and include the 
wider industrial and economic benefits 
of establishing CCUS in the place.
Action: We will examine in detail the 
scope of the opportunity for maximising 
economies of scale by developing a 
shared carbon dioxide infrastructure 
network in an industrial centre, and 
will report in the first half of 2019.

Creating market mechanisms for CCUS
The barriers to deploying CCUS projects in the UK, and globally, 
are said to be primarily commercial, rather than technical32. 
These commercial barriers can increase 
the cost of financing projects, adding 
a “risk premium” to projects, and may 
prevent project developers from taking 
investment decisions. Our review of the 
delivery and investment frameworks 
for CCUS is seeking to understand 
these barriers and to identify potential 
ways to address them across CCUS 
in power generation and industry, 
and carbon dioxide transport and 
storage infrastructure. We are keen 
to see CCUS facilities brought forward 
through market mechanisms which 
take full advantage of innovation 
and competition, and the review, 
working with industry, will identify 
how this can best be established. 
This review is underway and we 
will consult on our findings in 2019, 
announcing the outcome of the review 
by the end of 2019. This outcome 
will include possible market-based 
frameworks for power CCUS and 
for industrial CCUS, and possible 
commercial models for carbon 
dioxide transport and storage.  
We will work with the CCUS industry 
and investors to gather their views 
on the proposed frameworks and 
enable detailed project development 
work to progress in parallel. The 
aim of proposing viable delivery and 
investment frameworks is to reduce 
the cost of financing CCUS projects, 
and, potentially, to allow project 
developers to take final investment 
decisions during the 2020s.
We will complete, and publish 
the outcome of, the review 
of delivery and investment 
frameworks by the end of 2019.

Industrial decarbonisation with CCUS
CCUS could be an important technology 
for decarbonising energy intensive 
industries (EIIs), including iron and steel, 
cement, chemicals, and oil refining33. 
Some of these industries produce 
volumes of emissions from chemical 
processes, in addition to combustion 
of fossil fuels, for example, up to 70% 
of emissions from cement production 
are from the process of producing 
cement, rather than from energy use34. 
These emissions cannot be abated 
by fuel switching or electrification. 
Overall, CCUS could provide 37% 
of the total abatement potential in 
EIIs by 205035. A recent study by 
McKinsey on decarbonising EIIs 
showed that where carbon dioxide 
storage sites are accessible, CCUS 
is the lowest-cost decarbonisation 
option at current commodity prices36. 
CCUS also enables the large-scale 
use of hydrogen as an industrial fuel, 
which the recent CCC and Element 
Energy reports have indicated could 
be one cost-effective pathway to 
industrial decarbonisation37,38.

 33
EIIs such as these and others employ 
approximately 1.5 million people across 
the UK, and contribute just over 8% 
UK GVA39. They are often important 
employers to local economies and 
tend to pay above the median wage40. 
The international competitiveness 
of our key industrial regions could 
be supported by early adoption 
of disruptive technologies such as 
CCUS, which could also drive inward 
investment, and create and protect 
jobs for a low carbon global economy.
CCUS in industry presents challenges, 
particularly commercially, due to 
the globally traded nature of the 
products and heterogeneity of the 
sector. Industrial emissions arise 
from a broad range of processes and 
industrial subsectors, each with their 
own challenges and requirements. 
CCUS in industry also has unique 
economic and market related risks. 
Industry has more flexibility in 
technology and location and relatively 
short investment timeframes of less 
than ten years. Carbon leakage41 is 
thought to be a risk for industries 
with globally traded commodities, as 
industry may seek to operate in the 
jurisdiction in which it is cheapest 
to emit greenhouse gases, rather 
than decarbonise, if they are not 
supported to do so. Suitable business 
models that incentivise carbon 
capture in industry will need to 
address these issues and be broadly 
applicable to a range of subsectors. 
There are nevertheless potential low 
cost capture opportunities. Recent 
analysis by the IEA estimated costs 
of carbon capture at around $28 per 
tonne for ammonia production, and 
$30 per tonne for ethanol production42. 
To help industry decarbonise, 
we have launched an Industrial 
Energy Transformation Fund, 
worth up to £315 million. This will 
provide funding for transformative 
decarbonisation investments, 
potentially including fuel switching 
and carbon capture. We will consult 
on the Fund’s design during 2019.
We are reviewing the barriers to 
the deployment of industrial carbon 
capture and we will consult on 
emerging findings, including on 
the market-based frameworks for 
industrial carbon capture, in the 
first half of 2019. So far, we have:
`
`  Commissioned Element Energy 
to review the commercial barriers 
to deployment and operation 
of industrial carbon capture 
infrastructure and identify a wide 
range of business models which 
could tackle these barriers to enable 
the cost-effective deployment of 
industrial carbon capture in the UK43. 
`
`  Received Element Energy’s 
assessment of the identified 
models according to a broad set of 
criteria that they developed, such 
as their commercial performance, 
cost-effectiveness, ability to 
drive cost-reductions, and sector-
specific implications in order 
to identify those which are the 
most promising (see Table 1).

`  Used the outputs from this study 
to inform further development 
of an industrial carbon

Decarbonising electricity generation with CCUS
The Government has set out four principles to guide future 
strategy for the power sector44. 
These are:
I.   We must, wherever possible, 
use market mechanisms 
that take full advantage of 
innovation and competition;
II.  Government must be prepared 
to intervene to provide insurance 
and preserve optionality;
III.  Energy regulation must be agile and 
responsive to opportunities; and
IV.  Consumers of all types should 
pay a fair share of system costs.
In reviewing the role of power 
CCUS, we are considering these four 
principles and how we use them in 
our approach to this technology.
CCUS can support decarbonisation 
of electricity generation, with gas, 
or biomass, fired generation with 
CCUS able to provide firm low carbon 
baseload and potentially mid merit 
power on a flexible basis44,45. It is 
important that if CCUS is to have a role, 
it will need to show it is a cost effective 
part of power sector decarbonisation.

Natural Gas Pipeline (TANAP) is a central part of the Southern 
Gas Corridor pipeline system. Image courtesy of BP plc. 
Industrial Strategy Carbon Capture Usage and Storage
36
There is consensus, including through 
electricity system modelling done by 
BEIS, the ESC and National Grid47, that 
there is a potential role for CCUS in 
decarbonising the electricity system, 
alongside an expansion of other forms 
of low- and zero-carbon generation. 
In particular, analysis has recognised 
the importance of firm, flexible low 
carbon power generation to achieve 
deep decarbonisation of the UK power 
sector48,49. CCUS could potentially 
provide this capability. Further analysis 
from the FlexEVAL project “shows the 
particular value of CCS to the UK’s 
electricity system and quantifies that 
flexible CCS allows the integration of a 
greater amount of renewable energy 
than would be otherwise possible”50. 
BEIS analysis shows that the levelised 
cost of electricity (LCOE) for a first-
of-a-kind combined cycle gas turbine 
(CCGT) with post-combustion carbon 
capture and storage could be around 
£75/MWh51, for a plant commissioning 
in 2025. The LCOE of a plant of this 
type was previously estimated to be 
£110/MWh52. These updated figures 
drew on recent work, including a 
report by Wood Group for BEIS53. 
A recent feasibility study by Summit 
Power, which was conducted with 
funding from the UK and Scottish 
Governments, of the Caledonia Clean 
Energy Project, a potential CCUS power 
plant based in Grangemouth, Scotland, 
showed that the plant could generate 
power at a strike price of around £80 to 
£90/MWh, subject to some commercial 
changes. The feasibility study also 
confirmed that the plant would be able 
to dispatch flexibly, with maximum 
ramp rates of 88MW/minute54. 
CCUS in power has been the focus 
of previous efforts to deploy and 
commercialise CCUS in the UK. 
Lessons learned from these efforts55 
have shown that challenges facing the 
technology include the lack of a generic, 
investable mechanism for power CCUS. 
In addition, recent research has shown 
that the flexibility of power CCUS 
could be a key component of the value 
which the technology can provide to 
the electricity system56. It is therefore

important that we understand, working 
with industry, the role CCUS has in the 
power sector and how best to ensure it 
is investable, including consideration of 
how to incentivise flexible operation of 
CCUS and other low carbon facilities. 
We have:
`
`  Commissioned Uniper Technologies 
Ltd. to provide updated technical 
and cost assumption data on power 
CCUS technologies57. We have used 
these updated assumptions to revise 
BEIS Levelised Cost of Electricity 
(LCOE) figures (see Table 2).
`
`  Updated our internal modelling to 
assess the value which CCUS can 
potentially provide to the electricity 
system. For example, considering 
the place of CCUS in the merit 
order and the nature of dispatch, 
including the ability of CCUS to 
provide electricity system services. 
`
`  Commenced work with Energy UK 
and the CCS Association to examine 
what an investable proposition 
for power CCUS could look like. 
`
`  Started further work to assess 
viable mechanisms for power 
CCUS, including testing whether 
a Contract for Difference is the 
most appropriate mechanism. 
`
`  Begun engagement with work led 
by BEIS considering the option of 
a regulated asset base model as a 
sustainable funding model for nuclear 
power projects. We will consider the 
implications of this work for potential 
future CCUS power projects..
We will, through joint working with 
industry, keep under review the 
role power CCUS has, and examine 
how it can provide the greatest 
value to the electricity system and 
support wider decarbonisation. 
We will consult on our emerging 
findings for a market based 
framework for power CCUS in 2019.

Carbon dioxide transport and storage infrastructure 
can support decarbonisation of our industrial centres
Carbon dioxide transport and storage infrastructure in the UK, 
incorporating pipelines and/ or shipping, is likely to be essential 
to support the decarbonisation of our industrial centres and 
deployment of CCUS at scale.
It will offIt will offer options to provide 
low carbon heat and electricity and 
enable the deployment of what are 
currently considered the most scalable 
GGR technologies – bioenergy with 
CCS (BECCS) and direct air capture58. 
The UK has a world-leading offshore oil 
and gas industry and strong domestic 
supply chain. It has an established skills 
base which is well-placed to develop a 
domestic carbon dioxide infrastructure 
network and export its expertise 
world-wide. With the potential to store 
more than 78 billion tonnes of carbon 
dioxide59, the UK can be a world leader 
in carbon dioxide storage services, 
providing new economic opportunities 
by providing carbon dioxide storage 
for UK and European emissions for 
over a hundred years60. A number of 
UK carbon dioxide storage sites are 
already well appraised, an advantage 
over other nations, and information on 
potential storage is available through 
the world-leading CO2 Stored database61.
Transport and storage infrastructure 
for carbon dioxide has previously been 
considered in the UK only in the context 
of ‘full-chain’ projects, where a single 
developer would build and operate the 
carbon capture, transport and storage 
infrastructure with subsequent projects 
linking in to this infrastructure. This 
model meant that the initial full chain 
project was incentivised through one 
mechanism with the lead organisation 
then sharing payments across the chain 
(capture, transport, and storage). For 
those projects that included a different 
carbon dioxide transport and storage 
operator this increased cross chain 
risk and in turn increased the price of 
potential CCUS projects. In response, 
the Review of Delivery and Investment 
Frameworks for CCUS is exploring 
whether a separate, investable business 
model for the transport and storage 
element of the CCUS chain would 
reduce risk and support a sustainable 
commercial model for CCUS in the UK. 
Our aim is to review the potential 
models that could best support the 
development of a commercial model to 
enable investment in, and deployment 
of carbon dioxide transport and 
storage infrastructure in the UK. 
 39
To take this forward we have:
`
`  Published work by Pale Blue Dot 
Energy Ltd. which identifies the key 
challenges which might constrain 
the development of carbon 
dioxide transport and storage 
infrastructure62. It defines the range 
of possible delivery and operating 
business models for carbon dioxide 
transport and storage infrastructure, 
and considers how these models can 
differently address the challenges 
identified. The work identified as 
groups of models including full public 
ownership, majority public ownership, 
a public private entity and a fully 
private venture. As part of the Review 
we will undertake further analysis to 
test their suitability in a UK context. 
`
`  Published work by Element 
Energy exploring the potential 
role that shipping, as a mode of 
transporting carbon dioxide to 
offshore geological storage sites, 
could play in reducing the cost of 
deploying CCUS in the UK63. 
`
` The study includes consideration 
both of shipping between sites within 
the UK, and from the UK to a third 
country. The work will improve the 
evidence base on the costings of 
carbon dioxide shipping and identify 
the circumstances in which shipping 
may represent value for money in 
the UK, relative to fixed pipelines.
`
`  Scoped a study to provide detailed 
advice on five potential delivery and 
investment models (see Table 3) 
for carbon dioxide infrastructure in 
the UK, building on the findings of 
the study by Pale Blue Dot Energy 
Ltd. This includes assessing the 
commercial performance of each 
model, and their associated costs, 
lead times, and set-up considerations. 
It will also consider specific carbon 
dioxide storage risks identified as 
a key issue by the Parliamentary 
Advisory Group on CCS and the 
CCUS Cost Challenge Taskforce.

There is potential for cost savings in 
initial CCUS projects which can re-use 
existing oil and gas infrastructure, an 
opportunity which has been identified 
by some project developers and 
the CCUS Cost Challenge Taskforce. 
Government will coordinate a process, 
in collaboration with project developers, 
owners of existing assets, and relevant 
regulators, to identify assets with 
potential for re-use. Government 
expects that regulators, developers 
and owners of existing assets will 
work closely together, where assets 
are identified with potential for re-use, 
in order to maximise the potential 
economic life of those assets. 
As part of our work to build a business 
environment that is supportive of 
deployment and cost reduction in 
CCUS, we will work with industry, 
the OGA, the Crown Estate, and 
Crown Estate Scotland over the 
first half of 2019 to provide further 
clarity on this issue by developing 
a policy on re-use of infrastructure 
for the purposes of transporting

Estate and The Crown Estate Scotland, in the first half of 2019, which

`
`  We will, in consultation with the OGA, Health and Safety Executive 
(HSE), Marine Management Organisation (MMO), Ofgem, industry, 
The Crown Estate, and The Crown Estate Scotland, develop a policy 
on re-use of infrastructure for CCUS in the first half of 2019.

CCUS can enable new industrial markets
CCUS can create new industries and markets through the use of 
carbon dioxide, such as chemicals, plastics, and building materials, 
with potential to use around 7GtCO2/year globally by 203064. 
Utilising carbon dioxide can also help 
improve the economics of CCUS 
projects and some uses, such as in 
cement and aggregate production, 
can support decarbonisation 
through permanent sequestration 
of carbon dioxide. Recent work by 
Carbon180 states that CCU products 
could access a multi trillion dollar 
market65. Implementing CCU to 
manufacture these innovative new 
low carbon products could contribute 
to cutting UK emissions, support 
the development of new carbon 
capture technologies, create new jobs, 
investment, and export opportunities 
for UK industries and SMEs. 
We will deliver our £20 
million CCU Demonstration 
programme by March 2021 
supporting the construction of 
CCU technologies at industrial 
sites across the UK. In total, we 
will deliver CCUS innovation 
programmes worth £45 million.

Low carbon hydrogen with CCUS
Low carbon hydrogen’s flexibility as an energy vector could 
enable it to play a complementary and enabling role, alongside 
electricity, in the decarbonisation of a range of sectors, including 
domestic and industrial heat, transport, and power66. 
 If the decision is taken to deploy low 
carbon hydrogen at scale, CCUS is likely 
to be required, as it is currently thought 
that the most cost-effective method of 
producing low carbon hydrogen at scale 
is through reformation of methane 
with CCUS67. The Government’s £20 
million Hydrogen Supply programme 
aims to accelerate the development 
of low carbon bulk hydrogen supply 
solutions68, specifically including 
methane reformation with CCUS, 
alongside other methods (such as 
electrolysis and import infrastructure).
The scale of low carbon hydrogen that 
might be required in the UK is currently 
uncertain. For example, hydrogen is 
one potential option for decarbonising 
heat, alongside biogas, heat pumps 
and heat networks. Government 
is laying the groundwork to set up 
decisions in the first half of the next 
decade on the long-term future of 
heat.69Hydrogen could also provide a 
cost-effective decarbonisation option in 
transport, particularly in heavy goods 
road transport, trains, and shipping, as 
highlighted by the CCUS Cost Challenge 
Taskforce. As mentioned above, recent 
reports have suggested that hydrogen 
could represent a cost-effective 
pathway to decarbonising industry; and 
it could also play a role in addressing 
the challenges of intermittency and 
long-term storage in the power sector.
There is also the potential for carbon 
dioxide captured from the production 
of low carbon bio-hydrogen, as well 
as of biomethane, to be stored, 
leading to negative emissions.70Low 
carbon gas from biomass is one of 
the potential routes to decarbonise 
homes, businesses and industry 
currently served by the gas grid71. 
The CCC’s recent report on bioenergy 
suggested that producing negative 
emissions could be the most valuable 
use of biomass by 205072. 
 43
Greenhouse Gas Removal technologies
The Paris Agreement includes an aim of achieving net zero global 
greenhouse gas emissions in the second half of the century. 
In their initial consideration of 
potential domestic action following the 
Agreement, the CCC concluded that 
GGR options will be required alongside 
widespread decarbonisation in order to 
reach net zero emissions73. This work is 
supported by the recent IPCC report on 
global warming of 1.5°C74. The report 
concluded that limiting global warming 
to this level would require reaching net 
zero carbon dioxide emissions around 
2050, and highlighted the importance 
of CCUS in achieving this. It also noted 
that all pathways with limited or no 
overshoot above 1.5°C project the use 
of carbon dioxide removal (i.e. GGR). 
Two of the most scalable GGR 
technologies, BECCS and direct air 
capture, will both require carbon 
dioxide infrastructure. As we set out 
in the Clean Growth Strategy, GGR 
technologies are likely to have an 
important role to play in offsetting 
difficult-to-cut emissions, by removing 
greenhouse gases from the air. 
We will publish work during 2019 
setting out policy options for 
responsibly developing GGRs.

The Royal Society and Royal Academy of Engineering have advised 
Government that even with very stringent emissions reductions across 
all sectors of the economy, around 130MtCO2/year would need to be 
accounted for by negative emissions technologies if the UK were to 
reach net zero emissions in 2050. To achieve this, they concluded 
that BECCS and Direct Air Capture at a significant scale – over 50% 
of the total amount of negative emissions – would be required75. 
Central to the report’s recommendations was to build carbon 
dioxide infrastructure, in order for permanent storage of 
carbon dioxide from BECCS and DACCS to occur.

The UK is leading innovation 
and global collaboration 
to accelerate CCUS
International collaboration is vital to accelerate CCUS globally.
From the IPCC to the IEA there is 
international consensus that CCUS 
is vital to meeting the ambitions of 
the Paris Agreement77. In the IEA’s 
‘below two degrees’ scenario, CCUS 
accounts for over one fifth of the 
total emissions reductions78. 
The recent IPCC Special Report on the 
impacts of global warming of 1.5°C 
above pre-industrial levels shows the 
significant importance of CCUS in 
industrial decarbonisation, electricity 
generation and carbon dioxide removal. 
The majority of the IPCC’s pathways 
include CCUS as a critical enabling 
tool for greenhouse gas removal 
(achievable through bioenergy with 
CCUS and direct air capture with CCUS, 
for instance) which can offset residual 
emissions from “harder to reach” 
sectors such as agriculture and aviation. 
Global cumulative capture through 
CCUS may need to reach between 
348 to 1218 billion tonnes of carbon 
dioxide by the end of the century. If this 
CCUS infrastructure does not become 
available at scale, much more rapid 
global cuts in emissions are required 
by 2030. The Government has asked 
the CCC to advise on the implications of 
the Paris Agreement for UK ambition. 
This advice is expected in March 2019.
Globally, CCUS is being deployed now: 
there are now eighteen79 operational 
large scale80 facilities ranging from 
applications in chemicals, iron and steel, 
gas processing and power generation. 
There are also hundreds of smaller 
scale CCUS projects and research 
centres operating around the world81. 
CCUS is proven, but it is estimated that 
global deployment of CCUS needs to 
increase significantly from the eighteen 
operational today to thousands of 
large-scale facilities by 206082.
Accelerating CCUS globally is complex 
but increasingly important and urgent. 
The challenge is to find cost effective, 
investable and sustainable pathways 
to enable commercial deployment of 
CCUS technologies. This challenge 
is compounded by an investment 
gap from both the public and private 
sectors. Of the $850 billion invested 
in low carbon energy worldwide 
in 2016, only 0.1% was invested in 
CCUS83. Putting in place a sustainable 
commercial pathway for CCUS can 
help unlock this investment and is an 
opportunity for those leading on CCUS.
 47
`
`  CCUS is being deployed around the world, but needs to accelerate 
significantly in order to meet global emissions reductions targets. 
`
`  We will continue to play a leading role in international multilateral 
organisations, working with other governments and industry to 
accelerate global deployment and achieve global cost reductions. 
`
`  We will continue to invest in supporting the development of 
CCUS technologies, positioning the UK as a global leader. 
Key messages
Collaboration at scale, investable 
commercial models and working with 
other governments and industry will 
be vital to drive cost reductions and 
shift perceptions on CCUS. That is 
why our global Accelerating CCUS 
Summit on 28 November 2018, co-
hosted by the IEA, brought together 
Governments and industry to discuss 
concrete actions to accelerate CCUS 
globally. We will work with the IEA 
and others such as the Global CCS 
Institute to advance the conclusions 
from the Accelerating CCUS Summit.
We will work with Norway, Canada, 
Australia, USA, Japan, Saudi 
Arabia, Mexico and the UAE to 
build greater international CCUS 
collaborative links both bilaterally 
and multilaterally. We will:
`
`  Develop new or build on 
existing agreements with other 
leader countries on CCUS.
`
`  Work with other Governments, 
in particular Norway, to 
identify and address barriers 
to cross-border transport of 
carbon dioxide, highlighting 
the importance of ratifying the 
London Protocol to allow this.
`
`  Through our co-leadership of the 
Mission Innovation CCUS Challenge, 
with Mexico and Saudi Arabia, 
deliver an action plan to build on 
the extensive Priority Research 
Directions report84 that emanated 
from the September 2017 Carbon

Workshop held in Houston.
`
`  Work to progress CCUS globally, 
in particular through increased 
engagement with the investment 
community via the new CCUS initiative 
under the Clean Energy Ministerial 
which we are co-leading with the 
USA, Norway, and Saudi Arabia.

Actions
We are continuing to invest in CCUS to 
support deployment and cost reduction and 
ensuring we have a world-class research and 
innovation base for CCUS in the UK
According to the IEA85, CCUS technology will experience 
significant technological advancement, cost reduction and broader 
application as the CCS industry grows. 
This means that there will be 
opportunities which we can exploit as 
new technologies are developed which 
could further reduce the cost of CCUS. 
We are in a good position to do so. 
For example, UK companies such as 
Carbon Clean Solutions and C-Capture, 
and the UK invented Allam Cycle are 
demonstrating that next generation 
capture technologies offer important 
cost reduction potential. For this reason, 
we are investing £100 million to March 
2021 to support industry and CCUS 
innovation and deployment in the UK86.
In 2018, we announced three 
innovation programmes as part of 
our £100 million industrial energy 
and CCUS innovation programme. 
 49
We have designed these programmes 
so that they support a reduction in 
the cost of capturing and storing 
carbon dioxide and/or lead to a quicker, 
more widespread deployment of 
CCUS in the UK and internationally.
The UK has a well-established and 
strong CCUS research and development 
base and both the UK CCS Research 
Centre and Scottish CCS are world-
leading CCUS research groups. We 
are, alongside the United States, 
Canada, and China, a leader in this 
field. The UK is the clear leader on 
scientific CCUS publications in Europe 
and, globally, ranks highly alongside 
the countries generating the most 
scientific publications and citations 
in the field, behind only the United 
States and China in numbers87. 
Delivering world leading research 
through our academic institutions 
will need to continue to support our 
aim of becoming a global technology 
leader in CCUS. In particular, we will 
maintain a specific focus on areas 
which can support cost reductions, 
support deployment and support UK 
leadership. We also recognise the 
importance of continuing to build the 
evidence base around CCUS during the 
2020s, to inform any decision taken on 
whether (and how) to deploy at scale. 
Working with UKRI, we will provide 
further detail on the next steps for 
CCUS innovation in due course, as 
current innovation programmes begin 
to deliver results. We expect that as 
initial CCUS projects are progressed 
during the 2020s, that academia and 
industry will continue to collaborate 
to deliver further R&D projects.
`
`  We will deliver CCUS innovation 
programmes worth £45 
million by March 2021. 
`

Summary – meeting our vision
Delivering our vision to become a global technology leader, 
unlocking the potential of CCUS and securing the added value 
which CCUS can bring to our industrial centres and businesses  
all across the UK will require significant collaboration with 
industry, academia and industrial centres. 
It requires putting in place structures 
and frameworks that work in the 
context of an economy and energy 
system that is rapidly changing and 
evolving, to deliver our 2030s ambition 
to move beyond supporting CCUS 
through innovation to establishing 
CCUS infrastructure in the UK. Should 
the costs come down sufficiently 
this may enable the deployment 
of CCUS at scale in the 2030s.  
The immediate priorities are to 
address the challenges to progressing 
CCUS in the UK and globally. Our 
actions, which are aligned with the 
Industrial Strategy, will focus on:
`
`  Ensuring the business environment 
works for all involved in CCUS 
through identifying the appropriate 
commercial frameworks to enable 
investment, innovation and cost 
reduction. In the Clean Growth 
Strategy, we committed to review the 
investment and delivery frameworks 
for CCUS to support commercial 
deployment. This will enable us 
to understand the commercial 
frameworks required to enable 
investable CCUS projects and provide 
value for money.  
An important element of this will 
be to have an appropriate risk 
allocation between Government and 
industry, in particular addressing the 
‘irreducible core’ of risks identified by 
the CCUS Cost Challenge Taskforce. 
`
`  Ensuring we have the people and 
the delivery capability to deliver 
the CCUS infrastructure challenge, 
enabling deployment at scale in the 
2030s, creating high value jobs 
for people across the UK. We want 
to ensure that the UK has the right 
delivery capability to support the 
deployment of CCUS at scale during 
the 2030s, if the decision should 
be taken to do so. This includes the 
capability within central Government, 
but also within local and regional 
authorities across the UK, our 
industrial centres, the private sector, 
and investment community. We will 
assess the Government delivery 
capability needed to deliver this 
ambition, and will work with industry 
to ensure that the private sector also 
has the relevant delivery capability.
 51
`
`  How best to deploy CCUS 
infrastructure, subject to cost 
reduction, in places and regions 
across the UK. As we look to 
develop the commercial and policy 
foundations, we will continue to work 
with industrial regions to explore the 
potential of deploying CCUS in their 
area. Our Action Plan is designed to 
enable the development of the first 
CCUS facility in the UK, commissioning 
from the mid-2020s. We will, in 2019, 
commence detailed engagement with 
industry on the critical challenges 
to delivering CCUS in the UK, in 
particular the cost structures, risk 
sharing arrangements and the 
necessary market-based frameworks. 
`
`  Having a strategic approach to 
ideas, innovation and development, 
enabling cost reductions. Through 
our innovation programmes we will 
continue to support advancement 
of CCUS technology. This includes 
supporting the expansion of CCU 
at industrial sites; co-funding 
early project development work 
and innovative concepts and 
technologies; and supporting UK 
research projects through the second 
call of the Accelerating Carbon 
Technologies research programme88. 
`
`  Leading international collaboration 
to accelerate global deployment 
of CCUS. We will continue to 
lead efforts, working with other 
Governments and industry, to 
accelerate global deployment of 
CCUS, which will help to drive down 
costs and expand the emerging 
market for CCUS technology. We 
will do this through multi-lateral 
initiatives, bilaterally, through our 
Official Development Assistance 
(ODA) programme for CCUS and with 
the IEA to progress the outcomes 
from the global Accelerating CCUS 
Summit held in November 2018. 
`
`  We will build the capability to deliver CCUS projects within 
the public sector, and will work with industry to ensure the 
appropriate delivery capability exists in the private sector. 
`
`  We will continue to engage with the CCUS industry through the CCUS 
Council, who will provide ongoing advice on building delivery capability 
and review progress against the actions set out in this Action Plan.

Building public and private sector delivery capability
Meeting our ambition, vision, and commitment will require the 
right delivery capability, both in the public and private sectors. 
In 2019, we will complete a review 
of CCUS and other infrastructure 
delivery organisations to understand 
the skills and capability required within 
Government to ensure successful 
delivery of CCUS projects during 
the 2020s, and to assess how best 
to deliver these within Government. 
We will work with bodies such as the 
Infrastructure and Projects Authority, 
the OGA and central government 
departments such as the Department 
for Environment, Food and Rural 
Affairs and Department for Transport. 
We will also consider advice from the 
National Audit Office89 and Public 
Accounts Committee90 to ensure 
that we have learned lessons from 
delivery of other infrastructure 
projects and have put in place 
appropriate governance structures. 
Following the outcome of the review 
of CCUS delivery and investment 
frameworks, Government will work 
with industry during the early 2020s 
to examine the delivery implications 
of deploying CCUS at scale in the UK 
during the 2030s. For example, it may 
be necessary to understand the carbon 
dioxide storage facilities that may be 
required and a timetable for appraising 
them, in addition to the type of capture 
projects that might be needed. 
Industry will also need to ensure that 
the appropriate capability exists, 
within industrial centres, local and 
regional institutions, and the finance 
community to deploy CCUS in the 
UK. Government will work with all 
industrial areas who want to develop 
CCUS to benefit their own area and 
businesses, in order to ensure that 
places can build this capability. 
`
`  We will undertake and complete a 
review of infrastructure delivery 
organisations to understand the 
skills and capability required 
for successful delivery of 
CCUS projects during the 
2020s, and publish a report 
on this in Autumn 2019.

Advising Government on progress
Government will continue to engage with industry through  
the CCUS Council. 
The Council, co-chaired by the Minister 
for Energy and Clean Growth and 
James Smith (formerly chair of the 
Carbon Trust and Shell UK), will advise 
Government on progress against 
the priorities as set out in the Clean 
Growth Strategy and in this Action 
Plan. The Council will also continue 
to monitor industry capability, CCUS 
costs, and deployment potential. 
The CCUS Council will provide a 
crucial link between industry and 
Government in providing advice on 
industry capability and other CCUS 
developments during the 2020s. 
Having this capability in place will 
ensure that developers are able to 
bring together viable commercial 
propositions. Ensuring that the 
industry can scale up could be a key 
consideration before any decision 
to deploy CCUS at scale during 
the 2030s is made, and could be 
a key part of the contribution to 
the UK’s Industrial Strategy. 
Industry should, through working 
with Government, ensure that 
there is the relevant delivery 
capability in the private sector, 
and in local and regional 
institutions, to deliver initial CCUS 
projects which can meet the 
Government’s stated ambition.

Response to the CCUS 
Cost Challenge Taskforce 
recommendations
The CCUS Cost Challenge Taskforce was 
established by the Minister for Energy 
and Clean Growth in January 2018. It 
was chaired by Charlotte Morgan of 
Linklaters LLP, and delivered a report 
to Government in July 2018 setting out 
the CCUS industry’s view on how to 
reduce the costs of deploying CCUS in 
the UK.  
The report, “Delivering Clean Growth”, 
was received by Government, and its 
recommendations and conclusions 
have been closely considered. We 
will continue to work with industry to 
understand further the opportunities 
and challenges set out in the report. 
Government response: We have published the CCUS Action Plan, of which 
this response forms a part, which is designed to enable the deployment of 
the first CCUS facility, commissioning from the mid-2020s. In 2019, we will 
commence detailed engagement with industry on the critical challenges 
to delivering CCUS in the UK, in particular the cost structures, risk sharing 
arrangements and creating the necessary market-based frameworks.
Recommendation 1: Government to publish the CCUS Deployment Pathway 
by the end of 2018, including a commitment to have at least two carbon 
capture, usage and storage clusters operational from the mid-2020s.
Government response: We are grateful to the industry for their joint 
work with Government since publication of the CCUS Cost Challenge 
Taskforce report. We have considered the roadmap which was delivered 
to Government, and this Action Plan sets out the actions which we believe 
are necessary to achieve our ambition of having the option to deploy CCUS 
at scale during the 2030s, subject to costs coming down sufficiently. 
Recommendation 2: Industry and Government to work together to 
develop a CCUS roadmap for the UK as part of the Deployment Pathway 
publication by the end of 2018. 
 61
Government response: In 2019 we will commence detailed engagement 
with industry on the critical challenges to delivering CCUS in the 
UK, in particular the cost structures, risk sharing arrangements and 
the necessary market-based frameworks. We will also examine in 
detail the scope of the opportunity for maximising economies of 
scale by developing a shared carbon dioxide infrastructure network 
in an industrial centre, and will report by the end of 2019.
Recommendation 3: Government to publish a policy framework and criteria 
to enable and prioritise CCUS clusters in the first half of 2019. 
Government response: Our review of CCUS delivery and investment 
frameworks is underway and we are considering a wide range of 
business models, including the Taskforce’s recommendations for business 
models in infrastructure, power, and industry, and on the risk allocation 
between industry and Government. We will consult on our findings in 
2019 and publish the outcome of the review by the end of 2019. 
Recommendation 4: Government to respond to the Taskforce’s 
recommended business models for CCUS through its Review of Delivery 
and Investment Frameworks for CCUS.
Government response: We will undertake and complete a review 
of infrastructure delivery organisations to understand the skills and 
capability required for successful delivery of CCUS projects during 
the 2020s, and will report on this during the first half of 2019. 
Following the outcome of the review of CCUS delivery and investment 
frameworks, we will also work with industry to examine the delivery 
implications of deploying CCUS at scale in the UK during the 2030s. 
Recommendation 5: Industry, Government and local partners to work 
together to support the development of innovative business plans for the 
development of CCUS clusters.
Industrial Strategy Carbon Capture Usage and Storage
62
Government response: We recognise the opportunity of re-using 
existing oil and gas infrastructure for CCUS, which could reduce costs 
for initial projects. We will complete a process, with the OGA, industry 
and The Crown Estate and The Crown Estate Scotland, in the first half 
of 2019, which identifies existing oil and gas infrastructure that has the 
potential for re-use to support the development of CCUS in the UK. 
In addition, we will, in consultation with the relevant regulators, industry, 
The Crown Estate, and The Crown Estate Scotland, develop a policy 
on re-use of infrastructure for CCUS in the first half of 2019.
Recommendation 6: Industry and Government to identify North Sea and 
East Irish Sea oil and gas infrastructure at risk of being decommissioned 
in the next 5-10 years which could be maintained as “strategic assets” for 
CCUS use in the future. A cross Governmental working group, including the 
OGA and the devolved administrations, to review these assets and include 
them in the CCUS Deployment Pathway to be published by the end of 2018.
Government response: BEIS and gas distribution network operators 
will engage with Ofgem through the RIIO2 decarbonisation 
stakeholder groups and the ongoing RIIO2 development 
process, to consider whether there is a need for regulatory 
mechanisms to support network related hydrogen projects. 
Recommendation 7: Industry, Government and the regulator to develop the 
mechanisms by which hydrogen projects could be funded through the RIIO-
2 mechanisms before gas distribution networks business plans are due for 
submission (September 2019).
 63
Government response: We will consider supporting applications 
for exemption from, and proposals for amendment to, GS(M)
R to enable the blending of hydrogen within gas networks. Before 
an exemption or amendment, it must be demonstrated that any 
changes to the current safety parameters will not lead to a diminution 
in safety, with the necessary consultation taking place. 
We will consider, in association with the Health and Safety Executive 
(HSE) and other interested parties, and subject to the satisfactory 
demonstration of safety, the inclusion of a percentage of low-
carbon hydrogen in gas networks, within the context of strategic 
decisions for the long-term decarbonisation of heat for buildings and 
industry, and the potential for an emerging hydrogen economy. 
Recommendation 8: Government to support the timely achievement of 
an exemption to the Gas Safety (Management) Regulations (GS(M)R) 
specification to enable a higher blend of hydrogen to be included in the gas 
distribution and transmission networks, and to consider developing a policy 
that requires including a steadily rising percentage of hydrogen produced by 
low carbon methods) in gas supplied to customers. 
Government response: We recognise the importance of continuing to build 
the evidence base around CCUS during the 2020s, to inform any decision 
taken on whether (and how) to deploy at scale. Through our own work and 
working with industry and academia, we are continuing to gather evidence on 
the economic, environmental and social value which CCUS can provide across 
the economy. We will continue to work with industry and academic institutions 
to expand our evidence base across all aspects of the CCUS sector, and 
will, where possible, make this research available in the public domain. 
Recommendation 9: Working with industry, Government to more fully 
assess value of CCUS to the wider UK economy (including in terms 
of utilising existing infrastructure, skills capacity, and supporting 
opportunities for future clean growth and development). 
Industrial Strategy Carbon Capture Usage and Storage
64
Government response: We will work closely with the CCUS Council, 
which will continue to provide ongoing advice to Government on 
building industry capability during the 2020s, and to monitor and 
review progress against the priorities set out in this Action Plan. The 
Council will also advise on ways to maintain UK’s leadership in CCUS.  
Recommendation 10: Industry and Government to work with the CCUS 
Council to monitor and recommend ways to maintain UK’s leadership in 
CCUS nationally and internationally.
Government response: The review of CCUS delivery and investment 
frameworks is underway and we are considering a wide range of 
business models. We will consult on our findings in 2019, and publish 
the final outcome of the review by the end of 2019. As part of this 
process, we will work with the finance community, including members 
of the Green Finance Taskforce, in order to ensure that the outcome 
of the review takes account of their views. This will include tackling 
the issue of risk allocation between industry and Government.  
Recommendation 11: Industry and Government to develop and consult with 
the finance community on an agreed risk allocation for CCUS projects 
through the Review of CCUS Delivery and Investment Frameworks.
Government response: We will engage with the finance community 
and members of the Green Finance Taskforce as part of the review of 
CCUS delivery and investment frameworks, in order to ensure that the 
outcome of the review takes account of their views. We are also working 
with Energy UK and CCSA to examine how to design an investable 
proposition for power CCUS. We will consult on our findings in 2019, 
and publish the final outcome of the review by the end of 2019
Recommendation 12: Industry and Government to engage with the finance 
community and the Green Finance Taskforce to establish the agreed 
parameters for debt and equity (and any new green financing mechanisms) 
for CCUS projects (including accreditation requirements for a green bond, 
and a tax credit option).
 65
Government response: We are supportive of industry and academia 
sharing innovation and knowledge of CCUS technologies, including 
through domestic institutions such as the UKCCSRC, and international 
partnerships like the UK-China (Guangdong) CCS Research Centre. 
In particular, we would encourage project developers to publish work 
where possible, as shown with the publication of the Carbon Clean 
Solutions Ltd pre-FEED work for the Klemetsrudanlegget waste-to-
energy carbon capture project in Norway, to increase global knowledge 
sharing on CCUS, supporting global deployment and cost reductions. 
Recommendation 13: Industry to foster sharing of innovation in CCUS 
technologies and processes in line with the foundations set out in the 
Industrial Strategy. 
Government response: We will continue to lead collaboration on CCUS, 
with other Governments and industry, building on the global Accelerating 
CCUS Summit held in November 2018. We will work with other Governments, 
particularly Norway, to identify and address barriers to the cross-border 
transport of carbon dioxide. We will work with our co-leads of the Mission 
Innovation CCUS Challenge, Mexico and Saudi Arabia, to deliver an action 
plan which builds on the workshop held in September 2017 in Houston. We 
will also continue to co-lead the Clean Energy Ministerial CCUS initiative, and 
other multilateral organisations including the Carbon Sequestration Leadership 
Forum and the North Sea Basin Task Force. We will continue to support 
developing countries and emerging economies to develop both the technical 
and institutional knowledge necessary to enable the deployment of CCUS 
technologies through our £70 million international CCUS programme, which 
uses Official Development Assistance (ODA).
Recommendation 14: Industry and Government to promote international 
cooperation, including accelerating the option of shipping CO2 across international 
borders to enable the development of pan-European CO2 storage services. 
Industrial Strategy Carbon Capture Usage and Storage
66
Government response: We agree that regulatory coherence will be 
important, given the potential applications of CCUS across multiple 
sectors. We will, in developing any CCUS regulations, work where 
appropriate with sector regulators to ensure regulatory coherence.
Recommendation 15: Working with sector regulators, industry and 
Government to assess opportunities for regulatory coherence and innovation 
across the heating, transport, gas and electricity sectors in the development 
of a decarbonised economy.
Government response: We will engage with industry if they wish to 
pursue the development of a decarbonised product mark and will 
consider ongoing policy in light of this development process. 
Recommendation 16: Industry to lead the creation of the decarbonised 
product mark, a clean industrial products certification system, to certify 
the low carbon USP of decarbonised industrial products and Government to 
encourage their domestic use and global export.

4  ETI analysis shows the cost of 
decarbonisation with deployment of 
CCUS at scale estimated to be 1% of 
GDP by 2050. In scenarios without 
CCUS, this rises to 2% of GDP. The 
ETI report also states that “without 
certain key technologies [such as 
CCUS], meeting carbon targets 
would be much harder, jeopardising 
industry and severely limiting 
lifestyle choices.” CCC analysis (2012) 
shows that decarbonisation of the 
energy sector could increase from 
0.5% of GDP (Central scenario) 
to 0.9% of GDP without CCUS.
