Executive Summary
The carbon removal field has undergone incredible transformation in the last five 
years. What began as a highly niche and neglected set of climate solutions has 
since become a core component of climate action, with growing recognition from 
an ever-broader coalition of one simple fact: We simply cannot meet our global 
climate goals without carbon removal. To solve the climate crisis, we must push 
past zero and get to negative. Building upon recent progress, Congress has a 
singular opportunity to catalyze the next wave of transformation for carbon 
removal.
Despite its promise and urgency, carbon removal solutions lag significantly behind 
other vital approaches such as electric vehicles and renewable energy. The rapid 
pace of change over the last few years has opened a rare window to double down 
on our momentum and, with targeted and ambitious investments from the federal 
government today, far outpace that growth in the coming decades. To do this, we 
must come together around transformational policies that can address current 
barriers to full-scale carbon removal.
Current barriers to full-scale carbon removal
1.   High costs for 
nascent carbon 
removal 
technologies, 
compounded by 
insufficient 
research, 
development, and 
demonstration 
(RD&D) funding
2.   Low demand  
for removal, 
associated 
products, and 
co-benefits, 
keeping private 
sector capital 
sidelined
3.   Inadequate 
regulations 
ensuring the safe, 
sustainable, and 
equitable 
deployment of 
carbon removal 
projects 
4.   Insufficient 
infrastructure  
to transport  
and store CO2 
and deploy 
nature-based 
restoration 
solutions
5.   Unclear 
guidelines on 
carbon 
monitoring, 
reporting, and 
verification for 
land-based 
approaches

LAND-BASED APPROACHES
Land-based carbon removal 
approaches, many of which are 
relatively inexpensive and already 
being deployed, can provide myriad 
environmental and economic 
co-benefits. With an integrated 
approach to assessing and 
deploying these solutions, Congress 
can build a durable carbon removal 
economy that advances 
environmental justice (EJ), optimizes 
carbon removal deployment, and 
supports safe and dignified job 
creation. 
1.  Increase and expand RD&D at 
the Department of Agriculture 
(USDA) to scale soil carbon 
storage across US agricultural 
systems 
2.  Adjust the federal crop insurance 
program to encourage the 
adoption of conservation 
practices
3.  Expand financial and technical 
assistance to drive adoption of 
soil carbon practices 
4.  Pilot a federal land link program 
at USDA to promote soil carbon 
storage and support socially 
disadvantaged producers 
5.  Expand public forests by 
improving US Forest Service 
(USFS) programs
6.  Establish dedicated funding at 
the Department of the Interior 
(DOI) and USDA to protect and 
restore existing public forests 
7.  Establish dedicated funding 
streams to conserve and restore 
private forest lands 
8.  Establish a Civilian Climate Corps 
to address climate change and 
provide employment 
opportunities for US communities
9.  Expand the Agricultural 
Conservation Easement 
Program-Wetlands Reserve 
Easements (ACEP-WRE) and 
Conservation Reserve Program 
(CRP) to bolster wetland 
conservation 
10.  Expand the Forest Inventory and 
Analysis (FIA) program to improve 
centralized forest carbon data 
activities 
11.  Invest in innovation grants and 
life cycle assessments (LCAs) to 
advance durable emerging wood 
technologies
12.  Invest in social science research 
to identify and reduce barriers to 
participating in USDA assistance 
programs 
13.  Expand research and 
governance for marine-based 
carbon removal through federal 
program creation and 
international cooperation
This report outlines the key actions Congress should take over the next one to  
three years to rapidly develop and deploy carbon removal. The recommendations  
in this report focus on how we can realize carbon removal’s full potential as a  
critical climate solution and also deliver on its environmental, economic, and  
social co-benefits. With the tools at its disposal — RD&D, deployment incentives, 
infrastructure, and regulations — the federal government is poised to reinvent the US 
economy, drive forward a new industry, and put our climate and communities first.

TECH-BASED APPROACHES
Technologies that pull carbon out 
of the atmosphere have the 
potential to remove gigatons of 
CO2, create hundreds of thousands 
of jobs, and contribute significantly 
to economic growth. Through the 
passage of forward-thinking and 
comprehensive legislation, 
Congress has the capacity to 
propel these solutions to realize 
climate goals and lead the creation 
of a vibrant market.
1.  Utilize federal procurement to 
drive the deployment of direct 
air capture (DAC), bioenergy 
with carbon capture and 
storage (BECCS), and 
carbontech 
2.  Develop comprehensive 
demonstration and deployment 
strategies within the 
Department of Energy (DOE) to 
complement research and 
development (R&D) efforts 
3.  Establish a federal DAC siting 
research initiative to support 
equitable and safe deployment
4.  Create a DAC market, policy, 
and people innovation prize
5.  Enhance and expand the 45Q 
tax credit for DAC
6.  Create an investment tax credit 
for DAC
7.  Invest in DAC-to-fuel pathways
8.  Pre-permit geologic storage on 
federal land 
9.  Update the Class VI 
underground injection well 
permitting process to enable 
more rapid development of 
geologic carbon storage 
10.  Create a pipeline development 
task force to site pipelines 
connecting CO2 sources to 
storage facilities 
11.  Create an RD&D program for 
enhanced CO2 mineralization
CROSS-SOLUTION APPROACHES
Carbon removal solutions have 
traditionally been developed and 
deployed in silos, but with a host of 
opportunities and challenges 
across the industry, it is crucial to 
develop policy that utilizes 
expertise across federal agencies.
1.  Expand and pass the CREATE 
Act to ensure a comprehensive, 
cross-agency carbon removal 
strategy
2.  Codify the Interagency Working 
Group on Environmental Justice 
(EJ IWG) and strengthen 
requirements for the integration 
of EJ across federal agencies
3.  Create an interdisciplinary 
roadmap for BECCS deployment 
options
4.  Include biomass-based carbon 
removal products in the Value-
Added Producer Grant program
