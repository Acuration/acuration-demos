Moving mountains:  
energy storage for a secure, 
sustainable future
Introduction to Cruachan
Renewables are essential to supporting  
energy security and further decarbonising  
the grid at a lower cost.
UK Government has been working to 
increase renewable capacity for the 
country’s grid, including plans to power 
every UK home by offshore wind by 2030, 
and to fully decarbonise the UK’s power 
grid by 2035. This is a bold and necessary 
step, but we must be cognisant of the 
nature of the power that wind and solar 
bring to the grid.
Intermittent power sources – such as 
wind or solar – only generate electricity 
when conditions are optimal. A grid overly 
reliant on these sources can fall victim to 
unfavourable weather conditions, leading 
to too little or too much power generation 
– risking blackouts, or requiring electricity 
generators to be paid to to stop producing 
power, which is costly.
Through providing vital storage to reduce 
renewable power going to waste, pumped 
storage hydro is an essential component 
to ensure our grid is not only greener, but 
stable, affordable and flexible.
“ Last year, the UK’s lack of energy 
storage capacity meant wind farms 
had to be paid to turn off and we lost 
out on enough renewable power to 
supply a million homes. We need to stop 
renewable power from going to waste 
by storing it, and Drax is ready to move 
mountains to do just that.”

How does pumped storage 
hydro work?
Pumped storage hydro is based on two water reservoirs 
at different elevations on a steep slope. 
When there is excess power on the grid 
or demand for electricity is low, power is 
absorbed from the grid and used to pump 
water from the lower to the upper reservoir 
through reversible turbines. 
When demand is high, the water is released 
downhill into the lower reservoir, driving 
the turbines in the other direction to 
generate electricity.
Pumped storage hydro facilities act as 
vast ‘water batteries’. They are a flexible, 
efficient  and cost-effective way of storing 
excess energy generated by renewables 
at scale. Pumped storage hydro has been 
used for more than 50 years in the UK and 
accounts for more than 99% of the global 
bulk energy storage solutions. 
Affectionately known as ‘The Hollow 
Mountain’, Cruachan is one of only four 
pumped storage hydro stations in the UK. 
The station has a capacity of 440 MW – 
enough to power more than 880,000 
homes – and can store up to 10 million m3 
of water at any given time. Sitting on the 
northern shores of Loch Awe in Argyll  
and Bute, Scotland, one of the wettest 
areas in Europe, Cruachan is ideally  
located to support the UK’s energy needs 
when required. 
Drax wants to go even further and unlock 
the UK’s full dispatchable and renewable 
potential by expanding Cruachan pumped 
storage hydro plant, which would more 
than double the site’s generating capacity 
to over 1 gigawatt (GW) of power.  
This would not only support the UK’s 
renewable targets by enabling more wind 
and solar to connect onto the grid, but it 
would also deliver cumulative savings of 
more than £350 million to consumers as  
the grid continues to decarbonise.
The UK has led the world in the transition 
from fossil fuels to renewable power, 
and Scotland has been at the forefront 
of this renewables’ revolution. However, 
to support energy security and further 
decarbonisation of the grid at a lower cost, 
the country will need more energy storage 
provided by pumped storage hydro – and 
Drax is ready to help deliver it.

Why Cruachan is important  
for the UK
Intermittent power sources like wind are key for 
countries to meet their climate goals, but pose stability 
challenges for power grid operators. 
The challenges we face
As the UK moves toward net zero emissions, 
low carbon and renewable power sources 
will become the norm. However, it’s not as 
simple as swapping in renewables for the 
fossil fuels the grid was built around.
Many renewables are intermittent. For 
example, wind can produce 25% of the UK’s 
energy, as it did across 2020, but on single 
days when the wind doesn’t blow, this figure 
can be less than 10%. 
A further challenge is transporting renewable 
energy to the consumer. As the UK’s 
electricity system continues to change, so 
do its requirements for transporting energy. 
The switch from a few very large power 
stations to a greater variety of electricity 
sources, including wind and solar, means 
that there is a need for services to balance 
the subsequent variety in frequencies and 
voltage to the grid to keep it stable.  
£806m
This is the estimated total cost to 
consumers of wind curtailment in 
2020 and 2021. Pumped storage 
hydro can help address this.
The knock-on effect
When network constraints mean that 
intermittent energy sources cannot be 
safely transported across the grid at the 
right frequency and voltage, intermittent 
energy generators need to be paid to  
turn off their services, meaning that excess 
renewable energy generated in one area, 
such as Scotland, cannot be transported to 
high demand areas, such as those  
in England.
This is a highly inefficient way to run a 
power grid; in 2020 and 2021, there was 
a total wind power curtailment – the total 
wind power wasted because it couldn’t be 
transported to the right areas – of 5.8TWh –  
enough wind power to supply around 
800,000 homes. This problem is particularly 
prevalent in certain areas, for example 
in Scotland, where 88% of this wind 
curtailment took place.
On days where intermittent service 
providers turn off their services, carbon-
intensive gas generation typically needs 
to be turned up to compensate, resulting 
in higher carbon emissions which 
compromises long-term efforts to deliver 
UK Net Zero by 2050. 
A secure solution
Pumped storage hydro is an essential 
component to ensure our grid is not  
only greener, but stable, more affordable 
and flexible.
When called upon, Cruachan can reach its 
maximum output in 30 seconds to provide 
flexible power to stabilise the grid. And it 
works - the facility has been supporting 
 the UK’s energy security for over 50 years.

Why we need Cruachan 2 
The secret to enabling a net zero electricity system, 
powering an additional one million homes, and creating 
hundreds of jobs.
A vital supporting role
As the electricity system transforms 
through a range of low-carbon and 
renewable technologies, the amount of 
energy storage on the UK grid will need 
to expand from 3GW today to over 30GW 
in the coming decades. National Grid, 
who manage the UK’s electricity network 
estimate that by 2030 at least 13GW of new 
electricity storage capacity will be required 
on the system to meet the challenge of 
intermittency from wind and solar. New 
pumped storage hydro is expected to play 
a significant role in providing this additional 
storage capacity. 
Pumped storage hydro power stations 
require very specific sites, with substantial 
bodies of water between different 
elevations, to deploy. There are hundreds, 
if not thousands, of potential sites around 
the UK, including disused mines, quarries 
and underground caverns, but the cost of 
developing entirely new facilities is large.  
A more cost-effective way to increase 
storage capacity is by expanding existing 
plants, such as Cruachan.
Creating jobs for the community
Our planned expansion of Cruachan would  
more than double the site’s generating 
capacity to over 1GW of flexible 
dispatchable power. 
The construction and operation of 
Cruachan 2 would directly create 300 jobs 
over the five-to-six-year construction period 
and support a total of nearly 900 jobs across 
the wider supply chain in Scotland– not to 
mention provide a range of ancillary grid 
services such as inertia that help keep the 
network stable.
“ The Cruachan extension is a really 
exciting project and one that’s really 
important for Scotland. It brings together 
a number of our really important 
skills – civil engineering and electrical 
engineering skill sets too. What we really 
want to see is a renewables industry 
that’s thriving but also driving economic 
gain in Scotland. Pumped storage hydro 
has been part of Scotland’s energy story 
for over 100 years, particularly Cruachan, 
which is incredibly unique and special 
within the landscape.”

Delivering Cruachan 2
Drax is aiming to be a leader in UK dispatchable 
renewable energy generation and Cruachan 2  
is at the heart of that objective. 
Expanding our capabilities
The development – which could be the first 
newly constructed plant of its kind in the UK 
in more than 40 years – seeks to optimise 
the use of the existing Cruachan Reservoir 
and Dam through development of a new 
underground power station and associated 
infrastructure. 
The development would provide an 
expansion of the power generation capacity 
with a second pumped storage hydro-
electric generation station which would 
operate independently of the existing 
Cruachan station.
We’re aiming to have Cruachan 2 
operational by 2030, but that will rely on 
the right policies and commitments from 
Government to instil investor confidence  
in this large infrastructure project.
Supporting this ambitious project
In order to deploy this critical technology, 
Drax must secure planning consent under 
Section 36 of the Electricity Act 1989 from 
Scottish Ministers – a process which will 
take around one year to complete from the 
application’s submission.
Alongside a successful Section 36 
application, the project will also require an 
updated policy framework to support large-
scale long-duration storage and flexibility 
technologies from the UK Government. 
The current lack of a framework for these 
technologies means that private investment 
cannot currently be secured in new pumped 
storage hydro and other projects, with 
no new plants built anywhere in the UK 
since 1984 despite their critical role in 
decarbonisation.
With Section 36 consent from the Scottish 
Government, and an updated revenue 
stabilisation mechanism from the UK 
Government, work to build the new 
pumped storage hydro power station could 
get underway in 2024, with the project 
becoming fully operational, supplying 
flexible power to the grid and bolstering  
the UK’s energy security, by 2030.
Drax is aiming to be a leader in UK 
dispatchable renewable energy  
generation and Cruachan 2 is at the 
heart of that objective. 
How does it work? 
Key components of the proposed development include:
   Control works at Cruachan Reservoir 
and Loch Awe to create intakes/outfalls
   A new underground waterway system 
to carry water between the upper and 
lower reservoir
   A series of underground power-house 
caverns containing reversible pump-
turbines and motor-generators
   Above ground substation to provide 
a connection between the existing 
275KV circuit that connects to Dalmally 
substation
   Ventilation shafts
   New quayside on Loch Awe adjacent  
to proposed lower control works
   Above ground administration and 
workshop buildings for day-to-day 
operations
   Access tunnels for health and safety 
and movement of power station 
personnel
   Upgrades to existing service roads to 
facilitate access by heavy machinery
2030
