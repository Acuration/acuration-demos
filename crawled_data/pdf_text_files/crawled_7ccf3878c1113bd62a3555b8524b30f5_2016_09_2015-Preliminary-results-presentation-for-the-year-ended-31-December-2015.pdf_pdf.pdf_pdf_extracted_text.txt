Biomass Infrastructure at Drax 
Biomass – the Reliable Renewable
Government Energy Objectives
22
Drax Group plc
Requirement
UK needs secure, affordable and clean electricity
Aim
Removal of coal from system by 2025
Issues
Reducing coal is desirable but difficult
•
Crucial to grid stability and security of supply
•
> 35% of dispatchable generation
New gas unlikely to be deployed in time
•
No new plant in next 3 years
•
Estimate 15-20(1) new gas plants required in 7 years
Implications
•
Scarcity pricing becoming more extreme
- £3,000/MWh, increasing to £6,000/MWh in 2018
•
Higher prices for consumers – including cost to prevent blackouts
Solution
Sustainable biomass
Fastest, most affordable and reliable way to move from coal to renewables
UK lags Europe significantly in use of wood for energy
1) Assumes plant capacity of c.1GW
Focus on Whole System Costs
Affordability is critical to Government
Whole system cost
•
Direct generation costs
•
Indirect costs / benefits
- Grid connection and losses
- Backup and system stability measures
- Balancing costs
- Fuel and carbon savings
Biomass has lowest whole system cost
NERA / Imperial College research 
•
£2bn consumer saving from one additional 
biomass unit vs. other low carbon technologies
DECC whole system cost research
•
Expect publication in 2016

DECC Whole System Cost Project
“DECC recognises the importance of considering 
the whole system impacts (both costs and 
benefits) of different electricity technologies when 
formulating future government policy, since it is a 
crucial element in delivering secure, clean and 
affordable energy to consumers”

API2/4/6
API2 is the main reference price (including cost, freight and insurance) for steam coal to be delivered to 
Amsterdam, Rotterdam and Antwerp. API4 is the reference price for steam coal to be delivered free on board 
(“FOB”) to Richards Bay, South Africa. API6 is the reference price for steam coal to be delivered FOB to 
Newcastle, Australia.
AVERAGE ACHIEVED PRICE
Power revenues divided by volume of net sales (includes imbalance charges).
BM
BALANCING MECHANISM
The mechanism through which the System Operator can call upon additional generation/consumption or reduce 
generation/consumption, through market participants’ bids and offers, in order to balance the system minute by 
minute.
CESP
COMMUNITY ENERGY SAVING PROGRAMME
CESP was created as part of the Government's Home Energy Saving Programme. It required gas and electricity 
suppliers and electricity generators to deliver energy saving measures to domestic consumers in specific low 
income areas of Great Britain. CESP came into force on 1 September 2009. The CESP obligation period ran 
from 1 October 2009 to 31 December 2012.
