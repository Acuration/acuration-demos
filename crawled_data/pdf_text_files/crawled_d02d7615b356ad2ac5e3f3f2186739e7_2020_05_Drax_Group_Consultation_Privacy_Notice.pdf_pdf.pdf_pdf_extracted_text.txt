Drax Consultation Privacy Notice  
Drax Consultation Privacy Notice  
Drax Group plc (“Drax”, “we”, “us” or “our”) is committed to protecting and respecting your privacy.  
 
This privacy notice sets out the basis on which any personal data (called personal information in this 
notice) we collect from you, or that you provide to us, in relation to a Consultation Paper (as defined 
below), will be processed by us.   
We produce wood pellets, generate electricity and supply low carbon energy solutions to industrial 
and business customers.  From time to time, we carry out consultations by circulating a consultation 
paper including some of our proposals and plans regarding our operations (each a “Consultation 
Paper”) and we  invite recipients to circulate responses to the proposals put forward in such 
Consultation Papers. An example of such a Consultation Paper is a consultation regarding a 
greenhouse gas calculator. 
In any consultation, the collection of personal information is limited to personal information of 
individuals representing the stakeholder or commercial enterprise/business entity taking part in the 
consultation.  It is generally limited to contact details and will enable us to manage our relationship 
with you, as explained further in this notice.  
We will be the data controller of your personal information which you provide to us or which is 
collected by us through responses to the Consultation Paper. This means that we are responsible for 
deciding how we hold and use personal information about you and that we are required to notify you 
of the information contained in this notice. It is important that you read this notice so that you are 
aware of how and why we are using such information and how we will treat it.  
The information which you provide to us may include information about other individuals who are 
associated with your organisation or business. If you provide us with information about such 
individuals, it is important that you provide them with a copy of this notice prior to providing us with 
the information and that you provide them with any updated notices we provide from time to time.   
Our Group Data Protection Officer is responsible for overseeing questions in relation to this notice 
and is contactable via data.protection@drax.com. You can also contact us using the details provided 
at the end of this notice in the “Contacting us” section.  
How we use your information  
This notice tells you what to expect when we collect your personal information. It applies to 
information we collect through your submission of a response to the Consultation Paper and any 
correspondence that we may enter into with you.  
When you send your response to the Consultation Paper to us, we will collect your name, contact 
details, your views on the proposals contained in the Consultation Paper and any other personal 
information that you provide to us.   We will also keep copies of any correspondence we have with 
you in relation to your response to the Consultation Paper. 
Drax Consultation Privacy Notice  
We will only use this personal information  in order to (1) collate and analyse responses to the 
proposals contained in the Consultation Paper and (2) to comply with any publication requirements 
that we may have in relation to the relevant consultation process. 
It is in our legitimate interests to process your personal information in this way, as it is necessary to 
consider third party views on the proposals contained in the Consultation Paper, and these interests 
are not overridden by any detriment to your rights or freedoms.  
  
Change of purpose  
We will only use your personal information for the purposes for which we collected it, unless we 
reasonably consider that we need to use it for another reason and that reason is compatible with the 
original purpose. If we need to use your personal information for an unrelated purpose, we will notify 
you and we will explain the legal basis which allows us to do so.  
Disclosure of your information  
We may publish your individual response to the Consultation Paper if you have provided express 
written consent to us when submitting your response, save that the response will be attributed to 
the stakeholder or commercial enterprise specified in your response and your personal details will 
not be published. We will also summarise all responses provided to the Consultation Paper (including 
those provided by you) and publish an anonymised summary on our website. 
In addition, we may share your personal information with the third parties set out below:  
• 
other companies in our Group of companies such as Drax Power Limited, who provide amongst 
other arrangements and services, stakeholder management and management reporting;  
• 
if we are under a duty to disclose or share your personal information in order to comply with any 
legal obligation, or in order to enforce or apply any contractual terms or our website Terms of 
Use;  
• 
in the event that we sell or buy any business or assets, in which case we may disclose your 
personal information to the prospective seller or buyer; or  
• 
if we or substantially all of our assets are acquired by a third party, in which case personal 
information held by us will be one of the transferred assets.  
We require all Group companies that we share your personal information with to respect the privacy 
and security of your personal information and to treat it in accordance with the law.  We do not allow 
our Group companies to use your personal information for their own purposes and only permit them 
to process your personal information for specified purposes and in accordance with our instructions.   
All of the personal information we collect about you is based in the United Kingdom.   
Storage of your personal information  
We will only keep your personal information for as long as necessary to fulfil the relevant purpose(s) 
we collected it for, as set out above in this notice, and for as long as we are required to keep it for 
legal purposes.   
To determine the appropriate retention period for personal information, we consider the amount, 
nature, and sensitivity of the personal information, the potential risk of harm from unauthorized use 
or disclosure of your personal information, the purposes for which we process your personal 
Drax Consultation Privacy Notice  
information and whether we can achieve those purposes through other means, and the applicable 
legal requirements.  
For example, we have to keep basic information about consultation zone stakeholders of our power 
generation development projects for a period of two years, while the application is being considered 
by the Planning Inspectorate and UK government.  This period can vary if the application process 
takes longer than expected.     
In some circumstances:  
• 
you can ask us to delete your personal information, see Your Rights below for further details; 
and  
• 
we may anonymise your personal information (so that it can no-longer be associated with 
you) for research, planning application or statistical purpose in which case, we may use this 
information indefinitely without further notice to you.  
We have put in place appropriate security measures to prevent your personal information from being 
accidentally lost, used or accessed in an unauthorised way, altered or disclosed.    
In addition, we limit access to your personal information to those employees, contractors and other 
third parties who have a business need to know.  They will only process your personal information on 
our instructions and they are subject to a duty of confidentiality.    
We have put in place procedures to deal with any suspected personal information breach and will 
notify you and any applicable regulator where we are legally required to do so.   
Your rights  
Data protection laws provide you with the following rights, to:  
   
• 
request access to your personal information (commonly known as a “data subject access 
request”). This enables you to receive a copy of the personal information we hold about you and 
to check that we are lawfully processing it;  
• 
request correction of the personal information that we hold about you. This enables you to have 
any incomplete or inaccurate information we hold about you corrected;  
• 
request erasure of your personal information in certain circumstances. This enables you to ask us 
to delete or remove personal information where there is no good reason for us continuing to 
process it. You also have the right to ask us to delete or remove your personal information where 
you have exercised your right to object to processing (see below);  
• 
request the restriction of processing of your personal information in certain circumstances. This 
enables you to ask us to suspend the processing of personal information about you, for example 
if you want us to establish its accuracy or the reason for processing it; and  
• 
request the transfer of your personal information to another party.  
You also have the right to object to the processing of your personal information where we are relying 
on a legitimate interest (or those of a third party) and there is something about your particular 
situation which makes you want to object to processing on this ground. You also have the right to 
object where we are processing your personal information for direct marketing purposes.  
You will not have to pay a fee to access your personal information (or to exercise any of the other 
rights above). However, we may charge a reasonable fee if your request for access is clearly 
unfounded or excessive. Alternatively, we may refuse to comply with the request in such 
circumstances.  
We may need to request specific information from you to help us confirm your identity and ensure 
your right to access the information (or to exercise any of your other rights). This is another 
appropriate security measure to ensure that personal information is not disclosed to any person who 
has no right to receive it.
