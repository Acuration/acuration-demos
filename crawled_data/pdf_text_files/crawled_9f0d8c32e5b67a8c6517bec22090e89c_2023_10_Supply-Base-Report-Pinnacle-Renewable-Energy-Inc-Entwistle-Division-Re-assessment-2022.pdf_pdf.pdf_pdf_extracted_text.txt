General description
Feedstock types: Primary, Secondary
Includes Supply Base evaluation (SBE): No
Includes REDII: Yes
Includes REDII SBE: Yes
Feedstock origin (countries): Canada
2.2
Description of countries included in the Supply Base
Country:Canada
Area/Region: Alberta
Sub-Scope: N/A
Exclusions: No
The supply base is the Province of Alberta, which has a total land base of 66.1 million hectares of which 
53% or (35 million hectares) is forested, where approximately 77% are within forest management 
agreement areas. Approximately 77% of Alberta Forests are within the Boreal-mixed forests, which 
includes several tree species such as white and black spruce, aspen, birch, balsam poplar, lodgepole pine, 
jack pine, balsam fir, larch and tamarack. There are numerous parks and protected areas within the 
Province totalling 9.5 million hectares or approximately 14% of the total land base. The Province of Alberta 
owns all public forested land within the Province totalling 35.2 million hectares. There are no species in 
Alberta that are currently listed in the CITES data base. 
 
The adjacent lands to the north (Northwest Territories) are dominated by alpine tundra & boreal forest 
types. Adjacent lands to the east (Saskatchewan) are dominated by sub-boreal & prairie forest types. To 
the south, there is the interior dry belt forest types in Montana. To the west, there are a range of ecological 
regimes in British Columbia; including coastal & interior temperate rainforests, interior dry belt, northern 
boreal forests, and on the edge of tundra forest types. 
 
Alberta has a robust sustainability and certification program covering all managed forest lands in the 
Province. Alberta Agriculture and Forestry has ISO 9001 certification for all ten offices in the Province 
conducting compliance monitoring on managed forest lands. Many licensees operating on managed forest 
lands also have voluntary certification schemes such as SFI, FSC or CSA that monitor forest management 
activities. All feedstock supplied in the province of Alberta is secondary feedstock. Purchases are facilitated 
through the central office in Prince George, British Columbia. For a detailed breakdown of the proportion for 
the Biomass Producer, please see feedstock summary tables below.
 
Forest tenure provides the authorization for companies to harvest timber from crown land. There are 
various forms of tenure; the three main categories of tenures are: forest management agreements (FMA’s), 
timber licenses, and timber permits. Approximately 87% of timber harvested in Alberta is from public lands 
with a forest management agreement. There can be multiple forest management units (FMU’s) within an 
FMA. Each FMU has specific measurable targets for forest management strategies and is how the Province 
ensures there is collaborative efforts for management strategies across the landscape level. Management 
of harvesting volume is governed under the Forests Act. Allowable annual cuts (AAC) are calculated at the 
FMU level using growth and yield data within the “green areas” of the FMU. An FMA will have one or more 
FMU’s and licensees operating in the FMA are responsible for implementing a Forest Management Plan 
(FMP) for their FMU. Provincial and FMU AAC’s fluctuate over time depending on variables that impact the 
amount of green area within the FMU such as an increase in parks and protected areas, natural disasters 
(wildfire or pests) changes in growth and yield data or changes to FMU boundaries. Management of 
harvesting practices is governed under the Forests Act and is detailed in the FMP’s for each operating 
licensee. Landscape level and site level forest management objectives are described in FMP’s. FMP’s are 
forward looking technical documents that can contain management plans for harvesting for a ten year 
period. The Provincial government, specifically the Ministry of Agriculture and Forestry has a compliance 
and enforcement division that inspects forest practices to ensure proponents are meeting the requirements 
of the FMP’s. Private land represents a relatively small portion of Alberta’s land base and does not overlap 
with managed forest boundaries. 
 
Private land is considered outside the timber harvesting and managed forest land base, and therefore is not 
reflected when determining FMU level AAC’s. Some parcels of private land contain treed areas that when 
harvested are sold to various wood product manufacturing facilities. The Agroforestry and Woodlot 
Extension Society governs best management practices for land owners who conduct timer harvesting on 
private land The timber and the harvesting practices on private land are governed by various pieces of 
Provincial and Federal legislation that ensure ownership and legality of timber is legitimate and impacts to 
natural systems are minimized. Less than 1% of the total fibre procured by PREI is from private land. 
 
The socio-economic landscape of Alberta includes major industries such as oil & gas, agriculture, 
construction, forestry, manufacturing, mining and tourism.
 
The BP sourced raw material from 42 suppliers in this supply base for the applicable period. 
 
Roundwood Calculation
The annual allowable cut for Alberta is approximately 31 million cubic meters per year. The proportion of 
the AAC consumed as primary feedstock at Drax plants is accounted for as follows:
Drax consumes primary feedstock at the Entwistle Division & Northern Pellet Limited Partnership.
Entwistle: Total Primary = 5,264.18 ODT x 2.3 = 12,107.61 m3
12,107.61 m3 / total provincial AAC 31 million m3 * 100 = 0.039% of AAC
Northern Pellet: Total Primary = 7,702.85 ODT x 2.3 = 17,716.56 m3
17,716.56 m3 / total provincial AAC 31 million m3 * 100 = 0.057% of AAC
Supply Base Regions
 
The province of Alberta is divided into "green zone" forest areas managed by government offices that 
authorize access to timber resources and "white zone" including private lands. The "green zone" forest 
areas where Drax sources fibre include[ii]:
 
1.
Calgary Forest Area
2.
Edson Forest Area
3.
Fort McMurray Forest Area
4.
Grande Prairie Forest Area
5.
High Level Forest Area
6.
Lac La Biche Forest Area
7.
Peace River Forest Area
8.
Rocky Mountain House Forest Area
9.

10. Whitecourt Forest Area
 
 
Drax controls fibre deliveries to two biomass production facilities in Alberta, strategically located in areas 
where residual fibre markets exist. The two biomass production facilities include:

Entwistle Division (DEN)

Northern Pellet Limited Partnership (DHL)
Fibre Supply
Drax’s feedstock consumption breakdown for Alberta operations are as follows:
Primary
20,286.375 mt
1.92%
Secondary
1,035,601.554 mt
98.08%
 
Primary fibre is received directly from the forest in the form of roundwood or in-forest chipping. Secondary 
fibre is pre-consumer residual material or biproducts, received in the form of bark, sawdust, shavings, 
chips, or other forms. In Alberta during the reporting period, Drax sources primary feedstock from 3 
suppliers & secondary feedstock from 39 suppliers.
Entwistle’s fibre supply consists of 1.05% Primary Feedstock & 98.95% Secondary Feedstock. 64.6% of 
Primary & 86.2% of Secondary Feedstock is SBP Compliant with the rest being SBP Controlled.

Sub-Scope: N/A
Exclusions: No
The supply base is the Province of Saskatchewan, which has a total land base of 65 million hectares of 
which 53% or 34.3 million hectares is forested, where approximately 34% (11.7 million hectares) are within 
the province’s commercial forest areas. All of Saskatchewan’s commercial forest areas are within the 
Boreal-mixed forests, which includes several tree species such as white and black spruce, aspen, balsam 
poplar, lodgepole pine, jack pine, & balsam fir. There are numerous parks and protected areas within the 
province totalling approximately 9% of the total land base. The Province of Saskatchewan owns most of the 
forested land within the Province totalling 33.2 million hectares (~97%). The other 3 percent of the 
provincial forest is owned either Federally (2%) or privately (1%). 
 
The adjacent lands to the north (Northwest Territories & Nunavut) are dominated by alpine tundra & boreal 
forest types. Adjacent lands to the east (Manitoba) are dominated by sub-boreal & prairie forest types. To 
the south, there is the interior dry belt forest types in Montana & North Dakota. To the west, the land base 
is dominated by boreal & sub-boreal forest types in Alberta.
 
Feedstock supplied in the province of Saskatchewan is classified as secondary feedstock originating from 
sawmills. Purchases are facilitated through the central office in Prince George, British Columbia. For a 
detailed breakdown of the proportion for the Biomass Producer, please see feedstock summary tables in 
section 3.3. 
 
Many licensees operating in the commercial forest lands have voluntary certification schemes such as SFI, 
FSC or CSA that monitor forest management activities. Forests with at least one form of FM certification 
account for ~62% of the commercial forest area (6,672,844 hectares as of 2021). 
 
For each timber supply area (TSA) in the commercial forest and fringe forest (Crown agriculture) zones, a 
harvest volume schedule (HVS) is calculated. The HVS is also known as an annual allowable cut (AAC) or 
sustainable wood supply in other Canadian jurisdictions. The HVS is determined based on the results of a 
timber supply analysis, which provides the output of the selected long-term forest resource management 
strategy using complex computer modelling. To ensure forest sustainability, the amount of timber harvested 
must not exceed the HVS for a specified term. Licensees are required to ensure their timber harvest levels 
do not exceed the HVS in each TSA. Stakeholders want to be assured that overharvesting is not occurring 
in provincial forests. This indicator provides stakeholders with evidence that the harvest at the provincial 
scale is being conducted on a sustainable basis. Provincial and TSA AAC’s fluctuate over time depending 
on variables that impact the amount of green area within the TSA such as an increase in parks and 
protected areas, natural disasters (wildfire or pests) changes in growth and yield data or changes to TSA 
boundaries. 
 
Management of harvesting practices is governed under the Forests Act & Forest Resource Management 
Act and is detailed in the forest management plan (FMP) for each operating licensee. Landscape level and 
site level forest management objectives are described in FMPs. FMPs are forward looking technical 
documents that can contain management plans for harvesting for a twenty-year period. The Provincial 
government has a compliance and enforcement division that inspects forest practices to ensure proponents 
are meeting the requirements of the FMP’s. 
 
Private & Federal lands represent a relatively small portion of Saskatchewan’s land base and do not 
overlap with managed forest boundaries. Harvesting volume is not regulated by the province on either land 
type but landowners are subject to the Private Land Stewardship Act which protects values such as soil, 
air, water, and biodiversity. The provincial government estimates that harvesting on these lands equates up 
to ~4% of the determined AAC. Some parcels of private land contain treed areas that when harvested are 
sold to various wood product manufacturing facilities. Less than 1% of the total fibre procured by Drax in 
Saskatchewan is from private or federal land. 
 
The socio-economic landscape of Saskatchewan includes major industries such as agriculture, 
construction, forestry, manufacturing, mining, and tourism. 
 
 The BP sourced raw material from 2 suppliers in this supply base for the applicable period.
 
Supply Base Regions
 
The province of Saskatchewan is divided into Commercial Forest areas & Fringe Forest areas managed by 
government offices that authorize access to timber resources and "Other Use areas" including areas not

2.3
Actions taken to promote certification amongst feedstock supplier
Customer demand for certified wood products drives extensive forest certification in BC. PREI requires that 
claim certificates for PEFC certified fibre are issued from PEFC certified suppliers. Drax requires all non-
certified suppliers and certified suppliers providing non-certified fibre, sign a supplier declaration verifying 
their compliance with the various legality, forest management and environmental requirements set out by 
the certification scheme.  Drax promotes certification schemes with suppliers as it is a core value of Drax's 
business. Drax provides suppliers with the tools necessary to achieve certification compliance through 
shared knowledge.

Describe the harvesting type which best describes how your material is sourced: Mix of the above
Explanation: Forests can be harvested in a variety of forms. For example: clearcutting, commercial thinning, 
& ecosystem-based management (EBM). Typical machines used in forestry operations include feller 
bunchers, skidders, & processors. Maximum clear-cut area regulations for the province are specified in 
legislation.
Was the forest in the Supply Base managed for a purpose other than for energy markets? Yes - 
Majority
Explanation: Forest products such as lumber, plywood, veneer, pulp, & strand board are the main markets 
for Alberta & Saskatchewan forest activities. 
For the forests in the Supply Base, is there an intention to retain, restock or encourage natural 
regeneration within 5 years of felling? Yes - Majority
Explanation: In Alberta, the management of harvesting practices is governed under the Forests Act & 
Timber Management Regulation. After cutting, the timber disposition holder (cutting authority) has an 
obligation to ensure the stand is replaced. The cutting authority is then responsible for carrying out 
reforestation in the year following the cut. They will conduct surveys in the management unit after 
reforestation and submit them to their local department of the Minister of the Forestry Division. This survey 
requirement is to be within 2 years after the end of the year in which the area was cut. In Saskatchewan, the 
Forest Resources Management Regulations specify "Every licensee who holds a licence respecting a forest 
management agreement, or a term supply licence, that includes the obligation for renewal shall ensure that 
renewal activities are carried out on all lands in the licence area from which forest products have been 
harvested"
Was the feedstock used in the biomass removed from a forest as part of a pest/disease control 
measure or a salvage operation? Yes - Minority
Explanation: Some purchased feedstock was from salvage operations due to fire, insect, or other 
environmental damage. This may have came in the form of primary or secondary feedstock.
