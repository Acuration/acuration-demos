Market Review: Gas
Q4 UK gas prices lower than July 2011

Weather – 2011 second mildest year

High storage inventories

Record LNG imports
But UK prices remain at premium to US

Continued decline of UKCS

Exports to the continent
through IUK
Feb 2012 UK spot prices at 6 year high

Cold weather across Europe
UK pricing dynamics – complex
relationships

Risk of low LNG availability to the UK
due to increasing demand from Asia

Coal Switching Price (CSP)
can act as a floor
UK gas prices trend towards
oil indexed European prices
to attract imports

ROC Banding Review Consultation
DECC Conclusions and Proposals
Consultation published October 2011
DECC stated intent to minimise impact on customer
bills by supporting most cost effective technologies
Explicit recognition of strategic benefits of biomass
generation in existing coal stations

Cost effective, reliable, flexible

New bands for enhanced co-firing (>15%)
and conversion (>90%)

Proposed support for both set at 1.0 ROC

Rationale for equal support is progressive
unit conversion of large stations like Drax
Proposed support for dedicated biomass set at
1.5 ROCs (reducing to 1.4 in 2016)
“We should […] increase
support for an expansion in
sustainable biomass
generation, which is reliable
and cost effective, and will
help us to meet our
renewables target.”
Rt Hon David Cameron MP
Prime Minister’s Questions
25 January 2012
Drax Group plc
Preliminary Results – Year Ended 31 December 2011

Drax consultation response – co-firing / conversion:

At 1.0 ROC Drax can increase co-firing

Moderate uplift in ROC support required to maximise potential
Drax consultation response – dedicated:

Investment case highly challenging for independent generators at 1.5 – 1.4 ROCs

Cancelled development at Drax site

Exploring options for Immingham project


Further testing required for NOx performance
and unusual biomass fuels
Early results

High biomass burn well demonstrated

Plant flexibility with biomass well demonstrated

Advanced understanding of chemistry
dynamics
Final results due H2 2012


Supply chain immature and bespoke

International port, shipping, UK port

Four strands to fuel contracting strategy

Term pellet contracting from pellet plant owners

Term fibre contracting from strategic forest partners

Investment in pellet plants would provide good fuel security

Spot and shorter term opportunistic purchases

Fuel envelope key

Development of UK sourcing

Likely to be small proportion
– predominantly energy crops
Diverse geographies and fibre sources

Early concentration in North America
Balancing flexibility with security of supply
Large fibre and pellet contracts typically:

7-10 year term

Fixed price with some inflation
and fuel indexation


All Drax biomass procured against industry-
leading sustainability policy, including:

Life cycle GHG(1) emission requirements
across entire supply chain

60% reduction against EU Fossil Fuel Comparator

Land use and biodiversity assessment

Independent audit of supply chain
Robust UK sustainability legislation in place

Mandatory standards from 2013

Implementation rules still to be confirmed
High confidence Drax fuel sourcing strategy
will meet current mandatory standards

Now in 5th year of carbon foot-printing

Significant number of supplier audits completed
Sustainability standards should be
grandfathered at time of contracting

Facilitates term contracting

ROC Cash Flows and Accounting
ROC generation measured in annual
compliance periods (April – March)
ROC cash flows typically 6 months after
annual compliance period ends

Impacts working capital
Drax historically recognised ROC benefit
in P&L only at time of ROC sale

Similar timing to cash flows
Drax accounting change in 2012 –
P&L benefit in period of ROC generation

Matches ROC support with biomass fuel costs

ROC value estimated based on market price
No significant impact on earnings profile
until ROC support increased (April 2013)
Exploring opportunities to accelerate
ROC cash flows

Better match with earnings
