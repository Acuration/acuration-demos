Drainage features would be enhanced
for wildlife with scrub / hedgerow
planting and species rich grassland
Planting on southern boundary next to the runway
would link with adjacent plantations to produce a
significant linear woodland along the southern
edge of the developed airfield. Part of this
planting could be implemented at the start
of the construction programme.
Planting would be set on a low
mound 1.5m high along the full
length of the southern
boundary
Structure planting for visual screening
and landscape integration. Security
fencing would be set behind the planting
Hedgerow / hedgerow tree planting adjacent to Castleton Way
could be implemented at the start of the construction works so
it has more visual impact when the project is commissioned
Structure planting approximately 20m wide
on the western and southern boundaries of
the PGP site would provide a visual screen
and reinforce the historic runways. Security
fencing would be set behind the planting
Scrub / shrub planting for ecological
connectivity and habitat creation

Notes
•
This drawing is to be read in conjunction with the
Interim Landscape Mitigation Strategy (as
amended).
•
The proposed planting and mounding layout is
indicative only and is the minimum that would be
provided for landscape mitigation. The detailed
proposals will be developed in conjunction with
the detailed engineering proposals and in
discussion with National Grid, in order to fulfil
draft DCO Requirements 4 and 5.
•
Do not scale off this plan. The proposed layout
comprises small features which cannot be
measured accurately on the 1: 5,000 Ordnance
Survey map data when printed at A3 size.

Woodland planting layout would reflect the
strongly rectangular field pattern and would
help mitigate loss of the historic field pattern.
Existing hedges would be retained within
the new planting where possible. Security
fencing would be set behind the planting.
