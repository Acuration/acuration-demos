Visualisation 
Design Principles from DCO Stage 
 2. Siting, design and layout of the proposed buildings to 
respond positively to the receiving environment.
 3. Buildings, structures and means of enclosure to be 
sensitive
 To use recessive materials to minimise the visual impacts 
Design Principles from DCO Stage 
 15. Breaking up the facades and roof profiles into vertical 
sections through the use of materials and design details.
 16. The external materials and shall be recessive in colour 
 17. Incorporate architectural features to add visual interest 
while acknowledging the need for simplicity in the form and 
design
 Colour, tones and profile of the cladding will assist in 
blending into the surrounding landscape.
 The Cladding scale and colour will be arranged 
vertically to ensure the buildings are grounded into the 
surrounding landscape.
 The use of more earthy colours to reflect the 
agricultural and rural area.
Annex 3 – Electrical Connection Compound Design Sheet 
 The colour and finish will be neutral
 Recognition of the horizontal strata of existing 
landscape foreground and mature tree lines and 
hedgerows in the far distance.
 The visual reference for this design mitigation approach 
is that of agricultural farm building structures in the 
wider landscape.
Annex 3 – Electrical Connection Compound Design Sheet 
 Perimeter landscaping and land modelling around the 
perimeter assist in the visual mitigation particularly from 
mid and long distances.

Landscape Character Assessment 
Ancient Plateau Claylands (landscape character type)
 Landholding & enclosure (field) pattern
 Removal of hedges to amalgamate fields – open ‘prairie 
landscape’
 Visual  experience – ‘views are frequently open, though 
some woodland present in views’
 Condition – ‘historical field pattern thinned out’ 
 Development management – ‘long-term landscape 
enhancement’
Landscape Character

 Hedgerows and copses

For discussion …  
 Massing – which option would integrate best into the 
local landscape character & public views? 
 Materials – which options help to reduce the apparent 
scale of the building more? 
 Colour – which proposed colours would be most in 
keeping with the landscape?
 Of all the options, including option 2b ‘Vernacular’ & 
option 3 ‘Recessive’ …. Which do you prefer?
