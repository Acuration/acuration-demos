Electric or Not?
Where does electricity come from?
Some electricity comes from natural sources – such as 
the sun, wind and water – as well as man-made sources 
like biomass.
In 2020, Drax Power Station – using biomass – was the 
UK’s biggest single generator of renewable electricity.
What’s electricity and what does it do?
Electricity is a kind of energy that makes lots of the things 
around us work. We call these things electrical appliances .
They give out light, make sound, heat things up, and make them 
move. Some things (like toy cars) use batteries to power them 
– and batteries store electricity.

How does electricity get into our homes?
Traditionally, huge power stations like Drax have generated electricity and it’s then travelled along 
power lines across the country. Once it  arrives at our homes, it’s ready to power our appliances when 
we need them. 
We also buy batteries, with a certain amount of power stored inside them, for using with other items 
in our homes.
The UK’s energy system will use an increasing amount of renewable power in the coming years – 
with more of it produced by a growing number of smaller generators. This means we’ll probably see 
more local – not national – power networks setting up. At home, we’ll still be able to use the power 
when we want!
