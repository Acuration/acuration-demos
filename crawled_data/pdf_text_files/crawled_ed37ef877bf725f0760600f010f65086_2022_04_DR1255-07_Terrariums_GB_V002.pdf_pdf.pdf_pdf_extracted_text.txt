The water cycle is happening around us all the 
time! However, it’s not always easy to recognise as 
it’s happening on such a big scale.
To see the changes happening in front of our eyes, 
we can make our own environment: a terrarium.
This is the posh name for a container with a sealable lid where you can grow plants. 
It’s usually made from glass or plastic, since both materials allow light to enter, and 
the lid allows for access and means the terrarium has its own atmosphere inside. 
Once the terrarium is set up with plants, add a small amount of water, close and seal 
the lid, and then observe the water cycle in action!
Drops of condensation will form on the glass, get heavy, and start to “rain” down. The 
plants soak up the water in their roots, then “breathe” with respiration, releasing the 
water (and oxygen) into the air. This then condenses on the glass – and the process 
starts all over again.
You shouldn’t need to water the plants again; you’ve created your own little living world!
