Drax Group plc 
Nominations Committee Terms of Reference 
Approved by the Board on 20 February 2023 
1 Introduction  
The board of directors of Drax Group plc (the “Board”) hereby constitutes and establishes a 
nominations committee (the “Committee”). The purpose of the Committee is to monitor the 
balance of skills, knowledge, experience, independence and diversity of the Board and its 
Committees; to ensure appropriate procedures are in place for the nomination, selection, 
training and evaluation of Directors; and ensure appropriate procedures and plans are in 
place for succession planning for Executive Directors and senior management. 
 These terms of reference have been produced to identify and formalise the roles, tasks and 
responsibilities of the Committee for compliance with the UK guidance on corporate 
governance and to assist the Committee in achieving best practice in corporate governance.  
2 Membership  
2.1 Members of the Committee shall be appointed by the Board for a period determined by 
the Board and complying with paragraph 2.3 and shall be at least three non-executive 
directors in number, the majority of whom shall be independent non-executive directors. 
 2.2 Only members of the Committee have the right to attend Committee meetings. Other 
individuals, such as the Chief Executive, the head of human resources and external advisers, 
may be invited to attend for all or part of any meeting, as and when appropriate. However, 
an executive will not attend the part of any Committee meetings when his or her own 
nomination is being discussed.  
2.3 Appointments to the Committee are made by the Board, on the recommendation of the 
Committee, and shall be for a period of up to three years, which may be extended for two 
further three-year periods provided the director still meets the criteria for membership of 
the committee. Any term beyond six years for a non-executive director should be subject to 
rigorous review, and should take into account the need for progressive refreshing of the 
Board.  
2.4 The Board shall appoint the Committee Chair (who shall be either the Chair of the Board 
or an independent non-executive director) and may also appoint one of the members of the 
Committee as deputy Chair. In the absence of the Committee Chair and/or an appointed 
deputy, the remaining members present shall elect one of their number to chair the meeting 
from those who would qualify under these terms of reference to be appointed to that 
position by the Board. The Chair of the Board shall not chair the Committee when it is 
dealing with the appointment of their successor.  
3 Secretary  
3.1 The secretary of Drax Group plc, or their nominee, shall act as the secretary of the 
Committee and shall ensure that the Committee receives information and papers in a timely 
manner to enable full and proper consideration of the issues.  
4 Quorum  
4.1 The quorum necessary for the transaction of business shall be two, both of whom must 
be independent non-executive directors. A duly convened meeting of the Committee at 
which a quorum is present shall be competent to exercise all or any of the authorities, 
powers and discretions vested in or exercisable by the Committee.  
5 Frequency of Meetings 
5.1 The Committee shall meet at least twice a year and at such other times as the Chair of 
the Committee shall require.  
6 Notice of Meetings  
6.1 Meetings of the Committee shall be summoned by the secretary of the Committee at the 
request of the Chair of the Committee or any of its members. Unless otherwise agreed, 
notice of each meeting confirming the venue, time and date, together with an agenda of 
items to be discussed, shall be forwarded to each member of the Committee, any other 
person required to attend and all other non-executive directors, no later than three working 
days before the date of the meeting. Supporting papers shall be sent to Committee 
members and to other attendees as appropriate, at the same time.  
7 Minutes of Meetings  
7.1 The secretary shall minute the proceedings and resolutions of all Committee meetings, 
including the names of those present and in attendance.  
7.2 Minutes of Committee meetings shall be circulated promptly to all members of the 
Committee and the Chair of the Board and, once agreed, to all other members of the Board 
unless, in the opinion of the committee Chair, it would be inappropriate to do so.  
8 Engagement with shareholders  
8.1 The Chair of the Committee shall attend the annual general meeting prepared to 
respond to any shareholder questions on the Committee’s activities. In addition, the Chair of 
the Committee should seek engagement with shareholders on significant matters related to 
the Committee’s areas of responsibility.

conflict of interest and require him or her to report any future business interests 
that could result in a conflict of interest. These must be authorised by the Board 
prior to appointment and any future business interests that could result in a conflict 
of interest must not be undertaken without prior authorisation of the Board;

success of the company in the light of the knowledge, skills and experience required, 
and the need for progressive refreshing of the Board (particularly in relation to

9.2.6 any matters relating to the continuation in office of any director at any time 
including the suspension or termination of service of an executive director as an 
employee of the company subject to the provisions of the law and their service 
contract; and

positions of Chair and Chief Executive, the recommendation for which would be 
considered at a meeting of the Board. In considering the appointment of the Chair 
and Chief Executive the Board may have regard to, but not necessarily act in 
accordance with, a recommendation from the Committee.
