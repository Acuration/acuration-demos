Air Quality  
6.1 
Introduction 
6.1.1 
This chapter identifies and assesses the preliminary findings of the potential effects 
that the Project, as described in Chapter 3: Project and Site Description, may 
have on air quality within the study area (detailed in Section 6.4 (c)) and identifies 
the mitigation measures that will be implemented to prevent or reduce potential 
adverse air quality effects, where possible.   
6.1.2 
The effects of the Project have been assessed using a detailed dispersion model to 
predict the effects of the proposed operational Open Cycle Gas Turbine (OCGT) 
exhaust stack emissions, based on the emission limit values set out in the Industrial 
Emissions Directive (IED) (Ref. 6.1).   
6.1.3 
In addition to air quality effects from the proposed OCGT stack emissions, an 
assessment has been undertaken of the potential for dust generation from the 
construction phase.  
6.1.4 
Potential effects on air quality are interrelated with impacts on ecological receptors.  
This chapter should be read in conjunction with Chapter 8: Ecology and Chapter 
12: Traffic, Transport and Access of this PEIR.   
a) Objectives of the assessment 
6.1.5 
The objectives of the assessment were to: 
 
Assess impacts during the construction phase of the Project in terms of 
construction dust; 
 
Determine the appropriate stack height for the Generating Equipment so as to 
overcome building downwash effects and minimise off-site air quality impacts; 
and 
 
Assess the impacts of the Generating Equipment stack emissions on air 
quality, in terms of human health and ecological impacts, based on the 
optimum stack height selected. 
6.2 
Changes since the 2014 PEIR 
6.2.1 
There have been changes to the design as a result of design evolution and 
consultation as detailed in Chapter 3: Project and Site Description. To aid the 
reader, Table 6-1 below outlines the changes to this assessment compared with the 
2014 PIER.

6.3 
Legislation, policy and guidance  
b)  National and European Air Quality Legislation and Policy 
i. 
Local Air Quality Management 
6.3.1 
The provisions of Part IV of the Environment Act 1995 establish a national 
framework for air quality management, which requires all local authorities in 
England, Scotland and Wales to conduct local air quality reviews. Section 82(1) of 
the Act requires these reviews to include an assessment of the current air quality in 
the area and the predicted air quality in future years. Should the reviews indicate 
that the objectives prescribed in the Air Quality Strategy for England, Scotland, 
Abergelli PEIR 2018 – CHAPTER 6: AIR QUALITY

AECOM 
6-5 
 
Wales and Northern Ireland (Ref. 6.2) and the Air Quality Standards (Wales) 
Regulations 2010 (Ref. 6.3) will not be met, the local authority is required to 
designate an Air Quality Management Area (AQMA). Action must then be taken at a 
local level to ensure that air quality in the area improves. This process is known as 
‘local air quality management’ or LAQM and the approach to be followed by Welsh 
Local Authorities is detailed within the Local Air Quality Management in Wales 
Policy Guidance (Ref. 6.4). 
ii. Air Quality Strategy 
6.3.2 
The Air Quality Strategy (AQS) identifies nine ambient air pollutants that have the 
potential to cause harm to human health, with the exception of ozone which is 
instead considered to be a regional problem, and two for the protection of 
vegetation and ecosystems. The AQS defines objectives for these pollutants that 
aim to reduce the impacts of these pollutants to negligible levels. The objectives 
are not mandatory but rather policy intentions made by the UK Government and its 
Devolved Administrations which set targets that local authorities should try to 
achieve.  
6.3.3 
The current AQS was published in July 2007 and updates the original strategy to 
set out new objectives for local authorities in undertaking their local air quality 
management duties. The AQS objectives are based on the evidence supporting the 
identification of the limit values and, in some instances, objectives in the current 
AQS may be more onerous than the limit values set out within the relevant 
European Union (EU) Directives and the Air Quality Standards (Wales) Regulations 
2010. It is not a specific legal requirement to comply with objectives set within the 
AQS except where equivalent limit values are set within the EU Directives and Air 
Quality Standards (Wales) Regulations 2010. 
iii. European Air Quality Directives 
6.3.4 
The Air Quality Framework Directive (96/62/EC) (Ref. 6.5) on ambient air quality 
assessment and management defines the policy framework for 12 air pollutants 
known to have a harmful effect on human health and the environment. The limit 
values for the specific pollutants are set through a series of Daughter Directives.  
 
Directive 1999/30/EC (the 1st Daughter Directive) sets limit values (values not 
to be exceeded) for sulphur dioxide, nitrogen dioxide and oxides of nitrogen, 
particulate matter (dust) and lead in ambient air; 
 
Directive 2000/69/EC (the 2nd Daughter Directive) establishes limit values for 
concentrations of benzene and carbon monoxide in ambient air; 
 
Directive 2002/3/EC (the 3rd Daughter Directive) establishes long-term 
objectives, target values, an alert threshold and an information threshold for 
concentrations of ozone in ambient air; 
 
Directive 2004/107/EC (the 4th Daughter Directive) establishes a target value 
for the concentration of arsenic, cadmium, nickel and benzo(a)pyrene in 
ambient air so as to avoid, prevent or reduce harmful effects of arsenic, 
cadmium, nickel and polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons on human health and 
the environment as a whole.

6.3.5 
The Air Quality Standards (Wales) Regulations 2010 (Ref. 6.6) came into force on 
11th June 2010, replacing the previous Air Quality Standards (Wales) Regulations 
2007.  The 2010 regulations transpose into national legislation the requirements of 
Directive 
2008/50/EC 
and 
Directive 
2004/107/EC. 
Directive 
2008/50/EC 
consolidates existing air quality legislation apart from the 4th Daughter Directive 
and provides a new regulatory framework for PM2.5. 
6.3.6 
It makes provision under Article 22 for Member States to postpone attainment 
deadlines and allow an exemption from the obligation to limit values for certain 
pollutants, subject to strict conditions and assessment by the European 
Commission. 
iv. Air Quality Objectives and Limit Values 
6.3.7 
The air quality objectives and limit values currently applying to the UK can therefore 
be split into two groups.  Each has a different legal status and is therefore handled 
differently within the framework of UK air quality policy. These are: 
 
EU limit values transcribed into UK legislation for which compliance is 
mandatory; and 
 
AQS objectives set down in regulations for the purposes of local air quality 
management. 
6.3.8 
The AQS objectives and EU limit values relevant to this assessment are set out in 
Table 6-2 and Table 6-3.  It should be noted that while PM10 and PM2.5 are included 
in the following tables these are only relevant to construction dust and road vehicle 
emission as particulate matter emission from burning natural gas is considered to 
be negligible.

EU Directive 96/61/EC (Ref. 6.7) concerning Integrated Pollution Prevention and 
Control (“the IPPC Directive”) applies an integrated environmental approach to the

regulation of certain industrial activities. The Environmental Permitting Regulations 
(EPR) 2016 (Ref. 6.8) implement the IPPC Directive relating to installations in 
England and Wales. The Regulations define activities that require an Environmental 
Permit from NRW.  
6.3.10 EPR is a regulatory system that employs an integrated approach to control the 
environmental impacts of certain listed industrial activities including the generation 
of energy. The intention of the regulatory system is to ensure that Best Available 
Techniques (BAT), required by the IPPC Directive, are used to prevent or minimise 
the effects of an activity on the environment, having regard to the effects of 
emissions to air, land and water via a single permitting process. 
6.3.11 To gain a permit, operators have to demonstrate in their applications that the 
techniques they are using or are proposing to use are the BAT for their installation 
and meet certain other requirements taking account of relevant local factors. The 
permitting process also places a duty on the regulating body to ensure that the 
requirements of the Industrial Emissions Directive 2010/75/EU (IED) (Ref. 6.1) are 
included for permitted sites to which these apply. 
6.3.12 The essence of BAT is that the techniques selected to protect the environment 
should achieve a high degree of protection of people and the environment taken as 
a whole. Indicative BAT standards are laid out in national guidance and where 
relevant, should be applied unless a different standard can be justified for a 
particular installation. NRW, as the regulating body, is legally obliged to require 
more than BAT requirements where EU Air Quality Limit Values may be exceeded 
by an existing operator. 
6.3.13 The Environment Agency’s (EA) “Air emissions risk assessment for your 
environmental permit” guidance (Ref. 6.9) (as applied by NRW), sets out the 
approach that should be followed when assessing the potential air quality impacts 
of a development. This comprises of an initial screening assessment making it 
possible to identify emissions that result in “insignificant” impacts and therefore 
further assessment is not required. 
6.3.14 The EA guidance provides further assessment criteria in the form of EALs. The 
EALs are additional assessment criteria outside of those that are set out in the AQS 
objectives/limit values and are used for regulatory purposes to assess emissions 
that are not under local authority control or receptors, such as ecological sites, 
which can cover extensive areas outside of the local authority boundary.  
6.3.15 Table 6-4 presents the EALs relevant to this assessment.

vi. Critical Loads and Levels for Sensitive Ecological Receptors 
6.3.16 The UK is bound by the terms of the European Birds and Habitats Directives (Ref. 
6.10) and the Ramsar Convention (Ref. 6.11). The Conservation of Habitats and 
Species Regulations 2010 (Ref. 6.12) provides for the protection of European sites 
created under these polices, i.e. Special Areas of Conservation (SACs) designated 
pursuant to the Habitats Directive, Special Protection Areas (SPAs) classified under 
the Birds Directive, and Ramsar Sites designated as wetlands of international 
importance. The 2010 Regulations apply specific provisions of the European 
Directives to SACs, SPAs, candidate SACs (cSACs) and proposed SPAs (pSPAs), 
which require them to be given special consideration and further assessment by 
any development which is likely to lead to a significant effect upon them. 
6.3.17 The impact of emissions from the Generating Equipment on sensitive ecological 
receptors are quantified within this assessment in two ways: 
 
As direct impacts arising due to increases in atmospheric pollutant 
concentrations; assessed against Critical Levels (i.e. NOx), and 
 
Indirect impacts arising through deposition of acids and nutrient nitrogen to the 
ground surface, assessed against Critical Loads. 
6.3.18 The critical levels for NOx for the protection of vegetation and ecosystems are 
30 µg/m3 as an annual mean and 75 µg/m3 as a daily mean.  The critical levels 
apply at all relevant ecological areas regardless of habitat type.  These values have 
been adopted as the assessment criteria for the impact of the Generating 
Equipment on designated nature sites. 
6.3.19 Critical load are set to assess the impacts of a development on the ecological 
feature of interest in terms of eutrophication (deposition of nutrient nitrogen) and 
acidification (deposition of nitrogen and sulphur) and are dependent on the habitat 
type and species present, and are specific to the sensitive receptors considered 
within the assessment. The critical loads are set out on the Air Pollution Information 
System (APIS) website (Ref. 6.13).   
6.3.20 Critical loads are set at levels below which significant harmful effects do not occur.  
For eutrophication critical loads are given in terms of the mass of nitrogen 
deposited per unit area over a year (kgN/ha/yr) and are given as a range e.g. 10-15 
kgN/ha/yr.  For acidification the critical load is assessed relevant to a Critical Load 
Function (CLF) which assesses the relative contributions of nitrogen and sulphur 
and the sensitivity of the habitat in question to each pollutant.  To determine the 
CLF the sulphur deposition is plotted vs nitrogen deposition based on the following 
three quantities: 
 
Maximum critical load for sulphur - CLmax(S); 
 
Minimum critical load for nitrogen - CLmin(N); and 
 
Maximum critical load for nitrogen - CLmax(N).

6.3.21 Some habitat types are not considered sensitive to eutrophication or acidification 
and for these habitats there is no relevant critical load against which contributions 
from a development can be assessed. 
6.3.22 The APIS website also provides background NOx concentrations and nitrogen/acid 
deposition rates for use in assessing the impacts of a development on ecological 
sites where the Process Contributions (PC) from the development exceed the 
relevant screening criteria. 
6.3.23 The critical load criteria adopted for the sensitive ecological receptors considered 
by this assessment are presented in the Habitats Regulation Assessment which 
accompanies Chapter 8: Ecology.  
vii. Industrial Emission Directive (IED) Emission Limits 
6.3.24 The Project will be designed and operated in accordance with the requirements of 
the IED, which requires adherence to emission limits for a range of pollutants. 
Emission Limit Values (ELVs) are maximum concentrations of residual pollutants 
that can be released at source usually from a stack from the Project.  The relevant 
ELVs for the Generating Equipment are set out in Annex V Part 1 of the IED. The 
IED emission limits applicable to the Project are set out in Table 6-5.

c) Planning Policy 
i. 
National Policy Statements 
6.3.25 The overarching National Policy Statement for Energy (EN-1) (Ref. 6.14), the 
National Policy Statement for Fossil Fuel Electricity Generating Infrastructure (EN-
2) (Ref. 6.15), the National Policy Statement for Gas Supply Infrastructure, Gas and 
Oil Pipelines (EN-4) (Ref. 6.16), and the National Policy Statement for Electricity 
Networks Infrastructure (EN-5) (Ref. 6.17) were adopted by Parliament in July 
2011. EN-1 describes the requirements for an air quality assessment for energy 
and electricity infrastructure projects and identifies traffic emissions, air pollution, 
dust and odour as issues for human health that need to be taken into account in 
the assessment of any proposed schemes, along with the effects of nuisance on 
sensitive receptors. EN-2 and EN-4 do not set out additional guidance for air 
quality, referring the reader back to the overarching guidance and approach set out 
in EN1.  EN-5 does not specifically reference air quality.  EN-1 specifically 
references the issue of air quality, and these are set out below.

Paragraph 5.2.1 states:  
“Infrastructure development can have adverse effects on air quality. The 
construction, operation and decommissioning phases can involve emissions to air 
which could lead to adverse impacts on health, on protected species and habitats, 
or on the wider countryside.”  
Paragraph 5.2.2 states that: 
"the Government has determined that CO2 emissions are not reasons to prohibit 
the consenting of projects" and that the "[IPC] does not, therefore, need to assess 
individual applications in terms of carbon emissions against carbon budgets and 
this section [NPS EN-1, Section 5.2 Air quality and emissions] does not address 
CO2 emissions.” 
Paragraph 5.2.7 states:  
“The ES should describe: 
 
Any significant air emissions, their mitigation and any residual effects 
distinguishing between the project stages and taking account of any significant 
emissions from any road traffic generated by the project; 
 
The predicted absolute emission levels of the proposed project, after mitigation 
methods have been applied; 
 
Existing air quality levels and the relative change in air quality from existing 
levels;  
 
Any potential eutrophication impact.” 
ii. Planning Policy Wales 
6.3.26 Current land use policies for Wales are set out in Planning Policy Wales (‘PPW’) 
(9th Edition, November 2016) (Ref. 6.18). The policy document is supplemented by 
a series of Technical Advice Notes (‘TANs’).  Paragraph 13.12.1 of PPW states that: 
“The potential for pollution affecting the use of land will be a material consideration 
in deciding whether to grant planning permission.  Material considerations in 
determining applications for potentially polluting development are likely to include: 
 
Location, taking into account such considerations as the reasons for selecting 
the chosen site itself; 
 
Impact on health and amenity; 
 
The risk and impact of potential pollution from the development, insofar as this 
might have an effect on the use of other land and the surrounding environment 
(the environmental regulatory regime may well have an interest in these 
issues, particularly if the development would impact on an Air Quality 
Management Area or a SAC); 
 
Prevention of nuisance; 
 
Impact on the road and other transport networks, and in particular on traffic 
generation; and

 
The need, where relevant, and feasibility of restoring the land (and water 
resources) to standards sufficient for an appropriate after use. (Powers under 
the Pollution Prevention and Control Act 1999 require an operator to return a 
site to a satisfactory state on surrender of an Integrated Pollution Prevention 
and Control Permit).” 
iii. Local Planning Policy – City and County Swansea 
6.3.27 City and County Swansea’s (CCS’s) Unitary Development Plan (UDP) (Ref. 6.19), 
adopted on 10th November 2008, is the councils most up to date Development 
Plan that will be used in the determination of planning applications.  CCS submitted 
the Swansea Local Development Plan (LDP) (Ref. 6.20) to the Ministers of the 
Welsh Government for independent examination, in 28 July 2017.  If approved and 
once adopted by CCS, this will replace the UDP. 
6.3.28 CCS’s UDP includes Policy EV40, which states, “Development proposals will not 
be permitted that would cause or result in significant harm to health, local amenity, 
natural heritage, the historic environment or landscape character because of 
significant levels of air, noise or light pollution” the policy further states that, 
“planning permission will not be granted for developments that would cause 
significant harm to air quality by virtue of emissions from the development itself or 
the additional new traffic movements it would generate.” 
iv. City and County Swansea Air Quality Action Plan 
6.3.29 CCS declared parts of the lower Swansea Valley an AQMA in 2001, for exceedance 
of annual mean NO2 objective. The originally declared AQMA was amended in 
2010 due to further exceedance of NO2 objective occurring within the Sketty and 
Fforestfach areas. The latest published Air Quality Progress report for year 2016 
(Ref. 6.21) states that the latest monitoring indicates areas of exceedances of the 
NO2 annual mean objective outside the current AQMA. Therefore CCS has 
proposed to undertake a Detailed Assessment study for an area located within City 
Centre.  At the time of writing the results of the Detailed Assessment have not been 
published, however given the distance of the Project Site from the City Centre the 
impacts of any emissions from the Generating Equipment on any potential AQMA is 
anticipated to be negligible.  
6.3.30 CCS published the Air Quality Action Plan (AQAP) in 2004 (Ref. 6.22) which 
outlined air quality improvement measures for declared AQMA. The AQAP 
incorporates work already undertaken by the CCS in the Local Transport Plan and 
Unitary Development Plan.

Methodology 
a) Scope of the assessment 
6.4.1 
The scope of this assessment has been determined through a formal EIA scoping 
opinion given by the Secretary of State. Comments raised on the EIA Scoping 
Report have been taken into account in the development of the assessment 
methodology and these are detailed where relevant in this chapter.  Responses to 
the comments raised in the EIA Scoping Opinion can be found in Appendix 4.3 and 
Table 6-6. 
6.4.2 
The approach to the assessment of emissions from the Project will involve the 
following key elements: 
 
Establish appropriate air quality assessment criteria for the Project in terms of 
EU Limit values, AQS objectives and EALs. 
 
Establishing the background ambient concentrations of each relevant pollutant. 
 
Qualitative assessment of construction phase dust and PM10 emissions in 
terms of the Power Generation Plant, Gas Connection and Electrical 
Connection.  The assessment will consider dust nuisance, human health 
impacts and ecological impact. 
 
Detailed consideration of stack height for the Generating Equipment. 
 
Quantitative assessment of the operational effects on local air quality from 
stack emissions utilising a “new generation” Gaussian dispersion model 
assessed in terms of process contributions (PC) from the site in isolation, and 
assessment of resultant predicted environmental concentrations (PEC) taking 
into account cumulative impacts through incorporation of the background 
concentration. Modelling will consider: 
 
For Human Health, NO2 and CO concentrations will be predicted and 
compared with the relevant standard.  
 
For sensitive ecosystems, concentrations of NOx, and will be modelled along 
with nitrogen and acid depositions at the closest sensitive ecological receptor 
sites. 
 
An assessment of the significance of the potential impacts of the development 
will be made with reference to appropriate air quality assessment criteria and 
critical loads and critical levels set out in the APIS system for ecological 
receptors. 
6.4.3 
The following items have been scoped out of further consideration: 
 
Operational emissions from the Gas Connection and Electrical Connection; 
 
Construction and operation traffic emissions; and  
 
Odour. 
i. 
Traffic Emissions 
6.4.4 
In order to assess potential traffic impacts during construction, operation, 
maintenance and decommissioning the EPUK/IAQM Land-Use guidance (Ref. 23) 
provides indicative criteria to aid in determining if an air quality assessment is 
Abergelli PEIR 2018 – CHAPTER 6: AIR QUALITY 
 
 
Prepared for:  Abergelli Power Limited 
 
AECOM 
6-14 
 
required.  The IAQM/EPUK guidance states that in terms of road traffic and 
assessment is required where the development will: 
 
Cause a significant change in Light Duty Vehicle (LDV) traffic flows on local 
roads with relevant receptors. (LDV = cars and small vans <3.5 t gross vehicle 
weight). A change in LDV flows is considered to be an increase of more than 
100 Annual Average Daily Traffic (AADT) movements within or adjacent to an 
AQMA or more than 500 AADT elsewhere. 
 
Cause a significant change in Heavy Duty Vehicle (HDV) flows on local roads 
with relevant receptors. (HDV = goods vehicles + buses >3.5 t gross vehicle 
weight). A change in LDV flows is considered to be an increase of more than 
25 AADT within or adjacent to an AQMA or more than 100 AADT elsewhere. 
 
Realign roads, i.e. changing the proximity of receptors to traffic lanes. Where 
the change is 5 m or more and the road is within an AQMA. 
6.4.5 
The Project is located over 5 km from the closest AQMA and is not anticipated to 
lead to a change in traffic flows on any roads covered by an AQMA, as such the 
factors related to non-AQMA changes are applicable to this assessment.  The 
traffic assessment, Chapter 12: Traffic, Transport and Access, sets out predicted 
changes in traffic flows associated with the construction, operational and 
decommissioning phases of the development.  The predicated increase in LDV and 
HDV movements associated with the Project is well below the limits set out in the 
EPUK/IAQM guidance. Therefore impacts from vehicle emissions during 
construction, operation and decommissioning have been scoped out (see Appendix 
6.1). 
ii. Odour Assessment 
6.4.6 
The Project will operate using natural gas.  There is no residual odour associated 
with the combustion of natural gas and as such, odour has not been considered 
further within this assessment. 
b) Consultation 
6.4.7 
The scope of the assessment has also been informed by ongoing consultation with 
statutory consultees throughout the design and assessment process, including 
CCS. 
6.4.8

c) Study Area 
6.4.9 
The study areas are defined separately for the construction and operational phases 
and for the different Project components. Impacts during decommissioning are 
considered to mirror construction impacts and the study area is as defined for the 
construction phase. 
6.4.10 The study area for the assessment of impacts during construction and 
decommissioning is defined on the following criteria detailed in the IAQM guidance: 
 
Human receptors within 350 m of potential dust sources and 50 m of the 
routes used by construction vehicles on the public highway; and  
 
Ecological receptors within 100 m of potential dust sources and 50 m of the 
routes used by construction vehicles on the public highway. 
6.4.11 The potential dust sources include areas of specific construction activities, the 
routes of the Gas Connection and Electrical Connection, and also roads within 500 
m of potential construction works (taken to be the junction of public roads and the 
Project Site). 
6.4.12 Outside of the study area defined above it is reasonable to conclude that 
construction impacts will be negligible.  
6.4.13 The study area for the assessment of impacts during the operational phase 
depends on the receptors being considered.  For ecological sites the EA guidance 
requires that air quality impacts are assessed at all special protection areas (SPAs), 
special areas of conservation (SACs), Ramsar sites (protected wetlands) within 10 
km of the site. While sites of special scientific interest (SSSIs) and local nature sites 
(ancient woods, local wildlife sites and national and local nature reserves) should 
only be assessed if within 2 km of the application site. 
6.4.14 There are no limits set for the assessment of human health, however, 
representative receptors have been selected from amongst the closest residential 
properties, and these have been discussed and agreed with CCS (see Appendix 
6.2). In addition a grid of receptors has been modelled extending 10 km from the 
Project Site boundary to assess maximum ground level concentrations.

d) Assessment of Stack Emission Effects 
6.4.15 The assessment of emissions from the Generating Equipment has been 
undertaken using the latest version of Atmospheric Dispersion Modelling System 
(ADMS) (V5.2.1.0), supplied by Cambridge Environmental Research Consultants 
Limited (CERC) (Ref. 6.24). ADMS is a modern dispersion model that has an 
extensive published validation history for use in the UK. This model has been 
extensively used throughout the UK to demonstrate regulatory compliance.

The stack height determination (see Appendix 6.2)
has considered a range of heights from 20 to 50 m 
increasing in 2 metre increments. A final minimum

ii. Meteorological Data 
6.4.17 Hourly sequential data from Cwm Level Park for the years 2012 to 2016 inclusive, 
provided by CCS, were used in this study. The station is situated approximately 
5 km to the south of the Project Site and is considered to be representative of 
meteorological conditions at the point of release.  The Cwm Level Park data was 
supplemented with data from the Mumbles Head meteorological station located 
approximately 15 km to the south of the Project Site. The Mumbles Head 
meteorological station is located on a headland on the far side of Swansea Bay to 
the Project Site and, as such, the Cwm Level Park meteorological data is 
considered to be much more representative of meteorological conditions on the 
Project Site.

6.4.18 A visual representation of the meteorological data used in the assessment is shown 
in the wind roses presented in Figure 6-1. 
iii. Terrain 
6.4.19 Terrain data has been included within the dispersion modelling.  A site specific 
terrain file has been generated for the site which accounts for the final site platform 
height, upon which the buildings and stack will be built, with detailed terrain data 
used for the area immediately off-site with more distant terrain data derived from 
the open OS terrain data off-site.  All terrain files have been generated based on 
the maximum sampling resolution allowable within the ADMS terrain file creator of 
64x64 points with the model run with a corresponding resolution. 
iv. Surface Roughness 
6.4.20 A surface roughness of 0.3 m was used to represent the conditions of the land 
surrounding the Project Site and fits the description of the landscape between the 
emission points and the closest sensitive receptors. A surface roughness value of 
0.5 m was used to represent conditions at the meteorological observation site 
which is in a suburban park. 
v. Building Downwash Effects 
6.4.21 When wind passes over buildings or other structures, turbulent eddies are formed 
in the downwind side of the building. Those eddies can cause a plume from a stack 
located within about five times the height of a nearby building or structure to be 
forced down to the ground much sooner than it would if a building or structure were 
not present. The net effect of such turbulence can be to entrain emissions and to 
reduce the effective release height of the emission. 
6.4.22 The effect can greatly increase the resulting near-by ground-level pollutant 
concentrations downstream of the building or structure.  This phenomenon is 
known as building downwash.  Where building heights are greater than about 30% 
- 40% of the stack height, downwash effects can be significant.  The buildings that 
make up the main structure of the Generating Equipment buildings have therefore 
been included within the dispersion model as detailed in Table 6-8 and illustrated in 
Figure 6-2, please note that these are indicative dimensions.  These buildings have 
the greatest influence on air flow across the Project Site and have the potential to 
generate turbulence which will effect stack dispersion. The buildings that have been 
included within the dispersion modelling are presented in Figure 6.2. 
6.4.23 The ADMS buildings effect module has been used to take account of building 
downwash effects as part of the modelling procedure.  The air inlet house 
(Building 1) has been selected as the main building to effect dispersion as it is the 
tallest building on the Project Site.

vi. Modelled Domain 
6.4.24 The dispersion model output is reported at specific receptors and as a nested grid 
of values. Three separate grid resolutions have been used: 
 
A 30 m resolution covering a 1.5 km radius around the Project Site, centred on 
the stack location, used for the stack height determination modelled at a height 
of 1.5 m. This has been based on ensuring that the grid spacing is 1.5 times 
the shortest stack height modelled (1.5 x 20 m = 30 m) and well below the 
resolution for the maximum stack height modelled (1.5 x 50 m = 75 m). 
 
A 50 m resolution grid covering all ecological areas within 10 km of the Project 
Site covering only ecological areas ensure that each ecological site had more 
than 2 receptors within it.  Additional receptors were manually added to ensure 
that each site was sufficiently represented. Modelled concentrations were at 0 
m. 
 
A 200 m resolution grid covering a 10 km radius around the Project Site, 
centred on the stack location, modelled at a height of 1.5 m and used for 
creating contour plots.  
6.4.25 Ground-level concentrations of the modelled pollutants relevant to human health 
have been predicted at discrete air quality sensitive receptors, detailed in Table 6-9 
The locations of the sensitive human receptors are displayed in Figure 6-3. The 
receptors have been selected to be representative of residential dwellings closest 
to the Project Site covering each compass direction. For sensitive human 
receptors, the flagpole height has been set at 1.5 m.

vii. Ecological Receptors 
6.4.26 The study area includes numerous nature conservation sites relevant to the air 
quality assessment. The list of designated sites, their habitat and background levels 
of nitrogen and sulphur deposition are presented within the Habitat Regulation 
Assessment (HRA) will accompany Chapter 8: Ecology and as such are not 
repeated within this chapter. 
viii. Oxides of nitrogen to nitrogen dioxide conversion 
6.4.27 Emissions of NOx from the stack will consist mainly of nitric oxide (NO) at the point 
of release. A number of mechanisms are known that result in an increasing 
proportion of the oxides of nitrogen being in the form of nitrogen dioxide with 
increasing distance from the point of release. 
6.4.28 The approach undertaken in the assessment of effects from continuously operating 
power plant is to use conversion rates recommended by the Environment Agency’s 
Air Quality Modelling and Assessment Unit (Ref. 6.25), which are: 
 
To assume 70% of oxides of nitrogen present as NO2 at ground level, plus the 
background NO2 concentration in the calculation of long-term annual mean 
calculations; and 
 
To assume 35% oxides of nitrogen present as NO2 at ground level, plus 
double the background NO2 concentration in the calculation of short-term 
hourly concentrations. 
ix. Acid and Nitrogen Deposition 
6.4.29 The deposition of nitrogen is modelled using a deposition velocity approach, where 
the surface flux of pollutants is modelled by multiplying the ground level 
concentration by a pollutant specific deposition velocity. The velocity used in the 
assessment of nitrogen deposition from NO2 was 1.5 mm/s for short vegetation and 
3.0 mm/s for tall vegetation.  
6.4.30 For the emissions from the Generating Equipment, only nitrogen deposition need 
be considered. Impacts due to emissions of sulphur dioxide and, by inference 
deposition of sulphur, have not been assessed as natural gas is an inherently low 
sulphur fuel. However, background levels of sulphur deposition are considered in 
the assessment of acidification. 
6.4.31 Relevant Critical Loads (acid and nitrogen) for each sensitive ecological area are 
detailed within the HRA which accompanies the Chapter 8: Ecology and as such 
are not repeated within this chapter. 
x. Specialised Model Treatments 
6.4.32 Emissions have been modelled such that they are not subject to dry and wet 
deposition or depleted through chemical reactions. The assumption of continuity of 
mass is likely to result in an overestimation of impacts at receptors.

xi. Realistic Worst Case Scenario for Assessment of Stack Emissions 
6.4.33 In accordance with PINS Advice Note 9 (Rochdale Envelope) (Ref. 6.26), the 
assessments presented in this PEIR are based on an assessment of the realistic 
'worst case' scenario. This allows flexibility for APL whilst ensuring that the likely 
significant environmental effects are identified and adequately assessed. The 
realistic worst case scenario is set out in each topic chapter for clarity and 
transparency. 
6.4.34 Taking the above into consideration, it has been determined that for all topic areas 
to be addressed in the EIA apart from socio-economics, a realistic ‘worst case’ 
scenario from the perspective of environmental effects will be one gas turbine 
generator unit. In addition, for all topic areas except air quality and ecology, the 
highest stack height (45 m) represents the 'worst case'. For air quality the minimum 
stack height (35 m) represent the 'worst case' due to lower dispersion from the 
stack. This in turn results in higher predicted ground-level concentrations at both 
human health and ecological receptors and predicted levels of nitrogen and acid 
deposition at ecological receptors locations.  
6.4.35 The Power Generation Plant is a peaking plant and will therefore only operate 
during periods of high power demand.  It is therefore anticipated that the 
Generating Equipment will normally operate for 1,500 hours per year, estimated as 
a rolling average over 5 years, but may operate for up to a maximum of 2,250 
hours per year as a realistic worst-case for any given year.  The maximum number 
of hours that the plant can operate will be set out in the site's Environmental Permit 
and this operating period cannot be exceeded. 
6.4.36 The assessment of impacts takes into account the anticipated maximum operating 
hours which the plant will operate under i.e. is based on a realistic worst case.  It is 
not possible to specify which hours of the year the plant will operate, the method by 
which this is taken into account in the dispersion modelling is dependent on the 
metric being assessed i.e. annual, daily, 8-hour or hourly mean concentrations. 
6.4.37 The impacts of the Project on short term (8 hours or less) pollutant concentrations 
were modelled with the OCGT assumed to be operating at full load continuously for 
a whole year. This is appropriate since the UK objectives and EU limit values for 
hourly NO2 and 8 hourly CO are based on the 18 highest and highest 
concentrations respectively over a year and, with 2,250 hours of operation, it is 
likely that operations will, at times, coincide with examples of the poorest dispersion 
conditions. 
6.4.38 In relation to long term (annual mean) concentrations assuming full load operation 
for the year will be unrealistic. Therefore, long term impacts were estimated by 
scaling the results for continuous full load operation by the likely operating time i.e. 
2,250 �maximum hours of operation�
8,760 �total hours in a year�
�  0.257 
Abergelli PEIR 2018 – CHAPTER 6: AIR QUALITY 
 
 
Prepared for:  Abergelli Power Limited 
 
AECOM 
6-24 
 
6.4.39 This approach is appropriate and is based on the assumption that the range of 
meteorological conditions under which the generators will operate will, over the 
2,250 hours, be statistically similar to those experienced over a year.  The annual 
stack contributions have been adjusted when presenting both the impacts at 
human health receptors close to the Project Site and for the ecological modelling 
when considering annual NOx concentrations and annual nitrogen/acid deposition.  
To ensure a level of conservativeness both the human health and ecological 
assessments have been calculated based on the maximum annual concentrations 
predicted at each location from the 5 years of meteorological data used in the 
modelling. 
6.4.40 The assessment of daily mean concentrations, applicable to the ecological 
assessment, falls between the cases for long and short-term concentrations. 
Nevertheless to ensure a conservative assessment daily mean concentrations are 
assessed on the basis of continuous operation. 
xii. Impacts During Start Up and Shut Down 
6.4.41 The start-up and shut down periods do not warrant specific assessment for the 
Project and impacts during these periods are robustly considered in the 
assessment by the assumed 2,250 hours of full load operation for the Plant, i.e. 
maximum annual operations rather than the anticipated normal operating hours of 
1,500 per year. 
6.4.42 The main element of the Generating Equipment is the Gas Turbine Generator. The 
OCGT is designed to meet short-term changes in electricity demand and is, 
therefore, specifically designed for rapid start up and shut down to benefit for these 
short-term changes in demand. Typical start up procedures will take around ten 
minutes to complete, and combustion fuel will not be introduced into the system 
until two to three minutes of the start-up have elapsed. During the next seven to 
eight minutes, fuel will be introduced into the system, first at a low rate and then at 
an increasing rate, up to full load operations. 
6.4.43 During start up, whilst the concentration of pollutants in the engine exhaust (at 
reference conditions) may be higher than under partial or full load operation during 
the first few minutes (e.g. minutes two to eight, at <75% load), the pollutant mass 
release rate will actually be lower than under full load operations due to the overall 
lower flow rates of exhaust gases. Note: the mass release rate (mg/s) is calculated 
as the concentration of pollutant (mg/Nm3) times the exhaust gas flow rate (Nm3/s). 
Furthermore, the concentration of pollutants decreases rapidly as start-up proceeds 
and, by around 8 minutes into start up, has decreased to levels equivalent to full 
load operations. 
6.4.44 In relation to air quality impacts, the mass release rate of pollutants is more 
important than the initial exhaust gas concentration of pollutants, since ground level 
impacts are proportional to the total mass release. This takes into consideration the 
competing effects of lower pollutant mass release rate during start up, but reduced 
plume buoyancy at low load (during early start up). 
Abergelli PEIR 2018 – CHAPTER 6: AIR QUALITY 
 
 
Prepared for:  Abergelli Power Limited 
 
AECOM 
6-25 
 
6.4.45 Impacts during start-up are likely to be imperceptibly different from those during full 
load operation.  Similar conclusions hold for impacts during the ramping down from 
full load operations, i.e. emission rates fall as the fuel flow rate is decreased but 
impacts of this decrease are countered by the effects of reduced plume buoyancy. 
xiii. Demolition and Construction Phase Fugitive Emissions of Particulate Matter 
6.4.46 Fugitive emissions (i.e. emissions which are not associated with a single fixed 
release point of airborne particulate matter) are readily produced through the action 
of abrasive forces on materials and therefore a wide range of demolition and 
construction activities have the potential to generate this type of emission (although 
not all relevant to this Project), including: 
 
Demolition work: 
 
Earthworks, including the handling, working and storage of materials; 
 
Construction activities; and 
 
The transfer of dust-making materials from the Project Site onto the local road 
network (Track-out). 
6.4.47 Particulate matter in the air is made up of particulates of a variety of sizes, and the 
concept of a ‘size fraction’ is used to describe particulates with sizes in a defined 
range. These definitions are based on the collection efficiency of specific sampling 
methods and each of the size fractions is especially associated with different types 
of impacts. In this assessment the term ‘dust’ is used to mean particulate matter in 
the size fraction 1 µm – 75 µm in diameter, as defined in BS 6069:1994 (Ref. 6.27). 
The size fraction called ‘PM10’ is composed of material with an aerodynamic 
diameter of less than 10 µm in diameter and overlaps with the size fraction for dust.  
6.4.48 The assessment has been undertaken in accordance with the methodology set out 
in the IAQM (Ref. 6.28) guidance. Dust impacts are considered in terms of the 
change in airborne concentration and the change in the rate of deposition of dust 
onto surfaces. The IAQM adopts a broad definition of dust that includes the 
potential for changes in airborne concentration, changes in deposition rates and the 
risk to human health and public amenity, when considering the significance of 
effects from emissions of fugitive particulate matter. In this assessment, specific 
reference is made to the impacts associated with specific size fractions (dust, 
PM10), before considering the overall effect on receptors. 
6.4.49 For the Project this will include the areas of specific construction associated with 
the Power Generation Plant and also the routes of the Access Road, Gas 
Connection and Electrical Connection. Outside of this study area it is reasonable to 
conclude that construction impacts will be Negligible. 
6.4.50 A qualitative assessment has been undertaken to assess the significance of any 
effects on sensitive receptors associated with the demolition and construction 
phase.  
6.4.51 For each activity the following steps are applied with respect to identifying the 
potential impacts, before coming to an overall conclusion about the significance of 
Abergelli PEIR 2018 – CHAPTER 6: AIR QUALITY 
 
 
Prepared for:  Abergelli Power Limited 
 
AECOM 
6-26 
 
the effects predicted. The approach to the assessment involves the following 
process: 
 
Identify the nature, duration and the location of activities being carried out;  
 
Establish the risk of significant effects occurring as a result of these activities;  
 
Review the proposed or embedded mitigation against good site practice; 
 
Identify additional mitigation measures, if necessary, to reduce the risk of a 
significant adverse effect occurring at receptors; and  
 
Summarise the overall effect of the works with respect to fugitive emissions of 
particulate matter and then report the significance of the effects.  
6.4.52 The emphasis of the regulation and control of construction dust should be the 
adoption of good working practices as standard. Good practice is a process that is 
informed by the assessment, which seeks to avoid the potential for adverse effects. 
This approach assumes that this environmental management, beyond those 
mitigation measures inherent in the proposed design, will be implemented during 
works to ensure potential significant adverse effects do not occur.  
6.4.53 Examples of accepted good site practice include the IAQM guidance. It has been 
assumed that good site practice will be implemented on-site when assessing 
potential dust impacts. An outline Construction Environmental Management Plan 
(CEMP) has been prepared for the Project (Appendix 3.1) and includes measures 
comprising good site practice to avoid or reduce the potential for dust impacts. 
e) Sensitivity 
i. 
Construction Dust 
6.4.54 According to the IAQM, an assessment will normally be required where there are:  
 
Human receptors within 350 m of potential dust sources and 50 m of the 
routes used by construction vehicles on the public highway, up to 500 m from 
the Project Site entrance; and 
 
Ecological receptors within 50 m of potential dust sources and 50 m of the 
routes used by construction vehicles on the public highway, up to 500 m from 
the Project Site entrance.  
6.4.55 The nature of particulate impact for demolition and construction works varies 
between different types of receptors based on their sensitivity, as summarised in 
Table 6-10 below. Professional judgement is required when assessing sensitivities 
as some hi-technology industries and horticultural activities are particularly dust 
sensitive.

6.4.56 Once the sensitivity of the Receptors within the assessment areas are determined 
the IAQM methodology requires that the number of sensitive receptors, distance of

be considered.  The IAQM Sensitivity Criteria are presented in Table 6-11 to Table

6.4.59 The level of risk is defined based on the relative sensitivity of the area vs the 
magnitude of the identified impact from the phase of construction works.  This is 
determined based on the matrix set out in Table 6-16.

6.4.60 For effects on amenity (including those associated with dust), the aim is to bring 
forward a demolition  and construction phase, including mitigation measures if 
necessary, that avoids the potential for complaints to be generated as a result of 
the Project. 
6.4.61 Experience in the UK is that good site practice is capable of mitigating the impact of 
fugitive emissions of particulate matter effectively, so that in all but the most 
exceptional circumstances, effects at sensitive receptors can be controlled to 
ensure that effects are of negligible or minor adverse significance (i.e. ‘not 
significant’) (see Table 6-17). This process can be managed through the 
implementation of the CEMP (Appendix 3.1). 
6.4.62 The scale of the risk of adverse effects occurring due to each type of demolition or 
construction activity, with mitigation in place is described using the terms ‘high’, 
‘medium’ and ‘low’ risk. The basis for the choice of description is set out for each 
activity, comprising demolition, earthworks, construction and track-out, and is 
consistent with the IAQM’s Guidance.  
Table 6-17: Descriptors Applied to the Predicted Effects of Fugitive Emissions of Particulate Matter 
Risk level 
Description 
High 
A significant effect that is likely to be a material 
consideration in its own right. 
Medium 
A significant effect that may be a material consideration in 
combination with other significant effects, but is unlikely to 
be a material consideration in its own right. 
Low 
An effect that is not significant but that may be of local 
concern. 
Negligible 
An effect that is not significant change. 
 
6.4.63 Construction dust effects generally occur when high risk dust generating activities 
coincide with adverse meteorological conditions. Therefore, even without 
mitigation, any impact would be limited to events that are infrequent and short-term 
in nature.

6.4.64 A significant impact can be anticipated should the assessment conclude 
unmitigated impacts are of medium or high risk, however, only if suitable mitigation 
measures not be applied to control dust emissions with even sites where only a low 
risk of impacts requiring  mitigation to ensure that impacts are not significant.  Once 
appropriate dust controls are applied then the residual impacts of construction dust 
should be not significant.  On this the IAQM states, “Once the risk of dust impacts 
has been determined and the appropriate dust mitigation measures identified the 
final step is to determine whether there are significant effects arising from the 
construction phase of a proposed development. For almost all construction activity, 
the aim should be to prevent significant effects on receptors through the use of 
effective mitigation. Experience shows that this is normally possible. Hence the 
residual effect will normally be ‘not significant’.”  
ii. Operational Impacts 
Human Health Receptors 
6.4.65 With regard to stack emissions, the change in pollutant concentrations has been 
described at receptors that are representative of exposure to impacts on local air 
quality within the study area. For consideration of a change an assessment criteria 
has been derived from the IAQM/EPUK (Ref. 6.24) significance criteria guidance. 
These are presented in Table 6-18 and Table 6-19 respectively.

6.4.66 The EA’s Risk Assessment guidance (Ref. 6.29) defines a development as having 
an insignificant impact where: 
 
Predicted Contributions (PC) <1% of the Environmental Standard or EAL, or 
the Predicted Environmental Concentrations (PEC) <70% of the Environmental 
Standard or EAL for long term releases; 
 
PC <10% of the Environmental Standard or EAL, or the PEC is less than 20% 
of the Environmental Standard minus twice the long term background 
concentration, for short term releases. 
6.4.67 Impacts of the proposed Project have been assessed relative to both the adapted 
IAQM/EPUK criteria and EA screening criteria.  
Ecological Receptors  
6.4.68 For European sites (SPA, SAC or Ramsar sites) an assessment is made as to 
whether the installation is “likely to have a significant effect”, and whether this could 
lead to an “adverse effect on site integrity”. 
6.4.69 For Sites of Special Scientific Interest (SSSIs) the assessment needs to determine 
whether the installation is “likely to damage” the Project Site. 
6.4.70 The EA’s Risk Assessment guidance (Ref. 6.9) screening criteria for significance of 
the emission have been applied to the outcome of the dispersion modelling for both 
European and SSSIs. The predicted PCs have been compared with the appropriate 
Critical Level to determine the significance of the pollutant emission. 
6.4.71 The total pollutant emission is defined in the EA’s Risk Assessment guidance as 
being insignificant where: 
 
PC <1% of the Critical Level, or the PEC <70% of Critical Level for long term 
releases; 
 
PC <10% of the Critical Level for short term releases. 
6.4.72 For all other nature conservation sites, i.e. LNRs, NNRs, SINCs and ancient 
woodlands, the assessment needs to determine whether the installation will result 
in “significant pollution” i.e. where Critical Levels are exceeded. Therefore if the 
long and short term PC is less than 100% of the relevant Critical Level, it is 
considered to be not significant. 
6.4.73 The assessment against Critical Loads has been carried out in accordance with 
AQTAG06 ‘Technical guidance on detailed modelling approach for an appropriate 
assessment for emissions to air’ (Ref. 6.29).  However, it should be noted that this 
does not provide definitive advice on interpreting the likely effects on different 
habitats of changes in air quality. 
6.4.74 As with Critical Levels where process contributions of nitrogen and acid are less 
than 1% of the Critical Load impacts can be considered to be insignificant.  Should 
PCs be greater than 1% of the critical load then there is the potential for the effects 
Abergelli PEIR 2018 – CHAPTER 6: AIR QUALITY 
 
 
Prepared for:  Abergelli Power Limited 
 
AECOM 
6-35 
 
to be significant, depending upon the context, i.e. sensitivity of the habitat to 
acid/nitrogen or other factors such as buffering capacity of the local soils. 
6.5 
Baseline Environment 
a) CCS Air Quality Monitoring and Reporting 
6.5.1 
A review of existing baseline air quality has been undertaken using information 
presented within the CCS Progress Report 2016 (Ref. 6.21), information published 
on an official CCS Air Quality website and Defra website. 
6.5.2 
There are a number of Continuous Monitoring Stations (CMS) in the administrative 
area of CCS. A summary of the monitoring stations and last five years of monitoring 
data from each, are presented in Table 6-20 to Table 6-23.

Additionally CCS managed a network of diffusion tube monitoring sites focused on 
roadside locations mainly at busy junctions and along narrow and congested roads. 
The Project Site is at a rural location and therefore monitoring data from the NO2 
diffusion tube network are not considered relevant to inform the air quality baseline 
at the Project Site. 
b) Defra Mapped Background Data 
6.5.4 
A large number of small sources of air pollutants exist, which individually may not 
be significant, but collectively, over a large area, need to be considered in the 
modelling process. Pollutant emissions from these sources contribute to 
background air quality, which when added to modelled emissions allow estimates of 
total ambient pollutant concentrations to be made.   
6.5.5 
Defra has produced maps of background pollutant concentrations covering the 
whole of the UK for use by local authorities and consultants in the completion of 
LAQM reports and Air Quality Assessments where local background monitoring is 
unavailable or inappropriate for use.  The current maps are based on a background 
year of 2015 and provide background pollutant concentrations for NO2, PM10 and 
PM2.5 for each 1 km grid square within the UK for all years between 2015 and 2030.  
Defra also provides historic mapped estimates from 2001 for CO.  While the Defra 
mapped backgrounds have not been updated this data is still considered 
appropriate to use as it will give an indication of the background concentrations in 
the study area, though it is anticipated that these will be conservative. The mapped 
Defra NO2, PM10 and PM2.5 concentrations at the Project Site are presented in 
Table 6-24 for 2016.

Note: The DEFRA background concentrations were downloaded in November 2017 from the 2015 reference year 
background maps. 
6.5.7 
The available CCS monitoring data are likely to overestimate pollutant 
concentrations in the study area since the area is predominantly rural in 
comparison to the more urban nature of Cwm Level Park. The comparison shows 
that the Defra mapped values are slightly lower than the monitored background 
concentration at Cwm Level Park. However, given the rural nature of the Project 
Site it is not considered appropriate to use the Cwm Level Park monitoring to 
represent background concentrations to inform the wider study, especially when 
considering Sensitive Receptors which are located in rural areas.  Background NO2 
concentrations in for this study will, therefore, be based on the 2016 mapped Defra 
estimates for the relevant grid square in which the receptor is located. The use of 
the Defra mapped background data to represent air quality at each modelled 
receptor location was agreed as part of the scoping agreement with CCS, as set 
out in Appendix 6.1. 
6.5.8 
CCS does not undertake any background monitoring for PM10 or PM2.5.  As such, 
background concentrations will be established based on Defra mapped background 
concentrations for 2016. 
6.6 
Embedded Mitigation 
6.6.1 
As detailed in Chapter 3: Project and Site Description, a number of embedded 
mitigation measures have been identified through the iterative EIA process and 
have been incorporated into the design and construction planning of the Project.   
6.6.2 
As these mitigation measures have been embedded into the design, are legal 
requirements or are standard practices that will be implemented, the assessment of 
likely significant effects assumes that they are in place. 
6.7 
Assessment of Effects 
a) 
Construction Phase 
i. 
Generation Plant Site  
6.7.1 
The sensitivity of the human receptors to the Generation Plant Site is classed as 
low in terms of both nuisance and health impacts as the closest receptors (Abergelli 
Farmhouse and Maes-eglwys) are over 20 m from activities on-site. In relation to 
ecology the sensitivity is classed as low as the only ecological sites close to dust 
generating activities, Lletty Morfil SINC and an area of Ancient Woodland, are 
locally designated and not considered to be sensitive to dust deposition. PM10 
concentrations are at low likelihood of exceedences of the air quality objective in 
Abergelli PEIR 2018 – CHAPTER 6: AIR QUALITY 
 
 
Prepared for:  Abergelli Power Limited 
 
AECOM 
6-38 
 
the area of construction activities are mainly associated with larger particles rather 
than fine particles like PM10. Existing PM10 concentrations are well below the 
relevant objective and are, therefore, unlikely to be exceeded due to the 
construction of the Generation Plant Site.  
6.7.2 
There are no existing buildings on the Project Site and, as such, there are no 
demolition activities associated with the construction of the Power Generation 
Plant. The dust emission potential for construction of the Power Generation Plant is 
assessed as being large during earthworks due to the scale of the Power 
Generation Plant Site and the construction of a new Access Road from the 
Substation to the Generating Equipment Site. Construction emissions are classed 
as small due to the internal area of the buildings on-site, <25,000 m3, and the 
expectation that a number of the buildings/structures will be prefabricated. 
Emissions from trackout have a large dust magnitude due to the number of vehicles 
which may be operating at the Power Generation Plant Site. 
6.7.3 
Table 6-26 sets out the assessment of dust emission class from demolition 
activities, earthworks, construction and trackout from the Access Road (to the west 
from the B4489).

Using the IAQM construction dust assessment criteria the dust emission magnitude is combined with the distance to and 
sensitivity of the nearest receptors to assess the risk of effects associated with the construction phase of the Power 
Generation Plant with no mitigation.  
6.7.4 
Table 6-26 shows the risk of effects with no mitigation is negligible or low in terms 
of human health, nuisance and ecological impacts. Impacts are, therefore, 
anticipated to be not significant, given the low risk identified and once the 
imbedded mitigation already proposed, as set out in the Outline CEMP, is taken into 
account. 
ii. Gas Connection 
6.7.5 
The sensitivity of the human receptors to the Gas Connection is classed as low in 
terms of both nuisance and health impacts as the closest receptors (Abergelli 
Farmhouse and Maes-eglwys) are over 20 m from activities on-site. In relation to 
ecology the sensitivity is classed as low as the only ecological sites close to dust 
generating activities, Lletty Morfil SINC and an area of Ancient Woodland, are 
locally designated and not considered to be sensitive to dust deposition.  
Abergelli PEIR 2018 – CHAPTER 6: AIR QUALITY 
 
 
Prepared for:  Abergelli Power Limited 
 
AECOM 
6-39 
 
6.7.6 
The dust emission potential for construction of the Gas Connection is assessed as 
being large during earthworks due to the size of the corridor affected, which is 
approximately 1,400 m long and a maximum of 50 m wide, the number of earth 
moving machines that may be required and the volume of material that will be 
excavated to form the trench into which the gas pipe will be laid. Construction 
emissions are classed as small which is considered to be conservative given the 
prefabricated nature of installing the gas pipe. Emissions from trackout have a large 
dust potential due to the number of vehicles operating.  There is no demolition 
associated with this phase of the works. 
6.7.7 
Table 6-27 sets out the assessment of dust emission class from demolition 
activities, earthworks, construction and trackout as a function of the works 
associated with the Gas Connection.

Using the IAQM construction dust assessment criteria the dust emission magnitude 
is combined with the distance to and sensitivity of the nearest receptors to assess 
the risk of effects associated with the construction phase of the Gas Connection 
with no mitigation.  
6.7.9 
Table 6-27 shows the risk of effects with no mitigation is Negligible or Low in terms 
of human health, nuisance and ecological impacts.  Impacts are, therefore, 
anticipated to be not significant, given the low risk identified and once the 
imbedded mitigation already proposed, as set out in the Outline CEMP, is taken into 
account. 
iii. Electrical Connection 
6.7.10 The sensitivity of the human receptors to the Electrical Connection is classed as 
low in terms of both nuisance and health impacts as the closest receptors (Abergelli 
Farmhouse and Maes-eglwys) are over 20 m from activities on-site. In relation to 
ecology the sensitivity is classed as low as the only ecological sites close to dust 
generating activities, Lletty Morfil SINC and an area of Ancient Woodland, are 
locally designated and not considered to be sensitive to dust deposition.  
6.7.11 The dust emission potential for construction of the Electrical Connection is 
assessed as being small during earthworks and construction considering that the 
earthworks are confined to small area and construction emissions will be 
moderated by the largely prefabricated nature of the installation. Emissions from 
Abergelli PEIR 2018 – CHAPTER 6: AIR QUALITY 
 
 
Prepared for:  Abergelli Power Limited 
 
AECOM 
6-40 
 
trackout have a small dust potential due to the number of vehicles operating and 
the fact there will be minimal amount of excavation/trenching needed. There is no 
demolition associated with this phase of the works.  
6.7.12 Table 6-28 sets out the assessment of dust emission class from demolition 
activities, earthworks, construction and trackout as a function of the works 
associated with the Electrical Connection.

6.7.13 Using the IAQM construction dust assessment criteria the dust emission magnitude 
is combined with the distance to and sensitivity of the nearest receptors to assess 
the risk of effects associated with the construction phase of the Electrical 
Connection with no mitigation. 
6.7.14 Table 6-28 shows the risk of effects with no mitigation is Negligible in terms of 
human health, nuisance and ecological impacts. Impacts are therefore anticipated 
to be not significant. 
b) Operational Phase 
i. 
Stack Height Determination 
6.7.15 Stack height sensitivity testing was undertaken using meteorological data from 
2012 to 2016 with the maximum ground-level concentrations predicted across a 
grid of receptors with a model resolution of 30 m.  
6.7.16 Dispersion model runs were undertaken for various stack heights between 20 m 
and 50 m with the stack height models in 2 m incremental heights. The modelling 
demonstrated no significant improvement in ground-level concentrations of NO2 
with a stack height greater than 34 m.  As such a minimum stack height of 35 m 
has been selected and has been used in all subsequent modelling.  Further details 
of the stack height determination process are presented in Appendix 6.2. 
ii. Impacts on Human Health 
6.7.17 In this section, the modelled contributions of the Power Generation Plant are 
presented as maximum ground-level concentrations of NO2 and CO at a height of 
1.5 m and at the closest sensitive receptors included within the dispersion 
modelling also predicted at a height of 1.5 m.

presented as the 99.79th percentile of hourly mean concentrations. This represents 
the 19th highest hourly concentration in the year which takes into account the 18 
exceedances of the standard allowed under EU and UK regulations. 
6.7.19 Furthermore, the model results are presented as the contribution of the Generating 
Equipment Plant on its own, termed the Process Contribution (PC), and in 
combination with background concentrations, termed the Predicted Environment 
Concentration (PEC). All process contributions are modelled with the Generating 
Equipment operating at full load limited to the maximum annual operations of 2,250 
hours.  
6.7.20 Table 6-29 presents the maximum predicted impacts anywhere across the grid of 
modelled receptor locations taken over the five meteorological years tested (2012 
to 2016) for a stack height of 35 m (see Figure 6.3 for illustrated Receptor 
Location). The data are shown as predicted PC and total PEC (i.e. PC in addition to 
Defra mapped background concentrations) for comparison against the relevant 
AQS objective.

6.7.21 The results in Table 6-29 show that even based on the maximum predicted 
concentrations across the grid of receptors PCs are below 0.2 µg/m3 and as such 
can be screened out as Negligible in accordance with the adapted IAQM/EPUK 
planning guidance and the EA screening criteria.  Despite the PC being well below 
1% of the AQS objective Table 6-29 also presents the PEC to illustrated total 
annual mean NO2 concentrations and to show that they are also well below the 
AQS objective even once the contributions from the Generating Equipment are

6.7.25 The results in Table 6-31 show that even based on the maximum predicted 
concentrations across the grid of receptors PCs are well below 10% of the AQS 
objective of 10,000 µg/m3 and, as such, can be screened out as Negligible in 
accordance with the adapted IAQM/EPUK planning guidance and the EA screening 
criteria.  Despite the PC being well below 10% of the AQS objective, Table 6-31 
also presents the PEC to illustrated total PECs are also well below the AQS 
objective even once the contributions from the Power Generation Plant are 
included. 
6.7.26 Contour plots of the process contribution of annual mean NO2, 99.78th percentile 
hourly NO2 and the 8 hour rolling CO are provided in Figure 6-4 to Figure 6-6. The 
annual and 99.78th percentile contour plots have been prepared using 2015 
meteorological data from Cwm Level Park as this gave the highest maximum 
ground-level concentrations, while the 8 hour rolling CO contour plot has been 
prepared using meteorological data from 2012. 
6.7.27 Annual mean and 99.79th Percentile NO2 impacts are concentrated to the north-
east of the stack reflecting the prevailing south-westerly winds in all years, whereas 
the rolling eight hour mean CO impacts are concentrated to the north stack.  
6.7.28 The maximum impacts of the Project occur away from major roads and urban 
areas. It is therefore unlikely that there will be cumulative impacts at either roadside 
location. Likewise, impacts are located to the north east and away from the closest 
AQMA which is located approximately 5 km away to the south of the Project Site in 
central Swansea.  As such, no impacts are anticipated in the nearest AQMA.  
6.7.29 In summary, the magnitude of the impacts on pollutant concentrations are 
considered to be negligible for all pollutant and averaging periods considered within 
the dispersion modelling. As such, impacts on air quality as a result of the Project 
are therefore not considered to be significant.

iii. Impacts on Ecosystems 
6.7.30 The HRA has concluded that no likely significant effects are predicted to occur from 
the Project.  
c) 
Decommissioning 
6.7.31 The sensitivity of the human receptors to the Power Generation Plant is classed as 
low in terms of both nuisance and health impacts as the closest receptors (Abergelli 
Farmhouse and Maes-eglwys) are over 20 m from activities on-site. In relation to 
ecology the sensitivity is classed as low as the only ecological sites close to dust 
generating activities, Lletty Morfil SINC and an area of Ancient Woodland, are 
locally designated and not considered to be sensitive to dust deposition. It should 
be noted that it is assumed that no additional receptors are introduced within the 
assessment area, or new sensitive ecological sites declared prior to the site being 
decommissioned.   
6.7.32 The decommissioning phase will involve the demolition of the Generating 
Equipment and removal or hardstanding and restoration of the site to its pre-
development condition.  There is no construction associated with the restoration 
phase.  The emission potential for demolition of the Power Generation Plant is 
assessed as being large small due to the internal area of the buildings on-site, 
<25,000 m3, and the expectation that a number of the buildings/structures will be 
prefabricated and of metal construction rather than cement.  Emission during 
earthworks are anticipated to be large due to the size of the Power Generation 
Plant site and the need to restore the Access Road from the Substation to the 
Generating Equipment Site, however, it is anticipated that the Gas Connection will 
be closed off but not extracted and that there will be minimal works required to 
remove the electrical connection. Trackout is anticipated to have a large magnitude 
due to the number of vehicles anticipated to be operating at the Power Generation 
Plant Site.   
6.7.33 Table 6-32 sets out the assessment of dust emission class from demolition 
activities, earthworks, construction and trackout from the Access Road (to the west 
from the B4489).

6.7.34 Using the IAQM construction dust assessment criteria the dust emission magnitude 
is combined with the distance to and sensitivity of the nearest existing 
receptors/designated ecological sites to assess the risk of effects associated with 
the restoration phase of the Power Generation Plant with no mitigation. Table 6-32 
shows the risk of effects with no mitigation is Negligible or Low in terms of human 
health, nuisance and ecological impacts. Impacts are, therefore, anticipated to be 
not significant, given the low risk identified and once the imbedded mitigation 
already proposed, as set out in the CEMP, is taken into account. 
6.8 
Mitigation and Monitoring 
6.8.1 
As a general rule, additional mitigation measures have been proposed where a 
significant effect is predicted to occur.  Embedded mitigation measures, which have 
been incorporated within the design of the Project or are standard practice 
measures that have been committed to are summarised in Chapter 3: Project and 
Site Description. 
a) Construction/Decommissioning 
6.8.2 
The construction dust assessment concluded that nuisance dust, human health 
impacts and ecological impacts will be negligible to low.  As such no additional 
mitigation or monitoring is proposed. 
b) Operation 
6.8.3 
The air quality assessment has demonstrated that air quality impacts as a result of 
the Project are negligible.  As such, no additional mitigation is proposed.  Emissions 
from the stack will be monitored by a Continuous Emission Monitoring System 
(CEMS) which will be required to obtain an Environmental Permit to operate. 
6.9 
Residual Effects 
6.9.1 
The following tables present a summary of the Air Quality assessment. They 
identify the receptor/s likely to be impacted, the level of effect and, where the effect 
is deemed to be significant, the tables include the mitigation proposed and the 
resulting residual effect.

a) Project ‘“in combination” Effects 
6.9.2 
The combined impacts from the Power Generation Plant, Gas Connection and 
Electrical Connection upon receptors to air quality are limited to those assets listed 
in Table 6-33 and Table 6-34, and as such no significant impacts are predicted from 
the Project.  
6.10 
Cumulative and In-Combination Effects 
a) Construction/Decommissioning 
6.10.1 There are no other permitted or proposed developments within the study area 
which may result in any air quality impacts during construction.  As such, no 
cumulative construction effects with other Project are anticipated. 
b) Operation 
6.10.2 There are no other permitted or proposed developments within the study area that 
are not currently in operation.  As such, all other large combustion sources are 
considered to be accounted for within the background selected for this project.  The 
results have illustrated the PECs for the Generating Equipment are all within the 
relevant AQS objectives and, as such, in combination impacts are considered to be 
not significant.
