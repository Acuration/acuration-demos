INTRODUCTION 
 
1.1 
APL is promoting an Open Cycle Gas Turbine (OCGT) gas fired power 
station located on open agricultural land approximately 2 km north of 
Junction 46 on the M4, approximately 3 km to the north of the city of 
Swansea, approximately 1 km southeast of Felindre and 1.4 km north of 
Llangyfelach. 
1.2 
The Project constitutes a Nationally Significant Infrastructure Project 
(NSIP) by virtue of section 14(1)(a) and section 15 of the Planning Act 
2008 (PA 2008) which includes within the definition of an NSIP any 
onshore generating station in England or Wales of 50 MWe capacity or 
more. Under section 31 PA 2008 a Development Consent Order (DCO) 
is required to develop an NSIP. Under section 37 PA 2008 this can only 
be granted if an application is made for it to the Secretary of State (SoS) 
(the "DCO Application"). 
1.3 
The Project would comprise an Open Cycle Gas Turbine (OCGT) 
peaking power generating station, fuelled by natural gas and capable of 
providing a rated electrical output of up to 299 Megawatts (MW) (the 
"Power Generation Plant").   
1.4 
The Power Generation Plant comprises: 
1.4.1 
Generating Equipment including one Gas Turbine Generator with 
one exhaust gas flue stack and Balance of Plant (BOP) (together 
referred to as the "Generating Equipment") which are located 
within the "Generating Equipment Site"; 
1.4.2 
An Access Road to the Project Site from the B4489 which lies to 
the west, formed by upgrading an existing access road between 
the B4489 junction and the Swansea North Substation (the 
"Substation") and constructing a new section of access road 
from the Substation to the Generating Equipment Site; and 
1.4.3 
A temporary construction compound for the storage of materials, 
plant and equipment as well as containing site accommodation 
and welfare facilities, temporary car parking and temporary 
fencing (the "Laydown Area"). A small area within the Laydown 
Area will be retained permanently (the 
"Maintenance 
Compound"). 
1.4.4 
Ecological Mitigation Area – area for ecological enhancement 
within the Project Site Boundary. 
1.4.5 
Permanent parking and drainage to include: a site foul, oily water 
and surface water drainage system. 
1.5 
A full description of the Project is provided in Chapter 3 of the 
Environmental Statement accompanying the DCO Application (document 
reference 6.1).

1.6 
In order to operate, the Project also requires a gas connection and an 
electrical connection.  For development in Wales under 350MW, the PA 
2008 does not allow the inclusion of 'associated development' within the 
meaning of section 115 of the PA 2008.  In the context of the Project 
therefore, development consent for the gas connection and the electrical 
connection is not sought by APL in the DCO Application.   Separate 
permission for the gas connection and electrical connection will be sought 
under the Town and Country Planning Act 1990 or utilising permitted 
development rights.  APL is seeking powers of compulsory acquisition 
over the land required to deliver the entire Project as part of the DCO 
Application. 
1.7 
Section 37 of the PA 2008 governs the content of an application for a 
DCO, including the requirements for the necessary accompanying 
documents specified in the Infrastructure Planning (Applications: 
Prescribed 
Forms 
and 
Procedure) 
Regulations 
2009 
("APFP 
Regulations").  
1.8 
Regulations 5 and 6 of the APFP Regulations provide the statutory 
requirements for what must accompany a development consent 
application. Guidance issued by the Department for Communities and 
Local Government1, requires that: 
'Where the proposed development will also require 
other consents, licences, permits, etc, to enable it to be 
constructed and / or operational, and for which the [SoS] 
is not the authorising body, then the applicant must list 
and briefly describe these in … the application. 
Reference should be given to any that have already 
been applied for, and a copy enclosed of any that the 
applicant may already be in the possession of.' 
1.9 
This document comprises part of the application documents and provides 
details of consents required in addition to those being requested as part 
of the DCO.
