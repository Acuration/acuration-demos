EXECUTIVE SUMMARY 
 
The archaeological baseline conditions of the Millbrook Power Project Site, 
Bedfordshire have been assessed.  The details of the Project are described in 
Chapter 3of the ES.   
 
The available archaeological, historic, and topographic information indicates 
that the Project Site contains no designated heritage assets. Archaeological 
evaluation has been undertaken in the west of the Project Site and has 
recorded evidence of possible prehistoric settlement activity and evidence for 
an enclosed Iron Age/Roman settlement either side of a palaeochannel. 
Undated cropmarks of possible archaeological origins are recorded on the 
Project Site from aerial photography.  
 
The northern area of the Project Site within Rookery Pit where the Power 
Generation Plant will be located has been subject to 20th century clay 
extraction which will have removed all archaeological remains within its 
footprint. On this basis it is considered that it is the Gas and Electrical 
Connection elements of the Project outside of Rookery South Pit which may 
have an archaeological impact.  
 
A programme of archaeological mitigation will be undertaken on the Gas 
Connection and Electrical Connection after the Development Consent Order 
(DCO) has been made as agreed with the Central Bedfordshire Council 
Archaeological Officer during consultations.  Following the DCO being made, a 
written scheme of investigation (WSI) will be produced and submitted to the 
CBC Archaeological Officer.  This document will define the scope of works and 
the methods of excavation and recording that will be implemented.   
 
The mitigation will comprise of an archaeological strip, map and sample 
operation during the construction of both the Gas and Electrical Connections.  
This will comprise the areas required for excavation associated with the 
trenches required to install the Pipeline and underground cables as well as the 
AGI 
and 
their 
associated 
construction 
easements 
being 
stripped 
archaeologically.  During this process any archaeological features exposed will 
be hand excavated archaeologically and recorded according to a sampling 
strategy set out within the WSI and agreed with the CBC Archaeological 
Officer.  Following completion of the fieldwork, the findings will be assessed,

analysed and published in full in an appropriate academic journal.  These works 
will be undertaken in accordance with the CIfA Standards and Guidance for 
Excavation and/or Standards and Guidance for an Archaeological Watching 
Brief (CIfA 2014).

INTRODUCTION AND SCOPE OF STUDY 
 
1.1 
This desk-based assessment has been prepared by Lorraine Mayo of CgMs 
Consulting, on behalf of Peter Brett Associates LLP.  
 
1.2 
The aims of the report is to establish the archaeological baseline conditions of 
the Project Site and within a Study Area extending to a 1 km radius from it, 
so as to inform the assessment of the potential archaeological impacts as 
presented in Chapter 13 of the ES. 
 
1.3 
The subject of this assessment is the Millbrook Power Project Site (Fig. 1). 
The Project Site is centred at grid reference 501373, 240734 and is bounded 
to the north by disused Clay Pits and residential development at 
Stewartby/Wootton Pillinge, to the east by fields, to the south by fields and 
the village of Millbrook, to the south west by a Vehicle Proving Ground, 
Pillinge Farm South and a Country Park (Fig. 1).  
 
1.4 
In accordance with government planning policy (NPS EN1, 2, 4 & 5 & NPPF), 
this desk-based assessment has been undertaken to 
establish the 
presence/absence of designated and undesignated assets, to consider the 
archaeological potential of the Project Site and to assess any impacts from 
the Project.  
 
1.5 
The desk based assessment has been undertaken in accordance with the CIfA 
Standards and Guidance for Heritage Desk Based Assessment (2014).  The 
assessment comprises an examination of evidence in the Bedfordshire Historic 
Environment Record and the Bedford Borough Council Historic Environment 
Record (HER), the Bedfordshire County Archives, and various online sources 
such as British History on line and the National Heritage List of England.  
 
1.6 
Data gathering to inform this desk-based assessment has established that no 
Scheduled Monuments, Registered Parks & Gardens or Registered Battlefields 
lie on or in close proximity to the Project Site. However there are several 
undesignated heritage assets recorded within the Project Site. Two Scheduled 
Monuments (Houghton House and Ampthill Castle) lie to the south east of the 
Project Site. The Ampthill Park Registered Park and Garden lies immediately 
adjacent to the Project Site’s south-eastern boundary.

The study therefore provides an assessment of the archaeological assets and 
as yet unrecorded potential archaeological assets on the Project Site and 
enables relevant parties to assess the impacts on heritage/archaeological 
assets, and to consider the need for design, engineering or other 
archaeological mitigation measures.

PLANNING BACKGROUND AND DEVELOPMENT PLAN FRAMEWORK 
 
2.1 
In March 2012, the government published the National Planning Policy Framework 
(NPPF). More recently (March 2014) government had published Planning Practice 
Guidance (PPG) online. 
 
2.2 
Section 12 of the NPPF, entitled Conserving and enhancing the historic 
environment provides guidance for planning authorities, property owners, 
developers and others on the conservation and investigation of heritage assets. 
Overall, the objectives of Section 12 of the NPPF can be summarised as seeking 
the: 
 
 
Delivery of sustainable development; 
 
Understanding the wider social, cultural, economic and environmental 
benefits brought by the conservation of the historic environment;  
 
Conservation of England's heritage assets in a manner appropriate to their 
significance; and 
 
Recognition of the contribution that heritage assets make to our 
understanding of the past.  
 
2.2.1 Section 12 of the NPPF recognises that intelligently managed change may 
sometimes be necessary if heritage assets are to be maintained for the long term.  
Paragraph 128 states that planning decisions should be based on the significance 
of the heritage asset, and that level of detail supplied by an applicant should be 
proportionate to the importance of the asset and should be no more than 
sufficient to review the potential impact of the proposal upon the significance of 
that asset. 
 
2.2.2 Heritage Assets are defined in Annex 2 of the NPPF as: a building, monument, 
site, place, area or landscape positively identified as having a degree of 
significance meriting consideration in planning decisions. They include designated 
heritage assets (as defined in the NPPF) and assets identified by the local 
planning authority during the process of decision-making or through the plan-
making process.  
 
2.2.3 Annex 2 also defines Archaeological Interest as a heritage asset which holds or 
potentially could hold, evidence of past human activity worthy of expert 
investigation at some point. Heritage assets with archaeological interest are the 
Archaeological Desk-Based Assessment

LM/17657 
primary source of evidence about the substance and evolution of places, and of 
the people and cultures that made them. 
 
2.2.4 A Designated Heritage Asset comprises a: World Heritage Site, Scheduled 
Monument, Listed Building, Protected Wreck Site, Registered Park and Garden, 
Registered Battlefield or Conservation Area.  
 
2.2.5 Significance is defined as: The value of a heritage asset to this and future 
generations because of its heritage interest. This interest may be archaeological, 
architectural, artistic or historic. Significance derives not only from a heritage 
asset’s physical presence, but also from its setting. 
 
2.2.6 In short, government policy provides a framework which: 
 
 
Protects nationally important designated Heritage Assets (which include 
World Heritage Sites, Scheduled Ancient Monuments, Listed Buildings, 
Protected 
Wreck 
Sites, 
Registered 
Parks 
and 
Gardens, 
Registered 
Battlefields or Conservation Areas); 
 
Protects the settings of such designations; 
 
In appropriate circumstances seeks adequate information (from desk based 
assessment and field evaluation where necessary) to enable informed 
decisions; and 
 
Provides for the excavation and investigation of sites not significant enough 
to merit in-situ preservation.  
 
2.3 
In considering any planning application for development, the planning authority 
will be mindful of the framework set by government policy, in this instance the 
NPPF, by current Development Plan Policy and by other material considerations. 
 
Overarching National Policy Statement for Energy (EN-1) 
 
Historic environment 
 
2.4 
The construction, operation and decommissioning of energy infrastructure has the 
potential to result in adverse impacts on the historic environment. 
 
2.5 
The historic environment includes all aspects of the environment resulting from 
the interaction between people and places through time, including all surviving 
physical remains of past human activity, whether visible, buried or submerged,

landscaped and planted or managed flora. Those elements of the historic 
environment that hold value to this and future generations because of their 
historic, archaeological, architectural or artistic interest are called ”heritage 
assets”. A heritage asset may be any building, monument, site, place, area or 
landscape, or any combination of these. The sum of the heritage interests that a 
heritage asset holds is referred to as its significance. 
 
2.6 
Some heritage assets have a level of significance that justifies official designation. 
Categories of designated heritage assets are: a World Heritage Site; Scheduled 
Monument; Protected Wreck Site; Protected Military Remains, Listed Building; 
Registered Park and Garden; Registered Battlefield; Conservation Area; and 
Registered Historic Landscape (Wales only). 
 
2.7 
There are heritage assets with archaeological interest that are not currently 
designated as scheduled monuments, but which are demonstrably of equivalent 
significance. These include: 
 
 
those that have yet to be formally assessed for designation; 
 
those that have been assessed as being designatable but which the 
Secretary of State has decided not to designate; and 
 
those that are incapable of being designated by virtue of being outside 
scope of the Ancient Monuments and Archaeological Areas Act 1979. 
 
2.8 
The absence of designation for such heritage assets does not indicate lower 
significance. If the evidence before the IPC indicates to it that a non-designated 
heritage asset of the type described above may be affected by the proposed 
development then the heritage asset should be considered subject to the same 
policy considerations as those that apply to designated heritage assets 
 
2.9 
The IPC should also consider the impacts on other non-designated heritage 
assets, as identified either through the development plan making process (local 
listing) or through the IPC’s decision making process on the basis of clear 
evidence that the assets have a heritage significance that merits consideration in 
its decisions, even though those assets are of lesser value than designated 
heritage assets. 
 
2.10 
Impacts on heritage assets specific to types of infrastructure are included in the 
technology-specific NPSs.  The specific NPSs are EN2, EN4, EN5.  These NPSs are

part of a suite of energy infrastructure NPSs and should be read in conjunction 
with EN-1. 
 
2.11 
The northern boundary of the Project Site lies between Bedford Borough Council 
to the north and Central Bedfordshire Council to the south (Appendix 1).  
 
2.12 
The relevant development plan framework is provided by the Central Bedfordshire 
LDF Core Strategy and Development Management Policies (Adopted December 
2009) which contains the following policy relating to archaeology:

GEOLOGY AND TOPOGRAPHY 
 
3.1 
Geology 
 
3.1.1 The British Geological Survey indicates that the solid geology comprises Oxford 
clays with Kellaway beds in an area known as the Bedford clay vale (BGS Sheet 
203: Bedford, 1900). The surface disturbance of the area is limited and the soil 
types are generally calcareous gley loams (OS Soil Survey 1968). 
 
3.1.2 The drift geology on the Project Site according to the BGS Survey Sheet 
comprises strips of Valley Gravel in the south-east and south-west of the Project 
Site. A small area of Alluvium is located in the south-west of the Project Site.  
 
3.1.3 There is no geo-technical data currently available for the Project Site. However an 
archaeological evaluation at Rookery Pit South in the centre of the Project Site 
recorded between 0.3-0.5m of topsoil and subsoil overlying Boulder Clay 
becoming sandier in the westernmost trenches (Albion Archaeology 2011).  
 
3.2 
Topography 
 
3.2.1 The majority of the Project Site occupies a gradual slope from south down to the 
north within Marston Vale.  
 
3.2.2 Historically the natural topography of the Project Site would have comprised a 
gradual slope down from two highpoints at c. 70m AOD (Above Ordnance Datum) 
in the south and the south-west of the Project Site, down to c. 50m AOD in the 
north and north-east of the Project Site, and c. 40m AOD in the extreme north-
west of the Project Site. However, clay extraction for brickmaking in the north of 
the Project Site has significantly altered the Project Site’s natural topography. The 
north-west area of the Project Site now occupies two former Clay Pits (Rookery 
North and South Pits), which have been partially backfilled and flooded.  
 
3.2.3 A tributary of the River Great Ouse, lies c. 1 km west of the Project Site and flows 
northwards to its confluence with the River Great Ouse, c. 10 km to the north-
east of the Project Site.

4.1 
Introduction  
 
4.1.1 
Examination of data in the Central Bedfordshire and Bedford Borough Historic 
Environment Records (HER) within the 1 km study area, and documentary 
evidence from the parishes of Marston Moretaine, Houghton Conquest and 
Ampthill in the County Records Office has been consulted. Several 
undesignated archaeological assets are recorded on the Project Site itself. 
Two Scheduled Monuments (Houghton House and Ampthill Castle) are located 
to the south east of the Project Site. The Ampthill Park Registered Park and 
Garden lies to the sites south-eastern boundary of the study area.  The 
location of sites mentioned in the text are shown in Appendix 1. 
 
4.1.2 
Evidence of archaeological interest in the region of the Project Site is varied. 
In the past, the Oxford clays of the Marston Vale have been described as a 
significant gap in terms of archaeological evidence.  However recent works 
and aerial photography since the late 1990s has begun to redress the 
balance. The archaeology of the wider region, the archaeology of 
Bedfordshire, has recently been presented in the Research and Archaeology: 
Resource Assessment Research Agenda and Strategy (Oake et al., 2007).

4.1.3 
Archaeological investigations have been undertaken on the Project Site 
comprising 
an 
Archaeological 
Evaluation 
(Albion 
Archaeology, 
2011) 
(Appendix 2), and an aerial photograph assessment (Palmer 2011). The aerial 
photograph assessment identified cropmarks of potentially archaeological 
origin within the Project Site. The archaeological evaluation in the west of the 
Project Site recorded an enclosed late Iron Age/Roman settlement and a 
possible prehistoric settlement either side of a former stream channel (see 
Appendix 2).  
 
4.1.4 
A number of cropmarks are identified from aerial photographs as representing 
prehistoric and Romano-British settlement sites on the HER within the study 
area. However the recent archaeological evaluation in the west of the Project 
Site did not record any correlation between the plotted cropmarks and 
excavated features, suggesting the cropmarks were non-archaeological in 
origin (Albion 2011). 
 
4.2 
Palaeolithic, Mesolithic, Neolithic & Bronze Age 
 
4.2.1 
There are no Palaeolithic finds recorded on the HER within the study area.  
 
4.2.2 
A Mesolithic flint flake was found through fieldwalking c. 2 km to the south of the 
Project Site (HER Ref; 7468, TL 020 382). Two Mesolithic flint blades were found 
during evaluation work on the Willington to Steppingley Gas Pipeline 1.4 km to 
the south-east of the Project Site (HER Ref; 7485, TL 022 391 & HER Ref; 7486, 
TL 025 391). 
 
4.2.3 
A large collection of prehistoric flints including Mesolithic, Neolithic and Bronze 
Age flints were recovered by a local amateur archaeologist between 1969 and 
2000 to the south-east of the Project Site, c. 2.4 km to the south-east (HER Ref; 
18269, TL 03190 38620). 
 
4.2.4 
The cropmark of an isolated ring ditch on the top of a small hillock is recorded 
on the HER in the south-west of the Project Site, adjacent to the Millbrook 
Proving Ground (HER Ref; MNN16566, TL 011 399).  
 
4.2.5 
A probable prehistoric roundhouse was recorded during the evaluation in the 
west of the Project Site although no dating evidence was recorded (see Appendix 
2).

LM/17657 
4.2.6 
No evidence of Palaeolithic, Mesolithic or Neolithic activity was recorded during 
the archaeological evaluation in the south west of the Project Site. Overall the 
Project Site’s potential for the early prehistoric periods is therefore considered to 
be low.  
 
4.2.7 
Overall the likelihood of evidence of Bronze Age activity being found on the 
Project Site is considered to be moderate, and high in the west of the Project 
Site in the area of the probable ring ditch.  
 
4.3 
Iron Age and Roman 
 
4.3.1 
The archaeological evaluation in the west of the Project Site south of Rookery 
South Pit recorded an enclosed Iron Age-Roman settlement which was bordered 
by a palaeochannel that was possibly contemporary, within the Project Site 
(Appendix 2) (Albion 2011) (HER; 19806, TL 0111 4045).  
 
4.3.2 
Extensive archaeological remains were recently discovered at the Millenium 
Country Park, Marston c. 1 km north-west of the Project Site, where a late Iron 
Age/early Roman farmstead was recorded (HER Ref; 17715, TL 0000 4117). In 
addition an archaeological evaluation to the north-east of the Project Site on 
Stewartby Way, has recorded an Iron Age farmstead (Albion 2010).  
 
4.3.3 
Excavations ahead of the construction of a pipeline crossing the south-east of 
the Project Site recorded pits and ditches of early to middle Iron Age date (HER 
Ref; 18169, TL 0369 4034). 
 
4.3.4 
A Roman road identified by Viatores in 1964 as No 170b crosses the south-west 
part of the Project Site, but there is no physical archaeological evidence to 
suggest there was a Roman road in this area (HER; 5020, TL 0597 3226). 
 
4.3.5 
A scatter of Roman pottery was found during fieldwalking at How End, c. 1.5 km 
east of the Project Site, and subsequently a cropmark indicating an enclosure 
was recorded at the same location and is thought to be Roman (HER; 2425, TL 
031 407). 
 
4.3.6 
Several Roman findspots are recorded within the study area found by metal 
detector including a Roman coin (HER; 18358, TL 02 38), twenty-four Roman 
coins, three brooches and a knife found in How End, c.2.2 km to the north east 
of the Project Site (HER; 18517, TL 03 40), a Roman coin found south-east of

Ampthill Park House, c.2 km to the south-east of the Project Site (HER 18765, 
TL 02 38). 
 
4.3.7 
Several areas of undated cropmarks are recorded on the Project Site from aerial 
photography (HER; 4469, TL 017 401) and (HER 9077, TL 026 401). 
 
4.3.8 
The presence of an enclosed Romano-British settlement on the Project Site 
suggests that the general area was likely to have formed an agricultural 
landscape with farmsteads sited along the tributary of the River Ouse during the 
Iron Age and Roman periods. 
 
4.4 
Anglo-Saxon and Medieval 
 
4.4.1 
Archaeological excavations at the Millennium Country Park, Marston c. 1 km 
north-west of the Project Site, recorded evidence for Saxon settlement in two 
areas (HER Ref; 17715, TL 0000 4117). One comprised large groups of 
intercutting pits near to the southerly Iron Age to Roman settlement. The pits 
may have had an industrial use but were backfilled with domestic waste. The 
southern settlement focus produced a large number of postholes believed to 
indicate fence lines.  
 
4.4.2 
Evidence for Saxon settlement comprising structural remains including possible 
beam slots and evidence of partitions were found during a trial trenching 
exercise in 2009, in Ampthill Park, c. 1.7 km south east from the centre of the 
Project Site (HER Ref; 18265, TL 0258 3839). 
 
4.4.3 
The earliest reference to a settlement at Marston is from AD 969 regarding the 
boundary of the men of Marston (Mercstuninga gemœre). The Doomsday Survey 
of 1086 refers to the overlordship of Marston Manor. 
 
4.4.4 
During the medieval period the Project Site lay south-east of the village of 
Marston. The majority of the Project Site lies within the parish of Marston 
Moretaine. The south-east of the Project Site lies within the parish of Ampthill 
and the north-east of the Project Site lies within the parish of Houghton 
Conquest.  
 
4.4.5 
Evidence of arable agriculture in the form of ridge and furrow is recorded on the 
HER within the study area recorded from aerial photography. Within the Project 
Site itself cropmarks indicate a possible medieval field system in the south of the

Project Site indicating that the Project Site was in agricultural use during the 
Medieval period (HER 14743, TL 018 392).   
 
4.4.6 
A possible medieval moated site is recorded immediately north-west of Project 
Site at Pillinge Farm South, represented by a square arrangement of ditches 
surrounding an orchard, on the western Project Site boundary (HER 3270, TL 
0095 4049).  
 
4.4.7 
No evidence for Saxon or medieval activity was recorded during the 
archaeological evaluation in the west of the Project Site. Accordingly, a generally 
low potential is identified for settlement or other significant remains of these 
periods, and a moderate potential is identified for evidence of early medieval 
agricultural activity. 
 
4.5 
Late Medieval and Post-Medieval  
 
4.5.1 
The Scheduled Monument of Ampthill Castle is located c. 1 km south-east of the 
Project Site (SM No 1009630 TL 02476 38338). The monument includes the 
remains of a 15th century palace, which is situated at the top of the north-facing 
scarp of the Greensand ridge. The approximate site of the palace is marked by 
Katherine's Cross, erected in the 1770's to commemorate Katherine of Aragon 
who lived for a time at the palace. Although there are no upstanding walls, there 
exists a detailed survey of the palace precinct drawn up in 1534 which enables 
the plan and extent of the ruins to be ascertained. The main precinct comprised 
four wings arranged about a rectangular inner court, with a gatehouse on the 
east wing and kitchens and a great hall on the north.  
 
4.5.2 
Ampthill Park situated c. 1.7km south-east of the Project Site is a Registered 
Park and Garden and comprises a 17th/18th century country house surrounded by 
a landscape park by Lancelot Brown dating between 1771-2 (RPG No 1000378 
TL 02717 38816). Ampthill Great Park was originally a deer park surrounding 
Ampthill Castle. Having become royal property, the castle and parks were used 
by Henry VIII, who paid frequent visits between 1524 and 1532, and by 
Katherine of Aragon in the early 1530s during the divorce proceedings with 
Henry. The castle was ruinous by the end of the 16th century (VCH) and the 
present Park House was built in the late 17th century to replace the Great Lodge.  
 
4.5.3 
The Scheduled Monument of Houghton House lies c. 1 km east of the Project 
Site (SM No 1013522, TL 03900 39469). The house typifies conventional late

16th and early 17th century design. Houghton House therefore represents an 
important transitional period between Elizabethan and Jacobean architecture, 
and the neo-Classicism which was to follow. The past owners and occupiers of 
the house are well documented, and in the case of Mary, the Dowager Countess, 
the biographical details provide insights into the development of the design. The 
significance of the structural remains is increased rather than reduced by the 
limited period of occupation, since the house has no significant later alterations 
or elaboration. 
 
4.5.4 
The Jeffreys Map of 1765 (Fig. 2) and the Ordnance Survey map of 1811 (Fig. 5) 
show the Project Site lying within fields between settlements at Wootton Pillinge 
in the north, How End to the east, Millbrook to the south and Marston Pillinge to 
the west. A lane is shown crossing the east of the Project Site on the line of 
Marston Road linking Millbrook and How End.  
 
4.5.5 
Further detail is shown on the 1808 Ampthill Inclosure Map and the 1809 
Houghton Conquest Inclosure Map which show the east of the Project Site 
occupying fields (Figs 3-4).  
 
4.5.6 
The Marston Moretaine Tithe Map and Award of 1843 shows the Project Site 
occupied by grass fields and arable fields (Fig. 6). The north-west of the Project 
Site is shown bounded by a moated enclosure and farm buildings.  
 
4.5.7 
The Ordnance Survey map of 1882 shows the Project Site occupied by fields 
with the newly constructed London & North Western Railway bounding the 
north-west of the Project Site, and the Midland Railway bounding the south 
eastern Project Site’s boundary (Fig. 7).  
 
4.5.8 
No significant changes are shown to have occurred at the Project Site between 
1900 and 1959 (Figs. 8-11).  
 
4.5.9 
Two former clay extraction pits (Rookery Pits) are located in the north of the 
Project Site (HER 6681 TL 017 411). The remains of the former conveyor line 
survive in the north-west of the Project Site within Rookery North Pit, mainly 
evidenced by concrete plinths along the former route, but also as a conveyor 
bridge crossing over the railway line close to Green Lane.   
 
4.5.10 By 1976 the northern half of the Project Site was used as a Clay Pit and an 
access road was built along the north-western edge of the Project Site (Fig. 12). 
By 1988-89 the Clay Pit in the north of the Project Site was disused (Fig. 13).

From 2002 the disused Clay Pits in the north of the Project Site were shown as 
flooded (Figs 14-15).  
 
4.5.11 Overall, the archaeological potential of the Project Site for late Medieval and 
Post-Medieval evidence is confined to any remains of former field boundaries 
and any structures associated with the 20th century clay extraction pits.

SITE CONDITIONS, THE PROPOSED DEVELOPMENT AND IMPACT ON 
HERITAGE ASSETS 
 
5.1 
Site Conditions 
 
5.1.1 
The Project Site comprises the site of the Project (Plate 1). The north of the 
Project Site is occupied by The Rookery, comprising two large former clay pits, 
Rookery North and Rookery South Pits, separated by an east-west spine of 
unexcavated clay. The remainder of the Project Site occupies undulating 
agricultural land. 
 
5.1.2 
The excavation of clay extraction pits in the north of the Project Site, would have 
had completely removed archaeological deposits within the limits of the pits 
themselves.  
 
5.1.3 
Partial backfilling of the pits has been undertaken and engineered fill has been 
placed against their sides in areas where the current slope gradients require 
additional buttressing works in order to ensure that long-term stability can be 
maintained. 
 
5.2 
The Project 
 
5.2.1 
The Project would comprise: 
 
A new Power Generation Plant in the form of a Simple Cycle Gas Turbine 
(SCGT) peaking power generating station, fuelled by natural gas and capable 
of providing a rated electrical output of up to 299 Megawatts (MW). The 
Power Generation Plant comprises: 
 Generating equipment including up to five Gas Turbine Generators, up to 
five exhaust gas flue stacks  and balance of plant, which are located 
within the Generating Equipment Site (together the "Generating 
Equipment"); 
 A new purpose built access road from Green Lane to the Generating 
Equipment Site (the "Access Road");  
 A temporary construction compound required during construction only 
(the "Laydown Area"); 
 
A new gas connection to bring natural gas to the Generating Equipment from 
the National Transmission System (NTS) (the "Gas Connection"); and 
 
A new underground electrical connection to export power from the Generating 
Equipment to the National Grid Electricity Transmission System (NETS) (the 
"Electrical Connection").

LM/17657 
5.2.2 
The Project is proposed at and in the vicinity of the former clay extraction pit at 
Rookery South, near Stewartby, Bedfordshire.  The boundary of the Project Site 
falls within both Central Bedfordshire Council (CBC) and Bedford Borough 
Council (BBC) areas.  
5.2.3 
The Generating Equipment, Access Road and Laydown Area are together known 
as the "Power Generation Plant", and are located within the Power Generation 
Plant Site.  
5.2.4 
The Power Generation Plant, Gas Connection, and Electrical Connection, together 
with all access requirements are referred to as the ‘Project’ and are all integral 
to the generation of electricity and subsequent export of that electricity to the 
National Grid. The land upon which the Project would be developed, or which 
would be required in order to facilitate the development of the Project, is 
referred to as the ‘Project Site’. 
 
5.3 
Impact on Archaeological Heritage Assets 
 
5.3.1 
The Project would not directly impact any designated heritage assets. However 
an archaeological evaluation has recorded undesignated heritage assets 
comprising possible prehistoric and late Iron Age/Roman settlements within the 
Project Site (Appendix 2).  
 
5.3.2 
The Power Generation Plant would be unlikely to have an archaeological impact 
due to its location within a former Clay extraction pit and the LLRS works. 
However the proposed Electrical and Gas Connections outside of Rookery South 
Pit in the east and west of the Project Site could have an archaeological impact 
through the cutting of footings and services, and construction groundworks.  
 
5.3.3 
A programme of archaeological mitigation will be undertaken on the Gas 
Connection and Electrical Connection after the Development Consent Order 
(DCO) has been made as agreed with the Central Bedfordshire Council 
Archaeological Officer during consultations.  Following the DCO being made, a 
written scheme of investigation (WSI) will be produced and submitted to the CBC 
Archaeological Officer.  This document will define the scope of works and the 
methods of excavation and recording that will be implemented.  
 
5.3.4 
The mitigation will comprise of an archaeological strip, map and sample operation 
during the construction of both the Gas and Electrical Connections.  This will 
comprise areas required for excavation associated with the trenches required to 
install the Pipeline and underground cables as well as the AGI and their

process 
any 
archaeological 
features 
exposed 
will 
be

excavated 
archaeologically and recorded according to a sampling strategy set out within the 
WSI and agreed with the CBC Archaeological Officer.  Following completion of the 
fieldwork, the findings will be assessed, analysed and published in full in an 
appropriate academic journal.  These works will be undertaken in accordance 
with the CIfA Standards and Guidance for Excavation and/or Standards and 
Guidance for an Archaeological Watching Brief (CIfA 2014).

6.0 
SUMMARY AND CONCLUSIONS 
 
6.1 
Land at the Project Site is proposed for development. The Project would 
comprise the construction of a new Power Generation Plant fuelled by natural 
gas, with associated Gas and Electrical Connections. 
 
6.2 
Recent archaeological investigations on the Project Site have recorded the 
presence of possible prehistoric settlement activity and a late Iron 
Age/Roman enclosed settlement in the west of the Project Site. Evidence of 
medieval ridge and furrow has also been recorded in the south of the Project 
Site.  
 
6.3 
The north of the Project Site is occupied by Rookery Pit which comprises two 
20th century clay extraction pits, which would have removed all archaeological 
potential within the limits of their extents. Post-medieval and modern 
ploughing are likely to have had a superficial but widespread archaeological 
impact on the remaining arable land.  
 
6.4 
The Power Generation Plant would be unlikely to have an archaeological 
impact due to its location within a former clay extraction pit and the LLRS 
works. However the proposed Electrical and Gas Connections to the south of 
Rookery South Pit could have an archaeological impact through the cutting of 
footings and services, and construction groundworks.  
 
6.5 
A programme of archaeological mitigation will be undertaken on the Gas 
Connection and Electrical Connection south of Rookery South Pit which has 
been agreed with the Central Bedfordshire Council Archaeological Officer 
during consultations.  Following the DCO being made, a written scheme of 
investigation (WSI) will be produced and agreed with the CBC Archaeological 
Officer.  This document will define the scope of works and the methods of 
excavation and recording that will be implemented.   
 
6.6 
The mitigation will comprise an archaeological strip, map and sample 
operation during the construction of both the Gas and Electrical Connections.  
This will comprise areas required for excavation associated with the trenches 
required to install the Pipeline and underground cables as well as the AGI and 
their associated construction easements, being stripped archaeologically.  
During this process any archaeological features exposed will be hand 
excavated archaeologically and recorded according to a sampling strategy set

Assessment of Effects 
Summary 
of 
Effects 
Setting: The farmhouse is located within a garden on all sides with 
outhouses on its northern side.  The garden is bounded by tall trees and 
other vegetation on its eastern, northern and southern sides. The house 
faces a modern farm complex of barns and other agricultural buildings on 
its western side beyond which there is a line of tall trees.  The house is 
approached along a drive from the road which passes through a narrow 
gate into an area of grassland leading to the farmhouse and farmyard.  
The effect of this and the trees that encloses the farm and farmyard, 
creates an area which feels ‘cut off’ from its surrounding area which 
comprises the Rookery Pit and other disused pits, the Ampthill Testing 
Circuit, the railway and Millbrook Railway Station.  The effect of these 
features is to have replaced the agricultural land that would have been 
historically in the area of the farm thereby removing the historic 
connection between the farm and its land.  Therefore, the setting only has 
a positive contribution to the house’s significance in the immediate 
surroundings of the house.   
 
The area of the setting that has a 
positive 
contribution 
to 
the 
significance of the house will be 
unaffected 
by 
the 
Project.  
However, the stacks of the Power 
Generation Plant will be at least 
partially visible to the east of the 
house.  Therefore, there will be a 
change 
within 
the 
area 
immediately to the east of the 
setting 
of 
the 
house. 
 
The 
Rookery Pit area has already lost 
its historical connection with the 
farmhouse.   
There has been a noise survey 
undertaken at Pillinge Farm which 
has established that there will be 
no residual noise effects on the 
setting (see Chapter 7). 
The construction and operation of 
the Generation Plant will have a 
minor visual effect on the setting. 
The 
Gas 
and 
Electrical 
Connections will have no effects 
on the setting of the farmhouse. 
Significance: Regional, potentially national significance. 
Minor effect on the contribution 
that the setting provides to the 
significance 
of 
Pillinge 
Farmhouse.  The significance of 
the farmhouse itself will not be 
reduced.

Setting: The setting of the railway station comprises of the railway, 
Station Road and its immediate surroundings.  It is only within this area 
that the setting provides a positive contribution to the significance of the 
station as being part of the local and regional transport system.  The 
existing overhead pylons are a dominant feature within the vicinity of the 
station.  Tall trees to the east of the station block views in the direction of 
the Project. 
 
There will be no effects on the 
setting of the station as the 
Project lies beyond its setting.  
Furthermore, views of the stacks 
of the Power Generation Plant are

Character: 
Medieval village parish church. 
There

be 
no

on 
character of the church. 
Views: 
No designed views. The church and tower are located 
on the eastern edge of the built up area of Marston 
Moretaine and views in and out from the church to 
the north west and south are contained by the 
adjacent buildings of the village.  The churchyard is 
bounded by tall trees and other vegetation on the 
eastern side which restricts views out from the 
churchyard to the east.   
The church tower can be seen in views toward 
Marston Moretaine from the east and south west 
from places along the former A421.  There are views 
of the church from some places to the west.  
However, the church tower is not a prominent 
feature in such views which also include many other 
tall structures such as Stewartby chimneys, pylons 
and Marston Vale Wind Turbine.   
The 
stacks 
of 
the 
Power 
Generation Plant will be visible in 
the distance in some limited 
views of the church tower from 
the north west.   The Project will 
not be visible from the church or 
tower or in views towards them 
from the north, south and east. 
 
Context: 
Medieval village parish churches 
No effect  
Setting: The church and tower are within a roughly oval churchyard 
within the historic core Marston Moretaine.  This area forms the core of 
the church’s setting and it is within this area that the setting has a strong 
positive contribution to the significance of the church and tower.  The 
wider countryside visible from and to the church also provides a mildly 
positive contribution to the significance of the church.  However, as stated 
in relation to views, views out from and towards the church are limited 
from the wider countryside and where there are such possibilities, the 
church is experienced with many modern tall and industrial structures.   
The 
stacks 
of 
the 
Power 
Generation Plant will have a 
limited effect in limited areas 
within the wider setting.  They 
will not be experienced with the 
church and tower from within the 
core of the setting where the 
contribution 
to 
significance 
is 
greatest.   
In some views of the tower from 
the north west, the Project will be 
visible in the distance beyond the 
church.  However, this is an area 
that already contains tall and

slight projection beneath pediment. Widely splayed 
perron leads up to classical doorway in centre of the 
piano nobile. In continuation of this storey run 
pilastered wings connecting 2 rectangular blocks (4 
windows by 4 windows) also of only 2 storeys and 
beneath (later) hipped slate roofs, standing forward 
of the main block.  
Early parts by Captain Wynn, designer of original 
Buckingham House. Influenced by Wren, who was 
engaged on work in Ampthill, is apparent. Chambers 
remodelled the side blocks, adding a 3-sided bay to 
the outer flank of north-east block, and much of the 
main block, encasing the whole house in stucco.

other tall industrial structures 
such 
as

and the electricity pylons that are 
located to the south of the Power 
Generation Plant, all of which will 
be at an apparent similar distance 
to the north west of the house. 
The stacks will also be visible in 
views of the house from parts of 
Ampthill Park in which the stacks 
will be visible in the distance and 
c. 900 from the house.  As with 
views from the house, there are 
other tall industrial structures at

Setting: The house is located within gardens which in turn are located 
within Ampthill Park Registered Park and Garden.  The house is 
approached along a track from the north east off which its driveway 
comes at the front of the house. To the rear of the house is a block of

The gardens of the house and Ampthill Park have a very strong positive 
contribution to the significance of the house due to their historical 
associations and the aesthetic experience of the house.  The views over 
the countryside to the north west of the house also have a positive 
contribution to the significance of the house as it was built, in part, for 
this view.  However, this view contains a significant quantity of modern 
industrial and transport related structures within it, such as the two 
railways along which trains can be seen and heard passing by the house, 
Marston Vale wind turbine, Stewartby chimneys and electricity pylons.

strong positive contribution to the significance of the listed structures.   
The wider countryside also forms part of the setting where the chimneys 
act as a landmark feature.  This provides limited positive contribution to 
the significance of the kilns and chimneys.

Historic 
interest: 
Houghton House was built within an area formerly 
known as Dame Ellensbury Park, named after 
Alianor, the second wife of Sir Almaric de St Amand. 
His family owned considerable land in Bedfordshire in 
the 14th and 15th centuries. After Almaric's death in 
1430, the manor passed to Lord Fanhope of Ampthill 
Castle, although part of the estate was retained by 
Alianor until her death in 1467; and it has been 
suggested that Alianor's residence stood on the site 
of Houghton House. Dame Ellensbury Park, together 
with Ampthill Park, later passed to the crown and 
became a royal hunting territory. In 1606, James I 
visited the area and commissioned the architect John 
Thorpe to draw up plans for the reconstruction of 
Ampthill Castle. This project was abandoned, and it 
is thought that the architect was subsequently re-
directed to design Houghton House. In 1615 James 
granted the house to Mary Herbert, Countess 
Dowager of Kent and it is thought that she 
commissioned Inigo Jones to design the neo-
Classical loggias for the north and west entrances. 
The house reverted to the crown after her death in 
1621, and was later granted to Thomas Bruce, Earl 
of Elgin. Thomas's son Robert, 1st Earl of Ailesbury, 
succeeded to the property after the restoration of the 
monarchy in 1660, and was in turn succeeded by his 
son, Thomas, who went into exile with James II in 
1688. In 1738, Thomas's heir sold the property to 
the 4th Duke of Bedford. The duke's son, the 
Marquis of Tavistock, lived there from 1764 until his 
death in a hunting accident in 1767. In 1794 the 
Duke of Bedford ordered the house to be un-roofed 
and partially dismantled, with some items taken for 
reuse elsewhere. The remaining structure was 
abandoned until 1923, when it was purchased with a 
view to preservation by the Bedford Arts Club.  
The house may have provided the inspiration for 
'House Beautiful' in Bunyan’s The Pilgrim’s Progress.   
There will be no effect on the

Historic 
interest: 
The palace was built in the early 1400's by Sir John 
Cornwall, later Lord Fanhope. He married Elizabeth, 
sister of Henry IV, and wanted a residence `Meet for 
his Royal spouse'. The palace came into the hands of 
Henry VIII in 1524 and Katherine of Aragon lived 
there during the divorce proceedings of 1533. The 
buildings had already fallen into decay by 1555 and 
at the time of the 1567 survey its partial demolition 
was planned. Final demolition took place before 
1649.

Remains of a 15th century palace.  The approximate 
site of the palace is marked by Katherine's Cross, 
erected in the 1770's to commemorate Katherine of 
Aragon who lived for a time at the palace. Although 
there are no upstanding walls, there exists a detailed 
survey of the palace precinct drawn up in 1534 which 
enables the plan and extent of the ruins to be 
ascertained. The main precinct comprised four wings 
arranged about a rectangular inner court, with a 
gatehouse on the east wing and kitchens and a great 
hall on the north. Outside the north wing was a 
smaller court which contained a well-house. To the 
east and south the palace was surrounded by an 
outer, or `Base', Court which had a range of 
buildings at the perimeter which contained stables, 
workshops and other rooms which housed the 
ancillary functions of the palace. Using the known 
plan as a guide, the remains of the palace can be 
traced on the ground. At the crest of the ridge is a 
rectangular platform which is the site of the Inner 
Court. Katherine's Cross is located on this platform. 
Between the north edge of the platform and the edge 
of the steeply sloping natural scarp is a terrace which 
accommodated the well-house court. The eastern 
edge of the Base Court ran about 50 m to the west 
of the platform, diagonally across the present Rugby 
field, and its southern side is considered to lie at the 
break of slope of the scarp above the car park fence. 
The route of an original access into the Base Court 
from Woburn Road is marked by a gully leading up 
this scarp. This scarp and the steep slope to the west

boundary or headland about 1 m high visible on the 
south east edge. At the northern end of the village 
are the remains of two moated sites. One is attached 
to the north east corner of the village. The second 
moat lies to the north-west of Thrupp End Farm and 
is comprised of two islands, a larger square island.  
The moats are considered to have been part of the 
medieval manor known as `Goldington's Manor'. The

Ringwork castle is situated on a promontory on the 
north-east 
facing 
scarp 
of 
the 
Bedfordshire 
Greensand ridge and lies in the grounds of The 
Round House, a derelict 19th century building, Grade 
II Listed. Although considerably altered by the 
construction 
of 
the 
house 
and 
associated 
landscaping, the southern quadrant of the castle 
survives as a substantial earthwork and in the 
northern quadrant the line of the ramparts can be 
discerned as distinct scarps. The castle is oval in plan 
measuring and comprises a central stronghold, the 
ringwork, with an outer defended court, or bailey, to 
the north, and is further defended to the south and 
west by a ditch and outer bank. The remains of the 
ringwork are visible to the south-east of The Round 
House as a pair of mounds which have been altered 
by quarrying but which were originally linked to form 
a full circuit. The outer ditch is clearly visible south of 
the ringwork. The ditch and bank are considered to 
continue around the west side of the house, beneath 
the existing driveway.

Table 2 presents the assessment of the setting, significance and impact of the Project on registered parks and gardens and 
conservation areas.  Ampthill Park and Ampthill Conservation Area have been assessed together.  The reason form this is that the 
only part of the conservation area that is within the ZTV of the Project lies within the Registered Park and Garden which extends 
further into the ZTV than the conservation area does.

Ampthill Manor; Ampthill Little Park, lay south of the 
Ampthill to Woburn road. Having become royal 
property, the castle and parks were used by Henry 
VIII, who paid frequent visits between 1524 and 
1532, and by Katherine of Aragon in the early 1530s 
during the divorce proceedings with Henry. The 
castle was ruinous by the end of the 16th century and 
the present Park House was built in the late 17th 
century.  Lancelot Brown was employed to landscape 
the park from 1771-2. Horace Walpole visited 
Ampthill, corresponding regularly with Lady Ossory, 
and advised on the erection of the Katherine Cross in 
1773, contributing the inscription. The second Earl 
lived at Park House until his death in 1818. In 1837 
it was leased to Sir James Parke, later Lord 
Wensleydale, whose family remained as tenants until 
his widow's death in 1879, the estate having been 
bought by the Duke of Bedford during this period. 
The house was occupied by the army during World 
War II, following which it was sold to Bovril Limited, 
in 1955 becoming a Cheshire Home.

extend as far as the higher ground to the north west of Marston Moretaine

As with Park House, the views over the countryside of the Bedford Plain to 
the north west of the house have a positive contribution to the 
significance of the house as it was built, in part, for this view.  However, 
this view contains a significant quantity of modern industrial and transport 
related structures within it, such as the two railways along which trains 
can be seen and heard passing by the house, Marston Vale wind turbine, 
Stewartby chimneys and electricity pylons.

The earliest reference to Millbrook is Doomsday 
when the manors of Millbrook and Ampthill were held 
by the d’Albini family. The first owners of the Manor 
of Millbrook were the Norman Barons of Cainhoe 
Castle, the De Albinis, later known as D'Albini and 
Daubeney. They were followed by a St. Croix and 
after him came the St Amands, great Crusaders. The 
Beauchamps who followed, sold the manor to the 
renowned Knight of Agincourt fame, Sir John 
Cornwall, who married the sister of King Henry IV, 
and became Lord Fanhope, Baron Millbrook, held the 
Order of the Garter, and built Ampthill Castle in the 
15th century. The Earls of Kent of Wrest Park 
followed, and eventually the Manor passed into the 
possession of King Henry VIII, and was annexed to 
the Royal Honour of Ampthill. The Bruce family, Earls 
of Elgin and of Ailesbury, were Seneschals of the 
Honour in the 17th century and Lords of the Manor 
until the time of the Earl of Upper Ossory in late 18th

Hi Rob 
  
Thanks for your emails and apologies for not replying earlier. 
  
Having thought about both your proposals and given the acknowledged issues with identifying the 
route of the gas pipeline connections I am not sure that doing geophysics of the whole corridors will 
be worth the effort. Although there has been some success using geophysical survey to detect sites 
within the clay vale, conditions are such that geophysics alone is not a sound basis for identifying 
archaeological remains. Geophysics would need to be complimented by a programme of trial 
trenching to be confident of the results. On that basis I think that the your original proposal for doing 
strip map and sample of the selected pipeline routes ahead of construction may be the most effective 
way of dealing with the archaeological impact of the pipeline, and indeed the pylon bases.
