2018 was another strong year for clean power production. 53% of Britain’s 
electricity was produced from low-carbon sources, and fossil fuel generation 
was down by 7% on the previous year, its 8th consecutive fall.
The carbon intensity of electricity averaged 217 g/kWh over the year, 8% 
lower than in 2017. This is the slowest rate of decline since 2013, but it still 
keeps us on track to meet the Committee on Climate Change’s target of 100 
g/kWh by 2030. Britain’s carbon intensity must continue to fall by 6% per 
year over the coming decade to reach their target, so the current rate of 
progress must be maintained. 
This issue reviews the state of Britain’s power system in 2018, looking at 
how eight key trends have developed over the last decade. The second 
article looks forwards at what to expect in 2019: the effects of court rulings 
and corporate pull-outs will start to bite, and many aspects of Brexit may 
begin to impact on the power sector. 2018 has been a record-breaking year 
in many ways: wind, solar, biomass and gas generators all hit all-time highs 
for output. To keep track of all that is going on, we compile all the GB power 
system records and discuss some of the highlights. 
After years of precipitous decline, coal output fell again by a quarter over 
2018. Coal has become a cold-weather backup fuel. As shown in the chart 
below, it was only used in bulk during the Beast from the East in March, and 
occasional weeks of low wind output during the winter. Between April and 
August, Britain’s 10 GW of coal stations produced an average of just 0.4 GW 
– running at 4% of peak output. The GB generation mix ranking shows how 
coal has now slipped two places this year to become the 6th largest source 
of electricity, behind both imports and biomass. Finally, we report on the 
capacity and production statistics for the quarter.

1. The state of Britain’s power system in 2018
2018 was another rollercoaster year for Britain’s power system. It was 
tested by the Beast from the East and the hottest summer on record, wind 
farms and solar panels continued to hit new highs, and the price of fuels 
and electricity rose sharply over the summer, reversing the fortunes of 
ailing coal plants.
But where do recent events sit in the grand scheme of things? This article 
looks at the state of Britain’s power system, showing what is happening 
in eight key areas. The following charts show historic data over the last 
decade, plus projections from National Grid, BEIS and the European 
Commission1 for the anticipated direction of travel over the coming years.
Power prices – £56.82 / MWh
GB day-ahead power prices rose 27% last year to their 
highest in a decade, adding nearly £10m a day to the 
nation’s electricity generation bill. Fuel and carbon prices 
rose sharply in 2018, but it is unclear if this will persist so 
there is wide uncertainty around future power prices.
The carbon intensity of electricity fell 8% last year, and 
now stands well under half the 2012 peak. 66 million 
tonnes of CO2 were emitted in 2018. Carbon intensity is 
expected continue falling 5% per year, reaching  
150 g/kWh by 2025. Emissions could increase in the 
short term though if coal makes a comeback.
Demand net of wind and solar fell by 4% last year, and is 
down by over a quarter in the last decade. It is expected to 
continue falling at a similar pace as more renewables are 
installed over the coming years. Gross demand was flat at 
294 TWh, and is expected to remain so for the near future.
Britain imported 22 TWh of electricity in 2018, nine 
times more than it exported. France (with its nuclear 
stations) and The Netherlands (with coal) were the 
main sources. The amount of electricity generated 
in Britain fell to its lowest in quarter of a century, as 
demand is falling and more is imported.

Low carbon share – 53%
Generation from low-carbon sources grew for the 8th 
year running. They produced 157 TWh last year, more than 
from all fossil fuels. It is uncertain whether this share will 
continue to grow as Toshiba and Hitachi have halted plans 
to build new nuclear reactors in Britain, and investment in 
renewables has fallen to its lowest in nearly a decade.
Biomass overtook coal as the 5th largest source of 
electricity in 2018. Biomass output grew by a sixth, while 
coal fell by a quarter last year. Forecasts see biomass 
output plateau as no new biomass plants are being 
planned in the near future, whilst coal will be completely 
phased out by 2025 at the latest.
More than a quarter of electricity came from renewables 
in 2018. Three fifths of this was from wind, one fifth 
from biomass, and one fifth solar plus hydro power. More 
ambitious forecasts see this pace continuing, meaning 
renewables would supply half of Britain’s electricity by 
2025, and could overtake fossil fuels as early as 2020.
Coal provided less than 1% of Britain’s electricity during 
100 days of 2018. In total, there were 1,900 hours with 
zero coal output, triple the number seen in 2017. However, 
coal provided much-needed flexible capacity during the 
cold weather in March when gas prices spiked, supplying 
more than a quarter of the country's electricity.

2. What to expect in 2019
The New Year brings new challenges to Britain’s power system. The 
capacity market was unexpectedly suspended, new low-carbon capacity 
has stalled and no-deal Brexit may disrupt carbon prices and the operation 
of interconnectors.
After a legal challenge by Tempus Energy (a smart grid start-up),1 the 
European Court of Justice brought the UK’s capacity market to a standstill 
in November,2 suspending £1 billion per year worth of capacity payments. 
These were supposed to go to generators and flexible consumers for 
ensuring availability at times of peak demand, leaving many firms in the 
electricity market with a hole in their finances. The UK Government believes 
this will not impact security of supply this winter,3 and analysts agree that 
the effects won’t be felt until later this year. Some older power stations 
may resort to closing early on financial grounds.4 This would lead to tighter 
supply margins, giving higher and more volatile prices next winter, possibly 
offsetting any reduction in consumer bills that would come from halting the 
capacity payments.
In the space of three months, Toshiba and Hitachi have shelved plans to 
build 9 GW of new nuclear reactors. Their combined capacity would have 
been sufficient to replace Britain’s entire fleet of aging nuclear reactors. 
Toshiba is closing its UK nuclear business after it failed to find a buyer for 
NuGen, and so “the economically rational decision is to withdraw from 
the UK nuclear power plant construction project”.5 Hitachi have formally 
suspended investment into nuclear stations at Wylfa Newydd in Anglesey 
and Oldbury in Gloucestershire, describing them as “incompatible with the 
company’s economic rationality”.6
Unless new partners or financing deals can be found, these announcements 
place a 9 GW hole in the amount of low-carbon capacity that will be 
available in the coming decade. One view is that this collapse “should be 
seen as an opportunity rather than a risk, for the UK to prioritise renewables 
instead”.7 However, the growth in wind and solar capacity has slowed down 
dramatically. In the last twelve months, fewer wind and solar projects were 
built than at any time since 2010 (see chart overleaf). The government 
believes this slump will continue into the next decade.8

Tempus argued that the scheme privileges generation over demand side response (DSR) due to the duration of contracts offered (up to 15 years, 
versus 1 year) and the means of cost recovery for DSR (all weekday winter evenings, rather than the specific periods of highest demand).

Finally, Brexit is just weeks away and will potentially have the biggest impact on Britain’s 
power system. If the UK leaves with no deal it will leave the Emissions Trading Scheme, 
the EU-wide market which puts a price on carbon. Government plans to replace this with 
a carbon tax of £16 per tonne, which would start in April 2019.9  However, the European 
Commission has already suspended Britain’s access to ETS carbon permits in an effort to 
limit disruption to the scheme.10  This leaves a potential gap from January through to March 
2019, where Britain has no underlying carbon price, and so power stations are only subject to 
the Carbon Price Support.11  
Until Britain’s relationship with the European Union is known, it is unclear what price fossil-
fuelled power stations should be paying for carbon emissions during Quarter 1: around £40 if 
there is a deal (ETS plus CPS) or £18 if there is no deal (CPS only). Based on emissions during 
Q1 of 2018, this difference could amount to £450 million for Britain’s coal and gas power 
stations.12  If generators anticipate lower carbon prices, coal could make a comeback at the 
start of the year. Britain may also become a net exporter of electricity, including over the new 
interconnector to Belgium, as British generators will face lower carbon prices than those on 
the continent for the first time in five years.
However, those interconnectors may not be used as efficiently as they are today. Power flows 
over Britain’s interconnectors would go from being automatic to being decided by traders.13  
At present, power implicitly flows from low- to high-priced countries: “buy cheap, sell dear”. 
While this would be the aim of traders, they are not perfect, and the loss of efficiency is 
expected to add “a couple of percent” onto the cost of generation.14  This may, of course, be 
lost in the noise of currency fluctuations, which affect the cost of imported coal, gas and 
electricity. Sterling is widely forecast to move by 10% either way against the euro and dollar, 
depending on how smooth the transition is.15
All in all, don’t expect 2019 to be a quiet year for Britain’s power system.

11 The Carbon Price Support of £18 per tonne of CO2 is levied on British power stations on top of the ETS (or carbon tax).
12 If Britain’s coal and gas stations emitted 20.5 million tonnes of CO2 (as they did in Q1 2018), they could expect to pay £370m for the Carbon Price 
Support (under no-deal), or £820 million if we stay in the ETS based on permit prices of £22 per tonne (the average during January 2019).

3. GB power system records
2018 was a record-breaking year for Britain’s power system. A common theme in recent years 
has been demand falling to new lows and renewables reaching their highest ever levels. If the 
power system continues to be transformed, such milestones will keep on being surpassed.
This quarter, Britain’s wind farms broke through the 15 GW barrier and biomass plants 
produced more than 5 TWh for the first time. 2018 as a whole has seen the highest ever 
output from wind, biomass, solar and gas power stations, and the lowest coal output and 
carbon intensity for decades. All in all, 62 new records were set this year, showing just how far 
into new territory Britain’s power system is moving.
To help keep track of all these records, they are collated in the tables below. For each 
technology and metric, the tables below look over the past decade (2009 to 2018) and report 
the highest and/or lowest instantaneous value, and sustained averages over a day, a month 
and a year. Cells highlighted in blue are records that were broken in 2018. 
Renewables:
Low carbon:
With the exception of hydro power, every 
conceivable record for renewable energy generation 
was broken in 2018. Britain operated with over  
50% renewables for nearly 200 hours in 2018.
Low-carbon sources of electricity (which we define as renewables and nuclear, both from 
Britain and imported from France) supplied nearly 18 GW of electricity averaged over last 
year. They have supplied over three-quarters of electricity for a day, and hit a peak of almost 
90% during the night of August 24th last year.

Imports and storage:
Coal output first fell to zero for four hours in May 2016, and the first day with zero coal was in April 
2017. Last year, coal fell to its lowest monthly and annual average. Gas power stations on the other 
hand reached a new record high, producing over 27 GW during the evening peak on the 26th of 
January. That was a cold day with low wind and much of the nuclear fleet out of action, showing 
the increasing need for flexible capacity. At the other extreme, the combined output of fossil-fuelled 
generators fell to a minimum of just 2.4 GW this year, on a windy Sunday night in August. 
At its peak, Britain has imported nearly one fifth of its electricity. Import and export records are 
likely to be broken in the coming year as the 1 GW Nemo Link to Belgium is due to open.

Demand:
Price and Emissions:
Gross demand for electricity includes all generation, except for small thermal generators which 
are embedded in customer premises and so are invisible to the power system. Net demand for 
electricity excludes wind and solar generation (which are weather dependent), and is what 
must be met by large thermal power stations (nuclear, biomass and fossil), imported from 
abroad or released from storage devices. Every statistic for net demand reached its lowest level 
in the past decade during 2018.
Power prices have risen by a quarter in the last year, and so the most expensive day, 
month and year of the past decade were all experienced in 2018. Conversely, the 
carbon content of electricity was down 7% on last year, so the lowest-carbon day, 
month and year were also all in 2018. The highest price and lowest carbon for a 
single half-hour in 2018 were £320/MWh and 61 g/kWh.

The sources of electricity generation in Britain, ranked from largest to smallest annual output
Drax Electric Insights Quarterly – Q1 2019

4. The GB generation mix ranking
It’s all change in the ranking of Britain’s electricity mix. Last year, coal fell from 4th to being 
the 6th largest source of power, overtaken by both imports and biomass. Until 2015, Britain’s 
electricity generation was dominated by fossil fuels, with coal and gas as the two largest 
sources. They traded places depending on relative fuel prices, but then in 2016 nuclear 
overtook coal to become the second largest source of electricity, with wind farms taking  
3rd place. 
For the first time since the industrial revolution, biomass is the predominant solid fuel used 
in Britain, as several power stations have converted from burning coal to wood pellets. This 
part of the ranking is very close, as Britain imported 19 TWh of electricity, generated 17 TWh 
from biomass and 15 TWh from coal.
Wind has been the largest source of renewable energy for the last decade, and the third 
largest source of electricity since 2016. In contrast, despite having 13 GW of solar installed 
(more than nuclear), it is only the 7th largest source of generation. The British weather 
means solar panels only generate for the equivalent of 2.5 hours at full output per day.1
Looking forwards, we could expect more changes in the coming years, as we eventually 
need cleaner sources to overtake all fossil fuels. If current trends continue, we expect solar 
to overtake coal in 2019, meaning it would have fallen from 1st to 7th in just five years. 
Overtaking gas will take much longer. It generated 115 TWh in 2018, more than both nuclear 
and wind combined.
1 
This average over the summer months (Q2 and Q3) is 3.6 hours of full output per day, and over the winter months (Q1 and Q4) is 1.3 hours per day.

5. Capacity and production statistics
This quarter, four-fifths of Britain’s electricity came from gas, wind and 
nuclear power plants. Low-carbon generation supplied 53% of Britain’s 
electricity (50% from British, and 3% from French plants).
Generation from fossil fuels in the fourth quarter was down 15% year-
on-year, pushed out by lower demand, more imports, and increased 
generation from biomass and wind farms. Coal and gas power stations 
each produced 3 TWh less over the quarter than they did in Q4 2017 – an 
average reduction of 1.4 GW each. For coal, this represents a 40% decline 
on this time last year. 
2018 smashed the record for the number of zero-coal hours on the 
system. No coal generation was used for 1,900 hours during the year 
(equivalent to 79 days), versus just 600 hours in 2017. 
However, less than 0.2 GW of solar panels were installed in 2018, meaning 
the annual growth has flatlined at just 1%. Earlier this year we asked 
whether Britain’s power sector decarbonisation has stalled, and this is 
another signal of the slowdown.
Wholesale electricity prices edged up by £2 from last quarter to again hit 
a 10-year high of £61.45/MWh averaged over the quarter. This price is 25% 
higher than one year ago, and 66% higher than in Q4 2015.

Britain’s electricity supply mix 
in the fourth quarter of 2018
Installed capacity and electricity produced by each technology1

Other statistical sources give different values because of the types of plant they consider. For example, BEIS Energy Trends records an additional 0.7 GW of hydro, 0.6 GW of 
biomass and 3 GW of small waste-to-energy plants. These plants and their output are not visible to the electricity transmission system and so cannot be reported on here.

We include an estimate of the installed capacity of smaller storage devices which are not monitored by the electricity market operator. Britain’s storage capacity is made up 
of 2.9 GW of pumped hydro storage, 0.6 GW of lithium-ion batteries, 0.4 GW of flywheels and 0.3 GW of compressed air.
