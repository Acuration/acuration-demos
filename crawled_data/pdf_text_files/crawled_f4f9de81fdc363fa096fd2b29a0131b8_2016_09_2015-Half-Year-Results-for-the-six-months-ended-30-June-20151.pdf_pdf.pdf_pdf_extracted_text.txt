“While there are elements outside our control, particularly regulatory challenges and weak commodity 
markets, the underlying fundamentals of the Group remain strong. 
“The UK needs to go green in an affordable way, and is looking to Drax to play a significant 
role.  Through our continued transition to sustainable biomass we are Europe’s largest single source 
of renewable energy, powering the UK’s homes and businesses with reliable, low carbon and 
affordable electricity.  
“Drax is uniquely placed to provide a solution to the UK’s needs over the decades ahead and, as 
such, we expect the potential long-term value of the business to become increasingly evident. 
Importantly our business sector requires long-term investment and we need a stable policy and

Chairman’s introduction 
 
It is a genuine privilege to have been appointed Chairman of Drax. I join at an exciting but challenging 
time as the business moves towards the conclusion of its biomass transformation and we begin to 
consider new and complementary business opportunities. 
Drax delivered a strong operational performance in the first half of 2015. Group EBITDA was up 18% 
to £120 million (2014: £102 million), reflecting an increase in biomass generation. However, the 
Group continues to face challenges with returns from wholesale generation due to a low pricing 
environment and reduction in the support for renewable generation. 
Notwithstanding this, the Group has delivered 10.2 pence of underlying earnings per share which, in 
line with our dividend policy, will result in a payment to shareholders of 5.1 pence per share 
(equivalent to £21 million), an 8% increase from 2014 (4.7 pence per share, equivalent to £19 million). 
UK energy policy for the new government continues to focus on the three key pillars of affordability, 
security of supply and carbon emission reduction. Drax occupies a leading and unique position in the 
UK, generating reliable, affordable, low carbon power on a baseload basis from sustainable biomass. 
As the UK's single largest generator of renewable energy, Drax should be a cornerstone of UK 
generation for the long term. We were therefore disappointed and surprised that the recent Budget 
included the removal of the Climate Change Levy exemption for power generated from renewable 
sources. We remain committed to working constructively with UK Government to forge a sustainable 
and stable regulatory framework that encourages and rewards the required investment in our key 
sector. 
I would like to thank my predecessor, Charles Berry, who oversaw the remarkable transformation of 
Drax from a company focused on a single coal fired generating asset, to a group generating 
renewable power at scale,  with integrated upstream and downstream operations. Thanks must also 
go to our former Finance Director, Tony Quinlan, who left the group at the end of June after playing a 
key leadership role in this endeavour. 
As I visit all parts of the Group, I have been struck by the high calibre of individuals at every level of 
the business. Drax has an outstanding management team which in turn is supported by a first class 
group of committed, passionate, and highly capable colleagues. My thanks go to them all for their 
hard work and enthusiasm.

Chief Executive’s overview 
 
Drax has performed extremely well over the period. An 18% increase in EBITDA to £120 million (H1 
2014: £102 million) was driven in part by an increased use of sustainable biomass (37% vs 23% in H1 
2014) which acts as a strong hedge against a rising UK carbon tax.  This increased use of biomass 
confirms our position as Europe’s single largest decarbonisation project and, as evidence of this, in 
the last few days we have abated our 20 millionth tonne of carbon. 
I am pleased with our achievements so far in our biomass transformation project. When we started 
our journey some years ago to convert half of our plant to run on sustainable biomass, many said it 
was too ambitious.  Yet our capable, dedicated and creative team proved the doubters wrong. We are 
well on the way towards completing the transformation and I believe we have achieved something 
unique; delivering reliable and affordable low-carbon electricity at scale from sustainable biomass.    
In the first half our business units all performed well, although we continue to be adversely impacted 
by weak commodity markets and see no improvement in the short term. Haven secured a number of 
significant new contract wins including one with Thames Water with expected revenues of £500 
million in the first five years of the contract. We are optimistic about the potential for growth of the 
nascent UK biomass heating market and in the period acquired Billington Bioenergy, the UK’s second 
largest supplier of biomass for heat.   
The recent announcement by the government that it will remove the Climate Change Levy (CCL) 
exemption for renewable electricity was a shock to the industry, representing an about-turn in a well-
entrenched policy that has been a key underpinning for renewable investments since 2001. The 
immediate impact of this change for Drax will be to reduce EBITDA for 2015 by approximately £30 
million and more in future years. Like many in our sector, and indeed business in general, we long for 
a stable regulatory framework which will allow us to invest in our country’s infrastructure with 
confidence. We continue to work hard with the government to achieve this.   
In recognition of the increased breadth and depth of our Group, on 1 March we reorganised into three 
business units with a dedicated management team for each. This brings a sharper operational focus 
to each business and allows Group functions to find and optimise efficiencies and further develop the 
longer-term strategy.    
We have already made good progress and are confident that we will identify further opportunities to 
improve and to optimise the Group’s operations and financial position. This is particularly important in 
the light of the CCL exemption changes. 
 
The long term value of Drax 
Modern society is fundamentally dependent on a reliable and on-demand supply of electricity. The UK 
now has almost 20GW of installed wind and solar capacity,(1) more than five times the capacity of 
Drax. This is increasing the instability of the grid – and the cost implications are mounting. We 
estimate that the wholesale electricity market equivalent annual sales value of UK electricity is worth 
some £15 billion, of which at least £1 billion is accounted for by the costs of balancing the system. 
This cost is forecast to double over the next five years. 
The drivers for this are straight forward: tighter generation capacity margins coupled with increasing 
intermittent generation. Aggregate wind farm and solar output in the UK can be expected to fall below 
1% of total electricity production with reasonable regularity.(2) However, an electricity supply that 
includes highly variable energy sources can still be reliable overall, so long as there is enough flexible 
plant in the generation mix to respond quickly to changes in the supply/demand balance. If that plant 
can do so in a low carbon manner then it is all the more advantageous.  It is for this reason that we 
believe electricity generated from sustainable biomass should play a central and long-term role in the 
future energy mix of the UK and why we remain convinced of the long-term value inherent within the 
Group.

Our acquisition of Billington Bioenergy reflects the significant potential we foresee for biomass within 
the UK market for heating purposes, provided that government continues to pursue its policy objective 
of material decarbonisation of heat in the UK. As noted above, the Group believes this to be a strong 
growth market and we intend to play a full and active role. The use of biomass for heat in the UK is 
currently less than 1%, which is low compared to European peers (for example, France and 
Germany). With support from the Renewable Heat Incentive (RHI) and increased consumer 
awareness of the benefits of sustainable biomass, the government expect the size of the market to 
increase five-fold by 2020.(3) 
 
Operational update 
Safety  
We have maintained our excellent safety record and in May Drax Power Station was awarded the 
maximum five stars in the British Safety Council’s Five Star Occupational Health and Safety Audit.(4)  
During the five day audit, which is globally benchmarked, auditors reviewed our safety management 
systems, interviewed colleagues and took a site tour and inspection to get a comprehensive picture of 
our health and safety culture. The result was a near perfect score which places us amongst the very 
best in the world. 
Sustainability 
The weight of academic evidence from around the world states that sustainable biomass is 
significantly lower in carbon emissions than coal.  All Drax biomass is sustainable and procured 
against a robust industry leading policy which is independently audited and verified.  We are investing 
in people and resources to promote a wider recognition of the true benefits of low-carbon sustainable 
biomass. 
One step towards this is our work with the Sustainable Biomass Partnership (SBP) a European 
biomass industry-led initiative with a vision to enable an economically, environmentally and socially 
sustainable solid-biomass supply chain that contributes to a low carbon economy. Its core objective(5) 
is to provide an effective mechanism that enables producers and users of solid-biomass for energy 
production to demonstrate compliance with all relevant regulatory and sustainability requirements.  In 
March this year SBP launched in Brussels its sustainability standards for biomass. We and the other 
members of SBP are now working with certification companies and our biomass suppliers to certify 
compliance with these standards for our biomass fuel. 
Drax Power 
At the core of the Group is a very high quality power station which is critical to the security of 
electricity supply in the UK. It performed well over the period with strong generation output from both 
our coal and biomass fired units.  There has been increased prompt market and system balancing 
activity which plays to our strengths and demonstrates our importance to the Grid to ensure system 
stability and security. 
Biomass accounted for 37% of our generation (H1 2014 23%) which in the process generated 
5.2TWh.  Depending upon how our coal units operate over the remainder of the summer and into the 
first half of winter, we expect generation parity between our coal and biomass units over the full year. 
Fuel procurement is a critical core competency for the Group. We have taken steps to increase our 
sourcing of low-nitrogen coal which, together with capital investment and process efficiencies, will 
ensure we meet the new Industrial Emissions Directive which comes into force in 2016.  We also 
continue to improve and to strengthen our biomass sourcing which includes our upstream operations 
in the US. 
We remain affected by the continued weakness in the commodity markets.  Low gas prices continue 
to depress the power markets, although the international coal market also remains weak.  
Drax Biomass 
Our two pellet plants continue to make steady progress. We have been producing our own pellets 
since the start of the year and have successfully dispatched large shipments to the UK which have 
been burnt in our converted units.

The plant at Morehouse is already in commercial operations whilst the plant at Amite is now in the 
final stage of commissioning and will move into commercial operations later this summer.  The port 
facility in Baton Rouge is fully operational, receiving pellets from our facilities as well as third party 
suppliers.  
We continue to evaluate the potential of a third pellet plant in south-eastern USA which would export 
through the Baton Rouge facility. 
Haven Power 
Haven now supplies almost half of the electricity generated by Drax Power to approximately 40,000 
UK business locations; from the very largest FTSE100 companies to firms with just a handful of 
employees.  It is at the forefront of service innovation in the industry and regularly wins new business 
from its much larger competitors, with Thames Water being just one recent example of this. Over the 
period, sales increased to £627 million (H1 2014: £513 million). 
By improving our service and providing the products and services UK business needs, we broaden 
and deepen existing relationships and increase the value that Haven provides to the Group. Over the 
period, renewals amongst industrial and commercial customers remained high. At the same time, the 
credit quality of customers remained healthy with low bad debt experience reflecting our robust 
finance and operational processes. 
 
Regulatory update 
We continue to work with government on regulatory support for biomass. In December the UK’s 
mandatory standards for sustainable biomass are expected to come into effect. As the industry leader 
we are confident of our compliance with these standards.  
We are also engaged with government regarding EU State Aid approval for the contract for difference 
awarded to our 3rd unit conversion as well as progressing discussions on the potential for further unit 
conversions. 
In July the government confirmed its policy intent to suspend grandfathering of the level of support 
under the Renewables Obligation for all new biomass conversions, with the sole exception of projects 
which have been awarded an early contract for difference and are in the process of securing EU State 
Aid approval. This confirms grandfathering protection under the Renewables Obligation for our 3 unit 
original transformation project, but there would be no similar protection for any further unit 
conversions we might consider under this scheme. It is the government’s preference that any future 
unit conversions are supported through its contracts for difference programme. The government has 
advised that it will provide guidance on its future proposals for this programme in the autumn. 
 
Outlook 
The underlying fundamentals of the Group remain strong: we have confidence in our ability to 
generate affordable and reliable renewable energy with sustainable biomass; we have a resilient and 
diverse supply chain; and we play a strategic role in security of supply (which is more complex than 
meeting peak demand).   
With our third unit now modified to enable enhanced co-firing of biomass, our immediate priorities are: 
to complete the commissioning of our two pellet plants in the US; to work closely with the EU for a 
successful outcome to the State aid process; and to continue to strengthen our biomass supply chain. 
As we move towards completion of our biomass transformation, the Group remains alert to new 
opportunities for growth and to create incremental shareholder returns.  We have begun a strategic 
review to consider the long term options for the Group. 
Britain needs affordable decarbonisation. Biomass has a significant role to play in this. Drax stands 
ready and able to convert further units in order to help the country achieve its renewable energy 
objectives in a pragmatic and economical way. We look forward to continuing discussions on this with 
the government.

Operational and financial performance 
 
Introduction 
EBITDA for the six months ended 30 June 2015 was £120 million, compared to £102 million for the 
six months ended 30 June 2014. In summary, this reflects good operations, with increased biomass 
generation protecting the business from the increasing cost of the UK carbon tax. 
Generation (Drax Power) 
Our results for the first half of 2015 were once again supported by good operational performance at 
Drax Power Station. Our two converted biomass units continue to deliver good results and are 
operating in line with plan.  
In response to a changing environment for UK generators, the flexibility of our plant, both coal and 
biomass, has enabled us to extract value where it is available with good performance in the prompt 
and balancing power markets. Flexible plant remains critical to delivering reliable electricity in the UK 
and we are well-placed to provide cost-effective Grid support. 
Biomass Supply (Drax Biomass) 
Upstream in the biomass supply chain at Drax Biomass, our US-based pellet plant assets are making 
steady progress, with one plant in commercial operations and the other moving towards full 
commercial operations later in the summer. Our port facility is now fully operational, with two 
shipments departed for the UK and the pellets successfully processed at Drax Power Station. 
Retail (Haven Power) 
Our electricity retail business, Haven Power, provides the Group with a credit-efficient alternative 
route to market and continues to deliver good volume growth with sales of 6.8TWh in the six months 
to 30 June 2015 compared to 5.6TWh during the same period in 2014. 
In March 2015 we welcomed Billington Bioenergy to the Group. As Billington Bioenergy is the second 
largest operator in the domestic biomass heat market, delivering over 20kt of wood pellets per annum, 
and a focus on sustainability and customer service, we are confident that the acquisition represents a 
good strategic fit with Drax. It is a natural extension to our core biomass business and gives us an 
important opportunity to work with the UK heat sector to ensure that the many benefits of biomass are 
fully understood. 
Group 
Drawing this together, the incremental cost of carbon continues to erode the competitiveness of our 
coal-fired generation capacity with an increase of over 90% in carbon price support rates from 1 April 
2015. However, our biomass investments, both in the US and at Drax Power Station, are beginning to 
bear fruit. The significant carbon savings delivered are also having a positive impact upon our 
financial results. 
Following strong performance during the first six months, the Board has resolved to pay an interim 
dividend of 5.1 pence per share (£21 million) for the six months ended 30 June 2015, compared to 4.7 
pence per share (£19 million) for the six months ended 30 June 2014. 
Our balance sheet at 30 June 2015 is strong, with net debt of £40 million (31 December 2014: £99 
million), including cash and cash-equivalents of £262 million following cash generation of £82 million 
in the first half of the year. 
Climate Change Levy (CCL) 
The announcement in July regarding the removal of the exemption from CCL for power generated from 
renewable sources and associated loss of LEC revenues from 1 August 2015 was a disappointment. 
We estimate that this will reduce Group EBITDA by £30 million in the second half of 2015 and £60 
million in 2016. Thereafter we expect the impact to reduce. As noted by the government in its 
announcement, the value of CCL exemptions is expected to be negligible by the early 2020s. 
As described in the Chief Executive’s overview, following our Group reorganisation completed on 1 
March this year, we have started to identify opportunities to improve operations and profitability, as well 
as to optimise the use of working capital across the Group. This is important in maintaining a strong 
balance sheet in the light of the removal of the CCL exemption.

Our generation business, Drax Power Limited (Drax Power) is the owner and operator of Drax Power 
Station, the largest power station in the UK. Drax Power sells electricity through both the wholesale 
market and our supply company, Haven Power Limited (see Retail, below). 
 
Financial results 
 
Generation revenue 
Total generation revenue for the six months ending 30 June 2015 was £1,246 million compared to 
£1,060 million for the same period in 2014. 
Our generation business recognises revenue for power when it is sold into the wholesale market, or to 
Haven Power. Intra-group sales of power, ROCs and LECs included in the figures above totalled 
£364 million in the first half of 2015, compared to £316 million in the same period last year. 
We can meet our power delivery obligations either by generating the power ourselves or by buying it 
from the market. We purchase power from the market either when it is more economical to do so, or 
to meet delivery obligations that cannot be covered by our own generation. 
Power purchases of £391 million in the first six months of 2015 (H1 2014: £344 million) are included 
within cost of sales and the associated revenue within power sales. Increasing retail sales and low 
wholesale power prices – which result in more instances where it is economical to purchase power in 
the market rather than generate – have contributed to the increase in power purchases compared to 
the same period last year. 
Excluding the cost of power purchased in the market, our power sales revenue of £699 million was 
higher than for the first six months of 2014 (£658 million). This reflects strong generation output, 
which increased 9% to 14.0TWh in the first six months of 2015 from 12.9TWh in 2014, partially offset 
by a small reduction in the average selling price for our power from £51.0 per MWh for the first six 
months of 2014 to £49.9 per MWh in 2015. Whilst wholesale market power prices have, on average, 
fallen over the last 18 months, the timing of our power sales hedges has provided some protection 
from these movements. 
The flexibility of the Drax generating plant has also enabled us to capitalise on opportunities in the 
prompt and balancing markets to deliver additional value. 
 
12 
 
Generation revenue also includes sales of ROCs and LECs totalling £145 million for the six months 
ended 30 June 2015 compared to £38 million for the same period in 2014.  With two converted units 
in operation throughout the period, biomass-fired generation accounted for 37% of our electrical 
output in the first half of 2015, compared to 23% for the same period last year, and we were therefore 
entitled to considerably more ROCs and LECs from our renewable generation. 
The timing of ROC sales is driven by a combination of Renewables Obligation deadlines and 
commercial considerations. We have been increasingly able to utilise available agreements and 
improved liquidity in the ROC market to monetise ROC sales and accelerate the associated cash 
flows. 
These trends are demonstrated in the table below:

The balance at 30 June 2015 includes LECs with a book value of approximately £16 million. We 
expect this amount to be fully recoverable, subject to finalisation of the transitional rules related to the 
CCL changes.  
Ancillary services and Other income include revenues from grid support activities, the sale of fuel and 
sale of by-products from generation (such as ash and gypsum).  
 
Generation cost of sales 
Fuel costs are the primary cost of sales for the generation business. Overall fuel costs are influenced 
by market prices at the time the fuel is secured – most of our fuel is purchased in advance under 
forward purchase contracts – and the mix of fuels burned in a given period. 
As our biomass transformation has progressed, fuel costs have been increasingly influenced by the 
cost of biomass and the value of available renewable support, in the form of ROCs and, until now, 
LECs. This trend will continue with a third unit now modified to burn high levels of biomass at Drax 
Power Station. 
The cost of burning coal has increased over recent years, with the introduction of the Carbon Price 
Support (CPS) mechanism in the UK from 2013 and subsequent annual increases in CPS rates. We 
are also subject to the cost of carbon emissions allowances under the EU Emissions Trading Scheme 
(EU-ETS). 
Whilst biomass is a more expensive raw material than coal, the combination of CPS, emissions 
allowances and renewable support means that biomass is economically advantageous, a fact that 
underpins our transformation strategy. The scale of our biomass generation is now such that it is 
delivering notable carbon savings, and with it reduced expenditure on emissions allowances.

As shown in the table above, fuel costs in respect of generation were £584 million during the six 
months ended 30 June 2015 (H1 2014: £482 million). The average cost of fuel, before the impact of 
carbon and ROC support, was £41.0 per MWh for the first six months of 2015, compared to £37.5 per 
MWh for the same period last year, reflecting the increasing influence of biomass in our fuel mix. 
Biomass accounted for 37% of electrical output in the six months ended 30 June 2015 compared to 
23% in the corresponding period of 2014.  This increase reflects the increase in available capacity of 
our converted units during the first half of 2015, as only one converted unit ran throughout the same 
period last year, with the second modified to high biomass from May 2014.   
Within total fuel costs in respect of generation, net biomass costs are made up of the cost of the fuel 
burnt less the value of renewable support received. The cost of the fuel includes raw material and 
delivery costs. The renewable support reflects the value assigned to ROCs and LECs earned through 
generating electricity from burning biomass. The value of the renewable support therefore reduces the 
overall net cost of biomass.  
When renewable support is taken in to account, the average cost of fuel for the period is £23.7 per 
MWh (H1 2014: £27.2 per MWh). Following the government’s decision to remove the exemption from 
CCL for power generated from renewable sources from 1 August 2015 (as described above), we do 
not expect to be able to claim LECs for our biomass-fired generation after this date. As a result, the 
value of renewable support will fall in future periods. 
Coal was the largest component of our fuel mix, representing 63% of fuel burnt (by energy content) 
for the first half of 2015 (H1 2014: 77%). Despite the reduction in coal as a proportion of our fuel mix, 
consecutive increases in CPS rates from 1 April 2014 and 2015, latterly in excess of 90%, caused our 
overall costs in respect of CPS to increase from £49 million in the first six months of 2014 to £75 
million this year. 
The government has frozen CPS at the current rate until 2020. With a third unit now modified to burn 
high levels of biomass, our transformation should provide further protection against these costs, whilst 
reducing carbon emissions. 
In addition to the UK carbon tax, under Phase III of the EU ETS (2013-2020) we are also required to 
meet the full cost of CO2 emitted from generation through purchases of CO2 emissions allowances in 
the market.   
The increase in the amount of biomass burnt in the six months ended 30 June 2015 has resulted in 
our CO2 emissions reducing from approximately 8.6 million tonnes (with allowances purchased at an 
average price of £5.2 per tonne) in 2014 to approximately 7.5 million tonnes (with allowances 
purchased at an average price of £4.3 per tonne) in 2015. 
The overall impact of carbon (including CPS and EU-ETS emissions allowances) on cost of sales is 
therefore an increase of £15 million when comparing the first six months of 2015 to the same period in 
2014. 
As noted above, when it is more economical to do so, we can meet our power delivery obligations by 
buying power from the market.  In the six months ended 30 June 2015, power purchases totalled 
£391 million compared to £344 million in the same period in 2014.  
Generation cost of sales also includes grid charges of £43 million (H1 2014: £36 million) which 
continue to increase, driven by the impact of higher levels of intermittent generation in the UK energy 
mix, which drives up system balancing costs.

Generation gross margin 
Increasing levels of biomass-fired generation, good bark spreads, good operations and good 
performance in prompt and balancing markets due to the flexibility of the Drax plant, partially offset by 
falling dark green spreads, have contributed to a £30 million increase in generation gross margin, 
from £198 million for the first six months of 2014 to £228 million for the same period this year. 
 
Operating performance 
The safety of our people and contractors is our number one priority. We have delivered another 
period of excellent safety performance at Drax Power Station, against a continuing backdrop of 
significant construction and project activity. Our financial results have once again been underpinned 
by strong operational performance in the six months ended 30 June 2015, reflected in electrical 
output of 14.0TWh, a 9% increase from 12.9TWh in the first half of 2014. 
 
Generation - health and safety 
Our safety performance at Drax Power Station remains industry-leading, with a lost time injury rate 
(LTIR) and total recordable injury rate (TRIR) of 0.05 and 0.1 respectively in the first six months of 
2015, compared to 0.04 and 0.14 for the same period in 2014. 
 
Generation - biomass plant 
Our first two converted units have operated to plan in the first half of the year and as a result electrical 
output from biomass generation was 5.2TWh, an increase of 73% from 3.0TWh for the same period in 
2014.  
The increase reflects the modification to burn over 85% biomass in place of coal (high-biomass) and 
subsequent conversion of our second biomass unit, which took place in May and October in 2014 
respectively. 
A third unit has now undergone modification to run as a high-biomass unit. This work was completed 
in July 2015 and is being followed by the first major scheduled outage for the first unit we converted to 
run solely on biomass in April 2013. This is a routine operation, but the first of its kind at Drax Power 
Station. 
 
Generation - coal plant 
We have continued to realise good operating performance from our coal units which has enabled us 
to extract value from the prompt and balancing markets. Generation from coal-fired capacity was 
8.8TWh in the first six months of 2015 compared to 9.9TWh for the same period last year, the 
decrease reflecting the biomass conversion activity described above.  
None of our coal units are scheduled for a major outage this year.

Our retail businesses, Haven Power and Billington Bioenergy, comprise the Retail segment. Haven 
Power sells electricity to business consumers predominantly situated in the industrial and commercial 
(I&C) and small and medium-sized enterprise (SME) sectors. Billington Bioenergy supplies wood 
pellets both to commercial and domestic customers. 
 
Acquisition of Billington Bioenergy 
On 4 March 2015 the Group acquired 100% of the equity of Billington Bioenergy for a total 
consideration of £4 million. 
Billington Bioenergy distributes both loose bulk blown and bagged pellets throughout the UK, 
providing a platform for the Group to enter the UK domestic heat market and also strategic options for 
the Group’s supply of sustainable wood pellets for heat and power generation. 
Further details relating to the acquisition can be found in note 10 to the condensed consolidated 
financial statements. 
The post-acquisition financial results of Billington Bioenergy (sales of £2 million and EBITDA of £nil) 
are included within the Retail segment and discussed in further detail below. 
 
Strategic value of Haven Power 
The strategic value of Haven Power has been in providing a credit-efficient alternative route to market 
for the power, ROCs and LECs generated by Drax Power. 
ROCs earned by generating electricity from burning biomass can be utilised by Haven Power through 
its sales of power. In addition, Haven has historically supplied levy exempt power, utilising the LECs 
earned by burning biomass. 
As described above, in July the government announced the removal of the exemption from CCL for 
power generated from renewable sources, resulting in the loss of LEC revenues from 1 August 2015. 
We are reviewing our sales and marketing strategy at Haven following these changes. 
In selling power into the retail market, rather than wholesale, the Group swaps collateral risk for credit 
risk, which is more controllable. Haven Power actively manages credit risk by assessing the financial 
strength of its customers and applying rigorous credit management processes, reflected in very low 
bad debt experience to date.  
The business has a strong focus on cash collection and working capital. This focus, combined with 
sales volume growth, continues to result in Haven Power being a net cash contributor to the Group. 
 
16 
 
Financial results 
 
Retail revenue 
Haven Power 
Movements in key financial metrics for Haven Power are underpinned by continued good volume 
growth. We delivered net sales volume growth (at customer meter) of 21% in the first six months of 
2015 when compared to the same period in the previous year (6.8TWh up from 5.6TWh). 
As a result of this growth, revenue from sales of electricity increased to £627 million at an average 
price of £92.2 per MWh (H1 2014: £513 million at an average price of £91.6 per MWh). 
Much of this growth has come in the larger but more competitive I&C market. Many larger I&C 
customers are signed up to flexible contracts where the customer decides when to fix the price of their 
power, or to leave it to day or month ahead prices. Although wholesale prices have been lower than in 
the same six-month period last year, increases in other third party costs of sales resulted in an overall 
increase in the average price of retail power sales. 
Haven Power’s business is built upon its reputation for good customer service, which has supported 
the sales growth and resulted in strong renewals performance in the I&C sector. 
 
Billington Bioenergy 
Sales of pellets by Billington Bioenergy were in line with expectations following the acquisition in 
March at 9kt. Revenues totalled £2 million, at an average price of £202 per tonne. The sales reflect 
the seasonal nature of the business, with significantly higher volumes expected over the winter 
period. Rolling 12-month sales for the business show volume growth greater than 40%. 
For the segment, total revenue for the Retail business for the six months ending 30 June 2015 was 
£629 million, compared to £513 million for the same period in 2014. 
 
Retail cost of sales 
Haven Power 
Total power purchases in Haven Power increased to £353 million, compared to £305 million in the 
first six months of 2014, primarily as a result of the increase in sales volumes described above. The 
business purchases most of its power requirement intra-group from Drax Power at market equivalent 
prices. Accordingly the average price paid of £51.9 per MWh in the six-months ending 30 June 2015 
fell from £54.4 per MWh for the same period in 2014, reflecting changes in wholesale prices between 
these two periods. 
Grid charges include costs of distribution, transmission and system balancing. 
The rates charged by the network and system operators for transmission costs have increased; 
however distribution costs have decreased compared to the first six months of 2014. The increased 
incidence of intermittent generation (notably wind and solar) in the UK energy mix has increased 
system balancing costs. As a result, total grid charges in the six months ending 30 June 2015 were 
£143 million, compared to £117 million for the same period in 2014. 
Other retail costs of sales include the cost of meeting our obligations under the Renewables 
Obligation, small scale feed-in-tariff schemes and the cost of LECs required to deliver renewable or 
levy exempt power to our customers. 
In April 2015 the costs of the Renewables Obligation increased from £10.6 per MWh to £12.9 per 
MWh sold, an increase of over 20%. Compared to the previous year, first-quarter small-scale feed-in-
tariff costs increased by 44%. LEC costs continued to rise in line with sales volume. 
Total third party costs (grid charges and other retail costs of sales), at £268 million, represented 43% 
of the overall costs of retail power supply in the first six months of 2015 (H1 2014: £202 million, 40% 
of the total costs of retail power supply). 
Billington Bioenergy 
Cost of sales in Billington Bioenergy primarily represent the cost of pellets purchased and are 
included in Other retail costs in the table above. In the six months ended 30 June 2015, such costs 
were £1 million, at an average price of £161 per tonne. 
17 
 
Total cost of sales for the Retail segment in the six-months ending 30 June 2015 were therefore £621 
million, compared to £507 million the same period in 2014. 
 
Retail gross margin 
The markets in which Haven Power operates continue to be very competitive. It is such challenging 
trading conditions that ultimately drive the gross margin performance of the Retail business. 
During the period under review, volume growth has resulted in increased gross margin; however the 
significant increase in third party costs led to pressure on margins from fixed price sales. 
Billington Bioenergy will continue to make modest contributions to the gross margin of the Retail 
segment whilst our growth plans for the business are executed. 
The Retail gross margin for the six-months ending 30 June 2015 was £8 million, compared to £7 
million for the same period in 2014.

Biomass Supply 
Our biomass supply business, Drax Biomass, manufactures wood pellets which can be used to 
generate renewable low-carbon power from sustainable biomass. Drax Biomass sells its pellets intra-
group to Drax Power (see Generation, above). 
 
Financial results 
Biomass Supply gross margin 
Revenues within Drax Biomass are entirely intra-group and reflect pellets shipped to Drax Power in 
the UK. The first shipment of pellets to Drax Power Station took place during the period. Sales of 
pellets in the six months ended 30 June 2015 totalled £6.1 million. All intra-group sales of pellets are 
made on arms-length commercial terms. 
Raw fibre costs make up the majority of the costs of sale of the Biomass Supply business. Such costs 
have been higher than expected as we progress through the start-up and commissioning phase, but 
are forecast to fall as fully optimised operations are delivered. 
As a result of the above factors, the gross margin for the Biomass Supply business was £1.6 million 
negative in the six months ended 30 June 2015.  
 
Operating performance 
The port facility at Baton Rouge, Louisiana is now complete and fully operational. Large shipments 
have been successfully loaded and dispatched to the UK.  
Our two pellet plant facilities, in Amite, Mississippi and Morehouse, Louisiana, are making steady 
progress. The plant at Morehouse is now fully commissioned with the plant at Amite operational and 
moving towards full commercial operations later in the summer. 
Biomass Supply health and safety 
We continue to work hard in the US to bring health and safety performance into line with our 
performance in the UK and progress has been positive during the first half. Significant project work 
has continued during the commissioning phase with an LTIR and TRIR of 0.00 and 0.71 respectively.

condensed consolidated financial statements. 
Consolidated gross profit 
After adjusting for profits on intra-group trading (see note 2 to the condensed consolidated financial 
statements) Group consolidated gross profit for the six months ending 30 June 2015 was £234 
million, compared to £204 million for the same period in 2014. 
This principally reflects strong operating performance in the Generation business, as described 
above. 
Group operating and administrative expenses 
Group operating and administrative expenses before depreciation were £114 million for the six 
months ended 30 June 2015 compared to £102 million in 2014, principally reflecting higher operating 
costs in the Biomass Supply business as plant commissioning proceeded and the timing of non-
outage maintenance costs in the Generation business. 
We continue to control closely our underlying cost base. 
 
 
20 
 
 
Group EBITDA 
Group EBITDA is a function of the factors influencing the gross margin and operating expenses 
described above.  
Therefore, Group EBITDA for the first six months of 2015 was £120 million, an increase of 18% from 
£102 million for the same period in 2014. 
Further segmental information is provided in note 3 to the condensed consolidated financial 
statements. 
 
Depreciation 
Depreciation and amortisation was £50 million for the six months ended 30 June 2015 and £42 million 
for the six months ended 30 June 2014.   
 
Unrealised gains and losses on derivative contracts 
The Group enters into forward contracts for the sale and purchase of commodities, including the sale 
of power and purchase of fuel (incorporating coal, biomass and carbon emissions allowances), in 
order to secure market level dark green and bark spreads on future sales. 
Where purchases of fuel are denominated in foreign currencies or have variable indexation elements, 
the Group enters into financial forward contracts to fix the future Sterling cost of these supplies. 
Collectively these contracts aim to de-risk the business, providing secure cash flows into the future. 
Full details of our trading strategy and the accounting applied to financial instruments, such as 
commodity contracts and forward currency contracts, are described in the Group’s 2014 Annual 
Report and Accounts on pages 39-40. 
Unrealised losses on derivative contracts recognised through the income statement for the first six 
months ended 30 June 2015 were £3 million, compared to unrealised losses of £56 million in the first 
half of 2014. The movement in both periods was driven largely by the change in value of our forward 
currency contracts, which reflects the strengthening of Sterling against foreign currencies, principally 
the US dollar. 
As much of our fuel is now purchased in foreign currencies and under long-term contracts, relatively 
small changes in market exchange rates can result in significant volatility in this line. 
 
Interest 
Net finance costs for the six months ended 30 June 2015, at £14 million, were broadly in line with £15 
million for the same period in 2014.  
More information regarding our funding structure is included within Liquidity and capital resources, 
below. 
 
Profit/loss before tax 
Profit before tax for the six months ended 30 June 2015 was £53 million compared to a loss of £11 
million in the prior period.   
The increase reflects the £30 million increase in gross margin and resulting positive EBITDA 
described above and a reduction in unrealised losses on derivative contracts, offset to some extent by 
increased depreciation charges. 
Underlying profit before tax, which excludes the effect of unrealised gains and losses on derivative 
contracts, amounted to £56 million for the six months ended 30 June 2015 compared to £45 million in 
2014.

The tax charge on the profit before tax for the six months ended 30 June 2015 was £14 million (H1 
2014: credit of £4 million). 
The tax charge arising on underlying profit before tax (excluding the after tax impact of unrealised 
gains and losses on derivatives contracts) for the six months, of £15 million, reflects an average 
effective tax rate applicable for the period of 26%. This charge is higher than the standard rate of tax 
in the UK of 20.25%, as the tax value of the start-up costs of the Biomass Supply business is not 
recognised in the tax charge until final commissioning of the US pellet plants is complete.  
The comparative period reflected an effective tax rate on underlying profit of 16%, which was lower 
than the standard rate of tax in the UK of 21.5%, due to a small adjustment for prior year taxes.  
In the Summer Budget 2015, the government proposed a reduction in the rate of corporation tax from 
20% to 19% from 1 April 2017, and a further rate reduction to 18% from 1 April 2020. These 
reductions have not been recognised in the condensed consolidated financial statements as they had 
not been substantively enacted at the balance sheet date. Once legislated, this will give rise to tax 
credits as we revalue our net deferred tax liability. 
As a result, it is likely that our underlying effective tax rate for the full year will be well below the 
standard rate of tax in the UK.  In future years we would expect our underlying tax rates to be closer 
to the standard UK corporate tax rate. 
 
Profit/loss after tax and earnings per share 
Profit after tax for the six months ended 30 June 2015 was £39 million, compared to a loss of £7 
million for the same period in 2014, resulting in basic earnings per share of 10 pence in 2015 
compared to a loss per share of 2 pence in 2014. 
Underlying profit after tax, which strips out the impact of gains or losses on derivative contracts and 
the associated tax, for the six months ended 30 June 2015 was £41 million, compared to £38 million 
for the same period in 2014, resulting in underlying earnings per share in 2015 of 10 pence per share, 
compared to 9 pence in 2014.

Cash generated from operations 
Cash generated from operations was £199 million in the six months ended 30 June 2015 compared to 
£64 million in 2014.  This cash movement reflects an £18 million increase in EBITDA, combined with 
a substantial inflow from working capital. In Drax Power, coal stocks have been actively reduced both 
as a consequence of biomass conversion activity and as part of our plan to meet the requirements of 
the EU’s Industrial Emissions Directive from the start of 2016. 
Offsetting these inflows, we continued to generate substantially more ROCs and LECs as our 
proportion of biomass generation increases. ROCs and LECs earned from renewable generation can 
drive significant working capital absorption, with the cash received typically up to 12 months after 
burning the associated biomass. We have access to ROC monetisation agreements with a total value 
of £200 million, secured with HSBC and Lloyds, which enhance our capability to accelerate ROC cash 
flows by selling ROC receivables. We continue to explore ways to minimise the working capital impact 
of ROCs. 
23 
 
Net cash flows from operating activities 
Other gains/losses includes the net £20 million paid in settlement of our obligations under CESP, as 
described on page 39 of the 2014 Annual Report and Accounts. 
Cash taxes paid in the six months ended 30 June 2015 were £2 million (H1 2014: £7 million), with the 
reduction from the same period in 2014 reflecting the utilisation of increased capital allowances 
arising from our investment in biomass infrastructure. 
Net cash used in investing activities 
Cash paid in relation to purchases of property, plant and equipment of £73 million in the six months 
ended 2015 (H1 2014: £120 million) was higher than fixed asset additions in the period, reflecting the 
timing of cash payments for assets acquired in the previous year. The level of expenditure continued 
to reflect the significant amount of investment across the business as we progress our biomass 
transformation. However, as we approach the completion of our project to convert three units to run 
on biomass, the overall level of capital expenditure is expected to fall. 
Short-term investments are cash deposits with a maturity of three months or greater at inception. In 
the six months ended 30 June 2015, £20 million of such deposits matured. 
Net cash flows from financing activities 
Equity dividends paid during the period amounted to £29 million (H1 2014: £36 million). 
 
Net debt 
The increase of £82 million in cash and cash equivalents in the six months ended 30 June 2015, 
compared to a decrease of £8 million in 2014, was driven by reductions in working capital and  capital 
expenditure.  As such, net debt (after deduction of borrowings and allowing for short-term 
investments) is £40 million compared to £99 million at the end of 2014.  
 
Financing and cash flow management 
Our Group financing structure consists of a private placement for £100 million with various funds 
managed by M&G Investments agreed last year, a £75 million amortising term loan facility with 
Friends Life, underpinned by a guarantee from HM Treasury under the Infrastructure UK Guarantee 
Scheme, a £50 million amortising term loan from the Green Investment Bank, a £100 million 
amortising term loan facility with the M&G UK Companies Financing Fund and a £400 million working 
capital and letter of credit facility. The loans have varying maturity profiles ranging from 2017 to 2025, 
whilst the working capital and letter of credit facility is due to mature in April 2017. 
All of the term loans in our funding structure, totalling £325 million, were fully drawn down at 30 June 
2014, 31 December 2014 and 30 June 2015. Utilisation of the working capital and letter of credit 
facility at 30 June 2015 was £49 million (H1 2014: £63 million), relating entirely to letters of credit, 
In addition, we have a commodity trading facility, which allows us to transact prescribed volumes of 
commodity trades at attractive prices without the requirement to post collateral.  
 
Capital expenditure 
Fixed asset additions were £54 million in the six months ended 30 June 2015 (H1 2014 £123 million). 
As noted above, capital expenditure has reduced from the previous period as we approach the end of 
our project to convert three units to biomass at Drax Power Station and construct the supporting US 
pellet supply facilities. Total capital expenditure on the project to date, including two converted units, 
the supporting on-site infrastructure, rail wagons and our US port facility and pellet plants amounts to 
approximately £580 million. 
We expect to spend a further £100 million over the period to 2017 concluding this project, including 
full conversion of a third unit, and ensuring compliance with the requirements of the EU’s Industrial 
Emissions Directive (IED). The project continues to be in line with our original cost guidance of £650 
million - £700 million. 
Our lead case investment for IED compliance remains unchanged, incorporating the implementation 
of low nitrogen oxide burners and selective-non-catalytic-reduction technology across all units.

Other information 
 
Post balance sheet event 
On 8 July 2015 the UK Government announced the removal of the Climate Change Levy (CCL) 
exemption for renewably sourced electricity from 1 August 2015. As a result of this change we will no 
longer earn Levy Exemption Certificates (LECs) by generating electricity from biomass from this date. 
We expect a material reduction in full-year EBITDA of approximately £30 million in 2015, and £60 
million in 2016 as a result of this change. Beyond this horizon the impact should reduce progressively 
until it becomes negligible in the early 2020s. 
There is a transitional period commencing on 1 August 2015 during which the CCL exemption can be 
claimed for renewable power generated before this date. The length of the transitional period is to be 
announced following a consultation with affected stakeholders. We expect this period to be sufficient 
to realise all of the LECs we will generate before 1 August 2015 and, as a result, the value of our 
existing LECs on the balance sheet at 30 June 2015 (£16 million) is not affected by this change.  
 
Going concern 
The Group’s business activities, together with the factors likely to affect future developments, 
performance and position including principal risks and uncertainties are set out in the Chief 
Executive’s statement, this Operational and financial performance section, and the principal risks and 
uncertainties as set out in our 2014 Annual Report and Accounts (pages 46 - 49). Our cash flows and 
borrowing facilities are described above. In addition, notes 20 to 22 to the consolidated financial 
statements contained within the 2014 Annual Report and Accounts explain our approach to capital 
risk management and give details of financial instruments and hedging activities, and exposure to 
credit, counterparty and liquidity risk. 
We presently have significant headroom in our banking facilities, a recent history of cash generation, 
strong covenant compliance, and good visibility in near-term forecasts due to our progressive hedging 
strategy. Our business plan takes account of our capital investment plans and reasonably possible 
changes in trading performance, including sensitivity analysis on downside scenarios. 
Recently announced changes to the support regime for renewable power in the UK (above) have 
resulted in a reduction of approximately £90 million in our expected revenues, cash flow and EBITDA 
over the period to 31 December 2016. We have revised our plans and projections to take account of 
the impact of these changes and have assessed the nature and extent of actions required to ensure 
that the viability of the Group is not at risk for the foreseeable future. We have also considered 
reasonably possible further downside scenarios. 
We are satisfied that we will be able to operate within the level of our current banking facilities, will 
remain compliant with our covenants and will have sufficient cash to meet our obligations as they fall 
due for the foreseeable future. 
Accordingly, the directors have a reasonable expectation that the Group has adequate resources to 
continue in operational existence for the foreseeable future, and continue to prepare the financial 
statements on a going concern basis. 
 
Seasonality of borrowing 
Our business is seasonal with higher electricity prices and despatch in the winter period and lower 
despatch in the summer months, when prices are lower and plant availability is affected by planned 
outages. 
 
Accordingly, cash flow during the summer months is materially reduced due to the combined effect of 
lower prices and output, while maintenance expenditures are increased during this period due to 
major planned outages. The Group’s £400 million working capital and letter of credit facility assists in 
managing the cash low points in the cycle if required. 
 
Future developments 
We remain committed to our strategy to convert three units to run solely on biomass with the funding 
platform in place to achieve this. Our capital expenditure projects to deliver and support this ambition 
remain on budget and we are well set to deliver a stronger business. 
25 
 
Two of our remaining coal units were successful in the first capacity market auction in December 
2014, with the first capacity payments expected to commence in 2018.

Distributions 
 
Distribution policy 
The Board has previously committed to target a pay-out ratio of 50% of underlying earnings (being 
profit attributable to equity shareholders adjusted to exclude the after tax impact of unrealised gains 
and losses on derivative contracts) in each year. Underlying earnings for the period ending 30 June 
2015 were £41 million (H1 2014: £38 million). 
 
Dividends paid 
On 17 February 2015, the Board resolved, subject to approval by shareholders at the Annual General 
Meeting on 22 April 2015, to pay a final dividend for the year ended 31 December 2014 of 7.2 pence 
per share (£29 million). The final dividend was subsequently paid on 15 May 2015. 
 
Dividends proposed 
On 27 July 2015, the Board resolved to pay an interim dividend for the six months ended 30 June 
2015 of 5.1 pence per share (£21 million), representing 50% of underlying earnings for the period. 
The interim dividend will be paid on or before 9 October 2015 and shares will be marked ex-interim 
dividend on 24 September 2015. 
 
Principal risks and uncertainties 
We manage the commercial and operational risks faced by the Group in accordance with policies 
approved by the Board. We set out in our 2014 Annual report and accounts (pages 46 - 49) the 
principal risks and uncertainties that could impact performance.  These risks remain unchanged, and 
are as follows: 
 
 
Commodity market price risk 
 
Counterparty risk 
 
Regulatory and political risk 
 
Power and renewables market liquidity risk 
 
Biomass market risk 
 
Plant operating risk 
 
Our progressive hedging strategy, which includes forward power and ROC sales combined with 
corresponding purchases of fuel and CO2 emissions allowances, provides some protection against 
continued weak commodity markets. We also keep the operating cost base of the Group under 
constant review, making adjustments when appropriate, and take opportunities to optimise value from 
our trading activities as they arise. 
We continue to promote the benefits of biomass and are engaged with government at both UK and 
EU level to ensure the Group’s views and positions on current and forthcoming legislation and 
regulations, and on energy and environmental policy issues that may have implications for our 
business, are represented.

Related parties 
The Group set out in its 2014 Annual Report and Accounts (page 140) the related party transactions 
arising which were in relation to remuneration of management personnel and transactions with 
Capture Power Limited, a joint venture in which the Group is a venturer. There have been no new 
related party transactions, other than the remuneration of key management personnel and 
transactions with Capture Power Limited, since 31 December 2014. 
 
This Operational and financial performance review was approved by the Board on 27 July 2015.

Notes to the condensed consolidated financial statements 
 
1. General information 
These notes provide additional detail on the disclosures within the condensed consolidated financial 
statements. Further information, and a full set of explanations, can be found in our 2014 Annual 
Report and Accounts on pages 105 – 140. Throughout the notes, we have included explanations of 
the information presented.  
Drax Group plc (the “Company”) is incorporated in England and Wales under the Companies Act. 
The Company and its subsidiaries (together the “Group”) predominantly operate in the electricity 
generation and supply industry within the UK. The address of the Company’s registered office and 
principal establishment is Drax Power Station, Selby, North Yorkshire YO8 8PH, United Kingdom. 
 
2. Basis of preparation 
This section describes the accounting standards we have followed in preparing these financial 
statements and the interpretation of those accounting standards into accounting policies which are 
relevant to our Group. We have not changed any of our accounting policies in the period, nor have 
any new accounting standards had a material effect on our financial statements. 
The condensed consolidated financial statements have been prepared using accounting policies 
consistent with International Financial Reporting Standards (“IFRSs”) as adopted by the EU and in 
accordance with IAS 34 “Interim Financial Reporting”. The information provided in respect of year 
ended 31 December 2014 does not constitute statutory accounts as defined in Section 434 of the 
Companies Act 2006. A copy of the statutory accounts for that year has been delivered to the 
Registrar of Companies. The auditor’s report on those accounts was not qualified, did not draw 
attention to any matters by way of emphasis and did not contain statements under Section 498(2) or 
(3) of the Companies Act 2006. 
The condensed consolidated financial statements have been prepared on the going concern basis, as 
explained in Operational and financial performance, and on the historical cost basis, except for certain 
assets and liabilities that have been measured at fair value (principally derivative financial instruments 
– see note 7). 
The condensed consolidated financial statements were approved by the Board on 27 July 2015. 
 
Presentation of segmental reporting 
In our preliminary results for the year ended 31 December 2014, we announced a change in our 
organisational structure, effective from 1 March 2015, to reflect the three business units that form our 
Group. At the same time, the management reporting used by the Group’s chief operating decision 
maker, considered to be the Board, was amended to provide financial information across these three 
business units. 
Accordingly, the segmental reporting provided both in note 3 to these condensed consolidated 
financial statements and in the narrative reporting in Operational and financial performance is now 
based on these three business units. The Biomass Supply segment, which is wholly comprised of our 
US biomass manufacturing operation, was previously reported as part of the Generation segment. 
Operating costs are allocated to segments to the extent they are directly attributable to the activities of 
that segment. Unallocated costs are included within central operating costs. 
Prior period comparatives have been restated to the extent the information is available. Costs were 
entirely allocated to business units in previous periods. 
 
Intra-group trading 
Intra-group transactions are carried out on arms-length, commercial terms that where possible equate 
to market prices at the time of the transaction. During the period, Drax Biomass Inc. (Biomass Supply) 
sold wood pellets with a total value of £6.1 million to Drax Power Limited (Generation) and Drax 
Power Limited sold power, ROCs and LECs with a total value of £364.1 million to Haven Power 
Limited (Retail). In addition, within the Generation segment, Drax Fuel Supply Limited sold coal to 
Drax Power Limited. 
34 
 
The impact of all intra-group transactions, including any unrealised profit arising (£0.5 million at 30 
June 2015), is eliminated on consolidation. 
 
Adoption of new and revised accounting standards 
In 2014, a number of new standards and interpretations became effective as noted in the 2014 
Annual Report and Accounts (page 107). The adoption of these standards and interpretations has not 
had a material impact on the financial statements of the Group.  
Since the 2014 Annual Report and Accounts were published one new standard (Annual 
improvements to IFRS 2011-2013 cycle) became effective during the first 6 months of 2015. The 
adoption of this standard has not had a material impact on the financial statements of the Group. 
The accounting policies adopted in the preparation of the financial information presented here are 
consistent with those followed in the preparation of the Group’s consolidated financial statements for 
the year ended 31 December 2014. 
 
3. Segmental reporting 
On 1 March 2015, reflecting the evolution and growth of the Group, the Group reorganised into three 
business units with a dedicated management team for each; the generation of electricity at Drax 
Power Station (Generation), production of sustainable wood pellets at our processing facilities in the 
US (Biomass Supply) and the supply of power to business customers and wood pellets to the 
domestic heat market (Retail). Each of these business units is considered to be an operating segment 
for the purpose of segmental reporting. 
Following the reorganisation, information reported to the Board for the purposes of assessing 
performance and making investment decisions is organised into these three operating segments. The 
measure of profit or loss for each reportable segment presented to the Board on a regular basis is 
EBITDA, with sales between segments being carried out at arm’s length.

The accounting policies of the reportable segments are the same as the Group’s accounting policies 
which are described in the Group’s latest Annual report and accounts. The revenue and results of all 
segments are subject to seasonality as detailed in the Operational and financial performance section. 
 
 
36 
 
Interest, tax, assets and working capital are monitored on a Group basis with no separate disclosure 
by segment made in the management accounts, and hence no separate asset disclosure is provided 
in this report. However, spend on key capital projects is monitored. Total spend on the biomass 
transformation project during the first 6 months of 2015 was £28 million (H1 2014: £87 million), of 
which £11 million related to construction of assets within our US business. 
 
Major customers 
Total revenue for the six months ended 30 June 2015 includes amounts of £221.5 million and  £173.8 
million derived from two customers, each representing 10% or more of the Group’s revenue for the 
period (H1 2014: no major customers representing 10% or more of the Group’s revenue). 
 
4. Taxation 
The tax charge reflects an estimate of the corporation tax payable/(receivable) as a result of our 
activities during the period, including both current and deferred tax. Current tax is the amount payable 
on taxable profits (profit before tax adjusted for items upon which we are not required to pay tax, or in 
some cases for items upon which we are required to pay additional tax in respect of tax-disallowed 
expenditure) in the period. Deferred tax is an accounting adjustment which reflects where more or 
less tax is expected to arise in the future due to differences between the accounting and tax rules. 
In the Summer Budget 2015, the government proposed a reduction in the rate of corporation tax from 
20% to 19% from 1 April 2017 and a further rate reduction to 18% from 1 April 2020. These 
reductions have not been recognised in the condensed consolidated financial statements as they had 
not been substantively enacted at the balance sheet date. Once legislated, this will give rise to tax 
credits as we revalue our net deferred tax liability.

Deferred tax assets are recognised to the extent that the realisation of the related tax benefit through 
future associated taxable profits is probable. The Group has not recognised deferred tax assets with 
an estimated value of £13 million at 30 June 2015 (2014: £10 million) in respect of UK and US losses 
and other temporary differences that are carried forward to offset against future taxable income.  
 
5. Dividends 
Dividends are amounts we return to our shareholders and are paid as an amount per ordinary share. 
Our current dividend policy is to return 50% of underlying earnings (see note 6) to our shareholders 
each year. The remaining 50% is retained for reinvestment in the future growth of the business.

On 27 July 2015, the Board resolved to pay an interim dividend for the six months ended 30 June 
2015 of 5.1 pence per share (equivalent to approximately £21 million) on or before 9 October 2015. 
The interim dividend has not been included as a liability as at 30 June 2015. 
 
 
6. Earnings per share 
Earnings/(loss) per share (“EPS”) represents the amount of our earnings (post-tax profits) attributable 
to each ordinary share or dilutive potential ordinary share we have in issue. Basic EPS is calculated 
by dividing our earnings by the weighted average number of ordinary shares in issue during the 
period. Diluted EPS demonstrates the impact upon the basic EPS if all outstanding share options, that 
are expected to vest on their future maturity dates, were exercised and treated as ordinary shares as 
at the balance sheet date. 
In addition to EPS, we calculate underlying EPS because it reflects the figures upon which our annual 
dividends are calculated (note 5). Underlying EPS strips out the post-tax effect of fair value 
movements on derivative contracts and any one-off items (such as the CESP settlement in 2014) 
from earnings. Multiplying underlying basic EPS by 50% will give the dividend per share for the 
period. 
Reconciliations of the earnings and weighted average number of shares used in the calculation are 
set out below.

7. Derivative financial instruments 
The accounting rules for derivative contracts are complex. Where such contracts do not qualify for the 
own use exemption (described on page 121 in our 2014 Annual report and accounts) we account for 
them at fair value, which is in essence the difference between the price we have secured in the 
contract and the price we could achieve in the market at the balance sheet date. The tables and 
commentary below provide additional information about how these valuations are determined and the 
changes in underlying market conditions that drive their movements. 
The fair values of the Group’s derivative financial instruments which are marked to market and 
recorded in the balance sheet were as follows:

Contracts for the delivery of commodities are entered into to secure market-level dark green and bark 
spreads on future power sales. 
Financial contracts are principally comprised of forward foreign currency exchange contracts utilised 
to secure future Sterling cash flows on commodity purchases denominated in foreign currencies. 
As described in our latest Annual Report and Accounts on page 123, the fair value of commodity 
contracts and financial contracts is largely determined by comparison between forward market prices 
and the contract price. These contracts have therefore been grouped into Level 2 within the fair value 
hierarchy in their entirety. 
The Group has no financial instruments with fair values derived solely from unadjusted quoted prices 
(Level 1) or unobservable inputs (Level 3). There have been no transfers of any assets or liabilities 
between levels of the fair value hierarchy during the current or preceding period. 
The balance sheet position of the Group’s derivative financial instruments has deteriorated slightly in 
the first half of 2015. As described in Operational and financial performance, currency exchange rates 
are the key driver behind our derivative position. Sterling strengthened against each of our primary 
foreign currencies during the period, resulting in unrealised losses being recognised on the balance 
sheet. 
 
8. Other financial instruments 
We hold a variety of other non-derivative financial instruments, including cash and cash equivalents, 
borrowings, payables and receivables arising from our operations. 
Fair value 
Cash and cash equivalents, short-term investments, trade and other receivables, and trade and other 
payables generally have short times to maturity. For this reason, their carrying values approximate to 
their fair value. The Group’s borrowings relate principally to amounts drawn down against term loans, 
the carrying amounts of which approximate their fair values by virtue of being floating rate 
instruments. 
 
9. Hedge reserve 
Changes in the fair value of our derivative contracts for purchases and sales of commodities and 
foreign currencies, to the extent that they qualify as effective cash flow hedges under accounting rules 
are recognised within the hedge reserve, a component of shareholder’s equity. The cumulative gains 
and losses unwind and are released to the income statement as the related contracts mature and we 
take delivery of the associated commodity or currency. 
The Group designates certain hedging instruments used to address commodity price risk and foreign 
exchange risk as cash flow hedges. At the inception of the hedge, the relationship between the 
hedging instrument and hedged item is documented, along with its risk management objectives. 
Furthermore, at the inception of the hedge and on an ongoing basis, the Group documents whether 
the hedging instruments used in hedging transactions are highly effective in offsetting changes in 
cash flows of hedged items.  
Changes in fair value of contracts designated into such hedging relationships are recognised within 
the hedge reserve to the extent they are effective, ineffectiveness is recognised in the income 
statement. 
Amounts held within the hedge reserve are then released as the related contract matures and the 
hedged transaction impacts profit or loss. For commodity contracts, this is when the underlying 
commodity is delivered. For financial contracts this is when the associated foreign currency 
transaction is recognised.

10.  Acquisition of subsidiary 
On 4 March 2015, the Group acquired 100% of the issued share capital of Billington Bioenergy 
Limited (Billington Bioenergy), obtaining control of the company. Billington Bioenergy is a wood pellet 
distributor in the UK renewable fuelled heating market.  It gives us an important opportunity to work 
with the UK heat sector to ensure that the many benefits of biomass are fully understood. We hope to 
drive substantial growth in this market over the coming years.   
The provisional amounts recognised in respect of the identifiable assets acquired and liabilities 
assumed are as set out in the table below:

The acquisition consideration of £4.0 million was settled entirely in cash, with no deferred or 
contingent consideration payable. 
No cash or cash equivalents were acquired, therefore the net cash outflow on acquisition was £4.0 
million. 
Billington Bioenergy contributed revenues of £1.8 million and EBITDA of £nil to the results of the 
Group in the period between the acquisition date and the balance sheet date.

Total goodwill on the condensed consolidated balance sheet at 30 June 2015 was £14.5 million, with 
£10.7 million attributable to Haven Power Limited and £3.8 million arising on the acquisition of 
Billington Bioenergy in the period (30 June and 31 December 2014: £10.7 million entirely attributable 
to Haven Power Limited). 
 
11.  Cash generated from operations 
Cash generated from operations is the starting point of our cash flow statement. This table makes 
adjustments for any non-cash accounting items to reconcile our profit for the period to the amount of 
physical cash we have generated from our operations (i.e. sourcing, generating and selling 
electricity).

Independent review report to Drax Group plc 
 
We have been engaged by the Company to review the condensed set of financial statements in the 
half-yearly financial report for the six months ended 30 June 2015 which comprises the Condensed 
Consolidated Income Statement, the Condensed Consolidated Statement of Comprehensive Income, 
the Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheet, the Condensed Consolidated Statement of Changes in 
Equity, the Condensed Consolidated Cash Flow Statement and related notes 1 to 12. We have read 
the other information contained in the half-yearly financial report and considered whether it contains 
any apparent misstatements or material inconsistencies with the information in the condensed set of 
financial statements. 
This report is made solely to the Company in accordance with International Standard on Review 
Engagements (UK and Ireland) 2410 “Review of Interim Financial Information Performed by the 
Independent Auditor of the Entity” issued by the Auditing Practices Board. Our work has been 
undertaken so that we might state to the Company those matters we are required to state to it 
in an independent review report and for no other purpose. To the fullest extent permitted by law, 
we do not accept or assume responsibility to anyone other than the Company, for our review work, 
for this report, or for the conclusions we have formed. 
 
Directors’ responsibilities 
The half-yearly financial report is the responsibility of, and has been approved by, the directors. 
The directors are responsible for preparing the half-yearly financial report in accordance with the 
Disclosure and Transparency Rules of the United Kingdom’s Financial Conduct Authority. 
As disclosed in note 2, the annual financial statements of the Group are prepared in accordance with 
IFRSs as adopted by the European Union. The condensed set of financial statements included in this 
half-yearly financial report has been prepared in accordance with International Accounting Standard 
34, “Interim Financial Reporting,” as adopted by the European Union. 
 
Our responsibility 
Our responsibility is to express to the Company a conclusion on the condensed set of financial 
statements in the half-yearly financial report based on our review. 
 
Scope of review  
We conducted our review in accordance with International Standard on Review Engagements (UK 
and Ireland) 2410 “Review of Interim Financial Information Performed by the Independent Auditor of 
the Entity” issued by the Auditing Practices Board for use in the United Kingdom. A review of interim 
financial information consists of making inquiries, primarily of persons responsible for financial and 
accounting matters, and applying analytical and other review procedures. A review is substantially 
less in scope than an audit conducted in accordance with International Standards on Auditing (UK 
and Ireland) and consequently does not enable us to obtain assurance that we would become aware 
of all significant matters that might be identified in an audit. Accordingly, we do not express an audit 
opinion. 
 
Conclusion 
Based on our review, nothing has come to our attention that causes us to believe that the condensed 
set of financial statements in the half-yearly financial report for the six months ended 30 June 2015 is 
not prepared, in all material respects, in accordance with International Accounting Standard 34 as 
adopted by the European Union and the Disclosure and Transparency Rules of the United Kingdom’s 
Financial Conduct Authority.

Glossary 
 
Advantaged fuels 
Fuel that gives a price advantage against standard bituminous coals. Such fuels include pond fines, 
off-specification coal and petcoke. 
Ancillary services 
Services provided to National Grid used for balancing supply and demand or maintaining secure 
electricity supplies within acceptable limits. They are described in Connection Condition 8 of the Grid 
Code. 
Availability 
Average percentage of time the units were available for generation. 
Average achieved price 
Power revenues divided by volume of net sales (includes imbalance charges). 
Balancing mechanism 
The sub-set of the market through which the System Operator can call upon additional 
generation/consumption or reduce generation/consumption, through market participants’ bids and 
offers, in order to balance the system minute-by-minute. 
Bark spread 
The difference between the power price and the cost of biomass, net of renewable support. 
Carbon price support (CPS) mechanism (or carbon price floor or carbon tax) 
A tax upon fossil fuels (including coal) used to generate electricity. It is charged as a levy on coal 
delivered to the power station. 
Contracts for difference (CfD) 
A mechanism to support investment in low-carbon electricity generation. The CfD works by stabilising 
revenues for generators at a fixed price level known as the “strike price”. Generators will receive 
revenue from selling their electricity into the market as usual. However, when the market reference 
price is below the strike price they will also receive a top-up payment from suppliers for the additional 
amount. Conversely if the reference price is above the strike price, the generator must pay back the 
difference. 
Dark green spread 
The difference between the power price and the cost of coal and carbon. 
EBITDA 
Profit before interest, tax, depreciation and amortisation, gains or losses on disposal of property, plant 
and equipment, unrealised gains/(losses) on derivative contracts and the one-off settlement of CESP 
in 2014. 
EU ETS 
The EU Emissions Trading System is a mechanism introduced across the EU to reduce emissions of 
CO2; the scheme is capable of being extended to cover all greenhouse gas emissions. 
Feed-in-tariff 
A long-term contract set at a fixed level where variable payments are made to ensure the generator 
receives an agreed tariff. The Feed-in tariff payment would be made in addition to the generator’s 
revenues from selling in the market. 
Forced outage 
Any reduction in plant availability, excluding planned outages. 
Forced outage rate 
The capacity which is not available due to forced outages or restrictions expressed as a percentage of 
the maximum theoretical capacity, less planned outage capacity.

fuel poverty, energy and climate change goals in a way that is consistent with economic recovery and 
minimising the impact on consumer bills. 
Lost time injury rate (LTIR) 
The frequency rate is calculated on the following basis: lost time injuries/hours worked times 100,000.

theoretical capacity. 
Renewable support 
Term used to refer to any financial incentive in respect of renewable energy generation. At present 
this predominantly reflects the value ascribed to ROCs and LECs, which is accounted for as a 
deduction from fuel costs within costs of sales. 
ROCs 
A Renewables Obligation Certificate (ROC) is a certificate issued to an accredited generator for 
electricity generated from eligible renewable sources. The Renewables Obligation is currently the 
main support scheme for renewable electricity projects in the UK. 
Summer 
The calendar months April to September. 
System operator 
National Grid Electricity Transmission. Responsible for the co-ordination of electricity flows onto and 
over the transmission system, balancing generation supply and user demand. 
Total recordable injury rate (TRIR) 
The frequency rate is calculated on the following basis: (lost time injuries + worse than first aid 
injuries)/hours worked times 100,000. 
Underlying financial measures 
We report financial measures described as “underlying” such as profit after tax and earnings per 
share. Underlying measures are adjusted to exclude the impact of gains and losses on derivative 
contracts, one-off items that do not reflect the underlying performance of the Group and the 
associated tax.
