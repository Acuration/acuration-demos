1.  Headlines
The biggest event of the last quarter was undoubtedly the blackout of August 9th 
which left over a million people without power and caused travel chaos. 
We deep dive into the event and find that while there are several lessons to 
learn, Britain has one of the world’s most reliable power systems and so further 
improvement will be difficult to achieve (see our special report in Article 2).
The plummeting cost of renewable energy also made headlines. Over 5 GW 
of new offshore wind capacity was auctioned for around £40 per MWh – well 
below the recent wholesale price of electricity. These could potentially be the 
world’s first offshore wind farms with a negative subsidy, meaning they pay 
money back to consumers (see Article 3).
Increasing the share of renewables will be essential for meeting the UK’s net-
zero target, but this will create unprecedented challenges in balancing the 
power system. While wholesale electricity prices have fallen to a 3-year low, 
the cost of balancing the power system hit a record high of £3.80/MWh last 
quarter. For the first time, keeping the power system stable makes up a tenth 
of the total cost of generating electricity.
We look at the role of energy storage in helping to balance Britain’s power 
system. Article 4 looks at some technologies to watch out for in the future, 
and Article 5 investigates how Britain’s storage capacity may need to increase  
10-fold in the coming decades.
The last three months saw nuclear output down 20% and wind up 33% on the 
same period last year. Coal output reached its lowest levels since the 1920s, 
supplying an average of less than 1 GW over the past year (see Article 6).
Generation from fossil fuels hit record lows in Quarter 3, and the carbon 
intensity of electricity also entered new territory. For the first time ever it 
fell below 50 g/kWh for an hour and below 80 g/kWh averaged over a day. 
September’s carbon intensity was under 160 g/kWh – some two-thirds lower 
than this time five years ago. This brings the average carbon intensity over the 
last 12 months to below 200 g/kWh for the first time – another major milestone 
on the road to zero-carbon electricity. (see Article 7).

2.  The blackout
On the 9th of August, Britain experienced its worst blackout for a decade. 
Over 1 million people went without power, a sharp reminder that life is very 
difficult if the grid doesn’t manage to “keep the lights on”. That common 
phrase fails to capture the deep disruption caused in workplaces, hospitals 
and transport links. Ordinary lights going off was not the issue.
Two aspects of this are worrying: three sources of generation failed very shortly 
after a lightning strike, and critical pieces of the country’s infrastructure lost 
power when they shouldn’t have. Both of these reveal a mix of technical and 
administrative problems, along with a good measure of bad luck.
National Grid has published its technical report to Ofgem on the incident, and 
BEIS is conducting a comprehensive review, including the economic damage 
caused. Here we summarise what happened, discuss the broader implications 
for the power system, and ask whether we should spend more on trying to 
prevent this happening again.
What happened?
Three sources of power generation failed within half a second of one another. 
6% of generation, or 1.9 GW, was lost. The grid is only designed to cope with 
the sudden loss of the largest single component in the power system (normally 
Sizewell B at 1.2 GW). That could have covered two of these failures, but not all 
three simultaneously. Not enough power could be supplied to meet demand, and 
so 5% of customers were automatically disconnected to prevent the grid from 
complete collapse. While this was painful for those involved, it saved the whole 
country from losing power, which could have taken days to recover from.
The problems began when lightning struck a power line just before the Friday 
rush-hour. This sounds dramatic, but it happens thousands of times a year. Circuit 
breakers automatically disconnected the line in less than a tenth of a second to 
isolate the current surge from the lightning bolt. About 20 seconds later they 
reconnected the line, and normally this would have been the end of the story.
The large wind farm at Hornsea (100 km out in the North Sea) disconnected 
itself from the grid 0.3 seconds after the lightning strike. It detected a voltage 
disturbance when the power line was disconnected, and attempted to help correct 
it by injecting ‘reactive power’. Something went wrong and two banks of wind 
turbines disconnected to protect themselves.1 737 MW of generation was lost.
Within half a second of the lightning strike, a steam-turbine shut down at 
Little Barford gas power station, which is connected to the affected power line. 
The turbine had reacted to abnormal speed readings, which were probably 
not true because the control systems were disrupted when its power supply 
switched over to battery back-up.1 This is unusual, and looks like an equipment 
failure of some kind. A further 244 MW of generation was lost.

The voltage disturbance caused by the power line and generators 
disconnecting then rippled out through the grid. Lots of small distributed 
generators2 saw this and the resulting drop in frequency as a loss of mains 
power, and so disconnected for safety reasons.3 These systems were still 
using outdated forms of ‘Loss of Mains’ protection which are banned in new 
installations, as it is known they can be outwitted by grid disturbances. 
Another 500 MW was lost.
With over 1,480 MW of generation suddenly disconnected, more power was 
being taken out of the grid by consumers than was being put in by generators. 
This caused all generators across the country to start slowing down, and their 
speed – the grid’s frequency – fell from 50 Hz down to 49.1 Hz over the next  
20 seconds. While this fall of 1.5% might not sound like much, National Grid 
has an obligation to keep frequency within 1% of its normal value, its “statutory 
limit” of between 49.5 and 50.5 Hz.
 
While the frequency was dropping, the first line of defence started coming to 
the rescue. National Grid keeps “response and reserve” to cover certain types of 
failure, and was holding 1,338 MW of frequency response made up of batteries, 
automatic demand response and part-loaded generators. Over the coming 
seconds 1,080 MW was delivered, which arrested the fall in frequency. A second 
gas turbine then failed at Little Barford and a further 210 MW was lost.
This sent the system frequency below the critical threshold of 48.8 Hz  
(2.4% below normal). At this point, National Grid ordered the second line of 
defence, “Low-Frequency Demand Disconnect” (LFDD). Like a surgeon deciding 
to amputate a limb to save the patient, around 5% of demand was disconnected 
from the grid. This helped to bring demand back in line with supply and allow 
frequency to be restored, but it meant cutting power to over a million customers.
The minimum system frequency experienced each day since 2009

These include gas engines in factories, anaerobic digesters at farms, and small wind turbines and solar panels. Some failed before the larger transmission-connected generators and some failed after, depending on the 
type of Loss of Mains protection they used.

They disconnected to avoid ‘islanding’, when a small generator continues to provide power when electricity is supposed to be off for safety reasons.

Who was affected?
So, who got disconnected and why them? The frequency drop affected 
the whole country equally, so it was not just those close to the original 
lightning strike that were affected. The disconnections were made by the 
regional distribution network operators (DNOs) who run the local wires, and 
were automatic and pre-programmed. In total, 1.15 million customers were 
disconnected across England, Wales and Scotland. National Grid gave the 
green light to start reconnecting customers about 15 minutes after the power 
cuts happened and all customers were back on supply with 50 minutes.
Losing power for an hour can be very inconvenient for a household, but for 
some larger customers it can cause chaos. Large customers can declare under 
the Electricity Supply Emergency Code that they shouldn’t be disconnected 
because they have critical functions, and the pre-programming will take 
account of this. Newcastle Airport lost power because they had not opted to 
be a Protected Site and so their contract permitted disconnection.1 The airport 
did at least have standby generators and batteries to keep essential safety 
systems running, although not the rest of their services.
Ipswich Hospital also lost power. It was not disconnected by the network 
operator, but by its own protection systems over-reacting to the problems on the 
grid.1 Again, it had standby generators to cover some, if not all, of its services.
The railways were also badly affected. Major signalling centres and the 
supplies for electric trains are Protected Sites, so what went wrong? Two 
substations feeding DC power to railway lines reacted to the low frequency by 
disconnecting, which stopped some trains temporarily. The most significant 
problems were caused by the trains themselves. A class of trains operated by 
Thameslink running north of London shut down because they were programmed 
to do so if the frequency was abnormal.1 It is not clear why 49.0 Hz was chosen 
as the trigger point for these trains to shut down, and that will need to be 
reviewed and possibly changed. Some drivers were able to ‘reboot’ their trains 
and get going again but others found they could not because of a software 
update. Technicians had to be sent to the trains to get these trains restarted, 
which caused severe delays.
Are wind farms making things worse?
Nothing in the August power cut was a result of wind being intermittent or 
variable.1 While wind output was high that day, supplying nearly a third of demand, 
there was no sudden reduction of wind speed leading to loss of wind power.
There was a sudden loss of one wind farm but others in the region carried on 
operating as normal. Hornsea was only partially built, and not all wind turbines 
had been commissioned. Two 400 MW modules were running under some 
temporary arrangements with the grid, and not in their final configuration. 
This is a pragmatic arrangement as it allows partly-built wind farms to generate 
clean electricity rather than keeping their turbines idle, but this may need 
reviewing in future.

4 Calculated from the fastest negative rate of change of frequency seen each day, based on 15-second average data from Elexon.
There is a broader question around the move to higher shares of renewable 
generation. Wind and solar farms do not have heavy spinning metal turbines 
which provide ‘inertia’, the shock-absorbers of the power system. As we move 
to less conventional generation, the power system is seeing higher rates of 
change of frequency. This is giving National Grid less time to react to problems 
on the system.
On August 9th, the frequency drop was the fastest we have ever experienced, 
peaking at about 0.16 Hz per second. The sustained rate of change meant 
National Grid had less than 10 seconds to react before frequency had fallen 
outside of normal operating limits (below 49.5 Hz).
This ‘speeding up’ is a direct result of more wind, solar and sub-sea 
interconnectors. However, it is being counterbalanced by new technologies 
that provide response and reserve services. Nearly half of National Grid’s 
response came from batteries, which were exceptionally fast to reach full 
power. The traditional spinning generators, which would have been the only 
recourse a decade ago, took much longer to respond.

Average time between outages
How common is this?
Britain has seen four large power cuts in the last twenty years. These are quite 
different from one another and reveal a variety of causes:
These events highlight the many challenges facing grid operators: storm damage, 
unexpected generator shut-downs and equipment failure in the grid. These 
large events seem to happen every five years. Of course, local power cuts are 
more common, especially in rural areas; however, each one affects fewer people.
It is important to note that limiting blackouts to once every 5 years appears to be 
the best that can be achieved worldwide. The national grid is among the most 
reliable power systems in the world – better than much of Europe or the Americas.
Christmas 2013
Heavy storm damage caused 
power cuts affecting more than a 
million people. 16,000 customers 
without power for more than  
48 hours. Local power lines were 
blown over across almost the 
entire country, swamping the DNO 
repair crews. Making more use of 
underground cables rather than 
overhead lines on poles would help 
but that would be a vastly expensive 
and disruptive conversion job.
August 2003
Large parts of south London 
suffered a power cut, including 
railway and tube lines. This time  
it was an equipment failure.  
A transformer in a National 
Grid substation had to be taken 
offline; power flow redirected to 
other lines as normal, but a circuit 
breaker then tripped because of 
incorrect settings.
May 2008
A coal-fired power station in 
Scotland and the Sizewell B nuclear 
reactor in Suffolk failed within 3 
minutes of another. This is very  
similar to the event this August: 
National Grid’s reserve and response 
could not keep the frequency from 
falling, some distributed generation 
also disconnected, and LFDD led to 
power cuts affecting half a million 
customers. The generator failures 
appear to have been unrelated though.

Can we stop this ever happening again?
If we want to stop power cuts happening we have to think about all the 
causes. Focusing on sudden outages of generators, we would need to look 
at the regulation that defines what National Grid has to guard against: 
the Supply Quality and Security Standard (SQSS). This requires the grid to 
remain operational after the loss of a single ‘generating unit’, ‘power park’ or 
‘converter station’. National Grid holds enough response and reserve to cover 
for losing the biggest unit in operation that day.6
The obvious question is do we want to cover for two large units suffering 
problems, rather than just one? Doing so would have meant that the 2008 and 
2019 power cuts would have been avoided, but not the 2003 or 2013 ones. This 
wouldn’t cover three large units failing in quick succession. It would mean an 
increase in costs of procuring those response and reserve services.
Are we spending enough on security?
It is difficult to judge whether we should invest more money to prevent further 
blackouts. The instinctive answer is ‘yes of course’, but if that extra money 
achieves very little over and above the current standards, it would be better 
spent on other ways to improve our quality of life.
Two elements of this are what might it cost to improve security, and how much 
money could that save from reduced blackouts? Neither are easy to estimate.
National Grid spends about £380m per year on response and reserve services to 
help in events like this. It passes those costs on through ‘Balancing Use of System 
Charges’ to generators and retailers. The share paid by domestic customers 
adds around £5 per household per year. It is not as simple as saying we need to 
double this to cover two outages but that is a rough guide. Preventing the recent 
blackout would have required more response but not more reserve, although 
doubling the amount of response held would likely be very expensive.
The harder one to estimate is what it would be worth to avoid blackouts. 
Would you be willing to pay an extra £15 per year to avoid a 5% chance of being 
stuck in the airport or on a train once every five years? Your answer may well 
depend on whether or not you were affected by the August power cut.
Ofgem use a ‘value of lost load’ for such questions. A kWh of demand not 
served by power stations is worth £17, or about 100 times the typical price 
consumers pay. During the blackout, about 5% of load was cut off for up to 
an hour – around 0.9 million kWh, valued at £15 million. If this happens every 
five years, perhaps we should ‘rationally’ want to spend an extra 10 pence 
per household per year to eliminate it. There is little evidence to suggest that 
£17/kWh is the correct value7, or that people’s preference for uninterrupted 
electricity follows an economist’s cost-optimisation algorithm.
6 Plus some further reserve to make sure the system is covered again 30 minutes later for a second outage.

For international context, 50 million people across the US and Canada 
experienced up to four days without power in 2003, which was estimated to cost 
USD 6bn in lost productivity and damage. In the same year, 50 million people in 
Italy and Switzerland suffered a one-day blackout, costing upwards of €1bn.7
What lessons can we learn?
There are many issues to consider and lessons to learn. First would be to 
uncover the detailed technical reasons for the outages at Little Barford 
and Hornsea and try to ensure that both of those problems are made less 
likely. Hornsea was only partly complete and running under temporary grid-
code arrangements. Perhaps new farms should have grid code compliance 
assured one module at a time, and operators should be more careful over the 
configurations that may be used for very large wind farms.
The second issue is that of common-cause events. The 2008 power cut was 
two power stations failing in unrelated events – just bad luck. Should we see 
this 2019 outage of two power stations and a share of distributed generators 
as having a common-cause? They were all unfortunate reactions to the 
lightning strike, but perhaps this was also in ‘bad luck’ territory. It was already 
known that older distributed generators were prone to ‘sympathetic tripping’, 
disconnecting when mains electricity was not actually lost. The protection 
systems of older and vulnerable distributed generators are being replaced in 
an ‘accelerated’ industry campaign that completes in 2022. Perhaps this could 
be accelerated further? Perhaps National Grid should factor these devices into 
their largest loss of load calculation until they have been upgraded?
Finally, the ensuing power cut caused more disruption than should be 
expected. Newcastle Airport did not class itself as critical infrastructure. 
Ipswich Hospital did not cope with the switch to backup power. Some trains 
were set to turn off, and many could not be restarted. Organisations across the 
country would be well-advised to check if they can and should be Protected 
Sites and whether their own protection systems are appropriately configured.
Then looking beyond technical elements: perhaps there needs to be a public 
discussion about the appetite for paying to reduce the risk of demand 
disconnections (LFDD) by requiring National Grid to purchase larger volumes 
of reserve and response. Similarly, perhaps this event will raise awareness 
for critical infrastructure provides about what sort of grid conditions should 
be planned for and immunised against (e.g. adjusting over-sensitive internal 
protection, providing UPS etc).
There is nothing to suggest these events are more likely today than they were  
10 years ago, so it would be difficult to justify spending more to reduce the risks 
in future. That said, Britain’s power system is changing rapidly and so we need to 
be ready for the different kinds of problems that will be faced in the future.
Drax Electric Insights Quarterly – Q3 2019

Both the supply and demand for electricity are going through unprecedented 
changes as new technologies take hold. Britain already has more renewables 
than fossil capacity, and the balance is set to shift further as all coal stations 
retire by 2025. More wind and solar will come online, backed up by batteries, 
more interconnectors to the continent and bigger nuclear reactors. National 
Grid is preparing itself to manage a zero-carbon electricity system, and must 
develop new tools and markets to replace the traditional steam and gas 
turbines it once relied upon. Put together, these not only change the size 
of failures that could be expected, but also the location of them, and the 
balance between centralised and distributed sources (the latter which could 
potentially be invisible or uncontrollable to the system operator).
Demand will also change dramatically, as efficiency improvements continue 
to shrink the traditional pattern of consumption, and new technologies like 
electric vehicles and heat pumps come into the mainstream. Smart systems 
mean consumers could be a major part of the solution, with power companies 
quick to offer ‘smart hot water tanks’ that will help in the event of blackouts  
in future.
While Britain has one of the most secure electricity systems in the world, it is 
worrying that events like this expose several flaws. It is little comfort to those 
affected to say the power system worked exactly as expected. Engineers will 
continue analysing the events of August 9th for years to come, but they must 
also be quick to develop new ways of keeping Britain’s power system under 
control as it moves into bold new territory.

£44/MWh in today’s money.  The actual lowest bid was £39.65/MWh, but is reported in money of 2012. 
2 
The level of support that wind farms receive depends on several factors, including the level of wholesale electricity prices over the coming decades and how significantly prices are depressed during times of 
high wind output.
3.  Zero-subsidy offshore wind?
The third round of offshore wind auctions were announced in September, 
bringing forward 5.4 GW of new capacity for a record low of £44/MWh.1  
This price has fallen 30% since the last auction in 2017, and could possibly 
mark these as the world’s first negative-subsidy wind farms, which pay money 
back to UK consumers over their lifetime.2
Six new wind farms were awarded contracts and will come online from 2024 
onwards. These will be built by SSE, Innogy and Equinor (formerly Statoil, the 
Norwegian state oil company). Two farms (0.45 GW) will be built off the east 
coast of Scotland, and four (totalling 5 GW) will be built on Dogger Bank: an 
area of shallow water in the middle of the North Sea. These new wind farms 
will be twice the size of today’s largest wind farm, Walney Extension. In total, 
this newly-auctioned capacity is expected to create 8,000 jobs in the UK.
Offshore wind is supported by Contracts for Differences (CfDs). These 
contracts between the government and wind farm guarantee a reference price 
for each MWh generated. If the wholesale power price is below the agreed 
‘strike price’, the wind farm receives a top-up from government – hence CfDs 
are synonymous with subsidising renewables. However, this crucially provides 
revenue stability over the coming decades. By shielding wind farms from 
fluctuations in power prices (partly driven by international fossil fuel prices), 
the government can reduce the risk to developers. This allows them to reduce 
their cost of financing, making wind farms cheaper to build.

In 2019 currency – the original bids were £119.89 and £39.65 in the money of 2012.
4 Based on 10-year average power prices.
Over the last two years, wholesale electricity has averaged £50/MWh, so the 
CfDs for this latest round of wind farms would have been working in reverse: 
paying money back to the government if they were already built. Electricity 
prices have risen faster than inflation over the last decade; if they continue 
rising through the 2020s these wind farms will be the first to have a negative 
subsidy, meaning they actively reduce consumer bills.
Since the UK’s first auction in 2015, the price of offshore wind has fallen by 
over 15% per year, from £134 down to just £44 per MWh.3 The pace of reduction 
has surprised many in the energy industry: as recently as 2016 experts predicted 
these prices wouldn’t be seen until 2050. Offshore wind has quickly become 
one of the cheapest ways to produce electricity, and these cost reductions are 
not unique to the UK. Auctions from neighbouring countries are rapidly falling, 
and reached parity with power prices in Germany back in 2017.
Many things have helped to bring down the cost of offshore wind. Bigger 
turbines are more cost effective, and Dogger Bank will be among the first to 
use the world’s largest turbine, the GE Haliade-X. It stands 260 metres tall 
(twice the height of the London Eye) and each machine produces 12 MW –  
five times more than the average turbine built just five years ago.
At the same time, wind farms are getting bigger. Three of the Dogger Bank 
farms are being built as if they were one, streamlining construction and grid 
connection. These farms are also moving to better areas, further from shore 
where wind speeds are higher, and in relatively shallow water meaning the 
foundations are easier to lay. The UK’s expertise in North Sea oil & gas has 
helped build up the skilled workforce for offshore wind.

Looking further to the future, more radical plans are being developed. TenneT, 
who operate the Dutch and part of the German power system, plan to develop the 
‘Power Hub’: an artificial island in the North Sea to connect a staggering 12 GW 
of wind farms (almost four Hinkley Point nuclear plants in terms of capacity). 
To avoid the cost of ever-longer transmission links, some are planning to build 
offshore wind farms with no grid connection at all. Instead, they would generate 
hydrogen directly from the wind, and tap into existing gas pipelines and storage 
facilities to provide “green gas” for heating homes and industry.
The International Energy Agency reports that offshore wind could provide the 
entire world’s future electricity needs. The UK government aims for 30 GW of 
offshore wind by 2030, helping to meet net-zero by 2050. The UK’s most recent 
auction suggests this is not just a technical possibility, but now an economically 
viable way to power much of the world’s growing electricity needs.

4.  What next for energy storage?
“Energy storage is like bacon: It makes everything better”.1 It is considered  
one of the most important issues within the energy industry, with  
“the potential to dictate the pace and the scale of the energy transition”.  
We look at the reasons why, and the technologies to watch in the future.
In addition to interconnection, demand-side response and flexible generation, 
storage is the ‘glue’ that could help integrate more renewables by smoothing 
their intermittent output. This could revolutionise grid management, facilitate 
deeper decarbonisation and significantly reduce the need for fossil fuels to provide 
flexibility. Low-cost technologies that store excess electricity for when it is needed 
are seen as “transformational” and one of the “foundations of clean energy”.
Part of this excitement comes from the rapid cost falls that many storage 
technologies are seeing. Storage is following in the footsteps of solar panels, 
which have become mainstream after relentless cost reductions. Lithium-ion 
battery packs now cost around 85% less than they did at the start of the decade. 
Other major technologies – ranging from flywheels to hydrogen – are seeing 
costs converge towards £200–280 per kWh of storage capacity,2 meaning around 
£2,000 to store the typical daily consumption of a British household (8 kWh).
Much of the excitement is around lithium-ion batteries. These power 
everything from mobile phones to grid-scale batteries capable of supplying 
thousands of homes. Electric vehicles are driving up the scale of battery 
manufacturing, which makes them cheaper to build. The number of EVs on 
Britain’s roads has grown 25% so far this year, sailing past quarter of a million.
Lithium-ion is far from being the only technology that matters though. It is 
important to remember that pumped hydro storage (moving water between 
high and low lakes) is by far the largest technology, and represents 97% of the 
world’s installed electricity storage.
The power system needs a range of services, from sub-second to inter-seasonal. 
The recent blackout highlights the value of having fast-acting technologies 
for balancing and frequency response, and there will be an increased need to 
provide more inertia as old coal units retire. Britain’s weather means we often 
experience several consecutive days with high or low wind speeds, so storage 
which can balance between the weeks or months will become increasingly 
valuable. Batteries typically can store 1-4 hours of energy, and research into 
longer-duration batteries is still in its early phase.
The elephant in the room is inter-seasonal storage. Britain uses 25% more 
electricity in winter than in summer. This pales in comparison to natural gas 
though: we use five-times more in winter than summer for heating. As more 
homes move to low-carbon electric heating, new technologies will be needed 
to balance out the extreme seasonal variation this will add to demand. There 
are plenty of ways to store electricity other than batteries. Some of these, 
particularly thermal and chemical technologies, could offer very long-duration 
storage, but with the penalty of much lower efficiency than today’s batteries.

A range of exciting ideas are being pursued by numerous companies. 
Gravitricity plan to turn Britain’s coal-mining heritage into ultra-low-cost storage 
by hoisting steel weights up and down disused mine shafts. Highview build 
plants that liquefy air by cooling it to –200°C, then release energy when 
this air expands to 700 times its volume when warmed back up to ambient 
temperatures. RedT offer ‘vanadium redox flow machines’ which work like 
conventional batteries, but store their energy-containing material in separate, 
scalable tanks to allow longer duration storage at lower cost. Energy suppliers 
are beginning to offer ‘vehicle to grid’ services – allowing electric vehicle 
owners to save money and carbon emissions with ‘smart charging cables’,  
or get paid for using their parked car batteries as a ‘virtual power station’.
Ultimately, balancing energy between months or seasons may require a shift 
away from electricity altogether. Hydrogen is a promising candidate, and 
ITM Power produce electrolysers which make hydrogen gas from excess 
renewable energy. Their latest project with Cadent and Northern Gas 
Networks is blending natural gas with up to 20% hydrogen for 700 houses at 
Keele University. This is using clean electricity to lower the carbon emissions 
from heating, without any change needed at the consumer side (these houses 
still use regular boilers and cookers).
There is a clear case for expanding Britain’s energy storage capacity in future. 
The use cases for storage match the characteristics of renewable energy 
generation, and rapid cost reductions make storage suitable for a growing 
number of applications, both at grid scale and in individual households. 
Seasonal storage is always going to be the most difficult proposition due to 
the economics of having very few charge/discharge cycles per year from which  
to earn money. But, as the UK pushes on towards net zero emissions, it may 
become essential for decarbonising the highly-seasonal sectors such as heating.

A big open question is how flexible will Britain’s power system 
need to be as it transitions to more renewable energy, and 
how much of this flexibility should come from energy storage? 
Getting to over 80% wind and solar power, as is suggested for 
reaching net-zero, might require a tenfold expansion from  
3 GW of storage today to over 30 GW in the coming decades. 
In energy terms, this amounts to the region of 100 to 200 GWh 
of storage capacity, up from just 30 GWh installed today.
It is clear that new technologies will be needed to balance out 
the variability of wind and solar farms, but how big might the 
market for storage be? This is a question that many academic 
and industry studies have tried to tackle. There is no one 
answer, as it depends strongly on how the rest of the energy 
system evolves – ranging from how much electricity comes 
from nuclear, renewables and flexible fossil fuels, to how many 
people buy electric cars and heat pumps. It also depends on 
how various studies model the workings of the power system, 
and the technical and economic assumptions they use.
Results from 28 studies of the future electricity system, comparing the amount of storage that gets built in the coming decades 
against the amount of energy from variable renewables. Installed storage capacities are divided by the peak demand for electricity 
in each region to account for the relative size of countries. 1
National Grid provides four possible visions in their Future 
Energy Scenarios. They see Britain installing anything 
from 3 to 13 GW of new storage capacity over the next 
fifteen years, depending on whether we continue relying 
heavily on natural gas or move towards more renewables 
for our electricity. Other studies cover an even wider 
range, but one trend is clear. More storage is needed as 
more electricity comes from wind and solar power, and 
the requirement grows more quickly at higher levels of 
renewables penetration.
Of course, storage is just one form of flexibility that can help 
to integrate low-carbon power sources. Interconnection 
with neighbouring countries, demand-side response (such 
as smart appliances and hot water cylinders, etc.) and 
peaking power stations all have a role to play, and are 
similarly all expected to grow in the coming years.

6.  Capacity and production statistics
Cottam coal-fired power station closed down after 50 years, taking with it  
one-fifth of Britain’s remaining coal capacity. This leaves just five operating 
coal plants, two of which are set to close by March 2020. Coal power stations 
again supplied less than 1% of Britain’s electricity, averaging just 0.2 GW over the 
quarter. Coal output has halved over the last 12 months, and fell below 1 GW for 
the first time since the 1920s.
Britain’s electricity supply mix in the 
third quarter of 2019
Electricity generation from coal is at its lowest for 90 years
Carbon Brief and several newspapers reported that renewables supplied more 
electricity than fossil fuels in the third quarter this year. The Electric Insights 
data (right) show that fossil fuels supplied 39% of demand, compared to 35% 
from renewables. One difference is that Electric Insights covers Great Britain 
rather than the whole United Kingdom, as Northern Ireland is on a separate 
power system shared with the Republic of Ireland. Secondly, Carbon Brief tried to 
estimate the supply from small-scale renewables which are embedded into the 
distribution networks, and do not publish data on their hourly power output.1 
Regardless of methods, we echo Carbon Brief: this is a “symbolic milestone in the 
stunning transformation of the UK’s electricity system over the past decade”.
Nuclear power also continued its bad run from last quarter. Output was again 
one-fifth lower than this quarter last year, with the country’s 9.5 GW of reactors 
averaging just 5.8 GW of output.
Britain’s wind farms were the second-largest source of electricity over the last 
three months, beating nuclear into third position. Output was one-third higher 
than this time last year.
Electricity demand fell to 64.5 TWh over the quarter, an average of 29.2 GW. 
Demand for this time of year has not averaged less than 30 GW for a quarter 
of a century.
Wholesale electricity prices continued falling to reach their lowest in three 
years. This prompted exports (which are typically at their lowest during Q3) to 
reach their highest level since 2010. That said, Britain still imported four times 
more electricity than it exported.
1 
Other sources give different values because of the types of plant they consider. For example, BEIS Energy Trends records an additional 0.7 GW of hydro, 0.6 GW of biomass and 3 GW of waste-to-energy plants. These 
plants and their output are not visible to the electricity transmission system and so cannot be reported on here.

7.  Power system records
Britain’s power system had another record-breaking quarter, with renewable 
energy hitting new highs, while fossil fuels, demand and carbon emissions all 
hit new lows. 24 of the records we track were broken over the last three months.
Wind farms provided more than half of Britain’s electricity for the first time 
ever. For an hour on the 4th of September, wind provided 52.4% of electricity 
– up from the previous record of 49.7% set back in January. The total share 
of renewables also broke new ground, supplying more than two-thirds of the 
country’s electricity for the first time ever on the 17th of August.
This high share of renewables drove the carbon intensity of electricity below 
50 g/kWh for the first time ever. On 17th of August it hit just 43 g/kWh in 
the mid-afternoon; and the day as a whole averaged just 76 g/kWh, nearly a 
quarter below the previous record set in June.
Electricity demand also fell to a new monthly low of 28.6 GW in August, likely 
prompted by the good weather – along with continuing energy efficiency 
improvements. As demand falls and renewable output grows, Britain’s net 
demand also hit new lows. Instantaneous demand net of wind and solar output 
fell to just 8.1 GW on the 19th of August, one-sixth lower than the previous 
record set in June.
No records were broken by conventional fuels (nuclear, coal and gas). However, 
when put together, total output from fossil fuels fell to new lows. Conversely, 
the share of all low-carbon generation (renewables, nuclear and imported 
nuclear) edged ever-closer to 100%. On the 17th of August, the share hit a new 
peak of 89%.
The tables below look over the past decade (2009 to 2019) and report the 
record output and share of electricity generation, plus sustained averages 
over a day, a month and a calendar year.1 Cells highlighted in blue are records 
that were broken in the second quarter of 2019. Each number links to the 
date it occurred on the Electric Insights website, allowing these records to be 
explored visually.
