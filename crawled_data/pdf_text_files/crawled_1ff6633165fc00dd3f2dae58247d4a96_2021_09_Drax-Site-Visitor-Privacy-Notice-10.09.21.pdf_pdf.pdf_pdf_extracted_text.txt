Drax Site Visitor Privacy Notice
WHAT’S THE PURPOSE OF THIS DOCUMENT?
This Privacy Notice (“Notice”) is intended to provide information 
regarding how any personal information we collect from you 
before, during and after you’re a visitor to one of our sites will 
be processed within the Drax Group of companies.  It relates to 
personal data (defined under data protection law) about you 
that we refer to as personal information in this Notice.    
WHO COLLECTS THE INFORMATION? 
Companies operating under Drax Group plc are the joint data 
controllers of personal information provided by or collected 
about you. This means that we are responsible for deciding how 
we hold and use personal information about you and that we 
are required to notify you of the information contained in this 
notice. It is important that you read this notice so that you are 
aware of how and why we are using your personal information 
and how we will treat it. Depending on the circumstances, we 
may on occasion provide you with a shorter privacy notice to 
cover specific types of processing that will be supplemented by
this notice.
We may update this Notice at any time, so you are advised to 
review this Notice at regular intervals.
It is important that you read this Notice, together with any other 
privacy notice we may provide on specific occasions when 
we are collecting or processing personal information about 
you, so that you are aware of how and why we are using such 
information. In particular, you should read our CCTV Privacy 
Notices and our Tours Privacy Notices (if relevant to you) that 
are available on our websites.
Please read this Notice as if it’s from the Company whose site 
you are visiting. However, your personal information may also be 
shared within our group of companies (our “group companies”) 
and so, in this Notice, references to ‘we’ or ‘us’ mean the 
Company and our group companies.
We respect your privacy and are committed to protecting 
your personal information. Our Group Data Protection Officer 
is responsible for overseeing questions in relation to this 
Notice. If you have any questions about this Notice, please 
use the contact details set out at the end of this Notice in the 
“Contacting Us” section.
LEGAL BASIS AND PURPOSE FOR PROCESSING 
We will collect various types of personal information from you. 
Further details of how we use your personal information are set 
out below. 
In the section below, we have indicated with asterisks whether 
we need to process your personal information:  
•  * to pursue our legitimate interests, provided that your 
interests and fundamental rights do not override those 
interests
• ** to enable us to comply with our legal obligations
There may also be occasions where we need to process your 
personal information because it is in your vital interests, for 
example, if you become ill during your visit to one of our sites 
and we need to call for medical assistance.
HOW WE’LL USE INFORMATION ABOUT YOU 
When you arrange in advance to, or arrive at, one of our sites, we 
will need to collect the following information about you and*/**:
• First and last name
• Business name
• Vehicle registration number (if applicable)
• Arrival and departure times
This information will be used for the following purposes:
• In case there is an emergency on site
• To ensure site security is maintained
• To ensure appropriate and safe use of our car parks
Depending on your reasons for visiting our site, we may take 
photographs of you and if that is the case, we will make you 
aware that images are being recorded and for what purpose. 
If you do not want to have your image recorded (e.g. photo or 
video), then if it is not a security requirement, we will respect 
your wishes and not record you, or obfuscate your image from 
the record. 
CHANGE OF PURPOSE 
We will only use your personal information for the purposes for 
which we collected it, unless we reasonably consider that we 
need to use it for another reason and that reason is compatible 
with the original purpose. If we need to use your personal 
information for an unrelated purpose, we will usually notify you 
and we will explain the legal basis which allows us to do so. 
DISCLOSURE OF YOUR INFORMATION 
We are unlikely to share your personal information with anyone 
outside of the Company but if we do, we require all service 
providers (e.g. security or occupational health) and our Group 
companies that we share your personal information with to 
respect the privacy and security of your personal information 
and to treat it in accordance with the law. We do not allow our 
third-party service providers, including Group companies, to 
use your personal information for their own purposes and only 
permit them to process your personal information for specified 
purposes and in accordance with our instructions. 
Most of the personal information we collect about you will 
remain in the country you are employed. Where a service 
provider is based outside the UK or Canada, they are required 
to comply with the data protection law. If that is the case, we 
ensure a similar degree of protection is afforded by ensuring at 
least one of the following safeguards is implemented:
We will only transfer your personal information to countries that 
have been deemed to provide an adequate level of protection 
for personal information by the relevant regulator; or where 
we use certain service providers who are not in a ‘adequate’ 
country, we may use specific contracts approved by the 
regulator which give personal information the same protection 
it has in the UK or Canada as required.
If you would like to know the specific mechanism used by us 
when transferring your personal information out of the UK or

STORAGE OF YOUR PERSONAL INFORMATION 
We will only keep your personal information for as long as 
necessary to fulfil the relevant purpose(s) we collected it for, as 
set out above in this Notice, and for as long as we are required 
to keep it for legal purposes. 
To determine the appropriate retention period for personal 
information, we consider the amount, nature, and sensitivity 
of the personal information, the potential risk of harm from 
unauthorised use or disclosure of your personal information, the 
purposes for which we process your personal information and 
whether we can achieve those purposes through other means, 
and the applicable legal requirements. 
We have put in place appropriate security measures to prevent 
your personal information from being accidentally lost, used or 
accessed in an unauthorised way, altered or disclosed. 
In addition, we limit access to your personal information to 
those employees, agents, contractors and other third parties 
who have a business need to know that information. They will 
only process your personal information on our instructions, and 
they are subject to a duty of confidentiality. 
We have put in place procedures to deal with any suspected 
personal information breach and will notify you and any 
applicable regulator where appropriate. 
RIGHTS OF ACCESS, CORRECTION, ERASURE, AND 
RESTRICTION 
Your duty to inform us of changes
It is important that the personal information we hold about 
you is accurate and current. Please keep us informed if your 
personal information changes during your working relationship 
with us.
Your rights in connection with personal information
Data protection laws provide you with rights when your data 
is processed in the UK and Canada. Where you are not entitled 
to exercise a right, we will consider your request and feedback 
accordingly.
 ·  Request information about how and with who your personal 
information is being used or shared (UK and British Columbia)
·  Request access to your personal information. This enables 
you to receive a copy of the personal information we hold 
about you and to check that we are lawfully processing it (UK 
and Canada);
·  Request correction of the personal information that we 
hold about you. This enables you to have any incomplete or 
inaccurate information we hold about you corrected 
(UK and Canada);
·  Request erasure of your personal information in certain 
circumstances. This enables you to ask us to delete or 
remove personal information where there is no good reason 
for us continuing to process it. You also have the right to 
ask us to delete or remove your personal information where 
you have exercised your right to object to processing (see 
below). However, this is not an absolute right and there will 
be circumstances where we are required to retain your 
personal information even if you are no-longer an employee 
of ours, for example, to administer pension benefit (UK 
only); 
·  Request the restriction of processing of your personal 
information in certain circumstances. This enables you to 
ask us to suspend the processing of personal information 
about you, for example if you want us to establish its 
accuracy or the reason for processing (UK only);
·  Request the transfer of your personal information to 
yourself or another party (UK only).
You also have a Right to Object to the processing of your 
personal information where we are relying on a legitimate 
interest (or those of a third party) and there is something 
about your particular situation which makes you want to 
object to processing on this ground (UK only). 
If you want to exercise any of these rights, please contact us 
using the details in the “Contacting Us” section at the end of 
this notice.
Please note, you have the right to make a complaint at any 
time to the regulator for data protection issues as follows:
UK Information Commissioner’s Office (ICO)
Office of the Privacy Commissioner of Canada
Office of the Information & Privacy Commissioner for 
British Columbia
Office of the Information & Privacy Commissioner 
for Alberta
We would, however, appreciate the chance to deal with your  
concerns before you approach the regulator, so please 
contact us in the first instance using the contact details set 
out below.
You also have a right to request a file review by the regulator 
(Canada only)
No fee usually required
You will not usually have to pay a fee to access your personal 
information (or to exercise any of the other rights). However, 
we may charge a reasonable fee if your request for access is 
clearly unfounded or excessive. Alternatively, we may refuse 
to comply with the request in such circumstances.
What we may need from you
We may need to request specific information from you to help 
us confirm your identity and ensure your right to access the 
information (or to exercise any of your other rights). This is 
another appropriate security measure to ensure that personal 
information is not disclosed to any person who has no right to 
receive it.
Timing of our response
We do our best to respond to all legitimate requests within 30 
days. Occasionally, it may take us longer than a month if your 
request is particularly complex or you have made a number 
of requests. In this case, we will notify you and keep you 
updated.

RIGHT TO WITHDRAW CONSENT
In the limited circumstances where you may have provided 
your consent to the collection, processing and transfer 
of your personal information for a specific purpose, you 
have the right to withdraw your consent for that specific 
processing at any time (UK and Canada). 
To withdraw your consent, please contact us using the 
details in the “Contacting Us” section at the end of this 
notice. Once we have received notification that you have 
withdrawn your consent, we will no longer process your 
information for the purpose or purposes you originally 
agreed to, unless we have another legitimate basis for 
doing so in law.
