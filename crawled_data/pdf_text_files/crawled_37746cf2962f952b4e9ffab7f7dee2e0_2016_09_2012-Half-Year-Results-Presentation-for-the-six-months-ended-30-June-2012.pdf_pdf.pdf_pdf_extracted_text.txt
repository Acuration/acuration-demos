Regulation 
ROC Banding Review Decision 
Consultation conclusions 
1.0 ROC awarded for units fully converted to biomass 
10% additives allowed in converted units 
First unit conversions permitted in April 2013 
Sustainability criteria grandfathered to 2020 

Subject to no EU restrictions 
 
Other Consultation points 
Low / uneconomic support for co-firing below 50%

Power prices continue to be driven  
by gas market  
Despatch dynamics 

Plant efficiencies significant factor  
in load profiles 

Different load factors for same fuel plant 

Low GSS resulted in gas plant capacity 
withdrawn  / considered for closure 

Closure date announced for several  
opted-out coal plants 
System balancing support 

Drax will continue to play  
a significant role 

Wind output now ranges  
from nil – 6GW 

Summer / Winter low demand  
is c. 20GW / 32GW 
Bark spread weakened  
on lower power price

API2/4/6 
API2 is the main reference price (including cost, freight and insurance) for steam coal to be delivered to 
Amsterdam, Rotterdam and Antwerp. API4 is the reference price for steam coal to be delivered free on 
board (“FOB”) to Richards Bay, South Africa. API6 is the reference price for steam coal to be delivered 
FOB to Newcastle, Australia. 
AVERAGE ACHIEVED PRICE 
Power revenues divided by volume of net sales (includes imbalance charges). 
BM 
BALANCING MECHANISM 
The mechanism through which the System Operator can call upon additional generation/consumption 
or reduce generation/consumption, through market participants’ bids and offers, in order to balance the 
system minute by minute. 
CESP 
COMMUNITY ENERGY SAVING PROGRAMME 
CESP has been created as part of the Government's Home Energy Saving Programme. It requires gas 
and electricity suppliers and electricity generators to deliver energy saving measures to domestic 
consumers in specific low income areas of Great Britain. CESP came into force on 1 September 
2009.  The CESP obligation period will run from 1 October 2009 to 31 December 2012.

Appendix 1: Definitions 
LNG 
LIQUIFIED NATURAL GAS 
LTIR 
LOST TIME INJURY RATE 
The frequency rate calculated on the following basis (number of accidents/hours worked * 100,000). 
Accidents are defined as occurrences where the injured party is absent from work for more than 24 
hours. 
NERP

OFGEM 
OFFICE FOR GAS AND ELECTRICITY MARKETS 
OPTED-IN / OPTED-OUT 
An opted-in plant is a power station that has elected to comply with the LCPD emissions standards. 
Opted-out plant has not elected to comply and is therefore only permitted to run for 20,000 hours and

from eligible renewable sources.  
ROC 
RENEWABLES OBLIGATION CERTIFICATE 
The obligation requires licensed electricity suppliers to ensure that specified and increasing amounts of 
the electricity they supply are from renewable sources. Eligible generators of electricity using renewable 
energy sources receive a pre-specified number of ROCs per MWh of renewable power generation 
dependant on date of commission and technology. These certificates can then be traded.


Based on fuel (coal) consumption


Based on difference between Government’s 
(HMT) target carbon price trajectory  
and traded price 

For 2013 this is £19 - £14 = £5/tonne CO2;  
equivalent to £12/tonne coal 

For 2014 this is c. £10/tonne CO2;  
equivalent to £22/tonne coal

Mechanism 
Renewables Obligation (RO) –  
suppliers must source increasing  
volume of renewable power 
Obligation can be met in two ways; 

Surrender ROCs or pay a buy-out 
All buy-out funds recycled to suppliers 
that surrender ROCs 

Buy-out is mandated price with RPI 
indexation; currently c. £40/MWh 
Mechanism in place to ensure: 

Obligation increases annually; and 

Obligation > expected ROC production 
Cash flows 

Obligation is annual (April – March) 

ROCs surrendered or buy-out paid by  
1 September following March year end 

Recycled funds paid out in October

Cash Flows and Accounting 
ROC generation measured in annual 
compliance periods (April – March) 
ROC cash flows typically 6 months after 
annual compliance period ends 

Impacts working capital 
Drax historically recognised ROC benefit  
in P&L only at time of ROC sale 

Similar timing to cash flows 
Drax accounting change in 2012 –  
P&L benefit in period of ROC generation 

Matches ROC support with biomass fuel costs 

ROC value estimated based on market price 
No significant impact on earnings profile 
until ROC support increased (April 2013)  
Exploring opportunities to accelerate  
ROC cash flows  

Better match with earnings
