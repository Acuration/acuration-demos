Drax Biomass and BECCS technology plays a vital role in the UK energy system 
1. Drax is the largest single provider of secure supply in GB’s electricity system today
►
Drax Biomass units provide 2.6 GW of secure capacity and represent 4% of GB’s dispatchable capacity 
►
At times with the tightest margins over the last year (Jan 22-23) , Drax Biomass has consistently provided 5-11% of total generation and up to 
70% renewable generation. 
2. Security of supply will become more complex in the late 2020s as the capacity mix shifts to support decarbonisation, and would be made even more 
challenging without Drax biomass units
►
We expect a net loss of 4.5-6.3GW of secure capacity between now and 2027 as nuclear, coal, and older gas plants retire, a 
4 GW increase in peak demand, and a 25 GW increase in intermittent renewable capacity – so dispatchable capacity will fall from 93% to 85% of 
peak demand
►
Loss of Drax (and other) biomass units would further reduce dispatchable capacity to 80% of peak demand, increasing reliance on generation 
from intermittent renewables and imported gas during times of system stress. Availability of interconnector capacity at times of peak demand 
is uncertain. 
3. No established technology can feasibly replace Drax’s 2.6GW of biomass capacity by 2027 while ensuring security of supply without significantly 
increasing carbon emissions
►
Replacing Drax with gas generation would mean missing carbon targets and further increasing reliance on imported gas
►
Meeting decarbonisation targets without negative emissions from Drax BECCS will be more expensive, more difficult, and more risky
–
It would require accelerating decarbonisation in challenging sectors such as heating, industry, road transport, and including more behaviour 
change
–
It is more cost effective and lower risk to keep existing biomass open than to build additional new build or retrofit gas CCS capacity

Drax has been a key contributor to security of supply at times of low renewable output
A system with higher renewable capacity brings system operability and flexibility challenges. Generation 
from dispatchable sources is key to meeting demand at times of low renewable output. 
In Jan 22 - Jan 23, for the five periods with the lowest wind and tightest margin, biomass has consistently provided 5-
11% of total generation and, at times, more than 70% of the total renewable generation
Nuclear 
►
Current Capacity: 5.9GW
►
2.1GW due to retire by 2026 (Hartlepool,  Heysham 1) with 2.4GW by 
2028 or earlier (Heysham 2, Torness) 
►
Sizewell B (1.2GW) may be the only nuclear capacity in 2027, as Hinkley 
Point C (3.26GW) has high risk of delay beyond current stated 2027 date
Biomass 
►
Drax biomass (2.6GW) provides the majority of secure biomass supply, 
with Lynemouth (400MW) and Wilton (30MW) providing additional 
capacity. 
►
With the conversion from two biomass units to BECCS units, this delivers 
secure, renewable, and dispatchable capacity with negative emissions. 
Coal
►
100% of coal generation provided by Ratcliffe on Soar units (1 unit due to 
close in March 2023 and remaining 3 units by Sept 2024) 
►
All unabated coal due to decommission by October 2024 in line with UK 
net zero targets 
Gas 
►
A number of older and less efficient assets in the gas CCGT fleet are 
expected to retire in the coming years.
►
Retirements are partially offset by new CCGT deployment and the first 
gas CCUS capacity coming online in the late 2020s.

Without Drax BECCS, decarbonising will be harder, more expensive and more risky
In the absence of Drax-BECCS, the energy system needs to deploy more difficult and expensive 
decarbonisation options in heating, industry, and road transport or emissions targets will be missed
►
In the absence of Drax-BECCS, greater decarbonisation efforts are 
needed across other sectors of the economy. 
►
During the period of the Fifth Carbon Budget, this would mean a 
25% increase in the required reduction in domestic heating 
emissions.
►
This is approximately equivalent to fitting an extra 0.5m heat 
pumps on top of the circa 3m already expected – equivalent to a 
city the size of Birmingham. 
►
Road transport requires a further 5% in emissions reduction without 
Drax-BECCS. 
►
This is equivalent to replacing an extra 700k vans with hybrid or 
electric variants, in addition to the 900k hybrid vans and over 
10m electric cars already required by 2032.
►
Without Drax, significant extra renewable capacity is also required. 
►
An additional 10 GW of solar, requiring approximately 40,000 
acres of land use, or 20,000 football pitches.
►
An extra 4 GW of wind,  over and above the circa 60 GW that is 
already  anticipated in the case where Drax is retained. 
►
Published analysis has indicated that these alternative options 
would add billions to the cost of transition

Small changes in capture rate assumptions for 
gas CCS have important implications for 
emissions intensity for gas CCS.
Under most scenarios, retaining and running 
biomass units is cost effective compared to the 
gas CCS alternative, especially at 40% load factor 
expected for gas CCS.

* We assume a range of 90-95% capture efficiency for gas CCS technologies. ** Gas has up to twice the level of supply chain and indirect emissions, depending on fugitive emissions.  All prices are real 2022.  
Biomass and gas CCS are both options for low carbon dispatchable generation - but they have key differences:
Existing biomass has very low capex but comparatively high fuel cost. This reverse is true for gas with CCS. 
It is more cost effective to keep existing biomass open than to build additional new build or retrofit gas CCS capacity. Expected
costs are £82-129/MWh for biomass compared to £116-144/MWh for gas with CCS
Gas with CCS presents greater delivery risk and performance risk (as it is new build) and increases reliance on imported gas
Gas with CCS has potentially significantly higher greenhouse gas emissions depending on capture rate and upstream emissions

Renewables, particularly wind, are highly variable and exposed to extended periods with 
low or no output
For security of supply, National Grid assumes wind will generate at a minimum of 7-
11% of its installed capacity* at times of system stress
In 2021, a relatively low wind year, there were 30 instances where the GB wind fleet 
load factor was below 11% for 24 hours or longer.
The shortfall was made up by thermal generators, particularly gas and biomass which 
ran at close to full output
This will not be possible in the future: all coal will have closed and prolonged 
generation from unabated gas is not compatible with emissions reductions
Retaining biomass capacity means greater diversity of fuels and reduces reliance on 
natural gas
Given the online capacity for wind and solar is to increase by 25GW from 2023 to 2027, secure reliable and low carbon 
alternatives are needed on the system
