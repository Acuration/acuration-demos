Headlines
There is a new groundswell of support for tackling the global environmental 
crisis head on and reducing carbon emissions to — or even below — zero. 
School strikes for climate, led by Greta Thunberg, have become a global 
movement in a matter of months. David Attenborough’s Climate Change: 
The Facts was the BBC’s first documentary in over a decade to cover “Earth’s 
greatest threat in over 1000 years”. Extinction Rebellion closed parts of 
London for a week to protest against inaction over climate change. MPs have 
made history by passing the world’s first declaration of an “environmental and 
climate change emergency”.
The UK is in a position of strength. It is again a top performer in PWC’s Low 
Carbon Economy Index, and was ranked #2 at COP24 for transforming its 
energy system. Much of this is due to progress in the electricity sector, but as 
the quick win of phasing out coal nears completion, further decarbonisation is 
slowing and the UK risks missing its carbon targets for 2025 and beyond.
The Committee on Climate Change spells out what is required in its landmark 
report on achieving net-zero emissions by 2050. Britain must redouble its 
commitment to renewables: despite costs falling dramatically, less new 
capacity is being built than at any time since 2010, and the UK has continued 
to fall in the EY Renewable Energy Country Attractiveness Index. Britain’s 
power system should continue to lead the way on emissions cuts, rapidly 
heading towards zero in the 2020s. This must then be followed by rolling out 
bioenergy with CCS, hydrogen, and smart new tools to improve flexibility. 
The electricity sector should then expand to provide clean heating and 
transportation by ramping up the market for electric vehicles (which are 
around 3% of new sales today) and electric heat pumps (around 1% of new 
home heating systems).
This quarter, Electric Insights looks at how low Britain’s power system can 
go, in terms of fossil fuels and carbon emissions, because of the key limiting 
factor: how much controllable generation we need. National Grid ESO’s Head 
of National Control discusses their roadmap for operating a zero carbon 
system in 2025. Our second article looks at what to do when the wind doesn’t 
blow. The three main options: interconnection, storage and conventional 
fuels all have roles to play in balancing out lulls in wind output. 
Britain’s interconnection received a boost as the Nemo link to Belgium 
opened at the end of January. This pushed imports to record highs, and 
meant that more than a tenth of our electricity was produced abroad for the 
first time ever. We take a look at our neighbouring power systems and where 
Britain’s imports come from.

The three months to March saw large changes in the power system from 
Q1 2018. The capacity and production statistics reveal that the mild winter 
kept demand low, coal output fell by two-thirds, and interconnectors saw 
the highest running hours of any technology. Finally, following on from last 
quarter’s article, Electric Insights now includes a quarterly update on all of 
Britain’s power system records. This quarter, 22 of the records we cover  
were toppled.

1. How low can we go?
Just how low can Britain’s power system go in terms of fossil fuels and carbon emissions? 
Does Britain’s geography necessitate a minimum amount of dispatchable, flexible and thermal 
power on the system? Being an island, it is more expensive for us to build electrical links to 
other countries, than it is for example Germany to build them across its land borders. Similarly, 
our lack of mountains means that pumped hydro is never going to provide weeks or months of 
storage. Britain faces more challenges than most in this area, but that does not dampen the 
ambition for zero carbon electricity.
Last month National Grid ESO announced it will be ready to operate a zero-carbon electricity 
system by 2025. This would mean that as more renewables and nuclear power come online, 
the power system can be operated safely and securely at times when they are able to supply 
all demand. With over 43 GW of wind, solar and nuclear capacity already installed and demand 
averaging 35 GW last year, this situation is already a real possibility. 
Wind, solar and nuclear have provided up to 88.5% of Britain’s electricity at one moment in 
time. What prevents them going further? The current solution is instead to curtail (or waste) 
some renewable generation and bring on flexible fossil generators (coal and gas) to keep the 
system stable. This sends power prices negative and increases emissions, as happened for six 
hours straight on a sunny, windy day in March. The key problem is that the grid needs many 
services to run safely: reserve, inertia, frequency response and voltage support to name a few; 
and these are currently provided by flexible and dispatchable technologies.
All of Britain’s electricity came from flexible and controllable sources (coal, oil, gas and hydro) 
until the world’s first commercial nuclear reactor opened at Calder Hall in 1956. Over the next 
four decades this share gradually moved down to 75% as nuclear came into the mix.1 As shown 
below, the last ten years have seen a greater change than the previous fifty – this year is set 
to be the first when less than half of the country’s electricity comes from fully dispatchable 
sources.
The share of generation from fossil fuels, biomass and hydro 2

Note that Britain’s older gas-cooled nuclear reactors are not flexible and cannot reduce output to follow load. Newer water-cooled reactors such as the EPR being 
built at Hinkley Point C should have similar flexibility to other conventional power plants.

Thermal power stations (coal, oil, gas and biomass) and hydro are the technologies which can provide the full set of system services at present.

The share of controllable generation has fallen by 3% per year over the last 
decade. National Grid’s Future Energy Scenarios sees this trend continuing 
into the mid-2020s, as Britain sources more of its electricity from wind and 
solar, and imports more from abroad. The share of fully-dispatchable British 
electricity generation may fall to just one quarter in as little as ten years, 
before settling at between 8% and 21% in the 2040s.
As always, year-round averages do not tell the whole story, and it is the 
hour-to-hour variation which matters with electricity. Since 2016 the power 
system has seen periods with less than a quarter of electricity coming from 
conventional sources (as shown by the red circles). Last year on an August 
night, a low of 15% was reached, with just 2.4 GW being produced from fossil 
fuels. The question now is how to squeeze out this last couple of gigawatts of 
fossil fuels?
This will require a radical departure from the traditional ways of planning, 
analysing and operating power systems. National Grid ESO has set out 
a roadmap for achieving this over the next five years: from defining new 
services and regional requirements to them, building new markets for these 
services, allowing more technologies into these markets,3 increasing the 
deployment of storage, and using AI to improve the forecasting tools for wind 
and solar power.
Other system operators at the forefront of renewables integration are 
trialling their own approaches. Australia uses mandates: new wind and 
solar farms must install their own technical solutions (such as flywheels) to 
provide system services. California has opted for central regulation: their 
grid operator decides how much storage (or other flexible solutions) to build 
and then runs these much like the transmission wires. National Grid ESO is 
instead taking the market-led approach: defining the need for services and 
creating the marketplaces for trading them. Their aim is to allow companies 
to innovate and compete to find out how these services can then be delivered 
most efficiently. 
Of course, running a traditionally fossil-fuelled power system at zero carbon 
on average will be much more difficult than running it for half an hour at a 
time. Ultimately, the aim is not just to cope with single periods. Having the 
tools and systems in place to run for a single hour at zero carbon will mean 
the grid is ready and capable to run for longer. Britain quickly moved from 
seeing the first ever zero-coal hour to having the first day, first weekend, 
and most recently a whole week without coal. In five years’ time we could 
well be repeating the same exciting process, but with zero fossil fuels, and 
zero carbon. To quote Fintan Slye, director of National Grid ESO, “Operating 
a zero-carbon electricity system in 2025 is a major stepping stone to the full 
decarbonisation of the entire electricity system”.

2. What to do when the wind doesn’t blow?
Some call it intermittency, some call it variability; the simple fact is we 
cannot control the wind. Britain’s wind farm output swings widely from one 
week to the next, caused by high- and low-pressure weather systems passing 
over the country. 
Wind output can vary from 2 GW one day to 12 GW the next,1 and Britain can 
experience long lulls in wind output. For example, the mini heatwave at the 
end of February saw a 6-day long collapse in wind output. So, how can Britain 
balance out the variability that wind power brings?
From the chart below it is clear that gas is the main source of flexibility at the 
moment. We have sufficient capacity, and it is sufficiently flexible to ramp up 
or down by 10+ GW when needed. Nuclear output is stable over the course 
of the year, only varying due to maintenance. Coal provides extra balancing 
during the coldest weather (when gas prices are higher), but at most it flexed 
up and down by 5 GW (daily average) during January. Hydro and biomass also 
provide flexibility, but together they are dwarfed by the swings in wind power. 
Finally, interconnectors ought to provide flexibility, but at the moment it is 
more profitable to import at full power regardless of what the wind is doing.

Britain has around 20 GW of wind capacity today, but National Grid and BEIS 
expect this could double to 40 GW in as little as seven years.2 Doubling the 
current levels of volatility at a time when coal capacity is retiring will test the 
whole electricity system, and likely require new sources of flexibility. Three 
key options are available to us: (1) more interconnection, (2) energy storage, 
(3) new fuels such as hydrogen, or (4) using existing fuels to back up wind 
farms. 
Further interconnection could help, but weather systems cover large areas, 
meaning wind speeds tend to be correlated. Research has shown that 
countries across Northern Europe tend to experience high or low wind output 
at the same time.
Balancing the wind with energy storage would need radically different 
technologies to those we have today. Britain’s pumped hydro storage plants 
usually operate on a daily cycle, charging up overnight and discharging during 
the day (although they are increasingly used to provide rapid response to grid 
fluctuations). Lithium ion batteries are for even shorter durations, typically 
holding less than 4 hours of charge, rather than the several days needed to 
balance out wind lulls. Electric vehicles, homes and offices could provide a 
large new source of flexibility in the near future, through vehicle-to-grid (V2G) 
and demand-side response (DSR).
Hydrogen has the potential to offer large-scale energy storage, as it could 
use the UK’s geological formations to provide weeks, or even months, of 
backup. Hydrogen could be produced from excess renewable power at times 
of surplus, or from natural gas with carbon capture. Hydrogen sorely needs 
technological scale-up and cost reductions to become a competitive option, 
but hydrogen could prove pivotal in the UK meeting its economy-wide carbon 
reduction targets by offering zero-emission heating for homes and powering 
long distance and heavy goods vehicles. 
Sticking to the present day, fossil fuels provide an almost-ideal 
counterbalance. They have a high energy density, are easy to store, and we 
already have the infrastructure in place to transport and use them. However, 
in a carbon-constrained world, we cannot continue indefinitely using 
unabated coal or gas to backup renewables. Biomass is an alternative, but we 
only have 3.2 GW today, and this is not expected to grow significantly over the 
coming decades. Ultimately, a mix of all these solutions will likely be the best 
route forwards.

3. 10% of electricity now generated abroad
A new interconnector to Belgium has pushed British electricity imports to 
record highs. At the start of this year, the £600m Nemo link between Kent 
and Zeebrugge in Belgium came online. It adds 1 GW – or 25% – to Britain’s 
connections with neighbouring countries. The link has imported power to 
Britain every day it has been in operation, exploiting the price differential 
between electricity markets on either side of the channel.
Averaged over the first three months of 2019, power was almost £10/MWh 
cheaper to buy on the continent. Electricity traded at £52/MWh in Britain, 
while in Belgium it was just £42.70/MWh. Belgium has the lowest natural gas 
prices in Europe, and their power stations pay £16 per tonne less for carbon 
emissions than their counterparts in Britain. This helps to explain why Britain 
exported to Belgium for only 2.5 hours out of the 2 months the link has been 
running.
As a result, Britain has fallen below 90% self-sufficiency for electricity 
generation for the first time ever. In February and March, a tenth of Britain’s 
electricity has been imported from Europe, with 2.3% coming from Belgium. 
While this is record levels for electricity, it is low compared to other forms of 
energy. Britain imports around half of its crude oil and two-thirds of its natural 
gas (primarily from Norway).1 Despite our heritage as a coal-mining country, 
now 80% of the coal we burn is imported, primarily from Russia and the US. 
Domestic coal mining fell to 2.6 million tonnes last year, the lowest level since 
records began.1

4. Where do Britain’s imports come from?
As Britain’s electricity imports are on the rise, we look at how our neighbouring countries generate their 
electricity. Europe’s electricity mix is diverse, ranging from fully-renewable through to heavy reliance on coal 
and gas. The graphic below details where our imported electricity comes from – mapping the current and 
proposed interconnectors to Britain, and the makeup of each of our neighbours’ power systems. 
Britain currently have five interconnectors: 2 GW to France, 0.5 GW each to Northern Ireland and the Republic 
of Ireland, and 1 GW each to the Netherlands and Belgium. The British and Irish power systems trade back and 
forth on a roughly equal footing, but the other links primarily export to us. The share of power coming from 
each country is mainly governed by the size of their links. Around half of Britain’s imports came from France, 
and a quarter each from Belgium and the Netherlands. 
Imports from Belgium are mostly nuclear and gas, and are similar in their carbon content to British electricity 
(183 g/kWh in Belgium versus 227 g/kWh here, averaged over 2017–18). Belgian electricity is much cleaner than 
imports from the Netherlands or Ireland, which primarily burn gas and coal. France is our cleanest connected 
neighbour, with 90% of their electricity coming from nuclear and renewables.
More links to France and Ireland are in the pipeline, followed by longer cables to Norway, Denmark and 
Germany. Norway has one of the cleanest electricity systems in the world, as their abundant mountain ranges 
mean they run on 95% hydro power. Denmark and Germany are renowned for their large shares of wind power, 
but these are backed up almost exclusively by coal, or its even dirtier cousin, lignite.

5. Capacity and production statistics
This quarter saw some significant changes from the first three months of 
2018. Winter was particularly mild, with average temperatures 2°C higher than 
last year, meaning demand was down by 6%. Nuclear output is 16% lower than 
last year as five reactors are down for maintenance, including two extended 
outages due to cracks being found. 
Coal output was also down by two-thirds, and no coal was burnt for electricity 
for 581 hours over the quarter (27% of the time). Zero-coal hours have shot up 
from 0 in Q1 2017, and just 71 in Q1 2018. As we predicted last quarter, Britain’s 
solar panels have now beaten coal over the past 12 months – supplying 1.3 
GW on average versus 1.1 GW. The warm sunny spells meant we saw midday 
periods when solar was the second largest source of electricity during 
February.
Power prices fell by almost a third from £61/MWh at the end of last year to £43/
MWh in March. Lower fuel prices, and high wind output helped to suppress 
prices, even though the price of carbon emissions rose to a 10-year high.
Outages meant Britain’s nuclear reactors only ran at 64% of nominal capacity. 
In comparison, Britain’s interconnectors were the most heavily utilised 
technology, averaging 71%. Britain imported an average of 3.75 GW during 
February and March, and at no point did imports fall below 1.4 GW.

Other statistical sources give different values because of the types of plant they consider. For example, BEIS Energy Trends records an 
additional 0.7 GW of hydro, 0.6 GW of biomass and 3 GW of small waste-to-energy plants. These plants and their output are not visible 
to the electricity transmission system and so cannot be reported on here.

We include an estimate of the installed capacity of smaller storage devices which are not monitored by the electricity market 
operator. Britain’s storage capacity is made up of 2.9 GW of pumped hydro storage, 0.6 GW of lithium-ion batteries, 0.4 GW of 
flywheels and 0.3 GW of compressed air.

6. Britain’s power system records
This year we have begun keeping track of all the record highs and lows on Britain’s power 
system. The tables below look over the past decade (2009 to 2019) and report the record 
output and share of electricity generation, plus sustained averages over a day, a month and 
a calendar year.1 Cells highlighted in blue are records that were broken in the first quarter of 
2019. Each record links to the date it occurred on the Electric Insights website, allowing the 
data to be explored visually. 
Wind power broke several records this quarter, exceeding 15.3 GW on Sunday February 8th, 
and generating almost half of Britain’s electricity on Friday January 13th. Biomass also had a 
record day, supplying just shy of a tenth of Britain’s electricity on Sunday March 31st. Monthly 
generation from all low carbon sources (renewables, nuclear and French imports) came close 
to averaging 20 GW during March.

All records for electricity imports were broken as the Nemo interconnector began operation 
(except the highest year, which was 2018). The greater connectivity meant one export record 
was also broken – with Britain exporting almost 10% of its generation, beating the previous 
record of 9.3% that has stood since 2011.

Note that Britain has no inter-seasonal electricity storage, so we only report on half-hourly and daily records. Elexon and National Grid only report the output of large pumped hydro storage

While fossil fuels are generally on the decline in Britain, gas-fired power stations hit new 
record outputs on Thursday January 24th, as freezing weather and low wind speeds coincided. 
Gas power stations produced more than 27 GW for the first time ever, and more than 24 GW 
averaged over the whole day.
March this year had the cleanest electricity mix on record, with 36% renewables and 17% 
nuclear versus just 38% fossil fuels. Carbon emissions were 3 g/kWh lower than the previous 
record from August 2018.
