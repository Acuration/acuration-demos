Appendix 14.2 Tourism Business Survey 
1.14.1 This analysis summarises the key findings from the local tourism business 
survey carried out during November and December 2014. The survey 
population included all businesses which could be considered to derive part of 
or all of their trade from tourism within the defined study area.  The study area 
was selected as it was considered unlikely that tourism businesses located 
outside this would experience either beneficial or adverse impacts (tourism 
study area described at paragraph 14.5.2).  
1.14.2 The analysis provides a detailed understanding of the potential impacts 
perceived by businesses as a result of the Project. Businesses were identified 
mainly through internet searches1 with 58 tourism related businesses 
identified.  The survey had a response rate of 29%.  
Location of respondents

Area with over half of respondents from either Ammanford, Pontardawe,

1.14.4 The highest proportion of respondents were from bar and pub owners with 
accommodation providers accounting for around a quarter of responses. 
Number of Employees 
1.14.5 The average number of employees was eight indicating the majority of 
businesses are small scale.  
Customer base

1.14.6 Over half of the respondent’s trade comes from local customers.  Over a tenth 
of trade is from business visitors.  Around a quarter of trade comes from 
tourists and leisure visitors.  This suggests that respondent businesses are 
less reliant on tourist/visitor trade within the study area.

1.14.11 Tourism related operators have an optimistic outlook of future prospects in the 
study area with all respondents predicting either stable or increased 
performance. No business reported that they felt that their business would

Business trends

trends. The most frequently mentioned were weather and reputation.   Other 
important factors mentioned included product, price and value for money.  
Occupancy rate  
1.14.13 Accommodation business respondents were asked about their occupancy rate

question reporting average peak season occupancy of 100% and an average 
off-peak figure of 78%.   
Business Survey: Baseline conclusion 
1.14.14 Of the 58 businesses surveyed, 17 responded to the tourism business survey 
questionnaire, giving a 29% response rate.  
1.14.15 A high proportion of responses were from businesses located in Pontardawe 
and Bryncoch.   A number of the businesses were small in size. 
1.14.16 The highest proportion of responses was from bars and pubs. The survey 
identified that a high proportion of trade was from local customers. The origins 
tourist/visitor customers were mainly from the UK.

going on long and short walks, as well as sightseeing.

level of business increase.

the most influential factors impacting upon business trends. 
Tourism Business Survey – Impact Analysis 
1.14.20 This section analyses the business survey responses in terms of perceived 
impact on business performance and the wider South-West Wales tourism 
product2.  
Figure 14.8 Perceived Impacts of Project on business performance 
 
 
1.14.21 All 17 respondents provided an answer as to what impact they felt the Project 
would have on their business.  The vast majority of respondents considered 
that it would have no impact on their business.  A number of these 
respondents considered that the Project was too far away from their business 
to affect them directly.  Others stated that they didn’t get many tourists as the 
area is not on the tourist trail.     
1.14.22 Three respondents suggested that the Project could have varying degrees of 
beneficial impact on their business performance.  These businesses felt they 
could benefit from accommodating construction workers, with one business 
claiming that they had a positive experience of workers staying for other 
construction projects. 
1.14.23 Only one business considered the Project would have an adverse impact on 
their business. The main reason given for this response was the potential 
visual impact of the Project. The respondent also had concerns over potential 
                                                      
2 Impacts were categorised as follows: Low Impact (<10 %); Medium Impact (10-15 %); and High Impact (>15 %). The 
definitions of magnitude - Major adverse taken as >15% on business turnover, Moderate adverse taken as 10-14%, and Minor 
adverse taken as <10% - are based on market experience (Criteria outlined in methodology section).

traffic congestion issues as other energy infrastructure projects e.g. the nearby 
solar project have caused disruption previously.   
Figure 14.9 Perceived Impacts of Project on South-West Wales Tourism 
 
 
1.14.24 Businesses were also asked to indicate what they expected the impact might 
be on South-Wales tourism in general. Over two-thirds of respondents 
considered that it would have no impact on tourism and visitor numbers, with a 
further 15% considering any adverse impact to be low or minimal.  
1.14.25 One respondent perceived there to be a medium adverse impact (located in 
Pontardawe), whilst another respondent located in Felindre predicted a high 
adverse impact. Concerns raised by respondents primarily related to potential 
visual impacts.  Other concerns related to potential air quality and traffic 
impacts.  One respondent felt that there was already too much energy 
infrastructure in the area.  
Duration of Adverse Effects 
1.14.26 Of those respondents who considered there to be adverse impacts half felt the 
impacts would last for the life of the Project.  The other half felt that adverse 
impacts would be experienced during both the construction and operation of 
the Project.  
Duration of Beneficial Effects 
1.14.27 Of those respondents who considered there to be beneficial impacts the 
majority felt the impacts would be during the construction phase only. A fifth of 
respondents felt that beneficial impacts would be for the life of the Project.  
Potential Benefits  
1.14.28 Respondents were asked to consider how the Project could benefit their 
business. The majority of these responses related to provision of 
accommodation and food and drink, particularly during the construction phase.

Conclusion  
1.14.29 In terms of impact, the vast majority of respondents felt that the Project would 
have no impact on business performance.  Some businesses felt that they 
would benefit at the construction phase through related demand for 
accommodation, food and drink and other services.    
1.14.30 Only one respondent predicted an adverse impact on business performance 
based mainly on perceived adverse visual impact. 
1.14.31 The majority of respondents felt that the Project would have either no or low 
adverse impact on tourism in South Wales.  Less than a fifth expected the 
impact to be either medium or high adverse, with visual impact and potential 
traffic congestion (during construction) cited as the main factors.   
1.14.32 Overall, the business survey analysis has shown that a number of 
accommodation providers, food and drink and other similar businesses in the 
study area are not reliant on tourism trade and are reporting high/increasing 
business confidence.  The vast majority of respondents do not predict any 
significantly adverse impact on either their own business performance or the 
wider South-West Wales tourism offer.   
1.14.33 The magnitude of change as perceived by the respondents to the business 
survey is assessed as being minor. 
1.14.34 The potential effect of the Project on tourism businesses in the area is 
assessed as being of slight significance, given the low sensitivity of the area in 
tourism terms and the minor magnitude of change.  This assessment is 
derived from the methodology set out in Table 14.8.
