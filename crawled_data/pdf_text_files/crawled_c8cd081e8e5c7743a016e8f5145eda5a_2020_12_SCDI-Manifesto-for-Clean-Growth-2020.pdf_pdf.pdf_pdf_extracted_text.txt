Manifesto for Clean Growth – Clean Growth Leadership Group
Clean Growth Leadership Group
SCDI’s Clean Growth Leadership Group brings together partners from across the public, private and third 
sectors to lead the way to Net Zero.
We published an interim report in June, Building Scotland’s Green Recovery. Our plan for Scotland’s Green 
Recovery from the COVID-19 crisis featured 12 big ideas to respond to the climate emergency with the same 
urgency as the public health emergency.
This new report builds on that work and looks beyond the immediate crisis towards the horizon of 2045 and 
asks: 
What are the Clean Growth opportunities for Scotland of the transition to Net Zero – 
and how can we maximise them?
We have engaged with businesses, organisations, experts and stakeholders across all sectors and all geographies 
of the Scottish economy. Interviews, roundtables and surveys throughout 2020 have helped to inform this 
report and its recommendations. Our ideas are backed by business and have been shaped by SCDI’s diverse 
membership.
We all have our part to play in Scotland’s Clean Growth future and this report sets out how we can work 
together to accelerate the pace of change.
Our Vision
We believe Scotland’s social, economic and natural resources – from our skilled workforce and unrivalled 
landscape, to our innovative businesses and world-class colleges and universities – give us unique advantages 
which we can leverage to capture the economic value of the global transition to Net Zero.
Our vision is for Scotland to be a world leader in Clean Growth which delivers for people, for our economy and 
for our planet:

Scotland’s Clean Growth opportunities
This report identifies 7 Clean Growth opportunities and 21 priority actions for Scotland. It makes 
recommendations to government, business and industry, academia and education, regulators, investors, 
communities and citizens about how we can each contribute, and how we can collaborate with each other, to 
maximise them.
Together, they represent our Manifesto for Clean Growth:
1 
INDUSTRY 
Transform Industry
We can establish world-leading 
circular and bio economies 
in Scotland to transform and 
decarbonise industry to boost 
innovation, protect jobs and 
create green jobs in the new green 
sectors of the Net Zero economy

Zero Waste Scotland should 
bring forward plans for repair, 
durability and sustainability 
ratings for all electronic 
and household appliances 
supported by a national repair 
network
B Industry should build 
sectoral and cross-sectoral 
partnerships which develop 
circular expertise, innovations, 
strategies and new supply 
chains for reuse materials and 
repairs with support from 
Zero Waste Scotland, SEPA 
and Innovation Centres
C UK Government and Scottish 
Government should back 
biotechnological innovation

to decarbonise, transform 
Grangemouth into a 
biorefinery and protect jobs 
through public investment, 
innovation, incentives and 
innovation support
2
ENERGY 
Clean Energy Innovation 
World Leader
We can build on our existing 
world-class energy expertise 
to maximise renewable energy 
generation and flexible storage, 
pioneer CCUS and build a 
hydrogen economy to create green 
jobs, strengthen domestic supply 
chains and lead in the Clean 
Growth technologies of the future

Scottish Government to 
build an internationally 
competitive domestic supply 
chain for renewable energy 
manufacturing and related 
services and increase local 
content in equipment and 
people
B UK Government should 
bring forward the necessary 
funding to accelerate the 
Acorn CCS Project and 
establish a CCS Hub at St 
Fergus as one of the UK’s four 
clusters
C Scottish Government and UK 
Government should invest in 
innovation, infrastructure and 
incentives to scale-up green

Scottish Government should 
work together to revisit 
the potential for a national 
model of road user pricing 
or similar measures to 
address congestion and fund 
future low- and zero-carbon 
infrastructure
B Industry should work with 
Scottish Government and 
local authorities to accelerate 
the building of a national 
network of EV and Ultra-
Fast charging and hydrogen 
refuelling points as an urgent 
priority
C UK Government, Scottish 
Government, industry and 
communities should work 
together to reduce demand 
for travel and level the digital 
playing field by connecting all 
of Scotland with future-proof 
5G infrastructure, prioritising 
rollout in hardest-to-reach 
communities
4
PLACE

We can lock-in local value, 
increase planning ambition 
and resources, accelerate 
retrofit, decarbonise heat and 
raise building standards to 
build and nurture sustainable, 
resilient and thriving 
communities 
A Public sector should 
mobilise total public 
spending of £81 billion 
in Scotland for Clean 
Growth through 
Community Wealth 
Building to create local, 
green jobs, build local, 
resilient supply chains and 
back inclusive, sustainable 
business models
B National Planning 
Framework 4 should 
recognise a presumption 
in favour for Net Zero 
developments within 
the context of plan-led 
development
C Scottish Government 
should provide strategic 
ambition, regulatory 
certainty, support 
businesses to adapt and 
innovate and implement 
an ambitious Net Zero 
Standard for all new 
buildings by 2023

PEOPLE 
Green Skills Revolution
We can drive a Green Skills 
Revolution which builds 
green skills across society 
and invests in the reskilling, 
upskilling and lifelong learning 
of our people to prepare them 
for the green industries of the 
future to create new green 
jobs, boost productivity, raise 
wages and attract inward 
investment
A All schools, colleges, 
universities, training 
providers and employers 
should embed core 
green skills and carbon 
literacy across curricula, 
professional learning and 
work-based learning
B Scottish Government 
should coordinate a 
voluntary, inclusive 
and accessible 
National Service for 
Net Zero programme 
of employment 
and volunteering 
opportunities across 
the public, private and 
third sectors backed by a 
Green Skills Passport
C Scottish Government 
should create a Reskilling 
and Upskilling Fund which 
empowers every Scottish 
adult to fund reskilling or 
upskilling opportunities at 
any stage of their life or 
career
6
FINANCE 
Close the 
Investment Gap
We can deliver a green 
stimulus, unlock green finance 
and recognise climate risks 
to fund the transition to Net 
Zero, deliver co-benefits 
for society, economy and 
environment and establish 
Scotland as a world leader 
in ethical, responsible and 
sustainable investment
A UK Government and 
Scottish Government 
should scale-up public 
investment funded 
through additional 
affordable borrowing 
and taxation of carbon 
emissions to deliver a 
large-scale green stimulus
B Scottish Government 
should develop the Inward 
Investment Plan into a Net 
Zero inward investment 
proposition which 
positions Scotland as 
the home of sustainable 
business
C UK Government should 
work with industry and 
devolved administrations 
to agree a new carbon 
pricing mechanism 
which aligns with Net 
Zero, fully accounts for 
carbon emissions and 
helps to funds Clean 
Growth innovation and 
infrastructure, including 
supporting a viable 
business model for CCUS

NATURE
Nature-Rich Future
We can reverse biodiversity 
loss, transform agriculture, 
support sustainable forestry, 
restore our peatlands and 
grow the Blue Economy to 
ensure a nature-rich future for 
all of Scotland
A Scottish Government 
should recognise the 
nature emergency and set 
ambitious nature targets 
to reverse biodiversity 
loss which are aligned 
with Scotland’s climate 
targets
B Scottish Government 
should propose a new 
system of farm support 
payments which protects 
and restores biodiversity, 
support innovative 
and sustainable food 
production and is aligned 
with expanded and 
strengthened advisory 
services for farmers and 
crofters
C Scottish Government, its 
agencies, industry and 
academia should work 
together to shape and 
deliver the Blue Economy 
Action Plan, doubling the 
size of the sector by 2030 
and positioning Scotland 
as a global leader in 
marine innovation and 
sustainability

The Way Forward
We know that this report is just the beginning. We know that the costs and challenges of delivery and the 
transition to Net Zero will be high – but the costs of failing to act for people, our economy and our planet will be 
even higher.
We must act and invest now to maximise Scotland’s Clean Growth opportunities and to achieve Net Zero by 
2045, giving real confidence and fresh hope to our young people and to future generations. The returns will also 
be high and we can all reap the rewards in the years and decades ahead.
We therefore propose 7 fundamental principles for the way forward to inform the implementation of our ideas:
1. Ambition
 
We all need to act with ambition to make Scotland a world leader in Clean Growth, because of the scale of 
the opportunity to strengthen social, economic and environmental prosperity.
 
2. Collaboration
 
We all need to work together to achieve Net Zero by 2045, because of the complexity and scale of the 
challenge. This should be the starting point of any action.
3. Integration
 
We need to think holistically and develop cross-sectoral partnerships and plans, because silos will create 
unintended consequences. We should provide certainty and foresight to allow businesses and individuals to 
prepare and adapt.
4. Fairness
 
We need to deliver a Just Transition which leaves no one and no community behind, because we cannot 
accept or afford inequality.
5. Governance
 
We need robust national governance and oversight to coordinate delivery, because there are many different 
actors across Scotland’s economy and society which need to play their part to achieve Net Zero by 2045.
6. Pace
 
We all need to act with urgency to respond to the climate and nature emergencies and to maximise Clean 
Growth in Scotland, because time is short to save the planet and build our competitive advantage. We should 
be happy to test and learn what works, be comfortable with incomplete knowledge and accept that failure is a 
risk worth taking.
7. Strategy
 
We need to think strategically and develop long-term partnerships and plans, because systemic change can 
be difficult and will take time. We should take this opportunity to start and continue a national dialogue about 
how we meet any funding gaps, realising that our investments will also bring economic opportunities.

CDI’s Clean Growth Leadership Group 
launched in January 2020 to bring together 
partners from across the public, private and 
third sectors to lead the way to Net Zero. Our 
vision is for Scotland to be a world leader in Clean 
Growth. Our mission is to help make it happen.
We have engaged with businesses, organisations, 
experts and stakeholders across all sectors and all 
geographies of the Scottish economy. Our rigorous 
evidence-build process of interviews, round tables and 
surveys over several months has helped us to develop 
ideas backed by business and shaped by SCDI’s 
diverse membership.
We all have a part to play. We hope to inspire ambition 
and spur action across our economy and our society 
by government, business and industry, academia and 
education, regulators, investors, communities and 
citizens.
We published an interim report in June, Building 
Scotland’s Green Recovery. Our plan for Scotland’s 
Green Recovery from the COVID-19 crisis featured 
12 big ideas to respond to the climate emergency with 
the same urgency as the public health emergency.
This new report builds on that work and looks beyond 
the immediate crisis towards the horizon of 2045 and

Manifesto for Clean Growth – Clean Growth Leadership Group
What are the Clean Growth opportunities for 
Scotland of the transition to Net Zero – and how can 
we maximise them?
Clean Growth
Clean Growth is growth which works for people, 
strengthens our economy and saves our planet. It 
means increasing prosperity while reducing emissions 
and reversing biodiversity loss. It means responding to 
the climate and nature emergencies at the same time 
as delivering a Just Transition for all.
It is a concept which recognises that we need growth 
for a strong economy and a strong society, but we 
need to accelerate the decoupling of economic 
growth and emissions growth if we are to achieve 
Net Zero. It recognises that our social, economic and 
environmental prosperity – the future for people, 
economy and planet – are inextricably linked because 
of the existential threat of climate change. We must 
address them together.
7 Clean Growth Opportunities
Our social, economic and natural resources mean that 
Scotland can become a world leader in Clean Growth 
if we all work together to maximise the 7 Clean 
Growth opportunities identified in this report.
Each chapter sets out what must be done with 
recommendations for government, business and 
industry, academia and education, regulators, 
investors, communities and citizens.
Together, they represent our manifesto for Clean 
Growth:
1. Industry – Transform Industry
Establish world-leading circular and bio economies in 
Scotland to transform and decarbonise industry to 
boost innovation, protect jobs and create green jobs in 
the Net Zero economy
2. Energy – Clean Energy Innovation World Leader
Build on our existing world-class energy expertise to 
maximise renewable energy generation and flexible 
storage, pioneer CCUS and build a hydrogen economy 
to create green jobs, strengthen domestic supply 
chains and lead in the Clean Growth technologies of 
the future
3. Connectivity – Net Zero Domestic Connectivity
Accelerate modal shift to active travel and public 
transport, invest in transport technology, innovation 
and infrastructure, transform supply chains and 
deepen digital connectivity to deliver world-leading 
Net Zero domestic connectivity by 2030
4. Place – Sustainable Communities
Lock-in local value, increase planning ambition and 
resources, accelerate retrofit, decarbonise heat 
and raise building standards to build and nurture 
sustainable, resilient and thriving communities 
5. People – Green Skills Revolution
Drive a Green Skills Revolution which builds green 
skills across society and invests in the reskilling, 
upskilling and lifelong learning of our people to prepare 
them for the green industries of the future to create 
new green jobs, boost productivity, raise wages and 
attract inward investment
What is Clean Growth?
– reduces carbon emissions/protects and restores nature/achieves Net Zero by 2045.

We all need to work together to achieve Net Zero 
by 2045, because of the complexity and scale of

any action. We should collaborate with international 
partners to achieve global Net Zero, deliver Climate 
Justice and make COP26 in Glasgow a success.
3. Integration
We need to think holistically and develop cross-
sectoral partnerships and plans, because silos will 
create unintended consequences. We should provide

ndustry is responsible for a fifth of Scotland’s 
territorial carbon emissions and will have to be largely 
decarbonised if we are to achieve Net Zero by 2045.
We need to invest in collaboration, innovation and 
technology to develop more sustainable business 
models. We need to focus on the most challenging 
sectors to decarbonise – such as construction, 
manufacturing and heavy industry – which have so far 
received less focus or support. We need to develop 
ambitious collaborations, incentives and regulations 
which will unleash circular innovation by science and 
industry.
By establishing world-leading circular and bio 
economies in Scotland, while also pioneering 
Carbon Capture, Utilisation and Storage (CCUS), we 
can transform and decarbonise industry to boost 
innovation, protect jobs and create new green jobs in 
the Net Zero economy.
Establish world-leading circular economy
A circular economy maximises value and minimises or 
eliminates waste. It replaces the linear business model 
of make-use-waste with a circular approach of make-
use-remake. It respects the finite resources of our 
planet and reduces carbon emissions by transforming 
the design, production and distribution of products 
and services. However, it also creates Clean Growth 
opportunities for business and industry to boost 
productivity, reduce costs, identify new markets and 
build competitive advantage.

80% of Scotland’s total carbon footprint comes from 
the heat and energy required to grow, make, process 
and move goods and materials. Adopting circular 
business models could reduce emissions for carbon-
intensive products like aluminium, plastics and steel by 
40% or more.1 
Circular Jobs
Circular engineers design products to enable 
parts 
and resource to be reused
Building information managers maintain data to 
track and optimise components and assets and 
minimise energy use 
Repair technicians repair appliances, machines or 
vehicles
Demand planners oversee supply and demand to 
create greater value
Process operators sort waste for sellable 
products
Agronomic advisers support healthy soils with 
organic fertiliser
Procurement professionals stimulate demand for 
secondary materials
Source: Zero Waste Scotland 
Circular economy strategies are generally ‘labour and 
skill intensive’ with the potential to create many new 
high-quality, high-skill green jobs. Nearly 1 in 10 jobs 
in Scotland already relate to the circular economy, 
particular in repair, recycling and renewables.2 The 
Aldersgate Group estimates that the UK could create 
over 200,000 new circular jobs, especially in the 
creative, construction, manufacturing and waste 
management sectors.3 
Circular strategies offer the opportunity to re-shore 
and decentralise production through a diverse 
localised network of reuse exchanges; sharing 
economies; maintenance, repair and remanufacture 
workshops; recycling facilities; and urban farms. Such 
1 www.energy-transitions.org/publications/mission-possible 
2 www.zerowastescotland.org.uk/content/future-work 
3 www.aldersgategroup.org.uk/asset/1697 
a network could reindustrialise the regions; build more 
resilient towns and cities; create more local, more 
sustainable supply chains; and create secure, local jobs.
Industry will need to develop and implement new 
design, construction and manufacturing techniques to 
minimise waste and maximise life cycles. Technologies 
such as materials traceability, automated sorting and 
enhanced recycling systems could trace, separate and 
enable the reuse of materials. New ways of working 
will need to be developed and mainstreamed across 
large and complex sectors of the economy and their 
supply chains – such as in circular construction, 
which could be revolutionised by new techniques 
like modular building and more sustainable materials 
like timber. This will require significant investment in 
innovation, learning and research to understand the 
potential for deconstruction of individual materials, 
reuse and embedding new supply chains. Regulation 
will be essential to provide clarity and a level playing 
field for business.
Core green skills in carbon literacy, resource efficiency 
and digital literacy will be in high demand in the circular 
economy, as discussed further in the ‘People’ chapter. 
Workers will need to reskill and upskill, learning and 
developing new circular ideas and techniques, as well 
as how to operate, maintain or repair new circular 
technologies and equipment. Workers will need to be 
adaptable, collaborative and innovative.
Educators and employers will need to upskill their 
workforces and nurture the next generation of 
circular designers, engineers, entrepreneurs and 
leaders. Strengthening and expanding access to 
apprenticeships, vocational training and work-based 
learning will be vital to prevent major future skills gaps 
or labour shortages and unlock the Clean Growth 
opportunities of circular innovation.
Consumers will need to be supported with the 
information and knowledge they need to make more 
sustainable choices and back circular businesses. 79% 
of UK consumers are changing preferences based on 
social responsibility, inclusiveness or environmental 
impact, while 88% want brands to help them live 
sustainably.4 Improving the labelling of products 
and services to reflect carbon footprint would raise 
consumer awareness and further shift consumer 
behaviours.
The British Retail Consortium has developed a road 
map for a ‘Net Zero retail industry’ by 2040. Large 
retailers from Aldi to Timpson have signed up to 
ambitious targets to power their businesses with 
renewable energy, move to low-carbon logistics, 
source sustainably and produce Net Zero products 
which help their customers and employees to live low-
carbon lifestyles.
IKEA has introduced a new Buy Back Initiative 
in the UK. Customers can now return items of 
furniture in exchange for vouchers up to 50% of 
original value. Items will then be reused, resold or 
recycled.
France will introduce repair, durability and sustainability 
ratings for all electronic and household appliances such 
as smartphones, televisions and washing machines by 
2024. Consumers will be empowered to make more 
informed choices based on environmental impact, 
while producers will be incentivised to reduce waste, 
extend life cycles and bring ‘planned obsolescence’ to 
an end. It will be supported by a national network of 
repair workshops in local communities.
The net costs for consumers of new circular products 
and services are likely to be minimal. Circular 
strategies can reduce costs and identify new markets. 
However, public investment and a mix of regulations 
and incentives will be required to unleash circular 
innovation by industry.5
Skills and innovation support for circular technologies 
to be developed, tested, deployed and scaled-up on 
a commercial basis can support an accelerated, just 
and smooth transition to Net Zero. It should build on 
the support announced to date, such as the Green 
Jobs Fund. Scotland’s enterprise and skills agencies 
and seven Innovation Centres, in addition to the 
Scottish Institute for Remanufacturing and National 
4 https://brc.org.uk/media/676312/climateactionroadmap_final_rgb_updated.pdf 
5 www.energy-transitions.org/publications/mission-possible 
Manufacturing Institute Scotland, are important assets 
to leverage to grow our circular economy.
Skills Development Scotland and Zero Waste Scotland 
have an essential role to play to work together with 
partners across academia, agencies and industry to 
develop and deliver circular reskilling, upskilling and 
work-based learning programmes with a particular 
focus on SMEs to transform industry and its supply 
chains.
The 15% of Scotland’s waste which is exported every 
year is a wasted Clean Growth opportunity. Much of 
this waste is exported to jurisdictions with significantly 
lower environmental and employment standards. 
Taking greater responsibility for our own emissions 
and environmental impact could reduce emissions, 
retain value in Scotland and create new green jobs 
in circular innovation and waste management. The 
Scottish Government should therefore set a national 
target to reduce the proportion of waste exported 
from Scotland and invest in strengthening domestic 
recycling capacity.
Industry should build sectoral and cross-sectoral 
partnerships to develop new supply chains for reuse 
materials or repairs, share best practice and pool and 
share resources or risks. There are opportunities to 
integrate industrial processes and supply chains to 
support mutually reinforcing, mutually supportive 
circular business models. 
Waste or by-products from one sector, such as food 
& drink or manufacturing, can be valuable resources 
for reuse in another sector, such as agriculture or 
aquaculture. Zero Waste Scotland, SEPA and the 
Innovation Centres can play an intermediary role 
to identify potential opportunities for industry 
collaboration.
Scotland’s Circular Economy Strategy (2016) aims to 
end our ‘throwaway culture’ and set targets to recycle 
70% of all waste and send no more than 5% of all 
waste to landfill by 2025. A statutory prohibition 
on biodegradable municipal waste going to landfill, 
a levy to plastic bags and a ban on cotton buds and 
microbeads have been recently introduced. A Deposit

Return Scheme will be implemented in 2022. 
Deposit Return Scheme
Scotland’s Deposit Return Scheme will go live on 
1 July 2022 to reduce litter, waste and pollution:
• 20p deposit on plastic, metal and glass drinks 
containers
• More than 17,000 return points nationwide
• Reverse vending machines in retail, hospitality, 
public buildings and communities
• 90% of containers will be recycled
The Scottish Government is currently consulting on 
banning the use of major single-use plastics such as 
containers, cutlery and straws. This welcome step 
would make Scotland one of a handful of countries 
globally to so. Canada will implement a nationwide ban 
by the end of 2021. 
Scotland could also align with the target of the 
EU Circular Economy Package 2018 that all plastic 
packaging in use should be recyclable by 2030. The 
UK Government could learn from Italy to reduce 
consumption, where plastic production will be limited 
to high-quality, highly sustainable materials and a 45 
cents per kilo plastic tax introduced from January 
2021. The UK Government will also introduce a 
Plastic Packaging Tax in 2022 to plastic packaging 
manufactured in or imported into the UK which 
contains less than 30% recycled plastic, incentivising 
businesses to transform production processes and 
supply chains.
Nevertheless, the UK and Scotland can and should go 
further to maximise the Clean Growth opportunities of 
the circular economy. Local authority reuse, recycling 
and food waste services need to be enhanced and 
expanded across the country, especially in rural areas 
where progress or provision has often lagged. 
Extended Producer Responsibility (EPR) systems 
which currently cover packaging, batteries, electronics 
and vehicles should be strengthened to ensure that 
they are robust and fit for purpose to deliver a Just 
Transition. New EPR systems for all manufactured 
products should be developed across the UK. Data 
and technology could be harnessed to track and 
monitor waste.
Making Polluters Pay
The aim of EPR schemes is to ensure that 
producers are financially responsible for the 
negative environmental impacts of their own 
products – and are incentivised to reduce or 
eliminate these impacts. 
This can include covering the costs of awareness 
raising, cleaning up litter, waste collection or data 
analysis to support take-back, reuse or recycling.
The four nations of the UK are working jointly 
to review existing EPR schemes and potentially 
develop new ones.
Build a bioeconomy
A significant challenge to decarbonising industry will 
be to develop alternatives to the many industrial 
processes which inevitably create carbon emissions 
and to transition away from petrochemicals as the 
key means or ingredients to manufacture chemicals, 
pharmaceuticals, fuels and everyday consumer goods 
in a global economy dependent on fossil fuels. New 
biofuels can be developed from agricultural crops, 
while waste from local value chains can be used as 
feedstock.
Key sectors like chemicals, refining and food & drink 
are among our biggest employers, largest exporters 
and highest emitters. Over 180,000 people – around 
7% of Scotland’s workforce – are employed in 
manufacturing.
The Grangemouth cluster, centred on a major 
petrochemicals plant and Scotland’s only crude oil 
refinery, is Scotland’s largest and the UK’s third largest 
industrial cluster. It is of strategic importance to 
our economy. It supports key sectors from aviation 
to haulage, in addition to thousands of direct and 
indirect jobs. It also contributes 30% of Scotland’s total 
industrial emissions.6
The emerging scientific approaches of industrial 
biotechnology offer solutions to transform these 
petrochemical-based industries and represents a Clean 
Growth opportunity for Scotland. Alongside circular 
innovation and CCUS at scale, industrial biotechnology 
can support these sectors to decarbonise, protect jobs 
and grow sustainably.7
What is Industrial Biotechnology?
Industrial biotechnology is a new, exciting and 
fast-growing sector in the circular economy which 
uses natural processes, sustainable raw materials 
and renewable feedstocks in advanced, high-value 
manufacturing to develop new low- and zero-
carbon industrial products or find new uses for 
industrial by-products.
Scotland’s burgeoning industrial biotechnology sector 
was identified as a key opportunity in the Scottish 
Government’s Inward Investment Plan, taking advantage 
of the expertise, experience and infrastructure of our 
energy, life sciences and manufacturing sectors. The 
global market for industrial biotechnology is projected 
to reach $577bn by 2026.8
The Industrial Biotechnology Innovation Centre 
(IBioIC) was established in 2014 to connect industry 
with research expertise to accelerate the development 
of new biotechnology processes and products for 
the global market. The National Plan for Industrial 
Biotechnology has set a £900m turnover target to 
be achieved in Scotland by 2025. In 2012, industrial 
biotechnology turnover in Scotland was less than 
£200 million. By 2019 it had grown by over 270% to 
£747 million.
Public investment, incentives and innovation support 
could leverage and support the Falkirk Growth Deal, 
the IBioIC and industry to transform the Grangemouth 
petrochemicals site into a biorefinery as the key

enabler, accelerator and cornerstone of a future 
bioeconomy thriving across Scotland. A pilot plant and 
demonstrator facilities in Grangemouth will test CO2 
re-use and biomass as feedstocks and develop new, 
clean biorefinery processes.
Bio-based manufacturing shares key skills sets with 
conventional petrochemical-based manufacturing 
which could help deliver a Just Transition. Existing 
firms and workers could transition new markets and 
new roles in this new sector with relative ease and 
with support from the higher and further education 
sector across the Central Belt.
Establish Scotland as a CCUS pioneer
It may not be possible, however, to decarbonise all of 
industry using circular strategies or biotechnologies. 
It is likely that the only route to zero-carbon cement 
production, for example, as well as the most effective 
route to zero-carbon steel or chemicals production, 
will be by utilising Carbon Capture, Utilisation and 
Storage (CCUS).9The Climate Change Committee (CCC) 
is clear that we will need CCUS to get to Net Zero.10 
Reducing heat and energy use through energy 
efficiency and demand management should also play a 
major role. It should reduce the cost and scale of other 
interventions which would otherwise be required 
to decarbonise and minimise the need for carbon 
offsetting only when necessary or unavoidable.
As discussed further in the ‘Energy’ chapter, CCUS 
should be part of Scotland’s Net Zero energy mix. 
The infrastructure required to decarbonise industry, 
including CCUS, should be a key priority for the 
Infrastructure Investment Plan 2021-2026. The UK 
Government and Scottish Government should work 
together to provide the necessary public investment to 
pioneer CCS in Scotland at St Fergus in the North East 
as part of an integrated Energy Strategy.
Scotland can pioneer CCUS to support the 
decarbonisation of Scottish, UK and European 
industry. The Acorn CCS project would repurpose

existing gas pipelines to put 80% of Scotland’s 
industrial emissions within reach, including 
Grangemouth. Scotland could capture and store 4 
million tonnes of CO2 every year – a third of our 
annual industrial emissions today – from the mid-
2020s.11Industries could relocate production to 
Scotland to eliminate or store their emissions and 
achieve Net Zero – or to utilise captured CO2 in new 
industrial processes. Scotland’s pioneering carbon 
storage services could be sold to other countries 
which lack similar domestic capacity.
However, there is a need to develop a commercial 
model for CCUS, as well as strengthen incentives 
and regulations which accelerate industry’s efforts to 
decarbonise, as discussed further in the ‘Energy’ and 
‘Finance’ chapters of this report.
RECOMMENDATIONS
Establish world-leading circular economy
• Educators should embed circular skills in curricula 
across primary, secondary and tertiary education
• Skills Development Scotland, Zero Waste Scotland, 
educators and employers should strengthen and 
expand access to circular reskilling, upskilling and 
work-based learning opportunities across the 
workforce with a focus on SMEs
• Scottish Government and Zero Waste Scotland 
should bring forward plans for repair, durability 
and sustainability ratings for all electronic and 
household appliances supported by a national 
repair network

partnerships which develop circular expertise, 
innovations, strategies and new supply chains for 
reuse materials and repairs with support from Zero 
Waste Scotland, SEPA and Innovation Centres
 
• UK Government and devolved administrations 
should strengthen existing EPR systems and 
develop new EPR systems for all manufactured 
products

WORLD LEADER
S
cotland has the potential to be a world leader 
in clean energy innovation, harnessing our 
geology, our economy and our people to build 
on the great progress made in the deployment 
and generation of renewable energy.
Scotland’s energy sector, its strong supply chains and 
its skilled workforce are part of the solution to climate 
change and our Clean Growth future. Their strengths 
and assets give us the opportunity to reduce emissions 
from the oil and gas basin to Net Zero, and to pioneer 
new technologies like floating offshore wind, CCUS 
and hydrogen.
By maximising renewable energy generation and 
flexible storage solutions to fully decarbonise our 
electricity system, pioneering CCUS and building a 
hydrogen economy, we can create a living lab for 
clean energy innovation in Scotland to create new 
green jobs, strengthen domestic supply chains and 
develop, test, deploy and export the Clean Growth 
technologies, jobs and expertise of the future.
Maximise renewable energy capacity
The rise of renewables has been the biggest success 
story of Scotland’s Net Zero journey so far. The power 
sector has delivered a remarkable transformation from 
a high-carbon, high-polluting industry to the lowest

emitting sector of the Scottish economy. 
Scotland’s last coal-fired power station and biggest 
single polluter at Longannet closed in 2016. 
Renewables support mechanisms have facilitated 
large onshore and offshore wind developments which 
continue to come onstream, such as the Beatrice, 
Clyde and Whitelee Wind Farms. Solar, wave, tidal and 
hydropower are a key part of Scotland’s increasingly 
sustainable and diverse energy mix. The oil and gas 
sector will also continue to play an important role and 
is committed to investing and innovating to reduce 
emissions and deliver a Net Zero oil and gas basin by 
2050.1
In the decade to 2018 power sector emissions fell 
dramatically by 85%, establishing Scotland as a world 
leader in electricity system decarbonisation. 2019 
was a record year for renewable electricity generation 
as Scotland produced 90.1% of its total electricity 
consumption from renewables. The national target of 
100% by 2020 set a strong signal of ambition and is 
now well within reach. Scotland also set a record for 
electricity exports worth £745m.2
The costs of renewable energy have also fallen 
dramatically as deployment and innovation have 
delivered productivity gains and economies of scale. 
Renewable energy now generates the ‘cheapest

electricity in history’. Returns for investors are 
increasingly competitive, strong and reliable.3 
Scotland’s energy sector is continuing to invest 
in innovation to reduce emissions and maximise 
productivity. It is leveraging mature domestic supply 
chains, including many SMEs, which have long 
supported the oil and gas industry and are now 
pivoting towards the clean energy technologies of the 
future.4
By continuing to expand our renewables capacity 
beyond the 100% target, Scotland can seize the 
Clean Growth opportunities of electrification of our 
economy and exporting clean energy to countries and 
markets around the world.
We need to maximise this potential by ramping up 
testing and deploying next generation technologies 
like wave, tidal, onshore wind and floating offshore 
wind, cementing Scotland’s reputation as a living lab 
for Clean Growth innovation in renewables.

manufactured in Scotland.
Scotland needs to take steps to build internationally 
competitive domestic supply chains for the renewable 
energy sector. Supporting it to secure a greater share 
of the £5 billion of investment which is on the horizon 
would maximise the Clean Growth opportunity 
for Scotland. Due to the location of many of these 
opportunities and developments, this could also deliver 
a Just Transition by creating high-value green jobs in 
regions with higher deprivation or unemployment.
Future seabed leasing rounds and contractual 
agreements for projects should include minimum 
requirements for local content in equipment and 
people. The Offshore Wind Sector Deal, for example, 
includes an ambitious local content aspiration of 60%, 
which government and industry will have to work 
together to deliver.5 The UK’s departure from the EU 
also potentially creates the legal and policy space to 
review the approach of the UK Government and the 
Scottish Government towards State Aid, adopting 
more pro-active industrial strategies for Clean Growth.
Higher levels of renewable energy generation and 
accelerated electrification of much of our economy will 
create new challenges for the power system. The CCC 
has recognised the need for further investment in the 
capacity, flexibly and resilience of the grid and energy 
networks to support higher levels of generation, 
storage and transport and to ensure secure and stable 
energy supply. The grid will face new challenges 
with increasingly frequent and extreme fluctuations 
in weather due to climate change, as well as large 
increases in demand due to, for example, the take-up 
of Electric Vehicles (EVs) and electric heat pumps. 
Electricity storage technologies like batteries and 
pumped storage will be essential when the wind does 
not blow or the sun does not shine.6
SSE, ScottishPower and National Grid will make 
a multi-billion investment in an ‘underwater 
super-highway’ to significantly increase the UK’s 
renewable energy capacity.
The Eastern Link is will enable enough electricity

and operation
Scotland now has 764 MW of storage available, 
including 24 MW of battery storage, but the vast 
majority from two pumped storage hydro plants, 
Drax’s Cruachan and SSE’s Foyers. Pumped storage 
technology is the dominant storage technology 
worldwide. It can offer long duration and grid level 
storage but it is also highly flexible so it can help 
enable the deployment of renewables. 
There are several potential pumped storage 
developments which can create economic 
opportunities in communities across rural Scotland. 
Almost 3.7 GW of storage projects are in planning 
or awaiting construction, including four separate 
pumped hydro projects with a combined capacity of 
2.8 GW.7 Projects such as Drax’s Cruachan 2, which 
involves the expansion of the existing pumped storage 
power station in Argyll, are recognised as ‘national 
developments’ in Scotland’s NPF3.
Current policy frameworks which do not fully 
recognise the value of storage solutions can create 
challenges for large-scale, long-term capital investment 
in these assets. UK Government support for 
establishing a suitable market mechanism to enable 
further investment in new pumped hydro storage 
projects is vital.
The UK Government and Ofgem, as well as Scotland’s 
planning authorities, will need to work together 
to accelerate, prioritise and support the delivery 
of renewable energy projects. Planning needs to 
be reformed and properly resourced to do so, as 
discussed further in the ‘Place’ chapter.
Establish Scotland as a CCUS pioneer
Oil and gas will remain a part of Scotland’s diverse 
future energy mix beyond 2045 with some products 
and services still dependent on fossil fuels. Pioneering 
CCUS will therefore be essential. CCUS at scale can 
enable sequestration of high volumes of CO2 and 
utilisation of CO2 for new products and services to 
create high value green jobs and fuel Clean Growth 
for business and industry. We cannot get to Net Zero 
without it.8 
How does CCUS work?
1. Capture – CO2 separated from other gases 
produced at large industrial facilities (e.g. gas-
fired power station, cement plant, refinery)
2. Transport – CO2 compressed and 
transported (e.g. by pipeline, ship, truck) to 
geological site
3. Storage – CO2 injected into deep 
underground rock formations, usually at 
depths of one kilometre or more
4. Utilisation – Alternatively, CO2 can be used 
as a resource to create valuable products or 
services (e.g. animal feed, chemicals, biofuels) 
Scotland is a potential world leader in CCUS because 
of our geology, our existing infrastructure and the 
experience and expertise of our workforce. Scotland 
holds 35% of European geological storage resources 
suitable for CO2. Only a handful of countries have this 
Clean Growth opportunity because of their geology. 
Scotland’s CCUS Advantage
1. Geology – Globally significant scale of 
geological storage resource in Scottish North 
Sea to satisfy much of Europe’s CO2 storage 
needs to get to Net Zero
2. Infrastructure – Scotland’s major industrial 
clusters and oil & gas sector with strong 
supply chains and legacy infrastructure to 
8 www.theccc.org.uk/publication/reducing-emissions-in-scotland-2020-progress-report-to-parliament
9 www.webstore.iea.org/world-energy-outlook-2020
 
harness and repurpose for CCUS
3. People – Skills and talent of Scotland’s oil 
and gas workforce with 50 years’ expertise 
and experience working in North Sea and on 
UK Continental Shelf
We can utilise the skills, expertise and experience of 
our oil and gas sector and its strong supply chains, 
as well as its legacy infrastructure such as wells, rigs 
and pipelines, to deploy CCUS at pace and at scale, 
accelerating our transition to Net Zero and fuelling 
Clean Growth across key sectors of the Scottish 
economy. 
Even capturing a relatively small market share would 
create significant numbers of new, high-value green 
jobs in fulfilling domestic and global demand. CO2 
from Europe’s energy-intensive industrial heartlands 
could be transported for capture and storage in 
offshore sites in the Scottish North Sea – or for 
utilisation by industry in the production of animal feed, 
chemicals and biofuels. There are only 19 CCS facilities 
in operation worldwide today, but over 4,000 CCS 
facilities will be required globally to meet the emissions 
targets in the Paris Agreement of 2015.9
Progress in the deployment of CCUS infrastructure in 
the UK has, nevertheless, been slowed by two major 
barriers: the capital intensity of CCUS projects and the 
lack of a commercial model.
Government therefore has an essential and urgent role 
to play in the future of CCUS through both regulation 
and investment. Regulation can create new markets 
and simulate innovation. Public investment can provide 
policy certainty and market confidence, support 
economies of scale and reduce risks to unlock private 
investment in CCUS, as well as send signals to enable 
the domestic supply chain to pivot towards new 
opportunities.
Developing a viable business model will be important 
for the long-term sustainability and effectiveness of 
CCUS infrastructure. The UK Government committed 
in August 2020 to develop a business model within

Hydrogen has several major uses which can be 
deployed to decarbonise key sectors and fuel Clean 
Growth. It can be utilised as an alternative to batteries 
for zero-carbon connectivity, particularly for larger 
vehicles in public transport or haulage such as buses, 
trucks, lorries and even ships. It can be utilised in 
heavy industry in the production of chemicals, iron or 
steel as a replacement for fossil fuels.
Hydrogen could also be utilised to potentially 
decarbonise all or parts of the gas network, with new 
zero-carbon hydrogen boilers replacing high-carbon 
gas boilers to heat our homes, businesses, hospitals 
and schools. Some models are already on sale and 
some scoping projects are underway.
However, there are significant technical and regulatory 
barriers to its use for domestic and non-domestic 
heat which need to be overcome. Existing regulations 
restrict the use of hydrogen through the existing gas 
grid. The National Transmission System may also need 
to be updated, perhaps with the creation of dedicated 
hydrogen pipelines, to ensure safety, security and 
resilience of energy supply.12 
Levels of domestic zero- and low-carbon hydrogen 
production are very low at present. By stimulating 
demand for low-carbon hydrogen, blue hydrogen 
could be leveraged as an enabler of green hydrogen 
to accelerate progress.13  Scotland will need to vastly 
expand zero- and low-carbon hydrogen production 
to meet future demand from a mature domestic 
hydrogen economy and to capture future export 
potential.14
Scotland is home to some world-leading hydrogen 
pilots, especially along Scotland’s ‘Hydrogen Coast’ 
from Fife to the Northern Isles. SGN’s H100 Fife 
proect will create a world-first 100% hydrogen-to-
homes zero-carbon network in Levenmouth.15 Orkney

facilitating collaboration and innovation on hydrogen 
in our seven cities. Aberdeen is one of Europe’s 
pioneering hydrogen cities and the local authority

Glasgow City Council is decarbonising its vehicle 
fleet through a mix of battery and hydrogen fuel cell 
vehicles in partnership with Scottish Power who are 
providing 100% renewable electricity to support this 
transformation. 
‘The Hydrogen Islands’
Orkney Islands Council’s Hydrogen Economic 
Strategy sets out its support for green hydrogen 
production, a new hydrogen heating system for 
a local school, reskilling the local workforce and 
a growing fleet of hydrogen fuel cell vehicles for 
the local authority.
Scotland needs a national hydrogen strategy to build 
a national hydrogen economy supplied by strong 
domestic supply chains producing electrolysers, fuel 
cells, storage and other critical infrastructure. The 
Programme for Government 2020/21 announced that 
the Scottish Government will set out a new Energy 
Strategy, a Hydrogen Policy Statement and a Hydrogen 
Action Plan in 2021. The UK Government’s Hydrogen 
Strategy will be published in Spring 2021.
Together, these policy statements should set out 
how the Scottish Government nd the enterprise 
agencies will work with the UK Government, local 
authorities and the private sector to radically scale-up 
production of green and blue hydrogen; develop a 
national network of hydrogen refuelling stations where 
necessary; create incentives to back innovation; and 
build a learning ecosystem and domestic supply chain 
which can meet new levels of demand, create new 
green jobs and support workforce transition.
These new documents should be aligned with 
a refreshed UK Industrial Strategy, which should 
make building a hydrogen economy a key priority, 
backing innovation, removing regulatory barriers and 
developing risk-sharing mechanisms to create new 
markets for hydrogen. 
the next two years. Further innovation will also be 
required by the energy sector to reduce costs and 
maximise efficiency.10 
A viable business model for CCUS will require a carbon 
pricing mechanism which creates strong financial 
incentives for businesses, especially in the hardest to 
decarbonise sectors, to invest in reducing or at least 
storing industrial emissions. Whether this mechanism 
is a strengthened emissions trading system or a new 
carbon tax, or includes a carbon tax on imports, it will 
need to be applied consistently, fairly and predictably 
across the economy and aligned with Net Zero by 
2045. 
The Scottish Government should deliver an integrated 
Energy Strategy with the ambition of pioneering 
CCUS in Scotland, which signals strategic direction 
and promotes market confidence. The infrastructure 
required to decarbonise industry, including CCUS, 
should be a key priority for the Infrastructure 
Investment Plan 2021-2026.
The UK Government’s CCS Infrastructure Fund and 
10 Point Plan for a Green Industrial Revolution make 
strong commitments to CCS. A total of £1 billion of 
funding will create two CCS clusters by the mid-2020s 
and another two by 2030. The UK Government 
should bring forward the necessary funding to 
accelerate the Acorn CCS Project and establish a CCS 
Hub at St Fergus as a priority to harness Scotland’s 
CCUS advantage to in geology, infrastructure and 
people to decarbonise Scottish industry and fuel Clean 
Growth.
Acorn: Scotland’s CCS Opportunity
Acorn CCS is a CCS project based at the St 
Fergus gas terminal in the North East, where 
more than a third of the UK’s natural gas comes 
onshore. 
The first phase offers a low capital cost start by 
repurposing existing gas pipelines to transport 
CO2 to St Fergus from the Central Belt. The

11 www.theacornproject.uk/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/Hydrogen-in-Scotland-The-role-of-Acorn-Hydrogen-in-Enabling-UK-Net-Zero.pdf 
Feeder 10 pipeline puts 80% of Scotland’s 
industrial emissions within reach, including 
Grangemouth. CO2 could also be imported via 
Peterhead Port.
The project is led by Pale Blue Dot Energy with 
funding and support from industry partners 
at Chrysaor, Shell and Total. Positive public 
investment decisions in 2021 could unlock the 
project, with preparations at the storage site 
kicking off in 2022 followed by fully operational 
CCS in 2024 and CO2 imports in 2025.
Build a hydrogen economy
Hydrogen will be an integral part of the energy 
transition. Scotland has the opportunity to build on 
our early success as one of Europe’s leading early 
adopters of hydrogen technologies and solutions 
to build a world-leading hydrogen economy which 
attracts inward investment and creates new high-value 
green jobs across energy, engineering, manufacturing 
and transport. The hydrogen economy could be worth 
up to £22.5 billion to Scotland’s GDP and create up to 
28,900 jobs.11
‘Green’ Hydrogen and ‘Blue’ Hydrogen
Green hydrogen is when the electrolyser is 
powered by renewable sources like wind and 
solar power. The process is completed without 
any emissions to ensure a zero-carbon product. 
ScottishPower is developing a green hydrogen 
production facility near Glasgow at Whitelee 
Wind Farm to supply the commercial market 
within two years.
Blue hydrogen is primarily produced through 
steam methane recovery from natural gas. The 
process creates carbon emissions, but CO2 can 
be captured and used or stored through CCUS 
to create low-carbon products. Acorn Hydrogen 
is part of the Acorn CCS project at St Fergus 
which could produce hydrogen to transmit 
nationally and for export.

Manifesto for Clean Growth – Clean Growth Leadership Group
Manifesto for Clean Growth – Clean Growth Leadership Group
• UK Government should incentivise industrial-
scale energy users to adopt hydrogen-fuelled 
technologies
• UK Government, Scottish Government, local 
authorities and industry should build a national 
network of hydrogen refuelling stations
Both governments should work together to ensure 
that their new strategies and action plans are aligned. 
Both governments should recognise the importance 
of green and blue hydrogen as an essential part of 
an integrated Energy Strategy to help decarbonise 
transport, heat and industry, as well as create Clean 
Growth opportunities for Scotland.
The UK Government’s target to raise funding for 
research, science and innovation to 2.4% of UK 
GDP is therefore very positive. A large proportion 
of this funding should be targeted at Clean Growth 
R&D, such as innovation in CCUS, hydrogen or 
geothermal minewater, to maximise the Clean Growth 
opportunities of the transition to Net Zero. For 
example, the Scottish Government’s Energy Transition 
Fund should be extended and expanded to accelerate 
Clean Growth innovation across the energy sector.
It is also critical that the UK negotiates continued 
participation in the EU’s Horizon Europe research 
programme from 2021 or at least matches current 
levels of investment in research, science and 
innovation. The UK Government’s own estimates 
suggest it could have to fill a £1.5 billion funding hole. 
Between 2015 and 2017, the UK secured over €4.5 
billion from the EU for research and innovation in the 
UK, which played a vital role in accelerating Clean 
Growth R&D across all sectors of the economy.16
Geothermal Minewater Innovation
The University of Strathclyde has won UK 
Research and Innovation funding to develop a 
bid to utilise the geothermal energy trapped in 
Scotland’s disused, flooded coal mines for low-
carbon domestic heat. If successful, ‘HotScot’ 
will develop at least three minewater geothermal 
heating, cooling and energy storage sites.
Heat trapped in the disused mines of the 
Central Belt alone could meet up to 8% of 
Scotland's domestic heat demand, deliver £303 
million for GDP and create 9,800 new green 
jobs. The technology could build sites globally, 
exporting Scotland’s Clean Growth innovation 
and expertise around the world.

The Just Transition to Net Zero presents two big 
connectivity challenges for Scotland because of our 
rural, remote and island communities and our position 
on the geographical periphery of Europe. We must 
remain open for business and connected to the world, 
whilst delivering a Just Transition which leaves no one

representing 36% of emissions in 2018. In the context 
of a growing population, but despite substantial 
progress in other sectors, transport emissions remain 
largely unchanged on 1990 levels. This is largely due 
to stubbornly high levels of private car use. Road 
vehicles powered by fossil fuels represent up to 30% 
of Scotland’s total emissions.1
 
The key to delivering low- and zero-carbon transport 
connectivity is enforcing the sustainable transport 
hierarchy through both investment and regulation, 
incentives and deterrents. There has been a lack 
of action to date to systematically deprioritise and 
disincentivise petrol and diesel cars. There have been 
concerns that doing so would impact negatively on the 
economy. However, accelerating modal shift is not only 
necessary to get to Net Zero, but also supports Clean 
Growth.
Businesses, communities and individuals need to be 
encouraged and supported to change behaviours and 
make better travel choices for the planet and for their 
own health and wellbeing. We need to work with 
people and communities to break down barriers to or 
negative perceptions of active travel or using public 
transport.
Sustainable Transport Hierarchy

3. Public Transport

National Transport Strategy (2020)
Future investment, including Transport Scotland’s 
budgets and the Infrastructure Investment Plan for 
Scotland, will need to better reflect the sustainable 
transport hierarchy and the urgency of the climate and 
nature emergencies. 
There will need to be a shift in investment away from 
roads towards strengthening, expanding and upgrading 
1 www.theccc.org.uk/publication/reducing-emissions-in-scotland-2020-progress-report-to-parliament 
2 www.lowemissionzones.scot 
low- or zero-carbon rail and bus infrastructure, as 
well as zero-carbon active travel infrastructure, 
especially for short journeys in our towns and cities. 
City Region Deal and Inclusive Growth Deal projects 
and programmes will also need to be reviewed and 
reformed in the context of Net Zero.
Active Travel Cities
Brussels – Creating 40km of new bicycle lanes 
across the Belgian capital
Copenhagen – 28% of journeys in the city are 
made by bicycle
Paris – ‘Plan Vélo’ will make every street cycle-
friendly by 2024 and remove 72% of on-street 
car parking spaces
However, it is important to recognise that investment 
in roads will still be required to better maintain or 
utilise existing assets, improve road safety and help 
decarbonise transport – for example, to develop 
a future-proof network fit for purpose for public 
transport, EVs and Connected and Autonomous 
Vehicles and Mobility as a Service (MaaS). The UK 
Government should explore a road user pricing or 
similar measures to fund the investment in future low- 
and zero-carbon infrastructure which will be required.
The Scottish Government has committed to invest 
£17 million over the next three years to support 
the introduction of Low Emission Zones (LEZs) in 
Aberdeen, Edinburgh, Dundee and Glasgow. Transport 
providers are being supported to make the transition 
through the Scottish Ultra Low Emission Bus Scheme. 
However, the original timeline has been significantly 
delayed due to the COVID-19 crisis. LEZs are now not 
likely to be operational in Scotland’s four largest cities 
until 2022, nearly two years late.2 
The crisis should create new opportunities to develop 
plans for more ambitious LEZs to be implemented 
in all of Scotland’s seven cities, including Inverness, 
Perth and Stirling as public health restrictions are 
lifted and as part of efforts to support the sustainable 
recovery of our towns and cities. There will be a 
range of benefits in reduced pollution and congestion, 
improved air quality and better quality of life for town 
and city residents.
Climate Emergency Action Plan for Perth & 
Kinross
Perth & Kinross Council is developing a Climate 
Emergency Action Plan in partnership with its 
citizens, engaging and empowering communities 
across the region. An interim report has set out 
action to reduce emissions, including investment 
in active travel and EVs, and to adapt to climate 
change, including mitigating flood risks along the 
River Tay.
Our towns and cities need to build on the temporary 
active travel interventions which have facilitated social 
distancing during COVID-19. Permanent changes 
should be made to the way our places work and how 
we move around them to permanently reclaim spaces 
for people.
Scotland’s major towns and cities should develop 
Green Town Plans or Green City Plans with support 
from the Scottish Government and local partners 
which set out the concrete actions they will take 
together to reduce emissions and improve transport 
to create highly connected, highly sustainable places. 
Many of Scotland’s local authorities have set Net Zero 
targets or declared a Climate Emergency but still need 
to make difficult decisions to translate rhetoric into 
reality.
These holistic plans should deliver and coordinate 
short- and long-term actions, from creating new 
parks and revitalising vacant land to expanding low-
speed/-emission zones and active travel networks. 
They should accelerate modal shift, apply lessons from 
the 20 minute neighbourhood concept and address 
inequalities in access to green space and public 
transport for a Just Transition.
Invest in tech, innovation & infrastructure
Electrification and the hydrogen economy present 
big Clean Growth opportunities for Scotland in the 
transition to Net Zero. Investments and regulations 
in new technologies to decarbonise and enhance 
Scotland’s transport connectivity can fuel innovation 
and create new green jobs in the Net Zero economy of 
the future.
UK Government, Scottish Government , enterprise 
agencies and local authorities will play an essential role 
in growing sustainable demand and unlocking private 
investment by providing greater policy certainty 
and ambition, as well as raising the level of public 
investment and R&D in anticipatory, future-proof 
infrastructure. We need to act now to create and shift 
markets and to develop the infrastructure needed 
to support more electric cars, trains and trams or 
hydrogen lorries, vans and buses across our transport 
networks.
Scotland can be a living lab for Clean Growth 
innovation, harnessing the talent of our academics, 
entrepreneurs and scientists to develop new 
technology and expertise to get us to Net Zero and 
for export around the world. There is an opportunity 
for the Scottish Government to harness its strategic 
assets and public companies to test, develop and 
deploy zero-carbon transport innovation for land, sea 
and air.
Scotland’s Biggest: Falkirk’s EV Hub
Scotland’s largest public EV charging hub is 
located at the Falkirk Stadium just off the A9. The 
facility has capacity for 26 vehicles, generates 
nearly a third of its own electricity needs with 
solar panels and provides easy access to Helix 
Park and the Kelpies. It will form part of the 
‘Electric A9’ from Polmont to Scrabster.

World First: Aberdeen’s Hydrogen Buses
The UK’s first hydrogen production and bus 
refuelling station was opened in Aberdeen in 
2015 as part of a £19 million demonstration 
project. The Aberdeen City Council-led project 
tested the economic and environmental benefits 
of hydrogen transport and aims to drive the 
development of hydrogen technologies. The 
Granite City is now home to the world’s first fleet 
of hydrogen-powered double decker buses.
Net Zero Manufacturing in East Ayrshire
Cumnock-based manufacturer Emergency One 
has developed the world’s first fully electric fire

Innovative Dundee
Michelin-Scotland Innovation Parc is an ambitious 
joint venture between Dundee City Council, 
Scottish Enterprise and Michelin to attract and 
support firms which will transform Dundee into a 
key location for innovation in sustainable mobility 
and low-carbon energy.
Scotland already leads in testing and deploying 
electrification and hydrogen to power vehicles. The 
Scottish Government, its enterprise agencies and 
the Scottish National Investment Bank and the UK 
Infrastructure Bank must build on the great examples 
3 www.bloomberg.com/opinion/articles/2019-04-12/electric-vehicle-battery-shrinks-and-so-does-the-total-cost 
of opportunity and success to create local jobs 
and build domestic supply chains through a strong 
commitment to greater funding for innovation and 
scale-up, as well as national rollout across the public 
sector and our towns and cities.
The creation of a new national circular or scrappage 
scheme to reuse or replace thousands of petrol and 
diesel buses and taxis with low-carbon or zero-carbon 
hydrogen and EVs would support our domestic 
manufacturing base and local green jobs. So too 
would investment to decarbonise the ferries and 
planes serving Scotland’s rural, remote and island 
communities, or to electrify the public sector fleet. We 
must not outsource or offshore high-value green jobs.
Scotland will need to move faster on building a truly 
national network of EV charging points to meet likely 
future demand. It is vital that the network is in line 
with UK and international standards, supports cross-
nation interoperability and recognises the distinct 
needs of different places. For example, it may be 
especially important for residents in densely populated 
city centres or urban areas who require a car have 
access to public Ultra-Fast charging points.
Accelerated rollout of EV and Ultra-Fast charging 
points across all our urban and rural communities 
could ensure a Just Transition which leaves no one 
behind and creates a highly connected economy from 
urban to rural, North to South, East to West. The 
UK Government should maintain current grants and 
financial incentives to purchase EVs until the market 
reaches a tipping point after which EVs become more 
affordable than combustion-engine equivalents – 
which could be as soon as 2022.3 This will be critical to 
shift consumer behaviour and demand.
As road and rail electrification gathers pace, the 
type and level of demand for electricity will change 
and grow. The comprehensive take-up of EVs could 
increase electricity demand in Scotland by 25%. There 
will be a need for investment in strengthening the 
resilience of the grid and in expanding the capacity and 
flexibility of our renewable energy networks, including 
through electricity storage technologies like batteries 
and pumped storage. Scotland’s regulatory and 
planning authorities and systems need to accelerate, 
prioritise and support the delivery of such projects.
Scotland has welcome national targets which give 
positive signals to consumers, businesses and supply 
chains to prepare for changes on the way. The Scottish 
Government has committed to phase out new petrol 
and diesel cars and vans in Scotland by 2032 and to 
decarbonise Scotland’s railway by 2035. However, 
Scotland could be even more ambitious in unlocking 
Clean Growth opportunities.
The Scottish Government should set a world-leading 
national target of Net Zero domestic connectivity 
by 2030 to create new green jobs, crowd-in private 
investment and accelerate progress in decarbonising 
transport. This would include bringing forward the ban 
on fossil fuel vehicles to 2030 to match the ambition 
of the UK Government. It should also speed up plans 
to decarbonise public transport across rail and road 
by the end of the decade through mass deployment 
of electric or hydrogen trains and buses, significant 
expansion of active travel and rail networks and much 
greater anticipatory investment in the innovation 
and infrastructure required which will support this 
transformation.
The UK aviation sector is the first in the world to 
commit to Net Zero by 2050 in its roadmap for ‘flying 
without carbon’. Airlines and airport operators will 
reduce emissions by using more efficient aircraft and 
developing new low- or zero-emissions energy sources 
such as biofuels, alongside offsetting activities to 
bridge the gap.4 
Batteries are likely to form the principal energy source 
solution for decarbonising short-haul flights. Electric 
planes could be flying over Scotland as early as 
2021, with government, industry, airlines and airport 
operators already working together on new battery 
and propulsion innovations.

propulsion system into the nine-seater planes 
used on island-hopping routes connecting 
the Highlands & Islands. It hopes to bring the 
revolutionary new aircraft into service on some 
short Scottish routes in 2021 or 2022. The 
Scottish Government has committed that all 
flights in the region will be low carbon by 2040.
Aircraft manufacturers are working to resolve the 
challenges associated with decarbonising air travel 
over longer distances, including through the Jet Zero 
Council in partnership with the UK Government.
Sustainable aviation fuels also offer a low-carbon 
solution for longer-haul air transport which could 
significantly reduce emissions. Biofuels made from 
wastes like municipal refuse and forest offcuts could 
deliver carbon savings of more than 70% on kerosene. 
Developing a domestic sustainable aviation fuel 
industry could also create thousands of green jobs in 
waste management, refining and production across 
Scotland, including at key industrial sites at St Fergus 
and Grangemouth, to serve a global, growth sector of 
the future.5
The UK Government should support supply of and 
demand for sustainable aviation fuels through new 
incentives, and regulations for industry and investors, 
as committed in its 10 Point Plan for a Green 
Industrial Revolution. It could accelerate production 
and use by backing innovation projects, reducing 
costs towards the level of kerosene, mandating higher 
sustainability standards and showcasing the UK’s 
progress at COP26.
Transform supply chains
As globalisation accelerated in previous decades, 
global trade and supply chains have been a major force 
in creating a highly connected, increasingly prosperous 
global economy. It is critical for Scotland, especially as 
a country on the geographical periphery of Europe, to 
remain open for business and connected to the world.

Manifesto for Clean Growth – Clean Growth Leadership Group
Manifesto for Clean Growth – Clean Growth Leadership Group
We must not retreat from competing on the global 
stage, working with global partners or exporting 
to growing global markets. Estimates suggest that 
Scottish exports directly support more than 529,000 
jobs.6 Digital and transport connectivity globally for 
Scottish talent and businesses will remain critical.
However, the territorial emissions of developed 
countries’ like Scotland underestimates the full impact 
of our activity and consumption on our planet. For 
example, new research suggests that 20% of global 
carbon emissions are generated by the large, complex 
and sprawling global supply chains of multinational 
companies.7
Large firms have significant leverage to change 
business practices and priorities across the global 
economy with big social, economic and environmental 
co-benefits. They should take greater responsibility 
for and work more closely with their supply chains. 
They can play a positive role in reducing emissions 
by investing in energy efficiency, reducing waste and 
partnering only with Net Zero suppliers throughout 
their supply chains, aligned with rigorous review and 
enforcement. 
The 1.5C Supply Chain Leaders initiative, a coalition 
of leading global firms including BT, Ericsson, Ikea 
and Unilever, has committed to make ‘climate-related 
targets and performance’ a key supplier purchasing 
criteria to transform and decarbonise their global 
supply chains. The UK retail sector has developed 
a road map for Net Zero by 2040 which includes 
ambitious targets to decarbonise the global supply 
chains and logistics of the UK’s retail giants. 8
Scottish businesses should model this best practice 
domestically as well as globally, recognising our 
responsibilities and our Clean Growth opportunity to 
sell Scotland to the world as the home of sustainable 
business.
Business and industry will increasingly locate and 
invest where their emissions can be minimised or 
eliminated in response to climate change and pressure 
from consumers, regulators and investors. Scotland

should therefore continue to enhance its strong 
commitment to the highest standards of sustainability. 
Higher regulatory standards and stronger compliance 
will be required in many areas and can support Clean 
Growth by helping Scotland to develop competitive 
advantage and attract inward investment.
In the context of the COVID-19 crisis, some businesses 
are now exploring whether to permanently relocate 
production or how to build shorter, more localised 
supply chains to increase resilience to future disruption 
or shocks. This could represent a major departure 
from previous corporate and investor approaches. It is 
also a potentially significant opportunity for Scotland 
to attract industries to invest, develop supply chains 
or expand production here, creating new green 
jobs and revitalising some of our lost industrial and 
manufacturing capacity.
As discussed further in the ‘Finance’ chapter, Scotland 
can develop a unique and compelling offering based 
on ‘pace, place and space’. The Scottish Government 
should work with its agencies and partners to develop 
the Inward Investment Plan into a Net Zero inward 
investment proposition which positions Scotland as 
the home of sustainable business.
Deepen digital connectivity
Digital connectivity can play an essential role in getting 
to Net Zero and represents a significant opportunity to 
deliver a Just Transition and maximise Clean Growth. It 
can be harnessed to boost the productivity of workers 
and businesses by providing better, quicker access to 
new customers, digitised or automated processes and 
global talent, markets or job opportunities.
It enables citizens, educators, learners, employees 
and employers to access knowledge or education 
about climate change or green reskilling and upskilling 
courses from anywhere in the world. It strengthens 
the resilience of communities to climate disruption by 
enabling much social and commercial life to continue 
virtually or from home, as has been demonstrated 
during COVID-19.
All of Scotland’s communities and regions have a role 
to play in getting us to Net Zero and Clean Growth 
must be for everyone, everywhere. Different parts of 
Scotland face specific challenges, but also have their 
own strengths and assets. This is particularly true of 
rural Scotland, which is home to 20% of Scotland’s 
population yet accounts for 27% of the Scottish 
economy.
The OECD’s latest rural development framework 
recognised the rural context as a ‘geography of 
opportunities’. Digital connectivity is enhancing 
social, economic and environmental wellbeing in rural 
communities worldwide. It has the potential to end the 
‘penalty of distance’ historically paid by places far from 
urban centres – and to reduce transport emissions by 
lowering both the demand and the need for travel.9 
The Scottish Government has delivered progress by 
investing over £600 million in the R100 programme 
and the Scottish Broadband Voucher Scheme for 
households and businesses to ensure ‘people in every 
part of Scotland have access to superfast broadband 
by end 2021’. R100 has a welcome focus on the final 
5-6% of premises without superfast broadband or any 
future upgrade plans.10 
But progress has been frustratingly slow for many 
households and businesses, especially those suffering 
from weak connections or located in mobile ‘notspots’. 
People in the most deprived communities remain 
significantly less likely to have internet access, limiting 
their access to public services, the labour market, 
employment and education and public health advice, 
which has been especially damaging during COVID-
19.11
COVID-19 will have a long-term impact on how and 
where we live, work and play. Flexible and remote 
working patterns will be increasingly common. Digitally 
connecting every part of Scotland with 5G would 
allow businesses and people to live, work, do business 
and access the services they need anywhere. Local or 
regional working hubs with 5G connectivity could play 
a positive role in reducing the need for commuting 
or other work-related travel as well as strengthening 
9 OECD (2020) Rural Wellbeing: Geography of Opportunities

11 Scottish Household Survey 2019
communities and tackling isolation experienced in 
remote working.
Creating a more level digital playing field no 
matter where you live in Scotland, alongside new, 
ambitious and innovative place-based approaches to 
transforming our communities, will be critical for a 
Just Transition to Net Zero. It could encourage more 
people to live and work in rural communities which 
have struggled with depopulation for decades. Rural 
communities could become increasingly attractive 
places to live, work and invest if we can deepen digital 
connectivity across the country.
RECOMMENDATIONS
Accelerate modal shift to active travel and public 
transport
• Transport Scotland budgets and the Infrastructure 
Investment Plan should reflect the sustainable 
transport hierarchy
• Transport Scotland should lead a national dialogue 
with businesses, local authorities and communities 
to understand the barriers to modal shift and to 
change behaviour
• Transport Scotland should identify places as pilots 
for implementation and proof of concept for 20 
minute neighbourhoods
• UK Government and Scottish Government should 
work together to revisit the potential for a national 
model of road user pricing or similar measures to 
address congestion and fund future low- and zero-
carbon infrastructure
• Local authorities should implement Low Emission 
Zones in Scotland’s cities as public health 
restrictions are lifted
• Local authorities should develop Green Town/City

nvestment in the physical and social fabric of places 
must deliver for people, economy and planet. More 
sustainable communities are more equal, more 
resilient and more prosperous.
Placemaking enhances the social and physical 
fabric of our urban and rural communities, bringing 
together policies and interventions across buildings, 
connectivity and planning. We need places where 
people want to live, work, play, visit and invest – and 
where they can do so sustainably.
By locking in local value, reforming and resourcing 
planning, expanding retrofit, decarbonising heat and 
raising building standards, we can build and nurture 
sustainable, resilient and thriving communities as 
part of a Just Transition for everyone and every 
community.
Collaborate rather than compete to achieve Net Zero
Government, businesses, organisations, public 
agencies and local authorities across Scotland have 
set out different visions for Net Zero with different 
timescales for delivery. Meanwhile, the powers to 
achieve these targets are distributed across different 
institutions, regulators and levels of government.
Key levers are devolved to the Scottish Government 
or held by local authorities, while many other key 
levers are reserved to the UK Government. This 
creates complex interdependencies which can only 
be overcome with common purpose and coordinated 
action. Devolved and reserved policies should be 
aligned and coordinated as far as possible.
Government and local authorities will need to 
collaborate rather than compete to deliver their 
ambitions and targets, sharing or learning from 
expertise and best practice, coordinating or aligning 
investments and working together to maximise assets 
and resources.

Local authorities need to work closely to develop more 
holistic plans which take account of negative spill-over 
effects or unintended consequences beyond their 
regions. This is especially critical with neighbouring 
authorities and City Region partners. Scottish 
Enterprise, Highlands and Islands Enterprise and the 
new South of Scotland Enterprise will play a key role 
in tailoring national priorities and programmes to local 
and regional needs.
Leaders in all sectors and all places will need to take 
bold and concrete action to break down barriers to 
progress and geographical, organisational or sectoral 
silos. It will require innovation, whole systems thinking

and a ‘one Scotland’ approach. The shared focus must 
be on delivering a nature-rich futur and Scotland’s 
national target of Net Zero by 2045.
Lock-in local value
The UK is among the most imbalanced major 
economies in the world with the gap widening 
between struggling and thriving places. People in 
Scotland’s most deprived communities face lower life 
expectancy and quality of life, higher levels of pollution 
and weaker access to jobs, green spaces, nature and 
public services in their local area.1
Scotland must deliver a Just Transition to Net Zero. 
By rebalancing the UK economy to reduce regional 
inequalities, we can unleash the potential of people, 
businesses and communities and boost Clean Growth 
in places which have been left behind.
Public and private investment should be targeted in 
those places and opportunities which need it most and 
where it will deliver the biggest social, economic and 
environmental gains. Clean Growth can help us tackle 
climate change and inequality together. The proposed 
inclusion of natural infrastructure in the Infrastructure 
Investment Plan provides an opportunity to place 
natural assets, and the multiple benefits they bring, 
alongside traditional place infrastructure.
The full public spending budget in Scotland is around 
£81 billion, representing almost half of the Scottish 
economy and offering a huge opportunity to reshape 
and strengthen local economies.2 Scotland’s public 
sector, especially our local authorities and enterprise 
agencies, must harness this immense spending power 
for Clean Growth, developing new place-based, 
sustainable economic models.
Community Wealth Building is one such innovative 
approach which focuses on harnessing local economic 
assets and maximising local economic opportunities to 
strengthen local economic power. It can revolutionise 
how public money is spent to transform our 
communities, deliver a Just Transition and support 
Clean Growth through better land use, shortened

supply chains and greener procurement.
North Ayrshire Council has developed the first 
Community Wealth Building Strategy in Scotland, 
learning from the highly successful ‘Preston model’. 
The strategy aims to bring together the regions local 
‘anchor institutions’ or major employers to change 
how, where and why they invest, spend or procure 
to lock-in local value, better utilise community assets, 
support Fair Work and back local ownership and more 
sustainable business models such as SMEs, employee 
ownership and cooperatives.3
North Ayrshire’s Community Wealth Building 
Strategy
1. Procurement – We will use our spend to 
actively encourage and support a growing, 
diverse and resilient local business base, and to 
support our net zero carbon ambitions.
2. Fair Work – We will encourage the creation 
of fair and meaningful jobs with progression 
opportunities to unlock the potential of our 
residents.
3. Land & Assets – We will support the 
wider regeneration of our communities by 
maximising all of our land and assets including 
through alternative uses for community and 
business benefit. 
4. Financial Power – We will invest locally and 
encourage regional and national institutions to 
invest in our communities. 
5. Plural Ownership – We will support the 
creation and sustainability of a range of 
business models including SMEs, social 
enterprise, employee ownership, cooperatives, 
municipal activity and community enterprises.
Our interim report called for other local authorities 
to learn from and embrace this new approach to help 
build a strong Green Recovery across the country. The 
Scottish Government committed in the Programme 
for Government 2020/21 to work with five further 
areas – Clackmannanshire, South of Scotland, Glasgow 
City Region, Western Isles and Tay Cities – to roll out 
Community Wealth Building approaches in each area.
Scotland’s enterprise agencies and public sector can 
continue to lead the way and encourage the private 
and third sectors to follow, developing Community 
Wealth Building approaches tailored to local needs 
and priorities. Government, public agencies, local 
authorities and others across the wider public sector 
should ensure that public money supports local and 
small businesses to secure public contracts, protects 
and creates local jobs, extends Fair Work across local 
labour markets and incentivises sustainable business 
practices.
Public procurement should be updated and reformed 
with new rules, practices and culture which, supported 
by improved workforce training and third-party 
certified information on climate impacts, looks beyond 
outdated lowest cost models of assessment to 
evaluate whole life economic and environmental costs 
and benefits. 
Significant changes will need to be made to the 
guidelines of the Treasury Green Book, which is 
currently under review, as well as the interpretation 
and enforcement of State Aid rules. Public 
procurement should be empowered to favour low-
carbon, net-zero and circular business models and to 
build more local, more sustainable supply chains which 
lock-in local value.
Increase planning ambition and resources
Scotland’s long-term spatial plan and planning policy 
framework is under review with the development of a 
new National Planning Framework, the NPF4, which 
will incorporate for the first time Scottish Planning 
Policy. NPF4 represents a decisive opportunity to 
build on the Place Principle and ensure that Scottish 
Planning Policy is fit for purpose to deliver a Just 
Transition to Net Zero and maximise Clean Growth.
Scottish Planning Policy needs to be more ambitious 
to achieve Net Zero and deliver a nature-rich future 
for every community. It should be visionary and 
plan-led to provide greater certainty and consistency 
to maximise its potential as a positive tool for Clean 
Growth. NPF4 should raise development standards, 
deliver positive effects for biodiversity and align with 
Scotland’s legal emissions targets and the Climate 
Change Plan update. 
NPF4 should result in developments which are more 
accessible with higher environmental, sustainability 
and biodiversity standards, including in relation to 
construction materials, energy efficiency and access to 
nature. The Scottish Government has a positive vision 
for 20 minute neighbourhoods – ‘liveable, accessible 
places... where people can meet their daily needs 
within a 20 minute walk’, such as public services, 
workplaces, education, green spaces, shops and other 
key amenities.
The Edinburgh Home Demonstrator Project 
is a collaborative partnership across public 
sector, industry and academia to develop 
a new business model for new affordable 
housing. The model is based on collaborative 
procurement, whole life cost evaluation, greater 
standardisation of components and a range of 
other transformative approaches. The model will 
then be applied to the delivery of 1,000 new 
affordable homes across the Edinburgh City 
Region built to net zero carbon standards.
Planning authorities will need to be supported to 
develop the skills and capacity required for ‘place-
based systems thinking’, building on the Place Principle 
to develop, implement and ensure compliance with 
more ambitious and more comprehensive strategies to 
achieve Net Zero and deliver a nature-rich future for 
every community. 
They will need the resources to meet demand as 
higher volumes of applications come through the 
system. Decision-making must be timely and efficient, 
with digital technologies utilised to improve the 
accessibility and quality of planning applications. 
Local authorities must also have stronger powers 
and guidelines to reject developments which are 
incompatible with Clean Growth objectives.
There will need to be a national dialogue about the 
future of our towns and cities in the aftermath of the 
pandemic. 20 minute neighbourhoods will require 
44
45
Manifesto for Clean Growth – Clean Growth Leadership Group
Manifesto for Clean Growth – Clean Growth Leadership Group
higher levels of urban density in walkable, mixed 
use neighbourhoods across our towns and cities, 
reconnecting citizens to revitalised local assets like 
the High Street and under-used, vacant or derelict 
buildings and land, bringing jobs and employers back 
to our cities or re-shaping their use to attract new jobs 
and employers. 
The Scottish Land Commission’s Vacant and 
Derelict Land Taskforce has set out the clear ‘missed 
opportunity’ which the nearly 11,000 hectares of 
vacant and derelict land in Scotland represents as 
places to build new homes, provide new business 
premises, grow local food, generate local energy, 
provide spaces for play, exercise and leisure or new 
sites of inward investment.4
New residential and commercial developments should 
not contribute to suburban sprawl which encroaches 
on greenbelt land or damages biodiversity. Planning 
must incentivise and prioritise developments which 
balance the natural and built environments, building 
in harmony with animal and plant life. Developments 
should not sustain car dependence and must be 
accessible by active travel and well served by public 
transport to ensure their long-term sustainability.
‘Building with Nature’
Building with Nature is a voluntary approach 
that enables developers to go beyond statutory 
requirements to create places that deliver for 
people and wildlife. It brings together guidance, 
training and good practice to support high 
quality green infrastructure at all stages of the 
development process including policy, planning, 
design, delivery and long-term management and 
maintenance.
Case Study – Forth Valley Hospital in Larbert
Scotland’s then largest ever NHS infrastructure 
project was completed in 2010. It achieved a 
‘national exemplar’ fusing a new state-of-the-art 
hospital with the nature on its doorstep. Patients, 
visitors and staff can access courtyards, gardens,

fields, woods and loch on a sustainably managed 
estate with benefits for physical and mental 
health and wellbeing.
The presumption in favour of sustainable development 
should be strengthened and expanded. NPF4 
should recognise a presumption in favour for Net 
Zero developments within the context of plan-
led development. Such developments should be 
conditional on and include key green infrastructure 
which are essential to achieve Net Zero – such as 
active travel routes, woodlands and ponds, onshore 
wind farms, pumped storage hydro or zero-carbon 
housing. By accelerating and integrating the approval 
and delivery of plans and projects which meet the 
highest environmental standards and deliver big 
economic benefits, Scotland can accelerate Clean 
Growth.
Accelerate retrofit and decarbonise heat
Scotland has a housing crisis. Workers have 
experienced a decade of weak or stagnant real wage 
growth, yet renters have faced soaring costs. Between 
2010 and 2019, private sector rents in Scotland 
increased by an average of 25%.5 
Many key workers in our hospitals, factories, 
schools and care homes are struggling to afford 
accommodation in our major cities or find suitable 
housing in rural areas. A generation of young people 
faces the prospect of never being able to afford 
a deposit to buy their own home as house prices 
rise relentlessly. Scotland needs more affordable, 
sustainable, quality homes of all tenures to deliver a 
Just Transition.
Residential (15%) and commercial (6%) buildings 
emissions also represented 21% of total Scottish 
emissions in 2018, according to the CCC. This 
represents an increase of 7% on 2017 levels, largely 
due to the extreme winter weather of that year. Non-
residential buildings account for 29% of Scotland’s 
buildings emissions, while residential buildings account 
for 71%. Some progress towards decarbonisation has 
been made in the last decade as buildings emissions 
are now 16% lower than they were in 2008.6 
But Scotland will have to accelerate its progress to 
reach Net Zero. Most of our buildings and places have 
not been designed with sustainability in mind. Many 
are unprepared for the increasing disruptive changes 
which are taking place to Scotland’s climate, including 
rising temperatures and more frequent extreme 
weather events such as major floods and storms. We 
will need to modernise and decarbonise millions of 
homes, offices, shops, factories, schools, hospitals and 
other private and public buildings.
The CCC notes three major challenges in 
decarbonising buildings, but each also represents a 
major economic opportunity for Clean Growth: low-
carbon heat in existing homes, energy efficiency in 
existing homes and new sustainable homes.7 
Scotland can tackle the housing crisis, respond to the 
climate emergency and support Clean Growth by 
investing in increasing the supply of new sustainable 
housing and improving existing housing stock through 
retrofit of insulation, heat pumps, district heating 
networks and renewable energy generation. The 
Scottish Government will publish its Heat in Buildings 
Strategy shortly and has committed £1.6 billion of 
investment over the lifetime of the next parliament. 
Regulation and public investment have a big role to 
play in growing demand, building confidence and 
stimulating innovation to reduce costs. Much greater 
public investment will be required to transform the 
public sector estate. Steps will need to be taken 
to incentivise consumers, homeowners, landlords 
and businesses to act by providing policy certainty, 
improving competitiveness and strengthening the link 
between sustainability and property value.
Public investment in a Just Transition should also be 
targeted at the worst housing stock in our poorest 
neighbourhoods to achieve the biggest social, 
economic and environmental impact, reducing 
emissions, fuel poverty and inequality at the same 
time. 1 in 4 households live in fuel poverty due low

8 www.gov.scot/publications/scottish-house-condition-survey-2018-key-findings 
incomes, high fuel prices and poor energy efficiency in 
low quality housing stock. 41% of homes in Scotland 
fail to meet the Scottish Housing Quality Standard, 
mostly due to a lack of effective insulation or central 
heating. Most of these homes are in the social housing 
and private rented sectors.8
80% of the buildings which will be in use in Scotland 
in 2045 have already been built. Energy efficiency 
accounts for 40% of the global carbon emissions 
reductions required to meet the goals of the Paris 
Agreement. Buildings retrofit reduces emissions 
through reduced energy consumption, better use 
of buildings and changes in behaviour by residents, 
consumers or employers.
There is a need to expand and accelerate investment 
in existing schemes such as Warmer Homes Scotland 
and Energy Efficient Scotland local authority area-
based schemes, as well as to explore new fiscal and 
regulatory opportunities to better incentivise and 
catalyse progress, especially by landlords in the private 
rented sector. Some previous interventions have failed 
to be effective with lower than anticipated take-up 
due to high level of complexity for consumers and 
landlords. Certainty over spending over multiple years 
is required for industry to invest.
Energy efficiency interventions are among the most 
cost-effective ways to reduce carbon emissions – and 
the most economically beneficial. Investment in energy 
efficiency has large multiplier effects in terms of jobs, 
productivity and growth. It creates jobs which are 
resilient to offshoring, which workers can transition 
relatively quickly with reskilling and upskilling. It 
supports large supply chains which are largely 
composed of local SMEs.
There is capacity for both the domestic energy 
efficiency and heat pump sectors to expand supply 
chains to meet significantly higher levels of demand 
and create new jobs across the Scottish economy, if 
government demonstrates long-term intent with a 
package of multi-year funding.

Raise building standards
Scotland’s new build standards are set to be legislated 
in 2021 by the Scottish Parliament. The new standards 
for residential buildings will come into force in 2024 
before the CCC’s 2025 deadline to ensure that ‘all new 
homes built’ are ‘designed for a changing climate, are 
ultra-energy efficient and use low-carbon heat.’ 
Similarly, ambitious standards for non-residential 
buildings will also be required to provide policy 
certainty to businesses, landlords and the construction 
sector to inform decision-making, unlock capital, 
accelerate renovation plans and stimulate innovation. 
They need to know how much they will have to spend 
– and that what they spend today will not be obsolete 
tomorrow. 
NHS Scotland is leading the way with a commitment 
to ensure all new buildings and major refurbishments 
to be designed to be Net Zero from this year. This best 
practice should be replicated across Scotland’s public 
sector.
A new and ambitious Net Zero Standard for 
all buildings by 2023 which meets the highest 
sustainability standards is required to future-proof 
new developments. For example, cycling storage, 
EV charging points, the use of circular or sustainable 
materials like timber and access to green space 
should be standard in new residential and commercial 
buildings on a consistent basis nationwide.
The Scottish Government has committed to increase 
the use of Scottish wood as a more sustainable 
material. Enhanced regulations to increase 
requirements for the use of timber in construction will 
be required and would significantly expand domestic 
demand to support Clean Growth in the forestry 
sector and stimulate timber-based circular economy 
product innovations for the construction sector.
RECOMMENDATIONS
Collaborate rather than compete
• Government, businesses and organisations, public 
agencies and local authorities should explore how 
to better leverage public-private partnerships, 
business-to-business collaboration and inter-
government cooperation to achieve Net Zero by 
2045
Lock-in local value
• Public sector should mobilise total public spending 
of £81 billion in Scotland for Clean Growth through 
Community Wealth Building to create local, green 
jobs, build local, resilient supply chains and back 
inclusive, sustainable business models
• UK Government should radically reform Treasury 
Green Book to better reflect whole life economic 
and environmental costs and benefits
Increase planning ambition and resources
• Scottish Government and local authorities should 
invest in skills and capacity of the planning system 
to achieve Net Zero and deliver a nature-rich future 
for every community
• National Planning Framework 4 should recognise a 
presumption in favour for Net Zero developments 
within the context of plan-led development
• National Planning Framework 4 should require 
developments to have positive effects for 
biodiversity to stimulate private investment in 
protecting and restoring nature
Accelerate retrofit and decarbonise heat
• UK Government and Scottish Government should 
increase public investment in retrofit, energy 
efficiency and low-carbon heat programmes as an 
urgent priority
• UK Government and Scottish Government should 
create new incentives and regulations to increase 
private investment in retrofit, energy efficiency and 
low-carbon heat as an urgent priority
Raise building standards
• Scottish Government should provide strategic 
ambition, regulatory certainty, support businesses 
to adapt and innovate and implement an ambitious 
Net Zero Standard for all new buildings by 2023

echnological change and climate change are 
changing the skills which citizens, consumers 
and workers will need for the future. Every 
job will be disrupted, some jobs will be 
displaced and others will be created by the Fourth 
Industrial Revolution and the transition to Net Zero. 
Government, educators and employers will need to 
support workers to adapt. Shortages of green skills are 
a major barrier to Clean Growth in Scotland. To deliver 
a Just Transition, all workers will need core green 
skills to work with new technologies, shift to more 
sustainable practices and adopt different behaviours.
By driving a Green Skills Revolution which builds 
green skills across society and invests in the reskilling, 
upskilling and lifelong learning of our people to prepare 
them for the green industries of the future, we can 
create new green jobs, boost productivity, raise wages 
and attract inward investment.
Build core green skills across society
Net Zero by 2045 will require a rapid transformation 
across all sectors of our economy and a fundamental 
shift in behaviour by individuals, households, 
communities and businesses. Sustainability will be 
everyone’s job in the Clean Growth economy. We 
will all have to think and act differently, making more 
sustainable choices to protect our environment, 
minimise our waste and reduce our emissions.
Building core green skills which everyone will need in 
a Just Transition to Net Zero across our society should 
be a national priority for government, educators and 
employers to deliver a Just Transition and empower all 
of our people with the knowledge and skills they will 
need to make more sustainable choices as informed 
citizens, consumers and workers in their homes, 
communities and workplaces. 
Core Green Skills which every citizen or worker 
will need in the transition to Net Zero:
• Carbon Literacy
• Digital
• Problem Solving & Innovation
• Resource Efficiency & Circular Economy
Key Green Skills which many workers will need in 
the transition to Net Zero:
• Carbon Accounting & Management
• Data Analysis
• Net Zero Design
• Project Management
• STEM
All schools, colleges, universities and employers 
have important roles to play, especially in developing 
Scotland’s next generation of Clean Growth 
leaders, innovators and entrepreneurs. The Climate 
Emergency Skills Action Plan being developed by Skills 
Development Scotland and due to be published before 
the end of the year will begin to set out Scotland’s 
approach and the role we can all play.
Core green skills should be embedded in curricula 
across primary, secondary and tertiary education, as 
well as professional and work-based learning. Carbon

Our world-class universities and seven Innovation 
Centres are well placed to leverage their research 
capabilities to transform teaching and learning and to 
support innovation which will achieve institutional and 
national emissions targets.
Our world-class colleges are well placed to reach 
SMEs and develop green skills in the small business 
workforce because of their extensive local and regional 
networks. The colleges sector is working in partnership 
to develop ‘Net Zero Apprenticeships’ to create new 
learning pathways and green talent pipelines.
A Net Zero University
The University of Edinburgh’s Climate Strategy 
aims to create a ‘net zero university’ by 2040 
with a ‘whole institution’ approach to climate 
change mitigation and adaptation. Its campuses 
will be ‘living laboratories for learning’ and test 
innovative solutions.
Rural Skills Hubs
The Skills and Learning Network is a partnership 
between Borders College and Dumfries and 
Galloway College to address skills gaps in 
key sectors through flexible online learning 
across the region. The four skills hubs include 
a renewable energy and engineering hub in 
Dumfries and a construction hub in Hawick.
Employers are well placed to develop peer-to-peer 
and work-based learning opportunities in partnership 
with colleges and universities which bridge the gap 
between education and work, create a green skills 
pipeline and deliver experiential learning which is 
up-to-date, relevant and authentic. Demand for 
opportunities from apprenticeships to mentoring is 
growing.
The Graduate Apprenticeships model has achieved 
early success and will need to be scaled up 
significantly in more subjects and across more sectors 
with a greater focus on core and key green skills which 
support Clean Growth. However, a more flexible 
model of delivery and a more long-term model of 
funding are required to improve access and widen 
participation for learners and support better planning 
by employers and institutions as part of a Just 
Transition.
Harness all of Scotland’s talents to get to Net Zero
We must harness all the talents of all of Scotland to 
achieve Net Zero. Everyone should be empowered to 
play their part. The green jobs of the future must be 
accessible, inclusive and welcoming for all, recognising 
the importance of equality for a Just Transition and of 
diversity for maximising innovation and productivity.
Government, educators, regulators and employers 
should focus on ensuring equal access and 
opportunities for those historically marginalised 
from or discriminated against in the labour market, 
the classroom or the workplace, including ethnic 
minorities, people from deprived communities and 
people with learning disabilities.1
Scotland must find bold ways of inspiring people to act 
for the common good and harnessing the ambition, 
passion and talent which exists across society. 
Increasing numbers of people want lives or careers 
of social or environmental purpose. 78% of UK adults 
want to play a part in reaching the UK’s net zero goal. 
57% want to work for an organisation that helps get 
us there. Young people are especially committed to 
tackling climate change and want to make a personal 
and professional contribution.2
Scotland should coordinate a ‘National Service for Net 
Zero’ programme to empower everyone to play their 
part. The programme should be voluntary, accessible 
and inclusive. It should be targeted at opportunities for 
young people but extended to the whole population. 
It could provide employment opportunities in green 
sectors of the economy or volunteering opportunities 
in local communities.
The programme could match the right people to the 
right opportunities depending on skill profile, time 
commitment and location. A mix of paid and unpaid, 
short-term and longer-term, formal and informal 
opportunities could be provided, but with alignment to 
the highest standards of Fair Work.

2 National Grid (2020) Building the net zero energy workforce
What could National Service for Net Zero look 
like? 
Key principles:
• Voluntary
• Open to All
• Fair Work
Potential opportunities:
• Volunteering – Pick litter or help environmental 
charity
• Community organising – Join local food 
cooperative
• Work-based learning – Part-time work at local 
repair café, part-time vocational training
• Short-term work – 3 months on wildlife or 
nature conservation project
• Longer-term work – 12 months in tree 
planting, peatland restoration or buildings 
retrofit with pipeline and prospects for secure 
employment
• Green Skills Passport to validate skills learned 
for employability
The programme could leverage existing opportunities 
as well as help create new opportunities across the 
public, private and third sectors businesses under the 
same banner to create a sense of momentum and 
shared national mission which could help to tackle 
labour shortages, plug skills gaps and develop green 
skills by attracting new talent into key sectors. It 
should be tailored to local needs and circumstances 
and aligned with local resources such as employability 
services or community groups.
Young people in particular could, for example, choose 
to complete a year of National Service for Net Zero 
after leaving education, or as a ‘gap year’ between 
secondary and further or higher education, to put into 
practice or further develop their green skills, explore 
a potential career in a green job and help to tackle 
climate change. It could also support others to re-
enter or transition in the labour market, such as after

redundancy, long-term unemployment or a period 
away from work. 
Individuals committed to National Service for Net Zero 
could receive a ‘Green Skills Passport’ to demonstrate 
their learning and development, as well as become 
Ambassadors for Net Zero in their households, 
workplaces and communities to pass on their 
knowledge and skills to others.
Reskill and upskill workforce for green jobs of the 
future
We are in an era of disruption for economies and 
labour markets. The public health emergency of 
COVID-19 is only the latest example of the complex, 
multifaceted and interlinked crises and challenges to 
which all societies will have to adapt.
The climate and nature emergencies and the Fourth 
Industrial Revolution will be the most significant of 
these inter-linked global mega-trends in the decades 
to come with profound long-term consequences for 
employers, educators and workers. 
Climate change and technological change will most 
likely become the dominant disrupters and drivers of 
skills demand and supply in every sector of the global 
economy, starting a new global war for ‘green talent’, 
intensifying the need to reskill or upskill the workforce 
and changing our learning ecosystem.
Automation, artificial intelligence, big data and 
digitisation are changing the way we live and work. 
Some jobs will be displaced by technology and 
regulation, which is not new. Work will not disappear, 
as some have feared, but some jobs will, as work 
continues to change. Automation will focus on tasks, 
rather than jobs, empowering workers to become 
more innovative, productive and purposeful, and to 
harness technology for Clean Growth.3
AI and robotics can be deployed to remove dirty, 
dangerous or dull tasks from jobs. Automation can 
help maximise resource efficiency and minimise waste. 
Big data analytics can assess emissions to inform the 
redesign of processes, products and services which 
3 SCDI (2020) Upskilling Scotland: The Future of Skills and the Fourth Industrial Revolution

will decarbonise businesses, sectors and communities. 
Digital connectivity and Augmented or Virtual 
Reality can help reduce unnecessary travel, as well as 
make employment or education opportunities more 
accessible, engaging and interactive for learners or 
workers in every part of Scotland.
In this industrial revolution, as in every previous one, 
inventions and innovations will disrupt the status quo 
and change the way we live and work, leading to the 
transformation of most jobs, the elimination of some 
jobs especially in declining sectors and the creation 
of many new kinds of green or ‘green collar’ jobs 4  in 
new sectors of the economy – all accelerated by the 
transition to Net Zero as climates, markets, regulations 
and policies change, as discussed in the chapter on 
Industry. 
All of these trends will have a significant impact 
on the future green skills needs of businesses and 
organisations across the Scottish economy and create 
significant challenges for the Just Transition agenda.
Impact of Transition to Net Zero on Green Skills 
Needs
1. Green Restructuring – employment density 
shifts from declining, high-emission sectors 
to growing, emissions-reducing sectors like 
retrofit or renewable energy
2. New Green Occupations – entirely new 
occupations like sustainability specialist 
or vertical farmer emerge due to new 
regulations, innovations or markets
3. ‘Greening’ Existing Jobs – skills profiles of 
existing occupations change to require more 
green skills due to new equipment, priorities 
or ways of working such as circular business 
models
Source: International Labour Organisation
Businesses, organisations and communities can 
decarbonise and grow sustainably with the right 
people with the right green skills. Scottish firms can 
compete and thrive on the global stage with access 
to the best ‘green talent’ through an open, flexible 
and welcoming immigration system. Global investors 
can be attracted to invest in or relocate production in 
Scotland if our workforce has the green skills of the 
future.
Net Zero by 2045 will require fundamental 
transformation in all aspects of our lives and across 
all sectors of the economy at a pace and on a scale 
not seen in generations. The skills we all need will 
inevitably change too. The skills profile of every job in 
every sector will be disrupted. By 2030, one third of all 
required skills will be ‘wholly new’.5 
Workers will need to be supported to continually 
refresh, update and develop their skills to adapt 
to climate and technological change. 9 out of 10 
employees will need to reskill or upskill by 2030.6 
A recent study from the London School of Economics 
suggested that 10.1% of jobs in Scotland have skills 
for which demand could grow in the transition to 
Net Zero, while 10.4% of Scottish jobs could require 
reskilling. A total of more than 2.4 million people could 
be affected.7
What are Green Jobs?
Green jobs are jobs in any sector which tackle 
climate change, build resilience to environmental 
disruption or protect and restore nature by:
• Reducing carbon emissions
• Developing zero- and low-carbon innovations
• Improving energy and material efficiency
• Minimising waste, pollution and consumption
• Restoring biodiversity and ecosystems
• Adapting to effects of climate change

Workers whose jobs could be displaced from 
declining or high-emissions sectors will need reskilling 
opportunities to transition into new jobs in growing, 
low-emissions sectors. Workers whose jobs will 
be disrupted or transformed by new regulation or 
innovation will need upskilling opportunities to work 
with new technologies or fulfil new roles.
All workers will need new green skills to shift to new, 
more sustainable business practices, techniques 
and organisational cultures. All workers will need 
new green skills and knowledge to understand 
climate change, analyse and monitor how their work 
impacts on the environment and take steps to reduce 
emissions and waste – at home, at work and in the 
community. 
Many workers will need new green skills to deploy, 
utilise and maintain new low-/zero-carbon or 
emissions-reducing technologies. Sectors like 
Agriculture, Food & Drink, Manufacturing and 
Transport will be increasingly automated and reliant 
on skilled people to design, implement, operate and 
maintain complex equipment or infrastructure which 
minimise waste and maximise energy or resource 
efficiency.
Shortages of green skills are a major barrier to Clean 
Growth in Scotland and in economies around the 
world, especially in renewable energy, construction, 
manufacturing, energy efficiency and renovation and 
resource efficiency.8
We need to invest in our people and their skills to 
prepare them for the green jobs of the future. We 
must all act now to drive a Green Skills Revolution 
which will deliver a Just Transition to Net Zero and 
maximise Clean Growth.
By building a workforce with green skills and 
knowledge, we can fuel Clean Growth – supplying 
businesses with the skills they need to decarbonise 
and grow sustainably; increasing productivity and 
efficiency by reducing waste and misuse of resources; 
creating new green jobs, especially in places which 
54

Manifesto for Clean Growth – Clean Growth Leadership Group
need it most; attracting inward investment to fund the 
transition to net zero; and positioning Scotland as the 
global home of sustainable business.
The International Labour Organisation estimates that 
the transition to Net Zero could generate up to 60 
million jobs worldwide in the next two decades. The 
UK Government has set a target of creating 2 million 
green jobs across the UK by 2050. The National Grid 
estimates that 400,000 jobs could be created across 
the UK in the energy sector alone in the years to 2050 
as we accelerate and deepen the energy transition 
to renewables. Our national mission is to maximise 
the number of these jobs which are created here in 
Scotland.
To meet the moment, and respond to the scale of 
the challenge, there is an urgent need for a paradigm 
shift in how we all think about and invest in learning, 
with a much greater commitment to lifelong learning 
and work-based learning for everyone at all stages in 
their life and career to accelerate green reskilling and 
upskilling across the workforce.
Reskilling vs. Upskilling
What is ‘reskilling’?
Learning new skills to retrain, change job or 
career or transition into a new sector
Examples
Combustion engine mechanic learns how to 
maintain EVs or hydrogen fuel cells
Redundant retail worker retrains as STEM teacher 
or insulation installer
Farmer learns how to use new equipment to 
implement more sustainable practices
What is upskilling?
Developing or enhancing existing skills to 
progress up the workforce value chain and 
increase productivity
Examples
Experienced offshore engineer builds on skills 
developed on oil rigs to work on CCUS
9 https://roadmap2035.co.uk/roadmap-2035/ 
Construction worker develops circular economy 
expertise to build with more sustainable materials
Teacher builds knowledge of sustainability to 
embed climate change in teaching
We must build a learning ecosystem which can 
deliver a Just Transition and leaves no one behind. 
We will have to move beyond our current focus on 
pre-employment and early-career stage education 
to a more holistic commitment to lifelong learning 
for everyone at all stages of their life. Our learning 
ecosystem must now and in the future have a much 
greater focus on those in work and those in mid- or 
late- career.
Many workers in sectors like Scotland’s oil and gas 
industry will need support to reskill and retrain to 
transition into new green jobs to prevent a surge in 
unemployment. The oil and gas sector workforce 
has decades of expertise and experience that will 
be essential for the energy sector and the whole of 
Scotland to harness to achieve Net Zero. It is essential 
that we do not lose or waste the STEM skills and 
knowledge of this workforce concentrated in the 
North East of Scotland. OGTC is developing a plan to 
upskill and diversify the sector’s workforce to meet its 
ambiti on of a Net Zero oil and gas basin by 2050.9 
The forthcoming Climate Emergency Skills Action Plan 
must identify how and where oil and gas workers can 
be re-deployed in CCUS, hydrogen or renewables. 
The Just Transition Commission and the Scottish 
Government should identify which other sectors, 
workforces and regions are most likely to be affected 
by the transition to Net Zero, including indirectly via 
supply chains for sectors like construction.
There is a need for higher levels of support for the 
workforce. Government and employers have a key role 
to play. Scotland underinvests in its people compared 
to the leading economies of Western Europe and 
Scandinavia, where government and employers 
prioritise human capital and pursue a high-investment, 
high-skill, high-pay and high-productivity labour market 
model.
Before the pandemic, 2 in 3 employers in Scotland did 
not have a training budget. With finances deteriorating 
and capital dwindling during the COVID-19 crisis, the 
capacity for employers to look to the future and invest 
in their people is now likely to be even lower. SMEs, 
often with limited time, capacity and resources to 
fund reskilling and upskilling opportunities for staff, are 
the backbone of the Scottish economy. Workers are 
often unable to fund their own learning independently 
or access it due to family responsibilities or a lack of 
flexibility in provision.10
Many employers are also not certain about their 
current or future green skills needs. Many are unsure 
about what Net Zero might mean for them or 
their sector. We will need to develop active labour 
market interventions and a flexible, innovative and 
responsive learning ecosystem which can anticipate 
and address emerging and future green skills needs, 
especially to plug urgent or major skills gaps or labour 
shortages. The Climate Emergency Skills Action Plan 
will develop policies to tackle identified skills demands 
in key sectors like Energy, Construction, Transport, 
Manufacturing and Agriculture.
Scotland needs a Green Skills Revolution. Everyone 
should be empowered to compete for and thrive in the 
green jobs of the future. Everyone should have access 
to the funding they need to develop new or improve 
existing green skills. Everyone should have access to 
the support they need for reskilling, upskilling and 
lifelong learning.
There is increasing demand from both learners and 
employers for learning opportunities which are 
flexible in mode of delivery, especially remote, digital 
or blended learning, as well as delivered in shorter 
or smaller segments, such as ‘unbundled’ college or 
university qualifications, to improve access and widen 
participation. These learning opportunities could be 
better tailored to the green skills needs of an employer, 
sector or individual, as well as more responsive to new 
and emerging climate trends or low- and zero-carbon 
technologies. 82% of prospective students who are 
unemployed, at risk of unemployment or want to learn 
new skills are keen to study individual modules of 
university degrees.11
10 SCDI (2020) Upskilling Scotland: The Future of Skills and the Fourth Industrial Revolution
11 www.universitiesuk.ac.uk/news/Pages/Majority-of-adult-learners-would-upskill-at-university-if-given-the-chance.aspx 
Scotland’s colleges and universities should expand and 
further develop their offer of flexible, modular and 
tailored learning opportunities underpinned by support 
and incentives from the Scottish Government and the 
Scottish Funding Council. More ‘bitesize’ reskilling and 
upskilling courses would make learning opportunities 
significantly more attractive and accessible to a wider 
section of the workforce – especially to those in mid-
career with family, caring or other responsibilities.
Everyone in Scotland should have a lifelong 
entitlement to learning. Individuals need to be 
empowered to direct their own learning, to shape their 
own place in the labour market and to control their 
own future with support from funding which they 
can access throughout their lifelong learning journey. 
There is also a need to close Scotland’s skills funding 
gap and to respond to the growing personalisation of 
curated learning.
The Scottish Government should establish a Reskilling 
and Upskilling Fund in addition to existing support. 
The Fund should be ambitions, flexible and universal. It 
should empower every Scottish adult to fund reskilling 
or upskilling opportunities at any stage of their life or 
career, learning from the successful SkillsFuture model 
in Singapore. It should help learners and workers to 
gain or develop green skills they need for the green 
jobs and green industries of the future, keeping pace 
with technological change and climate change as part 
of a Just Transition to Net Zero.
How would a Reskilling and Upskilling Fund work?
A Reskilling and Upskilling Fund would empower 
everyone in Scotland to become a lifelong 
learner. Everyone would have an equal number 
of credits which could be used to partly or wholly 
fund opportunities to reskill or upskill throughout 
their working lives.
For example:
• Early career – Bitesize upskilling courses in 
carbon literacy and digital from local college
56
57
Manifesto for Clean Growth – Clean Growth Leadership Group
Manifesto for Clean Growth – Clean Growth Leadership Group
• Mid-career – Higher education qualification to 
 
develop project management or leadership  
skills through part-time study from Scottish 
university
• Late career – Remote learning in STEM from 
global providers to reskill to keep pace with 
latest innovations or to transition into another 
sector
Align Green Recovery investment with jobs and skills 
programmes
Our interim report called on the UK Government and 
the Scottish Government to deliver a fiscal stimulus 
packages to support a Green Recovery from the 
COVID-19 crisis. We called for investment in green 
infrastructure like retrofit and energy efficiency, low- 
and zero-carbon transport, nature-based solutions and 
digital connectivity to be prioritised. 
Both governments are now accelerating or expanding 
labour-intensive programmes in active travel, domestic 
retrofit and peatland restoration, for example, among 
others, which will create new green jobs for those with 
the right green skills.
This public investment in a Green Recovery must be 
aligned with specific job creation and skills support 
programmes and harness the role of the enterprise 
and skills agencies. Meanwhile, while all job creation 
and skills support programmes should be aligned with 
Clean Growth objectives to ensure a Just Transition 
and develop a workforce with the green skills required 
for delivery and implementation.
Government and its agencies should prepare now, 
working in partnership with colleges, universities, 
training providers and employers, to ensure that we 
do not face future skills gaps or labour shortages in 
key sectors where it is clear public investment will 
quickly and significantly expand demand – from green 
engineers to insulation installers to tree planters.
Both governments are delivering new skills support 
programmes, including those targeted at young 
people such as the Kickstart Scheme and the Young 
Person’s Guarantee, which could be aligned with the 
opportunities created by Green Recovery programmes 
to develop green skills in young people and create a 
new green talent pipeline.
The Kickstart Scheme is currently designed to 
provide funding for employers to create part-time job 
placements for 16- to 24-year olds on Universal Credit 
who are at risk of long-term unemployment over six 
months. However, the scheme could be more effective 
by combining part-time work with part-time study. 
Young people could be supported to develop green 
skills both through work-based learning on site or in 
the remote or physical workplace as part of a Green 
Recovery programme and in the digital or physical 
classroom of a local college, university or other 
accredited industry training provider.
RECOMMENDATIONS
Build core green skills across society
• Educators, employers, learners and workers should 
recognise carbon literacy and digital literacy as 
essential skills for the 21st century
•  All schools, colleges, universities, training providers 
and employers should embed core green skills 
and carbon literacy across curricula, professional 
learning and work-based learning
Harness all of Scotland’s talents to get to Net Zero
• Scottish Government should coordinate a voluntary, 
inclusive and accessible National Service for Net 
Zero programme of employment and volunteering 
opportunities across the public, private and third 
sectors backed by a Green Skills Passport
Prepare workforce for green jobs of the future
• Scotland should establish a culture of and an 
entitlement to lifelong learning
• Scottish Government should create a Reskilling and 
Upskilling Fund which empowers every Scottish 
adult to fund reskilling or upskilling opportunities at 
any stage of their life or career
Align Green Recovery investment with jobs and skills 
programmes
• UK Government and Scottish Government should 
align public green infrastructure investment and 
procurement with green jobs and skills programmes
• UK Government and Scottish Government should 
align jobs and skills programmes for all workers at all 
stages with Clean Growth objectives

C
limate change represents a serious financial 
risk to the global economy and the fiscal 
costs of the transition to Net Zero will be 
immense. But so too are the opportunities 
for Clean Growth. However, the investment gap 
between what we are currently able or preparing to 
spend and what we will have to spend to decarbonise 
is significant.
We need to close the investment gap to fund the 
transition to Net Zero. Government, business and 
individuals will need to unlock higher levels of public 
and private investment. Traditional public and 
philanthropic sources of funding will be insufficient 
to the scale of the climate and nature emergencies. 
Our financial services sector will need increase 
its commitment to sustainability to increase its 
competitiveness.
By delivering a green stimulus, unlocking green 
finance and recognising climate risks, we can fund the 
transition to Net Zero, deliver co-benefits for society, 
economy and environment and establish Scotland as 
a world leader in ethical, responsible and sustainable 
investment.
The UK’s Green Finance Strategy
Scotland is one of Europe’s leading financial centres, 
with a strong and diverse sector responsible for over 
160,000 jobs from banking, insurance and FinTech to 
asset management, pensions and professional services. 
Over £800 billion of funds are managed in Scotland.1 
Scotland also boasts many significant opportunities 
1 www.sfe.org.uk/about/financial-services-in-scotland 
for investment in green technology, infrastructure and 
innovation – from renewables and hydrogen to the 
circular economy and natural capital – as highlighted 
throughout this report.
Together, these strengths mean that green finance 
represents a significant Clean Growth opportunity 
for Scotland. By harnessing the assets, expertise and 
experience of our financial services sector, as well 
as reforming the financial system which regulates 
and governs it, Scotland can establish itself as a 
world leader in ethical, responsible and sustainable 
investments which accelerate the global transition to 
Net Zero.
The UK’s first Green Finance Strategy was published in 
2019. It identified two necessary elements in the shift 
towards green finance which, alongside maximising the 
economic opportunities for a more competitive and 
more sustainable financial services sector, represent 
the strategic pillars of the UK’s approach.

Firstly, the capital shift for ‘Financing Green’ in which 
funds move away from investments which have a 
negative impact on the environment in terms of 
carbon emissions and biodiversity loss, towards those 
which align with Net Zero. 
Secondly, the culture shift for ‘Greening Finance’ in 
which climate and environmental factors are fully 
integrated into mainstream financial decision making 
across all sectors and asset classes.2
Financing Green
The fiscal costs of the transition to Net Zero 
will be immense. Achieving Net Zero will require 
unprecedented levels of public and private investment 
in low- and zero-carbon technologies and innovation. 
Billions of pounds worth of investments will need 
to be reallocated from high-polluting industries 
into new and emerging green sectors. Our public 
services, infrastructure and communities will need to 
be transformed to ensure their resilience to climate 
change. 
Estimates suggests that the total cost for the UK to 
get to Net Zero could be between £50 billion and £70 
billion per year until 2050.3 This burden will need to 
shared fairly and sustainably across our economy and 
our society to ensure a Just Transition for all. 
We will need to mobilise the enormous financial 
resources of global capital markets and pension 
funds accelerate the flow of green finance into 
Clean Growth opportunities in Scotland. There are 
indications of growing demand and substantial latent 
capital for green investments.
However, the investment gap between what 
government, business and industry and citizens and 
consumers are currently prepared to spend and what 
they will have to spend to achieve Net Zero and 
restore nature is dramatic. There is a risk that this 
will be exacerbated by the COVID-19 crisis, delaying 
progress if there is a significant long-term impact on 
the ability of much of business and industry to make

5 www.thecityuk.com/research/supporting-uk-economic-recovery-recapitalising-businesses-post-covid-19 
necessary and productive green investments.
Business investment and indebtedness have been 
negatively affected by the COVID-19 crisis. Business 
investment fell sharply by more than a quarter in 
2020, the largest fall on record.4 Meanwhile, Scottish 
businesses could face over £6 billion of unsustainable 
debt by early 2021, half of which is expected to 
burden SMEs.5
UK Government, Scottish Government and enterprise 
agencies will therefore have to lead the way by 
raising public investment, taking steps to accelerate 
and unlock private investment and developing more 
diverse and innovative approaches, such as blended 
finance where public and private investment is 
combined to share risks.
France, Germany and several other European 
countries are delivering stimulus programmes of 
around 4% of GDP, often with a strong focus on 
Clean Growth or aligned with Net Zero objectives. 
4% of Scottish GDP would represent a stimulus 
of around £6 billion. The UK Government and the 
Scottish Government would have an essential role to 
play in delivering such a stimulus for Scotland funded 
through additional affordable borrowing, especially 
with borrowing costs at record lows, as well as further 
taxation on carbon emissions.
The Programme for Government 2020/21 in September, 
the Comprehensive Spending Review and the Financial 
Services Statement contained welcome new green 
investments, policies and regulations to begin to close 
the investment gap. The Chancellor announced in 
November that the UK Government will issue its first 
Sovereign Green Bonds in 2021 to finance green 
infrastructure projects.
However, the limited borrowing powers of devolution’s 
Fiscal Framework significantly constrain the Scottish 
Government’s ability to raise levels of green 
investment at pace to meet the scale of the challenge 
of Net Zero. The Scottish Government can only 
borrow an annual total of £450 million or just 0.3% of 
GDP. There is more still to do.
The UK Government and the Scottish Government 
should work together to review and reform the Fiscal 
Framework to ensure the Scottish Government’s fiscal 
powers are fit for purpose to achieve Net Zero by 
2045. 
Government and the wider public sector can also take 
steps to leverage private investment. Scotland’s Net 
Zero targets provide clear sense of strategic direction 
and ambition for global investors. The Scottish 
National Investment Bank and the UK Infrastructure 
Bank will play an essential role in crowding-in 
private investment to tackle the climate and nature 
emergencies through creating new markets, facilitating 
match funding or reducing the capital costs and risks 
of innovation.
This report identifies several potential new spending 
commitments for public money which are urgent 
and necessary to achieve Net Zero, deliver a Just 
Transition and maximise Clean Growth in Scotland. 
The UK Government should therefore work with 
industry and the devolved administrations to agree a 
new carbon pricing mechanism for the UK to ensure 
a smooth transition from the EU Emissions Trading 
System.
Whether this mechanism is a strengthened emissions 
trading system or a new carbon tax, or includes 
a carbon border tax, it will need to be applied 
consistently, fairly and predictably across the economy 
and aligned with Net Zero by 2045. It should hold 
polluters responsible for negative environmental 
impact and create strong financial incentives for 
business and industry to accelerate and intensify 
investment and innovation in reducing emissions.
It could generate substantial new revenue from 
activities, products and services contributing to 
climate change which could be leveraged to fund 
the immense fiscal costs to taxpayers of a Just 
Transition to Net Zero. Revenue should, for example, 
be reinvested in Clean Growth innovation and 
infrastructure, nature-based solutions or climate 
adaptation measures, helping us to grow the low- and 
zero-carbon sectors of the Net Zero economy.
The UK Government will also have to explore 
alternative models for raising public investment, such 
as road user pricing or similar measures to fund the 
significant investment in future low- and zero-carbon 
infrastructure which will be required to decarbonise 
transport connectivity.
Clean Growth policies must be coherent and strategic, 
providing as much clarity and long-term certainty as 
possible around strategic direction, transition periods 
and implementation dates for policies, incentives 
and regulations as soon as possible to create market 
confidence and stimulate investment. Devolved and 
reserved policies should be aligned and coordinated as 
far as possible.
Closing the Biodiversity Financing Gap
The £1 Billion Challenge was launched by the 
Scottish Environment Protection Agency 
and the Scottish Wildlife Trust to propose 
new funding models to close the biodiversity 
financing gap. The Route Map sets out nine 
innovative opportunities to stimulate new private 
investment in Scotland’s natural assets, including:
Landscape Enterprise Networks – Partners 
work together to assess their dependence 
on local natural assets (e.g. soil in agriculture, 
water in manufacturing, woodland in forestry). 
Joint business cases for investing in the local 
landscape can stimulate businesses to re-invest 
in the natural assets on which they depend. 
Nestlé is pioneering this approach in South West 
Scotland
Net Positive for Nature – A new national 
framework could be created to ensure 
developers directly fund compensatory 
investment to balance any new pressures 
on the environment and biodiversity which 
developments create
Nature-Climate Bond – Citizens and investors 
could buy bonds to fund nature-based solutions 
with returns derived from long-term savings or 
new income generation

Manifesto for Clean Growth – Clean Growth Leadership Group
Manifesto for Clean Growth – Clean Growth Leadership Group
Business models and commercial funding mechanisms 
for some technologies and sectors, particularly 
for CCUS, hydrogen and nature restoration or 
conservation, are still to be developed to unlock 
private investment, as noted elsewhere in this report. 
Government and its enterprise agencies have a key 
role to play in developing and replicating best practice 
initiatives.
New schemes could be considered to attract 
capital from the growing number of businesses and 
organisations which are investing in the offsetting of 
their carbon emissions. New approaches to home-
grown carbon offsetting, which encourage and enable 
domestic or international firms to invest in certified 
carbon offsetting activities in Scotland, could increase 
and direct private investment in biodiversity and 
carbon storage through native tree planting or other 
projects.
Smaller Clean Growth projects will struggle to 
attract major investors unless aggregated into larger 
portfolios. For example, the level of investment 
needed to improve energy efficiency in domestic 
buildings can be substantial for individuals, yet too 
small to incentivise investors despite delivering 
otherwise attractive and reliable returns. In the retrofit 
sector, this can be achieved through Energy Service 
Companies.6 
The Scottish Government, local authorities and 
housing associations should work together to develop 
a model to build aggregated portfolios of social 
housing retrofit projects, potentially on a regional or 
city region basis, and other investment opportunities, 
which would deliver the scale necessary to unlock 
green finance.
Green Investment Portfolio
Scotland’s first Green Investment Portfolio 
promotes ten market-ready projects worth with 
over £1 billion of investment potential which are 
seeking private capital.
6 www.aldersgategroup.org.uk/asset/1697 
Projects include hydrogen innovation in 
Aberdeen, plastic recycling in Perthshire and a 
deep-water port in North Ayrshire.
The portfolio will ultimately expand with further 
projects to reach a total value of £3 billion.
Government can work with industry to support the 
development of investor-ready projects, such as 
through the Green Investment Portfolio. Decision-
making by global business and industry about where 
to locate and invest will also increasingly consider 
environmental factors as they look to locate and invest 
where emissions can be minimised or eliminated. 
Scotland can develop a unique and compelling offer 
for global industry and investors. 
Scottish Government should develop the Inward 
Investment Plan into a Net Zero proposition which can 
attract industries to invest, develop supply chains or 
expand production here. It should position Scotland 
as the home of innovative, resilient and sustainable 
business based on our competitive advantage of ‘pace, 
place and space’.
Scotland: The Home of Sustainable Business
Pace – Our world-leading Net Zero targets, our 
progress in decarbonising power and our backing 
for circular or hydrogen innovation sets out our 
ambition for Clean Growth
Place – Our great urban and rural communities 
with innovative firms, green infrastructure and 
green skills attract industries and investors here
Space – Our unique natural assets which support 
biodiversity, improve health and wellbeing and 
facilitate social distancing attracts people to live, 
work and visit here
Greening Finance
Achieving Net Zero by 2045 will require significant 
changes to how our financial system operates and how 
investment decisions are often made. Every business 
and investor will need to ensure that the current and 
future financial risks and opportunities of climate 
change and biodiversity loss are integrated into their 
financial decision-making. Industry will need to deliver 
investments and developments which deliver for 
climate and nature.
Technological and climate change will mean that high-
polluting industries will be ultimately displaced by 
new green sectors of the economy. Extreme weather 
events such as floods, droughts or storms will become 
increasingly frequent and increasingly likely to disrupt 
or damage production, operations, infrastructure and 
supply chains.
There has already been significant progress. 
Environmental, Social and Corporate Governance 
(ESG) approaches, which measure, report and 
demonstrate commitment to contributing positively to 
social and environmental challenges, are increasingly 
widespread.
What is ESG?
ESG criteria measure the wider impact of an 
organisation or investment beyond financial 
factors:
Environmental – How does it affect the planet? 
Does it tackle climate change?
Social – How does it affect people, consumers 
and communities? Does it support diversity, 
inclusion and fairness?
Governance – How is it governed and 
structured? Does it align with Fair Work?

The Task Force on Climate-related Financial 
Disclosures (TCFD) has developed a framework 
which is the new global gold standard to ‘help public 
companies and other organizations more effectively 
disclose climate-related risks and opportunities 
through their existing reporting processes’. The 
TCFD framework has been endorsed by institutions 
representing $118 trillion of assets globally and 70% 
of UK banks now classify climate change as a financial 
risk.7
The UK Government created the Green Finance 
Institute to facilitate collaboration on green finance 
between the public and private sectors. The UK 
is developing a ‘green taxonomy’ framework to 
determine which economic activities and investment 
products are environmentally sustainable. Project 
owners in Scotland’s public, private or third sectors will 
need to improve their understanding of what green 
investors are looking for to ensure proposals meet 
their needs.
High Street lenders like Barclays and Nationwide 
now offer a range of ‘Green Home Mortgages’ 
which enables purchasers of new build properties 
with the highest energy efficiency ratings to 
secure a lower mortgage rate.
The global demand and supply of ethical, responsible 
and sustainable financial products is growing 
strongly across the world. Countries which are highly 
sustainable will be increasingly attractive to investors. 
ESG investment – which excludes or prioritises certain 
products, firms or sectors based on ESG criteria or 
targets investment to solve social or environmental 
problems – rose to $30.7 trillion across major markets 
in 2018.8
New Zealand is ranked as the world’s leading country 
for ESG.9 63% of the value of assets managed by its 
financial services sector are ESG investments.10 It will 
become the first country in the world to ask its banks, 
insurers, investors and other financial institutions to

report on climate risks and strategies using the TCFD 
framework by 2023. However, the UK Government 
has committed to go further than this ‘comply or 
explain’ approach, making climate-related disclosures 
mandatory for large companies across the economy by 
2025.
This represents a significant Clean Growth opportunity 
for Scotland to establish itself as a world leader in 
ethical, responsible and sustainable investment. 
Scottish business and the financial services sector 
could match New Zealand’s ambition by accelerating 
its embrace of TCFD best practice by 2023, well 
ahead of the UK’s legal milestone of 2025. 
• Green finance skills will need to be developed 
across the sector’s workforce, embedded within the 
professional qualifications of accountants, actuaries, 
bankers, financial analysts, insurers, investment 
managers and risk managers and the focus of 
upskilling opportunities to support this shift in 
culture, behaviours and practices.
RECOMMENDATIONS
Financing Green
• UK Government and Scottish Government should 
scale-up public investment funded through 
additional affordable borrowing and taxation of 
carbon emissions to deliver a large-scale green 
stimulus
• UK Government and Scottish Government should 
review and reform the Fiscal Framework and boost 
the Scottish Government’s borrowing powers
• Scottish Government and its agencies should 
develop new and innovative models to stimulate 
private investment
• Scottish Government, local authorities and partners 
should develop a model to build aggregated 
regional or city region portfolios of investment 
opportunities from housing retrofit to nature-based 
solutions which unlock green finance
• Scottish Government should develop the Inward 
Investment Plan into a Net Zero inward investment 
proposition which positions Scotland as the home 
of sustainable business 
• UK Government and Scottish Government should 
work together to revisit the potential for a national 
model of road user pricing or similar measures to 
address congestion and fund future low- and zero-
carbon infrastructure
• UK Government should work with industry and 
devolved administrations to agree a new carbon 
pricing mechanism which aligns with Net Zero, 
fully accounts for carbon emissions and helps to 
funds Clean Growth innovation and infrastructure, 
including supporting a viable business model for 
CCUS

T
he world faces a nature emergency. Climate 
change is contributing to biodiversity 
loss and environmental degradation at an 
unprecedented rate in human history, which 
poses growing risks of severe disruption and damage 
to the global economy.
Scotland’s environment and economy are under threat 
too. Nature is fundamental to life on earth and a major 
economic asset which we must protect and restore. 
We have unique natural resources which we can 
sustainably harness for Clean Growth and to achieve 
Net Zero as part of a thriving rural economy.
By reversing biodiversity loss, transforming agriculture, 
supporting sustainable forestry, restoring our 
peatlands and growing the Blue Economy, we can 
ensure a nature-rich future for all of Scotland.
Reverse biodiversity loss
Over 1 million animal and plant species are at risk of 
extinction worldwide. Biodiversity loss is accelerating 
at a pace unseen in human history due to climate 
change as well as changing land and sea use, habitat 
destruction, hunting and resource extraction. 
Pollution, deforestation and overexploitation of nature 
are increasingly damaging its chances to survive and 
thrive.
Natural capital is a major asset for our societies and 
economies and in our fight against climate change. Its

animals, plants and systems give us the essentials for 
life, provides materials for food, medicine and shelter, 
supports the resilience of the planet and absorbs 
CO2. 1  Over half of global GDP depends on the goods 
and services provided by the natural world, such 
as air quality and food or water security, known as 
Biodiversity and Ecosystem Services.
1 in 5 countries are at risk of ecosystems collapse as 
biodiversity declines rapidly. Developing nations in 
the Global South across Africa, Asia and the Middle 
East are likely to be most severely affected. The 
UN has proposed a global target to increase nature 
conservation and protection to 30% of the world’s 
surface by 2030.2
What is Biodiversity?
‘Biodiversity is the variety of life, in all its forms. It 
has many dimensions, including the diversity and 
abundance of living organisms, the genes they 
contain, and the ecosystems in which they live.’
The Dasgupta Review (2020)
However, Scotland has its own fragile ecosystems 
which threaten future prosperity. Nearly half of 
species are in decline. 1 in 9 species are threatened 
with national extinction. 3  We are failing to manage 
our natural assets effectively and sustainably,

recognise their full value to our society and our 
economy or respect limits on their overuse.4
Natural heritage is worth an estimated £23 billion 
annually to Scotland’s GDP. It directly and indirectly 
supports hundreds of thousands of jobs in key sectors 
of the Scottish economy like agriculture, construction, 
blue economy, energy, food & drink, forestry and 
tourism & hospitality.
The strength of Scotland’s brand is built on the beauty 
and opportunity of our mountains, glens, forests, 
rivers, lochs, coasts and wildlife. It is a key factor in 
our competitive advantage as a leading destination 
for tourism and inward investment, our ability to 
attract global talent to live, work or study here and our 
strengths in the rural economy.
Protecting and restoring animal and plant biodiversity 
is critical to enable Scotland to be a Clean Growth 
world leader. It can support climate mitigation and 
adaptation through reducing the risks, severity 
or impact of floods, storms, heatwaves and other 
extreme weather events, as well as improve public 
health and wellbeing through better air and water 
quality and more equal access to nature. It can 
also create jobs in wildlife management and nature 
conservation.5
However, as discussed in the Finance chapter of this 
report, underinvestment in nature remains a significant 
issue. The complexity of natural capital can make its 
economic benefits difficult to quantify. Nature is often 
overlooked as a Clean Growth opportunity as a result. 
We need to develop new ways to understand, 
measure and value Scotland’s natural capital to 
support public and private investment and to close the 
investment gap in nature conservation and restoration, 
building on the annual Scottish Natural Capital 
Accounts and State of Nature reports.
Business and industry should deepen its efforts to 
assess and mitigate the risks of declining natural 
capital and biodiversity loss on its assets, operations

and supply chains, identifying where it can and should 
invest. New approaches will need to be underpinned 
by better data and modelling to inform leaders, 
decisionmakers and policymakers and strengthen the 
business case for biodiversity.6
Government also has a key role to play in setting 
the strategic ambition and direction which catalyses 
greater action to protect and restore nature across 
the public, private and third sectors. Scotland should 
recognise the nature emergency and the climate 
emergency as twin crises, focusing attention, priorities 
and resources to tackle both together.
Scotland should therefore have nature targets 
alongside its ambitious climate targets for Net Zero 
by 2045, as advocated by Scottish Environment LINK 
and others. 7  Public bodies should have a statutory 
duty to play their part in reversing biodiversity loss 
and to monitor and regularly report on progress. A 
refreshed Biodiversity Strategy and expertise from 
an independent advisory committee could support 
businesses, organisations and sectors to develop plans 
to implement of the new ambitious, legally binding 
targets.
‘Beyond Compliance’
The Scottish Environment Protection Agency’s 
regulatory strategy, One Planet Prosperity, goes 
‘beyond compliance’. Every Scottish business 
will comply with the law, but SEPA is working to 
ensure as many as possible go further. 
SEPA provide support to businesses who 
recognise the environmental, economic and 
social benefits of embracing voluntary ‘beyond 
compliance’ opportunities – such as developing 
sustainable business practices or innovating 
across supply chains.
A new oversight body is being established to 
take on the enforcement and scrutiny functions 
of the European Commission as the UK leaves 
the EU. The Scottish Government should ensure 
that Environmental Standards Scotland, alongside 
regulators like the Scottish Environment Protection 
Agency and agencies like NatureScot, have the 
powers, resources and independence they need to 
ensure a nature-rich future for all.
It is vital that existing and future environmental 
regulations are fairly and fully enforced. Regulatory 
strategies should be focussed on deterrence or 
prevention, rather than compensation or redress, 
of damage to nature, supporting businesses to be 
innovative and sustainable.
Transform agriculture
70% of land use in Scotland is agricultural. Agriculture 
is the second largest emitting sector and can play an 
essential role in the transition to Net Zero. It is a key 
sector of our economy, especially in rural communities, 
as the third largest employer in rural Scotland with 8% 
of the workforce. Scotland’s farmers and crofters take 
pride in producing high-value products which have a 
hard-earned global reputation for sustainability and 
quality.
However, there is much more still to do. Agricultural 
emissions will have to fall by at least 35% by 2045 for 
Scotland to achieve Net Zero, according to the CCC. 8  
Climate change is causing significant financial damage 
to the sector. The extreme weather of 2017-2018 cost 
Scottish farmers £161 million in livestock losses and 
lower crop yields. 9  Accelerating the decarbonisation 
of Scottish agriculture can create Clean Growth 
opportunities for the sector to increase sustainability 
and productivity, becoming more green and more 
competitive.
Research by WWF Scotland suggests that supporting 
farmers and crofters to learn and adopt more 
innovative, more sustainable practices – including 
reduced nitrogen fertiliser use, rotational grazing 
techniques, improved animal health and breeding, 
better management of manure, nutrients and soil,

13 www.paulsoninstitute.org/key-initiatives/financing-nature-report
organic farming and reduced waste – could reduce 
carbon emissions from agriculture by 38% or more by 
2045. 10
Agroforestry, where trees and crops are grown 
on the same land, can reduce carbon emissions, 
enhance crop yields and create new revenue streams 
related to timber. Through biotechnology, we can 
harness Scotland’s research and rural capabilities 
to decarbonise agricultural production with lower 
levels of chemical use and higher levels of crop yield 
through gene-editing, creating new opportunities 
boost Scotland’s exports and help sustainably feed the 
world’s fast-growing population.
There is appetite within the sector to be innovative, 
testing and developing new low-carbon production 
and carbon sequestration solutions. Half of Scottish 
farms businesses have already diversified their 
activities, especially in renewable energy. 11
However, the transformation of farms and crofts 
will require a fundamental change in approach and a 
significant expansion of support to shape and fund the 
transition. There will be a need for upfront investment 
in innovation, infrastructure and equipment, as well 
as long-term support for the reskilling, upskilling and 
lifelong learning of landowners and land managers and 
across the rural workforce.
Agricultural subsidies globally have tended to focus 
largely or solely on food production, leading to 
damaging practices or unintended consequences 
which have damaged nature and biodiversity. 12  The 
UK’s withdrawal from the EU presents the opportunity 
for a radical rethink of the funding which Scotland 
provides to its agriculture sector as part of a thriving 
rural economy.
A new funding scheme for Scottish agriculture will 
be implemented from 2024 to replace the Common 
Agricultural Policy. There will be a ‘stability and 
simplicity’ transition period in the interim. However, 
the Scottish Government has yet to publish its vision 
for innovative and sustainable agriculture through a 
70

Manifesto for Clean Growth – Clean Growth Leadership Group
Government 2020/21 committed significant additional 
funding to create 18,000 hectares of woodland every 
year by 2024/25 to meet the ambitions of the CCC. It 
is vital that a significant proportion of new planting is 
of native woodlands.
It will be critical to accelerate and improve existing 
grant schemes for tree planting as 90% of activity 
is delivered by the private sector. Conservation 
and expansion of Scottish woodlands should focus 
on quality, diversity in scale and native species and 
identifying appropriate locations. Access to labour 
and skills to deliver these ambitions will likely remain 
a challenge for the sector in rural areas which are 
struggling with depopulation or a shrinking working-
age population, as discussed in the ‘People’ chapter of 
this report.
Regional Land Use Partnerships, which will begin to 
be established in 2021, will create opportunities for 
better collaboration across in Scotland to maximise the 
potential of our land to help us achieve Net Zero and 
to tailor sustainable solutions to local communities.
The Scottish Government has also committed to 
increase the use of Scottish wood in construction as a 
sustainable material. Enhanced regulations to increase 
requirements for the use of timber in construction as 
an alternative to concrete or cement could significantly 
expand domestic demand to support Clean Growth in 
the forestry sector although further R&D investment 
may be required to ensure new home-grown timber 
products or timber-based products meet existing 
standards.
Peatland restoration sequesters large quantities of 
carbon and creates new green jobs. Peatlands are 
present in almost every country on earth and cover 
only 3% of the world’s surface. They contain 30% of 
the carbon stored globally on or by land.
World’s Biggest Carbon Sink
The peatlands of Flow Country in Caithness and 
Sutherland is the largest peat deposit and carbon 
repository in the world, an uninterrupted 4,000 
sq km blanket bog. The UK Government
is considering whether to request its designation 
as a UNESCO World Heritage Site, making 
the region a global showcase for peatland 
restoration.
60% of peatlands in central Scotland are degraded, 
with similar proportions in the rest of the UK and 
other countries. By leading the way on peatland 
restoration at home, Scotland can develop expertise, 
experience and innovation to export around the world 
and help other nations achieve Net Zero. The Scottish 
Government should expand its investment in peatland 
restoration and enhance regulatory protections, 
banning damaging practices such as burning or 
extraction.
Peatland ACTION
NatureScot’s Peatland ACTION Fund has helped 
landowners and land managers to restore 25,000 
hectares of damaged peatlands since 2012. In 
2020, the Scottish Government announced 
further funding of £250 million over the next 
decade.
Grow the Blue Economy
Scotland’s marine area is six times its land area. Our 
18,000km of coastline, 8% of Europe’s coast, is critical 
to our international connectivity and the strong and 
diverse sectors of our Blue Economy. 
The Blue Economy is worth nearly £14 billion and over 
84,000 jobs to the Scottish economy. It represents 
a significant Clean Growth opportunity for Scotland, 
especially in coastal and rural communities, with the 
size of the global Blue Economy expected to double by 
2030 to meet rising global demand for sustainable fish, 
marine renewable energy and other major products 
and services from our seas.
new system of farm support payments. It should do 
so as soon as possible to provide clarity and long-term 
certainty for the sector, enabling it to prepare and 
invest for the future.
NFU Scotland has called for financial stability, 
productivity measures and environmental measures 
to be the three components of future support for the 
agricultural sector. 13
Scotland’s future farm support payment system 
will need to be designed to deliver a wider range 
of positive outcomes for biodiversity and nature in 
addition to sustainable food production. It should 
incentivise and support the sector to pioneer biotech 
innovation; improve water quality; protect local wildlife 
and habitats; create farm woodlands and wetlands 
with native species; increase soil carbon storage; and 
strengthen climate mitigation and resilience. 
It should be aligned with tailored information and 
support from an expanded and strengthened network 
of rural and agricultural advisory services to help 
farmers and crofters to access funding, develop plans 
and implement changes to equipment and practices.
There should also be further support for innovation 
and investment, building on the Agriculture 
Transformation Fund. The Scottish Government 
should develop a national scrappage scheme to help 
farmers and crofters fund purchases of new low-
carbon equipment, technologies and vehicles.

The CCC has concluded it will be necessary to reduce 
consumption of the most carbon-intensive foods, 
such as beef, lamb and dairy. Consumption of beef, 
lamb and dairy should fall by at least 20% per person 
within healthy eating guidelines. 14  However, it is 
important to recognise that more sustainable domestic 
producers support local jobs, local prosperity and our 
food security by reducing our reliance on high-carbon 
imports.
Informed consumers should be supported to adopt 
more climate-friendly diets and to support Scotland’s 
local and sustainable food producers. The public 
sector can play a key role by leveraging procurement, 
as discussed in the Place chapter of this report. New 
targets should be introduced to accelerate progress.
Invest in nature-based solutions
Nature-Based Solutions
• Protect, sustainably manage or restore nature
• Solve social, economic or environmental 
problems (e.g. climate change, unequal access 
to nature)
• Deliver co-benefits for people and planet (e.g. 
health & wellbeing, pollution, biodiversity) and 
support Clean Growth (e.g. green jobs)
• Examples: native tree planting, peatland 
restoration, coastal habitat restoration
Forestry remains a key sector in rural Scotland from 
Argyll to Galloway. It contributes almost 25,000 jobs 
and £1 billion annually to the Scottish economy. It is 
a vital carbon sink for negative emissions, absorbing 
3 million tonnes of CO2 every year, which needs to 
be sustainably managed to ensure they are in good 
ecological condition and to encourage the natural 
regeneration of native woodlands. 15 
Scotland’s Forestry Strategy 2019-2020 aims to increase 
woodland cover from 18.5% to 21% and to increase 
native species to 35% of woodland cover, building 
on the progress of recent years. The Programme for

Transform agriculture
• Scottish Government should propose a new 
system of farm support payments which protects 
and restores biodiversity, support innovative and 
sustainable food production and is aligned with 
expanded and strengthened advisory services for 
farmers and crofters
• Scottish Government should develop a national 
scrappage scheme to help farmers and crofters 
fund purchases of new low-carbon equipment, 
technologies and vehicles
• Educators, regulators and industry bodies should 
help consumers adopt more climate-friendly diets 
and support local and sustainable food producers
• Local authorities and public bodies should set 
ambitious new targets to accelerate local and 
sustainable food procurement
Invest in nature-based solutions
• Scottish Government should accelerate and 
improve existing grant schemes to support 
landowners, local authorities and communities to 
meet targets for woodland creation
• Scottish Government should enhance regulations 
to increase requirements for the use of timber 
in construction and invest in the R&D to ensure 
home-grown timber products can be developed to 
meet the required standards
• Scottish Government and NatureScot should 
expand investment in peatland restoration and 
explore opportunities to export our expertise
• Scottish Government should enhance regulatory 
protections for peatlands including a ban on 
damaging practices such as burning and extraction
Grow the Blue Economy
• Scottish Government, its agencies, industry and 
academia should work together to shape and 
deliver the Blue Economy Action Plan, doubling 
the size of the sector by 2030 and positioning 
Scotland as a global leader in marine innovation and 
sustainability
• Academia and industry should develop cross-
sectoral, interdisciplinary partnerships for 
collaboration, investment and research and learning 
across the Blue Economy
• SEPA should strengthen its regulatory and 
monitoring regime, improve enforcement and raise 
industry standards.
Scotland’s Blue Economy
Aquaculture – 3rd largest farmed salmon 
producer globally, Scotland’s top food export; 
opportunities to scale-up sustainable seaweed 
production 
Fisheries & fish processing – over half of UK 
landings by value; nearly half of UK jobs
Marine biotechnology – world-leading research 
and test sites; strong SME cluster
Marine tourism – some of world’s finest sailing 
areas; strong cruise passenger growth
Ports, shipbuilding & shipping – connectivity to 
global trade routes; world-class naval ship build, 
design and support
Marine renewables – world-leading offshore 
wind, wave and tidal research, innovation and 
deployment
Oil & gas – largest oil producer; 2nd largest gas 
producer in EU
The Scottish Government has committed to develop 
a Blue Economy Action Plan. Industry and academia 
should play a critical role alongside Marine Scotland, 
Crown Estate Scotland and Scotland’s enterprise 
and skills agencies in shaping and delivering the 
Action Plan. A Blue Economy innovation network of 
communities, industry, and researchers is already being 
fostered via the MAXiMAR Science and Innovation 
Audit and the Islands Deal.
The Action Plan should look to create new jobs, 
boost productivity and double the size of the sector 
by 2030. It should be national in vision, but with 
regional differentiation and delivery. It should leverage 
Scotland’s assets and strengths in a more ambitious 
and coordinated way and position Scotland as a global 
leader in marine innovation and sustainability.
The Action Plan should be a platform to develop 
cross-sectoral, interdisciplinary partnerships for 
collaboration, investment and research and learning. 
Ultimately, it should support achieving Net Zero and 
delivering a nature-rich future by developing a joint 
action plan for decarbonisation with agreed ambitions 
17 https://digitalpublications.parliament.scot/Committees/Report/REC/2018/11/27/Salmon-farming-in-Scotland 
18 www.scottishsalmon.co.uk/betterfuture
and milestones for the sector. It should support 
interdisciplinary research projects to be developed 
into disruptive innovation where Scotland can take a 
leadership role.
Major sectors of the Blue Economy have made 
significant progress in reducing Scotland’s emissions, 
decarbonising their own operations or developing 
healthier relationships with nature. However, recent 
parliamentary inquiries have concluded that there is 
an urgent need for more effective action by business 
and regulators to improve fish health and reduce 
negative environmental impacts from aquaculture. 16  
SEPA should strengthen its regulatory and monitoring 
regime, improve enforcement and raise industry 
standards, while salmon producers must redouble their 
efforts to ensure compliance. 
The Scottish Salmon Producers’ Organisation’s new 
roadmap for the sector commits to raise animal 
welfare standards, protect the marine environment 
and achieve Net Zero by 2045. 17  The Scottish 
Aquaculture Innovation Centre will play a key role 
in unlocking more sustainable ways to sustainably 
produce high-quality, low carbon, environmentally 
friendly Scottish salmon.
RECOMMENDATIONS
Reverse biodiversity loss
• Industry should develop new approaches to assess 
the value of natural capital, strengthen the business 
case for biodiversity and invest in conservation, 
mitigation and restoration
• Industry should commit to nature-rich investments 
and developments which deliver for people, 
economy and planet
• Scottish Government should recognise the nature 
emergency and set ambitious nature targets to 
reverse biodiversity loss which are aligned with 
Scotland’s climate targets, supported by the 
expertise of an independent advisory committee 
and inform a refreshed Biodiversity Strategy
