LATE SCOPING CONSULTATION RESPONSES 
 
Consultation bodies have 28 days to respond with any comments, 
stating either the information that they consider should be included 
in the ES or that they do not have any comments. 
 
Any responses received after the deadline will not be considered 
within the scoping opinion but are forwarded to the applicant for 
consideration in accordance with the policy set out in Advice Note 
7: Environmental Impact Assessment, Screening and Scoping. 
 
The following EIA scoping consultation responses were received 
after the consultation deadline specified under legislation and 
therefore did not form part of the Secretary of State's scoping 
opinion.

Dear Alan Ridley, 
 
Infrastructure Planning (Environmental Impact 
Assessment) 
Regulation 2009 SI 2263 (as amended) (the EIA 
Regulations)
Proposed Progress Power Station (the project)
Proposal By Progress Power Limited (PPL) (the applicant) 
 
Thank you for your letter of 17 May 2013 about the above request for a scoping opinion 
under the EIA Regulations.
 
Firstly I would like to extend my sincere apologies for the delay in responding to the 
application. There has been a slight change in the roles internally and as such the 
above correspondence unfortunately was one which has slipped off our radar. 
 
I note the due date for a response is on the 14 June 2013, however, I thought its best I 
provide you with a response.
 
The Highways Agency is an executive agency of the Department of Transport (DfT).  
We are responsible for operating, maintaining and improving England’s motorway and 
all purpose trunk roads, collectively known as the Strategic Road Network (SRN), on 
behalf of the Secretary of State for Transport.  In respect of spatial planning and 
development control, we have a duty to safeguard the operation of the SRN as set out 
in DfT Circular 02/2007 “Planning and the Strategic Road Network”.  In the case of this 
proposal, our interest relates to the potential impact on the A14, which is a route of 
strategic national importance.
 
The submitted EIA Scoping Report appears to be comprehensive with regard to 
transport and accessibility and does not appear to have an immediate affect to our 
network. As such, I can confirm that the Highways Agency have no further comment at 
this stage. 
 
Yours Sincerely 
 
Aziza Jeppe
