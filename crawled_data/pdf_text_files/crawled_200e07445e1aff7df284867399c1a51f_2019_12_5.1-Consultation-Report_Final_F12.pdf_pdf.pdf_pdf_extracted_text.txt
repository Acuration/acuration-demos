Executive Summary 
1.1 
Overview 
 Millbrook Power Limited (MPL) wishes to construct, operate and maintain a gas 
fired power station (with associated gas and electrical connections) at Rookery 
South Pit, between Bedford and Milton Keynes.  
 The Project includes an underground gas pipeline connection and an 
underground electrical connection, the latter including a substation, sealing end 
compounds and a 400 kV single circuit. A full description of the Project is 
provided in Section 2.5.  
1.2 
Purpose of the Report 
 This Consultation Report and accompanying Appendices (Document Reference 
5.2) have been produced to satisfy s37(3) and s37(7) of the PA 2008. The 
purpose of the Consultation Report is to provide an account of the statutory and 
non-statutory pre-application consultation activities undertaken by MPL and 
explain how consultation responses have been taken into account in the 
development of the Project. 
1.3

1.4 
Approach 
 MPL has invested considerable time and resources during two pre-application 
consultation phases of the Project in order to encourage meaningful 
involvement by the local community, those interested in the Project and the 
Project Site, Local Authorities and other prescribed consultees. Consequently, 
the Project has developed in a consultative and iterative manner, during 
successive stages of development and consultation.  
 The Project was initiated by MPL in January 2014, following which a phase of 
consultation was undertaken.  In March 2015, it was decided by the previous 
owners of the Project to put it “on hold” primarily because of the then market 
conditions for new power generation in the UK.  However, after acquisition of 
the Project by Drax in December 2016 (further described in Section 2.4) the 
Project was publicly “re-launched” in April 2017. Consultation on the Project 
(statutory and non-statutory) has been undertaken over two phases: Phase 1 
(April 2014 – March 2015) and Phase 2 (March 2017 - October 2017).  
 The two phased approach to Consultation involved several different strands of 
pre-submission engagement (both non-statutory and statutory), which can be 
summarised as follows:  
Phase 1 consultation (April 2014 – March 2015): 
� Non-Statutory Consultation (before and after statutory consultation) 
� EIA Scoping (under the EIA Regulations 2009) 
� s47 - Local Community Consultation 
� s42 - Consultation with Prescribed Consultees (s42(1)(a) prescribed 
persons; s42(1)(b) local authorities, and s42(1)(d) land interests) 
� s48 - Statutory Publicity 
Phase 2 consultation (March 2017 - October 2017): 
� Non-Statutory Consultation (before and after statutory consultation) 
� s47 - Local Community Consultation 
� s42 - Consultation with Prescribed Consultees (s42(1)(a) prescribed 
persons; s42(1)(b) local authorities, and s42(1)(d) land interests) 
� s48 - Statutory Publicity 
 Consultation on the Project has generated significant levels of interest and 
participation from a broad spectrum of consultees. This Consultation Report 
recognises that certain members of the local community expressed concerns 
about the Project and its potential impacts. Equally, this Consultation Report 
acknowledges that the Project has received expressions of support.

 Both supporters and objectors of the Project have been able to contribute to its 
development since 2014. Significant design and Project decisions were either 
directly or indirectly influenced by the consultation undertaken. This is reflected, 
in particular, by the significant changes to the design of the Project which were 
undertaken during and following the Phase 1 consultation. 
 Figure 1.1 below summarises the key stages of the development of the Project, 
and highlights the interaction between the consultation, assessment and design 
stages.

 A basic summary of consultation activities is provided in Table 1.1 below. A 
more detailed summary is contained in Table 5.1 Summary of Consultation 
undertaken for MPL, located in Section 5 of this document.

Phase 1 Consultation (April 2014 – March 2015) 
Phase 1 non-statutory consultation (April 2014 - June 2014) (prior to Phase 
1-statutory consultation) 
 MPL decided to carry out non-statutory consultation at an early stage of the 
Project's development, and did so several months in advance of the 
commencement of the statutory consultation element of Phase 1 Consultation. 
This allowed MPL to introduce the project to the public and gain early feedback 
from other consultees. 
 As part of the non-statutory consultation MPL sought early discussions in May 
2014 with Central Bedfordshire Council (CBC) and Bedford Borough Council 
(BBC) councillors on the consultation process. This resulted in: 
� An increase in the Core Consultation Zone (the ‘CCZ’) (see Figure 6.1) from 
3 km to 5 km, and contact with more distant Parish Councils in the Outer 
Consultation Zone (the ‘OCZ’) (see Figure 6.2);  
� Identification of hard to reach groups; and

� Provision of further information at the statutory consultation exhibitions.   
 Specific concerns were raised regarding the assumption of a stack height of 60 
m as a worst case and the visual impact of pylons.  In order to give more 
certainty during statutory consultation, MPL undertook early atmospheric 
dispersion modelling to inform the stack height which showed that a range of 30 
m to 40 m for the stack height would be sufficient to produce no significant 
impacts in terms of local air quality. In addition, and in discussion with the 
relevant landowners, a preferred location for the Gas Connection was proposed 
(consultation undertaken with landowners is described in sections 6.4 of this 
Consultation Report). 
 In May 2014, a letter drop was made to approximately 10,500 local homes in 
the CCZ (shown in Figure 6.1) in advance of holding three exhibitions which 
were attended by approximately 250 people. Local area media coverage at the 
time highlighted the main aspects of the Project and the exhibitions and 
subsequently reflected the feedback received by MPL. Reporting covered 
concerns about visual impacts, the future development of Rookery South Pit 
(including the Rookery South RRF Project), and the level and extent of potential 
local environmental benefits.  
Phase 1 EIA scoping (July 2014) 
 The DCO Application must be supported by an Environmental Statement (ES) 
(Document Reference 6.1), reporting on the outputs of an Environmental Impact 
Assessment (EIA)1. During production of the ES, MPL also identified the key 
technical consultees with an interest in the Project, and, through a process 
known as EIA 'scoping', was able to agree its primary methodological 
approaches to environmental assessment with the SoS. The SoS's written 
opinion as to the information to be provided in the ES was set out in the Scoping 
Opinion, dated July 2014. Environmental survey and assessment work was 
subsequently undertaken during 2014 and early 2015. PINS was satisfied that 
the details of the EIA Scoping Report encompassed the matters identified in the 
EIA Regulations.   
Phase 1 statutory consultation (October 2014 - November 2014) 
 MPL's early non-statutory engagement helped to inform the development of the 
Phase 1 Statement of Community Consultation (Phase 1 SoCC) (Appendix 
2.D). The Phase 1 SoCC set out how MPL would consult with the local 
community under s47 of the PA 2008. Informed by non-statutory consultation, 
MPL was able to agree the content and objectives of the Phase 1 SoCC with 
CBC and BBC (Appendix 2.B). As the relevant local authorities, CBC and BBC's 
knowledge and contribution was invaluable; it enabled MPL to develop a 
                                                      
1Note: The Project falls under the EIA Regulations 2009 regime and not the Infrastructure Planning 
(Environmental Impact Assessment) Regulations 2017 (the "EIA Regulations 2017") regime. This is because a 
scoping opinion was requested from the SoS under the EIA Regulations 2009 before the commencement of the 
EIA Regulations 2017. This means that, in accordance with the transitional arrangements at Regulation 
37(2)(a)(ii) of the EIA Regulations 2017, the EIA Regulations 2009 will continue to apply to the Project.

proportionate and targeted approach to consultation, informed by detailed local 
knowledge.   
 Published in October 2014, the Phase 1 SoCC Notice (Appendix 3.U) confirmed 
where and when the SoCC could be inspected by members of the public.   
 For clarity and to avoid confusion, MPL took the approach of conducting a 
combined consultation under s42, s47 and s48 of the PA 2008. MPL's Phase 1 
statutory consultation commenced on 13th October 2014 and ended on 16th 
November 2014, a period of 35 days.  
 MPL sought to provide sufficient clarity to enable consultees to develop an 
informed view of the Project. In order to do so, MPL introduced the key elements 
of the Project, supported by significant quantities of information including a 
Preliminary Environmental Information Report (2014 PEIR) and a Non-
Technical Summary (2014 PEIR NTS). PINS received a copy of the 2014 PEIR 
and the 2014 PEIR NTS on 7th October 2014 as part of the s46 notification 
process.  
 MPL explained what decisions had been made to date, and sought feedback on 
specific Gas Connection options, whilst also inviting feedback on the 2014 PEIR 
and the Project as a whole. At this stage, there were a number options available 
for connecting into the existing 400 kV transmission network and a worst case 
scenario of two overhead line double circuits with six (6) additional towers was 
assumed for the purposes of the 2014 PEIR.    
 MPL undertook statutory consultation with prescribed consultees under s42.  
Prescribed consultees received a copy of the 2014 PEIR (on CD), 2014 PEIR 
NTS, a leaflet containing information about the Project and the consultation 
process, and a cover letter. A small number of consultees were issued the 
above information after the start of the consultation process. In some cases, this 
was the result of returned deliveries, or difficulty in obtaining proof of delivery.  
Despite this, MPL received proof of delivery for all consultees within at least 28 
days prior to the consultation deadline, in accordance with the statutory 
minimum timescale. The final receipt of the latest deliveries was 17th October 
2014 and the date at which the minimum 28 days expired was 14th November 
2014 (consultation for this Phase 1 finished on 16th November 2014). 
 MPL held four exhibitions at separate venues within the CCZ (see Figure 6.1), 
under s47. Homes and businesses within the CCZ were notified of the 
consultation period and the local exhibitions by a leaflet and local media (print, 
broadcast & social) carried reports about the Project and the statutory 
consultation period.  Local parish councils as well as CBC and BBC local 
councillors and the constituency MP were notified of the statutory period of 
consultation (including the exhibitions), as were “hard to reach groups” in the 
area.  
 The Project and exhibitions were publicised via a s48 notice published in 
national and local newspapers, and posters were displayed at various locations 
in the area surrounding around the site.  In addition, MPL issued three press 
Consultation Report 
Millbrook Power 
 
17 
 
releases to local media to publicise the period of consultation (with media 
reports subsequently published and broadcast) and arranged for articles about 
the Project and the consultation to be included in parish council newsletters and 
on their websites. 
 In response to feedback from the local community and statutory consultees 
during statutory consultation, MPL had amended its proposals to: 
� Assess additional viewpoints from the Millennium Park and Marston 
Moretaine; and 
� Not access parts of the site for construction purposes via the villages of 
Millbrook (Sandhill Close) or Kempston Hardwick (Manor Road). 
Phase 1 non-statutory consultation (November 2014 – March 2015) 
(following Phase 1 statutory consultation)  
 A number of additional non-statutory consultation activities were undertaken by 
MPL following the Phase 1 statutory consultation. 
 MPL held an outreach meeting with CBC councillors, CCZ parish councillors 
and PINS on 26th November 2014 in order to discuss the DCO Application, the 
latest update on the Project and stakeholder specific issues (BBC was invited 
to the meeting but was unable to send a representative).  At this meeting 
concerns were raised regarding the visual impact of the pylons on Ampthill Park. 
Following this meeting and consistent feedback about the pylons throughout the 
strands of the consultation process a decision to "underground" the electrical 
connection was made and this was one of the key outcomes of the consultation 
process. Following this decision there remained several options for the 
connection into the existing 400 kV network albeit with underground cables 
rather than an overhead line. 
 MPL held a meeting with the Environment Agency (EA) on 20th January 2015 in 
order to discuss the DCO Application including the latest update on the Project 
and the Environmental Permitting that will allow the project to operate. 
 MPL held further meetings with CBC, BBC and local parishes on 4th February 
2015 in order to keep them appraised of developments and timeline to 
submission as well as to update them with respect to the undergrounding of the 
electrical connection.  The local media were notified of the meeting via a press 
release. 
 MPL issued additional information to s42 parties and those s47 parties that had 
requested to be kept informed on 6th and 7th February 2015 (Appendix 4.N.i).  
 A further information update was issued to s42 parties and those s47 parties 
that had requested to be kept informed on 20th March 2015 (Appendix 4.N.ii).  
This provided further information on a modification to the Red Line Boundary 
from October 2014 in relation to the Access Road within Rookery South Pit, and 
also informs consultees about amendments to the RRF Order (relating to the 
Consultation Report 
Millbrook Power 
 
18 
 
Rookery South RRF Project) that MPL propose to make in order to ensure that 
both projects can co-exist.   
 In March 2015, it was decided by the previous owners of the Project to put it “on 
hold” primarily because of the then market conditions for new power generation 
in the UK. On 26th March MPL informed local councillors and parish councils (as 
well as other local stakeholders) that it was putting the Project on hold. However, 
after Drax’s acquisition of the Project in December 2016 the Project was publicly 
“re-launched” in April 2017. 
Phase 2 Consultation (March 2017 - October 2017) 
Phase 2 non-statutory consultation (March 2017 - May 2017) (carried out 
prior to the Phase 2 statutory consultation) 
 From March 2017, MPL undertook non-statutory consultation with a range of 
stakeholders prior to the commencement of the Phase 2 statutory consultation 
period, including:  
� Refreshing the Regulation 9 consultation list;  
� Meetings with key stakeholders including PINS, regulatory agencies, local 
authorities and CCZ parish councils; and 
� Updating the MPL website (www.millbrookpower.co.uk) to advise that further 
consultations would be taking place in 2017.  
 The focus of this non-statutory consultation was to introduce the Project to those 
who were not involved in Phase 1 consultation and update those who were 
consulted during the Phase 1 consultation on the changes to the Project to 
explain why the Project was now progressing again towards submission of a 
DCO application.  
Phase 2 EIA scoping (March 2017) 
 As outlined in the summary of the Phase 1 Consultation, the DCO Application 
must be supported by an ES (Document Reference 6.1), reporting on the 
outputs of an EIA.  
 It was agreed during discussions with PINS that the previous Scoping Opinion 
was still applicable and that a further Scoping Request would not be necessary 
prior to submission of the DCO Application. 
Phase 2 statutory consultation (May 2017 - July 2017) 
 MPL's early non-statutory engagement helped to inform the development of the 
Project's Statement of Community Consultation for Phase 2 consultation (Phase 
2 SoCC). The Phase 2 SoCC was based on the Phase 1 SoCC and set out how 
MPL would consult with the local community under s47 of the PA 2008. Informed 
by both non-statutory and statutory consultation, MPL was able to agree the 
content and objectives of the Phase 2 SoCC with CBC and BBC.  As the 
Consultation Report 
Millbrook Power 
 
19 
 
relevant local authorities, CBC and BBC's knowledge and contribution was 
invaluable; it enabled MPL to develop a proportionate and targeted approach to 
consultation, informed by detailed local knowledge.   
 Published in May 2017, the Phase 2 SoCC Notice confirmed where and when 
the Phase 2 SoCC could be inspected by members of the public.   
 For clarity and to avoid confusion, MPL took the approach of conducting a 
combined consultation under s42, s47 and s48 of the PA 2008. MPL's Phase 2 
statutory consultation commenced on 29th May 2017 and ended on 2nd July 
2017, a period of 35 days. 
 MPL sought to provide sufficient clarity to enable consultees to develop an 
informed view of the Project. In order to do so, MPL introduced the key elements 
of the Project as amended, supported by significant quantities of information 
including a preliminary environmental information report (2017 PEIR) and a non-
technical summary (2017 PEIR NTS). The 2017 PEIR contained significantly 
more information than the 2014 PEIR and reflected the changes that had been 
made to the Project as a result of the Phase 1 consultation. PINS received a 
copy of the 2017 PEIR and the 2017 PEIR NTS on 23rd May 2017 as part of the 
s46 notification process.  
 The Phase 2 consultation documentation set out what decisions had been made 
to date, and sought feedback on the 2017 PEIR and the Project as a whole. By 
this stage the options for connecting into the 400 kV National Transmission line 
had been refined by MPL to underground options only (as explained in Chapter 
5 of the ES (Document Reference 6.1)). The Electrical Connection options were 
re-named and presented during the Phase 2 consultation as Option 1 
(previously named Option 3 in the 2014 PEIR) and Option 2 (previously named 
Option 4 in the 2014 PEIR) and were consulted on and described in the 2017 
PEIR.  
 MPL undertook statutory consultation with prescribed consultees under s42.  
Prescribed consultees received a CD containing the 2017 PEIR and Project 
Overview Document and a hard copy of the 2017 PEIR NTS, Project Overview 
Document and consultation leaflet. A small number of consultees were issued 
the above information after the start of the consultation process. In some cases, 
this was the result of returned deliveries, or difficulty in obtaining proof of 
delivery. Despite this, MPL received proof of delivery for these consultees 
allowing at least 28 days to respond to the consultation, in accordance with the 
statutory minimum timescale.   
 Subsequent to the commencement of the Phase 2 statutory consultation a 
number of consultees were identified which required consulting under s42 PA 
2008. Where consultation packages were not received in time to provide 
consultees with at least 28-days to respond during the Phase 2 statutory 
consultation period (29th May – 2nd July 2017) the relevant consultees were 
given their own consultation periods as summarised in Section 8 below.  
Consultation Report 
Millbrook Power 
 
20 
 
 MPL held four exhibitions at separate venues, under s47, in accordance with 
the Phase 2 SoCC. Around 13,000 homes and businesses within the CCZ (see 
figure 8.1) were notified of the consultation period and the local exhibitions by a 
leaflet and local media (print, broadcast & social) carried reports about the 
Project and the statutory consultation period. In addition, parish council 
newsletters and parish council websites carried details of the Project, the period 
of consultation and where information about the Project could be inspected 
(local libraries and council offices). 
 The Project and exhibitions were publicised via a s48 notice published in 
national and local newspapers, and posters were displayed at various locations 
in the area surrounding the site.    
Phase 2 non-statutory consultation (July 2017 – October 2017) (carried out 
following Phase 2 statutory consultation)  
 A number of additional non-statutory consultation activities were undertaken by 
MPL following Phase 2 statutory consultation. Following the receipt of Phase 2 
statutory consultation responses MPL arranged meetings with the following 
stakeholders: the Bedford Group of Internal Drainage Boards (‘IDB’), the 
Environment Agency (‘EA’), Covanta, and the Forest of Marston Vale. Further 
non-statutory consultation was undertaken via email and phone call 
correspondence; details are presented in Section 8.6.  
Evolution of the Project in Response to Consultation Feedback 
 MPL has had regard to consultation feedback received between 2014 and 2017 
and has amended its proposals in response to feedback received from 
consultees during the phased consultation as follows: 
� Undergrounding of electrical connection resulting in no additional pylons; 
� Consultation Zones modified; CCZ expanded from 3km radius to 5km radius;  
� Air dispersion modelling to determine stack heights was brought forwards 
and undertaken in May 2014; 
� Additional viewpoints added for the LVIA;  
� Confirmation of the preferred Gas Connection route following comments 
from consultees;  
� Change the AGI location to address landowner’s concerns;  
� Reduction in stack height from 60m (at scoping stage) to 35m (in DCO 
Application);  
� Reduction in the number of turbines used to generate electricity from a 
maximum of five gas turbine generators to one thereby resulting in only one 
stack; 
Consultation Report 
Millbrook Power 
 
21 
 
� Improved access arrangements, traffic management measures and routing 
during construction; and  
� Commitment to landscape and ecology mitigation strategy.  
 During the Phase 2 consultation MPL engaged with NGET on the preferred 
choice of Electrical Connection from the MPL site to the 400kV National 
Electricity Transmission line to the south. Following these discussions, it was 
decided that Electrical Connection Option 2 is no longer suitable. This means 
that Electrical Connection Option 1, comprising one underground double circuit 
Tee-in and two Sealing End Compounds (SECs) (located on each side of the 
existing transmission line), is now the sole option proposed in respect of the 
Electrical Connection. A full description of the Electrical Connection is provided 
in Section 3.4 of the ES (Document Reference 6.1).   
Next Steps 
 MPL is grateful to all who have provided input during both phases of the pre-
application consultation process. 
 MPL is committed to continued engagement with the local community, their 
political representatives (councillors and MPs) and other key stakeholders 
following submission of the DCO Application, as well as throughout the 
construction, operation and decommissioning phases, should a DCO be made.

Introduction and Context 
2.1 
Introduction 
 Millbrook Power Limited (MPL) wishes to construct, operate and maintain a gas 
fired power station (with associated gas and electrical connections) at Rookery 
South Pit, between Bedford and Milton Keynes.  
 The Project includes an underground gas pipeline connection and an 
underground electrical connection, the latter including a substation, sealing end 
compounds and a 400 kV single circuit. A full description of the Project is 
provided in Section 2.5.  
 A full glossary of defined terms used in the Consultation Report is presented in 
the Project Glossary (Document Reference 1.4). 
2.2 
Phases of Consultation 
 The Project was initiated by MPL in January 2014. In March 2015, it was 
decided by the previous owners of the Project to put it “on hold” primarily 
because of the then market conditions for new power generation in the UK.  
However, after acquisition of the Project by Drax Group plc (Drax) in December 
2016 (further described in section 2.3 below) the Project was publicly “re-
launched” in April 2017. As a result, MPL decided to undertake a second phase 
of consultation after the Project was relaunched. This Consultation Report refers 
to the two phases of consultation as follows: 
� Phase 1 consultation (including non-statutory and statutory consultation 
from January 2014 until March 2015); and 
� Phase 2 consultation (including non-statutory and statutory consultation 
from March 2017 until submission of the DCO Application in October 2017). 
2.3 
Purpose of the Report 
 This Consultation Report has been produced to satisfy s 37(3) and s37(7) of the 
Planning Act 2008 (PA 2008) and accompanies MPL's DCO Application to the 
Secretary of State for Business, Energy and Industrial Strategy (SoS). The DCO 
Application will be submitted to PINS who will examine it before making a 
recommendation to the SoS. 
 In accordance with s37(7) of the PA 2008, this Consultation Report provides:  
� An account of the consultation, publicity, deadlines set and community 
consultation activities undertaken under s42, s46, s47 and s48 of the PA 
2008 ("statutory consultation”) is provided in section 6 for the Phase 1 
consultation and section 8 for the Phase 2 consultation;

The Applicant 
 MPL is the applicant for the Project. MPL is registered in England (Company 
Number 08920458) and is a wholly owned subsidiary of Drax Group plc (Drax), 
Company Number 05562053. 
 MPL’s registered office is at Drax Power Station, Drax, Selby, North Yorkshire, 
United Kingdom, YO8 8PH. 
 Drax is responsible for generating 7% of the UKs electricity, predominantly via 
Drax power station in Selby.  Drax is one of the UK’s largest energy producers 
and is committed to helping to reduce carbon emissions, displacing more coal 
off the system and providing additional system support to plug the gaps created 
by intermittent renewables and boost security of supply.  
 Drax acquired MPL from Watt Power Limited (Watt Power) in 2016. Stag Energy 
Development Company Ltd (Stag Energy) previously provided management 
services to Watt Power in relation to MPL. Stag Energy continues to provide 
resources to MPL through a management services agreement. Stag Energy 
was founded in 2002 and the company draws on a depth of experience within a 
team that has created and delivered over 10,000 MW of power generation and 
related infrastructure projects across the globe, of which 2,500 MW has been 
delivered in the UK. 
 MPL is committed to acting in a socially and environmentally responsible 
manner. As part of this policy, MPL has sought the views and concerns of the 
local community outside of the statutory consultation process under the PA 
2008 and has considered this feedback alongside the consultation feedback 
from statutory consultation in preparing the DCO Application. 
 For further details on MPL and Drax, please refer to the Introduction to the 
Applicant and Guide to the Application (Document Reference: 1.1). 
Consultation Report 
Millbrook Power

2.5 
The Project 
 MPL is proposing to develop a gas-fired power generation plant (and 
connections to the electricity and gas networks) on land located in Rookery 
South Pit (the Project Site), near the villages of Stewartby, Millbrook and 
Marston Moretaine in Bedfordshire.  
 The Project Site is located almost entirely within the administrative area of 
Central Bedfordshire Council (CBC), with a small proportion crossing into 
Bedford Borough Council (BBC).  
 The up to 299 MW gas fired peaking power generation plant element of the 
Project constitutes a Nationally Significant Infrastructure Project (NSIP) 
pursuant to the PA 2008 and therefore requires development consent under that 
PA 2008. The Applicant is therefore applying for a development consent order 
(DCO); this Consultation Report is provided as part of that application.  
 The Project would comprise: 
� a new Power Generation Plant in the form of an Open Cycle Gas Turbine 
(OCGT) peaking power generating station, fuelled by natural gas with a 
rated electrical output of up to 299 MW.  This is the output of the generating 
station as a whole, measured at the terminals of the generating equipment. 
The Power Generation Plant comprises: 
- generating equipment including one Gas Turbine Generator with one 
exhaust gas flue stack and Balance of Plant (together referred to as the 
‘Generating Equipment’), which are located within the ‘Generating 
Equipment Site’; 
- a new purpose built access road from Green Lane to the Generating 
Equipment Site (the ‘Access Road’ or the ‘Short Access Road’);  
- a temporary construction compound required during construction only 
(the ‘Laydown Area’); 
� a new underground gas pipeline connection, approximately 1.8 km in length 
(the ‘Pipeline’) to bring natural gas to the Generating Equipment from the 
National Transmission System (the ‘Gas Connection’). The Gas Connection 
also incorporates an Above Ground Installation (AGI) at the point of 
connection to the National Transmission System; and 
� a new electrical connection to export power from the Generating Equipment 
to the National Grid Electricity Transmission System (NETS) (the ‘Electrical 
Connection’), comprising an underground double circuit Tee-in. This would 
require one new tower (which will replace an existing tower and be located 
in the existing Grendon – Sundon transmission route corridor, thereby 
resulting in no net additional towers). This option would require two SECs, 
one located on each side of the existing transmission line, and both circuits 
would then be connected via underground cables approximately 500 m in 
length to a new substation (the ‘Substation’). 
Consultation Report 
Millbrook Power 
 
25 
 
 The Generating Equipment, Access Road and Laydown Area are together 
known as the ‘Power Generation Plant’ and are located within the ‘Power 
Generation Plant Site’. The Power Generation Plant Site is approximately 12.5 
ha in area.  
 The Power Generation Plant, Gas Connection, and Electrical Connection, 
together with all access requirements are referred to as the ‘Project’. The land 
upon which the Project would be developed, or which would be required in order 
to facilitate the development of the Project, is referred to as the ‘Project Site’. 
The Project Site is approximately 48 ha in area. The Project is described in more 
detail in Chapter 3 of the ES (Document Reference 6.1). 
 The new Electrical Connection will comprise one underground double circuit 
Tee-in. This would require one new tower (which will replace an existing tower 
and be located in the existing Grendon – Sundon transmission route corridor, 
thereby resulting in no net additional towers). This connection would require two 
SECs, one located on each side of the existing transmission line, and both 
circuits would then be connected via underground cables approximately 500 
metres in length to a new substation (the ‘Substation’). 
 The Power Generation Plant (including the Access Road and the Laydown 
Area) form an integral part of the nationally significant infrastructure project 
(NSIP). The Gas Connection (including the Pipeline and the AGI) and the 
Electrical Connection constitute associated development within the meaning of 
section 115 of the PA 2008. 
 Pursuant to section 115 of the PA 2008, development consent can be granted 
for the NSIP and associated development. Associated development is 
development associated with the NSIP as set out in section 115 of the PA 2008, 
and having regard to guidance on associated development issued by the 
Secretary of State for Communities and Local Government. Further information 
on the meaning of associated development is set out in the Explanatory 
Memorandum (Document Reference 3.2).

� Section 49: Duty to take account of responses to consultation and publicity.  
Section 37 (PA 2008) 
 This Consultation Report has been prepared in accordance with s37(7) of the 
PA 2008. It seeks to demonstrate how MPL has complied with its duties under 
s42, s46, s47, s48 and s49 of the PA 2008, gives details of relevant responses 
received and the account taken of any relevant responses.  
Section 42 (PA 2008) 
 Under s42 of the PA 2008, bodies prescribed by Schedule 1 of the APFP 
Regulations must be consulted about the proposed application (the ‘prescribed 
bodies’). In addition, each local authority that is set out within s43 of the PA 
2008 must be consulted, as must the people who fall within the categories set 
out in s44. This consultation must be for no shorter a period than 28 days 
beginning with the day after receipt of the consultation documents. 
Section 46 (PA 2008)  
 Under s46 of the PA 2008, the applicant must supply PINS with the same 
information as that supplied to consultees under s42 and s43 of the PA 2008. 
The applicant must do this before commencing consultation under s42.  
Section 47 (PA 2008) 
 Under s47 of the PA 2008, a Statement of Community Consultation (‘SoCC’) 
must be developed for the project and must set out how the applicant proposes 
to consult people living in the vicinity about the proposed application. In 
preparing the SoCC, an applicant must consult the relevant local authorities 
about the SoCC. Those local authorities have 28 days from receiving the draft 
SoCC to comment and the applicant must have regard to comments from the 
relevant local authorities on what should be included in the SoCC. Once the 
SoCC has been finalised, the applicant must make it available for inspection by 
the public in a way that is reasonably convenient for people living in the vicinity 
of the land and must publish a notice in a local newspaper that says where and 
when the SoCC can be inspected. 
Section 48 (PA 2008) 
 Under s48 of the PA 2008, a proposed application is required to be publicised 
once in the London Gazette and a national newspaper and twice in local 
newspapers. The notice must do various things, including explaining where and

when the consultation documents can be viewed and what the deadline is for 
consultation responses (being no earlier than 28 days from the date when the 
last notice was published).  
Section 49 (PA 2008)  
 S49(2) applies where the applicant has complied with s42, s47 and s48, and 
proposes to go ahead with making an application for an order granting 
development consent. Under s49(2) of the PA 2008, the applicant must have 
regard to any relevant responses received during the s42, s47(7) and s48(2) 
consultation before the relevant deadline imposed by the Applicant in 
accordance with s45, s47(7) and s48(2). 
3.4 
The EIA Regulations 
 The Project falls under the EIA Regulations 2009 regime and not the 
Infrastructure Planning (Environmental Impact Assessment) Regulations 2017 
(EIA Regulations 2017) regime. This is because a scoping opinion was 
requested from the SoS under the EIA Regulations 2009 before the EIA 
Regulations 2017 came into effect. This means that, in accordance with the 
transitional arrangements at Regulation 37 of the EIA Regulations 2017, the EIA 
Regulations 2009 will continue to apply to the Project.  
 The following provisions of the EIA Regulations are relevant to statutory 
consultation undertaken on the Project: 
� Regulation 6: Procedure for establishing whether EIA is required; 
� Regulation 8: Application for a scoping opinion; 
� Regulation 9: Procedure to facilitate preparation of environmental 
statements;  
� Regulation 10: if a development is EIA development, how the applicant 
intends to publicise and consult on the preliminary environmental 
information; and 
� Regulation 11: Pre-application publicity under s48 (duty to publicise). 
3.5 
The APFP Regulations 
 The following provisions of the APFP Regulations are relevant to statutory 
consultation undertaken on the Project: 
� Regulation 3: Prescribed consultees; 
� Regulation 4: Publicising a proposed application; and 
� Schedule 1: Circumstances when consultees must be consulted and notified 
about an application.

PINS Advice Note 14 
 PINS Advice Note 14 version 2 provides guidance on the format and content of 
a consultation report. The note also provides relevant advice on dealing with 
statutory consultation including how to present feedback from phased 
consultation processes.     
 Appendix 2.A outlines where recommendations on the content of the 
consultation report made in PINS Advice Note 14 have been complied with 
through the consultation process and addressed in this Consultation Report.

The PA 2008 DCLG pre-application guidance 
 The PA 2008 DCLG pre-application guidance reminds us that the PA 2008 sets 
out statutory requirements for applicants to engage in pre-application 
consultation with local communities, local authorities, and those who would be 
directly affected by the project. The front-loaded emphasis of consultation in the 
major infrastructure planning regime is designed to ensure a more transparent 
and efficient examination process.  
 Appendix 2.A outlines where recommendations on the consultation process 
made in the PA 2008 DCLG pre-application guidance have been complied with 
through the consultation process and addressed in this Consultation Report.

Historical Consultation 
4.1 
Introduction  
 This section sets out an overview of historical consultation undertaken in 
relation to the Project Site in accordance with PINS Advice Note 14 (p3).  MPL’s 
Consultation Plans for the Phase 1 and Phase 2 consultation have been 
influenced by careful consideration of historical consultation carried out on the 
Project Site. 
Draft Central Bedfordshire Local Plan Consultation    
 CBC undertook consultation on the Draft Central Bedfordshire Local Plan 
document under Regulation 18 of the Town and Country Planning (Local 
Planning) (England) Regulations 2012, (‘the Local Plan Regulations’) between 
4th July and 29th August 2017.    
 During this consultation CBC requested comments on growth locations, 
strategic policies and development management policies. However, the draft 
Local Plan did not contain any site specific allocations or policies relating 
specifically to the Project Site. 
Covanta Resource Recovery Facility 
 The Rookery South RRF Project is a separate project promoted by Covanta, 
which is also planned for construction in Rookery South Pit. The Rookery South 
RRF Project was granted a DCO in 2011 (the "RRF Order") and the Order limits 
(i.e. the Red Line Boundary) of the RRF Order partially overlap with the Project 
Site. Section 10 of this Consultation Report explains the interactions between 
the Rookery South RRF Project and the Project. 
 The Project Overview Document consulted on during the Phase 2 consultation 
set out how MPL will manage the relationship with the Rookery South RRF 
Project. The Project Overview Document is contained at Appendix 3.T.ii.  
 As part of the DCO application process for the Rookery South RRF Project, 
Covanta carried out the following consultation activities under the PA 2008 with 
the following:  
i. Statutory consultees, as prescribed under s42(1)(a) of the PA 2008; 
ii. Technical consultees; 
iii. Local Authorities, including neighbouring authorities whose areas adjoin the 
two authority areas within which the Application Site lies; 
iv. Parties with interests in land, falling within the categories set out in s44 of 
the PA 2008; and  
v. The local and wider community. 
Consultation Report 
Millbrook Power 
 
32 
 
 Covanta’s consultation took a variety of forms, including meetings with statutory 
and technical consultees, meetings with and presentations to the community 
liaison panel established for the Covanta RRF project, letters, advertisements, 
public exhibitions, use of a website and a telephone information line. 
 Covanta undertook a direct mail consultation within a radius of 5 km of its site; 
the footprint was then adjusted to reflect Parish Council boundaries. The 
proposed consultation footprint was adjusted to reflect Parish boundaries, to 
avoid splitting villages or local areas along artificial boundaries. The 5 km radius 
was also deemed to be appropriate from a near neighbour issue context, 
following discussions with the local authorities.  During these discussions, 3 km 
(too small), 5 km and 7 km (larger than required) radii were reviewed. The 
choice of Parish Council boundaries also related to stakeholder engagement by 
ensuring that parish/town councils, the finest grained level of local 
representation, were consulted. A distribution company was engaged to deliver 
leaflets and information about the development. 
 In March/April 2017, Consultation was undertaken by the Environment Agency 
(EA) on an application for the Environmental Permit of the Rookery South RRF 
Project. Subsequently, the EA are now undertaking consultation on the draft 
decision in relation to the Environmental Permit application; the consultation is 
due to close on 7th November 2017. 
Bedfordshire and Luton Minerals and Waste Statement of Community 
Involvement (SCI) 
 Bedfordshire County Council (abolished 2009) adopted its Statement of 
Community Involvement (SCI) in October 2006. It explains how the general 
public and all others with an interest in development plans can be involved in 
the Minerals and Waste Development Framework process. This effectively sets 
out the consultation regime that was in place when the Rookery South was 
allocated as a development site by the Minerals and Waste Local Plan Strategic 
Sites and Policies document. 
 Subsequently, Bedfordshire County Council was abolished and replaced by a 
series of unitary authorities including CBC and BBC which inter alia took over 
responsibility for County Matters including minerals and waste planning. This 
SCI is still in force in each of the successor Minerals and Waste Planning 
Authorities. This means that it has been a consideration in the preparation of 
any new planning documents concerning minerals and waste as discussed 
below. 
Minerals and Waste Local Plan: Strategic Sites and Policies 
 In relation to waste, the following preparatory work has been undertaken: 
� The 'Waste Core Strategy Issues and Options Consultation Paper 1', which 
addressed policy issues underwent public consultation from 1st October to 
30th November 2007. 
Consultation Report 
Millbrook Power 
 
33 
 
� The 'Waste Site Allocations Plan Issues and Options Consultation Paper 2' 
set out a portfolio of potential new sites for waste management facilities, 
nominated by waste operators and landowners. This underwent public 
consultation from 1st October to 30th November 2007. The Consultation 
Paper also called for additional site nominations. Following this paper, a 
further eight waste sites were put forward for possible inclusion within the 
Minerals and Waste Local Development Framework, and there was also an 
amendment to information about a previously suggested site regarding its 
capacity. This led to additional public consultation from between 28th April 
and 2nd June 2008. 
� The 'Waste Core Strategy Preferred Options consultation document' (which 
included Strategic sites) underwent public consultation from 1st June to 12th 
July 2010. 
 A combined minerals and waste local plan has been developed from the 
preceding 
consultation 
documents 
discussed 
above 
and 
underwent 
consultation on soundness between 5th December 2011 and 5th February 2012. 
'Main Modifications and Additional Modifications' to the Minerals and Waste 
Core Strategy were subject to consultation between 1st June and 16th July 2012. 
It was then submitted to the SoS on 10th August 2012. BBC, CBC and Luton 
Borough Council’s Minerals and Waste Local Plan: Strategic Sites and Policies 
was adopted on the 30th January 2014.  As part of the Spatial Strategy for 
Waste, Policy WSP2 allocates four sites for waste recovery uses, at Elstow 
North, Land at Former Brogborough landfill, Rookery Pit South, and Land at 
Thorn Turn.   
 The site at Rookery Pit South (107 ha), located predominantly within CBC and 
partly within BBC, is allocated for non-landfill waste management recovery 
operations and non-hazardous landfill, with opportunities for pre-treatment 
recovery operations prior to landfill. 
CBC Statement of Community Involvement 
 CBC published a new Statement of Community Involvement in 2012; this deals 
with a range of consultation scenarios and in particular reflects on sites that are 
already known to the public and suggest that the Council would wish to see 
Developers or landowners take a leading role in consultation as part of their 
obligations to the local community and gives examples of making contact 
regarding such issues (for example exhibitions/workshops run with the local 
community) and extra effort being made to engage with “hard to reach” groups. 
 It encourages schemes for development to be drawn up with considerable (and 
demonstrable) local input, with local support as far as possible and that a 
statement setting out what consultation has taken place should be submitted to 
the Council for consideration as part of the planning application process. 
 Whilst the Project is consented under the PA 2008, rather than the Town and 
Country Planning Act 1990 process (to which the SCI applies), considerable

attention has been paid by MPL to CBC’s SCI in developing MPL’s approach to 
local engagement and consultation.  
4.2 
Summary and conclusions   
 MPL’s Consultation Plans for the Phase 1 and Phase 2 consultation have been 
influenced by careful consideration of historical consultation carried out in 
respect of the Project Site. The Phase 1 Consultation Plan and Phase 2 
Consultation Plan are enclosed at Appendix 2.D and Appendix 2.E. 
 Section 10 of this Consultation Report summarises how MPL has managed the 
interaction between the Project and the Rookery South RRF Project throughout 
the consultation process and sets out how the DCO will manage the interaction 
between the two Projects.

5 Overview of Consultation  
5.1 
Introduction 
 This section provides an overview of the phased approach to the pre-application 
consultation undertaken by MPL during the evolution of the Project.  
5.2 
MPL's Consultation Process  
 At the outset of the Project, MPL recognised that the planning regime 
established by the PA 2008 places significant importance on pre-application 
consultation. Accordingly, MPL has invested considerable time and resources 
in the pre-application phases of the Project, in order to encourage meaningful 
involvement in the process by the local community, those interested in the 
Project Site, local authorities and other prescribed consultees.  
 MPL has undertaken pre-application consultation on the Project in two phases, 
which reflects the Project development timeline.  
 The Project was initially developed and taken through the first phase of 
consultation by MPL under the ownership of MPL in 2014/2015. MPL undertook 
its Phase 1 consultation on the Project between January 2014 and February 
2015  
 In March 2015, it was decided by the previous owners of the Project to put it “on 
hold” primarily because of the then market conditions for new power generation 
in the UK.  However, after acquisition of the Project by Drax in December 2016 
(further described in section 2.3 below) the Project was publicly “re-launched” 
in April 2017. 
 Following this, and in accordance with the PA 2008 DCLG pre-application 
guidance (paragraph 73), MPL decided to undertake a second phase of 
consultation in 2017. The feedback received from the Phase 1 consultation 
informed a number of changes to the Project. The Phase 2 consultation 
provided the opportunity for MPL to inform those who were not involved with 
Phase 1 consultation about the Project and to update consultees on the 
changes to the Project and for all consultees to comment on the revised 
proposals.  
 Consequently, the Project has developed in a consultative and iterative manner 
during successive stages of development as shown in Figure 5.1 and described 
in Section 11.    
Consultation strands  
 Figure 5.1 illustrates the strands of consultation that have been undertaken 
during both Phase 1 consultation and Phase 2 consultation, as required under 
the terms of the PA 2008 and the EIA Regulations 2009.  
Consultation Report 
Millbrook Power

 The definitions are used throughout this Consultation Report to identify how the 
consultation activities relate to the statutory consultation requirements of the PA 
2008 and EIA Regulations 2009. The colour coding shown in Figure 5.1 for the 
various sections of the PA 2008 is applied and used consistently in Table 5.1 
and Table 5.2.  
 For clarity, MPL took the approach of conducting two streamlined statutory 
consultation periods, incorporating the requirements of s42, s46, s47 and s48 
of the PA 2008 during both the Phase 1 consultation and Phase 2 consultation.  
 
Figure 5.1 The strands of consultation 
 MPL undertook non-statutory consultation both leading up to and following on 
from the Phase 1 and Phase 2 statutory consultation periods. In accordance 
with PINS Advice Note 14 (page 4), MPL has clearly indicated and identified 
separately within this Consultation Report non-statutory from statutory 
consultation undertaken. In practice, MPL has afforded equal weight to 
feedback received from statutory and non-statutory consultation activities. This 
approach is reflected throughout this Consultation Report.  
 Table 5.1 provides an overview of pre-application consultation undertaken by 
MPL, in chronological order, and signposts where further information can be 
found in this Consultation Report.

5.3 
MPL’s approach to consultation   
 As noted on the MPL website, “Public consultation is an integral part of the 
planning process and has been an important element of Millbrook Power’s work 
since the project was first announced in 2014. The project’s consultations with 
the local community, local politicians, local groups and other relevant 
organisations, are designed to meet all legal requirements and are based on a 
range of advice and guidance.” 
 In developing its approach to consultation, MPL has taken account of the 
legislative requirements and accompanying guidance. In doing so, MPL has 
sought to ensure that its approach to consultation is 'thorough, effective and 
proportionate,' as set out in the PA 2008 DCLG pre-application guidance 
(paragraph 25).  
 The pre-application consultation encouraged a range of people to express their 
views on the emerging proposals and MPL was able to have regard to those 
views, before important decisions were made. Responses have been generated 
through both non-statutory and statutory consultation undertaken during Phase 
1 consultation and Phase 2 Consultation, as set out in Table 5.1 and Table 5.2.  
Phase 1 Consultation (April 2014 – March 2015) 
 During the Phase 1 consultation, MPL chose to undertake non-statutory 
consultation with the local community, political representatives and other key 
stakeholders several months in advance of the commencement of the Phase 1 
statutory consultation in order to capture any initial input to the ongoing 
refinement of the Project (Stages 2 a to c in Table 5.2).  
 Stakeholders at the national, regional and local levels as well as local 
community representatives were contacted by MPL and public exhibitions were 
held for the benefit of the local community in June 2014 (Stage 4 in Table 5.2). 
During this non-statutory phase of consultation, MPL explained the rationale 
and key objectives of the Project, gave reasons why the Power Generation Plant 
Site had been chosen (and the need for the Project) and presented 
opportunities for feedback on the initial Project concepts. 
 As acknowledged by the PA 2008 DCLG Guidance, there is an inherent tension 
between consulting early and providing sufficient information to enable 
consultees to comment. MPL sought to balance these competing requirements 
by providing clear descriptions of options under consideration and explaining 
the on-going nature of the design development and consultation processes. 
 Drawing on the early feedback on the proposals, MPL was able to consider the 
consultation responses alongside the design development and environmental 
assessment processes. MPL's decision to engage early was subsequently 
validated as this phase of non-statutory consultation would ultimately shape the 
development of the Project; for example, recommendations received from CBC 
and BBC in relation to previous projects in the area guided MPL's decision on

the size of the consultation zones that were included in the Phase 1 SoCC that 
was submitted for comment to CBC and BBC 30th July 2014. 
 MPL set out in the draft Phase 1 SoCC (6a and 6b of Table 5.2) how the 2014 
PEIR would be publicised and proposed to conduct a single phase statutory 
consultation with aligned deadlines for s42 and s48 publicity. In this respect, 
MPL’s approach is compliant with PINS Advice Note 14, which states that it is 
helpful for s48 and s42 deadlines to be aligned. MPL sought to maximise the 
opportunity for consultees to comment on the Project by exceeding the 
minimum statutory timescales of 28 days. In this respect, MPL’s approach to 
the consultation is considered to be straightforward and accessible.  
 The draft Phase 1 SoCC was developed in consultation with CBC and BBC (6a 
and 6b of Table 5.2) and the final version of the Phase 1 SoCC was published 
on the 23rd September 2014 (Appendix 2.D).  
 During Phase 1 statutory consultation, MPL was able to demonstrate how 
feedback generated by early non-statutory consultation had informed an 
iterative process of project evolution and design development.  
Phase 2 Consultation (March 2017 - October 2017) 
 MPL decided to undertake a second phase of consultation after the project was 
resumed in early 2017 in accordance with the PA 2008 DCLG pre-application 
guidance (paragraph 73). The feedback received from the Phase 1 consultation 
informed a number of changes to the Project and the Phase 2 consultation 
provided the opportunity for MPL to inform those who were not involved with 
Phase 1 consultation about the Project and to update consultees on the 
changes to the Project and for all consultees to comment on the revised 
proposals for the Project.  
 During the Phase 2 Consultation, MPL chose again to undertake early informal 
non-statutory 
consultation 
to 
inform 
the 
local 
community, 
political 
representatives and other key stakeholders about the DCO application process 
for the Project resuming (under the new ownership of MPL by Drax) and 
changes made to the Project since the end of the Phase 1 statutory consultation 
(Stages 16 and 17 in Table 5.2).  
 MPL produced a draft Phase 2 SoCC for the Phase 2 consultation which set out 
how the 2017 PEIR produced for the Project would be publicised and consulted 
upon. MPL proposed to conduct a single Phase 2 statutory consultation period 
with aligned deadlines for s42 and s48 publicity reflecting the guidance set out 
in PINS Advice Note 14. Again, MPL sought to maximise the opportunities for 
consultees to comment on the Project by exceeding the minimum statutory 
timescales of 28 days. In this respect, MPL’s approach to the consultation is 
considered to be straightforward and accessible.  
 The draft Phase 2 SoCC was developed in consultation with CBC and BBC 
(Stages 18a and 18b in Table 5.2). The final version of the Phase 2 SoCC was 
published on 8th May 2017.

Project Consultation Milestones 
 Table 5.2 presents a summary of project consultation milestones detailing how 
the Project has evolved from the site selection process to the preparation of the 
Application, and the key project design decisions taken at each stage. 
 Section 7 and Section 9 of this Consultation Report respectively explain how 
feedback generated during Phase 1 consultation and Phase 2 consultation

Summary  
 The phased approach to consultation undertaken by MPL is considered to be 
appropriate to the scale and timeline of the Project. MPL has maintained an 
internal communications logging system to record incoming and outgoing 
consultation for both statutory and non-statutory consultation. 
 Section 6 and Section 8 describe the consultation activities undertaken by MPL 
for the various strands of consultation during Phase 1 and Phase 2 of the pre-
application consultation.

Description of Phase 1 Consultation (April 2014 
– March 2015) 
6.1 
Introduction 
 This section describes the non-statutory and statutory consultation activities that 
MPL undertook as part of the Phase 1 Consultation.  
6.2 
Phase 1 Non-statutory consultation (April 2014 - October 2014) (prior to 
Phase 1 statutory consultation) 
 MPL undertook non-statutory consultation with CBC and BBC on its draft Phase 
1 Consultation Plan and the Phase 1 SoCC in June and July 2014 to aid early 
consideration of key elements of MPL's proposed consultation strategy with the 
local community (see Appendix 2.D for copies of the Phase 1 Consultation Plan 
and the Phase 1 SoCC).  
 The draft Phase 1 Consultation Plan and the Phase 1 SoCC explained how MPL 
intended to consult people living and working in the vicinity of the proposed 
Project. The documents set out the methodology for both Phase 1 non-statutory 
and statutory consultation with the local community. The development of the 
Phase 1 Consultation Plan and the Phase 1 SoCC into their final form and the 
statutory consultation with the local authorities on the Phase 1 SoCC is 
explained in paragraph 6.4.43 to 6.4.65. 
 As indicated earlier, MPL's first engagement and communication with the local 
community was a non-statutory consultation, at a relatively early stage of project 
development (Stage 4 in Table 5.2). 
 The focus of this stage of consultation was to raise awareness of the Project 
and invite initial views on the overall concept of the scheme. It also increased 
MPL's understanding of the area, local issues and established contact with local 
representatives such as ward and parish councillors and the constituency MP 
for the site.  
 MPL shared its initial plans for the Project with people living in the vicinity of the 
Project Site and Parish Council members via letter, media reports and public 
exhibitions held over three days on 5th, 6th and 7th June 2014 in Lidlington, 
Stewartby and Marston Moretaine. These exhibitions were publicised in 
advance and this is addressed in paragraph 6.2.1 to 6.2.6 for further detail. 
Consultation materials associated with the exhibition are provided in Appendix 
3.A.  
 During the exhibitions, MPL received and responded to comments on the 
Project and its impact on the environment, local communities and the local 
economy. The responses generated by this phase of consultation are 
summarised in section 7.2 of this Consultation Report. 
Consultation Report 
Millbrook Power

Phase 1 non-statutory consultation with key stakeholders (April 2014 – 
October 2014)  
 Non-statutory consultation with key stakeholders also commenced in April 2014, 
including with a number of regulatory agencies.  
 MPL also engaged with elected CBC and BBC Councillors, the MP for the site 
area and spoke to the local media as summarised in Table 5.1. 
 The purpose of this parallel engagement was to raise awareness of the 
proposals and to increase MPL's understanding of the local context and assist 
with the identification of potential considerations capable of influencing the 
development of the Project. 
 The term "key stakeholders" is used to describe consultation with bodies and 
individuals who can be classified as statutory agencies, decision-makers, 
political representatives or people identified under s42(1)(d) of the PA 2008. It 
is employed to distinguish the consultation activities with these bodies, from 
those undertaken with the local community. There is some overlap across the 
two, for instance councillors and MPs. 
 Table 6.1 refers to the meetings held with key stakeholders between April 2014 
and October 2014 at which MPL sought to raise awareness of the Project and 
gain early feedback (part of Stage 2a – c in Table 5.1, non-statutory 
consultation). At the meetings, MPL outlined the intended Project timetable for 
submission of the DCO Application and consultation periods.  
 MPL also responded to individual queries and information requests from 
consultees via email, letter and phone call.

Development of the initial Project description  
 Non-statutory consultation with the community and statutory consultees was 
undertaken at the same time as the development of the Project design and the 
preparation of the 2014 PEIR. The Project description that was used in the 2014 
PEIR and more generally in any Phase 1 non-statutory consultation materials is 
summarised in paragraph 6.2.14. 
 The description of the Project as it stood during the Phase 1 non-statutory 
consultation and, in particular, the 2014 PEIR was as follows:

“A new Power Generation Plant in the form of a Simple Cycle Gas Turbine 
(SCGT) gas fired peaking power generating station fuelled by natural gas and 
capable of providing an electrical capacity of up to 299 Megawatts (MW) 
comprising: 
� The Generating Equipment including the Gas Turbine Generators and 
balance of plant, which are located within the Generating Equipment Site; 
� A new purpose built Access Road from Green Lane to the Generating 
Equipment Site; and 
� During construction a temporary construction compound (the Laydown 
Area). 
A new Gas Connection to bring natural gas to the Generating Equipment from 
the National Transmission System which is located within the Gas Connection 
Opportunity Area; and 
A new Electrical Connection to export power from the Generating Equipment to 
the National Grid Electricity Transmission System (NETS) for distribution to 
homes and businesses which is located within the Electrical Connection 
Opportunity Area. 
The Generating Equipment, Access Road and Laydown Area are together 
known as the Power Generation Plant, and are located within the Power 
Generation Plant Site”. 
Phase 1 non-statutory consultation: the CCZ and OCZ 
 The CCZ (see Figure 6.1) is the area in which MPL focused its primary Phase 
1 statutory and non-statutory consultation activity, for example leaflet 
distribution.  The OCZ (see Figure 6.2) is a wider area in which MPL carried out 
Phase 1 consultation activity on the Project proposals, for example media 
coverage and email contact with parish councils in the outer zone. 
 Early feedback (in May 2014) received from CBC and BBC councillors on the 
consultation process resulted in an increase in MPL’s initial proposals for a CCZ 
from 3km to 5km, identification of hard to reach groups, contact with more 
distant Parish Councils in the OCZ and provision of further information at the 
statutory consultation exhibitions.   
 The CCZ that was used during Phase 1 non-statutory consultation equates to 
an approximate 5 km distance from the Generating Equipment Site; it was 
adjusted to reflect Parish Council boundaries and ensure that no settlements 
were divided. The OCZ equates to an approximate 10 km radius. 
 The geographical extent of the CCZ for Phase 1 non-statutory consultation is 
shown in Figure 6.1 (marked in blue) and was agreed with CBC and BBC at the 
start of the consultation process. It was established to capture the main 
population areas within the Parish Councils that were within close vicinity of the 
Consultation Report 
Millbrook Power

Site, including those considered most likely to be impacted by the Project and 
expected to have the greatest interest in it, namely the villages of Stewartby, 
How End, Ampthill, Millbrook and Marston Moretaine. The CCZ includes all of 
the following parish council areas: 
� Wootton; 
� Stewartby; 
� Houghton Conquest; 
� Ampthill; 
� Maulden; 
� Millbrook; 
� Lidlington; and 
� Marston Moretaine. 
 The OCZ for Phase 1 consultation is shown in Figure 6.2 and was also agreed 
with BBC and CBC. It includes the main population area of Bedford. MPL did 
not anticipate that the communities and businesses that lie within the OCZ 
would be significantly impacted by the Project’s construction, operation and 
maintenance; although MPL recognised that they may nevertheless be 
interested in it.

 Letters about the Project were also delivered to circa 10,500 residential 
addresses in the local community within a 5km radius of the Project Site in the 
CCZ. The location and extent of the CCZ is included in Figure 6.1 and explained 
in paragraph 6.2.15 to 6.2.19. 
 Details of the dates and venues of the local exhibitions were reported in the 
local media following a press release issued by MPL on 30th May 2014; this is 
contained in Appendix 3.C.  
 An advertisement for the exhibitions was also published in the Bedfordshire on 
Sunday newspaper on 1st June 2014 and is contained in Appendix 3.D.

 Twelve posters were distributed and eight posters were put up at appropriate 
locations in the vicinity of the site and exhibition locations (see Appendix 3.E for 
a copy of the poster).  
 The June 2014 public exhibitions were staffed by members of the MPL Project 
team, who were all knowledgeable about the proposals and the intended Project 
timeline. The team proactively sought to engage with attendees to provide 
information and answer questions. 
 At the exhibitions, large information display boards were set up containing 
information relating to the Project (refer to Appendix 3.A.i) and information 
leaflets were made available (refer to Appendix 3.A.ii), including information on: 
� The Power Generation Plant; 
� Who MPL is; 
� The need for gas generation; 
� Why Rookery South Pit; 
� Community benefits; 
� The environment; 
� Planning and consultation; and 
� Key milestones. 
 Approximately 250 people attended the exhibitions. Attendees were asked to 
complete a feedback form for return on the day or at a later date via free-post 
(see Appendix 3.A.iii). The summary of feedback received can be found in 
section 7.2. 
Media coverage 
 Copies of the media coverage of the Project during the Phase 1 non-statutory 
consultation phase are provided in Appendix 3.G. The following provides a

 MPL submitted articles about the Project in September/October 2014 for 
publication in the Houghton Conquest Parish Newsletter (Appendix 3.G.vii) and 
for Stewartby Parish Council’s website and newsletter (Appendix 3.G.viii), 
though MPL understands that the Parish Councils inadvertently failed to publish 
it. 
 Further articles were submitted by MPL in January-February 2015 to Houghton 
Conquest Parish Newsletter (Appendix 3.G.ix) and Stewartby Parish Council’s 
website and newsletter (Appendix 3.G.x). The article was published on 
Stewartby Parish Council’s website and in Houghton Conquest Parish 
Newsletter.  
6.3 
Phase 1 EIA scoping consultation (June 2014) 
 Whilst EIA Scoping is not a requirement of the PA 2008 regime, MPL considered 
that it might be helpful to consultees under MPL's PA 2008 consultation 
programme to understand the consultation activities that were undertaken in 
relation to the EIA for the Project. As such, this Consultation Report outlines the 
consultation that has been undertaken in relation to the EIA Scoping stage. 
More detail on how MPL's ES has taken on board comments of statutory 
consultees can be found in the ES itself (Document Reference 6.1). 
 MPL's EIA Scoping Report (Appendix 1.2 of the ES) was submitted to PINS on 
19th June 2014 and was received on 20th June 2014.  It accompanied a request 
for a Scoping Opinion under Regulation 8 of the EIA Regulations from the SoS 
(PINS processes the request on behalf of the SoS). At the same time, the 
covering letter advised the SoS under Regulation 6(1)(b) of the EIA Regulations 
2009 that MPL intended to submit an ES as part of its DCO Application 
Consultation Report 
Millbrook Power 
 
63 
 
(Appendix 3.I). The then Red Line Boundary (Scoping Report Figure 1) is shown 
in Figure 6.3 below.  
 The Scoping Report provided an introduction to the Project, including the need 
for the Project and its benefits, the developer, the consenting regime and the 
EIA process. It set out the intended scope and structure of the ES as well as a 
detailed description of the assessments proposed in order to understand the 
likely significant environmental effects of the Project. The Scoping Report set 
out 
MPL's 
intention 
to 
assess 
the 
construction, 
operational 
and 
decommissioning phases of the Project. 
Project description for EIA Scoping Report  
 The Project description included within the EIA Scoping Report (ES 
Appendices, Document Reference 6.2) was the same as that for the Phase 1 
non-statutory consultation and as set out above in 6.2.12. 
 The description that was used in the EIA Scoping Report was: The Power 
Generation Plant would be designed as a Simple Cycle Gas Turbine (SCGT) 
peaking plant fired by natural gas supplied by a new underground gas pipeline 
connecting the Power Generation Plant to the existing National Transmission 
System. It would have a capacity of up to 299 MW (enough to power the 
equivalent of 400,000 homes). 
 A number of options were under consideration at this time, including: 
� Power Generation Plant options: 
- 
Three, four or five individual aero-derivative gas turbine generators to 
achieve 299 MW; 
- 
One or two individual industrial gas turbine generators will be used to 
achieve 299MW; 
- 
Up to 90m (length), up to 150m (width) and up to 20m (height).  
� Stack options: 
- 
One to five stacks; 
- 
Up to 60m in height from the base of Rookery South Pit and up to a 10m 
diameter.  
� Access option: 
- 
1.7 km long road from Green Lane to the Generating Equipment Site. 
� Gas Connection options: 
-

- 
Gas receiving station up to 50m by 50m (width) and up to 3m (height). 
� Electrical Connection Options: 
- 
Located to the south of the Generating Equipment site within the 
Electrical Connection opportunity area;  
- 
Underground or overhead line; 
- 
400kV substation located either on the Generation Equipment Site or 
adjacent to the existing 400kV overhead line running from Sundon to 
Grendon.  
� Other buildings/infrastructure options: 
- 
Up to two (2) water tanks that are up to 24m (diameter) and up to 15m

 An acknowledgment of receipt of the EIA Scoping Report was received from 
PINS on 20th June 2014.  
 A copy of the Regulation 9 list was received from PINS on 9th July 2014 
(Appendix 3.J.ii).  
 A Scoping Opinion was received from PINS on 28th July 2014 (Appendix 3.K). 
The Scoping Opinion included a list of all consultees consulted by PINS during 
scoping. The Scoping Report and Scoping Opinion are contained as 
Appendices to the ES (Document Reference 6.2).  
 As well as the formal Scoping Opinion being received, on-going consultation 
with consultees was undertaken by MPL in order to seek to agree the scope 
and content of the EIA methodology. These discussions and the Scoping 
Opinion responses have been considered and reflected in the production of the 
2014 and 2017 PEIRs as well as the ES (Document Reference 6.1). The 2014 
PEIR was subsequently published during statutory consultation and the ES is 
submitted with the Application. MPL’s response to comments received during 
the scoping process is contained within the ES (Document Reference 6.1). 
6.4 
Phase 1 statutory consultation (October 2014 - November 2014) 
 Following the period of non-statutory consultation and EIA Scoping consultation 
described above, MPL undertook a series of activities in accordance with the 
statutory requirements of the PA 2008. Each element of the statutory 
consultation fulfils a particular requirement of the PA 2008 and was undertaken 
following the structure provided in. These strands of consultation are explained 
in more detail in the following section. 
Regulation 6 notice 
 A notification under Regulation 6 of the EIA Regulations 2009 was included as 
part of the request for a Scoping Opinion submitted to PINS on 19th June 2014 
(Appendix 3.I). 
Phase 1 Section 46 notification  
 On behalf of the SoS, PINS received the following information on 7th October 
2014 (despatched 6th October 2014 for next day delivery) prior to the 
commencement of the s42 consultation (this started on 13 October 2014) and 
in accordance with s46 of the PA 2008: 
� A covering letter (Appendix 3.L.i); 
� An electronic copy of the Project’s 2014 PEIR; 
� A hard copy of the Non-Technical Summary of the 2014 PEIR; and 
� A hard copy of an information leaflet that formed part of MPL's community 
consultation under s47 of the PA 2008. 
Consultation Report 
Millbrook Power

 An acknowledgement of receipt was received from PINS on 8th October 2014 
(Appendix 3.L.ii).  
Phase 1 Section 42 consultation  
 s42 of the PA 2008 requires that MPL consults about its proposed application 
with the following: 
� s42(1)(a): prescribed persons; 
� s42(1)(b): local authorities within s43; and 
� s42(1)(d): those persons falling within s44. 
 In the case of the Project, neither s42(1) (aa) (the Marine Management 
Organisation) nor s42(1)(c) (the Greater London Authority) were relevant.  
 Pursuant to s45 of the PA 2008, the statutory consultation period under s42 
must be a minimum of 28 days from the day after the consultee receives the 
consultation documents. However, in order to provide a slightly longer 
consultation window, MPL's statutory consultation commenced on 13th October 
2014 and concluded on 16th November 2014; allowing a period of 35 days.  
Consultation under section 42(1)(a): prescribed persons 
 Under s42(1)(a) of the PA 2008, bodies prescribed by Schedule 1 of the APFP 
Regulations were required to be consulted (the ‘prescribed bodies’).  
 In order to identify these prescribed bodies, the list of consultees notified of the 
proposed application by PINS (under Regulation 9(1)(a) of the EIA Regulations) 
was used as a starting point.  
 In some instances, the contact address used in the consultation differs from the 
Regulation 9 list provided by PINS.  This is the result of further inquiries that led 
to a change in address or notification by the consultee that a differing address 
should be used. The contact addresses used are contained in Appendix 3.N. 
 MPL also considered Schedule 1 of the APFP Regulations and where a body 
appeared to be statutory consultee, then they were consulted.  
 The list of prescribed persons consulted under s42(1)(a) of the PA 2008 is 
contained in Appendix 3.N.  
 The relevant Parish Councils under s42(1)(a) are:  
� Stewartby Parish Council; 
� Marston Moretaine Parish Council; 
� Ampthill Town Council; 
Consultation Report 
Millbrook Power 
 
68 
 
� Millbrook Parish Meeting; and 
� Houghton Conquest Parish Council. 
 Although the following Parish Councils are not prescribed consultees under s42 
of the PA 2008, MPL delivered materials to and invited these additional Parish 
Councils to actively participate in the consultation process.  This was due to 
their close proximity to the Project Site:  
� Wootton Parish Council 
� Lidlington Parish Council 
� Maulden Parish Council 
� Cranfield Parish Council 
Consultation under section 42(1)(b): local authorities 
 Pursuant to s42(1)(b) the Local Authorities falling within s43 needed to be 
consulted by MPL. In order to identify the host and neighbouring authorities 
referred to in s43, the Local Government Boundary Commission website was 
accessed, together with local authority websites for verification purposes. A plan 
showing the local authority boundaries is included at Appendix 3.P. 
 The Project lies within both CBC and BBC administrative boundaries; CBC and 
BBC are therefore ‘B’ authorities for the purpose of s43(2) of the PA 2008.     
 The following local authorities are located adjacent to CBC and BBC and as 
such are ‘A’ authorities for the purpose of s43(2) of the PA 2008. The following 
‘A’ authorities were therefore consulted by MPL (in addition to CBC and BBC) 
pursuant to s42 of the PA 2008:  
� Northamptonshire County Council 
� Cambridgeshire County Council 
� Hertfordshire County Council 
� Milton Keynes Council 
� Buckinghamshire County Council 
� Luton Borough Council 
� Wellingborough Council 
� East Northamptonshire Council 
� Huntingdonshire District Council 
� South Cambridgeshire District Council 
Consultation Report 
Millbrook Power 
 
69 
 
� North Hertfordshire District Council 
� Aylesbury Vale District Council 
� St Albans City and District 
� Dacorum Borough Council 
 All of these local authorities were also consulted under s47 of the PA 2008, and 
were sent the final Phase 1 SoCC and Scoping Report (see below).  
Phase 1 consultation under section 42(1)(d): s44 persons with an interest in the 
land 
 s42(1)(d) parties consist of persons either with a range of land interests or who 
may make a claim under certain land compensation legislation as follows: 
� A person is within Category 1 if the applicant, after making diligent inquiry, 
knows that the person is an owner, lessee, tenant (whatever the tenancy 
period) or occupier of the land. 
� A person is within Category 2 if the applicant, after making diligent inquiry, 
knows that the person - 
a. is interested in the land, or 
b. has power - 
i. to sell and convey the land, or 
ii. to release the land. 
� A person is within Category 3 if the applicant thinks that, if the order sought 
by the proposed application were to be made and fully implemented, the 
person would or might be entitled: 
a. 
as a result of the implementing of the order, 
b. as a result of the order having been implemented, or 
c. 
as a result of use of the land once the order has been implemented,  
to make a relevant claim. A "relevant claim" is then defined in s44 by 
reference to particular land compensation legislation. 
 Landowner consultees were identified by MPL by undertaking diligent inquiries. 
Initially, plans were submitted to the Land Registry to identify all registered titles. 
These were then examined to further identify all interests noted against the title 
in each case. A site/area visit was then carried out in order to check that the 
desktop information being processed tallied with the boundaries and occupants 
in practice.   
Consultation Report 
Millbrook Power

 Further information from each landowner was sought directly by requesting that 
they complete a full enquiry form for each parcel of land - stipulating the freehold 
/ leasehold interests, the occupiers if any, and other rights on / over the land 
whether registered or not.  
 Following the receipt of the enquiry forms, a further site and area visit was 
conducted to cross check the data received against any observable 
inconsistencies or to establish whether further interests existed which may have 
been unidentified earlier in the process. 
 Potential Category 3 interests were identified by holding meetings and reviews 
to discuss the total areas likely to be affected by the physical impacts from the 
Project in construction and operation (for example noise) and noting persons 
who may potentially be able to make a claim under certain land compensation 
legislation in this regard. Consideration was given to neighbouring landowners 
and their use of premises. 
 There were a small number of additional land interests identified on 15th 
October 2014.  These were added to the existing landowner list and consulted 
accordingly (see paragraph 6.4.31 to 6.4.39 for more details on the timings of 
the receipt of the consultation documents and for confirmation that a minimum 
of 28 days was provided for consultation feedback). 
 One further land interest relating to a shooting licence was identified as a result 
of ongoing diligent inquiry on 21st January 2015 (O-MIL-s42-PBA-P-L-184). The 
schedule of land interests was updated on a continuous basis during the 
preparation of the Book of Reference (Document Reference 4.3) in order to 
identify any new land interests. This party was added to the s42(1)(d) list and 
consulted and given their own consultation period which began on 26th January 
2015 and ended on 24th February 2015, thereby the minimum of 28 days was 
provided for consultation feedback. The consultee did not respond to s42 
consultation.  
The Phase 1 section 42 consultation  
 The full list of s42 parties (i.e. those consulted pursuant to s42(1)(a); s42(1)(b) 
and s42(1)(d)) is included as Appendix 3.N. 
 The s42 consultation information that was sent out to each consultee 
comprised:  
� A covering letter providing an overview of the Project and details of the 
consultation process (Appendix 3.R); 
� A paper copy of the 2014 PEIR NTS (Appendix 3.S); 
� A CD copy of the 2014 PEIR; and 
� A copy of the MPL publicity leaflet, which included a freepost 
feedback/comment form. 
Consultation Report 
Millbrook Power

 The s42 materials were delivered in a range of formats, depending on the type 
of consultee, as described below. 
 All consultees received a CD containing the 2014 PEIR and the 2014 PEIR NTS 
and a hard copy of the 2014 PEIR NTS, as it was considered that not all 
consultees may have access to the internet or a computer to insert the CD in 
order to access the NTS. S42(1)(b) local authority consultees also received an 
additional hard copy of the 2014 PEIR, due to their role as local authority. All 
hard copies of the 2014 PEIR for s42(1)(b) consultees were dispatched on 7th 
October 2014 and hand delivered to the addresses by 9th October 2014. 
 All letters and information packs (containing the CD and 2014 PEIR NTS) were 
sent by Royal Mail Special Delivery (guaranteed 1.00pm next day); this allowed 
for tracking of the packages and proof of delivery.  The majority were dispatched 
on 7th October 2014 for delivery on 8th October 2014 in advance of the start of 
the consultation period.  
 There were however, a small number dispatched on 16th October 2014. A 
precautionary approach was taken for these packages as they were dispatched 
by both Royal Mail Special Delivery (guaranteed 1.00pm next day), and next 
day courier service.  The packages dispatched on 16th October 2014 and proof 
of delivery was received by 17th October 2014, thereby providing the minimum 
28-day consultation period. These packages were sent to the following 
consultees (as these are all s42(1)(d) consultees, a code is used in place of the 
consultees name in the interests of confidentiality):  
� O-MIL-s42-ST-PBA-L-133  
� O-MIL-s42-ST-PBA-L-134  
� O-MIL-s42-ST-PBA-L-135 
� O-MIL-s42-ST-PBA-L-136  
� O-MIL-s42-ST-PBA-L-137   
 In addition, the land interest (O-MIL-s42-PBA-P-L-184) identified on 21st 
January 2015 was given their own consultation period which commenced on 
26th January 2015 and closed on 24th February 2015. They were sent the s42 
consultation information package as outlined in paragraph 6.4.27.   
 Following dispatch of all the s42 information, the online tracking system was 
used to monitor delivery. Proof of delivery was recorded for each consultee. 
Proof of delivery 
 Online tracking records indicate that all packages dispatched by Royal Mail 
Special Delivery were successfully received or delivered prior to the start of the 
consultation period (13th October 2014) with the exception of those detailed in 
this section.

 One s42 package was returned to MPL by Royal Mail stating ‘addressee gone 
away’; this was for a s42(1)(d) consultee (O-MIL-s42-ST-PBA-L-94). To ensure 
delivery of this information to the address, the pack was delivered by hand to 
the address on 16th October 2014.  
 There were five addresses, according to the Royal Mail online tracking system, 
where the packages were not successfully received or delivered (four s42(1)(a) 
consultees and one s42(1)(b) consultee).  To ensure delivery or receipt of these, 
additional copies were issued as follows:  
� ESP Networks and North Hertfordshire District Council packages were 
dispatched on 15th October 2014 by next day courier service. Confirmation 
of delivery was received on 16th October 2014.  
� LNG Portable Pipelines Limited package was delivered by hand on 16th 
October 2014, and The Crown Estate and Instalcom Limited packages were 
delivered by hand on 17th October 2014. These hand deliveries were all 
conducted by MPL’s own staff. 
 One further package was not tracked through the Royal Mail system (O-MIL-
s42-ST-PBA-L-117).  To ensure that the recipient had access to a copy of the 
documents, another pack was dispatched by Royal Mail Special Delivery to the 
recipient on 14th October 2014.  As no proof of delivery for this package was 
received by 15th October 2014 (proof of delivery was confirmed on 21st October 
2014); a representative from MPL visited O-MIL-s42-ST-PBA-L-117 on 16th 
October 2014 and the recipient confirmed that the original package (dispatched 
on 7th October 2014) had been received.   
 The packages covered in this section were all received or delivered to the 
addresses prior to 17th October 2014, allowing the statutory minimum 
consultation period (28 days) as the Phase 1 statutory consultation ended on 
16th November 2014.  
 In the case of the further land party identified on 21st January 2015, the package 
was delivered prior to the 26th January 2015, allowing the statutory minimum 
consultation period (28 days).   
Returned letters 
 Two s42 packages were returned by the recipients, one s42(1)(a) consultee 
(Scotland Gas Networks Plc) on 3rd November 2014 and one s42(1)(b) 
consultee (North Hertfordshire District Council) on 20th October 2014.   
 Scotland Gas Networks Plc stated in their returned package that the 
correspondence should be redirected to NGG.  As NGG are already a s42(1)(a) 
consultee, a package had already been sent to their registered address.   
 North Hertfordshire District Council returned their original package with a 
compliments slip stating that the enquiry should be dealt with by BBC.   A letter 
was sent from MPL on 21st October 2014 to North Hertfordshire District Council 
Consultation Report 
Millbrook Power 
 
73 
 
explaining why the consultation documents were sent to them. The second 
package which had been issued to North Hertfordshire District Council was then 
returned with a note confirming that they didn’t need a copy of the CD and 
documents for their records.  
Statutory Consultation on the Phase 1 SOCC 
 s47(1) of the PA 2008 requires that applicants prepare a statement setting out 
how they proposed to consult people living in the vicinity of a proposed 
development, about the proposed application for that development. 
 This statement is known as a SoCC. In developing the consultation strategy to 
be set out in a SoCC, the applicant must consult the local authority(ies) within 
whose area their project site lies for a statutory period of 28 days from the day 
after receipt of the draft SoCC. Under s47 of the PA 2008, a SoCC must be 
developed for the project having due regard to comments from local 
authority(ies) on what should be included in the SoCC.  
 As PINS Advice Note 14 emphasises, this consultation is important as the local 
authorities possess unique local knowledge that can influence the approach to 
and the methods of consultation.  
 Consultation may also occur outside of statutorily defined consultation, although 
potentially involving the same consultees.  PINS Advice Note 14 highlights that 
non-statutory consultation should not necessarily be afforded any less weight 
than the statutorily defined consultation. This approach has been adopted by 
MPL and the way in which this Consultation Report is presented reflects that 
approach. 
 A draft copy of the Phase 1 Consultation Plan and Phase 1 SoCC was sent to 
CBC Senior Planning Officer on 27th June 2014 for informal review (Appendix 
2.B.i).  
 A meeting was held on 3rd July 2014 at the main office of CBC between 
representatives from MPL and Officers from CBC. The meeting was an 
opportunity for MPL to talk through the draft 2014 Consultation Plan and Phase 
1 SoCC and for CBC to raise any queries or issues. At the meeting, CBC officers 
confirmed that they were happy with the draft Phase 1 SoCC and -2014 
Consultation Plan, both in terms of MPL’s overall approach to consultation and 
the specific elements of the Phase 1 SoCC. CBC agreed to provide contact 
details of colleagues who could help to define and add to MPL’s list of hard to 
reach groups and advise if there was an umbrella group for parish councils. 
 A draft copy of the 2014 Consultation Plan and Phase 1 SoCC was also sent to 
BBC Planning Case Officer on 9th July 2014 for informal review (Appendix 
2.B.ii). 
 Comments were received via email on 30th July from BBC Planning Case 
Officer, who had taken over from the previous BBC Planning Case Officer. BBC 
directed MPL to guidance from the Statement of Community Involvement (SCI) 
Consultation Report 
Millbrook Power 
 
74 
 
available on the Council’s website (Appendix 2.B.iii), which deals with the 
Council’s promises in terms of publicity and consultation. It was considered that 
following this guidance would ensure that MPL would meet the levels of public 
consultation and involvement expected from the Council. 
 Pursuant to s47(2) of the PA 2008 the draft 2014 Consultation Plan, together 
with the draft Phase 1 SoCC and Phase 1 SoCC Notice were sent to CBC and 
BBC for statutory consultation on 30th July 2014 (cover letters provided 
Appendix 2.B.iv and Appendix 2.B.v). 
 The cover letter accompanying the documents explained that in accordance 
with s47(2) of the PA 2008, MPL must consult the Councils about what is to be 
in the SoCC and that MPL therefore requested that the Councils provide 
comments on the draft Phase 1 SoCC and 2014 Consultation Plan. 
 The Scoping Opinion and, for completeness, the Scoping Report were also 
enclosed to provide contextual project information to CBC and BBC to ensure 
the Councils were able to make an informed response in regards to the draft 
Phase 1 SoCC and the 2014 Consultation Plan. 
 The cover letter further set out the deadline for receipt by MPL of responses 
from each Council as the end of the period of 28 days that began with the day 
after the day on which the Council received the enclosed documents. 
 A response was received from CBC on 26th August 2014 (Appendix 2.B.vii). In 
their formal response, CBC confirmed that they did not have any further 
comments to make other than those which they made at the meeting prior to 
the submission of the draft Phase 1 SoCC and -2014 Consultation Plan (the 
meeting of 3rd July 2014). They commented that there were still areas to be 
“tidied up” within the document and noted that they would forward separately a 
couple of additional ‘hard to reach’ groups (Appendix 2.B.vii).  These ‘hard to 
reach’ groups were provided to MPL via email on 27th August 2014. Contact 
details were ultimately given for representatives of the following groups: 
Community Engagement Network, Older Peoples Reference Group and Youth 
Parliament. 
 In their response, CBC commented that: ‘Other than these slight tweaks to the 
submitted document it appears to outline a thorough consultation process to be 
undertaken prior to the DCO being submitted next year’. 
 A response was received from BBC on 2nd September 2014 (Appendix 2.B.ix). 
The response noted that MPL had taken into account the comments made by 
BBC Case Planning Officer in their email of 30th July 2014 and that the contents 
of the Council’s Statement of Community Involvement had been taken into 
account in the preparation of the draft 2014 Consultation Plan.  
 BBC further stated in their response that: ‘Your draft plan is comprehensive and 
demonstrates the intention for a significant level of public consultation and 
involvement to at least the level specified in the Council’s Statement of 
Community Involvement’.

 In response to MPL’s request for advice in seeking out ‘hard to reach’ groups, 
BBC provided contact details for the Council’s Equality and Diversity Officer and 
advised that they would be able to offer advice in this regard. BBC also 
confirmed that to their knowledge there were no other significant public 
consultation exercises planned for the October/November timescale within that 
part of the Borough. 
 Following this consultation and prior to its publication, further minor changes 
were made to the Phase 1 SoCC which encompassed the following: 
� The Project’s red line boundary was revised slightly which was reflected in 
the maps showing the Consultation Zones. The changes reflected a 
reduction in the size of the Gas Connection opportunity area as the gas 
connection design had been refined, an extension of the Redline around the 
junction onto Green Lane following consultation with highways officials and 
the Highways Authority (to allow for a safe junction to be built) and a small 
extension into Millbrook Vehicle Proving Ground to allow for temporary 
works for construction of the Electrical Connection; 
� Exhibition venues, dates and times were finalised with minor changes to 
timing; and 
� Specific consultation questions were finalised. 
 CBC and BBC were informed of these changes on 15th September 2014 and 
were sent the finalised Phase 1 SoCC (Appendix 2.B.x).  
 s47 requires the applicant to make its SoCC available for inspection by the 
public in a way that is reasonably convenient for them.  The applicant then has 
to carry out its consultation in accordance with its published SoCC. Pursuant to 
s47(6), notices relating to where and when the Phase 1 SoCC was available to 
be inspected were published in local newspapers as described in Table 6.3. 
Copies of the notices are available in Appendix 3.U.

 The final Phase 1 SoCC (Appendix 2.D) was published on the MPL website on 
23rd September 2014. The Phase 1 SoCC was made available to the public at 
the following locations:

 Following the issue of the finalised Phase 1 SoCC, BBC stated over phone and 
email (17th September 2014) that a different location than that previously agreed 
should be used to lodge the documents, suggesting the Customer Service 
Centre, 2 Horne Lane, Bedford, MK40 1SJ instead of the main Council offices 
at Borough Hall, Cauldwell Street, Bedford, MK42 9AP. It was later agreed that 
it was too late to change this location as some documents had already been 
published. However, MPL agreed (over the phone) on 18th September 2014 to 
send two copies to the Customer Services Centre so that it could be placed in 
both locations.  
 No further comments were received from CBC following the issue of the revised 
Phase 1 SoCC. 
Phase 1 Section 47 consultation  
 MPL undertook statutory s47 consultation with the local community and key 
stakeholders (Stage 8a of Table 5.2) in accordance with the published Phase 1 
SoCC. 
 The statutory s47 consultation phase commenced on 13th October 2014 and 
closed on 16th November 2014, representing a total duration of 35 days, in 
excess of the statutory minimum requirement of 28 days. 
 The aim of this phase of consultation was to seek the views of the local 
community and key stakeholders on the preliminary environmental information 
presented about the Project as well as on other key elements of the Project.  
This provided a mechanism for the local community and key stakeholders to 
influence certain aspect of the Project, such as:  
� the layout of the Power Generation Plant within the Project Site; 
� route option(s) for accessing the gas and electricity connection 
infrastructure during construction and maintenance; 
� the preferred route option for the gas connection; 
� the proposed electrical connection; and 
Consultation Report 
Millbrook Power 
 
77 
 
� the findings of the preliminary assessment on the likely significant 
environmental effects of the Project during construction and operation, as 
set out in the 2014 PEIR. 
 The local community and key stakeholders were not however, asked to 
comment on other elements of the Project, such as the technology choice for 
the Power Generation Plant.  
 MPL undertook statutory s47 consultation activities in two areas: the CCZ (see 
Figure 6.1), equating to an area of an approximate radius of 5km from the 
Project Site; and the OCZ (see Figure 6.2), equating to an area of an 
approximate radius of 10km from the Project Site, in accordance with the Phase 
1 SoCC and as described in paragraph 6.2.15 – 6.2.19 of this Consultation 
Report. 
 During the s47 consultation phase hard copies of the 2014 PEIR, the 2014 PEIR 
NTS and the information leaflet (Appendix 3.Y.ii) were made available to the 
public to view at the following locations: 
� Bedford Library 
� Ampthill Library 
� Wootton Library 
� Bedford Borough Council 
� Central Bedfordshire Council 
� Marston Vale Forest Centre 
Phase 1 Section 47: Advertising and publicity 
 The public exhibitions, held during the statutory phase of Phase 1 consultation 
(Stage 8a of Table 5.2), were advertised to the local community via a number 
of different means. 
 Posters advertising the consultation events (Appendix 3.W.i) were sent out by 
MPL to be displayed at community venues within the CCZ prior to the 
exhibitions, for example parish council noticeboards, local shops, post offices 
and doctors' surgeries.  A list of the locations that were sent a poster by MPL is 
contained within Appendix 3.W.ii).  
 Prior to the first exhibition, a leaflet (Appendix 3.Y.ii) containing an invitation to 
attend the public exhibitions was delivered to approximately 10,500 households, 
businesses and institutions in the CCZ (see Figure 6.1), including those groups 
that are defined as "hard to reach" (e.g. the elderly, young and minority groups).  
The leaflet included information on the following:

� Whether a charge would be made for copies of any of the documents, plans 
or maps and the amount of any charge; 
� Details of how to respond to the publicity; and 
� The deadline of 16th November 2014 for receipt of those responses by MPL, 
being not less than 28 days following the date when the notice was last 
published (i.e. 12th October 2014).  
 Information was made available as part of the consultation from 13th October 
2014 onwards, to assist the consultees in responding to the consultation, 
including the 2014 PEIR and 2014 PEIR NTS at the same locations (see 
paragraph 6.4.71 for locations). 
 As confirmed earlier, this consultation material was made available at local 
libraries, CBC and BBC’s offices and the Marston Vale Forest Centre. The 
consultation materials are provided in Appendix 3.Y. The 2014 PEIR is not 
reproduced within the Appendices due to its significant size but PINS received 
a copy of the 2014 PEIR and the 2014 PEIR NTS on 7th October 2014 as part 
of the s46 notification process.  
Phase 1 Regulation 11 notification   
 Under Regulation 11 of the EIA Regulations 2009, MPL was required to send a 
copy of its s48 notice to the consultation bodies (as defined in the EIA 
Regulations 2009) and to any person notified to the applicant in accordance 
with regulation 9(1)(c) of the EIA Regulations 2009, at the same time as 
publishing its s48 notice. 
 Regulation 11 notification was sent via Royal Mail to the parties listed in 
Appendix 4.G.i on 29th September 2014, with the exception of the Secretary of 
State for Defence (c/o Fisher German) and PINS who were sent notification on 
30th September 2014.  
 The parties were sent the cover letter contained in Appendix 4.G.ii which stated 
MPL's intention to apply to the SoS for a DCO under s37 of the PA 2008. The 
letter further explained that under s48 of the PA 2008 MPL would be publishing 
a notice of the proposed applications in the London Gazette, the Independent, 
Bedfordshire on Sunday and the Bedfordshire Citizen. In line with Regulation 
11, a copy of the Phase 1 s48 Notice was enclosed with the letter and is also 
contained in Appendix 3.G.ii.   
 An acknowledgement of receipt of the Regulation 11 notification and Phase 1 
s48 notice was received from PINS by email on 1st October 2014 (Appendix 
3.G.iii).  
Consultation Report 
Millbrook Power 
 
84 
 
 Five additional parties were identified pursuant to s42(1)(a) who were 
inadvertently not included on the list of parties to receive a copy of the s48 notice 
pursuant to Regulation 11 of the EIA Regulations 2009: 
� McNicholas (KPN Networks) 
� McNicholas (TATA Networks) 
� Telent Limited 
� UK Power Networks (Operations) Limited3 
� Virgin Media Limited 
 These parties were however, included in the s42(1)(a) list and were sent the 
following s42 consultation pack on 7th October 2014:  
�  A covering letter providing an overview of the project and details of the 
consultation process (Appendix 4.G.iv); 
�  A paper copy of 2014 PEIR NTS (Appendix 3.S); 
�  A CD copy of the 2014 PEIR; and 
�  A copy of the MPL publicity leaflet, which included a freepost 
feedback/comment form. 
 MPL can confirm that these parties received this information, and some of the 
parties (or related companies) have engaged in the consultation process. For 
instance, protective provisions have been agreed with Eastern Power Networks 
plc (part of UK Power Networks Group) which are included in the MPL Draft 
Order (Document Reference 3.1). In addition, MPL subsequently issued a 
notice pursuant to Regulation 11 to the above parties on 26th February 2015.  A 
copy of the cover letter that was sent to these five parties, along with the 
Regulation 11 notice and information update are provided in Appendix 4.G.iv. 
Phase 1 Statutory Consultation: Section 47 media coverage  
 The following local media coverage (see Appendix 4.I) was received: 
� Bedford Times and Citizen (in print) - Plans on show for gas power station 
(25th September 2014)  
� Bedfordshire on Sunday - Stewartby gas fired power station plan fuels 
opposition (12th October 2014)  
                                                      
3 On the 11th October 2017 UK Power Networks informed MPL that the assets were owned and operated by 
Eastern Power Networks plc (part of UK Power Networks Group). MPL has therefore referred to Eastern Power 
Networks in the Book of Reference (Document Reference 4.3) and the MPL Draft Order (Document Reference 
3.1)

Phase 1 PINS outreach meeting 
 MPL held an outreach meeting with PINS on 26th November 2014 in order to 
discuss the DCO Application, the latest update on the Project and stakeholder 
specific issues.  
Phase 1 other key stakeholder meetings  
 MPL held a meeting with the EA on 20th January 2015 in order to discuss the 
DCO Application, the latest update on the Project and specific permitting issues. 
 MPL held further meetings with CBC, BBC and local parishes on 4th February 
2015 in order to keep them appraised of developments. 
Phase 1 information update February 2015 
 MPL considered that it would be of interest to s42 consultees and the local 
community to understand the changes that MPL made to its project as a result 
of statutory consultation. These key changes were: 
� 
Consultation zones modified; 
� 
Choice of Gas Connection corridor; 
 
 
 
Consultation Report 
Millbrook Power 
 
87 
 
� 
Location of AGI; 
� 
Revised Red Line Boundary; and  
� 
Undergrounding of the Electrical Connection cable.  
 As such, MPL issued an information update to s42 parties and to those s47 
parties that had requested to be kept informed, on 6th and 7th of February 2015 
(copies of the letters/emails are provided at Appendix 4.N.i). Copies of the 
information update were also made available on the Millbrook Power Project 
website and were sent to parish councils (in both the CCZ and OCZ), CBC and 
BBC. MPL also held a series of briefings with parish councils and both CBC and 
BBC to inform and update on its progress with the project.  
 The purpose of this information update was to provide consultees with feedback 
on the outcomes of the consultation process prior to submission of the DCO 
Application and the sending out of the information update was not a statutory or 
non-statutory consultation exercise, rather it was one of informing and updating 
in advance of submission of the DCO Application.   
Phase 1 information updates March 2015 
 An information update was issued on 20th of March 2015 to s42 parties and 
those s47 parties that requested to be kept informed about the Project which 
reported on the amendment to the Red Line Boundary that was consulted on in 
October/November 2014 and proposed amendments to the Rookery South 
(Resource Recovery Facility) Order 2011 (the ‘RRF Order’). This extension to 
the 2014 consultation Red Line Boundary is contained within the land plans 
(Document Reference 2.5) and works plans (Document Reference 2.6) and was 
necessary in order to ensure that both the Covanta RRF and the Millbrook 
Power Project can co-exist (the issues surrounding which are fully explained in 
the MPL Covanta Position Statement enclosed at Appendix 5 of the Planning 
Statement (Document Reference 10.1).  
 In essence, the same development (i.e. an up to 10m wide Access Road) was 
proposed over the area but the Red Line Boundary was expanded to allow for 
the location of that road to shift, given that final design for the Covanta RRF had 
not yet taken place. To allow flexibility to align with the Covanta RRF limits of 
deviation for its works packages, it was considered that providing for a slightly 
wider area within which the Access Road could be located would help to ensure 
that both nationally significant infrastructure projects can be constructed and 
operate as neighbours. This information update also informed consultees about 
some proposed amendments to the RRF Order (relating to the Covanta RRF 
Project) that MPL proposed to make through the draft DCO for the Project. The 
amendments that MPL proposed (and still proposes) to make are to include 
within the RRF Order protective provisions for the benefit of MPL (protective 
provisions for the benefit of Covanta are included in the draft DCO for the 
Project). More information about these proposed amendments can be found in 
Section 10 of this Consultation Report.

 Appendix 4.N.ii contains the information update letter and a plan showing the 
refinements made to the 2014 Phase 1 consultation Red Line Boundary by the 
final Red Line Boundary that was consulted on in Phase 2 consultation and 
which forms the Red Line Boundary for the DCO Application for the Project.   
 A second information update was issued by MPL on 25th March 2015 informing 
local councillors, parish councils and other local stakeholders of MPL’s decision 
to put the Project “on hold” primarily because of the then market conditions for 
new power generation in the UK. A copy of this correspondent is contained at

Summary of Phase 1 consultation Feedback 
7.1 
Introduction 
 This section explains the non-statutory and statutory consultation responses 
received during Phase 1 Consultation. MPL notes that PINS Advice Note 14 
advocates adopting differing approaches to reporting the consultation 
responses received, depending on the nature of consultation and the volume of 
responses.  
 Throughout the non-statutory and statutory phases of consultation, MPL has 
gathered feedback on the Project from consultees via correspondence, 
meetings and feedback forms. This information can be classified as primary 
data. As mentioned in section 2, MPL has sought to maximise consultee 
involvement in the consultation processes, such that the comments received 
are representative.  
 Feedback has been analysed according to the themes that are represented by 
the comments received. Where a comment covers more than one theme, this 
has been accounted for. Where relevant, the detailed content of the comments 
received is also discussed.  
 Section 11 summarises how MPL has responded to the comments, and sets 
out whether there has been a resultant change to the Project.  
 MPL has had regard to PINS Advice Note 14 in preparing this section, including 
Annex A. MPL has focussed on issues led approach to dealing with responses. 
Appendices 4.A, 4.C and 4.D group responses by issue and respond to them.

 Survey forms were provided for attendees to provide feedback about the Project 
at each exhibition (see Appendix 3.Y.iii). Out of the 250 attendees, 116 people 
returned a survey form. Figure 7.5 provides a summary of the feedback received 
from the local community consultation.  
Responses to feedback form questions 
 Figure 7.1 shows the overall response to the question ‘How do you feel about 
this outline proposal to build a gas fired power station at Rookery South Pit?’ 
 
Figure 7.1 Respondents support of the outline proposals 
 At this stage in the development process, the majority of responses were neutral 
with the remainder of responses split almost equally between supporting and 
opposing the project. Figure 7.2 shows the response by exhibition location to 
the question, 'Millbrook Power is committed to ensuring that the project will 
create jobs and wider benefits to the local community. How would you like to 
see us supporting the community?' 
Consultation Report

Figure 7.2 Respondents local community support preference 
 There was a degree of concern amongst residents that the needs of the local 
community would not be addressed. However, most respondents were in favour 
of MPL's commitment to provide support to local causes and the local 
community.  
 The majority of residents specified environmental benefits as a priority (64%) a 
further (27%) specified educational benefits and (9%) chose support for cultural 
or sporting events. A small handful of respondents specified 'other' benefits 
which were almost all based around the provision of gas for the community or a 
reduction of local electricity bills. 
 65% of those in Lidlington were in favour of local environmental benefits, whilst 
12% supported benefits for local education and 6% wanted support for cultural 
or sporting initiatives. 17% specified 'other'.  
 55% of those in Stewartby were in favour of local environmental benefits, whilst 
21% supported benefits for local education and 12% for benefits in the areas of 
culture and sport. Another 12% specified 'other'.  
 65% of those in Marston Moretaine were in favour of local environmental 
benefits, whilst 24% supported benefits for local education and 4% for culture 
and/or sport. 7% specified 'other'. 
 Figure 7.3 shows the overall response to the question:  'At an appropriate time, 
we plan to set up a Community Liaison group which will be kept informed by 
Millbrook Power of developments with this project - would you like to be a part 
of it?'.  
Consultation Report 
Millbrook Power

Figure 7.3 Community Liaison Group involvement 
 The results show that 75% of respondents indicated that they would not like to 
be considered for membership of any future Community Liaison Group and only 
25 % indicated that they would. Figure 7.4. shows how the respondents at the 
three events learnt about the exhibitions. 
 
Figure 7.4 How respondents learnt about the exhibition 
 Overall, 77% of respondents indicated that they learned about the exhibitions 
by receiving the letter circulated to households in the area. 23% of respondents 
became aware of the exhibitions through a news item in newspaper or via other 
local media such as twitter and Facebook.  
 89% of the respondents from Lidlington learnt of the exhibition by letter and 11% 
became aware of the exhibition through a news item in the local media.  
 84% of the respondents from Stewartby learnt of the exhibition by letter and 
16% became aware of the exhibition through a news item in the local media.  
Consultation Report 
Millbrook Power

 82% of the respondents from Marston Moretaine learnt of the exhibition by letter 
and 18% became aware of the exhibition through a news item in the local media. 
 Further questions asked for respondents’ comments as part of the survey, 
generally the responses to these questions have been dealt with in Appendix 
5.A. It is however worth summarising some of the more salient points which 
have either resulted in major interventions or modification to either the project 
or the engagement process. Suggestions were also made which did not result 
in any changes to the project itself but were already being addressed as part of 
the project design or requirement of the EIA process. The questions and a 
summary are reproduced below: 
a. Is there anything you would like to see done differently at the next round of 
exhibitions? 
b. Based on the information at today's event, what comments would you like 
to make about our proposal? 
c. 
What further information would you like to be made available about this 
project? 
 A number of comments were made in response to question a) relating to 
provision of more information and explanation on the Project.  The comments 
included, access to maps, additional exhibition, model of the site, better 
advertising and detail regarding stack height, noise and emissions. Additional 
information was therefore presented at the statutory consultation events, for 
example more maps and exhibition boards were made available.  Also in 
response to requests for an additional exhibition venue, MPL ran an exhibition 
at Ampthill for the statutory phase of consultation (further information is provided 
in section 7.4 of this Consultation Report).  
 Respondents also provided comments for question a) referring to underground 
cables for the Electrical Connection, and also a better idea of visual impact.    
 Predominantly the responses to question b) were concerned with impact within 
the landscape as a result of industrialisation, cumulative development and 
physical attributes of the development such as stack height, especially in 
relation to minimising stack heights, and screening of the Project.  There were 
also a number of comments about the suitability of the site, both positive 
comments and negative comments, and comparisons with the Covanta RRF 
proposals.   
 Some issues such as cumulative development and general impact within the 
landscape are assessed with in the EIA. The issue of the stack height was also 
raised in early discussion with CBC and BBC representatives and has been 
modelled from an early stage in the process.  
 Responses to question c) were received across a broad spectrum of issues 
relating to noise, gas supplies to the village, visual impact of stacks and pylons; 
and traffic.  
Consultation Report 
Millbrook Power 
 
94 
 
 A detailed table of responses to these questions as well as how MPL has taken 
the response into account can be found in Appendix 5.A. 
 Responses to each survey question have been tabulated and subsequently 
answered by MPL stating how the response has been taken into account. In 
summary the majority of responses state that for future exhibitions more project 
detail is required and supported by visual aids. Comments regarding the 
proposal vary between the impact of the stacks, site selection, need for the 
project and comparisons drawn with the Covanta RRF proposals. With regard 
to the survey question asking what further information is required responses 
state design, environmental impact and community benefit as some of the key 
areas.     
 During the exhibitions many questions were raised by attendees, which were 
broadly in line with the feedback recorded in the forms.  MPL responded to these 
questions during the exhibitions.  In addition, specific comments were raised 
regarding the location of the AGI; this led to a further meeting with the 
landowner.   
Phase 1 Key Stakeholder Consultation 
 Key stakeholders provided a range of comments on the Project during meetings 
and liaison prior to statutory consultation. A summary of the meetings which 
took place is included in Table 6.1.  Responses from MPL during the meetings 
are provided within the meeting minutes, provided in Appendix 3.F.   
 In addition, there were specific comments made by a local councillor on the 
viewpoints to be used in the LVIA methodology, following publication of the EIA 
Scoping Report.  The request largely focussed on the addition of new viewpoints 
to the methodology.    
7.3 
EIA Scoping Opinion 
 An EIA Scoping Opinion (ES Appendix 1.2, Document Reference: 6.1) was 
received from PINS on 28th July 2014 (Stage 5 of Table 5.2).   
 The EIA Scoping Opinion included a list of all consultees consulted, as required 
by Regulation 9 of the EIA Regs, and PINS's comments on the proposed 
development and the EIA approach and topic areas. 
 The EIA Scoping Opinion identified the main potential Project issues as:  
� Air Quality; 
� Noise and Vibration; 
� Ecology; 
� Water Quality and Resources; 
� Geology, Ground Conditions and Land Use; 
Consultation Report 
Millbrook Power 
 
95 
 
� Landscape and Visual; 
� Traffic and Transport; and 
� Cultural Heritage and Archaeology. 
 The SoS also noted the potential need to carry out an assessment under The 
Conservation of Habitats and Species Regulations 2010. 
 The SoS confirmed the following matters could be scoped out of the EIA: 
� Potential odour impacts; 
� Emissions to air from the gas and electrical connections; 
� Noise and vibration impacts from the gas connections; and  
� Impacts on water quality and resources of the gas and electricity 
connections. 
 The SoS noted that it is not explicitly stated in the Scoping Report whether the 
proposed electricity connection will be 132kV or 400kV, although it is indicated 
that it will connect to a 400kV network. In the event that the connection will be 
400kV the SoS did not agree that noise impacts from the electrical connections 
could be scoped out. 
 The SoS recommended that further justification be provided for the scoping out 
of the following elements: 
� Operational Noise/Impacts of the Electricity Connection; 
� Drainage/Water quality impacts of the gas and electricity connections during 
the decommissioning phases; and 
� Landscape and visual impacts on the Chilterns Area of Outstanding Natural 
Beauty. 
 The Scoping Opinion response has been considered in undertaking the EIA and 
in the production of the 2014 PEIR, the 2017 PEIR and the ES. 
7.4 
Phase 1 statutory consultation 
 A statutory consultation phase commenced on 13th October 2014 and 
concluded on 16th November 2014, a period of 35 days. This exceeded the 
minimum statutory period of 28 days by one week. 
 The statutory phase of consultation consisted of: 
� Phase 1 SoCC and 2014 Consultation Plan;  
� s47 consultation;  
Consultation Report 
Millbrook Power 
 
96 
 
� s48 publicity;  
� s42 consultation; and 
� s46 notification.  
 The Project description at the commencement of the statutory phase of 
consultation was as set out at section 6.3. 
Phase 1 Section 42 Consultation 
 The s42 responses were examined and then split into topic themes. The 
s42(1)(a); s42(1)(b) and s42(1)(d) responses received are provided in full in 
Appendix 5.B. In total there were 27 respondents who made comment on the 
application, which has been broken down into 224 individual comments.  Other 
responses acknowledged receipt of materials, or stated that the Project would 
not affect them.  These verbatim responses are still included in Appendix 5.B 
for completeness.   
 In analysing the responses, no ranking or weighting was given to the responses. 
Instead the verbatim responses were simply split into topics. The result of this 
exercise is set out in Appendix 5.D (which also contains MPL's response to each 
thematic point/issue raised). In broad terms, the s42 responses received, when 
broken down into themes produce the results shown in Figure 7.5.  
 
Figure 7.5 s42 comments – themed 
 The themes that attracted the most comments were: 
 
Consultation Report 
Millbrook Power 
 
97 
 
� Safety 
� Permits and consents 
� Air quality 
� Cultural heritage 
� Transport 
� Landscape 
 The S42 responses have been received predominantly from s42(a) parties and 
also (b) parties. A very small response has occurred from s42(d) parties. 
 As one would expect, the s42(a) consultees generally have an inbuilt bias 
towards statutory protective functions of areas of acknowledged interest; for 
example, service corridors. 
 There were a number of other general themes which emerged through the s42 
responses, related to matters which would be considered within the EIA process 
such as cumulative effect, noise, landscape and air quality assessment. 
Safety, permits and consents 
 A considerable number of comments relate to operational safety issues such as 
general safety and other consents or permits that may be required.  Issues 
raised related to operational information from a health and safety standpoint or 
for example the CAA advising what height of structure has to be advised to local 
aerodromes. On this occasion despite the fact that no tall buildings are 
proposed MPL has as a precaution contacted Cranfield aerodrome to advise 
them of the development. 
Air Quality 
 A number of responses relating to air quality were in relation to the methodology 
for the EIA, and also one comment on temperature inversions.  These 
comments were considered in the preparation of the EIA and the MPL Draft 
Order.  
Cultural Heritage 
 Responses were received from BBC, CBC and Historic England (then English 
Heritage), and predominantly related to the approach to the assessment of 
cultural heritage in the EIA. These comments were considered in the 
preparation of the DCO application documents.   
Traffic and Transport 
 CBC made comment about the permissive Public Right of Way (PRoW) that 
would be provided within the Rookery as part of the LLRS and what the 
Consultation Report 
Millbrook Power 
 
98 
 
interactions could be between this and the proposed development. As a result 
of this a further review of the Project has been undertaken in order to ensure 
that this issue can be properly addressed. 
 Stewartby Parish Council raised concerns about construction traffic being 
routed through Kempston Hardwick along Manor Road; this was due to a 
concentration of residential properties. There were a number of other comments 
made by consultees on construction traffic management measures, including 
routing and access.  
 Highways England (then Highways Agency) and BBC in their comments refer 
to the need for a Transport Assessment, and the approach to the assessment.  
Landscape  
 There were a number of comments on landscape, this included a specific 
comment by CBC on the viewpoints being used for the LVIA.  CBC requested 
that six further viewpoints were added to the LVIA in addition to those added 
during non-statutory consultation.   
 There were also comments made by CBC and BBC on the Electrical Connection 
and it was requested that the minimum number of pylons were used for the 
Project.   
 Finally, Covanta who are a s42(d) party have contacted MPL with respect to the 
juxtaposition of the interests of the two parties on the Rookery South Pit. 
Discussions are ongoing but MPL has modified their 2014 consultation Red Line 
Boundary in the location of the Access Road in the Rookery South Pit to ensure 
both projects can co-exist. The Planning Statement (Document Reference 10.1) 
provides further details on the modification of the consultation Red Line 
Boundary that was prepared in October 2014. 
 The above thematic comments are further detailed in Appendix 5.D where 
responses are made to each theme.  
Phase 1 Section 47 Consultation

exhibitions of 39%.  
 A complete record of all feedback received during the statutory s47 public 
exhibitions held in October and November 2014 with MPL’s response is 
presented in Appendix 5.F. 
Summary of Feedback 
 Questionnaires were made available to the 182 people who attended the four 
exhibitions as well as being attached as a freepost response form to the leaflet 
that was distributed to approximately 10,500 addresses in the CCZ (see Figure 
6.1). 
 The responses included 131 returned forms, 70 via freepost and 61 direct from 
exhibitions as shown in Figure 7.6. All responses have been analysed and the 
results of this are discussed below. 
Consultation Report 
Millbrook Power

Figure 7.6 Origin of responses 
 Of those responding to the survey 37% were supportive and 31% opposed. A 
further 17% were neutral and 15% undecided. This is shown at Figure 7.6.  
 
Figure 7.7 Respondents support of project proposals  
 In order to further examine the s47 responses and to differentiate between 
issues, each representation was examined in order to ascertain what issues it 
identified as important.  
 In total there were 143 responses, this comprised 131 survey responses (both 
feedback forms received in exhibitions and freepost leaflet responses) and 12 
responses via email and posted letter.  These responses were examined and 
then split into topic themes.  
Consultation Report 
Millbrook Power 
 
101 
 
 In analysing the responses, no ranking or weighting was given to the responses. 
Instead, the raw data was split into topics. The result of this exercise is set out 
in Appendix 5.F (which also contains MPL's response to each thematic 
point/issue raised). In broad terms, the s47 responses received, when broken 
down into themes produce the results shown in Figure 7.8.  
 
Figure 7.8 s47 comments – themed 
 The themes that attracted the most comment were: 
� Landscape 
� Community Benefit 
� Transport 
� Consultation issues 
� Air quality 
� Electrical connection. 
 The above are further detailed in Appendix 5.F where responses are made to 
each theme. 
 It should be noted that each response has to be considered on its own merit 
and that the number of respondents identifying an issue may not correlate 
directly to the importance of that individual area. So, for example although many 
more comments were made on landscape than air quality this does not mean 
that a lesser degree of examination was carried out of air quality issues. 
Consultation Report 
Millbrook Power 
 
102 
 
 As part of the statutory consultation process, responses under s47 are more 
focussed than non-statutory consultation reflecting the additional levels of 
information that were available at that time. 
 There were a number of themes which emerged through s47 responses. Some 
of these were general and related to matters which would be considered within 
the EIA process such as noise, landscape and air quality assessment.  
Landscape 
 There were a range of comments concerned about the visual impact of the 
Project, in terms of the pylons, stacks and more generally.  Some of those 
comments relating to the pylons refer to the use of underground cables to 
mitigate the visual impact.  
 There were a number of responses with respect to the impacts within the 
landscape and the views from Ampthill Park, and reference to the need for 
mitigation measures.  
Community Benefit 
 A number of comments referred to the fact that local residents do not have a 
mains gas connection stating that a connection could be provided to local 
residents as part of the project, or subsidised or given to elderly residents. In 
particular, Stewartby is highlighted as a village requiring a gas main. 
 There were also a number of comments stating that the project will have no 
community benefit, and the impacts of the Project being large.  
Transport 
 Specific transport issues were raised with respect to traffic impact on 
settlements and traffic management of the site with reference to the local rail 
crossing.  
 Finally, on transport issues, comments were received that there is a project 
emerging to re- link Oxford and Cambridge by rail and that this may have some 
impact on the Project. 
 As a response to this, MPL has met with the representatives of Network Rail 
and information received confirms that due to the timings of Network Rail’s 
project it would occur later than MPL and would not present any issues. 
Consultation issues 
 There were a range of comments referring to the consultation, including the 
process and materials.  Some refer to the fact that information provided was 
clear and that MPL answered questions clearly, however, others referred to 
issues with public communication and information.  For instance, a 
representative from the Friends of Marston Moretaine Station attended an 
Consultation Report 
Millbrook Power 
 
103 
 
exhibition and explained that the group were concerned that they had not been 
formally consulted; this group is engaged as a s47 party. 
Air Quality 
 Comments have been received with reference to the stack height and local 
weather conditions, one individual in particular had a detailed knowledge of the 
area and was concerned that the appropriate weather data for the area had 
been used and that MPL were aware of the fact that temperature inversions 
were a common occurrence in the Marston Vale. Additional information was 
sent to the individual by e-mail and MPL’s data was verified.  
Electrical connection 
 Site selection was commented on generally and possibility of placing the 
electrical connection cables underground, rather than overhead, was raised.  
There were also a large number of adverse comments received on the number 
of new pylons that the development may require. 
Other comments to note 
 Specific comments were made on the potential noise impact at South Pillinge 
Farm. These comments related to the noise impact and a desire to see a noise 
bund at South Pillinge Farm.   
 A number of other representations were also received which related to 
establishment of site safety procedures and emergency site access. In the case 
of the former these will be developed at the appropriate time; however, an 
emergency access route is already part of the LLRS that will be in place by the 
start of construction. 
Phase 1 Section 48 Consultation 
 MPL did not receive any consultation responses that identified themselves as 
responding specifically to s48 publicity.  MPL has therefore taken the approach 
that some s47 responses may also be s48 responses.  
7.5 
Phase 1 non-statutory consultation (carried out following the Phase 1 
statutory consultation) 
 MPL held an outreach meeting with PINS and local councillors (from CBC and 
CCZ parish councils), on 26th November 2014 in order to discuss the DCO 
Application, the latest update on the Project and stakeholder specific issues. 
One of the constant themes throughout the non-statutory and statutory 
elements of the consultation exercise and also at this meeting was the 
perceived impact of the additional electricity transmission Pylons both due to 
their presence on site and their impact on the local environment. As noted 
below, this feedback contributed to MPL’s decision to proceed with an 
underground cable in order to connect to the NETS.  
Consultation Report 
Millbrook Power 
 
104 
 
 The meeting held by MPL with CBC, BBC and local parishes on 4th February 
2015 were used to provide a general update and to impart the news regarding 
the decision to proceed on the basis of underground cables. 
 This information was also imparted when MPL issued additional information to 
s42 Parties and those s47 parties that had requested to be kept informed on 6th 
and 7th of February 2015 (Appendix 4.N.i).     
Consultation on the draft ES  
 MPL entered into a planning performance agreement with CBC in 2014. A draft 
version of the ES was sent to CBC for comment by PBA in September 2015 and 
CBC provided comments in October 2015. MPL has taken CBC’s comments 
into account in the preparation of the ES (Document Reference 6.1), specifically 
those related to noise and cultural heritage.  
7.6 
Phase 1 Summary and conclusions  
 In summary, MPL undertook a single period of statutory consultation during the 
Phase 1 consultation combining the requirements under s42, s46, s47 and s48 
of the PA 2008. The Phase 1 statutory consultation period commenced on 13th 
October 2014 and concluded on 16th November 2014, a period of 35 days. MPL 
received 27 responses from s42 consultees and the majority of these were from 
s42(a) parties. The themes that attracted the most comments from s42 
consultees included: safety, permits and consents, air quality, cultural heritage, 
transport and landscape.  
 MPL also received 131 responses from s47 consultees. Feedback from the local 
community was obtained via feedback forms made available at the public 
exhibitions (61) and freepost feedback back forms included in the leaflet 
distributed to households within the CCZ (70). The themes that attracted the 
most comments from s47 consultees included: landscape, community benefit, 
transport, consultation issues, air quality and electrical connection. 
 Section 11 explains how MPL has had regard to the consultation feedback that 
it has received. 
 MPL has had regard to all relevant consultation responses received in 
accordance with s49 of the PA 2008. The tables contained in Appendix 5.D and 
Appendix 5.F summarise all relevant s42 and s47 Phase 1 consultation 
comments and set out MPL’s response, indicating where consultation 
comments have resulted in a change to the Project or not.

Description of Phase 2 consultation (March 2017 
- October 2017) 
8.1 
Introduction  
 This section describes the non-statutory and statutory consultation activities that 
MPL undertook between March 2017 and October 2017 as part of the Phase 2 
consultation.  
 In March 2015, it was decided by the previous owners of the Project to put it “on 
hold” primarily because of the then market conditions for new power generation 
in the UK.  However, after acquisition of the Project by Drax in December 2016 
(further described in section 2.3 below) the Project was publicly “re-launched” 
in April 2017. In accordance with the PA 2008 DCLG pre-application guidance 
(paragraph 73) MPL decided to undertake a second phase of consultation after 
the Project was relaunched in 2017.  
8.2 
MPL's approach to Phase 2 Consultation 
 As was the case for the Phase 1 Consultation, MPL has carried out a variety of 
non-statutory and statutory consultation with a range of consultees. 
 Meetings have taken place with key stakeholders prior to, during and after the 
statutory Phase 2 consultation period, which ran from 29th May 2017 to 2nd July 
2017. Meetings held during the Phase 2 consultation period have generally 
been focused on those with CBC, BBC and the local Parish Councils. Other 
statutory stakeholders have been liaised with via telephone and email 
correspondence. 
8.3 
Phase 2 non-statutory consultation (March 2017 – May 2017) 
Non-statutory consultation carried out prior to the Phase 2 statutory 
consultation 
 The focus of the Phase 2 non-statutory consultation was to inform those who 
were not involved with Phase 1 consultation about the Project and to update 
those who were previously consulted during the Phase 1 consultation on the 
changes to the Project, as well as to explain why the Project was now 
progressing again towards submission of a DCO application and to ask for 
feedback from consultees on the Project.  
 MPL undertook informal non-statutory consultation with a range of stakeholders 
prior to the commencement of the Phase 2 statutory consultation period, 
including:  
� Refreshing the Regulation 9 consultation list;  
� Meetings with key stakeholders including PINS, regulatory agencies, local 
authorities and parish councils in the CCZ (see Figure 6.1); 
Consultation Report 
Millbrook Power

� Informing (via email) the local MP, prospective parliamentary candidates, 
parish councils in the OCZ and hard to reach groups; and    
� Updating the MPL website (www.millbrookpower.co.uk) to advise that further 
consultation would be taking place in 2017. 
Phase 2 Regulation 9 list refresh 
 The Regulation 9 list provided by PINS in 2014 in respect of the Phase 1 
consultation was refreshed and updated in dialogue with PINS and the 
consultation bodies listed. Where there were named contacts, those contacts 
were issued an email on 4th May 2017 to enquire whether the contact details 
(including postal address) remained accurate and appropriate for the issuing of 
Project statutory consultation material. Those who did not respond by 9th May 
2017 were removed as named contacts and registered addresses were used 
for the purposes of the statutory consultation element of Phase 2 Consultation. 
Phase 2 Key Stakeholder Consultation  
 Non-statutory consultation undertaken with key stakeholders in the lead up to 
the statutory consultation period commenced in March 2017. Meetings were 
held with PINS, regulatory agencies, local authorities and parish councils.  
 MPL engaged with PINS, providing information regarding the re-start of the MPL 
Project, as well as attending a meeting with PINS on 30th March 2017 to discuss 
matters including consultation, EIA (including scoping requirements) and 
preparation of the DCO Application (Appendix 3.H.iii). Table 8.1 below 
summarises the meetings that MPL held prior to the commencement of the 
statutory consultation period.

Phase 2 EIA Scoping Consultation 
 MPL met with PINS on 30th March 2017 to discuss various matters relating to 
the Project, including the validity of the 2014 EIA Scoping Opinion. 
 PINS confirmed that it was not necessary to revisit the 2014 EIA Scoping 
Report/Opinion and that the Scoping Opinion remained valid for the purposes 
of the EIA for the Project. In accordance with the transitional arrangements at 
Consultation Report 
Millbrook Power 
 
108 
 
Regulation 37 of the EIA Regulations 2017, the Project has continued to be 
assessed under the regime of the EIA Regulations 2009. 
8.5 
Phase 2 Statutory Consultation (May 2017 – July 2017) 
 Following the period of non-statutory consultation described above, MPL 
undertook a series of activities in accordance with the statutory consultation 
requirements of the PA 2008. Each element of the statutory consultation 
undertaken fulfilled a particular requirement of the PA 2008 and was undertaken 
following the structure provided in Figure 5.1. These strands of consultation are 
explained in more detail in the following section.  
Phase 2 Project description 
 The description of the Project provided for the Phase 2 statutory consultation 
(as outlined in the 2017 PEIR) was as follows: 
� A new Power Generation Plant in the form of an Open Cycle Gas Turbine 
peaking power generating station, fuelled by natural gas with a rated 
electrical output of between 50 and 299 MW. This is the output of the 
generating station as a whole, measured at the point of export into the 
National Grid Electricity Transmission System (NETS). The Power 
Generation Plant comprises: 
- generating equipment including one Gas Turbine Generator with one 
exhaust gas flue stack and Balance of Plant, which are located within the 
‘Generating Equipment Site’; 
- a new purpose built access road to the Generating Equipment Site; 
- a temporary construction compound required during construction only; 
� A new underground gas pipeline connection to bring natural gas to the 
Generating Equipment from the National Transmission System. This 
element incorporates an Above Ground Installation at the point of connection 
to the National Transmission System; and 
� A new electrical connection to export power from the Generating Equipment 
to the NETS, delivered in one of two ways although both options comprise 
underground cables and one replacement transmission tower. 
 Further details of both Electrical Connection options were provided in Section 5 
of the s42 cover letter (Appendix 3.Q) and Section 2.5 of the PEIR NTS. It was 
explained that the Electrical Connection would cover an area of approximately 
4.8 ha no matter which option was used. 
Phase 2 Section 47 SoCC consultation and publication 
 As acknowledged in paragraph 6.4.41, s47(1) of the PA 2008 requires that 
applicants prepare a statement setting out how they proposed to consult local 
people in consultation with the local authority(ies).  
Consultation Report 
Millbrook Power 
 
109 
 
 In preparing the draft Phase 2 SoCC and 2017 Consultation Plan for the Phase 
2 consultation (Appendix 2.E), MPL had regard to the consultation feedback 
received from CBC and BBC on the Phase 1 SoCC (Appendix 2.B).    
 Pursuant to s47(2) of the PA 2008 the draft 2017 Consultation Plan, together 
with the draft Phase 2 SoCC and Phase 2 SoCC Notice were sent to CBC and 
BBC for statutory consultation on 6th April 2017 (cover letters provided at 
Appendix 2.C.i and Appendix 2.C.ii). 
 The cover letter accompanying the documents explained that in accordance 
with s47(2) of the PA 2008, MPL must consult the Councils about the content 
of the Phase 2 SoCC and that MPL therefore requested that the Councils 
provide comments on the draft Phase 2 SoCC and 2017 Consultation Plan 
within 28 days from the day after receipt of the draft Phase 2 SoCC. 
 The CBC response was received on 3rd May 2017 (i.e. 26 days into the 
consultation period) (Appendix 2.C.iv). In its response, CBC confirmed that it 
had reviewed the draft Phase 2 SoCC and had no further comments to make. 
The CBC letter stated that: ‘the submitted document appears to outline a 
thorough consultation process to be undertaken prior to the DCO being 
submitted at the end of the year’.  
 The BBC response was received on 2nd May 2017 (i.e. 25 days into the 
consultation period) (Appendix 2.C.v). In its response, BBC made a 
recommendation that paper copies of consultation documents should be made 
available for public viewing in the Bedford Council’s Customer Service Centre 
located at 2 Horne Lane, Bedford, MK40 1RA instead of BBC main office.  
 In respect of the content of the draft 2017 Consultation Plan itself, BBC’s letter 
confirmed that the ‘draft plan is comprehensive and demonstrates the intention 
for a significant level of public consultation and involvement to at least the level 
specified in the council’s Statement of Community Involvement’. 
 Following the receipt of comments from CBC and BBC, minor amendments 
were made to the Phase 2 SoCC to include Bedford Council’s Customer Service 
Centre as a location where consultation documents would be available for public 
viewing, and to amend the Red Line Boundary to the revised version on the 
figures showing the CCZ (see Figure 8.1) and OCZ (see Figure 8.2) although 
this did not change the parishes included within the CCZ and OCZ.  
The CCZ and OCZ 
 The Phase 2 SoCC explained that MPL would carry out consultation with the 
local community in two areas: a CCZ that equates to a 5 km radius from the 
Power Generation Plant Site (Figure 8.1) and an OCZ that equates to a radius 
of 10 km (Figure 8.2).  
 The consultation zones were adopted for both non-statutory and statutory 
Phase 2 consultation activities. MPL focused its primary consultation activities 
(for example leaflet distribution) within the CCZ (see Figure 8.1) and carried out 
Consultation Report 
Millbrook Power 
 
110 
 
less intensive consultation activities (for example media coverage and email 
correspondence with parish councils) across a wider area, the OCZ.  
 The distances from the Power Generation Plant Site remained as per the Phase 
1 consultation CCZ and OCZ at 5 km and 10 km respectively, since no further 
comments were received on the proposed CCZ and OCZ in the draft SoCC. 
However, the OCZ (see Figure 8.2) and CCZ (see Figure 8.1) boundaries differ 
slightly due to the different Project Site boundaries used at each phase of 
consultation. The CCZ includes the following parish council areas: 
� Wootton; 
� Stewartby; 
� Houghton Conquest; 
� Ampthill; 
� Maulden; 
� Millbrook; 
� Lidlington; and 
� Marston Moretaine.

Phase 2 Section 46 notification 
 On behalf of the SoS, PINS received the following information on 23rd May 2017 
(despatched 22nd May 2017 for next day delivery) prior to the commencement 
of the s42 consultation and in accordance with s46 of the PA 2008: 
� A covering letter (Appendix 3.M.i); 
� A hard copy of the Project Overview Document (Appendix 3.T.ii); 
� A hard copy of the Consultation Leaflet; 
� A CD containing electronic version of the 2017 PEIR, 2017 PEIR NTS, 2017 
PEIR Appendices, 2017 PEIR Figures and Project Overview Document; and  
� A hard copy of the 2017 PEIR NTS.  
 An acknowledgement of receipt was received via email from PINS on 23rd May 
2017 (Appendix 3.M.ii). 
Phase 2 Section 42 Consultation 
 Paragraph 6.4.5 to 6.4.6 remain applicable in respect of the Phase 2 
Consultation. 
 Pursuant to s45, statutory consultation under s42 must be a minimum of 28 days 
from the day after the consultee receives the consultation documents. However, 
as with the Phase 1 statutory consultation period, and in order to provide a 
slightly longer consultation window, MPL's statutory consultation period for the 
Phase 2 consultation commenced on 29th May 2017 and concluded on 2nd July 
2017; allowing a period of 35 days.  
Consultation under Section 42(1)(a): prescribed persons 
 Paragraph 6.4.8 to 6.4.11 remain applicable in respect of the Phase 2 
Consultation. 
 The list of prescribed persons consulted under s42(1)(a) of the PA 2008, as part 
of Phase 2 Consultation, is contained in Appendix 3.O. 
 The relevant Parish Councils under s42(1)(a) are: 
Consultation Report 
Millbrook Power 
 
115 
 
� Stewartby Parish Council; 
� Marston Moretaine Parish Council; 
� Ampthill Town Council; 
� Millbrook Parish Meeting; and 
� Houghton Conquest Parish Council. 
 Although the following Parish Councils are not prescribed consultees under s42 
of the PA 2008, MPL delivered materials to and invited these additional Parish 
Councils to actively participate in the consultation process.  This was due to 
their close proximity to the Project Site: 
� Wootton Parish Council; 
� Lidlington Parish Council; and 
� Maulden Parish Council. 
Consultation under Section 42(1)(b): local authorities 
 The Project lies within both CBC and BBC administrative boundaries. As set out 
in paragraphs 6.4.15 and 6.4.16, pursuant to s42(1)(b) the Local Authorities 
falling within s43 that needed to be consulted by MPL included CBC and BBC 
which are both ‘B’ authorities for the purpose of s43(2) of the PA 2008. MPL 
also consulted the local authorities located adjacent to CBC and BBC listed in 
paragraph 6.4.17 (‘A’ authorities for the purpose of s43(2) of the PA 2008) in 
addition to BBC and CBC under s42 of the PA 2008. 
Consultation under Section 42(1)(d): s44 persons with an interest in the land 
 A definition of s42(1)(d) parties is outlined in paragraph 6.4.19. 
 As part of the Phase 2 consultation process, consultees with interest in the land 
to which the Project relates were identified by MPL by undertaking diligent 
inquiries. Initially, plans were submitted to the Land Registry to identify all 
registered titles. These were then examined to further identify all interests noted 
against the title in each case.  
 Further information from each landowner was sought directly by requesting that 
they complete a full enquiry form for each parcel of land - stipulating the freehold 
/ leasehold interests, the occupiers if any, and other rights on / over the land 
whether registered or not. 
 Further site visits were undertaken prior to the Application submission on 10th 
September and 13th October to reconfirm all boundaries.

Phase 2 Section 42 consultation 
 The full list of s42 parties consulted during Phase 2 pursuant to s42(1)(a); 
s42(1)(b) and s42(1)(d) is included as Appendix 3.O. MPL has allocated each 
s42 consultee a unique reference in order to protect the identity of s42(d) 
individuals land interests.     
 The s42 consultation information that was sent out to each consultee 
comprised: 
� A covering letter providing an overview of the Phase 2 statutory consultation 
(Appendix 3.R.i); 
� A paper copy of the 2017 PEIR NTS (Appendix 3.T.i); 
� A paper copy of the Project Overview Document (Appendix 3.T.ii); 
� A CD containing electronic version of the 2017 PEIR, 2017 PEIR NTS, 2017 
PEIR Appendices, 2017 PEIR Figures and Project Overview Document; and  
� A paper copy of the consultation leaflet (Appendix 3.Z.iii). 
 The s42 materials were delivered in a range of formats, depending on the type 
of consultee, as described below. 
 With the exception of Natural England and Bedford Hospital NHS Trust South 
Wing (explained in the paragraph below), all consultees received a CD 
containing the 2017 PEIR and Project Overview Document and a hard copy of 
the 2017 PEIR NTS, Project Overview Document and consultation leaflet, as it 
was considered that not all consultees may have access to the internet or a 
computer to insert the CD in order to access these key documents.  
 Natural England received an electronic copy of the s42 documentation via 
email. Natural England previously informed MPL of its preference to receive 
consultation information in electronic format and an email address rather than a 
postal address was provided in the Regulation 9 list issued by PINS. Links were 
provided to the MPL website in order for Natural England to download the 
remaining s42 documents. 
 All hard copy s42 consultation packs (containing the CD, Project Overview 
Document and 2017 PEIR NTS) were sent by Royal Mail First Class Recorded 
Delivery; this allowed for proof of delivery.  
Proof of Delivery 
 The majority of s42 consultation packs were dispatched on 22nd May 2017, in 
advance of the start of the consultation period and Royal Mail’s online tracking 
system was used to monitor delivery. Online tracking records indicate that the 
majority of packages dispatched by Royal Mail Special Delivery were received 
prior to the start of the Phase 2 statutory consultation period (29th May 2017). 
However, proof of receipt was received by 31st May 2017 for all consultees 
Consultation Report 
Millbrook Power 
 
117 
 
ensuring that each consultee had more than 28 days to respond to the Phase 2 
statutory consultation.  
 Where proof of receipt was not confirmed by 29th May 2017 this was because 
s42 consultation packs had to be re-issued to alterative addresses. The 
approach taken by PBA is described below: 
 PBA were unable to obtain proof of delivery for the original s42 pack sent to 
Bedford Hospital NHS Trust South Wing. Following further investigation, it was 
possible to obtain a named contact and, following discussion with the Bedford 
Hospital NHS Trust South Wing it was agreed to re-issue issue the information 
electronically via email. The s42 information was emailed directly to them on 
31st May 2017, with confirmation of receipt received the same day, thereby 
exceeding the minimum 28-day consultation period. 
 PBA were also unable to proof of delivery for the original s42 packs sent to four 
s42d consultees (land interests). As such, additional packs were delivered by 
hand to either the original or alternative addresses on 31st May 2017 as follows:  
� Ref: S42-111: Moreteyne House, Station Lane, Millbrook, Bedford, MK45 
2JH. 
� Ref: S42-112:  11 Woodley Headland, Peartree Bridge, Milton Keynes, MK6 
3PA

2JJ  
� Ref: S42-136: Park Farm House, Hazelwood Lane, Ampthill, Bedford, MK45 
2HF 
 Proof of delivery to each of the consultees referenced above was received by 
31st May 2017 and the enclosed s42 covering letters (Appendix 3.R.i) stated 
that the closing date for the receipt of consultation comments was the 2nd July 
2017, thereby exceeding the minimum 28-day consultation period.  
 Subsequent to the commencement of the Phase 2 statutory consultation a 
number of consultees were identified which required consulting under s42 PA 
2008. Where consultation packages were not received in time to provide 
consultees with at least 28-days to respond during the Phase 2 statutory 
consultation period (29th May – 2nd July 2017) the relevant consultees were 
given their own consultation period.  This approach is described in the following 
paragraphs.  
 On 5th June 2017 HSBC was identified as a result of ongoing diligent enquiry as 
requiring notification under s42(1)(d). The s42 consultation information was 
immediately issued to HSBC’s registered office (8 Canada Square, London, E14 
5HQ) on Monday 5th June via same-day courier. However, this package was 
refused and MPL were provided with an alternative address to which HSBC 
requested the package to be sent (Securities Processing Centre, HSBC Bank 
Consultation Report 
Millbrook Power 
 
118 
 
Plc, Binley, Harry Weston Road, Coventry, CV3 2SH). The s42 consultation 
pack was duly sent to this address via Royal Mail First Class Recorded Delivery 
on 5th June 2017 and proof of delivery was received on 6th June 2017. The s42 
covering letter sent to HSBC stated that the closing date for the receipt of 
consultation comments was the 4th July 2017, thereby providing 28 days to 
respond to the consultation (see Appendix 3.R.ii).  
 On 9th August 2017 it emerged that PHE and Northern Gas Networks Limited 
(NGN) had inadvertently not been sent s42 consultation and Regulation 11 
notification materials in May 2017. The s42 consultation and Regulation 11 
information was immediately sent to PHE via email on 9th August 2017 and 
proof of delivery was received on 10th August 2017 (Appendix 3.R.iii). A PHE 
representative previously requested for an electronic copy of the s42 
consultation information to be sent to PHE via email during a telephone inquiry. 
PHE requested additional time to respond to the consultation and MPL duly 
extended their consultation deadline to 22nd September 2017 thereby providing 
PHE with 43 days to respond to the consultation. PHE provided a formal 
consultation response on 19th September 2017 (Appendix 5.C). 
 The s42 consultation and Regulation 11 information was sent to NGN via Royal 
Mail First Class Recorded Delivery on 9th August 2017 and proof of delivery 
was received on 11th August 2017. The cover letter enclosed with s42 
information packs received by PHE and NGN asked the parties to provide 
consultation comments by 15th September 2017 (see Appendix 3.R.iii and 
Appendix 3.R.iv). On 12th September 2017 PBA made a telephone inquiry to 
confirm if NGN intended to submit a formal consultation response and during 
this conversation NGN also requested additional time to respond to the 
consultation. MPL duly extended their consultation deadline to 22nd September 
2017 thereby providing NGN with 43 days to respond to the consultation 
however NGN did not provide a consultation response.  
 As such, MPL considers that neither PHE or NGN have been prejudiced by this 
inadvertent omission to send the Regulation 11 and s42 consultation materials 
until August 2017.  
 On 16th August 2017, as a result of ongoing diligent inquiry, Rutland & Partners 
LLP (a new mortgagee) and consultee s42-162 (a potential occupier of land due 
to use for stabling horses) were both identified as having an interest in the land. 
As a result, these parties have been added to the s42(1)(d) list for robustness.  
 The s42 consultation information was sent to Rutland & Partners LLP and 
consultee s42-162 via Royal Mail First Class Recorded Delivery on 16th August 
2017. Proof of delivery to Rutland & Partners LLP was received on 17th August 
2017. The enclosed s42 covering letter stated that the closing date for the 
receipt of consultation comments was the 22nd September 2017 thereby 
providing 36 days to respond to the consultation (see Appendix 3.R.v). 
Following further enquiries, it emerged on 19th September 2017 that Rutland & 
Partners LLP no longer have a financial interest in the land as they are no longer 
the registered mortgagee for the Millbrook Proving Ground.

 Proof of delivery could not be attained for the first s42 consultation pack sent to 
consultee s42-162 and so a second s42 consultation pack was sent to an 
alternative address via Royal Mail First Class Recorded Delivery on 18th August 
2017. Proof of delivery to consultee s42-162 was received on 19th August 2017. 
The enclosed s42 covering letter stated that the closing date for the receipt of 
consultation comments was the 22nd September 2017, thereby providing 34 
days to respond to the consultation (see Appendix 3.R.vi). A consultation 
response was received from consultee s42-162 on 22nd September 2017 stating 
that they would need to maintain access to their land over the lifetime of the 
Project (Appendix 5.C).  
 As such, MPL does not consider that either Rutland Partners LLP and consultee 
s42-162 have been prejudiced by receiving the s42 consultation materials in 
August 2017 (Appendix 5.C and Appendix 5.E). 
 The following consultees requested additional time beyond the consultation 
deadline stipulated (2nd July 2017) in order to prepare full responses to the s42 
consultation: 
� Natural England; and 
� Anglian Water Services Ltd. 
 Whilst both consultees acknowledged that they had received the s42 packs in 
the timescales outlined above, MPL extended the consultation period for these 
consultees until 10th July 2017. Responses were received from Natural England 
and Anglian Water Services on 6th July 2017 and 10th July 2017 respectively. 
 MPL considers that all those consultees noted in this section have not been 
prejudiced as a result of the approach to consultation undertaken by MPL. 
Consultees received the same documentation as those responding during the 
statutory consultation period (29th May – 2nd July 2017). MPL has had regard to 
all consultation comments including those received during and following the 
statutory consultation period in the preparation of the EIA and the MPL Draft 
Order. Further detail on how MPL has had regard to consultation responses is 
included in Section 11, and Appendices 5.D, 5.E, 5.F and 5.G.    
Phase 2 Section 47 Consultation 
 MPL undertook statutory s47 consultation with the local community and key 
stakeholders in accordance with the published Phase 2 SoCC. Four public 
exhibitions were held on 9th, 10th, 12th and 13th June 2017 in Marston 
Moreteaine, Stewartby, Ampthill and Lidlington. The Phase 2 SoCC Compliance 
Checklist (Appendix 4.D) demonstrates how MPL undertook statutory s47 
consultation in accordance with the published Phase 2 SoCC (Appendix 2.E). 
 The statutory s47 consultation phase commenced on 29th May 2017 and closed 
on 2nd July 2017, representing a period of 35 days, thereby exceeding the 
statutory 28-day minimum requirement.

 MPL issued an information leaflet (see Appendix 3.Z.iii) to residents within the 
CCZ (see figure 8.1) between the 23rd and 26th May 2017. The leaflet 
contained details of the Phase 2 consultation and information on the changes 
to the Project since the Phase 1 consultation in 2014. The CCZ equated to an 
approximate 5 km radius from the site of the Power Generation Plant and is 
shown in Figure 8.1. The designation of the CCZ is described in further detail in 
paragraphs 8.5.12 to 8.5.14.  
 The leaflet provided details of the forthcoming public exhibitions along with how 
and when to provide responses to the Phase 2 statutory consultation, and where 
consultation materials would be made available to view during the statutory 
consultation period. 
 The aim of the s47 consultation was to seek the views of the local community 
and key stakeholders on the following:   
� the layout of the Generating Equipment within the Generating Equipment 
Site; 
� the Project as a whole, including changes since the 2014/15 Phase 1 
Consultation; 
� the interaction between the Project and the Rookery South RRF Project; and 
� the findings of the preliminary assessment on the likely significant 
environmental effects of the Project during construction and operation, as 
set out in the 2017 PEIR. 
 However, the local community and key stakeholders were not asked to 
comment on other elements of the Project, such as the technology choice for 
the Power Generation Plant or the Project Site location. As set out in the 
Planning Statement (Document Reference 10.1) this is because the need for 
the Project is established in National Policy Statements EN-1, EN-2, EN-4 and 
EN-5.  
 This Phase of Consultation provided a mechanism for the local community and 
key stakeholders to influence certain aspects of the Project, such as:  
� Layout of the Generating Equipment within the Generating Equipment Site; 
� Electrical Connections Options 1 and 2; and 
� Community benefits.   
 During the Phase 2 statutory consultation hard copies of the 2017 PEIR, the 
2017 PEIR NTS, 2017 PEIR Figures, Project Overview Document, information 
leaflet and an electronic copy of the 2017 PEIR Appendices were made 
available to the public to view at the following locations:

� Bedford Library; 
� Ampthill Library; 
� Wootton Library; 
� Bedford Borough Council Customer Service Centre; 
� Central Bedfordshire Council; and  
� Marston Vale Forest Centre.   
 Addresses, opening hours and dates that the materials were available were 
published in the Phase 2 SoCC (Appendix 2.E). Printed copies of the 2017 PEIR 
Appendices were available for the public to view at the public exhibitions (as 
listed in Table 8.5).  
Phase 2 Section 47: Advertising and publicity  
 Four public exhibitions were held on 9th, 10th, 12th and 13th June 2017 in Marston 
Moretaine, Stewartby, Ampthill and Lidlington, as detailed in Table 8.5 below. 
These exhibitions were publicised in advance as detailed below.   
 Posters advertising the consultation events (Appendix 3.X.i) were sent out by 
MPL to be displayed at community venues within the CCZ (see figure 8.1) prior 
to the exhibitions, for example parish council noticeboards, local shops, post 
offices and doctors' surgeries. A list of the locations that were sent posters by 
MPL is contained in Appendix 3.X.ii. 
 As set out in paragraph 8.5.56, an information leaflet (Appendix 3.Z.iii) 
containing an invitation to attend the public exhibitions was delivered to 
approximately 13,000 households, businesses and institutions in the CCZ, 
including those groups that are defined as "hard to reach" (e.g. the elderly, 
young and minority groups). The leaflet included information on the following:    
� The Project; 
� Planning & Public Consultation;  
� Why Rookery South Pit?  
� Community Benefits;  
� Environment;  
� Your views; 
� Locations of where more information is available; 
� Dates and locations of exhibitions in the local area; 
Consultation Report 
Millbrook Power 
 
122 
 
� Information on how to get in touch with MPL; and  
� A freepost response form to allow comments about the project to be made. 
 Community representatives and hard to reach groups in the OCZ were 
contacted on 18th May 2017 via email. A copy of the email is contained at 
Appendix 4.B.vii and the email distribution list is contained at Appendix 4.B.viii.  
 During the exhibitions, MPL received and responded to comments on the 
proposed Project and its impact on the environment, local communities and the 
local economy. The responses generated by this phase of consultation are 
summarised in section 9 of this Consultation Report.    
Phase 2 Section 47: Exhibition newspaper adverts  
 MPL published additional adverts in local papers reminding the local community 
of the dates of the public exhibitions. These adverts are set out in Table 8.4, 
and included in Appendix 4.B.

were made available (see Appendix 3.Z.iii) including information on: 
� the Power Generation Plant; 
� Who MPL is; 
� The need for gas generation; 
� Why Rookery South Pit; 
� Community benefits; 
� The environment; 
� Planning and consultation; and 
� Key project milestones. 
 In total 157 people attended the exhibitions. Attendees were asked to complete 
a feedback form for return on the day or at later date via free-post (see Appendix 
3.Z.iv). The summary of feedback received can be found in section 9 of this 
Consultation Report. 
 Table 8.6 refers to the meetings held with key stakeholders between May 2017 
and July 2017. The primary intention of the meetings was to update key 
stakeholders on the Project, changes made since the Phase 1 consultation and 
to gain further feedback and discuss issues raised during previous engagement. 
 MPL also responded to individual queries and information requests from 
consultees via email, letter and phone call.

� The deadline of 2nd July 2017 for receipt of responses by MPL, being not 
less than 28 days following the date when the notice was last published 
(i.e.29th May 2017). 
Phase 2 Regulation 11 notification 
 Under Regulation 11 of the EIA Regulations 2009, MPL was required to send a 
copy of its Phase 2 s48 notice to the consultation bodies (as defined in the EIA 
Regulations 2009) and to any person notified to the applicant in accordance 
with regulation 9(1)(c) of the EIA Regulations 2009, at the same time as 
publishing its Phase 2 s48 notice.  
 Regulation 11 notification was sent via Royal Mail Special Delivery to allow for 
proof of delivery to all parties listed in Appendix 4.H.i between 16th May 2017 
and 22nd May 2017 except for PHE and NGN (see below). 
 All the parties were sent the cover letter contained in Appendix 4.H.ii which 
stated MPL's intention to apply to the SoS for a DCO under s37 of the PA 2008. 
The letter further explained that under s48 of the PA 2008 MPL would be 
publishing a notice of the proposed applications in the London Gazette, The 
Times, Bedfordshire on Sunday and the Bedfordshire Citizen. In line with 
Regulation 11, a copy of the s48 Notice was enclosed with the letter and is also 
contained in Appendix 4.F.   
 MPL received confirmation from Royal Mail that all parties (listed in Appendix 
4.H.i) received the Regulation 11 notification information except for those 
explained in paras.8.5.5 – 8.5.8.  
Consultation Report 
Millbrook Power 
 
127 
 
 The s48 notice was published between 18th May 2017 and 28th May in 2017 as 
described in paragraph 8.5.76 to 8.5.75.  
 As noted in paragraph 8.5.44, Regulation 11 notification was inadvertently not 
sent between 16th May 2017 and 22nd May 2017 to PHE and NGN. On 9th 
August 2017 it emerged that PHE and NGN had inadvertently not been sent a 
Regulation 11 notification. As such, PHE and NGN were both sent Regulation 
11 notification on 9th August 2017.  
 NGN were sent notification via Royal Mail Special Delivery whilst PHE was sent 
notification via email at their request. MPL received confirmation from Royal 
Mail that NGN received the Regulation 11 notification information (see Appendix 
4.H.iii). PHE confirmed receipt via email on 10th August 2017. 
 Whilst the Regulation 11 notification was, in the case of PHE and NGN not 
received at the same time as the s48 notice was published, MPL does not 
consider that this resulted in prejudice to these parties. These parties were 
contacted several times during the consultation period; PHE subsequently 
submitted a consultation response (see Appendix 5.C), and although NGN did 
not submit a consultation response, it is understood by the Applicant following 
telephone conversations that they are not affected by the Project.  
8.6 
Phase 2 non-statutory consultation (July 2017 – October 2017) (following 
Phase 2 statutory consultation)  
 A number of additional non-statutory consultation activities were undertaken by 
MPL following the statutory phase of Phase 2 consultation (July 2017 – October 
2017). 
 Following the receipt of Phase 2 statutory consultation responses, MPL held 
meetings, and corresponded via telephone and email, with statutory 
stakeholders that had raised issues relating to the methodology for undertaking 
the EIA. Key meeting and correspondence are detailed in Table 8.7.

(Document reference 5.4) including the design of the proposed drainage 
strategy and the FRA method and assumptions. 
 MPL attended a meeting with Covanta and Veolia on 18th July 2017 to discuss 
the future management of the interrelationship with the Rookery South RRF 
Project. At this meeting the drafting of protective provisions for the benefit of 
MPL and reciprocal protective provisions for the benefit of Covanta were 
discussed. The principal of a Statement of Common Ground and Interface 
Agreement were also discussed.  
 MPL attended a meeting with the Forest of Marston Vale on 25th July 2017 to 
discuss the proposed mitigation planting strategy and indicative plant layout and 
provide an update on the programme up to submission of the DCO application.  
 MPL attended a meeting with CBC Planning Officers on 10th August 2017 to

 MPL corresponded with other statutory consultees to discuss and, as far as 
possible, address any comments raised during the Phase 2 statutory 
consultation. MPL contacted those in particular where comments pertained to 
EIA methodology, and where it was felt important that approach to the final EIA 
was discussed ahead of submission of the DCO Application.

Summary of Phase 2 Consultation Feedback  
9.1 
Introduction  
 This section explains the non-statutory and statutory consultation responses 
received during the Phase 2 Consultation.  
 Throughout the non-statutory and statutory Phase 2 Consultation, MPL has 
gathered feedback on the Project from consultees via correspondence, 
meetings and feedback forms. As mentioned in section 2, MPL has sought to 
maximise consultee involvement in the consultation processes, such that the 
comments received are representative.  
 For consistency, feedback received from the Phase 2 consultation has been 
analysed according to the themes used in the analysis of the Phase 1 
consultation responses since the Phase 2 consultation did not raise any new 
themes. Again, where a comment covers more than one theme, this has been 
accounted for. The detailed content of the comments received is discussed in 
this section where relevant.  
 Section 11 of this Consultation Report summarises how comments received 
during Phase 1 and Phase 2 of the consultation have resulted in changes to the 
Project.  
 The approach taken in reporting on consultation feedback is considered to be 
consistent with PINS Advice Note 14 which advocates adopting differing 
approaches to reporting the consultation responses, depending on the nature 
of consultation and the volume of responses. MPL has adopted an issue-led 
approach to analysing responses. Appendices 5.E and 5.G respectively group 
the s42 and s47 responses received during the Phase 2 statutory consultation 
and set out MPL’s response.    
9.2 
Phase 2 non-statutory consultation feedback 
Key stakeholder consultation   
 MPL held a series of meetings with CBC, BBC and Parish Councils before the 
Phase 2 statutory consultation commenced. A summary of the meetings which 
took place is provided in Table 8.1 and MPL’s response to the feedback 
received at these meetings is summarised in the meeting minutes provided at 
Appendix 4.O.

 Phase 2 statutory consultation feedback 
 The Phase 2 period of statutory consultation commenced on 29th May 2017 and 
concluded on 2nd July 2017, a period of 35 days. This exceeded the minimum 
statutory period of 28 days by one week. 
 The statutory phase of consultation consisted of:

� Phase 2 SoCC and 2017 Consultation Plan; 
� s47 consultation; 
� s48 publicity; 
� s42 consultation; and 
� s46 notification. 
 The Project description at the commencement of the statutory phase of Phase 
2 consultation, as set out in the 2017 PEIR, is included at section 8.3 of this 
Consultation Report.  
Phase 2 Section 42 consultation 
 MPL sent out s42 consultation information packs to 158 consultees and 
received 31 responses, equivalent to a response rate of approximately 20%. 
The s42(1)(a); s42(1)(b) and s42(1)(d) responses received are provided in full 
in Appendix 5.C. The s42 responses were received predominantly from s42(a) 
parties as well as a number of s42(b) parties. Only one response was received 
from a s42(d) party.  
 The s42 responses were examined and analysed by topic theme in order to 
identify the key issues arising from the s42 consultation (Appendix 5.C). The 31 
responses have been broken down into 158 individual comments. Other 
responses acknowledged receipt of materials, or stated that the Project would 
not affect them. These verbatim responses are also included in Appendix 5.C 
for completeness. 
 In analysing the responses, no ranking or weighting was given to the responses. 
Instead the verbatim responses were simply split into themes. The result of this 
exercise is set out in Appendix 5.E (which also contains MPL's response to each 
thematic point/issue raised). In broad terms, the s42 responses received, when 
broken down into themes produce the results shown in Figure 9.1.

Figure 9.1 Phase 2 s42 – themed comments 
 The themes that attracted the most comments were: 
� Transport (22); 
� Water (21); 
� Landscape (17); 
� Electrical connection (15); 
� Gas connection (15); 
� Air quality (13); and  
� Cultural heritage and archaeology (12).  
 A considerable number of responses were received from s42(a) parties 
regarding safeguarding respondent’s assets through the inclusion of protective 
provision in the draft DCO. MPL also received a significant number of comments 
advising on permits and consents that may be required for the Project if the 
DCO is granted.  
 A number of general themes emerged from the s42 responses including 
cumulative effect, noise, landscape and air quality which are all considered 
within the EIA process.

Transport 
 Responses in respect of transport and highway safety were received from by 
BBC, CBC, Network Rail Infrastructure Ltd, Buckinghamshire County Council 
and Royal Mail Group. 
 The response from Network Rail Infrastructure came from their Manchester 
team, whilst MPL has historically liaised with Network Rail's Birmingham team. 
Various issues raised in the response (e.g. potential impacts on the level 
crossing) have been addressed previously with the Network Rail Birmingham 
team (through correspondence in 2014). MPL has subsequently liaised with 
both the Birmingham and Manchester teams to address the issues raised, which 
have been considered alongside the other responses from CBC, BBC, and 
Royal Mail Group.  
 All of the comments provided in respect of transport have been considered in 
the preparation of the DCO application documents.  
Water 
 Responses in respect of water were received from the Environment Agency, 
Anglian Water Services Limited, Bedford Group of Internal Drainage Boards and 
Houghton Conquest Parish Council. 
 The Environment Agency response included various comments and 
recommendations in respect of flooding, sewerage, surface water and drainage.  
 Houghton Conquest Parish Council raised concerns regarding the attenuation 
pond, whilst responses from Anglian Water Services Limited included a request 
for various protective provisions to be included within the DCO. 
 All of the comments provided in respect of water have been considered in the 
preparation of the DCO application documents.  
Landscape 
 Additional viewpoints were requested by Historic England, BBC and the 
Chilterns Conservation Board. 
 Each of the viewpoints requested were considered by MPL. Not all of the 
requested viewpoints were added to the assessment methodology and the 
reasons for this are set out in chapter 11 of the ES (Document Reference 6.2).   
 Comments were received from Historic England and the Chilterns Conservation 
Board with regard to the proposed methodology in respect of landscape and 
visual impact assessment. Historic England made comments with regard to the 
quality of the photomontages presented. The comments made in respect of 
landscape and visual impact assessment have been considered in the 
preparation of the DCO application documents.  
 
Consultation Report 
Millbrook Power

Electrical and Gas Connections 
 Comments were received from NGET and NGG in respect of the proposed 
electrical and gas connections. These comments were predominantly technical 
in nature with regards to safeguarding the respondent’s assets and other safety 
requirements. Where appropriate these comments have been considered in the 
preparation of the DCO application documents. Other detailed requirements will 
be addressed/observed at the later stages of the Project (e.g. during 
construction). 
 Houghton Conquest Parish Council requested clarification in respect of the 
installation options for the electrical and gas connections. Further clarification 
was provided by MPL on 6 June 2017 (Appendix 4.L.ii).  
 CBC advised that details of cabling within the public highway and any gas 
connection should be included with the application. 
 The above comments have been considered in the preparation of the DCO 
application documents. 
Air Quality 
 Comments in respect of air quality impacts were received from the Environment 
Agency, Bedford Borough Council, Houghton Conquest Parish Council and 
Marston Moretaine Parish Council. 
 The comments were largely general in nature and did not raise significant 
concerns with regard to the proposed methodology of assessing air quality 
impacts arising from the Project. These comments have been considered in the 
preparation of the DCO application documents.  
Cultural heritage and archaeology 
 Comments in respect of cultural heritage and archaeology were received from 
Historic England and CBC. 
 Historic England had comments with regard to the assessment methodology 
and the quality of the photomontages. Both Historic England and CBC 
requested additional viewpoints to be included in the EIA. Each of the 
viewpoints requested were considered by MPL. Not all of the requested 
viewpoints were added to the assessment methodology and the reasons for this 
are set out in chapter 11 of the ES (Document Reference 6.2).  
 The comments have been considered in the preparation of the DCO application 
documents.  
 The thematic comments summarised above are further detailed in Appendix 5.E 
where responses are made to each comment.

 Attendance at the public exhibitions was spread relatively evenly although the 
most-attended exhibition was held at Marston Moretaine Village Hall, with 28% 
of visitors attending that exhibition. 
 The Marston Moretaine Village Hall exhibition also had the highest feedback 
form response rate at 52% compared to an average response rate from the 
public exhibitions of 33%.   
 A complete record of all feedback received during the Phase 2 statutory s47 
public exhibitions held in June 2017, with MPL’s response, is presented in 
Appendix 5.G. 
Summary of feedback 
 S47 feedback was collected from the local community via two primary sources:  
� feedback forms completed at the public exhibitions or returned by freepost 
following the public exhibitions (Appendix 3.Z.iv); and  
� leaflets distributed to the local community which included a freepost 
feedback form (Appendix 3.Z.iii).  
Consultation Report 
Millbrook Power 
 
137 
 
 Feedback forms were made available to 157 people who attended the four 
exhibitions. The responses included 52 returned forms, 6 via freepost and 46 
direct from exhibitions as shown in Figure 9.2. MPL also received 100 leaflet 
feedback forms via freepost.

Figure 9.4 s47 freepost leaflet - respondents support of the Project   
 Comparing Figure 9.3 and Figure 9.4 it is clear that a much higher proportion of 
respondents who attended the public exhibitions supported the scheme (53%) 
compared to respondents who returned the leaflet feedback forms (18%). 
Conversely, a much higher proportion of respondents who returned the leaflet 
feedback forms opposed the scheme (72%) than those who attended the public 
exhibitions (19%). Furthermore, those who attended the public exhibitions were 
more likely to have a neutral view of the Project (16%) than those who returned 
the leaflet feedback forms (5%).

 Figure 9.5 summarises all s47 respondents' level of support for the Project; 30% 
of respondents were supportive and 54% opposed. A further 9% were neutral 
and 7% undecided while 1% of respondents did not state their views on the 
Project.

 Figure 9.8 shows the response to the question ‘Millbrook Power is committed to 
ensuring that the Project will bring broader benefits to the community. How 
would you like to see us supporting the community?' In total 113 responses 
were received to this question and the responses are summarised below. Figure 
9.8 shows that the most popular response was supporting local environmental 
initiatives (31%), followed by (27%) local facilities, then local education (19%) 
and then Sporting or Cultural Events in the Area (13%).  
 MPL also received a range of ‘other’ responses (10%) which included the 
following suggestions: give 1 on 2 KwH to local households, contribute to the 
upkeep of Ampthill Park, improve and enhance the bridleway for horses and 
other users, ensure as near zero emissions as possible, community buildings, 
projects for young people, Marston Vale Park and community forest 
enhancement.  
 
Figure 9.6 s47 comments – community benefit preferences  
 Figure 9.9 shows the combined responses from the questions which asked 
respondents to provide comments on the 2017 PEIR findings and any other 
comments about the Project.  
 In total there were 152 responses to these two questions, this comprised of 52 
exhibition feedback forms (46 returned in exhibitions and 6 via freepost) and 
100 leaflet feedback forms distributed to households and businesses within the 
CCZ (see Figure 6.1).  
 In order to identify the key issues arising from the s47 consultation, each 
response was examined and the responses were summarised by topic theme. 
The result of this exercise is set out in Appendix 5.G (which also contains MPL's 
response to each thematic issue raised). In broad terms, the s47 responses 
Consultation Report 
Millbrook Power 
 
140 
 
received, when broken down into themes produce the results shown in Figure 
9.7. 
 
Figure 9.7 s47 comments - themed 
 Further details of the comments received and MPL’s response under each of 
the above themes are provided in Appendix 5.G. The themes that attracted the 
most comments were: 
� Transport (28); 
� Other (24); 
� Site selection (19); 
� Air quality (19); and  
� Health (17). 
 It should be noted that each response has to be considered on its own merit 
and that the number of respondents identifying an issue may not correlate 
directly to the importance of that individual area. So, for example, although 
many more comments were made on air quality than health this does not mean 
that a lesser degree of examination was carried out on the health issues. 
 A number of general themes emerged through s47 responses. Some of these 
related to matters which are considered within the EIA process such as noise, 
landscape and air quality assessment. MPL also received a significant number 
of responses which did not relate to any of the Phase 1 themes. These 
responses are considered under the ‘other’ sub-heading. 
 
Consultation Report 
Millbrook Power 
 
141 
 
Transport   
 A number of comments expressed concern that the local transport network 
would not be able to cope with the cumulative transport impacts of the Project 
and other new development in the local area (including new housing 
development and the Rookery South RRF Project). A number of respondents 
stated that increased vehicles movements would have an adverse impact on air 
quality. A number of comments expressed the wish for construction traffic to 
avoid routing through the local villages.  
 MPL has considered all comments received in relation to transport in the 
preparation of the DCO application documents including proposed mitigation.  
Other  
 MPL received a range of other responses from s47 consultees which did not 
relate to any of the Phase 1 consultation themes. A number of consultees 
submitted comments stating they were generally in support or opposed the 
Project. One comment was also received regarding the applicant (Drax) and 
one comment on financial considerations.   
 MPL has considered all of the above comments in the preparation of the DCO 
application documents.    
 Five comments were received commenting on the need for the proposed power 
generation plant. These comments have not been directly taken into account in 
the preparation of the DCO Application since the need for the Project is already 
established in National Policy Statements EN-1, EN-2, EN-4 and EN-5.  
 A number of consultees submitted comments about the Rookery South RRF 
Project to MPL's consultation.  
 These comments have not been directly taken into account in the preparation 
of the DCO application documents since they do not relate to the Project. 
However, these comments have highlighted the requirement to ensure that 
consultees understand the relationship between the Project and the Rookery 
South RRF Project. MPL has provided detailed drafting in both the MPL Draft 
Order (Document Reference 3.1) and the Explanatory Memorandum 
(Document Reference 3.2) to explain this relationship. Section 3.4 and 
Appendix 5 of the Planning Statement (Document Reference 10.1) also 
provides an explanation of the two projects and their relationship.   
Site selection  
 MPL received a number of comments which oppose the site selection for a 
variety of reasons including; too much new development in the local area; the 
Project should not be located in proximity to existing homes and communities 
and towns; and the Project should be located along the coastline. Respondent's 
also requested that MPL consider alternative sites for the Project.  
Consultation Report 
Millbrook Power 
 
142 
 
 MPL has considered all comments received regarding site selection. The 
rationale behind the site selection for the Project and an explanation of the 
alternatives considered by MPL is set out in Chapter 5 of the ES (Document 
Reference 6.1).  
Air Quality   
 A number of comments stated that the estimated air quality impacts would have 
an adverse effect on human health and ecology.  Respondent's also questioned 
if the Project would meet the relevant national air quality standards, particularly 
given the cumulative impacts of the Rookery South RRF Project.  
 Comments received regarding the baseline data used in the air quality impact 
assessment including that the method should take account of the fact that 
historically, pollution from the brickworks affected air quality in Ampthill and 
baseline data provided by Covanta is not considered to be accurate. 
 MPL has considered all comments received in relation to air quality in the 
preparation of the DCO application documents.  
Health 
 A number of respondents expressed concern that emissions from the operation 
of the Project and increased vehicle movements would have an adverse impact 
on the health of the local population. All comments received in relation to health 
impacts have been considered in the preparation of the DCO application 
documents. An assessment of the likely significant effects on health is contained 
in chapter 15 of the ES (Document Reference 6.1) 
Phase 2 s48 consultation  
 MPL received two consultation responses that identified themselves as 
responding specifically to s48 publicity. Both of these responses, from BBC and 
Milton Keynes Council, stated that the consultees had no comments on the s48 
consultation material. 
 MPL has therefore taken the approach that some s47 responses may also be 
s48 responses. 
9.4 
Feedback from Phase 2 non-statutory consultation (carried out following 
Phase 2 statutory consultation)  
 MPL held a meeting with Covanta on 18th July 2017 to discuss MPL's proposed 
amendments to the existing RRF Order and protective provisions to be included 
in the MPL Draft Order for the benefit of Covanta.  
 MPL corresponded with Network Rail, Highways England, CBC and BBC on the 
draft Transport Assessment for the Project. CBC responded to confirm they had 
no comments on the draft Transport Assessment; and Network Rail responded 
to confirm they have no objection to the Project. 
Consultation Report 
Millbrook Power 
 
143 
 
 MPL contacted Natural England and Historic England to clarify points raised 
with regards to the EIA within their s42 consultation responses. Natural England 
confirmed the position set out during Phase 1 consultation that it agreed with 
MPL’s conclusions of the No Significant Effects Report (Document Reference 
5.7); the parties discussed the comments regarding European Protected 
Species and agreed appropriate mitigation will be captured in the CEMP 
(Appendix 3.2 of the ES, Document Reference 6.1); and corresponded on points 
raised in relation to soils and agricultural land and Natural England confirmed it 
had no further comments to make. MPL sent a response to Historic England 
addressing the points raised with regards to viewpoints in its s42 consultation 
response; discussions with Historic England are ongoing. 
 MPL issued a technical note to CBC in relation to further noise modelling and 
monitoring to be undertaken to inform the EIA. The Environmental Health Officer 
at CBC agreed the approach to further modelling and monitoring; the results 
have informed the noise assessment presented in the ES (Document Reference 
6.1) and the mitigation secured through the CEMP (Appendix 3.2 of the ES, 
Document Reference 6.1) and the MPL Draft Order (Document Reference 3.1). 
 Phase 2 non-statutory consultation has been taken into consideration by MPL 
in undertaking the final assessments for the EIA of the Project; the final 
assessments are presented in the ES (Document Reference 6.1). 
9.5 
Summary and conclusions   
 In summary, MPL undertook a single period of statutory consultation during the 
Phase 2 consultation combining the requirements of s42, s46, s47 and s48 of 
the PA 2008. The Phase 2 statutory consultation period commenced on 29th 
May 2017 and concluded on 2nd July 2017, a period of 35 days (save from where 
extensions to that period were granted either to ensure that consultees had the 
statutory minimum of 28 days to respond or, in the case of Anglian Water and 
Natural England, to ensure that the views of statutory consultees wanting to 
submit a response beyond the deadline could be included in the consultation).  
 MPL received 31 responses from s42 consultees, equivalent to a 20% response 
rate. The majority of responses received were from s42(a) parties. The themes 
that attracted the most comments from s42 consultees included: transport; 
water; landscape; electrical connection; gas connection; air quality; and cultural 
heritage and archaeology.  
 MPL received 152 responses from s47 consultees. Feedback from the local 
community was obtained via feedback forms made available at the public 
exhibitions (52) and freepost feedback back forms included in the leaflet 
distributed to households within the CCZ (100). The themes that attracted the 
most comments from s47 consultees included: air quality; transport; site 
selection; noise; ecology; and health.  
 MPL has had regard to all relevant consultation responses received in 
accordance with s49 of the PA 2008. The tables contained in Appendix 5.E and 
Appendix 5.G summarise all relevant s42 and s47 Phase 2 consultation

The Interaction between the Project and the 
Rookery South RRF Project 
10.1 
Introduction 
 The Covanta RRF Project was granted development consent pursuant to the 
PA 2008 by virtue of the Rookery South (Resource Recovery Facility) Order 
2011 (the "RRF Order"). MPL has an interest in certain parts of the land that is 
covered by the RRF Order, through an option granted to it by the landowner, 
O&H Properties Limited (“O&H”). O&H have also granted an option agreement 
to Covanta for the acquisitions of land required for the Rookery South RRF 
Project. 
 Following early meetings with both CBC and BBC who both noted the existence 
of the RRF Order and advised that the consultation zones for the Project should 
be of broadly similar size to those of the RRF Order (paragraph 6.2.15 to 
6.2.19), it was recognised by MPL that during both non statutory and statutory 
consultation phases, the juxtaposition of the two nationally significant 
infrastructure projects would need to be dealt with transparently and openly in 
order to ensure that the community and those with an interest in the land were 
aware of the effects of both projects constructing and operating in similar 
timeframes. This Consultation Report describes how MPL undertook a phased 
approach to consultation on the Project as follows:  
� The Phase 1 consultation took place between April 2014 and March 2015 
and during this period non-statutory consultation activates took place prior 
to and after the Phase 1 statutory consultation period (October 2014 – 
November 2014).  
� The Phase 2 consultation took place between March 2017 and October 2017 
and during this period non-statutory consultation activates took place prior 
to and after the Phase 2 statutory consultation period (May 2017 – July 
2017).  
10.2 
Non-Statutory Consultation (Phase 1 and Phase 2 consultation) 
Phase 1 non-statutory consultation  
 In recognition of the need for clarity expressed above, MPL representatives at 
all exhibitions were specifically instructed to ensure that in conversation they 
made it quite clear that there was a possibility that (subject to consent) both the 
Covanta RRF Project and the MPL Project could both be implemented and 
operate at the same or similar times. Subsequent information showed that this 
possibility was of concern to residents and that is discussed at paragraph 7.2.19 
of this Consultation Report. 
 Early non-statutory consultation occurred in early June 2014 as described in 
Section 6.2 of this Consultation Report and feedback received from this 
consultation exercise relating to the RRF Order is recorded at Appendix 3.F.  
Consultation Report 
Millbrook Power 
 
146 
 
 In particular, in response to the consultation question: “Is there anything you 
would like to see done differently at the next round of exhibitions?” Responses 
were made with respect to the Covanta RRF Project that there was concern 
over the “Relationship with Covanta and creep of subsequent growth”; and a 
request to “keep us informed over future proposals on the old Covanta project”.  
 In response to the above remarks, additional consultation material was 
prepared for the Phase 1 statutory consultation.  
Phase 2 non-statutory consultation  
 MPL held an early meeting with Covanta at the start of the Phase 2 Consultation 
period (on 8th March 2017) so that MPL and Covanta could update one-another 
on progress of respective projects and discuss the next steps to ensure that 
both Projects could co-exist in Rookery South Pit. Minutes of this meeting are 
enclosed at Appendix 3.H.i.  
10.3 
Statutory Consultation (Phase 1 and Phase 2 consultation) 
Phase 1 statutory consultation 
 In order to be clear about the potential for more than one DCO development 
being carried out within Rookery South Pit, the briefing materials at the Phase 
1 statutory consultation (s47) exhibitions made it clear that the Project and the 
RRF Order could both be implemented / operated at the same time if the MPL 
Project is granted consent. The issue of cumulative impact was dealt with where 
appropriate in the text of the explanatory exhibition boards which are enclosed 
at Appendix 3.Y.i. 
 In addition to the above the consultation material (photomontages) (Appendix 
3.Z.ii) demonstrated the joint effect of the Project and the Covanta RRF Project.  
 The 2014 PEIR, which formed part of the statutory consultation materials, 
recognised and explained the juxtaposition of the Project and the RRF Order at 
chapter 2 (‘Project and Site Description’). Cumulative impact with the Covanta 
RRF Project was generally addressed in chapter 4 (‘Environmental Impact 
Assessment Methodology’) and then specifically throughout the topic chapters.  
 Covanta responded specifically to the s42 consultation on the 10th November 
2014 and its response is included at Appendix 5.B. This acknowledges the MPL 
proposal and Covanta’s willingness to discuss protective provisions. 
 MPL has engaged with both Covanta and O&H throughout the development of 
the Project and has proposed drafting in the MPL Draft Order in order to allow 
both projects to successfully co-exist.  
 Other comments were received from consultees demonstrating knowledge of 
the juxtaposition of the two projects. For example, English Heritage commented 
that the proposal was modest in comparison with the Covanta building (the RRF 
Order) but that the accumulation of impacts was potentially significant. The 
Consultation Report 
Millbrook Power 
 
147 
 
issue of cumulative EIA is addressed at section 4 of the ES (Document 
Reference 6.1). 
 Further comments were made in response to Phase 1 s47 consultation. Four 
comments were made to the effect that the RRF Order has already been 
permitted and that the Project (MPL) would add to the cumulative impact in the 
area. Comment was also made that if choice were available then the Project 
(MPL) would be preferred. 
 Within Appendix 5.D there is a specific section which addresses consultation 
responses received in relation to cumulative impact; this in turn cross refers to 
the ES (Document 6.1) as appropriate.   
Phase 2 statutory consultation  
 Briefing materials presented to members of the public at the s47 public 
exhibitions held during the Phase 2 statutory consultation period made clear 
that the Project and the Covanta RRF Project could both be implemented / 
operated at the same time should the Project (MPL) be granted consent. The 
issue of cumulative impact was dealt with where appropriate in the explanatory 
text of the exhibition boards which are enclosed at Appendix 3.Z.i.  
 Photomontages showing the potential cumulative visual impact of the Project 
and the RRF Order were displayed at the public exhibitions (see Appendix 
3.Z.ii). 
 The Phase 2 statutory consultation materials, sent to s42 consultees and 
published as part of the s47 consultation, also included a Project Overview 
Document (Appendix 3.T.ii) which further explained the relationship between 
the two projects.  
 The 2017 PEIR, which formed part of the statutory consultation materials, 
explained the juxtaposition of the Project and the Covanta RRF Project at 
chapter 3 (‘Project and Site Description’). Cumulative impact with the Covanta 
RRF Project was generally addressed in chapter 4 (‘Environmental Impact 
Assessment Methodology’) and then specifically throughout the topic chapters 
6-15. 
 Covanta and O&H were both consulted under s42 of the PA 2008 during the 
Phase 2 statutory consultation. Delivery records show that Covanta and O&H 
both received s42 consultation information packs on 23rd May 2017 however 
neither responded to the s42 consultation. MPL have been engaging with 
Covanta and O&H outside of the statutory consultation period as explained in 
the Section 10.2 and Section 10.4 of this Consultation Report.

Non-Statutory consultation activities following the Phase 1 and Phase 2 
statutory consultation  
Phase 1 non-statutory consultation (following statutory consultation) 
 Non-statutory consultation continued after the Phase 1 statutory consultation. 
During the Phase 1 consultation, a number of meetings were held with 
stakeholders including an outreach meeting at the forest centre on the 26th 
November 2014. At that meeting it was agreed not to use background data from 
the Covanta application which was out of date (see Appendix 4.M.ii). 
 MPL also issued two information updates (see paragraph 6.5.5 to 6.5.11 of this 
Consultation Report) to the local community and prescribed consultees which 
explains the key changes made to the Project since statutory consultation, some 
of which were changes to ensure both projects could co-exist. 
 The second information update issued on 20th March 2015 is contained within 
Appendix 4.N.iii and dealt specifically with an amendment to the Project’s 
redline boundary which was consulted on in October/November 2014. This 
amendment was made in order to ensure that both the Project (MPL) and the 
Covanta RRF Project could co-exist in Rookery South Pit (see paragraph 6.5.8 
to 6.5.9 for full details). Additionally, the information update informed consultees 
of amendments to the RRF Order which MPL proposed to make.   
Phase 2 non-statutory consultation (following statutory consultation) 
 MPL held meetings with a number of stakeholders after the Phase 2 statutory 
consultation as detailed in Table 8.7. MPL held meetings with Covanta on 18th 
July 2017 and with Covanta and O&H on 6th September 2017 to discuss 
interrelationship with the Covanta RRF Project including the scope of protective 
provisions to be included in the MPL Draft Order for the benefit of Covanta, and 
the amendments to the RRF Order proposed by MPL. Copies of the meeting 
notes are enclosed in Appendix 4.O.iii and Appendix 4.O. xiii.  
10.5 
Management of the Interrelationship with the RRF Order    
 In order to manage the interrelationship between the two projects, MPL has 
included two sets of Protective Provisions within the MPL Draft Order 
(Document Reference 3.1)  
 The set of protective provisions which benefit Covanta is contained within 
Schedule 10 to the MPL Draft Order. This drafting has been discussed directly 
with Covanta and will continue to be negotiated following submission of the 
DCO Application, as is the case with the other sets of protective provisions 
contained within Schedule 10 for the benefit of statutory undertakers.  
 The second set of protective provisions are contained in Schedule 11 of the 
MPL Draft Order and would be inserted into the RRF Order in the event that the 
MPL Draft Order is made by the SoS. These protective provisions would protect 
MPL in the context of Covanta exercising its powers under the RRF Order over 
Consultation Report 
Millbrook Power 
 
149 
 
the land which is contained within the MPL Order limits. Again, this drafting has 
been discussed directly with Covanta and will continue to be negotiated 
following submission.  
 The Explanatory Memorandum (Document Reference 3.2) provides further 
explanation of Schedules 10 and 11. The Project Overview Document 
(Appendix 3.T.ii) and Appendix 5 of the Planning Statement (Document 
Reference 10.1) provide a more detailed explanation of the interaction between 
the two projects.  
 The inter-relationship between the two nationally significant infrastructure 
projects has been recognised from early on in the life of the Project and the 
cumulative impact of both projects together has been openly set out in and 
acknowledged during public exhibitions and discussions, as well as the 
consultation materials for both statutory and non-statutory consultation in Phase 
1 and Phase 2 Consultation. MPL has engaged over a period of many months 
with the landowner (O&H), the relevant local authorities and Covanta through 
meetings and correspondence, regarding the proposed amendments to the 
RRF Order that MPL proposes to make. In addition, during Phase 1 an 
information update was sent to prescribed consultees and the local community 
which notes the changes that have been made to the Project following 
consultation feedback (some of these changes assist with the co-existence of 
both nationally significant infrastructure projects) and also explained that MPL 
proposed to make amendments to the RRF Order.  
 As such, MPL considers that both the Phase 1 and Phase 2 non-statutory and 
statutory phases of consultation have clearly set out the interactions between 
the two projects.  Following acceptance of the MPL DCO Application, the local 
community and other stakeholders will have an opportunity to make relevant 
representations on the proposed Protective Provisions and have those 
considered through the examination process in the normal way. In addition, 
MPL will continue to engage directly with Covanta, O&H and the local authorities 
regarding the interaction between the two projects, including discussing the 
detailed drafting that is set out in the draft MPL Draft Order (Document 
Reference 3.1).

Evolution of the Project in Response to 
Consultation Feedback  
11.1 
Introduction 
 Since the start of consultation in January 2014, the Project has undergone a 
number of significant changes. The pre-application consultation for the Project 
informed several important aspects of the Project, resulting in a revised 
consultation approach, design interventions and mitigation commitments.  
 At each stage of consultation MPL has reviewed feedback received and, in 
accordance with s49 of the PA 2008, had regard to the comments made. Where 
possible, MPL has sought to refine its proposals in response to the feedback 
from the consultation process. MPL has, in other cases, taken account of the 
responses in the preparation of the ES (Document Reference 6.1), the draft 
Order (Document Reference 3.1), and other DCO Application documents. 
 In summary, feedback received during the Phase 1 and Phase 2 consultation 
informed the development of the Project in the following ways:  
� Undergrounding of electrical connection resulting in no additional pylons; 
� Consultation Zones modified; CCZ expanded from 3km radius to 5km radius;  
� Air dispersion modelling to determine stack heights was brought forwards 
and undertaken in May 2014 
� Additional viewpoints added for the LVIA;  
� Confirmation of the preferred Gas Connection route, following comments 
from consultees;  
� Changing the AGI location to address landowner’s concerns;  
� Reduction in stack height from 60m (at scoping stage) to 35m (in DCO 
Application); 
� Improved access arrangements, traffic management measures and routing 
during construction; and  
� Commitment to landscape and ecology mitigation strategy.   
 The remainder of this section explains how consultation feedback has 
influenced the Project in terms of consultation approach, Project design and 
mitigation. Finally, this section addresses feedback that did not lead to Project 
changes.

11.2 
Consultation approach 
SoCC  
 The approach to undertaking consultation with the local community was 
influenced by early discussions with CBC and BBC as part of the Phase 1 non-
statutory consultation. Following discussions with CBC and BBC before the 
Phase 1 statutory consultation began, the size of the CCZ (see Figure 6.1) was 
increased from a proposed 3 km to 5 km. Local council members felt that 5 km 
would be a more appropriate extent for the CCZ, following the precedent set by 
the Rookery South RRF Project. This change was reflected in the final Phase 1 
SoCC as well as being carried through into the final Phase 2 SoCC.   
Public exhibitions 
 A number of the comments received during the Phase 1 non-statutory public 
exhibitions focussed on the availability of information.  As acknowledged by 
DCLG’s guidance on pre-application consultation, there is an inherent tension 
between consulting early and providing sufficient information to enable 
consultees to comments.  MPL sought to balance the availability of information 
with its desire to raise early awareness and knowledge, and gain local feedback 
on its outline proposals.  
 However, some respondents indicated during the Phase 1 consultation that 
more information was needed on the Project at the non-statutory consultation 
stage.  MPL explained that the non-statutory exhibitions and material were 
intended to introduce the Project and the MPL development team to the local 
community and that more detailed proposals (and consultation on these) would 
follow. Early engagement would enable discussions of aspects of the Project at 
an early stage in the design development process when a number of options 
were still under consideration. Early consultation therefore provided 
opportunities for consultees to influence subsequent design and environmental 
assessment work, albeit MPL recognises that this early engagement inevitably 
meant that there was not as much detailed information available as at statutory 
consultation when more refined proposals were put forward for consideration.  
 In response to these views from non-statutory consultees, MPL committed to 
providing further detailed information presented in a variety of formats at the 
subsequent Phase 1 statutory consultation exhibitions, notwithstanding the 
statutory information requirements, including: 
� Additional exhibition boards;  
� More extensive visual information on the Project;  
� Printed copies of all documents issued so far; and  
� Printed copies of the 2014 PEIR its appendices and figures to Parish 
Councils.

 The equivalent information, in the same format as set out in paragraph 11.2.4. 
above, was subsequently provided for the purpose of the Phase 2 s47 
consultation and exhibitions (Appendix 3.Z). 
Education 
 Feedback received from the Phase 1 non-statutory public exhibitions 
highlighted an interest in MPL supporting local education. In response to this, 
MPL arranged a presentation to 6th form students at the Kimberley STEM 
College on 4th November 2014 and offered the same during Phase 2 
Consultation.     
11.3 
Project design and mitigation   
Stack height  
 Feedback from the Phase 1 non-statutory consultation revealed that a number 
of consultees did not want to see large stacks introduced into the landscape. 
MPL received comments requesting that lower stack heights be used on the 
Generating Equipment Site. 
 For the purposes of the Phase 1 non-statutory consultation process the worst 
case maximum stack height was assumed to be 60 m (measured from the base 
of Rookery South Pit). In response to the comments received during that 
process and in order to give more certainty in the statutory consultation, the 
atmospheric dispersion modelling process (which determines the required 
height for the stack) was brought forward in order to inform the production of the 
2014 PEIR. The findings of the modelling showed that satisfactory results could 
be achieved with reduced stack heights in the range of 30 m to 40 m.   
 Feedback from the Phase 1 statutory consultation revealed that design and 
landscape matters continued to be a concern for consultees. Consultees were 
pleased that the maximum stack height had been reduced since the Phase 1 
non-statutory exhibitions. 
 Following finalised atmospheric dispersion modelling, it was determined that the 
overall height of the Stack could be further reduced and refined to between 32.5 
m to 35 m in height above the base of the pit. These have therefore been used 
as the maximum and minimum parameters assessed within the ES (Document 
Reference 6.1).  
 Comments received from s47 consultees during the Phase 2 Consultation 
where the Stack was mentioned predominantly related to air quality emissions. 
Three comments were received which explicitly supported the reduction in stack 
height. 
 All consultation responses received are summarised in Appendices 5.D, 5.E, 
5.F and 5.G.

Pylons and overhead lines 
 Feedback from the Phase 1 non-statutory consultation revealed that consultees 
expressed concerns about the visual impact of additional pylons in the 
landscape and asked why the connection could not be made via underground 
cables.  
 Due to the manner in which NGET's design scheme works, it was not possible 
to ascertain what connection option(s) would be included in any offer to MPL 
and therefore the realistic worst case of seven new pylons (one of which would 
replace an existing pylon) had to be assumed at this initial stage and reported 
later on in the 2014 PEIR.   
 Feedback from the Phase 1 statutory consultation demonstrated that consultees 
remained very concerned about the number of additional pylons proposed for 
the Electrical Connection. At a height of up to 45 m, the top of these structures 
is considerably higher than that of the stacks especially when considering the 
depth of Rookery South Pit (15 m), and again consultees asked whether the 
connection could be made using underground cables.  
 MPL undertook further non-statutory consultation on how to address the visual 
impact of the pylons and overhead lines.  
 MPL held an outreach meeting with PINS and local representatives on 26th 
November 2014 where attendees continued to express concerns about the 
visual impact of any proposed pylons. During the meeting, stakeholders asked 
whether MPL could confirm within the DCO Application, the number of turbines 
and stacks that would be constructed as part of the Project.   
 In response to feedback received from the 26th November 2014 meeting, MPL 
met with NGET on 17th December 2014 and agreed that the electrical 
connection, for which consents would be applied for, could be reduced in 
complexity. The revised connection design could require a maximum of four 
new pylons (where again one would replace an existing pylon) rather than seven 
as proposed in the 2014 PEIR. Furthermore, it was agreed that underground 
cabling might be a viable option, and that consent should also be applied for to 
allow such a solution to be constructed.  
 Following the 17th December 2014 NGET meeting and after due consideration, 
MPL took the decision to only seek consent for an underground electrical 
connection. This would only require one new pylon that would replace an 
existing pylon (meaning that the net number of pylons would remain exactly the 
same as is presently the case), and up to two SECs adjacent to the existing 
overhead line. The rest of the connection would be made by an underground 
cable. The decision to underground the Electrical Connection was reflected in 
the 2017 PEIR project description and preliminary assessment of effects, which 
presented two electrical connection options (both of which comprised 
underground cabling), which were referred to as Option 1 and Option 2.     
Consultation Report 
Millbrook Power 
 
154 
 
 MPL engaged with NGET during the Phase 2 consultation on the preferred 
choice of Electrical Connection from the MPL site to the 400kV NETS to the 
south. Following these discussions, it has been decided that Electrical 
Connection Option 2 is no longer suitable. This means that Electrical 
Connection Option 1, comprising one underground double circuit Tee-in and 
two SECs (located on each side of the existing transmission line), is now the 
sole option proposed in respect of the Electrical Connection. This option is 
reflected in Chapter 3 of the ES (Document Reference 6.1) and has been 
assumed for the purpose of the EIA. The consideration of the alternatives as 
described above is set out in Section 5.5 of the ES (Document Reference 6.1). 
Viewpoints  
 During the Phase 1 non-statutory consultation a number of comments were 
received regarding the choice and appropriateness of viewpoints used in the 
LVIA. As a result of this, the viewpoints were reviewed to ensure that they were 
adequate.  A number of additional viewpoints were added and the preliminary 
environmental assessment of these was included in the 2014 PEIR.   
 During the Phase 1 statutory consultation one s42 respondent (CBC) requested 
six further viewpoints to be added to the LVIA, in addition to those added 
following non-statutory consultation. MPL considered the viewpoints suggested, 
and agreed to add one additional viewpoint from the eastern boundary of the 
Millennium Country Park to the EIA. The other viewpoints requested were 
considered by MPL to be addressed by viewpoints already included in the LVIA, 
or considered beyond the zone of visual impact.  
Landscape Mitigation 
 During the Phase 1 non-statutory consultation comments were made on the 
need to screen the development.  Within the 2014 PEIR, landscape mitigation 
was considered as part of the preliminary assessment.   
 During both the Phase 1 Phase 2 statutory consultation MPL received a number 
of comments on the effects of the Project on landscape. In response to these 
comments, MPL has committed to prepare and implement a Landscape and 
Ecology Mitigation and Management Strategy (LEMMS) which will include 
screen planting and creation of ponds.  This is secured via Requirement 3 in 
Schedule 2 of the MPL Draft Order (Document Reference 3.1), and an Outline 
LEMMS is presented in Appendix 11.3 of the ES (Document Reference 6.1).  
Gas Pipeline Route and AGI 
 A meeting was held with the relevant landowner to discuss the proposed gas 
pipeline route and AGI location on 9th September 2014. The landowner did not 
have any concerns about the pipeline route; however, they considered that the 
proposed AGI location would result in the sterilisation of a considerable amount 
of land. They suggested an alternative site some 350 m further south. In 
response, on 18th September 2014 MPL commissioned Parsons Brinkerhoff to 
Consultation Report 
Millbrook Power 
 
155 
 
extend the conceptual design work to include this option which was included in 
the 2014 PEIR.  
 Following the non-statutory consultation with the landowner regarding the AGI 
location options, MPL did not receive any further comments on this matter 
during the Phase 1 statutory consultation. Therefore, the alternative location as 
suggested by the landowner has been adopted as MPL's AGI location. No 
further comments on the AGI location options were received during the Phase 
2 Consultation. 
Traffic and Transport  
 The 2014 PEIR consulted on during the Phase 1 statutory consultation included 
a number of route options for construction traffic associated with the Electrical 
Connection and Gas Connection to access those areas. Both s47 and s42 
(Stewartby Parish Council) responses suggested that two of those routes (via 
Sandhill Close and Manor Road) were not suitable because of a number of 
sensitive residential dwellings. As a result, MPL removed those options from the 
DCO Application documents.  
 An outcome of the Phase 1 statutory consultation was the production of a 
detailed Transport Assessment and further consultation on the same with CBC 
and BBC. The Transport Assessment indicated that the creation of an improved 
Junction between the main Access Road and Green Lane and also the access 
arrangements for installation of the Gas Connection and Electrical Connection 
would adhere to an approved traffic management plan which will include road 
safety measures.  The final Traffic Management Plan will also include a routing 
agreement during construction.  Consultation with CBC and BBC confirmed this. 
Provision of a Construction Traffic Management Plan is secured via a 
Requirement in Schedule 2 of the draft DCO. 
 Another outcome of the Phase 1 statutory consultation revealed that temporary 
access points were likely to be required for installation of the Gas Connection 
and Electrical Connection. Consultation has occurred with the Millbrook Proving 
Ground in respect to this issue because one of the temporary access points will 
affect their land (Appendix 4.L.iii).  
Air Quality 
 Air quality remained an issue of concern for the general public during the Phase 
1 statutory consultation. The emissions from the stack will be strictly limited by 
the EA as part of an operational Environmental Permit and will not cause harm 
to people and the environment.  The Power Generation Plant will be operational 
for up to 17% of the year on a five year rolling average (and maximum of 26% 
of the year in any one year, subject to the five year rolling average restriction).  
 Attendees at the Phase 1 public exhibitions were reassured that detailed 
atmospheric dispersion modelling had been undertaken, and that this showed 
that there is no significant effect on receptors (see the Section 6 of the ES). One 
attendee in particular had some expert knowledge of the area.  In response to 
Consultation Report 
Millbrook Power 
 
156 
 
points made by this consultee’ additional queries were made by MPL regarding 
the background data for the atmospheric dispersion modelling to ensure that 
the correct meteorological data had been used.   This data is reflected in both 
the 2017 PEIR and the ES that accompanies the DCO Application.  
Mitigation measures 
 Throughout MPL's consultation there has been a considerable amount of 
interest in how the impacts of the Project will be mitigated. Having regard to 
these responses, MPL has included a series of Requirements in Schedule 2 to 
the MPL Draft Order which secures various of the mitigation measures referred 
to in the ES (Document Reference 6.1). In addition, MPL has prepared a 
Statement of Proposed Heads of Terms for an Agreement Pursuant to s106 of 
the TCPA 1990 (Document Reference 10.3) in order to secure the mitigation 
measures which are more appropriately secured outside of the Requirements 
in the MPL Draft Order.  
 Under a s106 Agreement, MPL would propose to submit a local service provider 
engagement scheme to CBC and BBC for approval covering the measures that 
MPL would take in order to ensure that opportunities for local organisations to 
bid for contracts during the construction period and operational period are 
advertised locally. MPL would also deliver an education scheme.  This includes 
a commitment that:  
� MPL will undertake a proposed programme of visits to schools within the 
CBC and BBC area to explain the Project and how it fits in with providing 
energy for the UK.  MPL has already visited Kimberley STEM College to 
explain the Project (in November 2014).    
11.4 
Other feedback  
 During both the Phase 1 and Phase 2 consultation MPL received a number of 
comments which did not lead to any Project changes for the reasons set out 
below.  
 A number of s47 responses from the Phase 1 statutory consultation asked MPL 
whether a domestic gas supply could be provided in Stewartby as part of the 
Project. MPL has explained that this is not within the Project remit. MPL did 
provide local council members with contact information for the appropriate local 
gas supplier.  
 At the Phase 1 statutory public exhibitions, some attendees asked about the 
provision for combined heat and power. MPL explained that this technology is 
not compatible with a Peaking Plant (see ES Appendix 5.1, Document 
Reference 6.2).  
11.5 
Post DCO Submission 
 MPL is committed to continued engagement with the local community and key 
stakeholders following submission of the DCO Application, as well as 
Consultation Report 
Millbrook Power 
 
157 
 
throughout the construction, operational and decommissioning phases of the 
Project should a DCO be granted.  
 Following submission of the DCO Application, providing it is accepted for 
examination by PINS, MPL will undertake statutory notification under s56 of the 
PA 2008. The s56 notification will include publication and advertisement of the 
accepted application, and information on how to register as an interested party 
for the purpose of involvement in the Examination process. Interested parties 
will have the opportunity to review the application, and to provide Relevant 
Representations (consultation responses) to PINS in relation to the application. 
Engagement with statutory bodies and other interested parties will continue 
through the Pre Examination and Examination periods to ensure all matters are 
addressed during that time. 
 Alongside statutory and non-statutory consultation during the Examination 
process, MPL will continue to progress any ongoing landowner negotiations with 
a view to reaching voluntary Option Agreements.     
 In the early stages of non-statutory consultation, MPL raised the possibility of a 
Community Liaison Group in which a number of respondents expressed an 
interest. Should a DCO be granted, MPL is committed to maintaining a dialogue 
with the local community through the period of construction and potentially into 
operation. MPL will maintain on-going engagement with key stakeholders, the 
local authorities and the local parish councils.

Conclusion 
 The PA 2008 sets out statutory requirements for applicants to engage in pre-
application consultation with local communities, local authorities and those who 
would be directly affected by a project.  
 This Consultation Report has been prepared in accordance with s37(7) of the 
PA 2008 and seeks to demonstrate how MPL has complied with its various 
duties under the relevant sections of the PA 2008.   
 The following provisions of the PA 2008 are relevant to statutory consultation:  
� s42: duty to consult certain categories of person;   
� s43: Local authorities for purpose of s42(1)(b); 
� s44: categories for the purposes of s42(1)(d); 
� s45 timetable for consultation under s42; 
� s46: Duty to notify the SoS of proposed application (and to provide s42 
consultation materials to the SoS); 
� s47: duty to consult the local community (people living in the vicinity of the 
land); 
� s48: duty to publicise the proposed application; and   
� s49: Duty to take account of responses to consultation and publicity.  
 MPL undertook two phases of statutory pre-application consultation, between 
13th October 2014 and 16th November 2014 (Phase 1 Statutory Consultation), 
and between 29th May 2017 and 2nd July 2017 (Phase 2 Statutory Consultation). 
Both phases aligned sections 42, 47 and 48 requirements to run in parallel 
across an extended, 35-day consultation period. 
 Under s42, the bodies prescribed by Schedule 1 of the APFP Regulations, local 
authorities under s43 of the PA 2008, and those who fall under s44 of the PA 
2008, were consulted about the proposed application.  The full list of s42 parties 
is included as Appendix 3.N for the Phase 1 Consultation, and Appendix 3.O for 
the Phase 2 Consultation. The s42 information sent out to each consultee is set 
out in section 6 and section 8 of this Consultation Report, and included the 
preliminary findings of the EIA (in the form of the 2014 PEIR and the 2017 
PEIR).  
 MPL undertook non-statutory engagement with CBC and BBC throughout the 
phased consultation; early engagement was used to inform the development of 
the Project's first Statement of Community Consultation (i.e. the Phase 1 
SoCC).  This Phase 1 SoCC set out how MPL would consult with the local 
community under s47 of the PA 2008. BBC and CBC were given 28 days to

 Due to the Project being ‘on hold’ for a period following the 2014/2015 
consultation MPL produced a second SoCC (Phase 2 SoCC) ahead of the 2017 
statutory consultation (Phase 2 Consultation). CBC and BBC were consulted on 
the Phase 2 SoCC (Appendix 2.E) and given 28 days in which to provide 
comment on MPL’s proposed approach to the Phase 2 Consultation. The final 
copy of the Phase 2 SoCC and SoCC Notice were made available from 8th May 
2017. 
 In accordance with s48 of the PA 2008, notices publicising the Project were 
published once in the London Gazette, once in a national newspaper (The 
Independent- Phase 1 Consultation and The Times - Phase 2 Consultation) and 
twice in local newspapers (Bedford Times & Citizen, Bedfordshire on Sunday).

 On behalf of the SoS, PINS received a copy of the information and 
documentation that MPL were consulting on, ahead of the Phase 1 and Phase 
2 statutory consultation periods. These submissions were in accordance with 
s46 of the PA 2008.  
 The requirements of the PA 2008 have been more than met by the programme 
of non-statutory and statutory consultation undertaken by the applicant. 
 The feedback received throughout both the non-statutory and statutory 
consultation phases has been analysed according to the themes that are 
represented by the comments received. Where a comment covers more than 
one theme, this has been accounted for. Where relevant, the detailed content 
of the comments received is also discussed.  
 Sections 6, 7, 8 and 9 of this Consultation Report explains how MPL's 
engagement and consultation influenced the development of the Project. Table 
12.1 highlights the key outputs generated by the various consultation responses 
received, and how these correspond to the various development stages of the 
Project (being construction, operation and maintenance and decommissioning) 
(the 'key project decisions'). 
 This Report demonstrates that the Project generated significant levels of 
interest and participation from a broad spectrum of consultees.  Furthermore, 
and importantly, many of the most significant design and Project decisions, 
summarised in Table 12.1, were either directly or indirectly influenced by 
consultation. 
 MPL has taken seriously its obligations under the PA 2008 regarding 
consultation and has delivered both Phase 1 and Phase 2 consultation in 
accordance with the requirements of that Act. This Consultation Report provides 
details of: 
a. what has been done in compliance with sections 42, 46, 47 and 48 of the 
PA 2008 in relation to the DCO Application; 
b. the relevant responses received; and 
c. 
the account taken of the relevant responses received (MPL has also set out 
how it has had regard to non-statutory consultation responses, as well as 
those received as part of its statutory consultation). 
 MPL looks forward to continuing to engage with the local community, relevant 
local authorities, statutory consultees and those with an interest in the land as 
its DCO Application for the Project moves forward.
