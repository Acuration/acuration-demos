1. INTRODUCTION    
 
1.1 
This document provides information on Millbrook Power Limited (MPL), the applicant for 
The Millbrook Power (Gas Fired Power Station) Order (the Order).  MPL is applying to 
the Secretary of State for Business, Energy and Industrial Strategy, (SoS) under the 
Planning Act 2008 (PA 2008) for powers to construct, operate and maintain an up to 
299 MW gas fired peaking power generation plant. 
1.2 
The Project would comprise: 
� a new Power Generation Plant in the form of an Open Cycle Gas Turbine (OCGT) 
peaking power generating station, fuelled by natural gas with a rated electrical output 
of up to 299 MW.  This is the output of the generating station as a whole, measured 
at the terminals of the generating equipment. The Power Generation Plant 
comprises: 
- generating equipment including one Gas Turbine Generator with one exhaust gas 
flue stack and Balance of Plant (together referred to as the ‘Generating 
Equipment’), which are located within the ‘Generating Equipment Site’; 
- a new purpose built access road from Green Lane to the Generating Equipment 
Site (the ‘Access Road’ or the ‘Short Access Road’);  
- a temporary construction compound required during construction only (the 
‘Laydown Area’); 
� a new underground gas pipeline connection, approximately 1.8 km in length (the 
‘Pipeline’) to bring natural gas to the Generating Equipment from the National 
Transmission System (the ‘Gas Connection’). The Gas Connection also incorporates 
an Above Ground Installation (AGI) at the point of connection to the National 
Transmission System; and 
� a new electrical connection to export power from the Generating Equipment to the 
National Grid Electricity Transmission System (NETS) (the ‘Electrical Connection’), 
comprising an underground double circuit Tee-in. This would require one new tower 
(which will replace an existing tower and be located in the existing Grendon – 
Sundon transmission route corridor, thereby resulting in no net additional towers). 
This option would require two SECs, one located on each side of the existing 
transmission line, and both circuits would then be connected via underground cables 
approximately 500 m in length to a new substation (the ‘Substation’). 
1.3 
The Generating Equipment, Access Road and Laydown Area are together known as the 
‘Power Generation Plant’ and are located within the ‘Power Generation Plant Site’. The 
Power Generation Plant Site is approximately 12.5 ha in area.  
1.4 
The Power Generation Plant, Gas Connection, and Electrical Connection, together with 
all access requirements are referred to as the ‘Project’. The land upon which the Project 
would be developed, or which would be required in order to facilitate the development of 
the Project, is referred to as the ‘Project Site’. The Project Site is approximately 48 ha in 
area. The Project is described in more detail in Chapter 3. 
  
 
3 
 
1.5 
The Project is proposed at and in the vicinity of the 
former clay extraction pit at Rookery South, near 
Stewartby, Bedfordshire. The boundary of the Project Site falls within both Central 
Bedfordshire Council (CBC) and Bedford Borough Council (BBC) areas.  
1.6 
The Generating Equipment, Access Road and Laydown Area are together known as the 
"Power Generation Plant", and are located within the Power Generation Plant Site.  
1.7 
The Power Generation Plant, Gas Connection, and Electrical Connection, together with 
all access requirements are referred to as the “Project” and are all required for the 
generation of electricity and subsequent export of that electricity to the NETS. The land 
upon which the Project would be developed, or which would be required in order to 
facilitate the development of the Project, is referred to as the “Project Site”. 
1.8 
The Project, comprising an electricity generating plant with an average gross electrical 
output in excess of 50 MWe, falls within the definition of a Nationally Significant 
Infrastructure Project (NSIP) under Section 15(2)(c) of the PA 2008. It is, therefore, 
necessary for MPL to apply to the SoS for a Development Consent Order (DCO) to 
construct, operate and maintain the Project under Section 31 of the Act.   
1.9 
Background information on the DCO application process is provided below.   
1.10 
This document also identifies the suite of documents that comprise the application (the 
"Application") that MPL has submitted to the SoS for a DCO (i.e. the Order) in respect of 
the Project. The Application is made pursuant to Section 37 of the PA 2008.   
2. 
PROJECT DETAILS  
2.1 
MPL is seeking to develop the Project at and in the vicinity of Rookery South Pit located 
near Stewartby, Bedfordshire.   
2.2 
A brief description of the elements that comprise the Project is set out below. More 
detail on these elements can be found in Section 3 Chapter 3 of the Environmental 
Statement (ES) (Document Reference 6.1).   
Generating Equipment 
2.3 
To generate up to 299 MWe, one Gas Turbine Generator would be used, with an 
emission flue stack which would be between 32.5 m and 35 m in height. The Generating 
Equipment would further be composed of; an electrical transformer compound, a natural 
gas receiving station n emergency generator, water tanks, control room, fin-fan coolers 
and support buildings and structures. The location of the Power Generation Plant is 
shown on the Land Plans (Document Reference 2.5) and the various components that 
comprise the Power Generation Plant are shown on the Works Plans (Document 
Reference 2.6).  
Electrical Connection 
2.4 
To function, the Generating Equipment requires an electrical connection to export the 
electricity generated to the NETS. The Electrical Connection would comprise all the 
necessary elements to enable power to be exported from the Generating Equipment to 
 
4 
 
the NETS, such as a new substation (the ‘Substation’), 
a new underground electrical connection and Sealing 
End Compounds (SECs).  
2.5 
This comprises one underground 400kV double circuit Tee-in, requiring one new 
transmission tower, which would replace an existing tower, and be located in the 
existing Grendon – Sundon transmission route corridor, therefore resulting in no net 
additional towers. The Electrical Connection would also require two SECs, which will be 
located on either side of the existing transmission line.  Underground cables would be 
approximately 500 m in length buried in four trenches typically 5 m apart, to a new 
substation.   
2.6 
The Electrical Connection would be constructed, owned and operated by NGET.   
Laydown Area 
2.7 
A temporary Laydown Area for the storage of plant and equipment during construction 
would be provided adjacent to the Generating Equipment Site. 
Access Road 
2.8 
Permanent access to the Generating Equipment and Substation would be required for 
construction and operation. An agricultural access track is already in existence at the 
Project Site, linking Green Lane to Rookery South Pit. On reaching Rookery South Pit, 
the Access Road (Work no. 2A) would use an access ramp to enter into Rookery South 
Pit and cross through the base of the pit until it reaches the Generating Equipment Site. 
The Access Road would be constructed along the route of the existing agricultural 
access track and would be constructed of tarmac bordered by a concrete kerb. It would 
be 6 m wide allowing for two-way traffic.  
2.9 
The Covanta RRF Project also includes provision to upgrade this track to a tarmac road. 
Should this road be developed as part of the Covanta RRF Project prior to the 
development of this Project, it would be suitable to meet both the needs of the Project 
and the Covanta RRF Project. In this instance, there would be a requirement for a short 
section of new Access Road (‘Short Access Road’) (Work no. 2B) of up to 1.4 km in 
length connecting the end of the Covanta RRF road to the Generating Equipment Site. 
Gas Connection 
2.10 
The Gas Connection (Work Nos. 3 and 4) would bring natural gas to the Generating 
Equipment from the existing high pressure gas NTS feeder 9, east of the Millbrook 
Proving Ground approximately 1.45 km south of the Generating Equipment Site.  The 
Gas Connection would be composed of an AGI comprising of a Pipeline Instrumentation 
Gauge (PIG) Trap Facility alongside a Minimum Offtake Connection (MOC), and an 
approximately 1.8 km long gas pipeline laid to the gas receiving station in the 
Generating Equipment Site.      
2.11 
The MOC would be constructed, owned and operated by National Grid Gas while the 
PIG Trap Facility would be constructed, owned and operated by MPL. 
2.12 
Schedule 1 to the draft Order (Document Reference 3.1) sets out the formal description 
of the Project.  This description is shown on the Works Plan (Document Reference 2.6).  
 
5 
 
2.13 
In addition to seeking consent in the Order for the 
Project, MPL is also seeking compulsory acquisition 
powers in order to acquire land, the temporary use of land, permanent new rights, 
impose restrictions and to suspend and/or extinguish rights, restrictions, easements or 
servitudes in order to facilitate the construction and operation (including maintenance) 
of the Project. The Land Plans (Document Reference 2.5) show the land to be acquired, 
the land to be used temporarily, the land over which new rights are to be acquired and 
restrictions imposed and the land in relation to which it is proposed to suspend and/or 
extinguish rights, restrictions, easements or servitudes.  The Book of Reference 
(Document Reference 4.3) describes this land in more detail and the Statement of 
Reasons (Document Reference 4.1) explains why compulsory purchase powers are 
being sought in the Order.   
2.14 
Consultation on the Project has been carried out by MPL since May 2014, taking the 
form of multiple stages of non-statutory consultation and two phases of statutory 
consultation.  At all stages, MPL has consulted regularly with Central Bedfordshire 
Council and Bedford Borough Council, being the host authorities for the Project, as well 
as key stakeholders.  In addition, MPL has actively engaged with landowners and those 
interested in the land affected by the Project.  The Consultation Report (Document 
Reference 5.1) details the consultation carried out on the Project, the results of that 
consultation and how MPL has had regard to the consultation in finalising its proposals 
for the Project.    
3. 
THE APPLICANT   
3.1 
MPL is the applicant for the Project. MPL is registered in England (Company Number 
08920458) and is a wholly owned subsidiary of Drax Group plc (Drax), Company 
Number 05562053.  
3.2 
MPL’s registered office is at Drax Power Station, Drax, Selby, North Yorkshire, United 
Kingdom, YO8 8PH. 
3.3

4. 
THE DCO PRE-APPLICATION AND CONSENTING PROCESS       
4.1 
As stated above at paragraph 1.6, the Project, comprising an electricity generating plant 
with an average electrical output in excess of 50 MWe, is an NSIP and therefore 
requires a DCO under the PA 2008.  Accordingly, MPL has carried out pre-application 
consultation on the Project in accordance with Part 5, Chapter 2 of the PA 2008 
including the consultation required under Sections 42, 47 and 48 and the notification 
and other duties under the PA 2008 and applicable Regulations. In addition, MPL has 
had regard to and complied with relevant guidance issued by the SoS and the Planning 
Inspectorate in carrying out its pre-application consultation. The Application is 
accompanied by a Consultation Report (Document Reference 5.1) which explains the 
pre-application consultation carried out as well as the regard that MPL has had to 
consultation responses in formulating the Application.   
4.2 
The Application seeks powers to construct, operate and maintain the Project as well as 
powers to compulsorily acquire land, rights and other interests in order to facilitate the 
construction, operation and maintenance of the Project.  The draft Order (Document 
Reference 3.1) contains these powers, which are explained in the Explanatory 
Memorandum (Document Reference 3.2).   
4.3 
Applications for DCOs are made to the Planning Inspectorate, which examines and then 
reports on the proposals to the relevant SoS.  In the case of the Project, the Planning 
Inspectorate will examine the Project and report (together with a recommendation) to 
the Secretary of State for Business, Energy and Industrial Strategy, who will then decide 
whether or not to make the DCO.   
 
7 
 
4.4 
Further information on the processes that the Planning 
Inspectorate follows after submission of the Application 
by MPL is provided in section 0 below.  Reference should also be made to the 
information 
on 
the 
Planning 
Inspectorate's 
website 
(http://infrastructure.planningportal.gov.uk/).   
5. 
THE APPLICATION DOCUMENTS AND THEIR COMPLIANCE WITH LEGISLATIVE 
REQUIREMENTS 
5.1 
Table 1 below provides a guide to the documents that MPL is submitting as part of this 
Application. As well as providing a list of the main application documents, it also 
identifies where documents are submitted in order to comply with a relevant legislative 
or policy requirement.   
5.2 
The legislative requirements for applications for a DCO are principally contained in the 
PA 2008, and the following regulations: 
5.2.1 
The Infrastructure Planning (Applications: Prescribed Forms and Procedure) 
Regulations 2009 (as amended) (the ‘APFP Regulations’); and  
5.2.2 
The Infrastructure Planning (Environmental Impact Assessment) Regulations 
20091 (the ‘EIA Regulations’).  
5.3 
Regulation 5 in the APFP Regulations sets out the documents that all development 
consent applications must include and Regulation 6 sets out the documents that 
particular types of development consent applications must include – those relating to 
generating stations are relevant to the Project. References in Table 1 below such as 
"Reg. 5(2)(b)" are to the APFP Regulations and those such as "S.37(3)(c)" are to the 
PA 2008.  
5.4 
Regulation 5 of the APFP Regulations includes a category described as "any other 
documents considered necessary to support the application" (Reg. 5(2)(q)). Similarly, 
Regulation 5 also allows MPL to submit other plans, drawings and sections which are 
necessary to describe the Project (Reg. 5(2)(o)). The documents provided by MPL and 
marked as relating to those two paragraphs of the APFP Regulations are therefore not 
statutorily required but are those which MPL considers necessary to support the 
Application.  
5.5 
The Application submitted for the Project complies with the requirements of the PA 
2008, the APFP Regulations, the EIA Regulations and applicable SoS and Planning 
Inspectorate guidance, including in particular Planning Inspectorate Advice Note 6 
(Preparation and submission of application documents, Republished October 2014).    
 
 
 
                                                      
1Note: The Project falls under the EIA Regulations 2009 regime and not the Infrastructure Planning (Environmental Impact Assessment) 
Regulations 2017 (the "EIA Regulations 2017") regime. This is because a scoping opinion was requested from the Secretary of State under the 
EIA Regulations 2009 before the commencement of the EIA Regulations 2017. This means that, in accordance with the transitional 
arrangements at Regulation 37(2)(a)(ii) of the EIA Regulations 2017, the EIA Regulations 2009 will continue to apply to the Project.

THE DCO APPLICATION AND EXAMINATION PROCESS  
6.1 
After MPL has submitted the Application, the process for considering it is outlined as 
follows:  
6.1.1 
The Planning Inspectorate has 28 days from the date that the Application is 
made to decide whether to accept it for examination. 
6.1.2 
Following acceptance by the Planning Inspectorate, MPL will carry out its post-
acceptance consultation and notification duties. This includes site notice and 
advertisements in a local newspaper, a national newspaper and the London 
Gazette, all confirming certain details including that the Application has been 
accepted and how representations can be made about it, as well as notices to 
various statutory consultees. 
6.1.3 
The Planning Inspectorate will then appoint one or more 'examining inspectors' 
(known as the examining authority) to examine the Application. The examining 
authority will consider the Application documents and the representations and 
invite all parties to attend a ‘preliminary meeting’, setting out what the examining 
authority considers to be the principal issues relating to the Project, and a draft 
timetable for examining it. 
6.1.4 
At or before the preliminary meeting, participants may make submissions about 
how the Application should be examined. The preliminary meeting does not 
consider issues of substance relating to the Application. 
6.1.5 
Following the preliminary meeting, the examining authority will issue an 
examination timetable and it is also likely to issue an initial set of written 
questions. The timetable will give details of deadlines for submitting written 
representations, commenting on others’ representations, answering the 
examining authorities' questions and commenting on others’ answers.  Hearings 
may be scheduled at this point, or these may be programmed at a later time, 
and further questions and requests for information may be issued by the 
examining authority. Further information on participating in the examination of 
the Application can be found on the Planning Inspectorate's website including in 
the Advice Notes it has issued. 
6.1.6 
The examination period (which includes the submission of all written material as 
well as holding hearings and site visits) starts from the date of the preliminary 
meeting and must take no more than six months. This can only be extended 
with the authorisation of the SoS. 
6.1.7 
Following the end of the six-month examination period, the examining authority 
must submit a report to the SoS within three months, who then has a further 
three months to determine the Application. 
6.1.8 
Bedford Borough Council and Central Bedfordshire Council have a very 
important role to play in the DCO process. They will be invited by the Planning 
Inspectorate to comment on the quality of MPL's consultation process, to 
 
19 
 
produce a Local Impact Report on the Project and to make their own 
representations to the Planning Inspectorate on the Application.  
6.1.9 
MPL welcomes correspondence from interested parties in relation to the Project 
- questions relating to the examination process should be directed to the 
Planning Inspectorate.
