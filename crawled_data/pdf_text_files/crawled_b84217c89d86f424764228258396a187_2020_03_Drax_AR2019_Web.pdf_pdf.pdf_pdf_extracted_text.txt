lower cost energy future
Welcome to Drax Group
Our purpose is to  
enable a zero carbon,  
lower cost energy future. 
Our ambition is to become carbon negative by 2030. Being carbon 
negative means that we will be removing more carbon dioxide from 
the atmosphere than we produce throughout our operations – 
creating a negative carbon footprint for the company
Our strategic aims are:
To build a long-term 
future for biomass
Building on our world class expertise,  
we believe biomass can deliver carbon 
negative dispatchable renewable energy.
To be the leading 
provider of power 
system stability
Through a portfolio of dispatchable 
flexible assets and new technologies – 
ours and our customers’ – we will support 
the system and decarbonise through the 
growth of intermittent renewable energy.
To give our customers 
control of their energy

Chair’s statement
Introduction 
Drax Group’s purpose is to enable a  
zero carbon, lower cost energy future. 
Since 2012 Drax has reduced its reported 
carbon emissions by over 85%. In 
December, we took a step further and 
announced an ambition to become 
carbon negative by 2030. With the  
right support and negative emissions 
framework from the UK Government,  
we believe we can realise this ambition. 
Through these activities we expect to 
play a major role in delivering the UK’s 
legally binding objective to become 
carbon neutral by 2050.
The Group’s purpose informs our strategy 
through which we aim to build a long-
term future for sustainable biomass, 
become the leading provider of system 
stability in the UK and give customers 
control of their energy.
In 2019 we continued to make good 
progress in delivering this strategy. In 
doing so we are delivering higher quality 
earnings, reducing commodity exposure 
and creating opportunities for growth 
aligned with the UK’s carbon neutral 
agenda. 
Biomass has a long-term role to play in  
the UK and global energy markets as a 
flexible and sustainable source of 
renewable energy, as well as a means  
to deliver negative emissions. Key to 
securing this long-term role is reducing 
the cost of biomass. We aim to increase 
biomass self-supply to five million tonnes 
by 2027, which we believe will drive 
significant cost reduction and attractive 
returns to shareholders. We have made 
good progress in 2019 and will continue to 
implement measures to reduce costs and 
develop expansion opportunities in 2020. 
The Group is working with a range of 
partner organisations to outline a plan for 
the decarbonisation of the Humber area. 
This is an industrial area in the northeast 
of England with one of the highest levels 
of CO2 emissions, making it a natural  
and cost-effective location for the 
deployment of carbon capture and 
storage, using Bioenergy with Carbon 
Capture and Storage (BECCS) at Drax 
Power Station. Through these initiatives 
we hope to deliver long-term benefits to  
a wide range of stakeholders and support 
the UK’s transition to net zero.
This is one example of how our 
engagement with stakeholders is an 
enabler to the delivery of our strategy.  
On pages 24 to 29 of the Annual Report, 
we provide further detail on our 
stakeholders and how members of the 
Board, including Non-Executive Directors, 
have participated in discussions and 
sought to understand views in order  
to inform decision making.
Drax Power Station is the UK’s largest 
single source of renewable electricity, 
providing 11% of the total. During 2019  
the Generation business managed a 
programme of major planned outages. 
The business also optimised biomass 
operations to reflect weather-related 
Investment case
• Critical to decarbonisation 
of the UK’s energy system 
and a major source of 
flexible, low carbon and 
renewable power from  
a nationwide portfolio of 
generation technologies
• Underlying growth in  
the core business and 
attractive investment 
opportunities
• Increasing earnings 
visibility, reducing 
commodity exposure
• Strong financial position 
and clear capital  
allocation plan
 
We continue to 
advance our 
purpose of enabling 
a zero carbon, lower 
cost energy future.”

biomass supply chain constraints. Over 
the same period coal generation has 
reduced, reflecting challenging market 
conditions. Following a comprehensive 
review of operations and discussions  
with National Grid, Ofgem and the UK 
Government, the Board of Drax has 
determined to end commercial coal 
generation at Drax Power Station. Drax 
will shortly commence a consultation 
process with employees and trade unions 
with a view to ending coal operations in 
September 2022. Under these proposals, 
commercial generation from coal will end 
in March 2021 but the two coal units will 
remain available to meet Capacity Market 
obligations until September 2022.
In December 2018 we completed the 
acquisition of a portfolio of hydro and gas 
generation assets from ScottishPower, 
making Drax the fourth largest electricity 
generator in the UK and a leading provider 
of system support services. During 2019 
we successfully integrated these assets 
into our generation portfolio. The assets 
have performed strongly, with returns 
significantly ahead of the Group’s cost  
of capital.
Following weather-restricted production 
in the first quarter of 2019, our US Pellet 
Production business produced at full 
capacity. Our focus remains on the 
production of good quality and low-cost 
biomass. Although pellet quality improved 
in 2019, it was below the level we expect 
and we are focused on delivering further 
improvements during 2020.
In our Customers business, which 
supplies electricity and gas to business 
customers, we made progress reducing 
cost, increased the margin per MWh and 
installed more smart meters year-on-year. 
However, in a challenging market 
financial performance was below the 
level we expect and we have more work 
to do to realise the opportunities we 
continue to see in this area. During 2019 
we consolidated the management team 
at Haven Power and Opus Energy into a 
single integrated team. We expect this 
new structure to improve operational 
efficiency.
Results and dividend
Adjusted EBITDA in 2019 of £410 million 
grew by 64% compared to 2018 (£250 
million). This reflects high levels of 
renewable power generation from 
sustainable biomass, a strong 
performance from the hydro and gas 
generation businesses, as well as 
continued growth in our Pellet 
Production business.
At the 2019 half year results we 
confirmed an interim dividend of 
£25 million (6.4 pence per share). The 
Board proposes to pay a final dividend in 
respect of 2019 of £38 million, equivalent 
to 9.5 pence per share, making the full 
year 2019 dividend £63 million (15.9 pence 
per share) (2018: £56 million, 14.1 pence 
per share). This represents a 13% increase 
on 2018 and is consistent with our policy 
to pay a dividend which is sustainable and 
expected to grow as the strategy delivers 
stable earnings, strong cash flows and 
opportunities for growth.
The Group has a clear capital allocation 
policy which it has applied throughout 
2019. In determining the rate of growth  
in dividends from one year to the next the 
Board will take account of contracted cash 
flows, the less predictable cash flows from 
the Group’s commodity based business 
and future investment opportunities. If 
there is a build-up of capital, the Board will 
consider the most appropriate mechanism 
to return this to shareholders.
Governance and values
Sustainability is at the heart of the Group 
and its culture. It covers the sustainable 
sourcing of biomass, which is a core 
principle of the Group, and also long-term 
sustainability. This means achieving  
a positive economic, social and 
environmental impact and considering 
long, medium and short-term factors  
in our stewardship of the business.
We are committed to promoting the UN 
Global Compact principles on respect  
for human rights, labour rights, the 
environment and anti-corruption.
Our aim is to maintain an open and 
collaborative culture across the Group. 
Setting the right standards helps to 
protect the business and the interests of 
our stakeholders. We remain committed 
to the highest standards of corporate 
governance, and the Board and its 
committees play an active role in guiding 
the Company and leading its strategy. 
In 2019 we saw several changes to the 
Board, including the appointment of Andy 
Skelton as Chief Financial Officer (CFO). 
Andy is highly experienced, having 
previously served as CFO at Fidessa 
Group plc. 
We greatly value the contribution made by 
our Non-Executive Directors and during a 
time of growth their role remains especially 
important. David Lindsell, Tony Thorne 
and Tim Cobbold each stepped down, and 
I would like to thank all three for their very 
significant contributions to the Board 
and the stewardship of the business.
John Baxter joined the Board in April 2019 
and brings a wealth of industry, 
engineering and safety management 
expertise. 
Our people 
Our people – employees and contractors 
– remain a key asset of the business and 
we are focused on creating a diverse and 
inclusive working environment that is 
both safe and supportive. 
We recognise the importance of listening 
to employees to understand their concerns 
and act on them. To that end, in 2019,  
we established an enhanced programme 
of workforce engagement to improve 
communication and feedback between 
the Board, senior management and our 
workforce. Together with Will Gardiner, 
our CEO, I participated in meetings with 
the chairs of our newly established 
engagement forums. More information 
on this can be found on page 28.
Safety is a long-held and central 
commitment of our operational 
philosophy. While the number of incidents 
is low, we need to remain vigilant and 
work to reduce them. We are committed 
to the highest standards and have 
continued our efforts to strengthen our 
approach to health, safety and wellbeing 
governance across the Group.
To conclude, in 2019 we delivered strong 
financial performance and made good 
progress with our strategic objectives. I 
look forward to building on these in 2020. 
Through this strategy we will deliver 
sustainable long-term value, support the 
communities in which we operate and 
realise our purpose of enabling a zero 
carbon, lower cost energy future.

Group CEO’s review
2019 was an important year for Drax 
Group. Following the acquisition of the 
hydro and gas generation assets from 
ScottishPower in December 2018, we  
are now the UK’s fourth largest generator, 
meeting 5% of its power requirements, 
and generating 12% of the country’s 
renewable power.
In 2019, we continued to advance our 
purpose of enabling a zero carbon, lower 
cost energy future. In December 2019,  
we announced a world first ambition  
to become a carbon negative company  
by 2030, removing more CO2 from the 
atmosphere than we put into it. We have 
made significant progress towards that 
goal, as the carbon emissions from the 
Group have reduced by over 85% since 
2012. We now expect to take this a step 
further with the end of commercial coal 
generation in 2021 and the formal closure 
of the coal units in 2022. For more 
information on this please see page 118. 
The safety and wellbeing of our 
workforce is paramount to the Group.  
We continue to invest in the systems, 
governance and training to keep our 
workforce and assets safe.
Total Recordable Incident Rate (TRIR),  
a key scorecard measure of safety, was 
0.22. This was the same as in 2018 
although behind the challenging 
scorecard target for 2019. Safety remains 
our priority and as always there is more 
we can do in our pursuit of zero incidents.
Alongside a good operational 
performance, we delivered Adjusted 
EBITDA of £410 million, an increase of 
64% on 2018. We propose to pay a 
dividend in respect of 2019 of £63 million, 
an increase of 13% on 2018. By the end of 
2019, net debt was £841 million, 1.9x net 
debt to EBITDA, ahead of target of 2.0x, 
after adjusting for deferred cash receipt 
of Capacity Market payments of 
£72 million, received in January 2020.
Purpose and Strategy
Drax’s purpose, to enable a zero carbon, 
lower cost energy future, sits at the heart 
of everything we do. We see growing 
opportunities to create value for 
shareholders as well as significant 
benefits for all stakeholders as we  
deliver that purpose.
2019 saw increasing global recognition  
of the need for urgent action to tackle 
climate change by reducing greenhouse 
gas emissions. The UK Government has 
taken a lead by putting in place legally 
binding targets to deliver net zero carbon 
emissions across the UK economy by 
2050. This is an ambitious target which 
can only be delivered with action and 
investment now.
We are playing a key role in this 
transformation. The CO2 emissions at Drax 
Power Station were less than one million 
tonnes for the first time, a 97% reduction 
since 2012, and it is now the UK’s largest 
source of renewable power generation.

  Group Financial Review 
page 14
This was achieved through our continued 
focus on renewable biomass combined 
with operational excellence and innovative 
engineering.
While others target net zero, in December 
2019, Drax became the first company  
in the world to announce an ambition  
to become carbon negative by 2030 – 
removing CO2 from the atmosphere  
using Bioenergy with Carbon Capture  
and Storage (BECCS) to safely capture 
and store CO2 at scale. 
In May 2019 the UK Committee on 
Climate Change published its pathway  
for how the UK can deliver net zero 
carbon emissions by 2050. It highlighted 
the need for BECCS. Drax is in a leading 
position to deliver BECCS at scale in  
the UK and provide as much as a third  
of the negative emissions the UK will 
require. We believe we can deliver the 
engineering solution, but our ambition 
also requires the right regulatory 
framework and policy support to 
underpin an investment decision.
To support that process, in May 2019  
we joined with National Grid and Equinor 
to advocate for a framework to support 
the development of a carbon cluster in 
the Humber region, one of the most 
carbon intensive areas of the UK. This 
programme is called Zero Carbon Humber.
The Group’s purpose informs the three 
pillars of our strategy (i) to build a 
long-term future for biomass, (ii) to be the 
leading provider of power system stability 
and (iii) to give our customers control of 
their energy. 
In 2019 we continued to make good 
progress delivering our purpose and 
strategy. Through addressing UK energy 
needs, and those of our customers, our 
strategy is designed to deliver excellent 
long-term financial performance across 
the Group. In doing so we are reducing 
our historic exposure to commodity 
markets and delivering higher quality 
earnings, strong cash generation, 
increased dividends to shareholders  
and further opportunities for growth.
A good example of this is the successful 
integration of a generation portfolio of 
flexible, low-carbon and renewable hydro 
and gas generation assets acquired in 
December 2018. Our expanded asset base 
has improved the risk profile of the Group 
and provided more opportunities to deliver 
system support services to the UK energy 
market. Our expected EBITDA from these 
assets was £90-£110 million and they  
have delivered £114 million of high-quality 
earnings, with financial returns 
significantly ahead of the Group’s cost  
of capital.
As part of our strategy to deliver a 
long-term future for sustainable biomass, 
in November 2019, we announced plans 
to expand our supply chain to self-supply 
five million tonnes of biomass to our 
generation business by 2027. In 2019  
we self-supplied 1.4 million tonnes. We 
expect this expansion to be delivered 
through existing sites, new developments 
and a wider fuel envelope of sustainable 
biomass. Through these initiatives we 
expect to reduce the cost of biomass 
from around £75/MWh to £50/MWh by 
2027, assuming an exchange rate of 
$1.45/£. This is a level at which we believe 
renewable electricity from biomass can 
be economic without the current support 
mechanisms.
These activities, alongside the 
development of a biomass trading 
capability, could enable Drax to develop 
an unsubsidised biomass generation 
business by 2027, with the option to 
service wood pellet demand in Europe, 
North America and Asia.
Summary of 2019
Overall performance of the Group and  
its business units is measured as part  
of our Group Scorecard which covers a 
combination of financial, environmental, 
social and governance issues. The 
Group’s score in 2019 was 0.9, with a 
score of 1.0 being on target.
Adjusted EBITDA, a key financial KPI, of 
£410 million represents a 64% increase on 
2018. This includes £78 million of Capacity 
Market income in respect of the whole of 
2019 and the last two months of 2018. 
Despite challenging weather conditions  
in early 2019, Pellet Production increased 
output across the full year from 1.35 million 
tonnes to 1.40 million tonnes. At the same 
time, the cost of producing and delivering 
wood pellets to our port facility at Baton 
Rouge reduced from $166/tonne in 2018 
to $161/tonne in 2019, although challenges 
remain in terms of pellet quality.
In Generation, the integration and 
performance of the acquired assets  
was a success. At Drax Power Station  
we managed lower levels of biomass 
availability, which restricted generation  
in early 2019. By optimising biomass 
generation under the Renewables 
Obligation (RO) scheme we were able  
to partially offset the constraint by 
producing higher levels of biomass 
generation later in the year, particularly 
December, in which we reported record 
monthly renewable generation. The 
business also completed a programme  
of major planned outages across the 
portfolio. 
In our Customers business, which 
supplies electricity and gas to business 
customers, we have made progress 
reducing cost, however performance 
elsewhere has been below our 
expectation. This in part reflects a 
challenging market and we have more 
work to do to deliver the opportunities  
we continue to see in this area.
 
Our ambition is to 
become a carbon 
negative company 
by 2030.”

Group CEO’s review continued
A co-location agreement with Hunt 
Forest Products (a sawmill operator) led 
to the development of a sawmill next to 
our LaSalle site. The sawmill commenced 
production in February 2019 providing 
greater access to low-cost sawmill 
residues, lower transportation costs  
and a reduction in the number of stages 
in the production process.
A new rail spur linking LaSalle to the 
regional rail network and our port facility 
at Baton Rouge was commissioned in 
May 2019. This will increase 
transportation efficiency, provide 
economies of scale and reduce both  
cost and carbon footprint. 
We expect to benefit from further 
economies of scale in rail associated  
with the commissioning of an enlarged 
chambering yard at the port of Baton 
Rouge in 2020, allowing 80-car train  
sets to operate from our LaSalle and 
Morehouse sites.
These initiatives and others have 
contributed to a year-on-year reduction in 
cost per tonne of 3%, which represents a 
saving of $5 per tonne compared to 2018. 
We expect to deliver further savings  
by expanding our existing sites (LaSalle, 
Morehouse and Amite) by 350,000 
tonnes over the next two years – an 
investment of £50 million. This will 
expand total capacity to 1.85Mt, provide 
economies of scale and allow greater 
utilisation of low-cost residues. We 
believe these projects offer returns 
significantly ahead of the Group’s cost of 
capital, with payback in advance of 2027.
These larger projects are accompanied  
by small operational improvements such 
as greater efficiency in the loading of 
road haulage, saving 50 cents per tonne. 
Over time these improvements, when 
applied across the supply chain, can 
deliver significant incremental savings.
Taking the savings in 2019 together with 
the other initiatives we have described, 
we believe there are opportunities to 
reduce the cost of biomass by $35 per 
tonne (£13/MWh) on our existing portfolio 
by 2022. This represents good progress, 
but more work and investment will be 
required to deliver our goal of making 
biomass power generation economically 
During the year we completed the 
refinancing of the funding used to 
acquire the hydro and gas generation 
assets. These new facilities extend the 
Group’s debt maturity profile to 2029, 
incorporating a £125 million 
Environmental, Social and Governance 
(ESG) facility with a mechanism that 
adjusts the interest margin based on 
Drax’s carbon emissions against an 
annual benchmark. We believe we are 
one of the first companies to implement 
such a feature within its debt, 
demonstrating our commitment to 
embedding ESG in financial performance. 
The Group’s cost of debt is now below  
4% and below 3% on the new facilities, 
reflecting a reduced business risk.
Operational review
In the US, our Pellet Production 
operations reported Adjusted EBITDA  
of £32 million up 52% (2018: £21 million). 
High levels of rainfall in the US Gulf in 
early 2019 restricted the level of 
commercial forest extraction and the 
availability of low-cost fibre for wood 
pellet production. This in turn had an 
impact on the shipment of pellets from 
the port of Baton Rouge. Since then 
commercial forestry processes, wood 
pellet production and shipments to the 
UK have increased. As a result, wood 
pellet volumes for 2019 were 1.40 million 
tonnes, up 4% (2018: 1.35 million tonnes).
Pellet quality, as measured by the amount 
of fines (larger particle-sized dust) in each 
cargo, is a KPI for the Group. Lower levels 
of fines result in fuel that is easier and 
safer to handle at ports and at Drax 
Power Station. The quality of the pellets 
we produced was below our target level 
in 2019 and we are taking steps to 
address this issue in 2020.
We have remained focused on 
opportunities across the supply chain  
to deliver improved operational 
performance and cost savings as part  
of our programme to reduce the cost of 
biomass to £50/MWh by 2027. We have 
made good progress with increased 
volumes, operational improvements and 
greater utilisation of low-cost fibre which 
have contributed to lower cost wood 
pellet production.
sustainable without subsidy. We expect 
to do this by using a greater proportion of 
lower cost wood residues, expanding our 
self-supply capacity to five million tonnes 
and exploring ways to expand our fuel 
envelope to include a wider range of 
sustainable low-cost biomass residues.
In Generation, Adjusted EBITDA of 
£408 million was up 76% (2018: £232 
million). This includes £114 million from 
the hydro and gas generation assets 
acquired in December 2018. These assets 
have performed strongly, exceeding  
our financial expectation in the first year 
of ownership.
Commercial availability, which measures 
the time we are available to operate in our 
markets, was 88% (2018: 89%). This was 
below our target and principally reflects 
restricted biomass generation in the first 
quarter of 2019 and gas unit outages.  
The engineering challenges associated 
with such an outage are significant and 
the completion of the work and 
recommissioning, which allowed a strong 
operational performance, is testament to 
the skill and commitment of our people.
In 2019, we completed two major planned 
biomass outages, including the first in  
a series of three high-pressure turbine 
upgrades which we expect to increase 
thermal efficiency and reduce the cost  
of biomass generation.
Notwithstanding these planned outages 
our biomass units produced 11% of the 
UK’s renewable electricity – enough to 
power four million homes. This level of 
renewable generation, combined with  
the flexibility of our expanding portfolio, 
 
We have remained 
focused on 
opportunities to

of biomass to  
£50/MWh by 2027.”

allows the Group to support the 
continued deployment of intermittent 
renewables and the UK’s plans for 
decarbonisation. 
Over the last five years the operational 
experience with biomass generation has 
been positive and we are now exploring  
a wider range of sustainable biomass 
materials. In time we believe that 
utilisation of this expanded fuel mix  
will support a reduction in the cost of 
biomass generation.
Our hydro assets, which include the 
Cruachan pumped storage power station 
as well as Lanark and Galloway hydro 
schemes, have performed strongly, 
providing flexible, renewable and low 
carbon electricity. Cruachan Power 
Station – the largest of these assets 
(440MW) – plays an important role in  
the provision of system support services 
to the UK energy market. Over 80% of 
Cruachan’s earnings are from non-
commodity sources, including Balancing 
Market activities, Ancillary Services and 
the Capacity Market.
We operate 2.0GW of Combined Cycle  
Gas Turbines (CCGT) – Damhead Creek, 
Shoreham, Rye House and Blackburn. 
These units produced 2.9TWh, 
representing around 17% of our total 
generation. The location of three of the 
four units in southeast England makes 
them well placed to provide system 
support services to the UK energy market.
During the year we completed two 
planned outages, including turbine 
repairs and interim inspection work at 
Shoreham Power Station, providing the 
option for a future turbine upgrade to 
take place.
Since the start of 2019 seasonal 
electricity prices have weakened, 
reflecting a mild winter and high levels  
of European gas storage. The market for 
coal generation has remained challenging 
and our two coal units continue to focus 
on short-term power market 
opportunities during higher demand 
periods. Coal generation of 0.6TWh 
represents 4% of the Group’s output. 
Where we sold forward volumes on a 
limited basis, weaker power prices 
allowed us to buy back some of those 
volumes at a lower price, adding margin.
The flexibility and dispatchable nature of 
our generation portfolio is an important 
source of value and was a key factor in 
our acquisition of the hydro and gas 
generation assets. Given the shift 
towards wind generation, which will 
provide the majority of the UK’s future 
electricity requirements, we anticipate  
a growing need for system support 
services. In 2019 Value from Flexibility  
(a scorecard measure of the value from 
flexible power generation, system 
support services and attractively priced 
coal fuels) was £129 million (2018: 
£79 million), which was ahead of plan, 
reflecting a 63% increase on 2018.
We believe there is a need for flexible, 
large-scale dispatchable generation, but 
this must support the UK’s target of net 
zero carbon emissions by 2050. To that 
end we continue to develop options for 
four 299MW Open Cycle Gas Turbines 
(OCGTs) and 5.4GW of CCGTs between 
Damhead Creek and Drax Power Station.
We expect the CCGTs to be among the 
most efficient assets in their class and 
hence sit high in the UK merit order, in 
addition to being available for system 
support services. The OCGTs will perform 
a system support role and meet peak 
power demand at short notice. 
An appropriate clearing price in a future 
Capacity Market will be required to 
underpin investment in new-build gas.  
We will remain disciplined through this 
process and at the most recent auction  
in January 2020 Drax did not accept a 
Capacity Market agreement for these 
projects. We remain committed to 
developing the most cost-effective capital 
programmes for all of our gas projects, 
which we believe can make them 
competitive in future capacity auctions.
Planning approval for the CCGT at Drax 
Power Station is subject to a judicial 
review and we will not participate in 
future Capacity Market auctions until  
the outcome is known.
Our Customers business, which focuses 
on B2B supply, has faced a challenging 
market environment. Taken together with 
integration costs, Adjusted EBITDA of 
£17 million is lower than prior year (2018: 
£28 million). This includes £8 million of 
investment in restructuring to integrate 
the Haven Power and Opus Energy brands 
under a single operating structure. The 
creation of a single management team  
is now complete and will help drive 
alignment of decision making, effective 
market segmentation and operational 
efficiencies. 
During the year significant focus was 
given to cash collection to address 
historic challenges associated with bad 
debt at Opus Energy. As a result we have 
seen further improvements in the 
management of bad debts during the 
period, reflected in a reduced charge  
to the income statement of £18 million 
(2018: £31 million), whilst maintaining  
a prudent level of provision.
We have a differentiated market position 
– selling purely renewable power, helping 
over 2,000 independent renewable 
generators access the market and 
developing products which will meet  
our customers’ needs. We continue to 
believe this approach will support 
long-term growth.
Over time, we expect this business, 
through efficiency and demand-side 
response, to contribute increasingly  
to balancing the power system and we 
are excited about our opportunity to 
make a difference in this area.
Biomass sustainability
Under well-established UK and European 
legislation, sustainably sourced biomass 
is a renewable source of electricity. The 
rules and the science which underpins 
this treatment are clear.
We source low-cost sawmill residues and 
forest residues, which are a by-product  
of commercial forestry processes, and 
thinnings from growing forests, which 
help improve forest stocks and forest 
health. The CO2 emissions are absorbed 
by new forest growth. We use feedstocks 
that have been shown to have no carbon 
debt associated with them.

Environmental, social and 
governance
The health, safety and wellbeing of our 
employees and contractors is vital to  
the success of the Group and remains  
our priority. We believe that a safe and 
sustainable business model is critical to 
our strategy and long-term performance. 
In 2019 we implemented a new Group-
wide approach to health, safety and 
wellbeing, as well as the establishment  
of a new Group-wide workforce 
engagement forum.
In March 2019 we published our second 
gender pay report. While the data showed 
that our businesses were in line with the 
energy sector overall, it highlighted that 
we still have work to do. 
In June 2019, we published our third 
statement on the prevention of slavery 
and human trafficking in compliance with 
the UK Modern Slavery Act (2015) and we 
are a signatory to the UN Global Compact 
(UNGC). We are committed to promoting 
the UNGC principles on respect for 
human rights, labour rights, the 
environment and anti-corruption.
Brexit
Brexit remains a key issue for the UK.  
To date, the impact on the Group has 
been limited, with the principal risk being 
weaker Sterling affecting the cost of 
biomass, which is generally denominated 
in US dollars. Through our use of medium-
term foreign exchange hedges the Group 
has protected its position out to 2024 at 
rates close to those that we saw before 
the Brexit referendum vote. 
Outlook
Our focus remains on progressing our 
strategy: to build a long-term future for 
sustainable biomass; to be the leading 
provider of system stability in the UK and 
to give customers control of their energy. 
Through achieving these strategic 
objectives we expect to deliver tangible 
financial benefits – long-term earnings 
growth, strong cash generation and 
attractive returns for our shareholders. 
These activities continue to be 
underpinned by safety, sustainability  
and operational excellence.
In Pellet Production we remain focused 
on the production of good quality pellets 
at the lowest cost, cross-supply chain 
optimisation and an expanded self-supply 
capacity to five million tonnes by 2027.
Our Generation proposition is strong: 
flexible, renewable and low carbon 
electricity and system support services. 
We will continue to provide high levels  
of renewable electricity to the UK and 
support increased deployment of 
intermittent renewables necessary  
to support the UK’s transition to a  
net zero carbon economy.
Flexible dispatchable gas has an 
important long-term role to play in 
supporting the transition to a net zero 
carbon economy. We will optimise our 
portfolio to meet this demand and 
develop carbon capture and storage 
ready projects – options which could 
include hydrogen fuelling – subject to the 
right price in future capacity auctions.
Our ambition to become a carbon 
negative company is underpinned by  
the development of BECCS. Working in 
partnership, and with the right support 
from the UK Government, we could 
develop BECCS at scale before 2030. By 
reducing our biomass supply chain cost 
we will support this objective and deliver 
further attractive returns to shareholders. 
In our Customers business we will remain 
focused on operational excellence, 
reducing our cost to serve customers, 
growing gross profit per MWh and 
managing bad debt. We will offer 
attractive propositions and develop our 
presence in the market for system support 
through flexible demand management 
and other value-added services. 
We are making good progress with the 
delivery of our strategy and will build on 
this as we achieve our targets. We will 
also continue to play an important role  
in our markets as well as realising our 
purpose of enabling a zero carbon, lower 
cost energy future for the UK.
Will Gardiner
Group CEO
We maintain a rigorous and robust 
approach to biomass sustainability, 
ensuring the wood fibre used and pellets 
produced are fully compliant with the 
UK’s mandatory sustainability standards 
as well as those of the European Union. 
Since the introduction of the Renewable 
Obligation Certificate (ROC) scheme in 
2002 Drax has maintained full compliance 
with UK and European legislation.
However, there are carbon emissions 
associated with the biomass supply 
chain. Under UK legislation biomass is  
the only source of electricity generation 
required to report its supply chain 
emissions. The Group’s biomass life cycle 
carbon emissions are 124 kgCO2-eq/MWh 
of electricity (2018: 131 kgCO2-eq/MWh), 
less than half the UK Government’s 285 
kgCO2-eq/MWh of electricity limit for 
biomass. This equates to an 87% carbon 
emission saving against coal, inclusive  
of biomass supply chain emissions, but 
excluding those of coal, which means the 
actual saving from biomass is even greater.
Reflecting this and a lower level of coal 
generation, reported carbon emissions 
under the European Union Emissions 
Trading Scheme fell by 50% to 113tCO2/
GWh (2018: 226tCO2/GWh).
Strengthening our leadership on biomass 
sustainability, we introduced a new 
Responsible Sourcing Policy for Biomass 
and established an Independent Advisory 
Board, chaired by Sir John Beddington, 
the UK’s former Chief Scientific Adviser. 
We responded to the Climate Disclosure 
Programme’s (CDP) Climate Change and 
Forests questionnaires.
 
We maintain a 
rigorous and robust 
approach to biomass 
sustainability.”

Q
How is Drax helping the 
UK reach its climate goal 
to be net zero by 2050?
We’re committed to a zero carbon, lower 
cost energy future and are stepping up 
our efforts to help the UK become net 
zero by 2050. We have already 
successfully converted two thirds of  
Drax Power Station to run on sustainable 
biomass instead of coal in what was the 
largest decarbonisation project in Europe. 
This means we’re generating 12% of the 
UK’s renewable electricity and we’ve 
reduced our carbon emissions by more 
than 85% since 2012. 
We now want to become a carbon 
negative company by 2030, which we  
can do by applying carbon capture and 
storage technology to our biomass units. 
This is known as BECCS and, through our 
BECCS pilot project at Drax Power 
Station, we have the capability to capture 
one tonne of carbon a day. With the right 
investment framework and support 
mechanisms in place, we believe we could 
capture 16 million tonnes of CO2 a year. 
Q
What are negative 
emissions and why are 
they important?
Negative emissions mean Drax will be 
removing more carbon dioxide from the 
atmosphere than it produces from its 
operations. The UK needs negative 
emissions to help offset emissions from 
sectors that are harder to decarbonise 
than transport and power, for example 
aviation and shipping. 
Both the UN’s Intergovernmental Panel 
on Climate Change and the UK’s 
Committee on Climate Change have  
said negative emissions with BECCS 
technology will be critical to limiting 
global temperature rise to 1.5 degrees. 
Q
What impact has the 
move to biomass had  
on Drax’s carbon emissions?
Biomass has been a critical element in 
the UK’s decarbonisation journey, helping 
the country get off coal much faster than 
anyone thought possible. 
Since 2012, at Drax Power Station we 
have reduced our carbon emissions  
by 97%, becoming the largest 
decarbonisation project in Europe.  
And we want to do more. 
We’ve also expanded our generation 
operations to include hydro and gas 
generation, and we’ve continued to bring 
coal off the system.
Q
What happens to the 
forests where Drax 
sources its biomass? 
Sustainable biomass from managed 
forests is helping to promote healthy 
forest growth and biodiversity as well as 
decarbonising the UK’s energy system. 
The biomass we use comes from 
sustainably managed forests that supply 
industries like construction and furniture. 
We use residues from forestry and 
sawmills, like sawdust, that other 
industries don’t use. 
The biomass that we use is renewable 
because the forests are growing and 
continue to capture more carbon than  
we emit from the power station. 
  You can read more about  
our approach to biomass 
sustainability on page 34. 
Q
Why did you decide to 
work at Drax?
I took this job because Drax had already 
made a contribution to the energy 
transition in the UK. Climate change is 
the most important challenge we face 
and I passionately believe Drax has a 
crucial role in tackling it. 
I want to use all of our capabilities to fight 
climate change. I also want to make sure 
that we listen to what everyone else has 
to say to ensure that we continue to do 
the right thing. Our people are very 
engaged on issues relating to climate 
change and I’m proud of the passion and 
innovation I see around the business.
Q
Does building gas power 
stations mean the UK 
will be tied into fossil fuels  
for decades to come?
Our energy system is changing rapidly,  
as we increase our use of wind and solar 
energy, but the wind doesn’t always blow 
and the sun doesn’t always shine, so we 
need technologies that can operate when 
needed to fill in those gaps. 
We’re looking at a range of options to 
generate power and support the 
electricity system as it decarbonises. 
These include BECCS, hydrogen and gas, 
which can help enable more renewables 
to connect to the system. 
As I said already, gas is one option we’re 
looking at but it won’t happen without 
the right investment conditions. If we do 
decide to build new natural gas plants, we 
will make sure that it is ready for carbon 
capture and storage. We will also look at 
converting the plants to run on hydrogen.

Group financial review
Introduction
The Group has delivered significant 
growth during 2019, with Adjusted 
EBITDA increasing by 64% from 
£250 million in 2018, to £410 million.
Total operating profit, which includes  
the effect of remeasurement losses of 
£133 million (2018: remeasurement gains 
of £38 million) on derivative contracts, 
also increased from £60 million in 2018  
to £62 million.
Our new portfolio of pumped storage, 
hydro and gas generation assets 
(hereafter referred to as the “new 
generation assets”), acquired on 
31 December 2018, delivered Adjusted 
EBITDA of £114 million. Growth was 
further supported by an increased 
contribution from renewable power 
generation from sustainable biomass  
at Drax Power Station and our Pellet 
Production business.
This performance is particularly pleasing 
when considering the challenges we 
faced in the first half of the year where 
both our pellet production operations  
and biomass generation were impacted 
by lower levels of biomass supply as a 
result of historically bad weather 
conditions in the US Gulf. 
Following the reinstatement of the  
UK Capacity Market in October 2019, the 
results for the year include £78 million  
of capacity market income, including 
£7 million for the period in 2018 after  
its suspension. The associated cash was

subsequently received after the year end 
and does not form part of our reported 
net debt at 31 December 2019.
The Group improved its access to  
capital during 2019. We refinanced  
the acquisition bridge facility, used to 
part-fund the acquisition in December 
2018 of the new generation assets  
from ScottishPower, in three stages.
In May, we issued an additional  
US$200 million of the existing 2025 
6.625% loan notes. In July, we entered 
into two new senior debt facility 
agreements, a £375 million private 
placement and a £125 million 
environmental, social and governance 
(ESG) facility. The average rate of the two 
new facilities is below 3%, reducing the 
Group’s overall cost of debt to below 4%, 
reflecting a reduced business risk profile.
Driven by strong cash generation in the 
period, supported by active management 
of working capital, net debt at 31 December 
2019 was £841 million (2018: £319 million), 
delivering a net debt to Adjusted EBITDA 
ratio of 1.9x, ahead of our target of 2.0x 
for the year end after adjusting for the 
deferred receipt of £72 million cash in 
respect of Capacity Market payments 
received in January 2020.
We remain committed to a sustainable 
and growing dividend. The Board will 
recommend at the forthcoming Annual 
General Meeting a final dividend that 
takes total dividends for the financial  
year to £63 million, or 15.9 pence per 
share, an increase of £7 million or 1.8 
pence per share when compared to 2018.
Financial Performance
Adjusted EBITDA 
Group consolidated Adjusted EBITDA  
of £410 million includes a contribution  
of £114 million from our new generation 
assets, acquired at the end of 2018.  
This is an excellent result and exceeds 
our forecast range of £90-£110 million, 
reflecting strong operational 
performance across the portfolio, better 
than expected performance in ancillary 
and balancing services and excellent 
progress with the integration of the 
assets into our existing generation 
business, which is now complete. 
In total, the Generation business 
contributed Adjusted EBITDA of 
£408 million (2018: £232 million), an 
increase of £176 million or 76%. This 
performance comes despite industry-
wide challenges with wood pellet 
production and associated supply 
constraints in the first half of the year, 
and includes the contribution of 
£114 million from our new generation 
assets, described above.
Following the reinstatement of the 
Capacity Market in October 2019, we 
have recognised related income totalling 
£78 million across the Generation 
portfolio. Our financial results for 2018 
excluded £7 million of capacity market 
income following its suspension in 
October 2018, and this amount has  
now been recognised in 2019.
Total output at Drax Power Station 
reduced, as we continue our transition 
away from coal; however, our biomass 
units delivered output broadly in line  
with 2018, of 13.4TWh (2018: 13.7 TWh). 
The small reduction in part reflected an 
outage over the summer period on Unit 1, 
which is supported by the Contract for 
Difference (CfD) regime.
Despite lower CfD generation, overall 
renewable support under the CfD and 
ROC regimes remained broadly in line 
with the prior period, due to higher  
ROC generation and indexation of 
support payments.
Overall captured spreads improved 
following efficiency gains as a result  
of our programme of investment in the 
performance of generating units at  
Drax Power Station and benefits from  
our trading position and portfolio.

Our Customers business contributed 
Adjusted EBITDA of £17 million in 2019,  
an £11 million reduction when compared 
to 2018.
The 2019 result for Customers includes 
£8 million of investment cost in the 
restructuring of the business, to more 
closely integrate our two brands and 
bring them under one management team 
(In 2018, £3 million of restructuring and 
integration costs were treated as 
exceptional and excluded from Adjusted 
results in the first year post-acquisition  
of Opus Energy), and a further £7 million 
for the development of next-generation  
IT systems (2018: £6 million). 
We delivered the new ERP system at 
Opus Energy during the second half  
of 2019 but have stopped the 
implementation of a new billing system 
and are in ongoing discussions with the 
supplier. We have incurred approximately 
£19 million of costs to date, held on the 
balance sheet, which we believe have 
value and will be recovered.
Overall volumes sold were down by  
9% compared to 2018, which largely 
reflects a mild 2018/19 winter that led  
to a challenging first half of the year.  
As a result, overall gross profit fell from 
£143 million in 2018 to £134 million  
in 2019. 
During the year, significant attention  
was focused on improving cash 
collections, where we have seen a 
positive performance. As a result of  
this, in addition to a £6 million benefit  
in respect of resolution of legacy credit 
balances, bad debt charges reduced  
from £31 million in 2018 to £18 million  
in 2019. The higher charge in the prior 
year reflected an increased level of 
provisioning required due to reduced 
collection performance, plus a £3 million 
one-off expense in respect of SME 
business. The closing provision at 
31 December 2019 of £41 million is  
slightly lower than the prior year (2018: 
£44 million), reflecting the improved 
performance during the year.
Pellet Production Adjusted EBITDA of 
£32 million increased 52% from £21 million 
in 2018. 
We continue to derive value from 
flexibility (balancing mechanism, ancillary 
services and advantaged fuels), which 
improved from £79 million in the prior 
year to £129 million in 2019, an increase of 
63%. Our new hydro and pumped storage 
assets performed particularly strongly  
in this area, a demonstration of the 
contribution of the acquisition to our 
strategy to become the leading provider 
of system stability in the UK.
The Generation business acquires 
biomass pellets predominantly in US 
dollars, which we actively hedge over a 
rolling five-year period, to manage our 
foreign currency exposure to a weaker 
pound. The renewable support (CfD and 
ROCs) received in respect of biomass 
generation are subject to UK inflation 
indices. This exposure is managed as  
part of our active long-term financial 
derivatives hedging programme.
We hold a large portfolio of forward and 
option contracts for various commodities 
and financial products, the nature, value 
and purpose of which is described in  
note 7.2 to the consolidated financial 
statements. These contracts are held  
to de-risk the business, by protecting  
the sterling value of future cash flows in 
relation to the sale of power or purchase 
of key commodities. We manage our 
exposures in accordance with our trading 
and risk management policies.
From time to time, for example where 
market conditions or our trading 
expectations change, action may be 
needed in accordance with these policies 
to rebalance our portfolio. This year such 
activity included restructuring in-the-
money foreign currency exchange 
contracts, to balance short and long 
periods across the duration of the hedge. 
During 2019 we also realised value from 
closing out positions as expectations for 
coal generation reduced, the benefit of 
which is included in value from flexibility, 
above. The financial impact of these 
activities – which is driven by market 
prices at the point of execution – is 
recognised in the cost of sales of our 
Generation business and therefore is 
reflected in our Adjusted Gross profit  
and Adjusted EBITDA.
Production in the year increased slightly 
to 1,406kt (2018: 1,351kt), reflecting a full 
year of operations at the LaSalle pellet 
plant. This would have been higher but 
for challenging weather conditions in the 
first quarter, resulting from unseasonably 
high rainfall and associated high river 
levels, which materially restricted output 
at all three of our pellet plants and caused 
difficulties in loading ships at the port.
We have made good progress with 
biomass cost reduction projects in the 
year, with the average cost per gigajoule 
of our self-supplied pellets falling to  
US$161/tonne in 2019 compared to  
US$166/tonne in the prior year. 
Key contributions to this saving came 
from the benefit of a full year of lower 
operational costs as a result of the 
headquarters relocation from Atlanta  
to Monroe during 2018 and the rail  
spur project at our LaSalle plant, 
commissioned in early May 2019, saving 
transport costs across the rest of 2019 
with a positive impact on supply chain 
emissions. Furthermore, the sawmill 
co-location project at the same plant  
has delivered further savings.
The total savings from these projects 
delivered in 2019 was £14 million, which 
more than offset the weather impact 
described above.
Central and other costs of £46 million 
have increased by £18 million in 2019. 
This increase includes incremental 
research and innovation costs associated 
with key strategic initiatives – including 
those relating to Bio-Energy Carbon 
Capture and Storage (BECCs).
As we described at the half year, and in 
connection with the integration of the 
acquired generation assets; we incurred 
one-off costs implementing a new 
organisational structure that we believe 
will enable us to execute our strategy 
more effectively. Costs associated with 
delivering working capital initiatives have 
also increased.

Total Operating Profit
Total operating profit of £62 million has 
increased 3% from £60 million in 2018. 
This includes the effect of acquisition 
and restructuring costs and 
remeasurement gains and losses on 
derivative contracts that are excluded 
from Adjusted results. Our policy and 
approach to calculating Adjusted results 
is set out on page 131.
Acquisition and restructuring related 
costs of £9 million (2018: £28 million) 
reflect the first-year costs of integrating 
the new generation assets into our 
existing Generation business, following 
transaction costs associated with the 
acquisition last year. The integration is 
now complete, and in line with our policy 
no further acquisition and restructuring 
costs in relation to the acquired assets 
will be excluded from Adjusted EBITDA  
in 2020.
Net fair value remeasurement losses on 
derivative contracts included in operating 
profit were £131 million (2018: gains of 
£38 million) reflecting movements in the 
mark-to-market position on our portfolio 
of commodity and financial derivative 
contracts, to the extent they do not 
qualify for hedge accounting. 
The losses in 2019 are predominantly  
the result of the strengthening of sterling 
in the period and the resulting impact  
on the value of our extensive portfolio  
of foreign currency exchange contracts, 
which provide a rolling five-year hedge 
against changes in exchange rates for 
fuel purchases denominated in foreign 
currencies.
Profit After Tax and Earnings per Share 
Adjusted profit after tax of £118 million 
compares to £42 million for the prior year, 
resulting in Adjusted earnings per share 
(EPS) of 30 pence (2018: 10 pence) which 
represents a 200% increase. 
Improvements in Adjusted profit after  
tax and EPS largely reflect the growth  
in Adjusted EBITDA described above, 
although this has been partially offset  
by higher depreciation charges resulting 
from the new generation assets, and  
an increase in interest charges as a  
result of the new debt issued to part-fund 
the acquisition, as described in further 
detail below.
Total profit after tax of £1 million is lower 
than £20 million for last year, with a 
corresponding reduction in Total EPS 
from 5 pence in 2018 to nil pence in 2019.
Total profit after tax reflects exceptional 
items and certain remeasurements, 
including the derivative remeasurements 
and acquisition and restructuring costs 
described above. In addition, it includes  
a further £5 million of interest charges 
relating to the acquisition bridge facility. 
These costs have been treated as 
exceptional given the direct link to the 
acquisition and their one-off nature 
(2018: £7 million).
The total tax credit of £3 million (2018: 
£6 million) reflects an effective tax rate 
that is lower than the standard rate of  
tax in the UK. This principally reflects  
the benefit of patent box tax credits  
in respect of biomass research and 
development expenditure. Total patent 
box credits included in the overall tax 
credit for 2019 are £8 million (2018: 
£8 million).
Cash taxes paid during the year were 
£9 million (2018: £1 million).
Capital Expenditure
We maintain a disciplined approach  
to capital expenditure, with all significant 
projects subject to appraisal and 
prioritisation by a Capital Committee prior 
to approval, overall ensuring adherence 
to our capital allocation policy and 
maintenance of an appropriate net 
leverage profile.
Total capital expenditure of £172 million  
in 2019 was higher than £114 million in  
the prior year. 
The increase principally reflects 
additional expenditure in respect of the 
new generation assets, strategic projects 
and investments to progress our 
objective of increasing self-supply of 
pellets to 5 million tonnes and reduce  
the cost of pellets.
We have made an initial investment in 
biomass expansion projects in the Pellet 
Production business, ahead of full delivery 
in 2020, in line with our strategy to expand 
self-supply. We have also continued 
investment in our gas development 
projects – our four OCGT sites, a new 
CCGT at Drax Power Station and the 
expansion option at Damhead Creek.

Cash and Net Debt
At 31 December 2019, total borrowings 
were £1,245 million (2018: £608 million) 
and net debt was £841 million (2018: 
£319 million).
Following the reinstatement of the 
Capacity Market in October, we accrued 
the £78 million of associated income in 
full; however, the cash payments were 
not received until after the year end. 
After adjusting for the receipt of £72 
million of cash in January 2020 in respect 
of Capacity Market payments, covering 
the standstill period, this reflects a net 
debt to EBITDA ratio for 2019 of 1.9x 
(2018: 1.3x), within our target of less than 
2x. Without adjusting year end net debt 
for this payment our closing net debt to 
EBITDA ratio was 2.1x.
The increase in borrowings and net debt 
in 2019 reflects the additional debt drawn 
to part-fund the acquisition of the new 
generation assets, for which the cash 
consideration was settled in January 2019.
Taking this into account, and allowing  
for a full year of EBITDA from the new 
generation assets in 2018, this represents 
a significant deleveraging on a like-for-
like basis from a net debt to EBITDA  
ratio of 3.1x.
On 2 January 2019, the Group drew down 
£550 million from the £725 million 
acquisition bridge facility to partially fund 
the acquisition, with the remainder of the 
consideration funded from the Group’s 
cash resources. At inception, the 
acquisition bridge facility was due to 
mature in the second half of 2020. 
During 2019, we refinanced the acquisition 
bridge facility in three stages, including 
two new long-term debt facilities.
On 16 May 2019, we issued an additional 
US $200 million of the existing 2025 
6.625% US dollar loan notes. The 
proceeds from the issuance were used  
to repay £150 million of the drawn down 
acquisition bridge facility. Reflecting the 
strong investor appetite, the notes were 
issued at 101.5% of their face value which, 
when swapped back into sterling, 
achieved an interest rate of 4.74%.
On 24 July 2019, we entered into two  
new senior debt facilities agreements,  
a £375 million private placement with 
infrastructure lenders with maturities 
between 2024 and 2029, and a 
£125 million ESG facility agreement that 
matures in 2022. The ESG facility includes 
a mechanism that adjusts the margin 
based on carbon emissions against an 
annual benchmark.
Together these new facilities extend  
the Group’s debt maturity profile beyond 
2027 and reduce the Group’s overall cost 
of debt to below 4%.
A full reconciliation of the Group’s 
borrowings in the period is provided in 
note 4.3 to the consolidated financial 
statements.
The Group continued to generate strong 
cash from operating activities in 2019, 
with a total inflow of £413 million in 2019 
(2018: £311 million). The increase 
principally reflects improved profitability, 
the contribution from newly acquired 
generation assets and a disciplined 
approach to working capital, partially 
offset by increased interest payments  
on the expanded debt portfolio. 
In addition to the improvements in 
operating performance described above, 
the Group has a strong focus on cash 
flow discipline. We also use various 
methods to manage liquidity through  
the business’ cash generation cycle.
The Group has access to a £315 million 
revolving credit facility, which can be 
used to manage low points in the cash 
cycle, which expires in 2021. No cash was 
drawn under this facility at 31 December 
2019 (2018: £nil). We actively optimise  
our working capital position by managing 
payables, receivables and inventories  
to ensure that the working capital 
committed is closely aligned with 
operational requirements.
The key working capital benefits in 2019, 
in terms of cash flow, arise from making 
sales and purchases of ROC assets and 
rebasing foreign currency exchange 
contracts.
Historically, cash from ROCs has typically 
been realised several months after the 
ROC was earned at the end of the ROC 
compliance period; however, the Group is 
able to limit the overall impact of ROCs on 
working capital by making separate sales 
and purchases in the compliance period. 
For 2019, such transactions generated  
a net cash inflow of £131 million and 
supported an overall working capital 
inflow from ROCs of £54 million. The 
Group also has access to facilities 
enabling it to sell ROC trade receivables

arising on a non-recourse basis. These 
facilities were not utilised at 31 December 
2019 (2018: £nil).
During 2019 the Group rebased several 
foreign currency contracts, which 
resulted in a working capital benefit.  
The total cash released from related 
trades still outstanding at the end of the 
year was £84 million (2018: £3 million) 
reflected in cash generated from 
operations. By undertaking a similar 
exercise on cross-currency swaps,  
we released a further cash benefit  
of £23 million (2018: £nil). This has no  
impact on Adjusted EBITDA, the gains  
are held on the Group’s balance sheet, 
until the rebased trades expire.
In addition, the Group has access to a 
£200 million receivables monetisation 
facility (extended from £150 million in 
2018), which accelerates associated cash 
flows and mitigates exposure to credit 
risk, and a number of payment facilities  
to leverage scale and efficiencies in 
transaction processing. We also facilitate 
a supply chain financing scheme, which 
enables certain suppliers to access 
payment earlier than contractually 
agreed payment terms and supports  
the wider working capital efficiency  
of the Group. The balances outstanding 
at 31 December 2019 and change in 
utilisation in respect of each of these 
facilities is set out in note 4.4 to the 
consolidated financial statements.
The overall net cash inflow for the year 
was £122 million (2018: £66 million), after 
cash payments for capital expenditure of 
£171 million (2018: £104 million), dividend 
payments of £59 million (2018: £53 million), 
net proceeds from new borrowings of 
£653 million (2018: net repayment of 
£5 million) and payments in respect of 
acquisitions of £692 million (2018: £nil).
Distributions
We have a long-standing capital 
allocation policy – a commitment to 
robust financial metrics that underpins 
our strong credit rating, invest in our core 
business, pay a sustainable and growing 
dividend and return surplus capital to 
shareholders as appropriate.
At the Annual General Meeting on 17 April 
2019, shareholders approved payment  
of a final dividend for the year ended 
31 December 2018 of 8.5 pence per share 
(£34 million). The final dividend was paid 
on 10 May 2019.
On 23 July 2019, the Board resolved to 
pay an interim dividend for the six months 
ended 30 June 2019 of 6.4 pence per 
share (£25 million), representing 40%  
of the expected full year dividend.  
The interim dividend was paid on  
11 October 2019.
At the forthcoming Annual General 
Meeting, on 22 April 2020, the Board  
will recommend to shareholders that a 
resolution is passed to approve payment 
of a final dividend for the year ended 
31 December 2019 of 9.5 pence per share 
(£38 million), payable on or before 10 May 
2020. Shares will be marked ex-dividend 
on 23 April 2020. This brings the total 
dividend payable for 2019 to £63 million 
and delivers 13% growth on 2018.
The Group’s £50 million share buy-back 
scheme, which commenced in April 2018, 
concluded in January 2019. In total, 
13.8 million shares were repurchased and 
are now held in treasury.
Other Information
New Accounting Standards
The impact of adopting IFRS 16 during 
the financial year – the new accounting 
standard for leases – is set out in note 8.3 
to the consolidated financial statements. 
On transition, the Group elected to use 
the practical expedient available, allowing 
the standard to only be applied to those 
contracts identified as leases under the 
previous standards. As a result, adoption 
of IFRS 16 has not resulted in any 
retrospective changes to amounts 
recognised in the Group’s annual 
consolidated financial statements for  
the year ended 31 December 2018.
Adoption of IFRS 16 has resulted in a 
reduction of operating costs in 2019  
of £7.4 million, with the costs of leases 
now reflected as depreciation and 
interest charges.
Had the standard been applied in 2018, 
the equivalent reduction in operating 
costs for the year ended 31 December 
2018 would have been £6.3 million. 
Restatement of Comparative Financial 
Information
The Group consolidated financial 
statements (see page 133), include 
comparative information for the year 
ending 31 December 2018.
The 2018 comparatives have been 
restated, from those originally published, 
in respect of the following items:
• Finalisation of the opening values  
of assets and liabilities acquired in 
respect of the acquisition of the new 
generation assets on 31 December 
2018. During 2019, we concluded a 
completion statement process and 
identified adjustments to fixed asset 
values totalling £4 million. The net 
effect of these changes was a 
£5 million increase in consideration 
payable and a £3 million reduction in 
goodwill. See note 5.1 to the financial 
statements.
• Correction of an historical error 
identified in respect of translation of 
fixed assets in our US-based business 
into the consolidated group financial 
statements. Application of the correct 
foreign exchange rates resulted in an 
increase in fixed asset carrying values 
at 1 January and 31 December 2018 of 
£34 million and £56 million respectively, 
with an equivalent amount recognised 
in the translation reserve. The 
correction has no impact on previously 
reported profit or cash amounts.

Remuneration at a glance
A new Remuneration Policy which aligns with our 
purpose of enabling a zero carbon, lower cost energy 
future and rewards sustainable long-term performance 
 
The Committee has 
undertaken a full 
review of the policy, 
taking into account 
shareholder 
feedback.”
Nicola Hodson 
Remuneration Committee Chair
Drax has continued to evolve since  
the last full review of the Directors’ 
Remuneration Policy (the policy).  
The Group has a broader position in  
the energy market following the biomass 
conversion programme and the 
acquisitions in the Customers business 
and, more recently, in Generation with  
the successful integration of the hydro, 
pumped storage and gas assets.
To ensure that our approach to 
remuneration supports the strategy, the 
Remuneration Committee has undertaken 
a full review of the policy, taking into 
account the Group’s strategy, shareholder 
feedback and the new provisions in the 
Corporate Governance Code. 
Our principal aims are to ensure that 
executive pay is closely linked to Group 
performance, underpins our purpose of 
enabling a zero-carbon, lower cost energy 
future; better aligns reward with 
delivering the strategy; incorporates 
targets that reflect the Group’s progress, 
and are relevant and transparent for the 
wider workforce and our shareholders. 
The proposed new policy is designed  
to support delivery of our core business 
against a smaller number of stretching 
annual financial, operational and 
strategic targets, rewarding the delivery 
of growth, innovation and sustainability 
over the long term.
The proposed new remuneration 
structure is simplified, with annual bonus 
payments linked to these goals – a 
decision informed by engagement with 
shareholders. 
In the long-term incentive, Total 
Shareholder Return (TSR) will be retained 
but the Group scorecard will be replaced 
with cumulative adjusted EPS. We feel 
this change will help to drive further 
shareholder value over the medium to 
longer term.
Attracting and retaining the right talent 
capable of delivering high quality 
business performance and growth  
is critical in achieving our strategy.  
We believe the new long-term incentive, 
focused on rewarding stretching 
performance, and with extended  
holding requirements will enable this.
I have met a number of our major 
shareholders and have incorporated their 
feedback. I welcome further feedback  
on the proposed policy.
  You can read more about our  
new policy in our Directors’ 
remuneration report on page 91.

Long-Term Incentive 
Plan (LTIP) 
Our new remuneration policy is aligned with the provisions of the 2018 Corporate Governance Code
Clarity 
• Alignment between the delivery of 
strategic goals and remuneration 
outcomes
• Remuneration which rewards 
shareholder value over the medium  
to longer term
• Performance related elements, relevant 
for the Group as a whole, creating 
alignment across the wider workforce  
in delivering financial, operational and 
strategic imperatives 
Simplicity
• Annual Bonus: Simplifying the bonus  
by focusing on a smaller number of 
financial and strategic measures, which 
provide greater clarity and simplicity
• Revised long-term incentive plan (LTIP). 
Replacing the scorecard element of the 
LTIP with cumulative adjusted EPS, 
which reflects the capability to deliver 
more stable earnings and the 
implementation of a metric aligned to 
shareholder interests in delivering 
growth
Risk 
• Greater proportion of remuneration 
linked to the longer term, ensuring 
stronger alignment with the shareholder 
experience 
• Increased shareholding requirement  
for Executive Directors during and post 
employment
• Malus and clawback provisions mitigate 
behavioural risks by enabling payments 
to be reduced or reclaimed in specific 
circumstances.
Predictability 
• Transparent performance measures and 
targets make clear the possible range  
of remuneration outcomes and these

Market context
Decarbonisation, 
electrification and flexibility 
Globally the energy market in 2019 was marked by 
geopolitical tension, commodity prices which varied 
within a relatively stable range and, most importantly, 
rising awareness of climate change and its 
implications. The UK energy market is increasingly 
shaped by three major trends: the pace of 
decarbonisation of the sector is increasing; the need 
for electrification and more electricity is growing as 
the heat and transport sectors decarbonise; and the 
need for flexible sources of power is greater than ever. 
Decarbonisation – In July 2019 the UK Government 
passed legislation requiring the UK economy to be 
net zero carbon by 2050. Tackling climate change  
is high in the public consciousness and widespread 
engagement and activism suggests that the UK public 
increasingly expects the Government and industry to 
work together to provide solutions. To date the power 
sector has led the way in the UK’s efforts to 
decarbonise, and we believe it will have an even 
greater role in helping to realise net zero. In fact, to hit 
net zero by 2050, including the hard to decarbonise 
sectors such as aviation and agriculture, we envisage 
that the power sector will have to contribute 
negative emissions to the overall carbon balance. 
Electrification – Decarbonisation on the scale 
outlined above is likely to require an absolute increase 
in the amount of electricity produced and consumed 
due to the electrification of heating and transport. 
The UK Government has signalled a commitment to 
end diesel and petrol car sales by the middle of the 
next decade, which is expected to increase the 
number of electric vehicles on the road and further 
add to the demand for electrification. Furthermore,  
a report from the Energy Transitions Commission 
(November 2018) estimated that electricity’s 
contribution to global energy supply must rise from 
20% to 60% by 2060. 
Flexibility – Renewable power generation, driven by 
wind and solar, is increasing and is expected to 
provide over 80% of power by 2050. Delivered by 
smaller, more widely distributed, sources of 
generation this will mean the UK power grid will need 
to manage more volatility, and energy customers  
will increasingly need more control over the way they 
use or generate their own energy. The need for more 
flexible generation was thrown into sharp relief by 
the power supply issues on 9 August 2019 which  
saw over one million people go without power when 
1.9GW of power failed in a short period of time. 
On the next page we explore three aspects of  
Drax’s response to changes in the energy market  
in more detail.

Towards a net  
zero carbon future
1
Meeting the net zero  
by 2050 target
Hitting net zero and limiting average 
temperature rises to less than 1.5 degrees 
Celsius will require huge investment.  
The precise path to achieve this goal  
is not yet certain for all sectors but it is 
becoming increasingly clear that carbon 
removal technologies and negative 
emissions will have a significant role  
to play. Organisations such as the 
International Panel on Climate Change 
and the UK’s Committee on Climate 
Change agree that carbon capture 
technologies, in particular those which 
could lead to the removal of carbon  
from the atmosphere, will be important. 
Our response
In 2019 Drax produced 13.7 TWh of 
renewable power and we have reduced 
our carbon footprint by over 85% since 
2012. Coal accounted for only 4% of 
Drax’s generation in 2019. In December 
2019 we announced an ambition to 
become a carbon negative company by 
2030. This means by 2030 Drax would  
be removing more carbon dioxide from 
the atmosphere than we are emitting.
2
Evolving mix of 
generation
The use of intermittent renewables, such 
as wind and solar, continues to increase. 
Flexible, thermal generation, such as coal 
and older gas plant generation continues 
to decline. This places additional pressure 
to balance the energy system. More 
distributed generation and the increase 
in intermittent renewables are driving 
increased levels of volatility in short-term 
prices and a need for assets to provide 
system support services. There is an 
increasing need for flexible sources of 
power which can provide services such 
as response, reserve, reactive power, 
black start and inertia. 
Our response
Drax’s portfolio of flexible generation 
assets (biomass, hydro and gas) provide 
these increasingly important balancing 
services. Drax now has generation  
assets with a capacity of 6.5GW 
distributed across Scotland, northern  
and south east England, and options  
to develop generation assets in Wales 
and the East of England. 
Drax saw a 63% increase in the value 
derived from flexibility in 2019 compared 
to 2018. 
3
 Changing customer 
behaviours and 
expectations
The business-to-business energy market 
is highly competitive and customers 
demand access to both low cost and 
renewable power. Customers want more 
control of their energy in order to manage 
both cost and their environmental 
impact. Energy suppliers therefore need 
to provide the services which customers 
need. Our business customers 
increasingly seek to create value from 
their portfolios through the installation  
of their own generation capabilities,  
the provision of demand side response 
and energy trading.
Our response
Drax is now the third largest supplier of 
energy to businesses and supplies more 
of its customers with 100% renewable 
power than any of its competitors.  
Our investment in digital technologies  
is providing new opportunities, a reduced 
cost to serve and an enhanced customer 
experience.
In 2019 Drax launched a partnership  
with SES Water to provide an end-to-end 
electric vehicle offer, and a new 
partnership with Eaton allowed Drax  
to install batteries as an energy service 
on our customers’ property. Services  
like this mean Drax can open up power 
and flexibility markets to more of our 
customers and ultimately generate value 
for both us and our customers through 
our trading expertise.

Working with our stakeholders
Engaging with our stakeholders is fundamental to our success. 
We recognise that we need to listen to, and work with, a diverse 
range of interested parties to achieve our purpose: to enable a 
zero carbon, lower cost energy future. In this section, we explain 
how we have identified our stakeholders and engaged with them 
to inform the way we operated our business in 2019.

Stakeholder relations
High quality engagement with the full 
breadth of our stakeholders is key to 
well-informed decision-making that pays 
appropriate regard to stakeholder views. 
Drax has a wide range of stakeholders 
and takes care to ensure that the Group, 
and the Board, has an effective strategy 
to identify and engage with those 
stakeholders. 
We have a comprehensive stakeholder 
engagement strategy. This is detailed in 
the Communications Strategy, which is 
presented to the Board at least annually 
and sets out our stakeholders and 
provides oversight of how the Group 
intends to engage with them.
Engagement with stakeholders informs 
both our day-to-day decision making,  
that ensures the smooth running of the 
business, and the strategic decisions 
which help set our direction for the years 
and decades to come. 
Drax employs dedicated teams to  
engage both proactively and reactively 
with particular stakeholder groups.  
This includes a stakeholder relations 
team, an investor relations team, an 
internal relations team, a sustainable 
business team, a business ethics team,  
a media relations team and a digital 
engagement team. 
Methods of engagement with 
stakeholders vary according to the issue 
at hand and the stakeholder concerned. 
The table on page 25 sets out the broad 
stakeholder groups that we identified  
and engaged with during 2019. It also 
highlights why we engaged, how we 
engaged and the areas of focus.
Companies Act, Section 172 Statement
Meaningful engagement with all our stakeholder groups supports our 
obligations under Section 172 of the Companies Act 2006. 
On pages 24 to 29 we set out how the Board, and the Group more widely,  
has had regard to stakeholder interests when discharging its duty to promote 
the success of the Company. 
On pages 49 and 50 we explain how we seek to maintain our high standards  
of business conduct.

Engagement takes place at many levels  
of the business and a judgement about 
whether Board engagement, Executive 
Committee engagement, senior 
management or working level 
engagement is required is made on a case 
by case basis. The Group Head of Public 
Affairs maintains a detailed map of key 
stakeholders, the concerns they have 
raised and the date of the last meeting. 
Management keeps under review the 
relevant stakeholders who may be 
affected by major decisions.
To ensure clear feedback to the Board, 
the CEO regularly reports to the Board on 
key stakeholder relations activity, current 
issues and the relevant feedback received 
from interaction with stakeholders. This  
is supported by the Group Director of 
Corporate Affairs, the Corporate Affairs 
team and the relevant owners of direct 
stakeholder engagement.
Supporting the Board’s duty to promote 
the success of the Company, as set out  
in Section 172 of the Companies Act 
2006, Board and Executive Committee 
discussions include information on 
stakeholders likely to be affected by 
items under discussion and the potential 
impact. This ensures that the interests  
of all relevant stakeholders are considered 
in decision-making.
The Group Director of Corporate Affairs 
and the Group External Affairs Director 
presented a detailed report on 
stakeholder engagement in July 2019,  
to both the Board and the Executive 
Committee. This included the Board’s 
response to the 42% vote against the 
political donations resolution at the 2019 
AGM and the development of a new 
policy for political expenditure. You can 
read more about this on page 27.
In 2019, we developed a new 
Remuneration Policy. Nicola Hodson,  
the Remuneration Committee Chair, led 
the engagement with our shareholders, 
to gain their feedback on the proposed 
Policy. You can read more about the new 
Policy in the Directors’ Remuneration 
Report on page 86.
As part of his induction, John Baxter 
visited 12 Drax sites in 2019, meeting  
with local management to discuss the 
business, in particular health and safety 
and plant management.
On appointment as Senior Independent 
Director in April 2019, David Nussbaum 
wrote to our largest shareholders to 
confirm his availability to meet with them. 
David also attended the Group’s Capital 
Markets Day in November 2019 and met 
with a variety of investors.

Engagement over political 
donations policy
While Drax makes no political donations in  
the generally accepted definition of the term, 
it is important that we engage with politicians, 
political parties, policy makers and other 
stakeholders. The engagement includes,  
for example, sponsorship of events at party 
conferences and facilitating visits to the areas 
in which we operate where such activity is 
closely tied to our business objectives. While 
this type of expenditure is typically classified 
as “commercial spend”, Drax is mindful of the 
potential for these activities to be considered 
political, or to be included on the Electoral 
Commission Register. 
At Drax’s 2019 AGM, a majority of shareholders 
voted in favour of an increase in the authority 
which would allow for inadvertent political 
spending. However, 42% of shareholders  
voted against the proposed increase. This 
represented a significant fall in support 
compared to previous years so we 
implemented a systematic programme to 
engage with shareholders to understand  
how our approach could better align with  
our investors’ expectations and address the 
concerns expressed at the 2019 AGM. 
We reviewed initial feedback received from 
shareholders at the time of the AGM; analysed 
spend from political engagement activities; 
engaged a third party to conduct an external 
benchmarking exercise on political donations 
authorities; developed a new Political 
Engagement Policy (Policy), which included  
an aggregate expenditure cap of £125,000 
reflecting initial shareholder feedback; 
developed a strategy for engagement with 
shareholders which was approved by the 
Board in July 2019, along with the new Policy; 
engaged with major shareholders both in 
writing and in person; considered further 
feedback received; published an update on our 
website in October 2019, within six months of 
the AGM, and published the new Policy on our 
website: drax.com/about-us/drax-political-

Workforce engagement
Workforce engagement forums – 
MyVoice – were implemented in 2019. 
In determining the most appropriate 
engagement method to adopt, the 
Board considered that the workforce 
forums already in place in parts of the 
business provided a strong basis on 
which to develop and grow a Group-
wide structure. It was therefore agreed 
to expand the existing infrastructure, 
create a more formal governance 
framework and provide appropriate 
resourcing to support the forums.
The forums are aligned to our 
operating model, representing the 
Pellet Production, Generation and 
Customers businesses, and Core 
Services. Each forum comprises up to 
12 colleague representatives, including 
the chair, and meets as regularly as 
each forum feels is appropriate for 
local needs.
Each forum is made up of members 
drawn from nominated colleagues 
from across the relevant business  
unit, and each forum chair has been 
selected by membership vote.  
MyVoice forum members attended  
an independently facilitated two-day 
training course to develop the skills 
needed to be confident in fulfilling 
their role. Penny Small, Chief 
Transformation officer, is the 
Executive Committee sponsor.
The chairs of each of the forums  
come together quarterly to discuss 
workforce issues across the business. 
The chairs then meet with the Group 
Chair and CEO to discuss the key 
issues raised, with feedback from 
these meetings then shared with  
all forum members. 
Matters discussed during 2019 include 
how effectively communication filters 
down from senior leadership to the 
wider business: wellbeing, including  
a greater focus on mental health;  
and living our values. In response to 
MyVoice feedback, the Safety, Health, 
Environment and Welfare Leadership 
Executive Committee, a sub-
committee of the Executive 
Committee, has developed plans to 
address wellbeing across Drax Group, 
including mental wellbeing, which 
have been shared with the MyVoice 
forums to seek their input before 
rolling out in 2020.

Zero Carbon Humber
In 2019 Drax Group, Equinor and 
National Grid Ventures launched 
the Zero Carbon Humber campaign 
which commits them to work 
together to explore how a large-
scale carbon capture use and 
storage (CCUS) and hydrogen 
production facility could be 
constructed in the Humber in  
the mid-2020s. 
This initiative was the first 
significant response from industry 
following the UK Committee on 
Climate Change’s Net Zero report 
which found that CCUS and 
hydrogen technology developed in 
regional industrial structures is 
essential if the UK is going to 
achieve a net zero carbon economy 
by 2050.
The programme means we will work 
with partners including the Humber 
Local Enterprise Partnership, local 
Councils, trade unions, politicians, 
and businesses across the region  
to deliver what could be the world’s 
first net zero carbon region. 
In September 2019, the partnership 
launched Capture for Growth, a 
roadmap to guide the delivery of 
the net zero industrial cluster on 
Humberside by 2040. The cluster 
could secure 55,000 jobs and 
capture 15% of the UK’s current 
annual CO2 emissions – the biggest 
contribution to the UK’s climate 
commitments of any region. 
At the UN Climate Change 
Conference in Madrid in December 
2019 we announced our ambition 
to become a carbon negative 
company by 2030.
Capital Markets Day 
In November 2019 we hosted a 
Capital Markets Day to update 
investors on our strategy. Around 
80 participants joined the Capital 
Markets Day presentation, 
reflecting a combination of existing 
shareholders, investors and lenders.
A key theme of the event was the 
business case behind our plans to 
increase our self-supply of pellets. 
The event included a presentation 
by Dr Rebecca Heaton, our Group 
Head of Climate Change, on the 
ways in which we ensure our 
biomass supply is sustainable  
(for more on this see page 34).
There was an opportunity for 
attendees to ask questions and, 
once the main presentations were 
over, meet with members of senior 
management, including the CEO, 
CFO, CEO Generation and Senior 
Independent Director. Questions 
focused on the long-term cost of 
biomass, biomass sustainability  
and the growing focus on 
Environmental, Social and 
Governance (ESG) matters.
Following the Capital Markets Day 
we hosted an ESG site visit at Drax 
Power Station to discuss biomass 
sustainability, the future of gas and 
the Just Transition.
All materials from the Capital 
Markets Day, together with a video 
of the presentations and the Q&A 
session, have been made available 
on the website at www.drax.com/

Ask the CEO
Each week employees are able to 
ask, anonymously, questions of  
the CEO on any subject. The CEO 
then sends a weekly email to all 
colleagues with his thoughts and 
highlights of the week followed  
by his responses to the latest 
questions. 
In 2019 employees asked nearly 
2,000 questions in “Ask Will”. 
Subjects ranged from questions 
about strategy – with employees 
enquiring and challenging to gain  
 deeper understanding of what we 
do and plan to do; climate change 
– including what Drax is doing to 
help to tackle climate change, what 
employees can do as individuals 
and Will’s own views; areas of 
concern around the business; 
mental health and wellbeing; pay 
and benefits around the Group and 
new or innovative ideas.
Examples of action taken as a  
result of “Ask Will” questions include 
the development of a car-sharing 
programme, enhancements to the 
cycle-to-work scheme and the 
development of a Group-wide 
charitable giving programme.

Biomass cost reduction
Building a 
long-term 
future for 
sustainable 
biomass  
is a key 
strategic 
objective 
for Drax.
The key to delivering this objective  
is reducing the cost of wood pellets  
to a level where biomass generation  
is economic without subsidy.
Current biomass generation at Drax 
Power Station is supported under two 
separate schemes. Three biomass units 
receive support under the Renewable 
Obligation scheme and one unit receives 
support under the Contract for 
Difference scheme. The support under 
both these mechanisms ends on 
31 March 2027. Today, without these 
schemes, it is uneconomic to produce 
renewable electricity from biomass.
The Group’s objective is to reduce the 
cost of biomass by about 30% by 2027 
– from around £75/MWh in 2019 to 
around £50/MWh. We believe that 
delivering this reduction will establish 
an economic model for unsubsidised 
biomass generation beyond 2027.
How will we do this?
Optimise existing capacity and 
generation
Drax currently uses around seven million 
tonnes of biomass, 1.4 million tonnes of 
which are self-supplied by our operations 
in the US Gulf.
As Drax’s pellet production business is 
relatively immature – its first assets were 
commissioned in 2015 – there are 
significant opportunities to optimise, 
improve processes and drive greater 
efficiencies.
Current initiatives:
A co-location agreement with sawmill 
operator Hunt Forest Products next to 
the LaSalle pellet plant began production 
in February 2019 and provides:
• Low-cost sawmill residues
• Reduced transportation costs
• Reduced processing. As sawmill 
residues are a semi-processed material, 
we can reduce the number of steps in 
the production process, eliminating 
chipping, drying and debarking
A rail spur linking LaSalle to the regional 
rail network and our port facility at Baton 
Rouge was commissioned in May 2019. 
This increases transportation efficiency, 
economies of scale, reduces cost and 
carbon footprint.
Development of an enlarged chambering 
yard at the port of Baton Rouge, by the 
regional rail operator.
• Economies of scale in rail allowing 
80-car train sets to operate from  
our LaSalle and Morehouse sites 
(previously 45-car train sets)
These initiatives and others have 
contributed to a 3% year-on-year 
reduction in cost per tonne, which 
represents a saving of $5 per tonne 
compared to 2018.
The larger projects will be accompanied 
by small projects to improve operational 
efficiency such as greater efficiency in 
the loading of road haulage, which saves 
50 cents per tonne. Over time these 
improvements, when applied across the 
supply chain, have the potential to deliver 
significant incremental savings.

Expansion of the fuel envelope
When we converted Drax Power Station 
units from coal to biomass we took a 
conservative approach to boiler 
chemistry and decided to use sustainable 
biomass, such as US pine, because we 
knew it would mitigate the risk of boiler 
fouling issues.
To date, the operational experience has 
been positive and this has allowed us to 
now expand the fuel envelope and 
chemistries we will consider for 
renewable residues. This opens up the 
opportunity to consider a broader range 
of products and geographies which could 
have attractive cost characteristics while 
meeting our strict sustainability criteria.
Over the last decade, as part of our work 
on biomass, we have screened hundreds 
of different types of materials, and we’re 
now using this knowledge of chemistries 
and operational characteristics to inform 
the expansion of the fuel envelope.
Examples of these materials include 
sugar cane residues (bagasse), nuts  
and agricultural residues.
Trading and optimisation
An integral part of our strategy is to 
develop a biomass trading capability. This 
is an optimisation and risk management 
activity to support our aim to deliver 
lower-cost pellets, and not proprietary 
trading, through which we aim to:
• manage internal supply, or short-term 
supply imbalances
• optimise internal and external supply 
as we build our self-supply capacity
• manage the different levels of demand 
we might see after 2027
• take advantage of opportunities in 
other markets as the global biomass 
market develops
Beyond 2027
Biomass cost reduction is a significant 
value opportunity, with attractive returns 
delivered pre-2027. With a lower cost 
base, we believe that biomass can be 
economic without subsidy. We also 
believe that reducing costs supports the 
development of bioenergy with carbon 
capture and storage (BECCS). The UK 
requires more renewables and BECCS  
if it is to achieve its target of net zero  
by 2050. These factors inform our 
expectations.
However, if biomass generation is 
uneconomic post-2027, we retain the 
option to sell to other international 
markets which we expect to grow in  
the coming decade. Being the largest 
low-cost producer in the world would  
give us strategic optionality and a 
competitive advantage in this regard.
We have also identified plans to  
expand our existing three sites, LaSalle, 
Morehouse and Amite, by 350,000 
tonnes over the next two years – an 
investment of £50 million. This will 
expand total capacity to around 1.85Mt, 
provide economies of scale and allow 
even greater utilisation of low-cost 
residues. These projects support lower 
cost wood pellets, while delivering an 
attractive return on capital, with payback 
before 2027.
Further expansion of self-supply capacity
Ownership of the supply chain provides 
the opportunity to reduce cost and 
create significant value, both pre- and 
post-2027. This is why Drax aims to 
increase self-supply capacity to five 
million tonnes by 2027.
We are considering the development of 
low-cost satellite plants in the US Gulf 
which would be able to use our existing 
infrastructure and sawmill residues to 
produce low-cost wood pellets. We 
believe this could add up to 0.5 million 
tonnes of new capacity.
We will continue to assess opportunities 
to build or buy new capacity to support 
this ambition – both in the US Gulf and 
elsewhere.

System stability
What’s the issue?
Keeping the lights on requires not just 
electricity generation, but also a range  
of non-generation activities which help 
provide stability, flexibility and reliability. 
These system support services include:
Inertia – The stored energy in 
synchronous generators which slow down 
the rate of changes in system frequency,
Voltage control/Reactive Power  
(MVars) – Reactive power is used to 
manage power flows around the 
transmission system and helps to support 
voltage in the event of a system fault.
Reserve – The system operator must  
be able to ensure a balance between 
demand and generation at all times  
to prevent power cuts at times of peak 
demand. This increased and decreased 
generation is sometimes referred to as 
headroom and footroom respectively. 
Managing demand can also be used  
to the same effect.
Response – The automatic change in 
generation output, or in demand, to 
maintain a system frequency of 50Hz. 
This frequency response is required  
every second of the day.
Black Start – The ability of a generation 
unit to start up without external 
electricity supplies following a total  
or partial loss of power from the 
transmission system.
Historically, large coal- and gas-fired 
power stations were able to deliver these 
services as a by-product of producing 
reliable baseload electricity.
Now, these older coal and gas plants are 
being shuttered in the UK and being 
replaced by intermittent renewable 
energy sources, principally wind. This 
reduces carbon emissions but makes the 
provision of these system support services 
more challenging. Wind, by its nature, is 
intermittent and, for the most part, unable 
to provide system support services.
So as demand for system support services 
increases, there are fewer assets, such  
as large power stations, able to provide 
them. This is increasing the cost of 
operating the system and is a growing 
source of value for generators like Drax 
who can provide these services.
How can we do this?
Our focus as a generator is to provide  
the flexible, renewable and low carbon 
generation millions of households rely on. 
Drax operates a portfolio of sustainable 
biomass, hydro and gas assets which are 
well positioned, both geographically and 
operationally, to provide these services  
to the UK electricity market.
These assets include:
Sustainable biomass – Drax Power 
Station in north Yorkshire has 2.6GW of 
flexible renewable generation in the 
centre of the UK. The power station is 
well-situated to provide system support 
services to central and northern England 
and Scotland.
Pumped Storage Hydro – Cruachan 
Power Station in western Scotland has 
440MW of fully flexible electricity 
generation that can be brought online  
in two minutes from rest. Cruachan has 
large-scale energy storage as well as a  
full suite of system support capabilities. 
The power station, which is capable  
of 15 hours of full-load generation  
and storage, is well located to support 
regional nuclear and offshore Scottish 
wind farms.
Gas – CCGT – Drax has 2GW of flexible 
generation at Damhead Creek, Shoreham 
and Rye House power stations in 
southeast England. These are well 
located in a key demand centre.
Demand-side response – System support 
is principally delivered through 
generation, but we also have a growing 
opportunity to provide some of these 
services through our Customers business. 
We provide electricity to large and 
industrial customers, in addition to SMEs. 
Working with these larger customers  
we expect to provide demand-side 
response services to the electricity 
market – reducing demand at times  
of lower supply and vice versa.
How can we  
be the leading 
provider of  
system stability?

Giving customers control of their energy
Through the provision of insight, 
digitisation, and services, we provide all 
customers with the opportunity to control 
and optimise energy use, cost and source.
Demand-side Response
Haven Power is the leading challenger 
brand provider of renewable energy and 
services to Industrial and Commercial 
customers. Haven’s large portfolio of 
industrial and commercial customers 
provides opportunities to provide system 
support services to the energy market 
and create value for customers.
In November 2019, United Utilities became 
the first customer to sign up to Haven 
Power’s Asset Flex project. Known as 
Demand Side Response (DSR), customers 
are provided with financial incentives to 
turn down, or off, non-essential equipment 
at times of peak demand depending on 
the customer’s needs.
Haven installs its technology to turn  
down or off customers’ energy demand  
in peak times to reduce costs, and is 
designed to always work within the 
constraints set by the customer. For 
example, turning down an industrial fridge 
or freezer where the ambient temperature 
can remain within certain limits even if it 
isn’t running at full blast for the whole 
time. It’s simple for the customer: Drax 
has the opportunity to create value  
from the asset in the provision of system 
support services and in exchange, 
customers get a cheaper tariff.
By reducing demand, typically at times  
of peak demand, which are also periods  
of higher carbon intensity, Drax Group  
is supporting the energy system and 
delivering the Group’s purpose of enabling 
a zero carbon, lower cost energy future.
Electric Vehicles (EVs)
Drax is developing an end-to-end bundle 
aimed at making it easier for companies 
to switch to EVs. SES Water was the  
first partner to trial this bespoke package, 
which includes charging infrastructure, 
operating software, EV leasing, and  
the renewable electricity needed to 
power them.
The aim is to deliver EV charging and 
battery optimisation, which ties into  
our customer control strategy. By 
understanding all aspects of EVs from 
telematics to charge-point hardware  
and software we are identifying 
opportunities to create value for 
customers and the Group.
Battery power
Energy storage through batteries is also 
being tested with customers who already 
generate renewable energy onsite.
Energy storage is the key to helping 
customers maximise the benefit of the 
energy they generate from their own 
small-scale renewables, providing greater 
flexibility to the grid and smoothing 
volatility in the system.
Drax has partnered with energy storage 
company Eaton, which offers new and 
second-life batteries, such as used EV 
batteries, for installations on customer 
sites. Eaton can quickly scale-up the 
deployment of small commercial energy 
storage systems to larger, industrial-scale 
units, helping to support more customers.
Customers are asking us about 
technologies to make their sites more 
efficient and sustainable, so we’re 
reacting to that. Lots of our customers 
want to improve the resilience of their 
sites. This area will continue to grow.
We provide all customers 
with the ability to control 
and optimise energy use, 
cost and source.

the climate
Biomass Carbon Cycle
*   Forestry residues includes branch tops and bark, thinnings and low-grade roundwood. For more information, see Sourcing Sustainable Biomass on page 41
**  BECCS is a bioenergy, carbon capture and storage system, with CO2 resulting from power generation captured and stored in an aquifer under the North Sea
There’s widespread recognition among 
leading science-based organisations, 
such as the UN’s Intergovernmental Panel 
on Climate Change, that sustainable 
biomass has a vital role to play in meeting 
climate targets. Sustainable biomass has 
three big benefits: it generates renewable 
electricity, supports forest growth and is 
a route to negative emissions using 
BECCS. At Drax, replacing coal with 
biomass to generate power has already 
delivered carbon savings of more than 
80% since 2012.
Generation of electricity using biomass 
functions as a closed loop carbon system. 
When trees grow, they absorb carbon 
dioxide. Emissions from using biomass to 
generate electricity are balanced by the 
absorption of CO2 from the forests that 
are growing. This differs from burning 
coal where the emissions remain in the 
atmosphere.
It’s important to remember that the 
carbon benefits are only realised if the 
biomass is sustainable. There are many 
criteria for sustainable biomass, including 
taking wood from managed forests – 
those that are replanted after harvesting, 
not causing deforestation, or cutting 
old-growth forests or harvesting wood 
from protected areas.
We’re committed to sustainable biomass 
which is why our Responsible Sourcing 
Policy for Biomass goes beyond existing 
regulations, and commits us to only take 
feedstocks that the science says delivers 
climate benefits. Sustainable biomass 
helps to provide a market for the low-
value residues from a working forest. 
This creates an incentive for landowners 
to have more forests under management, 
contributing to greater forest growth and 
more CO2 captured. Sustainably managed 
forests are typically healthy, support 
biodiversity and can absorb more carbon 
than unmanaged forests. 
We can see evidence of this in the US, 
where we source almost two thirds of our 
pellets. According to US Forest Service 
data (Forestry Inventory Analysis database, 
November 2019) there is an average 
annual surplus of nearly 200 million m3  
of new growth compared to harvesting.  
In Canada, in 2017, the surplus of growth 
compared to harvesting was 63 million m3 
(National Forestry Database, 2017).

Head of Climate Change at Drax

Forests are managed for multiple 
objectives, including biodiversity, water 
management and timber production. The 
main timber product from a forest is saw 
logs. These large, high-value logs produce 
wood products for construction or 
furniture, ending up as long-term carbon 
storage. Around half of a saw log going 
into a sawmill comes out as sawdust.  
In some parts of the world, that is simply 
burned or ends up in a landfill. 
Almost 40% of our wood pellet feedstock 
is, in fact, those sawmill residues. Of the 
rest, around 30% is thinnings, branches, 
tops and bark and 30% low-grade 
roundwood.
Around a fifth of the material we use to 
make pellets is thinnings, where trees are 
taken out at various intervals to allow the 
remaining trees to grow bigger. Thinning 
also stops pests, diseases and fire from 
ripping through the forests and supports 
biodiversity. Providing a market for these 
thinnings helps these forests thrive. 
  How do you know that 
the wood Drax uses is 
sustainable?
Everything we do is independently 
audited and we abide by all the current 
requirements for sustainable biomass.
The UK and EU have robust regulatory 
frameworks for sustainable biomass. 
Drax’s requirements on biomass 
sustainability exceed these rules. We  
also use external certification through 
the Sustainable Biomass Program (SBP), 
which sets a standard that is audited  
by independent third-party auditors. 
It’s also about choosing the right 
feedstocks in the first place – something 
we’re committed to ensuring.
  Why do you ship wood 
from the US and Canada 
to the UK?
Biomass is best sourced from vast forests 
with established forest industries which 
generate a lot of low-value residue. North 
America, with its well-established and 
sustainable commercial forest industry, 
meets those conditions. That’s why we 
bring a lot from the US. We transport  
the pellets mostly by train and ship, with  
a small proportion of the journey using 
fuel-efficient trucks. We track and 
manage all the journeys to ensure the 
supply chain is as low carbon as possible, 
and report the final number for our 
biomass supply chain on page 43, which 
is independently audited. 
We’re also involved in various 
transportation initiatives such as  
the Smart Green Shipping Alliance.
  Tell us about the new 
Responsible Sourcing 
Policy for Biomass
As a significant user of sustainable 
biomass for energy we wanted our policy 
to go beyond existing legislation and 
requirements.
The policy we published in 2019 (available 
here www.drax.com/sustainability) draws 
on recommendations made by Forest 
Research, the research agency of the 
Forestry Commission, in a report 
commissioned by the European Climate 
Foundation. Alongside the new policy, we 
also launched an Independent Advisory 
Board of scientists, who will keep us at the 
forefront of the latest scientific thinking 
and best practice on biomass sourcing.
Our policy has four parts to it. First, we 
commit to only use feedstocks which the 
science says delivers climate benefits. 
This means we won’t use biomass that 
drives harvesting decisions that would 
adversely affect the long-term potential 
of forests to store carbon. Second, we will 
protect the natural environment – for 
example, by not causing deforestation. 
Third, we will support people and 
communities. Finally, we committed  
to carry out research, outreach and 
intervention, which includes active 
engagement with the communities 
where we operate and NGOs.
  How will the 
Independent Advisory 
Board (IAB) work?
The six-member IAB is chaired by the  
UK government’s former chief scientific 
adviser Professor Sir John Beddington. 
The IAB will help to keep our sourcing 
guidelines under regular review so they 
can evolve as the science develops. You 
can read more about the IAB on page 41.
We expect the IAB to challenge us every 
step of the way, and believe it’s right that 
companies using biomass go beyond 
existing regulations to ensure that it 
makes a positive contribution to our 
climate and the environment.
  What are the  
next steps?
A big part of our work in 2020 is to 
increase transparency on our biomass 
sourcing and its impacts. We will provide 
that evidence by using big data and 
satellite images to evaluate the impact on 
forest cover, forest carbon and biodiversity 
in areas that supply Drax’s pellet mills (see 
Healthy Forest Landscapes on page 44).
We are working with non-profit groups 
and NGOs, including Earthworm 
Foundation and biodiversity-focused 
group NatureServe, to understand the 
social and economic impacts and benefits 
in the areas where we source our biomass.
In 2020, we will broaden our work with 
Earthworm on our healthy forest 
landscapes programme. We will also 
expand the pilot that evaluates the 
impact on forest cover and biodiversity  
to more sites and publish findings from 
our initial work.
Ensuring the sustainability of the biomass 
we use is vital if we’re to move to the  
next stage and deliver negative emissions 
using bioenergy carbon capture and 
storage while continuing to supply 
flexible, renewable power to the UK grid.

Building a sustainable business continued
Power Station, using molten carbonate 
fuel cells as a technology for capturing 
carbon dioxide.
In September 2019, together with Equinor 
and National Grid Ventures, we launched 
the Zero Carbon Humber Campaign 
(www.zerocarbonhumber.co.uk) to 
develop the first zero carbon industrial 
cluster in the UK by 2040.
Carbon Emissions Performance
Group total carbon emissions (Scope 1 
and 2) fell 47% between 2018 and 2019. 
This reflects a reduction in coal 
generation and an increased share of 
generation from biomass, gas, hydro and 
pumped storage. The reduction in carbon 
emissions at Drax Power Station had the 
most significant impact. With four of the 
six generating units now converted to 
biomass from coal, emissions from Drax 
Power Station have fallen from 22.7 
million tCO2 in 2012 to below 1 million 
tCO2 in 2019.
Significant emissions reduction  
activities undertaken in 2019 included 
the installation of a new high-pressure 
turbine on Unit 2 at Drax Power Station, 
at a cost of £12.5 million, to improve its 
efficiency. We have also improved the 
energy efficiency at some of our 
Customers business facilities, with 
measures such as installing solar panels, 
LED lighting and battery storage.
Carbon Emissions
Drax has a significant role to play in  
the transition to a low-carbon economy 
and this informs our purpose to enable  
a zero carbon, lower cost energy future.  
We are committed to supporting the  
UK government to achieve net zero 
carbon emissions by 2050.
Managing Climate Change Risks 
and Opportunities
We are committed to the identification, 
management and disclosure of our 
climate change risks and opportunities  
in line with the recommendations of the 
Task Force on Climate-related Financial 
Disclosures (TCFD).
In 2019, we responded to the CDP Climate 
questionnaire and received a score of C. 
We introduced climate change as a new 
principal risk category (see Principal Risks 
and Uncertainties on page 54).
Our Negative Emissions Ambition
At the UN Climate Change Conference 
COP 25 in December 2019, Drax 
announced our ambition to become 
carbon negative by 2030. We have signed 
up to the Science Based Targets initiative 
to further assure that our target is aligned 
with climate science.
Using technologies such as Bioenergy 
with Carbon Capture and Storage 
(BECCS), Drax aims to remove more 
carbon dioxide from the atmosphere  
than it produces, creating a negative 
carbon footprint for the Group. Our 
leading ambition is only achievable  
with an effective negative emissions 
policy and investment framework for 
technologies such as BECCS.
Innovating to Decarbonise our Business
Carbon capture and utilisation is part  
of our business strategy and we made 
progress on this work in 2019.
Drax has set up a Bioenergy Carbon 
Capture and Storage (BECCS) 
demonstration pilot at Drax Power 
Station with C-Capture, a start-up from 
the University of Leeds. We also secured 
funding from the UK Government to 
explore the feasibility of building a 
second carbon capture pilot at Drax 
Environment
 
Drax’s ambition is to be carbon negative  
by 2030. Having pioneered the use of 
sustainable biomass, Drax now produces 
12% of the UK’s renewable electricity.  
With the right negative emissions policy, 
we can do much more, removing millions  
of tonnes of emissions from the 
atmosphere each year.”

Notes
Greenhouse gas emissions (GHGs) are reported against a criterion of operational control. This means emissions from all sites that are wholly owned by Drax or where Drax has 
operational control of the emission pathway through the opportunity to select and manage its own suppliers. GHGs are reported in units of carbon dioxide equivalent (CO2e). 
Conversions from non-CO2 GHGs use the most up-to-date published IPCC global warming potentials for a 100-year period without climate carbon feedbacks. A materiality threshold 
of 75 tCO2e/year has been applied.
(1) Generation emissions covers all direct emissions from our own business operations that fall under the scope of the European Union Emissions Trading System (EU ETS)
(2) Scope 1 covers all direct emissions from our own business operations, across all sites
(3) Scope 2 covers all indirect emissions associated with our electricity and heat consumption, across all sites
(4) The biogenic CO2 emissions resulting from generation are counted as zero in official reporting to both UK authorities and under the European Union Emissions Trading System 
(EU ETS) as the use of sustainable biomass is considered to be CO2 neutral at the point of combustion. This methodology originates from the United Nations Framework 
Convention on Climate Change

Environmental Impact
We are committed to managing, 
monitoring and reducing the 
environmental impact of our operations 
and the Group environment policy 
outlines our approach.
The Environmental Management Systems 
(EMS) at our Generation sites in the UK 
are certified to ISO 14001. The EMS at  
our Pellet Production sites in the US  
are based on the principles of, but not 
certified to, ISO 14001.
We self-reported one environmental 
permit breach at Drax Power Station  
in 2019. The regulator categorised it  
as having no impact on human health, 
quality of life or the environment.
Emissions to Air
Our work in 2019 focused on future 
compliance with the requirements of the 
EU Best Available Techniques reference 
documents (BREFs), which will further 
reduce emission limits, entering into 
force in 2021.
At Drax Power Station, emissions of 
nitrogen oxides, sulphur dioxide and 
particulates continued to trend 
downward. This can be partially attributed 
to a reduction in total generation, as well 
as the first full year of operation of Unit 4 
since its conversion to biomass from coal.
Our UK gas generation and biomass 
production sites are also permitted for 
releases to air by the Environment Agency 
and Scottish Environment Protection 
Agency respectively. 2019 emissions to  
air were in line with expectations for the 
generation and production levels achieved.
Water Use
Water is utilised at our thermal generation 
sites for operational and cooling 
processes, and losses occur through 
steam and ancillary processes. Procedures 
are in place to manage water system 
efficiency and usage and to ensure that  
all discharge consent limits are met.
The Galloway and Lanark Hydro Scheme 
utilises abstracted water that is returned 
to the environment immediately. 
At Cruachan Power Station, water 
abstracted from the upper reservoir is 
used for generation and water abstracted 
from Loch Awe is used for pumping.

Sourcing Sustainable Biomass
At Drax we use wood pellets sourced 
from sustainably managed working 
forests and residues from forest 
industries to generate low-carbon, 
renewable electricity. We ensure our 
biomass is sustainable and compliant 
with appropriate legislation through a 
combination of proactive supplier 
engagement, third-party certification 
schemes and our own audits and checks.
The Group Sustainability policy outlines 
our requirements and it is evidenced and 
included in biomass supplier contracts. 
Details of our due diligence process are 
available at www.drax.com/sustainability.
Responsible Sourcing Policy for Biomass
In 2019, we published Responsible 
Sourcing: A policy for biomass from 
sustainable forests, available at www.
drax.com/sustainability/responsible-
sourcing/. This Responsible Sourcing 
policy for biomass strengthens our 
approach in line with recommendations 
made by a report commissioned by the 
European Climate Foundation. This is  
to provide further assurance that the 
sustainable biomass we source makes  
a net positive contribution to climate 
change, protects and enhances 
biodiversity and has a positive social 
impact on local communities.
The Responsible Sourcing policy outlines 
our forest biomass sustainability 
commitments:
1. We will reduce carbon dioxide 
emissions
We are committed to ensuring the 
biomass we use makes a positive 
contribution to tackling the climate 
change crisis and fulfilling the UK’s  
Paris Agreement targets.
2. We will protect the natural environment
We recognise our duty to keep forests 
thriving and to respect the many benefits 
they bring, including carbon storage, 
protection of soil and water quality, 
supporting biodiversity and provision  
of habitat.
3. We will support people and 
communities
From state-owned forests to 
smallholdings, and from the US Southeast 
to the Baltic states, forest owners, forest 
workers and communities in our sourcing 
areas are bound by their common reliance 
on forests for employment, wellbeing and 
quality of life.
4. We will invest in research,  
outreach and intervention
The strength of our collaboration  
with others will improve the sourcing  
choices we make. We are committed  
to working with governments, non-
governmental organisations, academia 
and other stakeholders to continually 
improve biomass sourcing and develop 
best practice.
Independent Advisory Board
During the year, we established an 
Independent Advisory Board (IAB)  
of scientists and leaders in the field 
of sustainability to provide impartial 
advice and guidance. The IAB will 
advise on feedstock options, forest 
science and how Drax can optimise 
carbon benefits. It will also give 
advice on the role of sustainable 
biomass in Drax’s climate change 
mitigation activities and in 
supporting the transition to a  
net zero energy system.
The advice from the IAB means our 
stakeholders can be assured that 
Drax will keep our Sustainability and 
Responsible Sourcing policies under 
review and that the biomass we use 
follows the latest scientific research 
and best practice.
The independent group is chaired  
by Professor Sir John Beddington, 
former UK government Chief 
Scientific Adviser. It will meet twice  
a year and will provide feedback and 
make recommendations on Drax’s 
sustainable biomass approach and 
performance, which will be published 
on our website.
  
As the science 
evolves, we 
will make 
recommendations 
to ensure that 
the biomass 
used at Drax 
makes a positive 
contribution to 
our climate and 
the environment.”

Our Sustainable Biomass Sourcing 
Requirements
At Drax, all our biomass suppliers must 
demonstrate that all necessary 
sustainability and legal requirements are 
met. Supplier compliance is evidenced 
either by our own checks and third-party 
audits or by Sustainable Biomass Program 
(SBP) certification. Drax was instrumental 
in the creation of SBP, which is a 
certification system for woody biomass. 
We encourage our suppliers to progress 
from our own checks and third-party 
audits commissioned by Drax towards SBP 
certification. In 2019 93% of the woody 
biomass we sourced was SBP certified,  
an increase compared to 86% in 2018  
and exceeding our target of 92% for 2019.
No concerns regarding biomass supplier 
sustainability compliance were raised  
or escalated to the Group Ethics and 
Business Conduct Committee or the 
Executive Committee in 2019.

Maintaining Forest Carbon Stocks
We are committed to sourcing 
sustainable biomass that 
contributes to the long-term 
maintenance of growing stock  
and productivity and that helps to 
improve the health and quality of 
forests at a local and regional level.
We monitor forest inventory  
data and local industry trends,  
in addition to certification and  
our auditing process, to determine 
whether biomass demand is having 
an impact on regional forest 
industries. This allows us to make 
informed sourcing decisions.
Drax has recently completed the 
first phase of our planned 
Catchment Area Analysis reports  
at the Drax Biomass Amite and 
Morehouse Bioenergy Plants in the 
US South and also for our suppliers 
in Estonia. These reports are 
available on the Drax website. The 
aim of this analysis is to evaluate 
the trends occurring in the forestry 
sector around the plant and to 
determine what impact the pellet 
mill may have had in influencing 
those trends, positively or 
negatively. This includes the impact 
on harvesting levels, carbon stock, 
growth rate, wood prices and the 
production of all wood products.
The “total growing stock” is the 
amount of wood stored in the 
forest. Between 2006 and 2018  
the total growing stock surrounding 
the Drax Biomass Morehouse 
Bioenergy Plant increased by  
68 million metric tonnes.
Biomass Sources in 2019
In 2019 our biomass was sourced from established, responsibly managed working forests in the US South, Europe, Canada, 
South America and Russia. To enhance our biomass supply chain transparency, we provide detailed supply chain information  
at Drax ForestScope http://forestscope.info.

Biomass Supply Chain Emissions
We monitor each step in the supply chain 
to ensure our requirements are met and 
greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions 
associated with producing our biomass 
are calculated according to regulatory 
requirements.
The UK Government has set a limit on 
biomass supply chain GHG emissions 
which must be met by generators to be 
eligible for support under the Renewables 
Obligation and Contract for Difference 
schemes. The current limit is 285 
kgCO2-eq/MWh of electricity, reducing to 
200 kgCO2-eq/MWh of electricity in 2020. 
In 2019, our average biomass supply chain 
GHG emissions amounted to 124 kgCO2-
eq/MWh* of electricity. This is lower than 
our 2018 average biomass supply chain 
GHG emissions and 56% less than the  
UK Government limit.

source catchment metrics to be used  
as common indicators across all our 
sourcing geographies. These are: forest 
cover, biodiversity, carbon stock and 
socio-economic wellbeing.
Looking Ahead
During 2020, we will continue piloting 
technology options in other geographies 
with third party providers. We aim to  
be in a position to share more widely  
the selected technology, programme 
challenges and more detailed output

Healthy Forest Landscapes 
Our Partnership with Earthworm
Drax has partnered with Earthworm 
Foundation (formerly The Forest Trust)  
to support our approach to responsible 
biomass sourcing. Earthworm are  
not-for -profit, responsible sourcing 
experts, experienced in working with 
corporate entities developing landscape 
scale approaches in similar commodity 
supply chains.
The core programme we are jointly 
pioneering has been called Healthy 
Forest Landscapes.
Healthy Forest Landscapes Programme
At Drax, our approach to sourcing 
biomass responsibly is governed by 
environmental regulation, our 
Sustainability and Responsible Sourcing 
policies, our own checks and third-party 
audits or Sustainable Biomass Program 
(SBP) certification. 
We recognise such traditional 
approaches and certification audits  
are detailed and, although we publish 
summaries of the output, are not readily 
digestible by a wide, interested audience. 
The Healthy Forest Landscapes 
programme aims to provide further 
objective and quantified transparency 
and assurance on our ecological, social 
and economic impacts in our supply 
catchment areas. The programme is 
piloting an approach to capturing 
remotely sensed data, and other credible 
origin publicly available information,  
and sharing the arising metrics that 
consider the entire source catchment 
area we are operating in – albeit that  
the Drax demand is only one small part  
of a larger, dynamic market for wood  
in each catchment.
Alongside this, we are looking for 
opportunities to proactively intervene,  
as appropriate and feasible, in those 
instances where changes in our sourcing 
landscapes have been identified.
Developing our Programme Approach
During the year, we undertook a 
stakeholder engagement process with 
Earthworm in the source catchment  
area around one of our pellet mills and 
with other stakeholders. We identified 
and confirmed four key forest biomass 
the approach with other purchasers  
of wood products derived from the  
same geographies to test the appetite  
for broader collaborative adoption.
Over the next four years, we aim to  
roll out the Healthy Forest Landscapes 
programme for all our wood source 
catchment areas. Ultimately Drax will  
be able to track and report these key 
metrics for our specific and aggregate 
impact on key dimensions of forest 
landscape health in a very timely  
and accessible way.
Piloting Technology Options
In 2019, we began to pilot technology 
options to establish how best to gather 
the data needed to provide credible 
and replicable measures for our 
identified metrics.
We piloted the use of big data  
and remote sensing in the source 
catchment area of our Amite 
BioEnergy Plant in Mississippi, USA. 
Big data and automated interpretation 
of satellite imagery was applied to 
develop a time series from before our 
plant started operation of forest cover, 
biodiversity and carbon stock metrics.
Forest Cover Maps
The forest cover analysis is arguably 
the simplest, of the metrics. 
The mapping captures the changes  
in forest cover across the Amite source 
catchment area from 2010, before  
the Amite BioEnergy Plant was 
commissioned in 2015, until 2018. 
Analysis then shows forest cover,  
in aggregate, modestly increasing  
over the time series – supporting  
our commitment and other publicly 
available data that there has been  
no deforestation in the catchment. 
Detailed analysis shows a working 
landscape where forests are harvested 
and replanted, as we’d expect, in  
a continuous cycle. Satellite data 
supports on the ground analysis 
(Forest Inventory and Analysis data) 
that also indicates an increase in  
forest cover of 1% (4,000 ha) since  
the plant opened.

Social
People and Culture
We work to maintain consistently high 
standards in our employment practices 
and all our colleagues benefit from 
policies to support them in the workplace. 
These include policies designed to enable 
different work and lifestyle preferences, 
processes for employees to raise 
grievances or concerns about safety, 
along with supporting a diverse and 
inclusive workplace. Our people strategy 
focuses on valuing our people, driving 
business performance and developing 
talent to deliver our strategic and 
operational objectives.
During 2019, we focused on the 
integration of our new Generation 
colleagues following the acquisition  
of hydro and gas generation assets in 
December 2018. We reorganised our 
structure to align with our business 
strategy. We are centralising Finance, 
Procurement, HR and Internal 
Communications in order to deliver core 
services consistently across the Group.
Investing in the development of our 
people is essential to the delivery of  
our business strategy. Our Potential  
and Succession processes enable senior 
leaders to identify individuals with the 
skills and capability needed for critical 
roles. Individuals identified can be 
nominated for our Future Creators 
programme. Launched in 2019, the 
programme is designed to develop and 
retain 22 high-potential individuals  
and grow our leadership pipeline. Each 
individual has a personal development 
plan and an Executive Committee mentor 
with whom they meet regularly 
throughout the year. A One Drax award 
may also be awarded for those identified 
as having potential to add significant 
value to Drax.
Diversity and Inclusion
Drax Group is fully committed to the 
elimination of unlawful and unfair 
discrimination and we value the benefits 
that a diverse workforce brings to the 
organisation. Our goal is to create and 
maintain a working environment that is 
both safe and supportive of all our people 
and where every employee has the 
opportunity to realise their potential.
Our Diversity and Inclusion Steering 
Group meets monthly to consider and 
recommend plans to increase diversity 
and inclusion. The Steering Group is 
co-sponsored by the Chief 
Transformation Officer and Director  
of Corporate Affairs, both of whom are 
members of the Executive Committee. 
Our 2019 progress included the roll out  
of eLearning training to all managers, to 
understand and promote appreciation to 
correct unconscious bias. We introduced 
a voluntary keep in touch days process 
for colleagues on parental leave and 
reviewed internal data on gender pay.  
We also focused on recruitment and 
added a diversity and equality statement 
to our careers webpages. We hosted 
around 100 female students from our 
partner schools at Drax Power Station  
in November to meet female colleagues 
and understand the diverse career 
opportunities in our sector.
Going forward we will set diversity and 
inclusion objectives for all managers and 
include diversity training in our leadership 
and management development 
programmes. In our recruitment 
practices, we will provide gender ratio 
guidance for interview lists and more 
broadly seek to improve the gender and 
diversity balance for our apprentice and 
graduate recruitment. Through our My 
Voice Forums we will also seek colleague 
views on establishing diversity networks.
In our 2019 annual survey, we included 
questions on diversity and inclusion and 
we will continue to track our performance 
in this area.

Employee Representation 
and Engagement
We have two main sets of arrangements 
to engage colleagues and provide them 
with representation across the Group.  
We engage with colleagues who are 
represented by trade unions (22% of  
our workforce is covered by collective 
bargaining) and we have employee 
representative consultation and 
information arrangements in place  
for employees with individual 
employment contracts.
We communicate with our workforce 
through channels including our intranet, 
quarterly newsletter and Open Forum 
meetings. Colleagues can ask our Group 
CEO questions through a weekly online 
question and answer portal, with the 
CEO’s responses shared across the Group. 
During the year, we established My Voice 
Forums, one for each business unit  
and each with up to 12 colleague 
representatives. The Forum Chairs meet 
quarterly with our Group CEO and Group 
Chair to provide feedback on topics raised 
by colleagues. For more information  
on our workforce engagement, please 
see the case study on page 28.
We track employee engagement through 
our annual survey and in 2019 this was 
completed by 67% of employees. Key 
themes highlighted included colleague 
careers, manager development and the 
wellbeing of our colleagues. Responding 
to themes raised in our 2018 survey,  
we introduced employee volunteering 
days and established the My Voice 
Forums as an additional colleague 
feedback mechanism.
Health, Safety and Wellbeing
As explained by our CEO Will Gardiner 
(see page 12), the health, safety and 
wellbeing of our employees and 
contractors is vital to the success  
of the Group and remains our priority.
In 2019, we established our vision for 
health and safety with One Safe Drax: 
everyone, every day, safe and well.  
The building blocks to this are Safe 
People, Safe Systems & Process, and 
Safety Assurance.
Safe People
Suitably trained, qualified and 
experienced people who know 
what’s expected of them and choose 
to do the right thing.
Safe Systems and Process
Fit for purpose plant, operations and 
maintenance activities. Robust 
management systems.
Safety Assurance
The checks and balances put in place 
to ensure things are working as 
intended and to provide continual 
improvement.
Women of the 
Future Event Inspires 
Next Generation
In November 2019 we hosted our first 
Women of the Future event at Drax 
Power Station. Around 100 girls from 
local schools and colleges, aged 
between 14 and 18, attended the  
event, as part of our ongoing efforts  
to encourage young women to study 
science, technology, engineering and 
maths (STEM) subjects, increase 
diversity in our workforce and support 
the communities where we operate. 
Female colleagues ran group activities, 
games and mini workshops to illustrate 
the skills they use in their daily jobs  
and explained their own career stories.

We have Safety Management Systems 
(SMS) in place to ensure safe workplaces 
for all our people. At Drax Power Station, 
the SMS is certified to OHSAS 18001 and 
subject to regular audits. Our hydro and 
gas generation assets have an integrated 
management system covering Safety, 
Environment & Quality and the safety 
component will transition to ISO 45001  
in 2020. Our Pellet Production sites in  
the US meet the requirements of OSHA 
1910 and the SMS is aligned with, but  
not certified to, OHSAS 18001. At our 
Customers and Core Services sites in the 
UK, we began implementing a Health and 
Safety Management System in 2019, to 
create a health and safety culture which 
prevents accidents and promotes both 
physical and mental wellbeing.
Safety performance is reported and 
reviewed regularly by each local 
management team. Incidents and 
findings are shared across the Company 
via safety bulletins, enabling preventative 
action to be taken to mitigate the risk  
of future occurrences. Each business  
unit reports monthly on Key Performance 
Indicators (KPIs), including Total 
Recordable Incident rate (TRIR), Lost 
Time Incident Rate (LTIR). Business units 
also report Reporting of Injuries, Diseases 
and Dangerous Occurrences Regulations 
(RIDDORs) to regulators in the UK. The 
Board receives monthly reports.
In 2019, we established the Safety, 
Health, Environment and Wellbeing 
Leadership Executive Committee 
(SHEWLEC). The Committee is chaired by 
the CEO Generation and meets quarterly 
to receive reports regarding significant 
safety, health, environmental and 
wellbeing aspects that are prominent

within the business. The Committee also 
establishes standards for relevant health, 
safety, environmental and wellbeing 
issues. It oversees the implementation  
of relevant policies and principles across 
the business, reflecting Group philosophy, 
best practice and regulatory and 
statutory requirements. It also oversees 
governance arrangements across the 
business. Key risks and mitigation 
associated with health, safety, 
environment and welfare are routinely 
reported to the SHEWLEC. The 
Committee also receives a summary  
of results of internal and external audits 
where the scope falls within the remit  
of the Committee. In addition, the 
Committee receives and considers 
potential implications for the Group of 
information regarding any significant 
changes in regulation or legislation  
and oversees how business units amend 
their arrangements accordingly.
Key issues raised in 2019 include: 
management of dust at relevant locations, 
tracking of findings from third-party 
audits, development and implementation 
of a Group-wide Wellbeing policy and 
framework and standardisation of a set  
of group-wide minimum standards for 
safety Golden Rules.
In 2019, Drax introduced Intelex as our 
Group reporting tool for Safety, Health, 
Environment and Production incidents. 
The system went live at our Pellet 
Production sites in July and at Drax 
Power Station, our Customer sites and 
our Head Office in November. We are 
considering plans to align all Drax sites  
to a common integrated incident 
management system.
Process safety is a key focus for the 
operational business units. Drax 
implemented lessons learned from the 
fire at Drax Power Station pellet handling 
system in 2017 to make the plant more 
robust to potential ignition events by 
installing additional fire detection and 
suppression equipment. Work on the 
installation will complete in 2020. 
Incoming fuel quality and metallic 
contamination in fuel are key 
performance measures, since these 
factors can influence levels of dust, 
potential for fuel line blockages or 
ignition events. In 2019, there was greater 
collaboration with the supply chain and 
our UK port operators. Drax held a 
conference in April to share best practice.
Following a major safety incident in 
December 2018 at our Pellet Production 
site LaSalle in the US, we identified 42 
action items. In 2019, we implemented 
and closed these corrective action items 
and focused on supervisor training and 
improving safety culture.
In 2019, multiple assurance audits were 
completed across the Group. Drax Power 
Station was externally audited to OHSAS 
18001 with no major findings and the 
Health and Safety Executive completed  
a scheduled control of major accident 
hazards (COMAH) audit with no major 
findings.

Building a sustainable business continued
Internal Audit commissioned Turner & 
Townsend to complete a Group-wide 
audit of health and safety which 
confirmed that the control framework  
is generally designed and operating 
effectively, and effective health and 
safety management systems were in 
place. The audit made recommendations 
to help advance the management of 
health and safety across the Group  
as it evolves and an action plan to 
implement the recommendations  
has been put in place.
Wellbeing
We recognise the importance of 
promoting the physical and mental 
wellbeing of all our colleagues. In 2019, 
we began implementing a holistic 
Wellbeing programme across Drax, 
covering the three areas of Healthy Body, 
Healthy Mind and Healthy Workplace.  
To oversee the programme and measure 
progress, we set up a Wellbeing Steering 
Committee. The Committee represents  
all business units across Drax and meets 
monthly to ensure effective 
implementation.
In 2019, we introduced a single private 
medical insurance and reward 
programme to our UK colleagues. We aim 
to achieve complete coverage for UK 
colleagues in 2020, after the roll out to 
our hydro and gas generation sites. In 
addition, all colleagues have access to an 
Employee Assistance Programme.
Our Customers business continued to 
expand their workplace wellbeing 
education programmes in 2019. We have 
trained nearly 200 Customers colleagues 
over 2018 and 2019 on the topics of 
mental health and emotional resilience.
Positive Social Impact
We provide jobs, support economic 
growth, pay tax responsibly and deliver 
charitable and employee volunteering 
initiatives in the communities where  
we operate.
Our social strategy focuses on improving 
opportunity and social mobility by 
promoting education, science, 
technology, engineering and maths 
(STEM) skills and employability. We signed 
the UK cross-party Social Mobility Pledge, 
demonstrating our commitment to 
accessing and progressing talent from  
all backgrounds. In 2019, we recruited  
18 apprentices and 6 graduates. This 
included expanding our apprenticeship 
scheme to Drax’s Scottish sites where  
we recruited 5 new apprentices. Our 
partnership with Teach First enabled the 
recruitment, placement and training of 
eight STEM teachers in 2019, improving 
the STEM education of 1,000 students.
We pledged £100,000 support over  
four years to support the Galloway Glens 
Landscape Partnership where our 
Galloway Hydro Scheme operates.  
The funding will be used to promote  
the region’s heritage, boost the local 
economy and support sustainability 
initiatives in local communities.
Community and Charitable Giving
During the year, we launched our  
new Community and Charity policy, 
strengthening our charitable giving 
across the business and enabling 
colleagues to volunteer one working  
day annually. In 2019, Drax colleagues 
volunteered over 2,000 hours and  
we contributed £290,000 through 
community partnerships, employee match 
funding, payroll giving, our community 
fund and national fundraising days.
Drax Power Station welcomed 9,763 
visitors in 2019. Our tours are focused on 
learning outcomes and tailored for visitors 
of all ages. Cruachan Power Station in 
Scotland received 36,646 visitors in 2019 
and offers free tours to school children 
and academic institutions.
Wellbeing at Drax
The Drax-wide Wellbeing programme 
encompasses three areas and focuses 
on building resilience.
• Healthy Body – A healthy body 
means looking after yourself first – 
finding ways to incorporate a 
healthy diet, an active lifestyle and 
healthy habits into the routines of 
work and home.
• Healthy Mind – A healthy mind is 
about colleagues being able to focus 
on what’s important at work.
• Healthy Workplace – We believe 
that a healthy workplace at Drax 
supports and encourages healthy 
behaviours in our colleagues, 
making healthy choices easy.

Ethics and Integrity
At Drax Group, we are committed to 
conducting business ethically and in 
compliance with all relevant laws and 
regulations. We do not tolerate any form 
of bribery, corruption or other unethical 
business conduct.
Our compliance framework consists  
of principles, policies and guidance.  
The principles are set out in our ethics 
handbook, Doing the right thing, which 
identifies the behaviours expected from 
colleagues and contractors on topics 
including human rights, ethical business 
conduct and integrity. The Doing the 
right thing principles form part of our 
terms of employment and have been 
converted into a series of training videos 
used in our new starter induction 
programme. The scope of Doing the  
right thing will be expanded with the 
implementation of a new Group Code  
of Conduct in 2020.
Our policies and guidance documents 
provide further instruction. These include 
our Group Corporate Crime policy and 
Gifts and Hospitality, Conflicts of Interest 
and Due Diligence guides. In 2019, we 
published board-approved updates to our 
Group Corporate Crime policy, Fair 
Competition policy and associated guides.
In 2019, we established and deployed new 
eLearning across the Group, including 
Data Protection and Anti-Bribery and 
Corruption training for all colleagues. 
Targeted training on Supply Chain Human 
Rights, the Criminal Finances Act and Fair 
Competition was provided for managers 
and teams in higher risk areas. Refresher 
training was also provided on Market 
Abuse Regulation for the Board, 
Executive Committee and relevant 
management and employees.
Responsibility for Ethics
Governance of our framework is overseen 
by the Group Ethics and Business 
Conduct Committee (EBCC). The EBCC 
comprises of senior leaders, meets 
quarterly and is chaired by the Group 
CFO. EBCC activities are reported 
annually to the Audit Committee. 
Management across the Group is 
responsible for demonstrating leadership 
on ethical matters and supporting teams 
to apply our ethical principles, set out  
in our Doing the right thing booklet,  
and business ethics policies.
Our Group Business Ethics team manages 
our various business ethics programmes, 
taking steps to understand our risk 
profile, developing policy and procedures, 
awareness raising and training, as well as 
investigating any potential breaches of 
policy, and administrating our external 
Speak Up (Whistleblowing) service. Our 
Internal Audit team provides assurance 
on the robustness of our business ethics 
programmes and any recommendations 
for improvement are duly considered and 
as appropriate, implemented.
The Group Business Ethics team conducts 
annual risk assessments of each of its 
programmes, which relate to areas 
including anti-bribery and corruption, 
conflicts of interest, data protection,  
fair competition, and human rights in  
the supply chain. This is to ensure policy 
and procedures remain fit for purpose  
and to recommend any further mitigation 
measures. Our annual review timetable 
also includes a review of the Group gifts 
and hospitality record and a colleague 
business ethics declaration. Results of 
annual reviews, details of investigations 
conducted, whistleblowing reports, and 
audit outcomes are reported quarterly to 
both the EBCC and the Audit Committee.
Working with Others
We are a signatory to the UN Global 
Compact (UNGC) and maintained our 
representation on their Modern Slavery 
Working Group in 2019. This enables us to 
benchmark our compliance programmes 
and exchange experience with peers, 
with a particular focus on our response  
to modern slavery.
We seek to work with suppliers, partners, 
agents, intermediaries, contractors, 
consultants and counterparties whose 
standards are consistent with our own. 
Third parties are subject to our 
precontract due diligence checks and 
regular monitoring through the lifecycle 
of the contract, via our third-party due 
diligence system. In cases where a red 
flag is raised, we follow an EBCC-
approved escalation protocol. Depending 
on the nature of the flagged issue, we 
may decide not to engage with a new 
third party, to engage on a conditional 
basis, to collaborate on remedial action  
or to end an existing business relationship.
In 2019, we enhanced our due diligence 
process, which assesses for risks 
associated with financial crime, conflicts 
of interest, anti-competitive behaviour, 
trade sanctions and other improprieties, 
such as modern slavery. We centralised 
these across the business.
Anti-bribery and Anti-corruption
Our internal processes ensure 
consistency with our zero-tolerance 
approach to bribery and corruption. 
Geographic risk is factored into our 
third-party due diligence system. 
Conducting business in higher risk 
countries must receive prior approval 
from the Group Ethics and Business 
Conduct Committee.
Following country approval, third parties 
are then put forward for our due diligence 
process. Suppliers in higher risk countries 
receive a higher level of initial due 
diligence and ongoing monitoring.  
We also screen the affiliates (directors, 
shareholders) of these suppliers and 
refresh their information on a more 
frequent basis, compared to our lower risk 
suppliers. Third parties with operations  
in, or linked to, higher risk countries are 
escalated to the EBCC for review prior  
to engagement. Ongoing monitoring is 
performed with new information provided 
to the Group Ethics and Business 
Conduct Committee, as appropriate.
At Drax Group, we 
are committed to 
conducting business 
ethically and in 
compliance with  
all relevant laws  
and regulations.

Building a sustainable business continued
With the implementation of a Supplier 
Code of Conduct in 2020, we will 
emphasise our requirement for our 
suppliers and contractors working on our 
behalf to challenge unethical behaviour 
and promote a “speak up” culture. We  
will provide the details of our Speak Up 
service for their use.
Data Privacy and Security
We take seriously the privacy and security 
of the personal data we control. We are 
committed to maintaining effective 
privacy and security programmes to 
ensure our people, customers and the 
third parties we engage with have 
confidence in our data handling practices.
The EBCC supports and oversees the 
Group privacy programme and reviewed 
the first formal programme risk 
assessment and risk register in 2019. In 
addition, policies, guides, privacy notices, 
third party due diligence questionnaires 
and contractual terms were updated and 
our first eLearning refresher training 
(“Overview of Data Protection”) was 
developed and deployed across the 
Group. Internal Audit completed an  
audit of our privacy programme and  
no red-rated findings were identified.  
We continue to monitor and adapt our 
compliance with the requirements of the 
General Data Protection Regulation, the 
UK Data Protection Act 2018, regulatory 
guidance and other associated legislation 
such as the e-Privacy & Electronic 
Communications Regulation.
Security risk management has continued 
to mature through 2019, with a 
comprehensive improvement plan 
implemented and intended to enable  
key IT Security control effectiveness  
to achieve best practice. The plan was 
initiated in 2019 and work will continue 
through 2020. In addition, a security 
governance structure was put in place  
to assess and communicate the evolving 
threat landscape and identify appropriate 
responses. An ongoing security 
assurance programme is in place.
Labour and Human Rights
Our commitment to the protection of 
human rights includes not tolerating the 
use of underage workers or forced labour. 
This is set out in our Corporate Crime 
policy and our Corporate Responsibility 
(CR) statement.
Our CR statement outlines the standard 
of ethical business conduct we expect 
from suppliers. Businesses in our supply 
chain should offer a safe workplace for 
their employees that is free from harm, 
intimidation, harassment and fear. We 
have incorporated further provisions in 
our statement template to manage these 
risks within our procurement contracts 
and further advanced this effort in 2019 
with the drafting of a Code of Conduct 
and a Supplier Code of Conduct.
We maintain risk-based security controls 
to protect our employee and customer 
data, by detecting and preventing threats 
and security breaches. In addition to 
traditional security measures, we 
undertake advanced threat monitoring 
and analytics measurement intended to 
detect, identify, respond to and resolve 
cyber threats and attacks. We are 
conscious that such threats continue  
to change. Accordingly, our security 
programme seeks to evolve our controls 
and response to cyber threats.
Speak Up (Whistleblowing)
As part of our commitment to 
transparency and openness, we 
encourage those working for or on behalf 
of Drax to raise genuine concerns about 
practices which could breach laws, 
regulations or standards. This is 
supported by our Doing the right thing 
handbook and Speak Up (Whistleblowing) 
policy. Colleagues can either raise 
concerns internally, through line 
management, a member of the Group 
Business Ethics team, the Group 
Company Secretary (Whistleblowing 
Officer), directly with a member of the 
EBCC or externally through our 
anonymous third-party Speak Up service. 
The Group Business Ethics team manages 
the Speak Up (Whistleblowing) 
programme. The team maintains relevant 
records and investigates ethical-related 
matters under the supervision of the 
Whistleblowing Officer and governance 
of the EBCC and Board. Where required, 
relevant senior leadership are consulted, 
and a course of action agreed. Drax has a 
zero tolerance of retaliation and considers 
it a disciplinary matter to victimise or 
retaliate in any way against someone  
who has raised a genuine concern. 
During 2019, communications on 
speaking up were rolled out to all 
colleagues, temporary colleagues and 
certain contractors as part of the 2019 
Business Ethics policy deployment and 
eLearning programme. In 2019, six 
concerns were reported via internal 
channels and two via our anonymous 
third-party Speak Up service. This is an 
increase from zero reports in the previous 
year and demonstrates the effectiveness 
of our efforts to increase awareness  
of our reporting channels and promote  
an open, “speak up” culture.
Modern Slavery
Our Modern Slavery Working Group, 
chaired by a member of the Business 
Ethics team, oversees a three-year 
rolling programme and reports 
quarterly to the EBCC.
In 2019, we published our third 
board-approved modern slavery 
statement in accordance with the UK 
Modern Slavery Act (www.drax.com/
modern-slavery-act/). It describes the 
steps we are taking to reduce the risk 
of modern slavery in our supply chain. 
We keep our programme and 
statement under review to ensure it 
reflects our activities, global presence 
and wider evolving practice.

Viability statement
In accordance with the UK corporate governance code, 
the Directors have assessed the prospects of the Group 
over a period significantly longer than the 12 months 
required by the going concern provision.
The assessment of viability was led by the 
Group Chief Executive and Chief Financial 
Officer in conjunction with divisional  
and functional management teams and 
presented to the Board as part of the 
annual planning process. In reviewing  
this assessment, the Board has 
considered the principal risks faced by 
the Group, relevant financial forecasts 
and sensitivities, the availability of 
adequate funding and the strength  
of the Group’s control environment.
Assessment period
The Board conducted this assessment 
over a period of three years, selected for 
the following reasons:
• The Group’s Business Plan (Plan) which 
is prepared annually, updated twice 
during the year and also used for 
strategic decision-making, includes  
a range of financial forecasts and 
associated sensitivity analysis.  
This Plan covers a three-year period  
in detail, before extending into the 
medium term. 
• Within the three-year period liquid 
commodity market curves and 
established contract positions are used 
in the forecasts. Liquid curves typically 
cover a one to two-year window and 
contracts cover periods between one 
and ten years. In particular, the Group 
benefits from the stable and material 
earnings stream available from the  
CfD until 2027. Selecting a three-year 
period balances short-term market 
liquidity against longer-term 
contractual positions.
• There is limited certainty around  
the Group’s markets and regulatory 
regimes. However, in selecting a 
three-year period the Board has 
assumed no material changes to the 
medium-term regulatory environment 
and associated support regimes 
beyond those already announced  
at the date of this report.
Review of principal risks
The Group’s principal risks and 
uncertainties, set out in detail on pages 
54 to 61, have been considered over  
the period.
The principal risks with the potential to 
exert significant influence on viability are: 
commodity price changes, political and 
regulatory changes, and plant operating 
failures. A significant adverse change to 
the status of each risk has the potential 
to place material financial stress on  
the Group.
The risks were evaluated, where possible, 
to assess the potential impact of each  
on the viability of the Group, should  
that risk arise in its unmitigated form.  
The potential inputs were included, 
where appropriate, as sensitivities to  
the Plan and considered by the Board  
as part of the approval process, in 
January 2020, before the Plan was 
adopted by the Group.
The Group has a proven track record of 
adapting to changes to its environment 
and deploying innovative solutions to 
protect its financial performance. 
Previous adverse events have arisen and 
provided challenges which tested the 
ability of the Group to deliver on its 
targets but, on each occasion, it has been 
able to respond positively and manage 
the impact. This provides the Board with 
confidence that risks can be sufficiently 
mitigated, and viability can be maintained, 
during the assessment period. 
Review of financial forecasts
The Plan considers the Group’s financial 
position, performance, cash flows, credit 
metrics and other key financial ratios and 
was most recently updated to reflect 
current market and external environment 
conditions in December 2019. It is built  
by business and segment and includes 
growth assumptions appropriate to the 
markets each business serves. 
The Plan includes certain assumptions, 
the most material of which relate to 
commodity market price curves and 
levels of subsidy support available to  
the Group through the generation of 
biomass-fuelled renewable power.  
It is underpinned by the stable revenues 
available through the generation of 
CfD-backed electricity and contracted 
sales from the Customers business.
The Plan is subject to stress testing, 
which involves the construction of 
reasonably foreseeable scenarios, 
including those aligned to the principal 
risks, which test the robustness of the 
Plan when key variables are flexed both 
individually and in unison. Where such  
a scenario suggests a risk to viability,  
the availability and quantum of mitigating 
actions is considered. 
The Board considers the most material 
scenario in the assessment period to be  
a significant deterioration of commodity 
market prices, leading to a fall in the 
available price for power and thus a fall  
in the margins available to the Group from 
power generation and supply activities. 
This impact would however be partially 
mitigated through the earnings stability 
provided by the CfD, the Group’s ability  
to trade effectively in volatile power 
markets and reductions to discretionary 
expenditure. 
Drax Group plc Annual report and accounts 2019
53
Based on its review, the Board is satisfied 
the viability of the Group would be 
preserved in a range of scenarios, with 
various mitigating actions available, 
sufficient to manage the risk, including 
significant deterioration of commodity 
market prices.
Availability of adequate 
funding
The sources of funding available to the 
Group are set out in note 4.3 to the 
consolidated financial statements (page 
163). The Board expects these sources, 
along with stable cash flows generated  
by the Group from its normal operations, 
to provide adequate levels of funding to 
support the execution of the Group’s Plan.
During the year the Group drew down and 
subsequently restructured £550 million 
of its £725 million acquisition bridge 
facility that was used to partially fund  
the acquisition of the hydro and gas 
generation assets. In May 2019 an 
additional $200 million of the existing 
2025 6.625% USD loan notes was issued, 
the proceeds of which were used to repay 
£150 million of the acquisition bridge 
facility. In July 2019 the refinancing of the 
remaining £400 million was concluded  
in the form of two new facilities with 
combined proceeds of £500 million, a 
£375 million UK infrastructure private 
placement and an environmental, social 
and governance facility of £125 million. 
These arrangements both reduced the 
overall cost of debt and extended the 
maturity profile to 2029 to further 
strengthen the balance sheet. 
The Board is confident that the Group  
has access to a range of options to 
maintain a diverse and well-balanced 
capital structure. 
Expectations
The Directors have considered a range  
of factors in their assessment of viability 
over the next three years, including the 
latest Plan, scenario analysis, levels of 
funding, the control environment and  
the principal risks and uncertainties 
facing the Group. The Directors have  
also considered the availability of actions 
within their control in the event of 
plausible negative scenarios occurring. 
The Directors have a reasonable 
expectation that the Group will be able  
to continue in operation and meet its 
liabilities as they fall due over the 
three-year period of their assessment.

Principal risks and uncertainties
The effective management of risk supports  
the delivery of our strategy
Identifying, assessing and managing risks 
across the Group is an integral part of the 
delivery of our strategy. We manage the 
commercial and operational risks faced 
by the Group in accordance with policies 
approved by the Board.
The Board is responsible for determining 
risk appetite and ensuring the 
effectiveness of risk management and 
internal controls across the Group. The 
Group has a comprehensive system of 
governance controls to manage key risks.
Group approach to risk 
management
The risk appetite determined by the 
Board varies depending on the risk, and 
guides the principles of the Group’s 
culture, behaviour and the intensity of 
risk management activities in achieving 
our business objectives. We consider a 
range of risk categories including 
environment, health, safety, strategic, 
financial, political, regulatory and 
operational. The Group has a Risk 
Management Policy, approved by the 
Board, which defines the Group’s 
approach to risk management. The key 
elements of the policy are to:
• Identify risks that have the potential to 
threaten the achievement of our 
strategic objectives. We then assess 
the likelihood of the risk occurring and 
possible impact to the business in the 
event it should arise. This assessment 
is based on a risk scoring matrix to 
ensure we take a consistent approach. 
• Assign responsibility and define 
accountabilities for the identification, 
assessment and management of risk 
and provide resources to enable 
appropriate measures to be taken.
• Put in place appropriate mitigating 
controls intended to manage identified 
risks to an acceptable level.
• Escalate and report information on the 
potential risk and the effectiveness of 
the mitigations and controls to support 
management decision making.
• Regularly monitor changes within and 
outside our business, review the 
Group’s principal risks against such 
changes to ensure our analysis remains 
accurate and up-to-date and review 
the effectiveness of mitigation 
strategies and the application of the 
risk framework.
The approach manages, rather than 
eliminates, the risk of failure to achieve 
business objectives, and provides 
reasonable, not absolute, assurance 
against material misstatement or loss.
Risk management governance
The risk management governance 
structure includes Executive Committee 
level principal risk owners and risk 
management committees whose 
responsibilities include:
• Ensuring that risks are identified, 
assessed and managed effectively 
within risk appetites and limits.
• Including new and emerging risks.
• Demonstrating robust governance of 
risk management by reviewing and 
challenging risk management across 
the Group and driving the completion 
of actions to manage risks within risk 
appetites and limits.
• Driving an appropriate risk 
management culture and an 
environment that promotes and 
creates balanced risk-taking behaviour 
and clear accountability.
The risk management committees receive 
reports from business units and risk 
owners. The Executive Committee 
receive reports from the risk management 
committees and principal risk owners and 
undertake deep dive reviews of the 
management of principal risks. 
In addition, the Audit Committee review 
the suitability and effectiveness of risk 
management processes and controls  
on behalf of the Board.
Internal control 
The Group has a well-defined internal 
control system established through 
policies and procedures, documented 
levels of authority which support decision-
making and accountability for day-to-day 
management across the Group. 
The Board has adopted a schedule of 
matters which are required to be brought 
to it for a decision, below which authority 
is delegated through the Executive 
Committee to a combination of sub-
committees and individuals enabling 
them to make decisions on behalf of the 
Group and its businesses for its day-to-
day activities. The internal control system 
is designed to ensure that the directors 
and executive maintain effective 
oversight and direction for all material 
strategic, operational, financial and 
organisational issues. 
Drax Group plc Annual report and accounts 2019
55
Under authority delegated by the Board, 
the Audit Committee, implements a 
programme of internal audits of different 
aspects of the Group’s activities. The 
programme is developed based on an 
assessment of the key risks of the Group, 
the existing assurance and controls in 
place to manage the risks and the core 
financial control framework. The 
programme is reviewed quarterly and 
refreshed to reflect developments within 
the Group as well as changes in wider 
practices, informed by the experience  
of internal and external personnel. 
Internal audits are performed either  
by the in-house team members of the 
internal audit function or by external 
parties where their appointment has  
first been considered and approved by 
the Audit Committee. The findings and 
recommendations from each internal 
audit are documented in a report for 
internal distribution and action. A full 
copy of the report is distributed to the 
Executive Committee and the Audit 
Committee. Each report includes 
management responses to the findings 
and recommendations and details of  
the actions that management propose  
to take. 
Based on the reporting from the 
Executive Committee and the Audit 
Committee undertaken during 2019  
and considered at the meeting of the 
Board held in finalising the annual report 
and financial statements, the Board 
determined that it was not aware of  
any significant deficiency or material 
weakness in the system of internal 
control. For further information on the 
work of the Audit Committee, please see 
the Audit Committee report on page 78.
Principal risks and 
uncertainties 
Risks are reported to the Board and 
disclosed in the Annual Report and 
Accounts under nine principal risk 
headings. The Board has assessed  
the principal risk categories. These  
are broadly unchanged from 2018  
with two exceptions: Transaction risks, 
which was included in 2018 to reflect  
the risks associated with the acquisition 
of hydro and gas assets. The risk category 
has been removed as these assets have 
been integrated successfully into our 
operations during 2019. A new category 
entitled Climate Change has been 
created. This reflects the increasing 
focus on such risks, given the nature of 
our sector and operations, and our work 
to implement the recommendations of 
the Task Force on Climate-related 
Financial Disclosures (TCFD).

Environment, health and safety 
Context
The health, safety and wellbeing of all our employees, 
contractors and visitors is of paramount importance  
to us. We believe that a safe, compliant and sustainable 
business model is critical to the delivery of our strategy 
and crucial for sustained long-term performance. 
Safety is at the heart of our operational philosophy and 
we continue to work across the Group to maintain high 
standards and a culture of safe working. Compliance 
with environmental legislation and our environmental 
permits and consents is essential to ensure the long-
term future of the business.
Risk and impact
• Our operations involve a range of hazards to personnel 
and the environment, that arise from the processes  
we perform and the equipment which we use. This 
includes heavy plant and machinery at our sites in  
the US and UK. 
• The biomass that we use to generate electricity is by 
its nature combustible and the production, preparation 
and transportation (whether within our sites or in 
transit between sites) requires careful management to 
minimise the risk of fire or explosion. For example, in 
the US we produce pellets using a combination of high 
temperature and high-pressure plant, and in the UK we 
operate plant which involves very high temperatures 
and pressures for the generation of electricity at 
400KV for transmission onto the National Grid. 
• Maintaining robust management 
systems designed to mitigate risk.
• Training staff to a high level of 
competence, to appreciate and 
manage environment, health  
and safety risks.
• Continuously reporting events  
and prompt implementation  
of corrective actions.
• Continuously monitoring 
processes to identify trends  
in performance.
• Rigorous auditing of compliance 
against standards, policy and 
procedures.
• Engaging with regulators and 
stakeholders to identify 
improvements to our systems  
and operations.
• Investigating the underlying 
reasons for events and 
implementation of any necessary 
changes in the management 
system and culture.
• Timely identification of future 
legislation and appropriate 
investment to optimise 
performance.
• Effective governance framework 
including an executive level Safety, 
Health, Environment and Wellbeing 
Leadership Executive Committee, 
to oversee governance, review and 
challenge the management of 
safety, health, environment and 
wellbeing risks across the Group.

Changes in factors impacting risk in 2019
Political and regulatory 
Context
• We remain alert to changes in government policy at UK 
and EU level. The energy sector is subject to detailed 
legislation and regulation that is frequently changing 
as the economic and industrial trends towards 
decarbonising and decentralising become stronger.  
In addition, the wider regulatory and compliance 
environment applicable to businesses is also 
increasing with growing requirements in transparency 
and accountability.
Risk and impact
• Changes to UK policy, regulations or tariffs may 
increase the costs to operate, reduce operational 
efficiency and affect our ability to realise our strategy, 
which may adversely affect our financial and 
operational performance, results and cash flows. 
Issues include reform to: legal framework following 
Brexit; data privacy regulation; network access and 
charging arrangements; environmental regulation;  
and consumer service and affordability requirements.
• A more complex and challenging regulatory 
environment increases: the costs to operate, the 
threat of regulatory investigation, the risk of non-
compliance, and penalties/sanctions. Brexit may 
create uncertainty and additional costs associated 
with changes in regulatory reporting.
• Biomass represented 77% of our generation in 2019 
and, longer term, we intend to increase our biomass 
self-supply to 5m tonnes per annum. The regulatory 
environment is evolving which could increase costs 
and mean anticipated returns are significantly lower 
than expectations.
• The future of carbon pricing in the UK is linked to  
the UK’s withdrawal from the EU and the negotiations 
on the future economic partnership. For the period 
beyond 2020, the Government has set out its 
preference to create its own Emissions Trading 
Scheme (ETS), linked to the EU ETS. This outcome 
would be preferable, causing minimal disruption to  
the market, compliance regimes and to the prevailing 
carbon price. However, there is a risk that this 
preference changes or that the UK and EU cannot 
agree a linking negotiation in time. This would result  
in the UK having to transition its carbon pricing system 
to a carbon tax system or other interim mechanism. 
Significant fluctuation in the carbon price, due to 
liquidity issues for example, could occur.
• Engaging with politicians across 
the political spectrum and 
Government officials, to 
understand and influence 
perception, and communicate our 
socioeconomic value in supporting 
the UK’s ambition to achieve net 
zero by 2050. 
• Working with stakeholders to 
maintain Drax as a thought leader 
on priority policy and regulatory 
issues.
• Engaging with regulators and 
industry bodies to influence 
strategic direction of, and ensure 
compliance with, regulatory 
requirements.
• Working with Energy UK to identify 
market improvements, enhance 
competition and develop voluntary 
codes of practice.
• Maintaining regulatory and 
compliance control frameworks to 
mitigate the risk of non-
compliance covering: risk 
assessment; policy development; 
adequate process; training; audit; 
and continual improvement.
=
• Brexit continues to create 
uncertainty. Weakened sterling 
and difficulties in cross border 
trade could influence fuel costs 
and/or lead to customers going 
into financial distress. Delays at 
ports could affect our supplies 
of fuel and components though 
the nature of our dedicated 
supply chain mitigates this risk. 
• Many ancillary services require 
policy, regulatory and market 
change to ensure generators 
are suitably compensated for 
these services.
• Ofgem is reviewing the way in 
which network businesses are 
remunerated and user access  
is procured/costs allocated, 
which will impact the cost base 
of generators and retailers.
• The Government has 
introduced a price cap for 
domestic power retailers;  
we remain vigilant to the risk 
that this could be extended  
to some SMEs.
• The Smart meter roll out 
continues and the obligation to 
install a smart meter for every 
customer by the end of 2020 
(where reasonable steps have 
been exhausted) remains.
• Further failures of small energy 
suppliers (and resulting cost 
mutualisation across the 
industry).
• The Government has confirmed 
that the Carbon Price Support 
(CPS) is set at approximately 
the right level, although the 
longer-term level is dependent 
on how the UK exits the EU and 
prevailing commodity prices.

Changes in factors impacting risk in 2019
Strategic
Context
The Group’s purpose is to enable a zero carbon lower 
cost energy future, with an ambition to become a carbon 
negative company by 2030. This is underpinned by the 
three pillars of the Group’s strategy: 1) to build a long-
term future for biomass; 2) to be the leading provider  
of power system stability, and 3) to give our customers 
control of their energy – delivering long-term growth 
opportunities, including investment in new and emerging 
technologies for alternative fuels, which we believe have 
the potential to support earnings beyond 2027.
The Group aims to deliver higher quality, diversified and 
sustainable earnings, whilst also reducing our exposure 
to volatility in the commodity market and supporting  
the UK’s ambition to achieve net zero by 2050.
Risk and impact
• The vast majority of our business relies on subsidies  
for generating electricity using renewable sources.  
In 2019, Drax received subsidies amounting to £790m. 
Presently, subsidies are expected to continue until 
2027. The date or the scale of the subsidies could 
change which could have a material effect on our 
performance and business prospects.
• Post-2027 biomass generation is dependent upon the 
cost of generation relative to market prices. Delivering 
on our objectives to increase biomass self-supply to  
5m tonnes per annum and reduce the cost of 
generation to £50 per MWh depends on the availability 
of feasible expansion opportunities and successfully 
reducing the current cost of biomass. Biomass is 
accepted by governments as a renewable resource; 
there is a risk that this opinion could change.
• The energy markets in which we operate are evolving 
at a rapid pace. New entrants and new technologies 
compete throughout power generation, system 
services and B2B energy supply and services markets. 
Such competitors may develop more cost effective 
and efficient services than those which Drax is able  
to supply.
• The technologies and materials that we are evaluating 
including BECCS and viable, alternative fuels are new 
and unproven. Any one of the technologies and 
materials that we evaluate could prove technically  
or commercially unfeasible or flawed. We may invest  
in the wrong technologies which are inadequate,  
the time taken to develop them could be longer than 
expected or the costs may be higher or levels of 
expected return lower than we expect (relative to  
the government support that is required to make  
the technologies feasible)
• The Capacity Market ensures security of electricity 
supply by providing a payment for reliable sources  
of capacity. We bid for contracts to supply electricity  
in the Capacity Market auctions. Outcomes from the 
auctions are inherently uncertain. The development  
of new, flexible OCGT and CCGT are also dependent  
on winning contracts with acceptable returns.
• Develop a diversified generation 
capacity with a portfolio of 
biomass, pumped storage, hydro, 
gas-fired and coal generation 
assets.
• Development of a plan to expand 
biomass self-supply capability  
and reduce the cost of biomass  
for generation to create an 
economically sustainable biomass 
generation business without 
subsidy by 2027.
• Working on reducing project costs 
to increase competitiveness in  
the Capacity Market auction; a 
disciplined approach to the auction 
means such projects will only  
go forward upon obtaining a 
suitable contract which meets  
our hurdle rate.
• Implementing a programme of 
targeted investment to:
 
− Incubate new products and 
energy services to bring to 
market.
 
− Research, develop and pilot new 
technologies. 
  In 2019 the Group implemented  
an evolved approach to capital 
allocation. This provides rigour  
and consistency in assessing the 
technical, financial and strategic 
justification of new projects across 
the Group; in particular for 
investments in new and emerging 
technologies.
• Development and delivery of plans 
to implement bio-energy carbon 
capture and storage (BECCS).
=
• Acquisition of a portfolio of 
flexible, low carbon hydro and 
gas generation assets from 
ScottishPower provides 
significant diversification  
of long-term earnings and 
expansion of our renewable 
generation model.
• UK Capacity Market payments 
and auctions reinstated 
following ruling by the 
European Court of Justice.
• Development of a plan to 
expand biomass self-supply 
capability and reduce the cost 
of biomass for generation to 
create an economically 
sustainable biomass generation 
business without subsidy by 
2027, including in 2019:
 
− LaSalle pellet facility now 
fully operational supporting 
self-supply target.
 
− Turbine upgrade programme 
commenced at Drax Power 
Station, improving efficiency 
and reducing maintenance 
costs.

Changes in factors impacting risk in 2019
Biomass acceptability 
Context
Sustainability legislation at EU and UK level and in other 
countries from which we operate and source biomass, 
and public understanding of the benefits of the supply 
chain and technology are evolving. Attitudes to the 
benefits of biomass as a renewable source may not  
align with our strategy and investment case, which may 
impact our plans and mean that actual returns differ 
from those we expected.
Risk and impact
• Sustainability policy changes on the sourcing and use 
of biomass in the UK, EU or other countries in which 
we operate or from which we source biomass could be 
unworkable and make it difficult for us to comply with 
policy requirements and claim subsidy in support of 
economic biomass generation. Changes in policy could 
increase costs, make it difficult to source biomass, or 
reduce the current support for the benefits of 
biomass. 
• Detractors and some environmental non-
governmental organisations (ENGOs) may influence 
policymakers against biomass use resulting in reduced 
support for the benefits of biomass.
• Increased transparency in how we 
evidence sustainability.
• Working with academics, think 
tanks and specialist consultants  
to improve understanding and 
analysis of the benefits of biomass.
• Engaging with key ENGOs to 
discuss issues of contention.
• Forging closer relationships with 
suppliers on sustainability through 
the supplier relationship 
programme.
• Maintaining strong processes to 
ensure compliance with regulation.
• Increased engagement across all 
European Institutions (Commission, 
Parliament, Council), and relevant 
UK Government departments.
• Developing and maintaining strong 
relationships with policymakers. 
=
• BEIS commissioning a major 
new piece of work looking  
at our supply chains and 
counterfactuals.
• Implementation of our new 
forest biomass sourcing 
commitments.
• Legal case against EU has been 
brought by environmental NGO, 
fern, challenging the carbon 
neutrality of biomass.
• Established an Independent 
Advisory Board (IAB) of 
scientists, and leaders in the 
field of sustainability to provide 
impartial advice and guidance.
Plant operations
Context
The reliability of our operating plants is central to  
our ability to create value for the Group. Some of our 
plants are old, for example, Drax Power Station was built 
approximately fifty years ago and our hydro plants nearly 
one hundred years ago. The plants are highly complex 
and require careful management to operate, with  
many running flexibly to respond to the demands of the 
electricity system. For Drax Power Station specifically, 
the plant was originally constructed to generate 
electricity from coal, and we have converted four of  
the six units to use biomass, rather than the fuel for 
which they were originally designed.
Risk and impact
• As plant ages, the operational reliability and integrity 
could reduce. Single or multi point failures of plant 
across our portfolio, and incidents arising from the 
handling and combustion of biomass, could result  
in forced outages in our generation or pellet 
production plants.
• Successful generation using biomass requires 
stringent quality to be maintained throughout the 
supply chain, which continues to evolve and mature. 
Our suppliers may experience operational or financial 
difficulties which impair their ability to sustain 
continued compliance or result in inadequate 
standards being met. Poor quality could result in 
additional costs (as we may be required to source 
material from other suppliers) or inadequate volume  
of materials, leading to loss of generation which could 
adversely affect financial performance and results.
• Implementing a comprehensive 
plant investment and maintenance 
programme, that is risk-based and 
reflects the challenges of 
operating complex equipment, 
some of which is old, supported  
by engineering excellence.
• Ensuring plant is designed to 
prevent and control major hazards. 
• Maintaining robust management 
systems, designed to mitigate risk.
• Maintaining the stringent safety 
procedures in place for handling 
biomass and dust management.
• Managing the plant as a portfolio 
to ensure losses are minimised.
• Undertaking significant research 
and development on the production 
of wood pellets, as well as the 
handling and burning of biomass.
• Full testing of all biomass supplies 
prior to acceptance, and the use  
of contractual rights to reject out 
of specification cargoes.
• Sampling and analysis through  
the supply chain, to increase 
understanding of causes of fuel 
quality issues.
• Maintaining adequate insurance  
in place to cover losses from plant 
failure where possible.
=
• Completion of largest ever 
maintenance outage on Unit 2 
at Drax Power Station and 
installation of a new high-
pressure turbine unit.
• Hydro and thermal assets 
provide greater flexibility to  
the portfolio in the event of  
a plant failure.
• Major gas turbine outage  
and steam turbine overhaul

Trading and commodity 
Context
Sales of power and Renewable Obligation Certificates 
(ROCs) represented £2,099m of our revenue in 2019 in 
our Generation business and our Customers business 
made sales of £2,226m of electricity and gas. 
The margins derived from our Power Generation and 
Customers businesses are influenced by the liquidity of 
the commodity markets and our ability to secure desired 
prices in a volatile market. Non-commodity costs are also 
volatile and inherently difficult to hedge.
The value delivered from ROCs in 2019 was £528m. The 
value which we derive from ROCs may be lower than prior 
years, or our forecast, if demand increases for generation 
from alternative renewable sources at the expense of 
demand for generation from our own assets. 
Risk and impact
• Liquidity and volatility in trading conditions and 
unexpected changes in commodity prices could result  
in lower margins and a reduction in cash flow in our 
Generation business.
• The Generation business may fail to secure future 
system support services contracts which are a source  
of revenue diversity for the Group.
• Delivery of commercial value from the flexibility of our 
portfolio and leveraging a complicated supply chain with 
uncertain running regimes requires effective execution 
of our trading strategy and opportunities to trade being 
available in a liquid market.
• The value of ROCs generated may be lower than 
forecast, for example if the recycle value outturns are 
below our projections due to higher than anticipated 
renewable generation.
• Some new entrants to the electricity supply market 
have failed. Further supplier failures could lead to  
more supplier mutualisation processes (whereby  
their costs and commitments are shared among other 
suppliers) being invoked, notably for ROCs, resulting  
in increased costs.
• Falling power prices, rising coal/carbon prices or 
changes to regulation could mean that we do not  
use all our stocks of coal.
• Ensuring high levels of forward 
power sales for 2020/21 and the 
Contract for Difference (CfD) for 
one biomass generation unit could 
reduce our exposure to volatility.
• Additional value is provided 
through the increased flexibility 
and optimisation capabilities 
provided by the hydro and gas 
assets.
• Hedging energy supply commodity 
price exposures when fixed price 
sales are executed with third 
parties.
• Operating three biomass units 
under a single ROC cap for Drax 
Power Station provides increased 
opportunities for greater flexibility 
of generation.
• Purchasing wood pellets under 
long-term contracts with fixed 
pricing.
• Hedging fluctuations in ROC 
generation from wind farms 
through weather derivatives.
• Significant hedging of forward 
foreign exchange.
• The burn profile of the coal units 
has been adjusted to optimise  
coal stocks. 
=
• Sterling exchange rates against 
the US Dollar, Canadian Dollar 
and Euro remain weak.
• Power prices are lower with low 
market liquidity and increased 
volatility in short-term prices.
• Generation running regimes 
optimised with managed 
positions and scenario 
planning. 
• The Thermal plants have 
brought a natural hedge to 
falling gas prices.
• Prices for wood pellets 
decreased.
• Biomass production shortages 
and supply constraints caused 
primarily by adverse weather  
in the US in early 2019. 
Information systems and security 
Context
Our IT systems and data are essential to supporting the 
delivery of the day-to-day business operations of the 
Group and make sure our financial, legal, regulatory  
and compliance obligations are met. Our systems must 
also evolve in order to contribute to the delivery of our 
strategy. The systems need to be fit for purpose and the 
confidentiality, availability and integrity of the systems 
and data needs to be ensured. 
Risk and impact
• Absence of key IT systems transformation affecting 
our ability to deliver our strategy.
• Reduced performance or reduced availability of  
IT systems, data and facilities affecting our operations 
adversely. For example interrupting supply of 
electricity or impeding the accurate recording of 
electricity supplied to and used by our customers.
• Security compromise of our systems and data 
including personal data; causing operational and 
financial impact and regulatory non-compliance.
• Maintaining business continuity, 
disaster recovery and crisis 
management plans. 
• Maintaining cyber security 
measures, including a protect,

Climate Change
Context
According to the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate 
Change, global warming is likely to reach 1.5°C as early  
as 2030, causing changes in the climate system with 
associated impacts. It is important we assess the  
impact of climate change on our business and our 
preparedness to manage risks related to both the 
physical impacts of climate change and the transition  
to a low carbon economy.

• Physical impacts of climate change to our operations, 
for example increased incidence of extreme weather 
events. In early 2019 production at our US pellet 
production business was restricted following weather-
related events in the southern states of the US.
• Climate change policy, innovation and technology do 
not develop as expected impacting delivery of net zero 
ambition and our strategy.
• Reduced investor confidence, increased activity  
by protestors and challenges with staff recruitment 
and retention.
• Working with Energy UK on a 
framework to better manage the 
physical impacts of climate change 
on thermal generating facilities.
• Funding work at Strathclyde 
University to understand the 
potential changes in long-term 
weather patterns at Cruachan 
Dam. Results show that current 
predicted extremes are 
manageable.
• Physical impacts of climate change 
on new installations are covered 
under planning laws.
• Business strategy robust to future 
climate policy. 
• Investor confidence increased  
and reputational impacts mitigated 
by establishment of a net zero 
ambition, demonstrating a 
business strategy consistent  
with UK government climate 
change policy.
• Strong innovation team tracking 
technology advances.
This risk was not included in the 
previous annual report

Corporate Governance Report: 
Letter from the Chair
Dear shareholders
I am pleased to present our Corporate 
Governance Report for 2019. We believe 
that good governance is essential in 
creating and sustaining a high-performing 
business which delivers our strategy and 
creates sustainable long-term value for 
the benefit of our stakeholders. 
Maintaining the highest standards of 
corporate governance across the Group 
remains a top priority for the Board. 
We are now the fourth largest generator 
in the UK and the largest renewable 
power generator, with multiple generation 
sites using a variety of fuels. We are the 
largest supplier of business-to-business 
renewable power in the UK, and the 
fourth largest producer of wood pellets 
globally. We are also operating in a world 
that is more focused than ever before on 
the challenges of climate change.
We have a talented and engaged 
workforce, an executive team that has 
been strengthened during the year, and 
an experienced and supportive Board,  
all committed to helping Drax deliver  
its purpose of enabling a zero carbon, 
lower-cost energy future.
Fit for the future
Good governance requires sound 
decision-making taken on high quality, 
transparent information conveyed in a 
timely manner and which takes account 
of relevant stakeholders. In 2019 we 
continued to develop our governance 
structures to ensure that they support the 
enlarged business and the delivery of the 
 
Strong governance 
underpins our  
ability to deliver  
a sustainable  
and successful 
business.”

strategy. As part of this we successfully 
launched a new governance structure, 
including five new committees below the 
Executive Committee. This structure will 
ensure a better flow and evaluation of 
information, support timely decision-
making and clearer accountability, 
enabling us to realise our purpose and 
deliver our strategy. 
We also developed a new Remuneration 
Policy, to reflect the evolution of the 
business, which will be put to a 
shareholder vote at the 2020 AGM. Our 
new policy underpins our purpose, which 
links executive pay to sustainable Group 
performance aligning reward with 
delivering the strategy. Nicola Hodson, 
the Remuneration Committee Chair, led 
the engagement with shareholders on the 
proposed new Policy. You can read more 
about this on page 88.
Culture and governance
Our aim is to maintain an open and 
collaborative culture across the Group  
in which our people are respected and 
contribute fully. Setting the right 
standards helps to protect the business 
and the interests of our stakeholders. In 
assessing Group performance, the Board 
routinely considers culture, such as 
workforce engagement and reward, and 
how this underpins behaviours across  
the Group in addition to financial 
performance. We place particular 
emphasis on the safety of our people.  
The CEO updates the Board on safety  
at every meeting, including absolute 
measures such as injury rates as well as 
the prevailing safety culture and process 
safety around the business.
Board member engagement with 
different areas of the business provide 
directors with a deeper understanding  
of the culture of the organisation. In 2019, 
John Baxter visited 12 sites as part of his 
induction and David Nussbaum visited six 
newly acquired sites.
Stakeholder engagement
We have a well-established programme  
of engaging with a wide range of 
stakeholders, including shareholders, 
government, regulators, environmental 
bodies and trade unions. We know that 
actions taken today will shape the 
performance of Drax in the future and will 
determine our impact on the wider world, 
including our contribution to action on 
climate change. Such engagement 
broadens our understanding of the issues 
we take into account, informs our 
decision-making and helps to protect  
the long-term interests of stakeholders. 
In 2019 we conducted an investor audit  
to evaluate shareholder and investor 
perceptions of the Group’s strategy.  
This independent study by KPMG provided 
valuable feedback from investors, which 
was broadly supportive, on the Group’s 
strategy, management and approach to 
communications.
Our colleagues have a critical role to play 
in the success of our business. In 2019, 
the Board worked on the development  
of the MyVoice workforce engagement 
forums (see case study on page 28). My 
Board colleagues and I welcome this 
opportunity to work with the forums, to 
listen and understand, communicate the 
Board’s position on key issues and hear 
their views and proposals for Drax. Will 
Gardiner and I have begun to meet all the 
Chairs of the forums. We see this as an 
evolving, two-way conversation and will 
be closely monitoring progress in 2020, 
both to ensure that it delivers the right 
engagement and also to explore effective 
ways to engage. 
You can read more about our stakeholder 
engagement, and the factors we consider 
in decision-making, on pages 24 to 29. 
Board evaluation 
In 2019 we ran an externally facilitated 
evaluation for the Board to assess its 
effectiveness. We were pleased to note 
that the evaluation felt the Board 
exhibited good dynamics, an open and 
transparent culture with constructive 
challenge and debate, and an appropriate 
focus on the long term. More details of 
our evaluation, including areas for 
development, are set out on page 74. 
Succession planning and diversity 
We recognise the importance of diversity 
within the Group and we report on Board 
and Executive Committee composition 
and diversity on page 76. To build a more 
diverse and inclusive business, we set  
an ambitious target to increase female 
representation in senior leadership roles 
across the Group to 40% by the end of 
2020. We have not yet progressed as 
much as we would have liked and 
recognise the challenges associated  
with diversity in recruitment and career 
progression, particularly in the energy  
and engineering sectors. We do, however, 
remain determined to make Drax a great 
place to work for everyone at all stages  
of their career. In order to address these 
challenges, we have established a 
Diversity and Inclusion Working Group,  
led by Clare Harbord, a member of the 
Executive Committee, which is developing 
plans to support a more diverse talent 
pipeline. You can read more about this  
on pages 45 to 46.
We undertake regular reviews of our 
succession planning for senior 
management and the talent pipeline, 
making sure it is aligned to the Group’s 
strategy. During 2019 we strengthened 
the Executive Committee with the 
appointment of three new members,  
two of whom (Jason Shipstone and Paul 
Sheffield) were promotions from our 
talent pipeline.
Board changes
The Board consists of a strong team with 
a wide range of experience across various 
industries. The Nomination Committee 
regularly reviews composition, and during 
the year we continued to refresh our 
range of skills and experience. Andy 
Skelton joined as CFO in January 2019. 
Our three longest-serving Non-Executive 
Directors (David Lindsell, Tony Thorne  
and Tim Cobbold) retired from the Board 
as part of our planned succession. 
During 2018 and into 2019 Vanessa 
Simms worked closely with David Lindsell, 
while Nicola Hodson worked closely with 
Tony Thorne, as part of the managed 
transition of them taking over as Chairs of 
the Audit Committee and Remuneration 
Committee respectively in April 2019.
Finally, I am delighted to welcome  
John Baxter to the Board who joined as  
a Non-Executive Director in April 2019. 
John brings valuable operational 
experience and knowledge of the  
energy sector, particularly in safety  
and engineering, which will be of  
huge benefit to Drax.

Role of the Executive Committee
The Executive Committee focuses on the 
delivery of the Group’s strategy, financial 
structure, planning and performance, 
organisational development, and the 
delivery of change. This is enabled by 
engagement with the workforce, with other 
stakeholders, and by developing policies 
and procedures that provide an effective 
framework for operating in line with 
required standards, laws and regulations. 
The Executive Committee receives regular 
reports on business performance. The 
safety and wellbeing of our workforce is of 
primary importance. The opening agenda 
item for each meeting considers safety 
updates from executives responsible for 
our business units. Ethics and values is also 
a standing agenda item. The performance 
against the Business Plan is reviewed 
across financial and non-financial metrics. 
Each meeting reviews risks, focusing more 
closely on a specific principal risk at each 
meeting. Stakeholder engagement is 
considered, with particular focus on the 
political landscape which could impact 
Drax’s ability to execute its strategy. 
Examples during 2019 include the 
Capacity Market, the commitment to 
meeting zero carbon targets and 
investment in technologies to reduce 
carbon emissions. The Committee 
monitored business integration, following 
the acquisition of the hydro and gas 
generation assets. Papers are distributed 
ahead of meetings to brief Committee 
members on matters to be discussed. 
Members also receive presentations on 
various business issues by senior managers 
within the business units.
The Executive Committee has 11 scheduled 
meetings each calendar year and arranges 
additional meetings if needed.

members can be found on the website

Compliance with the UK Corporate Governance Code 
2018 (Code)
The new Code, which can be found on the Financial Reporting 
Council website at www.frc.org.uk, took effect from 1 January 
2019. During 2019 the Board conducted a full review of its 
governance practices and alignment with the new Code, 
including a review of appropriate actions to ensure that, by  
the end of 2019, the Company was able to confirm that it had 
applied the principles and provisions. It is the Board’s view that 
the Company had applied the principles and complied in full 
with the provisions of the Code by the end of 2019. Examples  
of actions undertaken during 2019 include the development  
of new workforce engagement forums and a new policy for 
post-employment shareholding requirements for Executive 
Directors. More details are contained below. 
Role of the Board
The Board determines: the Group’s purpose and strategy; 
appetite for risk; risk management policies; annual plan and key 
performance indicators; stakeholder engagement; acquisitions 
and disposals, and other transactions outside delegated limits; 
material changes to accounting policies or practices; significant 
financial decisions; capital structure and dividend policy; 
shareholder communications; prosecution, defence or 
settlement of material litigation; Directors’ Remuneration 
Policy; the terms of reference of Board committees; and the 
Board structure, composition and succession.
Terms of reference
The Board has a schedule of matters reserved for its decisions 
and formal terms of reference for its Committees. These are 
reviewed periodically and the terms of reference are available  
to view on the Group’s website at www.drax.com.
Matters which are not specifically reserved to the Board and its 
Committees under their terms of reference, or for shareholders 
in General Meeting, are delegated to the Executive Committee 
or otherwise delegated in accordance with a schedule of 
delegated authorities approved by the Board.
How the Board functions
Prior to each Board meeting the Chair and the Non-Executive 
Directors meet in private without management being present. 
This allows the Chair and Non-Executive Directors to exchange 
views and share any concerns before the meeting starts. At 
each Board meeting, the Group Chief Executive gives a report 
on key business, operational and safety matters and the Chief 
Financial Officer reports on the Group’s financial performance. 
The Board also receives regular reports on performance against 
the Business Plan, operational and financial performance, 
periodic business reports from senior management across the 
Group, and updates on investor relations and wider stakeholder 
engagement. The Board receives regular industry, regulatory 
and topical updates from internal specialists and from external 
experts and advisers. Papers are distributed in advance of 
Board and Committee meetings to allow adequate preparation.
The core activities of the Board and its Committees are 
documented and planned on a forward agenda, with a list of 
matters arising from each meeting maintained and followed up 
at subsequent meetings.
The Group Company Secretary advises the Board on 
governance matters, ensuring good information flows within 
the Board, its committees, the Executive Committee and senior 
management. The Group Company Secretary ensures that 
Board processes are complied with and is also responsible for 
assessing compliance with the Listing, Prospectus, Disclosure 
Guidance and Transparency Rules, the Corporate Governance 
Code and the Companies Act. An important part of this is 
effective collaboration with other parties across all Group 
functions, through good training, regular discussions on key 
issues, and support from those in areas of critical operational 
risk in evaluating areas for change.
All Board Committees are authorised to obtain legal or other 
professional advice as necessary, to secure the attendance of 
external advisers at their meetings and to seek information 
required from any member of the workforce of the Group in 
order to perform their duties.
The Company’s Articles of Association (the Articles), give the 
Directors power to authorise conflicts of interest when such 
matters are presented for their review. The Board has an 
effective procedure to identify potential conflicts of interest, 
consider them for authorisation and record them. The Articles 
also allow the Board to exercise voting rights in Group 
companies without restriction (for example to appoint a director 
to a Group company). The Articles are available on the Group’s 
website at www.drax.com.
Culture
The Board routinely monitors and assesses culture. Health and 
safety, as a standing Board agenda item, is one of the first items 
to be considered at each meeting and includes discussion on 
underlying safety culture. The Board considers workforce 
engagement, performance and reward as well as financial 
performance when it discusses progress of business units 
against plans.
The Group Ethics and Business Conduct Committee (EBCC), 
which is a sub-committee of the Executive Committee and 
meets quarterly, monitors and supports initiatives to improve 
ethical behaviour and practices. The EBCC supports the Group’s 
commitment to doing the right thing by ensuring that training  
is conducted that informs behaviours in accordance with the 
Drax values and ethical principles set out in the “Doing the right 
thing” handbook. The EBCC conducts an annual review and  
risk assessment of each compliance programme, which include 
Anti-Bribery and Corruption, privacy, and supply chain human 
rights. The EBCC reports quarterly to the Audit Committee on 
investigations and key matters, and annually on EBCC activities 
for the year. Members of the EBCC include two Executive 
Directors (the CFO, who is Chair of the EBCC, and the CEO 
Generation), and one Executive Committee member (Director  
Corporate governance report continued
Drax Group plc Annual report and accounts 2019
69
of Corporate Affairs), which informs understanding of business 
culture and attitudes, informing Board and Executive 
Committee discussions. Ethics and values is a standing agenda 
item for the Executive Committee, with the CFO responsible for 
raising such matters as Chair of the Group Ethics and Business 
Conduct Committee (EBCC). The Group Company Secretary  
is the Whistleblowing Officer. Updates on whistleblowing 
incidents are provided to the Executive Committee, Audit 
Committee and Board as appropriate, which during the 2019 
financial year included training for Directors. A number of 
whistleblowing related matters remained under investigation  
at the date of this report.
The Company ensures that employees receive appropriate 
communications and training on, and regularly reviews its suite 
of policies for key matters which underpin ethical behaviours, 
such as Corporate Crime (including Anti-Bribery and Corruption, 
Conflicts of Interest and Supply Chain Human Rights), Privacy, 
Fair Competition and Whistleblowing. More information on our 
approach to the management of ethics and integrity, can be 
found in the Sustainable Business section page 49.
Non-Executive Directors regularly visit company locations  
and meet with local management and the workforce to  
better understand operations and underlying culture. In 2019 
John Baxter visited 12 sites as part of his induction and David 
Nussbaum visited six of the newly acquired sites following  
the acquisition of hydro and gas generation assets in  
December 2018.
Our One Drax Awards, which were first introduced in December 
2018, reward employee behaviours and performance that 
reflect delivery of objectives and positive contribution to 
company values and culture.

Stakeholder engagement
Drax has a wide range of stakeholders and takes care to ensure 
that the Group and the Board, has an effective strategy to 
identify and engage with those stakeholders.
Supporting the Board’s duty to promote the success of the 
Company as set out in Section 172 of the Companies Act 2006, 
Board discussions include stakeholders likely to be affected by 
items under discussion and the potential impact. This ensures 
that the interests of all relevant stakeholders are considered  
in decision-making. For more detailed information on our 
stakeholders and how we engage with them please refer  
to our “Stakeholder” section on pages 24 to 29. 
Succession planning
Good succession planning contributes to the delivery of the 
Group’s strategy by ensuring the desired mix of skills and 
experience of Board members now and in the future. As noted 
on page 69, in 2019, our three longest serving Non-Executive 
Directors (David Lindsell, Tony Thorne and Tim Cobbold) 
stepped down at the end of their tenure. 
In line with existing succession plans, John Baxter was 
appointed as a Non-Executive Director in April 2019. Further 
details on John’s appointment and induction can be found  
in the Nomination Committee Report on pages 74 and 77.
Vanessa Simms, who is CFO at Grainger plc and joined Drax  
in June 2018, was appointed Chair of the Audit Committee in 
April 2019 after David Lindsell stepped down. Nicola Hodson, 
who joined Drax in January 2018, was appointed Chair of the 
Remuneration Committee in April 2019 after Tony Thorne 
stepped down as Chair (ahead of his stepping down as a director 
in June 2019). Nicola had served on the Committee for 15 
months before she became Chair. Each of Vanessa and Nicola 
had worked closely with, and been mentored by, their 
predecessors as part of a structured induction programme  
to help with a smooth transition into the respective roles. 
David Nussbaum succeeded David Lindsell as Senior 
Independent Director in April 2019.
Further details on wider succession planning can be found on 
page 76.
Directors’ development and induction
To assist the Board in undertaking its responsibilities, a 
programme of training and development is available to all 
Directors. Training needs are assessed as part of the Board 
evaluation procedure. The Board programme includes regular 
presentations from management and informal meetings to build 
understanding of the business and sector.
During the year, as well as Board meetings in London a meeting 
took place at the power station in Selby to give the Non-
Executive Directors the opportunity to develop a deeper 
understanding of, and insight into, the operations of the 
Generation business.
During the year, Directors had access to the advice and services 
of the Group Company Secretary. Directors may take 
independent advice at the Company’s expense when it is judged 
necessary in order to discharge their responsibilities effectively. 
No such independent advice was sought in 2019. 
All new Directors receive a comprehensive and tailored 
induction programme, including meetings with key managers, 
site visits, and briefings on key operational matters, Board 
procedures and governance matters.

Case study
The Board’s role in the refinancing of debt
In 2019, the Board considered options for refinancing  
the acquisition bridge facility, secured to support the 
acquisition of the hydro and gas generation assets in 
December 2018. The refinancing approach was 
considered before the acquisition. The key considerations 
were the credit rating of the Group; the impact to net 
leverage and ability to access credit; the strength and 
depth of liquidity sources, and the strength of Drax’s 
near-term earnings and cashflows; ensuring that any 
acquisition debt facility was structured to allow flexibility 
to refinance through 2019; assessment of existing and 
new routes to market ensuring a good breadth of options 
were considered.
In 2019, there were two tranches of refinancing. The first 
was a $200m US Bond, concluded in May 2019, and the 
second was for a total of £500m agreed in July 2019, 
£375m of which was an infrastructure private placement 
facility. Consistent with our continued strategic focus on 
reducing our carbon emissions, and demonstrating our 
commitments to wider stakeholders, the Board discussed 
and agreed that the remaining £125m should be 
refinanced by way of an Environmental, Social and 
Governance (ESG) loan facility. The ESG loan includes  
a mechanism that adjusts the margin based on Drax’s 
carbon emissions per GWh of electricity generated by 
fossil fuel combustion against an annual benchmark, 
rewarding or penalising our environmental performance 
in this area. 
The Board was updated in the spring 2019 with an 
indicative route to refinance the acquisition facility, 
exploring multiple routes to enable a more successful 
outcome. The CFO, Group Treasurer and legal and 
financing advisers briefed the Board, with the CFO 
providing monthly updates on the progress of refinancing, 
including any risks to execution. A working group 
comprising the CFO, Company Secretary, and senior 
managers from the Treasury, Legal, Investor Relations  
and IT teams, was created to oversee delivery of the plan, 
monitor and assess the adequacy of procedures under  
the Market Abuse Regulations.
For each tranche of refinancing, the Board was provided 
with a comprehensive briefing. Following review and 
approval of approach, the Board then delegated authority 
to a subcommittee to undertake the necessary steps to 
effect the refinancing. Throughout the process, advice 
was sought from financial and legal advisers, and if any 
substantive updates were received, this was fed back  
to the Board via the CFO.
Number of meetings held
The Board and its Committees have regular scheduled meetings 
and hold additional meetings as required. The Board has eight 
scheduled meetings each year, with the Board meeting at  
least annually to specifically consider strategy. Directors are 
expected, where possible, to attend all Board meetings, relevant 
Committee meetings, the Annual General Meeting (AGM) and 
any other General Meetings.
Board roles
The key responsibilities of members of the Board are as follows:
Position
Role
Chair
Responsible for leading and managing the 
Board, its effectiveness, and governance. 
Ensures Board members are aware of and

stakeholders. Helps to set the tone from  
the top in terms of the purpose, goal, vision 
and values for the whole organisation.

of the business, developing the Group’s 
strategic direction for consideration and 
approval by the Board and implementing  
the agreed strategy.
Chief Financial

Time commitment
Directors’ commitments outside of Drax are kept under review 
to ensure that they have sufficient time to dedicate to the 
business and effectively perform their role. Under the terms  
of his letter of appointment, the Chair is expected to commit 
between 50 and 70 full days a year to this role. Under the 
Non-Executive Directors’ letters of appointment, each is 
expected to commit 12 to 15 full days a year. That includes 
attendance at Board meetings, the AGM, one annual Board 
strategy off-site event and at least one site visit per year. 
In addition, they are expected to devote appropriate preparation 
time ahead of each meeting. The time commitment expected  
in respect of their membership of the Audit, Nomination and 
Remuneration Committees is an additional three to four full days 
a year in each case. However, in practice considerably more time 
is devoted, particularly by the Chairs of the Committees. 
Non-Executive Directors are encouraged to undertake visits  
to Drax operations, and spend time with management and  
the workforce, to maintain their knowledge of the developing 
business and to understand the operational challenges.
Between 22 January 2019 and 15 April 2019, Philip Cox took on 
the role of Executive Chair at Kier Group plc (“Kier”), on an 
interim basis, during the search for a new CEO at Kier. The Board 
had considered and approved in advance his taking on of this 
additional interim commitment. During this interim period he 
continued to devote the appropriate time to his role as Chair  
of the Board. In September 2019, Philip Cox announced his 
intention to step down as Chair and director of Kier once a 
successor had been appointed, and on 1 January 2020, he  
duly stood down as Chair and director.
In April 2019 Nicola Hodson was appointed as a Non-Executive 
Director of Beazley plc. The Board considered and approved  
in advance her taking on this additional commitment.
Board composition and independence
The Board has reviewed the independence of each Non-
Executive Director. None of the Non-Executive Directors  
who served during the year had any material business or  
other relationship with the Group, and there were no other 
matters that were likely to affect their independence of 
character and judgement. The Board recognises that in view  
of the characteristics of independence set out in the Code, 
length of service is an important factor when considering  
the independence of Non-Executive Directors and that 
directors who have served more than nine years may not  
be considered independent. 
As notified in the 2018 Corporate Governance Report, Tony 
Thorne and Tim Cobbold stepped down as directors during 
2019, after each served nine years and David Lindsell stepped 
down as a director after serving 10 years (having served an 
additional year in order to manage the orderly transition for  
a new CFO and a new Audit Committee Chair).
The Board considers all the Non-Executive Directors to be 
independent.

Introduction
I am pleased to present the Nomination Committee Report  
for the year ended 31 December 2019.
2019 saw significant change for our Board as three experienced 
Non-Executive Directors stood down each having served on  
the Board for nine years or more. As reported in the 2018 annual 
report, in preparation for these retirements, the Nomination 
Committee conducted reviews which culminated in the 
appointment to the Drax Board of two new Non-Executive 
Directors, Nicola Hodson (appointed in January 2018) and 
Vanessa Simms (appointed in June 2018). On the conclusion  
of the 2019 AGM, Nicola assumed the role as Chair of the 
Remuneration Committee and Vanessa assumed the role  
of Chair of the Audit Committee, following a period of time  
in which the outgoing Chairs supported a managed handover.
As Chair of the Nomination Committee, I am responsible  
for overseeing the progress made to improve diversity in 
appointments to the Board and to support an effective

succession plan for senior management that is consistent  
with the long-term strategy of the Group. The Committee will 
continue to monitor the balance of the Board to ensure 
sufficient breadth and depth of expertise is available from the 
existing members and will recommend further appointments  
to the Board as appropriate. The Committee also takes an active 
interest in the quality and development of talent and capabilities 
below Board level, ensuring that appropriate opportunities are  
in place to develop high-performing individuals and to build 
diversity in senior roles across the business. 
Selection of new Non-Executive Director – process
The Committee follows an established and formal process 
which considers the skills, knowledge, diversity and experience 
that support the Company in delivering its strategic goals.  
This includes seeking to provide the Board with an appropriate 
balance and mix of skills required for now and in the future. 
In 2019 we were delighted to announce the appointment to  
the Board of John Baxter, CBE. 
During our search for a new Non-Executive Director, the 
Committee initiated and oversaw a rigorous recruitment 
process. It appointed Egon Zehnder to ensure a comprehensive 
search of the market. Egon Zehnder is signed up to the 
Hampton Alexander voluntary code of conduct on gender 
diversity and, aside from assisting with recruitment, has no 
connection with the Group or individual directors. Egon Zehnder 
did not provide any services to the Board in 2018. 
Reflecting our commitment to gender diversity, the candidate 
selection process initially focused on potential female 
candidates. Due consideration was given to a range of 
capabilities that the Committee felt was required for our Board. 
These included technical and engineering experience, sector 
specific knowledge relevant to our Group, experience of 
operating multinationally and the candidates’ existing time 
commitments. In considering time commitments, particular 
consideration was given to prevailing listed company 
directorships with regard to the need to avoid “over-boarding”. 
Following a balanced assessment of these factors and the 
outcome of interviews, the Committee decided to proceed  
with a further search.
The search culminated in the appointment of John Baxter.  
John is a Chartered Engineer and Fellow of both the Royal 
Academy of Engineering and the Royal Society of Edinburgh, 
with experience in running multinational operations, including 
in businesses undergoing significant change. John’s skills, 
combined with his interests in operational excellence, safety 
and people from working in generation and the energy sector 
are a valuable addition to our Board. John’s biography is set out 
on page 65.
Non-Executive Directors: terms of appointment
Under the Board’s policy, each Non-Executive Director will be 
appointed for an initial term of three years. The term can be 
renewed by mutual agreement if the Board is satisfied with the 
director’s performance and commitment and a resolution to 
re-elect at the appropriate AGM is successful. The Board will 
not normally extend the aggregate period of service of any 
independent Non-Executive Director beyond nine years and  
will rigorously review any proposal to extend a Non-Executive 
Director’s aggregate period of office beyond six years.
Board and Committee evaluation
The Board recognises that it needs to regularly monitor 
performance. This is achieved through the annual performance 
evaluation, full induction of new Board members and ongoing 
Board development activities. 
For 2019 it was determined that an external Board performance 
evaluation would be conducted, in line with the Code 
requirement to hold an externally facilitated evaluation at least 
every three years. Board Alchemy was chosen to facilitate and 
conduct the evaluation. Board Alchemy does not have any  
other connection with the Group or individual Directors. In 
conducting the evaluation, Board Alchemy interviewed all 
Directors during the Autumn of 2019, including former Director 
Tim Cobbold. Ahead of this, each of the Directors completed  
a detailed questionnaire providing information about how  
they viewed the role of the Board and how it functions. 
As part of the evaluation, Board Alchemy also met with the 
Group Company Secretary and members of the Executive 
Committee. Board Alchemy also observed the September Board 
meeting, including the agenda discussion without Executive 
Directors, and reviewed recent Board papers to assess the 
quality of Board information. As the Chairs of the Audit 
Committee and Remuneration Committee were relatively new 
in post, the primary focus was on the Board and the Committees 
were not evaluated in detail. A formal, externally-led, review  
of the Committees of the Board will be undertaken in 2020.
The evaluation concluded that the relevant key skills were 
represented on the Board; the Chair showed good leadership 
and invested the necessary time; there were good dynamics 
and an open and transparent Board culture, with Non-Executive 
Directors challenging constructively and Executive Directors 
responding without defensiveness; the Board maintained an 
appropriate focus on the long term.
Recommendations for the future included a focus on improving 
the quality of Board papers; regularising the programme of 
Board development, with deep dives on specific subjects 
(including bringing in external expert perspectives to the 
sessions), maintaining focus on understanding stakeholder 
perspectives and considering how the Board can engage more 
deeply on safety, engineering and technology governance 
enabling the significant expansion in Drax activities in the  
next decade. Actions already taken include a presentation to 
the Board on cyber risks by the National Cyber Security Centre 
in November 2019 and rolling out guidance on producing more 
focused board papers that also include identification of 
stakeholders who may be affected by any major decisions. 
A review of my performance as Chair was facilitated by the 
Senior Independent Director, incorporating input from Board 
Alchemy, with feedback provided to me. A discussion of the 
Board evaluation was held at the November Board meeting  
and I have followed up with individual Directors.

Succession planning and diversity
The Board recognises that effective succession planning is  
key to the Company’s ability to achieve its strategic objectives. 
It is also integral to maintaining an effective Board. Selecting 
and supporting the right individuals is an essential role of the 
Committee. For example, during 2019 two appointments to  
the Executive Committee (Jason Shipstone and Paul Sheffield) 
were promotions from our talent pipeline.
Each year the Committee reviews the Group’s succession plan, 
identifying those colleagues who have the potential to step into 
leadership roles across a timeframe of one to five years. The 
review focuses on various aspects, such as technical skills and 
experience and also behaviours and attitudes, to ensure that  
the business has the right leaders in place to deliver our purpose 
and strategy in a collaborative and transparent way.
In our 2018 annual report, we outlined our desire that by the end 
of 2020, the Group would have 40% of senior leadership roles 
held by women. This reflects our belief that all organisations 
should be prepared to set stretching targets, but transparency 
is also important and our progress to date is not yet sufficient to 
achieve the ambition we set ourselves. This is disappointing, but 
we remain committed to making Drax an inclusive place to work 
which respects, values and supports individual difference, at all 
levels of the business. 
We report on page 45 on our wider work in the organisation 
which is focused on realising these changes. Part of this has  
to be driven by not only the recruitment processes but also 
support for programmes which encourage women to pursue 
careers and qualifications that fit with the opportunities which 
Drax offers. Support from companies such as Drax through 
apprenticeship schemes, training programmes, experience days 
where young people are given the chance to learn about what 
we do and the exciting roles they can take on is important. 
Creating such interest through engagement in the wider 
community must play a part in this, as well as listening to young 
people from diverse backgrounds about what would encourage 
them to join a business such as Drax. Such work is a longer-term 
endeavour, but we consider Drax has a role to play.
The Board also embraces diversity in its broadest sense, 
believing that a wide range of experience, background, 
perspective, skills and knowledge is the foundation of a high 
performing and effective team. As part of our commitment  
to this, the Board’s Diversity Policy was reviewed and updated 
by the Committee and subsequently approved by the Board  
in February 2019. The review included aspects of new and 
emerging best practice and regulatory developments in the 
area of senior management and Board diversity. The policy now 
covers race, gender, disability, educational and professional 
background. 
Skills and knowledge of the Board
A key responsibility of the Committee is to ensure that the 
Board maintains a balance of skills, knowledge and experience 
appropriate to the long-term operation of the business and 
delivery of the strategy. As in past years, the Nomination 
Committee has reviewed the composition of the Board and  
as part of this review the Committee considered whether the:
• Board contains the right mix of skills, experience and diversity
• Board has an appropriate balance of Executive Directors and 
Non-Executive Directors
• Non-Executive Directors are able to commit sufficient time  
to the Company to discharge their responsibilities effectively
Following the review, the Committee was satisfied that the 
Board continues to have an appropriate mix of skills and 
experience, both now and for the future, to operate effectively. 
All the Directors have many years of experience, gained from a 
broad range of businesses and they collectively bring a range of 
expertise and knowledge of different business sectors to Board 
deliberations, which encourages constructive, challenging and 
innovative discussions.

Induction of new Directors
All new Directors receive a comprehensive, tailored, induction. 
During the year, John Baxter was appointed as a Non-Executive 
Director. As part of his induction, John Baxter visited 12 Drax 
sites, including a four-day trip to the US where he visited the 
port facility at Baton Rouge, and the pellet sites at LaSalle, 
Amite and Morehouse, meeting with local management and 
discussing a range of matters, in particular health and safety 
and plant management. John reported to the CEO and Chair 
after each visit and also provided a reflection on his visits to  
a meeting of the Board held in November 2019.
Renewal and re-election
If the Board appoints a Director, that Director must retire at the 
first AGM following their appointment. That Director may, if they 
so wish, put themselves forward for election. John Baxter was 
appointed by the Board after the 2019 AGM and therefore will 
retire and offer himself for election by shareholders at the 
forthcoming AGM.
The Articles provide that one-third of directors shall retire by 
rotation each year and are eligible for re-election by 
shareholders at the AGM. In accordance with the Code, the 
Company will continue its practice to propose all directors for 
annual re-election. Accordingly, Philip Cox, Will Gardiner, Nicola 
Hodson, Andy Koss, David Nussbaum, Andy Skelton and 
Vanessa Simms will all retire at the forthcoming AGM and, being 
eligible, will offer themselves up for re-election. 
Following the evaluation and review of the Board described 
above, I concluded that the Directors offering themselves for 
election and re-election continue to demonstrate commitment, 
management and business expertise in their particular role and 
continue to perform effectively. The election and re-election 
respectively of each director is recommended by the Board. 
Further information of the service contracts for the Executive 
Directors and letters of appointment for the Non-Executive 
Directors are set out in a table on page 111.
The Executive Directors’ service contracts and Non-Executive 
Directors’ letters of appointment are available for inspection  
by prior arrangement during normal business hours at the 
Company’s registered office. They will also be available for 
inspection at the venue of the AGM, prior to that meeting, 
details of which are contained in the Notice of Meeting.
During the year, I held regular meetings with the Non-Executive 
Directors in the absence of the Executive Directors, and, 
separately, the Senior Independent Director held a meeting  
with the Non-Executive Directors without me being present,  
as required by provision 12 of the Code.
This report was reviewed and approved by the Nomination 
Committee.

The Committee allows time at each meeting to speak in the 
absence of management with each of the external auditor and 
the Head of Group Risk and Internal Audit. The Committee’s 
understanding with both the external and internal auditor is 
that, if they should at any time become aware of any matters 
giving them material concern, they should promptly draw it  
to the Committee’s attention via the Chair of the Committee.  
No such issues were raised in 2019.
The Committee identified areas where it would be helpful  
to allow additional time to discuss matters considered by the 
Committee members. During 2019, following a recommendation 
by the Committee, an additional meeting was held, attended  
by all members of the Board to discuss the Group Treasury 
activities to coincide with the review of the refinancing of  
the acquisition bridge facility.

Reviewing the effectiveness of the system  
of risk management and internal controls
The Committee received updates on the Group’s internal control 
environment and reviewed internal audit reports at each of  
the four meetings held during 2019. In addition, the Committee 
received updates on the financial risks and financial controls 
from each of the Group’s primary business units. During 2019, 
management from Drax Power (the Generation business), Haven 
Power, Opus Energy (jointly the Customers business) and Drax 
Biomass (the Pellet Production business) attended Committee 
meetings to report on areas of their responsibility and to allow 
the Committee an opportunity to consider and comment on 
prevailing issues and priorities. One example of a topic 
considered when discussing the Customer business unit was 
actions being taken to strengthen payroll systems and 
associated reporting through integration into a common IT 
platform (including associated procedures and staff training). 
The work on this project was completed in Q1 of 2020. The 
Committee also received regular updates and reports on the 
integration of the newly acquired generation assets into the 
Drax Power financial systems. Matters considered as part of  
that discussion was the degree to which financial and business 
systems have been fully integrated into common platforms and 
the progress in terminating (to schedule) of transitional service 
arrangements which had been entered into with the previous 
owner of the acquired assets. The Committee was also 
appraised of and considered how as a result of the acquisition, 
the increase in the asset base and the associated differing 
economics has added complexity to the monitoring of 
Impairment and Useful Economic Lives, and how management 
had responded to this matter.
The various updates, reviews and reports allowed both control 
and audit issues to be discussed directly with management.  
Risk mitigations and progress with previously agreed actions 
were also monitored and progress discussed. 
Areas for improvement identified from an internal audit of cyber 
security operational controls and mentioned in the 2018 annual 
report were addressed during 2019. It was recognised that the 
nature of cyber-related threats continues to evolve. The Board  
as a whole received a presentation on cyber risks from senior 
representatives of the National Cyber Security Centre in 
November 2019.
No material issues have arisen with the operation of controls  
in individual business units, but internal audits of Procurement 
and Health and Safety undertaken in 2019 identified that 
Group-wide controls should be enhanced to ensure consistency 
across the expanded Group. Management are taking action to 
put in place Group-wide policies and control frameworks and 
bring together operational support and review mechanisms 
which should be established in H1 2020. A new Group-wide 
online safety incident management system has been rolled  
out with associated mandatory training in conjunction with a 
“champions” network and a colleague engagement campaign.  
In addition, during 2019 a new incident reporting tool was 
adopted to enhance the reporting and analysis of incidents.
The Committee reviewed the categories used to report to 
shareholders and other stakeholders the Principal Risks and 
Uncertainties explained in the report (see pages 54 to 61).  
The review included discussion of retaining a disclosure 
associated with ongoing uncertainty from Brexit as well as  
the extent to which the newly acquired generation assets had  
a material bearing on the explanation of risks affecting the 
Group as a whole. The Transaction Risk included in the 2018 
annual report associated with the acquisition of the hydro and 
gas generation assets has been removed. The Committee agreed 
that a new category of Climate Change risks should be included 
to reflect new emerging challenges on disclosure of climate-
related risks. The explanation of the principal risks also reflects 
the review by the Committee and separate evaluations by the 
Executive Committee, supported by a presentation by the  
Head of Group Risk and Internal Audit. 
The Committee also reviews information arising from 
Whistleblowing reports as appropriate to the circumstances  
and matters under review. The Committee considers the scope 
of investigation and the appropriateness of the steps being 
taken. The Board also is updated on the reviews.
Reviewing the 2019 Annual Report and Accounts
At its meeting held in November 2019, the Committee received 
reports from management on its planning for the various 
elements of the 2019 annual report, including a timetable  
for preparation of drafts and the contributions being made  
by members of the wider management and executive teams  
in drafting, peer review and comment on the sections. That 
meeting also discussed how such review would support 
ensuring the annual report was fair, balanced and 
understandable. In addition, at the same meeting the Committee 
reviewed a reclassification of the Group’s US Dollar fixed asset 
translation balances and approved the approach and disclosure 
proposed by management.
Between the year-end date and the date of the approval of  
the Annual Report and Accounts, the Committee met on 24 
February 2020 principally to review the draft 2019 Annual report 
and accounts and the external auditor’s findings. The Committee 
reviewed papers prepared by management on accounting issues 
and judgements affecting the accounts and a report from 
Deloitte LLP (“Deloitte“) setting out their audit findings.
Also reviewed were internal controls, forecasts and relevant 
assumptions made in preparing the Viability Statement, and 
considering the appropriateness of adopting the going concern 
basis in preparing the financial statements. Having challenged 
the assumptions around availability of finance and covenant 
compliance made in the process and considered the 
appropriateness of the three-year period of assessment,  
the Committee concluded that the Viability Statement  
disclosed on page 52 was robust and that the Statement  
was fair and balanced. 
The Committee considered and reviewed management’s 
disclosure on exceptional items and the adjustments which were 
taken through the middle column on the presentation of the 
three-column income statement, (which can be found on page 133 
referring where necessary to the agreed accounting policy).

Committee activities in 2019
The Committee follows a programme of work designed to 
ensure that sound risk management processes, a robust system 
of internal control and fair and balanced performance reporting 
are in place.
The Committee undertakes its duties reflecting an annual work 
plan, which is agreed each November for the following calendar 
year. In addition, where appropriate to activities in the Group or 
to reflect changes in applicable regulations, additional agenda 
items are incorporated to ensure members of the Committee 
have the opportunity to consider and contribute to an analysis 
of material issues. One such example was review during the 
year of how the Group should respond to IFRS 16 (Leasing).  
A rolling 12-month plan is also reviewed at each meeting, 
ensuring appropriate and timely consideration is given to 
relevant subjects as and when they arise. The main areas of 
work undertaken by the Committee during 2019 at its routinely 
scheduled meetings are set out in the table on page 79.
Explanations of the critical accounting judgements, estimates 
and assumptions are set out in detail throughout the notes to 
the consolidated financial statements, with a summary on page 
129. The Committee reviewed these aspects of the financial 
statements, paying particular attention to those issues that 
involved the most subjective and complex judgements, namely 
impairment of fixed assets, valuation of derivative financial 
instruments and accuracy of unbilled revenue, which are 
discussed on page 82. 
Fair, balanced and understandable
As a result of its review of the annual report and accounts, 
underpinned by its discussions with operating and finance 
management regarding the strategic report, and with the Group 
finance team regarding the financial statements, the Committee 
advised the Board that, in the Committee’s view, the Annual 
Report and Accounts, taken as a whole, is fair, balanced and 
understandable and provides the information necessary for 
shareholders to assess the Company’s position and performance, 
business model and strategy.
External auditor effectiveness
The Committee reviewed the effectiveness of the external 
auditor in February 2019 and does so annually. Deloitte LLP 
(Deloitte), who have performed the role of external auditor 
continuously since the Company’s listing in 2005, were 
reappointed in 2017 following a competitive tender process.  
On finalisation of the audit in respect of the 2018 Group annual 
report and financial statements, James Leigh had completed  
his five-year term as audit partner. He was replaced by Anthony 
Matthews who has significant listed company auditing 
experience working within the energy and resource sector  
and had previously led the Group’s Customer business audit. 
The Committee’s review primarily considered the independence 
and objectivity of Deloitte, their professional competence, past 
performance and the robustness of the audit process.  
The full assessment in 2019 by the Committee considered 
feedback from members of the Finance and wider management 
team. Views were sought on such matters as the quality of work 
and engagement in the course of planning and undertaking 
their audits and reviews at both Group and Subsidiary level.  
The Committee also assessed the oversight of the financial 
reporting process, in particular the Committee’s own 
discussions with the auditors of the audit work performed  
on areas of higher audit risk and the basis for the auditor’s 
conclusions on those areas, as well as the depth of the auditor’s 
understanding of the company’s business. 
In addition, this year the Committee included a detailed review 
and consideration of the report issued by the FRC’s Audit 
Quality Review (AQR) team regarding Deloitte’s audit of the 
Group’s 2018 financial statements as set out below.
The final AQR report and findings was received on 31 January 
2020 by the Chair and the full Committee has considered in 
detail the findings of the FRC’s review. In advance of the Audit 
Committee meeting held in February 2020 the Chair and Audit 
Partner discussed the findings and in addition the Chair met 
with the Acting Director of the FRC responsible for the AQR 
report. A further discussion on the full report was led by the 
Chair with all members of the Committee as part of the agenda 
at the meeting held on 24 February 2020. 
The Committee noted three areas recommended for 
improvement in relation to the work performed on testing the 
rebasing of certain financial instruments, the documentation  
of the acceptable range applying to the valuation of power 
contracts and the estimation of unbilled revenue in one of the 
components. A fourth area related to the work completed on the 
purchase price valuation disclosed appropriately as provisional 
in 2018 and finalised in the 2019 financial statements.
Having discussed the report the Committee noted Deloitte’s 
confirmation of improvements to the work completed in the 
2019 audit in these areas. The Committee also requested 
Deloitte ensure the responses to the FRC’s findings are 
evidenced in all future audits when relevant. The Committee 
noted that no adjustments to the financial statements were 
required as a result of this review. 
Having considered the results of the review, the actions taken, 
and improvements made by Deloitte to address the areas 
identified, the Committee concluded that there were no matters 
which cast doubt on the fundamental quality of the audit. 
Based on its overall review of effectiveness of the external  
audit and auditor discussions, feedback from management, 
interactions and satisfactory consideration and response  
to the FRC’s AQR, the Committee concluded it was satisfied  
that the external auditor and audit was effective and agreed  
that their work demonstrated an ongoing commitment to  
audit quality. The Committee was satisfied the audit process 
was robust and Deloitte had shown strong levels of technical 
knowledge and provided appropriate professional scepticism.

The significant issues in relation to the financial statements were as follows:
Matter
Issue and key judgements
Factors considered and conclusions reached
Valuation of derivative 
financial instruments
The Group makes extensive use of derivative 
financial instruments in order to manage key 
risks facing the business. The balance sheet 
includes significant assets and liabilities arising 
from derivatives which are stated at their fair 
value. In particular the asset values of forward 
foreign currency purchase contracts reduced 
substantially in the financial period following  
the recovery of Sterling against US Dollar, which 
was partially offset by an increase in the value  
of forward power sales contracts as a result  
of falling power prices.
The fair values for derivative financial 
instruments are determined using forward price 
curves and where an instrument incorporates an 
element of optionality, an option pricing model.
The inputs to these calculations include 
assumptions regarding future transactions and 
market movements, as well as credit risk, and are 
therefore subjective.
The Committee reviewed the Group’s derivative 
position in February, July and November 2019,  
having regard in particular to the critical judgemental 
areas described in note 7.2 to the financial 
statements. The Committee considered the position 
as at 31 December 2019 at its meeting on 24 
February 2020.
At each meeting, management provides updates 
on movements in market prices that underpin 
changes in the fair value of the derivative portfolio 
and highlight the treatment applied to any new 
types of derivative instrument for the Committee’s 
consideration.
The Committee has concluded that the fair value 
calculations had been performed in a reasonable 
and consistent manner, that the disclosure in the 
financial statements was appropriate and overall 
the key controls underlying the calculations were  
fit for purpose. 
Impairment of fixed 
assets
The Group reviews its fixed assets (or, where 
appropriate, groups of assets in CGU’s) for the 
purpose of impairment. Impairment reviews are 
conducted on an ongoing basis and are triggered 
by the existence of potential indicators of 
impairment or, in the case of goodwill and other 
intangible assets with indefinite useful lives, 
conducted at least annually.
The Customers and Pellet Production businesses 
generate independent cash flows to be 
equivalent to the operating entities within those 
businesses resulting in three CGU’s for Haven 
Power, Opus Energy and Drax Biomass. The 
Generation business considers its assets that 
generate independent cash flows to be the eight 
individual sites that share common infrastructure 
and control functions. The Group’s four OCGT 
development assets are treated as a single CGU 
for impairment purposes. 
If an indication of potential impairment exists, 
the recoverable amount of the asset or CGU is 
assessed with reference to the present value 
of the future cash flows expected to be derived 
from its value in use or its expected fair value.
Assumptions that underpin the assessment of 
value in use for each CGU are based on the most 
recent approved business plan, and includes all  
of the necessary costs expected to be incurred to 
generate the cash inflows from the CGU’s assets 
in their current state and condition.
Impairment reviews rely on assumptions and 
management key judgements regarding future 
market prices, cashflow forecasts, discount rates 
and the use of appropriate sensitivities.
The Committee reviewed management’s 
assessment of CGU’s, the process undertaken 
to analyse for any indicators of impairment, key 
assumptions used in all impairment reviews and 
the sensitivity analysis applied. In particular, at 
its meeting on 24 February 2020, the Committee 
considered in detail managements impairment 
review of the OCGT development assets, the 
defining of the CGU’s and the disclosure made in the 
financial statements around the sensitivity analysis. 
The Committee concluded that key assumptions 
and judgements made were reasonable and 
consistent. It was concluded that based on the 
review performed no impairment charges were 
required as at 31 December 2019; however key 
sensitivities in respect of the OCGT development 
assets were appropriately disclosed.

Matter
Issue and key judgements
Factors considered and conclusions reached
Accuracy of unbilled 
Customers revenue
Revenue from electricity and gas supplied 
to customers between the date of the last 
meter reading and the financial year end is 
based on estimates in relation to the volume 
of energy consumed and the valuation of that 
consumption.
The Committee reviewed with management the 
process for and assumptions applied in determining 
the calculation of unbilled receivables, noting 
that historically, financial settlements had been 
closely in line with the amounts accrued in the 
consolidated financial statements.
The Committee also reviewed the approach for 
calculating the expected credit losses associated 
with Customers sales, as described in more detail  
in note 3.6 to the financial statements. It was noted 
that management proposed a change from a fixed 
percentage allowance based on historic experience 
of collection rates to a Systems of Intelligence (SOI) 
machine learning algorithm which has been tested 
on live historic data and over time will become 
consistently more accurate at predicting default 
rates on aged debts.
The Committee reviewed with management the key 
assumptions applied in determining the calculation 
of unbilled receivables noting the reliance of third 
party data for estimates and actual usage volumes 
from meter readings and the external auditors 
testing assurance that confirmed the models work 
appropriately while noting recommendations for 
increased oversight at Opus on unbilled electric  
and gas models.
The Committee concluded that the change in 
calculating credit losses going forward using SOI 
methodology was more appropriate and relevant and 
that disclosure in the financial statements detailing 
the changes had been updated appropriately.

Independence of the external audit
The Group has an Auditor Independence Policy (“AIP”) which 
defines procedures and guidance under which the Company’s 
relationship with its external auditor will be governed, and forms 
part of the means by which the Committee is able to satisfy 
itself that there are no factors which may, or may be seen to, 
impinge upon the independence, objectivity and effectiveness 
of the audit process. The AIP was reviewed by the Committee  
in July 2019. Within its most recent review the Committee 
considered areas of development in practice and guidance in 
the factors which the Committee should consider in evaluating 
the key tenets of independence, objectivity and effectiveness. 
The main features of the AIP are: 
• review the quality and cost effectiveness of the audit and  
the independence and objectivity of the external auditor
• a requirement to rotate the lead audit partner every five 
years, and processes governing the employment of former 
external auditor employees
• a policy governing the engagement of the auditor to conduct 
non-audit work, under which the general principle will be that 
no non-audit services are undertaken by the incumbent audit 
firm, unless the work to be allocated requires a certificate or 
other assurance of the Company’s appointed auditor, the 
services provided relate to interim review and the reporting 
accountant activity or exceptional circumstances warrant it, 
and only then where the Committee is satisfied the 
engagement of the audit firm is justified on merits which  
are clearly articulated by management and agreed in advance 
by the Committee.
The balance between the fees paid to the external auditor  
for audit and non-audit work is monitored by the Committee.
The AIP is available on the Company’s website: www.drax.com.
The Committee also receives reports from the external auditor 
on its own processes and procedures, to ensure its 
independence and objectivity and to ensure compliance with 
the relevant standards.
Details of the amounts paid to the external auditor during the 
year for audit and other services are set out below and in note 
2.3 to the consolidated financial statements on page 143.

Certain non-audit services were performed by Deloitte during 
the year. The external auditors should not provide non-audit 
services where it might impair their independence or objectivity 
to do so. To ensure this principle is followed, the engagement  
for the provision of any non-audit services requires prior 
approval from the Committee Chair or Committee. Agreement to 
allow the audit firm to perform additional services is taken after 
considering that the non-audit services policy has been fully 
applied and that any engagements were in the best interests  
of the Group and its key stakeholders. During the year there was 
a decrease in the level of non-audit services provided by Deloitte 
which in total amounted to £278,000 of which £96,000 covered 
the Group’s Interim review. The Committee was satisfied that 
the overall levels of audit and non-audit fees were not of a 
material level relative to the income of Deloitte as a whole. 
Auditor reappointment
The Group has fully complied with the provisions of The 
Statutory Audit Services for Large Companies Market 
Investigation (Mandatory Use of Competitive Tender Processes 
and Committee Responsibilities) Order 2014.
The Committee recommended to the Board that a resolution  
to reappoint Deloitte as the Company’s external auditor should 
be put to shareholders at the AGM in April 2020 following 
discussions at its meeting held on 24 February 2020.

Review of Committee effectiveness by members
In line with the FRC’s Guidance on Committees, the Committee 
periodically reviews its own effectiveness. The scope of the 
externally facilitated review of the performance of the Board 
performed in 2019 was tailored mindful of the changes to the 
composition of the Board and the fact that during 2019 new 
Chairs respectively of the Committee and the Remuneration 
Committee commenced in role in spring 2019. Accordingly,  
the Board determined at its discussion in February 2019 that  
the scope would be specific to the performance of the Board, 
with a more detailed formal evaluation of the Committees to  
be deferred into a subsequent period.
Notwithstanding this decision, a review of the performance  
of each member of the Board in their respective roles was 
undertaken, led by the Chair. The outcome of that review was 
that each member of the Board was performing satisfactorily.
Internal audit
The Group operates a co-sourced model for its internal audit 
function. Under this model, the internal team conducts core 
financial and operational controls reviews. Reviews of specialist 
technical areas, including controls over regulatory compliance, 
are outsourced to firms with appropriate experience and 
qualifications, primarily KPMG, following consultation with  
the Committee.
The Committee reviews and approves the internal audit plan  
for the year. Its review is designed to ensure that priority is given 
to the areas of highest risk for the Group and that the audit work 
focuses on key controls, to optimise the level of assurance 
provided to the Committee and to management. The Committee 
receives reports at each meeting regarding the internal audit 
programme and reviews undertaken.
Recommendations are made to management for control 
improvements as appropriate. Topics dealt with by internal  
audit reports reviewed by the Committee during 2019 included:
• Procurement
• Accounts Receivable
• Payroll
• IFRS 16 
• Opus Energy business unit key financial controls
• ROC and CfD claims
• Modern Slavery Act compliance (undertaken by KPMG)
• Cyber security operational controls (undertaken by KPMG)
• Health and Safety (undertaken by Turner & Townsend)
• IT incident and problem management
• IT change control management
• Finance consolidation project
In addition, at each of its scheduled meetings, the Committee 
received reports detailing progress with implementing 
recommendations previously raised by internal audit to assess 
the extent to which management had taken appropriate steps  
to implement the recommendations raised. The Chair of the 
Committee, independent of management, maintains direct 
contact with both the internal and external auditor, allowing 
open dialogue and feedback.
The Committee has considered the effectiveness of internal 
audit, based on the quality of its plan and the information 
provided in its reporting, and is satisfied that the co-sourcing 
model described above remains appropriate for the Group and 
that on this basis the quality, experience and expertise of the 
function is appropriate for the Group and its business. In reaching 
this conclusion, the Committee considered the views of the 
Head of Group Risk and Internal Audit, the external auditors and 
management as well as its own assessment of the quality  
of reports and support provided by the internal audit function.
At its meeting held in November 2019, and supported by a report 
provided by Deloitte, the Committee discussed the Institute of 
Internal Auditors’ draft Code of Practice (“the draft Code”) for 
Internal Audit. The Committee believes the development of a 
code will be an enabler to continuous improvement in standards 
across listed companies for internal audit. The Committee 
considered the key areas associated with the draft Code, 
including the focus on the quality of information provided in 
enabling the Board, Audit Committee and executive 
management to identify key risks, risk appetite (and how these 
are monitored) and contribute to effective oversight of the risk 
and control environment of organisations. The Committee 
believes these areas are an integral part of the work of the 
internal audit function for the Group. Further discussions on 
how the draft Code can support work of the Internal Audit 
function will be undertaken in 2020.
This report was reviewed and approved by the Audit Committee 
on 26 February 2020.

Annual statement to the shareholders
Dear shareholders
I am pleased to present my first Directors’ Remuneration Report 
as Chair of the Remuneration Committee (“the Committee”) for 
the 2019 financial year. I would like to thank Tony Thorne for his 
stewardship of the Committee over the last six years and his 
support during my transition to Committee Chair in April 2019. 
The report is set out in the following sections:

Annual assessment of performance in 2019
The Committee determines the remuneration of the Executive 
Directors and members of the Executive Committee against  
the strategic objectives and priorities of the Group. For 2019, 
this was principally achieved through an assessment of 
performance against a combination of business and financial 
measures comprising the Group Scorecard. A high proportion of 
total remuneration is delivered through variable pay, rewarding 
achievement of short-term and long-term targets. As was 
approved by shareholders at the 2018 AGM, there is no personal 
element in the determination of bonuses for Executive Directors 
and members of the Executive Committee. Therefore a bonus is 
only earned where this is merited by the Group’s performance 
against pre-determined metrics set by the Committee. 
As described by Will Gardiner on pages 8 to 12 the Group is 
making good progress with the delivery of our strategy and  
has performed well during 2019. The Committee is of the view 
that remuneration outcomes for 2019 represent a fair and 
reasonable reflection of overall business performance.
There is a detailed review of achievement against the core 
performance measures on pages 105 and 106. Together,  
these measures form a Group Scorecard, key features of which 
reflect the objectives set for our Pellet production, Generation 
and Customers businesses. Components within the Group 
Scorecard are scored between 0 and 2, with a score of 1 
representing on-target performance. During the course of  
a year there are two formal reviews giving the Committee  
the opportunity to discuss with and challenge management  
on the progress made and likely Group Scorecard outcomes. 
The Committee determines the final Group Scorecard result  
in the February following each financial year and reports to 
shareholders on the outcome in the annual report for the year  
in which the bonus is earned. For the financial year 2019, the 
Committee determined the overall performance at a meeting 
held on 25 February 2020. The Committee assessed that  
this fairly reflected the Group’s performance and as such,  
the Committee did not apply discretion to the outcome of  
the Group Scorecard which was 0.90. 
This score results in annual bonuses of 45% of the maximum 
being paid to Executive Directors. Further detail on this 
outcome is set out on page 107. This score also forms part of the 
performance assessment for the Performance Share Plan (PSP) 
for the grants which complete their three-year vesting period in 
May 2020.
Long-term assessment of performance
Share awards made in 2017 under the Performance Share Plan 
(PSP) were tested against performance over the period 2017 to 
2019 through two measures: Relative Total Shareholder Return 
(“TSR”) which accounted for 50%, and the three-year average  
of the Group Scorecard which accounted for 50%. The Group’s 
TSR over the period was below median, leading to 0% vesting  
for this element. The average Group Scorecard outcome over 
the same period was 0.93 leading to 36% vesting for this 
element. The overall vesting outcome for the 2017 PSP awards 
is therefore 18%.
The Committee determined that the vesting outcome was 
consistent with the Group’s and Executive Directors’ 
performance and so there was no need to apply discretion.
Group CEO total remuneration
At £1.2 million Will Gardiner’s 2019 total remuneration was less 
than the £1.9 million of 2018. This is primarily due to a lower pay 
out from the 2017 PSP. A detailed breakdown of the single figure 
can be found on page 103.
Base pay increases for Executive Directors
For the 2019 pay review, Will Gardiner and Andy Koss both 
received an increase in base salary of 2.8% which took effect  
in April 2019. This was in line with increases applied to the  
wider workforce. Andy Skelton was appointed CFO on  
2 January 2019. As he had only recently joined the organisation 
when the 2019 pay review took place, Andy Skelton’s pay was 
not reviewed during the year. 
The Committee has reviewed the salaries of all Executive 
Directors for 2020 and has determined that an increase of 3% 
will be applied from 1 April 2020. This is consistent with the 
salary increase for the wider workforce.
All-employee remuneration
In 2018 an employee survey captured feedback from employees 
from all areas of the business on the coverage and level of 
benefits provided by the Group. In response to this feedback, 
the Group implemented a new core benefit offering in 2019.  
The overall principle of the new offering is that all employees, 
irrespective of seniority in the organisation, have access to 
comprehensive health and risk benefits. This required a 
significant investment, particularly in our Customers businesses.

New remuneration policy
In 2019 the Committee undertook a full review of the 
Remuneration Policy (“the Policy”), taking into account evolving 
market practice and feedback from our shareholders on the 
existing arrangements. The key changes are:
• Annual bonus – has been simplified with payments linked  
to a smaller number of financial and strategic goals 
• Long-term incentive – in the new LTIP the Group Scorecard 
will be replaced with Cumulative Adjusted EPS (“EPS”) for 50% 
of the award, whilst retaining TSR (against the FTSE-350) for 
the remaining 50% of the award. This supports the Group’s 
purpose, strategy and the creation of long-term sustainable 
value, measured through TSR and EPS. The targets for the new 
EPS measure will be disclosed in March by release of an RNS
• The shareholding requirement for the Group CEO will increase 
from 200% to 250% of salary and will be 200% of salary for the 
other Executive Directors. A post cessation shareholding 
requirement, equal to the in employment shareholding 
requirement (or the shareholding on departure  
if lower) will be introduced for Executive Directors and  
will apply for two years after cessation of employment
• The incumbent Executive Directors have voluntarily agreed  
to a reduction in their pension contributions to align with  
the contribution rate for new joiners to the wider workforce 
(currently 10% of salary) from 1 January 2023. Pension 
contributions for new Executive Directors will be aligned  
with this level on appointment
The emphasis of the new Policy will be on a greater 
performance-related element for achieving stretching targets, 
combined with more meaningful levels of equity which must  
be held for at least five years. 
We are proposing an increase to the variable pay opportunity  
for the Group CEO, increasing the overall maximum total 
remuneration equivalent to 25% of salary for target 
performance (and 50% of salary for maximum). This is designed 
to drive incremental longer-term performance and to reflect  
the strategic change in the direction, size and complexity of  
the Group. The Group CEO’s maximum annual bonus will be 
increased from 150% to 175% of salary and the maximum  
annual LTIP award from 175% to 200% of salary, linked to the 
introduction of a long-term deferral and more stretching 
performance targets. As part of repositioning, the maximum 
annual bonus for other Executive Directors will be increased 
from 140% to 150%, with no change to the maximum percentage 
of salary for the annual LTIP award. 
This increase of variable pay opportunity will support an 
overarching aim to outperform demanding KPIs, the attainment 
of which are a pre-requisite to achieving total remuneration at 
above median levels to the market. 
The full policy appears on pages 91 to 102 with a summary  
of the key changes on pages 91 and 92.
Shareholder engagement
In developing this Policy, during the course of 2019 we 
considered comments provided by shareholders on the previous 
Policy and engaged with our largest shareholders and proxy 
agencies to explain the proposed revisions to the Policy. I met 
with a number of shareholders, where valuable feedback  
was provided on the Policy. We appreciate the time taken by 
shareholders to provide their feedback and the Committee  
has taken this feedback into consideration. As a consequence 
of this, EPS has replaced the Group Scorecard in the new LTIP  
and the shareholding requirement for the Group CEO will 
increase to 250% (from 200%). In addition, to reflect shareholder 
feedback and the requirements of the UK Corporate 
Governance Code, we will align the pension contributions of 
existing Executive Directors with those available to new joiners 
to the wider workforce, from 1 January 2023. The Policy will be 
subject to a shareholder vote at the AGM on 22 April 2020.
The level of shareholder support at the 2019 AGM was 80.7% for 
the Annual Report on Remuneration. This was a significant vote 
in favour but down on the prior year. However, we believe based 
on the feedback provided to us that our new policy will address 
concerns previously raised by shareholders.
Workforce engagement
The Committee is kept updated on remuneration policies and 
decisions for the wider workforce, including pension provisions, 
pay reviews and gender pay gap reporting. Salary increases for 
Executive Directors and Executive Committee members are 
made only after the Committee has reviewed increases for the 
wider workforce. 
In 2020, I will be meeting with the chairs of the new MyVoice 
Forums to explain the role of the Committee, how executive  
pay is set, how it aligns with wider workforce pay, and to answer 
directly any questions they have. Following this meeting, and 
incorporating any feedback received, I will then write to all of 
the workforce. 
Employees can ask questions about any aspect of working for 
Drax, including pay, and receive answers directly from the Group 
CEO via the weekly “Ask Will” Group-wide email. Employees can 
also raise matters via the MyVoice Forums, which are then 
communicated up to the Board through meetings between  
the Forum chairs and the Board Chair and Group CEO.
Summary
Along with the other members of the Committee, I am satisfied 
that the 2019 remuneration outcomes for the Executive 
Directors fairly reflect the performance of the Group, provide a 
fair and consistent approach to remuneration across the Group, 
and remain in shareholders’ interests. We are also confident 
that the proposed Policy will underpin our purpose, the delivery 
of our strategy and reward long-term sustainable performance.
I hope that having read the information in this report you will 
vote in support of the Annual Report on Remuneration and the 
proposed Remuneration Policy at the 2020 AGM.

Long-term incentive plan awards
For PSP awards granted in May 2017, vesting was conditional upon two performance measures with up to 50% of shares vesting 
subject to TSR performance and up to 50% of shares vesting subject to Group Scorecard performance as below:
Total Shareholder Return TSR (50%)
Group Scorecard (50%)
TSR performance over three years relative 
to FTSE 350 as follows:
• Below median = 0% vesting
• At median = 25% vesting (threshold)
• Upper quartile = 100% vesting
Group scorecard performance averaged over the three-year performance period  
as follows (capped at 1.5):
• Score 0.75 = 0% vesting
• Score greater than 0.75 and below 1.0 = straight line basis between 0% and 50%
• Score 1 = 50% 
• Score greater than 1.0 and below 1.5 = straight line basis between 50% and 100%
• Score 1.5 = 100% vesting

The Committee considered the formulaic performance outcomes and was satisfied that this was appropriate and therefore no 
discretion was applied. The 2019 Group Scorecard included environmental, social and corporate governance metrics (ESG).  
The Committee were satisfied that the bonus structure and resulting outcomes for all employees did not raise any ESG risks  
by inadvertedly motivating irresponsible behaviour.

Directors’ Remuneration Policy for approval at the 2020 AGM
As reported in last year’s Remuneration Report, the Directors’ Remuneration Policy has been subject to a full review by  
the Committee in 2019. The Committee has considered the business strategy, shareholder feedback on the current policy, 
corporate governance developments and best practice. This has culminated in the formulation of a revised remuneration 
policy (“the Policy”) which will apply for three years from the date of the 2020 AGM, subject to shareholder approval.
If approved, the Policy will be effective from immediately 
after the AGM on 22 April 2020 and will be binding until the 
close of the 2023 AGM. The core principles of the Policy are 
set out below:
• Making sure that executive remuneration is closely linked 
to the performance of the Group 
• Simplifying the design and application of our executive 
remuneration programmes
• Incentives are earned for the delivery of stretching  
Group financial, strategic and operational targets
• Attracting and retaining the right talent through market-
aligned incentive opportunity
• Aligning executive reward with shareholder value, over  
the longer term, primarily through the new Long-Term 
Incentive Plan (LTIP), approval for which will be sought  
at the 2020 AGM

Pension contributions for new Executive 
Directors will be aligned with those 
available to other new joiners in the wider 
workforce on appointment.
Alignment of pensions with the wider workforce is in line 
with the provisions of the UK Corporate Governance Code 
(“the Code”).
Annual Bonus
The maximum bonus opportunity for  
the Group CEO will increase from 150% 
to 175% of salary and for other Executive 
Directors from 140% to 150% of salary.
Split between:
1.  Financial element (105% of salary for 
Group CEO, 90% of salary for other 
Executive Directors) – performance 
based on a smaller number of financial 
and operational metrics, paid in cash
2.  Strategic element (70% of salary for 
Group CEO, 60% of salary for other 
Executive Directors) – performance 
based on a smaller number of strategic 
and other non-financial metrics, paid 
in shares
At least 40% of the bonus will be deferred 
into shares (currently 35%), vesting after 
three years and subject to a two year 
holding period. If 40% deferral is not 
attained by the strategic element, a 
proportion of the financial element will  
be deferred into shares in order to 
achieve this minimum level of deferral.
The proposed structure simplifies the bonus plan by reducing 
the number of performance metrics. Splitting the bonus 
into a financial cash element and a strategic deferred shares 
element responds to shareholder concerns on the existing 
structure and clarifies the role each component plays  
in supporting the business strategy, whilst also providing  
a deferral in shares which contributes to a philosophy  
of driving long-term performance and growth in returns  
to shareholders.
The maximum annual bonus opportunity will increase  
by 25% of salary for the Group CEO and by 10% for other 
Executive Directors to reflect the increased level of deferral, 
as well as the longer vesting and holding period applicable 
to this deferred element. For example, the level of maximum 
deferral for the Group CEO has increased from 52.5% of 
salary under the current Policy to 75% of salary under the 
proposed Policy, and therefore the vast majority (22.5% of 
salary) of the increase in maximum opportunity is delivered 
in shares which are subject to a five year combined vesting 
and holding period. The maximum cash bonus is broadly 
unchanged. This change places a greater emphasis on 
alignment with long-term shareholder value.
Malus and clawback provisions are in line with corporate 
governance best practice.

Rationale
LTIP
The maximum opportunity to increase 
from 175% to 200% of salary for the Group 
CEO only. The maximum opportunity for 
other Executive Directors will remain at 
175% of salary. 
The Group Scorecard element is removed 
from the LTIP.
Performance will be measured against  
the following metrics:
1. Cumulative Adjusted EPS – 50% 
weighting
2. Relative TSR (FTSE 350) – 50% 
weighting
The two-year post vesting holding period 
will be retained.
The increase in the Group CEO’s opportunity ensures 
that where Group performance is strong then total 
remuneration levels will be competitive against the market.
At the 2017 Policy review, some shareholders expressed 
concern at the use of the Group Scorecard in both the 
annual bonus and LTIP. We have responded to that feedback. 
The proposed structure replaces the current 50% weighting 
on the Group Scorecard with Cumulative Adjusted EPS. 
This aligns with the general shareholder preference for 
financial-only metrics on long-term incentives.
Introducing a Cumulative Adjusted EPS measure with 
50% weighting ensures Executive Directors are focused 
on driving earnings performance of the business, which 
is a major factor in delivering value to shareholders. The 
Committee is confident that the introduction of this metric 
provides a greater link between reward outcomes and the 
shareholder value over the longer term.
Shareholding 
Requirement
The shareholding requirement for the 
Group CEO will increase from 200% to  
250% of salary and will be 200% for 
the other Executive Directors. A post-
cessation shareholding requirement, 
equal to the in employment shareholding 
requirement (or the shareholding on 
departure if lower) will be introduced for 
Executive Directors and will apply for two 
years after cessation of employment.
Increased shareholding requirement for the Group CEO 
achieves greater alignment with shareholders. 
Ensures that Executive Directors’ interests remain aligned 
with shareholders to implement a strategy which delivers 
value for the longer term beyond their departure, in line 
with the requirements of the Code. It also facilitates 
implementation of clawback.
New Policy – Key components of remuneration
The Policy has been designed to support the delivery 
of strong business performance and the creation of 
shareholder value. We set out below key components of  
the Policy for Executive Directors, and in the notes following 
the table we comment on differences between this Policy 
and that for the remuneration of employees generally.
Base salary
Base salary helps to attract, reward and retain the right 
calibre of Executive Director to deliver the leadership  
and management needed to execute the Group’s strategy 
and business plan.
Practical operation
Base salary reflects the role, the executive’s skills and 
experience, and market level. To determine the market level, 
the Committee reviews remuneration data on executive 
positions at companies which the Committee considers to 
be appropriate comparators. The comparator companies are 
selected, with advice from the Committee’s remuneration 
advisers, taking into account factors such as, but not limited 
to, sector, size, and international presence.
On appointment, an Executive Director’s base salary is set 
at the market level, or below if the executive is not fully 
experienced at this level. Where base salary on appointment 
is below market level to reflect experience, it will be increased 
over time to align with the market level, subject to performance.
Base salaries of all Executive Directors are generally 
reviewed once each year, with increases applying from 
April. Reviews cover individual performance, experience, 
development in the role, market comparisons and pay 
reviews for the wider workforce.
Maximum potential value
The base salaries of Executive Directors in post at the 
start of the policy period, and who remain in the same role 
throughout the policy period, will not usually be increased 
by a higher percentage than the average annual percentage 
increase in salaries of all other employees in the Group.
Exceptions to this, subject to performance and development, 
are where:
(i)  An Executive Director has been appointed at below 
market level to reflect experience. Under this scenario, 
increases will be capped at 5% above the average annual 
percentage increase in salaries of all other Group 
employees
(ii)  An Executive Director has been promoted internally  
(or the scope or nature of their role has changed) and 
their salary is below market level. Under this scenario, 
increases will not be capped and the Committee can 
increase base salary to the market level within an 
appropriate timeframe

Annual bonus
The award of annual bonus will be based on annual performance against financial and operational measures linked to  
the business plan. The aim of the deferred portion of annual bonus is to further align executives to shareholders’ interests,  
by linking share-based reward to long-term sustainable performance.
Practical operation
Maximum potential value
The maximum opportunity will be split between two 
elements: 
Financial element – performance is based on financial and 
operational metrics. This element represents 105% of salary 
for the Group CEO and 90% of salary for other Executive 
Directors. Subject to the minimum level of deferral noted 
below, this element will be paid in cash. 
Strategic element – performance is based on strategic  
and other non-financial metrics. This element will represent 
70% of salary for the Group CEO and 60% of salary for other 
Executive Directors. This element will be paid in shares 
deferred for a period of three years. 
A minimum of 40% of the total bonus outcome will be 
deferred into shares in the form of nil cost options under the 
Deferred Share Plan (DSP) , regardless of the pay outcomes 
of the financial and strategic elements. If this amount is 
not attained by the strategic element, a proportion of the 
financial element will also be deferred into shares in order  
to achieve this minimum level of deferral.
A two-year holding period applies to DSP awards post-
vesting, during which Executive Directors may not sell  
the shares, except to pay any tax due.
Dividends or dividend equivalents (which may assume 
notional reinvestment) are paid on DSP awards.
There is no payment for below threshold performance.  
The outcome for threshold performance is 0% of maximum. 
The outcome for target performance is 50% of maximum. 
In certain circumstances, the Committee can apply malus 
and clawback to cash bonus awards, as set out in the notes 
to the policy table.
Targets, outcomes and resulting payouts are published 
retrospectively in the Annual Report on Remuneration. 
The Committee will review the formulaic outcome of the 
bonus award and has the discretion to amend the final 
outcome to make sure that bonus payments reflect overall 
performance. The use of such discretion will be explained 
fully in the relevant Annual Report on Remuneration.

Performance measures
The performance conditions applicable to the annual bonus 
awards are split between the two elements:
Financial element – performance measures based on annual 
financial and operational targets, which will be linked directly 
to the performance of the Group and determined by the 
Board. The Committee may amend the measures used each 
year in line with business strategy. 
Strategic element – performance measures based on non-
financial and strategic targets, which will be determined 
annually by the Board and will be aligned with the business 
strategy. 
The weighting of the respective elements is 60% on financial 
elements and 40% on strategic elements. The Committee 
has the discretion to vary the weightings from year to year. 
In exceptional circumstances such that the Committee 
believes the original measures and/or targets are no longer 
appropriate, the Committee has discretion to amend 
performance measures and targets during the year.

Long Term Incentive Plan (LTIP) 
The Group’s LTIP provides long-term alignment with shareholders based on the outcomes of Relative TSR and Cumulative 
Adjusted EPS metrics. 
Practical operation
Maximum potential value
Under the new LTIP, Executive Directors receive an annual 
grant of shares. Approval for the new LTIP will be sought  
at the 2020 AGM.
Shares vest on the third anniversary of the grant, subject  
to continued service or “good leaver” termination provisions, 
and the achievement of performance conditions over a three 
year period determined by the Committee. Vested awards  
are then subject to a further holding period of two years for 
Executive Directors.
Dividends or dividend equivalents (which may assume 
notional reinvestment) may be paid on LTIP awards.
There is no payment for below threshold performance.  
The outcome for threshold performance is 25% of maximum. 
The Committee will include an override provision in each 
grant under the LTIP. This will give the Committee discretion 
to determine that no vesting shall occur, or that vesting  
shall be reduced, if there are circumstances (relating to the 
Group’s overall performance or otherwise) which make 
vesting when calculated by reference to the performance 
conditions alone inappropriate.
In certain circumstances, the Committee can apply malus  
or clawback to unvested/vested awards, as set out in the 
notes to the policy table.
The Committee reserves discretion to:
(i)  amend the performance conditions/targets attached  
to outstanding awards granted under this Policy, in the 
event of a major corporate event or significant change  
in economic circumstances, or a change in accounting 
standards having a material impact on outcomes; and
(ii)  adjust the vesting of LTIP awards and/or the number 
of shares underlying unvested LTIP awards, on the 
occurrence of a corporate event or other reorganisation. 
In the event of a change of control, the treatment of long-
term incentives will be determined in accordance with  
the plan rules.

In exceptional circumstances the Committee may on

amounts. Further detail is provided on page 96.
Performance measures
Two performance measures will apply to LTIP awards made  
from April 2020 as follows:
(i)  TSR performance over three years relative to the FTSE 350 
(50% of award), vesting as follows:
 
Below Median = 0% of maximum
 
Median = 25% of maximum
 
Upper Quartile = 100% of maximum
(ii)  Cumulative Adjusted EPS performance over three years, 
(50% of award), vesting as follows:
 
Below Threshold = 0% of maximum
 
Threshold = 25% of maximum
 
Maximum = 100% of maximum
Straight line vesting occurs between performance levels  
for both conditions.
Details of the EPS target for proposed grants in 2020 will  
be notified to shareholders via RNS in March 2020, ahead  
of the 2020 AGM, and will be applicable in the event that  
the new Policy is approved by shareholders.

Pension
Pension provision is one of the components to attract, reward and retain the right calibre of executive, to ensure delivery  
of the leadership and management needed to execute the Group’s purpose and strategy.
Practical operation
Executive Directors are entitled to a contribution to the Group’s 
defined contribution pension plan, a cash payment in lieu of pension 
(subject to normal statutory deductions), or a combination of pension 
contributions and cash in lieu of pension.
Maximum potential value
Existing Executive Directors will receive the 
following pension contribution rates until 
31 December 2022. 
• Group CEO – 20% of salary
• Chief Financial Officer – 16% of salary
• CEO Generation – 20% of salary
From 1 January 2023, the contribution rates for 
existing Executive Directors will be aligned with 
the rate for new joiners to the wider workforce 
(currently 10% of salary).  
The pension contribution rate for new Executive 
Directors will be aligned with the wider workforce 
rate from the date of appointment.
Performance measures
No performance measures apply.
Benefits
Benefits are provided to be market competitive as an integral part of Executive Directors’ total remuneration. 
Practical operation
Executive Directors receive a car benefit, life assurance, income 
protection, the opportunity to participate in all-employee share  
plans on the same basis as other employees, annual private health 
assessment and annual private medical cover. Additional benefits  
may be provided if the Committee considers them appropriate.
Relocation expenses are paid, where appropriate, in individual cases. 
Executive Directors’ relocation expenses are determined on a case-by-
case basis. The Policy is designed to assist the Executive Director to 
relocate to a home of similar standing.
Maximum potential value
Benefits are set at a level appropriate to the 
individual’s role and circumstances.
The maximum opportunity will depend on the  
type of benefit and cost of its provision, which  
will vary according to the market and individual 
circumstances.
Performance measures
No performance measures apply.
Shareholding requirement 
The shareholding requirement aligns the interests of Executive Directors with shareholders.
Practical operation
The shareholding requirement for the Group CEO is 250% of salary  
and for the other Executive Directors it is 200% of salary. This is to  
be achieved within a period five years after the date of the 2020 AGM  
(or after the date of appointment for new Executive Directors if this  
is later). 
Until this level is reached, Executive Directors who receive shares by 
virtue of any share plan award or who receive DSP awards are expected 
to retain 50% of the shares received net (i.e. after income tax and 
national insurance contributions). Shares which have not vested and  
are subject to performance conditions will not count towards the 
requirement. Unvested awards subject to service only (e.g. DSP awards) 
will count towards the guideline on a net of tax basis.
Shares vesting in respect of awards granted after the 2020 AGM will  
be held in the Group’s Employee Benefit Trust until the shareholding 
requirement is met and all share disposals will be subject to the 
Company’s share dealing Code.

Post cessation shareholding requirement
The Group’s post-cessation shareholding requirement aligns the interests of Executive Directors with shareholders over  
the longer term beyond their departure from the Group.
Practical operation
A post-cessation shareholding requirement, equal to the employment 
shareholding requirement (or the shareholding on departure if lower) 
applies for a two year period after cessation of employment. For clarity, 
the post-cessation shareholding requirement is 250% of salary for the 
Group CEO and for the other Executive Directors it is 200% of salary.  
In addition, shares vesting during this period will remain subject to the 
two-year post-vesting holding period, which may therefore extend 
beyond the two-year period for which the post-cessation shareholding 
requirement applies.
Only shares relating to awards which are granted after the date of the 
2020 AGM will be included for the purposes of this requirement. 
Shares purchased by the Executive Director (including those from all 
employee share plans), will not be included.
Shares counting towards this requirement will not be released from 
the Employee Benefit Trust during the period in which the post-
cessation shareholding requirement applies, to support enforceability. 
Acceptance of the post-cessation shareholding requirement will be a 
condition of participation in all share awards granted after the 2020 
AGM and will be included in the grant documentation for awards.

Performance measures and approach to setting targets
The measures for elements of variable pay will be:
• Financial, strategic and operational measures consisting of targets set by the Committee each year in conjunction  
with the Board. The targets are aligned with key business goals determined at the start of each year
• Relative TSR, which aligns Executive Director remuneration with creation of long-term shareholder value
• Cumulative Adjusted EPS, which aligns Executive Director remuneration with the realisation of our earnings growth plans, 
which is a major determinant of shareholder value
• The Committee sets targets for the performance measures each year, taking into account market conditions, the business 
plan and other circumstances as appropriate. A summary of the measures that apply for the following year are disclosed in 
the Annual Report on Remuneration
Elements of previous policy that will continue

Circumstances in which malus or clawback may apply
Malus and clawback for the annual bonus – the Committee may reduce the performance outcome, or may require an 
Executive Director to repay any amount of cash bonus it considers appropriate, in circumstances of:
• material financial misstatement
• fraud or misconduct
• material failure of risk management and corporate failure
• if assessment of a performance condition is found to have been based on an error, inaccuracy or misleading information
• in other circumstances that the Committee considers justifying the operation of the clawback provision 
The clawback period is two years. If a repayment of bonus is required, the Committee may reduce the number of shares that 
may vest under the DSP or LTIP arrangements by an appropriate amount.
The Committee may also reduce the number of shares, or clawback shares for a two year period commencing on vesting 
under an LTIP and/or DSP awards in circumstances of:
• material financial misstatement
• fraud or misconduct
• material failure of risk management and corporate failure
• if assessment of a performance condition is found to have been based on an error, inaccuracy or misleading information
• in other circumstances that the Committee considers justifying the operation of these provisions
If a repayment of a share award is required the Committee may reduce the number of shares that may vest under the DSP  
or LTIP arrangements, and/or may reduce the amount of any annual bonus by an appropriate amount.
Committee’s judgement and discretion
In addition to assessing and making judgements on the meeting of performance targets and the appropriate incentives 
payable, the Committee has certain operational discretions it can exercise in relation to Executive Directors’ remuneration. 
These include, but are not limited to:
• Reviewing the formulaic outcome of the cash bonus, DSP and LTIP awards and applying discretion to amend the final 
outcomes, to ensure that the outcomes reflect overall performance or an individual executive’s performance
• Deciding whether to apply malus or clawback to an award
• Determining whether a leaver is a “good leaver”
Where such discretion is exercised, it will be explained in the relevant Annual Report on Remuneration.
Remuneration scenarios

Approach to recruitment remuneration
The Committee will apply the components set out in the table on pages 91 to 97 to determine the remuneration of newly 
appointed Executive Directors. Base salary will be set at a level appropriate to the role and the experience of the Executive 
Director being appointed. Where this is below the market level, it will be adjusted over time to align with the market level, 
subject to good performance. The incentive provision for a new Executive Director will include an annual bonus of up to 150% 
of salary (175% of salary for the Group CEO), with financial and strategic elements as set out in the Policy table above, and an 
LTIP award of up to 175% of salary, 200% of salary for the Group CEO (in exceptional circumstances the Committee may on 
recruitment grant a percentage of salary in excess of these amounts but in such circumstances it would be capped at 300% 
of salary). The Committee may also determine it appropriate to honour prevailing contract commitments for an individual  
in the event they are promoted to an Executive Director position.
In relation to Executive Directors appointed from outside the Group, where the Committee considers it to be necessary  
to secure the appointment of the Executive Director, the Committee may:
• Pay compensation for loss of benefits on resignation from a previous employer, such as loss of long-term share incentives 
(subject to the right to phase any payment to reflect performance, the requirement to mitigate loss and the Group’s right  
to claw back any amount which is subsequently paid to the Executive Director by the former employer, and to claw back  
an appropriate proportion of the payment if the Executive Director leaves soon after appointment). Any compensation 
made will not exceed the value of the benefits lost as determined by the Committee acting fairly and reasonably
• Agree a rate for employer pensions contributions, or salary supplements in lieu of pension contribution, which reflects  
the contribution rate for the wider workforce at the date of appointment
• Make appropriate payments in circumstances where an Executive Director is relocated from outside the UK

Service agreements and termination
Executive Directors’ service agreements are of indefinite duration, terminable at any time by either party giving 12 months’ 
notice and are available for inspection at the Group’s registered office.
Element
Details
Notice periods
Executive Directors may be required to work during the notice period or may be provided with pay  
in lieu of notice if not required to work the full notice period.
Under each of the Executive Directors’ service agreements, the Group has the right to make a payment in 
lieu of notice of termination, the amount of that payment being the salary and benefits that would have 
accrued to the Executive Director during the contractual notice period. For the avoidance of any doubt 
this excludes any performance bonus (or cash equivalent) for the relevant period of unworked notice. 
Compensation for 
loss of office
If an Executive Director’s employment is brought to an end by either party, and if the Committee 
considers that it is necessary to pay the Executive Director a termination payment, the Committee’s 
policy, in the absence of a breach of the service agreement by the Executive Director, is to determine 
an Executive Director’s termination payment in accordance with his/her service agreement. The 
termination payment will be calculated based on the value of base salary and contractual benefits that 
would have accrued to the Executive Director during the contractual notice period. The Committee will 
seek mitigation to reduce the amount of any termination payment to a leaving Executive Director when 
appropriate to do so, having regard to the circumstances and the law governing the agreement. It may, 
for example, be appropriate to consider mitigation if the Executive Director has secured another job at 
a similar level. Mitigation would not apply retrospectively to a contractual payment in lieu of notice.
In addition, the Executive Director may be entitled to a payment in respect of his/her statutory rights. 
The Group may pay reasonable fees for a departing Executive Director to obtain independent legal 
advice in relation to their termination arrangements and nominal consideration for agreement to any 
contractual terms protecting the Group’s rights following termination. No service agreement includes 
any provision for the payment of compensation upon termination. Any compensation payable in those 
circumstances would need to be determined at the time and in the light of the circumstances.
Treatment of  
annual bonus on 
termination
All bonus payments are discretionary. The Committee will consider whether a departing Executive 
Director should receive a cash bonus and deferred share award in respect of the financial year in 
which, and/or immediately preceding which, the termination occurs, pro-rated to reflect the period  
of the performance year completed at the date of termination. The Committee will take into account 
performance; the reason for termination; cooperation with succession; any breach of goodwill; 
adherence to contractual obligations/restrictions; and any other factors which they believe should be 
taken into account. The service contract for Will Gardiner as Group CEO, does not entitle him to any 
payment of bonus on termination of employment.
If the employment ends in any of the following circumstances, the Executive Director will be treated  
as a “good leaver” and the Executive Director will be eligible for an annual bonus:
• redundancy
• retirement
• ill-health or disability, proved to the satisfaction of the Group
• death
If the termination is for any other reason, an award will be at the Committee’s discretion and it is the 
Committee’s policy to ensure that any such award properly reflects the departing Executive Director’s 
performance and behaviour towards the Group. Therefore the amount of any such award will be 
determined, taking into account (i) the Executive Director’s personal performance and behaviour 
towards the Group and (ii) the Group performance. 
If an award is made, it will normally be paid/granted as soon as is reasonably practicable after the  
Group performance element has been determined for the relevant period. There may be circumstances 
in which the Committee considers it appropriate for the award to be made earlier, for example, on 
termination due to ill-health, in which case, on-target performance shall be assumed.

Treatment of 
unvested long-term 
incentive and 
deferred share 
awards on 
termination
The Committee will consider the extent to which deferred and conditional share awards held by the 
Executive Director under the DSP and LTIP should lapse or vest. Any determination by the Committee 
will be in accordance with the rules of the relevant plan.
In summary, the rules of the proposed LTIP provide that awards will vest (pro-rated to the date  
of employment termination) if employment ends for any of the following reasons (“long-term good  
leaver reasons”):
• redundancy
• retirement
• ill-health or disability, proved to the satisfaction of the Company
• death
• change of control
If employment ends for any other reason, the participant may be deemed a “good leaver” at the 
Committee’s discretion. In doing so, it will take account of all relevant circumstances, in particular,  
the Group’s performance; the Executive Director’s performance and behaviour towards the Group 
during the performance cycle of the relevant awards; and other relevant factors, including the 
proximity of the award to its maturity date.
Awards which vest subject to satisfaction of the relevant performance conditions, will be time pro-rated, 
and will ordinarily vest on the normal vesting date subject to the post-vesting shareholding period.
The rules of the DSP provide that deferred bonus awards will vest (in full) if employment ends for  
any of the good leaver reasons detailed above. If employment ends for any other reason, the participant 
may be deemed a “good leaver” at the Committee’s discretion. In doing so it will take account of all 
relevant circumstances, in particular, the Group’s performance; the Executive Director’s performance 
and behaviour towards the Group during the performance cycle of the relevant awards, and a range  
of other relevant factors, including the proximity of the award to its maturity date.
The rules of the DSP and LTIP also provide that in circumstances where awards vest, they do so at  
the normal vesting date, unless the Committee exercises discretion to vest awards earlier.
Outside 
appointments
Executive Directors may accept external Board appointments, subject to the Chair’s approval. Normally 
only one appointment to a listed company would be approved. Fees may be retained by the Executive 
Director.
Consideration of circumstances for leavers
The Committee will consider whether the overall value of any benefits accruing to a leaving Executive Director is fair  
and appropriate, taking account of all relevant circumstances. Examples of circumstances in which the Committee may  
be minded to award a cash bonus, DSP award and/or permit the vesting of LTIP and/or DSP awards include:
• The Executive Director’s continued good performance up to and following the giving of notice
• The Executive Director accommodating the company in the timing of his/her departure and handover arrangements
Conversely, the Committee may be minded not to allow such payments if the reason for the departure is (for example)  
due to poor performance or if the Executive Director does not continue to perform appropriately following notice.

Practical operation
Maximum potential value
Fees
To attract a Chair and 
independent Non-Executive 
Directors who, together with  
the Executive Directors, form  
a Board with a broad range of 
skills and experience.
The Chair’s remuneration is determined  
by the Committee whilst that of the other 
Non-Executive Directors is determined by 
the Chair and the Executive Directors.  
These are determined in the light of:
• Fees of the Chair and Non-Executive 
Directors of other listed companies 
selected for comparator purposes, on  
the same basis as for Executive Directors;
• The responsibilities and time commitment; 
and
• The need to attract and retain individuals 
with the necessary skills and experience.
Non-Executive Directors’ fees are reviewed 
periodically against market comparators.
Non-Executive Directors receive an annual 
base fee. Additional annual fees are paid:
• To the Senior Independent Director (which 
includes the fee for chairing a Board 
Committee other than the Audit 
Committee);
• To the Chair of the Audit Committee;
• To the Chair of the Remuneration 
Committee; and
• To the Chair of any other committee  
(this is not paid to the Chair of the 
Nomination Committee if he or she  
is also the Chair of the Board).
Non-Executive Directors are not entitled  
to participate in any performance related 
remuneration arrangements.
Overall aggregate fees paid to all Non-
Executive Directors will remain within the 
limit as stated in the Company’s Articles 
(currently £1,000,000).
Expenses
Reasonable travel and accommodation 
expenses are reimbursed as applicable.
Non-Executive Directors do not receive any benefits in kind, nor are they eligible for any annual performance bonus,  
pension or any of the Group’s share-based reward plans.
The Chair’s notice period is six months whilst the other Non-Executive Directors have a notice period of one month.  
Further information on the service agreements of the Non-Executive Directors can be found on page 111.

Differences between the policy and that of the remuneration of employees generally
The following differences apply between the remuneration of Executive Directors and the policy on the remuneration  
of employees generally:
• Executive Directors and a number of senior employees are eligible for LTIP awards, although there are differences in the 
quantum of the grants that are made
• Annual bonus levels vary across the workforce, but deferral of bonuses into DSP awards applies only to Executive Directors
• Employees in the collective bargaining unit have a contractual right to receive an annual bonus, subject to the Group’s 
performance and continued employment, whereas Executive Directors and all other UK-based employees participate  
in a discretionary bonus plan
• Employer pension contribution (or salary supplement) are up to 10% of salary for new joiners from 1 July 2019, irrespective 
of seniority. There are legacy pension contribution arrangements which continue to be in operation for employees who 
joined prior to 1 July 2019. From 1 January 2023 the contribution rates for existing Executive Directors will be aligned with 
the rate for new joiners to the wider workforce (currently 10% of salary)
• In some cases hourly paid employees qualify for overtime payments
Context
Wider employee population
In determining Executive Director remuneration, the Committee also takes into account the level of general pay increases 
within the Group. Employees are not directly consulted on the Policy, however as referenced on page 88, there are a number 
of existing channels designed to capture the views of the workforce on remuneration, including the MyVoice forums.
The Committee’s policy is that annual salary increases for Executive Directors should not exceed the average annual salary 
increase for the wider employee population unless there is a particular reason for a higher increase, such as a change in the 
nature or scope of responsibilities or if an Executive Director has been appointed at a salary below market level reflecting 
experience in the role. This is explained in more detail on page 92.
The Committee also considers external market benchmarking to inform executive remuneration decisions. External market 
benchmarking is also considered in relation to remuneration decisions of the wider workforce.
Environmental, social and governance issues
The Committee is able to consider corporate performance on environmental, social and governance issues when setting  
the remuneration of Executive Directors. Specific measures can be included in the strategic element of the annual bonus. 
The Committee is also able to consider these issues in determining whether to exercise its discretion to adjust formulaic 
outcomes of the annual bonus and LTIP. 
Shareholder feedback
As referenced on page 88, during 2019 the Committee engaged with a number of our largest shareholders and proxy 
agencies on the proposed changes to the Directors’ Remuneration Policy. The Committee considered their views, together 
with wider market practice and general investor sentiment on executive remuneration, and took these into account when 
determining the finalised Policy outlined in this report.

Outlined below is a brief synopsis of the KPIs used and their strategic rationale:
Group
• Safety is a key priority for the business. The Total Recordable Incident Rate (TRIR) is defined as the number of incidents  
per 100,000 hours worked
• Financial performance metrics for 2019 were based on underlying adjusted EBITDA, average net debt and progress on the 
acquisition of the hydro and gas generation assets from ScottishPower. The weighting given to adjusted EBITDA, at 25%,  
reflects the priority given to a strong Group financial performance
• Being a sustainable business means driving long-term, profitable growth while achieving a positive economic, social and 
environmental impact Ensuring that our staff are fully engaged and regard Drax as an employer they would recommend  
is an important part of this impact
• Pellet quality impacts both Pellet Production and Generation. The “fines” metric is used to drive pellet quality, from our own 
supply, which in turn minimises downstream supply chain costs
• Developing strong in-house pellet supply capability and lowering pellet production costs have a direct impact on gross margins 
available from Generation
• The value available to the Group from biomass generation is a key driver of gross margins. Biomass unit commercial availability 
reflects the value that can be derived from maximising biomass unit output
• The value from flexibility captures the value available from fully supporting the UK electricity grid
The Committee made an in-depth review of the score for each of the performance measures, ensuring these were individually 
supportable, and then reviewed the overall outcome, to determine whether to exercise its discretion and adjust the final score.  
No such adjustment was made.
Safety. The independently verified Total Recordable Incident Rate for the 2019 financial year was 0.22 which was the same as  
the score for the 2018 financial year. This was below target but above the minimum threshold, and the score achieved was 0.3, 
which was lower that the 2018 financial year (1.0). 
Finance. Adjusted EBITDA achieved for the 2019 financial year was £410 million, slightly below the target level. Average net debt 
was £950 million against a target of £975 million, reflecting management’s strong focus in this area. 
Acquisition of Assets. In respect of the progress on the acquisition of the hydro and gas generation assets from ScottishPower, the 
assets delivered above the stretch target set for EBITDA and the integration has been successful. The Committee determined an 
outcome of 2.0. 
Sustainability. In the three areas mentioned in the table, the Committee set specific objectives which constituted part of the 
Group’s 2019 sustainability plan. In determining performance, the Committee reviewed quantitative outcomes, (for example 
analysis included assessment prepared by an external agency tracking reputation). Collectively across the three measures an 
outcome of 1.0 was achieved.
Pellet Production. Fines (a measure of wood pellet quality) and cost of production are key measures for assessing operational 
efficiency. Fines and cost of production failed to achieve the minimum threshold. Further information can be found on page 10.
Power Generation. Biomass commercial availability is a key metric relating to our ability to operate when needed and is considered 
by the Board regularly as part of overall operational performance. It failed to achieve the minimum threshold. Value from flexibility 
is used by management to assess Drax’s support to balancing the UK electricity grid. It achieved the stretch target. Further 
information can be found on page 11 of the CEO report.
Customers. Each of the three targets adopted by the Committee are used by management and reported to the Board as part  
of tracking business performance. Cost to serve customers was between the minimum threshold and target. Value created  
as gross margin was below the minimum threshold. SMART meters achieved a target outcome, the outturn of which included  
an assessment of performance against external benchmark data. 
The Committee approved the Group Scorecard result for 2019 at its meeting on 25 February 2020, subject to the final approval  
of the financial results and annual report and accounts by the Directors on 26 February 2020.

is based on the share price of 378.6 pence on 27 March 2019. The options will vest after five years subject to continued service.
Total pension entitlements for defined contribution schemes (audited information)
Executive Directors are entitled to receive a contribution to the Group’s defined contribution pension plan, cash in lieu of pension 
contributions or a mixture of these. The employer contribution for Will Gardiner and Andy Koss in 2019 was 20% of base salary, and 
the employer contribution for Andy Skelton was 16%. Will Gardiner’s employer contribution is delivered as cash in lieu of pension, 
whereas for Andy Koss and Andy Skelton it is delivered in part as contributions to Group pension plan and part as cash in lieu.  
No Executive Director was a member of a defined benefit pension scheme.
Payments to former directors (audited information)
As reported in the 2017 Remuneration Report, Dorothy Thompson (former Group CEO) is entitled to pro-rata vesting of a PSP award 
made in 2017. A total of 12,569 shares, including dividend shares, are due to vest in May 2020, based on performance vesting of 18%, 
and a two year holding period will apply to the net shares. 
Payments for loss of office (audited information)
No payments in respect of loss of office were made during the year.
Statement of directors’ shareholding and share interests (audited information)
The shareholding guidelines under the current Director’s Remuneration Policy require Executive Directors who receive shares  
by virtue of share plan awards, or who receive deferred bonus share awards under the DSP, to retain 50% of the shares received  
net (i.e. after income tax and national insurance contributions) until the value held is equal to at least 200% of salary. Only shares  
that are not subject to performance conditions count towards the threshold. Awards subject to service only count towards the 
guideline on a net of tax basis. As at 31 December 2019, the shareholding guidelines had not been met, as detailed in the table

Percentage change in the Group CEO’s remuneration compared with the wider employee population
The table below shows how the percentage change in the Group CEO’s salary, benefits and bonus between 2018 and 2019 
compares with the percentage change in the average of each of those components of pay for a group of employees. The 
Committee has selected all Group employees below Executive Director level based in the UK, as these are the vast majority of 
Group employees and provide the most appropriate comparator.

16:1
The total remuneration of all UK employees of the Group on 31 December 2019 has been calculated on a full-time (and full-year) 
equivalent basis using the single figure methodology and reflects their actual earnings for 2019. The only exception is for 
employees with Defined Benefit (DB) pensions, where the employer contribution to the respective schemes has been used in the 
calculation (rather than the single figure methodology) to reduce the administrative complexity. This is likely to undervalue the  
DB pension value. No adjustments (other than to achieve full-time and full-year equivalent rates) were made and no components  
of remuneration have been omitted. Of the three options permitted to calculate the percentiles, the Committee has chosen option A 
(the calculation of the total pay and benefits for 2019 for all UK employees on an FTE basis), as they believe it is the most robust and 
most statistically accurate method of the options permitted and it is in line with the preference of BEIS. 
Set out in the table below is the base salary and the total pay and benefits for each of the identified employees.

Total Pay and Benefits

£71,716
Base salaries of all employees, including Executive Directors, are set with reference to a range of factors including market practice, 
experience and performance in role. 
The Group CEO has a larger portion of his pay based on performance of the business than the individuals at P25, P50 and P75.  
The Committee believe that our senior executives should have a significant portion of their pay directly linked to the performance 
of the business, but that does mean that the pay ratios are likely to fluctuate each year depending on business performance and 
associated outcomes of incentive plans. 
The Group is comprised of various different business units and teams with different levels of pay, including call centre staff, 
support staff and engineers. The Committee reviews information about employee pay, reward and progression policies of the 
Group and is comfortable that the median pay ratio is consistent with these policies.

Annual bonus
The Group Scorecard measures and targets for 2020 have been established for the Group and for each Group business. Details  
of performance against the measures will be disclosed in the 2020 Annual Report on Remuneration so far as possible, whilst 
maintaining commercial confidentiality. The following table sets out the categories and a description of the measures.
Target
Reason for use
Financial
Group adjusted EBITDA(1)
Adjusted EBITDA is our principal financial metric, combining the underlying performance  
of each business to give a Group outcome. 
Cost of production(2)
Reducing the cost of biomass production will make a positive contribution to the Group’s 
financial performance in the medium term and beyond 2027.
Customers business  
contribution(2)
Driving profitability is the key priority of focus for our Customers business, this will in part  
be achieved by increasing the efficiency and effectiveness of our energy supply operations.
Average net debt(2)
A structural reduction in debt is a key objective for the Group with progress assessed against 
weighted average net debt targets measured within the financial year
Strategic
Safety
The same basis for assessing performance as in previous years, focused on reducing the number 
of safety related incidents, as measured by the total recordable incident rate
Progress on strategic projects
This element will assess progress against key strategic projects. The choice of projects included 
in this measure will be subject to approval of the Board.
Environmental, employees and 
sustainability/ reputation (3)
Sustainability and Environmental practices are a critical part of our values, vision and how Drax 
will create long-term sustainable returns for shareholders. We have adopted an environmental 
KPI which will be derived from the Group’s 2020 CDP rating, which supports our commitment 
around tackling climate change. This is combined with independent rating of how well we 
engage and support our employees, in addition to an independently determined rating of our 
reputation in sustainable business practices.
Notes:
(1) The outturn of this KPI is part of the Group’s independent financial audit
(2)  The outturn of these KPIs are independently reviewed
(3) The outturn of these KPIs are derived from metrics assessed by external agencies
LTIP
The Committee intends to grant LTIP awards to Executive Directors of equal value to 200% of salary for the Group CEO and 175%  
of salary for other Executive Directors following the 2020 AGM, subject to shareholder approval of the Policy and the new LTIP.  
For the TSR element, performance will be assessed versus the constituents of the FTSE 350 with threshold vesting (25% of 
maximum) for performance in line with the median and maximum vesting for performance in line with upper quartile. The targets 
for the EPS element have not been determined but will be announced in March, prior to the AGM, by release of an RNS.
Non-Executive Directors’ fees
Non-Executive Directors’ fees will be reviewed by the Chair and Executive Directors in March 2020 and any changes will be 
disclosed in the 2020 Annual Report on Remuneration.

remained a member of the Remuneration Committee until his retirement from the Board on 28 June 2019. Other members of the 
Remuneration Committee during the year were John Baxter (from April 2019); Tim Cobbold (until September 2019); Philip Cox; 
David Lindsell (until April 2019); David Nussbaum and Vanessa Simms, all of whom are independent Non-Executive Directors.  
The Group Company Secretary was secretary to the Committee. 
The Group CEO was invited to attend meetings of the Committee, except when his own remuneration was discussed, as was the 
Chief Transformation Officer, Group HR Director and the Group Head of Reward.
Adviser to the Committee
The adviser to the Committee for the year was PwC. PwC is an independent adviser appointed by the Committee in October 2010, 
following a competitive tender process, to advise on market practice and remuneration of Executive Directors and Non-Executive 
Directors. PwC is a member of the Remuneration Consultants Group and a signatory to its Code of Conduct. In addition, the 
Committee has satisfied itself that the advice it receives is objective and independent as PwC has confirmed there are no conflicts 
of interest.
From time to time the Group engages PwC to provide financial, taxation and related advice on specific matters. The Committee  
will continue to monitor such engagements in order to be satisfied that they do not affect PwC’s independence as an adviser to  
the Committee. PwC was paid £173,000, excluding VAT, during 2019 in respect of advice given to the Committee.
Other matters

Authority to purchase own shares
At the AGM held on 17 April 2019, shareholders authorised the Company to make market purchases of up to 10% of the issued 
ordinary share capital. As announced on 22 January 2019, the Company completed its share buy-back programme. The purpose  
of the programme was to reduce the Company’s share capital. In aggregate, the Company purchased 13,841,295 shares at a cost 
(including dealing and associated costs) of £50,250,181 between April 2018 and 21 January 2019. All shares were purchased in  
the open market. The shares are held in treasury pending cancellation or re-issue.
At the 2020 AGM, shareholders will be asked to renew the authority to make market purchases of up to 10% of the issued ordinary 
share capital. More details on the resolution number 18 can be found in the notice of meeting.

Rights and obligations attaching to shares
The rights attaching to the Company’s Ordinary Shares are set out in the Articles, available on the Company’s website at  
www.drax.com/policies. The Articles may only be changed by shareholders by special resolution.
Attention should be given to the following sections within the Articles, covering the rights and obligations attaching to shares:
Variation of rights – which covers the rights attached to any class of shares that may be varied with the written consent of the 
holders of not less than three-quarters in nominal value of the issued shares of that class, or with the sanction of an extraordinary 
resolution passed at a separate General Meeting of the holders of those shares.
Transfer of shares – provides detail of how transfers of shares in certified and uncertified form may be undertaken. It also sets out 
the Directors’ rights of refusal to effect a transfer and the action that Directors must take following such refusal. It should be noted 
that a shareholder does not need to obtain the approval of the Company, or of other holders of shares in the Company, for a transfer 
of shares to take place.
Voting and deadlines for exercising voting rights – these sections of the Articles deal with voting on a show of hands and on a poll. 
They also cover the appointment of a proxy or corporate representative. In respect of voting deadlines, the Articles provide for the 
submission of proxy forms not less than 48 hours before the time appointed for the holding of the meeting. It has been the 
Company’s practice since incorporation to hold a poll on every resolution at Annual General Meetings and General Meetings. 
A trustee holds shares on behalf of employees in respect of the Group’s Share Incentive Plan. The voting rights attached to such 
shares are not directly exercisable by the employees. The employee may direct the trustee on how to vote at a General Meeting 
and the trustee may only cast its vote in respect of shares over which it has received a valid direction from employees.

Disabled employees
The Company gives full consideration to applications for employment by disabled persons, bearing in mind the aptitudes of the 
applicant concerned. In the event of employees becoming disabled, every effort is made to ensure that their employment with  
the Group continues, and that appropriate training is arranged. It is the policy of the Group that the training, career development 
and promotion of disabled persons should, so far as possible, be identical to that of other employees.
Political donations
Drax is a politically neutral organisation and did not make any political donations in 2019. The company regularly engages with 
regulators and policymakers (including those associated with political parties and governments) to listen and contribute to 
discussions on a wide range of matters. Such engagement is an important part of our strategy and contributing to initiatives 
enabling the UK in its goal of being carbon neutral by 2050. Further information on how we engage with stakeholders can be  
found on pages 24 to 29, and our Political Engagement Policy can be found on the Company’s website at: www.drax.com/about-us/
drax-political-engagement-policy. On page 27 we explain how we engaged with shareholders during the year in establishing  
our Political Engagement Policy.
While we do not believe that any expenditure incurred as a result of this engagement would be considered a political donation 
under the Companies Act 2006 (“the Act”), due to the broad definition of political donations and as a matter of good governance 
and transparency, we have provided information on areas of expenditure which may be regarded as falling within the scope of  
the Act. During the year ended 31 December 2019, Drax exhibited at, and held events at, conferences organised by political parties, 
spending a total of £41,065. These events allow Drax to present its views on a non-partisan basis to politicians from across the 
political spectrum and non-political stakeholders such as NGOs and other listed and non-listed companies. These payments do not 
indicate support for any political party. The recipients were the Conservative Party (£30,065), the Labour Party (£8,000) and SERA 
(an environmental group affiliated to the Labour Party) (£3,000). 
At our 2020 AGM Drax will be seeking renewal from shareholders of the existing authority approved at the 2019 AGM. More details 
are contained in the Notice of AGM. 
Other significant agreements
• A £350 million facilities agreement dated 20 December 2012 (as amended and restated on 10 December 2015 and 21 April 2017 
and further amended by way of a supplemental amendment agreement dated 4 May 2017) between, amongst others, Drax 
Corporate Limited and Barclays Bank PLC (as facility agent) (the “Facilities Agreement”).
• An indenture dated 5 May 2017 between, amongst others, Drax Finco plc and BNY Mellon Corporate Trustee Services Limited  
(as Trustee) governing £350 million 4.25% senior secured notes due 2022 (the ”2017 Indenture”).
• An indenture dated 26 April 2018 (as amended and supplemented from time to time, including by a supplemental indenture 
dated 12 February 2019 and a supplemental indenture dated 16 May 2019) between, amongst others, Drax Finco plc and BNY 
Mellon Corporate Trustee Services Limited (as Trustee) governing $500 million 6.625% senior secured notes due November 2025 
(the “2018 Indenture” and, together with the 2017 Indenture, the “Indentures”).
• A £375 million term loan facilities agreement dated 24 July 2019 between, amongst others, Drax Corporate Limited and Banco 
Santander S.A., London Branch (as facility agent) (the “UK Private Placement”).
• A £125 million term loan facilities agreement dated 24 July 2019 between, amongst others, Drax Corporate Limited and Barclays 
Bank PLC (as facility agent) (the ”ESG Facility”).
Under the Indentures, a change of control (a “Notes Change of Control”) occurs if any person other than Drax Group plc becomes 
the beneficial owner of more than 50% of the voting rights of Drax Group plc’s direct subsidiary, Drax Group Holdings Limited 
(unless replaced by a successor parent company), or else if all or substantially all of the assets of Drax Group Holdings Limited are 
disposed outside of the Drax corporate group. No later than 60 days after any change of control, Drax Group Holdings must offer  
to purchase any outstanding notes at 101% of the principal amount of such notes plus accrued interest and other unpaid amounts.
Under the Facilities Agreement, the UK Private Placement and the ESG Facility, a change of control occurs if any person or group  
of persons acting in concert gains control of Drax Group plc or if Drax Group plc no longer holds directly 100% of the issued share 
capital of Drax Group Holdings Limited (subject to carve-outs for the interposition of an intermediate holding company) or else if a 
Notes Change of Control occurs. Following a change of control, if any lender requires, it may by giving notice to the relevant Group 
entity within 30 days of receiving notice from such Group entity that a change of control has occurred, cancel its commitments and 
require the repayment of its share of any outstanding amounts within three business days of such cancellation notice being given.

Directors’ interests and indemnity arrangements 
Other than a service contract between the Executive Directors and a Group company no director had a material interest at any 
time during the year in any significant contract with the Company or any of its subsidiary undertakings. There are no agreements 
between the Group and its Directors providing for compensation for loss of office or employment because of a takeover bid.  
The Company has appropriate indemnity insurance cover in place in respect of legal action against Directors of the Company  
and its subsidiaries.

Post balance sheet events
On 26 February 2020, following a comprehensive review of operations and discussions with National Grid, Ofgem and the UK 
Government, the Board determined to end commercial coal generation at Drax Power Station in 2021 – ahead of the UK’s 2025 
deadline. The Group will shortly commence a consultation process with employees and trade unions with a view to ending coal 
operations in September 2022. Under these proposals, commercial generation from coal will end in March 2021 but the two coal 
units will remain available to meet Capacity Market obligations until September 2022.
The Group currently anticipates incurring one-off closure costs of between £25 million and £35 million in the period until closure 
and initially expect to provide in full for these costs during 2020, where appropriate. In assessing the financial impact, the Group 
will also consider the useful lives, residual values and potential impairment of certain assets at Drax Power Station. The timing for 
completing this impairment review is uncertain as these assets remain an integral part of the site and a detailed closure plan needs 
to be finalised. The carrying amount of affected assets was approximately £240 million at 31 December 2019, comprising coal-
specific assets with useful lives up to 2025 and other assets with useful lives up to 2039. In addition, the Group held coal inventory 
at 31 December 2019 with a carrying amount of £103 million, which the Group expects to recover in full over the period to closure.  
A further update on these items will be provided in the Group’s interim financial statements for the first half of 2020. The Group 
expects to treat all closure costs and any asset obsolescence charges as exceptional items in the Group’s financial statements.  
As a result, the Group’s expectations for 2020 EBITDA are materially unchanged.
As part of the proposed coal closure programme the Group is implementing a broader review of operations at Drax Power Station. 
This review aims to support a safe, efficient and lower cost operating model which, alongside a reduction in biomass cost, positions 
Drax for long-term biomass generation following the end of the current renewable support mechanisms in March 2027. While 
previously being an integral part of the Drax Power Station site and offering flexibility to the Group’s trading and operational 
performance, the long-term economics of coal generation remain challenging and in 2019 represented only three percent of the 
Group’s electricity production. In January 2020, Drax did not take a Capacity Market agreement for the period beyond September 
2022 given the low clearing price.
Auditors and the disclosure of information to the auditor
So far as each person serving as a Director at the date of approving this report is aware, there is no relevant audit information, 
being information needed by the auditor in connection with preparing the report, of which the auditor is unaware. Having made 
enquiries of fellow directors, each Director has taken all steps that he/she ought to have taken as a Director to ascertain any 
relevant audit information and to establish that the auditor is aware of that information. This information is given and should  
be interpreted in accordance with the provisions of Section 418 of the Companies Act.
Resolutions will be proposed at the AGM for (i) the reappointment of Deloitte LLP as the auditor of the Group; and (ii) authorising 
the Directors to determine the auditor’s remuneration. As explained, the Audit Committee reviews the appointment of the auditor, 
the auditor’s effectiveness and its relationship with the Group, including the level of audit and non-audit fees paid to the auditor. 
Further details on the work of the auditor and the Audit Committee are set out in the Audit Committee report on pages 78 to 85.

Directors’ report continued
Drax Group plc Annual report and accounts 2019 119
The Directors are responsible for preparing the Annual report and the financial statements in accordance with applicable law  
and regulations.
Company law requires the Directors to prepare financial statements for each financial year. Under that law the Directors are 
required to prepare the Group financial statements in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRSs) as 
adopted by the European Union and Article 4 of the IAS Regulation and have elected to prepare the Parent Company financial 
statements in accordance with United Kingdom Generally Accepted Accounting Practice (United Kingdom Accounting Standards 
and applicable law), set out in FRS 101 “Reduced Disclosure Framework”. Under company law the Directors must not approve the 
accounts unless they are satisfied that they give a true and fair view of the state of affairs of the Company and of the profit or loss 
of the Company for that period.
In preparing the Parent Company financial statements, the Directors are required to:
• select suitable accounting policies and then apply them consistently;
• make judgements and accounting estimates that are reasonable and prudent;
• state whether applicable UK Accounting Standards have been followed, subject to any material departures disclosed and 
explained in the financial statements; and
• prepare the financial statements on the going concern basis unless it is inappropriate to presume that the Company will 
continue in business.
In preparing the Group financial statements, International Accounting Standard 1 requires that Directors:
• properly select and apply accounting policies;
• present information, including accounting policies, in a manner that provides relevant, reliable, comparable and understandable 
information;
• provide additional disclosures when compliance with the specific requirements in IFRSs are insufficient to enable users to 
understand the impact of particular transactions, other events and conditions on the entity’s financial position and financial 
performance; and
• make an assessment of the Company’s ability to continue as a going concern.
The Directors are responsible for keeping adequate accounting records that are sufficient to show and explain the Company’s 
transactions and disclose with reasonable accuracy at any time the financial position of the Company and enable them to ensure 
that the financial statements comply with the Companies Act 2006. They are also responsible for safeguarding the assets of the 
Company and hence for taking reasonable steps for the prevention and detection of fraud and other irregularities.
The Directors are responsible for the maintenance and integrity of the corporate and financial information included on the 
Company’s website. Legislation in the United Kingdom governing the preparation and dissemination of financial statements  
may differ from legislation in other jurisdictions.
Responsibility statement
We confirm that to the best of our knowledge:
• the financial statements, prepared in accordance with the relevant financial reporting framework, give a true and fair view of  
the assets, liabilities, financial position and profit or loss of the Company and the undertakings included in the consolidation 
taken as a whole;
• the Strategic report includes a fair review of the development and performance of the business and the position of the Company 
and the undertakings included in the consolidation taken as a whole, together with a description of the principal risks and 
uncertainties that they face; and
• the annual report and financial statements, taken as a whole, are fair, balanced and understandable and provide the information 
necessary for shareholders to assess the Company’s performance, business model and strategy.

Report on the audit of the financial statements
1. Opinion
In our opinion:
• the financial statements of Drax Group plc (the ‘parent company’) and its subsidiaries (the ‘group’) give a true and fair view of the 
state of the group’s and of the parent company’s affairs as at 31 December 2019 and of the group’s profit for the year then ended;
• the group financial statements have been properly prepared in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards 
(IFRSs) as adopted by the European Union;
• the parent company financial statements have been properly prepared in accordance with United Kingdom Generally Accepted 
Accounting Practice, including Financial Reporting Standard 101 “Reduced Disclosure Framework”; and
• the financial statements have been prepared in accordance with the requirements of the Companies Act 2006 and, as regards 
the group financial statements, Article 4 of the IAS Regulation.
We have audited the financial statements which comprise:
• the consolidated income statement;
• the consolidated statement of comprehensive income;
• the consolidated and parent company balance sheets;
• the consolidated and parent company statements of changes in equity;
• the consolidated cash flow statement;
• the basis of preparation and statement of accounting policies on pages 129 to 131;
• the notes 2.1 to 8.4 related to the consolidated financial statements; and
• the notes 1 to 9 related to the parent company financial statements.
The financial reporting framework that has been applied in the preparation of the group financial statements is applicable law and 
IFRSs as adopted by the European Union. The financial reporting framework that has been applied in the preparation of the parent 
company financial statements is applicable law and United Kingdom Accounting Standards, including FRS 101 “Reduced Disclosure 
Framework” (United Kingdom Generally Accepted Accounting Practice).
2. Basis for opinion
We conducted our audit in accordance with International Standards on Auditing (UK) (ISAs (UK)) and applicable law. Our 
responsibilities under those standards are further described in the auditor’s responsibilities for the audit of the financial 
statements section of our report. 
We are independent of the group and the parent company in accordance with the ethical requirements that are relevant to our 
audit of the financial statements in the UK, including the Financial Reporting Council’s (the ‘FRC’s’) Ethical Standard as applied to 
listed public interest entities, and we have fulfilled our other ethical responsibilities in accordance with these requirements. The 
non-audit services provided to the Group for the year are disclosed in note 2.3 to the financial statements. We confirm that the 
non-audit services prohibited by the FRC’s Ethical Standard were not provided to the group or the parent company.
We believe that the audit evidence we have obtained is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our opinion.
3. Summary of our audit approach
Key audit 
matters
The key audit matters that we identified in the current year were:
• Valuation of commodity, foreign exchange and other contracts
• Estimation of Customers unbilled revenue 
• Impairment of OCGT development assets
Within this report, key audit matters are identified as follows:
!  Newly identified
 Increased level of risk
 Similar level of risk
 Decreased level of risk
Materiality
The materiality that we used for the Group financial statements was £12.2m which was determined on the basis of 
taking into consideration a number of metrics, but with particular focus on Earnings before Interest, Taxation, 
Depreciation and Amortisation (Adjusted EBITDA) which excludes the impact of exceptional items and certain 
remeasurements. Our selected materiality represents approximately 3% of Adjusted EBITDA for the year.
Scoping
We focused our Group audit scope primarily on the audit work at four components, being Drax Generation, Haven 
Power, Opus Energy and Drax Biomass. These components represent the principal business units and account for 
virtually all of the Group’s net assets, revenue and profit before tax.
Independent Auditor’s Report  
to the Members of Drax Group plc
Drax Group plc Annual report and accounts 2019
122
Significant 
changes in 
our approach
The following changes were made to the key audit matters reported in the prior year:
• The presentation of the consolidated income statement covering both exceptional items and certain 
remeasurements was a key audit matter in 2018 as this was the first year in which the consolidated income 
statement was presented in this way. This was a one off key audit matter to reflect this significant change in 
presentation and therefore has been removed as a key audit matter in the current year.
• The accounting for the acquisition of Drax Generation Enterprise Limited is no longer a key audit matter. This was 
a prior year one-off acquisition and there have been no significant changes in the finalisation of the purchase 
price allocation in the current year, see Note 5.1.
• Impairment of OCGT development assets has been identified as a key audit matter in the current year. This reflects 
the delay in securing a capacity market contract which would facilitate continued development of the projects.
 Other aspects of our audit approach remain broadly consistent with the prior year.
4. Conclusions relating to going concern, principal risks and viability statement
4.1. Going concern
We have reviewed the directors’ statement on page 129 to the financial statements about whether they 
considered it appropriate to adopt the going concern basis of accounting in preparing them and their 
identification of any material uncertainties to the group’s and company’s ability to continue to do so over a 
period of at least twelve months from the date of approval of the financial statements.
We considered as part of our risk assessment the nature of the group, its business model and related risks 
including where relevant the impact of Brexit, the requirements of the applicable financial reporting framework 
and the system of internal control. We evaluated the directors’ assessment of the group’s ability to continue as 
a going concern, including challenging the underlying data and key assumptions used to make the assessment, 
and evaluated the directors’ plans for future actions in relation to their going concern assessment.
We are required to state whether we have anything material to add or draw attention to in relation to that 
statement required by Listing Rule 9.8.6R(3) and report if the statement is materially inconsistent with our 
knowledge obtained in the audit.
Going concern  
is the basis of 
preparation of 
the financial 
statements that 
assumes an 
entity will remain 
in operation for a 
period of at least 
12 months from 
the date of 
approval of  
the financial 
statements.
We confirm that 
we have nothing 
material to 
report, add or 
draw attention  
to in respect of 
these matters.
4.2. Principal risks and viability statement
Based solely on reading the directors’ statements and considering whether they were consistent with the 
knowledge we obtained in the course of the audit, including the knowledge obtained in the evaluation of the 
directors’ assessment of the group’s and the company’s ability to continue as a going concern, we are required 
to state whether we have anything material to add or draw attention to in relation to:
• the disclosures on pages 54 to 61 that describe the principal risks, procedures to identify emerging risks, and 
an explanation of how these are being managed or mitigated;
• the directors’ confirmation on page 55 that they have carried out a robust assessment of the principal and 
emerging risks facing the group, including those that would threaten its business model, future performance, 
solvency or liquidity; or
• the directors’ explanation on pages 52 and 53 as to how they have assessed the prospects of the group, over 
what period they have done so and why they consider that period to be appropriate, and their statement as 
to whether they have a reasonable expectation that the group will be able to continue in operation and meet 
its liabilities as they fall due over the period of their assessment, including any related disclosures drawing 
attention to any necessary qualifications or assumptions.
We are also required to report whether the directors’ statement relating to the prospects of the group required 
by Listing Rule 9.8.6R(3) is materially inconsistent with our knowledge obtained in the audit.
Viability means 
the ability of  
the group to 
continue over 
the time horizon 
considered 
appropriate by 
the directors.  
We confirm that 
we have nothing 
material to 
report, add or 
draw attention to 
in respect of 
these matters.

5. Key audit matters
Key audit matters are those matters that, in our professional judgement, were of most significance in our audit of the financial 
statements of the current period and include the most significant assessed risks of material misstatement (whether or not due to 
fraud) that we identified. These matters included those which had the greatest effect on: the overall audit strategy, the allocation 
of resources in the audit; and directing the efforts of the engagement team.
These matters were addressed in the context of our audit of the financial statements as a whole, and in forming our opinion 
thereon, and we do not provide a separate opinion on these matters.
5.1. Valuation of commodity, foreign exchange and other contracts 
Key audit 
matter 
description
Net losses on derivative contracts recognised in the Consolidated income statement in the year are £132.8m (2018: 
gains of £38.4m), with related derivative assets of £346.0m and liabilities of £289.4m recognised on the balance 
sheet as at 31 December 2019. Further detail of the key judgements are disclosed in the Audit Committee report on 
pages 82 and 83. Section 7 sets out the financial risk management notes.
The Group has exposure to a number of different financial risks including foreign exchange risk and commodity risk, 
and use a variety of derivative contracts to mitigate these risks, including commodity contracts, floating swap 
forwards and cross currency swaps. 
The valuation of derivative contracts is complex and requires judgement in areas including the selection of 
appropriate valuation methodologies, and assumptions in respect of future market prices and credit risk factors.
Due to the inherent risks as described above, the large volume of data involved in the contract valuations, the 
complex valuation methodologies applied, and the requirement for certain manual adjustments, we have identified a 
risk relating to the potential for management or employees of the company to value trades inappropriately.
How the 
scope of  
our audit 
responded 
to the key 
audit matter
We evaluated the design and implementation and tested the operating effectiveness of relevant controls related to 
the valuation of commodity and foreign exchange contracts. 
With involvement of our internal financial instrument specialists we tested management’s key judgements and 
calculations, including testing a sample of trades undertaken to trade tickets, confirming key contractual terms 
such as volumes and contracted prices.
We have assessed the valuation models used by management, including any manual adjustments to determine the 
fair value of the derivative instruments and performed independent valuations across a sample of both commodity 
and foreign exchange contracts.
We have analysed the appropriateness of management’s forward price curve assumptions by benchmarking these 
to third party sources and reviewed the consistency of the assumptions used across other areas of the financial 
statements, such as asset impairment, where relevant.
We have challenged management’s approach and assumptions involved in assessing fair value adjustments such as 
credit risk, time value of money and spread adjustments through consideration of third party data.
Key 
observations
From our testing, we are satisfied that the valuation of commodity and foreign exchange contracts is reasonable. 
We consider the valuation models used by management to be appropriate and the forward curve assumptions 
adopted are within an acceptable range.
5.2. Estimation of Customers unbilled revenue   
Key audit 
matter 
description
The recognition of retail revenue requires an estimation of customer usage between the date of the last meter 
reading and year end, which is known as unbilled revenue. Across the Customers division, unbilled revenue at the 
balance sheet date amounted to £207.6m (2018: £146.5m). Further detail of the key judgements are disclosed in the 
Group’s critical accounting judgements, estimates and assumptions set out on page 130 and the Audit Committee 
report on pages 82 and 83. Accrued income is disclosed in note 3.6.
The method of estimating unbilled revenue is complex and judgemental and requires assumptions for both the 
volumes of energy consumed by customers and the related value.
We identified a potential fraud risk in relation to revenue recognition in the Customer businesses, in particular to the 
estimates underpinning unbilled revenue, as these judgemental areas could be manipulated by management to 
mis-report revenue.

the estimation of unbilled revenue. This included controls over the reconciliation of meter readings provided by the 
energy markets, and which are used by management to estimate the power supplied. We also tested the controls 
over the price per unit applied in the valuation of unbilled revenue.
When external market information was not available at the balance sheet date, we obtained and considered 
management’s reconciliation of the volume of power purchased to their calculations of revenue supplied and 
completed sample tests to check that the December 2019 unbilled revenue amount was subsequently billed.
We also reviewed the aggregate unbilled revenue balance from previous periods to test that the amounts 
recognised were subsequently billed in line with the values accrued.
Key 
observations
Our retrospective reviews of estimated revenues found that management have historically achieved a high level of 
accuracy. We considered the estimates for revenue earned in the year to be appropriate.
5.3 Impairment of OCGT development assets   
!
Key audit 
matter 
description
An asset of £41.9m (2018: £36.1m) is recognised within the Consolidated balance sheet at 31 December 2019 in 
relation to development assets for OCGT projects. Continued development, construction and operation of these 
assets is ultimately dependent upon the ability to secure sufficient future income at an appropriate level in order to 
reduce the project risk and associated returns to an acceptable level.
Further detail of the key judgements are disclosed in the Group’s critical accounting judgements, estimates and 
assumptions set out on page 130 and the Audit Committee report on pages 82 and 83. Intangible assets are 
disclosed in note 5.3.
The business case for these projects is predicated on the ability to secure a Capacity Market contract at an 
appropriate level. Current clearing prices are noted to be below the levels required for further development of these 
projects and a risk has been identified in respect of the recoverable value of these assets. 
Estimating the recoverable value of these assets requires judgement in relation to key assumptions including 
discount rates, future income levels and capital costs.
We note that assumptions relating to long term revenues and costs are inherently difficult to assess. We note that 
the headroom calculated is highly sensitive to all key assumptions and any future negative changes would be 
expected to result in an impairment charge.
How the 
scope of  
our audit 
responded  
to the key 
audit matter
We evaluated the design and implementation of relevant controls in relation to management’s impairment 
assessment process. 
We have reviewed management’s models and challenged the key assumptions including discount rates, income 
assumptions and capital costs. We have benchmarked income assumptions against third party reports prepared by 
reputable market analysts and worked with internal valuation specialists to prepare an independent assessment of 
discount rates. We have challenged management over the appropraiteness of capital cost assumptions in light of 
asset specifications and procurement strategies for the project.
We have undertaken analysis and testing including;
• Running a range of sensitivities including alternative scenarios to assess whether an impairment would be 
required if other assumptions were adopted; 
• Verifying the mathematical accuracy of the cash flow models; and  
• Assessing whether the disclosures in note 5.3 of the financial statements appropriately disclose the key 
judgements taken so that the reader of the accounts is aware of the impact in the financial statements of 
changes to key assumptions that may lead to impairment.
Key 
observations
We believe that the assumptions used by management were appropriate and supported by third party independent 
assessments.
Discount rates applied by management are considered to be lower than expected for projects of this nature which 
would be expected to be in the range of 7.5% - 8.0% compared to management’s assumption of 7.0%. 
Based on alternative scenarios we are satisfied that no impairment is required.

6. Our application of materiality
6.1. Materiality
We define materiality as the magnitude of misstatement in the financial statements that makes it probable that the economic 
decisions of a reasonably knowledgeable person would be changed or influenced. We use materiality both in planning the scope of 
our audit work and in evaluating the results of our work.
Based on our professional judgement, we determined materiality for the financial statements as a whole as follows:
Group financial statements
Parent company financial statements
Materiality
£12.2m (2018: £7.6m)
£5.6m (2018: £4.6m)
Basis for 
determining 
materiality
We have determined materiality by considering a range 
of possible benchmarks but with a particular focus on 
Adjusted EBITDA, which excludes the impact of 
exceptional items and certain measurements, together 
with profit before and after interest and tax as well as 
the scale of the balance sheet and the overall size of 
the business. 
Our selected materiality represents approximately 3.0% 
of Adjusted EBITDA for the year (2018: 3.0%) the basis 
of which is consistent with the prior year.
We have capped materiality at 46% (2018: 60%) of the 
materiality identified for the Group. This is a judgement 
and reflects the significant value of investments held on 
the balance sheet at the year end (£719.7m). Parent 
company materiality equates to 0.8% of net assets 
(2018: 0.7%).
Rationale  
for the 
benchmark 
applied
When determining materiality, we have considered  
the size and scale of the business and the nature of  
its operations. We have also considered which 
benchmarks would be of relevance to the users of the 
financial statements and those applied to the audit of 
similar businesses.
We consider that Adjusted EBITDA is of particular 
relevance to users of the financial statements and  
is a key measure of performance used by the Group.  
It excludes volatility caused in particular by the 
remeasurements of derivative contracts and 
exceptional items, defined as those transactions that, 
by their nature, do not reflect the trading performance 
of the Group in the period.
When determining materiality, we considered the net 
assets of the company as its principal activity is as an 
investment holding company for the Group.
Adjusted EBITDA

Adjusted EBITDA 
£410m
Group materiality
£12m
Component materiality range 
£6m to £4m
Audit Committee 
reporting threshold £0.60m
6.2. Performance materiality
We set performance materiality at a level lower than materiality to reduce the probability that, in aggregate, uncorrected and 
undetected misstatements exceed the materiality for the financial statements as a whole. Group performance materiality was set at 
70% of group materiality for the 2019 audit (2018: 70%). In determining performance materiality, we considered the following factors:
• The low level of historical uncorrected misstatements within the consolidated financial statements;
• Our assessment of the control environment and conclusions from our testing of group wide controls; and
• No significant changes in the business in the year which would impact on our ability to forecast expected level of misstatement.
Drax Group plc Annual report and accounts 2019

6.3. Error reporting threshold
We agreed with the Audit Committee that we would report to the Committee all audit differences in excess of £0.6m (2018: £0.4m), 
as well as differences below that threshold that, in our view, warranted reporting on qualitative grounds. We also report to the 
Audit Committee on disclosure matters that we identified when assessing the overall presentation of the financial statements.
7. An overview of the scope of our audit
7.1. Identification and scoping of components
Our group audit was scoped by obtaining an understanding of the Group and its environment, including group-wide controls, and 
assessing the risks of material misstatement at the Group level. We focused our Group audit scope primarily on the audit work at 
four components, being Drax Generation, Haven Power, Opus Energy and Drax Biomass. These represent the principal business 
units of the Group and account for virtually all of the Group’s net assets, revenue and profit before tax. This is in line with our audit 
approach from the prior year. 
All work was performed by the UK audit team under the supervision of the Senior Statutory Auditor. No component or overseas 
auditors were engaged in the completion of our audit procedures in the current or prior year.
A full scope audit was performed for all significant components. This scope was selected to provide an appropriate basis for 
undertaking audit work to address the risks of material misstatement identified above. Our audit work at all significant component 
locations was executed at levels of materiality applicable to each individual entity which were lower than Group materiality and 
ranged from £4.0m to £6.0m (2018: £3.0m to £5.3m).
At the Group level we also tested the consolidation process and carried out analytical procedures to confirm our conclusion that 
there were no significant risks of material misstatement of the aggregated financial information of the remaining components not 
subject to audit or audit of specified account balances.
During 2019 and subsequently the Senior Statutory Auditor visited the primary locations for all four significant components.
8. Other information
The directors are responsible for the other information. The other information comprises the information included in the annual 
report, other than the financial statements and our auditor’s report thereon.
Our opinion on the financial statements does not cover the other information and, except to the extent otherwise explicitly stated 
in our report, we do not express any form of assurance conclusion thereon.
In connection with our audit of the financial statements, our responsibility is to read the other information and, in doing so, 
consider whether the other information is materially inconsistent with the financial statements or our knowledge obtained in the 
audit or otherwise appears to be materially misstated.
If we identify such material inconsistencies or apparent material misstatements, we are required to determine whether there is a 
material misstatement in the financial statements or a material misstatement of the other information. If, based on the work we 
have performed, we conclude that there is a material misstatement of this other information, we are required to report that fact.
In this context, matters that we are specifically required to report to you as uncorrected material misstatements of the other 
information include where we conclude that:
• Fair, balanced and understandable – the statement given by the directors that they consider the annual report and financial 
statements taken as a whole is fair, balanced and understandable and provides the information necessary for shareholders to 
assess the group’s position and performance, business model and strategy, is materially inconsistent with our knowledge 
obtained in the audit; or
• Audit committee reporting – the section describing the work of the audit committee does not appropriately address matters 
communicated by us to the audit committee; or
• Directors’ statement of compliance with the UK Corporate Governance Code – the parts of the directors’ statement required 
under the Listing Rules relating to the company’s compliance with the UK Corporate Governance Code containing provisions 
specified for review by the auditor in accordance with Listing Rule 9.8.10R(2) do not properly disclose a departure from a relevant 
provision of the UK Corporate Governance Code.
We have nothing to report in respect of these matters.
9. Responsibilities of directors
As explained more fully in the directors’ responsibilities statement, the directors are responsible for the preparation of the financial 
statements and for being satisfied that they give a true and fair view, and for such internal control as the directors determine is 
necessary to enable the preparation of financial statements that are free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error.
In preparing the financial statements, the directors are responsible for assessing the group’s and the parent company’s ability to 
continue as a going concern, disclosing as applicable, matters related to going concern and using the going concern basis of 
accounting unless the directors either intend to liquidate the group or the parent company or to cease operations, or have no 
realistic alternative but to do so.

10. Auditor’s responsibilities for the audit of the financial statements
Our objectives are to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements as a whole are free from material 
misstatement, whether due to fraud or error, and to issue an auditor’s report that includes our opinion. Reasonable assurance 
is a high level of assurance, but is not a guarantee that an audit conducted in accordance with ISAs (UK) will always detect a 
material misstatement when it exists. Misstatements can arise from fraud or error and are considered material if, individually 
or in the aggregate, they could reasonably be expected to influence the economic decisions of users taken on the basis of these 
financial statements.
Details of the extent to which the audit was considered capable of detecting irregularities, including fraud and non-compliance 
with laws and regulations are set out below.
A further description of our responsibilities for the audit of the financial statements is located on the FRC’s website at:  
www.frc.org.uk/auditorsresponsibilities. This description forms part of our auditor’s report.
11. Extent to which the audit was considered capable of detecting irregularities, including fraud
We identify and assess the risks of material misstatement of the financial statements, whether due to fraud or error, and then 
design and perform audit procedures responsive to those risks, including obtaining audit evidence that is sufficient and 
appropriate to provide a basis for our opinion.
11.1. Identifying and assessing potential risks related to irregularities
In identifying and assessing risks of material misstatement in respect of irregularities, including fraud and non-compliance with 
laws and regulations, we considered the following:
• the nature of the industry and sector, control environment and business performance including the design of the Group’s 
remuneration policies, key drivers for directors’ remuneration, bonus levels and performance targets;
• the Group’s own assessment of the risks that irregularities may occur either as a result of fraud or error;
• results of our enquiries of management, internal audit and the audit committee about their own identification and assessment  
of the risks of irregularities; 
• any matters we identified having obtained and reviewed the Group’s documentation of their policies and procedures relating to:
 
– identifying, evaluating and complying with laws and regulations and whether they were aware of any instances of non-
compliance;
 
– detecting and responding to the risks of fraud and whether they have knowledge of any actual, suspected or alleged fraud;
 
– the internal controls established to mitigate risks of fraud or non-compliance with laws and regulations;
• the matters discussed among the audit engagement team and involving relevant internal specialists, including tax, pensions,  
IT and financial instrument specialists regarding how and where fraud might occur in the financial statements and any potential 
indicators of fraud.
As a result of these procedures, we considered the opportunities and incentives that may exist within the organisation for fraud 
and identified the greatest potential for fraud in the following areas: impairment of OCGT development assets, cut-off of bilateral 
sales, working capital transactions and estimation of Customers unbilled revenue. In common with all audits under ISAs (UK), we 
are also required to perform specific procedures to respond to the risk of management override.
We also obtained an understanding of the legal and regulatory framework that the Group operates in, focusing on provisions of 
those laws and regulations that had a direct effect on the determination of material amounts and disclosures in the financial 
statements. The key laws and regulations we considered in this context included the UK Companies Act, Listing Rules, Pensions 
legislation, Tax legislation, and Regulations established by regulators in the key markets in which the Group operates, including the 
Office of Gas and Electricity Markets (Ofgem). 
In addition, we considered provisions of other laws and regulations that do not have a direct effect on the financial statements but 
compliance with which may be fundamental to the Group’s ability to operate or to avoid a material penalty. These included the 
operating and environmental regulations relevant to the Group. 
11.2. Audit response to risks identified
As a result of performing the above, we identified impairment of OCGT development assets and estimation of Customers unbilled 
revenue as key audit matters related to the potential risk of fraud. The key audit matters section of our report explains the matters 
in more detail and also describes the specific procedures we performed in response to those key audit matters. 
In addition to the above our procedures to respond to risks identified included the following:
• reviewing the financial statement disclosures and testing to supporting documentation to assess compliance with provisions of 
relevant laws and regulations described above as having a direct effect on the financial statements;
• enquiring of management, the audit committee and in-house legal counsel concerning actual and potential litigation and claims;
• performing analytical procedures to identify any unusual or unexpected relationships that may indicate risks of material 
misstatement due to fraud;
• reading minutes of meetings of those charged with governance, reviewing internal audit reports and reviewing correspondence 
with HMRC; 
Drax Group plc Annual report and accounts 2019
128
• in addressing the risk of fraud in revenue recognition and cut-off of bilateral sales, in addition to our testing described above we 
have performed focussed testing on trades close to the year end combined with analytical review procedures to assess accuracy 
and completeness of revenue recognised;
• in addressing the risk of fraud in the use of working capital transactions, we have challenged management on the rationale for all 
transactions entered into and reviewed the accounting treatments adopted by management against the specific contractual 
terms and arrangements associated with each individual transaction and reviewed the related disclosures in the financial 
statements; and
• in addressing the risk of fraud through management override of controls, testing the appropriateness of journal entries and other 
adjustments; assessing whether the judgements made in making accounting estimates are indicative of a potential bias; and 
evaluating the business rationale of any significant transactions that are unusual or outside the normal course of business.
We also communicated relevant identified laws and regulations and potential fraud risks to all engagement team members 
including internal specialists, and remained alert to any indications of fraud or non-compliance with laws and regulations 
throughout the audit.
Report on other legal and regulatory requirementss
12. Opinions on other matters prescribed by the Companies Act 2006
In our opinion the part of the directors’ remuneration report to be audited has been properly prepared in accordance with the 
Companies Act 2006.
In our opinion, based on the work undertaken in the course of the audit:
• the information given in the strategic report and the directors’ report for the financial year for which the financial statements are 
prepared is consistent with the financial statements; and
• the strategic report and the directors’ report have been prepared in accordance with applicable legal requirements.
In the light of the knowledge and understanding of the group and the parent company and their environment obtained in the 
course of the audit, we have not identified any material misstatements in the strategic report or the directors’ report.
13. Matters on which we are required to report by exception
13.1 Adequacy of explanations received and accounting records
Under the Companies Act 2006 we are required to report to you if, in our opinion:
• we have not received all the information and explanations we require for our audit; or
• adequate accounting records have not been kept by the parent company, or returns adequate for our audit have not been 
received from branches not visited by us; or
• the parent company financial statements are not in agreement with the accounting records and returns.
We have nothing to report in respect of these matters.
13.2 Directors’ remuneration
Under the Companies Act 2006 we are also required to report if in our opinion certain disclosures of directors’ remuneration have not 
been made or the part of the directors’ remuneration report to be audited is not in agreement with the accounting records and returns.
We have nothing to report in respect of these matters.
14. Other matters
14.1 Auditor tenure
Following the recommendation of the audit committee, we were appointed by the shareholders at the Annual General Meeting on 
17 April 2019 to audit the financial statements for the year ending 31 December 2019 and subsequent financial periods. The period 
of total uninterrupted engagement including previous renewals and reappointments of the firm is 15 years, covering the years 
ending 31 December 2005 to 2019.
14.2 Consistency of the audit report with the additional report to the audit committee
Our audit opinion is consistent with the additional report to the audit committee we are required to provide in accordance with ISAs (UK).
15. Use of our report
This report is made solely to the company’s members, as a body, in accordance with Chapter 3 of Part 16 of the Companies Act 
2006. Our audit work has been undertaken so that we might state to the company’s members those matters we are required to 
state to them in an auditor’s report and for no other purpose. To the fullest extent permitted by law, we do not accept or assume 
responsibility to anyone other than the company and the company’s members as a body, for our audit work, for this report, or for 
the opinions we have formed.

Financial statements
Introduction
The consolidated financial statements provide detailed 
information about the financial performance (Consolidated 
income statement), financial position (Consolidated balance 
sheet), and cash flows (Consolidated cash flow statement) of 
Drax Group plc (the Company) together with all of the entities 
controlled by the Company (collectively, the Group).
The notes to the financial statements provide additional 
information on the items in the Consolidated income statement, 
Consolidated balance sheet and Consolidated cash flow 
statement. The notes include explanations of the information 
presented. In general, the additional information in the notes  
to the financial statements is required by law, International 
Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS) or other regulations to 
facilitate increased understanding of the primary statements 
set out on pages 133-137.
Basis of preparation
The financial statements have been prepared in accordance 
with IFRS as adopted by the European Union and therefore  
the consolidated financial statements comply with Article 4  
of the EU IAS Regulation and the Companies Act 2006.
The financial statements have been prepared on the historical 
cost basis, except for certain assets and liabilities that are 
measured at fair value (principally derivative financial 
instruments) and the assets and liabilities of the Group’s defined 
benefit pension schemes (measured at fair value and using the 
projected unit credit method respectively).
Restatement of the 2018 financial statements
The Group provides comparative financial information in these 
financial statements for the year ended 31 December 2018.  
The financial information provided in respect of 2018 has been 
restated for the following two matters:
• The balance sheet for 2018 has been restated to reflect 
updated values for assets and liabilities acquired in relation  
to the acquisition of Drax Generation Enterprise Limited 
(formerly ScottishPower Generation Limited – see note 5.1) 
following conclusion of the completion statement process 
and finalisation of acquisition fair values during 2019. The 
new portfolio of pumped storage, hydro and CCGT generation 
assets are hereafter referred to as “the new generation assets.”
• The balance sheet for 2018 has also been restated to correct 
a historical error in the application of foreign exchange rates 
to the translation of fixed asset balances in the Group’s 
overseas subsidiaries. Correction of this error resulted in a 
£55.5 million increase in fixed asset carrying values and the 
balance of the translation reserve at 31 December 2018, with 
no impact on the Consolidated income statement or the 
Consolidated cash flow statement. See note 8.3 for further 
details. As this adjustment impacts the opening balance 
sheet for 2018, a restated balance sheet for 2017 has also 
been provided, as required by IAS 1.
Foreign currency transactions
Transactions in foreign currencies are translated into sterling at 
the exchange rate ruling at the date of the transaction. At each 
balance sheet date, monetary assets and liabilities that are 
denominated in foreign currencies are retranslated at the rates 
prevailing at that date. Non-monetary items are not retranslated.
Foreign exchange gains and losses arising on such 
retranslations are recognised in the consolidated income 
statement within foreign exchange (losses)/gains.
Foreign operations
The assets and liabilities of foreign operations with a functional 
currency other than sterling are translated into sterling using 
published exchange rates at the reporting date. The income  
and expenditure of such operations are translated into sterling 
using the exchange rate prevailing at the date of the 
transaction. Foreign exchange gains and losses resulting from 
the retranslation of the operation’s net assets and its results  
for the year are recognised in the Consolidated statement of 
comprehensive income.
Going concern
The Group’s business activities, along with future developments 
that may affect its financial performance, position and cash 
flows, are discussed within the Strategic report on pages 1 to 61 
of this Annual Report.
In the viability statement on page 52-53 the directors state that 
they have a reasonable expectation that the Group will be able 
to continue in operation and meet its liabilities as they fall due 
over the next three years.
Consequently, the directors also have a reasonable expectation 
that the Group will continue in existence for the next 12 months 
and, therefore, have adopted the going concern basis in 
preparing these financial statements.
Basis of consolidation
These consolidated financial statements incorporate the 
financial results of the Company and of all entities controlled  
by the Company (its subsidiaries) made up to 31 December each 
year. The Company owns 100% of the equity of all subsidiaries.
Accounting policies
The significant accounting policies for the measurement of an 
individual item in the financial statements are described in the 
note to the financial statements relating to the item concerned 
(see contents on page 132).
The accounting policies adopted in the preparation of the 
consolidated financial statements are consistent with those 
followed in the preparation of the Group’s annual consolidated 
financial statements for the year ended 31 December 2018, 
except for the adoption of new standards effective as of 
1 January 2019. In addition, the Group has early-adopted the 
amendments to IAS 39 and IFRS 17: Interest rate benchmark 
reform. The Group has not early-adopted any other standard, 
interpretation or amendment that has been issued but is not  
yet effective.
A full listing of new standards, interpretations and 
pronouncements under IFRS applicable to these financial 
statements is presented in note 8.2. The application of these 
new requirements has not had a material effect on the financial 
statements, other than in respect of IFRS 16. 
Drax Group plc Annual report and accounts 2019

Financial statements continued
Adoption of IFRS 16 (Leases)
IFRS 16 supersedes IAS 17 Leases, IFRIC 4 Determining whether 
an arrangement contains a lease, SIC 15 Operating leases and 
SIC 27 Evaluating the substance of transactions involving the 
legal form of a lease.
The Group has adopted IFRS 16 from 1 January 2019 using the 
modified retrospective method of adoption. Under this method, 
the standard is applied retrospectively with the cumulative 
effect of initially applying the standard recognised at the date 
of initial application. Consequently, comparative information  
in these financial statements for the year ended 31 December 
2018 has not been restated.
The new requirements have impacted the Group’s accounting 
for lease contracts. The Group’s lease portfolio predominantly 
relates to properties and the hire of plant and equipment at 
operating sites. On transition to IFRS 16 on 1 January 2019, 
assets controlled under lease contracts were brought onto  
the balance sheet as right-of-use assets, and the Group has 
recognised a corresponding liability for the amounts payable 
under the lease contracts.
On transition, the Group elected to use the available practical 
expedient allowing the standard to only be applied to those 
contracts identified as leases under the previous standards. 
Accordingly, the definition of a lease in accordance with IAS 17 
and IFRIC 4 will continue to apply to those leases entered into  
or modified before 1 January 2019. However, the Group has 
applied the new definition of a lease to all contracts entered 
into or modified on or after 1 January 2019. This change did not 
have a significant impact on the assessment of new contracts 
in 2019 that are in scope of the new definition of a lease.
See note 8.3 on page 204
Judgements and estimates
The preparation of financial statements requires judgement  
to be applied in forming the Group’s accounting policies. It also 
requires the use of estimates and assumptions that affect the 
reported amounts of assets, liabilities, income and expenses. 
Actual results may differ from these estimates.
Estimates and underlying assumptions are reviewed on an 
ongoing basis, with revisions recognised in the period in which 
the estimates are revised and in any future periods affected.
The judgements involving a higher degree of estimation or 
complexity are set out below and in more detail, including 
sensitivity analysis where appropriate, in the related notes.
Critical accounting judgements
The critical judgements made in the process of applying the 
Group’s accounting policies during the year that have the most 
significant effect on the amounts recognised in the financial 
statements are set out below.
Certain remeasurements and exceptional items – management 
makes judgements regarding transactions to exclude from the 
Adjusted Results of the Group, as described under Alternative 
Performance Measures, below.
See note 2.7 on page 149
Sources of estimation uncertainty
The following are the sources of estimation uncertainty that 
carry the most significant risk of a material effect on next year’s 
accounts – that is, the items where actual outcomes in the next 
12 months could vary significantly from the estimates made in 
determining the reported amount of an asset or liability.
Property, plant and equipment – property, plant and equipment 
is depreciated on a straight-line basis over its useful economic 
life. Useful economic lives are estimated and based on past 
experience, future replacement cycles and other available 
evidence. Useful economic lives are reviewed annually. The 
carrying value of property, plant and equipment at 31 December 
2019 is £2,327.4 million and depreciation on these assets in the 
year, based on the weighted average useful economic lives 
disclosed in note 3.1, was £159.0 million. 
See note 3.1 on page 152
Impairment – an impairment review is conducted annually of 
goodwill and of other assets and cash-generating units (CGUs) 
where an indicator of possible impairment exists. In 2019, an 
impairment assessment has been completed for five of the 
Group’s CGUs which have allocated goodwill or intangible 
assets with an indefinite life. The assessment of future cash 
flows that underpins such a review is based on management’s 
best estimate of retail margins, future commodity prices, supply 
volumes, the capacity market and economic conditions.
See note 2.4 on page 143, note 5.2 on page 170 and note 5.3 on 
page 171
Revenue recognition – the nature of some of the Group’s 
activities, particularly within the Customers segment, results  
in revenue being based on the estimated volumes of power 
supplied to customers between the last meter reading and the 
year end, at an estimated average price per unit. Assumptions 
that underpin these estimates are applied consistently and 
comparison of past estimates to final settlements suggests a 
high degree of accuracy. However, actual outcomes may vary 
from initial estimates.
Revenue from contracts satisfied over time is recognised in line 
with the progress of those contracts. Assumptions are applied 
consistently but actual outcomes may vary from initial estimates.
The value of revenue recognised by the Group in the period  
to 31 December 2019 in relation to the Customer business  
is £2,269.1 million.

Pensions – the Group records a net surplus or liability in its 
balance sheet for its obligation to provide benefits under 
approved defined benefit pension schemes, less the fair value  
of assets held by the pension schemes. The actuarial valuations 
of the schemes’ assets and liabilities are performed annually 
and depends on assumptions regarding interest rates, inflation, 
future salary and pension increases, mortality and other factors, 
any of which are subject to future change. One of the key 
estimations within the valuations is the discount rate. The value 
of the pension surplus recognised by the Group at 31 December 
2019 is £7.0 million. Sensitivities in the valuations are discussed 
in note 6.3.
See note 6.3 on page 179
Taxation – in accounting for both current and deferred tax  
the Group makes assumptions regarding the likely treatment  
of items of income and expenditure for tax purposes and the 
recoverability of deferred tax assets. These assumptions are 
based on interpretation of relevant legislation and, where 
required, consultation with external advisers.
The Group makes assumptions on whether it is appropriate  
to recognise deferred tax assets. Deferred tax assets are 
recognised when it is considered more likely than not that  
they will be recovered. The key assumption for the Group is  
in relation to the likelihood of sufficient future taxable profits  
in its US business to utilise tax losses. The Group has recognised 
deferred tax assets in relation to these losses and other 
temporary differences at 31 December 2019 of £27.5 million.
See note 2.6 on page 145
Alternative performance measures (APMs)
The measures described below are not measures that are 
defined within IFRS but provide additional information that  
is used by the Board to evaluate the Group’s trading 
performance. These measures have been defined internally  
and may therefore not be comparable to similar APMs 
presented by other companies. 
Presentation of the income statement
The Group’s financial performance for the period, measured in 
accordance with IFRS, is shown in the Total Results column on 
the face of the income statement. Exceptional items and certain 
remeasurements are deducted from the Total Results in arriving 
at the Adjusted Results for the year. The Group’s Adjusted 
Results are consistent with the way executive management  
and the Board assess the performance of the Group. Adjusted 
Results are intended to reflect the underlying trading 
performance of the Group’s businesses and are presented to 
assist users of the accounts in evaluating the Group’s trading 
performance and performance against strategic objectives, 
Exceptional items are those transactions that, by their nature, do 
not reflect the trading performance of the Group in the period. 
For a transaction to be considered exceptional, management 
considers the nature of the transaction, the frequency of similar 
events, previous precedent and commercial context. 
Exceptional items are approved by the Audit Committee.
Certain remeasurements comprise fair value gains and losses 
on derivative forward contracts to the extent those contracts 
do not qualify for hedge accounting, or hedge accounting is  
not effective, which under IFRS are recorded in revenue, cost of 
sales or foreign exchange gains/(losses) as described above. The 
Group regards all of its forward contracting activity to represent 
an economic hedge. The impact of excluding these fair value 
remeasurements is to reflect commodity sales and purchases  
at contracted prices (the price paid or received in respect of 
delivery of the commodity in question), taking into account the 
impact of financial trading (such as forward foreign currency 
purchases), in the Adjusted Results. The result of this adjustment 
shows the impact in revenue, cost of sales and foreign exchange 
gains/(losses) at the time the transaction takes place.
Further information on exceptional items and certain 
remeasurements in the current and previous period is included 
in note 2.7 to the financial statements.
The Group presents an additional subtotal in the Adjusted 
Results column. Adjusted EBITDA is earnings before interest, 
tax, depreciation and amortisation, excluding the impact of 
exceptional items and certain remeasurements. Adjusted 
EBITDA is the primary measure used by executive management 
and the Board to assess the financial performance of the Group 
as it provides a more comparable assessment of the Group’s 
year on year trading performance.
Adjusted EBITDA for 2019 does not include the expense for 
contracts classified as operating leases under previous 
accounting standards. Under the new accounting standard of 
IFRS 16, leases are capitalised on the balance sheet as right-of-
use assets with depreciation charged to the income statement 
over the assets’ useful economic life. The impact of IFRS 16 on 
Adjusted EBITDA is a £7.4 million benefit due to the reduction  
in operating expenses, see note 8.3 for further information.
Net debt
The Group defines net debt as total borrowings less cash and 
cash equivalents. Total borrowings includes external financial 
debt, such as loan notes, term loans and amounts drawn in  
cash under revolving credit facilities (see note 4.3) but excludes 
other financial liabilities such as lease liabilities calculated in 
accordance with IFRS 16 (see note 3.2), pension obligations  
and trade and other payables.
The Group does not include lease liabilities, calculated in 
accordance with IFRS 16, in the definition of net debt. This 
reflects the nature of the contracts included in this balance 
which were previously not held on the balance sheet and 
disclosed as operating commitments in the Group’s 2018 
Annual Report and Accounts. At 31 December 2019, these 
liabilities had a carrying amount of £32.5 million (see note 3.2). 
The 2018 calculation of net debt includes the amounts payable 
under finance lease liabilities. In 2019, these liabilities have been 
included with lease liabilities under IFRS 16 and therefore 
excluded from the net debt calculation. The carrying amount  
of finance lease liabilities at 31 December 2018 was £0.5 million 
and has therefore not had a material impact on the net debt 
comparison with the previous year.

The consideration of £686.9 million due in respect of the Acquired Generation Business was settled on 2 January 2019. During  
the first half of 2019, the completion statement process in respect of the acquisition has been concluded and the Group made  
a further payment in accordance with the terms of the acquisition of £4.8 million which was settled on 14 May 2019. 
There were no material non-cash transactions in either the current or previous year.
The Group recorded a net loss of £117.6 million (2018: net loss £21.7 million) arising on exceptional items and certain 
remeasurements in the Consolidated income statement in 2019. Acquisition and restructuring costs of £9.0 million (2018: 
£27.7 million) are included in cash generated from operations (see note 4.4) and cash paid in respect of debt restructuring  
of £5.2 million (2018: £2.0 million) in cash used in financing activities. All other exceptional items and remeasurements are  
non-cash and adjusted in the reconciliation shown in note 4.4.

The financial performance section gives further information about the items in the Consolidated income statement. It includes  
a summary of financial performance by each of the Group’s businesses (see note 2.1), analysis of certain income statement items 
(notes 2.2–2.6) and information regarding the Adjusted and Total Results, dividends and distributable profits (notes 2.7–2.10). 
Further commentary on the Group’s trading and operational performance during the year, which is predominantly reflected in 
Adjusted EBITDA, can be found in the Strategic report on pages 1 to 61, with particular reference to key transactions and market 
conditions that have affected the results.
2.1 Segmental reporting
The Group is organised into three businesses, with a dedicated management team for each, and a central corporate office 
providing certain specialist and shared functions. The Group’s businesses, which each represent a reportable operating segment 
for the purpose of segmental reporting, are:
• Generation: power generation activities in the UK;
• Customers: supply of electricity and gas to business customers in the UK; and
• Pellet Production: production of sustainable compressed wood pellets at our processing facilities in the US.
The B2B Energy Supply segment disclosed in 2018 has been renamed Customers, to align more closely with the Group’s strategy. 
Generation includes the financial results of the new generation assets acquired on 31 December 2018 from ScottishPower. 
Information reported to the Board for the purposes of assessing performance and making investment decisions is based on these 
three segments. The measure of profit or loss for each reportable segment presented to the Board on a regular basis is Adjusted 
EBITDA (as defined on page 131).
Operating costs are allocated to segments to the extent they are directly attributable to the activities of that segment. Corporate 
office costs are included within central costs.

The accounting policies applied for the purpose of measuring the segments’ profits or losses, assets and liabilities are the same 
as those used in measuring the corresponding amounts in the Group’s financial statements. The external revenues and results 
of all the reporting segments are subject to seasonality, with higher dispatch and prices in the winter months compared to 
summer months.
Capital expenditure by segment
Assets and working capital are monitored on a consolidated basis; however, spend on capital projects is monitored by operating

Additional assets with a fair value of £689.8 million were acquired on 31 December 2018 as part of the business combination 
described in note 5.1.
Total cash outflows in relation to capital expenditure during the year were £171.4 million (2018: £132.6 million). See the Group 
Financial Review on pages 14-19 for further details about the key capital investments in the year.
Intra-group trading
Intra-group transactions are carried out at management’s best estimate of arm’s-length, commercial terms that, where possible, 
equate to market prices at the time of the transaction. During 2019, the Pellet Production segment sold wood pellets with a total 
value of £229.4 million (2018: £213.7 million) to the Generation segment and the Generation segment sold electricity, gas and ROCs 
with a total value of £1,512.7 million (2018: £1,336.7 million) to the Customers segment.
The impact of all intra-group transactions, including any unrealised profit arising, is eliminated on consolidation.

Major customers
Total consolidated revenue for the year ended 31 December 2019 includes £575.7 million from one individual customer (2018: 
£555.8 million from one individual customer) that represented 10% or more of total revenue for the year. These revenues arose  
in the Generation segment.
2.2 Revenue
Accounting policy
Revenue represents amounts receivable for goods or services provided to customers in the normal course of business, net of trade 
discounts, VAT and other sales-related taxes and excluding transactions between Group companies. Revenue is presented gross  
in the income statement as the Group controls the specified good or service prior to the transfer to the customer.
Revenues from the sale of electricity by the Group’s Generation business are measured based upon metered output delivered at 
rates specified under contract terms or prevailing market rates as applicable. The performance obligations for these contracts  
are satisfied over time and control is deemed to have passed to the customer at the point that the electricity has been supplied. 
The output method is used to recognise revenue, this method recognises revenue based on the value transferred to the customer. 
This is measured based on energy supplied to the customer with the amount billed based on the units of electricity supplied.
Three biomass-fuelled generating units at Drax Power Station and certain generators across the Hydro-electric plants earn 
Renewable Obligation Certificates (ROCs) under the UK Government’s Renewables Obligation (RO) regime. The financial benefit  
of a ROC is recognised in the income statement at the point the relevant renewable biomass fuel is burnt and power dispatched  
as a reduction in the cost of the biomass fuel. For Hydro assets this is at the point that the renewable energy is generated.  
A corresponding asset is recognised on the balance sheet (see note 3.4). The performance obligation is satisfied at a point  
in time when the legal title to the ROC is transferred to the third party. This is when revenue from the sale is recognised.
The Group recognises the income or costs arising from the Contract for Difference (CfD) (see below) in the income statement  
as a component of revenue at the point the Group meets its performance obligation under the CfD contract. This is considered  
to be the point at which the relevant generation is delivered and the payment becomes contractually due.
Revenue from the sale of electricity and gas directly to business customers through the Customers business is recognised on  
the supply of electricity or gas when a contract exists, supply has taken place, a quantifiable price has been established or can  
be determined and the receivables are expected to be recovered at the point of sale. Energy supplied is measured based upon 
metered consumption and contractual rates; however, where a supply has taken place but is not yet measured or billed, the 
revenue is estimated based on consumption statistics and selling price estimates and is recognised as accrued income.
Revenue for contracts satisfied over time is recognised in line with the progress of those contracts. The measurement of progress 
is based on cost inputs for fixed price Customers contracts, and volume supplied for other contracts. Assumptions are applied 
consistently but third party costs can be variable, therefore actual outcomes may vary from initial estimates.
The Group is eligible for, and therefore applies, the practical expedient available in IFRS 15 and has not disclosed information 
related to the transaction price allocated to remaining performance obligations. The right to receive consideration from a 
customer is at an amount that corresponds directly with the value to the customer of the Group’s performance completed to date.
Other revenues derived from the provision of services to National Grid (for example, the supply of system support services) are 
recognised by reference to the stage of completion of the contractual performance obligations. Most such contracts are for the 
delivery of a service either continually or on an ad-hoc basis over a period of time and thus stage of completion is calculated by 
reference to the amount of the contract term that has elapsed. Depending on the contract terms this approach may require 
judgement in estimating probable future outcomes.
Other revenues derived from the sale of goods (for example, by-products from electricity generation such as ash and gypsum) 
are recognised at the point the control of the goods is transferred to the customer, typically at the point of delivery to the 
customer’s premises.

2.2 Revenue continued
CfD payments
The Group is party to a CfD with the Low Carbon Contracts Company (LCCC), a Government-owned entity responsible for delivering 
elements of the Government’s Electricity Market Reform Programme. Under the contract, the Group makes or receives payments 
in respect of electricity dispatched from a specific biomass-fuelled generating unit. The payment is calculated by reference to a 
strike price of £100 per MWh. The base year for the strike price was 2012 and it increases each year in line with the UK Consumer 
Price Index and changes in system balancing costs. The strike price at 31 December 2019 was £113.65 per MWh.
When market prices (based on average traded prices in the preceding season) are above/below the strike price, the Group makes/
receives an additional payment to/from LCCC equivalent to the difference between that market power price and the strike price, 
for each MWh produced from the generating unit supported by the CfD. Such payments are in addition to amounts received from 
the sale of the power in the wholesale market and either increase or limit the total income from the power dispatched from the 
relevant generating unit to the strike price in the CfD contract.
ROC sales
The generation and sale of ROCs is a key driver of the Group’s financial performance. The RO scheme places an obligation on 
electricity suppliers to source an increasing proportion of their electricity from renewable sources. Under the RO, ROCs are 
certificates issued to generators of renewable electricity which are then sold to bilateral counterparties, including suppliers,  
to demonstrate that they have fulfilled their obligations under the RO. ROCs are managed in compliance periods (CPs), running 
from April to March annually, CP1 commenced in April 2002. At 31 December 2019 the Group is operating in CP18.
To meet its obligations a supplier can either submit ROCs or pay the “buy-out” price at the end of the CP. The buy-out price was  
set at £30 per ROC in CP1 and rises with the UK Retail Price Index. The buy-out price in CP18 is £48.78. ROCs are typically procured 
in arm’s-length transactions with renewable generators at a market price slightly lower than the buy-out price for that CP. At the 
end of the CP, the amounts collected from suppliers paying the buy-out price form the “recycle fund”, which is distributed on a 
pro-rata basis to suppliers who presented ROCs in a compliance period.
The financial benefit of a ROC recognised in the income statement at the point of generation is thus comprised of two parts: the 
expected value to be obtained in a sale transaction with a third party supplier relating to the buy-out price and the expected value 
of the recycle fund benefit to be received at the end of the CP. During the year, the Group made sales (and related purchases) of 
ROCs to help optimise its working capital position. External sales of ROCs in the table below includes £575.7 million of such sales 
(2018: £555.8 million), with a similar value reflected in cost of sales. See note 3.4 for further details of ROCs generated and sold by 
the Generation businesses and those utilised by the Customers business in the year.

were included in other operating and administrative expenses. Following the adoption of IFRS 16 from 1 January 2019 (see note 
8.3), operating leases that meet the definition of right-of-use assets are capitalised and recognised on the balance sheet with a 
corresponding lease liability. The Group has taken the exemption available under short-term and low value leases. Leases that have 
a term of less than 12 months or the underlying asset is less than £3,500 are expensed to the income statement on a systematic 
basis over the term of the lease. The amounts expensed in relation to short-term and low value leases in 2019 was £0.7 million.

2.4 Review of fixed assets for impairment 
Accounting policy
The Group reviews its fixed assets (or, where appropriate, groups of assets known as cash-generating units (CGUs)) whenever there is 
an indication that an impairment loss may have been suffered. The Group assesses the existence of indicators of impairment annually. 
In respect of the Customers and Pellet Production businesses, the Group considers the smallest groups of assets that generate 
independent cash flows to be equivalent to the operating entities within those businesses – Haven Power, Opus Energy and  
Drax Biomass.
In respect of the Generation business, the Group considers the smallest groups of assets that generate independent cash flows  
to be the individual sites that share common infrastructure and control functions (eight in total).
If an indication of potential impairment exists, the recoverable amount of the asset or CGU in question is assessed with reference 
to the present value of the future cash flows expected to be derived from the continuing use of the asset or CGU (value in use)  
or the expected price that would be received to sell the asset to another market participant (fair value less costs to sell). The initial 
assessment of recoverable amount is normally based on value in use.
Where value in use is calculated, the assessment of future cash flows is based on the most recent approved business plan and 
includes all of the necessary costs expected to be incurred to generate the cash inflows from the CGU’s assets in their current 
state and condition, including an allocation of centrally managed costs. Central costs are only allocated where they are necessary 
for and directly attributable to the CGU’s activities. Future cash flows include, where relevant, contracted cash flows arising from 
the Group’s cash flow hedging activities and as a result the carrying amount of each CGU includes the mark-to-market value of 
those cash flow hedges.
Drax Group plc Annual report and accounts 2019
144
Section 2: Financial performance continued
2.4 Review of fixed assets for impairment continued
The additional value that could be obtained from enhancing or converting the Group’s assets is not reflected, nor the potential 
benefit of any future restructuring or reorganisation. In determining value in use, the estimate of future cash flows is discounted  
to present value using a pre-tax rate reflecting the specific risks attributable to the CGU in question.
If the recoverable amount is less than the current carrying amount in the financial statements, a provision is made to reduce the 
carrying amount of the asset or CGU to the estimated recoverable amount. Impairment losses are recognised immediately in the 
income statement.
Goodwill balances and intangible assets with an indefinite useful economic life are assessed for impairment annually (see note 5.2 
and 5.3).
Assessment of indicators of impairment
A review of the Group’s CGUs did not give rise to any indicators of impairment. Accordingly no detailed impairment calculation  
has been completed for CGUs where no goodwill is allocated (Drax Power, Drax Biomass and the four CCGTs within Generation). 
The review considered the impact on previously calculated headroom of movements in market prices for commodities and 
changes in foreign exchange rates.
Impairment considerations for CGUs where goodwill has previously been allocated are set out in note 5.2.
Separate consideration has been given to the impact on the OCGT development assets, see note 5.3.
During 2019, the Group finalised its assessment of CGUs, and the allocation of goodwill to those CGUs, in respect of the new 
generation assets acquired from ScottishPower on 31 December 2018. See note 5.1 for details.
All impairment reviews conducted in 2019 indicated adequate headroom to conclude that no impairment charges were required. 
Accordingly, no amounts have been charged to the income statement in respect of asset impairment in 2019. (2018: £26.8 million 
asset obsolescence charge in respect of coal-specific assets no longer required following the conversion of a generating unit to 
run on biomass at Drax Power Station).
2.5 Net finance costs
Finance costs reflect expenses incurred in managing the debt structure (such as interest payable on bonds) as well as foreign 
exchange gains and losses, the unwinding of discount on provisions for reinstatement of the Group’s sites at the end of their useful 
lives (see note 5.4) and net interest charged on the Group’s defined benefit pension scheme obligation (see note 6.3) and lease 
liabilities (see note 3.2). These are offset by interest income that the Group generates through efficient use of short-term cash 
surpluses – for example through investment in money market funds.
On 2 January 2019, the Group drew down £550 million from the £725 million acquisition bridge facility to partially fund the 
acquisition of the new generation assets, with the remainder of the consideration funded from the Group’s cash resources.
Deferred financing costs in relation to the acquisition bridge facility of £5.2 million were written off to the income statement. 
Financing costs of £15.5 million in relation to the new facilities have been deferred and are being amortised over the term of  
the facilities. (2018: incremental costs of £3.8 million in relation to new borrowings were deferred and are being amortised at  
the effective interest rate, and £5.2 million in relation to floating rate notes and an early repayment charge of £2.0 million were 
written off).
As described in note 2.7, the £5.2 million of costs associated with the acquisition bridge facility have been excluded from the 
Adjusted Results and are presented as exceptional items in arriving at Total Results. Further information about the Group’s 
financing structure can be found in note 4.3.

Foreign exchange gains and losses in interest arise on the retranslation of non-derivative balances denominated in foreign 
currencies to prevailing rates at the balance sheet date. 
2.6 Current and deferred taxation 
The tax charge includes both current and deferred tax. Current tax is the estimated amount of tax payable on this year’s taxable 
profits (which are adjusted for items upon which the Group is not required to pay tax or, in some cases, for items which are  
not allowable for tax purposes and therefore on which additional tax is required) and adjusted for estimates for previous years. 
Deferred tax is an accounting adjustment which reflects where more or less tax is expected to arise in the future due to 
differences between the accounting and tax rules. This is reflected in differences between the carrying amounts of assets and 
liabilities in the balance sheet and the corresponding tax bases used in the computation of taxable profits. The tax credit reflects 
the estimated effective tax rate on the loss before tax for the Group for the year ended 31 December 2019 and the movement in 
the deferred tax balance in the year, so far as it relates to items recognised in the income statement.
Accounting policy
Current tax, including UK corporation tax and foreign tax, is based on the taxable profit or loss for the year in the relevant 
jurisdiction. Taxable profit or loss differs from profit/loss before tax as reported in the income statement, because it excludes  
items of income or expenditure that are either taxable or deductible in other years or never taxable/deductible. The Group’s liability 
(or asset) for current tax is provided at amounts expected to be paid (or recovered) using the tax rates and laws that have been 
enacted or substantively enacted by the balance sheet date.
Deferred tax is the tax expected to be payable or recoverable on differences between the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities 
in the financial statements and the corresponding tax bases used in the computation of taxable profit. Deferred tax liabilities are 
generally recognised for all taxable temporary differences and deferred tax assets are recognised to the extent that it is probable 
that taxable profits will be available against which deductible temporary differences can be utilised.
Current and deferred tax are recognised in profit or loss, except when they relate to items that are recognised in other 
comprehensive income or directly in equity, in which case the current and deferred tax are recognised in other comprehensive 
income or directly in equity respectively.

2.6 Current and deferred taxation continued
The Group has adopted the research and development expenditure credit regime (RDEC). Under this regime, research and 
development tax credits are accounted for as development grants, and are recorded in operating profit within the income 
statement, with the corresponding receivable being offset against corporation tax payable. 
Significant estimation uncertainty
In accounting for taxation the Group makes assumptions regarding the treatment of items of income and expenditure for tax 
purposes. The Group believes that these assumptions are reasonable, based on prior experience and consultation with advisers. 
Full provision is made for deferred taxation at the rates of tax prevailing at the period end date unless future rates have been 
substantively enacted. Deferred tax assets are recognised where it is considered more likely than not that they will be recovered. 
Where such assets relate to losses incurred by a business unit, particularly one with a history of losses, the Group seeks evidence 
other than its own internal forecasts to support recognition of the related deferred tax asset.

UK corporation tax is the main rate of tax for the Group and is calculated at 19.00% (2018: 19.00%) of the assessable profit or loss 
for the year. Tax for other jurisdictions is calculated at the rates prevailing in the respective jurisdictions.
Deferred tax is calculated at the tax rates that are expected to apply in the period when the liability is settled, or the asset is 
realised based on jurisdictional tax laws and rates that have been enacted or substantively enacted at the balance sheet date.

As a result of the reduction in the US federal tax rates to 21% from 2018, and tax relief now arising to the Group from the UK Patent 
Box regime (see below), in the medium term, the Group anticipates that the underlying effective tax rate will be marginally lower 
than the main rate of corporation tax in the UK. 
Drax Power was granted a patent to protect certain intellectual property it owns and which attaches to the technology developed 
to manage the combustion process in generating electricity from biomass. Under UK tax legislation the Company is entitled to 
apply a lower rate of tax to some of its profits each year which are derived from utilisation of that technology. 
The movements in deferred tax assets and liabilities during each year are shown below.

2.7 Certain remeasurements and exceptional items
The Group reflects its underlying financial results in the Adjusted Results column of the Consolidated income statement. In order 
to provide a clear and consistent view of trading performance, certain remeasurements and exceptional items are presented  
in a separate column. The Group believes that this presentation provides useful information about the financial performance  
of the business and is consistent with the way executive management and the Board assess the performance of the business.
The Group has a framework for the determination of transactions as exceptional. Transactions presented as exceptional are 
approved by the Audit Committee.
In these financial statements, the following transactions have been designated as exceptional items and presented separately:
• Acquisition and restructuring costs associated with the acquisition and on-boarding of Drax Generation Enterprise Limited 
(formerly ScottishPower Generation Limited) (2019 and 2018) into the Group, along with costs associated with the restructuring 
of the Pellet Production and Customers businesses (2018).
• Asset obsolescence charges, which in 2018 related to coal-specific assets associated with the conversion of the fourth unit at 
Drax Power Station to run on biomass fuel.
• Costs incurred as a result of restructuring the Group’s debt in 2019 and 2018, including facility break costs and the acceleration 
of the amortisation of deferred finance costs associated with the redeemed facilities. Interest costs that relate to the acquisition 
bridge facility have been classified as exceptional, as they relate directly to the acquisition described above.
• Certain remeasurements comprise gains or losses on derivative contracts to the extent that those contracts do not qualify  
for hedge accounting, or hedge accounting is not effective, and those gains or losses are either i) unrealised and relate to the 
delivery of commodity contracts in future periods, or ii) are realised in relation to the delivery of commodity contracts in the 
current period. The effect of excluding certain remeasurements from the Adjusted Results is to reflect commodity sales and 
purchases at contracted prices – i.e. at the all-in-hedged amount paid or received in respect of the delivery of the commodity  
in question, to better present the trading performance of the Group in Adjusted Results.

2.8 Earnings per share
Earnings per share (EPS) represents the amount of earnings (post-tax profits) attributable to each ordinary share in issue. Basic 
EPS is calculated by dividing the Group’s earnings (profit after tax in accordance with IFRS) by the weighted average number of 
ordinary shares that were in issue during the year. Diluted EPS demonstrates the impact if all outstanding share options that are 
expected to vest on their future maturity dates (such as those to be issued under employee share schemes – see note 6.2) were 
exercised and treated as ordinary shares as at the balance sheet date.

At the forthcoming Annual General Meeting the Board will recommend to shareholders that a resolution is passed to approve 
payment of a final dividend for the year ended 31 December 2019 of 9.5 pence per share (equivalent to approximately £38 million) 
payable on or before 15 May 2020. The final dividend has not been included as a liability as at 31 December 2019. This would bring 
total dividends payable in respect of the 2019 financial year to £63 million.
The Group has a long-standing capital allocation policy. This policy is based on a commitment to robust financial metrics that 
underpin the Group’s strong credit rating; investment in the core business; paying a sustainable and growing dividend; and 
returning surplus capital to shareholders. The Board is confident that the dividend is sustainable and expects it to grow as the 
implementation of the Group’s strategy generates an increasing proportion of stable earnings and cash flows. In determining the 
rate of growth in dividends the Board will take account of future investment opportunities and the less predictable cash flows from 
the Group’s commodity based businesses.
In future years, if there is a build-up of capital in excess of the Group’s investment needs, the Board will consider the most 
appropriate mechanism to return this to shareholders.

Distributable profits
The capacity of the Group to make dividend payments is primarily determined by the availability of retained distributable profits 
and cash resources.
The Parent Company financial statements set out on pages 209 to 215 of this Annual report, disclose the Parent Company’s 
distributable reserves of £188.2 million. Sufficient reserves are available across the Group as a whole to make future distributions 
in accordance with the Group’s dividend policy for the foreseeable future.
The majority of the Group’s distributable reserves are held in holding and operating subsidiaries. Management actively monitors 
the level of distributable reserves in each company in the Group, ensuring adequate reserves are available for upcoming dividend 
payments and that the Parent Company has access to these reserves.
The immediate cash resources of the Group of £404.1 million are set out in note 4.2 and the recent history of cash generation 
within note 4.4. The majority of these cash resources are held centrally within the Group by Drax Corporate Limited for treasury 
management purposes and are available for funding the working capital and other requirements of the Group.
The Group’s financing facilities (see note 4.3) place certain conditions on the amount of dividend payments to be made in any  
given year. The Group expects to be able to make dividend payments, in line with its policy, within these conditions for the 
foreseeable future.

This section gives further information on the operating assets we use to generate revenue and the short-term liquid assets and 
liabilities, managed during day-to-day operations, that comprise our working capital balances.
3.1 Property, plant and equipment
This note shows the cost, depreciation and net book value of the physical assets controlled by the Group that are used in the 
businesses to generate revenue. The cost of an asset is what was paid to purchase or construct the asset. Depreciation reflects 
the usage of the asset over time and is calculated by taking the cost of the asset, net of any residual value, to the income statement 
evenly over the useful economic life of the asset. An asset’s net book value is its cost less any depreciation (including impairment,  
if required) charged to date.
Accounting policy
Property, plant and equipment are initially measured at cost. Cost comprises the purchase price (after deducting trade discounts 
and rebates), any directly attributable costs of bringing the asset to the location and condition necessary for it to be capable of 
operating in the manner intended by management and the estimate of the present value of the costs of dismantling and removing 
the item and restoring the site. Property, plant and equipment are stated at cost less accumulated depreciation and any provision 
for impairment in value.
The Group construct many of its assets as part of long-term development projects. Assets that are in the course of construction 
are not depreciated until they are ready for use in the way intended.
Depreciation is provided on a straight-line basis to write down assets to their residual value evenly over the estimated useful 
economic lives (UEL) of the assets from the date of acquisition (where relevant, limited to the expected decommissioning date  
of the site where the asset is located – currently expected to be between 2023–2038 for the gas-fired plants, 2039 for Drax Power 
Station and 2067 for the hydro-electric plants (including pumped storage). The gas-fired plants have a range of plant 
decommissioning dates depending on the equipment installed at each site). The table below shows the range of useful lives at the 
date of acquisition and the average remaining useful life at the balance sheet date of the main categories of asset we own in years:

Freehold land held at cost is considered to have an unlimited useful life and is not depreciated.
Electricity generation assets are grouped according to the fuel type of the plant. Certain assets at Drax Power Station are common 
to the whole plant and are shown separately.
Pellet production plant includes the US-based assets of the Group’s Pellet Production segment and the assets at the Daldowie Fuel 
Plant near Glasgow.
Plant spare parts are depreciated over the remaining useful life of the relevant power station or plant.
Costs relating to major inspections, overhauls and upgrades to the power station are included in the asset’s carrying amount or 
recognised as a separate asset, as appropriate, if the recognition criteria are met; namely, when it is probable that future economic 
benefits associated with the item will flow to the Group and the cost of the item can be measured reliably. All other repairs and 
maintenance costs are expensed as incurred.
Estimated useful lives and residual values are reviewed annually, taking into account regulatory change and commercial and 
technological obsolescence, as well as normal wear and tear. Residual values are based on prices prevailing at the balance sheet 
date. Any changes are applied prospectively.

Significant estimation uncertainty
Asset lives are reviewed annually at each balance sheet date. No changes to the useful economic lives of assets have been made as a 
result of the most recent review. Following previous UK Government announcements pertaining to the cessation of coal generation, 
the Group concluded that coal generation will cease during 2025 but that the two existing coal units will be retained for conversion 
to alternative fuels in the period to 2039.
In February 2020, the Government announced its intention to bring forward the closure date for coal by one year to October 2024. 
Subsequently, on 26 February, the Board approved a proposal to accelerate the closure of the Group’s two remaining coal-fired 
generating units at Drax Power Station from 2025 to 2022 (see page 118).
At each balance sheet date the Group reviews its property, plant and equipment to determine whether there is any indication that 
these assets may be impaired. The Group’s accounting policy in respect of impairment, along with details of the impairment review 
conducted during 2019, are set out in note 2.4.
In the two tables below, amounts as at 1 January and 31 December 2018 have been restated to correct a historical currency 
translation error in the application of foreign exchange rates to balances held in subsidiaries with a functional currency other  
than sterling. Previously, these balances have been incorrectly retranslated into the presentational currency of the Group at the  
rate presiding at the date of the transaction. The restated amounts reflect these balances being translated at the closing rate at  
the relevant Balance Sheet date as required by IAS 21. At 31 December 2017 and 31 December 2018 this results in an increase of 
£37.8 million and £55.5 million respectively in the carrying amount of property, plant and equipment compared to the amounts 
previously reported, with a corresponding increase in the translation reserve (see note 8.3). The adjustment does not affect 
previously reported amounts for the income statement, basic or diluted earnings per share, nor cash.
The comparative balances at 31 December 2018 have been restated due to the finalisation of acquisition values in relation to the 
new generation assets acquired from ScottishPower on 31 December 2018 (see note 5.1).

Issues and transfers reflect changes in the categorisation of assets during the period e.g. when an asset under construction is 
complete, it is transferred to the relevant depreciable asset category, or the issue of spare parts for use in repair and maintenance 
projects. When spares are utilised in such projects, the cost of the part is transferred from the property, plant and equipment 
balance and recognised as an expense in the income statement within operating costs.
Total depreciation of £165.9 million per the income statement includes £6.9 million of depreciation and impairment on right-of-use 
assets, see note 3.2

3.1 Property, plant and equipment continued
Post balance sheet event
On 26 February 2020, the Board approved a proposal to accelerate the closure of the Group’s two remaining coal fired generating 
units at Drax Power Station from 2025 to 2022. 
In assessing the financial impact of this decision, the Group will consider the useful lives, residual values and potential impairment 
of certain assets at Drax Power Station. The timing for completing this impairment review is uncertain as the assets remain an 
integral part of the site and a detailed closure plan needs to be finalised. The carrying amount of affected assets was 
approximately £240 million at 31 December 2019. See page 118 for further details.
3.2 Leases
Accounting policy
IFRS 16 determines a control model to distinguish between lease agreements and service contracts on the basis of whether the 
use of an identified asset is controlled by the Group. If the Group is deemed to have control of an identified asset, then a lease is 
recognised on the balance sheet. A right-of-use asset and a corresponding lease liability are recognised.
The right-of-use asset is initially measured at cost and is subsequently measured at cost less accumulated depreciation and 
accumulated impairment losses.
The lease liability is initially measured at the present value of the future lease payments discounted using the discount rate that is 
implicit in the lease. If this discount rate cannot be determined from the agreement, the liability is discounted using an incremental 
borrowing rate. The liability is subsequently adjusted for interest, repayments and other modifications. Lease modifications are 
accounted for as a separate lease where the scope of the lease increases through the right to use one or more underlying assets 
and where the consideration of the lease increases by an amount that is equivalent to the standalone price of the increase in 
scope. Where a modification decreases the scope of the lease, the carrying amount of the right-of-use asset is adjusted and a  
gain or loss is recognised in proportion to the decrease in scope of the lease. All other modifications are accounted for as a 
reassessment of the lease liability with a corresponding adjustment to the right-of-use asset.
Lease extension or termination options are included within the lease term when the Group as the lessee has the discretion  
to exercise the option and where it is probable that the option will be exercised.
Leases with a term shorter than 12 months or where the identified asset has a value below £3,500 are expensed to the income 
statement on a straight-line basis over the adoption of the agreement.
See note 8.3 for further details on the adoption of IFRS 16.

3.4 ROC assets
The Group earn Renewable Obligation Certificate (ROC) assets, which are accredited by the Office for Gas and Electricity Markets 
(Ofgem), as a result of burning sustainable compressed wood pellets to generate electricity at Drax Power Station and generating 
renewable energy at a certain number of the Group’s Hydro-electric plants. This note sets out the value of these assets that the 
Group holds at the year end.
Accounting policy
ROCs are recognised as current assets in the period they are generated and are initially measured at fair value based on anticipated 
sales prices. The value of ROCs earned is recognised in the income statement as a reduction to costs of sales in that period.
Where the Customers business incurs an obligation to deliver ROCs to Ofgem, that obligation is provided for in the period incurred.
At each reporting date the Group reviews the carrying value of ROC assets held against updated anticipated sales prices. Where 
relevant, this takes account of agreed forward sale contracts and the likely utilisation of ROCs generated to settle the Group’s own 
ROC obligations. Any impairment is recognised in the period incurred.
The fair values and net realisable values of ROCs referred to above are calculated based on assumptions regarding future sales 
prices in the market, taking into account agreed forward sale contracts where appropriate. Historical experience indicates that  
the assumptions used in the valuation are reasonable; however, actual sales prices may differ from those assumed.
ROC valuations are comprised of two parts: the expected value to be obtained in a sale transaction with a third-party supplier 
relating to the buy-out price and an estimate of the future benefit that may be obtained from the ROC recycle fund at the end of the 
compliance period. The recycle fund provides a benefit where supplier buy-out charges (incurred by suppliers who do not procure 
sufficient ROCs to satisfy their obligations) are paid over to suppliers who presented ROCs in a compliance period on a pro-rata 
basis. The estimate is based on assumptions about likely levels of renewable generation and supply over the compliance period and 
is thus subject to some uncertainty. The Group utilises external sources of information in addition to its own forecasts in making 
these estimates. Past experience indicates that the values arrived at are reasonable, but they remain subject to possible variation.

3.5 Inventories
The Group hold stocks of fuels and other consumable items that are used in the process of generating electricity and raw materials 
used in the production of compressed wood pellets. This note shows the cost of coal, biomass, other fuels and plant consumables 
held at the end of the year at Drax Power Station, the Group’s facilities in the US and off-site locations. The Hydro and CCGT plants 
hold inventory of spare part consumables.
Accounting policy
The Group’s raw materials and fuel stocks are valued at the lower of the weighted average cost to purchase and net realisable value.
The cost of fuel stocks includes all direct costs and overheads incurred in bringing the fuel to its present location and condition, 
including the purchase price, import duties and other taxes (including amounts levied on coal under the UK carbon price support 
mechanism) and transport/handling costs. The Group uses forward foreign currency exchange contracts to hedge the costs 
denominated in foreign currencies. Where these contracts are designated into hedge relationships in accordance with IFRS 9,  
the stock cost is recognised at the hedged value and all such gains and losses are included in cost of sales when they arise.
Both coal and biomass stocks are weighed when entering, moving within or exiting the Group’s sites using technology regularly 
calibrated to industry standards. Fuel burn in the electricity generation process is calculated using a combination of weights and 
thermal efficiency calculations to provide closing stock volumes. Both calibrated weighers and efficiency calculations are subject to 
a range of tolerable error. All fuel inventories are subject to regular surveys to ensure these measurements are sufficiently accurate.
Coal stocks are verified by an independent stock survey carried out by a suitably trained specialist and a provision is made where 
the survey indicates a lower level of stock than indicated by the methods described above. Despite being an independent process, 
the survey depends on estimates and assumptions and as a result actual values may differ.
The characteristics of biomass require specialist handling and storage. Biomass at Drax Power Station is stored in sealed domes 
with a carefully controlled atmosphere for fire prevention purposes and thus cannot be surveyed using traditional methods. 
Biomass stock is surveyed using regularly calibrated RADAR scanning technology.

million) of work in progress in the Pellet Production business.
The cost of inventories recognised as an expense in the year ended 31 December 2019 was £1,182.8 million (2018: £1,601.1 million). 
The value of write downs of inventory in the year was £nil (2018: £nil).
Post balance sheet event
On 26 February 2020, the Board approved a proposal to accelerate the closure of the Group’s two remaining coal fired generating 
units at Drax Power Station from 2025 to 2022. 
The carrying amount of coal inventory was £103.1 million at 31 December 2019, the Group expects to recover this value in full over 
the period to closure. See page 118 for further details.

3.6 Trade and other receivables
Trade receivables represent amounts owed by customers for goods or services provided but not yet been paid for. Accrued income 
represents income earned in the period but not yet invoiced, largely in respect of power delivered that will be invoiced the following 
month.
Accounting policy
Trade and other receivables are initially measured at transaction price and subsequently measured at amortised cost.
The Group has access to receivables monetisation facilities under which trade receivables can be sold to a third party on a 
non-recourse basis. Receivables sold under such facilities are derecognised at the point of sale. Fees are recognised in the income 
statement as incurred.

Trade receivables and accrued income principally represent sales of energy to counterparties within both the Generation and 
Customers businesses. At 31 December 2019, the Group had amounts receivable from two significant counterparties representing 
18% of total trade receivables and accrued income (2018: two significant counterparties representing 12% of total trade receivables 
and accrued income).
The comparative balances at 31 December 2018 have been restated due to the finalisation of acquisition values in relation to the 
new generation assets acquired from ScottishPower on 31 December 2018 (see note 5.1).
Of total trade receivables and accrued income at 31 December 2019 £275.0 million (2018: £266.6 million) relates to Customers sales.
Contract assets relate to amounts for goods or services provided under customer contracts, where the entitlement to 
consideration is contingent on something other than the passage of time. The Group has recognised a contract asset for any work 
performed where payment is not yet due. Any amount previously recognised as a contract asset is reclassified to trade receivables 
at the point at which it is invoiced to the customer, usually in the following financial period. The reconciliation from opening to 
closing contract assets is as follows:

Impairment of financial assets
Accounting policy
The provision for impairment of trade receivables and contract assets is measured at an amount equal to the lifetime expected 
credit loss. The contract assets relate to amounts for goods or services provided under customer contracts and have substantially 
the same risk characteristics as the trade receivables for the same types of contracts. 
The greatest concentration of credit risk exists in the Customers business. During 2019, the Group implemented a new machine 
learning algorithm to calculate expected credit losses in this business. The algorithm predicts the future performance of a debt on an 
individual account basis using a broad range of internal and external indicators to assess the likelihood of the debt becoming more 
than 365 days past due and subsequently defaulting. The Group considers default to be when a customer is in breach of their terms.
Drax Group plc Annual report and accounts 2019
160
3.6 Trade and other receivables continued
The new method provides in full for debt where the debt is more likely than not (i.e. more than 50% probability) to become both 
aged over 365 days and then subsequently default. The Group considers that the overall provision applied from this method and 
other overlay assumptions is adequate to reflect the risk of default across the whole portfolio. The Group defines customers that 
have a combined probability of less than 25% as low credit risk.
Other Customers balances are grouped according to the age of the debt based on a number of days past due. The provision rates 
remaining are based on historical collection rates and expectation of future cash collection rates.
12-month expected credit losses are calculated for other financial assets by taking the Groups’ exposure at the balance sheet date 
multiplied by a 12-month provision rate. 
The Group writes off a financial asset when there is no realistic prospect of recovery and all attempts to recover the balance  
have been exhausted. The net charge to the income statement in the current year for impairment losses on financial assets was 
£18.0 million (2018: £31.4 million), this includes a £6.1m benefit in the period in respect of resolution of legacy credit balances.
The movement in the allowance for doubtful debts is laid out in the following table:

The expected credit loss provision above relates wholly to trade receivables and contract assets. The expected credit loss provision 
calculated for other financial assets of the Group was negligible.
The provision above principally relates to trade receivables and contract assets in the Customers business. The risk of default 
within the Generation and Pellet Production businesses is considered to be extremely low and the calculated provision is negligible, 
this is supported by strong historic collection rates and timely receipts.
Credit and counterparty risk are disclosed in further detail in note 7.2.

The expected credit loss rate is a weighted average for the portfolio of the remaining trade receivables and contract assets 
associated with the Customers business.
Balances not yet due include contract asset balances. The majority of balances not yet due are held in the Generation business 
where the risk of default is considered to be extremely low and immaterial to provide for, this is supported by strong historic 
collection rates and timely receipts.

3.7 Contract costs
The Group incurs costs of obtaining contracts in the Customers business.
Accounting policy
Management expects that incremental broker fees paid to intermediaries as a result of obtaining electricity and gas contracts are 
recoverable. The Group has therefore capitalised them as contract costs at the point the fee is paid. The fees are amortised on a 
straight line basis over the contract period in line with the recognition of revenue. The balance is included within prepayments in 
note 3.6. This amount includes both current and non-current balances. The reconciliation from opening to closing contract costs  
is as follows, there was no impairment loss recognised:

3.8 Trade and other payables
Trade and other payables represent amounts the Group owe to its suppliers (for trade purchases and ongoing costs), tax authorities 
and other creditors that are due to be paid in the ordinary course of business. The Group make accruals for amounts that will fall due 
for payment in the future as a result of the Group’s activities in the current year (e.g. fuel received but for which the Group has not yet 
been invoiced).
Accounting policy
Trade and other payables are measured at amortised cost.
The Group facilitates a supply chain finance scheme, a form of reverse factoring under which certain suppliers can obtain early 
access to funding. There are no changes to the Group’s payment terms under this arrangement, nor would they be if the 
arrangement was to fall away, and the amount due is recognised in trade payables.
The Group also has access to payment facilities, utilised to leverage scale and efficiencies in transaction processing. Under these 
facilities the Group benefits from a short extension to payment terms, within a normal working capital cycle, for a small fee. The 
original liability is derecognised and the amount due to the facility provider is recognised in other payables. Fees are recognised  
in the income statement in the period incurred.
The Group does not include trade and other payables in its calculation of net debt, see note 4.1.

Trade payables includes £33.1 million (2018: £2.2 million) related to reverse factoring. Other payables include £90.6 million  
(2018: £87.0 million) due under other payment facilities.
Other payables include £55.0 million of ROC sales made in the period which the Group have not yet been accredited for. Once the 
ROCs have been accredited and transferred to the other party, this amount will be released from other payables and recognised  
in the income statement.
Energy supply accruals include £250.0 million (2018: £235.5 million) in relation to the Group’s obligation to deliver ROCs arising  
from Customers activities. The remaining balance principally comprises third party grid charge accruals of £42.8 million  
(2018: £51.7 million) and Feed-in-Tariff accruals of £30.4 million (2018: £14.1 million).
The Group recognises a liability in respect of its unsettled obligations to deliver emissions allowances under the EU Emission 
Trading Scheme (ETS). Accruals at 31 December 2019 include £25.5 million (2018: £nil) with respect to the Group’s estimated  
net liability to deliver CO2 emissions allowances. Allowances are purchased in the market and are recorded at cost.
Other payables at 31 December 2018 have been restated due to the finalisation of acquisition values of the liabilities acquired  
in the acquisition of the new generation assets on 31 December 2018. (See note 5.1).
Contract liabilities primarily relate to the advance consideration received from customers for fixed price electricity and gas 
contracts, for which revenue is recognised based on the stage of completion of the multi-year contract. The balance reduces  
as revenue is subsequently recognised in the following period, offset by further advance consideration received. The reconciliation

Section 4: Financing and capital structure
This section provides further information about the Group’s capital structure (equity and debt financing) and cash generated from 
operations during the year.
4.1 Reconciliation of net debt
Net debt is calculated by taking the Group’s borrowings (note 4.3) and subtracting cash and cash equivalents (note 4.2). The table 
below reconciles net debt in terms of changes in these balances across the year.

(319.1)
Borrowings include listed bonds, bank debt and revolving credit facilities, net of any deferred finance costs. Borrowings do not 
include other financial liabilities such as IFRS 16 lease liabilities, pension obligations and trade and other payables. Whilst the 
definition of net debt is unchanged from previous periods, following the adoption of IFRS 16 as of 1 January 2019, finance leases  
no longer form part of borrowings and have been subsumed into the larger lease liability calculated in accordance with IFRS 16. 
The carrying amount of finance lease liabilities at 31 December 2018 was £0.5 million.
The Group does not include lease liabilities, calculated in accordance with IFRS 16, in the definition of net debt. This reflects  
the nature of the contracts included in this balance, which were predominantly classified as operating leases under the old lease 
standard (IAS 17 and IFRIC 4). These leases were therefore previously not held on the balance sheet, but were disclosed as 
operating commitments in the Group’s 2018 Annual Report and Accounts. At 31 December 2019, these liabilities had a carrying 
amount of £32.5 million (see note 3.2).
A reconciliation of the increase in borrowings during the year is set out in the table on page 165.
The Group has entered into cross-currency interest rate swaps, fixing the sterling value of the principal repayments in respect  
of the Group’s US dollar denominated debt (see note 4.3). If US dollar balances are translated at the hedged rate, rather than the 
rate prevailing at the balance sheet date, the carrying amount of the Group’s borrowings would be reduced by £12.2 million (2018: 
reduced by £22.0 million). The corresponding value of the hedging instrument is recognised at its fair value as a derivative financial 
instrument, (note 7.2).
4.2 Cash and cash equivalents
Cash and cash equivalents include cash held in current and other deposit accounts that is accessible on demand. It is the Group’s 
policy to invest available cash on hand in short-term, low-risk bank accounts or deposit accounts.

4.3 Borrowings
Accounting policy
The Group measures all debt instruments (whether financial assets or financial liabilities) initially at fair value, which equates to  
the principal value of the consideration paid or received. Subsequent to initial measurement, debt instruments are measured at 
amortised cost using the effective interest method. Transaction costs (any such costs incremental and directly attributable to  
the issue of the financial instrument) are included in the calculation of the effective interest rate and are amortised over the life  
of the instrument.
Fees paid on the establishment of loan facilities are recognised as transaction costs of the loan to the extent that it is probable 
that some or all of the facility will be drawn down. Where this is the case, the fee is deferred until the draw-down occurs.
Debt instruments denominated in foreign currencies are revalued using period end exchange rates, with any exchange gains and 
losses arising recognised as a component of net interest charges in the period they arise. The Group hedges foreign currency risk  
in accordance with the policy set out in note 7.2. Where hedging instruments are used to fix cash flows associated with debt 
instruments, the debt instrument and the hedging instrument are measured and presented separately on the balance sheet.

On 2 January 2019, the Group drew down £550 million from the £725 million acquisition bridge facility to partially fund the 
acquisition of the new generation assets, with the remainder of the consideration funded from the Group’s cash resources. The 
acquisition bridge facility was fully refinanced in the year, ahead of its scheduled maturity in the second half of 2020, as described 
below.
On 16 May 2019, the Group issued an additional US $200 million of the existing 2025 6.625% USD loan notes. The proceeds from 
the issuance were used to repay £150 million of the drawn down acquisition bridge facility. The notes were issued at 101.5% of their 
nominal value which, when swapped back into sterling, achieved an interest rate of 4.74%.
On 24 July 2019, the Group successfully concluded the refinancing of the remaining £400 million drawn acquisition bridge facility. 
Two new facilities totalling £500 million were agreed with effective rates substantially inside Drax’s current cost of debt; a 
£375 million UK infrastructure private placement with maturities extending out to between 2024–2029 and a £125 million 
environment, social & governance or “ESG” facility. A proportion of the interest rate on the £125 million ESG facility is variable,  
based on the Group’s total carbon dioxide emissions per GWh of electricity generation.
The Group’s financing structure also includes £350 million 4.25% fixed rate loan notes, US $300 million loan notes with a fixed 
interest rate of 6.625%, which was swapped back to sterling upon issuance at an effective interest rate of 5%, and a £350 million 
facility comprised of Revolving Credit Facility (RCF) with a value of £315 million and an index-linked term loan of £35 million.  
The RCF matures in April 2021, with an option to extend by one year. See note 7.2 for further details.
Following the adoption of IFRS 16 (see note 8.3), finance leases have been reclassified to lease liabilities. Prior years have not been 
restated.
The Group has cross-currency interest rate swaps in place (see note 7.1) to hedge the sterling cash flows associated with the  
USD loan notes. In addition to fixing the sterling value of interest payments over a five year period, this instrument fixes the sterling 
repayment of the principal at £367.5 million in 2023, the impact of which would reduce borrowings by £12.2 million.

(1) Certain remeasurements of derivative contracts includes the effect of non-cash unrealised gains and losses recognised in the income statement and cash realised from 
derivative contracts designated into hedge relationships under IFRS 9, where the gain or loss is held in the hedge reserve pending release to the income statement in the period 
the hedged transaction occurs.
The Group has a strong focus on cash flow discipline and uses various methods to manage liquidity. When compared to the year 
end position, these methods have been utilised to a broadly consistent level throughout the year unless otherwise stated. The 
impact of these actions on the cash flows of the Group is described below.
Cash from ROCs is typically realised several months after the ROC is earned; however, through standard ROC sales and ROC 
purchase arrangements we are able to accelerate cash flows over a proportion of these assets. The net impact of ROC purchases 
and ROC sales on operating cash flows was a £131.2 million inflow (2018: £10.5 million outflow), reflected as a decrease (2018: 
increase) in ROC assets in the table above. The level of ROCs generated, purchased and sold during the period is set out in note 3.4. 
The Group also has access to facilities enabling it to sell ROC trade receivables on a non-recourse basis. These facilities were 
utilised during the year but no amounts remained outstanding at 31 December (2018: £nil).
From time to time, where market conditions change, the Group can rebase foreign currency contracts (including cross-currency 
interest rate swaps). In 2019 this generated a working capital benefit, which is reflected as an adjustment to derivative 
remeasurements in the table above. The total cash benefit released from related trades that remained outstanding at 31 December 
2019 was £106.8 million (2018: £2.9 million). This cash benefit includes £84.3 million (2018: £2.9 million) released from foreign 
currency contracts and £22.5 million (2018: £nil) from cross-currency interest rate swaps.

The Customers business has access to a facility which enables it to accelerate cash flows associated with trade receivables on a 
non-recourse basis, which generated a net cash inflow of £12.8 million in the year ended 31 December 2019, reflected as a reduction 
in receivables in the table above (2018: £24.4 million). The facility terms were amended in the year, increasing the facility size to 
£200 million from £150 million in 2018. Utilisation of the facility was £162.2 million at 31 December 2019 (2018: £149.4 million).
The Group has sought to normalise payments across its supplier base resulting in certain suppliers extending payment terms and 
some reducing terms. Suppliers are able to access a supply chain finance facility provided by a bank, for which funds can be 
accelerated in advance of the normal payment terms. The facility does not affect the Group’s working capital, as payment terms 
remain unaltered with the Group. At 31 December 2019, the Group had trade payables of £33.1 million (2018: £2.2 million) related  
to reverse factoring. The Group also has access to a number of payment facilities to leverage scale and efficiencies in transaction 
processing, whilst providing a working capital benefit for the Group due to a short extension of payment terms within a normal 
working capital cycle. The amount outstanding under these facilities at 31 December 2019 was £90.6 million (2018: £87.0 million).

Ordinary shares are classified as equity as evidenced by their residual interest in the assets of the Company after deducting its 
liabilities. Incremental costs directly attributable to the issue of new shares or options are shown in equity as a deduction, net  
of tax, from the proceeds.

The capital redemption reserve arose when the Group completed a share buy-back programme in 2007.
Exchange differences relating to the translation of the net assets of the Group’s US-based subsidiaries from their functional currency 
(US dollar) into sterling for presentation in these consolidated financial statements are recognised in the translation reserve.
The share premium and the merger reserve arose on the financial restructuring of the Group which took place in 2005. Movements 
in the share premium reserve reflect amounts received on the issue of shares under employee share schemes.
Movements in the hedge reserve and the cost of hedging reserve, which reflect the change in fair value of derivative financial 
instruments designated into hedge accounting relationships in accordance with IFRS 9, are set out in notes 7.4 and 7.5.

Section 5: Other assets and liabilities
This section provides information on the assets and liabilities in the Consolidated balance sheet that are not covered in other 
sections, including goodwill, other intangible assets and provisions.
5.1 Acquisitions
Accounting policy
Acquisitions of businesses are recognised at the point the Group obtains control of the target (the acquisition date). The 
consideration transferred, the identifiable assets acquired and liabilities assumed are measured at their fair value on the 
acquisition date. The assets and liabilities are recognised in the Consolidated balance sheet and the revenues and profit or loss  
of the acquired business are recognised in the Consolidated income statement from the acquisition date. Acquisition-related  
costs are recognised in the income statement in the period the acquisition occurs as an exceptional item. Goodwill is measured  
as the excess of the fair value of the consideration transferred over the fair value of the identifiable net assets acquired.
Acquisition of Drax Generation Enterprise Limited (formerly ScottishPower Generation Limited)
There were no acquisitions during 2019; however, the Group has updated the fair value of assets and liabilities acquired in respect 
of the acquisition of ScottishPower Generation Limited, which completed on 31 December 2018 (See pages 148-149 of the 2018 
Annual Report and Accounts for further details).
ScottishPower Generation Limited was renamed Drax Generation Enterprise Limited on 9 January 2019.
Measurement period adjustments
The fair value of the assets and liabilities acquired has been adjusted to reflect the following:
• The conclusion of the completion statement process in respect of the acquisition. This process resulted in changes to the values 
of financial assets and liabilities as estimated amounts were confirmed subsequent to the acquisition date. As a result, the Group 
made a further payment in accordance with the terms of the acquisition of £4.8 million, increased the fair value of the net assets 
acquired by £2.5 million, and recognised a corresponding increase in goodwill of £2.3 million.
• Finalisation of the terms of the defined benefit pension scheme transfer (see note 6.3). This resulted in a reduction in the net 
opening surplus recognised by £1.1 million, with a corresponding increase to goodwill.
• The finalisation of the Group’s assessment of cash-generating units and their fair values resulted in a net £0.2 million reduction  
in property, plant and equipment values. 
As a result of these changes, total goodwill recognised in respect of the acquisition has increased by £3.5 million, to £78.3 million.
The balance sheet as at 31 December 2018 has been restated. The additional consideration was paid in cash on 14 May 2019.
The acquisition was subject to a risk-sharing agreement in respect of 2019 UK Capacity Market payments. Following the 
reinstatement of the UK Capacity Market on 25 October 2019, and the subsequent receipt of cash in January 2020 in respect  
of backdated Capacity Market payment owed, no further amounts are due under this arrangement.
The updated fair values of the assets and liabilities acquired are set out in the table below:

Goodwill of £78.3 million is largely reflective of the trading and operational opportunities that arise from acquiring a multi-site 
multi-fuel generation portfolio together with the assembled skilled workforce. None of the goodwill is expected to be deductible 
for tax purposes. Intangible assets reflect software previously recognised on the balance sheet of the acquiree.

5.1 Acquisitions continued
Assessment of cash-generating units and allocation of goodwill
The Group has determined that each generation site acquired represents a cash-generating unit for impairment testing purposes.
Goodwill has been allocated to the hydro and pumped storage cash-generating units, Lanark (£11.3 million), Galloway (£40.1 million) 
and Cruachan (£26.9 million).
The Group conducts an annual impairment test for goodwill, as required by IFRS. The acquired goodwill has been tested for the 
first time as at 31 December 2019. See note 5.2.
5.2 Goodwill
Goodwill arises on the acquisition of a business when the consideration paid exceeds the fair value of the identifiable assets 
acquired.
Accounting policy
Goodwill is initially recognised and measured at the acquisition date. Goodwill is not amortised but reviewed for impairment at least 
annually. For the purpose of impairment testing, goodwill is allocated to the CGU to which it relates and the recoverable amount for 
that CGU assessed. The table below shows movements and balances:

The Group recognised £74.8 million of provisional goodwill in respect of the ScottishPower transaction in 2018. In 2019 the 
finalisation of acquisition fair values resulted in changes in the fair values of assets and liabilities acquired of £3.5 million with  
a corresponding increase to goodwill (see note 5.1).
Total goodwill in the Consolidated balance sheet at 31 December 2019 was £248.2 million, with £10.7 million arising on the 
acquisition of Haven Power in 2009 attributed to the Haven Power CGU, £159.2 million arising on the acquisition of Opus Energy in 
2017 attributed to the Opus Energy CGU and £78.3 million arising on the acquisition of Drax Generation Enterprise in 2019 allocated 
to the Lanark (£11.3 million), Galloway (£40.1 million) and Cruachan (£26.9 million) CGUs.
Impairment review
The recoverable amount of the Haven Power and Opus Energy CGUs is measured annually, based on a value-in-use calculation 
using the Group’s established planning model. This model depends on a broad range of assumptions, the most significant of which 
are customer margins and supply volumes. Inherent in these assumptions are expectations about future energy prices and supply 
costs. Cash flows beyond the business plan period are inflated into perpetuity using a growth rate of 1%.
The carrying amount of the Haven Power CGU at 31 December 2019 was £49.9 million. The expected future cash flows of the CGU 
were discounted using a discount rate of 7.5%, calculated based on independent analysis commissioned by the Group, adjusted to 
the specific circumstances and risk factors affecting the Group’s Customers business. The Group believes that this rate reflects 
the prospects for a well-established Customers business. The value-in-use of the Haven Power CGU, including the goodwill, was 
significantly in excess of its carrying amount.
The carrying amount of the Opus Energy CGU at 31 December 2019 was £319.5 million, including intangible assets of £140.0 million. 
Following further integration of Opus Energy into the Group’s existing Customers business during 2019, the discount rate was 
assessed as being in line with that of Haven Power at 7.5%. The value-in-use of the Opus Energy CGU, including the goodwill and 
intangible assets, was significantly in excess of its carrying amount. 
The Group has conducted a sensitivity analysis of the estimates of future cash flows of the Haven Power and Opus Energy CGUs. 
This analysis indicates that any reasonably possible change in the key assumptions, which are customer margins, supply volumes 
and discount rate, would not cause an impairment loss in respect of goodwill.

5.2 Goodwill continued
Goodwill associated with recently acquired generation assets
The Group tested the goodwill associated with the Lanark, Galloway and Cruachan CGUs for the first time at 31 December 2019. 
The recoverable amount of each CGU was calculated based on a value-in-use calculation using the Group’s established planning 
model. The model depends on a broad range of assumptions, the most significant of which are power prices, operating model, 
sources of stability income and the discount rate applied. Cash flows beyond the business plan period are inflated into perpetuity 
using a growth rate of 2%.
The carrying amounts and discount rates applied to each CGU are set out in the table below:

Carrying Amount
Discount Rate
Lanark
56.4
6.6%
Galloway
198.1
6.6%
Cruachan
319.9
6.6%
The discount rates were calculated based on independent analysis commissioned by the Group, adjusted to the specific 
circumstances and risk factors affecting the Group’s Generation business.
The value-in-use of each of the CGUs in the table above, including allocated goodwill, was significantly in excess of its carrying 
amount. 
The Group has conducted a sensitivity analysis of the estimates of future cash flows of the Lanark, Galloway and Cruachan CGUs. 
For the Cruachan CGU, this analysis indicates that any reasonably possible change in the key assumptions would not cause an 
impairment loss in respect of goodwill. For the Lanark and Galloway CGUs, a sustained reduction in long-term power prices in 
excess of 5% or an increase discount rate of 1%, when compared to the assumptions applied in the value in use analysis at 31 
December 2019, would result in a recoverable amount for those CGUs equivalent to their carrying amounts. These sensitivities are 
considered reasonably possible to arise in isolation but do not consider the impact of mitigating actions or compensating changes 
in other assumptions.
5.3 Intangible assets
Intangible assets are not physical in nature but are identifiable and separable from other assets. Intangible assets can be acquired 
in business combinations (such as the acquisition of Opus Energy during 2017) or purchased separately. The Group routinely 
purchases computer software and carbon emissions allowances, which are considered intangible assets.
Accounting policy
Intangibles acquired in business combinations are measured at fair value on the acquisition date. Other intangible assets are 
measured at cost. Cost comprises the purchase price (net of any discount or rebate) and any directly attributable costs to bring  
the asset into the condition and location required for use as intended by management.
Intangible assets are amortised over their anticipated useful lives. Useful lives are reviewed at each balance sheet date. No 
changes to useful lives were made as at 31 December 2019. Amortisation calculations are specific to each category of assets  
and are explained in further detail below.
Carrying amounts are assessed for indicators of impairment at each balance sheet date. The customer-related assets and brand 
are attributed to the Opus Energy CGU and details of the impairment test relating to this CGU are included in note 5.2.

Customer-related assets
Customer-related assets reflect the value of customer contracts acquired on the acquisition of Opus Energy in February 2017, 
which provided the Group with access to a broad customer base with contracted cash flows. The asset valuation of £211 million 
reflected the estimated value of the future cash flows associated with this customer base at the acquisition date and is dependent 
upon estimates of both current and expected future contract margins and assumed customer retention rates. The cash flows have 
been discounted using a pre-tax discount rate of 10.7%. The asset has an estimated useful life of 11 years, calculated based on 
customer churn-rate analysis, and is being amortised on a reducing balance basis to reflect the diminishing rate of contract 
renewals over time.
Opus Energy brand
The Opus Energy brand was acquired as part of the acquisition in February 2017 and valued at £11.3 million on a relief-from-royalty 
method. The brand is being amortised on a straight-line basis over its assumed 10-year useful life.

5.3 Intangible assets continued
Computer software
Additions in the period include those in the ordinary course of business, which principally reflect ongoing investment in business 
systems to support the Customers segment. Software assets are amortised on a straight-line basis over estimated useful lives 
ranging from three to five years.
As at 31 December 2019, computer software assets in the course of construction amounted to £21.1 million (2018: £24.5 million). 
This includes £19.2 million for a billing system where the Group has stopped development and is in ongoing discussions with the 
supplier. No amounts have been provided in respect of these assets as the Group believes that the carrying amount will be 
recovered in full.
Development assets
The development assets arose on the acquisition of four OCGT projects in December 2016 and reflect the value of planning and 
consents. Until operations commence, the assets are considered to have an indefinite life and thus are not amortised and are 
subject to impairment testing at each balance sheet date.
At 31 December 2019, the recoverable amount of the development assets was established using a value-in-use calculation derived 
from the Group’s established planning model. The assessment reflected the Government’s announcement that the Capacity 
Market will be reinstated and incorporated key assumptions related to likely Capacity Market clearing prices, construction costs, 
and the ongoing revenues to be derived from the projects once constructed.
The analysis assumes a Capacity Market clearing price that is higher than recently observed clearing prices, but is supported by 
independent forecasts of future prices. 
The expected future cash flows were discounted using a rate of 7%, which includes an assessment of the level of construction  
and execution risk inherent in the existing assets and quality of revenue if constructed. The analysis indicated a recoverable 
amount in excess of the current carrying amount of the development assets. The analysis is sensitive to the key assumptions 
described above and the discount rate applied. Set out below are the changes in these assumptions that would  
result in a recoverable amount that is less than the carrying amount:
• Increasing the discount rate by approximately 1.2% 
• A reduction in the Capacity Market clearing price achieved of 17%
• An increase in the total construction cost of 12%
• A reduction in system stability revenue streams of 21%
If any of these circumstances were to materialise, individually or in aggregate and without mitigation, the Group may not proceed 
with the projects and the assets currently recognised on the balance sheet may be impaired. In particular, the analysis depends 
upon achieving an acceptable clearing price in future Capacity Market auctions.
Carbon assets
Carbon assets arise on the purchase of CO2 emissions allowances in excess of the amount allocated under the Emissions Trading 
Scheme and required for the current financial year, and are measured at cost, net of any impairment. Given their short tenor, 
carbon assets are not amortised. 
The charge to the income statement, within fuel costs, reflects the cost of emissions allowances required to satisfy the obligation 
for the current year and takes into account generation and market purchases allocated to the current financial year, and to the 
extent further purchases are required, is based on the market price at the balance sheet date.

5.4 Provisions
The Group makes provision for reinstatement to cover the estimated costs of decommissioning and demolishing its generation 
assets and remediating the sites at the end of the useful economic lives of the assets.
Accounting policy
Provisions are recognised when the Group has a present obligation (legal or constructive) as a result of a past event, it is probable 
that the Group will be required to settle that obligation and a reliable estimate can be made of the amount of the obligation.
Specifically, provision is made for the estimated decommissioning costs at the end of the useful economic life of the Group’s 
generating assets, when a legal or constructive obligation arises, on a discounted basis. The amount provided is calculated on a 
site-by-site basis and represents the present value of the expected costs. In view of the uncertainty of assessing the amount of any 
proceeds from the disposal of the assets at the decommissioning date, no reduction in the provision is made for any such proceeds. 
The discount rate used is a risk-free pre-tax rate that reflects the duration of the liability. The average discount rate used across 
the Group’s decommissioning provisions is 1.2% (2018: 1.8%). The use of a risk-free rate reflects the fact that the estimated future 
cash flows have built-in risks specific to the liability. An amount equivalent to the discounted provision is capitalised within 
property, plant and equipment and is depreciated over the useful lives of the related assets. The unwinding of the discount is 
included in interest payable and similar charges.
Other provisions include a small provision in respect of dilapidation provisions for leased offices.

Decommissioning provisions are made in respect of the Group’s thermal generating plants (Drax Power Station and CCGT power 
stations). The decommissioning provision is based on the assumption that the decommissioning and reinstatement will take place 
at the end of the expected useful life of each site (which varies between 2026 and 2039) and has been estimated using existing 
technology at current prices based on independent third-party advice, updated on a triennial basis. The most recent updates took 
place in December 2017 for Drax Power Station, and 2018 for CCGT sites.

6.2 Share-based payments
The Group operates two share option schemes for employees: the Performance Share Plan (PSP) for directors and senior 
executives (which replaced the Bonus Matching Plan (BMP) from 2017) which incorporates the Deferred Share Plan (DSP), and the 
Savings-Related Share Option Plan (SAYE) for all qualifying employees. The Group incurs a non-cash charge in respect of these 
schemes in the income statement, which is set out below along with a detailed description of each scheme and the number of 
options outstanding.
In the year the Group has granted share appreciation rights to employees in the form of “One Drax Awards”. These are cash awards 
that are tracked on the Group share price over the retention period. At the date of the award the employee is granted a number of 
ghost shares which is based on the value of the cash award divided by the Group share price at the date of the grant. At the end of 
the retention period, the employee receives the cash award based on the share price at the date of redemption.
Accounting policy
The PSP, BMP, DSP and SAYE share-based payments are equity settled. Equity-settled share-based payments are measured at the 
fair value of the equity instrument at the date of grant and are recognised in the income statement on a straight-line basis over the 
relevant vesting period, based on an estimate of the shares that will ultimately vest as a result of the effect of non-market-based 
vesting conditions, which is revised at each balance sheet date.

Performance Share Plan (PSP)
The PSP was introduced for directors and senior executives to replace the BMP from 2017. Under the PSP, annual awards of 
performance and service-related shares are made for no consideration to executive directors and other senior executives up to a 
maximum of 175% of their annual bonus. Vesting of a proportion of shares is conditional upon whether the Group’s Total 
Shareholder Return (TSR) matches or outperforms an index (determined in accordance with the scheme rules) over three years 
and vesting of a proportion of shares is conditional upon performance against the internal balanced corporate scorecard. Of the 
PSP options granted in 2019, 50% will vest conditional on Group TSR relative to the TSR of a comparator group of companies, with 
the remaining 50% vesting conditional upon the internal balanced corporate scorecard.
The fair value of the 2019 PSP awards of £2.7 million (2018: £2.5 million) is being charged to the income statement on a straight-line 
basis over the three-year vesting period. The fair value of PSP awards is calculated using a Monte-Carlo valuation model, which 
takes into account the estimated probability of different levels of vesting. The key inputs to the valuation model for the 2019 
awards are the share price at the grant date of 378 pence (2018: 272 pence), expected volatility of 35% (2018: 41%), and risk-free 
interest rate of 0.98% (2018: 0.83%).

Deferred Share Plan (DSP)
In addition, the Group operates the DSP, which was introduced as a vehicle for deferring 35% of the annual bonus of executive 
directors and senior leadership team. DSP awards are granted at nil cost and vest after three years subject to continued 
employment or “good leaver” termination provisions. The share price on the grant date of DSP awards made in 2019 was 378 pence 
(2018: 272 pence) and the fair value of these awards of £1.9 million (2018: £0.4 million) is being charged to the income statement on 
a straight-line basis over the three-year vesting period.
The fair value of DSP awards is calculated using a Monte-Carlo valuation model, which takes into account the estimated probability 
of different levels of vesting. The key inputs to the valuation model for the 2019 awards are the share price at date of grant, 
expected volatility of 35% (2018: 41%), and risk-free interest rate of 0.98% (2018: 0.83%).

100% of the DSP options granted in 2019 will vest in three years.
Bonus Matching Plan (BMP)
Under the BMP, annual awards of performance and service-related shares were made for no consideration to executive directors 
and other senior executives up to a maximum of 150% of their annual bonus up until 2016. The BMP was replaced in 2017 by the 
PSP. For awards prior to 2017, a proportion of the shares vesting under the BMP are conditional upon whether the Group’s Total 
Shareholder Return (TSR) matches or outperforms an index (determined in accordance with the scheme rules) over three years 
and a proportion of the shares vesting is conditional upon performance against the internal balanced corporate scorecard. The fair 
value of the 2017 BMP awards, £0.6 million, are being charged to the income statement on a straight-line basis over the 
corresponding three-year vesting period. The 2016 BMP awards have been fully expensed at the year end.
The fair value of BMP awards is calculated using a Monte-Carlo valuation model, which takes into account the estimated 
probability of different levels of vesting. No BMP awards were made in 2019.

Savings-Related Share Option Plan (SAYE)
In March 2019, participation in the SAYE plan was offered again to all qualifying employees. Options were granted for employees to 
acquire shares at a price of 298 pence (2018: 211 pence), representing a discount of 20% to the prevailing market price determined 
in accordance with the scheme rules. The options are exercisable at the end of three or five-year savings contracts. The fair value 
of the options granted in connection with the SAYE plan of £2.8 million (2018: £1.2 million) is being charged to the income

Expected volatility was determined by calculating the historical volatility of the Group’s share price over the previous three and five 
years respectively. The expected life used in the model has been adjusted, based on management’s best estimate, for the effects of 
non-transferability, exercise restrictions and behavioural considerations.
For the SAYE options exercised during the period, the weighted average share price at the date of exercise was 325 pence (2018: 
365 pence).
The weighted average exercise price of SAYE options outstanding at the end of the period was 262 pence (2018: 212 pence).  
The weighted average remaining contractual life was 26 months (2018: 16 months).
The number of options exercisable at the year-end was nil (2018: 2,252).

Accounting policy
Payments to defined contribution schemes are recognised as an expense when employees have rendered services that entitle 
them to the contributions. The income statement charge for the defined contribution scheme represents the contributions due to 
be paid by the Group in respect of the current period.
For the defined benefit pension schemes, the cost of providing benefits is determined using the projected unit credit method, with 
actuarial valuations being carried out at the end of each reporting period. Remeasurement of the obligation, comprising actuarial 
gains and losses, the effect of the asset ceiling (if applicable) and the return on scheme assets (excluding interest), is recognised 
immediately in the balance sheet with a charge or credit to the statement of comprehensive income in the period in which it 
occurs. Defined benefit costs, including current service costs, past service costs and gains and losses on curtailments and 
settlements are recognised in the income statement as part of operating and administrative expenses in the period in which they 
occur. The net interest expense is recognised in finance costs.
Significant estimation uncertainty
Measurement of the defined benefit obligation using the projected unit credit method involves the use of key assumptions, 
including discount rates, inflation rates, salary and pension increases and mortality rates. These actuarial assumptions are 
reviewed annually and modified as appropriate. The Group believes that the assumptions utilised in measuring obligations under 
the scheme are reasonable based on prior experience, market conditions and the advice of pension scheme actuaries. However, 
actual results may differ from such assumptions.
The assumptions applied in 2019 have been prepared on a consistent basis with those in the previous period and in accordance 
with independent actuarial advice received.
Defined contribution schemes
The Group operates four defined contribution schemes for all qualifying employees. Pension costs for the defined contribution 
schemes are as follows:

* 
The surplus for the Drax 2019 Scheme as reported at 31 December 2018 was provisional and has been restated as part of the finalisation of acquisition values (see note 5.1) to 
reflect the actual terms of the transfer agreed during the year, as described below. 
The DPG section of the ESPS and the Drax 2019 scheme are collectively referred to as the Defined Benefit Schemes or the 
Schemes below. At 31 December 2019, application of the accounting assumptions used in relation to the Defined Benefit Schemes, 
which are described in further detail below, continued to result in a position of surplus assets over liabilities. The scheme rules 
allow the Group to benefit from any residual surplus upon winding up of the Schemes. As a result, the surplus has been recognised 
in the balance sheet in full.
The DPG section of the ESPS was closed to new members as of 1 January 2002 unless they had qualified through being existing 
members of another part of the ESPS. Members who joined before this date continue to build up pension benefits as part of the 
scheme. Members are typically entitled to an annual pension on retirement of 1/80th of final pensionable salary for each year of 
service plus a tax-free lump sum of three-times pension.
On 31 December 2018, Drax completed a transaction to acquire assets from ScottishPower. Under the terms of the Sale and 
Purchase Agreement, employees with defined benefit pension rights were also transferred to Drax. The employees have continued 
to participate in the ScottishPower Pension Scheme whilst the Group has been in the process of setting up a new scheme for the 
members to transfer to.
Over the summer of 2019 each transferring member was given the option to either transfer their past service benefits into the Drax 
2019 Scheme or keep their past service in the ScottishPower Pension Scheme. As part of this, 81 members have agreed to transfer 
their past service into the Drax 2019 Defined Benefit Scheme. From 1 January 2020, it is expected that a further 17 members will 
build up future service within the Drax 2019 Scheme.
Under the Drax 2019 Scheme, employees are entitled to retirement benefits based on final salary on attainment of retirement age 
(or earlier withdrawal or death). No other post-retirement benefits are provided. The Scheme is open to future accrual of benefits.
The Schemes expose the Group to actuarial and other risks, the most significant of which are considered to be:
Investment risk
The scheme liabilities are calculated using a discount rate set with reference to corporate bond yields; if 
assets underperform this yield, this will create a deficit. The scheme holds a significant proportion of growth 
assets (diversified growth funds, direct lending and absolute return bonds) which, though expected to 
outperform corporate bonds in the long term, create volatility and risk in the short term. The allocation to 
growth assets is monitored to ensure it remains appropriate given the scheme’s long-term objectives.
Discount rate risk
A decrease in corporate bond yields will increase the value placed upon the scheme’s liabilities, although this 
will be partially offset by an increase in the value of the scheme’s bond holdings.
Longevity risk
The majority of the scheme’s obligations are to provide benefits for the life of the member, so increases in life 
expectancy will result in an increase in the liabilities of the scheme.
Inflation risk
The majority of the scheme’s obligations to pay benefits are linked to inflation and, as such, higher inflation 
will lead to higher liabilities. The majority of the assets held by the scheme are either unaffected by or only 
loosely correlated with inflation, such that an increase in inflation will also increase the deficit. In most cases, 
caps on inflationary increases are in place to protect against extreme inflation. The scheme has a significant 
holding in liability-driven investments and a substantial proportion of this risk is hedged.

6.3 Retirement benefit obligations continued
Other risks include operational risks (such as paying out the wrong benefits), legislative risks (such as the Government increasing 
the burden on pension schemes through new legislation) and other demographic risks (such as making a higher proportion of 
members with dependants eligible to receive pensions from the Group). The Trustees ensure certain benefits are payable on death 
before retirement.
The most recent funding valuation of the DPG ESPS was carried out by Aon Hewitt, a qualified independent actuary, as at 31 March 
2016. The actuarial review at 31 December 2019 is based on the same membership and other data as this funding valuation. The 
scheme board accepted the advice of the actuary and approved the use of these assumptions for the purpose of assessing the 
scheme cost. Future valuations are required by law at intervals of no more than three years.
The results of the latest funding valuation at 31 March 2016 have been adjusted to the balance sheet date, taking into account 
experience over the period since that date, changes in market conditions and differences in financial and demographic 
assumptions. The present value of the defined benefit obligation and the related current service costs were measured using the 
projected unit credit method. Work commenced on a new funding valuation at 31 March 2019, this work is expected to conclude  
in 2020.
The 2019 Scheme is yet to have its first triennial valuation. We understand that the Trustees are planning to prepare the first 
valuation as at 31 March 2020.
The principal assumptions for the Schemes are set out below. Where absolute assumptions differ between the two schemes, 
reflecting differences in the expected duration of the scheme liabilities, a weighted average is shown.

Mortality assumptions are based on recent actual mortality experience of scheme members and allow for expected future 
improvements in mortality rates. The assumptions are that a member aged 60 in 2019 will live, on average, for a further 26 years if 
they are male (2018: 26 years) and for a further 28 years if they are female (2018: 29 years). Life expectancy at age 60 for male and 
female non-pensioners currently aged 45 is assumed to be 27 and 29 years respectively (2018: 27 and 30 years respectively).
The net surplus recognised in the balance sheet in respect of the Schemes is the excess of the fair value of the plan assets over the

million at 31 December 2018.
The actuarial losses of £49.8 million (2018: gains of £23.0 million) reflect losses of £50.3 million arising from changes in financial 
assumptions (2018: gains of £21.8 million) and losses arising from scheme experience of £3.4 million (2018: losses of £0.6 million) 
offset by £3.9 million gains arising from changes in demographic assumptions (2018: gains of £1.8 million).
The losses due to changes in financial assumptions principally reflect the decrease in the present value of the scheme liabilities 
arising as a result of the change in discount rate assumption to 2.1% (2018: 3.0%) following decreases in corporate bond yields.

(3) Other assets include £19.4 million of investments in direct lending, a type of private equity vehicle, which is not quoted in an active market (2018: £15.5 million)
Cash and other assets include £49.5 million (2018: 39.3 million) in relation to the expected transfer of cash from the ScottishPower 
Pension Scheme, which is classed as a receivable at the balance sheet date. Following receipt of the transfer, the Drax 2019 
Scheme intends to adopt an investment strategy of 70% return seeking and 30% liability matching.
The pension plan assets do not include any ordinary shares issued by Drax Group plc or any property occupied by the Group.

The Group is exposed to investment and other experience risks, as described above, and may need to make additional contributions 
where it is estimated that the benefits will not be met from regular contributions and expected investment income.
The DPG ESPS defined benefit obligation includes benefits for current employees of the Group (60%), former employees of the 
Group who are yet to retire (5%) and retired pensioners (35%). The weighted average period over which defined benefit payments 
are expected to be made, or the duration of the scheme liabilities, was assessed at the 31 March 2016 funding valuation to be 20 
years. The Drax 2019 defined benefit obligation includes benefits for current employees of the Group and the duration of the 
scheme liabilities is estimated to be 25 years.
Future contributions
The Group expects to make regular contributions in respect of service costs of £8.1 million to the Schemes during the 12 months 
ended 31 December 2020.
In addition to regular contributions, deficit contributions have been agreed with the Trustees based upon the Technical Provisions as 
at the 31 March 2016 valuation for the DGP section of the ESPS. The Technical Provisions indicate a deficit of £36 million including 
an estimate of the impact of future service costs, which do not meet the definition of a liability at 31 December 2019 for inclusion in 
the financial statements. This valuation has improved since 31 March 2016, in line with the accounting surplus, although this remains 
subject to a recovery plan. A new recovery plan is expected to be agreed in 2020 in relation to the 31 March 2019 valuation, which 
has not yet been finalised.
The Group has agreed to make additional contributions over the period to 31 December 2025 to eliminate the deficit. At this point the 
scheme is expected to be self-sufficient and fully funded, unless material adverse changes in economic conditions arise compared 
to those assumed in the valuation. The Group is confident that the additional contributions are manageable within the Group’s 
business plan. The terms of the Trust Deed allow the Group to recover any surplus once the liabilities of the scheme have been 
settled. Accordingly, the deficit contributions will not give rise to an unrecognised surplus.

The tables below show the carrying amounts and fair values of financial assets and liabilities, including their levels in the fair value 
hierarchy. It does not include fair value information for financial assets and financial liabilities not measured at fair value if the 
carrying amount is a reasonable approximation of fair value. Cash and cash equivalents (note 4.2), trade and other receivables 
(note 3.6) and trade and other payables (note 3.8) generally have a short time to maturity. For this reason, their carrying values, on 
the historical cost basis, approximate to their fair value. The Group’s borrowings relate principally to the publicly traded high-yield 
loan notes and amounts drawn against term loans (note 4.3). These financial liabilities have been measured at amortised cost.

7.1 Financial instruments and their fair values continued
The derivative financial instruments used by the Group and not subject to the own-use exemption have been categorised as follows:
• Commodity contracts – forward contracts for the sale or purchase of a physical commodity which is expected to be settled 
through physical delivery of the commodity.
• Financial contracts – freight and weather-related contracts, as well as contracts for commodities that are not expected to be 
settled through physical delivery of the commodity.
• Forward currency exchange contracts – currency related contracts including forwards, vanilla options and structured option 
products.
• Interest rate swaps – contracts which swap one interest rate for another, including floating-to-fixed single currency instruments 
and cross currency interest rate swaps.
• Inflation rate swaps – swap contracts, such as floating-to-fixed, which are linked to an inflation index such as RPI or CPI.
Fair value measurement
• Commodity contracts fair value – The fair value of open commodity contracts that do not qualify for the own-use exemption  
is calculated by reference to forward market prices at the balance sheet date. Given the maturity profile of these contracts, 
forward market price curves are available for the duration of the contracts.
• Forward foreign currency exchange contracts fair value – The fair value of forward foreign currency exchange contracts  
is determined using forward currency exchange market rates at the balance sheet date.
• Other financial contracts fair value – The fair value of other financial contracts that do not qualify for the own-use exemption,  
is calculated by reference to forward market prices at the balance sheet date. Given the maturity profile of these contracts, 
liquid forward market price curves are available for the duration of the contracts.
The fair values of all derivative financial instruments are discounted to reflect the credit risk inherent within the instrument.
The Group has reviewed all significant contracts for the presence of embedded derivatives. The 2022 fixed rate loan notes and the 
2025 USD loan notes both contain an early repayment option that meets the definition of an embedded derivative. However, in 
both cases, these do not require separate valuation as they are deemed to be closely related to the host contract.
IFRS 13 requires categorisation of the Group’s financial instruments in accordance with the following hierarchy in order to explain 
the basis on which their fair values have been determined:
• Level 1 – Fair value measurements are those derived from quoted prices (unadjusted) in active markets for identical assets or 
liabilities;
• Level 2 – Fair value measurements are those derived from inputs, other than quoted prices included within Level 1, that are 
observable for the asset or liability, either directly (i.e. as prices) or indirectly (i.e. derived from prices); and
• Level 3 – Fair value measurements are those derived from valuation techniques that include inputs for the asset or liability that 
are not based on observable market data (unobservable inputs).
Categorisation within this fair value measurement hierarchy has been determined on the basis of the lowest level input that is 
significant to the fair value measurement of the relevant asset or liability.
The fair value of commodity contracts, financial contracts, interest rate swaps and forward foreign currency exchange contracts 
are largely determined by comparison between forward market prices and the contract price; therefore, these contracts are 
categorised as Level 2.
The fair value of the inflation swaps comprises an RPI and CPI component. Whilst the RPI component is based on observable 
market rates, CPI is based on unobservable rates and therefore deemed to be Level 3 in the fair value hierarchy. However, this 
component is not material to the overall valuation and therefore the instruments as a whole are determined to be Level 2 in line 
with IFRS 13.
Listed equity investment valuations are derived from quoted prices in active markets and are therefore categorised as Level 1.
The valuation technique used for non-listed equity investments comprises of unobservable inputs and are therefore are classified 
as Level 3. However, given the valuations as a whole for Level 3 equity investments are immaterial, it is not deemed necessary to 
include all Level 3 disclosure requirements.
There have been no transfers during the year between Level 1, 2 or 3 category inputs.

Section 7: Risk management continued
7.1 Financial instruments and their fair values continued
Accounting for derivatives
Derivatives (subject to certain exemptions described below) must be measured at fair value, which is in essence the difference 
between the price the Group has secured in the contract, and the price the Group could achieve in the market at that point in time.
Changes in fair value are recognised either within the income statement or the hedge reserve, dependent upon whether the 
contract in question qualifies as an effective hedge under IFRS 9 (see note 7.2).
Where possible, the Group has taken advantage of the own-use exemption which allows qualifying contracts to be excluded from 
fair value mark-to-market accounting. This applies to certain contracts for physical commodities entered into and held for the 
Group’s own purchase, sale or usage requirements, including forward contracts for the purchase of biomass, and coal from 
domestic sources.
Contracts for non-financial assets which do not qualify for the own-use exemption – principally power, gas, financial oil, financial 
coal and CO2 emissions allowances – are accounted for as derivatives in accordance with IFRS 9 and are recorded in the balance 
sheet at fair value. Changes in fair value are reflected through the hedge reserve (note 7.3) to the extent that the contracts are 
designated as effective hedges in accordance with IFRS 9, or the income statement where the hedge accounting requirements are 
not met. To ensure these derivatives are not reflected in the underlying performance of the Group, they are excluded from the 
Adjusted Results in the income statement.
Derivative financial instruments with a maturity date within 12 months from the balance sheet date are classified as current assets 
or liabilities. Instruments with a maturity date beyond 12 months are classified as non-current assets or liabilities.

million (2018:£27.6 million) due to realised gains/(losses) retained in the hedge reserve relating to hedging instruments where the 
hedged item has not impacted the income statement yet, or due to the recycling of gains/(losses) on hedging instruments where 
the hedged item has impacted the income statement, but the hedging instrument has not yet been realised.
The total unrealised gains/(losses) recognised on derivative financial instruments differs from the total movement on derivative 
financial instruments by £106.8 million due to rebasing. The fair value of the rebased trades is recognised on the lower rebased 
rates, resulting in a reduction in the value of derivative financial instruments recognised. However, the gains relating to the cash 
received from rebasing are deferred from Adjusted Results until the contracts mature.

7.2 Financial risk management
The Group’s activities expose it to a variety of financial risks, including commodity price risk, interest rate risk, foreign currency risk, 
liquidity risk, inflation risk, counterparty risk and credit risk. The Group’s overall risk management programme focuses on the 
unpredictability of commodity and financial markets and seeks to manage potential adverse effects on the Group’s financial 
performance.
The Group uses derivative financial instruments to hedge certain risk exposures. Risk management is overseen by the risk 
management committees as explained in the principal risks and uncertainties (page 54 to 61) which identify, evaluate and hedge 
financial risks in close co-ordination with the Group’s trading and treasury functions under policies approved by the Board of 
directors.
7.2.1 Commodity price risk
The Group is exposed to the effect of fluctuations in commodity prices, particularly the price of electricity, gas, the price of coal, 
sustainable wood fibre and pellets, other fuels and the price of CO2 emissions allowances. Price variations and market cycles have 
historically influenced the financial results of the Group and are expected to continue to do so.
Commodity price sensitivity
The sensitivity analysis below has been determined based on the exposure to commodity prices and the impact on profit after tax 
and other components of equity of reasonably possible increases/decreases in commodity prices.

Profit after tax is sensitive to increases/decreases in commodity prices as a result of the impact on the fair value of derivative 
financial instruments not designated as hedging instruments under cash flow hedge accounting. The Group designates certain 
derivatives as hedging instruments under cash flow hedge accounting. As such other components of equity are sensitive to 
increases/decreases in commodity price risk in relation to the impact on the hedge reserve of these movements.
Commodity risk management
The Group has a policy of securing forward power sales, purchases of fuel and CO2 emissions allowances when profitable to do so 
and in line with specified limits under approved policies. Forward power sales can be secured up to 100% of forecast availability 
two years out. All commitments to sell power under fixed price contracts are designated as cash flow hedges as they reduce the 
Group’s cash flow exposure resulting from fluctuations in the price of power.
The Group purchases sustainable biomass, coal and other fuels under either fixed or variable priced contracts with different 
maturities principally from a number of international sources. The Group considers all such contracts to be economic hedges. The 
Group applies the own-use exemption or hedge accounting in accordance with IFRS 9.
Where forward power curves are less liquid, the Group uses financially settled gas sales as a proxy for power to mitigate the risk of 
power price fluctuations. The Group also purchases gas under fixed-price contracts to meet the demand of Customers’ customers 
and the CCGT assets as a fuel for its gas-fired generation portfolio.
The Group purchases CO2 emissions allowances under fixed price contracts with different maturity dates from a range of domestic 
and international sources. All commitments to purchase CO2 emissions allowances under fixed price contracts are designated as 
cash flow hedges as they reduce the Group’s cash flow exposure resulting from fluctuations in the price of CO2 emissions allowances.

Section 7: Risk management continued
7.2 Financial risk management continued
Hedge accounting
The Group’s cash flow hedges relate to commodity contracts (principally commitments to sell power and purchase CO2). Amounts 
are recognised in the hedge reserve as the designated contracts are marked-to-market at each period end for the effective portion 
of the hedge, which is generally 100% of the relevant contract. Amounts held within the hedge reserve are then released as the 
related contract matures and the hedged transaction impacts profit or loss. For power sales contracts, this is at the point when the 
underlying power is delivered.
Included in amounts released from equity are gains and losses on financial instruments that matured in a previous period, released 
to the income statement in the period the hedged transaction occurs. No ineffectiveness was recognised in the income statement 
in the year (2018: £nil). Due to the use of ‘all-in-one’ hedges, this results in the movement in value for the hedged items and hedging 
instruments being identical.
The only source of ineffectiveness regarding the “all-in-one” hedges would be if delivery of the commodities be no longer expected 
to occur. The main sources of ineffectiveness regarding financial contracts could be as a result of timing differences and credit risk.
Commodity contracts are released from equity to revenue (power contracts) or cost of sales (CO2 contracts) in the income statement.
The reconciliation of the reserves and time period when the hedge will affect the profit or loss are disclosed in note 7.3.
The summary of the amounts relating to the hedging instruments and any related ineffectiveness in the period is presented in  
the table below. Ineffectiveness on sale of power hedging instruments is recognised in revenue. Ineffectiveness on designated 
hedging instruments for purchases of CO2 emissions allowances and for financial coal are recognised in cost of sales.
The average forward rates quoted below only reflect the rates applicable to the portion of the Group’s commodity and financial 
contracts that qualify for hedge accounting in accordance with IFRS 9. The rates do not reflect the overall average rate of the 
Group’s total portfolio of commodity and financial contracts that are used to protect the value of future cash flows.

7.2.2 Foreign currency risk
The Group is exposed to the fluctuations in foreign currency rates resulting from committed and forecast transactions in foreign 
currencies, principally in relation to purchases of fuel for use in the Generation business. These purchases are typically denominated 
in US dollars (USD), Canadian dollars (CAD) or Euros (EUR).
The Group also has a limited exposure to translation risk in relation to its net investment in its US subsidiary, Drax Biomass Inc.

Profit after tax is sensitive to the strengthening/weakening of other currencies as a result of the impact on the fair value of currency 
derivative financial instruments not designated as hedging instruments under cash flow hedge accounting. The Group designates 
certain currency derivatives as hedging instruments under cash flow hedge accounting. As such other components of equity are 
sensitive to the strengthening/weakening of other currencies in relation to the impact on the hedge reserve of these movements.
Foreign currency risk management
It is the Group’s policy to hedge material transactional exposures using a variety of derivatives to fix the sterling value of foreign 
currency cash flows, except where there is an economic hedge inherent in the transaction. The Group enters into derivative 
contracts in line with the currency risk management policy, including forwards and options, to manage the risks associated with its 
anticipated foreign currency requirements over a rolling five-year period, covering contracted exposures and a proportion of highly 
probable forecast transactions.
In addition, in order to optimise the cost of funding, the Group has issued foreign currency denominated debt in US dollars (see 
note 4.3). The Group utilises derivative contracts to manage exchange risk on foreign currency debt.
Hedge accounting
The Group designates certain foreign currency derivatives as hedging instruments. Foreign currency forward contracts that are 
designated as hedges are transferred from equity to inventory for hedges of fuel purchases or transferred to intangible assets for 
hedges of carbon EUAs.
Gains and losses on the cross-currency interest rate swaps are released to interest payable and similar charges and foreign 
exchange gains/(losses). Further details of the cross-currency interest rate swaps are provided in the interest rate risk section.
The main sources of ineffectiveness relating to foreign currency hedges are timing differences and credit risk.
The reconciliation of the reserves and when the amount will affect the income statement or will be removed from equity and 
included in the initial cost of the non-financial item are disclosed in notes 7.3 and 7.4.

7.2.3 Interest rate risk
The Group has limited exposure to interest rate risk, principally in relation to cash and cash equivalents and floating rate debt 
instruments. The Group has taken out a fixed-to-fixed cross-currency interest rate swap to hedge the future cash flows associated 
with USD $500 million 2025 fixed rate loan notes, effectively converting them to sterling fixed rate cash flows. The Group has also 
taken out a floating-to-fixed swap to fix the interest payments on the £375 million private placement issued in the year. As the 
Group has fixed most of its debt instruments interest rates swaps, at December 2019 the Group only had one floating rate debt 
instrument drawn, being the £125 million ESG facility issued in the year.
The return generated on the Group’s cash balance, or on amounts drawn on the revolving credit facility, are also exposed to 
movements in short-term interest rates. The Group manages cash balances to protect against adverse changes in rates whilst 
retaining liquidity.
Further information about the Group’s instruments that are exposed to interest rate risk and their repayment schedules is provided 
in note 4.3.

Interest rate benchmark reform
The only interest rate benchmark to which the Group is exposed to within its hedge accounting relationships and that is subject  
to interest rate benchmark reform is GBP LIBOR. This exposure relates to the hedge of the £375 million private placement using  
a floating-to-fixed GBP LIBOR swap maturing in 2024.
The Group is closely monitoring the market and the output from the various industry working groups managing the transition to 
new benchmark interest rates. This includes announcements made by LIBOR regulators (including the Financial Conduct Authority 
(FCA)) regarding the transition away from LIBOR to Sterling Overnight Index Average Rate (SONIA). The FCA has made clear that,  
at the end of 2021, it will no longer seek to persuade, or compel, banks to submit to LIBOR. 
In response to the announcements, The Group will be engaging the following work streams: risk management, tax, treasury, legal 
and accounting. The aim of the programme is to identify any LIBOR exposures that are within the business and prepare and deliver 
on an action plan to enable a smooth transition to alternative benchmark rates. This will involve considering appropriate alternative 
benchmark rates in line with those proposed by different working groups in the industry and engaging with counterparties to 
implement appropriate wording in relevant contracts.
Interest rate sensitivity
The sensitivity analysis below has been determined based on the exposure to interest rates for both derivatives and non-derivative 
instruments at the balance sheet date. For floating rate liabilities, the analysis is prepared assuming the amount of the liability 
outstanding at the balance sheet date was outstanding for the whole year.
The analysis below shows the impact on profit after tax and other components of equity of a reasonably possible increase/
decrease in interest rates. The analysis assumes all other variables were held constant

Profit after tax is sensitive to an increase/decrease in interest rates as a result of the impact on the interest payable in the period 
on any floating rate debt. The Group has reduced its exposure to interest rate risk on variable rate debt through the use of floating-
to-fixed interest rate swaps and therefore a change in interest rates would not have a significant effect on profit after tax. The 
Group designates certain floating-to-fixed interest rate swaps as hedging instruments under cash flow hedge accounting. As such 
other components of equity are sensitive to an increase/decrease in interest rates in relation to the impact on the hedge reserve of 
these movements.
Interest rate risk management
The Group has a risk management policy in place relating to interest rate risk. The Group policy permits, but does not require,  
the use of hedging instruments in order to hedge up to 100% of the Group’s current and forecast interest rate exposure.

7.2 Financial risk management continued
Hedge accounting
The Group designates the floating-to-fixed GBP interest rate swap and the cross-currency interest rate swaps as hedging 
instruments. The GBP interest rate swap is a hedge of the interest payments relating to the £375 million private placement.  
The cross-currency interest swaps are hedges of the interest payments of the $500 million 2025 fixed rate loan notes, and  
of the USD denominated principal. As such there is both an interest element and a foreign exchange element relating to the 
cross-currency interest rate swaps.
Gains and losses on the floating-to-fixed GBP interest rate swap are released to interest payable and similar charges at the same 
time as the interest expense on the hedged borrowings.
Gains and losses on the cross-currency interest rate swaps are released to interest payable and similar charges at the same time  
as the interest expense on the hedged borrowings. Also, gains and losses that are effective at hedging the foreign exchange risk on 
the USD principal are released to foreign exchange gains/(losses) to offset gains and losses on retranslating the USD denominated 
hedged loan notes.
The main sources of ineffectiveness relating to interest rate risk hedges are differences in the critical terms, differences in 
repricing dates and credit risk.
The summary of the amounts relating to the hedging instruments and any related ineffectiveness in the period is presented in  
the table below. Ineffectiveness on GBP interest rate hedging instruments is recognised in interest payable and similar charges. 
Ineffectiveness on USD cross-currency interest rate hedging instruments is recognised in either interest payable and similar 
charges or foreign exchange (losses)/gains.

7.2.4 Inflation risk
The Group is exposed to inflation risk on elements of its revenues and cost base. The Group’s ROC revenues are linked to UK RPI 
and its Contract for Difference revenue is linked to UK CPI. In addition, a proportion of the Group’s fuel costs are linked to US/CAD 
CPI. The Group has entered UK CPI swaps to hedge the future cashflows relating to a proportion of its exposure. The Group also 
benefits from a natural hedge arising from its inflation-linked borrowings (see note 4.3).

The sensitivity analysis below has been determined based on the exposure to inflation rates for both derivatives and non-derivative 
instruments at the balance sheet date.

Inflation risk management
The Group has a risk management policy in place relating to inflation risk. The Group policy permits, but does not require, the use  
of hedging instruments in order to hedge up to 100% of the Group’s current and forecast inflation exposure.
Hedge accounting
As the Group has contracts for which the revenue is contractually linked to either RPI or CPI inflation, the Group has been able  
to designate this risk component as a hedged item. Inflation swaps are utilised as the hedging instrument for this inflation risk.
Gains and losses on the inflation swaps are held in the hedge reserve and reclassified to the income statement within the revenue 
line at the same time the revenue from the inflation linked contracts impacts on the income statement.
The summary of the amounts relating to the hedging instruments and any related ineffectiveness in the period is presented in

7.2.5 Liquidity risk
The Treasury function is responsible for liquidity, funding and settlement management under policies approved by the Board. 
Liquidity needs are monitored using regular forecasting of operational cash flows and financing commitments. The Group 
maintains a mixture of cash and cash equivalents, committed facilities and uncommitted facilities in order to ensure sufficient 
funding for business requirements.
In managing liquidity risk, the Group has the ability to accelerate the cash flows associated with certain working capital items 
(principally those related to ROC sales and Customers power sales). In each case this is undertaken on a non-recourse basis  
and accordingly, the ROCs and other items are derecognised from the balance sheet at the point of sale. The Group also utilises 
standard purchasing facilities to extend the working capital cycle, whilst still paying suppliers on time. The impact on the Group’s 
cash flows is described in note 4.4.
The following tables set out details of the expected contractual maturity of non-derivative financial liabilities. The tables include 
both interest and principal cash flows. To the extent that interest flows are floating rate, the undiscounted amount is derived  
from interest rate curves at the balance sheet date.

Lease liabilities row in the table above is not comparable to the Finance Lease liabilities line in the table below as the Lease liabilities above includes leases that would have been 
classified as operating leases under IAS 17.
Trade and other payables of £683.0 million (2018: £560.5 million) excludes non-financial liabilities such as the Group’s obligation

The following tables set out details of the expected contractual maturity of derivative financial instruments which are marked  
to market based on the undiscounted cash flows. Where the amount payable or receivable is not fixed, the amount disclosed has 
been determined by reference to projected commodity prices, or foreign currency exchange rates, as illustrated by the yield or 
other forward curves existing at the reporting date. Where derivatives are expected to be gross settled the gross cash flows have 
been presented. Commodity contracts and forward foreign currency contracts are expected to be gross settled. Where derivatives 
are expected to be net settled, the net cash flows expected to occur based on the current fair value have been disclosed. Financial 
contracts and other foreign exchange contracts (excluding forwards) are expected to be net settled. Interest rate contracts and 
inflation rate contracts are presented based on net settlement of the interest rate and inflation rate differentials. Gross settlement 
of the principal of cross-currency interest rate swaps is expected and as such this element of the swap is presented gross.

7.2.6 Counterparty risk
As the Group relies on third party suppliers and counterparties for the delivery of currency, sustainable biomass and other goods 
and services, it is exposed to the risk of non-performance by these third-party suppliers. If a large supplier were to fall into financial 
difficulty and/or fail to deliver against its contract with the Group, there would be additional costs associated with securing the lost 
goods or services from other suppliers.
The Group enters into contracts for the sale of electricity to a number of counterparties. The failure of one or more of these 
counterparties to perform their contractual obligations may cause the Group financial distress or increase the risk profile of  
the Group.

Trade and other receivables are stated gross of the provision for doubtful debts of £40.7 million (2018: £44.0 million) and exclude 
non-financial receivables such as prepayments.
Of the Group‘s three operating segments, two are exposed to different levels and concentrations of credit risk, largely reflecting 
the number, size and nature of their respective customers. The Pellet Production segment only trades intra-group.
The highest risk is in the Customers segment, with a high number of customers of varying sizes operating in a variety of markets.  
In particular, Opus Energy carries lower concentrations but higher levels of credit risk owing to a customer base comprised largely 
of smaller retail and commercial entities.
In the Customers segment, credit risk is managed by checking a company’s creditworthiness and financial strength both before 
commencing trade and during the business relationship. Credit risk is monitored and managed by business sector. In addition,  
the Customers segment extended its trade credit insurance programme to increase its mitigation to credit risk.
For the Generation segment, the risk arises from treasury, trading and energy procurement activities, as well as the sale of by-
products from generation activities. Wholesale counterparty credit exposures are monitored by individual counterparty and by 
category of credit rating. Counterparty credit exposures are subject to approved limits. The Group uses master netting agreements 
to reduce credit risk and net settles payments with counterparties where net settlement provisions exist. In addition, the Group 
employs a variety of other methods to mitigate credit risk: margining, various forms of parent company guarantee, deed of charge, 
cash collateral, letters of credit and surety bonds. The majority of the Generation business’s credit risk is with counterparties in 
related energy industries or with financial institutions. In addition, where deemed appropriate, the Group has historically purchased 
credit default swaps.
The investment of surplus cash is undertaken with the objective of ensuring that there is sufficient liquidity at all times, so that 
funds are available to meet liabilities as they fall due, whilst securing a return from invested funds and preserving the capital value 
of those funds within Board-approved policies. These policies manage credit risk exposure by setting out minimum rating 
requirements, maximum investment with any one counterparty and the maturity profile.
Capital management
The Group manages its capital to ensure it is able to continue as a going concern; maintain a strong credit rating underpinned by 
robust financial metrics; invest in its core business and pay a sustainable and growing dividend while maximising the return to 
shareholders through the optimisation of the debt and equity balance. The capital structure of the Group consists of shareholders’ 
equity (excluding the hedge and cost of hedging reserves), plus net debt. Net debt is comprised of borrowings and cash and cash 
equivalents as disclosed in note 4.3 and 4.2 respectively.

7.3 Hedge reserve
The Group designates certain hedging instruments that are used to address commodity price risk, foreign exchange risk,  
interest rate risk and inflation rate risk as cash flow hedges. At the inception of the hedge, the relationship between the hedging 
instrument and hedged item is documented, along with its risk management objectives. Furthermore, at the inception of the hedge 
and on an ongoing basis, the Group documents whether the hedging instruments used in hedging transactions are effective  
in offsetting changes in cash flows of the hedged items. Changes in fair value of contracts designated into such hedging 
relationships are recognised within the hedge reserve to the extent they are effective.
The cumulative gains and losses unwind and are released as the related contracts mature and the Group take delivery of the 
associated commodity or currency.

7.4 Cost of hedging reserve
The Group allocates unrealised gains and losses on the forward rate of foreign currency derivative contracts to a cost of hedging 
reserve in accordance with IFRS 9.
A large proportion of the derivative contracts relate to foreign exchange contracts, including forward contracts, options and 
swaps. Consistent with prior periods, the Group has continued to designate the change in fair value of the spot rate in the Group’s 
cash flow hedge relationships. The Group designates the cost of hedging – being the change in fair value associated with forward 
points including currency basis – to equity. All amounts within the cost of hedging reserve relate to commodity price risk.
The cumulative gains and losses unwind and are released as the related contracts mature and we take delivery of the associated 
currency.

7.5 Offsetting financial assets and financial liabilities
Financial assets and liabilities are offset and the net amount is reported in the balance sheet where the Group has a legally 
enforceable right to offset the recognised amounts, and there is an intention to settle on a net basis or realise the asset and settle 
the liability simultaneously. The Group also has financial asset and liabilities with certain counterparties that are subject to master 
netting agreements. Financial assets and liabilities do not meet the criteria for offsetting in the balance sheet, but are subject to 
an enforceable master netting agreement that in certain circumstances, such as a bankruptcy, would allow for the amounts to be 
offset and a single net amount payable. The table below shows the impact if the carrying amounts that are subject to these 
agreements were offset.

7.6 Contingent assets and liabilities
Contingent liabilities are potential future outflows of cash that are dependent on a future event that is outside of the control  
of the Group. The amount or timing of any payment is uncertain and cannot be measured reliably.
Guarantees
In addition to the amount drawn down against the bank loans, certain members of the Group guarantee the obligations of a 
number of banks in respect of letters of credit issued by those banks to counterparties of the Group. As at 31 December 2019,  
the Group’s contingent liability in respect of letters of credit issued under the revolving credit facility amounted to £77.0 million 
(2018: £31.8 million).
The Group also guarantees obligations in the form of surety bonds with a number of insurers amounting to £96.1 million (2018: 
£63.7 million).
7.7 Commitments
The Group has a number of financial commitments (i.e. a contractual requirement to make a cash payment in the future) that are 
not recorded in the balance sheet as the contract is not yet due for delivery. Such commitments include contracts for the future 
purchase of coal and biomass, contracts for the construction of assets and contracts for the provision of services.

Commitments to purchase fuel reflect long-term forward purchase contracts with a variety of international suppliers, primarily for 
the delivery of sustainable wood pellets for use in electricity production at Drax Power Station over the period from 2019–2027 and 
the delivery of gas to be used in the Gas-thermal plants. To the extent these contracts relate to the purchase of wood pellets, they 
are not reflected elsewhere in the financial statements owing to application of the “own-use” exemption from fair value accounting 
to such contracts (see note 7.1).

Financial statements
This section details reference information relevant to the compiling of the financial statements and provides the general 
information about the Group (e.g. operations and registered office). The Group also set out the basis of preparation of the accounts 
and general accounting policies that are not specific to any one note.
8.1 General information
Drax Group plc (the Company) is incorporated in England and Wales under the Companies Act. The Company and its subsidiaries 
(together, the Group) have three principal activities:
• Power generation;
• Gas and electricity supply to business customers; and
• Manufacturing of sustainable compressed wood pellets for use in electricity production.
The Group’s activities are principally based within the UK, with the wood pellet manufacturing activities situated in the US.
The address of the Company’s registered office and principal establishment is Drax Power Station, Selby, North Yorkshire, YO8 8PH, 
United Kingdom. A full list of operating companies of the Group is disclosed in note 5 to the Company’s separate financial 
statements, which follow these consolidated financial statements.
8.2 Basis of preparation
Adoption of new and revised accounting standards
A number of new and amended standards became effective for the first time in 2019. The Group adopted the following from 
1 January 2019:
IFRS 9 (amended) – Financial Instruments
IFRS 16 – Leases
IFRIC 23 – Uncertainty over Income Tax Treatments
IAS 19 (amended) – Employee Benefits
IAS 28 (amended) – Investments in Associates and Joint Ventures
Annual Improvements to IFRS Standards 2015–2017 Cycle
IFRS Practice Statement 2
Other than the adoption of IFRS 16, these updates and amendments have not had a material impact on the financial statements  
of the Group. The transition disclosures for IFRS 16 have been included in note 8.3.
The Group has elected to early adopt the ‘Amendments to IAS 39 and IFRS 7 Interest Rate Benchmark Reform’ issued in September 
2019. In accordance with the transition provisions, the amendments have been adopted retrospectively to hedging relationships 
that existed at the start of the reporting period or were designated thereafter, and to the amount accumulated in the cash flow 
hedge reserve at that date.
The amendments are relevant to the Group given that it applies hedge accounting to its GBP LIBOR interest rate exposure on the 
£375 million private placement that is hedged using the floating-to-fixed GBP interest rate swap.
The amendments provide temporary relief from applying specific hedge accounting requirements to hedging relationships directly 
affected by interest rate Interbank Offered Rates (IBOR) reform. The reliefs have the effect that IBOR reform should not generally 
cause hedge accounting to terminate. However, any hedge ineffectiveness continues to be recorded in the income statement. 
Furthermore, the amendments set out triggers for when the reliefs will end, which include the uncertainty arising from interest 
rate benchmark reform no longer being present. In summary, the reliefs provided by the amendments that apply to the Group are:
• When considering the ‘highly probable’ requirement, the Group is able to assume that the GBP LIBOR interest rate on which  
the hedged future cash flows are based is not altered as a result of IBOR reform;
• In assessing the hedge effectiveness on a prospective basis, the Group is able to assume that the economic relationship 
between the hedged item and the hedging instrument is not impacted as a result of IBOR reform; and
• When the Group applies these amendments, the quantitative requirements in paragraph 28(f) of IAS 8 Accounting Policies, 
Changes in Accounting Estimates and Errors are not required.
Section 8: Reference information
Drax Group plc Annual report and accounts 2019
204
Section 8: Reference information continued
8.2 Basis of preparation continued
These amendments will cease to apply at the earlier of when the uncertainty regarding the timing and amount of the interest rate 
benchmark-based cash flows are no longer present, or the discontinuation of the hedging relationship.
The additional disclosure requirements that apply as a result of applying the ‘Amendments to IAS 39 and IFRS 7 Interest Rate 
Benchmark Reform’ have been disclosed in note 7.2.
At the date of authorisation of these financial statements, the following new or amended standards and relevant interpretations, 
which have not been applied in these financial statements, were in issue but not yet effective (and some of which were pending 
endorsement by the EU – marked by *):
IFRS 10 (amended) – Consolidated Financial Statements and IAS 28 (amended) – Investments in Associates and Joint Ventures 
(2011) – effective date deferred indefinitely.*
IFRS 3 (amended) – Business Combinations – effective from 1 January 2020.*
Conceptual Framework for Financial Reporting (amended) – effective from 1 January 2020.
IAS 1 (amended) – Presentation of Financial Statements and IAS 8 (amended) Accounting Policies, Changes in Accounting 
Estimates and Errors – effective from 1 January 2020. 
Annual Improvements 2018-2020 Cycle.*
IFRS 17 Insurance contracts – effective from 1 January 2021.*
Adoption of the other standards in future periods is not expected to have a material impact on the financial statements of the Group.
8.3 Adoption of new accounting standards and restatement of previously reported financial statements
IFRS 16 – Leases
IFRS 16 supersedes IAS 17 Leases, IFRIC 4 Determining Whether an Arrangement Contains a Lease, SIC 15 Operating Leases and SIC 
27 Evaluating the Substance of Transactions involving the legal form of a lease.
The Group has adopted IFRS 16 from 1 January 2019 using the modified retrospective method of adoption. Under this method, the 
standard is applied retrospectively with the cumulative effect of initially applying the standard recognised at the date of initial 
application. Consequently, comparative information in these Consolidated Financial Statements for the year ended 31 December 
2018 has not been restated.
The new requirements have impacted the Group’s accounting for lease contracts. The Group’s lease portfolio predominantly 
relates to properties and the hire of plant and equipment at operating sites. On transition to IFRS 16 on 1 January 2019, assets 
controlled under lease contracts were brought onto the balance sheet as right-of-use assets, and the Group has recognised a 
corresponding liability for the amounts payable under the lease contracts.
On transition, the Group elected to use the available practical expedient allowing the standard to only be applied to those 
contracts identified as leases under the previous standards. Accordingly, the definition of a lease in accordance with IAS 17 and 
IFRIC 4 will continue to apply to those leases entered into or modified before 1 January 2019. However, the Group has applied the 
new definition of a lease to all contracts entered into or modified on or after 1 January 2019. This change did not have a significant 
impact on the assessment of contracts that are in scope of the definition of a lease.
The Group has also elected to use the recognition exemptions for lease contracts that, at the commencement date, have a lease 
term of 12 months or less and lease contracts for which the underlying asset is of low value (less than £3,500).
Under IFRS 16, right-of-use assets are tested for impairment. This has replaced the previous requirement to recognise a provision 
for onerous lease contracts.

8.3 Adoption of new accounting standards and restatement of previously reported financial statements 
continued
Nature of the effect of adoption of IFRS 16
Leases previously classified as finance leases
The Group has not changed the initial carrying amounts of recognised assets and liabilities at the date of initial application for 
leases previously classified as finance leases (i.e. the right-of-use assets and lease liabilities equal the lease assets and liabilities 
recognised under IAS 17). The requirements of IFRS 16 were applied to these leases from 1 January 2019 and the related amounts 
on the balance sheet reclassified from property, plant and equipment to right-of-use assets and borrowings to lease liabilities.
Leases previously accounted for as operating leases
The Group has recognised right-of-use assets and lease liabilities for those leases previously classified as operating leases, except 
for short-term leases and leases of low-value assets. Lease liabilities were recognised based on the present value of the remaining 
lease payments, discounted using the incremental borrowing rate at the date of initial application. When calculating the remaining 
lease payments, termination options and extension options have been considered in determining the lease term where deemed to 
be reasonably probable. The right-of-use assets are recognised based on the amount equal to the lease liabilities, adjusted for any 
related prepaid and accrued lease payments previously recognised.
The Group also applied the following practical expedients as permitted by IFRS 16:
• Use of a single discount rate to a portfolio of leases with reasonably similar characteristics;
• Relied on its assessment of whether leases are onerous immediately before the date of initial application;
• Applied the short-term leases exemptions to leases with a lease term that ends within 12 months at the date of initial application;
• For leases of low value assets, the Group has elected to recognise a lease expense on a straight-line basis;
• Excluded the initial direct costs from the measurement of the right-of-use asset at the date of initial application; and
• Used hindsight in determining the lease term where the contract contains options to extend or terminate the lease.
Based on the above, as at 1 January 2019:
• Right-of-use assets of £37.1 million were recognised and presented separately in the balance sheet. This includes the lease assets 
recognised previously under finance leases of £0.6 million that were reclassified from property, plant and equipment.
• Additional lease liabilities of £37.6 million were recognised separately on the balance sheet. This includes £0.5 million previously 
recognised as finance leases that were reclassified from borrowings.
Prepayments of £0.1 million and trade and other payables of £0.7 million related to previous operating leases were derecognised.
The effect of adopting IFRS 16 as at 1 January 2019 is as follows:

Whilst judgements have been made on initial application of IFRS 16, these are not considered significant to the Consolidated 
Financial Statements
Impact of IFRS 16 on comparative information
As the Group has made the election to adopt the modified retrospective approach, no comparative information for the 
31 December 2018 has been restated for the effects of transition to the new standard. This has led to a lack of comparability  
in certain areas of the financial statement for the two years.
Income statement
Under the previous accounting standards, operating leases were expensed to the income statement on a systematic basis over the 
lease term, in the year ended 31 December 2018, £6.3 million was expensed to operating expenses for the operating lease rentals. 
Under IFRS 16, operating leases are recognised on the balance sheet as right-of-use assets with a corresponding lease liability. 
Interest on the lease liability is expensed to the income statement as the discount on the lease liability unwinds. Depreciation on 
the right-of-use assets is charged to the income statement on a straight-line basis over the lease terms. Lease payments are no 
longer expensed to the income statement but reduce the lease liability.
The impact of IFRS 16 on the income statement for the year to 31 December 2019 was as follows:

Notes to the Company financial statements
1. Basis of preparation
The separate financial statements of the Company are presented as required by the Companies Act 2006.
The Company meets the definition of a qualifying entity under Financial Reporting Standard 100 (FRS 100) issued by the Financial 
Reporting Council (FRC).
The financial statements have been prepared in accordance with FRS 101, ‘Reduced Disclosure Framework’ (FRS 101).
The Company applied certain new and amended standards for the first time in 2019. The full list of standards adopted is set out in 
the consolidated financial statements in note 8.2. These updates and amendments have not had a material impact on the financial 
statements of the Company.
As permitted by FRS 101, the Company has taken advantage of the disclosure exemptions available under that standard in relation 
to presentation of a cash flow statement, financial instruments, share-based payments, capital risk management, standards not 
yet effective and certain related party transactions. Where required, equivalent disclosures are given in the consolidated financial 
statements.
The financial statements have been prepared under the historical cost convention. The principal accounting policies adopted are 
summarised below and have been consistently applied to both years presented.
2. Summary of significant accounting policies
Fixed asset investments
Fixed asset investments in subsidiaries are stated at cost less, where relevant, provision for impairment.
Financial instruments
Issued equity – Ordinary shares are classified as equity as evidenced by their residual interest in the assets of the Company after 
deducting all of its liabilities. Incremental costs directly attributable to the issue of new shares or options are shown in equity as a 
deduction, net of tax, from the proceeds. The share premium account records amounts by which the proceeds from issuing shares 
exceeds the nominal value of the shares issued unless merger relief criteria within the Companies Act 2006 are met, in which case 
the difference is recorded in retained earnings.
Cash and cash equivalents – Cash and cash equivalents includes cash in hand, deposits held at call with banks, other short-term 
highly liquid investments with original maturities of three months or less, and bank overdrafts.
3. Critical accounting judgements
Critical judgements in applying the Company’s accounting policies
The critical accounting judgements made in preparation of the Company’s financial statements are set out below:
Impairment of fixed asset investments
Determining whether the Company’s investments in subsidiaries have been impaired requires estimates of the investments’ values 
in use. The methodology for calculation of value-in-use is consistent with that of the Group, as detailed in note 2.4 to the 
consolidated financial statements.
4. Profit and loss account
As permitted by Section 408 of the Companies Act 2006, the Company has elected not to present its own profit and loss account 
for the year. The Company’s profit and loss account was approved by the Board on 26 February 2020. The net profit attributable  
to the Company is £57.3 million. 
The Company received dividend income from its subsidiary undertakings totalling £60.5 million in 2019 (2018: £102.6 million).
The Company has no employees other than the directors, whose remuneration was paid by a subsidiary undertaking and a 
proportion was recharged to the Company.
The auditor’s remuneration for audit services provided to the Company for the year ended 31 December 2019 was £22,050 
(2018: £21,000).

The Company has only one class of shares, which are ordinary shares of 11 16⁄29 pence each, carrying no right to fixed income.  
No shareholders have waived their rights to dividends.
Issued under employee share schemes
From January to December 2019 a total of 3,282,563 shares (2018: 158,739 shares) were issued in satisfaction of options vesting  
in accordance with the rules of the Group’s Savings-Related Share Option Plan. 
The total cash received, split between nominal value and share premium, is shown in the statement of changes in equity on 
page 210.
Full details of share options outstanding are included in note 6.2 to the consolidated financial statements.
7. Distributable reserves
The Company considers its distributable reserves to be comprised of the profit and loss account, less credits in respect of share 
schemes, less treasury shares, with a total value of £188.2 million. Accordingly, the Company considers itself to have sufficient 
distributable profits from which to pay the current year final dividend of £38.0 million. Based on a total dividend for 2019 of 
£63.0 million, the Company has sufficient distributable reserves to pay three years of dividend at the current level without 
generating further distributable profits. In addition to its own reserves, the Company has access to the distributable reserves  
of its subsidiary undertakings with which future dividend payments can be funded (see note 2.10 to the consolidated financial 
statements for additional information).
The Company is dependent upon its subsidiaries for the provision of cash with which to make dividend payments. The Group has 
sufficient cash resources with which to meet the proposed dividend (see note 4.2 to the consolidated financial statement for 
additional information).

The guarantees have been issued for nil consideration and the Company has not charged the subsidiary for the guarantees.
The Company has provided guarantees over the liabilities of its subsidiaries that have taken the advantage of the audit exemption 
available in section 479A of the Companies Act 2006. The list of subsidiaries who have taken this exemption can be found in note 5.

The Company’s share register is maintained by Equiniti Limited (“Equiniti”), who is primarily responsible for updating the share 
register and for dividend payments.

regarding:
• transfer of shares;

• death of a registered shareholder.
Equiniti can be contacted as follows:
• Call Equiniti on 0371 384 2030 from within the UK. Lines are open from 8.30am to 5.30pm, Monday to Friday, (excluding Bank 
Holidays) or +44 121 415 7047 from outside the UK.
• Write to Equiniti at Equiniti Limited, Aspect House, Spencer Road, Lancing, West Sussex BN99 6DA.
When contacting Equiniti by telephone or in writing it is advisable to have your shareholder reference to hand and quote Drax 
Group plc, as well as the name and address in which the shares are held.

to offer a range of services and tailor the communications to meet your needs.
A range of frequently asked shareholder questions can also be found on our website at www.drax.com/investors/faq.
Tax on dividends
The way that dividends are taxed changed in 2017. Below is a brief summary of the guidance provided by HMRC as it relates to the 
current tax year. If you are in any doubt as to the impact on your personal circumstances, you are recommended to seek your own 
financial advice from a professional adviser authorised under the Financial Services and Markets Act 2000.
There is a tax-free Dividend Allowance of £2,000 per annum in the 2019-2020 tax year (2018-2019: £2,000) This means that there 
is no tax to pay on the first £2,000 of dividend income, no matter what non-dividend income a shareholder may have. Dividends 
paid on shares held within pensions and ISAs are unaffected and remain tax-free.
Non-taxpayers and basic rate taxpayers who receive dividend income of more than £2,001 but less than £10,000 are required to 
notify HMRC that they have this source of income
Non-taxpayers and basic rate taxpayers who receive dividend income of more than £10,001 are required to file a self-assessment 
return with HMRC. 
The above requirements apply to Share Incentive Plan participants receiving cash dividends on their plan shares.
Further information and updates on tax on dividends can be found on the Gov.UK website at www.gov.uk/tax-on-dividends

Beneficial owners and “information rights”
If your shares are registered in the name of a third party (i.e. an ISA provider or other nominee company) you may, if you wish, 
receive information rights under Section 146 of the Companies Act 2006. In order for this to happen, you must contact the third 
party registered holder, who will then nominate you. All communications by beneficial owners of shares where the shares are held 
by third party registered holders must be directed to that registered holder and not to Drax or Equiniti.
ShareGift
ShareGift (registered charity No. 1052686) is an independent charity which provides a free service for shareholders wishing to 
dispose charitably of small parcels of shares, which would most likely cost more to sell than they are worth. There are no capital 
gains tax implications (i.e. no gain or loss) on gifts of shares to charity and it is possible to obtain income tax relief. Further 
information can be obtained directly from the charity at www.sharegift.org.
Share frauds (“boiler room scams”)
In recent years, many companies have become aware that their shareholders have received unsolicited phone calls or 
correspondence offering to purchase their shares at apparently inflated prices. It is often the case that the caller, or message in  
the correspondence claims that they represent a majority shareholder who is looking to take over the Company. At the time of this 
report, the Company was not the subject of a take-over attempt, hostile or otherwise, and approaches such as those outlined are 
usually made by unauthorised companies and individuals. Shareholders should be very wary of any unsolicited advice, offers to buy 
shares at a premium or offers of free reports into the Company. Below is the advice from the Financial Conduct Authority (the “FCA”).
Beware of share fraud
Fraudsters use persuasive and high-pressure tactics to lure investors into scams. They may offer to sell shares that turn out to be 
worthless or non-existent, or to buy shares at an inflated price in return for upfront payment. While high profits are promised, if you 
buy or sell shares in this way you will probably lose your money.
How to avoid share fraud:
• Keep in mind that firms authorised by the FCA are unlikely to contact you out of the blue with an offer to buy or sell shares.
• Do not get into a conversation, note the name of the person and firm contacting you and then end the call.
• Check the Financial Services Register from www.fca.org.uk to see if the person and firm contacting you is authorised by the 
FCA.
• Beware of fraudsters claiming to be from an authorised firm, copying its website or giving you false contact details.
• Use the firm’s contact details listed on the Register if you want to call it back.
• Call the FCA on 0800 111 6768 if the firm does not have contact details on the Register or you are told they are out of date.
• Search the list of unauthorised firms to avoid at www.fca.org.uk/scams.
• Consider that if you buy or sell shares from an unauthorised firm you will not have access to the Financial Ombudsman Service or 
Financial Services Compensation Scheme.
• Think about getting independent financial and professional advice before you hand over any money.
Remember, if it sounds too good to be true, it probably is!
Report a scam
If you are approached by fraudsters please tell the FCA using the share fraud reporting form at www.fca.org.uk/scams, where you 
can find out more about investment scams.
You can also call the FCA Consumer Helpline on 0800 111 6768.
If you have already paid money to share fraudsters you should contact Action Fraud on 0300 123 2040.

Black start
Procedure used to restore power in the event of a total or partial 
shutdown of the national electricity transmission system.
Biomass
Organic material of non-fossil origin, including organic waste,

Contracts for difference (CfD)
A mechanism to support investment in low-carbon electricity 
generation. The CfD works by stabilising revenues for 
generators at a fixed price level known as the “strike price”. 
Generators will receive revenue from selling their electricity into 
the market as usual. However, when the market reference price 
is below the strike price they will also receive a top-up payment 
from suppliers for the additional amount. Conversely if the 
reference price is above the strike price, the generator must pay 
back the difference.
