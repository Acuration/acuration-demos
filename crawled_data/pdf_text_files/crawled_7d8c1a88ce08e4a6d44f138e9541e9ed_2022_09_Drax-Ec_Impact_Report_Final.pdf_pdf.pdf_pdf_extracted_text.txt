EXECUTIVE SUMMARY
Drax Group (Drax) is the global leader in the production, generation, 
and supply of renewable power from sustainably sourced biomass, 
and a pioneer in carbon removal technology. Its purpose is to enable 
a zero carbon, lower cost energy future. 
Drax plays a key role in the British energy 
market, generating and supplying low-carbon 
energy, and providing energy solutions to 
industrial and business consumers across 
the country. It is the U.K.’s largest source of 
renewable power by output, with its portfolio 
of sustainable bioenergy, hydro-electric, and 
pumped storage hydro assets spread across 
England and Scotland. 
Drax also has 17 operational and development 
pellet production sites across North America 
supplying sustainable biomass to power 
companies throughout Europe and Asia. 
Wood fiber used in pellet production is a by-
product of sustainable forest management 
and the manufacture of solid wood products. 
Since acquiring Pinnacle Renewable Energy 
in 2021, it has expanded its footprint across 
North America and transformed into a truly 
international business.
In the medium-term, Drax plans to be the 
first power company in the world to capture 
carbon from 100% biomass feedstock, 
removing carbon from the atmosphere and 
creating ‘negative emissions’. Drax has an 
ambition to capture 12 MtCO2 a year by 2030 
globally (including 8MtCO2 at the Drax Power 
Station in Yorkshire), to support the rapid 
decarbonisation of the global power sector.
Reflecting the international nature of Drax’s 
businesses, this study investigates its economic 
impact in the U.K., U.S., and Canada. It considers 
Drax’s own operations, the economic activity 
supported by its procurement spending and the 
impact of the wage payments to employees. 
A SUMMARY OF THE KEY FINDINGS OF THE REPORT
Drax sustains a sizeable contribution to the 
economies of the U.K., U.S., and Canada. 
Drax supported 35,600 jobs in total across the 
U.K., U.S., and Canada in 2021. The company 
directly employed around 3,200 workers across 
its sites in the three countries. A further 21,800 
jobs were supported along its supply chain by its 
procurement spend. The wage-induced spending 
of its employees and those employed in its 
supply chain sustained a further 10,600 jobs. 
By country, Drax supported a total of 17,800 jobs 
across the U.K. in 2021. These jobs were spread 
throughout the U.K.’s nations and regions, with 
the most jobs, some 3,450, supported in the 
Yorkshire and The Humber region.
In Canada, Drax supported a total 10,400 jobs in 
2021. Some 4,700 of these jobs were sustained 
in British Columbia, where the majority of the 
company’s Canadian sites are located.
The company’s operations also supported a total 
of 7,400 jobs in the United States. A significant 
share of these jobs were sustained in the states 
in which the company’s operations are focused, 
including 2,700 jobs in Louisiana, 2,000 jobs in 
Alabama, and 1,200 jobs in Mississippi.

The economic impact of Drax in the U.K., U.S., & Canada
We estimate that Drax supported a total 
contribution of £3.1 billion in 2021 across the 
U.K., U.S. and Canada. This is the sum of three 
channels of impact. Some £0.6 billion was 
generated by the company itself—its direct 
impact. The company’s sizeable procurement 
spending with external suppliers stimulated 
a further £1.7 billion contribution to GDP—its 
indirect impact. And the payment of wages 
by Drax, and the firms in its supply chain, 
supported a further £0.8 billion contribution 
to GDP—its induced impact.
A total contribution of £1.8 billion to U.K. 
GDP was supported by Drax’s operations in 
2021. One third of this GDP impact, nearly 
£600 million, was generated in the Yorkshire 
and The Humber region, home of Drax Power 
Station. Drax also supported a £722 million 
($1.0 billion) contribution to U.S. GDP, and a 
£616 million (CA$1.1 billion) contribution to 
Canadian GDP in 2021.
In addition, Drax supported nearly £700 million 
in tax revenues to the countries’ authorities in 
2021. The majority of this total was supported 
in the U.K., with some nearly £400 million in 
tax payments to the U.K. Exchequer associated 
with Drax, across the three channels of impact. 
A further £161 million (CA$277 million) in tax 
payments were supported in Canada, and £130 
million ($180 million) in the U.S.

INTRODUCTION
This report—commissioned by 
Drax—measures the footprint 
of the company’s global 
operations by estimating 
its economic and social 
contribution in the U.K., U.S., 
and Canada in 2021. It follows 
a series of reports produced 
by Oxford Economics for 
Drax, which have quantified 
its economic impact in the 
U.K. in the period 2015–2019. 
This report expands the 
scope of the assessment to 
include Drax’s impact in the 
United States and Canada in 
order to capture the global 
nature of its operations using 
Oxford Economics’ Global 
Sustainability Model.
Drax is a leading British energy 
company working primarily 
in the production and supply 
of renewable energy. It is 
the U.K.’s largest source of 
renewable power by output 
and is the second largest 
sustainable biomass producer 
globally.1 Its operation has 
three main areas: producing 
sustainable biomass pellets for 
use in electricity production; 
generating electricity; and 
supplying power to customers.
1 Drax, “Innovating for a positive future”, Annual report and accounts 2021, 2022
Pellets are produced from 
forestry and agriculture by-
products and residues in North 
America. Drax now has 17 pellet 
production sites located across 
the southern U.S. and western 
Canada. Recent acquisitions 
have fuelled the growth of its 
pellet production operations, 
with the production volume in 
2021 representing an increase 
of 109% relative to 2020. Once 
manufactured, pellets are 
transported to the U.K. for use 
in electricity production or 
sold to third parties. Drax has 
around £3.8 billion ($4.5 billion) 
of long-term contracted pellet 
sales to third party businesses 
across Asia and Europe.
Drax has a portfolio of 
renewable power assets 
across the U.K.. The largest 
of which is Drax Power 
Station—the biomass 
facility is the U.K.’s largest 
single source of renewable 
electricity by output. The 
company also has hydro and 
pumped storage facilities 
located across the country. 
Some 94% of the electricity 
generated in 2021 by Drax 
was renewable, up from 77% 
in the previous year. In fact, 
the group generated 12% of 
the U.K.’s total renewable 
electricity in 2021, a rise 
from 11% in 2020. In addition, 
Drax’s Customer business 
focuses on selling renewable 
electricity to industrial and 
corporate customers.
The following report is 
structured as follows:
• The first chapter explores 
the economic and social 
contribution Drax made 
to the U.K. economy in 
2021, through the GDP, 
employment, and tax 
revenues it supported 
nationwide and in each 
of its constituent nations 
and regions.
• The second chapter outlines 
Drax’s impact in the U.S., 
including in Alabama, 
Louisiana, and Mississippi.
• The third chapter investigates 
the contribution of Drax to 
the economies of Canada 
and British Columbia.
• The appendix outlines the 
methodology used in the 
analysis, detailing Oxford 
Economics’ approach 
to measuring economic 
and social impacts in 
each country.
INTRODUCTION TO ECONOMIC IMPACT ANALYSIS
This report analyses Drax’s economic impact 
across three core channels. These are the:
• Direct impact, which is the economic 
activity that Drax itself generates at its 
U.K., U.S., and Canadian facilities; 
• Indirect impact, or supply chain impact, 
which encapsulates the economic activity 
supported along Drax’s supply chains in 
the U.K., U.S., and Canada as a result of its 
procurement of goods and services; and,
• Induced impact, or wage-financed 
spending impact, which is the economic 
activity stimulated from both Drax’s, 
and its suppliers’, wage payments to 
employees.
We analyse these channels of impact using 
three core metrics:
• Employment (measured on a 
headcount basis); 
• Gross value added (GVA) contribution to 
the country’s GDP; and, 
• Tax receipts generated by the activity and 
employment supported by Drax.
While most economic impact assessments 
measure these effects based only on 
spending that occurs within the country of 
interest, this report goes further, to assess 
the impact of Drax’s global activities in 
the U.K., U.S., and Canada. This is a more 
comprehensive approach that is suited to 
companies with a global footprint, like Drax. 
A detailed methodology discussion is in the 
appendix to this report.
Fig. 3: Illustrating the channels of economic impact
Employees (including of the 
suppliers) spend their 
wages in the wider 
economy, generating more 
GDP, jobs and tax revenues.
Added together, these three 
efects—direct, indirect, 
induced—comprise the total 
economic impact of Drax Group.
It also spends money with 
suppliers who employ staf, 
generate GDP and pay taxes. 
They use other suppliers in turn.

THE ECONOMIC IMPACT OF 
DRAX IN THE U.K.
Drax’s power generation assets 
are located in the U.K.. Its 
portfolio of low-carbon and 
renewable power generation 
facilities include biomass, 
hydro, and pumped storage. 
The largest is Drax Power 
Station, which is located along 
with its corporate headquarters 
at Selby in the Yorkshire and 
the Humber region. It is the 
U.K.’s largest single source of 
renewable electricity—providing 
12% of the U.K.’s renewable 
power—using biomass pellets. 
The company is also working 
towards progressing options 
for bioenergy with carbon 
capture and storage (BECCS) 
at the site. Its plans for the 
carbon capture project include 
removing 8Mt of CO2 emissions 
from the atmosphere each year 
by 2030.
2 This is measured as the average of monthly employment levels during the year.
The U.K. is also home to Drax’s 
Customer business. This 
part of the business focuses 
primarily on selling renewable 
electricity to industrial and 
commercial customers and 
providing support and energy 
management services. This 
includes Ipswich-based Drax 
Customers (formerly known 
as Haven Power), acquired 
by Drax in 2009, and Opus 
Energy, which was acquired by 
Drax in 2017, and has recently 
moved to a new office in 
Northampton, East Midlands.
In this section we outline the 
economic activity supported 
by Drax in the U.K. in 2021 
through its gross value added 
contribution to U.K. GDP, 
employment supported, and 
tax revenues sustained. We also 
explore the social contribution 
it makes to the communities in 
which it operates.
DIRECT ECONOMIC IMPACT
The activities of Drax directly 
contributed £510 million to 
U.K. GDP during 2021. This 
figure encompasses the gross 
profits it earned through its 
operations and the gross 
wages paid to its workers. 
Drax employed 2,427 workers 
across the U.K. in 2021.2 This 
employment was spread 
across the country at Drax’s 
various sites. The most jobs 
were located at Drax Power 
Station, in the Yorkshire and 
The Humber region, with an 
average of 904 roles (37% of 
the total) in various capacities 
during 2021 (Fig. 4). A further 
756 workers were located 
at the Northampton, East 
Midlands, office, and 367 
workers at the Ipswich office, 
East of England.
The company’s staff are highly 
productive. The average 
gross value added generated 
per employee—a measure of 
productivity—of Drax workers 
in the U.K. was £210,100 in 
2021. This means that the 
company’s U.K. workers were 
237% more productive than 
the average worker in the 
country, and 300% more 
productive than the average 
worker in the Yorkshire and the 
Humber region (Fig. 5).3 Having 
high productivity workers is 
important because it boosts 
the price competitiveness 
of U.K. products and 
living standards for the 
U.K.’s residents. Increasing 
nationwide productivity is a 
key part of the Government’s 
Industrial Strategy, and the 
high productivity of Drax 
employees helps to address the 
U.K.’s historic productivity gap 
with the other G7 economies.4
3 ONS, “Subregional productivity: labour productivity indices by U.K. ITL2 and ITL3 subregions”, 2022
4 ONS, “International comparisons of U.K. productivity (ICP), final estimates: 2020”, 2022
5 This includes external energy purchases from Drax’s Customer business, following the methodology used in previous Oxford 
Economics reports for Drax.
In addition, Drax directly 
generated £88 million in 
tax revenues to the U.K. 
Exchequer. This total is made 
up of the U.K. Corporation 
Tax paid by the group, and 
the labour taxes generated by 
its direct workforce (income 
tax, and employers’ and 
employees’ National Insurance 
Contributions). 
INDIRECT ECONOMIC IMPACT
Drax has a broad and diverse 
supply chain that spans the 
world, but businesses in the 
U.K. are important suppliers 
to the group’s operations. 
Its purchases of goods and 
services from U.K. businesses 
stimulates further “indirect” 
economic activity.
In 2021, Drax spent £1.2 billion 
with U.K.-based suppliers. The 
majority of this spending, some 
£0.9 billion, was with suppliers 
in the power and utilities 
sector, including the group’s 
National Grid spending.5 A 
further £80 million was spent 
on professional, scientific, and 
technical services, while £61 
million was spent on services 
ancillary to energy provision 
(such as metering or brokerage 
fees). In order to meet the 
intermediate demands of 
Drax, these businesses make 
purchases from their own 
suppliers, and so on down the 
supply chain. The sum of all 
these supply chain interactions 
produces the so-called indirect 
impact, which ripples out across 
the economy and country.

The economic impact of Drax in the U.K., U.S., & Canada
The economic impact of Drax in the U.K., U.S., & Canada
We estimate Drax’s 
procurement spending with 
suppliers supported a further 
£820 million contribution to 
U.K. GDP during 2021, and 
around 9,500 jobs across the 
country. This impact is sizeable: 
the number of indirect jobs 
supported by the group was 
nearly four times as many 
as its direct employment, 
pointing towards the capital-
intensive nature of its activities. 
The most indirect jobs were 
sustained in Yorkshire and 
The Humber, with 1,200 jobs, 
followed by the East Midlands, 
with 1,150 jobs (Fig. 6).
The economic activity 
supported along Drax’s supply 
chain generated a further £213 
million in U.K. tax receipts. 
The majority of this total was 
labour taxes (54%), while taxes 
on products, such as VAT, 
accounted for a further 13%.
6 ONS, “Annual Survey of Hours and Earnings (ASHE)”, 2022
7 Figures based on where the Drax worker resides.
INDUCED ECONOMIC IMPACT
The wage-financed spending 
of those employed by Drax, 
or in its supply chain, forms 
a further channel through 
which it contributes to the 
U.K. economy. Employees 
make purchases at retail and 
leisure outlets throughout 
the country; these purchases 
stimulate further activity, 
adding value, sustaining 
employment, and raising tax 
revenues.
Drax paid £179 million in gross 
employee compensation 
in the U.K. during 2021. 
This figure encompasses 
wages and salaries, pensions 
contributions, share-based 
payments, and compensation 
costs (where relevant). 
Drax pays high wages to its 
U.K. staff—around 39% higher 
than the national average 
wage in 2021 (Fig. 7).6 In the 
Yorkshire and The Humber 
region, where the largest 
number of the company’s 
staff are located, the average 
Drax wage was 83% higher 
than the region’s average, and 
82% higher in the North West 
and London.7 Not only does 
this renumeration support 
household consumption across 
the U.K. (Drax’s “induced” 
impact), but it contributes to 
social outcomes including the 
levelling up of communities 
across the country as 
employees spend their 
earnings in the local economy.
We estimate the wage-
financed spending attributable 
to Drax supported a further 
£437 million contribution to 
U.K. GDP in 2021, sustaining 
5,800 jobs across the country. 
Most of these jobs were 
supported in Yorkshire and The 
Humber (1,330 jobs, or 23% of 
the total). This was followed 
by the East Midlands, with 800 
jobs supported (or 14% of the 
total). This reflects the areas 
where Drax staff live in the U.K. 
and are therefore more likely 
to spend their wages in the 
consumer economy, with these 
regions hosting the Drax Power 
Station and Northampton 
office, respectively. 
This induced activity 
was associated with tax 
payments of £97 million to 
the U.K. Exchequer. This sum 
encompasses all the taxes on 
profits, wages, and procurement 
discussed previously, while 
also including the VAT accrued 
as a result of Drax’s induced 
consumption impact.

The economic impact of Drax in the U.K., U.S., & Canada
The economic impact of Drax in the U.K., U.S., & Canada
TOTAL ECONOMIC IMPACT
By adding the three channels 
of impact discussed above we 
arrive at our estimates for the 
total impact of Drax in the U.K. 
in 2021. This is the company’s 
total “footprint” on the U.K. 
economy. 
 
We estimate Drax’s activities 
generated a £1.8 billion 
contribution to U.K. GDP 
during 2021. The company 
itself contributed more than 
£500 million to U.K. GDP 
over the year. Owing to the 
extensive and sizeable nature 
of Drax’s U.K. supply chain, the 
indirect channel accounted for 
nearly half (46%) of this total 
contribution (Fig. 9). And, 
lastly, Drax and its suppliers’ 
wage payments contributed 
nearly £440 million to U.K. 
GDP. 
8 ONS, “Annual Survey of Hours and Earnings (ASHE)”, 2022
9 HMRC, “HMRC tax receipts and National Insurance contributions for the U.K.”, 2022
To put these numbers 
into context, Drax’s total 
contribution to GDP was 
equivalent in size to 11% of 
Liverpool’s economy. Put 
another way, our results show 
that for every £1 in gross 
value added generated by 
Drax itself, it supported a 
further £2.50 around the rest 
of the U.K. economy through 
its expenditure. This means 
we estimate Drax has a GDP 
multiplier of 3.5. 
Drax supported 17,800 jobs 
across the U.K. in 2021. The 
company itself employed 
nearly 2,500 people across the 
country. Mirroring the case with 
its contribution to GDP, the 
group supported the greatest 
number of people through its 
procurement: an estimated 
9,500 jobs with U.K. suppliers, 
or 53% of the total. Finally, 
Drax and its suppliers’ wage 
payments supported 5,800 
U.K. jobs. The total number of 
jobs supported by Drax in 2021 
was equivalent to 15% of the 
total employment in York.
The economic activity 
supported by Drax also 
generated an estimated 
£400 million in U.K. tax 
revenues. The majority of this, 
an estimated £213 million in 
tax payments, is generated 
along the company’s supply 
chain. This total is a significant 
contribution to the U.K. 
Exchequer that would be 
sufficient to pay the annual 
salaries of 12,800 nurses or 
9,700 police officers, for 
example.8 It also means £1 
in every £1,800 collected by 
HMRC can be attributed to 
Drax’s activity.9

SOCIAL VALUE ANALYSIS
Beyond the headline metrics 
described above, we can 
explore the importance of 
Drax’s economic footprint by 
considering the social value it 
creates in communities across 
the country. With eight sites 
located throughout the U.K., 
Drax contributes to the U.K. 
Government’s Levelling Up 
agenda by purchasing goods 
and services, paying wages, 
and supporting economic 
activity across the length and 
breadth of the country. 
10 Government Commercial Function, “The Social Value Model”, 2020
11 HM Government, “English indices of deprivation”, 2022; ONS, “Local labour market indicators by unitary and local authority”; 
“Business demography”, 2022
12 This pertains to procurement spending in England only because each of the U.K.’s constituent nations have their own, separate 
index of multiple deprivation.
The U.K. Government sets out 
a framework for measuring 
social impact in its Social Value 
Model.10 Here we consider two 
areas in which Drax supports 
communities across the U.K.: 
tackling economic inequality 
by creating new businesses, 
new jobs, and new skills; and 
supporting wellbeing.
Drax procures goods and 
services from communities that 
have experienced deprivation. 
A higher proportion of its 
spending went to businesses 
located in U.K. local authorities 
experiencing socioeconomic 
challenges and where newly 
opened businesses are least 
likely to survive.11 In 2021, 
businesses located in the 10% of 
local authorities with the:
• Lowest rates of business 
survival after one year 
received 35% of Drax’s 
procurement spending;
• Highest unemployment 
rate received 20% of Drax’s 
procurement spending;
• Highest rates of economic 
inactivity received 16% 
of Drax’s procurement 
spending; and
• Highest rankings of the 
English Index of Multiple 
Deprivation—a composite 
indicator covering seven 
domains of deprivation: 
income, employment, 
education, health, crime, 
housing, and living 
environment—received 
16% of Drax’s procurement 
spending.12
In supporting economic 
activity in these areas, the 
company is addressing the 
U.K.’s regional economic 
inequalities and contributing 
to the U.K. Government’s 
Levelling Up agenda. 
Drax further contributes to 
tackling economic inequality 
by investing in upskilling. 
The company has 52 
apprentices, along with 50 
of its employees working 
towards apprenticeship 
qualifications across a range 
of disciplines from engineering 
to data science. Together, the 
apprentices’ learning hours 
topped 32,000 in 2021. 
The economic benefits of 
apprenticeships are significant. 
The lifetime benefits 
associated with completing 
a Level 2 Apprenticeship 
are between £58,000 and 
£90,000 (in current prices), 
and between £93,000 
and £142,000 for a Level 3 
Apprenticeship.13
The apprenticeship scheme 
represents a significant 
contribution to areas like 
Selby—where a number of 
the apprentices are based at 
Drax Power Station—which 
has among the lowest rates 
of youth employment in the 
country (27%, compared to 
a national average of 52%), 
and the highest shares of 
the population with no 
qualifications in 2021 (31% 
with no NVQ qualifications, 
compared to a national 
average of 8%).14
13 Department for Business Innovation and Skills, “Returns to Intermediate and Low Level Vocational Qualifications”, 2011. Findings are 
updated to current prices using ONS GDP deflators.
14 ONS, “Annual Population Survey”, 2022
15 ONS, “Annual Population Survey”, 2022. Note: respondents were asked whether they had received job-related training or education 
in the last 13 weeks.
16 https://thewaterline.global 
But it is not just apprentices 
that benefit from training at 
Drax. In 2021, the company 
delivered more than 11 hours 
of training per worker, at a 
total cost of £600,000. This 
is notable given only 19% of 
the U.K. labour force reported 
receiving work-related training 
in 2021.15
Activities run by Drax are 
engaging the next generation 
with STEM subjects and 
assisting students with career 
engagement. The company 
is encouraging new skills by 
engaging more than 10,000 
students, from primary 
schools up to higher education 
institutions, with educational 
activities. Moreover, in the 
build-up to the COP26 summit, 
the company’s Waterline 
Summit ebooklet had 450,000 
visits from students, teachers, 
and parents, while more than 
40,000 copies were distributed 
to schools and colleges.16 Drax’s 
Business Directory for Careers 
Leads achieved a further 
85,000 impacts.
Drax supports the wellbeing 
among its employees and in 
the communities in which it 
operates. Safety, health, and 
wellbeing is at the core of 
the company’s values. While 
the employment it provides 
has been shown to enhance 
wellbeing, the company further 
contributes to wellbeing 
outcomes through its 
investment in staff healthcare 
and other programmes. 
Nearly 4,000 Drax employees 
and their family members or 
partners benefit from private 
health insurance. While other 
programmes also sought to 
improve physical, mental, and 
social wellbeing. In 2021, the 
company had:
• More than 11,500 clicks to its 
Living Well magazine;
• Nearly 8,000 intranet 
wellbeing article reads; and
• 400 participants in 
wellbeing activities.
Drax’s focus on wellbeing 
will reduce the demand for 
public healthcare services. 
This is further evidenced 
by the Mental Health First 
Aider training provided to 
20 employees across the 
company during 2021 in 
response to challenges posed 
by the Covid-19 pandemic and 
the disruption it caused.
The commitment to wellbeing 
extends to the communities in 
which Drax operates. In 2021, 
the company gave £421,000 
in charitable donations. This 
includes 1,200 laptops that 
were donated to schools and 
colleges across the country 
through the Laptops for 
Learners scheme to help 
continued learning through 
the pandemic, and more than 
£150,000 donated through 
community partnerships.

THE ECONOMIC IMPACT OF 
DRAX IN THE U.S.
Drax’s pellet production takes 
place in North America—split 
between the Southern U.S. 
and Western Canada—with a 
production capacity of around 
five megatonnes in 2021. In 
the U.S., the group has seven 
operational and development 
sites across the South, with two 
further facilities at the deep-
water ports in Baton Rouge, 
Louisiana, and Mobile, Alabama, 
used to transport pellets to 
Asian and European markets. 
In this section we outline Drax’s 
gross value added contribution 
to GDP, employment, and 
tax revenue supported in the 
U.S. and three of its primary 
States: Alabama, Louisiana, 
and Mississippi. Drax also has 
an impact across other states 
in the U.S., but this impact is 
smaller, so this report does not 
provide a deep dive into these 
areas. This impact is however 
considered in the overall 
assessment of the U.S.
17 Bureau of Economic Analysis, “GDP by State”; “Employment by State”, 2022
DIRECT ECONOMIC IMPACT
The activities of Drax directly 
contributed $82 million to 
U.S. GDP in 2021. This figure 
encompasses the gross 
profits it earned through 
its operations along with 
the gross wages paid to its 
workers. 
The company also employed 
351 U.S. workers in 2021, 
measured as the average of 
monthly employment levels 
during the year (it must be 
noted that the number of 
U.S. employees rose sharply 
throughout the year; Drax 
employed 391 workers at the 
end of the year). The majority 
of these workers were based 
at sites involved in pellet 
production (Fig. 12).
Drax’s U.S. staff are highly 
productive. The average 
gross value added generated 
per worker in 2021, some 
$233,000, was 48% higher 
than the national average 
productivity in the United 
States.17 It was equally 
markedly higher than the 
average productivity in the 
three States individually: 
Alabama (93% above average), 
Louisiana (71% above average), 
and Mississippi (112% above 
average). 
In addition to these gross 
value added and employment 
contributions, the Group 
directly generated around $8 
million in tax revenues to U.S. 
authorities.
 
18 As discussed in the methodological appendix, this is estimated using a global modelling approach that captures all of Drax’s global 
supply chains, including the inflows from other countries. Procurement spending in other countries will benefit some American 
businesses that are in those suppliers’ subsequent supply chains. It is for this reason that the indirect gross value added contribution 
to GDP is greater than Drax’s procurement spending in the U.S..
INDIRECT ECONOMIC IMPACT
Drax spent $573 million with 
U.S. suppliers in 2021. The 
majority of this spending was 
on the production plants, 
including their machinery and 
equipment (61% of the total), 
while a further 21% of this total 
spending was on the wood 
fibers that are used to make 
the pellets. The company’s 
spending was spread across 
the country, with the largest 
share going to businesses in 
Alabama (31%) and Louisiana 
(17%). This spending stimulates 
further economic activity 
along Drax’s U.S. supply chain.
Drax indirectly supported 
a $580 million contribution 
to U.S. GDP through its 
spending with suppliers in 
2021, sustaining an estimated 
4,600 jobs.18 Reflecting 
the company’s spending 
with its suppliers, the most 
jobs were supported in the 
manufacture and installation 
of machinery sector, with 1,620 
jobs supported, following its 
investment into the pellet 
production plants. This was 
followed by the agriculture 
and forestry sector, with 
640 jobs, from which fibers 
are purchased. This indirect 
activity was associated with 
tax revenues of $112 million.

INDUCED ECONOMIC IMPACT
Drax paid $25 million in gross 
employee compensation 
in the U.S. during 2021. 
This figure encompasses 
wages and salaries, pensions 
contributions, share-based 
payments, and compensation 
costs (where relevant). The 
average salary paid by Drax 
in the U.S. was 18% above 
the national average.19 This 
supports more activity in the 
consumer economy as the 
staff spend their wages (Drax’s 
“induced” impact).
Drax wages support staff living 
in rural areas. Of its total wage 
payments in the U.S., Drax paid 
58% to employees living in rural 
areas of the U.S. in 2021.20 Given 
that only around 19% of the U.S. 
19 U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics, “Average hourly and weekly earnings of all employees”, 2022
20 U.S. Census Bureau, “2010 Census Urban and Rural Classification and Urban Area Criteria”, 2010
21 This was estimated by applying Drax wages in each county to the percentage of the population living in rural areas in each county 
reported in the U.S. census. This gives us an estimated distribution of those Drax wages received by people living in rural areas to 
those in urban areas by county and state.
population live in counties that 
are predominantly rural, with 
the remaining 81% in mostly 
urban counties, Drax wages 
offer substantial support for 
these communities. 
In Alabama, some 72% of all 
wages paid to Drax employees 
living in the State were paid to 
people living in rural counties. 
This includes Pickens County, 
AL—a county considered to 
be fully (100%) rural—where 
Drax’s Aliceville plant is 
located. The equivalent figure 
for Mississippi is even higher 
with 82% of wages paid to 
rural areas. More than one-
third of Drax wages in the 
State are paid to employees 
living in Amite County, MS—
where Drax’s sole plant in 
Mississippi is located—which is 
another county considered to 
be fully rural. In Louisiana, 46% 
of wages were paid to staff in 
rural areas, with almost half of 
this share received by those in 
LaSalle County and Morehouse 
Parish–where Drax’s two pellet 
plants in the State are located 
(Fig. 15).21
We estimate that Drax’s 
induced impact sustained a 
$334 million contribution to 
U.S. GDP in 2021. The wage-
induced spending attributable 
to the company also 
supported around 2,400 jobs 
across the country. Some 18% 
of these jobs were supported 
at businesses in the retail 
sector, with 12% in the business 
services sector, and 11% in the 
accommodation and food 
services sector. 
Considering the geographical 
spread of these jobs, 41% 
are supported in Louisiana, 
Alabama, and Mississippi, where 
the majority of the company’s 
U.S. staff reside (Fig. 16). While 
the spending of these staff 
will be more focused in the 
aforementioned states, the 
spending of those employed 
in the country’s U.S. supply 
chain is more spread around 
the country, resulting in jobs 
supported across the U.S. The 
induced activity supported by 
the country was associated with 
tax revenues of $59 million. 
TOTAL ECONOMIC IMPACT
By adding together the three 
channels discussed above, 
we arrive at our estimates 
for the total impact of 
Drax’s activities during 2021. 
This can be considered the 
Group’s “footprint” in the U.S. 
economy, and the economies 
of Alabama, Louisiana, and 
Mississippi, in that year. 
We estimate that Drax’s 
activities generated a $1.0 
billion contribution to U.S. 
GDP during 2021. Owing to the 
extensive and sizeable nature 
of Drax’s U.S. supply chain, the 
indirect channel accounted 
for the majority (58%) of this 
contribution. In total, this 
is a sizeable contribution 
to the American economy, 
equivalent in size to 4.5% of 
Mobile’s (Alabama) economy 
or 12.1% of Monroe’s (Louisiana) 
economy. Nearly half of the 
nationwide total is sustained 
in the three states in which 
Drax’s operations are focused. 
This includes a $207 million 
total contribution to Louisiana’s 
economy, and a $154 million 
contribution to the economy of 
Alabama in 2021 (Fig. 17)

The economic impact of Drax in the U.K., U.S., & Canada
The economic impact of Drax in the U.K., U.S., & Canada
Drax supported 7,400 jobs 
across the U.S. in 2021. The 
company itself employed 351 
U.S. workers, or 5% of the 
total. But, mirroring the case 
with its contribution to GDP, 
it supported the greatest 
number of people through its 
procurement: an estimated 
4,600 jobs with U.S. suppliers, 
or 62% of the total (Fig. 18). 
Finally, Drax and its suppliers’ 
wage payments supported 
2,400 jobs across the U.S., or 
33% of the total. In total, this 
was equivalent to 2.8% of the 
number of people employed 
in Jackson, Mississippi, for 
instance. By state, some 2,700 
of these jobs were sustained 
in Louisiana, compared to 
2,000 in Alabama, and 1,200 
in Mississippi.
In supporting this economic 
activity, Drax supported an 
estimated $180 million in 
tax revenues paid to U.S.

authorities. This figure includes 
County, State, and Federal 
taxes. The majority, some 62% 
of this total, was supported by 
activity along the company’s 
supply chain. 
SOCIAL VALUE ANALYSIS
More than just sustaining a 
sizeable economic impact 
across the U.S., Drax’s 
expanding operations are 
supporting social value 
across the communities 
in which it operates. The 
company purchases goods 
and services and pays wages 
across Alabama, Louisiana, 
and Mississippi, among other 
areas, stimulating local activity. 
And by generating jobs in the 
U.S., Drax is contributing to 
some of the main aims of the 
government’s American Jobs 
Plan: creating well paid jobs and 
reinvigorating local economies.22
Drax is supporting social 
value in the U.S. by tackling 
economic inequality. In 2021, 
much of its spending—
gravitating around its sites 
in the southern states—was 
focused on areas of the 
country that have experienced 
economic hardship, including 
low engagement with the 
labour market and high rates 
of poverty.23 By sustaining 
economic activity in these 
areas Drax is helping to 
address the U.S.’s regional 
inequalities. In 2021, businesses 
located in the 10% of U.S. 
states with the:
• lowest labour force 
participation rates received 
48% of Drax’s procurement 
spending; 
• highest percentage of 
people living in poverty 
received 31% of Drax’s 
procurement; and
• lowest rates of educational 
attainments received 28% of 
Drax’s procurement. 24
This is representative of 
the economic challenges 
facing the three states in 
which Drax’s U.S. operations 
are focused. Mississippi 
and Louisiana—where Drax 
employs hundreds of workers 
and supports thousands more 
jobs—have the two highest 
rates of people in poverty 
among all of the U.S. states, 
while Alabama ranks seventh.25 
This highlights the importance 
of the economic activity 
sustained by the company in 
these areas. 
The social impact of Drax 
is also evident at a more 
local level. Considering the 
counties (of which there are 
more than 3,200) in which 
its employees reside—some 
26% of its wage payments 
were to staff residing in the 
10% of counties with the 
highest unemployment rates.26 
This further emphasises the 
importance of the company’s 
employment in the U.S., as 
these employees will spend 
their wages in the local area 
and sustain further economic 
activity. Indeed, the wages 
paid by Drax in 2021 were 
above average in the vast 
majority (84%) of the counties 
in which its staff reside. On 
average, the wages it paid to 
its staff were 75% higher than 
the average for the county 
in which they live for those 
residing in Mississippi, 65% 
higher in Alabama, and 55% 
higher in Louisiana (Fig. 20).27

THE ECONOMIC IMPACT OF 
DRAX IN CANADA
In 2021, Drax acquired 
Pinnacle Renewable Energy 
and its pellet production 
assets on Canada’s west coast. 
This addition increased the 
group’s pellet production 
capacity by 2.9 megatonnes 
per annum (to around 5.0 
megatonnes per annum) and 
brought the total number of 
Drax sites in Canada to 11, with 
nine pellet production facilities 
(seven in British Columbia and 
two in Alberta), and facilities 
at the deep water ports in 
Prince Rupert and Vancouver, 
both British Columbia, used 
to export pellets to key 
Asian markets.
In this section we outline 
Drax’s gross value added 
contribution to GDP, 
employment, and tax revenue 
supported in Canada and 
in the Province of British 
Columbia, where the majority 
of pellet production in the 
country will take place.
DIRECT ECONOMIC IMPACT
The activities of Drax directly 
contributed CA$63 million to 
Canadian GDP during 2021. 
This figure encompasses the 
gross profits it earned through 
its operations, and the gross 
wages paid to its workers. It 
also directly employed some 
436 workers in the country, 
measured as the average of 
monthly employment levels 
during the year. The majority 
of these workers were located 
in British Columbia, and the 
majority at pellet production 
plants (Fig. 21).
With an average of CA$145,300 
gross value added generated 
per employee, these staff were 
highly productive—87% above 
the national average, in fact 
(Fig. 22). 
In addition to these GVA and 
employment contributions, the 
group directly generated around 
CA$8 million in tax revenues.
INDIRECT ECONOMIC IMPACT
Drax spent CA$736 million 
with Canadian suppliers in 
2021. More than half of this 
total, some 58%, was spent 
with businesses located in 
British Columbia. A further 13% 
was spent with businesses in 
Alberta and 12% with firms in 
Montreal. As these businesses 
make purchases from their 
28 As discussed in the methodological appendix, this is estimated using a global modelling approach that captures all of Drax’s global 
supply chains, including the inflows from other countries. Procurement spending in other countries will benefit some Canadian 
businesses that are in those suppliers’ subsequent supply chains. It is for this reason that the indirect gross value added contribution 
to GDP is greater than Drax’s procurement spending in Canada.

own suppliers to meet the 
intermediate demands of 
Drax, and so on down the 
supply chain, further economic 
activity ripples out across the 
economies of British Columbia 
and Canada.
Drax’s indirect impact 
supported a CA$739 million 
contribution to Canadian 
GDP during in 2021.28 Some 
CA$324 million of this was 
sustained in British Columbia, 
in the vicinity of Drax’s core 
operations. The group’s 
procurement spending 
also supported 7,700 jobs 
across Canada, with 2,730 of 
these jobs located in British 
Columbia. This indirect 
activity was associated with 
tax revenues of more than 
CA$200 million.
 
 
INDUCED ECONOMIC IMPACT
Drax paid CA$38 million in 
gross employee compensation 
to its Canadian employees in 
2021. This figure encompasses 
wages and salaries, pensions 
contributions, share-based 
payments, and compensation 
costs (where relevant). The 
wages Drax pays to its staff 
support further economic 
activity throughout the country 
as those staff use their wages 
to purchase goods from the 
consumer economy, in local 
retailers and leisure facilities, 
for instance. This is supported 
by the high wages paid by the 
company: the average salary 
it paid in 2021 was 39% above 
the national average.29
Drax pays wages to its staff 
living in rural communities. 
The Canadian Index of 
Remoteness provides a 
measure of how urban or rural 
a community is, giving a value 
of 0.0 for the most urban 
census subdivision, such as in 
Toronto, and up to 1.0 for the 
most rural.30 While the average

The economic impact of Drax in the U.K., U.S., & Canada
The economic impact of Drax in the U.K., U.S., & Canada
value across Canada is 0.35, 
Drax pays its wages to workers 
living in areas with a weighted 
average of 0.38, highlighting its 
support for rural communities. 
In fact, the majority of the 
communities in which it pays 
wages are rural (above the 
average index of remoteness 
value), as shown in Fig. 24. 
We estimate that Drax’s 
induced impact sustained a 
CA$260 million contribution 
to Canadian GDP in 2021. The 
wage-financed spending of 
those employed by Drax, or in 
its Canadian supply chain, also 
supported a further 2,300 jobs 
across the country. Most jobs 
were supported in the retail 
sector, with 420 jobs, or 19% 
of the total (Fig. 25). This was 
followed by the healthcare and 
social work sector (16% of the 
total) and the accommodation 
and food services (hospitality) 
sector (13% of the total). 
A further 520 jobs were 
supported in other sectors, 
such as education (70 jobs) 
and real estate (60 jobs). 
This induced activity was 
associated with tax revenues 
of CA$65 million.

TOTAL ECONOMIC IMPACT
By combining the three 
channels of impact, as 
discussed above, we arrive 
at our estimates for the total 
impact of Drax in Canada 
in 2021. 
We estimate that Drax’s 
activities generated a CA$1.1 
billion contribution to Canadian 
GDP during 2021. With the 
company’s extensive and 
sizeable Canadian supply chain, 
the indirect channel accounted 
for the majority (70%) of this 
contribution. In total, this 
contribution is equivalent in size 
to 1.2% of Edmonton’s economy. 
More than half of the nationwide 
total, some CA$562 million, is 
sustained in the Province of 
British Columbia, where the 
majority of Drax’s Canadian 
operations are located (Fig. 26).
Drax supported 10,400 jobs 
across Canada in 2021. The 
company itself employed 436 
workers in Canada (4% of the 
total). Reflecting the case 
with its contribution to GDP, 
the company supported the 
most Canadian jobs through 
its procurement spending: 
an estimated 7,700 jobs with 
Canadian suppliers, or 74% 
of the total (Fig. 27). The 
company and its suppliers’ 
wage payments supported the 
remaining 2,300 jobs (22% of 
the total). The total number 
of jobs supported across 
Canada was equivalent to 1.3% 
of the total number of people 
employed in Calgary. 
Thousands of jobs were 
supported in the Province of 
British Columbia. Some 4,700 
of the jobs supported in Canada 
were located in British Columbia, 
including more than 2,700 jobs 
supported by the company’s 
procurement spending with 
suppliers (Fig. 27). In supporting 
this economic activity, Drax 
supported an estimated $277 
million in tax revenues paid to 
Canadian authorities.

SOCIAL VALUE ANALYSIS
Beyond the company’s 
headline economic impact 
figures for Canada, we can 
explore the importance 
of Drax to communities 
across British Columbia 
and Alberta, in particular, 
by considering the social 
value it creates in the areas 
surrounding its offices 
and sites. Now with 11 sites 
spread throughout western 
Canada, Drax contributes to 
socioeconomic development 
of the communities in which it 
operates by purchasing goods 
and services, paying wages, 
and supporting economic 
activity. This aligns with the 
31 Government of Canada, “Jobs and Growth Fund”, 2021
32 Statistics Canada, “Census Profile, 2021”, 2022
33 Defined as the highest share of residents in the lowest 10% of earners across the country.
aims of the Government of 
Canada, which is trying to 
support regional job creation 
and establish long-term 
growth in local economies 
through its Jobs and Growth 
Fund, for instance.31
Drax creates jobs and pays 
wages to people living in 
communities that have 
experienced socioeconomic 
challenges, supporting 
social value by tackling 
economic inequalities. A 
higher proportion of its wage 
payments went to employees 
residing in Canadian census 
division areas with weaker 
labour market outcomes, 
and which were particularly 
impacted by the Covid-19 
pandemic.32 In 2021, employees 
living in the 10% of census 
division areas with the:
• highest share of low earners 
received 22% of Drax’s wage 
payments; 33
• lowest rates of youth 
employment received 17% of 
Drax’s wage payments; and
• highest share of the working 
population that suffered a 
significant fall in income (of 
30% or more) through the 
Covid-19 pandemic received 
14% of Drax’s wage payments.
Drax’s commitment to 
its employees and the 
communities in which they 
live is further exemplified by 
the wages it pays to its staff 
living across the length and 
breadth of British Columbia 
and Alberta. This supports 
the wellbeing of staff and 
the economic health of the 
villages, towns, and cities in 
which they live and spend 
their wages in the consumer 
economy. In fact, in each of 
the communities in which Drax 
staff reside, the wages they 
were paid were higher than 
average (Fig. 29). In Greater 
34 Census division areas with fewer than five resident employees omitted for data confidentiality purposes.
Vancouver, British Columbia, 
and Division No. 6, Alberta, 
which includes Calgary, the 
wages paid by the company 
were at least 150% higher than 
the area’s average.
The company’s commitment 
to staff wellbeing is evident 
in Canada. Health and safety 
is a priority at the pellet 
production sites, which are 
all certified to ISO 45001 
standards. In 2021, the 
company committed CA$27 
million to a site-by-site health 
and safety assessment for the 
improvement and continued 
mitigation of health and 
safety risks at the sites. The 
staff at Pinnacle Renewable 
Energy also joined in physical 
wellbeing activities, together 
covering more than 8,500km 
in the summer step challenges, 
having originally aimed to 
cover the equivalent distance 
between the Westview 
Terminal in British Columbia, 
Canada, and the Port in 
Mobile, Alabama, U.S.

APPENDIX: METHODOLOGY
METHODOLOGY FOR 
CAPTURING DIRECT IMPACTS
Data on the direct impact 
of Drax—including its 
contribution to GDP, jobs 
created, and taxes paid by the 
business and its employees—
were provided directly by 
the company. Direct GDP is 
taken to be the sum of total 
employee compensation, 
and earnings (i.e., corporate 
profits) before tax, interest, 
depreciation, and amortisation 
(“EBITDA”). 
METHODOLOGY FOR CAPTURING THE INDIRECT AND 
INDUCED IMPACTS—THE GLOBAL MODELLING APPROACH
To quantify Drax’s total 
indirect (supply chain) and 
induced (wage expenditure) 
impacts in the three countries 
(U.K., U.S., and Canada), 
Oxford Economics used 
a technique called input-
output modelling, first 
developed by the academic 
Wassily Leontief, who won 
a Nobel prize for his work. 
The technique uses national 
accounts data that specify 
how much each industry buys 
from each other industry 
and from other countries in a 
given year. Through a series 
of matrix algebra techniques, 
it is possible to estimate the 
additional economic activity 
that is stimulated from a given 
amount of final demand, where 
in this case final demand is the 
purchases Drax makes from its 
suppliers or Drax’s employees 
make from consumer goods 
and services outlets.
For this analysis, Oxford 
Economics used an input-
output model of the global 
economy, using the latest 
OECD economic and trade 
data as its starting point. A 
basic national input-output 
table gives a snapshot of an 
economy at a given point 
in time, essentially showing 
who buys what from whom 
in the economy. The global 
modelling approach used 
here extends this concept to 
include purchases by each 
industry from industries in 
other countries, as well as 
from other industries in their 
own country. The value of 
purchases of supplies by 
Drax’s global operations was 
provided by the company. 
35 ONS, “U.K. input-output analytical tables”, 2022
36 IMPLAN is an input-output modelling system used to build models at various levels of geography, including national and state. 
IMPLAN is widely used and recognized by government organisations, nonprofits, economic development organizations, workforce 
planners, education institutions, and consultants across the U.S. and Canada.
37 BEA, “GDP by State”; “Employment by State”, 2022
The use of a global model in 
this analysis allowed “feedback 
effects” to be captured, in 
cases where Drax’s imports 
into the countries in question 
include some content originally 
created in that country further 
along the international supply 
chain. The concept is illustrated 
in Fig. 30.
 
 
ESTIMATING SUBNATIONAL IMPACTS
Drax’s Economic impact in 
the U.K.
Oxford Economics put together 
a detailed model of the U.K. 
economy, initially comprising 
105 industries in each of the 12 
standard statistical regions. The 
105 industries are those found in 
the most detailed version of the 
ONS set of U.K. input-output 
(I-O) tables.35 A domestic input-
output table gives a snapshot 
of an economy at a given point 
in time. The model shows the 
major spending flows from 
“final demand” (i.e., consumer 
spending, government 
spending, investment, and 
exports to the rest of the world); 
intermediate spending patterns 
(i.e., what each sector buys 
from every other sector—the 
supply chain in other words); 
how much of that spending 
stays within the domestic/ 
provincial economy; and the 
distribution of income between 
employment income and other 
income (mainly profits). In 
essence, an input-output table 
shows who buys what from 
whom in the economy. 
To estimate Drax’s indirect 
impact in the U.K.’s constituent 
nations and regions, we feed 
in the company’s data on the 
amount spent and type of 
goods and services purchased 
from its U.K. suppliers. 
In order to calculate the 
induced impact, we input the 
information on compensation 
it pays to workers, as provided 
by Drax, which is distributed 
throughout the consumer 
economy using the I-O tables.
Drax’s Economic impact in 
the U.S.
To estimate the indirect and 
induced GDP impacts of Drax 
in the States of Alabama, 
Louisiana, and Mississippi, 
Oxford Economics used 
the IMPLAN economic 
impact models, which are 
based on the entire pattern 
of transactions between 
industrial sectors (as found in 
an input-output table).36
The pattern of Drax’s spending 
by industrial sector and wage 
payments to U.S. workers was 
fed into the IMPLAN economic 
impact models. The gross 
value added, employment, and 
tax impacts were calculated 
within the model, which 
also incorporates the latest 
gross value added-to-output, 
employment-to-output, and 
tax-to-output ratios, on a 
refined industry-by-industry 
basis.
The global modelling 
approach, described above, 
captures trade flows into 
the U.S. from other parts of 
Drax’s global operations. In 
other words, some additional 
economic activity will be 
stimulated in the U.S. by 
Drax’s non-U.S. spending. This 
additional activity is therefore 
distributed among the U.S. 
States using their share 
of the country’s GVA and 
employment, sourced from the 
Bureau of Economic Analysis.37

Drax’s Economic impact in 
Canada
To estimate the indirect 
and induced GDP impacts 
of Drax in the Province of 
British Columbia (BC), Oxford 
Economics used the latest 
available Statistics Canada 
provincial input-output table 
for BC.38 As with the other 
countries, the domestic input-
output table gives a snapshot 
of the economy at a given 
point in time, outlining who 
buys what from whom.
To estimate the indirect 
impact, we used vendor-level 
information on the amount 
spent and type of goods and 
services purchased from BC-
based businesses by Drax. In 
order to calculate the induced 
impact, we took the figures 
for wages paid to workers, 
as provided by Drax, and 
distributed that spending 
to sectors in the consumer 
economy using the BC input-
output table.
