Executive Summary 
 
The archaeological baseline conditions of the Millbrook Power Project site, Bedfordshire, have been 
assessed.  In accordance with government policy (National Policy Statements, National Planning 
Policy Framework), this assessment draws together the available archaeological, historic, 
topographic and land-use information in order to clarify the heritage significance and archaeological 
potential of the Project Site. 
 
The available archaeological, historic, and topographic information indicates that the Project Site 
contains no designated heritage assets. Archaeological evaluation has been undertaken in the west 
of the Project Site and has recorded evidence of possible prehistoric settlement activity and 
evidence for an enclosed Iron Age/Roman settlement either side of a palaeochannel. Undated 
cropmarks of possible archaeological origins are recorded on the Project Site from aerial 
photography.  
 
The proposed Power Generation Plant would be located within a former clay extraction pit (Rookery 
South Pit) which will have removed all archaeological remains within its footprint. On this basis it is 
considered that it is only the Gas and Electrical Connection elements of the Project which may have 
an archaeological impact.  
 
A programme of archaeological mitigation will be undertaken on the Gas Connection and Electrical 
Connection as a Requirement attached to the DCO.  This has principles of this mitigation have 
been agreed with the Central Bedfordshire Council Archaeological Officer during consultations. A 
written scheme of investigation (WSI) would be produced and submitted to the CBC Archaeological 
Officer.  This document will define the scope of works and the methods of excavation and recording 
that will be implemented.  The mitigation will comprise of an archaeological strip, map and sample 
operation on the construction of both the Gas and Electrical Connections.  This will comprise of the 
excavation of the pipe/cable trenches and their construction easement, being stripped 
archaeologically.  Archaeological features exposed will be hand excavated and recorded according 
to a sampling strategy that will be agreed with the CBC Archaeological Officer.  Following 
completion of the fieldwork, the findings will be assessed, analysed and published in full in an 
appropriate academic journal.  These works will be undertaken in accordance with the CIfA 
Standards and Guidance for Excavation and/or Standards and Guidance for an Archaeological 
Watching Brief (CIfA 2017).

Introduction  
 
1.1 
This document is the heritage desk based assessment for the Millbrook Power Project 
(hereafter referred to as the Project). It has been prepared by Orion Heritage on behalf of 
Millbrook Power Ltd. (The Applicant).  
 
1.2 
The Project comprises: 
 
a new Power Generation Plant in the form of an Open Cycle Gas Turbine (OCGT) 
peaking power generating station, fuelled by natural gas with a rated electrical output 
of between 50 and 299 MW.  This is the output of the generating station as a whole, 
measured at the terminals of the generating equipment. The Power Generation Plant 
comprises: 
 
generating equipment including one Gas Turbine Generator with one exhaust gas 
flue stack and Balance of Plant (together referred to as the ‘Generating 
Equipment’), which are located within the ‘Generating Equipment Site’; 
 
a new purpose built access road from Green Lane to the Generating Equipment 
Site (the ‘Access Road’ or ‘short Access Road’);  
 
a temporary construction compound required during construction only (the 
‘Laydown Area’); 
 
a new gas pipeline connection to bring natural gas to the Generating Equipment from 
the National Transmission System (the ‘Gas Connection’). This element incorporates 
an Above Ground Installation (AGI) at the point of connection to the National 
Transmission System. The Gas Connection covers an area of approximately 2.89 
hectares (ha); and 
 
a new electrical connection to export power from the Generating Equipment to the 
National Grid Electricity Transmission System (NETS) (the ‘Electrical Connection’), 
comprising an underground double circuit Tee-in. This would require one new tower 
(which will replace an existing tower and be located in the existing Grendon – Sundon 
transmission route corridor, thereby resulting in no net additional towers). This also 
requires two SECs, one located on each side of the existing transmission line, and both 
circuits would then be connected via underground cables approximately 500 metres in 
length to a new substation (the ‘Substation’). 
 
1.3 
The Electrical Connection covers an area of approximately 4.8 ha. 
 
1.4 
The Generating Equipment, Access Road and Laydown Area are together known as the 
‘Power Generation Plant’ and are located within the ‘Power Generation Plant Site’. The 
Power Generation Plant Site is approximately 12.5 ha in area.  
 
1.5 
The Power Generation Plant Site is located primarily on land within former clay pits known 
as ‘The Rookery’. 
 
1.6 
The ‘study site’ referred to throughout this desk based assessment is defined as the Project 
site and a 1km radius from it (Figure 1). This assessment outlines the baseline heritage 
conditions within the study site so as to inform the assessment of the potential 
archaeological impacts as presented in Chapter 13 of the Environmental Statement (ES).  
 
1.7 
In accordance with government planning policy (NPS EN1, 2, 4 & 5 & NPPF), this desk-
based assessment has been undertaken to establish the presence/absence of designated 
and undesignated assets, to consider the archaeological potential of the study site and to 
assess any impacts from the proposed Project.  
 
1.8 
The centre of the Project site is located at grid reference TL 0183 4013.  The Project site is 
bounded to the north by disused Clay Pits and residential development at 
Stewartby/Wootton Pillinge, to the east by fields, to the south by fields and the village of 
Millbrook, to the south west by a Vehicle Proving Ground, Pillinge Farm South and a 
Country Park 
 
1.9 
In accordance with the Standard and Guidance for Historic Environment Desk Based 
Assessments (Chartered Institute for Archaeologists 2017), the assessment draws together 
available information on designated and non-designated heritage assets, topographic and 
land-use information to establish the potential for non-designated archaeological heritage 
assets within the study site and the potential effect on the significance of nearby designated 
heritage assets. The assessment includes the results of a site survey, an examination of 
published and unpublished records and charts historic land-use through a map regression 
exercise.  Sources utilised include the Bedfordshire Historic Environment Record and the 
Bedford Borough Council Historic Environment Record (HER), the Bedfordshire County 
Archives, and various online sources such as British History on line and the National 
Heritage List of England

1.10 
Data gathering to inform this desk-based assessment has established that no Scheduled 
Monuments, Registered Parks & Gardens or Registered Battlefields lie within   the study 
site. However, there are several undesignated heritage assets recorded within the study 
site. Two Scheduled Monuments (Houghton House and Ampthill Castle) lie to the east of the 
study site. The Ampthill Park Registered Park and Garden lies immediately adjacent to the 
sites south-eastern boundary. 
 
Landform, Topography and Geology 
 
1.11 
The British Geological Survey indicates that the solid geology comprises Oxford clays with 
Kellaway beds in an area known as the Bedford clay vale (BGS Sheet 203: Bedford, 1900). 
The surface disturbance of the area is limited and the soil types are generally calcareous 
clay loams (OS Soil Survey 1968). 
 
1.12 
The drift geology on the study site according to the BGS Survey Sheet comprises strips of 
valley gravel in the south-east and south-west of the study site. A small area of alluvium is 
located in the south-west of the study site.  
 
1.13 
There is no geotechnical data currently available for the study site. However, an 
archaeological evaluation at Rookery Pit South in the centre of the study site recorded 
between 0.3-0.5m of topsoil and subsoil overlying Boulder Clay becoming sandier in the 
westernmost trenches (Albion Archaeology 2011).  
 
1.14 
The majority of the study site occupies a gradual slope from south down to the north within 
Marston Vale.  
 
1.15 
Historically, the natural topography of the study site would have comprised a gradual slope 
down from two highpoints at c. 70m AOD (Above Ordnance Datum) in the south and the 
south-west of the study site, down to c. 50m AOD in the north and north-east of the study 
site, and c. 40m AOD in the extreme north-west of the study site. However, clay extraction 
for brickmaking in the north of the site has significantly altered the sites natural topography. 
The north-west of the study site now occupies two former Clay Pits (Rookery Pit North and 
South), which have been partially backfilled and flooded.  
 
1.16 
A tributary of the River Great Ouse, lies c. 1km west of the study site and flows northwards 
to its confluence with the River Great Ouse, c. 10km to the north-east of the study site.   
 
2.0 
Planning Background and Development Plan Framework 
 
Ancient Monuments & Archaeological Areas Act 1979 
2.1 
The Ancient Monuments & Archaeological Areas Act 1979 (as amended) protects the fabric 
of Scheduled Monuments, but does not afford statutory protection to their settings.  
 
Overarching National Planning Statement for Energy (NPS-EN1) 
2.2 
NPS EN 1 deals specifically with potential impacts of Nationally Significant Infrastructure 
Projects on heritage assets in Section 5.8 which states:  
 
“The level of detail should be proportionate to the importance of the heritage assets and no 
more than is sufficient to understand the potential impact of the proposal on the significance 
of the heritage asset. As a minimum the applicant should have consulted the relevant 
Historic Environment Record120 (or, where the development is in English or Welsh waters, 
English Heritage or Cadw) and assessed the heritage asset themselves using expertise 
where necessary according to the propose development’s impact. 
 
Where a development site includes, or the available evidence suggests it has the potential 
to include, heritage assets with an archaeological interest the applicant should carry out 
appropriate desk-based assessment and, where such desk-based research is insufficient to 
properly assess the interest, a field evaluation”. 
 
National Planning Policy Framework (NPPF) & National Planning Practice Guidance 
(NPPG) 
2.3 
Government policy in relation to the historic environment is outlined in section 12 of the 
National Planning Policy Framework (NPPF), entitled Conserving and Enhancing the 
Historic Environment. This provides guidance for planning authorities, property owners, 
developers and others on the conservation and investigation of heritage assets.   Overall, 
the objectives of Section 12 of the NPPF can be summarised as seeking the: 
Delivery of sustainable development 
 
 
  
 
 
Millbrook Power Project 
Sept 2017 
 
  
 
 
6 
 
Understanding the wider social, cultural, economic and environmental benefits brought 
by the conservation of the historic environment; 
 
Conservation of England's heritage assets in a manner appropriate to their significance, 
and 
 
Recognition of the contribution that heritage assets make to our knowledge and 
understanding of the past. 
 
2.4 
Section 12 of the NPPF recognises that intelligently managed change may sometimes be 
necessary if heritage assets are to be maintained for the long term.  
 
2.5 
Paragraph 128 states that planning decisions should be based on the significance of the 
heritage asset and that level of detail supplied by an applicant should be proportionate to the 
importance of the asset and should be no more than sufficient to understand the potential 
impact of the proposal upon the significance of that asset. 
 
2.6 
Heritage Assets are defined in Annex 2 as: A building, monument, site, place, area or 
landscape identified as having a degree of significance meriting consideration in planning 
decisions, because of its heritage interest. Heritage asset includes designated heritage 
assets and assets identified by the local planning authority (including local listing). 
 
2.7 
Archaeological Interest is defined as a heritage asset which holds or potentially could hold 
evidence of past human activity worthy of expert investigation at some point. Heritage 
assets with archaeological interest are the primary source of evidence about the substance 
and evolution of places, and of the people and cultures that made them. 
 
2.8 
Designated Heritage Assets comprise: World Heritage Sites, Scheduled Monuments, Listed 
Buildings, Protected Wreck Sites, Registered Park and Gardens, Registered Battlefields and 
Conservation Areas. 
 
2.9 
Significance is defined as: The value of a heritage asset to this and future generations 
because of its heritage interest. This interest may be archaeological, architectural, artistic or 
historic. Significance derives not only from a heritage asset’s physical presence, but also 
from its setting. 
 
2.10 
Setting is defined as: The surroundings in which a heritage asset is experienced. Its extent 
is not fixed and may change as the asset and its surroundings evolve. Elements of a setting 
may make a positive or negative contribution to the significance of an asset, may affect the 
ability to appreciate that significance or may be neutral. 
 
2.11 
The NPPF is supported by the National Planning Policy Guidance (NPPG).  In relation to the 
historic environment, paragraph 18a-001 states that: 
“Protecting and enhancing the historic environment is an important component of the 
National Planning Policy Framework’s drive to achieve sustainable development (as defined 
in Paragraphs 6-10). The appropriate conservation of heritage assets forms one of the ‘Core 
Planning Principles’.” 
 
2.12 
Paragraph 18a-002 makes a clear statement that any decisions relating to listed buildings 
and their settings and conservation areas must address the statutory considerations of the 
Planning (Listed Buildings and Conservation Areas) Act 1990 as well as satisfying the 
relevant policies within the National Planning Policy Framework and the Local Plan. 
 
2.13 
Paragraph 18a-013 outlines that the assessment of the impact of a proposed development 
on the setting of a heritage asset needs to take into account and be proportionate to the 
significance of the asset being considered and the degree to which the proposed 
development enhances or detracts from the significance of the asset and the ability to 
appreciate the significance. 
 
2.14 
The NPPG outlines that although the extent and importance of setting is often expressed in 
visual terms, it can also be influenced by other factors such as noise, dust and vibration.  
Historic relationships between places can also be an important factor stressing ties between 
places that may have limited or no intervisibility with each other. This may be historic as well 
as aesthetic connections that contribute or enhance the significance of one or more of the 
heritage assets. 
 
2.15 
Paragraph 18a-013 concludes: 
“The contribution that setting makes to the significance of the heritage asset does not 
depend on there being public rights or an ability to access or experience that setting. This 
will vary over time and according to circumstance.  When assessing any application for 
development which may affect the setting of a heritage asset, local planning authorities may 
need to consider the implications of cumulative change. They may also need to consider the 
 
 
  
 
 
Millbrook Power Project 
Sept 2017 
 
  
 
 
7 
fact that developments which materially detract from the asset’s significance may also 
damage its economic viability now, or in the future, thereby threatening its on-going 
conservation.” 
 
2.16 
The key test in NPPF paragraphs 132-134 is whether a proposed development will result in 
substantial harm or less than substantial harm. However, substantial harm is not defined in 
the NPPF. Paragraph 18a-017 of the NPPG provides additional guidance on substantial 
harm.  It states: 
“What matters in assessing if a proposal causes substantial harm is the impact on the 
significance of the heritage asset. As the National Planning Policy Framework makes clear, 
significance derives not only from a heritage asset’s physical presence, but also from its 
setting. Whether a proposal causes substantial harm will be a judgment for the decision 
taker, having regard to the circumstances of the case and the policy in the National Planning 
Policy Framework. In general terms, substantial harm is a high test, so it may not arise in 
many cases. For example, in determining whether works to a listed building constitute 
substantial harm, an important consideration would be whether the adverse impact seriously 
affects a key element of its special architectural or historic interest. It is the degree of harm 
to the asset’s significance rather than the scale of the development that is to be assessed.” 
 
2.17 
Paragraph 134 of the NPPF outlines that where a proposed development results in less than 
substantial harm to the significance of a heritage asset, the harm arising should be weighed 
against the public benefits accruing from the proposed development. Paragraph 18a-020 of 
the NPPG outlines what is meant by public benefits: 
“Public benefits may follow from many developments and could be anything that delivers 
economic, social or environmental progress as described in the National Planning Policy 
Framework (Paragraph 7). Public benefits should flow from the proposed development. 
They should be of a nature or scale to be of benefit to the public at large and should not just 
be a private benefit. However, benefits do not always have to be visible or accessible to the 
public in order to be genuine public benefits.” 
 
2.18 
In considering any planning application for development, the planning authority will be 
mindful of the framework set by government policy, in this instance, primarily NPS as 
decision will be made by the SoS.  
 
Local Planning Policy 
2.19 
The Central Bedfordshire LDF Core Strategy and Development Management Policies 
(Adopted December 2009) contains the following policy relating to the historic environment: 
 
Policy CS15 Heritage 
The Council will: 
 
Protect, conserve and enhance the district’s heritage including its Listed Buildings, 
Scheduled Ancient Monuments, Conservation Areas, Registered Parks and Gardens 
and archaeology and their setting. 
 
Conserve and where appropriate enhance the quality and integrity of the local built and 
natural environment, including historic structures or open green spaces considered to 
be of special local interest. 
 
Designate and keep under review Conservation Areas in order to protect or enhance 
their special architectural or historic interest. This will include the implementation of an 
on-going programme of Conservation Area Character Appraisals to include a review of 
their special interest and boundaries. 
 
Monitor and survey the condition of Listed Buildings and periodically review and update 
a Register of Buildings at Risk, providing appropriate grant assistance to encourage 
their essential sympathetic repair. 
 
2.20 
The Bedford Borough Council Core Strategy and Rural Issues Plan Development Plan 
Document (adopted April 2008) contains the following policy relating to the historic 
environment: 
 
POLICY CP23 – Heritage 
Development will be required to protect and where appropriate enhance: 
i. 
the character of conservation areas, scheduled ancient monuments, historic parks 
and gardens, listed buildings and other important historic or archaeological features; 
and, 
ii. 
the Borough’s cultural assets, including its landscape, in order to underpin sense of 
place, cultural identity and promote quality of life.

The purpose of this document is to provide information to assist local authorities, planning 
and other consultants, owners, applicants and other interested parties in implementing 
historic environment policy in the NPPF and NPPG.  It outlines a 6-stage process to the 
assembly and analysis of relevant information relating to heritage assets potentially affected 
by a proposed development. 
 
 
Understand the significance of the affected assets; 
 
Understand the impact of the proposal on that significance; 
 
Avoid, minimise and mitigate impact in a way that meets the objectives of the NPPF; 
 
Look for opportunities to better reveal or enhance significance 
 
Justify any harmful impacts in terms of the sustainable development objective of 
conserving significance and the need for change; 
 
Offset negative impacts on aspects of significance by enhancing others through 
recording, disseminating and archiving archaeological and historical interest of the 
important elements of the heritage assets affected. 
 
Historic Environment Good Practice Advice In Planning Note 3 The Setting of Heritage 
Assets (Historic England  2015) 
2.22 
Historic England’s Historic Environment Good Practice Advice in Planning Note 3 provides 
guidance on the management of change within the setting of heritage assets.    
 
2.23 
The document restates the definition of setting as outlined in Annex 2 of the NPPF.  Setting 
is also described as being a separate term to curtilage, character and context; while it is 
largely a visual term, setting, and thus the way in which an asset is experienced, can also be 
affected by noise, vibration, odour and other factors. The document makes it clear that 
setting is not a heritage asset, nor is it a heritage designation, though land within a setting 
may itself be designated.   Its importance lies in what the setting contributes to the 
significance of a heritage asset. 
 
2.24 
The Good Practice Advice Note sets out a five-staged process for assessing the implications 
of proposed developments on setting: 
 
1. Identification of heritage assets which are likely to be affected by proposals;  
2. Assessment of whether and what contribution the setting makes to the significance of a 
heritage asset;  
3. Assessing the effects of proposed development on the significance of a heritage asset;  
4. Maximising enhancement and reduction of harm on the setting of heritage assets; and 
5. Making and documenting the decision and monitoring outcomes 
 
2.25 
The guidance reiterates the NPPF in stating that where developments affecting the setting of 
heritage assets results in a level of harm to significance, this harm, whether substantial or 
less then substantial, should be weighed against the public benefits of the scheme.

Archaeological and Historical Background  
 
3.1 
Examination of data in the Central Bedfordshire and Bedford Borough Historic Environment 
Records (HER) within the study site, and documentary evidence from the parishes of 
Marston Moretaine, Houghton Conquest and Ampthill in the County Records Office has 
been consulted. Several non-designated archaeological assets are recorded within the study 
site itself. Two Scheduled Monuments (Houghton House and Ampthill Castle) are located to 
the east of the study site. The Ampthill Park Registered Park and Garden lies to the sites 
south-eastern boundary of the study site.  The location of sites mentioned in the text are 
shown in Fig. 2 (relevant HER record numbers are quoted in brackets in the text below and 
also shown in Fig. 2). 
 
3.2 
Evidence of archaeological finds in the vicinity of the study site is varied. In the past, the 
Oxford clays of the Marston Vale have been described as a significant gap in terms of 
archaeological evidence.  However recent works and aerial photography since the late 
1990s has begun to redress the balance. The archaeology of Bedfordshire, has recently 
been presented in the Research and Archaeology: Resource Assessment Research Agenda 
and Strategy (Oake et al., 2007).  
 
3.3 
Archaeological investigations have been undertaken within the study site comprising an 
Archaeological Evaluation (Albion Archaeology, 2011) (Appendix 1), and an aerial 
photograph assessment (Palmer 2011). The aerial photograph assessment identified 
cropmarks of potentially archaeological origin within the study site. Archaeological 
evaluation in the west of the study site recorded an enclosed late Iron Age/Roman 
settlement and a possible prehistoric settlement either side of a former stream channel.  
 
3.4 
A number of cropmarks are identified from aerial photographs as representing prehistoric 
and Romano-British settlement sites on the HER within the study area. However, the recent 
archaeological evaluation in the west of the study site did not record any correlation between 
the plotted cropmarks and excavated features, suggesting the cropmarks were non-
archaeological in origin (Albion 2011). 
 
Non-Designated Heritage Assets (Figure 2) 
 
Prehistoric 
3.5 
There are no Palaeolithic finds recorded on the HER within the study area.  
 
3.6 
A Mesolithic flint flake was found through fieldwalking c. 2km to the south of the study site 
(7468). Two Mesolithic flint blades were found during evaluation work on the Willington to 
Steppingley Gas Pipeline 1.4km to the south-east of the study site (7485 & 7486). 
 
3.7 
A large collection of prehistoric flints including Mesolithic, Neolithic and Bronze Age flints 
were recovered by a local amateur archaeologist between 1969 and 2000 to the south-east 
of the study site, c. 2.4km to the south-east (18269). 
 
3.8 
The cropmark of an isolated ring ditch on the top of a small hillock is recorded on the HER in 
the south-west of the study site, adjacent to the Millbrook Proving Ground (MNN16566).  
 
3.9 
A probable prehistoric roundhouse was recorded during the evaluation in the west of the 
study site although no dating evidence was recorded (see Appendix 1).  
 
3.10 
No evidence of Palaeolithic, Mesolithic or Neolithic activity was recorded during the 
archaeological evaluation in the south west of the study site. Overall the sites potential for 
the early prehistoric periods is therefore considered to be low.  
 
3.11 
Overall, taking the above into consideration, along with professional judgement, the 
likelihood of evidence of Bronze Age activity being found on the study site is considered to 
be moderate, and high in the west of the study site in the area of the probable ring ditch.  
 
Iron Age and Roman 
3.12 
The archaeological evaluation in the west of the study site recorded an enclosed Iron Age-
Roman settlement which was bordered by a palaeochannel that was possibly contemporary, 
within the study site (Appendix 1) (Albion 2011) (19806).  
 
3.13 
Extensive archaeological remains were recently discovered at the Millennium Country Park, 
Marston c. 1.km north-west of the study site, where a late Iron Age/early Roman farmstead 
was recorded (17715). In addition, an archaeological evaluation to the north-east of the 
study site on Stewartby Way, has recorded an Iron Age farmstead (Albion 2010).

3.14 
Excavations ahead of the construction of a pipeline crossing the south-east of the study site 
recorded pits and ditches of early to middle Iron Age date (18169). 
 
3.15 
A Roman road identified by Viatores in 1964 as No 170b crosses the south-west part of the 
study site, but there is no physical archaeological evidence to suggest there was a Roman 
road in this area (5020). 
 
3.16 
A scatter of Roman pottery was found during fieldwalking at How End, c. 1.5km east of the 
study site, and subsequently a cropmark indicating an enclosure was recorded at the same 
location and is thought to be Roman (2425). 
 
3.17 
Several Roman find spots are recorded within the study area found by metal detector 
including a Roman coin (18358), twenty-four Roman coins, three brooches and a knife found 
in How End, c.2.2km to the north east of the study site (18517), a Roman coin found south-
east of Ampthill Park House, c.2km to the south-east of the study site (18765). 
 
3.18 
Several areas of undated cropmarks are recorded on the study site from aerial photography 
(4469) and (9077). 
 
3.19 
The presence of an enclosed Romano-British settlement on the study site suggests that the 
general area was likely to have formed an agricultural landscape with farmsteads sited along 
the tributary of the River Ouse during the Iron Age and Roman periods. 
 
Anglo-Saxon and Medieval 
3.20 
Archaeological excavations at the Millennium Country Park, Marston c. 1.km north-west of 
the study site, recorded evidence for Saxon settlement in two areas (17715). One comprised 
large groups of intercutting pits near to the southerly Iron Age to Roman settlement. The pits 
may have had an industrial use but were backfilled with domestic waste. The southern 
settlement focus produced a large number of postholes believed to indicate fence lines.  
 
3.21 
Evidence for Saxon settlement comprising structural remains including possible beam slots 
and evidence of partitions were found during a trial trenching exercise in 2009, in Ampthill 
Park, c. 1.7km from the centre of the study site (18265). 
 
3.22 
The earliest reference to a settlement at Marston is from AD 969 regarding the boundary of 
the men of Marston (Mercstuninga gemœre). The Doomsday Survey of 1086 refers to the 
overlordship of Marston Manor. 
 
3.23 
During the medieval period the study site lay south-east of the village of Marston. The 
majority of the study site lies within the parish of Marston Moretaine. The south-east of the 
study site lies within the parish of Ampthill and the north-east of the study site lies within the 
parish of Houghton Conquest.  
 
3.24 
Evidence of arable agriculture in the form of ridge and furrow is recorded on the HER within 
the study area recorded from aerial photography. Within the study site itself cropmarks 
indicate a possible medieval field system in the south of the study site indicating that the site 
was in agricultural use during the Medieval period (14743).   
 
3.25 
A possible medieval moated site is recorded immediately north-west of the study site at 
Pillinge Farm South, represented by a square arrangement of ditches surrounding an 
orchard, on the western site boundary (3270).  
 
3.26 
No evidence for Saxon or medieval activity was recorded during the archaeological 
evaluation in the west of the study site. Accordingly, a taking the above into consideration, 
along with professional judgement, generally low potential is identified for settlement or other 
significant remains of these periods, and a moderate potential is identified for evidence of 
early medieval agricultural activity. 
 
Late Medieval and Post-Medieval  
3.27 
The scheduled monument of Ampthill Castle is located c. 1km south-east of the study site 
(SM No 1009630). The monument includes the remains of a 15th century palace, which is 
situated at the top of the north-facing scarp of the Greensand ridge. The approximate site of 
the palace is marked by Katherine's Cross, erected in the 1770's to commemorate Katherine 
of Aragon who lived for a time at the palace. Although there are no upstanding walls, there 
exists a detailed survey of the palace precinct drawn up in 1534 which enables the plan and 
extent of the ruins to be ascertained. The main precinct comprised four wings ranged about 
a rectangular inner court, with a gatehouse on the east wing and kitchens and a great hall 
on the north.

3.28 
Ampthill Park situated c. 1.7km south-east of the study site is a Registered Park and Garden 
and comprises a 17th/18th century country house surrounded by a landscape park by 
Lancelot Brown dating between 1771-2 (RPG No 1000378). Ampthill Great Park was 
originally a deer park surrounding Ampthill Castle. Having become royal property, the castle 
and parks were used by Henry VIII, who paid frequent visits between 1524 and 1532, and by 
Katherine of Aragon in the early 1530s during the divorce proceedings with Henry. The 
castle was ruinous by the end of the 16th century (VCH) and the present Park House was 
built in the late 17th century to replace the Great Lodge.  
 
3.29 
The Scheduled Monument of Houghton House lies c. 1km east of the study site (SM No 
1013522). The house typifies conventional late 16th and early 17th century design. 
Houghton House therefore represents an important transitional period between Elizabethan 
and Jacobean architecture, and the neo-Classicism which was to follow. The past owners 
and occupiers of the house are well documented, and in the case of Mary, the Dowager 
Countess, the biographical details provide insights into the development of the design. The 
significance of the structural remains is increased rather than reduced by the limited period 
of occupation, since the house has no significant later alterations or elaboration. 
 
3.30 
The Jeffreys Map of 1765 (Fig. 3) and the Ordnance Survey map of 1815 (Fig. 4) show the 
study site lying within fields between settlements at Wootton Pillinge in the north, How End 
to the east, Millbrook to the south and Marston Pillinge to the west. A lane is shown crossing 
the east of the site on the line of Marston Road linking Millbrook and How End.  
 
3.31 
Further detail is shown on the 1808 Ampthill Inclosure Map and the 1809 Houghton 
Conquest Inclosure Map which show the east of the study site occupying fields.  
 
3.32 
The Marston Moretaine Tithe Map and Award of 1843 shows the study site occupied by 
Grass fields and Arable fields.  
 
3.33 
The Ordnance Survey map of 1883 shows the study site occupied by fields with the newly 
constructed London & North Western Railway bounding the north-west of the study site, and 
the Midland Railway bounding the south eastern study site boundary (Fig. 5).  
 
3.34 
No significant changes are shown to have occurred at the study site between 1901 and 
1960 (Figs. 6-9).  
 
3.35 
Two former clay extraction pits (Rookery Pits) are located in the north of the study site 
(6681). The remains of the former conveyor line survive in the north-west of the study site, 
mainly evidenced by concrete plinths along the former route, but also as a conveyor bridge 
crossing over the railway line close to Green Lane (Figs. 10 & 11).  From 1999 the disused 
Clay Pits in the north of the study site were shown as flooded (Figs 12-14).  
 
3.36 
Overall, taking the above into consideration, along with professional judgement, the 
archaeological potential of the study site for late medieval and post-medieval evidence is 
confined to any remains of former field boundaries and any structures associated with the 
20th century clay extraction pits.

Site Conditions and Heritage Constraints  
 
Site Conditions 
4.1 
The north of the site is occupied by The Rookery, comprising two large former clay pits, 
Rookery North and Rookery South Pits, separated by an east-west spine of unexcavated 
clay (Fig. 17). The remainder of the site occupies undulating agricultural land. 
 
4.2 
The excavation of clay extraction pits in the north of the study site, would have had 
completely removed archaeological deposits within the limits of the pits themselves.  
 
4.3 
Partial backfilling of the pits has been undertaken and engineered fill has been placed 
against their sides in areas where the current slope gradients require additional buttressing 
works in order to ensure that long-term stability can be maintained. 
 
4.4 
The power generation plant will be located within Rookery Pit which is a former brickworks 
clay extraction site with the associated Gas Connection and Electrical Connection extending 
from The Rookery into adjacent agricultural land to the south. 
 
Impact on Archaeological Heritage Assets 
4.5 
The proposed development would not directly impact any designated heritage assets. 
However, an archaeological evaluation has recorded undesignated heritage assets 
comprising possible prehistoric and late Iron Age/Roman settlements within the study site 
(Appendix 2).  
 
4.6 
The proposed Power Generation Plant would be unlikely to have an archaeological impact 
due to its location within a former clay extraction pit. However, the proposed Electrical and 
Gas connections could have an archaeological impact through the cutting of footings and 
services, and construction groundworks.  
 
4.7 
A programme of archaeological mitigation will be undertaken on the Gas & Electrical 
Connection as a requirement attached to the DCO.  The principle of this mitigation has been 
agreed with the Central Bedfordshire Council Archaeological Officer during consultations.  
Following the granting of planning permission, a written scheme of investigation (WSI) will 
be produced and submitted to the CBC Archaeological Officer.  This document will define 
the scope of works and the methods of excavation and recording that will be implemented.  
The mitigation will comprise of an archaeological strip, map and sample operation on the 
construction of both the Gas and Electrical Connections.  This will comprise of the 
excavation of the pipe/cable trenches and their construction easement, being stripped 
archaeologically.  Archaeological features exposed will be hand excavated archaeologically 
and recorded according to a sampling strategy that will be agreed with the CBC 
Archaeological Officer.  Following completion of the fieldwork, the findings will be assessed, 
analysed and published in full in an appropriate academic journal.  These works will be 
undertaken in accordance with the CIfA Standards and Guidance for Excavation and/or 
Standards and Guidance for an Archaeological Watching Brief (CIfA 2017).

Summary & Conclusions 
 
5.1 
This desk-based assessment considers the site of the Proposed Millbrook Power Project at 
Rookery South Pit, near Millbrook, Bedfordshire.    In accordance with government policy 
(National Planning Statements and National Planning Policy Framework), this assessment 
draws together the available archaeological, historic, topographic and land-use information 
in order to clarify the heritage significance and archaeological potential of the site.  
 
5.2 
Recent archaeological investigations on the study site have recorded the presence of 
possible prehistoric settlement activity and a late Iron Age/Roman enclosed settlement in the 
west of the study site. Evidence of medieval ridge and furrow has also been recorded in the 
south of the study site.  
 
5.3 
The north of the study site is occupied by two 20th century clay extraction pits, these would 
have removed all archaeological potential within the limits of their extents. Post-medieval 
and modern ploughing are likely to have had a superficial but widespread archaeological 
impact on the remaining arable land.  
 
5.4 
The proposed Power Generation Plant would be unlikely to have an archaeological impact 
due to its location within a former clay extraction pit. However, the proposed Electrical and 
Gas connections in the east and west of the study site could have an archaeological impact 
through the cutting of footings and services, and construction groundworks.  
 
5.5 
A programme of archaeological mitigation will be undertaken on the Gas Connection as a 
requirement attached to the DCO.  This principle of this mitigation has been agreed with the 
Central Bedfordshire Council Archaeological Officer during consultations.  Following the 
granting of the DCO, a written scheme of investigation (WSI) will be produced and submitted 
to the CBC Archaeological Officer.  This document will define the scope of works and the 
methods of excavation and recording that will be implemented.  The mitigation will comprise 
of an archaeological strip, map and sample operation on the construction of both the Gas 
and Electrical Connections.  This will comprise of the excavation of the pipe/cable trenches 
and their construction easement, being stripped archaeologically.  Archaeological features 
exposed will be hand excavated archaeologically and recorded according to a sampling 
strategy that will be agreed with the CBC Archaeological Officer.  Following completion of 
the fieldwork, the findings will be assessed, analysed and published in full in an appropriate 
academic journal.  These works will be undertaken in accordance with the CIfA Standards 
and Guidance for Excavation and/or Standards and Guidance for an Archaeological 
Watching Brief (CIfA 2017).

There will be no effect on the ability to 
understand or appreciate the historic interest of 
the house. 
Views: 
No designed views. The house faces 
west 
toward 
the 
Pillinge 
Farmyard 
complex of modern barns and other 
buildings.  Views to the south east and 
north are restricted by tall trees and 
other vegetation.   
The stack of the Power Generation Plant will be 
visible to the east of the house through the 
trees.  In summer, views will be largely 
restricted by the leaves but in winter, the 
stacks will be more visible but views will be 
significantly filtered. 
The Gas and Electrical Connections will have no 
effect on views in towards or out from the 
farmhouse. 
Setting: The farmhouse is located within a garden on all 
sides with outhouses on its northern side.  The garden is 
bounded by tall trees and other vegetation on its eastern 
north and southern sides. The house faces a modern farm 
complex of barns and other agricultural buildings on its 
western side beyond which there is a line of tall trees.  The 
house is approached along a drive from the road which 
passes through a narrow gate into an area of grassland 
leading to the farmhouse and farmyard.  The effect of this 
and the trees that encloses the farm and farmyard, is to 
create an area which feels ‘cut off’ from its surrounding area 
which comprises the Rookery Pit and other disused pits, the 
Ampthill Testing Circuit and the railway and railway station.  
The area of the setting that has a positive 
contribution to the significance of the house will 
be unaffected by the Project.  However, the 
stack of the Power Generation Plant will be at 
least partially visible to the east of the house.  
Therefore, there will be a change within the 
area immediately to the east of the setting of 
the house.  The Rookery Pit area has already 
lost its historical connection with the farmhouse 
through the loss of associated farmland.   
There has been a noise survey undertaken at 
South Pillinge Farm which has established that 
there will be no noise effects on the setting (see

2 Reports results of following a strict ‘matrix’ based approach.  
The effect of these features is to have removed the 
agricultural land in the area of the farm thereby removing the 
historic connection between the farm and its land.  Therefore, 
the setting only has a positive contribution to the house’s 
significance in the immediate surroundings of the house.

The historic interest of the house has already 
been reduced by the loss of its former 
agricultural land and the Project will not result 
in any further loss of this aspect of the 
significance.   Therefore, there will be a minor

Mitigation:

Setting: The house is located within gardens which in turn is 
located within Ampthill Park Registered Park and Garden.  
The house is approached along a track from the north east off 
which its driveway comes at the front of the house. To the 
rear of the house is a block of woodland that extends back 
through the registered park.  The house is located in a raised 
position which allows for extensive views over the countryside 
to the north west, west and north.  These views extend as far 
as the higher ground to the north west of Marston Moritaine 
and the A421 c. 5km away.   
The gardens of the house and Ampthill Park have a very 
strong positive contribution to the significance of the house 
due to their historical associations and the aesthetic 
experience of the house.  The views over the countryside to 
the north west of the house also have a positive contribution 
to the significance of the house as it was built, in part, for this 
view.  However, this view contains a significant quantity of 
modern industrial and transport related structures within it, 
such as the two railways along which trains can be seen and 
heard passing by the house, Marston Vale wind turbine, 
Stewartby chimneys and electricity pylons.   
The top of the stack of the Power Generation 
Plant will be visible in the distance to the north 
west of the house.  They will form a new 
element within the setting.  However, they are 
located at nearly 2km distance and will be 
experienced within the context of other tall 
industrial structures in the same part of the 
periphery of the setting.  The other existing 
industrial structures will appear significantly 
taller than the Power Generation Plant’s stack.  
Consequently, 
due 
to 
the 
stack 
being 
experienced as part of, and a subservient 
element 
of, 
industrial 
structures 
located 
towards the periphery of the setting. Therefore, 
as the Project will be a minor magnitude of 
change of a similar nature to existing structures 
in the same peripheral part of the setting which 
has a limited contribution to the significance of 
the house.   
The transmission tower will be visible from the 
house but this is a replacement of an existing 
pylon and so has no additional effect. The SEC  
will not be visible from the house.   
The Gas Connection will have no effects on the 
setting of the house. 
 
 
Significance: National significance. 
Minor effect on the contribution that the setting 
provides to the significance of the house.

The Power Generation Plant stacks will be

they will be significantly lower than the 
chimneys.    
Setting: Kilns and chimneys are located within former 
brickworks which form its setting and it is within this area 
that the setting has a very strong positive contribution to the 
significance of the listed structures.   The wider countryside 
also forms part of the setting where the chimneys act as a 
landmark feature.  This provides limited positive contribution 
to the significance of the kilns and chimneys.  
The stack of Power Generation Plant will be 
visible in views of the chimneys.  The industrial 
and functional nature of the chimneys and 
stacks are essentially the same as is their 
architectural 
form. 
 
They 
are

owned 
considerable 
land 
in 
Bedfordshire in the 14th and 15th 
centuries. After Almaric's death in 1430, 
the manor passed to Lord Fanhope of 
Ampthill Castle, although part of the 
estate was retained by Alianor until her 
death 
in 
1467; 
and 
it 
has 
been 
suggested that Alianor's residence stood 
on the site of Houghton House. Dame 
Ellensbury Park, together with Ampthill 
Park, later passed to the crown and 
became a royal hunting territory. In 
1606, James I visited the area and 
commissioned the architect John Thorpe 
to draw up plans for the reconstruction 
of Ampthill Castle. This project was 
abandoned, and it is thought that the 
architect was subsequently re-directed 
to design Houghton House. In 1615 
James granted the house to Mary 
Herbert, Countess Dowager of Kent and 
it is thought that she commissioned 
Inigo Jones to design the neo-Classical 
loggias 
for 
the 
north 
and 
west 
entrances. The house reverted to the 
crown after her death in 1621, and was 
later granted to Thomas Bruce, Earl of 
Elgin. Thomas's son Robert, 1st Earl of 
Ailesbury, succeeded to the property 
after the restoration of the monarchy in 
1660, and was in turn succeeded by his 
son, Thomas, who went into exile with 
James II in 1688. In 1738, Thomas's 
heir sold the property to the 4th Duke of 
Bedford. The duke's son, the Marquis of 
Tavistock, lived there from 1764 until his 
death in a hunting accident in 1767. In 
1794 the Duke of Bedford ordered the 
house to be un-roofed and partially 
dismantled, with some items taken for 
reuse 
elsewhere. 
The 
remaining 
structure was abandoned until 1923, 
when it was purchased with a view to 
preservation by the Bedford Arts Club.

Views: 
The monument is located on the hills to

the lower lying land to the north west, 
north and west.  There are extensive 
views from the house across the lower 
lying ground. There are views of the 
house along the high ground on which it 
is located from the south west and the 
north east and there also views up 
toward the house from the lower lying 
area to the west, north west and north 
of the house.    
The Power Generation Plant stack will be visible 
in the distance from ruins of the house to the 
west (Viewpoint 4).  In these views, the stacks 
will be experienced in the context of other tall 
industrial structures such as Marston Vale wind 
turbine, the Stewartby chimneys and the 
electricity pylons that are located to the south 
of the Power Generation Plant, all of which will 
be at an apparent similar distance to the north 
west of the house. The new Transmission Tower 
(which is a replacement of an existing pylon) 
and possibly the top of the SEC compound may 
be visible in certain places within and around 
the house. 
The stack will also be visible in views of the 
house along the high ground on which the 
house is located.  As with views from the 
house, there are other tall industrial structures 
at a similar apparent distance from the house. 
Views toward the house from the north west, 
west and north will be unaffected. 
Setting: The monument is located on the edge of high 
ground within an area of grassland.  It is approached from 
the south east along a footpath that is lined by trees.  The 
house is located in a raised position which allows for 
extensive views over the countryside to the north west, west 
and north.  These views extend as far as the higher ground to

Proposed 
Development, due 
to its smaller size, 
Historic 
interest: 
The palace was built in the early 1400's 
by 
Sir 
John 
Cornwall, 
later 
Lord 
Fanhope. He married Elizabeth, sister of 
Henry IV, and wanted a residence `Meet 
for his Royal spouse'. The palace came 
into the hands of Henry VIII in 1524 and 
Katherine of Aragon lived there during 
the divorce proceedings of 1533. The 
buildings had already fallen into decay 
by 1555 and at the time of the 1567 
survey 
its 
partial 
demolition 
was 
planned. Final demolition took place 
before 1649.  
There will be no effect on the ability to 
understand or appreciate the historic interest of 
the monument. 
Archaeological 
interest: 
Remains of a 15th century palace.  The 
approximate site of the palace is marked 
There will be no effect on the ability to 
understand or appreciate the historic interest of 
by Katherine's Cross, erected in the 
1770's to commemorate Katherine of 
Aragon who lived for a time at the 
palace. 
Although 
there 
are 
no 
upstanding walls, there exists a detailed 
survey of the palace precinct drawn up 
in 1534 which enables the plan and 
extent of the ruins to be ascertained. 
The main precinct comprised four wings 
ranged about a rectangular inner court, 
with a gatehouse on the east wing and 
kitchens and a great hall on the north. 
Outside the north wing was a smaller 
court which contained a well-house. To 
the east and south the palace was 
surrounded by an outer, or `Base', Court 
which had a range of buildings at the 
perimeter 
which 
contained 
stables, 
workshops 
and 
other 
rooms 
which 
housed the ancillary functions of the 
palace. Using the known plan as a guide, 
the remains of the palace can be traced 
on the ground. At the crest of the ridge 
is a rectangular platform which is the 
site of the Inner Court. Katherine's Cross 
is located on this platform. Between the 
north edge of the platform and the edge 
of the steeply sloping natural scarp is a 
terrace which accommodated the well-
house court. The eastern edge of the 
Base Court ran about 50m to the west of 
the 
platform, 
diagonally across 
the 
present Rugby field, and its southern 
side is considered to lie at the break of 
slope of the scarp above the car park 
fence. The route of an original access 
into the Base Court from Woburn Road is 
marked by a gully leading up this scarp. 
This scarp and the steep slope to the 
west of the palace are likely to have 
been 
terraced,

to

and 
effectively part of 
Covanta. 
Consequently,   
the combined and 
cumulative effects 
of 
the 
two 
schemes 
are 
considered to be 
a 
moderate 
impact, the vast 
majority of which 
will derive from 
Covanta. 
Mitigation: 
None 
Artistic 
interest: 
No known artistic interest. 
No effect. 
Views: 
The monument is located within Ampthill 
Park and there are views across the 
southern and western part of the park. 
The northern edge of the monument is 
close to the top of the ridge along which 
the park is located.   From this limited 
part 
of 
the 
monument 
there 
are 
extensive views across the lower lying 
ground.  
The Power Generation Plant stack will just be 
visible in the distance from along the north 
eastern  edge of the SAM.  In these views, the 
stack will be experienced in the context of other 
tall industrial structures such as Marston Vale 
wind turbine (Viewpoint 3 shows that the 
Project 
will 
be 
experienced 
as 
being 
immediately ‘below’ the wind turbine from that 
location), the Stewartby chimneys and the 
electricity pylons that are located to the south 
of the Power Generation Plant, all of which will 
be at an apparent similar distance to the north 
west of the SAM. 
The stack will also be visible in views of the 
SAM along the high ground on which the house 
is located.  As with views from the house, there 
are other tall industrial structures at a similar 
apparent distance from the SAM. 
The Electricity and Gas Connections will not be 
visible.  The new Transmission Tower may be 
visible in some limited places but as a 
replacement for an existing pylon wo will 
appear the same as now. 
Setting: The monument is within Ampthill Registered Park 
and Garden which forms the core of its setting and it is within 
this area that the setting has a very strong positive 
contribution to the significance of the SAM.    As described 
above, the northern edge of the SAM has extensive views 
over the countryside to the north west, west and north. 
These views extend as far as the higher ground to the north 
west of Marston Moritaine and the A421 c. 5km away.  These 
views over the countryside to the north west of the SAM have 
a positive contribution to the significance of the SAM as the 
castle was built, in part, for this view.  However, this view 
contains a significant quantity of modern industrial and 
transport related structures within it, such as the two railways 
along which trains can be seen and heard passing by the 
house, Marston Vale wind turbine, Stewartby chimneys and 
electricity pylons.   
The stack of Power Generation Plant will be 
visible in the distance to the north west of the 
northern eastern edge of the SAM.  They will 
form a new element within this part of the 
setting.  However, they are located at nearly 
2km distance and will be experienced within the 
context of other tall industrial structures in the 
same part of the periphery of the setting.  The 
other existing industrial structures will appear 
significantly taller than the Power Generation 
Plant’s stack.  Consequently, due to the stacks 
being experienced as part of, and a subservient 
element 
of, 
industrial 
structures 
located 
towards the periphery of the setting, the 
presence of the stack will   that provides only a 
limited contribution to the significance of the 
SAM, especially as the stacks will not be 
experienced from within the majority of the 
SAM 
at 
all. 
Therefore, 
as 
the 
Proposed 
development will be a minor magnitude of 
change of a similar nature to exiting structures 
in a peripheral part of the setting which has a 
limited contribution to the significance of the 
SAM.   
The Gas and Electrical Connections will have no 
effects on the setting of the house. 
 
 
Significance: National significance. 
Minor effect on the contribution that a small 
and peripheral part of the setting provides to 
the significance of the SAM. Therefore, there 
will be a negligible impact on the significance of 
the SAM.

are blocked by the topography and by 
trees to the west. 
The Project will not be visible as the barrow is 
on the edge of the ZTV and the trees of Lings 
Wood to the west of the barrow will block views 
of the Project.  
Setting: The setting of the barrow is   hillside on which it is 
located.  It would have been built both to the seen from and 
to overlook the lower-lying land to the north and so the lower 
land also forms part of its setting which has a strong positive 
contribution to the significance of the barrow as it 
demonstrates the nature of the deliberate placing of the 
monument.   
Setting: Although in the ZTV, the Project will 
not be visible from the barrow or in views of the 
barrow.  Therefore, it will have no effect on the 
setting.

Table 2 presents the assessment of the setting, significance and impact of the Proposed Development of registered parks and 
gardens and conservation areas.  Ampthill Park and Ampthill Conservation Area have been assessed together.  The reason form 
this is that the only part of the conservation area that is within the ZTV of the Proposed Development lies within the Registered 
Park and Garden which extends further into the ZTV than the conservation area does.   
 
The very south eastern tip of Stewartby Conservation Area is within the very edge of the ZTV.  This is an area of open space.  The 
Project will not be visible within any of the built up area of the Conservation Area and so the character of the village will not be 
affected in any way.

Ampthill 
Great 
Park, 
originally 
a 
deer 
park, 
surrounded Ampthill Castle, which was built in the 
early 15th century by Sir John Cornwall, lord of 
Ampthill Manor; Ampthill Little Park lay south of the 
Ampthill to Woburn road. Having become royal 
property, the castle and parks were used by Henry 
VIII, who paid frequent visits between 1524 and 
1532, and by Katherine of Aragon in the early 1530s 
during the divorce proceedings with Henry. The 
castle was ruinous by the end of the 16th century and 
the present Park House was built in the late 17th 
century  Lancelot Brown was employed to landscape 
the park from 1771-2. Horace Walpole visited 
Ampthill, corresponding regularly with Lady Ossory, 
and advised on the erection of the Katherine Cross in 
1773, contributing the inscription. The second Earl 
lived at Park House until his death in 1818. In 1837 
it was leased to Sir James Parke, later Lord 
Wensleydale, whose family remained as tenants until 
his widow's death in 1879, the estate having been 
bought by the Duke of Bedford during this period. 
The house was occupied by the army during World 
War II, following which it was sold to Bovril Limited, 
in 1955 becoming a Cheshire Home. 
There will be no effect on the 
ability 
to 
understand 
or

Hi Rob 
Thanks for your emails and apologies for not replying earlier. 
Having thought about both your proposals and given the acknowledged issues with identifying the 
route of the gas pipeline connections I am not sure that doing geophysics of the whole corridors will 
be worth the effort. Although there has been some success using geophysical survey to detect sites 
within the clay vale, conditions are such that geophysics alone is not a sound basis for identifying 
archaeological remains. Geophysics would need to be complimented by a programme of trial 
trenching to be confident of the results. On that basis I think that the your original proposal for doing 
strip map and sample of the selected pipeline routes ahead of construction may be the most effective 
way of dealing with the archaeological impact of the pipeline, and indeed the pylon bases.
