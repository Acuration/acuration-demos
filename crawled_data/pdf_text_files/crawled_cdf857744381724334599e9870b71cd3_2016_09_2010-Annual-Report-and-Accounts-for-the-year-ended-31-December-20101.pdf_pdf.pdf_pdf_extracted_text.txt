welcome to Drax
Drax is predominantly a power generation business 
responsible for meeting some 7% of the UK’s electricity 
demand. Currently owning and operating the largest power 
station in the UK, we are committed to reducing our carbon 
footprint. Through the progressive expansion of the use of 
sustainable biomass, as a replacement for coal, we aim to 
provide a low carbon, low cost and low risk power generation 
business well into the future.
At the other end of the supply chain, through our retail arm, 
Haven Power, we serve the needs of over 32,000 business 
customers. Our intention is to grow a significant retail business 
providing us with a valuable alternative to trading through 
the wholesale electricity market.

chairman’s introDUction
I am very pleased to report that, despite witnessing some of the weakest 
spreads between the price of power and the cost of generation since the 
electricity industry was privatised in 1990, Drax performed well in 2010. 
Our good performance was primarily due to a combination of record 
breaking operational plant performance and starting the year with 
strong forward sales. 
we report earnings (EBITDA) for 2010 of £391 million (2009: £355 million), 
slightly ahead of market expectations, and an operating profit of £278 million 
(2009: £173 million). In line with our dividend policy, the Board proposes 
a final dividend in respect of 2010 of 17.9 pence per share, equivalent 
to £65 million. This would give a total dividend for the year of 32.0 pence 
per share (2009: 13.7 pence per share).
The outlook, however, is challenging as we face pressure on coal generation 
margins due to today’s commodity market conditions.
Reducing our emissions of carbon dioxide remains central to our strategy. 
During the year we continued to make progress on both improving 
the overall efficiency of our plant and increasing our capability to burn 
renewable biomass fuel. In 2010, we delivered a reduction in carbon 
intensity per unit of electricity generated of 7.1% compared to 2007, 
when we first started our carbon abatement work.
we remain determined to make further progress in this area. Through 
eight years’ experience of burning biomass we have built the technical and 
commercial expertise to greatly increase our electricity generation from 
biomass. However, we will only do so if the economics of such generation 
is attractive for our shareholders; this is not the case under the current 
regulatory regime for renewables.
“I believe we have achieved 
significant progress during 
2010 throughout the business 
and my sincere thanks go 
to all Group staff for their 
tireless dedication.”

Business review
The Government is actively reviewing the structure and levels of support 
for all renewable generation technologies. we welcome these reviews and 
are engaging fully with the Government to advance the case for increasing 
the amount of renewable electricity generated from biomass. Generating 
renewable electricity from sustainable biomass is relatively low cost, and 
can be both flexible and reliable. with the right regulatory support it has the 
potential to make a very significant contribution to the uK’s commitment to 
delivering 15% of its energy from renewable sources by 2020.
The composition of the Board underwent some changes during the year. 
I was delighted to welcome Tony Thorne and Tim Cobbold to the Board 
as non-executive directors. Both Tony and Tim bring with them a wealth 
of experience in commercial and industrial matters which will be of great 
benefit to the Board. I was, however, sorry to see Jamie Dundas step 
down from the Board at last year’s Annual General Meeting (”AGM”) and 
I will be equally sorry to see Mike Grasby leave the Board at the conclusion 
of the 2011 AGM. My thanks go to them both for their time, commitment 
and considerable contribution to the Group since joining the Board.
I believe we have achieved significant progress during 2010 throughout 
the business and my sincere thanks go to all Group staff for their tireless 
dedication. without their hard work and commitment none of these 
achievements would have been possible.

traditionally a coal burning  
business, we now make use  
of a range of alternative fuels.
how we maximise value
Over the last eight years we have progressively 
increased the amount of biomass that we burn. 
Beyond biomass, we also have the ability to burn 
other fuels, such as petcoke and pond fines, 
which can be economically advantageous. 
By diversifying our fuel sources, not only are we 
less reliant on a single fuel type, but we are able 
to capture value from commodity market cycles, 
and in the case of biomass avoid the cost of carbon.

through keeping a constant eye on the commodity markets within which  
we operate we are able to optimise the commercial despatch of our power.
how we maximise value
As the largest power station in the uK we are able  
to exploit economies of scale, for example, through 
procuring fuel at competitive prices. Our trading 
strategy to hedge our power sales with coal and 
carbon purchases enables us to lock in value in the 
near, short and long term. we are always looking 
to increase the trading options available to us, 
for example, through our retail business. we benefit 
from having a physical asset to trade around and 
through a seamless interface with the operations 
side of the business we derive value from the 
operational characteristics of the power station, 
such as high availability and flexibility, enabling us to 
extract value even when market conditions are poor.

our business model
Our overriding objective is to maximise the value of the Drax business 
whilst increasing our electricity generation from biomass, and so 
reducing our carbon footprint, subject to the availability of appropriate 
levels of regulatory support. Our profitability is determined by the 
difference between the price at which we sell our power and the cost 
of coal and carbon – known as the “dark green spread”. Starting at 
the dark green spread there are several steps in the Drax value chain, 
with each one adding incremental value to the business and ultimately 
maximising the value of our business and delivering our gross margin.

in the coal-fired sector. Through our turbine upgrade 
and biomass co-firing projects we are able to reduce  
the amount of coal we burn, save on carbon costs 
and reduce emissions of CO2. we generate revenue 
through sales of our by-products. we aim to 
maximise the sales of ash produced from burning 
coal, which not only saves on landfill costs, but 
creates its own revenue stream. By reducing 
emissions of sulphur dioxide, through our flue gas

how we maximise value
Already the most efficient coal-fired power station 
in the uK, our turbine upgrade project is improving 
our overall efficiency bringing with it coal and 
carbon savings. with leading performances across 
all aspects of the operational side of the generation 
business, from safety to maintenance, we are able 
to deliver high availability and reliability. In addition, 
the flexibility of our power station allows us to

Introduction
The highlight of 2010 was without doubt 
the delivery of excellent operational 
performance. A number of best ever 
performances at the power plant enhanced 
our profitability, which was underpinned by 
the strong contracted position we had in 
place at the start of the year. Delivering 
outstanding operational performance, 
whilst maintaining a close watch on costs, 
emphasises the value of sustained effort on 
investing in and improving our operations 
over a number of years. 
Our electricity supply arm, Haven Power 
Limited (“Haven Power”), continues to 
provide us with a valuable alternative 
to trading through the wholesale market. 
we delivered our 2010 target for sales 
growth and remain convinced of the 
potential to grow a significant retail 
business through Haven Power.
we continued to make progress in 
our biomass operations, both through 
increasing our capability to burn biomass at 
Drax Power Station and our development 
work to build a dedicated biomass business 
in partnership with Siemens Project ventures. 
In fact, in 2010, we believe Drax Power 
Station generated the highest renewable 
output from a single uK facility.
 
Commodity markets
The commodity markets in 2010 remained 
challenging. Dark green spreads, the 
difference between power price and the 
cost of coal and carbon, continued to 
deteriorate in the early part of 2010, 
and by April reached their lowest levels 
in 20 years. However, during the second 
quarter we experienced some improvement 
in market conditions followed by generally 
stable, although still relatively low, spreads 
through the second half of the year. 
Demand for electricity stabilised in 2010 
after the effects of the recession. Gas again 
proved to be the dominant factor in driving 
power prices, and therefore dark green 
spreads, throughout the year. Increasing 
gas prices fed into power prices due to the 
increased cost of gas-fired generation. 
Coal prices started to increase in the last 
months of the year as a result of supply 
constraints in the Pacific market due to 
severe weather conditions, particularly 
in Australia, coupled with strong Asian 
demand. Despite not purchasing coal from 
Australia and sourcing around half of our 
coal from the uK, we feel the impact of 
constraints on the global market for 
coal, which puts pressure on international 
coal prices. However, our contracted 
position affords some protection from 
increasing prices. 
“A number of best ever 
performances at the power 
plant enhanced our profitability, 
which was underpinned by 
the strong contracted position 
we had in place at the start 
of the year.”

Operating performance 
Our availability and reliability throughout 
the year meant that, once again, Drax was 
able to prove its worth, providing flexible 
generation output and balancing services 
in support of system stability and security.
The key operational performance 
indicators demonstrate excellent results 
for 2010. Our safety statistics continue to 
be industry-leading, and the periods when 
we were unable to generate were at record 
lows, which meant our availability was at a 
record high. For the year, our forced outage 
rate, which measures any reduction in plant 
availability excluding planned outages, was 
3.4%, which compares very favourably to 
our long-term target of 5%. we delivered 
this operating performance whilst keeping 
a tight control on costs. 
It is important to note that our long-term 
target has been set through extensive 
benchmarking with uK and international 
coal-fired plant to determine the optimum 
balance between performance and cost. 
we continued to work on increasing our 
burn of fuels which have a financial 
advantage to the standard bituminous coal 
which we burn. Our alternative fuel burn, 
which includes biomass, and petcoke and 
other economically advantageous fuels, 
accounted for 12% of the total fuel burnt 
during the year. 
The re-design of our operation and 
maintenance processes continues and 
is now becoming well embedded and 
provides the platform for delivering 
good performance, whilst implementing 
innovations on fuels and maintaining 
strong cost control. 
increasing efficiency and reducing 
co2 on track 
we are now over two-thirds of the way through 
our turbine upgrade project, which is on track for 
completion in 2012. when complete the project 
will increase our overall efficiency by 5% taking 
it to 40% and with that deliver a reduction in CO2 
emissions of 1.0 million tonnes a year.
Upgrading 24 turbines
The project will see each of our high pressure and 
low pressure turbine modules upgraded. In total, 
that amounts to six high pressure turbines 
and 18 low pressure turbines.

reducing co2 through biomass
Our newly commissioned biomass co-firing facility, 
alongside our existing co-firing capacity, gives us 
the capability to reduce our emissions of CO2 by 
over 2.5 million tonnes a year. we are well placed 
to increase the level of biomass we burn still 
further, but we require an appropriate level 
of regulatory support.
Drax Group plc  |  Annual report and accounts 2010

Business review
Carbon abatement 
Carbon abatement remains central to 
our strategy. Our turbine upgrade project 
is now more than two-thirds complete, 
and on track for conclusion in 2012. 
The new modules are operating as 
expected, which means we are comfortably 
operating at an overall efficiency 
across the power station of above 39%. 
The resultant saving in emissions of carbon 
dioxide (“CO2”) amounts to over half a 
million tonnes a year.
In the Summer, we commissioned our 
new biomass co-firing facility which gives 
us the capability to produce one-eighth 
of our power from sustainable biomass, 
equivalent to the output of over 700 wind 
turbines. when running at full capacity, 
a saving of over 2.5 million tonnes of CO2 
will be possible each year. 
In 2010, our biomass burn reached the 
record level of 907,000 tonnes, over 
double that of the year before. As a result, 
we estimate that Drax Power Station 
generated 7% of the uK’s renewable power 
in 2010, which is more than twice as much 
as any other facility in the uK. This was 
despite not utilising our co-firing capability 
to the full because of insufficient regulatory 
support for biomass.
More recently in February 2011, we, in 
conjunction with Alstom uK Limited and 
National Grid Carbon Limited, lodged an 
application for European funding for a 
new, stand-alone 426Mw oxy-fired carbon 
capture and storage demonstration project 
based at the Drax Power Station site. 
 
establishing the supply chain logistics
we have worked with key partners throughout 
the year to establish critical logistics components 
in the biomass supply chain. Bespoke rail 
wagons to transport biomass and the biomass 
handling, storage and rail loading facility at the 
Port of Tyne were commissioned during the 
second half of 2010.
planning expansion through new build
Project economics for our proposed dedicated 
biomass plants are dependent on attracting an 
appropriate level of regulatory support. we will 
continue to work with our partner, Siemens Project 
ventures, to progress these developments where 
possible in the absence of regulatory clarity.

Progressing our 
biomass operations 
It has become increasingly clear to us that 
biomass could and should play a far greater 
role in helping to meet the uK’s challenging 
carbon reduction and renewables targets. 
Generating electricity from biomass is a 
relatively low cost renewable technology, 
which we believe has an important role 
to play in delivering these targets in a 
cost effective way for consumers. Further, 
as we move towards an energy mix with 
increasing penetration of intermittent 
generation capacity, the case for reliable 
and flexible renewable generation capacity 
becomes ever stronger.
Through our work at the power station 
on biomass co-firing and our development 
work on dedicated biomass plants we are 
ready to expand our biomass operations. 
Critical components of this work and of 
delivering a biomass future for the Group 
are establishing the biomass supply chain 
logistics and procuring sustainable biomass 
against our robust sustainability policy. 
we made good progress on both these 
fronts during 2010.
 
securing domestic supplies
Our 100,000 tonnes per annum straw pellet 
plant is an example of the investment we have 
made in the biomass supply chain. The ability 
to process straw has created a new market for 
local farmers and helped to secure domestic 
supplies of biomass.
expanding our on-site capability
In Summer 2010, we commissioned our new 
biomass co-firing facility to time and in line with 
budget. we now have the capability to produce 
one-eighth of our power from renewable and 
sustainable biomass. The full utilisation of our 
facility is dependent on receiving an appropriate 
level of regulatory support.
securing sustainable supplies
Our biomass procurement programme is 
underpinned by a “field to furnace” service, offering 
support and advice every step of the way. All our 
contracts ensure that our biomass supplies are 
sustainable and through independent audit we 
are able to confirm each supplier’s compliance 
with our robust sustainability policy.

Business review
engaging with UK parliament
During 2010, a series of consultation papers and 
policy statements were issued by the Government 
giving a blueprint for regulatory change in the 
electricity sector. we had significant engagement 
with Parliament and officials throughout the year 
and this will continue as the regulatory reform 
agenda takes shape.

BuSINESS REvIEw
chieF eXecUtiVe’s statement
Regulatory outlook
The year saw a series of consultation 
exercises and policy statements lay out the 
Government’s intentions for regulatory 
change. The three areas of greatest 
importance to us are the review of 
existing renewable generation support 
arrangements, electricity market reform 
and Eu agreement on measures under 
the Industrial Emissions Directive. 
In December, the Government committed 
to a faster review of support for 
renewables. we have long advocated the 
need for regulatory certainty in gaining 
investor confidence and securing 
investment. The timetable for clarity 
of the new support levels for renewable 
technologies to be implemented from 
April 2013 has been brought forward 
by around 12 months. This is a welcome 
move and is necessary to facilitate timely 
investment decisions. 
Although the Government’s position on 
burning biomass in existing coal-fired 
power plants is still evolving, we are 
encouraged that consideration is being 
given to introducing support for increased 
biomass burn at fossil fuel power stations. 
For example, through new bands for both 
higher levels of biomass co-firing and full 
conversion to biomass. we stand ready to 
increase our biomass burn to much higher 
levels, but will only do so with the 
appropriate level of support. 
During 2010, the Government developed 
and consulted on sustainability standards 
for biomass used in the generation of 
electricity. As a proponent of sustainability 
standards for biomass, we were delighted 
with the Government’s announcement in 
December that it will mandate compliance 
with a standard. Electricity generation 
from biomass has many important 
benefits, including that it can be 
sustainable. Our own sustainability policy, 
introduced in 2008, not only commits us 
to achieving reductions in greenhouse gas 
emissions, but to doing so while satisfying 
economic and social considerations.
Following the publication of proposals 
by the Government in December, 
consultations on a package of measures 
to reform the electricity market are now 
underway. The measures represent the 
single biggest change to the electricity 
sector in two decades, and whereas the 
proposals are challenging for coal they do 
reinforce our commitment to electricity 
generation from biomass. 
Proposals to change the support mechanism 
for renewables and the introduction of a 
capacity mechanism and carbon floor price 
are included in the package. 
we are supportive of the Government’s 
proposal to reform the support for 
renewables through the introduction of a 
feed-in tariff. we believe that the proposals 
will create a more level playing field for 
investment in renewables by new entrants 
and independents like Drax. 
we are pleased that the Government 
recognises the need for reform of the 
electricity market through the introduction 
of a capacity mechanism, but believe that 
the specific proposals are too narrow to 
provide the desired security of supply. 
we are particularly concerned that the 
Government’s lead proposal does not 
address the importance of flexibility 
to security of supply. 
The proposals for carbon price support 
are, we believe, unnecessary. There is 
potential for conflict with the existing 
Eu Emissions Trading Scheme (“Eu ETS”) 
and given the cap and trade nature of the 
Eu ETS, the floor price will have no impact 
on overall CO2 emissions, since any 
reduction in the uK’s emissions will simply 
result in higher emissions elsewhere in the 
Eu. we also believe that the introduction 
of a floor price which supports specific 
technologies would, in all likelihood, 
distort the wholesale market. 
Finally, on the Industrial Emissions 
Directive, we now have a greater 
understanding of the window within which 
compliance with more stringent emissions 
standards must be met. we are working on 
the options available to us for compliance, 
but with expected fuel mix integral to 
optimising the solution for Drax, the 
appropriate level of support for biomass 
is again on the critical path.

Looking ahead
Commodity markets remain challenging 
for all fossil fuel generators. we enter 2011 
with support from forward power sales of 
18Twh, a significant portion of which were 
executed on more attractive terms than we 
could capture in today’s market. we intend 
to work hard to continue to deliver leading 
operating and cost performance and to 
retain our focus on building options to burn 
economically advantageous fuel. However, 
markets recognise that profitability is likely 
to be lower in 2011, unless there is a 
significant improvement in spreads.
with a commitment to delivering value 
to our shareholders, we will continue 
our dialogue with the Government as 
regulatory reform takes shape. we believe 
that positive progress on the reform 
agenda is central to our success. with the 
right policy framework and support for 
electricity generation from biomass, we 
stand ready to make a significant, timely 
and cost effective contribution to reducing 
carbon emissions, whilst retaining reliable 
and flexible capacity on the system. 
we will continue our research and 
development work around increasing 
the level of biomass burnt at Drax Power 
Station, both through exploring higher 
levels of co-firing and full unit conversion. 
Our work will be focused on design and 
costing solutions for logistics, storage, 
materials handling and engineering. we 
will also continue working with Siemens 
Project ventures to progress our dedicated 
biomass developments, but in each case, 
further significant investment is dependent 
upon appropriate regulatory support.
we see biomass as a critical component 
to resolving the energy policy trilemma 
of tackling climate change sustainably, 
affordably and without jeopardising 
security of supply. Through significantly 
expanding our biomass burn, Drax can 
continue to be as reliable, flexible and cost 
effective as it is today well into the future 
but, importantly, as a low carbon business.

HOW WE ARE PERFORMING
we entered 2010 with a strong hedged position affording us a good 
level of protection against dark green spreads which, in April 2010, 
reached their lowest levels since privatisation. The combination of our 
hedged position and excellent operational performance enabled us to 
deliver earnings slightly ahead of market expectations. Our principal 
performance indicators provide a snapshot of how we are performing 
against our overriding objective to maximise shareholder value, 
and against our key priorities.
The aggregate of net merchant sales 
and net Balancing Mechanism activity
Why we measure
net sales tracks the volume of power we 
can sell at positive margins.
Comment
unseasonably cold weather in the first and 
fourth quarters increased demand and our 
excellent operational performance meant we 
were well placed to provide additional output.
Power revenues divided by volume of 
net sales (includes imbalance charges)
Why we measure
The average achieved price of electricity tracks 
the power price component of the dark green 
spread achieved.
Comment
The higher prices achieved through our strong 
hedged position at the start of the year were offset, 
in part, by the additional sales volume at lower 
prices for trades placed in 2010.
Average percentage of time the units were 
available for generation
Why we measure
Availability tracks our operating performance enabling 
assessment of, and guidance for, our operational 
regime and maintenance investment plans. 
Comment
The periods when we were unable to generate 
due to outages were at a record low, which meant 
our availability was at a record high.

Fuel costs excluding carbon divided by  
volume of net sales
Why we measure
The average cost of fuel excluding carbon tracks 
the fuel cost component of the dark green spread 
achieved, and reflects the value captured from 
effective fuel procurement and diversified fuel 
sources.
Comment
The small increase in average fuel prices was driven 
by fuel mix and commodity price movements.
The frequency rate is calculated on the 
following basis: (lost time injuries + worse than 
first aid injuries)/hours worked x 100,000
The frequency rate is calculated on the 
following basis: lost time injuries/hours worked 
x 100,000
Why we measure
These injury rate metrics track our health and safety performance and enable us to maintain a positive 
health and safety culture.
Comment
Our safety record continues to be industry-leading and was delivered alongside a significant amount 
of project activity. The small increase in LTir and Trir demonstrates the importance of retaining a key 
focus on health and safety.

Why we measure
Monitoring net cash/(debt) ensures an efficient 
capital structure is maintained to support our 
business model, alongside sufficient liquidity 
to manage our future obligations.
Comment
The increase in net cash is largely due to a 
significant working capital release from coal 
stocks, resulting from higher generation output.
Net sent out generation as a percentage 
of total available generation capacity
Why we measure
Load factor tracks our operating performance 
and the competitiveness of Drax Power station.
Comment
The increase arises following an increase 
in generation output (net power sales), as a result 
of our competitive position in the marketplace, 
high availability and unseasonably cold weather.
Tonnes of biomass fuel burnt during the year
Why we measure
Measuring the levels of biomass burnt tracks our 
progress in producing power from renewable and 
sustainable sources.
Comment
we have more than doubled our biomass burn 
following the commissioning of our new co-firing 
facility in 2010. As a result, Drax is now the largest 
renewable power generation facility in the uK.
Net sales distributed through our retail 
supply arm, Haven Power
Why we measure
A measure of the rate of growth in our retail business.
Comment
This reflects planned growth in Haven Power’s 
business, particularly in the industrial and commercial 
market. Haven Power provides a valuable alternative 
to trading through the wholesale market. 
Drax acquired Haven Power in March 2009.
CO2 emissions rate per unit of output
Why we measure
This measure of carbon emissions illustrates our 
progress in reducing the carbon footprint of Drax 
Power station.
Comment
The performance data of the upgraded turbines 
shows that we are operating at an overall efficiency of 
above 39%, saving over half a million tonnes of CO2 
per annum. record levels of biomass burnt saved an 
additional 1.5 million tonnes of CO2 in the year.

sales with purchases of coal and carbon, hence we 
locked into carbon contracts to cover our 2010 
liability during 2009 when market prices were low.

MARKETPlACE
Commodity markets
After facing challenging commodity market 
conditions throughout 2009, we had to 
contend with dark green spreads that 
continued to deteriorate in the early part 
of 2010, and which by April reached their 
lowest levels since privatisation of the 
industry 20 years ago. However, during 
the second quarter we experienced some 
improvement in market conditions, 
followed by a period of generally stable, 
although still relatively low, spreads 
through the remainder of the year. 
Throughout, the gas market continued 
to be the dominant factor in driving uK 
power prices and dark green spreads. 
These trends witnessed in 2009 and 
2010 are described further in the following 
paragraphs and are illustrated in the 
accompanying charts.
Gas
During 2009, reducing demand and 
increased Liquefied natural Gas (“LnG”) 
supply led to a global gas surplus, and as 
there is only storage for a finite volume, 
the uK with its open market became the 
consumer of last resort. Plentiful supply 
consequently drove gas prices down. 
Gas prices recovered in the second quarter 
of 2010, reflecting lower LnG supply into 
the uK, following higher than anticipated 
demand from Asia, and lower production 
in Qatar. in addition, there were some signs 
of a recovery in continental european gas 
demand, with higher exports from the 
uK to europe through the interconnector. 
Following a period of stability during the 
third quarter, gas prices increased 
towards the end of the year, with cold 
temperatures driving high demand 
in november and December. 
LnG and shale gas remain key drivers of 
the long-term gas markets. shale gas is 
largely a us phenomenon in the near-term. 
Horizontal drilling technology has 
advanced, but research papers remain 
divided on the marginal cost and available 
volumes at the lower end of the cost scale. 
However, the us has significant reserves 
that could enable it to become relatively 
self sufficient. This could reduce its LnG 
requirements, freeing up more volume 
for the Asian and european markets 
depending on their relative market price. 
in the longer term, other countries such 
as China may also exploit potentially 
large shale gas reserves. However, 
developments outside the us are in their 
infancy and will, therefore, have little 
impact in the short- to medium-term. 
Power
Power prices during the period under 
review generally followed the trends in 
gas prices described above. in addition, 
during 2009, high availability of uK 
generating capacity, as well as a reduction 
of more than 3% in electricity demand 
caused by the economic downturn, put 
further pressure on power prices. 
During 2010, power demand appeared 
to stabilise. There was a small increase 
in demand in the first quarter of the year, 
and demand reached record levels in 
December, although on both occasions this 
was most likely a result of the unseasonably 
cold weather. To balance this, on the supply 
side we are now seeing significant new 
gas-fired capacity coming on line.

“ Following the lowest 
dark green spreads

Drax Group plc  |  Annual report and accounts 2010

Business review
Coal
Following a sharp fall and recovery early in 
2009, coal prices were relatively stable for 
the rest of the year. There was downward 
pressure in the near-term, resulting 
from recession induced weaker demand, 
causing over supply and higher stock levels, 
particularly in europe. upward pressure 
in the medium- to long-term reflected 
continued demand growth in China and 
anticipation of global economic recovery.
Following a continued period of price 
stability through the first half of 2010, 
coal prices increased significantly in the 
final months of the year. This reflected 
tightening in the Pacific market with severe 
weather causing constraints on production 
in Australia, indonesia and Colombia. 
in addition, strong Asian demand for Atlantic 
coal, particularly from China, continued to 
support eu prices. with current annual 
steam coal consumption of around 2 billion 
tonnes, there is enormous potential for 
China to impact the global market. Over the 
course of the last few years, China has switched 
from an exporter to an importer of steam 
coal, with net imports of around 80 million 
tonnes in 2010, representing more than 10% 
of the traded steam coal market. 
Carbon allowances
Carbon price trends were similar to coal 
in 2009, with a sharp fall and recovery 
early in the year, followed by a period of 
relative stability. 
Carbon prices continued to trade in a 
fairly narrow range throughout 2010, 
with a small increase experienced in 
the second half of the year. 
it appears that the carbon market 
predominantly continues to reflect 
sentiment around eu policy. with any 
Phase ii surplus bankable into Phase iii, 
pricing seems largely driven by political 
and macroeconomic factors, such as the 
renewable generation build rate, the pace 
of economic recovery, and the possible 
increase in uK carbon dioxide (“CO2”) 
reduction targets (from 20% to 30%).
Dark green spread
Overall during 2010, increased gas prices 
pushed power prices higher, and with coal 
and carbon prices also increasing, but to 
a lesser extent, we have experienced some 
improvement in dark green spreads across 
the forward curve compared to a year ago. 
However, compared to historical averages, 
spreads still remain relatively low and the 
outlook remains challenging.

OPERATIONAl AND FINANCIAl PERFORMANCE
“ increased profits in 2010 
were underpinned by the 
strong hedged position 
we entered the year with, 
and enhanced by our excellent 
operational performance.”
introduction
The Group’s principal performance 
indicators are highlighted on pages 16 
and 17. 
ebiTDA was £391 million for the year ended 
31 December 2010 compared to £355 million 
in 2009 and underlying earnings per share 
were 64 pence compared to 58 pence last 
year, both representing increases of 10%. 
we entered the year with a strong hedged 
position, which locked in higher average 
margins than for 2009. Our profitability 
was further enhanced by an excellent 
operational performance, which enabled 
us to capture incremental volume during 
some of the coldest months on record 
at the beginning and end of the year. in 
addition, we continued our drive on cash 
management and achieved our targeted 
cost efficiencies and capital expenditure 
reductions. in fact, underlying earnings per 
share have increased by more than 20%, 
excluding a gain of £31 million recognised 
in 2009 on the close out of a number of 
in-the-money foreign exchange contracts. 
Our retail business, Haven Power Limited 
(“Haven Power”), delivered a second year 
of very strong sales growth. 
earlier in the year we took steps to underpin 
our financing arrangements, by executing 
a new £135 million trading facility. 
we ended the year with a strong balance 
sheet, including net cash of over 
£200 million, helped by a significant 
working capital release from coal stocks. 
This balance includes the ring-fenced cash 
taxes of £117 million saved as a result of 
unwinding the eurobond structure. 
in summary, 2010 was a year characterised 
by strong financial results and excellent 
operational performance. At the upcoming 
Annual General Meeting, the board will 
recommend a final dividend for 2010 of 
17.9 pence per share, taking total dividends 
for the year to 32.0 pence per share, or 
£117 million, and more than twice the total 
dividend for 2009 (£50 million). 
This review includes further explanation 
and commentary in relation to our principal 
performance indicators and the results for 
the year.

OPERATIONAl AND FINANCIAl PERFORMANCE
Revenue
Total revenue for the year ended 
31 December 2010 was £1,648 million 
compared to £1,476 million in 2009. 
Total revenue in 2010 includes power sales 
of £1,458 million (2009: £1,345 million), 
retail sales of £124 million (2009: 
£65 million) and other income 
of £66 million (2009: £66 million).
Higher power sales resulted from an 
increase in net power sold to 26.4Twh, 
compared to 22.6Twh in 2009. This was 
driven largely by the unseasonably cold 
weather during the first and fourth 
quarters and our excellent operating 
performance. whilst margins captured 
on this incremental sales volume were 
low, the additional generation resulted in 
a reduction of 1.6 million tonnes in our coal 
stocks and consequent improvement in our 
cash balances (see Analysis of cash flows). 
Average wholesale achieved electricity 
price for the year ended 31 December 2010 
of £51.6 per Mwh is broadly in line with 
2009 (£52.0 per Mwh), and resulted from 
a blend of locking in higher prices through 
our strong hedge, offset in part by the 
additional sales volume at lower prices 
for trades placed in 2010. 
retail sales volumes have increased 
from 0.7Twh in the 12 months to 
31 December 2009 (Drax acquired Haven 
Power in March of 2009) to 1.4Twh in 2010. 
This reflects planned growth in Haven 
Power’s business. 
in addition to power sales, total revenue 
also includes income from the provision of 
ancillary services, the sale of by-products 
(ash and gypsum), and the sale of rOCs 
and LeCs. These revenues were £66 million 
in both years.

in 2009 to £23 million in 2010, the rOC 
inventory held on our balance sheet 
increased by £21 million through the year, 
and we expect to sell most of these rOCs 
in 2011. Lower rOC sales in 2010 reflect the 
reduction in the rate of rOCs earned from 
co-firing non-energy crop biomass with 
coal, which from April 2009 has only 
earned half a rOC for each Mwh of 
electricity generated (previously one rOC), 
therefore producing a lower volume of 
rOCs available for sale. Additional 2010 
ancillary services income benefited from 
the Firm Frequency response contracts 
secured with national Grid.

Business review
Fuel costs (coal, biomass and other fuels)
Fuel costs were £841 million, compared 
to £722 million in 2009 (excluding a 
£31 million gain on the early close out of a 
number of in-the-money foreign exchange 
contracts). The increase was primarily 
due to higher generation. 
we burnt approximately 9.4 million tonnes 
of coal in the year ended 31 December 
2010, compared to approximately 
8.2 million tonnes in 2009. This coal was 
purchased from a variety of domestic and 
international sources under either fixed 
or variable priced contracts with different 
maturities. Coal represented around 
88% of total fuel burnt (by heat content) 
both in 2010 and 2009. 
in 2010, we burnt 0.9 million tonnes 
of biomass (2009: 0.4 million tonnes) 
representing 6% of total fuel burnt by 
heat content (2009: 3%). This is a result 
of the commissioning and early operation 
of our new co-firing facility (see Capital 
expenditure). we also burnt 0.2 million 
tonnes of petcoke (2009: 0.5 million 
tonnes) and 0.4 million tonnes of 
pond fines (2009: 0.1 million tonnes). 
Our petcoke burn volume is driven by 
its pricing relative to coal. Pond fines are 
a coal mining residue, which trades at a 
significant discount to coal, and requires 
specific blending and handling techniques 
to burn in large volumes. we have 
developed these techniques over the 
last two years. The increases in our 
biomass and pond fines burn in 2010, 
demonstrate further improvements in 
our fuel flexibility. 
Our average cost of fuel is a function of 
the timing of purchases under domestic 
and international contracts in the forward 
and near-term markets and of fuel mix. 
The average cost of fuel per Mwh 
(excluding CO2 emissions allowances) was 
£25.7 for the year ended 31 December 2010, 
compared to £25.4 in 2009. The small 
increase in average fuel prices was 
driven by fuel mix and commodity price 
movements. Costs per Mwh for 2009 are 
adjusted to exclude the £31 million foreign 
exchange gain described above. 
Fuel costs (CO2 emissions allowances)
For Phase ii of the eu eTs (2008–2012), 
Drax has an allocation of 9.5 million tonnes 
of CO2 emissions allowances per annum 
under the uK nAP. we purchase CO2 
emissions allowances under fixed price 
contracts with different maturity dates 
from a variety of domestic and 
international sources.
Our CO2 emissions allowances requirement 
for the year ended 31 December 2010, 
in excess of those allocated under the uK 
nAP, was approximately 12.9 million tonnes 
compared to approximately 10.3 million 
tonnes in 2009. This was a result of 
higher generation, partially offset by plant 
efficiency improvements and higher levels 
of biomass burn.
Our average price of carbon is a function 
of the timing of purchases under fixed price 
contracts in the forward and near-term 
markets. The average price expensed 
for purchased CO2 emissions allowances 
during the year ended 31 December 2010 
was £12.6 per tonne compared to £14.3 per 
tonne in 2009, reflecting the fact that we 
locked into carbon contracts to cover our 
2010 liability during 2009 when we sold the 
related power. similarly, the 2009 carbon 
cost reflects contract prices which were 
largely locked in during 2008. Average 
market prices for carbon were higher in 
2008 than in 2009.
Cost of power purchases
we purchase power in the market when 
the cost of power in the market is below our 
marginal cost of production in respect of 
power previously contracted for generation 
and delivery by us, and to cover any 
shortfall in generation. in addition, Haven 
Power purchases power in the wholesale 
market for delivery to its retail customers. 
For the year ended 31 December 2010, the 
cost of purchased power was £166 million, 
compared to £210 million incurred in 2009. 
Haven Power’s cost of power purchases 
amounted to £71 million, compared to 
£40 million in 2009, including the cost 
of power purchased directly from Drax 
Power station. 
Grid charges
Grid charges for the year ended 
31 December 2010 were £82 million, 
compared to £68 million in 2009. 
Grid charges in 2010 include costs of 
£28 million incurred at Haven Power 
compared to £12 million in 2009, reflecting 
the increase in retail volumes sold. 
Other retail costs
Other retail costs include broker fees, 
rOCs and metering at Haven Power 
and were £9 million in the year ended 
31 December 2010, compared to £4 million 
in 2009.

OPERATIONAl AND FINANCIAl PERFORMANCE
Operating and administrative expenses
Other operating and administrative 
expenses before depreciation and 
amortisation were £160 million for the 
year ended 31 December 2010, compared 
to £148 million in 2009. underlying costs 
were held level through our continued 
focus on business efficiencies and process 
re-engineering. The cost increase of 
£12 million reflects investment in growth 
(Haven Power and biomass) as well as 
our first full year’s obligation for the 
Community energy saving Programme 
(“CesP”). 
Despite only a slight recovery in dark green 
spreads in the year, we have delivered 
ebiTDA ahead of expectations. Key to this 
was entering the year with a strong hedged 
position and our excellent operational 
performance during the year, which 
ensured high levels of availability at times 
of increased demand. 
Depreciation and amortisation was 
£52 million for both the years ended 
31 December 2010 and 31 December 2009. 
unrealised gains and losses 
on derivative contracts
The Group recognises unrealised gains 
and losses on forward contracts which 
meet the definition of derivatives under 
iFrss. where possible, we take the own use 
exemption for derivative contracts entered 
into and held for our own purchase, sale or 
usage requirements, including forward 
domestic coal and biomass contracts. 
As such, the movement in the net 
unrealised gains and losses recognised in 
the balance sheet principally relate to the 
mark-to-market of our forward contracts 
for power. The following table describes 
the movements in unrealised gains and 
losses and where they are recorded in 
our financial statements.

234.1
The trends in forward power prices, which 
largely determine the movements in our 
net unrealised (losses)/gains position are 
described within the Commodity markets 
section above. 
During 2009, power prices fell, such that 
the average price of power that had been 
contracted, but had yet to be delivered at 
31 December 2009 was much higher than 
market prices, driving the recognition of a 
net unrealised gain of £234 million in the 
balance sheet. During 2010, power prices 
increased such that by 31 December this 
difference was much smaller, driving the 
movement to a net unrealised loss of 
£61 million. 
The unrealised losses recognised in the 
income statement of £60.5 million for 
the year ended 31 December 2010 and 
£130 million in 2009 arise from mark-to-
market movements on our derivative 
contracts which do not qualify for hedge 
accounting; largely financial coal and 
foreign exchange. 
Mark-to-market movements on most of 
our derivative contracts, considered to 
be effective hedges, have been recognised 
through the hedge reserve, a component 
of shareholders’ equity in the balance 
sheet. Movements in unrealised gains 
and losses recognised in the hedge 
reserve are mainly the result of unwinding 
mark-to-market positions relating to power 
delivered during a reporting period, and the 
recording of mark-to-market positions 
on power yet to be delivered at the end 
of that period. The net unrealised loss 
recognised through the hedge reserve 
in the year ended 31 December 2010 was 
£233 million, compared to a net unrealised 
gain of £376 million in 2009, with 2010 
largely reflecting the unwind of mark-to-
market positions on power delivered in 
the period and forward power price trends 
described above.
in considering mark-to-market movements, 
it is important to recognise that profitability 
is driven by our strategy to deliver market 
level dark green spreads, not by the absolute 
price of electricity at any given date.
Interest
net finance costs for the year ended 
31 December 2010 were £23 million 
compared with £15 million in 2009. 
The increase of £8 million includes 
arrangement fees and other charges 
associated with a new £135 million trading 
facility (see Liquidity and capital resources). 
it also includes higher funding costs now 
applied to our term loan and working 
capital facilities following the refinancing 
completed in August 2009.
Tax
The tax charge for the year ended 
31 December 2010 was £67 million 
(an effective rate of 26%), compared to 
£47 million in 2009 (an effective rate 
of 30%). Tax for 2010 includes the impact 
of the 1% reduction in corporation tax rate 
from April 2011 on deferred tax liabilities.

of £31 million recognised last year

in 2009.

Business review
under the Group’s previous financing 
structure, a subsidiary company was 
partially funded by a eurobond payable 
to another group company, which was 
unwound in 2008, potentially accelerating 
additional tax losses with a cash tax benefit 
of up to £220 million. As at 31 December 
2010, we had utilised in the region of 
£117 million of these potential tax losses, 
which is reflected in our cash position. 
However, we have ring-fenced this cash 
and will not reflect any benefit of the 
£117 million, or further utilisation of the 
remaining losses in our income statement 
until our position with HMrC is certain. 
we have continued our dialogue with HMrC 
over this tax position. However, whilst we 
still believe we have a strong and robust 
case, we are no clearer as to whether 
ultimately we will be successful.
underlying profit attributable to equity 
shareholders (that is profit excluding the 
after tax impact of unrealised losses on 
derivative contracts) was £233 million 
for the year ended 31 December 2010, 
compared to £204 million in 2009. 
underlying basic and diluted earnings 
per share were 64 pence in 2010, 
compared to 58 pence in 2009, 
representing an increase of 10% or 24% 
excluding the foreign exchange gain of 
£31 million in 2009 described above.

notes:
(1)  The forced outage rate is expressed as a percentage of planned 
capacity available (that is, it includes a reduction for planned 
losses). The planned outage rate is expressed as a percentage of 
registered capacity. Accordingly, the aggregation of the forced 
outage rate and planned outage rate will not equate to the total 
outage rate.
2010 was a record year for Drax in terms 
of our operational performance with best 
ever forced outage rate, winter forced 
outage rate and availability results for 
the power station. 
The load factor for the year ended 
31 December 2010 was 79.7%, compared 
to 68.2% in 2009. The increase arises 
following an increase in electrical output 
(net power sales) to 26.4Twh in 2010, 
compared with 22.6Twh in 2009 as 
described in revenue above. we continued 
to demonstrate our leadership position in 
the coal-fired generation sector with plant 
availability of 92.1% for the year ended 
31 December 2010, compared to 89.1% 
in 2009. 
The forced outage and winter forced 
outage rates for the year ended 
31 December 2010 were 3.4% and 2.4% 
respectively, compared to 6.5% and 7.5% 
in 2009. The significantly higher forced 
outage rates in 2009 reflect a one-off 
incident in the first quarter which was 
confined to a single generating unit. 
excluding the impact of this outage, 
the forced outage rate and winter 
forced outage rate were 4.9% and 4.5% 
respectively. The improved 2010 forced 
outage rate compares favourably with 
our long-term annual target of 5%. 
The planned outage rate achieved for the 
year ended 31 December 2010 was 4.6%, 
compared to 4.7% in 2009, with one major 
planned outage completed in both years. 
Our maintenance regime includes a major 
planned outage for each of our six units 
once every four years. Consequently, there 
is an irregular pattern to planned outages 
and associated expenditure, since in two of 
the four years two units will each undergo 
a major planned outage. One unit will 
undergo a major planned outage in 2011. 
Health and safety
Our lost time injury rate and total recordable 
injury rate were 0.13 and 0.26 respectively 
for the year ended 31 December 2010 
compared to 0.09 and 0.17 respectively 
in 2009. Our safety record continues 
to be industry-leading and was delivered 
alongside a significant amount of 
project activity. we continue with our 
commitment to deliver a positive health 
and safety culture.

Cash generated from operations 
was £485 million in the year ended 
31 December 2010, compared to 
£321 million in 2009. The increase 
was largely the result of an increase of 
£36 million in ebiTDA, a working capital 
inflow of £115 million in 2010, compared 
to an outflow of £43 million in 2009, 
offset by an increase in rOCs held for 
sale of £21 million (2009: decrease 
of £10 million).
The working capital inflow of £115 million 
in 2010 includes a decrease in coal stocks 
of 1.6 million tonnes over the year 
(£84 million), resulting from higher 
generation (see revenue). The remaining 
net inflow includes a higher carbon creditor 
(£24 million) reflecting the timing of 
payments with respect to our 2010 carbon 
liability. The working capital outflow in 
2009 largely reflects an increase in coal 
stocks of 0.7 million tonnes (£21 million), 
resulting from lower than expected 
generation over the corresponding period. 
income taxes paid were £56 million in the 
year ended 31 December 2010, compared 
to taxes refunded of £19 million in 2009. 
unwinding the eurobond funding structure 
in December 2008 potentially reduced the 
2008 tax liability to £nil, subject to HMrC 
agreement, resulting in a refund received 
in 2009 (see note 6 to the consolidated 
financial statements). 
net cash used in investing activities includes 
payments in respect of capital expenditure 
of £62 million for the year ended 
31 December 2010 and £93 million in 2009 
(see Capital expenditure). 2010 includes 
additional short-term investments of 
£40 million (2009: additional £55 million), 
comprising short-term deposits with a 
maturity of more than three months at 
inception. 2009 includes the net acquisition 
costs of Haven Power of £12 million. 
net cash used in financing activities was 
£153 million in the year ended 31 December 
2010, compared to £218 million in 2009. 
The 2010 amount includes equity dividends 
paid of £87 million and term loan 
repayments of £65 million. The 2009 
amount includes equity dividends paid of 
£145 million, net proceeds from the issue 
of share capital of £106 million and term 
loan repayments of £170 million (see 
Capital resources and refinancing). 
The increase in cash and cash equivalents 
was therefore £156 million in the year 
ended 31 December 2010, compared 
to a decrease of £50 million in 2009. 
Drax’s policy is to invest available cash in 
short-term bank, building society or other 
low risk deposits.
Capital resources and refinancing
Following scheduled debt repayments of 
£65 million during the year, senior secured 
debt was £135 million at 31 December 2010 
(before deferred finance costs). scheduled 
debt repayments are £67.5 million in each 
of 2011 and 2012, after which point the term 
loan will be repaid in full. 
On 3 August 2009, we completed the 
refinancing of the remainder of our term 
loan facility and our £100 million working 
capital facility, both of which would 
otherwise have fallen due for repayment 
on 31 December 2010. The maturity date 
of both facilities was extended to December 
2012 to coincide with the maturity of the 
£200 million letter of credit facility. The 
margin over LibOr on our facilities is 3.5%.
To further underpin the strength of our 
financing arrangements, in May 2010, 
we put in place a new trading facility, 
which may be used to trade without 
collateral triggers up to a limit of 
£135 million. we incurred additional fees 
and charges of £5 million in connection 
with the new facility during the year. 
Going concern
The Group’s business activities, together 
with the factors likely to affect future 
developments, performance and position 
including principal risks and uncertainties 
are set out in this business review. 
Our cash flows and borrowing facilities are 
described above. in addition, note 18 to the 
consolidated financial statements includes 
our approach to capital risk management, 
details on financial instruments and 
hedging activities, and exposure to 
credit, counterparty and liquidity risk. 
we have significant headroom in our 
banking facilities, and a recent history 
of cash generation, strong covenant 
compliance, and good visibility in medium-
term forecasts, due to our progressive 
hedging strategy. Our business Plan, taking 
account of reasonably possible changes in 
trading performance, shows that we should 
be able to operate within the level of our 
current banking facilities. 
Accordingly, we believe the Group has 
adequate resources to continue in operational 
existence for the foreseeable future, and 
continue to adopt the going concern basis 
when preparing our financial statements. 
seasonality of borrowing
Our business is seasonal with higher 
electricity prices and despatch in the winter 
period and lower despatch in the summer 
months, when prices are lower and plant 
availability is affected by planned outages.
Accordingly, cash flow during the summer 
months is materially reduced due to the 
combined effect of lower prices and output, 
while maintenance expenditures are 
increased during this period due to major 
planned outages. The Group’s £100 million 
revolving credit facility assists in managing 
the cash low points in the cycle where 
required. The revolving credit facility was 
undrawn at 31 December 2010 and has 
a final maturity date of December 2012.

Business review
Capital expenditure
Fixed asset additions were £59 million 
in the year ended 31 December 2010 
compared to £92 million in 2009. 
This includes expenditure of £37 million 
(£59 million in 2009) on our two major 
strategic carbon abatement projects – 
the turbine upgrade and our biomass 
co-firing facility. 
in relation to the turbine upgrade project, 
we expect to invest up to £100 million 
to upgrade the high pressure and low 
pressure turbine modules on all six 
generating units to improve efficiency 
(see Corporate and social responsibility, 
page 32). with a single unit outage 
scheduled for 2011, the final turbine 
upgrade will be undertaken in 2012. 
expenditure remains in line with budget. 
Commissioning of our new £80 million 
biomass co-firing facility was completed 
during the summer, to schedule and in 
line with budget (see Corporate and 
social responsibility, page 32). The current 
economics of co-firing, however, mean 
that under the existing rOC regime we 
are under-utilising the facility. 
we will also continue to evaluate other 
investment opportunities which may result 
in additional capital expenditure. Further 
investment will be required prior to 2016 
to meet the requirements of the industrial 
emissions Directive.
Future developments
Progressing our biomass operations
we continued to make progress in our 
biomass operations in 2010. in addition to 
commissioning the co-firing facility at Drax 
Power station, we have worked with key 
partners to design rail wagons specifically 
to transport biomass, and to develop a 
biomass handling, storage and rail loading 
facility at the Port of Tyne. in addition, 
our straw pellet plant helped to secure 
domestic supplies of biomass. 
we have conducted research into increasing 
the level of biomass burn at Drax Power 
station, and have continued to progress 
our dedicated biomass projects with 
siemens Project ventures. As a result of 
these investments, we stand ready to expand 
our biomass business significantly, but will 
only do so with appropriate regulatory 
support (see Chief executive’s statement). 
Positions under contract  
for 2011, 2012 and 2013
we continue to follow our stated trading 
strategy of making steady forward power 
sales with corresponding purchases of CO2 
emissions allowances and fuel purchases. 
Our aim is to deliver market level dark 
green spreads across all traded market 
periods and, as part of this strategy, we 
retain power to be sold into the prompt 
(within season) power markets.
As at 14 February 2011, the positions 
under contract for 2011, 2012 and 2013 
were as follows:
2011
2012
2013

under the five and a quarter year baseload 
contract which commenced on 1 October 
2007 and the five year 300Mw baseload 
contract which commenced on 1 October 
2010, both with Centrica.
Fixed margin power sales include 
approximately 6.8Twh in 2011, 7.9Twh 
in 2012 and 2.6Twh in 2013 in connection 
with the above contracts.
under these contracts the Group will 
supply power on terms which include 
Centrica paying for coal, based on 
international coal prices, and delivering 
matching CO2 emissions allowances 
amounting in aggregate to approximately 
7.2 million tonnes in 2011, approximately 
7.2 million tonnes in 2012 and 
approximately 2.4 million tonnes in 2013. 
The contracts provide the Group with a 
series of fixed dark green spreads, with the 
spreads in the first contract having been 
agreed in the first quarter of 2006 and 
those in the second contract having been 
agreed in October 2009.
Distributions
Distribution policy
we notified investors of a change to our 
distribution policy when we announced 
our biomass growth strategy in October 
2008. For 2010 and beyond, we will target 
a pay-out ratio of 50% of underlying 
earnings (being profit attributable to equity 
shareholders adjusted to exclude the after 
tax impact of unrealised gains and losses 
on derivative contracts) in each year. 
underlying earnings per share were 
64 pence on this basis for the year ended 
31 December 2010. 
Dividends paid 
On 22 February 2010, the board resolved, 
subject to approval by shareholders at 
the Annual General Meeting (“AGM”) 
on 21 April 2010, to pay a final dividend 
for the year ended 31 December 2009 
of 9.6 pence per share (£35 million). 
The final dividend was subsequently 
paid on 14 May 2010.
On 2 August 2010, the board resolved to 
pay an interim dividend for the six months 
ended 30 June 2010 of 14.1 pence per 
share (£52 million), representing 50% 
of underlying earnings for the period. 
The interim dividend was subsequently 
paid on 15 October 2010.
Dividends proposed
At the forthcoming AGM the board 
will recommend to shareholders that a 
resolution is passed to approve payment 
of a final dividend for the year ended 
31 December 2010 of 17.9 pence per share 
(£65 million), payable on or before 13 May 
2011. shares will be marked ex-dividend 
on 27 April 2011.
This business review was approved 
by the board on 21 February 2011.

CORPORATE AnD sOCiAl REsPOnsiBiliTY
Our approach to corporate 
and social responsibility
we operate our business within a 
framework of increasingly stringent and 
challenging legislative and regulatory 
requirements. we are, however, mindful 
of the still tougher expectations held by 
our wider stakeholder group. For us, 
corporate and social responsibility is 
about achieving a balance between the 
commercial and regulatory rigours of 
the competitive sector within which we 
operate and our commitment to our 
stakeholders as a whole.
The board has ultimate control of policies 
in respect of both the wider corporate 
responsibility, such as our Code of business 
ethics (see panel opposite), and our 
environmental and health and safety 
programmes. The board’s policies are 
implemented by dedicated specialists 
who make sure effective processes 
and procedures are in place to assure 
compliance and to identify and to report 
on risks and opportunities.
As in previous years we have continued 
to invest, not only to comply with 
environmental and health and safety 
requirements, but, where practicable, to go 
further. in 2010, we retained our presence 
in the FTse4Good index series, which is 
designed to measure the performance of 
companies that meet globally recognised 
corporate responsibility standards and 
facilitate investment in those companies. 
During the year, we took the decision to 
improve the measurement and reporting 
of our economic, environmental and 
social performance. The Global reporting 
initiative (“Gri”) Framework provides 
principles and performance indicators 
which can usefully be used to demonstrate 
our commitment to sustainable 
development, compare our performance 
over time, and to measure our performance 
against other standards and norms. 
Although only at the level of partial 
disclosure against the Gri Framework for 
2010, we commit to improve on this over 
time as we move towards full disclosure.
Our commitment to integrity
Drax has a commitment to high ethical standards and to conduct our business 
with honesty, integrity and in accordance with applicable laws and regulations.
Our reputation for acting with integrity plays a critical role in our success. integrity not 
only underpins how we do business, but how we expect our suppliers, agents, partners, 
contractors and consultants to do business whether in the uK or beyond. Compliance 
with the laws and regulations of the countries in which we do business is a “must” 
for us. Drax is committed to preventing bribery and corruption and takes responsibility 
for maintaining a culture within the Group in which bribery is never acceptable. 
As a business we refuse to offer, give or receive bribes or any other form of improper 
payments and we will never knowingly participate in any form of corrupt activity. 
Consideration should always be given by our employees when offering or receiving 
gifts or hospitality. Drax has a policy whereby gifts and hospitality offered or received 
may only be of minimal value.
if faced with a situation of compromising our integrity or losing the associated 
business, we would forego the business.
Code of business ethics
The Group’s Code of business ethics establishes the rules and framework under 
which employees should base their decision making. employees are expected to 
follow not only the letter of the code, but the spirit.
what is expected of our employees
ensuring that the reputation and good standing of the Group continues to be 
maintained requires our employees to act with the highest standards of behaviour 
and to be accountable for upholding the requirements of Drax’s Code of business 
ethics, wherever they are in the world.
Poor choices can have potentially damaging consequences, not only to Drax’s 
reputation, but financial penalties and imprisonment are also a reality for 
“getting it wrong”.
whilst it is often obvious what is right and wrong, our employees may, on occasion, 
face an ethical dilemma. if it feels wrong, it often is. by encouraging our employees 
to apply good judgement and common sense within the framework of the Code of 
business ethics they can contribute to maintaining our reputation. 
whistleblowing 
The Group’s whistleblowing policy provides a confidential means for our employees 
to speak up with confidence. The policy provides guidance on how to make a 
disclosure of information (in good faith) relating to some danger, fraud or other 
illegal or unethical conduct they may have witnessed or are concerned about.

Climate change and  
the environment
Tackling climate change
we believe we have an important part to 
play in managing the transition of the uK 
towards a low carbon economy. The single 
biggest challenge facing coal-fired 
generators today is environmental, and in 
particular, carbon. Against that backdrop 
and with an eye on future-proofing the 
business, Drax identified biomass co-firing 
and increased thermal efficiency as the 
major strategic carbon abatement 
initiatives to undertake.
At the centre of our thermal efficiency 
improvement programme is the 
£100 million upgrade of the high and 
low pressure turbines of each of our six 
generating units. During the major planned 
outage of 2010 we installed one high 
pressure and three low pressure turbine 
modules to one unit. Together with the 
installation of similar modules during 2007, 
2008 and 2009, this means that we are 
now more than two-thirds of the way 
through the upgrade project. As a result 
we are comfortably operating at above 
39% overall efficiency at full load and 
we are already saving over half a million 
tonnes of carbon dioxide (“CO2”) emissions 
a year. On completion of the upgrade in 
2012 we will see an improvement in our 
overall baseload efficiency at full load of 
5%, taking it to 40%, and an annual saving 
of one million tonnes of CO2 emissions.
biomass co-firing is a recognised renewable 
technology. Through displacing coal and 
taking into account the carbon neutral 
status of biomass emissions at the point 
of combustion, emissions of CO2 can be 
significantly reduced. Our new 400Mw 
biomass co-firing facility, the largest of its 
kind in the world, was commissioned in the 
summer of 2010. Alongside our existing 
100Mw co-firing capacity, we now have the 
capability to produce 12.5% of our output 
from renewable and sustainable biomass. 
This is equivalent to the output of over 
700 wind turbines, and has the potential 
to save over 2.5 million tonnes of CO2 
emissions a year. The new facility 
considerably aided our ability to burn 
biomass and 2010 saw the highest level yet 
of biomass burned at the power station. 
with a record burn of 907,000 tonnes of 
biomass, our coal throughput was reduced 
and we saved 1.5 million tonnes of CO2 
emissions during the year.
we fully recognise the challenge that we 
and other fossil fuel-fired power stations 
face in tackling carbon emissions and these 
two projects are giving us the capability 
to reduce our emissions of CO2 by over 
3.5 million tonnes a year, or 17.5% by 
the end of 2011.
Our focus on all aspects of biomass, from 
the upstream supply chain to combustion 
performance, makes us well placed to 
pursue a biomass future for the Group, 
whether through increasing the level of 
biomass burnt at the power station or 
through progressing our intention to 
develop dedicated biomass power plants. 
However, regulatory certainty and 
appropriate support are critical to realising 
our ambitions and we continue to further 
our research and development work 
on biomass ahead of receiving the 
Government’s pronouncements on 
the regulatory and market framework.
Environmental performance 
and compliance
we recognise our responsibilities to society 
and the environment and are committed 
to furthering the environmental leadership 
position we hold in the coal-fired sector. 
we have environmental policies in 
operation at both Drax Power station 
and Haven Power Limited (“Haven Power”).
At Drax Power station, we manage our 
environmental compliance under an 
environmental Management system 
(“eMs”). During 2010, our eMs was 
externally audited and we were successful 
in being recertified to the international 
standard isO 14001: 2004.

Business review
“ we tightly manage the 
wastes produced on site 
to maximise recycling 
and minimise landfill.”
we freely discuss our environmental 
performance and activities with our 
stakeholders and are sensitive to their 
views and concerns. Amongst our staff, 
business partners and contractors we 
promote environmental awareness, 
ensuring that they understand the 
environmental aspects of their activities, 
that they act responsibly and are 
competent to undertake their duties.
we are pleased to report that there were 
no major breaches of our environmental 
consents during the year. 
Emissions to air
we maintain investment in our emissions 
abatement equipment and consider this to 
be a high priority. Our current equipment, 
namely the flue gas desulphurisation 
facility and combustion systems to reduce 
emissions of nitrogen oxides (“nOX”), 
ensure compliance with environmental 
limits to 2016. we have a programme 
in place to identify the optimum means 
of compliance beyond that date.
Discharges to water
The availability of water is key to the 
operations of the power station and it is 
important that it is managed sustainably. 
There are three sources of water supplying 
the station – river, aquifer and mains. 
Procedures are in place to ensure that all 
discharges and drainage to water are 
monitored and treated where necessary 
to meet our discharge consent limits. 
Approximately half of the water is returned 
to the river Ouse a few degrees warmer 
than the river at the discharge point.
in 2010, 0.83 tonnes of water per Gwh of 
electricity generated was used by the 
power station, continuing the year-on-year 
reduction since 2005.
Disposals to land
The Group has invested in infrastructure, 
including rail loading facilities, to maximise 
sales of the ash products to avoid the use 
of landfill. This has enabled 66% of the 
1.5 million tonnes of ash produced in 2010 
to be sold to the construction industry 
as a replacement for virgin aggregates, 
fillers and cement. 
when ash is unable to be sold it is sent 
to the power station’s ash disposal site. 
The site is managed responsibly with 
completed areas restored to use as 
farmland and high biodiversity woodland, 
which is home to over a hundred species 
of wildlife in total. The careful planting and 
management of the restored areas has 
seen the number of un red list species 
on the site increase from seven in 2007 
to the nine found at the last survey.
we pay landfill tax on the ash disposed 
of to the ash disposal site. Through the 
Landfill Communities Fund, we are able 
to claim a tax credit against our donations 
to recognised environmental bodies. 
we have worked with Groundwork north 
Yorkshire since 2001 on projects designed 
to help mitigate the effects of landfill 
upon our local community. During 2010, 
we contributed £80,500 towards local 
community-based projects designed to 
bring about sustainable environmental 
benefits and contribute to the social and 
economic regeneration of the area. This 
brings the total amount provided by Drax 
to the Fund since 2001 to over £1 million.
Other wastes generated as part of the 
operation and maintenance of the power 
station are managed to maximise recycling 
and minimise the use of landfill in their 
disposal. This has resulted in 84% of 
the 4,306 tonnes of waste generated 
on site being diverted from landfill, 
with 3,531 tonnes of the diversion coming 
from recycling or composting.
Alternative fuels
To help maintain our vital role in the uK 
economy and safeguard cost effective 
power production, our fuel strategy 
recognises the need to sustain a ready 
supply of traditional quality coal and 
how best to incorporate alternative 
fuels, including different fossil fuels and 
renewable biomass materials. The choice 
of fuels has to be balanced with availability 
and flexibility of supply. 
A considerable amount of environmental 
data on the combustion of petcoke, a fuel 
derived from the petroleum industry, has 
been collected and analysed, where 
possible using independent specialists. 
in line with our policy on openness and 
transparency all data are discussed with 
the environment Agency and local councils. 
The combustion of petcoke is now an 
integral part of our strategy of developing 
and utilising alternative fuels and during 
the year we burnt 210,000 tonnes.

supply chain
non-fuel procurement
we have in place a rigorous set of checks 
and measures to ensure that our suppliers 
meet certain pre-determined standards. 
As part of our tender process, information 
is sought from prospective suppliers on 
health and safety, environmental and 
quality standards, which is taken into 
account during the assessment and 
selection process. At times, this may 
prompt further requests for information. 
Financial reviews of supply companies 
are also undertaken.
Compliance with current and foreseeable 
legislation is mandatory. in making 
purchases we are mindful that some 
companies or indeed countries may have 
poor ethical standards or human rights 
issues. Covering, as we do, a varied 
marketplace with a number of indirect 
manufacturers supporting the end product, 
it is impossible for us to be certain that 
we do not indirectly trade with companies 
or countries whose standards are poor. 
However, we do not knowingly support or 
trade with such companies or countries and 
we remain alert to changing circumstances.
we work hard to develop and maintain 
an open dialogue with suppliers. we have 
found site visits to key suppliers and 
prospective key suppliers to be useful 
in encouraging that dialogue and also 
as part of the assessment and selection 
process. During 2010, ten such visits 
were completed. 
in 2010, we initiated performance meetings 
with suppliers. seven key suppliers were 
targeted and we were able to undertake 
a thorough review of their overall 
performance, covering aspects such as 
spend, safety, environmental and quality 
performance, productivity and areas for 
improvement or innovation.
Although we encourage local and national 
companies to bid for contracts to supply 
the many goods and services required by 
the Group, we recognise that meeting some 
of our business needs demands specialist 
skills and these are sought accordingly. 
Biomass sustainability and procurement
we regard biomass use as a high priority 
not only to reduce the carbon footprint 
of the Group, but to reduce the carbon 
footprint of uK electricity generation 
and increase the proportion of the 
uK’s energy coming from renewable 
and sustainable sources. we believe it is 
a prerequisite that any biomass used for 
energy should be sustainable. This makes 
sense from a business perspective, 
providing longevity of feedstock. it is also 
essential for environmental, economic 
and social reasons.
we have implemented comprehensive 
sustainability criteria into our biomass 
procurement activities with the aim 
of assuring both the availability and 
sustainability of biomass supplies. 
These include a high level set of principles 
committing the Group to progressively 
improving the sustainability performance 
of our suppliers. 
Our procurement process is designed to 
ensure that the production and delivery 
of biomass will:
 
k significantly reduce greenhouse 
gas emissions compared to coal-fired 
generation and, where possible, 
give preference to biomass sources 
that maximise this benefit;
 
k not result in a net release of carbon from 
the vegetation and soil of either forests 
or agricultural lands;
 
k not endanger food supply or 
communities where the use of biomass 
is essential for subsistence (for example 
heat, medicines, building materials);
 
k not adversely affect protected or 
vulnerable biodiversity and where 
possible will give preference to biomass 
production that strengthens biodiversity;
 
k deploy good practices to protect and/or 
improve soil, water (both ground and 
surface) and air quality;
 
k contribute to local prosperity in the 
area of supply chain management 
and biomass production; and
 
k contribute to the social wellbeing of 
employees and the local population 
in the area of the biomass production.
These criteria were designed in the 
absence of national or international 
legislation, to meet or exceed any likely 
emerging standards across the whole 
sustainability spectrum of life cycle, social 
and environmental issues. we note that 
the sector is continually changing and our 
management systems and procurement 
policies will have to be structured to 
address legislation which is emerging 
as biomass production attracts an even 
higher profile amongst Government 
and other stakeholders. 
Although the anticipated development 
of credible international sustainability 
schemes for bioliquids and biomass has 
been slow, our initiative has been extremely 
valuable since our policy stands up well 
against the legislative proposals from 
the Department of energy and Climate 
Change. These require that, from April 2011, 
generators will have to report on 
greenhouse gas savings and whether 
they meet certain criteria on land use. 
From April 2013, generators over 1Mw 
capacity will have to comply with those 
standards in order to receive renewables 
Obligation Certificates.
recognising that formal, mandatory 
international standards will, in time, be 
derived it is evident that the experience 
gained by our suppliers through 
implementing our policy will be beneficial 
to them as clarity in the eventual definition 
of sustainability standards and associated 
methodologies is developed. To aid this 
process, and to ensure compliance with 
future legislation, we have engaged 
qualified third parties to develop and 
implement a rigorous audit of our biomass 
supply chains to ensure compliance with 
our principles. 
we have adopted the target of a minimum 
annual saving of 70% in greenhouse gas 
emissions for the biomass materials burnt 
at Drax Power station. Our calculations 
show that substantial benefits of the 
order of 70%–90% savings were generally 
achieved across the range of biomass 
materials burnt in 2010. This provides good 
reassurance that the current suppliers and 
procurement practices are robust.

Business review
“ we are committed 
to developing 
and maintaining a 
positive health and 
safety culture.”
During 2010, we met with five key 
non-governmental organisations in 
order to discuss our biomass sustainability 
work. The meetings allowed open and 
honest discussion about our policy and 
practice, and were generally positive, 
with our sustainability and life cycle 
analysis model and our “industry-leading” 
approach welcomed.
Coal procurement
we purchase around 8-9 million tonnes of 
steam coal each year. we buy from a range 
of sources with the objective of managing 
our commercial exposures and 
environmental obligations. Around half of 
the coal we purchase is from uK deep and 
surface mines and the remainder from 
mines around the world, including usA, 
Colombia and russia.
As responsible procurers we work within a 
strong corporate compliance framework. 
The suitability of each of our suppliers 
is checked through our counterparty 
approval and “know your customer” 
processes. in addition, when buying from 
overseas we have introduced a process 
of documenting, in our contracts, the 
minimum standards we expect from our 
suppliers in respect of compliance with 
legislation, human rights, labour relations, 
health and safety arrangements and 
business ethics.
Health and safety
Health and safety is at the heart of our 
corporate responsibility. Protecting our 
employees, contractors and all visitors 
from injury is fundamental to our business 
philosophy. we are committed to 
developing and maintaining a positive 
health and safety culture in which statutory 
requirements are viewed as a minimum 
standard and leading performance as 
our goal.

Attaining leading performance
The lost time injury rate and total 
recordable injury rate for 2010 at 0.13 and 
0.26 respectively remain industry-leading. 
Maintaining this level of performance 
is commendable given the significant 
construction work that took place during 
the year and number of man-hours worked, 
which at the Drax Power station site 
totalled some 3.2 million. Our safety record 
continues to compare very favourably with 
that of our sector peers and international 
benchmarks. Amongst global comparator 
coal-fired power stations we are ahead 
of the european and world Pacesetter 
group for total recordable injury rate, 
which is a clear indication that the safety 
management system implemented in the 
last few years is now delivering sustained 
levels of performance.
The Group has been successful in retaining 
certification of its Health and safety 
Management system to the internationally 
recognised Occupational Health and safety 
standard, OHsAs 18001, at the Drax Power 
station site and has recently attained 
certification for the Group’s straw pellet 
plant, based at Goole in the east riding 
of Yorkshire. Drax is proud to be one of 
a select group of large coal-fired power 
stations in the country to hold this 
standard, which is approved by Lloyd’s 
register Quality Assurance. in addition to 
this, the Group was delighted, once again, 
to be awarded the rosPA Gold Medal 
Award having achieved Gold Award 
standards for six consecutive years.
Processes underpinning performance
The Production integrity Management 
system (“PiMs”) continues to provide 
the platform the business needs to deliver 
continuous improvement of business 
critical systems which are fundamental 
to the safe and effective operation of the 
power station.
“spotlight on safety” (“sOs”) is our 
implementation of the internationally 
proven DuPont™ sTOP™ programme. This 
behavioural safety programme is coupled 
with the Drax “Four Pillars of safety”:
1 Task risk Assessment (“TrA”) 
2 “safety Kick-Off” start of shift safety briefing 
3 Dynamic point of work risk assessment (“POwrA”)
4 weekly safety Meeting 
The Four Pillars and sOs give us the 
framework we need for open engagement 
between operatives and supervisors. 
Together these tools allow us to develop 
the defensive behaviours which are a 
fundamental component of the robust 
world-class safety culture we aspire to 
create and maintain.
specific processes and procedures 
are also in place to clarify the general 
health and safety responsibilities for 
the effective supervision, control and 
monitoring of contractors in accordance 
with current legislation and regulations. 
The arrangements are built around an 
understanding that the Group and its 
contractors have a responsibility to protect 
each other, their respective workforces and 
others, such as visitors. An internal audit 
process is used to ensure compliance.
More generally, compulsory health and 
safety induction courses are tailored to 
suit a range of individuals and their on-site 
activities. in total, six courses have been 
introduced covering, at one end of the 
spectrum, accompanied visitors, right 
through to those employees or contractors 
working on large scale operational projects.

safety leadership and recognition
The Group is constantly striving to improve 
the critical safety leadership contribution 
required from first line supervisors. 
The expectations of both management 
and supervisors continue to be reaffirmed 
in the safety Leadership Charter.
The annual safety Conference for 
contractors and staff continues to be a 
focal point. in 2010, 110 people attended. 
Held early in the year, the conference 
sets expectations for the coming year’s 
performance.
Our “weekly safety bulletin” briefing 
process provides a fast-track 
communication vehicle to reach all those 
working on the site. we use the process to 
draw attention to specific safety issues and 
our performance record, and to recognise 
achievements. Active engagement in the 
safety briefing process is a job requirement. 
A Health and safety Advisory Committee 
(“HesAC”), which brings together a range 
of employees, including trade union 
representatives, safety representatives, 
occupational health and management team 
members, continues to play a vital role 
in facilitating staff consultation on health 
and safety issues, and driving standards 
upwards. During 2010, the Corporate 
HesAC Group was launched. Focusing 
on engagement with corporate staff, 
the group has a unique set of targets 
and a reporting line back to HesAC 
on a quarterly basis.
People working on the site at all levels 
who have demonstrated safety leadership 
have been given recognition awards.
Our active involvement with the 
programmes of our trade body, 
the Association of electricity Producers 
and the Coal Generators Forum, GensiP, 
continues to provide new ideas and a 
stimulus to drive our health and safety 
improvement efforts forward.

Employment
The Group employed 1,080 people at the 
year end. Most of our employees work  
full-time and are on permanent contracts.
Our quarterly employee Opinion survey, 
conducted at Drax Power station and Goole 
straw Pellet Plant, shows that 80% of our 
employees are proud to work for Drax, and 
other measures of engagement are also 
high. For example, the annual resignation 
rate at Drax Power station is only 1%, and 
over 40% of the workforce has been with 
the Group for 20 years or more. This high 
level of retention is positive for Drax, as our 
power generation business requires levels 
of skill and experience which are difficult to 
source externally. Absence rates are also 
very low at around 2%.
staff turnover at Haven Power is higher, 
reflecting the nature of the business, 
averaging 27% in the sales team and 
11% in other areas of the business.
we work to achieve high standards in 
employment practices, for example, 
through the avoidance of discriminatory 
practices, and the speedy and clear 
resolution of queries and grievances. 
we review our policies and procedures on 
a regular basis to ensure legal compliance 
and improved service levels.
Employee relations
At Drax Power station, 530 people 
(70% of the workforce) are covered 
by collective bargaining arrangements. 
Formal negotiation and consultation takes 
place through the Company Committee – 
a joint management and union body that 
meets regularly to discuss working practices 
and terms and conditions of employment 
for production employees, and to receive 
updates on the Group’s strategy.
in 2010, we agreed a long-term pay deal 
for all employees in the collective bargaining 
unit, that is, all production employees 
up to and including technical grades. 
The pay deal extends to 31 December 2012, 
providing a platform for continuing stable 
employee relations ahead.
All employees in corporate functions, 
Haven Power and senior production 
staff are employed on personal contracts, 
which are not covered by collective 
bargaining. Formal information and 
consultation arrangements are in place for 
these groups of staff, so that any proposals 
for change can be discussed openly and 
with sufficient time to build in revisions 
arising out of the consultation.
learning and development
Our personal and career development 
processes are designed to ensure that 
all our people have the technical skills, 
management and leadership competencies, 
and personal behaviours needed to achieve 
the business Plan. every employee has a 
personal appraisal and development plan, 
including targets which are reviewed and 
assessed formally through interim and final 
appraisal discussions with their manager. 
Personal development plans include 
both technical training and behavioural 
development, which are delivered through 
a rolling programme of internal and 
external learning events. 
For approved external training 
programmes, our employees receive 
financial support, for example, course 
fees and expenses. each year we recruit 
up to six new employees for a fully 
sponsored four year advanced modern 
apprenticeship in power station operations 
and engineering maintenance. we currently 
have 18 apprentices at different stages of 
the programme.

Business review
we accommodate work experience 
requests and support local schools 
and colleges with their career events, 
as well as supporting Drax employees 
to be school governors.
At Haven Power, our new team leaders 
completed a development programme 
entitled “Light, Power and energy”. 
All team managers undertake training 
to assist them in their role in respect 
of staff induction, conduct and capability, 
and absence management.
Throughout the Group we have a rolling 
programme of health and safety and 
first aid refresher training, to underpin 
the safety culture which is central to 
all operations. 
internal communications 
we use a variety of communication 
channels to ensure that all colleagues 
are kept fully informed of developments 
in the Group’s operations and have an 
opportunity to provide feedback.
Our “flagship” communication channel 
at Drax Power station is Open Forum, 
a series of face-to-face meetings where the 
Chief executive and executive Committee 
present business updates to small groups, 
followed by an open question and answer 
session. The Open Forums, which are 
scheduled to accommodate the power 
station’s operational resource 
requirements, cover every shift pattern 
so that all employees have an opportunity 
to attend. This year we have used a variety 
of media at the Open Forum, including 
DvDs featuring colleagues across the 
business. Feedback about the Open Forums 
is very positive, as reflected in our opinion 
survey scores.
in addition, our all-employee communication 
methods include monthly team briefs, 
a twice yearly in-house magazine, 
and e-mail and intranet communications. 
At Haven Power there is a well-established 
framework of individual one-to-one 
discussions and team meetings. This year 
the operations team introduced “Did you 
know?”, a fortnightly brief designed to 
provide useful information on team, system 
and process development. 
each month following the Haven Power 
board meeting, members of the senior 
management team conduct briefing 
sessions that all staff are invited to 
attend. These sessions update staff on 
the progress of the business and provide 
an opportunity to raise questions and 
to discuss any concerns.
Performance and reward
Pay and benefits at Drax are attractive 
and match or exceed the best in the 
industry sector and the local area. 
we benchmark our salaries and benefits 
at every level against the industry sector 
and the market as a whole. we also 
participate in specialist industry meetings 
to exchange information and developments 
in employment policy.
Through a range of share plans we encourage 
all employees to build a personal stake in 
the ownership of the business.
Recognition
The achievements of our staff have been 
rightly recognised through a number of 
awards from external bodies during 2010. 
Our biomass co-firing project was awarded 
first place in the environment category of 
the utility industry Achievement Awards. 
These prestigious awards recognise the 
outstanding achievements of the utility 
and energy industry and reflect innovation, 
outstanding service, efficiency and quality. 
we also received “highly commended” 
in the supply Chain excellence category, 
for success in introducing sustainability 
standards to the biomass supply chain.
The Forest Footprint Disclosure Project is 
an innovative initiative assisting businesses 
in assessing their impact on the world’s 
forests. For the second year running, 
Drax was ranked as the leader in the 
utilities sector based on the comprehensive 
sustainability criteria in our business 
procurement activities. 
Our straw pellet plant won the east riding 
of Yorkshire Council Chairman’s business 
Award for businesses with under 50 
employees. The awards are presented 
annually by the Council to individuals, 
companies and organisations within the 
east riding of Yorkshire in recognition 
of their achievements towards enhancing 
the area in which they work and live.
in addition to receiving recognition for 
our project work, we were also delighted 
to be acknowledged for upholding good 
governance and professional standards at 
the iCsA (institute of Chartered secretaries 
and Administrators) Hermes Transparency 
in Governance Awards, where we received 
the “best sustainability and stakeholder 
disclosure – FTse250” award for our 2009 
Annual report and accounts. 
Health and wellbeing
we are committed to promoting the health 
and wellbeing of all our staff and ensuring 
a professional response to all first aid and 
emergency situations that occur. 
Our occupational health team undertakes 
regular programmes to screen colleagues 
who are in contact with high noise levels 
and sensitive respiratory conditions. 
everyone working in operational 
areas has a medical every three years. 
Health surveillance, such as hearing tests, 
lung function tests and eyesight tests 
are completed in accordance with risk, 
exposure and Health and safety executive 
requirements. 
Pension provision and retired employees
Many of our employees are members of 
the Drax Power Group of the electricity 
supply Pension scheme, which was 
closed to new entrants in 2002. since then, 
Drax employees have joined the Group 
Personal Pension Plan or the Haven 
Power Personal Pension Plan, which are 
both actively promoted to new recruits.
we offer paid pre-retirement leave and 
pre-retirement courses to help people 
transition smoothly from working life 
to their new life.
each year we invite over 350 Drax 
pensioners to a celebratory event at 
Christmas. The retired employees 
Association organise trips and other events 
during the course of the year for people 
who have retired from the Group.
sports and social Club
employees can join the Drax sports 
and social Club for a nominal monthly 
subscription through the payroll. 
The sports and social Club, which 
is also open to public subscription, 
offers an extensive range of facilities.

stakeholder engagement 
and community relations 
Engaging with our stakeholders
Like many businesses, our stakeholders 
are many and diverse, including our 
shareholders, employees, customers, 
suppliers, the local community, 
Government, non-governmental 
organisations, regulators, opinion formers 
and the media. Communication with all 
our stakeholders is considered to be an 
essential part of our business and we aim 
to be open and transparent in all that we 
do. reference has been already made to 
specific stakeholder engagement practice 
and exercises throughout the Corporate 
and social responsibility review; below we 
touch on other aspects of our stakeholder 
engagement commitments, from investor 
relations to community relations.
investor relations
Drax is committed to delivering shareholder 
value. we communicate our results and 
prospects to our shareholders in an 
accurate and timely manner using a variety 
of channels. in addition to the Annual 
General Meeting, we communicate 
through our Annual report and accounts, 
Half year report, interim Management 
statements and Trading updates. All of 
these documents are made available 
on our website at www.draxgroup.plc.uk. 
significant matters relating to trading 
and the development of the business 
are disseminated to the market by 
way of announcements via a regulatory 
information service and those 
announcements appear as soon 
as practicable on our website.
Announcements are frequently followed 
up with either conference calls or 
presentations to provide further detail 
and greater understanding. in addition, 
face-to-face meetings are held with our 
major institutional shareholders, again to 
assist them in their understanding of the 
announcements, but also to ensure that 
the board is aware of their views and 
concerns. in 2010, a formal meeting 
programme was conducted in the uK 
after each of the Preliminary and Half 
year results announcements and we 
undertook investor visits to the united 
states and mainland europe during the 
year. To aid our communication with 
private investors, the investor section of 
our website has been developed to be a 
readily accessible and transparent source 
of information to enhance understanding 
of the business.
External relations
As in previous years, we maintained our 
engagement with public affairs audiences 
on issues with implications for our business. 
with a General election during the year 
and energy policy still high on the political 
agenda, we had significant engagement 
with Parliamentarians and officials at all 
levels on issues including forthcoming 
environmental legislation, renewables 
policy, and market reform issues. 
The form of engagement was varied and 
included both face-to-face and written 
briefings, participation in public 
consultations, written evidence to inquiries, 
and visits by Parliamentarians and officials 
to Drax Power station. As in the past, 
trade association membership proved 
useful during the year. The ability to meet 
with and discuss issues of the day with 
other interested parties has facilitated 
representation of collective positions on 
energy policy matters. 
Locally, we have continued to engage with 
parish, town, district and county councillors 
and officers, with the intention of keeping 
them up to date with our business issues 
and developments. Our regular 
communication channel with these and 
other local opinion formers takes the form 
of an annual consultative meeting, and 
three meetings each year with our local 
parish and town councillors.
we maintained a programme of 
engagement with local stakeholders within 
the vicinities of the planned developments 
of dedicated biomass power stations. 
Through the use of exhibitions, newsletters, 
press releases, information on our website 
and a freephone line we aimed to ensure 
that local people had the opportunity 
to study our proposals and discuss issues 
with members of the project team. 
no political donations were made in the 
uK or elsewhere during 2010, and the 
Group’s contact with those active in the 
political arena has been and will continue 
to be aimed solely at the promotion of 
the Group’s business interests.
Community relations
we are committed to being a good neighbour 
to our local community and our “caring for 
the community” philosophy involves being 
part of local and regional communities. 
Our involvement takes the form of 
sponsoring a variety of local charities and 
fund raising events, promoting our own 
campaigns which focus on the three themes 
of youth sport, education and the environment, 
and maintaining open communication 
channels and good working relationships 
with the region’s key opinion formers.
sponsorship and fundraising
During 2010, we gave financial support 
of £131,450 (2009: £138,930) in total 
across a range of charitable and 
non-charitable community causes. 
Of that total, charitable donations 
amounted to £87,384 (2009: £88,041).
some £18,000 of the total donations 
were made under the direction of our 
sponsorship team, across a range of 
activities within a 20-mile radius of the 
power station. each month the team meets 
to consider requests received for charitable 
donations and community sponsorship 
and makes awards against our criteria of 
furthering community, environmental and 
sporting interests. examples of the good 
causes supported through the sponsorship 
team in 2010 are donations to Camblesforth 
Community Primary school to enhance 
their existing music lessons through the 
provision of tuition to develop instrumental 
skills and to vixen radio to soundproof the 
radio station’s new studio.
Drax also operates a “£ for £” and Give As 
You earn matching scheme, under which 
we match any monies raised for, or donated 
to, charity by employees. During 2010, 
approximately £46,700 of the total donations 
made were through this scheme.
“ During the year we had 
significant engagement 
with Parliamentarians 
and officials at all levels.”
“ we communicate our 
results and prospects 
to our shareholders in 
an accurate and timely 
manner using a variety

Business review
now in its sixth year, the outage charity 
scheme raised £4,500 during the year’s 
single outage. Through the scheme £500 
is donated for every seven days that goes 
by without an injury requiring more than 
first aid treatment. As in previous years 
the money was divided equally between 
charities chosen by Drax staff and our 
contractors. Candlelighters, a Yorkshire-
based charity providing services and 
support to children with cancer and their 
families, and Goole Drop-in, a drop-in centre 
for young people between the age of 
16 and 25 were the nominated charities.
Through two schemes focused on safety 
performance, the Yorkshire Air Ambulance, 
which provides a crucial emergency service 
for the region, received a total donation of 
£5,000. Of the total, £4,000 was raised 
through staff and contractors delivering 
zero recordable injuries during part of the 
construction of the new biomass co-firing 
facility. This was boosted with a further 
£1,000 from a similar scheme applied to 
the whole Drax site.
For the fourth year running we held a 
charity corporate golf tournament at the 
championship course at Fulford, York. 
The event raised a further £9,205 for 
the Yorkshire Air Ambulance.
Education in the community
we provide a choice of educational 
experiences hosted by our team of power 
station guides and, at times, technical 
experts. A state-of-the-art visitor centre is 
of particular interest to students of all ages 
allowing them to explore the properties of 
electricity, discover how a power station 
works and consider the environmental 
issues related to electricity generation.
Combined with a tour of the power 
station students can learn about the basic 
principles and development of electricity 
generation, the role of different fuels in 
electricity generation, trading of electricity, 
environmental issues related to burning 
fossil fuels, the recycling of by-products 
and the role of a large industrial complex 
in the local economy and community.
Another visitor opportunity exists at our 
skylark Centre that lies at the heart of our 
ash disposal site. A nature reserve has been 
established there to provide a haven for 
over 100 species of wildlife. it is specially 
designed to help schoolchildren understand 
more about the natural habitat and ecology 
of the area.
educational visits are complemented by 
classroom and laboratory facilities where 
teachers and students can discuss and 
investigate the results of pond dipping, 
a bugs and grubs hunt, or a nature trail 
walk through woodland areas.
Our “Cricket in the Community” initiative 
launched in May 2006 has continued 
to prove popular with local schools. 
The england and wales Cricket board 
qualified coaches on our staff, together 
with england ladies’ cricketer, Katherine 
brunt, took cricket coaching to schools 
in the local area as part of our support for 
education and to promote sports learning 
as part of the national Curriculum.
strengthening our links with the game of 
cricket, for the fourth year we ran the Drax 
Cup, a cricket competition for teams of girls 
and boys under the age of nine. Over 300 
primary schools across Yorkshire took part 
in the knock-out tournament organised 
by the Yorkshire County Cricket Club 
(“Yorkshire CCC”) in conjunction with the 
Yorkshire Cricket board and the Yorkshire 
schools’ Cricket Association. The semi-
finals and final were played at Headingley 
Carnegie stadium, the home of Yorkshire 
CCC and a long-standing venue for test 
matches and one-day internationals. 
This year the winning school was 
Alwoodley Primary school, Leeds.
under the “Art in the Community” banner, 
we held our fourth art competition for 
primary and secondary schools. some 16 
schools participated and the winners and 
their schools shared in prize money 
totalling over £2,500. 
we also held a two-day art masterclass run 
by David Anderson, a designer, illustrator 
and watercolourist, and a Fellow of the 
royal society of Arts. David provided 
expert advice and guidance to the young 
artists, all aged seven to 13, who were able 
to try out various techniques and explore 
the world of art and illustration, from 
caricature and collage to watercolour 
and mixed media. Over the two days, the 
aspiring artists each produced a segment 
of a panoramic image of the power station, 
using a variety of media which, when 
pieced together, will measure 3m x 1.5m 
and be on display at Drax Power station. 
Visitors to Drax
Thousands of visitors are welcomed to 
the power station every year. The appeal 
of discovering more about how power 
is produced and the sheer scale of the 
site and its associated activities attracts 
schools and colleges as well as business 
organisations and associations. During 2010, 
we played host to some 7,500 visitors. 
For three sundays in the run-up to 
Christmas, we converted the skylark 
Centre into a santa’s Grotto. The attraction 
proved popular with local residents, some 
900 people came to visit the grotto and 
through their generosity £500 was raised 
for selby Hands of Hope, a charity helping 
to fund groups and activities in the local 
area. we donated an additional £1,000 to 
the charity in lieu of purchasing corporate 
Christmas cards.
“ each month the 
sponsorship team meets 
to consider requests 
received for donations 
and sponsorship.”

DIRECTORS’ REPORT 
42 
The directors present their report for Drax Group plc, together with the consolidated financial statements of the Drax group of 
companies, for the year ended 31 December 2010.  
Annual General Meeting 
The Annual General Meeting (“AGM”) of the Company will be held on 13 April 2011, at The City Presentation Centre, 4 Chiswell Street, 
London EC1Y 4UP at 11.30am. A separate document accompanying this report contains the notice convening the AGM and a 
description of the business to be conducted. 
Corporate governance 
The Group is committed to high standards of corporate governance, details of which are given in this Directors’ report and the 
Corporate governance, Audit Committee, Nominations Committee and Remuneration Committee reports set out on pages 48 to 72.  
The various sections of this report contain in summary certain provisions of the Company’s current Articles of Association (the 
“Articles”) and applicable English law concerning companies (the Companies Act 2006). This is a summary only and the relevant 
provisions of the Articles or the Companies Act should be consulted if further information is required. 
Business review 
A review of the development and performance of the business of the Group during the year ended 31 December 2010, including the 
financial performance during the year, an analysis of the position of the Group at the end of the financial year, key performance 
indicators, a description of the principal risks and uncertainties facing the Group, and forward-looking statements can be found in 
the Business review on pages 2 to 39. The Business review incorporates the Chairman’s introduction, Maximising the value of the 
Drax business, Delivering results, Chief Executive’s statement, How we are performing, Marketplace, Operational and financial 
performance, Principal risks and uncertainties and the Corporate and social responsibility review and the reports under the broad 
heading of Corporate governance as referred to above. The Business review is a constituent part of this Directors’ report. 
The purpose of this Annual report and accounts is to provide information to members of the Company. It contains certain forward-
looking statements relating to the operations, performance and financial condition of the Group. By their nature these statements 
involve uncertainty since future events and circumstances can differ from those anticipated. Nothing in this Annual report and 
accounts should be construed as a profit forecast.  
Principal activities 
Drax Group plc is the holding company of the Drax group of companies. The principal activities of the Group are the generation 
and sale of electricity at the Drax Power Station, Selby, North Yorkshire and the sale of by-products of the electricity generation 
process. The Group also has an electricity supply business, Haven Power Limited (“Haven Power”), which serves business customers. 
Haven Power is a direct subsidiary of the Group’s principal trading subsidiary, Drax Power Limited.  
Results 
The Group results for the year are shown in the Consolidated income statement on page 74. 
Going concern 
The Group’s business activities, financial position, and principal risks and uncertainties are set out in the Business review as 
referenced above. In addition note 18 of the consolidated financial statements includes details of the Group’s borrowings, financial 
instruments, and hedging activities, together with its exposure to credit and liquidity risk and how it manages its capital. 
The directors’ consideration of the going concern basis is set out specifically on page 26. The Group’s forecasts and projections, 
taking account of reasonably possible changes in trading performance, show that the Group should be able to operate within its 
available facilities. 
The directors have a reasonable expectation that the Company and the Group have adequate resources to continue in operational 
existence for the foreseeable future. Thus they continue to adopt the going concern basis of accounting in preparing these 
consolidated and company accounts. 
Risk identification, assessment and management 
A summary of the Group’s position regarding risk identification is set out on page 52, risk assessment and management is set on 
pages 28 and 29 and the use of financial instruments is contained in note 18, as is the identification and assessment of financial risk.

Share capital 
The Company has only one class of equity shares, which are ordinary shares. There are no restrictions on the voting rights of the 
ordinary shares. 
At 1 January 2010, 364,853,890 ordinary shares of 1116⁄29 pence each in the Company were in issue and at 31 December 2010, 
364,859,988 ordinary shares of 1116⁄29 pence each in the Company were in issue. The following paragraphs detail the changes to the 
share capital during the year. 
Issue of shares 
Subject to the provisions of the Companies Act relating to authority and pre-emption rights and to any resolution of the Company in 
a General Meeting, all unissued shares of the Company shall be at the disposal of the directors and they may allot (with or without 
conferring a right of renunciation), grant options over or otherwise dispose of them to such persons, at such times and on such 
terms as they think proper. 
On 1 September 2010, a total of 6,098 ordinary shares of 1116/29 pence each in the Company were issued in satisfaction of shares 
vesting in accordance with the rules of the Group’s Bonus Matching Plan to six individuals whose employment with the Group had 
terminated due to retirement. The shares issued represented 0.002% of the Company’s issued ordinary share capital prior to those 
shares being issued. No other ordinary shares were issued during the year. 
Authority to purchase own shares 
At the Annual General Meeting of the Company held on 21 April 2010, shareholders resolved to authorise the Company to make 
market purchases of up to 10% of the issued ordinary share capital. At the forthcoming AGM, shareholders will be asked to renew 
this authority. Details are contained in the Notice of the AGM.  
The Company did not purchase any of its own shares during 2010 and the Company held no Treasury shares during 2010. 
Details of the share capital as at 31 December 2010, and shares issued during the year, are given in note 21 on page 96. 
Rights and obligations attaching to shares 
The rights and obligations attaching to the ordinary shares are set out in the Articles. The Articles may only be changed by the 
shareholders by special resolution.  
Variation of rights 
Subject to statute, the Articles specify that rights attached to any class of shares may be varied with the written consent of the 
holders of not less than three-quarters in nominal value of the issued shares of that class, or with the sanction of an extraordinary 
resolution passed at a separate General Meeting of the holders of those shares. At every such separate General Meeting the quorum 
shall be two persons holding or representing by proxy at least one-third in nominal value of the issued shares of the class (calculated 
excluding any shares held as Treasury shares). The rights conferred upon the holders of any shares shall not, unless otherwise 
expressly provided in the rights attaching to those shares, be deemed to be varied by the creation or issue of further shares ranking 
pari passu with them.

DIRECTORS’ REPORT 
44 
Transfer of shares 
All transfers of shares which are in certificated form may be effected by transfer in writing in any usual or common form or in any 
other form acceptable to the directors and may be under hand only. The instrument of transfer shall be signed by or on behalf of the 
transferor and (except in the case of fully paid shares) by or on behalf of the transferee. The transferor shall remain the holder of 
the shares concerned until the name of the transferee is entered in the register. All transfers of shares which are in uncertificated 
form may be effected by means of the CREST system. 
The directors may decline to recognise any instrument of transfer relating to shares in certificated form unless it:  
(a) is in respect of only one class of share; and 
(b) is lodged at the transfer office (duly stamped if required) accompanied by the relevant share certificate(s) and such other 
evidence as the directors may reasonably require to show the right of the transferor to make the transfer (and, if the instrument 
of transfer is executed by some other person on his/her behalf, the authority of that person so to do). 
The directors may, in the case of shares in certificated form, in their absolute discretion and without assigning any reason therefore, 
refuse to register any transfer of shares (not being fully paid shares) provided that, where any such shares are admitted to the 
Official List of the London Stock Exchange, such discretion may not be exercised in such a way as to prevent dealings in the shares 
of that class from taking place on an open and proper basis. The directors may also refuse to register an allotment or transfer of 
shares (whether fully paid or not) in favour of more than four persons jointly.  
If the directors refuse to register an allotment or transfer, they shall send within two months after the date on which the letter 
of allotment or transfer was lodged with the Company, to the allottee or transferee, notice of the refusal.  
A shareholder does not need to obtain the approval of the Company, or of other shareholders of shares in the Company, for a 
transfer of shares to take place.  
The Articles provide that directors must give reasons for any refusal to register a transfer of shares in accordance with the 
Companies Act. 
Shares in uncertificated form 
Directors may determine that any class of shares may be held in uncertificated form and title to such shares may be transferred by 
means of a relevant system or that shares of any class should cease to be held and transferred. Subject to the provisions of the 
Companies Act, the CREST Regulations and every other statute, statutory instrument, regulation or order for the time being in force 
concerning companies and affecting the Company, the directors may determine that any class of shares held on the branch register 
of members of the Company resident in South Africa or any other overseas branch register of the members of the Company may be 
held in uncertificated form in accordance with any system outside the UK which enables title to such shares to be evidenced and 
transferred without a written instrument and which is a relevant system. The provisions of the Articles shall not apply to shares 
of any class which are in uncertificated form to the extent that the Articles are inconsistent with the holding of shares of that 
class in uncertificated form, the transfer of title to shares of that class by means of a relevant system or any provision of the 
CREST Regulations.

Directors 
The current directors are Tim Barker, Charles Berry, Tim Cobbold, Peter Emery, Mike Grasby, David Lindsell, Tony Quinlan, 
Dorothy Thompson and Tony Thorne. Biographical notes of the directors appear on pages 40 and 41.  
Jamie Dundas retired as a director at the conclusion of the AGM on 21 April 2010, due to other work commitments. Tony Thorne and 
Tim Cobbold were appointed to the Board on 29 June 2010 and 27 September 2010 respectively pursuant to Article 79 of the 
Company’s Articles of Association. 
No other person served as a director or as an alternate director at any time during the year. 
The Articles require that, following appointment to the Board, directors submit themselves for election by shareholders at the first 
AGM following their appointment. Tony Thorne and Tim Cobbold were appointed to the Board after the last AGM and, therefore, 
both will retire and offer themselves for election by shareholders at the AGM to be held on 13 April 2011. 
The UK Corporate Governance Code provides for the annual re-election of all directors and whilst the relevant provision of the Code 
is intended to apply to financial years commencing on or after 29 June 2010, the Board has determined that it will adopt this 
provision with immediate effect and therefore each of Tim Barker, Charles Berry, Peter Emery, David Lindsell, Tony Quinlan and 
Dorothy Thompson will retire at the forthcoming AGM and, being eligible, offer themselves for re-election. The evaluation of the 
Board described on page 50 concluded that the directors offering themselves for re-election continue to demonstrate commitment 
to their particular role and perform effectively. The re-election of each director is recommended by the Board. Details of the 
relevant terms of appointment and service agreements appear on page 69. 
Mike Grasby has stated that he intends to step down from the Board having joined Drax in December 2003 and therefore will not be 
seeking re-election. He will retire as a director at the conclusion of the AGM on 13 April 2011. 
The rules relating to the appointment or replacement of directors and the powers of directors are highlighted in the Corporate 
governance report on page 49. 
A director is not required to hold any shares of the Company by way of qualification. Directors’ interests in the share capital of the 
Company are shown on page 72.  
Directors’ interests, indemnity arrangements and other significant agreements 
Other than a deed of indemnity between each director, the Company and each of its subsidiaries in respect of claims made and 
personal liability incurred as a result of the bona fide discharge of the directors’ responsibilities and a service contract between the 
executive directors and a Group company, or as noted in the Remuneration Committee report, no director had a material interest 
at any time during the year in any contract of significance with the Company or any of its subsidiary undertakings. 
Details of directors’ remuneration, service contracts and interests in the shares of the Company are set out in the Remuneration 
Committee report on pages 59 to 72. 
There are no agreements between the Group and its directors or employees providing for compensation for loss of office or 
employment that occurs because of a takeover bid. 
Under a £200 million letter of credit facility agreement dated 27 October 2005, as amended on 6 December 2005 and further 
amended and restated on 3 August 2009, and amended on 5 May 2010, between, amongst others, Drax Power Limited and Barclays 
Bank PLC (as facility agent), on a change of control, if any lender requires, it may, by giving notice to Drax Power Limited and the 
facility agent within 30 days of receiving notice from Drax Power Limited that a change of control has occurred, cancel its 
commitments and require the payment of its share of any outstanding amounts within three business days of such cancellation 
notice being given.  
Under a £235 million forward start credit facility dated 3 August 2009, as amended on 18 January 2011 between, amongst others, 
Drax Finance Limited, Drax Power Limited and Barclays Bank PLC (as facility agent), on a change of control, if any lender so 
requires, it may by giving notice to Drax Finance Limited and the facility agent within 30 days of receiving notice from Drax Finance 
Limited that a change of control has occurred, cancel its commitments and require the payment of its share of any outstanding 
amounts within three business days of such cancellation notice being given. 
Under a trading agreement dated 5 May 2010, between, amongst others, Drax Power Limited and Barclays Bank PLC, Drax Power 
Limited may have uncollateralised trading positions up to a threshold of £135 million. On a change of control, Barclays Bank PLC, 
may by giving notice to Drax Power Limited within 30 days of receiving notice from Drax Power Limited that a change of control has 
occurred, withdraw the uncollateralised trading line and require all trading positions to be collateralised. 
Under the terms of the three credit facility agreements, a “change of control” occurs if any person or group of persons acting in 
concert gains control of Drax Group plc.  
There are no other significant agreements to which the Group is a party that take effect, alter or terminate upon a change of control 
of the Group following a takeover bid providing that the Group’s credit rating is maintained.

Employees 
A commentary on employee involvement and the Group’s commitment to its employees is set out within the Corporate and social 
responsibility review on pages 30 to 39 and details of employee involvement through share participation are contained in the 
Remuneration Committee report on pages 59 to 72. Shares awarded under the Group’s Share Incentive Plan are registered in the 
name of the Trustee. Voting rights attached to those shares are at the direction of individual employee participants. 
Drax uses a wide variety of communication methods in order to create a common awareness on the part of all employees of the 
financial and economic factors affecting the performance of the Group. For example, team briefings are held once a month where 
wide-ranging information is communicated throughout the organisation. In addition, Open Forums are held three times a year and 
cover, inter alia, the financial and market factors affecting the performance of the Group. Details of the communication methods 
used are provided in the “Employees” section of the report on Corporate and social responsibility on pages 36 to 37.  
It is the Group’s policy to give full and fair consideration to suitable applications for employment from people with disabilities having 
regards to their particular aptitudes and abilities. In the event of a member of staff becoming disabled every effort is made to 
ensure that their employment with the Group continues and that appropriate training and rehabilitation is provided. It is the policy 
of the Group that the training, career development and promotion of disabled persons should, as far as possible, be identical with 
that of other employees. 
The Group is committed to a policy of equal opportunities and ensures that country of origin, colour, gender, religious belief, 
sexual orientation, age or disability, are not barriers to working at Drax. 
The Group provides a wide range of development opportunities to help employees develop the necessary skills, knowledge and 
experience to realise their performance potential. 
Corporate and social responsibility 
Details of the Group’s Corporate and social responsibility policies and operations are set out on pages 30 to 39.  
There are Group policies in place for environment, health and safety and human resources as well as a Code of Business Ethics. 
This includes processes designed to comply with the Bribery Act 2010 when it comes into force. 
The internal control processes described on page 52, take account of social, environmental and ethical risks. 
Charitable donations 
The Group has continued to support community initiatives and charitable causes. The total charitable donations made by the Group 
in the year were £87,384 (2009: £88,041). More information on the charitable donations made is contained within the Corporate 
and social responsibility review on pages 30 to 39. 
Political donations 
No political donations were made in the UK or elsewhere during the year (2009: £nil). It is the Board’s policy not to make donations 
to political organisations or for political causes. 
The Group’s activities in the political sphere are aimed only at the promotion of its business interests. However, the definitions of EU 
political expenditure are broad and there is widespread doubt about the extent to which normal business activities, which might not 
be thought to be political expenditure in the usual sense, could be considered to be political expenditure within the meaning of the 
legislation. The Board wishes to avoid any inadvertent infringement of the legislation and is, therefore, seeking the authority of 
shareholders to incur expenditure for the Company and its subsidiaries for such purposes of £100,000 during the next 12 months. 
A resolution to that effect is contained within the Notice of the Annual General Meeting. The Board does not believe that the Group 
has incurred any political expenditure in the past year. 
Creditor payment policy and practice 
Terms of payment are agreed with suppliers when negotiating each transaction and the policy is to abide by those terms and pay 
creditors when sums owing fall due for payment, provided that the suppliers also comply with all relevant terms and conditions. 
Drax Group plc, the holding company of the Group, has no trade creditors. In respect of Group activities, the amounts due to trade 
creditors at 31 December 2010 represented approximately 21 days of average daily purchases through the year (2009: 23 days). 
The figure is essentially based upon the ratio of amounts owed to trade creditors against the amounts Drax was invoiced by 
suppliers during the financial year.

Auditors and the disclosure of information to the auditors 
So far as each person who is a director at the date of approving this report is aware, there is no relevant audit information, being 
information needed by the auditors in connection with preparing the report, of which the auditors are unaware. Having made 
enquiries of fellow directors, each director has taken all the steps that he/she is obliged to take as a director in order to make 
himself/herself aware of any relevant audit information and to establish that the auditors are aware of that information. 
This information is given and should be interpreted in accordance with the provisions of Section 418 of the Companies Act. 
In accordance with Section 489 of the Companies Act, a resolution is to be proposed at the AGM for the reappointment of 
Deloitte LLP as auditors of the Company. A resolution will also be proposed authorising the directors to determine the auditors’ 
remuneration. The Audit Committee reviews the appointment of the auditors, the auditors’ effectiveness and relationship with 
the Group, including the level of audit and non-audit fees paid to the auditors. Further details on the work of the auditors and 
the Audit Committee are set out in the Audit Committee report on pages 55 to 57. 
Voting 
Subject to the Articles generally and to any special rights or restrictions as to voting attached by or in accordance with the Articles 
to any class of shares, on a show of hands every member who is present in person at a General Meeting shall have one vote and, on 
a poll, every member who is present in person or by proxy shall have one vote for every share of which he/she is the holder. It has 
been the Company’s practice since incorporation to hold a poll on every resolution at Annual General Meetings and Extraordinary 
General Meetings. 
Where shares are held by trustees/nominees in respect of the Group’s employee share plans and the voting rights attached to such 
shares are not directly exercisable by the employees, it is the Company’s practice that such rights are not exercised by the relevant 
trustee/nominee.  
Under the Companies Act, members are entitled to appoint a proxy, who need not be a member of the Company, to exercise all or 
any of their rights to attend and to speak and vote on their behalf at a General Meeting or class meeting. A member may appoint 
more than one proxy in relation to a General Meeting or class meeting provided that each proxy is appointed to exercise the rights 
attached to a different share or shares held by that member. A member that is a corporation may appoint one or more individuals 
to act on its behalf at a General Meeting or class meetings as a corporate representative.  
Deadlines for exercising voting rights 
Votes are exercisable at a General Meeting of the Company in respect of which the business being voted upon is being heard. Votes 
may be exercised in person, by proxy, or in relation to corporate members, by corporate representative. The Articles provide a 
deadline for submission of proxy forms of not than less than 48 hours before the time appointed for the holding of the meeting or 
adjourned meeting. 
Restrictions on voting 
No member shall, unless the directors otherwise determine, be entitled in respect of any share held by him/her to vote either 
personally or by proxy at a shareholders’ meeting or to exercise any other right conferred by membership in relation to 
shareholders’ meetings if any call or other sum presently payable by him/her to the Company in respect of that share remains 
unpaid. In addition, no member shall be entitled to vote if he/she has been served with a notice after failing to provide the Company 
with information concerning interests in those shares required to be provided under the Companies Act. 
 
By order of the Board.

Compliance with the Combined Code 
It is the Board’s view that throughout the period commencing on 1 January 2010, there has been full compliance with the provisions 
of Section 1 of the Combined Code 2008. The Combined Code is available at: www.frc.org.uk/corporate/ukcgcode.cfm 
This section describes in broad terms how the Company is organised 
in terms of the overall structure and principal roles and responsibilities 
of the Board, its committees and other signiﬁcant bodies.

The Board of directors 
As at 21 February 2011, the Board consisted of the non-executive Chairman, ﬁve 
independent non-executive directors and three executive directors. The directors 
are named in the Directors’ report on page 45 and their principal commitments 
outside the Group are described within their biographical notes on pages 40 and 41. 
The Board meets at least six times each year and more frequently if appropriate. 
In addition, the Board meets at least annually to consider Group strategy.
Executive directors
Chairman
Non-executive directors
 
Charles Berry is the Chairman, having been appointed on 17 April 2008, and having served as an independent non-executive director 
of the Company since December 2005. He had no material business or other relationship with the Company, and there were no 
other matters that were likely to affect his independence of character and judgement. The Board therefore considered that 
Charles Berry was independent on appointment as Chairman. Charles Berry is also Chairman of Eaga plc (“Eaga”). On 7 January 
2010, the Group announced that it had entered into a contract with Eaga to outsource the provision of services in fulfilment of 
the Group’s carbon emissions reduction obligation under the Community Energy Saving Programme, which came into effect on 
1 September 2009 and runs until 31 December 2012. Further detail is contained on page 105 under Related party transactions. 
Dorothy Thompson is the Chief Executive and is responsible for all aspects of the stewardship of the Group and its business, 
including developing an appropriate business strategy for Board approval and securing its timely and effective implementation. 
She provides leadership to the executive team and takes responsibility for the important external relationships with customers, 
suppliers, regulatory agencies and Government bodies. The division of responsibilities between the Chairman and the Chief 
Executive is set out in writing, was agreed by the Board on 14 December 2005 and was reviewed and varied by the Board on 
23 October 2006. 
Tony Quinlan is the Finance Director. He is responsible for the financial management of the Group, and for relationships with 
the Group’s bankers.  
Peter Emery is the Production Director and is responsible for the operation, safety, repair and maintenance of the electricity 
generation plant at the power station and for the Drax site.

Tim Barker is the Senior Independent Director. 
Tim Barker, Mike Grasby and David Lindsell have served the Group as independent non-executive directors throughout the year 
ended 31 December 2010. Tim Cobbold, Jamie Dundas and Tony Thorne, served the Group as independent non-executive directors 
for only part of the year ended 31 December 2010. 
Jamie Dundas retired as a director on 21 April 2010. Tony Thorne and Tim Cobbold were appointed as directors by the Board in 
accordance with Article 79 of the Articles of Association on 29 June 2010 and 27 September 2010 respectively.  
The Board has reviewed the independence of each non-executive director. Mike Grasby was the manager of Drax Power Station 
between 1991 and 1995, whilst the power station was owned by National Power plc. He has never been an employee of the Company 
or the Group. The Board considered that at the time he was appointed as a non-executive director, sufficient time had elapsed 
from his previous association with Drax Power Station such that it did not affect his independence of character and judgement. 
Mike is to retire as a director at the conclusion of the Annual General Meeting (“AGM”) on 13 April 2011. 
None of the non-executive directors who have served during the year had any material business or other relationship with the 
Group, and there were no other matters that were likely to affect their independence of character and judgement. The Board 
therefore considers all of the non-executive directors to be independent. 
The Articles provide that one-third of directors, not including directors appointed by the Board, (rounded down to the nearest whole 
number) shall retire by rotation each year but are eligible to submit themselves for re-election by shareholders and that directors 
shall not serve longer than the third AGM following their election without being re-elected by shareholders. During the year, the 
Nominations Committee considered the requirements for directors to retire by rotation, together with the provisions of the 
Combined Code to ensure planned and progressive refreshing of the Board.  
The Nominations Committee met on 15 February 2011, following the completion of the Board evaluation process. The Nominations 
Committee also noted that the UK Corporate Governance Code provides for the annual re-election of all directors and whilst the 
provision of that Code is intended to apply in respect of financial years commencing on or after 29 June 2010, the Nominations 
Committee and the Board have determined that it will adopt this provision with immediate effect. Accordingly each of Tim Barker, 
Charles Berry, Peter Emery, David Lindsell, Tony Quinlan and Dorothy Thompson will retire at the forthcoming AGM and, being 
eligible, offer themselves for re-election. Tony Thorne and Tim Cobbold will each retire at the forthcoming AGM and offer 
themselves for election. The evaluation of the Board described on page 50 concluded that the directors offering themselves 
for election or re-election (in line with the provisions contained in the Articles) continue to demonstrate commitment, management 
and industry expertise to their particular role and perform effectively. 
The election and re-election of each director is recommended by the Board. Details of the relevant terms of appointment and 
service agreements appear on page 69. 
Mike Grasby has stated that he intends to step down from the Board having joined Drax in December 2003 and therefore will not 
be seeking re-election. He will retire as a director at the conclusion of the AGM on 13 April 2011. 
Details of the service contracts for the executive directors and letters of appointment for the non-executive directors are set out 
in a table on page 69.  
It is the Board’s policy that each non-executive director will be appointed for a term of three years which, subject to the Board being 
satisfied as to the director’s performance and commitment and a resolution to re-elect at the appropriate AGM, may be renewed by 
mutual agreement. However, in the case of the independent non-executive directors, it is the Board’s policy not to extend the 
aggregate period of service of any independent non-executive director beyond nine years and, as required by the Combined Code, 
any proposal made to extend a non-executive director’s aggregate period of office beyond six years is the subject of a rigorous 
review. Such reviews in cases where a director remains in office after six years, will be conducted annually, as part of the evaluation 
of the Board.

CORPORATE GOVERNANCE 
50 
The Board has adopted a schedule of matters reserved for its decision and formal terms of reference for its committees which are 
available to view on the Group’s website at www.draxgroup.plc.uk. The Board determines: the Group’s strategy; the Group’s appetite 
for risk; the internal control and risk management policies; the business plan and principal performance indicators; acquisitions and 
disposals and other transactions outside delegated limits; material changes to accounting policies or practices; significant financial 
decisions; capital structure and dividend policy; shareholder communications; prosecution, defence or settlement of material 
litigation; Group remuneration policy; the terms of reference and membership of Board Committees; and the Board structure, 
composition and succession. Matters which are not specifically reserved to the Board and its committees under their terms of 
reference, or to shareholders in General Meeting, are delegated to the Chief Executive or otherwise delegated in accordance with 
a scheme of delegation approved by the Board. 
The Board receives regular reports on performance against the Business Plan and periodic business reports from senior 
management. Directors are briefed on matters to be discussed at meetings by papers distributed in advance of Board and 
committee meetings. 
The Board is satisfied that all the directors are able to devote sufficient time to their duties as directors. 
The Board has adopted a policy whereby directors may, in the furtherance of their duties, seek independent professional advice 
at the Company’s expense. During 2010 no director sought independent legal advice pursuant to the policy. 
The Articles give the directors power to approve conflicts of interest. The Board has adopted a procedure by which situations giving 
rise to potential conflicts of interest are identified to the Board, considered for authorisation and recorded. Under the Articles 
certain conflicts of interest do not need to be authorised, for example an interest as a director of a group company. Generally the 
nature and extent of any conflict of interest must be disclosed before it can be authorised or before it is permitted without being 
authorised but the Articles provide for some situations in which disclosure is not required where knowledge can be presumed and 
disclosure is unlikely to be necessary. The Articles also allow the Board to exercise voting rights in group companies without 
restriction (e.g. so as to appoint a director to the board of a group company without this counting as a conflict requiring 
authorisation). 
Each director has the benefit of a deed of indemnity from the Company and its subsidiaries in respect of claims made and liabilities 
incurred, in either case arising out of the bona fide discharge by the director of his or her duties. The Company has also arranged 
appropriate insurance cover in respect of legal action against directors of the Company and its subsidiaries. 
Performance reviews and directors’ development 
The effectiveness of the Board is vital to the success of the Group. During the year, the Company undertook a review to evaluate 
the performance of the Board, its committees and individual directors. This was performed by Independent Audit Limited 
(“Independent Audit”), an independent strategic governance consultancy that has no other connection with the Company. 
Independent Audit conducted individual interviews with each director, the Company Secretary and members of the senior 
management group. A written report was presented to the Board, and Independent Audit attended a Board meeting to present 
and discuss the conclusions of the report. In addition, Independent Audit met separately with the Chairman to discuss the findings 
of the review generally, and with the Senior Independent Director to discuss the performance of the Chairman. 
The main conclusions of Independent Audit’s review were that the Board was strong and appears well equipped to meet the 
challenges ahead. In particular, the composition and mix of the Board were appropriate with a strong cadre of non-executive 
directors with a broad range of relevant experience. In addition, the Board benefits from a management team that is receptive 
to and recognises the value of challenge. The report made a number of recommendations which would enhance Board 
effectiveness, all of which the Board is taking account as part of the process of continuing improvement. The Board intends 
to improve the process for reviewing past decisions and lessons learnt and maintain regular visits by the non-executive directors 
to the different Group locations. 
During the year, the Chairman held meetings with the non-executive directors in the absence of the executive directors, and the 
Senior Independent Director held meetings with the non-executive directors without the Chairman being present, as required by 
provision A.1.3 of the Combined Code. 
The Board is committed to the development of all employees and directors and has reviewed and will periodically again review 
each individual director’s development requirements and make appropriate arrangements to address them. All new directors 
receive an induction, including being provided with information about the Group and their responsibilities, meetings with key 
managers and visits to the Group’s sites. In addition, each non-executive director visits operational sites and meets with senior 
management to be briefed on the Group’s business at least annually, and specific Board training days are arranged involving 
presentations on relevant topics.

(2) Tim Cobbold and Tony Thorne joined each of the Audit, Nominations and Remuneration Committees on the same date that they were appointed to the Board, namely 
27 September 2010 and 29 June 2010 respectively. 
Details of the work of the Audit, Nominations and Remuneration Committees are given in the reports of those Committees on pages 
55 to 72. The terms of reference for these Committees are reviewed annually by each Committee and then by the Board. The terms 
of reference of each Committee are available on the Group’s website at www.draxgroup.plc.uk. 
The Board attaches particular importance to its scrutiny of health and safety performance, systems and procedures. The section 
headed Internal control on page 52 makes reference to steps taken by the Board to strengthen the Group’s system of internal 
control during the year. One such step is an increase in the level of independent scrutiny of health and safety controls. Prior to the 
adoption of the Risk Management Policy, this was carried out by the Health and Safety Committee which included one non-executive 
director and two executive directors. Following the adoption of the Risk Management Policy, the Health and Safety Committee has 
been discontinued and the Safety, Health, Environmental and Production Integrity Committee (“SHEPIC”) has been established 
with responsibility to assist the Production Director in the operation and implementation of risk management and internal control 
processes. Its activities are reviewed by the Audit Committee, which provides assurance to the Board on the effectiveness of the 
health and safety controls. In addition, the SHEPIC reports directly to the Board at least annually.  
There is also an Executive Committee through which the Chief Executive discharges her duties in respect of the day-to-day 
management of the Group. The Executive Committee membership currently comprises: Dorothy Thompson (Chief Executive), 
Sean Ebnet (Director of New Business), Peter Emery (Production Director), Philip Hudson (Director of Corporate Affairs and 
Company Secretary), Tony Quinlan (Finance Director) and Paul Taylor (Director of Trading). The Deputy Company Secretary acts 
as Secretary to the Executive Committee.

Internal control 
The Board is responsible for the Group’s system of internal control and for reviewing its effectiveness. A process has been 
established for identifying, evaluating and managing the significant risks faced by the Group and this has been in place for the year 
under review up to the date of approval of the Annual report and accounts 2010. The process is designed to manage rather than 
eliminate the risk of failure to achieve business objectives and can only provide reasonable, not absolute, assurance against material 
misstatement or loss. 
During the year, the Board strengthened the Group’s system of internal control through the adoption of a new Risk Management 
Policy which is the principal document governing the objectives and requirements of the Group’s internal control and risk 
management processes. The policy stipulates the structure by which identification and analysis of risks and clear designation of 
accountability, together with effective risk management processes, ensure that risk management is embedded within the Group. 
Risk Management Committees assist the business directors in the operation and implementation of the risk management process 
in all areas of the Group’s business, and provide a source of assurance to the Audit Committee that the process is operating 
effectively.  
There are now five Risk Management Committees, which are as follows: the Corporate Risk Management Committee; the Haven Risk 
Management Committee; the New Business Risk Management Committee; the Safety, Health, Environmental and Production 
Integrity Committee; and the Treasury and Commodity Risk Management Committee. The Board has also adopted the practice of 
receiving annual reports from each Risk Management Committee, and receives monthly reports on particular risk areas including 
health and safety and commodity trading.  
The Group’s risk management process aims to be comprehensive, systematic and continuous. Its key features include the 
identification and recording of the main risks facing the Group in a risk register with clear allocation of management responsibility 
for risk identification, analysis and control. The risk register is used by management and by the Risk Management Committees to 
ensure that risks are identified, analysed and managed systematically and appropriately. It lists all of the significant risks faced by 
the Group, records the level of severity and probability, ownership and mitigation measures for each risk. In addition, the Group has 
comprehensive and well defined control policies with clear structures, delegated authority levels and accountabilities. During the 
year, the Executive Committee reviewed the risk management process and the controls applicable to the most significant risks 
facing the Group. 
The Group has a system of planning and monitoring, which incorporates Board approval of a rolling five year Business Plan and 
approval, towards the end of each year, of operating and capital expenditure budgets for the year ahead. Performance against the 
budget is subsequently monitored and reported to the Board on a monthly basis. The Board also receives monthly reports on 
trading risk exposure as compared to the pre-set limits and monitors overall Group performance against a Balanced Corporate 
Scorecard (”BCS”) which shows progress against a set of financial, operating, safety and other targets set at the start of the year. 
Performance is reported formally to shareholders through the publication of Group results. Operational management make 
frequent reports on performance to the executive directors. 
The Group also has processes in place for business continuity and emergency planning. 
Through the Audit Committee the Board has implemented a programme of internal audit reviews of different aspects of the Group’s 
activities. The programme, which is reviewed and updated annually, is designed so that, over time, all facets of the business are 
reviewed to ensure appropriate systems of control are in place and are working effectively or, where they are not, deficiencies are 
rectified by timely and appropriate action. In agreeing the actions to be taken in response to each report, the aim is always to embed 
internal controls, including measures intended effectively to identify and manage risk, within each area of the Group’s operations. In 
parallel with its work in relation to internal audit, the Audit Committee also satisfies itself that an action plan for dealing with points 
raised by the external auditors in their yearly management letters is being properly addressed by management. 
With the assistance of the Audit Committee, the Board has reviewed the effectiveness of the system of internal control. It has 
reviewed the reports of the Audit Committee, which has considered all significant aspects of internal control including financial, 
operational, trading, compliance, social, environmental and ethical risks in accordance with the “Internal Control: Guidance for 
Directors on the Combined Code” issued in September 1999 and updated in October 2005.  
Following its review the Board determined that it was not aware of any significant deficiency or material weakness in the system of 
internal control.

Relations with shareholders 
The Board places considerable importance on communication with shareholders and is proactive in obtaining an understanding 
of shareholder preferences and evaluating systematically the economic, social, environmental and ethical matters that may 
influence or affect the interests of shareholders. A number of formal communication channels are used to account to shareholders 
for the performance of the Group, which include the Annual report and accounts, AGMs and periodic reports to the London 
Stock Exchange. Presentations given at appropriate intervals to representatives of the investor community are available to all 
shareholders to download from the Group’s website (www,draxgroup.plc.uk). Less formal processes include contacts with 
institutional shareholders by the Chairman and other directors. 
The Chairman is keen to ensure that he maintains an open relationship with the Group’s major shareholders and communicates 
directly with them, offering the opportunity to meet in order that he can understand their views on the Group, be it corporate 
governance issues or any other points they might wish to raise.  
The Board also reviews and discusses the investor feedback from post-results investor meetings conducted by the Chief Executive 
and the Finance Director in the UK, Europe and the USA. These took place following both the preliminary and half year results 
announcements in 2010. The Group has also engaged Makinson Cowell Limited, an independent capital markets consultancy firm, 
to advise and assist in relation to communications with shareholders. 
The Company’s private registered shareholders hold, in aggregate, approximately 1% of the issued share capital. The Board is 
as interested in their concerns as it is in the concerns of institutional and corporate shareholders. All shareholders are free to 
put questions to the Board at the AGM. Questions asked in person at the AGM will receive an oral response whenever possible. 
Otherwise a written response will be provided as soon as practicable after the AGM. Questions asked at other times will normally 
receive a written response. Shareholders attending the AGM will have an opportunity to meet informally with the directors 
immediately after the meeting. 
All information reported to the market via a regulatory information service also appears as soon as practicable on the 
Group’s website.

Statement of directors’ responsibilities 
The directors are responsible for preparing the Annual report and accounts, Remuneration Committee report and the consolidated 
financial statements in accordance with applicable law and regulations. 
Company law requires the directors to prepare financial statements for each financial year. The directors are required by the IAS 
Regulation to prepare the consolidated financial statements under International Financial Reporting Standards (“IFRSs”) as adopted 
by the European Union. The consolidated financial statements are also required by law to be properly prepared in accordance with 
the Companies Act and Article 4 of the IAS Regulation.  
International Accounting Standard 1 requires that IFRS financial statements present fairly for each financial year the Group’s 
financial position, financial performance and cash flows. This requires the faithful representation of the effects of transactions, other 
events and conditions in accordance with the definitions and recognition criteria for assets, liabilities, income and expenses set out 
in the International Accounting Standards Board’s “Framework for the preparation and presentation of financial statements”. 
In virtually all circumstances, a fair presentation will be achieved by compliance with all applicable IFRSs. However, directors are 
also required to: 
− properly select and apply accounting policies; 
− present information, including accounting policies, in a manner that provides relevant, reliable, comparable and understandable 
information;  
− provide additional disclosures when compliance with the specific requirements in IFRSs are insufficient to enable users  
to understand the impact of particular transactions, other events and conditions on the entity’s financial position and financial 
performance; and 
− make an assessment of the Group’s ability to continue as a going concern. 
The directors have elected to prepare the parent Company financial statements in accordance with United Kingdom Generally 
Accepted Accounting Practice (United Kingdom Accounting Standards and applicable law). The parent Company financial 
statements are required by law to give a true and fair view of the state of affairs of the Company. In preparing these financial 
statements, the directors are required to: 
− select suitable accounting policies and then apply them consistently; 
− make judgements and estimates that are reasonable and prudent; 
− state whether applicable UK Accounting Standards have been followed, subject to any material departures disclosed and 
explained in the financial statements; and 
− prepare the financial statements on the going concern basis unless it is inappropriate to presume that the Company will continue 
in business. 
The directors are responsible for keeping proper accounting records that disclose with reasonable accuracy at any time the financial 
position of the Company and enable them to ensure that the parent Company financial statements comply with the Companies Act. 
They are also responsible for safeguarding the assets of the Company and hence for taking reasonable steps for the prevention and 
detection of fraud and other irregularities. 
The directors are responsible for the maintenance and integrity of the corporate and financial information included on the Group’s 
website. Regular review meetings are held with the website administrators to ensure that the website is continually maintained to a 
high standard.  
Legislation in the United Kingdom governing the preparation and dissemination of financial statements may differ from legislation 
in other jurisdictions. 
We confirm that to the best of our knowledge: 
1. 
the financial statements, prepared in accordance with the relevant financial reporting framework, give a true and fair view of the 
assets, liabilities, financial position and profit or loss of the Company and the undertakings included in the consolidation taken 
as a whole; and 
2. the Business review, which is incorporated into the Directors’ report, includes a fair review of the development and performance 
of the business and the position of the Company and the undertakings included in the consolidation taken as a whole, together 
with a description of the principal risks and uncertainties that they face. 
By order of the Board.

AUDIT COMMITTEE REPORT 
55
“ The steps Drax has taken in 2010 in revising and reﬁning its 
risk and governance framework should provide stakeholders 
with greater comfort that it is a well run business.”
Chairman of the Audit Committee
David Lindsell
 
Membership and process 
The Audit Committee (the “Committee”) consisted of David Lindsell (as Chairman), Tim Barker (Senior Independent Director), Tim 
Cobbold (from 27 September 2010), Jamie Dundas (until 21 April 2010) and Tony Thorne (from 29 June 2010) all of whom are 
independent non-executive directors.  
Whilst the Committee consisted of two independent non-executive directors in the period from 22 April 2010 to 28 June 2010, all 
four meetings of the Committee held during the year were properly constituted with at least three independent non-executive 
directors in attendance. 
The Board is satisfied that the membership of the Committee meets the requirement for recent and relevant financial experience. 
The Company Secretary acts as Secretary to the Committee.  
The Committee met on four occasions in 2010, and the members’ attendance record is set out on page 51. The Chairman  
of the Committee reports the Committee’s deliberations to the following Board meeting and the minutes of each meeting of  
the Committee are circulated to all members of the Board. 
Role 
The Committee assists the Board to fulfil its oversight responsibilities. Its primary functions are to: 
− monitor the integrity of the financial statements and other information provided to shareholders; 
− review significant financial reporting issues and judgements contained in the financial statements; 
− review the systems of internal control and risk management; 
− maintain an appropriate relationship with the Group’s external auditors and review the effectiveness and objectivity of 
the external audit process; and 
− monitor and review the effectiveness of the internal audit function (which is provided by Grant Thornton UK LLP), review the 
internal audit plan, all internal audit reports and review and monitor management’s responses to the findings and 
recommendations of the internal audit function. 
The terms of reference for the Committee are reviewed annually by the Committee and then by the Board. The terms of reference 
are available on the Group’s website at www.draxgroup.plc.uk. 
Attendance at meetings 
The Chairman of the Board, the Chief Executive, the Finance Director, the Group Financial Controller and the internal and external 
auditors are normally invited by the Chairman of the Committee to attend meetings of the Committee. In undertaking its duties, 
the Committee has access to the services of the Finance Director and the Company Secretary and their resources, as well as access 
to external professional advice. 
During the year, the Committee undertook its duties in accordance with an agreed annual work plan of which the main features 
were: 
− at meetings in February and July 2010, the Committee reviewed the Group’s Preliminary results announcement and Annual 
report and accounts, and the Half year results announcement and Half year report respectively. On each occasion, the 
Committee received reports from management and the external auditors identifying accounting or judgemental issues requiring 
its attention and also satisfied itself of the independence and objectivity of the external auditors; 
− at each meeting the Committee received reports from the internal audit function on the progress of their programme for the 
year, reviewed new internal audit reports and monitored progress with the implementation of internal control recommendations. 
The Committee reviewed the arrangements for the provision of the internal audit function and the performance of the current 
provider, Grant Thornton UK LLP. The Committee considered that outsourcing the internal audit function through Grant 
Thornton UK LLP continues to be effective and appropriate. In establishing the internal audit plan for 2011, the Committee 
continues to focus on specifically identified strategic risk areas, as well as ensuring the provision of a core compliance 
assurance service;

AUDIT COMMITTEE REPORT 
56 
Attendance at meetings (continued) 
− in April 2010, the Committee undertook a detailed review of the management letter covering the external auditors’ findings in 
respect of the prior financial year and also reviewed the performance of the external auditors;  
− at meetings in April and November 2010, the Committee reviewed the Company’s risk register and in November 2010 it 
undertook a review of the effectiveness of the system of internal controls;  
− in July 2010, the Committee received a specific report that it had commissioned from PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP (“PwC”) on 
the effectiveness of controls applicable to Drax Power Limited’s commodity trading activities. The report concluded that there 
were no significant weaknesses in the controls. PwC are to conduct a further phase of their review during 2011;  
− during the year, the Committee met four times in the absence of management with the external auditors and three times with 
the internal auditors. No matters of concern were drawn to the Committee’s attention at any of these meetings. The Committee’s 
understanding with both the external and internal auditors is that, if they should at any time become aware of any matters 
occasioning them material concern, they will immediately draw it to the Committee’s attention via the Chairman of the 
Committee. Nothing was subject to this procedure in the course of the year; and 
− from October 2010, the revised risk and governance framework came into being and each of the Risk Management Committees 
met. The Committee was presented with the key risks from each management committee in November 2010. 
The nature of the Group’s activities, and the markets in which it operates, are such that from time to time there is a need to consider 
carefully certain complex accounting issues and make subjective judgements. During the year, the Committee reviewed the Group’s 
accounting for unrealised gains and losses under derivative contracts, and the methodology through which the Group determine 
appropriate actuarial assumptions for its defined benefit pension scheme. The Committee also considered the subjective 
judgements which are made in connection with the Group’s tax accounting and the remaining useful economic life of the 
Drax Power Station. 
On each occasion, the Committee concluded that the relevant accounting standards were being properly applied, and that the 
judgements taken were reasonable and appropriate to the circumstances. 
Independence of the external audit 
In July 2008, the Committee considered and adopted an enhanced Auditor Independence Policy. In accordance with the Policy, the 
Committee annually reviews the quality and cost effectiveness of the external audit and the independence and objectivity of the 
external auditor.  
The provisions of the Policy include: 
− seeking confirmation that the auditors are, in their professional judgement, independent of the Group and obtaining from them 
an account of all relationships which may affect the firm’s independence and the objectivity of the audit partner and staff; 
− a policy governing the engagement of the auditors to conduct non-audit work under which: 
− the auditors may not be engaged to provide certain categories of work, including those where they may be required to audit 
their own work or make management decisions, or where the auditors would act in an advocacy role for the Group; 
− there is a clear process of approval for engaging the auditors to conduct other categories of non-audit work, subject to 
financial limits; 
− all engagements of the auditors to conduct non-audit work are reported to the next meeting of the Committee;  
− the balance between the fees paid to the external auditors for audit and non-audit work is monitored by the Committee; and 
− a policy on the employment by the Group of former employees of the external auditors, the essence of which is to require a 
period of two years to elapse between the cessation of an individual’s association with the auditors and appointment to any 
financial reporting oversight role within the Group. 
Details of the amounts paid to the external auditors during the year for audit and other services are set out in note 4 to the 
consolidated financial statements on page 84. 
The external auditors are required to rotate the audit partner responsible for the Group audit every five years and the current audit 
partner, Carl Hughes, has been in place for two years. 
No contractual obligations exist that restrict the Group’s choice of external auditor.

Internal audit 
Under an outsourcing arrangement, Grant Thornton UK LLP undertakes the Group’s internal audit function. Regular reports are 
provided to the Audit Committee regarding the audit programme and reviews undertaken. Recommendations are made to 
management for process improvements as appropriate. Topics dealt with by internal audit reports reviewed by the Committee 
during 2010 included: dedicated biomass project; tax strategy; non-fuel stock; Haven Power key controls; risk management and 
other sources of assurance; and operations and safety sources of assurance. 
External auditors 
Deloitte LLP were appointed auditors of the Group in 2005 and have been reappointed at each subsequent Annual General Meeting. 
They previously acted as auditors to the Drax group of companies prior to the listing of the Company in December 2005. Any 
decision to open the external audit to tender is taken on the recommendation of the Audit Committee based on the results of the 
performance review described below.  
Having reviewed their performance during the year and satisfied itself of their continuing independence and objectivity within 
the context of applicable regulatory requirements and professional standards, the Committee has invited the Board to recommend 
the reappointment of Deloitte LLP as auditors at the forthcoming AGM and a resolution to that effect appears in the Notice of the 
Annual General Meeting. 
The Chairman of the Committee, independent of management, maintains regular and direct contact with both the internal 
and external auditors. 
This report was reviewed and approved by the Board on 21 February 2011.

NOMINATIONS COMMITTEE REPORT 
58 
The Nominations Committee (the “Committee”) consisted of Charles Berry (as Chairman), Tim Barker (Senior Independent 
Director), Tim Cobbold (from 27 September 2010), Jamie Dundas (until 21 April 2010), Mike Grasby, David Lindsell and Tony Thorne 
(from 29 June 2010). The Company Secretary acts as Secretary to the Committee.  
The principal duties of the Committee are to keep under review the structure, size and composition of the Board (including the skills, 
knowledge and experience required by it), to consider succession planning for the directors and other senior managers, to identify 
and nominate candidates to fill vacancies among the directors and to review the time required from non-executive directors. It also 
reviews those directors retiring by rotation in accordance with the Company’s Articles and makes recommendations to the Board 
regarding their re-election. 
The terms of reference for the Committee are reviewed annually by the Committee and then by the Board. The terms of reference 
are available on the Group’s website at www.draxgroup.plc.uk. 
The Committee met on three occasions in 2010, and the members’ attendance record is set out on page 51.  
The Chairman of the Committee reports the Committee’s deliberations to the following Board meeting and, subject to redaction in 
the event that they include personal information, the minutes of each meeting of the Committee are circulated to all members of 
the Board. 
During the year, the Committee considered the succession planning process for the directors and senior managers and concluded 
that it was appropriate for the business. The outcome of the process which it initiated for the review of the performance of the 
Board, its committees and individual directors is reported in the Corporate governance report on page 50. 
During the course of the year, the Committee conducted an external search with the assistance of an executive search consultancy 
for a suitable candidate to replace Jamie Dundas, who retired from the Board and the committees on which he served on 21 April 
2010. Following the recommendation of the Committee, the Board decided to appoint both Tony Thorne and Tim Cobbold on 
29 June 2010 and 27 September 2010 respectively. The Board considered that their skills and experience would benefit the Board 
and complement the existing skill set and meet the objective of the planned progression in refreshing the Board. 
As is noted on page 49, the Committee met on 15 February 2011, following the completion of the Board evaluation process, and 
determined that each of Tim Barker, Charles Berry, Peter Emery, David Lindsell, Tony Quinlan and Dorothy Thompson will retire at 
the forthcoming AGM and, being eligible, offer themselves for re-election. The evaluation of the Board described on page 50 
concluded that the directors offering themselves for re-election continue to demonstrate commitment to their particular role and 
perform effectively. 
The executive directors’ service contracts and non-executive directors’ letters of appointment are available for inspection by prior 
arrangement during normal business hours at the Company’s registered office. They will also be available for inspection at the 
venue, prior to the Annual General Meeting, details of which are contained in the Notice of Meeting. 
This report was reviewed and approved by the Board on 21 February 2011.

REMUNERATION COMMITTEE REPORT 
59
“ The Committee has sought to ensure that the variable elements of 
management remuneration achieve an appropriate balance between 
short-term ﬁnancial and operational performance, progress towards the Group’s 
strategic objectives and alignment with the returns to shareholders.”
Chairman of the Remuneration Committee
Tim Barker
he Group’s 
 
Introduction 
The spreads between power price and the cost of generation during 2010 have been at the lowest levels since the electricity 
industry was privatised in 1990. The Remuneration Committee (“the Committee”) is acutely aware that it is these spreads that 
primarily determine the returns to our shareholders in the short term. This is a critical component in the Committee’s determination 
of the remuneration packages of executive directors and senior staff. The Committee also recognises that true alignment with the 
interests of our shareholders requires management to make judgements to ensure that the business is managed effectively through 
challenging market conditions and take action to develop an enduring, sustainable business which is less reliant on the spreads 
available from coal-fired power generation.  
The strong contracted power sales position which was put in place by management in 2009 provided a substantial hedge against 
the low spreads and gave more certainty over our earnings. Operationally, 2010 was an exceptional year with a number of measures 
at best ever performances levels for the power station. The resulting high availability and high output, allowed the Group to benefit 
from the power station’s ability to provide critical support to the electricity system in some unusually cold weather over the winter. 
These factors, combined with strong cost control, resulted in an improved profit position compared to the prior year. 
There has also been progress in the strategic development of the biomass operation and the continuing growth of the retail 
business, Haven Power Limited (“Haven Power”).  
Collectively, these are important steps in positioning the Group for its long-term development, and have been taken against a 
background of significant regulatory uncertainty. 
The Committee has striven to maintain a fair remuneration package. It needs to reflect the current economic context and the 
returns to shareholders, whilst also providing the right rewards and incentives to encourage the management of Drax’s transition 
to become a sustainable, low carbon business. 
The Committee has considered the environmental, social and governance implications of the remuneration arrangements and is 
satisfied that they will not lead to irresponsible behaviours. 
This Remuneration Committee report has been prepared on behalf of the Board by the Committee. The Committee has adopted 
the principles of good governance as set out in the Combined Code 2008 and complies with the Listing Rules of the Financial 
Services Authority, the relevant schedules of the Companies Act and the Directors’ Remuneration Report Regulations, 2002 
(“the Regulations”). 
These Regulations require the Company’s auditors to report on the “Audited information” in the Remuneration Committee report 
and to state that this section has been properly prepared in accordance with the Regulations. For this reason the report is divided 
into unaudited and audited information. 
The Remuneration Committee report is subject to shareholder approval at the Annual General Meeting (“AGM”) on 13 April 2011. 
Part 1 – Unaudited information 
The Committee 
During the year, the Committee consisted of Tim Barker (as Chairman), Tim Cobbold (from 27 September 2010), Mike Grasby, 
David Lindsell and Tony Thorne (from 29 June 2010), all of whom are independent non-executive directors, together with 
Charles Berry, Chairman of the Company. Jamie Dundas was a member of the Committee until he retired from the Board  
on 21 April 2010. The Company Secretary acts as Secretary to the Committee.  
The Chief Executive is invited to attend meetings of the Committee except when her own remuneration is being discussed. 
The Committee met on three occasions during the year and its members’ attendance record is set out on page 51. In addition to 
its formal meetings, the Committee met to review the appointment of its principal remuneration adviser and receive presentations 
from prospective advisers.

Principal responsibilities 
The Committee has formal terms of reference, in accordance with which its principal responsibilities are: 
− recommending to the Board the remuneration strategy and framework for the executive directors and senior managers; 
− determining, within that framework, the individual remuneration arrangements for the executive directors and senior managers; 
− approval of the design of annual and long-term incentive arrangements for executive directors and senior managers, including 
agreeing the annual personal targets and payments under such arrangements; 
− determining and agreeing the general terms and conditions of service and the specific terms for any individual within the 
Committee’s remit, either on recruitment or on termination;  
− determining the policy for, and scope of, executive pension arrangements; and 
− overseeing any major changes in employee benefit structures throughout the Group and reviewing remuneration trends across

Agenda 
Each year the Committee agrees an annual work schedule. The regular scheduled matters considered by the Committee

application of the Committee’s discretionary factor; 
− ratification of the measures and weightings of the 2010 BCS;

personal objectives; 
− agreeing personal objectives for directors and senior managers for 2010; 
− review of base salary and overall remuneration packages for executive directors and senior managers; 
− review of the Chairman’s remuneration; 
− granting of awards under executive and all employee share plans; 
− consideration of vesting of awards under executive share plans (no such awards vested during 2010); and 
− review of fees paid to advisers.

In addition, with the assistance of its advisers PwC, the Committee reviewed long-term incentive arrangements of the Group. 
Further details of the review and of the adjustments to the performance conditions made as a result of the review are included in 
the section of this report headed “Conditional share awards under the Bonus Matching Plan” on page 65. The Committee also 
reviewed the rules of the Annual Bonus Plan, which it considered to remain appropriate. It considered that the opportunity under 
the Annual Bonus Plan is consistent with market practice and the mix of performance measures applied via the BCS and further 
personal objectives provide suitably challenging targets.  
Remuneration policy 
The core principles of the remuneration policy are to: 
− manage salaries and benefits around market levels, taking into account remuneration in relevant comparator groups;  
− link a significant proportion of remuneration to performance; 
− award annual bonuses which are linked to the delivery of the annual Business Plan targets and personal performance; and 
− provide staff with long-term incentives linked to Total Shareholder Returns (“TSR”) and to the delivery of Business Plan targets 
with a particular emphasis on the achievement of strategic objectives. 
When applying this policy to senior managers below director level, the Committee selects salary and benefit benchmarks 
appropriate to individual specialisms. 
The objectives of the remuneration policy are to: 
− motivate executive directors and staff to help ensure that Drax meets challenging performance goals; 
− enable Drax to recruit and retain the expertise needed to manage and develop its business; 
− strengthen teamwork at all levels; and 
− ensure alignment of executive and shareholder interests. 
During the year under review the remuneration package of executive directors and senior managers was made up of: 
Base salary
Annual performance bonus 
(A mix of cash and deferred shares)
Pension
Long-term incentive comprising conditional 
shares under the Bonus Matching Plan (BMP) 
(Performance over three years)
Beneﬁts in Kind (“BiK”) 
(Car allowance, private medical etc)
All employee share plans
Fixed
Variable
 
The table on page 62 shows the mix of remuneration that applied in 2010 for executive directors between variable and fixed, and 
short-term and long-term remuneration.  
During 2010, the Committee appointed PwC as its independent adviser, in place of Kepler Associates who had held that appointment 
for more than five years. Following PwC’s appointment in October 2010, the Committee reviewed the remuneration arrangements 
for its executive directors and senior management. The Committee was particularly concerned to ensure that these provided the 
right incentive and retention elements to ensure alignment with the steps needed to manage the business effectively and to develop 
a sustainable business relying less on coal generation, increasing its generation from biomass and developing its supply business. 
The review concluded that base salary levels (effective from 1 April 2010 as detailed on page 67), benefits and annual bonus 
performance structures were appropriate and aligned with the market. It was considered, however that there was an opportunity 
to improve the long-term incentive arrangements provided through the Bonus Matching Plan (“BMP”), the vesting of awards under 
which was determined wholly by relative TSR, which, because of its close correlation with commodity markets, is a measure over 
which management has limited influence. The Committee considered that it was appropriate to retain a significant element of 
relative TSR in the long-term incentive performance condition in order to align directly with the interests of shareholders, but also to 
include measures relating to the operational and strategic objectives of the Company. The Committee therefore consulted with the 
Company’s largest shareholders on proposals to adjust the performance conditions of the BMP to include additional performance 
measures. Shareholders who were consulted were generally supportive of the proposed adjustments and the Committee took 
account of comments made by shareholders in implementing the proposals. Further details of the BMP are included on page 65. 
The Committee believes that the current remuneration arrangements, including the adjusted performance conditions of the 
long-term incentive, are appropriate and fit for purpose taking account of the particular nature of Drax’s business.

The chart values the annual bonus at target with a 5.0% p.a. forfeiture risk applied to the mandatory deferred bonus. The Bonus 
Matching Plan opportunity is based on “fair value” assuming the annual bonus pays out at target and the fair value of a BMP 
performance share is 4.5% of its face value. 
The following paragraphs provide more detail in relation to each of the components of remuneration for executive directors. 
Base salary 
Executive directors’ base salaries and benefits are reviewed each year with any changes taking effect from 1 April. The review takes 
into account individual performance and market competitiveness.  
In March 2010, Kepler presented a report to the Committee in which executive director salaries were benchmarked against two 
relevant comparator groups. Firstly, an industry sector group of 20 companies comprising companies in the electricity, oil and gas, 
engineering and utilities sectors. Secondly, a comparator group comprising 20 companies of comparable size to Drax in terms of 
market capitalisation, turnover and employee numbers  from a variety of industry sectors. By way of an additional comparator, the 
report reviewed reported remuneration at International Power plc, which was considered to be the company with characteristics 
most similar to that of Drax. The report indicated that the remuneration of the Company’s executive directors was, in all cases, in 
the lower quartile of the comparator group by reference to salary, cash and total remuneration. 
The Committee also took account of the fact that no increase in salary had been awarded to the executive directors in the pay 
review year ending on 31 March 2010, and also of the level of general pay increases within the Company. The pay increase agreed on 
behalf of staff covered by collective bargaining arrangements was 2.7% to be effective on 1 April 2010, with further increases of RPI 
plus 0.3% on 1 January 2011 and 1 January 2012. The collective settlement for 2009 had been 3.5%. It was therefore noted that, on 
an annualised basis, general increase in salaries in the Company had been in excess of 7% over a two year period. The RPI based 
increase for the collective bargaining group as at 1 January 2011 was 4.9%.  
In light of the benchmarking exercise and the other factors considered, the Committee agreed that with effect from 1 April 2010:  
− the Chief Executive’s base salary should be increased from £450,000 to £500,000; 
− the Finance Director’s base salary should be increased from £300,000 to £340,000; and 
− the Production Director’s base salary should be increased from £255,000 to £280,000.

Following the increases, each of the executive directors’ salary, cash and total remuneration remained below median by reference 
to the comparator group. The Committee consider this salary level to be appropriate taking into account all of the factors set out. 
The Committee has determined that executive directors’ salaries shall be increased by 2% with effect from 1 April 2011.  
Pensionable salary is derived from base salary only. 
Annual performance bonus 
The Group operates an annual bonus scheme. Bonuses are based on both Group and individual performance against objectives and 
are designed to reward short-term performance.  
The Committee determines Group performance measures using a BCS for which the Board sets challenging performance targets as 
part of the Business Plan approval process. Each element of the scorecard has a low, target and stretch target measure and is given 
a percentage weighting. No score is attributed if performance is below the low target and maximum score is attributed to stretch 
target performance. In 2010 the scorecard had the following elements and weightings:

Notes: 
(1) Cash flow for the year excluding the impact of short-term investments prior to payment of equity dividends. 
In setting these measures and weightings, the Committee recognises that the short-term financial performance of the Group is 
substantially determined by commodity prices, and especially the dark green spread, over which management has limited control.  
The Committee, nevertheless, believes that the variable elements of pay should be sufficiently linked to financial performance to 
ensure that there is alignment with the interests of shareholders. The Committee considers that the annual bonus measures and 
weightings achieve an appropriate balance between financial performance measures and other key performance measures that are 
more directly in the control of management.  
The Committee assesses corporate performance against each of these measures, and has a discretion to adjust the overall score by 
a factor between 0.75x and 1.25x (i.e. +/–25%) to reflect performance and unexpected developments that are not directly included 
in the scorecard, leading to an overall percentage score.  
Following the process, the Committee assessed the corporate score for 2010 at 150%. A summary of the assessment is set out in 
the following table:

− underlying earnings per share;

The Board determines personal performance objectives for each executive director. The Committee assesses performance against 
these objectives and applies an individual performance multiplier of between zero and 1.5.  
To determine the actual bonus awarded to each executive director, the target bonus is multiplied by the corporate score and by the 
personal score, subject to a cap of two times the target bonus.  
For bonus awards in 2010, the target bonus for the Chief Executive and the other executive directors was 65% and 60% of base 
salary respectively. The maximum bonus was 130% and 120% respectively. 75% of any bonus award is paid in cash and 25% is 
deferred in shares that vest after three years and are forfeited if the executive leaves the Group other than as a “good leaver” 
before the shares vest.  
The target and maximum bonus percentages for 2011 for the Chief Executive and the other executive directors are the same as 
in 2010, and bonus measures and targets have been set using a similar process to that used previously. The corporate scorecard 
weightings are, as for 2010, 30% financial, 20% production and 50% strategic and Business Plan. The weightings are set out 
in the following table:

Conditional share awards under the Bonus Matching Plan 
The Group operates a Bonus Matching Plan (“BMP”) as a long-term performance share plan. Awards under the BMP have been 
made in 2009 and 2010. 
Under the BMP executive directors and other senior executives receive an annual grant of conditional shares to a value of up 
to 1.5 times the amount of the executive’s annual bonus for the prior year. No payment is made for the shares, however vesting 
is subject to service and performance conditions. 
In respect of existing awards, 33% of awards granted to those members of senior management who are not members of the 
Executive Committee will vest on the third anniversary of grant provided that the participant is still employed by the Group. 
Awards granted to members of the Executive Committee and the balance (i.e. 67%) of the awards granted to other members 
of senior management will vest on the third anniversary of grant provided the participant is still employed by the Group and 
subject to achievement of a performance condition determined by the Committee and described below.  
The Committee has approved a condition relating to the Company’s TSR over the three-year period measured from the start of the 
financial year in which an award is granted relative to the TSR over the same period of the companies comprising the FTSE 51–150 
(the Comparator Group).  
The TSR condition provides for vesting as follows: 
Company rank within the comparator group 
Vesting of Matching Awards granted to 
Executive Committee members

other participants
Within upper quartile 
100%

At median

 (subject normally to continuing service up to the third anniversary)
In addition, the Committee must be satisfied that there has also been a demonstrable and sustained improvement in the Company’s 
performance over the period. In determining this, the Committee will take into account all relevant factors but in particular will 
consider improvement in the Company’s financial, production and trading performance. 
Adjustment to performance conditions for 2011 and subsequent awards 
As mentioned above, the Committee, assisted by its independent advisers PwC, conducted a review of its long-term remuneration 
arrangements. This concluded that:  
− the basic construct of the BMP remains appropriate for Drax; 
− the maximum incentive opportunity under the BMP remains competitive and appropriate; 
− relative TSR should remain a significant part of the performance measure for the BMP; and 
− the performance measures on half of the matching shares under the BMP should be aligned more directly to short-term and 
operational performance and to the achievement of long-term strategic objectives. 
The current BCS used to measure performance in respect of the annual bonus arrangements has been developed over a number of 
years and is a key tool for aligning reward to both business performance and strategy. The Committee has therefore concluded that 
the BCS should be adapted so that it can be used for both short-term performance measurement for the assessment of annual 
bonus payments and as a building block in the three year assessment of performance under the BMP. 
Accordingly, the following amendments will be made to the performance measures for awards made under the BMP to executives 
in 2011 (the BMP award): 
− 50% of the BMP award will vest based on TSR relative to the FTSE 51–150 in line with the current performance condition 
(the TSR award); and 
− 50% of the BMP award will vest by reference to the Company’s performance against the average outcome from the BCS 
over the three year performance period (the Scorecard award).  
The TSR performance condition will continue to measure TSR performance relative to companies in the FTSE 51–150 over the three-
year performance period measured from the start of the financial year in which the BMP award is made. It will also continue to be 
leveraged such that 0% of the TSR award will vest if Drax’s TSR ranking against the FTSE 51–150 at the end of the performance 
period is less than Median, 15% of the TSR award (i.e. 7.5% of the total BMP award) will vest upon achieving Median and 100% 
of the TSR award (i.e. 50% of the total BMP award) will vest upon achieving a ranking at least equal to upper quartile. 
The Scorecard award will vest by reference to the average (mean) of the outputs of the BCS for each of the three years reported 
on during the performance period, commencing at the start of the financial year in which the BMP award is made. The averaging 
calculation is capped although the annual result on which the three year calculation will be made will not, for this purpose, 
be so capped. 
Drax Group plc
Annual report and accounts 2010
 
REMUNERATION COMMITTEE REPORT

It is then proposed that the Scorecard award will vest at the end of the three year performance period as follows: 
Average BCS outcome 
% of Scorecard Award vesting 
<1 
0%
1 
15% (7.5% of total BMP award)*
1.5 
100% (50% of total BMP award)*
* Straight-line vesting between 15% and 100% for average result between 1 and 1.5. 
In addition, at the end of the three year performance period the Remuneration Committee will ratify each of the annual results 
going into the average BCS calculation and will have the discretion to adjust the final outcome based on events over the period to 
ensure an outcome that is consistent with the underlying performance progression of the business. In exercising their discretion 
the Committee will pay particular regard to progress against the strategic objectives incorporated in the BCS including sustainable 
development of biomass generation and the development of the Haven Power supply business. 
For awards made to executives who are not members of the Executive Committee, one-third of the award will continue to vest on 
the third anniversary of the award subject to continued service, one-third will vest by reference to TSR relative to the FTSE 51–150 
and one-third will vest by reference to the average BCS output on the basis described above. 
Pension  
Executive directors are entitled to membership of the Group’s defined contribution pension plan. The employer’s contribution for 
executive directors is 20% of base salary. Contributions were and are capped by the different statutory limits applicable before and 
after 6 April 2006, although there is no executive director for whom contributions would mean they exceed either the lifetime or 
annual allowances.  
Alternatively, at their option, executive directors may either have contributions of the same amounts made to their personal 
pension schemes or cash in lieu of pension at the stated rate and subject to normal statutory deductions. Details of pension 
contributions for executive directors and of payments in lieu are included in the Directors’ emoluments table in Part 2 of this report. 
Benefits in kind (car, private medical cover, etc) 
The Company’s policy is to offer a car allowance to executive directors and to certain senior 
managers, according to their role. The annual allowance is currently: 
£17,500 per annum for the Chief Executive; 
£12,000 per annum for other executive directors; and  
Car allowance 
£9,000 per annum for senior managers whose remuneration is determined by the Committee.  
Life assurance 
Life assurance (in a sum assured of four times base salary) is provided for the executive 
directors and senior managers.  
Private medical cover 
The Company’s policy is to offer BUPA private medical cover to all employees within the Group. 
The executive directors and senior managers receive medical cover for them and their 
dependants. 
Relocation expenses and second 
base expenses 
Relocation expenses are paid where appropriate. Second base expenses provide an allowance 
towards the cost of accommodation and travel when a director is required to spend a significant 
amount of time at two Drax locations. 
Executive Share Incentive Plan 
Between 2006 and 2008, the Group operated the Executive Share Incentive Plan (“ESIP“). The ESIP is a long-term performance 
share plan under which executives received conditional awards of shares which vest after a three-year performance period, subject 
to Drax’s relative TSR compared to an index of comparator companies. The ESIP was replaced by the BMP in 2009. Details of 
awards made to the executive directors under the ESIP are set out in Part 2 of this report. 
The 2007 ESIP Award was due to mature on 19 April 2010. Over the three-year performance period, Drax’s TSR was below that of 
the index. As a result, all awards under the 2007 ESIP award have lapsed and no shares have been transferred to participants. It is 
anticipated that the 2008 ESIP Award will lapse on 14 April 2011, if the trend during the relative performance period continues.

Notes: 
(1) Includes Board Committee membership fees paid as separate amounts. 
(2) The annual bonus assumes an “on target” performance yielding a bonus of 65% of base salary for Dorothy Thompson and 60% of base salary for the other executive 
directors, of which 25% is required to be deferred into shares. 
(3) Covers car allowance and second base expenses only. The cost of other benefits such as BUPA and additional life cover is not easily predicted because they  
are subject to price variation (the amount of which depends on personal circumstances at the time) during the year. 
(4) Annual contribution by the Company to the directors’ pension plans or cash in lieu. 
All employee share plans 
The Committee operates a Savings-Related Share Option Plan (“SAYE”) and a Share Incentive Plan (“SIP”), both of which are 
approved by HM Revenue & Customs and must be operated on an all employee basis. The executive directors may participate in 
each plan upon the same terms as other employees. The plans are the main vehicles for aligning staff with TSR. 
SAYE  
The SAYE provides for the grant of options (which, at the Committee’s discretion, may be offered at a discount of up to 20% to the 
market price of a share determined in accordance with the rules of the plan) linked to a savings contract which pays interest at a 
statutory rate. The plan was operated in 2006 and again in 2010, so that (subject to the statutory upper aggregate limit of £250 per 
month on an individual’s savings under all SAYE plans) a participating employee could choose to save for either or both periods of 
three or five years.  
The options in both 2006 and 2010 were granted at the permitted discount of 20% to the prevailing share price (determined in 
accordance with the plan rules) resulting in option prices of 636 pence per share and 310.5 pence per share respectively and may be 
exercised upon successful completion of the three year or five year savings contract to which they are linked. 
The five year contracts under the 2006 Plan are due to mature on 1 July 2011. The closing mid-market price of the Drax Group plc 
shares on 31 December 2010 was 368.3 pence per share, which is materially below the option price of 636 pence per share. 
Details of the SAYE options held by the executive directors are shown in the table in Part 2 of this report. 
The Committee agreed that invitations to the SAYE be made again in 2011, immediately following the preliminary results 
announcement. The 20% discount to the market price is applied and participants will be able to take out SAYE contracts over three 
and five years and contribute in total no more than £250 per month.

SIP  
In any one tax year, the Committee may operate the SIP for the benefit of participants using any combination of the following 
elements: 
− award Free Shares (up to £3,000 in value); 
− allow the purchase of Partnership Shares (up to £1,500 in value subject to an overriding maximum of 10% of salary);  
− allocate free Matching Shares (in a maximum ratio of two Matching Shares for each Partnership Share); and 
− allow the investment in shares of dividends received in respect of SIP shares. 
The table below details how the SIP has been operated between 2006 and 2009: 
 
2006 
2007

2009 
SIP Free Share  
Award(1) 
Participants received 
£2,000 worth of shares. 
Participants received £2,500 worth of shares in 
each year. 
Participants received 
£1,000 worth of shares. 
Partnership Shares 
Participants were allowed to invest up to the maximum permitted of £1,500 (subject to an overriding 
maximum of 10% of salary) in each year. 
Matching Share 
Award(1) 
Partnership shares matched on a one-for-one basis in each year. 
Notes: 
(1) The SIP Trustee was funded by the Group to purchase the required Free and Matching Shares in order to avoid any dilution. 
In accordance with the plan rules, shares taken up by an employee are allocated to a trustee which holds them on behalf of the 
employee. Under normal circumstances, the employee will receive the shares from the trustee without incurring a tax liability once 
the shares have been held in trust for five years. The employee is entitled to receive dividends paid in respect of the shares held 
in trust. 
Details of the shares allocated to executive directors under the SIP are shown in the table in Part 2 of this report. 
The Committee decided not to operate the SIP in 2010 or 2011. 
Provision of shares for share plans — dilution 
All equity-based plans are funded through the issuance of shares, or through the purchase of shares in the marketplace through a 
trust, subject to an overall dilution limit for all employee share plans of no more than 10% of share capital in any ten year period and 
a limit of 5% of share capital in any ten year period for the Company’s discretionary share plans (e.g. BMP). 
The current estimated dilution from subsisting awards, including executive and all employee share awards, is less than 0.5% of the 
shares in issue at the date of this report.  
Share ownership guidelines 
The Company has share ownership guidelines for executives participating in its performance share plans. They are 100% and 50% 
of base salary for executive directors and other senior manager ESIP/BMP participants, respectively. 
Those who receive shares by virtue of share plan awards or who receive deferred bonus shares must retain 50% of the net (that is, 
after income tax and national insurance contributions) shares received until the applicable guideline is reached.  
No shares have vested since the introduction of the relevant performance share plan.

Service contracts 
Executive directors’ service agreements are of indefinite duration, terminable at any time by either party giving 12 months’ prior 
notice except that Peter Emery’s contract is terminable by him providing six months’ notice to the Company. 
Under each of the executive directors’ service agreements other than the Chief Executive’s, Drax has the right to make a payment in 
lieu of notice of termination, the amount of that payment being the salary and benefits that would have accrued to the executive 
director during the contractual notice period. 
The following table shows for each person who has served as a director of the Company at any time during the year ended 
31 December 2010, the commencement date and term of the service agreement or contract for services, and details of the notice 
periods. No service agreement now includes any operative provision for the payment of compensation upon early termination. 
Any compensation payable in those circumstances would need to be negotiated at the time and in the light of the circumstances.

Directors’ service agreements and contracts for services are available for inspection at the Company’s registered office during 
normal hours of business and will be available at the place of the AGM from 10.30am until the close of the meeting. 
External appointments 
The Committee recognises that executive directors may be invited to become non-executive directors of other companies and that 
such appointments can broaden their knowledge and experience to the benefit of the Group. The policy is that an executive director 
who accepts an external appointment having had the prior approval of the Board should retain the fees payable in respect of the 
appointment. Dorothy Thompson was appointed as a non-executive director of Johnson Matthey plc with effect from 1 September 
2007, and received £48,750 in fees for that appointment during 2010. 
Non-executive directors 
The Chairman and non-executive directors receive fees in respect of their services. They do not receive any pension or benefits in 
kind. Nor are they eligible for any annual performance bonus or any of the share-based reward plans. The Chairman’s notice period 
is six months whilst the other non-executive directors have a notice period of one month.  
The remuneration of the Chairman is determined by the Committee whilst that of the other non-executive directors is determined 
by the Chairman and the executive directors. It is designed to: 
− recognise prevailing market rates for the Chairman’s and non-executive directors’ fees in other listed companies of a similar 
market value or turnover to Drax; 
− reflect the responsibilities and time commitment; and 
− attract and retain individuals with the necessary skills and experience to contribute to the future growth of the Company. 
Chairman 
The Committee determined that upon his appointment on 17 April 2008, the Chairman’s remuneration should be at the annual rate 
of £200,000, which is reflected in the table of annualised rates of pay on page 67. The Committee determined that the Chairman 
would not receive any increase in his remuneration in the review year ending on 31 March 2011.

Value of £100 invested 
The following graph shows how the value of £100 invested in the Company on the listing of its shares on the London Stock Exchange on 
15 December 2005 has changed and compares that performance with the changing value of the same amount invested at the same 
time in the FTSE100 and FTSE250 indices. These indices have been chosen as suitable broad comparators against which the 
Company’s shareholders may judge their relative returns given that, in recent years, the Company has been a member of both the 
FTSE100 and FTSE250 indices. The graph reflects the TSR (determined according to usual market practice) for the Company and 
each of the indices referred to on a cumulative basis over the period from 15 December 2005 to 31 December 2010.

GROUP – INDEPENDENT AUDITOR’S REPORT 
73
To the members of Drax Group plc 
We have audited the Group financial statements of Drax Group plc for the year ended 31 December 2010 which comprise the 
Consolidated income statement, the Consolidated statement of comprehensive income, the Consolidated balance sheet, the 
Consolidated statement of changes in equity, the Consolidated cash flow statement and the related notes 1 to 31. The financial 
reporting framework that has been applied in their preparation is applicable law and International Financial Reporting Standards 
(“IFRSs”) as adopted by the European Union. 
This report is made solely to the Company’s members, as a body, in accordance with Chapter 3 of Part 16 of the Companies Act 
2006. Our audit work has been undertaken so that we might state to the Company’s members those matters we are required to 
state to them in an auditor’s report and for no other purpose. To the fullest extent permitted by law, we do not accept or assume 
responsibility to anyone other than the Company and the Company’s members as a body, for our audit work, for this report, or for 
the opinions we have formed. 
Respective responsibilities of directors and auditor 
As explained more fully in the Directors’ responsibilities statement, the directors are responsible for the preparation of the Group 
financial statements and for being satisfied that they give a true and fair view. Our responsibility is to audit and express an opinion 
on the Group financial statements in accordance with applicable law and International Standards on Auditing (UK and Ireland). 
Those standards require us to comply with the Auditing Practices Board’s Ethical Standards for Auditors. 
Scope of the audit of the financial statements 
An audit involves obtaining evidence about the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements sufficient to give reasonable 
assurance that the financial statements are free from material misstatement, whether caused by fraud or error. This includes an 
assessment of: whether the accounting policies are appropriate to the Group’s circumstances and have been consistently applied 
and adequately disclosed; the reasonableness of significant accounting estimates made by the directors; and the overall 
presentation of the financial statements. 
Opinion on financial statements 
In our opinion the Group financial statements: 
− give a true and fair view of the state of the Group’s affairs as at 31 December 2010 and of its profit for the year then ended; 
− have been properly prepared in accordance with IFRSs as adopted by the European Union; and 
− have been prepared in accordance with the requirements of the Companies Act 2006 and Article 4 of the IAS Regulation. 
Opinion on other matters prescribed by the Companies Act 2006 
In our opinion the information given in the Directors’ report for the financial year for which the financial statements are prepared is 
consistent with the Group financial statements. 
Matters on which we are required to report by exception 
We have nothing to report in respect of the following: 
Under the Companies Act 2006 we are required to report to you if, in our opinion: 
− certain disclosures of directors’ remuneration specified by law are not made; or 
− we have not received all the information and explanations we require for our audit. 
Under the Listing Rules we are required to review: 
− the directors’ statement contained within the Directors’ report in relation to going concern;  
− the part of the Corporate governance statement relating to the Company’s compliance with the nine provisions of the June 2008 
Combined Code specified for our review; and 
− certain elements of the report to shareholders by the Board on directors’ remuneration. 
Other matters 
We have reported separately on the parent company financial statements of Drax Group plc for the year ended 31 December 2010 
and on the information in the Directors’ remuneration report that is described as having been audited.

NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 
 
79
1. General information 
Drax Group plc (the “Company”) is incorporated in England and Wales under the Companies Act. The Company and its subsidiaries 
(together the “Group”) operate in the electricity generation and supply industry within the UK. The address of the Company’s 
registered office and principal establishment is Drax Power Station, Selby, North Yorkshire YO8 8PH, United Kingdom. The 
operating companies of the Group are disclosed in note 3 to the Company’s separate financial statements, which follow these 
consolidated financial statements. 
2. Basis of preparation 
The financial statements have been prepared in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards (“IFRSs”). Also, 
the financial statements have been prepared in accordance with IFRSs adopted by the European Union and therefore the 
consolidated financial statements comply with Article 4 of the EU IAS Regulations. 
The financial statements have been prepared on a going concern basis, as set out in the Directors’ report on page 42, and on the 
historical cost basis, except for certain financial assets and liabilities that have been measured at fair value.  
Management has performed a review of the presentation of certain items in the income statement and balance sheet. As Drax 
increases the amounts of biomass burnt at the power station, the value of Renewables Obligation Certificates (“ROCs”) in the 
balance sheet is likely to become more significant. Accordingly, management has concluded that ROCs should be separately 
presented in the balance sheet. £33.1 million (2009: £11.7 million) has been reclassified from “inventories” to “intangible assets – 
ROCs held for sale”. 
Additionally, management felt that metering charges, broker fees and ROC costs incurred at Haven Power Limited (“Haven Power”) 
should be separately disclosed under “other retail costs” within the income statement in order to provide better information to 
users of the Annual report and accounts, as the retail business continues to grow. Accordingly £2.9 million of costs included in other 
operating and administrative expenses and £1.5 million of costs included in fuel costs has been reclassified to other retail costs in the 
2009 comparative figures.  
These are presentational changes only and have no net impact on operating profit or net assets for either of the financial years 
disclosed.  
Adoption of new and revised accounting standards 
In 2010, several new, revised and amended standards became effective. These are IFRS 3 (revised) “Business combinations”, IAS 27 
(revised) “Consolidated and separate financial statements”, IAS 28 “Investments in associates”, IAS 31 “Interests in joint ventures”, 
IFRS 2 “Share-based payment” (amendment), IAS 39 (revised) “Financial instruments: recognition and measurement – eligible 
hedged items”, IFRIC 18 “Transfers of assets from customers” and IFRIC 17 “Distribution of non-cash assets to owners”. The 
adoption of these standards and interpretations has not had a material impact on the financial statements of the Group. In future 
periods, IFRS 3 is expected to impact the accounting for business combinations, with any future acquisition costs being expensed in 
the income statement. 
At the date of authorisation of these financial statements, the following standards and relevant interpretations, which have not been 
applied in these financial statements, were in issue but not yet effective (and some of which were pending endorsement by the EU). 
− IFRIC 14 “Prepayments of a minimum funding requirement” – effective for accounting periods beginning on or after

3. Summary of significant accounting policies 
The principal accounting policies adopted in the preparation of these financial statements are set out below. These policies have 
been consistently applied to both years presented, unless otherwise stated. 
(A) Basis of consolidation 
The consolidated financial statements incorporate the financial statements of the Company and entities controlled by the Company 
made up to the reporting date each year. Control is achieved where the Company has the power to govern the financial and 
operating policies of an investee entity so as to obtain benefits from its activities. 
All intra-group transactions, balances, income and expenses are eliminated on consolidation. 
(B) Critical accounting judgements, estimates and assumptions 
The preparation of financial statements in conformity with IFRSs requires the use of estimates and assumptions that affect the 
reported amounts of assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and 
expenses during the reporting period. Although these estimates are based on management’s reasonable knowledge of the amount, 
event or actions, actual results ultimately may differ from those estimates. The critical accounting judgements, estimates and 
assumptions that have a significant risk of causing a material adjustment to the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities within 
the next financial year are discussed below. 
Property, plant and equipment – Estimated useful lives and residual values are reviewed annually, taking into account prices 
prevailing at each balance sheet date. The carrying values of property, plant and equipment are also reviewed for impairment where 
there has been a trigger event (that is, an event which may have resulted in impairment) by assessing the present value of 
estimated future cash flows and net realisable value compared with net book value. The calculation of estimated future cash flows 
and residual values is based on management’s reasonable estimates of future prices, output and costs, and is therefore subjective. 
Impairment – The Group tests annually whether goodwill has suffered any impairment, in accordance with the accounting policy 
stated in note 3 (F). The recoverable amounts of cash-generating units have been determined based on value in use calculations. 
These calculations require the use of estimates (see note 9). 
Pensions – The Group operates an approved defined benefit scheme. The cost of providing benefits is determined using the 
projected unit credit method and actuarial valuations of the plan assets and liabilities are carried out as at the balance sheet date. 
Inherent in these valuations are key assumptions, including discount rates, inflation rates, expected returns on scheme assets, salary 
and pension increases, and mortality rates.  
These actuarial assumptions are reviewed annually and modified as appropriate. The Group believes that the assumptions utilised in 
recording obligations under the scheme are reasonable based on prior experience, market conditions and the advice of scheme 
actuaries. However, actual results may differ from such assumptions. 
Taxation – In accounting for taxation the Group makes assumptions regarding the treatment of items of income and expenditure for 
tax purposes. The Group believes that these assumptions are reasonable based on prior experience and consultation with advisers.  
Full provision is made for deferred taxation at the rates of tax prevailing at the period end dates unless future rates have been 
substantively enacted. Deferred tax assets are recognised where it is considered more likely than not that they will be recovered, 
taking into account the nature of the losses, and the certainty of the relevant offsetting income streams. 
Derivatives – Derivative financial instruments are stated in the balance sheet at their fair value. Changes in the fair value 
of derivatives are recorded each period in earnings unless specific hedge accounting criteria are met. The fair values of derivative 
instruments for commodities and foreign exchange rates are determined using forward price curves. Forward price curves 
represent the Group’s estimates of the prices at which a buyer or seller could contract today for delivery or settlement of a 
commodity or foreign exchange payment or receipt, at future dates. The Group generally bases forward price curves upon readily 
obtainable market price quotations, as the Group’s commodity and forward foreign exchange contracts do not generally extend 
beyond the actively traded portion of these curves. However, the forward price curves used are only an estimate of how future 
prices will move and are, therefore, subjective. 
(C) Revenue recognition 
Revenue represents amounts receivable for goods or services provided in the normal course of business, net of trade discounts, 
VAT and other sales-related taxes, and excluding transactions with or between group companies. 
Revenues from the sale of electricity are recorded based upon output delivered at rates specified under contract terms or prevailing 
market rates as applicable. 
Revenues from sales of ROCs are recorded at the invoiced value, net of VAT. Revenue is recognised when the risks and rewards of 
ownership have been substantially transferred to a third party.  
Where goods or services are exchanged for goods or services of a similar nature and value, the exchange is not treated as giving 
rise to revenue. Where goods or services are exchanged for goods or services of a dissimilar nature, the exchange is treated as 
giving rise to revenue. The revenue is measured at the fair value of goods or services received, adjusted by the amount of any 
cash or cash equivalents received or paid. If the fair value of the goods or services received cannot be measured reliably, the 
revenue is measured at the fair value of the goods or services given up, adjusted by the amount of any cash or cash equivalents 
received or paid.

Revenue from the sale of electricity direct to customers through our retail business, Haven Power is recorded after deduction of 
trade discounts, VAT and Climate Change Levy. Revenue is recognised on the supply of electricity when a contract exists, supply has 
taken place, a quantifiable price has been established or can be determined and the receivables are likely to be recovered. 
Energy supplied, but not yet measured or billed is calculated based on consumption statistics and selling price estimates.  
(D) Segmental reporting 
The business activity of the Group consists of the generation and sale of electricity at the Drax Power Station, along with the sale 
of electricity direct to customers through our retail business, Haven Power. The retail segment currently falls below the threshold 
of separate reportable segments under IFRS 8 “Operating Segments” and as such we only present one operating segment.  
(E) Business combinations 
The acquisition of subsidiaries is accounted for using the purchase method. The cost of the acquisition is measured at the aggregate 
of the fair values, at the date of exchange, of assets given, liabilities incurred or assumed and equity instruments issued by the 
Group in exchange for control of the acquiree, plus any costs directly attributable to the business combination. The acquiree’s 
identifiable assets, liabilities and contingent liabilities that meet the criteria for recognition under IFRS 3 are recognised at their 
fair value at the acquisition date. For business combinations made after 1 July 2010, costs directly attributable to the business 
combination are not included in the measurement of cost, but expensed in the income statement in line with IFRS 3 (revised). 
(F) Goodwill 
Goodwill arising on an acquisition is recognised as an asset and initially measured at cost, being the excess of the cost of the 
business combination over the Group’s interest in the net fair value of the identifiable assets, liabilities and contingent liabilities 
recognised. Goodwill which is recognised as an asset is reviewed for impairment at least annually. Any impairment is recognised 
immediately in the income statement and is not subsequently reversed.  
For the purpose of impairment testing, goodwill is allocated to each of the Group’s cash-generating units expected to benefit from 
the synergies of the combination. Cash-generating units to which goodwill has been allocated are tested for impairment annually or 
more frequently where there is an indication it may be impaired. If the recoverable amount of the cash-generating unit is less than 
its carrying amount, the impairment loss is allocated first to reduce the carrying amount of goodwill and then to its other assets. 
On disposal of a subsidiary, the attributable amount of goodwill is included in the determination of the profit or loss on disposal.  
(G) Property, plant and equipment 
Property, plant and equipment are initially measured at cost. Cost comprises the purchase price (after deducting trade discounts 
and rebates), any directly attributable costs of bringing the asset to the location and condition necessary for it to be capable of 
operating in the manner intended by management, and the estimate of the present value of the costs of dismantling and removing 
the item and restoring the site. Property, plant and equipment are stated at cost less accumulated depreciation and any provision 
for impairment in value. Freehold land and assets in the course of construction are not depreciated.  
Depreciation is provided on a straight-line basis to write down assets to their residual value evenly over the estimated useful lives 
of the assets from the date of acquisition (limited to the expected decommissioning date of the power station). The estimated useful 
lives, beginning in 2004 when they were reset, are currently: 
 
Years
Main generating plant and freehold buildings 
35
Other plant and machinery 
3-20
Decommissioning asset 
35
Plant spare parts 
35
Estimated useful lives and residual values are reviewed annually, taking into account commercial and technological obsolescence 
as well as normal wear and tear, and any provision for impairment. Residual values are based on prices prevailing at each balance 
sheet date. 
Costs relating to major inspections, overhauls and upgrades to the power station are included in the asset’s carrying amount or 
recognised as a separate asset, as appropriate, if the recognition criteria are met; namely, when it is probable that future economic 
benefits associated with the item will flow to the Group and the cost of the item can be measured reliably. All other repairs and 
maintenance costs are expensed as incurred.

3. Summary of significant accounting policies (continued) 
(H) Impairment of property, plant and equipment 
At each balance sheet date the Group reviews its property, plant and equipment to determine whether there is any indication that 
these assets may have suffered an impairment loss. If such an indication exists, the recoverable amount is assessed by reference to 
the net present value of expected future cash flows of the asset (value in use) or sales value net of expenses. If an asset is impaired, 
a provision is made to reduce its carrying amount to the estimated recoverable amount. The discount rate applied is a pre-tax rate 
based upon the Group’s weighted average cost of capital and reflects the current market assessment of the time value of money 
and the risks specific to the business. 
(I) Decommissioning costs 
Provision is made for the estimated decommissioning costs at the end of the useful economic life of the Group’s generating assets, 
when a legal or constructive obligation arises, on a discounted basis. The amount provided represents the present value of the 
expected costs. An amount equivalent to the discounted provision is capitalised within tangible fixed assets and is depreciated over 
the useful lives of the related assets. The unwinding of the discount is included in interest payable and similar charges. 
(J) Inventories 
Inventories primarily comprise coal and biomass stocks, together with other fuels and consumables. Coal and biomass stocks are 
valued at the lower of the weighted average cost and net realisable value. Other stocks of fuel and consumables are valued at the 
lower of average cost and net realisable value. 
(K) Intangible assets – ROCs held for sale 
The Group is able to claim ROCs from the Office of Gas and Electricity Markets (“OFGEM”) as a result of burning renewable fuels 
instead of coal. A market exists for the sale of ROCs and the Group recognises revenue in the income statement at the point where 
the risks and rewards of ownership have been substantially transferred to a third party. The attributable incremental cost of 
generating ROCs above that of burning coal, limited to the recoverable amount expected to be realised, is included within current 
intangible assets in respect of ROCs earned but not yet sold.  
(L) CO2 emissions allowances 
The Group recognises its free emissions allowances received under the UK NAP at £nil cost allocated to each financial year on a 
straight line basis. Any additional allowances purchased in the market are recorded at cost. The Group also recognises a liability in 
respect of its unsettled obligations to deliver emissions allowances. The charge to the income statement within fuel costs and the 
liability is measured based on an estimate of the amounts that will be required to satisfy the net obligation, taking into account 
generation, free allowances allocated under the UK NAP, market purchases, sales and forward contracts already in place allocated 
to the financial year, and the market price at the balance sheet date. 
(M) Taxation 
Current tax is provided at amounts expected to be paid (or recovered) using the tax rates and laws that have been enacted or 
substantively enacted by the balance sheet date. 
Deferred tax is the tax payable or recoverable on the difference between the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities in the 
balance sheet and the corresponding tax bases used in the computation of taxable profits. Deferred tax liabilities are generally 
recognised for all taxable temporary differences and deferred tax assets are recognised to the extent that it is considered more 
likely than not that taxable profit will be available against which deductible temporary differences can be utilised. 
Deferred tax is calculated at the tax rates that have been substantively enacted at the balance sheet date and are expected to apply 
in the period in which the liability is settled or the asset is realised, and is charged or credited in the income statement, except where 
it relates to items charged or credited to equity via the statement of comprehensive income, in which case the deferred tax is also 
dealt with in equity and is shown in the statement of comprehensive income. 
(N) Pension and other post-retirement benefits 
The Group provides pensions through an approved industry defined benefit scheme and a defined contribution scheme. The cost of 
providing benefits under the defined benefit scheme is determined using the projected unit credit method, and actuarial valuations 
of the plan assets and liabilities are carried out as at the balance sheet date. Actuarial gains and losses are recognised in full in the 
statement of comprehensive income. 
The current service cost and interest cost of the pension charge are deducted in arriving at operating profit in other operating and 
administrative expenses. The excess of the present value of the defined benefit obligation over the fair value of the plan assets is 
recognised as a liability in the balance sheet. 
For the defined contribution scheme, the Group pays contributions to publicly or privately administered pension insurance plans on 
a mandatory, contractual or voluntary basis. The Group has no further payment obligations once the contributions have been paid. 
The contributions are recognised as employee benefit expense when they are due to be paid. 
(O) Share-based payments 
Share-based payments are measured at fair value at the date of grant and expensed on a straight-line basis over the relevant 
vesting period, based on an estimate of the shares that will ultimately vest.

(P) Foreign currencies 
The Group’s consolidated financial statements are presented in sterling, which is the functional and presentational currency of the 
Company and its principal subsidiaries. Transactions in foreign currencies are translated into sterling at the exchange rate ruling at 
the date of transaction. Foreign exchange gains and losses resulting from the settlement of such transactions, and from the 
translation at the exchange rate ruling at the balance sheet date of monetary assets and liabilities denominated in foreign 
currencies, are recognised in the income statement. 
(Q) Financial instruments 
Debt instruments 
The Group measures all debt instruments, whether financial assets or financial liabilities, initially at the fair value of the 
consideration paid or received. Subsequent to initial measurement, debt instruments are measured at amortised cost using the 
effective interest method. Transaction costs (any such costs incremental and directly attributable to the issue of the financial 
instrument) are included in the calculation of the effective interest rate and are, in effect, amortised through the income statement 
over the life of the instrument.  
Fees paid on the establishment of loan facilities are recognised as transaction costs of the loan to the extent that it is probable that 
some or all of the facility will be drawn down. In this case, the fee is deferred until the draw-down occurs.  
Commodity contracts and treasury derivatives  
Where possible, the Group takes the own use exemption for commodity contracts entered into and held for the purpose of the 
Group’s own purchase, sale or usage requirements. Commodity contracts which do not qualify for the own use exemption are dealt 
with as derivatives and are recorded at fair value in the balance sheet with changes in fair value reflected through the hedge reserve 
to the extent that contracts are treated as effective hedges, or the income statement to the extent the contracts are not treated as 
effective hedges. 
The Group designates certain hedging instruments used to address commodity price risk as cash flow hedges. At the inception of 
the hedge, the relationship between the hedging instrument and hedged item is documented, along with its risk management 
objectives. Furthermore, at the inception of the hedge and on an ongoing basis, the Group documents whether the hedging 
instruments used in hedging transactions are highly effective in offsetting changes in cash flows of hedged items. 
The Group also uses a number of treasury related derivatives to manage exposure to interest rate and currency fluctuations. 
Treasury related derivatives are recorded at fair value in the balance sheet with changes in fair value reflected through the hedge 
reserve to the extent that contracts are considered to be effective cash flow hedges, or the income statement to the extent the 
contracts are not effective as hedges.  
The effective portion of changes in the fair value of derivatives that are designated and qualify as cash flow hedges are deferred in 
equity. The gain or loss relating to any ineffective portion is recognised immediately in the income statement. Amounts deferred 
in equity are released in the periods when the hedged item is recognised in the income statement. 
The fair value of hedging derivatives is classified as a non-current asset or non-current liability if the remaining maturity of the 
hedge relationship is more than 12 months, and as a current asset or liability if the remaining maturity of the hedge relationship 
is less than 12 months. Derivatives not designated into an effective hedge relationship are classified as a current asset or current 
liability. 
Other financial instruments 
Issued equity – Ordinary shares are classified as equity as evidenced by their residual interest in the assets of the Company after 
deducting all of its liabilities. Incremental costs directly attributable to the issue of new shares or options are shown in equity as a 
deduction, net of tax, from the proceeds. The share premium account records the difference between the nominal value of shares 
issued and the fair value of the consideration received. 
Cash and cash equivalents – Cash and cash equivalents includes cash in hand, deposits held at call with banks, other short-term 
highly liquid investments with original maturities of three months or less, and bank overdrafts.  
Short-term investments – Short-term investments includes cash held on deposits with financial institutions, with a maturity 
of greater than three months at inception. 
Trade and other receivables and payables – Trade and other receivables and payables are measured at amortised cost using 
the effective interest method. A provision for impairment of trade receivables is established subsequently where there is 
objective evidence that the Group will not be able to collect all amounts due according to the original terms of the receivable. 
Interest income is recognised by applying the effective interest rate, except for short-term items where the recognition 
of interest would be immaterial.

6. Taxation 
The income tax expense reflects the estimated effective tax rate on profit before tax for the Group for the year ended 
31 December 2010 and the movement in the deferred tax balance in the year, so far as it relates to items recognised in the 
income statement. 
Under the Group’s previous financing structure, Drax Holdings Limited (a subsidiary company) was partially funded by a Eurobond 
payable to another group company. The whole of the coupon was previously prepaid, and an accounting based tax deduction has 
been claimed with the corresponding interest charged in the Drax Holdings Limited income statement each year to 31 December 
2008. Were HMRC to successfully challenge the deductions claimed in respect of the Eurobond coupons for open years to 31 
December 2008, it is estimated that the additional tax liability would be up to £90 million, together with interest and penalties. In 
November/December 2008, HMRC issued draft legislation which updated rules on, amongst other things, the tax deductibility of 
interest and which was generally expected to reduce the tax effectiveness of the Eurobond financing arrangements.  
As previously described, the Eurobond was formally waived by the lending group company on 30 December 2008. As a result, the 
whole of the remaining prepaid coupon was charged in the Drax Holdings Limited income statement, giving rise to potential 
additional interest deductions with a tax effect of around £220 million. Because of the risks related to the unwind of the Eurobond 
structure, no benefit will be recognised in the Group’s financial statements with respect to the potential additional deductions until 
the Group is more certain they will be realised. We have continued our dialogue with HMRC over this tax position. However, whilst 
we still believe we have a strong and robust case, we are no clearer as to whether we will ultimately be successful.  
Changes in the rate of tax 
On 28 June 2010, the Finance Bill 2010-11 was presented to Parliament. The Bill proposed four annual reductions in the rate of 
corporation tax from 28% to 24% by 2014-15. At the balance sheet date, the reduction in the corporation tax rate to 27% from 
April 2011 had been enacted. The resulting net reduction in the deferred tax liability has been reflected in the balance sheet at 
31 December 2010 and gave rise to a credit to the income statement for the year ended 31 December 2010 of £8 million. It is 
currently expected that each future Finance Bill enacted will reduce the corporation tax rate by 1% until the rate of 24% is reached.

payable on or before 13 May 2011. The final dividend has not been included as a liability as at 31 December 2010. 
8. Earnings per share 
Basic earnings per share is calculated by dividing the earnings attributable to ordinary shareholders by the weighted average 
number of ordinary shares outstanding during the year. In calculating diluted earnings per share the weighted average number of 
ordinary shares outstanding during the year is adjusted, when relevant, to take account of outstanding share options in relation to 
the Group’s Approved Savings-Related Share Option Plan (“SAYE Plan”) and contingently issuable shares under the Group’s 
Executive Share Incentive Plan (“ESIP”) and Bonus Matching Plan (“BMP”). The underlying earnings per share has been calculated 
after excluding the after tax impact of marking to market derivative contracts which are not hedged.

Goodwill arising on the Haven Power acquisition has been allocated to the Haven cash-generating unit (Haven Power Limited, or 
Haven Power). At 31 December 2010, the fair value of goodwill was significantly in excess of its book value; accordingly a sensitivity 
analysis has not been disclosed.

The recoverable amount of Haven Power was calculated based on a value in use calculation. The key assumptions used in these 
calculations are those regarding the discount rates and future cash flows. Management estimates discount rates using pre-tax rates 
that reflect current market assessments of the time value of money and the risks specific to the business. The first five years of cash 
flows are based upon the five year Business Plan approved by the Board. Future cash flows have been taken in perpetuity, assuming 
no growth rate is applied to the final year of the Business Plan. The pre-tax rate used to discount the forecast cash flows from Haven 
Power is 12% reflecting a reasonable assumption of the applicable cost of capital.

Trade receivables principally represent sales of electricity to a number of counterparties. At 31 December 2010, the Group had 
amounts receivable from three (2009: four) significant counterparties, representing 75% (2009: 73%) of trade receivables, all of 
which paid within 15 days of receipt of invoice in line with agreed terms. Counterparty risk is discussed in note 18. 
Total revenue for the year ended 31 December 2010 includes amounts of £307.0 million, £295.6 million and £159.1 million (2009: 
£222.9 million and £221.8 million) derived from three customers (2009: two customers), each representing 10% or more of the 
Group’s revenue for the year. 
Management does not consider there to be a significant concentration of credit risk and as a result, does not believe that a further 
credit risk provision is required in excess of the normal provision for doubtful debts of £2.6 million (2009: £1.2 million). 
This allowance has been determined by reference to past default experience, and includes £2.6 million in relation to Haven Power 
(2009: £1.1 million).  
The movement in the allowance for doubtful debts is laid out in the following table:

were made in line with the target repayment profile as a result of the levels of cash available for debt service. 
On 3 August 2009, the Group completed the refinancing of the term loan facility and the £100 million working capital facility which 
would otherwise have fallen due for repayment on 31 December 2010. The maturity date of both facilities has been extended to 
December 2012 to coincide with the maturity of the £200 million letter of credit facility, which remains in place. Future scheduled 
debt repayments are £67.5 million in each of 2011 and 2012, after which point the term loan will have been repaid in full.

Letter of credit facility and revolving credit facility 
In addition to its borrowings, the Group has access to a letter of credit facility which provides credit support of up to £200 million 
to the Group’s trading activities. The letter of credit facility, which has a final maturity date in December 2012, provides a mechanism 
whereby it may be extended for a further 12 months at any time up to one year before the final maturity date. The Group 
guarantees the obligations of a number of banks in respect of the letters of credit issued by those banks to counterparties of the 
Group. As at 31 December 2010 the Group’s contingent liability in respect of these guarantees amounted to £134.3 million (2009: 
£141.3 million). 
In addition, the Group has access to an undrawn £100 million revolving credit facility agreement, which may be used to issue letters 
of credit or for working capital, with a final maturity date of December 2012.

18. Financial instruments 
The Group issues or holds financial instruments for two purposes: financial instruments relating to the financing and management 
of risks for the Group’s operations; and financial instruments relating to the financing and risks in the Group’s debt portfolio. 
The Group’s financial instruments comprise borrowings, cash and liquid resources, items that arise directly from its operations 
and derivative contracts. The Group enters into short-term and medium-term forward contracts for the sale of electricity and the 
purchase of coal and CO2 emissions allowances. The Group also enters into interest rate swap agreements and forward foreign 
currency exchange contracts. 
Fair value 
Cash and cash equivalents, short-term investments, trade and other receivables, and trade and other payables generally have short 
times to maturity. For this reason, their carrying values approximate their fair value. The Group’s borrowings relate principally to 
term loans, the carrying amounts of which approximate their fair values by virtue of being floating rate instruments. 
The fair values and maturities of the Group’s derivative financial instruments which are marked-to-market and recorded in the 
balance sheet at 31 December 2010 and 31 December 2009 were as follows:

Unrealised losses on derivative contracts recognised in arriving at operating profit 
(60.5)
(129.7)
The unrealised gains and losses recorded in the income statement arise from a proportion of our derivative contracts which do not 
qualify for hedge accounting; largely financial coal and foreign exchange.  
Due to the nature of commodity contracts and the way they are managed, the own use exemption has been applied to a limited 
number of them, including the five and a quarter year baseload contract with Centrica which commenced on 1 October 2007, and 
the five year baseload contract with Centrica which commenced on 1 October 2010. 
− Commodity contracts fair value – The fair value of commodity contracts qualifying as derivative financial instruments, not 
excluded through the own use exemption, is calculated by reference to forward market prices at the balance sheet date. 
As contracts are generally short-term, forward market price curves are available for the duration of the contracts. The quoted 
market price used for financial assets held by the Group is the current bid price; the quoted price for financial liabilities is the 
current ask price.

NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

18. Financial instruments (continued) 
− Interest rate swaps fair value – The fair value of interest rate swap contracts is determined by discounting the future cash 
flows using forward interest rate curves at the balance sheet date. 
− Forward foreign currency exchange contracts fair value – The fair value of forward foreign currency exchange contracts is 
determined using forward currency exchange market rates at the balance sheet date. 
− Embedded derivatives fair value – The Group has also reviewed all contracts for the presence of embedded derivatives. 
Where contracts were found to contain embedded derivatives, they were considered to be closely related to the economic 
characteristics and risks of the host contract, and therefore do not require separate valuation from their host contracts. 
All financial instruments that are measured subsequent to initial recognition at fair value, have been grouped into Level 2, as defined 
below, based on the degree to which fair value is observable. 
Categorisation within the fair value measurement hierarchy has been determined on the basis of the lowest level input that is 
significant to the fair value measurement of the relevant asset or liability as follows: 
Level 1 – fair value measurements are those derived from quoted prices (unadjusted) in active markets for identical assets or 
liabilities; 
Level 2 – fair value measurements are those derived from inputs other than quoted prices included within Level 1 that are 
observable for the asset or liability, either directly (i.e. as prices) or indirectly (i.e. derived from prices); and 
Level 3 – fair value measurements are those derived from valuation techniques that include inputs for the asset or liability that are 
not based on observable market data (unobservable inputs).  
The fair value of commodity contracts and forward foreign exchange currency contracts is determined by comparison between 
forward market prices and the contract price; therefore these contracts are categorised as Level 2. The fair value of interest rate 
swap contracts is determined by discounting future cash flows using forward interest rate curves at the balance sheet date. 
These are also categorised as Level 2 inputs.  
There have been no transfers during the year between Level 1, 2 or 3 category inputs.  
Risk 
The Group’s activities expose it to a variety of financial risks including commodity price risk, interest rate risk, foreign currency risk, 
liquidity risk, counterparty risk and credit risk. The Group’s overall risk management programme focuses on the unpredictability of 
commodity and financial markets and seeks to manage potential adverse effects on the Group’s financial performance.  
The Group uses derivative financial instruments to hedge certain risk exposures. Risk management is carried out by the Risk 
Management Committees as detailed in Corporate governance (page 52) which identify, evaluate and hedge financial risks in close 
co-operation with the Group’s trading function under policies approved by the Board of directors. 
Commodity price risk 
The Group is exposed to the effect of fluctuations in commodity prices, particularly the price of electricity, the price of coal, biomass 
and other fuels, and the price of CO2 emissions allowances. Price variations and market cycles have historically influenced the 
financial results of the Group and are expected to continue to do so. 
The Group has a policy of making forward power sales with corresponding purchases of fuel and CO2 emissions allowances when 
profitable to do so. All commitments to sell power under fixed price contracts are designated as cash flow hedges in order to reduce 
the Group’s cash flow exposure resulting from fluctuations in the price of electricity.  
The Group purchases coal, biomass and other fuels under either fixed or variable priced contracts with different maturities from 
a variety of domestic and international sources. All international physical coal purchase contracts transacted at a fixed price and 
financial coal contracts exchanging floating price coal for fixed price amounts are designated as cash flow hedges in order to 
reduce the Group’s cash flow exposure resulting from fluctuations in the price of coal. All physical biomass purchase contracts are 
currently entered into and held for the purpose of the Group’s own purchase, sale or usage requirements and are therefore 
designated as own use. 
The Group purchases CO2 emissions allowances under fixed price contracts with different maturity dates from a range of domestic 
and international sources. All commitments to purchase CO2 emissions allowances under fixed price contracts are designated as 
cash flow hedges in order to reduce the Group’s cash flow exposure resulting from fluctuations in the price of CO2 emissions 
allowances.  
Commodity price sensitivity 
The sensitivity analysis below has been determined based on the exposure to commodity prices for outstanding monetary items at 
the balance sheet date. The analysis is based on the Group’s commodity financial instruments held at each balance sheet date.  
If commodity prices had been 5% higher/lower and all other variables were held constant, the Group’s: 
− profit after tax for the year ended 31 December 2010 would decrease/increase by £17.3 million (2009: decrease/increase by 
£16.1 million). This is mainly attributable to the Group’s exposure to financial coal derivatives; and 
Drax Group plc
Annual report and accounts 2010
Financials
 
93
− other equity reserves would decrease/increase by £9.3 million (2009: decrease/increase by £30.3 million) mainly as a result of 
the changes in the fair value of commitments to sell power. 
Interest rate risk 
The Group is exposed to interest rate risk principally in relation to its outstanding bank debt. In particular, it is exposed to changes in 
the LIBOR interest rate of sterling denominated debt, as all of its debt is both denominated in sterling and has a variable LIBOR rate. 
The Group mitigates this risk with interest rate hedges on a proportion of its debt facilities. Information about the Group’s 
instruments that are exposed to interest rate risk and their repayment schedules is included in note 17. 
Following the refinancing of the term loan in 2009, new interest rate swaps were taken out which do not meet the required hedge 
criteria and hence movements in the fair value of the new swaps are recognised in the income statement. The fair value of the 
previous swaps was frozen on refinancing and has been unwound over the period to December 2010. 
Interest rate sensitivity 
The sensitivity analysis below has been determined based on the exposure to interest rates for both derivatives and non-derivative 
instruments at the balance sheet date. For floating rate liabilities, the analysis is prepared assuming the amount of liability 
outstanding at the balance sheet date was outstanding for the whole year.  
If interest rates had been 1% higher/lower and all other variables were held constant, the Group’s profit after tax and net assets 
for the year ended 31 December 2010 would increase/decrease by £0.2 million (2009: profit after tax would decrease/increase 
by £0.8 million, other equity reserves would increase/decrease by £1.2 million) mainly as a result of the changes in the fair value 
of interest rate swaps. 
Foreign currency risk 
Foreign currency exchange contracts are entered into to hedge substantially all of the Group’s fixed price international coal 
purchases in US dollars, biomass purchases in Canadian and US dollars and euros, and CO2 emissions allowances purchases in euros. 
Exchange rate exposures are managed within approved policy parameters utilising foreign currency exchange contracts. 
Foreign currency sensitivity 
If sterling exchange rates had been 5% stronger/weaker against other currencies, and all other variables were held constant, 
the Group’s: 
− profit after tax for the year ended 31 December 2010 would increase/decrease by £6.1 million (2009: increase/decrease by 
£1.1 million). This is mainly attributable to the Group’s exposure to foreign currency exchange contracts for the purposes of 
meeting commitments under financial coal contracts; and 
− other equity reserves would decrease/increase by £0.9 million (2009: net assets would increase/decrease by £1.1 million) 
as a result of the changes in the fair value of hedged foreign currency exchange contracts. 
Liquidity risk 
The treasury function is responsible for liquidity, funding and settlement management under policies approved by the Board of 
directors. Liquidity needs are monitored using regular forecasting of operational cash flows and financing commitments. The Group 
maintains a mixture of cash and cash equivalents, long-term debt and committed facilities in order to ensure sufficient funding for 
business requirements.  
The following tables set out details of the expected contractual maturity of non-derivative financial liabilities. The tables include 
both interest and principal cash flows. To the extent that interest flows are floating rate, the undiscounted amount is derived from 
interest rate curves at the balance sheet date.

Counterparty risk 
As the Group relies on third party suppliers for the delivery of coal, biomass and other goods and services, it is exposed to the risk of 
non-performance by these third party suppliers. The Group purchases a significant portion of its coal requirement under contracts 
with a number of UK suppliers. There is a risk that if a large supplier falls into financial difficulty and/or fails to deliver against the 
contracts, there would be additional costs associated with securing coal from other suppliers.  
The Group enters into fixed price and fixed margin contracts for the sale of electricity to a number of counterparties. The failure of 
one or more of these counterparties to perform their contractual obligations may cause the Group financial distress or increase the 
risk profile of the Group. 
The Group is also exposed to the risk of collateral calls against its trading contracts should the Group’s creditworthiness deteriorate 
and its counterparties demand collateral to protect their exposure to the Group. In order to mitigate this risk the Group has 
undertaken a number of actions – refining its trading strategy to concentrate on more credit-efficient structures and to transact 
more fixed margin contracts which are less exposed to commodity price movements; and increasing the volume of business traded 
through its supply company, Haven Power, which is less exposed to collateral calls. In addition, the Group entered into a trading 
agreement with Barclays Bank PLC on 5 May 2010, which enables it to enter into trading contracts without the requirement to  
post collateral up to a fixed amount of £135 million, irrespective of the Group’s underlying credit rating.

Trade and other receivables are stated gross of the provision for doubtful debts of £2.6 million (2009: £1.2 million). Credit exposure 
is controlled by counterparty limits that are reviewed and approved by a management committee. Counterparties without an 
investment grade rating are normally required to provide credit support in the form of a parent company guarantee, letter of credit, 
deed of charge, or cash collateral. Where deemed appropriate the Group has purchased credit default swaps. 
The investment of surplus cash is undertaken to maximise the return within Board approved policies. These policies manage credit risk 
exposure by setting out minimum rating requirements, maximum investment with any one counterparty and the maturity profile. 
Capital management 
The Group manages its capital to ensure it is able to continue as a going concern, and maintain its credit rating while maximising 
the return to stakeholders through the optimisation of the debt and equity balance. The capital structure of the Group consists of 
shareholders’ equity excluding the hedge reserve, together with net debt or, when the Group has net cash, shareholders’ equity 
excluding the hedge reserve less net cash. Net debt/cash comprises borrowings disclosed in note 17, cash and cash equivalents in 
note 15 and short-term investments in note 14. Equity attributable to the shareholders of the Company comprises issued capital, 
capital reserves and accumulated losses, excluding the hedge reserve, (see Consolidated statement of changes in equity). 
Maintaining an optimal supporting capital structure is one of the Group’s key priorities, and as such, our performance is detailed on 
page 16 of the Business review. The capital structure of the Group is as follows:

The provision for reinstatement represents the estimated decommissioning, demolition and site remediation costs at the end of the 
useful economic life of the Group’s generating assets, on a discounted basis. The amount provided represents the present value of 
the expected costs. An amount equivalent to the initial provision is capitalised within property, plant and equipment and is being 
depreciated over the useful lives of the related assets. The unwinding of the discount is included in finance costs (note 5). 
The provision is estimated using the assumption that the reinstatement will take place between 2039 and 2045, and has been 
estimated using existing technology at current prices. The discount rate applied is the pre-tax rate based upon the Group’s weighted 
average cost of capital and reflects the current market assessment of the time value of money and the risks specific to the business.

profits is probable (note 3 (B)).  
As described in note 6, no deferred tax asset has been recognised with respect to the unwind of the Eurobond financing structure.  
The Group did not recognise deferred tax assets estimated at £3.2 million at 31 December 2010 (2009: £3.7 million) in respect of

Issue of share capital 
On 23 June 2009, the Group announced the placing of approximately 25.5 million new ordinary shares, representing 7.5% of the 
Group’s existing issued ordinary share capital. The placing raised £105.5 million and was undertaken to help maintain the Group’s 
investment grade debt rating, with the proceeds used to pay down debt on 31 July 2009.  
The placing shares were credited as fully paid and rank equally in all respects with the existing ordinary shares of 1116⁄29 pence each 
in the capital of the Company, including the right to receive all dividends and other distributions declared, made or paid in respect of 
such shares after the date of issue of the placing shares.

The share placing was achieved through a “cash box” placing arrangement. The benefit of a cash box placing arrangement is that 
it is legally structured to enable the merger relief criteria within the Companies Act to apply. Accordingly the funds raised in excess 
of the nominal value of the shares issued have been treated as distributable within retained reserves rather than credited to the 
share premium account. As a consequence, of the £105.5 million funds raised, share capital increased by £2.9 million, and the 
balance of £102.6 million reduced the Group’s accumulated losses in the year ended 31 December 2009.  
Issued under employee share schemes 
On 1 September 2010, a total of 6,098 ordinary shares of 1116⁄29 pence each in the Company were issued in satisfaction of shares 
vesting in accordance with the rules of the Group’s Bonus Matching Plan to six individuals whose employment with the Group had 
terminated due to retirement. There were no such issues in 2009.  
The Company has only one class of shares, which are ordinary shares, carrying no right to fixed income. No shareholders have 
waived their rights to dividends.

Share Incentive Plan (“SIP”) 
Under the 2009 SIP Free share award, the Company’s employee benefit trust purchased shares to be held on behalf of qualifying 
employees equating to a cash value of approximately £1,000 per employee based on the Company’s share price at the time of the 
award. The fair value of the 2009 Free share award of £0.7 million was charged to the income statement in full in the year ended 
31 December 2009. There were no SIP Free shares awarded in 2010. 
Between 2007 and 2009, qualifying employees could buy up to £1,500 worth of Partnership shares in any one tax year. Matching 
shares were awarded to employees to match any Partnership shares they bought, in a ratio of one-to-one, with the cost of Matching 
shares borne by the Group. The fair value of Matching shares awarded in the year to 31 December 2009 of £0.5 million was charged 
to the income statement on a straight-line basis over a one year vesting period now ended. There were no awards under the SIP 
Partnership and Matching share plan in 2010.

Executive Share Incentive Plan (“ESIP”) 
Between 2006 and 2008 the Group operated the ESIP. Under the ESIP, annual awards of performance shares were made at £nil 
consideration to executive directors and other senior staff up to a normal maximum of 100% of salary. Shares vest according to 
whether Drax’s Total Shareholder Return (“TSR”) matches or outperforms an index (determined in accordance with the scheme 
rules) over three years. The fair value of the 2008, 2007 and 2006 ESIP awards, of £1.2 million, £0.9 million and £1.9 million 
respectively are or have been charged to the income statement on a straight-line basis over the corresponding three year vesting 
periods.

Bonus Matching Plan (“BMP”) 
The BMP was introduced in 2009 to replace the ESIP. Under the BMP, annual awards of performance and service related shares are 
made at £nil consideration to executive directors and other senior staff up to a normal maximum of 150% of their annual bonus. 
A proportion of the shares vesting is conditional upon whether Drax’s TSR matches or out-performs an index (determined in 
accordance with the scheme rules) over three years. The fair value of the 2010 BMP awards of £3.0 million (2009: £2.8 million) is 
being charged to the income statement on a straight-line basis over the three year vesting period to April 2013 (2009: April 2012).

Savings-Related Share Option Plan (“SAYE Plan”) 
In April 2010, participation in the SAYE Plan was offered to all qualifying employees. Options were granted for employees to 
acquire shares at a price of 310.5 pence (representing a discount of 20% to the prevailing market price determined in accordance 
with the scheme rules), exercisable at the end of three or five year savings contracts. The fair value of the 2010 options granted in 
connection with the SAYE Plan of £0.6 million is being charged to the income statement over the life of the respective contracts. 
The only previous grant under the SAYE Plan, in July 2006 at an exercise price of 636 pence, resulted in a fair value of £0.5 million 
being charged to the income statement over the life of the respective contracts.

Fair value of share-based payment awards 
The fair value of share-based payment awards was determined as follows: 
SIP – based on price paid at award dates; 
ESIP and BMP – Monte-Carlo valuation model, which takes into account the estimated probability of different levels of vesting; and 
SAYE – Black-Scholes model which compares exercise price to share price at the date of grant.

The Group’s cash flow hedges relate to commodity contracts (principally commitments to sell power), forward foreign currency 
exchange contracts and interest rate swaps. Amounts are recognised in the hedge reserve as the designated contracts are marked-
to-market at each period end for the effective portion of the hedge, which is generally 100% of the relevant contract. Amounts held 
within the hedge reserve are then released as the related contract matures and the hedged transaction impacts profit or loss. 
For power sales contracts, this is when the underlying power is delivered. Further information in relation to the Group’s accounting 
for financial instruments is included in notes 3 and 18.

29. Retirement benefit obligations 
The Group operates an approved defined benefit scheme on behalf of the Drax Power Group (“DPG”) of the Electricity Supply 
Pension Scheme (“ESPS”). This scheme was closed to new members as from 1 January 2002 unless they qualify through being 
existing members of another part of the ESPS. The Group also operates a defined contribution scheme. 
Defined benefit scheme 
As at the year end, the most recent actuarial valuation of the DPG ESPS was 31 March 2007. This has been updated as at 
31 December 2010 to reflect relevant changes in assumptions. The principal assumptions were as follows:

The mortality assumptions are based on standard mortality tables which allow for future mortality improvements. The assumptions 
are that a member who retired in 2010 at age 60 will live on average for a further 26 years (2009: 25 years) after retirement if they 
are male, and for a further 28 years (2009: 27 years) after retirement if they are female. Similarly life expectancy at age 60 for 
male and female non-pensioners (currently aged 45) is assumed to be 27 years and 29 years respectively (2009: 27 years and 
28 years respectively).

The pension plan assets do not include any ordinary shares issued by Drax Group plc or any property occupied by the Group. 
The Group employs a building block approach in determining the long-term rate of return on pension plan assets. Historical markets 
are studied and assets with higher volatility are assumed to generate higher returns consistent with widely accepted capital market 
principles. The overall expected rate of return on assets is then derived by aggregating the expected return for each asset class 
over the actual asset allocation for the scheme. 
The net liability recognised in the balance sheet is particularly sensitive to the discount rate assumption, which is determined by 
reference to market yields at the balance sheet date on high quality corporate bonds, allowing for the duration of the scheme’s 
liabilities. Recent volatility in financial markets has caused the range of yields on corporate bonds to widen significantly. It is 
estimated that an increase of 0.5% in the discount rate would have the effect of decreasing the net liability recognised in the 
balance sheet by approximately £15 million (2009: £14 million) and a decrease of 0.5% in the discount rate would increase the 
net liability recognised in the balance sheet by £17 million (2009: £16 million).

preparation is applicable law and United Kingdom Accounting Standards (United Kingdom Generally Accepted Accounting Practice). 
This report is made solely to the Company’s members, as a body, in accordance with Chapter 3 of Part 16 of the Companies Act 
2006. Our audit work has been undertaken so that we might state to the Company’s members those matters we are required to 
state to them in an auditor’s report and for no other purpose. To the fullest extent permitted by law, we do not accept or assume 
responsibility to anyone other than the Company and the Company’s members as a body, for our audit work, for this report, or for 
the opinions we have formed. 
Respective responsibilities of directors and auditor 
As explained more fully in the Directors’ responsibilities statement, the directors are responsible for the preparation of the parent 
Company financial statements and for being satisfied that they give a true and fair view. Our responsibility is to audit and express an 
opinion on the parent Company financial statements in accordance with applicable law and International Standards on Auditing (UK 
and Ireland). Those standards require us to comply with the Auditing Practices Board’s Ethical Standards for Auditors. 
Scope of the audit of the financial statements 
An audit involves obtaining evidence about the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements sufficient to give reasonable 
assurance that the financial statements are free from material misstatement, whether caused by fraud or error. This includes an 
assessment of: whether the accounting policies are appropriate to the parent Company’s circumstances and have been consistently 
applied and adequately disclosed; the reasonableness of significant accounting estimates made by the directors; and the overall 
presentation of the financial statements. 
Opinion on financial statements 
In our opinion the parent Company financial statements: 
− give a true and fair view of the state of the parent Company’s affairs as at 31 December 2010; 
− have been properly prepared in accordance with United Kingdom Generally Accepted Accounting Practice; and 
− have been prepared in accordance with the requirements of the Companies Act 2006. 
Opinion on other matters prescribed by the Companies Act 2006 
In our opinion: 
− the part of the Directors’ remuneration report to be audited has been properly prepared in accordance with the Companies Act 
2006; and 
− the information given in the Directors’ report for the financial year for which the financial statements are prepared is consistent 
with the parent Company financial statements. 
Matters on which we are required to report by exception 
We have nothing to report in respect of the following matters where the Companies Act 2006 requires us to report to you if, in 
our opinion: 
− adequate accounting records have not been kept by the parent Company, or returns adequate for our audit have not been 
received from branches not visited by us; or 
− the parent Company financial statements and the part of the Directors’ remuneration report to be audited are not in agreement 
with the accounting records and returns; or 
− certain disclosures of directors’ remuneration specified by law are not made; or 
− we have not received all the information and explanations we require for our audit. 
Other matters 
We have reported separately on the Group financial statements of Drax Group plc for the year ended 31 December 2010.
