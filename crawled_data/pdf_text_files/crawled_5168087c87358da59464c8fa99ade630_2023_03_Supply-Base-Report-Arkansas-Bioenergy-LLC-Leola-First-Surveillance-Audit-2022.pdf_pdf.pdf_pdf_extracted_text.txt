Description of countries included in the Supply Base
Country:United States
Area/Region: ARBE Leola, under most circumstances, only procures fiber from Arkansas. Under the 
consolidated Supply Base, which includes all Drax plants in the southern US, all of Arkansas, Louisiana, 
Mississippi, Alabama, Georgia, North Carolina, South Carolina, Tennessee, Kentucky, and portions of Texas, 
Florida, and Oklahoma are also technically in scope.

Drax fiber procurement catchment includes Arkansas, Louisiana, Mississippi, Alabama, Georgia, North 
Carolina, South Carolina, Tennessee, Kentucky, and portions of Texas (59 counties), Florida (28 counties),
and Oklahoma (32 counties). See map of supply area below. The Company owns and operates five 
primary pellet plants: Amite Bioenergy Gloster, MS; Morehouse Bioenergy near Beekman, LA, LaSalle 
Bioenergy in Urania, LA; Alabama Pellets in Aliceville, and Demopolis, AL. Drax also owns and operates 
two satellite plants: Arkansas Bioenergy Leola, Arkansas Bioenergy Russellville. Each primary plant 
typically draws feedstock from within a 70-mile radius but maintains the ability to procure out to a 100-mile 
radius to obtain primary feedstock in response to market pressures and weather events. However, 
secondary feedstocks produced by forest product manufactures could be procured from as far away as 
200 miles and tertiary material (residuals from secondary manufacturing of lumber) could be procured 
anywhere within the supply are depicted on map below. Each satellite plant will obtain feedstock from the 
secondary material produced by the forest products manufacturer that is adjacent to the facility.

Quantification of the Supply Base
Supply Base
a.
Total Supply Base area (million ha): 6,85
b.
Tenure by type (million ha):4.13 (Privately owned), 0.97 (Public)
c.
Forest by type (million ha):5.10 (Temperate)
d.
Forest by management type (million ha):1.58 (Plantation), 2.60 (Managed natural), 0.92 (Natural)
e.
Certified forest by scheme (million ha):0.00 (Other)
Describe the harvesting type which best describes how your material is sourced: Mix of the above
Explanation: Sawtimber can be harvested from a clearcuts but also from older thinnings.  Shavings are 
derived from sawtimber.
Was the forest in the Supply Base managed for a purpose other than for energy markets? Yes - 
Majority
Explanation: Timber is managed primarily to produce solid wood products. 
For the forests in the Supply Base, is there an intention to retain, restock or encourage natural 
regeneration within 5 years of felling? Yes - Majority
Explanation: Replanting is standard practice when pine stands are harvested.  Hardwood and mixed stands
are regenerated through natural regeneration.  The forests in this region are low-risk for conversion out of 
forest.
Was the feedstock used in the biomass removed from a forest as part of a pest/disease control 
measure or a salvage operation? No
Explanation: Shavings are derived from sawing and manufacturing high-quality sawtimber which is 
generally not diseased or from salvage operations.

Mitigation measure:
The FSC US National Risk assessment has identified ten “specified risks” 
within Drax’s sourcing area that pertain to species and ecological 
communities. They include Native Longleaf Pine Systems, Late 
Successional Bottomland Hardwoods, Dusky Gopher Frog, Southern 
Appalachian Critical Biodiversity Area, Central Appalachian Critical 
Biodiversity Area, Cape Fear Arch Critical Biodiversity Area, Florida 
Panhandle Critical Biodiversity Area, Cheoah Bald Salamander, Patch 
Nose Salamander, and Mesophytic Cove Sites. 
Drax applies FSC approved mandatory Control Measures and approved 
mitigations to manage these risks.  Control Measures are defined in the 
FSC US Controlled Wood National Risk Assessment.  As specified by the
mandatory Control Measures, Drax implements mitigation actions 
identified during the collaborative dialogue at the Controlled Wood 
Regional Meetings and detailed in the Controlled Wood Regional Meeting
Report, available at: https://us.fsc.org/en-us/certification/controlled-
wood/fsc-us-controlled-wood-national-risk-assessment-us-nra.

Drax implements the mandatory Control Measure 3.1 for Category 3 
specified risks (defined in the FSC US Controlled Wood National Risk 
Assessment).  As specified by the mandatory Control Measure, Drax 
implements mitigation actions identified during the collaborative dialogue 
at the Controlled Wood Regional Meetings and detailed in the Controlled 
Wood Regional Meeting Report, available at: https://us.fsc.org/en-
us/certification/controlled-wood/fsc-us-controlled-wood-national-risk-
assessment-us-nra.
 
 
Drax’s procedures and mitigation approach is somewhat different for 
primary and secondary feedstock sourcing.  
 
Procedures and Mitigation Actions: Primary Feedstock Sourcing
Only two of the specified risks are relevant to Drax’s primary sourcing of 
roundwood and in-woods chips, Native Longleaf Pine Systems (NLPS), 
and Late Successional Bottomland Hardwoods (LSBH).
Native Longleaf Pine Systems (Primary)
NLPS are described as “fire-dependent systems include longleaf pine as 
the dominant tree, a conspicuous lack of mid-story trees and shrubs, and 
a well-developed, diverse ground layer (dominated by bunch grasses and
other flowering plants)”.  In the Drax primary supply areas existing NLPS 
are not at significant risk   because the vast majority:
1.     are managed to maintain and perpetuate these systems, and 
2.     are owned by federal or state agencies and conservation-oriented 
organizations with the mandate and means to implement conservation-
forestry practices.
 
Late Successional Bottomland Hardwoods  (Primary)
LSBH is a very small risk due to the fact that Drax sources primarily 
southern yellow pine, with a de minimis amount (chip content is 
estimated as 0.26 % hardwood) of in-woods chip material which may 
contain hardwood.  Low level mitigation is deemed appropriate
*Note - a further safeguard for the protection of LSBH is the commitment 
that Drax has made to not utilize material from cypress tupelo 
ecosystems in the production of wood pellets.
Drax Practices to Avoid Harm and Mitigate Risk in Primary Sourcing
Current procurement procedures and processes mitigate the risk of 
sourcing fiber in a manner that would threaten NLPS and LSBH forests 
(FSC CENTRAL THEME: Procurement Policy).  These primary feedstock
controls, embedded in Drax’s internal processes, are subject to 
monitoring and internal audit.  Drax has integrated the FSC HCV maps 
into its GIS system and Rapid Risk Assessment process and actively 
screens all tracts for sensitivities.  In addition, Drax requires 
comprehensive forest cover type and species information be provided 
during source set-up which allows stands to be assessed for the potential
of sourcing from longleaf pine or hardwood systems.  If a risk is identified,
then Drax has an opportunity provide educational mitigation materials 
and to identify management requirements which will protect the integrity 
of the system (CENTRAL THEME: Education & Outreach).  Drax also 
reserves the right to refuse purchase of fiber if the harvesting method 
and/or the subsequent management plans will threaten the integrity of 
these high conservation value forests (FSC CENTRAL THEME: 
Procurement Policy). 
 
Procedures and Mitigation Actions: Secondary Feedstock Sourcing
Drax does not have line of sight to individual tracts that provide fiber to 
secondary and tertiary feedstock suppliers, therefore the following 
mitigations will be applied:
Native Longleaf Pine Systems (Secondary)
For NLPS, 78% of the risk area mapped by FSC is within the Drax supply
base.  That percentage is reduced to 41% when the sourcing 
characteristics of the actual ranges of current secondary and tertiary 
suppliers is considered. Low level mitigation is deemed appropriate.
The areas at risk have been identified by FSC at county/parish level.  
Education and outreach will be the main method of mitigation for residual 
suppliers who’s sourcing area intersects FSC identified risk areas.  The 
desired outcome of these communications is engaging landowners, 
foresters, and loggers in conservation of Native Longleaf Pine systems.   
 
FSC CENTRAL THEME: Education & Outreach is the primary mitigation 
option.  Drax has engaged the Longleaf Alliance in the development of 
educational materials.  Drax also supports the annual Longleaf Alliance 
conference.  The areas that potentially have NLPS have been mapped by
FSC and integrated into Drax’s GIS system.  Educational materials are 
distributed to suppliers that touch identified specified risk areas.  
Educational materials have been developed to engage landowners, 
foresters, and loggers in conservation of this forest system. Drax also 
actively supports workshops and learning exchanges focused on 
encouraging proactive management of longleaf pine in the supply area. 
Plans are to distribute additional educational materials the Longleaf 
Alliance has already developed and investigate other opportunities for 
engaging in regional LL conservation initiatives including landowner 
workshops. 
Late Successional Bottomland Hardwoods (Secondary)
FSC CENTRAL THEME: Education & Outreach is the primary mitigation 
option.  As Drax primarily sources southern yellow pine, Late 
Successional Bottomland Hardwoods are mainly an issue for residual 
suppliers who process hardwoods and are proximate to LSBH areas. The
areas that potentially have NLPS have been mapped by FSC and 
integrated into Drax’s GIS system.  Educational materials, developed in 
partnership with the Forest Stewards Guild, are distributed to suppliers 
that touch identified specified risk areas. Educational materials have 
been developed to engage landowners, foresters, and loggers in 
conservation of this forest system. Drax also actively supports Forest 
Stewards Guild workshops and learning exchanges focused on improving
the management of bottomland hardwoods and helps fund the 
development of management plans for private landowners.  
Dusky Gopher Frog Critical Habitat (Secondary)
FSC CENTRAL THEME: Education & Outreach is the primary mitigation 
option.  FSC identifies two small areas at the extreme south of Drax’s 
sourcing area which are only of relevance to residual sourcing.  These 
areas are under Federal Critical Habitat protections.  FSC has identified 
education and outreach as a mitigation option for the DGF. Drax has only 
four suppliers having this risk within their potential sourcing area.  Drax 
provides educational materials developed by the USFWS to the suppliers
which have the potential to source from the FSC identified risk areas.  
Educational materials are informed by the best available science and 
adapted as new information and/or approaches become available. The 
desired outcome of these communications is engaging landowners, 
foresters, and loggers in conservation of DGF populations. 
Southern Appalachian Critical Biodiversity Area (Secondary)
Central Appalachian Critical Biodiversity Area (Secondary)
Mesophytic Cove Sites  (Secondary)
Drax’s source area overlap with these three somewhat similar FSC risk 
types varies greatly.

Drax recognizes the Central and Critical Biodiversity Areas and 
Mesophytic Cove Sites as specified risks within the wider supply area.  
The Central Appalachian CBA and the Mesophytic Cove specified risks 
are at the edges of Drax residual sourcing area, and thus pose a very low
risk.  Education and outreach is the mitigation tool employed (FSC 
CENTRAL THEME: Education & Outreach).  As described for the risks 
above, these materials have been developed according to best available 
science and be adapted as new information and approaches come 
available (i.e., through FSC CW Regional meetings).   This educational 
material is aimed at increasing awareness of the sensitivities and unique 
nature of these CBAs and cove sites in hopes of increasing conservation 
of these highly biodiverse areas. The Southern Appalachian CBA poses a
medium risk with the acquisition of the Alabama Pellet Plants therefore, 
Drax is adding Conservation Initiatives (FSC CENTRAL THEME: 
Conservation Initiatives) to the educational and outreach materials 
mentioned above to the mitigation tools to be employed for this specified 
risk.
Cape Fear Arch Critical Biodiversity Area  (Secondary)Drax 
recognizes the Cape Fear Arch Critical Biodiversity Area as specified risk 
within the wider supply area.  This specified risk comprises a small region
in the Drax residual sourcing area. Although 100% of the risk area 
mapped by FSC is within the Drax supply base, that percentage is 
reduced to 0% when the sourcing characteristics of the actual ranges of 
current secondary and tertiary suppliers is considered. Low level 
mitigation is deemed appropriate. 
The primary concerns are for Pocosins and for longleaf pine habitats.  
Both have widespread protections or conservation measures in place, 
and thus pose a very low risk.  Pocosins are a wetland type that is 
protected by BMPs.  Longleaf pine is subject to a widespread and 
increasingly effective landscape conservation movement.  To further 
support these positive factors Drax has selected Education and outreach 
are the mitigation tool (FSC CENTRAL THEME: Education & Outreach) 
to address this risk if sourcing begins in this area.  As described for the 
risks above, these materials have been developed according to best 
available science and be adapted as new information and approaches 
come available (i.e., through FSC CW Regional meetings).  This 
educational material is aimed at increasing awareness of the sensitivities 
and unique nature of these CBAs in hopes of increasing conservation of 
these highly biodiverse areas.
Florida Panhandle Critical Biodiversity Area  (Secondary)
Drax recognizes the Florida Panhandle Critical Biodiversity Area as 
specified risk within the wider supply area.  Although 100% of the risk 
area mapped by FSC is within the Drax supply base, that percentage is 
reduced to <1% when the sourcing characteristics of the actual ranges of
current secondary and tertiary suppliers is considered. Many of the 
biodiversity elements are already protected by BMPs or by the Longleaf 
Pine conservation efforts previously described.

(particularly the Apalachicola River), longleaf pine savanna habitat and 
unique steephead ravines.” Source: FSC US Controlled Wood Regional 
Meeting Report. Southeast & Mississippi Alluvial Valley Regions. Atlanta, 
GA.  July 31, 2018.To further support these positive factors Drax has 
selected FSC CENTRAL THEME Education & Outreach as the mitigation
tool to address this risk if sourcing begins in this area.  As described for 
the risks above, these materials have been developed according to best 
available science and be adapted as new information and approaches 
come available (i.e., through FSC CW Regional meetings).  This 
educational material is aimed at increasing awareness of the sensitivities 
and unique nature of these CBAs in hopes of increasing conservation of 
these highly biodiverse areas.
Cheoah Bald Salamander  (Secondary)
Drax recognizes the Cheoah Bald Salamander as specified risk within the
wider supply area.  This salamander is known to exist only on Federal 
land at the extreme edges of Drax residual sourcing area, and thus pose 
a very low risk.  Drax has selected FSC CENTRAL THEME Education & 
Outreach as the mitigation tool employed.  As described for the risks 
above, these materials have been developed according to best available 
science and be adapted as new information and approaches come 
available (i.e., through FSC CW Regional meetings).  This educational 
material is aimed at increasing awareness of the sensitivities and unique 
nature of this species.
Patch-nosed Salamander (Secondary)
Drax recognizes the Patch-nosed Salamander as specified risk within the
wider supply area.  Although 100% of the risk area mapped by FSC is 
within the Drax supply base, that percentage is reduced to <1% when the
sourcing characteristics of the actual ranges of current secondary and 
tertiary suppliers is considered. This salamander is known to exist only in 
a small portion (about 5,000 acres) of several counties of the Drax 
residual sourcing area.  The salamander is known to inhabit small 
streams in narrow, steep-walled ravines.  Because these sites are 
protected by BMPs and not likely to be impacted by logging there is a 
very low risk.  Drax has selected FSC CENTRAL THEME Education & 
Outreach as the mitigation tool employed.   As described for the risks 
above, these materials have been developed according to best available 
science and be adapted as new information and approaches come 
available (i.e., through FSC CW Regional meetings).  This educational 
material is aimed at increasing awareness of the sensitivities and unique 
nature of this species.
 
The mitigations described above are sufficient to bring the risk of non-
compliance with this requirement to “low”.

Drax implements the mandatory Control Measure 3.1 for Category 3 
specified risks.  This Control Measures is defined in the FSC US 
Controlled Wood National Risk Assessment (Appendix B of this 
document).  As specified by the mandatory Control Measure, Drax 
implements mitigation actions identified during the collaborative dialogue 
at the Controlled Wood Regional Meetings and detailed in the Controlled 
Wood Regional Meeting Report, available at: https://us.fsc.org/en-
us/certification/controlled-wood/fsc-us-controlled-wood-national-risk-

Procedures and Mitigation Actions: Primary Feedstock Sourcing
Only two of the specified risks are relevant to Drax’s primary sourcing of 
roundwood and in-woods chips, Native Longleaf Pine Systems (NLPS), 
and Late Successional Bottomland Hardwoods (LSBH).
Native Longleaf Pine Systems (Primary)
NLPS are described as “fire-dependent systems include longleaf pine as 
the dominant tree, a conspicuous lack of mid-story trees and shrubs, and 
a well-developed, diverse ground layer (dominated by bunch grasses and
other flowering plants)”.  In the Drax primary supply areas existing NLPS 
are not at significant risk   because the vast majority:
1.     are managed to maintain and perpetuate these systems, and 
2.     are owned by federal or state agencies and conservation-oriented 
organizations with the mandate and means to implement conservation-
forestry practices.
 
Late Successional Bottomland Hardwoods  (Primary)
LSBH is a very small risk due to the fact that Drax sources primarily 
southern yellow pine, with a de minimis amount (chip content is 
estimated as 0.26 % hardwood) of in-woods chip material which may 
contain hardwood.  Low level mitigation is deemed appropriate
*Note - a further safeguard for the protection of LSBH is the commitment 
that Drax has made to not utilize material from cypress tupelo 
ecosystems in the production of wood pellets.

Drax’s procedures and mitigation approach is somewhat different for 
primary and secondary feedstock sourcing.  
 
Procedures and Mitigation Actions: Primary Feedstock Sourcing
Only two of the specified risks are relevant to Drax’s primary sourcing of 
roundwood and in-woods chips, Native Longleaf Pine Systems (NLPS), 
and Late Successional Bottomland Hardwoods (LSBH).
Native Longleaf Pine Systems (Primary)
NLPS are described as “fire-dependent systems include longleaf pine as 
the dominant tree, a conspicuous lack of mid-story trees and shrubs, and 
a well-developed, diverse ground layer (dominated by bunch grasses and
other flowering plants)”.  In the Drax primary supply areas existing NLPS 
are not at significant risk   because the vast majority:
1.     are managed to maintain and perpetuate these systems, and 
2.     are owned by federal or state agencies and conservation-oriented 
organizations with the mandate and means to implement conservation-
forestry practices.
 
Late Successional Bottomland Hardwoods  (Primary)
LSBH is a very small risk due to the fact that Drax sources primarily 
southern yellow pine, with a de minimis amount (chip content is 
estimated as 0.26 % hardwood) of in-woods chip material which may 
contain hardwood.  Low level mitigation is deemed appropriate
*Note - a further safeguard for the protection of LSBH is the commitment 
that Drax has made to not utilize material from cypress tupelo 
ecosystems in the production of wood pellets.
Drax Practices to Avoid Harm and Mitigate Risk in Primary Sourcing
Current procurement procedures and processes mitigate the risk of 
sourcing fiber in a manner that would threaten NLPS and LSBH forests 
(FSC CENTRAL THEME: Procurement Policy).  These primary feedstock
controls, embedded in Drax’s internal processes, are subject to 
monitoring and internal audit.  Drax has integrated the FSC HCV maps 
into its GIS system and Rapid Risk Assessment process and actively 
screens all tracts for sensitivities.  In addition, Drax requires 
comprehensive forest cover type and species information be provided 
during source set-up which allows stands to be assessed for the potential
of sourcing from longleaf pine or hardwood systems.  If a risk is identified,
then Drax has an opportunity provide educational mitigation materials 
and to identify management requirements which will protect the integrity 
of the system (CENTRAL THEME: Education & Outreach).  Drax also 
reserves the right to refuse purchase of fiber if the harvesting method 
and/or the subsequent management plans will threaten the integrity of 
these high conservation value forests (FSC CENTRAL THEME: 
Procurement Policy). 
 
Procedures and Mitigation Actions: Secondary Feedstock Sourcing
Drax does not have line of sight to individual tracts that provide fiber to 
secondary and tertiary feedstock suppliers, therefore the following 
mitigations will be applied:
Native Longleaf Pine Systems (Secondary)
For NLPS, 78% of the risk area mapped by FSC is within the Drax supply
base.  That percentage is reduced to 41% when the sourcing 
characteristics of the actual ranges of current secondary and tertiary 
suppliers is considered. Low level mitigation is deemed appropriate.
The areas at risk have been identified by FSC at county/parish level.  
Education and outreach will be the main method of mitigation for residual 
suppliers who’s sourcing area intersects FSC identified risk areas.  The 
desired outcome of these communications is engaging landowners, 
foresters, and loggers in conservation of Native Longleaf Pine systems.   
 
FSC CENTRAL THEME: Education & Outreach is the primary mitigation 
option.  Drax has engaged the Longleaf Alliance in the development of 
educational materials.  Drax also supports the annual Longleaf Alliance 
conference.  The areas that potentially have NLPS have been mapped by
FSC and integrated into Drax’s GIS system.  Educational materials are 
distributed to suppliers that touch identified specified risk areas.  
Educational materials have been developed to engage landowners, 
foresters, and loggers in conservation of this forest system. Drax also 
actively supports workshops and learning exchanges focused on 
encouraging proactive management of longleaf pine in the supply area. 
Plans are to distribute additional educational materials the Longleaf 
Alliance has already developed and investigate other opportunities for 
engaging in regional LL conservation initiatives including landowner 
workshops. 
Late Successional Bottomland Hardwoods (Secondary)
FSC CENTRAL THEME: Education & Outreach is the primary mitigation 
option.  As Drax primarily sources southern yellow pine, Late 
Successional Bottomland Hardwoods are mainly an issue for residual 
suppliers who process hardwoods and are proximate to LSBH areas. The
areas that potentially have NLPS have been mapped by FSC and 
integrated into Drax’s GIS system.  Educational materials, developed in 
partnership with the Forest Stewards Guild, are distributed to suppliers 
that touch identified specified risk areas. Educational materials have 
been developed to engage landowners, foresters, and loggers in 
conservation of this forest system. Drax also actively supports Forest 
Stewards Guild workshops and learning exchanges focused on improving
the management of bottomland hardwoods and helps fund the 
development of management plans for private landowners.  
Dusky Gopher Frog Critical Habitat (Secondary)
FSC CENTRAL THEME: Education & Outreach is the primary mitigation 
option.  FSC identifies two small areas at the extreme south of Drax’s 
sourcing area which are only of relevance to residual sourcing.  These 
areas are under Federal Critical Habitat protections.  FSC has identified 
education and outreach as a mitigation option for the DGF. Drax has only 
four suppliers having this risk within their potential sourcing area.  Drax 
provides educational materials developed by the USFWS to the suppliers
which have the potential to source from the FSC identified risk areas.  
Educational materials are informed by the best available science and 
adapted as new information and/or approaches become available. The 
desired outcome of these communications is engaging landowners, 
foresters, and loggers in conservation of DGF populations. 
Southern Appalachian Critical Biodiversity Area (Secondary)

Drax recognizes the Central and Critical Biodiversity Areas and 
Mesophytic Cove Sites as specified risks within the wider supply area.  
The Central Appalachian CBA and the Mesophytic Cove specified risks 
are at the edges of Drax residual sourcing area, and thus pose a very low
risk.  Education and outreach is the mitigation tool employed (FSC 
CENTRAL THEME: Education & Outreach).  As described for the risks 
above, these materials have been developed according to best available 
science and be adapted as new information and approaches come 
available (i.e., through FSC CW Regional meetings).   This educational 
material is aimed at increasing awareness of the sensitivities and unique 
nature of these CBAs and cove sites in hopes of increasing conservation 
of these highly biodiverse areas. The Southern Appalachian CBA poses a
medium risk with the acquisition of the Alabama Pellet Plants therefore, 
Drax is adding Conservation Initiatives (FSC CENTRAL THEME: 
Conservation Initiatives) to the educational and outreach materials 
mentioned above to the mitigation tools to be employed for this specified 
risk.
Cape Fear Arch Critical Biodiversity Area  (Secondary)Drax 
recognizes the Cape Fear Arch Critical Biodiversity Area as specified risk 
within the wider supply area.  This specified risk comprises a small region
in the Drax residual sourcing area. Although 100% of the risk area 
mapped by FSC is within the Drax supply base, that percentage is 
reduced to 0% when the sourcing characteristics of the actual ranges of 
current secondary and tertiary suppliers is considered. Low level 
mitigation is deemed appropriate. 
The primary concerns are for Pocosins and for longleaf pine habitats.  
Both have widespread protections or conservation measures in place, 
and thus pose a very low risk.  Pocosins are a wetland type that is 
protected by BMPs.  Longleaf pine is subject to a widespread and 
increasingly effective landscape conservation movement.  To further 
support these positive factors Drax has selected Education and outreach 
are the mitigation tool (FSC CENTRAL THEME: Education & Outreach) 
to address this risk if sourcing begins in this area.  As described for the 
risks above, these materials have been developed according to best 
available science and be adapted as new information and approaches 
come available (i.e., through FSC CW Regional meetings).  This 
educational material is aimed at increasing awareness of the sensitivities 
and unique nature of these CBAs in hopes of increasing conservation of 
these highly biodiverse areas.
Florida Panhandle Critical Biodiversity Area  (Secondary)
Drax recognizes the Florida Panhandle Critical Biodiversity Area as 
specified risk within the wider supply area.  Although 100% of the risk 
area mapped by FSC is within the Drax supply base, that percentage is 
reduced to <1% when the sourcing characteristics of the actual ranges of
current secondary and tertiary suppliers is considered. Many of the 
biodiversity elements are already protected by BMPs or by the Longleaf 
Pine conservation efforts previously described.

(particularly the Apalachicola River), longleaf pine savanna habitat and 
unique steephead ravines.” Source: FSC US Controlled Wood Regional 
Meeting Report. Southeast & Mississippi Alluvial Valley Regions. Atlanta, 
GA.  July 31, 2018.To further support these positive factors Drax has 
selected FSC CENTRAL THEME Education & Outreach as the mitigation
tool to address this risk if sourcing begins in this area.  As described for 
the risks above, these materials have been developed according to best 
available science and be adapted as new information and approaches 
come available (i.e., through FSC CW Regional meetings).  This 
educational material is aimed at increasing awareness of the sensitivities 
and unique nature of these CBAs in hopes of increasing conservation of 
these highly biodiverse areas.
Cheoah Bald Salamander  (Secondary)
Drax recognizes the Cheoah Bald Salamander as specified risk within the
wider supply area.  This salamander is known to exist only on Federal 
land at the extreme edges of Drax residual sourcing area, and thus pose 
a very low risk.  Drax has selected FSC CENTRAL THEME Education & 
Outreach as the mitigation tool employed.  As described for the risks 
above, these materials have been developed according to best available 
science and be adapted as new information and approaches come 
available (i.e., through FSC CW Regional meetings).  This educational 
material is aimed at increasing awareness of the sensitivities and unique 
nature of this species.
Patch-nosed Salamander (Secondary)
Drax recognizes the Patch-nosed Salamander as specified risk within the
wider supply area.  Although 100% of the risk area mapped by FSC is 
within the Drax supply base, that percentage is reduced to <1% when the
sourcing characteristics of the actual ranges of current secondary and 
tertiary suppliers is considered. This salamander is known to exist only in 
a small portion (about 5,000 acres) of several counties of the Drax 
residual sourcing area.  The salamander is known to inhabit small 
streams in narrow, steep-walled ravines.  Because these sites are 
protected by BMPs and not likely to be impacted by logging there is a 
very low risk.  Drax has selected FSC CENTRAL THEME Education & 
Outreach as the mitigation tool employed.   As described for the risks 
above, these materials have been developed according to best available 
science and be adapted as new information and approaches come 
available (i.e., through FSC CW Regional meetings).  This educational 
material is aimed at increasing awareness of the sensitivities and unique 
nature of this species.
 
The mitigations described above are sufficient to bring the risk of non-
compliance with this requirement to “low”.

Drax implements the mandatory Control Measure 3.1 for Category 3 
specified risks.  This Control Measures is defined in the FSC US 
Controlled Wood National Risk Assessment (Appendix B of this 
document).  As specified by the mandatory Control Measure, Drax 
implements mitigation actions identified during the collaborative dialogue 
at the Controlled Wood Regional Meetings and detailed in the Controlled 
Wood Regional Meeting Report, available at: https://us.fsc.org/en-
us/certification/controlled-wood/fsc-us-controlled-wood-national-risk-
assessment-us-nra.
Procedures and Mitigation Actions: Primary Feedstock Sourcing
Only two of the specified risks are relevant to Drax’s primary sourcing of 
roundwood and in-woods chips, Native Longleaf Pine Systems (NLPS), 
and Late Successional Bottomland Hardwoods (LSBH).
Native Longleaf Pine Systems (Primary)
NLPS are described as “fire-dependent systems include longleaf pine as 
the dominant tree, a conspicuous lack of mid-story trees and shrubs, and 
a well-developed, diverse ground layer (dominated by bunch grasses and
other flowering plants)”.  In the Drax primary supply areas existing NLPS 
are not at significant risk   because the vast majority:
1.     are managed to maintain and perpetuate these systems, and 
2.     are owned by federal or state agencies and conservation-oriented 
organizations with the mandate and means to implement conservation-
forestry practices.
 
Late Successional Bottomland Hardwoods  (Primary)
LSBH is a very small risk due to the fact that Drax sources primarily 
southern yellow pine, with a de minimis amount (chip content is 
estimated as 0.26 % hardwood) of in-woods chip material which may 
contain hardwood.  Low level mitigation is deemed appropriate
*Note - a further safeguard for the protection of LSBH is the commitment 
that Drax has made to not utilize material from cypress tupelo 
ecosystems in the production of wood pellets.
Drax Practices to Avoid Harm and Mitigate Risk in Primary Sourcing
Current procurement procedures and processes mitigate the risk of 
sourcing fiber in a manner that would threaten NLPS and LSBH forests 
(FSC CENTRAL THEME: Procurement Policy).  These primary feedstock
controls, embedded in Drax’s internal processes, are subject to 
monitoring and internal audit.  Drax has integrated the FSC HCV maps 
into its GIS system and Rapid Risk Assessment process and actively 
screens all tracts for sensitivities.  In addition, Drax requires 
comprehensive forest cover type and species information be provided 
during source set-up which allows stands to be assessed for the potential
of sourcing from longleaf pine or hardwood systems.  If a risk is identified,
then Drax has an opportunity provide educational mitigation materials 
and to identify management requirements which will protect the integrity 
of the system (CENTRAL THEME: Education & Outreach).  Drax also 
reserves the right to refuse purchase of fiber if the harvesting method 
and/or the subsequent management plans will threaten the integrity of 
these high conservation value forests (FSC CENTRAL THEME: 
Procurement Policy). 
 
Procedures and Mitigation Actions: Secondary Feedstock Sourcing
Drax does not have line of sight to individual tracts that provide fiber to 
secondary and tertiary feedstock suppliers, therefore the following 
mitigations will be applied:

Mitigation measure:
To mitigate the potential for conversion risk in some (FSC identified) 
counties at the perimeter of its sourcing area, Drax applies FSC 
CENTRAL THEME: Procurement Policy and FSC CENTRAL THEME 
Education & Outreach to mitigate conversion risk.  All supply contracts 
specify that wood from conversion sources is unacceptable and all 
suppliers that have the potential to source from FSC identified conversion
risk areas are provided with educational materials.  The desired outcome 
of the educational material is to help support and encouraging 
landowners in their efforts to keep their forests as forests.
For reference the following excerpt from FSC US Controlled Wood 
Regional Meeting Report is provided: ATLANTA 4/8/19 48: 
“The following is offered as an option that could be scaled for any level of
mitigation: Using materials as described below, communicate to 
audiences (also described below) the social benefits of keeping forests 
as forests, and the value-enhancing alternatives to conversion and 
opportunities for the maintenance of forests (e.g., tax-relief programs, 
succession planning). The desired outcome of these communications is 
engaging landowners within the specified risk area and the 
Organization’s supply area in the maintenance of forests.
Audiences: Communications are directed toward audiences where there 
is a proven or reasonable expectation of effectiveness in achieving the 
above defined desired outcome. Depending upon the Organization’s 
location in the supply chain, communications may be directly with 
landowners, foresters, or loggers, or through intermediaries such as 
community members, forest managers, suppliers, forestry associations or
landowner associations, or through collaboration with 
organizations/individuals already working for maintenance of forests. 
INTENT: The intent of this mitigation option is to implement education 
and outreach-related actions that will result in maintenance of forests, 
and thereby mitigate the risk of sourcing materials from sites in the 
specified risk area where the forest is being converted to non-forest use. “

Indicator
1.1.1
The BP Supply Base is defined and mapped.
Finding
Drax fiber procurement catchment includes Arkansas, Louisiana, Mississippi, 
Alabama, Georgia, North Carolina, South Carolina, Tennessee, Kentucky, and 
portions of Texas (59 counties), Florida (28 counties), and Oklahoma (32 counties). 
See map of supply area below. The Company owns and operates five primary pellet 
plants: Amite Bioenergy Gloster, MS; Morehouse Bioenergy near Beekman, LA, 
LaSalle Bioenergy in Urania, LA; Alabama Pellets in Aliceville, and Demopolis, AL. 
Drax also owns and operates two satellite plants: Arkansas Bioenergy Leola, 
Arkansas Bioenergy Russellville. Each primary plant typically draws feedstock from 
within a 70-mile radius but maintains the ability to procure out to a 100-mile radius to 
obtain primary feedstock in response to market pressures and weather events. 
However, secondary feedstocks produced by forest product manufactures could be 
procured from as far away as 200 miles and tertiary material (residuals from 
secondary manufacturing of lumber) could be procured anywhere within the supply 
are depicted on map below. Each satellite plant will obtain feedstock from the 
secondary material produced by the forest products manufacturer that is adjacent to 
the facility.

Feedstock can be traced back to the defined Supply Base.
Finding
A map of Drax’s sourcing area forms part of Drax’s contract with suppliers.
·         Binding contractual requirements stipulate that suppliers disclose the source’s 
origination information (lat/long) to establish a gate pass before loads of roundwood 
or in-woods chips enter mill sites. 
·         Robust transaction accounting system captures sustainability characteristics 
about the source upon establishment and assigns relational information to each load 
registered upon delivery. 
o    Transaction accounting system captures location, type of cut and species groups 
and other information. 
o    Control points are established, and training is completed to ensure only sources 
of known origin enter mill sites.
o    Monitoring by procurement and sustainability staff verify accuracy of records and 
locations of tracts.
·         Drax holds verified SFI®, PEFC™ and FSC® CoC Certificates substantiating 
that all feedstock is assessed for risk via a Due Diligence System (DDS).
·         Majority of feedstock inputs are from primary sources with a growing 
proportion from secondary sources.
·         Suppliers of secondary and tertiary feedstocks have contractual requirements 
to confirm that their feedstock originates within Drax’s defined catchment. This is 
checked through internal procedures at Drax, including logical haul radius regular 
communication with secondary and tertiary suppliers, and internal audit
Means of
Verification
·         Transactional accounting system hold details of volumes, species, and 
locations.
·         Professional fiber procurement and sustainability personnel
·         Third party audits of sustainability program evidence the presence of a 
functioning supply chain management system that complies with the legal 
requirements to track and trace raw material. 
·         Administrative processes and fiduciary responsibilities to tax law have been 
defined and implemented. These require business to identify and capture the district 
of origin of fiber that enable states to assign and collect severance taxes. 
·         See Preamble citations, including Worldwide Governance Indicators
·         Forest Property Taxation Systems in the United States: Each jurisdiction has 
its own version of record retention and/or payment periods for timber purchases.

The feedstock input profile is described and categorised by the mix of inputs.
Finding
• Drax's suppliers source biomass feedstock comprised of low value roundwood, 
thinnings, tops, logging residues and mill residues from southern yellow pine (SYP) 
species, with minority components of mixed southern hardwoods.
• Binding contractual requirements stipulate that suppliers disclose the source’s 
origination information to establish a gate pass before loads enter mill sites. 
Compulsory requirements to follow all applicable laws and regulations along with 
upholding the intent of Drax's commitment to sustainable forestry, are included in 
contracts.
• Robust transaction accounting system captures sustainability characteristics about 
the source upon establishment and assigns relational information to each load 
registered upon delivery. 

Transaction accounting system captures designation of the inputs and 
species groups. 

Control points are established, and training is completed to ensure only 
sources of known origin enter mill sites.
•﻿Drax﻿holds﻿verified﻿SFI®,﻿PEFC™﻿and﻿FSC®﻿CoC﻿Certificates﻿substantiating﻿that﻿
all feedstock is assessed for risk via a Due Diligence System (DDS).
• Majority of feedstock inputs at LaSalle Bioenergy, Morehouse Bioenergy, and Amite 
Bioenergy are from primary sources with a growing proportion from secondary 
sources. 
• The feedstock input for AL Pellets Aliceville and AL Pellets Demopolis, as well as 
the two Arkansas satellite plants is entirely from manufacturing residuals (SBP 
secondary feedstock).  The Arkansas satellite plants utilize fiber directly from the 
product manufacturer that is co-located with each respective plant.
• Suppliers of secondary and tertiary feedstocks have contractual requirements to 
confirm that their feedstock originates within Drax’s defined catchment.  This is 
checked through internal procedures at Drax, including logical haul radius and 
regular communication with secondary and tertiary suppliers. Communication 
includes inspection where required.
• Monitoring and internal audit is carried out to verify the accuracy and completeness 
of information gathered.

harvested wood through examination of 21 indicators including ownership and land 
use.
• The World Bank has awarded the US a Global Governance Index rating that is in 
the 89th percentile for rule of law.
• Annual review of the DDS is completed to substantiate and reverify the “low risk” 
determination.
• Per the preamble, the  Worldwide Governance Indicators provides assurance that 
the rule of law is effective in this geography. This further assures performance of 
suppliers of secondary and tertiary feedstocks.
Means of
Verification
• Property law is well established and policed through effective courts (see Global 
Governance index).  Drax has implemented DDS presenting the laws utilized in the 
US and each state sourced from to showcase the rule of law and public agency 
governance. 
• Risk assessments listed in preamble, which range from company to landscape 
level, have captured the existence and effectiveness of statutory, contractual, 
property, and civil law in the defined supply base. 
• Land use challenges are absent and legal processes are present to establish and 
challenge land ownership in the wood procurement region.
• Preamble citations including  Worldwide Governance Indicators
• Drax has implemented a procedure to ensure a defined response of preferred 
actions to handle identified non-compliant material in relation to compliance with the 
Timber Standard and EUTR.
• Drax has written contracts for all suppliers.
• Suppliers are required to abide by all laws and regulations in a Fiber Purchase 
Agreement.
• Monitoring, as well as internal and external audit, act as checks for completeness 
and accuracy of records. 
• Stakeholder Consultation
• Transactional accounting system records
• Drax conducted a comprehensive stakeholder consultation to capture feedback 
regarding legality issues in the procurement regions. 

One stakeholder voiced their concern about the level of law enforcement and
effectiveness of existing legal controls as they relate to logging. However, 
Drax continues to support FSC assessment of “low-risk,” and through 
continued monitoring of their catchment finds that the level of enforcement is 
effective, and that timber trespass is not systemic in procurement region.

compared with 2014, and by 20.2 percent when compared with the 2006 data
·         Since 2008, several other states have also acted to strengthen timber theft 
laws by expanding enforcement and/or increasing penalties (for example, Missouri, 
Louisiana, and Arkansas). In Louisiana, the rate of occurrence of timber theft is 
reportedly less than in past years due to changes in the law that imposed higher 
penalties.

·         Federally threatened and endangered species and species/natural 
communities ranked G1 and G2 do occur within the sourcing area and known 
locations within Drax’s primary sourcing area are mapped using NatureServe and 
Natural Heritage data. 
·         RAMSAR sites: there are three named sites within Drax’s sourcing area, all 
are protected by state, federal, and NGO ownership and involvement. Any harvesting
within these areas would be under direct supervision of the state and federal 
agencies. These areas include: Catahoula Lake, LA, Caddo Lake, TX/LA, andCache-
Lower White Rivers, AR, Congaree National Park, SC, Francis Beidler Forest, SC, 
 Okefenokee National Wildlife Refuge, GA,  https://www.ramsar.org/
·         There is one Conservation International Biodiversity hotspot within the 
sourcing area, the “North American Coastal Plain”. This is a broad region, reaching 
from northern Mexico along the Gulf of Mexico and up the East Coast to south-
eastern Massachusetts. The concerns in this Global 200 region have been reviewed 
and crosschecked with the specified risks identified in the FSC NRA and are 
appropriately identified and addressed. https://www.cepf.net/our-work/biodiversity-
hotspots
·         There are two WWF Global 200 ecoregions in the sourcing area, the 
temperate coniferous and broadleaf forest (#75) and the Appalachian and mixed 
mesophytic forests (#69). These Global 200 regions represent aggregations of WWF 
continental ecoregions (described below) to a scale which is assistive to global 
prioritization. In theory, conservation within these global ecoregions would help 
conserve the most outstanding and representative habitats for biodiversity in the 
world.
·         There are eleven WWF terrestrial ecoregions identified in the supply area, nine
are considered “critical/endangered” by WWF and one is considered “vulnerable”. 
WWF ecoregions are only one ecoregion classification method. The WWF 
ecoregions focus narrowly on regional concerns which WWF has identified to help 
direct their conservation efforts. To inform management and conservation initiatives 
Drax has chosen EPA ecoregion III and IV classifications, which provide more 
detailed ecological information relevant to forest management than the WWF 
ecoregions.  The issues identified in these WWF ecoregions have been considered 
by FSC National Risk Assessment, a multi-stakeholder review, and have been 
incorporated, as appropriate, into their specified HCV risks. Drax has reviewed the 
WWF ecoregions and crosschecked them with the identified risks in the FSC NRA as
well and the proprietary HCV mapping tools developed in partnership with Nature 
Serve, to assure they have been adequately identified and addressed. WWF 
ecoregions reviewed include:
1.
NA0404 Central US Hardwood Forests - Critical/Endangered
2.
NA0409 Mississippi Lowland Forests - Critical/Endangered
3.
NA0412 Ozark Mountain Forests - Critical/Endangered

·         There is one WWF aquatic region concern that falls within Drax’s sourcing 
area, the Southeastern Rivers and Streams ecosystem.  Streams and rivers 
associated with known HCVs have been flagged by Nature Serve and are 
incorporated into Drax’s mapping systems.
·         There are several Key Biodiversity Areas (KBA) and Alliance for Zero 
Extinction areas (AZE) within the sourcing area. These areas are under 
federal/state/and NGO protection and no sourcing from them can occur without 
appropriate oversight of these entities.

Indicator
2.1.2
The BP has implemented appropriate control systems and procedures to identify and 
address potential threats to forests and other areas with high conservation values from 
forest management activities.
Finding
·         The FSC US National Risk assessment has identified ten “specified risks” 
within Drax’s sourcing area that pertain to species and ecological communities. They 
include Native Longleaf Pine Systems, Late Successional Bottomland Hardwoods, 
Dusky Gopher Frog, Southern Appalachian Critical Biodiversity Area, Central 
Appalachian Critical Biodiversity Area, Cape Fear Arch Critical Biodiversity Area, 
Florida Panhandle Critical Biodiversity Area, Cheoah Bald Salamander, Patch Nose 
Salamander, and Mesophytic Cove Sites. Drax recognizes this multi-stakeholder 
effort to identify “specified risks” related to forest sourcing and has therefore accepted
these risks as such.
·         Drax also recognizes that there are additional species and natural community 
types which FSC did not elevate to the level of “Specified Risks” but which still 
warrant protection. Drax has thoroughly assessed and reviewed these species and 
community types (see Indicator 2.1.1 for a detail review of sources checked and 
HCVs identified). 
·         The existing mechanisms in place to protect these additional species and 
natural community was reviewed by Drax and is detailed in Means of Verification 
below. Following this review Drax concurs with the FSC US NRA and has selected no
additional “specified risks”, other than those listed above which would require 
additional mitigations outside of standard operating procedures.
Means of
Verification
·         State agencies have a number of controls in place to identify and protect 
species and natural communities. These state agencies work in concert with the 
Natural Heritage Programs in their respective states (a part of the NatureServe 
network) to continuously monitor and inventory natural diversity in the states. State 
Wildlife Actions Plans as well as state Forest Action Plans are required for states to 
receive federal funding. These plans, drafted through multi-stakeholder participation, 
identify key wildlife and forestry concerns within the state and provide detailed plans

·         The forest products industry participates directly in the development of the 
State Wildlife Action Plans as well as efforts to protect and identify species and 
communities of concern. For example, Drax purchases a data license from 
NatureServe annually. NatureServe then provides Drax with shapefiles for all known 
species and communities of concern. This data is integrated into Drax’s mapping 
system which is used to screen all harvests where Drax is receiving fiber directly 
from the woods. The use of NatureServe data, and the protection of species and 
communities deemed globally critically imperilled (G1) or globally imperilled (G2), is 
required by all participants of the Sustainable Forestry Initiative (SFI). Drax sources 
from landowners certified to the SFI Forest Management Standard and from sawmills
that are certified to the SFI Fiber Sourcing Standard, both of which require 
consideration of G1, G2, and T&E species. Drax is also certified to the SFI FS 
Standard.
 
 
·         In addition to State Wildlife Action Plans and Natural Heritage Data, the federal
Endangered Species Act (ESA) and federal Clean Water Act are very strong 
regulatory mechanisms which are in place to reduce the risk of further biodiversity 
loss. These regulations bring with them significant civil and criminal penalties (i.e. up 
to 1 year imprisonment for ESA violation and $54,000/day for CWA violation). The 
ESA prohibits not only direct “take” but can also deem habitat alteration as a “taking”.
The ESA can restrict forest management on both private and public lands. Habitat 
Conservation Agreements (HCPs), Safe Harbor Agreements, and Candidate 
Conservation Agreements are among the tools provided to a landowner who wishes 
to actively manage their forest in areas where threatened or endangered species, 
highly sensitive to forest alteration, exist. The red-cockaded woodpecker, and the 
Louisiana pine snake are two species currently being managed with these 
mechanisms in Drax’s sourcing area. For some species Critical Habitat has been 
designated, a further assurance that federally listed species are protected (i.e. 
gopher frog in Drax sourcing area). 
·         Clean Water Act protections are extremely relevant to the protection of 
biodiversity. States have been granted the authority to develop programs to address 
nonpoint source pollution from forestry operations. These state “Best Management 
Programs” have been recognized by the USFWS in recent listing rules as a means of
ensuring species protection. For example, the Pearl darter listing rule described 
positive effects of BMPs as follows: “Nonpoint source pollution is a localized threat to 
the pearl darter within the drainage and is more prevalent in areas where certified 
best management practices (BMPs) are not utilized. The use of certified BMPs during
land-altering activities can greatly reduce impacts to water quality. Certified BMPs, 
currently implemented by the forestry industry (e.g., Sustainable Forestry Initiative, 
Forest Stewardship Council, and American Tree Farm System), are helping to 
minimize or eliminate non-point source pollution during the course of forestry 
activities. The Mississippi Forestry Commission (2016, entire) reports certified BMP 
implementation rates to be high in Mississippi for forestry activities, primarily due to 
the efforts of State forestry agencies and forest certification programs (Schilling and 
Wigley 2015, pp 3–7)” (82 Fed Reg 43889).
In the southeastern US, the Southern Group of State Foresters has introduced a 
framework to standardize BMP monitoring efforts among the 13 southern states. 
According to a 2018 report summarizing rates of BMP implementation, all states in 
the region were in conformance with the framework. Furthermore, 67 state-wide 
monitoring surveys had been conducted since its initial development in 1997 and 23 
surveys were conducted in the last six years. Combining all BMP categories in all 
states and using only the most recent state survey data reported, average overall 
BMP implementation for the region was 93.6%, up from 92% in 2012. 
(https://www.southernforests.org/resources/publications/SGSF%20Water%20BMP%
20Report%20FINAL.pdf/view).
BMP implementation rates in the states that Drax sources from are as follows:
MS- Overall 95%
Mississippi 2019 BMP Implementation Survey
LA- Overall 89% (according to 2015 survey data reported in SGSF report, 2009 is 
most recent state-level report publicly available.)

GA 2021 BMP Implementation Survey
NC- Overall 84%
NC 2018 BMP Implementation Survey
SC- Overall 94%

KY
·         As described above, a structured BMP program has been in place in the 
southern US for over two decades. In this same time period the forest industry has 
embraced SFI (est. 1994) which has championed BMP implementation through its 
trained logger requirements as well as the protection of biodiversity.  See research by
Dwivedi et al. on increased BMP implementation within the supply area of SFI FS 
mills - http://sficonference.org/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/Puneet-Dwivedi.pdfee). 
Furthermore, the State Wildlife Action Planning Process is now in its 15th year and 
Forest Action Plans have been in place since 2010. These industry-wide initiatives in 
place for protection of biological diversity can be considered standard practice as well
as an industry expectation. Drax, as a responsible member of the industry, has 
developed a program to verify the implementation of BMPs and the protection of 
known species of concern for its own in-woods sourcing. Drax’s individual actions to 
verify BMP usage and protection of species of concern when sourcing directly from 
the forest simultaneously meet the industry expectations for environmental protection
and may also be considered a mitigation, by SBP definition, to control the risk of 
sourcing material not in compliance with this indicator.

nra.
 
 
Drax’s procedures and mitigation approach is somewhat different for primary and 
secondary feedstock sourcing.  
 
Procedures and Mitigation Actions: Primary Feedstock Sourcing
Only two of the specified risks are relevant to Drax’s primary sourcing of roundwood 
and in-woods chips, Native Longleaf Pine Systems (NLPS), and Late Successional 
Bottomland Hardwoods (LSBH).
Native Longleaf Pine Systems (Primary)
NLPS are described as “fire-dependent systems include longleaf pine as the 
dominant tree, a conspicuous lack of mid-story trees and shrubs, and a well-
developed, diverse ground layer (dominated by bunch grasses and other flowering 
plants)”.  In the Drax primary supply areas existing NLPS are not at significant risk   
because the vast majority:
1.     are managed to maintain and perpetuate these systems, and 
2.     are owned by federal or state agencies and conservation-oriented organizations
with the mandate and means to implement conservation-forestry practices.
 
Late Successional Bottomland Hardwoods  (Primary)
LSBH is a very small risk due to the fact that Drax sources primarily southern yellow 
pine, with a de minimis amount (chip content is estimated as 0.26 % hardwood) of in-
woods chip material which may contain hardwood.  Low level mitigation is deemed 
appropriate
*Note - a further safeguard for the protection of LSBH is the commitment that Drax 
has made to not utilize material from cypress tupelo ecosystems in the production of 
wood pellets.
Drax Practices to Avoid Harm and Mitigate Risk in Primary Sourcing
Current procurement procedures and processes mitigate the risk of sourcing fiber in 
a manner that would threaten NLPS and LSBH forests (FSC CENTRAL THEME: 
Procurement Policy).  These primary feedstock controls, embedded in Drax’s internal
processes, are subject to monitoring and internal audit.  Drax has integrated the FSC
HCV maps into its GIS system and Rapid Risk Assessment process and actively 
screens all tracts for sensitivities.  In addition, Drax requires comprehensive forest 
cover type and species information be provided during source set-up which allows 
stands to be assessed for the potential of sourcing from longleaf pine or hardwood 
systems.  If a risk is identified, then Drax has an opportunity provide educational 
mitigation materials and to identify management requirements which will protect the 
integrity of the system (CENTRAL THEME: Education & Outreach).  Drax also 
reserves the right to refuse purchase of fiber if the harvesting method and/or the 
subsequent management plans will threaten the integrity of these high conservation 
value forests (FSC CENTRAL THEME: Procurement Policy). 
 
Procedures and Mitigation Actions: Secondary Feedstock Sourcing
Drax does not have line of sight to individual tracts that provide fiber to secondary 
and tertiary feedstock suppliers, therefore the following mitigations will be applied:
Native Longleaf Pine Systems (Secondary)
For NLPS, 78% of the risk area mapped by FSC is within the Drax supply base.  That
percentage is reduced to 41% when the sourcing characteristics of the actual ranges 
of current secondary and tertiary suppliers is considered. Low level mitigation is 
deemed appropriate.
The areas at risk have been identified by FSC at county/parish level.  Education and 
outreach will be the main method of mitigation for residual suppliers who’s sourcing 
area intersects FSC identified risk areas.  The desired outcome of these 
communications is engaging landowners, foresters, and loggers in conservation of 
Native Longleaf Pine systems.   
 
FSC CENTRAL THEME: Education & Outreach is the primary mitigation option.  
Drax has engaged the Longleaf Alliance in the development of educational 
materials.  Drax also supports the annual Longleaf Alliance conference.  The areas 
that potentially have NLPS have been mapped by FSC and integrated into Drax’s 
GIS system.  Educational materials are distributed to suppliers that touch identified 
specified risk areas.  Educational materials have been developed to engage 
landowners, foresters, and loggers in conservation of this forest system. Drax also 
actively supports workshops and learning exchanges focused on encouraging 
proactive management of longleaf pine in the supply area. Plans are to distribute 
additional educational materials the Longleaf Alliance has already developed and 
investigate other opportunities for engaging in regional LL conservation initiatives 
including landowner workshops. 
Late Successional Bottomland Hardwoods (Secondary)
FSC CENTRAL THEME: Education & Outreach is the primary mitigation option.  As 
Drax primarily sources southern yellow pine, Late Successional Bottomland 
Hardwoods are mainly an issue for residual suppliers who process hardwoods and 
are proximate to LSBH areas. The areas that potentially have NLPS have been 
mapped by FSC and integrated into Drax’s GIS system.  Educational materials, 
developed in partnership with the Forest Stewards Guild, are distributed to suppliers 
that touch identified specified risk areas. Educational materials have been developed 
to engage landowners, foresters, and loggers in conservation of this forest system. 
Drax also actively supports Forest Stewards Guild workshops and learning 
exchanges focused on improving the management of bottomland hardwoods and 
helps fund the development of management plans for private landowners.  
Dusky Gopher Frog Critical Habitat (Secondary)
FSC CENTRAL THEME: Education & Outreach is the primary mitigation option.  FSC
identifies two small areas at the extreme south of Drax’s sourcing area which are 
only of relevance to residual sourcing.  These areas are under Federal Critical 
Habitat protections.  FSC has identified education and outreach as a mitigation 
option for the DGF. Drax has only four suppliers having this risk within their potential 
sourcing area.  Drax provides educational materials developed by the USFWS to the 
suppliers which have the potential to source from the FSC identified risk areas.  
Educational materials are informed by the best available science and adapted as 
new information and/or approaches become available. The desired outcome of these 
communications is engaging landowners, foresters, and loggers in conservation of 
DGF populations. 
Southern Appalachian Critical Biodiversity Area (Secondary)
Central Appalachian Critical Biodiversity Area (Secondary)
Mesophytic Cove Sites  (Secondary)
Drax’s source area overlap with these three somewhat similar FSC risk types varies 
greatly.

and tertiary suppliers

Drax recognizes the Central and Critical Biodiversity Areas and Mesophytic Cove 
Sites as specified risks within the wider supply area.  The Central Appalachian CBA 
and the Mesophytic Cove specified risks are at the edges of Drax residual sourcing 
area, and thus pose a very low risk.  Education and outreach is the mitigation tool 
employed (FSC CENTRAL THEME: Education & Outreach).  As described for the 
risks above, these materials have been developed according to best available 
science and be adapted as new information and approaches come available (i.e., 
through FSC CW Regional meetings).   This educational material is aimed at 
increasing awareness of the sensitivities and unique nature of these CBAs and cove 
sites in hopes of increasing conservation of these highly biodiverse areas. The 
Southern Appalachian CBA poses a medium risk with the acquisition of the Alabama 
Pellet Plants therefore, Drax is adding Conservation Initiatives (FSC CENTRAL 
THEME: Conservation Initiatives) to the educational and outreach materials 
mentioned above to the mitigation tools to be employed for this specified risk.
Cape Fear Arch Critical Biodiversity Area  (Secondary)Drax recognizes the Cape 
Fear Arch Critical Biodiversity Area as specified risk within the wider supply area.  
This specified risk comprises a small region in the Drax residual sourcing area. 
Although 100% of the risk area mapped by FSC is within the Drax supply base, that 
percentage is reduced to 0% when the sourcing characteristics of the actual ranges 
of current secondary and tertiary suppliers is considered. Low level mitigation is 
deemed appropriate. 
The primary concerns are for Pocosins and for longleaf pine habitats.  Both have 
widespread protections or conservation measures in place, and thus pose a very low 
risk.  Pocosins are a wetland type that is protected by BMPs.  Longleaf pine is 
subject to a widespread and increasingly effective landscape conservation 
movement.  To further support these positive factors Drax has selected Education 
and outreach are the mitigation tool (FSC CENTRAL THEME: Education & Outreach)
to address this risk if sourcing begins in this area.  As described for the risks above, 
these materials have been developed according to best available science and be 
adapted as new information and approaches come available (i.e., through FSC CW 
Regional meetings).  This educational material is aimed at increasing awareness of 
the sensitivities and unique nature of these CBAs in hopes of increasing conservation
of these highly biodiverse areas.
Florida Panhandle Critical Biodiversity Area  (Secondary)
Drax recognizes the Florida Panhandle Critical Biodiversity Area as specified risk 
within the wider supply area.  Although 100% of the risk area mapped by FSC is 
within the Drax supply base, that percentage is reduced to <1% when the sourcing 
characteristics of the actual ranges of current secondary and tertiary suppliers is 
considered. Many of the biodiversity elements are already protected by BMPs or by 
the Longleaf Pine conservation efforts previously described.
“This concentration of biodiversity is driven by the river systems (particularly the 
Apalachicola River), longleaf pine savanna habitat and unique steephead ravines.” 
Source: FSC US Controlled Wood Regional Meeting Report. Southeast & Mississippi
Alluvial Valley Regions. Atlanta, GA.  July 31, 2018.To further support these positive 
factors Drax has selected FSC CENTRAL THEME Education & Outreach as the 
mitigation tool to address this risk if sourcing begins in this area.  As described for the
risks above, these materials have been developed according to best available 
science and be adapted as new information and approaches come available (i.e., 
through FSC CW Regional meetings).  This educational material is aimed at 
increasing awareness of the sensitivities and unique nature of these CBAs in hopes 
of increasing conservation of these highly biodiverse areas.
Cheoah Bald Salamander  (Secondary)
Drax recognizes the Cheoah Bald Salamander as specified risk within the wider 
supply area.  This salamander is known to exist only on Federal land at the extreme 
edges of Drax residual sourcing area, and thus pose a very low risk.  Drax has 
selected FSC CENTRAL THEME Education & Outreach as the mitigation tool 
employed.  As described for the risks above, these materials have been developed 
according to best available science and be adapted as new information and 
approaches come available (i.e., through FSC CW Regional meetings).  This 
educational material is aimed at increasing awareness of the sensitivities and unique 
nature of this species.
Patch-nosed Salamander (Secondary)
Drax recognizes the Patch-nosed Salamander as specified risk within the wider 
supply area.  Although 100% of the risk area mapped by FSC is within the Drax 
supply base, that percentage is reduced to <1% when the sourcing characteristics of 
the actual ranges of current secondary and tertiary suppliers is considered. This 
salamander is known to exist only in a small portion (about 5,000 acres) of several 
counties of the Drax residual sourcing area.  The salamander is known to inhabit 
small streams in narrow, steep-walled ravines.  Because these sites are protected by 
BMPs and not likely to be impacted by logging there is a very low risk.  Drax has 
selected FSC CENTRAL THEME Education & Outreach as the mitigation tool 
employed.   As described for the risks above, these materials have been developed 
according to best available science and be adapted as new information and 
approaches come available (i.e., through FSC CW Regional meetings).  This 
educational material is aimed at increasing awareness of the sensitivities and unique 
nature of this species.
 
The mitigations described above are sufficient to bring the risk of non-compliance 
with this requirement to “low”.
 
Indicator
2.1.3
The BP has implemented appropriate control systems and procedures for verifying that 
feedstock is not sourced from forests converted to production plantation forest or non-
forest lands after January 2008.
Finding
·         FSC Controlled Wood National Risk Assessment identify some areas within 
Drax’s larger supply area as a specified risk for conversion, however the majority of 
the sourcing area is not at risk. 
The limited risk of conversion is substantiated by the following findings:
·         FIA data indicates stable and/or increasing forest inventory and forest area in 
Drax’s sourcing area. 
·         Absence of SBP defined "production plantation forests" in wood procurement 
region.
·         Historical evidence that healthy markets keep forests as forests.
·         Review of WWF Ecoregions, and associated concerns about conversion, 
indicate that these are not significant. 
·         Recent analysis of Drax catchment area analysis (2019 and 2020) using FIA 
data, market data, and remote sensing tools has not revealed conversion to be a risk. 
·         CWA provides protections against conversion of wetland forests
Means of
Verification
Finding of limited Specified Risk in sourcing area:
·         The FSC National Risk Assessment conducted found that there were limited 
areas of conversion risk in Drax’s sourcing area which were associated with 
expansion of commercial and residential areas, driven largely by population growth 
(see map below). In their review FSC considered all of the WWF ecoregions, along 
with the concerns cited for conversion, but ultimately focused their finding of 
conversion on areas these areas of urban and residential interface. Drax has 
therefore accepted that there is a specified risk in some portions of its sourcing area.  
A review of mitigation measures is included in the Comment or Mitigation Measure 
section below.
Sources substantiating the low risk of conversion for most of the supply area:
·         SBP defines "production plantation forests" as “Forests of exotic species that 
have been planted or seeded by human intervention and that are under intensive 
stand management, are fast growing, and subject to short rotations (e.g. Poplar, 
Acacia or Eucalyptus plantations)”. The threat of conversion to production plantation 
in Drax’s sourcing area is low for two primary reasons:
o    The planted pine forests in the area where Drax sources from is composed 
primarily of loblolly pine which is a species native to this region (see figure below).
 
o    The forests are not intensively managed on short rotations but rather managed 
for sawtimber. Under good growing conditions, pine forests planted with improved 
genetics (through standard breeding), and whose density is managed through 
thinning and early competition control, can achieve sawtimber size in as little as 25 
years. Forisk Consulting conducted a survey of southern silviculture in 2016 and 
2018 which included assessment of practices on 6.9 and 9.7 million acres, 
respectively. This survey found that the average clearcut age for pine in the Gulf 
South was 36 years old (see table below), indicating that the region is neither 
managed to a high intensity nor is it managed for short fiber rotations.  
·         A 2017 analysis by Forest2Market concurs with this outcome stating, “The 
biggest threat to forests is urbanization, not the forest products industry”. In fact, they
found that markets for timber products encourage landowners to keep forest as 
forests and not convert them to other, more lucrative, landuses. In their retrospective 
examiniation they found that increases in demand encouraged landowners to invest 
in forests, with forest acres increasing as removals increased (see figure below). 
https://www.forest2market.com/hubfs/2016_Website/Documents/20170726_Forest2
Market_Historical_Perspective_US_South.pdf
 
 
·         The American Forest Foundation states that “Markets encourage landowners 
to invest in forests, helping keep forests as forests. Strong markets signal that buying
forestland, retaining forestland, or investing in forest management, is a good use of 
an individual or family’s hard earned income. 
https://www.forestfoundation.org/markets-for-family-forest-wood-products
 
·         Forest Inventory and Analysis (FIA) data show a stable forest inventory 
indicating that conversion of forestland to non-forestland is a low risk in our 
catchment area. See figures below which were generated through recent analysis of 
FIA data (2019/2020). 
Morehouse bioenergy primary catchment area:
LaSalle Bioenergy primary catchment area:
Arkansas Bioenergy – Leola
Arkansas Bioenergy – Russellville
AL Pellets Aliceville
Field audit two years post-harvest has identified no concerns with regeneration on 
sites from which primary fiber was sourced.
·        Drax is exploring remote sensing tools to evaluate regeneration and forest 
loss/gain at regional level. Global Forest Change 
https://earthenginepartners.appspot.com/science-2013-global-forest was reviewed 
and Drax catchment areas all appear as actively growing forests with harvests losses
offset by gains and maintenance of forest extent. The same Hanson data was used in
a catchment area analysis conducted by Interfor. Drax is also exploring the use of 
satellite imagery (i.e. Landsat 5) and Lidar to test the ability of remote sensing tools 
to identify forest loss as well as regeneration.
·         Section 404 of the CWA addresses the discharge of dredge and fill into 
waterways. There is an exemption for on-going silviculture practices, however, the 
Recapture Provision does not allow conversion of wetland forest to upland. See 
exemption to the CWA section 404 (f), Recapture Provision “Recapture Provision. 
Section 404(f) exemptions DO NOT APPLY where any discharge of dredged and/or 
fill material into “waters of the US”, including wetlands, IF 1] the activity would convert
an area of waters of the into a new use (e.g. wetland to upland, wetland to open 
water, etc.).
o    According to a report commissioned by the American Hardwood Council in 2017 
titled Assessment of Lawful Harvesting and Sustainability of US Hardwood Exports, 
“Available data suggest that CWA404 violations are aggressively prosecuted by the 
regulatory agencies. According to the Corps of Engineers, about 6,000 alleged 
violations of the Clean Water Act that falls under the Corps' jurisdiction are processed
in district offices each year. Of these, over 60 percent relate to Section 404 permitting
(although only a very small number involve silvicultural activities in wetlands).  See 
overview at:
o    http://www.usace.army.mil/cw/cecwo/reg/oceover.htm.” Link to report: 
https://www.americanhardwood.org/index.php/en/latest/news/seneca-creek-study
·         Regarding WWF’s ecoregions, many of which have been labelled 
“critical/endangered” citing conversion as a concern, it is important to remember that 
these ecoregions were created by WWF for the purpose of prioritizing conservation 
initiatives. Upon closer examination it was determined that landscape level forest 
conversion was not the specific driver for conservation need.  Instead, very specific 
issues are identified.  For example:
o    The primary concern in the NA0523-Piney Woods forests ecoregion is 
maintenance of the sandhill pine forest communities, where long-leaf pine (Pinus 
palustris) shares dominance with shortleaf pine (Pinus echinata) and loblolly pine 
(Pinus taeda) and pine densities are low. This community type can be likened to the 
“open forest” type that is a high priority in State Wildlife Action Plans (see Criteria 
2.1.2) and as a Specified Risk in FSC’s HCV 3 designation, i.e. Native Longleaf Pine 
Systems (NLPS), which Drax recognizes as a Specified Risk for indicators 2.1.2, 
2.2.3, 2.2.4, and 2.4.1. 
o    Another WWF ecosystem in the region is NA0409-Mississippi Lowland Forests. 
The protection focus in this ecosystem is bottomland hardwood forests. Past 
conversion, mainly into cultivation, degraded these forests and reduced them to a 
point where “there is very little to conserve”. Again, FSC has recognized the primary 
threat to the system, but categorized it as a more specific HCV3 risk, “ Late 
Successional Bottomland Hardwoods”, which Drax also recognizes as a Specified 
Risk in the supply area for indicators 2.1.2, 2.2.3, 2.2.4, and 2.4.1. 
o    The NA0412-Ozark Mountains Forests, with its well-developed-oak hickory 
forests, are recognized for the distinctness of their freshwater communities. The 
remaining blocks of habitat are the Boston Mountains and the Ouachita Mountains 
themselves, with no significant intact habitats existing in the lowlands. The biggest 
threat is development of the mountains to support second homes and resorts but 
conversion to pine and fire suppression is also mentioned as risk. FSC initially 
considered the Ozark Mountain region as a specified risk, citing the threat to aquatic 
species as a key driver. However, based on review of forestry BMP implementation 
data, this area was removed from the list of Specified Risks. Drax also considers its 
fiber sourcing practices to have a low risk of endangering the recognized biological 
distinctness of this ecoregion and sources less than 5% of fiber from this area.  AR 
BMP implementation data is available here: 
https://www.aad.arkansas.gov/Websites/aad/files/Content/5944993/Bioassessment_o
f_Silviculture_Best_Management_Practices_in_Arkansas_.pdf
 
o    The East Central Texas Forests ecoregion is one of WWF’s smallest ecoregions 
within the Temperate Broadleaf and Mixed Forests biome. The ecoregion is 
characterized by open forests of oak and hickory with an herbaceous component 
dominated by bluestem. Common oaks species are post oak, scarlet, and blackjack 
oak, all species that are generally undesirable timber species due to their growth 
forms. The primary threat is from conversion of forests for ranching and farming. 
Based on the species mix (naturally stunted oaks and hickories), the characteristic 
sparse tree cover, and the identified threat being conversion to agriculture, Drax does
not consider there to be a specified risk related to this criterion. 
Less than 1% of Drax’s fiber is received from eastern Texas.

Mitigation
Measure
To mitigate the potential for conversion risk in some (FSC identified) counties at the 
perimeter of its sourcing area, Drax applies FSC CENTRAL THEME: Procurement 
Policy and FSC CENTRAL THEME Education & Outreach to mitigate conversion 
risk.  All supply contracts specify that wood from conversion sources is unacceptable 
and all suppliers that have the potential to source from FSC identified conversion risk
areas are provided with educational materials.  The desired outcome of the 
educational material is to help support and encouraging landowners in their efforts to 
keep their forests as forests.
For reference the following excerpt from FSC US Controlled Wood Regional Meeting 
Report is provided: ATLANTA 4/8/19 48: 
“The following is offered as an option that could be scaled for any level of mitigation: 
Using materials as described below, communicate to audiences (also described 
below) the social benefits of keeping forests as forests, and the value-enhancing 
alternatives to conversion and opportunities for the maintenance of forests (e.g., tax-
relief programs, succession planning). The desired outcome of these 
communications is engaging landowners within the specified risk area and the 
Organization’s supply area in the maintenance of forests.
Audiences: Communications are directed toward audiences where there is a proven 
or reasonable expectation of effectiveness in achieving the above defined desired 
outcome. Depending upon the Organization’s location in the supply chain, 
communications may be directly with landowners, foresters, or loggers, or through 
intermediaries such as community members, forest managers, suppliers, forestry 
associations or landowner associations, or through collaboration with 
organizations/individuals already working for maintenance of forests. 
INTENT: The intent of this mitigation option is to implement education and outreach-
related actions that will result in maintenance of forests, and thereby mitigate the risk 
of sourcing materials from sites in the specified risk area where the forest is being 
converted to non-forest use. “
The mitigations described above are sufficient to bring the risk of non-compliance 
with this requirement to “low”.
 
Indicator
2.10.1
Genetically modified trees are not used.
Finding
·         The FSC US Controlled Wood Risk Assessment has found there is a “low risk” 
of wood from forests in which genetically modified trees are planted (Section 5.1).
·         At the same time, it should be noted that the United States is the most 
advanced country in laboratory experiments and field trials of GMO species and thus 
the possibility that GMO species will be commercially used in the US is realistic. If 
updated data becomes available about commercial usage of GMO species in the US,
the US FSC Controlled Wood Risk Assessment for this category will be updated and 
reviewed.

In the southeastern US, the Southern Group of State Foresters has introduced a 
framework to standardize BMP monitoring efforts among the 13 states. According to 
a 2018 report summarizing rates of BMP implementation, all states in the region were
in conformance with the framework. Furthermore, 67 state-wide monitoring surveys 
had been conducted since its initial development in 1997 and 23 surveys were 
conducted in the last six years. Combining all BMP categories in all states and using 
only the most recent state survey data reported, average overall BMP implementation
for the region was 93.6%, up from 92% in 2012.

“Certified BMPs, currently implemented by the forestry industry (e.g., Sustainable 
Forestry Initiative, Forest Stewardship Council, and American Tree Farm System), 
are helping to minimize or eliminate non-point source pollution during the course of 
forestry activities. The Mississippi Forestry Commission (2016, entire) reports 
certified BMP implementation rates to be high in Mississippi for forestry activities, 
primarily due to the efforts of State forestry agencies and forest certification programs
(Schilling and Wigley 2015, pp 3–7)” (82 Fed Reg 43889).

·         All states in Drax’s sourcing area utilize a current use valuation on forestland 
that is much lower than fair market value. As described on the Taxfoundation.org 
website, if owners of forested land had to pay a percentage of the land’s fair market 
value, their payments would be much higher because potential buyers considering 
other uses for the land would drive up the fair market value. This fair market value 
system would then increase pressure on landowners to make profitable use of their 
land or sell it to someone who would. Details on the taxes imposed on timberland for 
all 50 states can be found at: https://taxfoundation.org/states-use-gentle-hand-taxing-

·         Federal lands are managed through the National Environmental Policy Act 
(NEPA) process assures that proper management occurs on federal lands. The 
NEPA process requires federal agencies to assess the environmental effects of their 
proposed actions prior to making decisions.
Habitat Conservation Agreements (HCPs), Safe Harbor Agreements, and Candidate 
Conservation Agreements are among the tools provided to a landowner who wishes 
to actively manage their forest in areas where threatened or endangered species, 
highly sensitive to forest alteration, exist. The red-cockaded woodpecker, and the 
Louisiana pine snake are two species currently being managed with these 
mechanisms in Drax’s sourcing area. For some species Critical Habitat has been 
designated, a further assurance that federally listed species are protected (i.e. 
gopher frog in Drax sourcing area).  
·         Many lands are also placed under conservation easements which require 
structured management plans. See link to the National Conservation Easement 
Database: http://conservationeasement.us/
·         State Wildlife Action Plans (SWAPs) are administered by the state wildlife 
agencies in cooperation with a diverse stakeholder group representing other state 
agencies, federal agencies, private conservation organizations, and industry 
partners. They identify key natural habitats and sensitive species to cooperatively 
address protection. Federal dollars, available to states with active SWAPs allow 
states to actively seek out areas to protect through purchase and/or conservation 
easement. Link to all State Wildlife Action Plans: https://www.fishwildlife.org/afwa-
informs/state-wildlife-action-plans
·         States have developed Pesticide General Permits (PGP) to meet the CWA 
requirements. A Pesticide Discharge Management Plan is a requirement of the PGP 
when applications meet certain criteria. In all cases proper documentation and 
recordkeeping of herbicide applications is a requirement and herbicides must be 
applied by certified applicators. This permit applies to private entities applying forest 
pesticides (i.e. herbicides) and provides an additional level of assurance that 
chemical use is carefully planned to minimize harm to the environment. 
·         Available information on known location of HCVs is reviewed for all fiber 
received directly from in-woods operations per company sustainability policy. This 
provides additional assurance that impact to species or habitats of concern are 
avoided during sourcing.
·         External audit, internal audit, and programmatic monitoring all provide checks 
on the effectiveness of internal and external planning processes.

(CPET S5b)
Finding
·         A literature review of the effects of forestry operations on soil quality indicates 
that heavy equipment and harvesting practices do have the ability to impact soils in 
both negative and positive ways. The exact cause of these effects is often difficult to 
parse out due to the number of variables at play (i.e. soil characteristics and climate).
However, research has been informative to the development of best practices to 
control negative effects related to forest management and harvesting. 
·         All five States that Drax sources wood from have BMP guidelines. These 
BMPs are in place for water quality and include recommendations for protecting site 
productivity by limiting soil disturbance.  MS has developed BMPs for biomass 
harvesting that attempt to anticipate the issues that may arise with the greater use of 
forest residuals.
·         It is an industry norm to implement and evaluate the use of BMPs in programs 
which source fiber directly from the forest. SFI certification requires verification of 
BMPs and associated logger training.
Means of
Verification
·         Best Management Practices for forestry are established in each jurisdiction 
and monitored to achieve compliance to the Clean Water Act. Company sustainability
programs include internal BMP audit protocol verified by external 3rd party 
certification audits.  Drax, and other wood using facilities certified to the SFI Fiber 
Sourcing Standard, ensure a significant proportion of the forest landscape is 
implementing BMPs and properly planning harvests through a structured on-the-
ground verification program which is third-party audited. According to a 2018 report, 
overall BMP implementation for the region was 93.6%, up from 92% in 2012.

·         Drax, along with other SFI Fiber Sourcing participants have programs to 
implement BMPs and verify trained loggers. This network of trained loggers and SFI 
companies requiring the use of BMPs and conducting verification (i.e. Drax’s 
inclusion of BMPs in fiber contracts and internal BMP audit program) provides 
assurances the regional soil protection is in place.
   
·         A Long-Term Soil Productivity (LTSP) study was installed in the 1980’s to 
evaluate the effects of harvest related compaction and various levels of biomass 
removal on forest soils and productivity. Study sites in Mississippi, Louisiana, and 
Texas provide interesting data on the Gulf coastal plains of the southern United 
States. Results thus far have found that compaction from forestry equipment has not 
caused long-term negative effects on productivity. In fact, growth on coarse sandy 
soils showed positive gains after trafficking. This may be due to the increase in water 
holding capacity of the soil. They also found that on productive sites even extreme 
experimental levels of biomass removal did not affect future productivity, however, 
removal of additional organic matter from low-fertility sites may have an impact. They 
have suggested that response to harvesting and biomass removal is very site-
specific and cautioned against blanket specifications imposed to protect productivity.

·         A literature review conducted by NCASI in 2014 provides a comprehensive 
review of the impact forest harvesting has on soil properties and subsequent tree 
growth. This review highlights the complexities involved “Heavy machinery for 
yarding felled trees or logs can create visible patterns of soil disturbance. Within 
harvested areas, trees planted on skid trails and landings are subjected to the most 
disturbed soil in the mosaic of soil conditions. Altered soil properties, however, do not
always result in poorer tree growth (Greacen and Sands 1980; Miller, Scott, and 
Hazard 1996; Miller et al. 1989; Powers and Fiddler 1997). At some locations, the 
favorable influence of disturbance on other growth-determining factors can counter 
the generalization that soil compaction reduces subsequent tree and stand growth.

·         A study by Richter et al. found that forests increased the carbon in the top 
mineral soils of previously cropped land demonstrating that forests are important to 
rebuilding soils on previously cropped lands. Much of the southeastern US has been 
cleared for agriculture at some point and most of the managed pine forests are found
on previously cropped soils. The choice to maintain land in forest or convert from 
agriculture to forestry is influenced by the availability of markets for forest products. 
In this sense, the biomass market, which utilizes low-value fiber, can be considered 
to help incentivise landowners to manage forests important to building and 
maintaining soil which will help rebuild soil carbon and, potentially, help reduce the 
chances of conversion into cropland which causes significant soil C losses.

·         Several studies have investigated the response of soil carbon to harvesting 
and biomass removal. In most instances there is little, if any, change in mineral soil 
carbon. Changes in surface carbon are variable, with harvest often increasing carbon
in the top organic layer initially, likewise, different (experimental) residual biomass 
removal levels being reflecting in the carbon content of surface soil layers. These 
findings point out that there are several variables at play, including climate and 
decomposition rates.

·         Federal and state agencies along with non-governmental conservation 
organizations have identified key ecosystems and habitats which should be protected
from development and damaging resource extraction. The Protected Area Database 
(PAD-US) is America’s official national inventory of US terrestrial and marine 
protected areas (List of National Geospatial Data Assets) that are dedicated to the 
preservation of biological diversity and other natural, recreation and cultural areas. 
Identification of these areas ensures their consideration in forest management 
activities on state and federal lands as well as private lands (through conservation 
easement plans). Drax has integrated the shapefiles from PAD-US into its GIS 
mapping system and the data sits behind the Rapid Risk Assessment tool. 
·         Comprehensive wildlife action plans have been established for each state, 
further identifying key ecosystems which occur on both public and private land.  
Arkansas has provided shapefiles for key biodiversity management areas outlined in 
their State Wildlife Action Plan. Drax has integrated the shapefiles into its GIS 
mapping system.

·         Protected Area Database(PAD-US) details all the federal, state, municipal, and
private conservation areas on record (National Conservation Easement Database). 
Management of these lands is governed by comprehensive planning processes 
intended to protect key biological resources. Forest harvesting may be utilized as a 
tool to manage these areas, but oversight from the public agencies and conservation 
groups have oversight.  
 
·         States programs to protect key ecosystems.  For example, in Mississippi these
include the Mississippi Scenic Streams Stewardship Program (SSSP), the State 
Wildlife Grants Program (SWG), The Mississippi Natural Heritage Program 
(MNHP),Mississippi Forest Legacy Program, the Mississippi Wildlife Heritage 
Fund, and the Mississippi Partners for Fish and Wildlife Program (MPFW).
 
·         An extensive search of conservation organization resources and databases 
was conducted, findings of which are described in Indicator 2.1.1 of this document. 
All key ecosystems and biodiversity areas identified have been reviewed to assess 
relevance to Drax’s sourcing. Most of these areas are under federal and state 
management (and identified in PAD-US). FSC and WWF have identified larger 
“critical biodiversity areas” and “critical/endangered” ecoregions which have been 
considered relevant to Drax sourcing. The WWF ecoregions risks relevant to Drax 
are addressed by the FSC Specified Risk areas which Drax has accepted.  
Therefore, discussion will focus on FSC NRA’s treatment of these risks (see Indicator
2.1.3 for review of WWF ecoregion risks). 
 
·         FSC NRA: The following resources were reviewed to determine the relevance 
of Specified Risks identified in the FSC NRA:
o    FSC US Controlled Wood Risk Assessment
o    Static maps of areas with specified risks
o    Static map of all HCV1 Critical Biodiversity Areas
FSC Risks that Drax have identified in the supply base are seven key ecosystems: 
Late Successional Bottomland Hardwoods, Native Longleaf Pine Systems, Southern 
Appalachian Critical Biodiversity Area, Central Appalachian Critical Biodiversity Area, 
Mesophytic Cove, Florida Panhandle Critical Biodiversity Area ,Cape Fear Arch 
Critical Biodiversity Area, Mitigation for these Specified Risks include monitoring, 
internal audit, education Further details of the Specified Risk and the Mitigations 
developed for them are listed below. Note that Drax, as a responsible member of the 
industry, has developed a program to verify the implementation of BMPs and the 
protection of known species of concern, for its own in-woods sourcing. Drax’s 
individual actions to verify BMP usage and protection of species of concern when 
sourcing directly from the forest simultaneously meets the industry expectations for 
environmental protection and, according to the SBP definitions, may be considered a 
mitigation to control the risk of non-compliance with this indicator.

Drax implements the mandatory Control Measure 3.1 for Category 3 specified risks.  
This Control Measures is defined in the FSC US Controlled Wood National Risk 
Assessment (Appendix B of this document).  As specified by the mandatory Control 
Measure, Drax implements mitigation actions identified during the collaborative 
dialogue at the Controlled Wood Regional Meetings and detailed in the Controlled 
Wood Regional Meeting Report, available at: https://us.fsc.org/en-
us/certification/controlled-wood/fsc-us-controlled-wood-national-risk-assessment-us-
nra.
 
Procedures and Mitigation Actions: Primary Feedstock Sourcing
Only two of the specified risks are relevant to Drax’s primary sourcing of roundwood 
and in-woods chips, Native Longleaf Pine Systems (NLPS), and Late Successional 
Bottomland Hardwoods (LSBH).
Native Longleaf Pine Systems (Primary)
NLPS are described as “fire-dependent systems include longleaf pine as the 
dominant tree, a conspicuous lack of mid-story trees and shrubs, and a well-
developed, diverse ground layer (dominated by bunch grasses and other flowering 
plants)”.  In the Drax primary supply areas existing NLPS are not at significant risk   
because the vast majority:
1.     are managed to maintain and perpetuate these systems, and 
2.     are owned by federal or state agencies and conservation-oriented organizations
with the mandate and means to implement conservation-forestry practices.
 
Late Successional Bottomland Hardwoods  (Primary)
LSBH is a very small risk due to the fact that Drax sources primarily southern yellow 
pine, with a de minimis amount (chip content is estimated as 0.26 % hardwood) of in-
woods chip material which may contain hardwood.  Low level mitigation is deemed 
appropriate
*Note - a further safeguard for the protection of LSBH is the commitment that Drax 
has made to not utilize material from cypress tupelo ecosystems in the production of 
wood pellets.
Drax Practices to Avoid Harm and Mitigate Risk in Primary Sourcing
Current procurement procedures and processes mitigate the risk of sourcing fiber in 
a manner that would threaten NLPS and LSBH forests (FSC CENTRAL THEME: 
Procurement Policy).  These primary feedstock controls, embedded in Drax’s internal
processes, are subject to monitoring and internal audit.  Drax has integrated the FSC
HCV maps into its GIS system and Rapid Risk Assessment process and actively 
screens all tracts for sensitivities.  In addition, Drax requires comprehensive forest 
cover type and species information be provided during source set-up which allows 
stands to be assessed for the potential of sourcing from longleaf pine or hardwood 
systems.  If a risk is identified, then Drax has an opportunity provide educational 
mitigation materials and to identify management requirements which will protect the 
integrity of the system (CENTRAL THEME: Education & Outreach).  Drax also 
reserves the right to refuse purchase of fiber if the harvesting method and/or the 
subsequent management plans will threaten the integrity of these high conservation 
value forests (FSC CENTRAL THEME: Procurement Policy). 
 
Procedures and Mitigation Actions: Secondary Feedstock Sourcing
Drax does not have line of sight to individual tracts that provide fiber to secondary 
and tertiary feedstock suppliers, therefore the following mitigations will be applied:
Native Longleaf Pine Systems (Secondary)
For NLPS, 78% of the risk area mapped by FSC is within the Drax supply base.  That
percentage is reduced to 41% when the sourcing characteristics of the actual ranges 
of current secondary and tertiary suppliers is considered. Low level mitigation is 
deemed appropriate.
The areas at risk have been identified by FSC at county/parish level.  Education and 
outreach will be the main method of mitigation for residual suppliers who’s sourcing 
area intersects FSC identified risk areas.  The desired outcome of these 
communications is engaging landowners, foresters, and loggers in conservation of 
Native Longleaf Pine systems.   
 
FSC CENTRAL THEME: Education & Outreach is the primary mitigation option.  
Drax has engaged the Longleaf Alliance in the development of educational 
materials.  Drax also supports the annual Longleaf Alliance conference.  The areas 
that potentially have NLPS have been mapped by FSC and integrated into Drax’s 
GIS system.  Educational materials are distributed to suppliers that touch identified 
specified risk areas.  Educational materials have been developed to engage 
landowners, foresters, and loggers in conservation of this forest system. Drax also 
actively supports workshops and learning exchanges focused on encouraging 
proactive management of longleaf pine in the supply area. Plans are to distribute 
additional educational materials the Longleaf Alliance has already developed and 
investigate other opportunities for engaging in regional LL conservation initiatives 
including landowner workshops. 
Late Successional Bottomland Hardwoods (Secondary)
FSC CENTRAL THEME: Education & Outreach is the primary mitigation option.  As 
Drax primarily sources southern yellow pine, Late Successional Bottomland 
Hardwoods are mainly an issue for residual suppliers who process hardwoods and 
are proximate to LSBH areas. The areas that potentially have NLPS have been 
mapped by FSC and integrated into Drax’s GIS system.  Educational materials, 
developed in partnership with the Forest Stewards Guild, are distributed to suppliers 
that touch identified specified risk areas. Educational materials have been developed 
to engage landowners, foresters, and loggers in conservation of this forest system. 
Drax also actively supports Forest Stewards Guild workshops and learning 
exchanges focused on improving the management of bottomland hardwoods and 
helps fund the development of management plans for private landowners.  
Southern Appalachian Critical Biodiversity Area (Secondary)
Central Appalachian Critical Biodiversity Area (Secondary)
Mesophytic Cove Sites  (Secondary)
Drax’s source area overlap with these three somewhat similar FSC risk types varies 
greatly.

Drax recognizes the Central and Critical Biodiversity Areas and Mesophytic Cove 
Sites as specified risks within the wider supply area.  The Central Appalachian CBA 
and the Mesophytic Cove specified risks are at the edges of Drax residual sourcing 
area, and thus pose a very low risk.  Education and outreach is the mitigation tool 
employed (FSC CENTRAL THEME: Education & Outreach).  As described for the 
risks above, these materials have been developed according to best available 
science and be adapted as new information and approaches come available (i.e., 
through FSC CW Regional meetings).   This educational material is aimed at 
increasing awareness of the sensitivities and unique nature of these CBAs and cove 
sites in hopes of increasing conservation of these highly biodiverse areas. The 
Southern Appalachian CBA poses a medium risk with the acquisition of the Alabama 
Pellet Plants therefore, Drax is adding Conservation Initiatives (FSC CENTRAL 
THEME: Conservation Initiatives) to the educational and outreach materials 
mentioned above to the mitigation tools to be employed for this specified risk.
Cape Fear Arch Critical Biodiversity Area  (Secondary)Drax recognizes the Cape 
Fear Arch Critical Biodiversity Area as specified risk within the wider supply area.  
This specified risk comprises a small region in the Drax residual sourcing area. 
Although 100% of the risk area mapped by FSC is within the Drax supply base, that 
percentage is reduced to 0% when the sourcing characteristics of the actual ranges 
of current secondary and tertiary suppliers is considered. Low level mitigation is 
deemed appropriate. 
The primary concerns are for Pocosins and for longleaf pine habitats.  Both have 
widespread protections or conservation measures in place, and thus pose a very low 
risk.  Pocosins are a wetland type that is protected by BMPs.  Longleaf pine is 
subject to a widespread and increasingly effective landscape conservation 
movement.  To further support these positive factors Drax has selected Education 
and outreach are the mitigation tool (FSC CENTRAL THEME: Education & Outreach)
to address this risk if sourcing begins in this area.  As described for the risks above, 
these materials have been developed according to best available science and be 
adapted as new information and approaches come available (i.e., through FSC CW 
Regional meetings).  This educational material is aimed at increasing awareness of 
the sensitivities and unique nature of these CBAs in hopes of increasing conservation
of these highly biodiverse areas.
Florida Panhandle Critical Biodiversity Area  (Secondary)
Drax recognizes the Florida Panhandle Critical Biodiversity Area as specified risk 
within the wider supply area.  Although 100% of the risk area mapped by FSC is 
within the Drax supply base, that percentage is reduced to <1% when the sourcing 
characteristics of the actual ranges of current secondary and tertiary suppliers is 
considered. Many of the biodiversity elements are already protected by BMPs or by 
the Longleaf Pine conservation efforts previously described.
“This concentration of biodiversity is driven by the river systems (particularly the 
Apalachicola River), longleaf pine savanna habitat and unique steephead ravines.” 
Source: FSC US Controlled Wood Regional Meeting Report. Southeast & Mississippi
Alluvial Valley Regions. Atlanta, GA.  July 31, 2018.To further support these positive 
factors Drax has selected FSC CENTRAL THEME Education & Outreach as the 
mitigation tool to address this risk if sourcing begins in this area.  As described for the
risks above, these materials have been developed according to best available 
science and be adapted as new information and approaches come available (i.e., 
through FSC CW Regional meetings).  This educational material is aimed at 
increasing awareness of the sensitivities and unique nature of these CBAs in hopes 
of increasing conservation of these highly biodiverse areas.
 
The mitigations described above are sufficient to bring the risk of non-compliance 
with this requirement to “low”.

Finding
·         The FSC US National Risk assessment has identified ten “specified risks” 
within Drax’s sourcing area that pertain to species and ecological communities. They 
include Native Longleaf Pine Systems, Late Successional Bottomland Hardwoods, 
Dusky Gopher Frog, Southern Appalachian Critical Biodiversity Area, Central 
Appalachian Critical Biodiversity Area, Cape Fear Arch Critical Biodiversity Area, 
Florida Panhandle Critical Biodiversity Area, Cheoah Bald Salamander, Patch Nose 
Salamander, and Mesophytic Cove Sites. Drax recognizes this multi-stakeholder 
effort to identify “specified risks” related to forest sourcing and has therefore accepted
these risks as such.
·         Drax recognizes that there are additional species and natural communities, not
elevated to FSC “specified risk” classification, which must be considered when 
reviewing the robustness of regional biodiversity protections. A review of the existing 
mechanisms in place to protect these additional species and natural community was 
conducted by Drax and is detailed in Means of Verification section below. 

State wildlife and forestry agencies have state level action plans in place to 
guide conservation of biodiversity. 

Every state Drax sources from has an established Natural Heritage program 
responsible for collecting data on species occurrence within the state. These 
species records feed up into the NatureServe system. Natural Heritage and 
Nature Serve data is used by the forest industry to guide protection of 
species and natural communities of concern. 

There are established “best practices” which are utilized to maintain and 
improve wildlife habitat in the southern US. These techniques are promoted 
by state wildlife and forestry agencies, forestry and wildlife extension 
programs, federal cost share programs, and forest certification standards 
(I.e. SFI and ATFS). 
 
Means of
Verification
·         State agencies have a number of controls in place to identify and protect 
species and natural communities. These state agencies work in concert with the 
Natural Heritage Programs in their respective states (a part of the NatureServe 
network) to continuously monitor and inventory natural diversity in the states. Both 
State Wildlife Actions Plans as well as state Forest Action Plans are required for 
states to receive Federal Funding. These plans, drafted through multi-stakeholder 
participation, identify key wildlife and forestry concerns within the state and provide 
detailed plans on how to approach them. Natural Heritage data, as well as State 
Wildlife Action Plans, are available for private use.


Established best practices are promoted by state agencies, forest 
certification standards, and in forest plans required for federal cost share.  
Some examples of best practices include, but are not limited to, protection of:
o
Stand level diversity through retention of Streamside Management 
Zones (SMZs), snags, coarse and fine woody debris/brush piles, 
irregular stand boundaries, development and enhancement of forest 
“edges”, protection of nesting trees, protection of isolated wetlands 
and springs etc.
o
Landscape level diversity by promoting a mosaic of stand ages and 
types, considering the timing and juxtaposition of harvests for 
hardwood management

The forest products industry participates directly in the development of the 
State Wildlife Action Plans, and state efforts to protect and identify species 
and communities of concern. For example, Drax purchases a data license 
from NatureServe annually. NatureServe then provides Drax with shapefiles 
for all known species and communities of concern. This data is integrated 
into Drax’s mapping system which is used to screen all harvests where Drax 
is receiving fiber directly from the woods. The use of NatureServe data, and 
the protection of species and communities deemed globally critically 
imperilled (G1) or globally imperilled (G2), is required by all participants of 
the Sustainable Forestry Initiative (SFI). Drax sources from landowners 
certified to the SFI Forest Management Standard and from sawmills that are 
certified to the SFI Fiber Sourcing Standard (note Drax is certified to this 
Standard as well). The map below illustrates the influence of the SFI Fiber 
Sourcing Program on the protection of biological diversity during sourcing.
 
·         In addition to State Wildlife Action Plans and Natural Heritage Data, the federal
Endangered Species Act (ESA) and Federal Clean Water Act are very strong 
regulatory mechanisms which are in place to reduce the risk of further biodiversity 
loss. These regulations bring with them significant civil and criminal penalties (i.e. up 
to 1 year imprisonment for ESA violation and $54,000/day for CWA violation). 
o    The ESA prohibits not only direct “take” but can also deem habitat alteration as a 
“taking”. The ESA can restrict forest management on both private and public lands. 
Habitat Conservation Agreements (HCPs), Safe Harbor Agreements, and Candidate 
Conservation Agreements are among the tools provided to a landowner who wishes 
to actively manage their forest in areas where threatened or endangered species, 
highly sensitive to forest alteration, exist. The red-cockaded woodpecker, and the 
Louisiana pine snake are two species currently being managed with these 
mechanisms in Drax’s sourcing area. For some species Critical Habitat has been 
designated, a further assurance that federally listed species are protected (i.e. 
gopher frog in Drax sourcing area). 
o    Clean Water Act protections are extremely relevant to the protection of 
biodiversity. States have been granted the authority to develop programs to address 
nonpoint source pollution from forestry operations. These state “Best Management 
Programs” have been recognized by the USFWS in recent listing rules as a means of
ensuring species protection. For example, the Pearl darter listing rule described 
positive effects of BMPs as follows: “Nonpoint source pollution is a localized threat to 
the pearl darter within the drainage and is more prevalent in areas where certified 
best management practices (BMPs) are not utilized. The use of certified BMPs during
land-altering activities can greatly reduce impacts to water quality. Certified BMPs, 
currently implemented by the forestry industry (e.g., Sustainable Forestry Initiative, 
Forest Stewardship Council, and American Tree Farm System), are helping to 
minimize or eliminate non-point source pollution during forestry activities. The 
Mississippi Forestry Commission (2016, entire) reports certified BMP implementation 
rates to be high in Mississippi for forestry activities, primarily due to the efforts of 
State forestry agencies and forest certification programs (Schilling and Wigley 2015, 
pp 3–7)” (82 Fed Reg 43889).
§  In the southeastern US, the Southern Group of State Foresters has introduced a 
framework to standardize BMP monitoring efforts among the 13 states. According to 
a 2018 report summarizing rates of BMP implementation, all states in the region were
in conformance with the framework. Furthermore, 67 state-wide monitoring surveys 
have been conducted since its initial development in 1997 and 23 surveys were 
conducted in the last six years. Combining all BMP categories in all states and using 
only the most recent state survey data reported, average overall BMP implementation
for the region was 93.6%, up from 92% in 2012. 
(https://www.southernforests.org/resources/publications/SGSF%20Water%20BMP%
20Report%20FINAL.pdf/view).
-       BMP implementation rates in the states that Drax sources from are as follows:
-       MS- Overall 95%
-       Mississippi 2019 BMP Implementation Survey
-       LA- Overall 89% (according to 2015 survey data reported in SGSF report, 2009 
is most recent state-level report publicly available.)
-       Louisiana 2009 BMP Implementation Survey
-       AR- Overall 93 %

§  As described above, a structured BMP program has been in place in the southern 
US for over two decades. In this same time period, the forest industry has embraced 
the Sustainable Forestry Initiative (est. 1994) which has championed BMP 
implementation through its trained logger requirements as well as the protection of 
biodiversity, requiring protection of G1 and G2 species (many of which are not 
federally listed). Furthermore, the State Wildlife Action Planning Process is now in its 
15th year (State Wildlife Action Plans in place since 2005, Forest Action Plans in 
place since 2010). These industry-wide protections in place for protection of 
biological diversity can be considered standard practice as well as an industry 
expectation. Drax contractually requires implementation of BMPs and has a program 
to verify implementation of BMPs as well as biodiversity protections.
 
·         In addition to the Endangered Species Act and Federal Clean Water Act, there 
are other international treaties and conventions to which the US is a signatory.  
These include the Convention on Nature Protection and Wild Life Preservation in the 
Western Hemisphere (Washington, DC, 1940), Convention on Wetlands of 
International Importance Especially as Waterfowl Habitat (Ramsar, Iran, 2 Feb 1971),
Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species of Wild Fauna and Flora 
(CITES) (Washington DC, 1973), International Plant Protection Convention (IPPC) 
(1979 Revised Text) (Rome, Italy, 1979), Convention on the Conservation of 
Migratory Species of Wild Animals (Bonn, Germany, 23 Jun 1979). These high-level 
treaties provide biodiversity protections and direct conservation efforts (i.e. 
identification of Ramsar sites detailed in Indicator 2.1.1).

Drax’s procedures and mitigation approach is somewhat different for primary and 
secondary feedstock sourcing.  
 
Procedures and Mitigation Actions: Primary Feedstock Sourcing
Only two of the specified risks are relevant to Drax’s primary sourcing of roundwood 
and in-woods chips, Native Longleaf Pine Systems (NLPS), and Late Successional 
Bottomland Hardwoods (LSBH).
Native Longleaf Pine Systems (Primary)
NLPS are described as “fire-dependent systems include longleaf pine as the 
dominant tree, a conspicuous lack of mid-story trees and shrubs, and a well-
developed, diverse ground layer (dominated by bunch grasses and other flowering 
plants)”.  In the Drax primary supply areas existing NLPS are not at significant risk   
because the vast majority:
1.     are managed to maintain and perpetuate these systems, and 
2.     are owned by federal or state agencies and conservation-oriented organizations
with the mandate and means to implement conservation-forestry practices.
 
Late Successional Bottomland Hardwoods  (Primary)
LSBH is a very small risk due to the fact that Drax sources primarily southern yellow 
pine, with a de minimis amount (chip content is estimated as 0.26 % hardwood) of in-
woods chip material which may contain hardwood.  Low level mitigation is deemed 
appropriate
*Note - a further safeguard for the protection of LSBH is the commitment that Drax 
has made to not utilize material from cypress tupelo ecosystems in the production of 
wood pellets.
Drax Practices to Avoid Harm and Mitigate Risk in Primary Sourcing
Current procurement procedures and processes mitigate the risk of sourcing fiber in 
a manner that would threaten NLPS and LSBH forests (FSC CENTRAL THEME:

Procedures and Mitigation Actions: Secondary Feedstock Sourcing
Drax does not have line of sight to individual tracts that provide fiber to secondary 
and tertiary feedstock suppliers, therefore the following mitigations will be applied:
Native Longleaf Pine Systems (Secondary)
For NLPS, 78% of the risk area mapped by FSC is within the Drax supply base.  That
percentage is reduced to 41% when the sourcing characteristics of the actual ranges 
of current secondary and tertiary suppliers is considered. Low level mitigation is

FSC CENTRAL THEME: Education & Outreach is the primary mitigation option.  
Drax has engaged the Longleaf Alliance in the development of educational 
materials.  Drax also supports the annual Longleaf Alliance conference.  The areas 
that potentially have NLPS have been mapped by FSC and integrated into Drax’s 
GIS system.  Educational materials are distributed to suppliers that touch identified 
specified risk areas.  Educational materials have been developed to engage 
landowners, foresters, and loggers in conservation of this forest system. Drax also 
actively supports workshops and learning exchanges focused on encouraging 
proactive management of longleaf pine in the supply area. Plans are to distribute 
additional educational materials the Longleaf Alliance has already developed and 
investigate other opportunities for engaging in regional LL conservation initiatives 
including landowner workshops. 
Late Successional Bottomland Hardwoods (Secondary)
FSC CENTRAL THEME: Education & Outreach is the primary mitigation option.  As 
Drax primarily sources southern yellow pine, Late Successional Bottomland 
Hardwoods are mainly an issue for residual suppliers who process hardwoods and 
are proximate to LSBH areas. The areas that potentially have NLPS have been 
mapped by FSC and integrated into Drax’s GIS system.  Educational materials, 
developed in partnership with the Forest Stewards Guild, are distributed to suppliers 
that touch identified specified risk areas. Educational materials have been developed 
to engage landowners, foresters, and loggers in conservation of this forest system. 
Drax also actively supports Forest Stewards Guild workshops and learning 
exchanges focused on improving the management of bottomland hardwoods and 
helps fund the development of management plans for private landowners.  
Dusky Gopher Frog Critical Habitat (Secondary)
FSC CENTRAL THEME: Education & Outreach is the primary mitigation option.  FSC
identifies two small areas at the extreme south of Drax’s sourcing area which are 
only of relevance to residual sourcing.  These areas are under Federal Critical 
Habitat protections.  FSC has identified education and outreach as a mitigation 
option for the DGF. Drax has only four suppliers having this risk within their potential 
sourcing area.  Drax provides educational materials developed by the USFWS to the 
suppliers which have the potential to source from the FSC identified risk areas.  
Educational materials are informed by the best available science and adapted as 
new information and/or approaches become available. The desired outcome of these 
communications is engaging landowners, foresters, and loggers in conservation of 
DGF populations.

Drax recognizes the Central and Critical Biodiversity Areas and Mesophytic Cove 
Sites as specified risks within the wider supply area.  The Central Appalachian CBA 
and the Mesophytic Cove specified risks are at the edges of Drax residual sourcing 
area, and thus pose a very low risk.  Education and outreach is the mitigation tool 
employed (FSC CENTRAL THEME: Education & Outreach).  As described for the 
risks above, these materials have been developed according to best available 
science and be adapted as new information and approaches come available (i.e., 
through FSC CW Regional meetings).   This educational material is aimed at 
increasing awareness of the sensitivities and unique nature of these CBAs and cove 
sites in hopes of increasing conservation of these highly biodiverse areas. The 
Southern Appalachian CBA poses a medium risk with the acquisition of the Alabama 
Pellet Plants therefore, Drax is adding Conservation Initiatives (FSC CENTRAL 
THEME: Conservation Initiatives) to the educational and outreach materials 
mentioned above to the mitigation tools to be employed for this specified risk.
Cape Fear Arch Critical Biodiversity Area  (Secondary)Drax recognizes the Cape 
Fear Arch Critical Biodiversity Area as specified risk within the wider supply area.  
This specified risk comprises a small region in the Drax residual sourcing area. 
Although 100% of the risk area mapped by FSC is within the Drax supply base, that 
percentage is reduced to 0% when the sourcing characteristics of the actual ranges 
of current secondary and tertiary suppliers is considered. Low level mitigation is 
deemed appropriate. 
The primary concerns are for Pocosins and for longleaf pine habitats.  Both have 
widespread protections or conservation measures in place, and thus pose a very low 
risk.  Pocosins are a wetland type that is protected by BMPs.  Longleaf pine is 
subject to a widespread and increasingly effective landscape conservation 
movement.  To further support these positive factors Drax has selected Education 
and outreach are the mitigation tool (FSC CENTRAL THEME: Education & Outreach)
to address this risk if sourcing begins in this area.  As described for the risks above, 
these materials have been developed according to best available science and be 
adapted as new information and approaches come available (i.e., through FSC CW 
Regional meetings).  This educational material is aimed at increasing awareness of 
the sensitivities and unique nature of these CBAs in hopes of increasing conservation
of these highly biodiverse areas.
Florida Panhandle Critical Biodiversity Area  (Secondary)
Drax recognizes the Florida Panhandle Critical Biodiversity Area as specified risk 
within the wider supply area.  Although 100% of the risk area mapped by FSC is 
within the Drax supply base, that percentage is reduced to <1% when the sourcing 
characteristics of the actual ranges of current secondary and tertiary suppliers is 
considered. Many of the biodiversity elements are already protected by BMPs or by 
the Longleaf Pine conservation efforts previously described.
“This concentration of biodiversity is driven by the river systems (particularly the 
Apalachicola River), longleaf pine savanna habitat and unique steephead ravines.” 
Source: FSC US Controlled Wood Regional Meeting Report. Southeast & Mississippi
Alluvial Valley Regions. Atlanta, GA.  July 31, 2018.To further support these positive 
factors Drax has selected FSC CENTRAL THEME Education & Outreach as the 
mitigation tool to address this risk if sourcing begins in this area.  As described for the
risks above, these materials have been developed according to best available 
science and be adapted as new information and approaches come available (i.e., 
through FSC CW Regional meetings).  This educational material is aimed at 
increasing awareness of the sensitivities and unique nature of these CBAs in hopes 
of increasing conservation of these highly biodiverse areas.
Cheoah Bald Salamander  (Secondary)
Drax recognizes the Cheoah Bald Salamander as specified risk within the wider 
supply area.  This salamander is known to exist only on Federal land at the extreme 
edges of Drax residual sourcing area, and thus pose a very low risk.  Drax has 
selected FSC CENTRAL THEME Education & Outreach as the mitigation tool 
employed.  As described for the risks above, these materials have been developed 
according to best available science and be adapted as new information and 
approaches come available (i.e., through FSC CW Regional meetings).  This 
educational material is aimed at increasing awareness of the sensitivities and unique 
nature of this species.
Patch-nosed Salamander (Secondary)
Drax recognizes the Patch-nosed Salamander as specified risk within the wider 
supply area.  Although 100% of the risk area mapped by FSC is within the Drax 
supply base, that percentage is reduced to <1% when the sourcing characteristics of 
the actual ranges of current secondary and tertiary suppliers is considered. This 
salamander is known to exist only in a small portion (about 5,000 acres) of several 
counties of the Drax residual sourcing area.  The salamander is known to inhabit 
small streams in narrow, steep-walled ravines.  Because these sites are protected by 
BMPs and not likely to be impacted by logging there is a very low risk.  Drax has 
selected FSC CENTRAL THEME Education & Outreach as the mitigation tool 
employed.   As described for the risks above, these materials have been developed 
according to best available science and be adapted as new information and 
approaches come available (i.e., through FSC CW Regional meetings).  This 
educational material is aimed at increasing awareness of the sensitivities and unique 
nature of this species.
 
The mitigations described above are sufficient to bring the risk of non-compliance 
with this requirement to “low”.

o    Mississippi – “SLASH DISPERSAL Slash is the debris such as unmerchantable 
limbs and tree tops created in the process of a normal logging operation. Slash 
dispersal is probably the most immediate solution for prevention of soil movement on 
an active logging site. Wherever possible slash should be scattered back over 
exposed soil on skid trails and evenly dispersed across logging sets. Slash has also 
been used successfully to build water bars on skid trails.”

The BP has implemented appropriate control systems and procedures to verify that 
negative impacts on ground water, surface water and water downstream from forest 
management are minimised (CPET S5b).
Finding
·         The Clean Water Act (CWA) is the primary federal law in the United States 
governing water pollution. Its objective is to restore and maintain the chemical, 
physical, and biological integrity of the nation's waters. The CWA provisions that are 
most significant to forestry are section 319 addressing non-point pollution and section
404 addressing discharge of dredge and fill into waterways and wetlands. States 
have developed Best Management Programs (BMPs) to meet the CWA. EPA has 
recently reviewed state oversight and effectiveness of BMP programs and found 
them to be successful in controlling non-point pollution. The EPA has direct oversight 
over section dredge and fill violations (section 404). 
·         Forest certification makes BMP compliance mandatory for program 
participants (SFI, ATFS, FSC). Drax sources a significant proportion of fiber from 
certified lands and is certified to the SFI Fiber Sourcing program that requires all 
loggers delivering fiber to the pellet plant to be trained and comply with all BMPs. 
·         SFI partners with state forestry commissions to conduct logger training on 
BMP's. Trained loggers help ensure that water quality is maintained and protected on
certified and non-certified lands.
·         SFI’s State Implementation Committees (SICs) regularly review and 
investigate public BMP complaints received via their inconsistent practices procedure
and alert consuming mills of bad performers.
·         Many studies have been conducted on BMP effectiveness to reduce non-point 
pollution from Forestry operations 
 
Means of
Verification
·         States use CWA section 319 funds to implement Best Management 
Practices for forestry established in each jurisdiction and monitored to achieve 
compliance to the federal Clean Water Act. Forestry is considered a non-point source
of pollution under the federal Clean Water Act (CWA). Under the CWA states are 
directed to develop programs to minimize and avoid non-point source pollution. 
States have developed Best Management Practice, or “BMP” programs to achieve 
this. BMP programs are generally administered by the state forestry commission in 
partnership with the state department of environmental quality (which generally acts 
as the enforcement agency). States are allowed to develop independent approaches,
but in the south, the Southern Group of State Foresters (SGSF) has introduced a 
framework to standardize BMP monitoring efforts among the 13 states. 
 
According to a 2018 SGSF report, which summarized rates of BMP implementation, 
all states in Drax’s region were in conformance with the framework. Combining all 
BMP categories in all states and using only the most recent state survey data 
reported, average overall BMP implementation for the region was 93.6%, up from 
92% 
in2012.(https://www.southernforests.org/resources/publications/SGSF%20Water%20
BMP%20Report%20FINAL.pdf/view).
BMP implementation rates in the states that Drax sources from are as follows:
MS- Overall 95%
Mississippi 2019 BMP Implementation Survey
LA- Overall 89% (according to 2015 survey data reported in SGSF report, 2009 is 
most recent state-level report publicly available.)

·         A structured BMP program has been in place in the southern US for over two 
decades, with 67 state-wide monitoring surveys conducted since 1997. The 
Sustainable Forestry Initiative (established 1994) has championed BMP 
implementation, making compliance mandatory for continued certification. Logger 
training curriculums are developed and administered jointly by SFI Implementation 
Committees, state forestry commissions, and state forestry associations. See links to
state BMP training programs below.

·         SFI State Implementation Committees have active Inconsistent Practices 
Committees that deal with reported BMP violations. This SIC involvement is 
extremely effective because mills certified to the SFI Fiber Sourcing Standard can 
immediately stop purchasing fiber from an offending supplier until the issue is 
remedied. This direct action taken by receiving mills generally addresses the problem
so there is not a need to elevate to the regulatory agency.  In 2019 MS had 13 issues
investigated through the Inconsistent Practices Committee, LA had 6 and AR had 13. 
No issues were elevated to the regulatory agency (Department of Environmental 
Quality: MDEQ, LDEQ, ADEQ respectively). 
·         The EPA has a framework for imposing penalties.  See the following link 
related to section 404: https://www.epa.gov/sites/production/files/2015-
07/documents/2001_sec_404_penalty_policy.pdf
Drax, and other wood using facilities certified to the SFI Standard, ensure a 
significant proportion of the forest landscape is implementing BMPs to protect water 
quality. Drax contractually requires the implementation of state BMPs and has a 
program to verify BMP implementation. A study conducted by Dwivedi et al. in 2018 
found that BMP implementation rate was 2% higher in sites located within 65 miles of
mills certified to the SFI Fiber Sourcing standard 
(https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S1389934118300807)
 
·         A literature review by Cristan et al. in 2016 reviewed the effectiveness of 
forestry BMPs in the United States – “The literature indicates that forestry BMPs 
protect water quality when constructed correctly and in adequate numbers. Forestry 
BMP effectiveness studies allow state forestry BMP programs to evaluate progress in
reducing non-point source pollution and achieving water quality goals established 
under the Clean Water Act (CWA).” The following link provides a good description of 
how forestry is regulated under the CWA:

·         Technical Bulletin 966 (September 2009) issued by the National Council for Air 
and Stream Improvement (NCASI) reported high levels of compliance with water 
quality laws and BMP requirements across the U.S https://www.ncasi.org/wp-
content/uploads/2019/02/tb966.pdf
In 2016 the EPA was forced to re-evaluate the efficacy of state BMP programs in a 
response to a lawsuit challenging BMP effectiveness at controlling sedimentation and
runoff from forest roads. Following an evaluation of state BMP programs, the EPA 
decided it was still not necessary to regulate discharges from forest roads under the 
CWA Section 402 (NPDES) point source regulatory provisions. The EPA found that 
state BMP programs adequately addressed forest roads and that monitoring efforts 
were highly effective, therefore there was no need to enforcing a new federal 
regulatory program. https://www.epa.gov/npdes/forest-roads

General Permits (PGPs) https://www.epa.gov/npdes/pesticide-permitting. State 
permits are unique but in general they require the development of application plans, 
accurate record keeping, and conformance with a set of criteria for “All Operators”.

Drax implements the mandatory Control Measure 3.1 for Category 3 specified risks.  
This Control Measures is defined in the FSC US Controlled Wood National Risk 
Assessment (Appendix B of this document).  As specified by the mandatory Control 
Measure, Drax implements mitigation actions identified during the collaborative 
dialogue at the Controlled Wood Regional Meetings and detailed in the Controlled 
Wood Regional Meeting Report, available at: https://us.fsc.org/en-
us/certification/controlled-wood/fsc-us-controlled-wood-national-risk-assessment-us-
nra.
Procedures and Mitigation Actions: Primary Feedstock Sourcing
Only two of the specified risks are relevant to Drax’s primary sourcing of roundwood 
and in-woods chips, Native Longleaf Pine Systems (NLPS), and Late Successional 
Bottomland Hardwoods (LSBH).
Native Longleaf Pine Systems (Primary)
NLPS are described as “fire-dependent systems include longleaf pine as the 
dominant tree, a conspicuous lack of mid-story trees and shrubs, and a well-
developed, diverse ground layer (dominated by bunch grasses and other flowering 
plants)”.  In the Drax primary supply areas existing NLPS are not at significant risk   
because the vast majority:
1.     are managed to maintain and perpetuate these systems, and 
2.     are owned by federal or state agencies and conservation-oriented organizations
with the mandate and means to implement conservation-forestry practices.
 
Late Successional Bottomland Hardwoods  (Primary)
LSBH is a very small risk due to the fact that Drax sources primarily southern yellow 
pine, with a de minimis amount (chip content is estimated as 0.26 % hardwood) of in-
woods chip material which may contain hardwood.  Low level mitigation is deemed 
appropriate
*Note - a further safeguard for the protection of LSBH is the commitment that Drax 
has made to not utilize material from cypress tupelo ecosystems in the production of 
wood pellets.
Drax Practices to Avoid Harm and Mitigate Risk in Primary Sourcing
Current procurement procedures and processes mitigate the risk of sourcing fiber in 
a manner that would threaten NLPS and LSBH forests (FSC CENTRAL THEME: 
Procurement Policy).  These primary feedstock controls, embedded in Drax’s internal
processes, are subject to monitoring and internal audit.  Drax has integrated the FSC
HCV maps into its GIS system and Rapid Risk Assessment process and actively 
screens all tracts for sensitivities.  In addition, Drax requires comprehensive forest 
cover type and species information be provided during source set-up which allows 
stands to be assessed for the potential of sourcing from longleaf pine or hardwood 
systems.  If a risk is identified, then Drax has an opportunity provide educational 
mitigation materials and to identify management requirements which will protect the 
integrity of the system (CENTRAL THEME: Education & Outreach).  Drax also 
reserves the right to refuse purchase of fiber if the harvesting method and/or the 
subsequent management plans will threaten the integrity of these high conservation 
value forests (FSC CENTRAL THEME: Procurement Policy). 
 
Procedures and Mitigation Actions: Secondary Feedstock Sourcing
Drax does not have line of sight to individual tracts that provide fiber to secondary 
and tertiary feedstock suppliers, therefore the following mitigations will be applied:
Native Longleaf Pine Systems (Secondary)
For NLPS, 78% of the risk area mapped by FSC is within the Drax supply base.  That
percentage is reduced to 41% when the sourcing characteristics of the actual ranges 
of current secondary and tertiary suppliers is considered. Low level mitigation is 
deemed appropriate.
The areas at risk have been identified by FSC at county/parish level.  Education and 
outreach will be the main method of mitigation for residual suppliers who’s sourcing 
area intersects FSC identified risk areas.  The desired outcome of these 
communications is engaging landowners, foresters, and loggers in conservation of 
Native Longleaf Pine systems.   
 
FSC CENTRAL THEME: Education & Outreach is the primary mitigation option.  
Drax has engaged the Longleaf Alliance in the development of educational 
materials.  Drax also supports the annual Longleaf Alliance conference.  The areas 
that potentially have NLPS have been mapped by FSC and integrated into Drax’s 
GIS system.  Educational materials are distributed to suppliers that touch identified 
specified risk areas.  Educational materials have been developed to engage 
landowners, foresters, and loggers in conservation of this forest system. Drax also 
actively supports workshops and learning exchanges focused on encouraging 
proactive management of longleaf pine in the supply area. Plans are to distribute 
additional educational materials the Longleaf Alliance has already developed and 
investigate other opportunities for engaging in regional LL conservation initiatives 
including landowner workshops. 
Late Successional Bottomland Hardwoods (Secondary)
FSC CENTRAL THEME: Education & Outreach is the primary mitigation option.  As 
Drax primarily sources southern yellow pine, Late Successional Bottomland 
Hardwoods are mainly an issue for residual suppliers who process hardwoods and 
are proximate to LSBH areas. The areas that potentially have NLPS have been 
mapped by FSC and integrated into Drax’s GIS system.  Educational materials, 
developed in partnership with the Forest Stewards Guild, are distributed to suppliers 
that touch identified specified risk areas. Educational materials have been developed 
to engage landowners, foresters, and loggers in conservation of this forest system. 
Drax also actively supports Forest Stewards Guild workshops and learning 
exchanges focused on improving the management of bottomland hardwoods and 
helps fund the development of management plans for private landowners.  
Southern Appalachian Critical Biodiversity Area (Secondary)
Central Appalachian Critical Biodiversity Area (Secondary)
Mesophytic Cove Sites  (Secondary)
Drax’s source area overlap with these three somewhat similar FSC risk types varies 
greatly.

Drax recognizes the Central and Critical Biodiversity Areas and Mesophytic Cove 
Sites as specified risks within the wider supply area.  The Central Appalachian CBA 
and the Mesophytic Cove specified risks are at the edges of Drax residual sourcing 
area, and thus pose a very low risk.  Education and outreach is the mitigation tool 
employed (FSC CENTRAL THEME: Education & Outreach).  As described for the 
risks above, these materials have been developed according to best available 
science and be adapted as new information and approaches come available (i.e., 
through FSC CW Regional meetings).   This educational material is aimed at 
increasing awareness of the sensitivities and unique nature of these CBAs and cove 
sites in hopes of increasing conservation of these highly biodiverse areas. The 
Southern Appalachian CBA poses a medium risk with the acquisition of the Alabama 
Pellet Plants therefore, Drax is adding Conservation Initiatives (FSC CENTRAL 
THEME: Conservation Initiatives) to the educational and outreach materials 
mentioned above to the mitigation tools to be employed for this specified risk.
Cape Fear Arch Critical Biodiversity Area  (Secondary)Drax recognizes the Cape 
Fear Arch Critical Biodiversity Area as specified risk within the wider supply area.  
This specified risk comprises a small region in the Drax residual sourcing area. 
Although 100% of the risk area mapped by FSC is within the Drax supply base, that 
percentage is reduced to 0% when the sourcing characteristics of the actual ranges 
of current secondary and tertiary suppliers is considered. Low level mitigation is 
deemed appropriate. 
The primary concerns are for Pocosins and for longleaf pine habitats.  Both have 
widespread protections or conservation measures in place, and thus pose a very low 
risk.  Pocosins are a wetland type that is protected by BMPs.  Longleaf pine is 
subject to a widespread and increasingly effective landscape conservation 
movement.  To further support these positive factors Drax has selected Education 
and outreach are the mitigation tool (FSC CENTRAL THEME: Education & Outreach)
to address this risk if sourcing begins in this area.  As described for the risks above, 
these materials have been developed according to best available science and be 
adapted as new information and approaches come available (i.e., through FSC CW 
Regional meetings).  This educational material is aimed at increasing awareness of 
the sensitivities and unique nature of these CBAs in hopes of increasing conservation
of these highly biodiverse areas.
Florida Panhandle Critical Biodiversity Area  (Secondary)
Drax recognizes the Florida Panhandle Critical Biodiversity Area as specified risk 
within the wider supply area.  Although 100% of the risk area mapped by FSC is 
within the Drax supply base, that percentage is reduced to <1% when the sourcing 
characteristics of the actual ranges of current secondary and tertiary suppliers is 
considered. Many of the biodiversity elements are already protected by BMPs or by 
the Longleaf Pine conservation efforts previously described.
“This concentration of biodiversity is driven by the river systems (particularly the 
Apalachicola River), longleaf pine savanna habitat and unique steephead ravines.” 
Source: FSC US Controlled Wood Regional Meeting Report. Southeast & Mississippi
Alluvial Valley Regions. Atlanta, GA.  July 31, 2018.To further support these positive 
factors Drax has selected FSC CENTRAL THEME Education & Outreach as the 
mitigation tool to address this risk if sourcing begins in this area.  As described for the
risks above, these materials have been developed according to best available 
science and be adapted as new information and approaches come available (i.e.,

The BP has implemented appropriate control systems and procedures for verifying that 
there is adequate protection of the forest from unauthorised activities, such as illegal 
logging, mining and encroachment (CPET S7c).
Finding
·         According to the FSC US Controlled Wood Risk assessment there is a low risk
of illegal harvesting.

The BP has implemented appropriate control systems and procedures for verifying that 
legal, customary and traditional tenure and use rights of indigenous people and local 
communities related to the forest, are identified, documented and respected (CPET S9).
Finding
·         The FSC Controlled Wood National Risk Assessment for the US has 
determined that there is a “Low Risk” of “wood harvested in violation of traditional 
and human rights”. 
·         US support of UN Indigenous Peoples initiative
·         The legal system in the United States is generally considered fair and efficient 
in resolving conflicts pertaining to traditional rights including use rights, cultural 
interests or traditional cultural identity. There are different mechanisms or processes 
that allow Native American tribes, as well as any private citizen, to deal with 
disagreement and conflict related to decisions affecting natural resources, and 
forests that are considered to be equitable. 
·         Sustainable Forestry and African American Land Retention Program (SFLR) 
focuses on issues associated with African American land ownership. 
·         State of America’s Forest, SAF Figure 4 and 13 displaying distribution of 
landownership showing stable patterns between public and private ownerships. 
·         Today, federal, state, and local governments regulate growth and development 
through statutory law. The majority of controls on land, however, stem from the 
actions of private developers and individuals. 
·         Two major federal laws have been passed in the last half century that limit the 
use of land significantly. These are the National Historic Preservation Act of 1966 
(today embodied in 16 USC. 461 et seq.) and the National Environmental Policy Act 
of 1969 (42 USC. 4321 et seq.).
·         Stakeholder consultation process revealed no concerns expected to affect 
feedstock sourcing
·         Preamble citations including Worldwide Governance Indicators

·         Sustainable Forestry and African American Land Retention Program (SFLR) 
helps to connect African American landowners with established networks of forestry 
support including federal and state government programs.  Title issues and 
ownership disputes are a focus of this initiative.
·           Each jurisdiction has statutory law that governs these elements. Ample case 
law is present demonstrating path of recourse exists for all parties. Each 
jurisdiction, with well governed agencies, enforces these elements that carry civil and
criminal penalties, and administer land use monitoring programs. See table

Finding
·         FSC Controlled Wood National Risk Assessment does not identify conversion 
to non-forest as a risk in Drax’s sourcing area.
·         SBP highlights wetlands and peatlands as sources of high carbon stock that 
should not be either drained or converted. Wetlands are defined by SBP as “Land 
that is covered with or saturated by water, permanently or for a significant part of the 
year”.  Peatlands are specific type of wetland ecosystem where continuous soil 
saturation leads to anaerobic conditions where organic matter is accumulated faster 
than it can be decomposed. 
o    Wetlands with high peat concentration are not a feature of concern on the 
landscape from which Drax sources.  
o    Wetlands with shorter periods of saturation can and do support a component of 
SYP. However, the risk of sourcing from areas which have been “drained or 
converted as of January 2008” is negligible due to CWA restrictions.
·         With the exception of a few protected areas, forests of the southern US have 
all been harvested at least once, often multiple times, reducing the risk of 
encountering high carbon forests.

exemption to the CWA section 404 (f), Recapture Provision “Recapture Provision. 
Section 404(f) exemptions DO NOT APPLY where any discharge of dredged and/or

production of forest products and an increasing forest inventory resulting in 
increasing carbon stocks (USDA Forest Service).

·         Southern Forest Futures reports that: after accounting for harvests, forest 
growth, land use, and climate change, the total carbon pool represented by the 
South’s forests is forecasted to increase slightly from 2010 to 2020/2030 and then 
decline, primarily due to urban encroachment.

·         A study by Richter et al. found that forests increased the carbon in the top 
mineral soils of previously cropped land - Richter, D., Markewitz, D., Trumbore, S. et 
al. Rapid accumulation and turnover of soil carbon in a re-establishing forest. Nature 
400, 56–58 (1999). Forests are important to rebuilding soils on previously cropped 
lands. Much of the southeastern US has been cleared for agriculture at some point 
and most of the managed pine forests are found on previously cropped soils. The 
choice to maintain land in forest or convert from agriculture to forestry is influenced 
by the availability of markets for forest products. In this sense, the biomass market, 
which utilizes low-value fiber, can be considered to help incentivise landowners to 
manage forests important to building and maintaining soil which will help rebuild soil 
carbon and, potentially, help reduce the chances of conversion into cropland which 
causes significant soil C losses.

·         Several studies have investigated the response of soil carbon to harvesting 
and biomass removal. In most instances there is little, if any, change in mineral soil 
carbon. Changes in surface carbon are variable, with harvest often increasing carbon
in the top organic layer initially, and differing (experimental) levels of residual biomass
removal levels being reflected  in changing carbon content of surface soil layers. 
These findings also demonstrate that there are several variables at play including 
climate and decomposition rates. See Indicator 2.2.2 for list of applicable references.
