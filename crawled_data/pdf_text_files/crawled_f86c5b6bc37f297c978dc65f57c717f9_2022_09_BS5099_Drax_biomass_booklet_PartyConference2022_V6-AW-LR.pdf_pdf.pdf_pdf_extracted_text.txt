The role of sustainable 
biomass in delivering 
energy security  
and reaching net zero
A truly renewable power system
The action we all take over the decade ahead  
will decide whether the world tackles the climate 
emergency or falls victim to it.
The backbone of a net zero economy 
will be a zero-carbon power system. 
This means renewable power generation 
must be maximised. Investment in 
technologies such as bioenergy, energy 
storage and hydrogen can balance and 
stabilise the electricity grid and enable 
more intermittent renewables, such as 
wind and solar, to come online.
The UN’s IPCC and the UK’s Committee 
on Climate Change agree that using 
sustainable biomass to generate 
bioenergy is a critical technology in the 
fight against climate change, but only 
when done well.
Sustainable biomass already delivers up 
to 17% of the UK's renewable electricity 
when the system is tight. This is because 
biomass delivers the necessary system 
support services required to maintain  
a stable electricity grid.
The global pandemic has accelerated the 
role technology plays in our lives, at home 
and at work. These changes demand that 
we reduce and remove carbon emissions 
now, while ensuring there are flexible, 
secure energy systems for everyone. It 
is important to support a just transition 
to a green economy where jobs are both 
protected and created.
Alongside carbon emissions reductions, 
negative emissions technologies are 
needed to remove carbon from the 
atmosphere. These technologies will be 
critical to help decarbonise harder-to-
abate sectors such as agriculture and 
aviation so we can meet net zero by 2050 
faster, and even go beyond it – helping 
to lower the carbon concentration in 
the atmosphere.
Drax plays a critical role in supporting UK energy 
security, providing more renewable power for the 
country than the next two generators combined. We're 
investing £2.5bn in enhancing grid stability, boosting 
energy resilience and positioning the UK as a global 
leader in carbon capture and pumped storage hydro. 
Through pioneering green technology and innovation, 
we're helping the UK decarbonise, creating a path to  
net zero and beyond.

Sustainable biomass is classified as a 
renewable source of energy because 
of its short regrowth time and ability to 
keep the carbon cycle in balance. 
At Drax, we believe the right biomass 
requires careful and robust governance 
and traceability, and needs to meet 
the criteria set out by policy makers 
and leading international scientists. 
This will in turn deliver transparent, 
evidence-based, positive outcomes 
for our climate, nature and people.
Sustainable biomass regulation sets 
strict standards for suppliers and end 
users for delivering the right biomass 
and encourages a high standard of 
forest management, which drives a 
breadth of additional societal benefits. 
It also helps reduce the risk of forest 
fires and pest infestation, ultimately 
supporting healthy forests.

What is a biomass pellet and 
what makes it sustainable? 
Biomass is organic matter, like wood or plant material.
Biomass pellets used for bioenergy 
are generally made of low grade or 
low value wood which is a by-product 
of the production of higher-value 
wood products.
Pellets can also be made from the by-
products of active forest management 
and sawmill residues like sawdust. As 
biomass comes from organic, living 
matter, it grows naturally, absorbing 
carbon dioxide (CO2) from the 
atmosphere in the process.

Adding carbon capture and storage 
to power generation from biomass 
(Bioenergy with Carbon Capture and 
Storage – BECCS) delivers negative 
emissions as emissions are captured 
and stored, taking carbon out of the 
atmosphere. Research has found 
that, globally, there is potentially 2-4 
gigatonnes of sustainable biomass 
available per year for BECCS. 
BECCS at Drax will create around 10,000 
new jobs in the UK whilst supporting and 
preserving many more existing roles in 
industries around the world, which would 
otherwise not survive in a net zero future. 
By developing this vital new technology 
needed globally to achieve climate 
commitments, the UK will demonstrate 
a model for accelerating the transition 
away from coal, and be at the forefront 
of a post-covid green recovery.

Levelling up, global leadership 
and a just transition
The successful conversion of Drax Power Station to  
run on sustainable biomass is Europe’s largest single-site 
decarbonisation project.
Sustainably sourced biomass used at 
Drax Power Station in Selby provides a 
scalable case study of a crucial renewable 
source of power that has replaced fossil 
fuels, and is supporting around 6,000 jobs 
across the North of England – at a time 
when other coal fired power stations have 
closed with the loss of thousands of jobs. 
Biomass grown through sustainable 
means is classified as a renewable 
source of energy because of the 
process of its growth.
It means that when biomass is combusted 
as a source of energy – for example for 
heat or electricity production – the CO2 
released is offset by the amount of CO2 
it absorbed from the atmosphere while 
it was growing.

Drax is committed to using fibre from 
actively growing forests. Our Catchment 
Area Analysis (available online at drax.
com/sustainability) provides evidence 
that we are meeting our biomass 
sustainability commitments. This ensures 
that we are delivering a positive impact on 
the climate, nature and the communities 
in each area we source our pellets from.
Data gathering allows us to keep track 
of the carbon storage in the regions 
where we source, including how forests 
are growing and what they are being 
used for. The evidence from our analyses 
demonstrates that Drax’s sourcing 
practices do not cause deforestation, 
forest decline or carbon debt.
Working alongside leading sustainability 
non-profit Earthworm Foundation, 
Drax has also been at the forefront of 
developing a data and evidence-led 
approach – known as Healthy Forest 
Landscapes (HFL) – to measure and 
evaluate source forest health by assessing 
forest cover, carbon stock, biodiversity, 
and community wellbeing. 
HFL gives a clear picture of forest health 
and allows us to obtain the evidence that 
the forests we source from are replanted, 
continue to store carbon, and remain 
biodiverse and healthy while sustaining 
jobs and communities.
By developing this vital new technology 
needed globally to achieve climate 
commitments, the UK will demonstrate 
a model for accelerating the transition 
away from coal at COP26 and beyond, 
and be at the forefront of a post-covid 
green recovery.
Safeguards and  
transparency
Drax biomass complies with stringent standards  
set out in UK and EU law.
The sustainability of our biomass and our 
carbon savings are verified for the UK 
regulator, Ofgem. Drax’s biomass is also 
certified by voluntary schemes such as 
the Sustainable Biomass Program (SBP).
At Drax, we also have our own sustainable 
biomass sourcing policy which goes 
beyond existing regulations and is led by 
science, best practice, and transparency.
In 2019, an Independent Advisory 
Board was established. It comprises 
scientists and forestry experts led by 
former UK Chief Scientific Adviser 
Sir John Beddington to peer review 
Drax’s transition to net zero and our 
use of sustainable biomass. The IAB 
scrutinised Drax’s biomass sustainability 
and found that Its sourcing policy is 
in line with the UK Forest Research 
report  recommendations.

Question
Answer
1
What is biomass?
Biomass is organic matter. In the case of 
bioenergy, it typically refers to agricultural 
by-products and residues, woody waste 
products, and crops and microbes that can 
be used for fuel.
2
How is biomass used?
Biomass, in the form of compressed wood 
pellets, is a low-carbon replacement for 
coal that can be used at power stations 
to generate renewable energy such as 
electricity and heat. The UK, Continental 
Europe and Japan are some of the 
countries that are already using biomass 
as a fuel to generate renewable electricity 
and heat.
3
What is sustainable 
biomass?
Sustainable biomass is made of the 
low grade and low quality by-products 
from the forestry industry that don’t 
negatively impact the growth of the 
forest, the amount of carbon being stored, 
biodiversity and the socioeconomic 
wellbeing of the communities that 
surround them. When used for heat 
and power, sustainable biomass releases 
significantly less carbon dioxide than 
fossil fuels. 
Using forestry residues from harvesting 
also helps reduce the risk of forest fires, 
pests and disease outbreaks in places like 
California where there is very little forest 
management.

Does Drax cause 
carbon debt?
Drax only uses sustainable biomass from 
areas of managed forests which are stable 
or growing at a greater rate than they 
are harvested, such as in the US South, 
where two thirds of our supply is sourced.  
As long as the annual forest harvest 
doesn’t exceed annual growth, switching 
from coal to woody biomass reduces 
atmospheric CO2 over timescales relevant 
to stabilising the climate, the IEA has said.
According to analysis from the US 
Department of Agriculture, US South 
forest stocks have increased by a fifth over 
the past two decades and have almost 
doubled since the 1950s.
According to a report from Forest Europe, 
forest areas have increased by 9% in the 
last 30 years and the volume of wood and 
carbon has increased by 50%.

Where do Drax pellets 
come from?
Areas Drax sources its pellets from 
January 2021 to December 2021 
include USA (64.9%), Canada (15.5%), 
Latvia (9.3%), Estonia (2.8%), Brazil (2.5%), 
Portugal (2.4%), Belarus (1.4%)*, UK 
(0.7%). Russia (0.4%)*, and other European 
countries (0.1%).
8
Are wood pellets 
sustainable long-term 
without subsidies?
Yes, they are – Drax is making good 
progress with our biomass strategy to 
increase our self-supply and reduce the 
costs of our biomass generation to £50/
MWh by 2027, keeping Drax on track to 
continue using biomass when subsidies 
end in 2027.

How is burning wood 
sustainable?
Biomass comes from organic, living matter 
that is in a constant cycle of growth and 
renewal, absorbing carbon dioxide (CO2) 
from the atmosphere in the process. So 
when biomass is used to generate energy 
– such as heat and/or electricity – the CO2 
released is offset by the amount of CO2 
it absorbed from the atmosphere while it 
was growing as well as new growth.
Biomass is a very small part (just 4% in 
the US) of a broader forest products 
industry that includes the harvesting 
of wood for solid wood product sectors 
such as construction, where the use of 
wood reduces the carbon impact in those 
industries as well as locking away the 
carbon for longer.
5
How is shipping pellets 
around the world 
sustainable?
North America is a key supply region 
because of its well managed commercial 
forestry industry, commitment to 
sustainability and good infrastructure. 
The working forests in the US South 
alone are about three times the size 
of the UK and forest stocks have 
almost doubled since the 1950s. 
The UK does not have sufficient forest 
capacity to meet demand and trucking 
pellets from Scotland to Drax Power 
Station would release more CO2 than 
shipping the pellets from the US South.
Drax has a low-carbon supply chain  
for its biomass and is working with its 
partners to further decarbonise the 
supply chain. Drax reports its supply 
chain emissions in its Annual Report, 
which is independently audited. 
* Drax no longer sources biomass from Russia or Belarus, in line with international sanctions brought against Russia due to its war on Ukraine.

How is bioenergy 
renewable?
Sustainable biomass is renewable because 
of the closed carbon cycle created 
when trees grow and take CO2 from the 
atmosphere. Whether the wood is used 
for bioenergy or these trees naturally 
decompose, the same amount of CO2 is 
released into the atmosphere. 
The cycle remains in balance because 
the working forests which supply the 
low-grade wood used for biomass are 
replanted and these growing trees 
absorb more carbon. 
The CO2 released when biomass is used to 
generate power is CO2 which was already 
in the atmosphere and is therefore not 
increasing the amount of carbon dioxide. 
This is different to fossil fuels, which 
release CO2 into the atmosphere which had 
previously been locked away underground 
for millions of years – that’s why fossil 
fuels contribute to climate change and 
sustainable biomass does not.

What certification 
does Drax use?
Drax's biomass complies with stringent 
standards set out in UK and EU law.  
Drax is independently audited by UK 
regulator Ofgem and is required to 
demonstrate that the biomass used  
is sustainably sourced. 
Drax's sustainable biomass sourcing 
policy goes beyond existing regulations 
and is led by science, best practice 
and transparency. We also engage 
with voluntary certification schemes 
and systems such as the Sustainable 
Biomass Program (SBP), Forest 
Stewardship Council (FSC), Sustainable 
Forest Initiative (SFI), among others.

What kinds of feedstocks 
go into the wood pellets 
at Drax?
Drax’s pellets are made from a mix of 
harvesting residues (including tops and 
limbs, low-grade roundwood and the 
by-products of active forest management 
activities such as thinning) and secondary 
residues (such as sawdust). The wood is 
low grade with low commercial value, and 
in some circumstances has a limited or 
unavailable market.
In some regions, such as British Columbia, 
the harvesting residues we would use 
to make biomass pellets to generate 
renewable energy would otherwise be 
burnt on site to reduce the risk of forest 
fires and pest and disease outbreaks. 
As of 2021: 
Sawmill and other wood industry 
residue (38.0%), Branches and tops 
(6.3%), thinnings (16.3%), Low-grade 
roundwood (36.9%), Agricultural 
residues (2.5%).

Doesn’t burning biomass 
produce more emissions 
than burning coal?
Unlike coal, sustainable biomass doesn’t 
add any new CO2 to the atmosphere. 
When sourced sustainably, biomass is in 
a constant cycle of renewal and carbon 
absorption across a landscape. When 
sustainable biomass is used to generate 
renewable electricity, it only releases the 
CO2 that was stored while the trees were 
growing before they were harvested. 
Because the biomass is sustainable, that 
CO2 is already being absorbed by other 
growing forests. Conversely, burning coal 
releases carbon that has been locked 
up for millions of years, increasing the 
amount of new carbon accumulated in 
the atmosphere.
