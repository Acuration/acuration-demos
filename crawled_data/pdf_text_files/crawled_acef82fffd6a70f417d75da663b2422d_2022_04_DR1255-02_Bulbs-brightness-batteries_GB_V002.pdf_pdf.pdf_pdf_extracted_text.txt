Did you know?
At Drax Power Station, we generate electricity and then National 
Grid (with the help of a number of regional organisations) sends it 
to homes and businesses across the country. When this electricity 
leaves the power station, the Voltage is 400,000V – considerably 
more than the average Voltage of the batteries we use in our 
circuits (1.5V each)!
By the time the electricity reaches homes or businesses, the Voltage 
is 230V. This ‘step down’ process occurs when the electricity passes 
through a number of sub stations that reduce the Voltage.
Look out for the cables carrying our electricity 
when you’re out and about – they’re often 
high above our heads, strung from tall metal 
structures called pylons.
We measure the flow of electricity from a 
power source (the battery) in Volts, named 
after the Italian physicist Alessandro Volta. 
The symbol for Volts is V.
As you increase the Voltage on a circuit (e.g. 
by adding another battery into the circuit), 
the brightness of the bulb increases.
