INTRODUCTION  
Overview 
1.1 
Abergelli Power Limited ("APL") proposes to apply for development consent under the 
Planning Act 2008 (“PA 2008”) for a gas fired generating station, with a rated electrical 
output of up to 299 megawatts ("MW"), at Abergelli Farm, near Felindre in Wales.   
1.2 
This document provides information on APL, the applicant for The Abergelli Power (Gas 
Fired Power Station) Order (the "Order"), and the proposed application (the “Application”) 
for development consent to which the Order relates. This document also identifies the suite 
of documents that comprise the Application.  
1.3 
To give an overview of the whole Project, this document also outlines the other elements of 
built development for which consent will not be sought under the terms of the Order, and 
explains how these elements will be consented.  
Project Overview 
1.4 
APL proposes to construct and operate an Open Cycle Gas Turbine (“OCGT”) peaking 
power generating station (the "Power Generation Plant") and new connections to the gas 
and electricity networks on land adjacent to the Felindre Gas Compressor Station at 
Abergelli Farm, Felindre, Swansea SA5 7NN (the “Project”).   
1.5 
APL's project is split into three different elements which are described below, which together 
form the "Project".  These elements are referred to as the Power Generation Plant, the Gas 
Connection, and the Electrical Connection. 
1.6 
The three main elements of the Project comprise:  
• 
An Open Cycle Gas Turbine (OCGT) peaking power generating station, fuelled by 
natural gas and capable of providing a rated electrical output of up to 299 Megawatts 
(MW). The Power Generation Plant comprises: 
• 
Generating Equipment including one Gas Turbine Generator with one 
exhaust gas flue stack and Balance of Plant (BOP) (together referred to as 
the “Generating Equipment”) which are located within the “Generating 
Equipment Site”; 
• 
An Access Road to the Project Site from the B4489 which lies to the west, 
formed by upgrading an existing access road between the B4489 junction 
and the Swansea North Substation (the “Substation”) and constructing a 
new section of access road from the Substation to the Generating 
Equipment Site; and 
• 
A temporary construction compound for the storage of materials, plant and 
equipment as well as containing site accommodation and welfare facilities, 
temporary car parking and temporary fencing (the “Laydown Area”). A small 
area within the Laydown Area will be retained permanently (the 
“Maintenance Compound”). 
 
 
 
Abergelli Power 
1.1.0 Introduction to the Applicant

• 
Ecological Mitigation Area – area for ecological enhancement within the 
Project Site Boundary    
• 
Permanent parking and drainage to include: a site foul, oily water and 
surface water drainage system.  
• 
A Gas Connection in the form of a new Above Ground Installation (AGI) and 
underground gas connection (the “Gas Pipeline”) to bring natural gas to the 
Generating Equipment from the National Gas Transmission System; and 
1.6.1 
An Electrical Connection in the form of a new underground electrical cable to export 
power from the Generating Equipment to the National Grid Electricity Transmission 
System (NETS) 
Relevant consents 
1.7 
APL is applying for a Development Consent Order (“DCO”) under the Planning Act 2008 
(“PA 2008”) for powers to construct, operate and maintain the Power Generation Plant (the 
“authorised development”).   
1.8 
Separately, APL will apply for planning permission or rely on permitted development rights 
under the Town and Country Planning Act 1990 ("TCPA 1990") for consent to develop the 
Gas Connection and Electrical Connection.  The application for a DCO does not include in 
the list of works any development required for the Gas Connection or the Electrical 
Connection.  The consenting framework applicable to the Project is explained further in 
Section 2. 
Project Location 
1.9 
The Project is located on open agricultural land approximately 2 km north of junction 46 of 
the M4 within the administrative boundary of the City and County of Swansea (CCS).  
1.10 
The land upon which the Project would be developed, or which would be required in order 
to facilitate the development of the Project, is referred to as the “Order Land”.  APL is seeking 
powers of compulsory acquisition (to acquire land, to create new rights and for temporary 
possession of land) over the Order Land in order to facilitate the construction and operation 
of the Project.   
1.11 
The Project is described in more detail in Section 4. 
2. 
CONSENTING FRAMEWORK 
Development Consent under the Planning Act 2008 
Power Generation Plant 
2.1 
The Power Generation Plant would have a rated electrical output of up to 299 MW of 
electricity and is therefore classified as a Nationally Significant Infrastructure Project 
(“NSIP”) under section 15 of the Planning Act 2008 (as amended) (“PA 2008”).   
 
 
 
Abergelli Power 
1.1.0 Introduction to the Applicant 
 
5 
2.2 
As such, APL is applying to the Secretary of State (“SoS”) for Business, Energy and 
Industrial Strategy under section 31 of the PA 2008 for a Development Consent Order 
(“DCO”) for powers to construct, operate and maintain the Power Generation Plant. 
Associated Development 
2.3 
The Gas Connection and Electrical Connection comprise development associated with the 
NSIP (“associated development”).   
2.4 
The PA 2008 restricts associated development for which consent can be sought under a 
DCO in Wales to development that is associated with a generating station with a capacity 
in excess of 350MW.  As the Power Generation Plant would have rated electrical output of 
up to 299 MW, associated development to the Power Generation Plant cannot be included 
in any application for DCO under the PA 2008.  The application for a DCO therefore only 
includes the Power Generation Plant and related mitigation as "authorised development" 
and does not seek development consent for the Gas Connection or the Electrical 
Connection. 
Town and Country Planning Act 1990 and Town and Country Planning (General Permitted 
Development) Order 1995 
2.5 
APL will seek planning permission for the Gas Connection under the Town and Country 
Planning Act 1990 ("TCPA 1990"). The Electrical Connection could either be consented 
through the TCPA 1990 or as permitted development under the Town and Country Planning 
(General Permitted Development) Order 1995 ("GPDO"). 
Wales Act 2017 
2.6 
The Wales Act 2017 ("WA 2017") will transfer decision-making powers from the SoS (under 
the PA 2008) to the Welsh Government, in relation to electricity generating stations up to a 
capacity of 350MW.  However, these provisions have not yet come into force. The date 
anticipated for devolution of these powers to take effect is 1 April 2019. Accordingly, the 
consenting regime for the authorised development remains the PA 2008.  
Compulsory Acquisition 
2.7 
In addition to seeking development consent in the Order for the Power Generation Plant, 
APL is also seeking powers of compulsory acquisition over the Order Land, in order to 
authorise the acquisition of land, the temporary use of land, the creation of permanent new 
rights and to suspend, override and extinguish any rights, restrictions, easements or 
servitudes in order to facilitate the construction, operation and maintenance of the Project.   
2.8 
The Application is accompanied by Land Plans (Document Reference 2.2), Statement of 
Reasons (Document Reference 4.1) and Book of Reference (Document Reference 4.3).  
The Land Plans show the land to be acquired, the land to be used temporarily and the land 
over which permanent rights are sought. The land shown on the Land Plans is referred to 
as the "Order Land".  The Book of Reference describes this land in more detail and the 
Statement of Reasons explains why powers of compulsory acquisition are being sought in 
the Order.   
 
 
 
Abergelli Power 
1.1.0 Introduction to the Applicant

2.9 
The Works Plans (Document Reference 2.3), Indicative Site Layout Plan (Document 
Reference 2.6) and Indicative Elevation Drawings (Document Reference 2.7) provide details 
of the development for which development consent is sought. The extent of the works for 
which development consent is sought in the DCO (together with relevant limits of deviation) 
is shown on the plans and referred to as the "Order Limits".   
3. 
THE DCO PRE-APPLICATION PROCESS    
3.1 
Under the PA 2008, APL is required to consult on the application for the DCO with a wide 
range of consultees, including statutory consultees, local authorities, owners, lessees, 
tenants, those with an interest in the land and the local community. The scope of 
consultation carried out by APL covers both the authorised development being applied for 
under the PA 2008 and in relation to the Order Land over which powers of compulsory 
acquisition are sought.  Therefore consultation has been undertaken by APL in respect of 
the authorised development and the full extent of the Order Land.   The Preliminary 
Environmental Information Reports (PEIR) produced to accompany consultation provided 
preliminary environmental information in respect of the likely significant effects of the Project 
as a whole, and the Power Generation Plant, Electrical Connection and Gas Connection as 
separate elements of the Project. 
3.2 
APL has carried out pre-application consultation on the Project in accordance with Part 5, 
Chapter 2 of the PA 2008 including the consultation required under Sections 42, 47 and 48 
and the notification and other duties under the PA 2008 and applicable Regulations 
(including the Infrastructure Planning (Environmental Impact Assessment) Regulations 
2009).  In addition, APL has had regard to and complied with relevant guidance issued by 
the Secretary of State and the Planning Inspectorate in carrying out its pre-application 
consultation.   
3.3 
Consultation on the Project has been carried out by APL since June 2014, taking the form 
of multiple stages of non-statutory consultation and two phases of statutory consultation.  At 
all stages, APL has consulted regularly with CCS, being the host authority for the Project, 
as well as key stakeholders such as Natural Resources Wales (“NRW”).  In addition, APL 
has actively engaged with landowners and those interested in the land affected by the 
Project.   
3.4 
The Application is accompanied by a Consultation Report (Document Reference 5.1.0) 
(Table 1) which explains the pre-application consultation carried out as well as the regard 
that APL has had to consultation responses in formulating the Application.   
3.5 
Further information on the processes that the Planning Inspectorate follows after submission 
of the Application by APL is provided in section 7 below.  Reference should also be made

Car Parking 
4.12 
During construction, adequate car parking would be provided within the Laydown Area. 
During operation, car parking for operational and maintenance staff would be provided 
within the Generating Equipment Site. 
Lighting and Security Fencing  
4.13 
Lighting columns would be erected around the perimeter of the Generating Equipment in 
order to provide security lighting and lighting for safe working in dark conditions. The lighting 
columns would be approximately 8 m in height and regularly spaced around the perimeter 
of the Generating Equipment Site.  
Drainage 
4.14 
The Project will require a site foul water drainage system, and an oily water drainage system. 
A surface water drainage system will also be required to adequately drain the site and 
prevent ponding. To prevent inundation of the Project Site from surface runoff, cut off 
drainage ditches will be placed around the uphill site perimeter. 
Electrical Connection & Gas Connection 
4.15 
The Electrical Connection and Gas Connection comprise associated development for which 
planning permission will be sought under the TCPA 1990 for the Gas Connection with the 
Electrical Connection either being consented through the TCPA 1990 or as permitted 
development under the GPDO.  Development consent is not sought for the Electrical 
Connection and Gas Connection within the DCO. 
Electrical Connection 
4.16 
The Electrical Connection will comprise a new underground electrical cable connection to 
export electricity from the Generating Equipment into the NETS at the Substation.  This will 
consist of a 400 kV cable, approximately 900 m in length, from the Generating Equipment 
Site to a gas insulated switchgear (“GIS”) bay within the Substation.   
Gas Connection 
4.17 
The Gas Connection will comprise a new underground gas pipeline connection to bring 
natural gas to the Generating Equipment from the existing high pressure gas network 
National Transmission System.  The Gas Connection will be composed of an Above Ground 
Installation ("AGI") comprising of a Pipeline Inspection Gauge ("PIG") Trap Facility ("PTF") 
alongside a Minimum Offtake Connection ("MOC"), and a Gas Pipeline laid to the gas 
receiving station in the Generating Equipment Site.

6. 
THE APPLICATION DOCUMENTS AND THEIR COMPLIANCE WITH LEGISLATIVE 
REQUIREMENTS 
6.1 
Table 1 below provides a guide to the documents that APL is submitting as part of this 
Application. As well as providing a list of the main application documents, it also identifies 
where documents are submitted in order to comply with a relevant legislative or policy 
requirement.   
6.2 
The legislative requirements for applications for a DCO are principally contained in the PA 
2008, and the following regulations: 
▪ The Infrastructure Planning (Applications: Prescribed Forms and Procedure) 
Regulations 2009 (as amended) (the “APFP Regulations”); and  
▪ The Infrastructure Planning (Environmental Impact Assessment) Regulations 20091 
(the “EIA Regulations”).  
6.3 
Regulation 5 in the APFP Regulations sets out the documents that all development consent 
applications must include and Regulation 6 sets out the documents that particular types of 
development consent applications must include – those relating to generating stations are 
relevant to the Project.  References in Table 1 below such as "Reg. 5(2)(b)" are to the APFP 
Regulations and those such as "S.37(3)(c)" are to the PA 2008.  
6.4 
Regulation 5 of the APFP Regulations includes a category described as "any other 
documents considered necessary to support the application" (Reg. 5(2)(q)). Similarly 
Regulation 5 also allows APL to submit other plans, drawings and sections which are 
necessary to describe the Project (Reg. 5(2)(o)). The documents provided by APL and 
marked as relating to those two paragraphs of the APFP Regulations are therefore not 
statutorily required but are those which APL considers necessary to support the Application.  
6.5 
The Application submitted for the Project complies with the requirements of the PA 2008, 
the APFP Regulations, the EIA Regulations and applicable SoS and Planning Inspectorate 
guidance, including in particular Planning Inspectorate Advice Note 6 (Preparation and 
submission of application documents, Republished February 2017).

7. 
THE DCO APPLICATION AND EXAMINATION PROCESS 
7.1 
After APL has submitted the Application, the process for considering it is as follows: 
7.1.1 
The Secretary of State has 28 days from the date that the Application is made to 
decide whether to accept it for examination. 
7.1.2 
Following acceptance by the Secretary of State, APL will carry out its post-
acceptance consultation and notification duties.  This includes site notice and 
advertisements in a local newspaper, a national newspaper and the London 
Gazette, all confirming certain details including that the Application has been 
accepted and how representations can be made about it, as well as notices to 
various statutory consultees. 
7.1.3 
The Secretary of State will then appoint one or more 'examining inspectors' (known 
as the Examining Authority) to examine the Application.  The Examining Authority 
will consider the Application documents and the representations and invite all 
parties to attend a ‘preliminary meeting’, setting out what the examining authority 
considers to be the principal issues, and a draft timetable for examining it. 
7.1.4 
At or before the preliminary meeting, participants may make submissions about how 
the Application should be examined. The preliminary meeting does not consider 
issues of substance relating to the Application. 
7.1.5 
Following the preliminary meeting, the Examining Authority will issue an 
examination timetable and it is also likely to issue an initial set of written questions.  
The timetable will give details of deadlines for submitting written representations, 
commenting on others’ representations, answering the examining authorities' 
questions and commenting on others’ answers.  Hearings may be scheduled at this 
point, or these may be programmed at a later time, and further questions and 
requests for information may be issued by the examining authority.  Further 
information on participating in the examination of the Application can be found on 
the Planning Inspectorate's website including in the Advice Notes it has issued. 
7.1.6 
The examination period (which includes the submission of all written material as 
well as holding hearings and site visits) starts from the day after the date of the 
preliminary meeting and must take no more than six months.  This can only be 
extended with the authorisation of the Secretary of State. 
7.1.7 
Following the end of the six-month examination period, the examining authority 
must submit a report to the Secretary of State within three months.  The Secretary 
of State then has a further three months to determine the Application. 
7.1.8 
City and County of Swansea Council has a very important role to play in the DCO 
process. They will be invited by the Secretary of State to comment on the quality of 
APL's consultation process, to produce a Local Impact Report on the Project and to 
make its own representations to the Examining Authority on the Application.  
7.1.9 
APL welcomes correspondence from interested parties in relation to the Project - 
questions relating to the examination process should be directed to the Planning 
Inspectorate.
