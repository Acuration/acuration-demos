Introduction
1.1
Overview
1.1.1
This document is the Environmental Statement ('ES') for the proposed Abergelli
Power Project (hereafter referred to as ‘the Project’) described below. This ES has
been prepared by AECOM on behalf of the Applicant, Abergelli Power Limited
(APL).
1.1.2
The Project is situated on open agricultural land located approximately 2 km north 
of junction 46 of the M4 within the administrative boundary of the City and County 
of Swansea Council (CCS). Figure 1.1 shows the location of the Project 
approximately 1 km southeast of Felindre and 1.4 km north of Llangyfelach. The 
land upon which the Project will be developed, or which is required for construction 
of the Project, is referred to as the ‘Project Site’ (see Figure 1.1). The approximate 
centre of the Project Site lies at grid reference 265284, 201431. The Project Site 
covers an area of up to approximately 35 ha.
1.2
The Project
1.2.1
The Project is a gas-fired ‘peaking’ plant which is designed to operate when there is
a surge in demand for electricity associated with a particular stress event (e.g.
where there is a sudden demand in power required by consumers or a sudden drop
in power being generated by plants which are constantly operational such as a
sudden outage).
1.2.2
The Project is comprised of the below, and explained in greater detail in Section
3.4.

Consenting Route
to the Project Site from the
B4489 which lies to the west,
formed by upgrading an existing
access road between the B4489
junction and the Swansea North
Substation (the Substation) and
constructing a new section of
access road from the Substation
to the Generating Equipment Site
(the Laydown Area, see Section
3.4);
·
A 
temporary 
construction
compound for the storage of
materials, plant and equipment
as 
well 
as 
containing 
site
accommodation 
and 
welfare
facilities, temporary car parking
(see Section 3.4) and temporary
fencing (the Laydown Area, see
Section 3.4). A small area within
the 
Laydown 
Area 
will 
be
retained 
permanently 
(the
Maintenance Compound).
·
Ecological  Mitigation Area
–
area for ecological enhancement
within the Project Site Boundary;
and
·
Permanent parking and drainage
to include: a site foul, oily water
and 
surface 
water 
drainage
system (see Section 3.4).
Gas
Connection
The Gas Connection will be in the
form 
of 
a 
new 
above 
ground
installation (AGI) and underground
gas pipeline connection (the
Gas
Pipeline). This is to bring natural gas
to the Generating Equipment from the
National Gas Transmission System.
The
Gas
Pipeline will follow an
approximate 
north-south 
route
corridor, between the National Gas
Transmission System south of Rhyd-
y-pandy Road and the Generating
Equipment Site (see Section 3.5).
The 
Gas 
Connection 
will 
be
consented through the Town and
County Planning Act 1990 (TCPA)
and is not part of the DCO
Application.
Though this Project
element is not part of the DCO
Application, APL is seeking powers
of compulsory acquisition over the
land 
required 
for 
the 
Gas
Connection.

Consenting Route
Electrical
Connection
This is
an underground electrical
cable
to export power from the
Generating Equipment to the National
Grid Electricity Transmission System
(NETS) (see Section 3.6).
The Electrical Connection will be
consented either through Permitted
Development rights or a planning
application under the TCPA and is
not part of the DCO Application.
Though this Project element is not
part of the DCO Application, APL is
seeking 
powers 
of 
compulsory
acquisition over the land required
for the Electrical Connection.
1.2.3
The DCO Application seeks consent for all works required for construction, use,
operation and maintenance of the Power Generation Plant (including the Access
Road and the Laydown Area, which are integral to the NSIP).  The Gas Connection
and Electrical Connection are considered to be Associated Development within the
meaning of the Planning Act 2008.  As the Project is a generating station in Wales
below 350 MW,
development
consent cannot be granted
for Associated
Development in the DCO1. However, the Gas Connection and the Electrical
Connection are considered and assessed in this ES to provide full information on
the effects of the Project as a whole.
1.3
Abergelli Power Ltd
1.3.1
The Applicant is APL, an energy development company established for the Project
and recently acquired by Drax Group PLC (Drax).
1.3.2
Drax is responsible for generating 6% of the UKs electricity, predominantly via Drax
power station in Selby. Drax is one of the UK’s largest energy producers and is
committed to helping to reduce carbon emissions, displacing more coal off the
system and providing additional system support to plug the gaps created by
intermittent renewables and boost security of supply.
1.3.3
Drax acquired APL from Watt Power Limited (Watt Power) in 2016. Stag Energy
Development Company Ltd (Stag Energy) previously provided management
services to Watt Power in relation to APL. Stag Energy continues to provide
resources to APL through a management services agreement. Stag Energy was
founded in 2002 and the company draws on a depth of experience within a team
that has created and delivered over 10,000 MW of power generation and related
infrastructure projects across the globe, of which 2,500 MW has been delivered in
the UK.
1.3.4
Drax currently has three other power generation projects which have either already
been granted consent under or are being brought forward through the PA 2008
1 The Secretary of State concluded in the Hirwaun Generating Station Order 2015 that a gas connection and an electrical connection
were not integral to or part of the actual generating station.  As such the DCO will not seek development consent for the Gas Connection
or the Electrical Connection, but is likely to seek powers of compulsory acquisition over land required for the Gas Connection and the
Electrical Connection (which is the approach taken by the Secretary of State in making the Hirwaun order).

Bedfordshire (www.millbrookpower.co.uk).  The first two listed projects were
granted Development Consent in July 2015.
1.3.5
APL is committed to the development of assets to support the UK Government’s
drive to a low carbon economy. APL recognises the need to balance commercial
issues with the environmental benefits and concerns relating to energy projects and
believes this balance can be responsibly delivered. The Project would be designed
and developed to high quality, safety and environmental standards.
1.3.6
Further information on the companies referred to above is provided at
www.abergellipower.co.uk or www.drax.com.
1.4
Purpose of this Environmental Statement
1.4.1
The Power Generation Plant constitutes a Nationally Significant Infrastructure
Project (NSIP) pursuant to the Planning Act 2008 (as amended) (PA 2008) and
therefore requires development consent under the PA 2008.
1.4.2
This ES assesses the Project as a whole which includes the Power Generation
Plant (to be consented under the DCO), the Gas Connection (to be applied for
under a separate Town & Country Planning Act (TCPA) application), and the
Electrical Connection (to be constructed under Permitted Development).
1.4.3
The Infrastructure Planning (Environmental Impact Assessment) Regulations 2009
(the ‘EIA Regulations’) require an EIA to be carried out in respect of any
development listed in Schedule 1 to the EIA Regulations (‘Schedule 1
development’). The Project is a Schedule 1 development as it is a thermal
generating station with a heat output2 of 300 MW or more as listed in Schedule 1,
paragraph 2(1) of the EIA Regulations.
1.4.4
The Project falls under the EIA Regulations and not the Infrastructure Planning
(Environmental Impact Assessment) Regulations 2017 (EIA Regulations 2017).
This is because a scoping opinion was requested from the Secretary of State under
the EIA Regulations before the commencement of the EIA Regulations 2017. This
means that, in accordance with the transitional arrangements at Regulation 37 of
the EIA Regulations 2017, the EIA Regulations 2009 will continue to apply to the
Project.
1.4.5
Accordingly, this ES has been prepared to present the environmental information
collected to date and provides an assessment of the likely significant environmental
effects of the Project.
1.4.6
This document is the first “ES” which has been prepared for the Project, following
two Preliminary Environmental Impact Reports (PEIR). The first PEIR was
published and consulted upon in 2014 (the “2014 PEIR”) together with supporting
information and a Non-Technical Summary ("2014 PEIR NTS"). This information
2 Thermal output is commonly defined as the amount of ‘useable heat’ which is produced as part of the process of the combustion of fuel.
Only a part of this useable heat can be converted to electrical energy, which is why this is a larger value than electrical output.

accompanied APL’s initial phase of statutory consultation ("Phase 1 Statutory
Consultation") with both the local community and prescribed consultees.
1.4.7
The second PEIR was published in January 2018 (the “2018 PEIR”) together with
supporting information and a Non-Technical Summary (“2018 PEIR NTS”).
This
information accompanied APL’s second phase of statutory consultation ("Phase 2
Statutory Consultation") with both the local community and prescribed consultees.
This ES reflects (and provides information regarding) updates on Project
parameters and design evolution, as well as the refined EIA processes.
1.4.8
The feedback received relating to the 2014 PEIR and 2018 PEIR helped to inform
and refine the EIA process (including this ES) as well as the design and
development of the Project.
1.4.9
The approach to assessment undertaken in this ES is described further in Chapter
4: Approach to Environmental Impact Assessment.
1.5
Application for Development Consent
1.5.1
An onshore electricity generating station is considered to be a NSIP under the PA
2008 if it is in England or Wales and its generating capacity (rated electrical output)
is more than 50 MW. As the Project is in Wales and will have a rated electrical
output over 50 MW, it is classified as a NSIP under Section 14(1) (a) and Section
15(2) of the PA 2008.
1.5.2
Under Section 31 of the PA 2008, a DCO is required for development that is or
forms part of a NSIP and therefore it is necessary that an application for a DCO is
submitted to the Secretary of State (SoS).
1.5.3
A DCO for a NSIP may be granted only if an application is made under Section 37
of the PA 2008 to the SoS. Section 37 of the PA 2008 (and associated legislation)
also governs the content of an application for a DCO, including requirements for
certain accompanying documents.
1.5.4
These requirements are specified, in particular, in the Infrastructure Planning
(Applications: Prescribed Forms and Procedures) Regulations 2014 (as amended)
(the “APFP Regulations”). The APFP Regulations require that an application for a
DCO, where applicable, must be accompanied by an ES and any associated
scoping or screening opinions or directions. A screening opinion was not sought for
the Project, however a Scoping Opinion, dated 1st August 2014, (Appendix 4.2)
has been sought from the SoS. A notice of the intention to submit an application for
Development Consent (Regulation 6 Notification), including an Environmental
Statement, was submitted to PINS on 8th October 2014.
1.5.5

Regulatory and Policy Background 
2.1 
Introduction 
2.1.1 
This chapter summarises the main regulatory and policy framework that is relevant 
to the Project at international, national and local levels. 
2.1.2 
A summary of the European Union (EU) Directives, National Policy Statements 
(NPS) as well as national and local policy considered relevant to the Project is set 
out below.  A detailed description of the planning policy background and its 
relevance to the Project is provided in the Planning Statement (Document 
Reference 10.1.0) which is produced as a separate document as part of the 
application for development consent. 
2.2 
European Union 
2.2.1 
The UK voted to leave the EU on the 23rd June 2016. The formal process of 
triggering Article 50 of the Lisbon Treaty, to commence negotiations for exiting the 
EU, was undertaken on 29th March 2017. However, the exit process is anticipated 
to involve lengthy and complex negotiations, taking up to two years. Until the UK 
formally leaves the EU and/or discards or alters EU legislation, it is considered that 
the following EU Directives are still relevant to the Project: 
 
Directive 2011/92/EU on the assessment of the effects of certain public and 
private projects on the environment (“the Environmental Impact Assessment 
Directive” (EIA)) (Ref. 2.1) and Directive 2014/52/EU (Ref. 2.2); 
 
Directive 2010/75/EU of 24 November 2010 on industrial emissions (integrated 
pollution prevention and control) (“the Industrial Emissions Directive” (IED)) 
(Ref. 2.3); 
 
Directive 1992/43/EEC of 21 May 1992 on the conservation of natural habitats 
and of wild fauna and flora (“the Habitats Directive”) (Ref. 2.4); 
 
Directive 2009/147/EC of 30 November 2009 on the conservation of wild birds 
(“the Birds Directive”) (Ref. 2.5);  
 
Directive 2008/50/EC of 21 May 2008 on ambient air quality and cleaner air for 
Europe (“the Ambient Air Quality Directive”) (Ref. 2.6); and 
 
Industrial Emissions Directive 2010/75/EU – Best Available Techniques (BAT) 
reference document (BREF) for large combustion plants (July 2017) (Ref 2.7). 
 
a) Directive 2011/92/EU on the assessment of the effects of certain public and 
private projects on the environment (the EIA Directive) 
2.2.2 
The EIA Directive (Ref 2.1) ensures that plans, programmes and projects likely to 
have significant effects on the environment are made subject to an environmental 
assessment, prior to their approval or authorisation. The Directive sets the 
thresholds for projects that require an EIA and also outlines the impacts on the 
environment to be assessed in the EIA process. This Directive was implemented in 
respect of Nationally Significant Infrastructure Projects (“NSIPs”) in the UK by the 
Infrastructure Planning (Environmental Impact Assessment) Regulations 2009 (as 
amended) (the “EIA Regulations”). 
Abergelli ES 2018 – CHAPTER 2: REGULATORY AND POLICY BACKGROUND 
 
Prepared for:  Abergelli Power Limited 
 
AECOM 
2-3 
 
2.2.3 
It is noted here that the EIA Directive was amended in May 2014 (EU Directive 
2014/52/EU) (Ref 2.2) and the amendments have been implemented in Member 
States as of 16 May 2017. For NSIPs, such as the Project, this will be through the 
Infrastructure Planning (Environmental Impact Assessment) Regulations 2017 
(which came into force on 16th May 2017).  
2.2.4 
However, Regulation 37(2)(a) of the 2017 Regulations states that, where a scoping 
opinion has already been requested, or an application or an ES submitted, before 
the commencement of the new EIA regulations, the previous EIA regulations and 
regime will continue to apply.  Therefore, as a Scoping Report was submitted for 
the Project in June 2014, the Environmental Statement has been undertaken in line 
with the previous (2011) EIA Directive and associated EIA Regulations.  
b) Directive 2010/75/EU of 24 November 2010 on industrial emissions (integrated 
pollution prevention and control) (the Industrial Emissions Directive (IED)); 
2.2.5 
In December 2010 the EU adopted a proposal for a Directive on industrial 
emissions (IED) (Ref. 2.3). The IED recasts seven existing directives related to 
industrial emissions, in particular Directive 2008/1/EC of 15th January 2008 
concerning integrated pollution prevention and control (IPPC) (“the IPPC 
Directive”), and Directive 2001/80/EC of 23rd October 2001 on the limitation of 
emissions of certain pollutants into the air from large combustion plants (“the Large 
Combustion Plant Directive (LCPD)”), into a single legislative instrument to improve 
the permitting, compliance and enforcement regimes adopted by Member States. 
However, the general principles of the IPPC Directive and the LCPD Directive are 
retained and will remain relevant to the Project. The IED has been implemented in 
England and Wales by the Environmental Permitting (England and Wales) 
Regulations 2016. 
c) Directive 1992/43/EEC of 21 May 1992 on the Conservation of natural habitats 
and of wild fauna and flora (the Habitats Directive); 
2.2.6 
The aim of the Habitats Directive (Ref 2.4) is to contribute towards ensuring bio-
diversity through the conservation of natural habitats and of wild fauna and flora. 
Measures taken pursuant to this Directive by the Member States are designed to 
maintain or restore, at favourable conservation status, natural habitats and species 
of wild fauna and flora of community interest whilst also taking into account 
economic, social and cultural requirements, and regional and local characteristics.  
2.2.7 
The Conservation of Habitats and Species Regulations 2010 (the "Habitats 
Regulations") implement the Habitats Directive in England and Wales. The Habitats 
Regulations contain five Parts and four Schedules, and provide for:  
 The designation and protection of “European Sites;”  
 The protection of “European protected species;” and  
 The adaptation of planning and other controls for the protection of European 
Sites.

d) Directive 2009/147/EC of 30 November 2009 on the conservation of wild birds 
(the Birds Directive); 
2.2.8 
The aim of the Birds Directive (Ref 2.5) is to protect, manage and control all 
species of naturally occurring wild birds in the Member States.  Member States are 
required to take the requisite measures to maintain the population of the species at 
a level which corresponds to ecological, scientific and cultural requirements, while 
taking account of economic and recreational requirements, or to adapt the 
population of these species to that level.  The Birds Directive is implemented in 
England and Wales through the Wildlife & Countryside Act 1981 (as amended) and 
the Habitats Regulations. 
e) Directive 2008/50/EC of 21 May 2008 on ambient air quality and cleaner air for 
Europe (the Ambient Air Quality Directive); 
2.2.9 
The Ambient Air Quality Directive (Ref. 2.6) sets out measures aimed at avoiding, 
preventing or reducing harmful effects on human health and the environment, by 
seeking to combat emissions of pollutants at source and identifying and 
implementing the most effective emission reduction measures at local and national 
level.  In Wales, the Ambient Air Quality Directive is implemented by the Air Quality 
Standards (Wales) Regulations 2010. 
f) 
Industrial Emissions Directive 2010/75/EU – Best Available Techniques (BAT) 
reference document (BREF) for large combustion plants (July 2017) 
2.2.10 The BREF for the Large Combustion Plants sector covers combustion of fuels in 
installations with a total rated thermal input of 50 MW or more. It sets out a series of 
best available techniques which should be applied to large combustion plants in 
order to drive greater efficiency, cost savings and lower emissions. Given the 
nature of the Project (to operate intermittently as a peaking plant) many of the 
techniques highlighted in the BREF do not apply to the Project. Nevertheless, it  
has been referenced where appropriate.  
2.3 
Nationally Significant Infrastructure Projects and Planning Act 2008 
2.3.1 
The generation capacity of the Power Generation Plant will exceed 50 MWe and 
will therefore be classified as a NSIP under Section 15 of the Planning Act 2008 
(“PA 2008”) (Ref. 2.8).  Accordingly, Development Consent will be required in 
accordance with Section 31 of the PA 2008. 
2.3.2 
Development Consent for a NSIP may only be granted by a Development Consent 
Order (“DCO”) through an application under Section 37 of the PA 2008 to the 
Secretary of State (“SoS”).   
2.3.3 
If the DCO Application for the Power Generation Plant is accepted by the SoS, it 
will be examined for a period of up to six months, starting the day after the date of 
the Preliminary Meeting for the Project.  The examination is a predominantly written 
process led either by a single appointed person or a panel, who will, within three 
months of the end of the examination, submit a report with their recommendation 
on the Application to the relevant SoS.  The SoS will then have three months from 
Abergelli ES 2018 – CHAPTER 2: REGULATORY AND POLICY BACKGROUND 
 
Prepared for:  Abergelli Power Limited 
 
AECOM 
2-5 
 
the receipt of the PINS' report to make a decision on the DCO Application pursuant 
to the regime established by the PA 2008.  The relevant SoS for the Project is the 
Secretary of State for Business, Energy & Industrial Strategy (BEIS). 
2.3.4 
Section 104 of the PA 2008 requires the SoS to a make a decision on an 
application in accordance with relevant NPSs.  The relevant NPSs  to the Project 
are discussed in section 2.6 below. 
2.4 
Wales Act 2017 
2.4.1 
As part of a wider devolution of powers, the Wales Act 2017 (“WA 2017”) (Ref. 2.9) 
will transfer decision-making powers to the Welsh Government in relation to 
electricity generating stations up to a capacity of 350MW.  
2.4.2 
The effect of the WA 2017 will be to devolve the SoS's power under the PA 2008 to 
grant development consent for all electricity generating stations in Wales insofar as 
such projects (not including wind powered generating stations) do not exceed a 
capacity of 350MW, to the Welsh Ministers.  The Wales Act 2017 (Commencement 
No. 4) Regulations 2017 (Ref 2.10) confirmed that the transfer of decision making 
powers will take effect from 1st April 2019 for new applications made after that 
date.  Applications which have already been accepted by the SoS into examination 
at that point will continue through the process and be determined by the SoS.  
2.4.3 
Accordingly, the consenting regime for the Power Generation Plant remains the PA 
2008.  
2.5 
Environment (Wales) Act 2016 
2.5.1 
The Environment (Wales) Act 2016 (Ref. 2.11) provides legislation to plan and 
manage Wales’ natural resources.  The Act aims to position Wales as a low carbon 
economy ready to adapt to climate change impacts and to deliver significant 
economic, social and environmental benefits for Wales. 
2.5.2 
The key parts of the Act relevant to the Project are: 
 Part 1: Sustainable management of natural resources – seeks to manage 
Wales’ natural resources in a proactive, sustainable and coordinated manner. 
 Part 2: Climate change – provides Welsh Ministers with powers to enforce 
statutory emission reduction targets, including an 80% reduction in emissions 
by 2020. 
 Part 4: Collection and disposal of waste – seeks to improve waste management 
processes through increased business waste recycling, better food waste 
treatment and increased energy recovery. 
2.6 
Infrastructure Planning (Environmental Impact Assessment) Regulations 
2009 and Infrastructure Planning (Applications: Prescribed Forms and 
Procedure) Regulations 2009 
2.6.1 
The EIA Regulations (Ref 2.12) require an EIA to be carried out in respect of 
development that is classed as EIA development. All development in Schedule 1 to 
Abergelli ES 2018 – CHAPTER 2: REGULATORY AND POLICY BACKGROUND 
 
Prepared for:  Abergelli Power Limited 
 
AECOM 
2-6 
 
the EIA Regulations (“Schedule 1 development”) requires EIA. Development in 
Schedule 2 to the EIA Regulations (“Schedule 2 development”) requires EIA if it is 
likely to have significant effects on the environment. 
2.6.2 
The Project has been identified as a Schedule 1 development and therefore the 
Applicant intends to carry out an EIA for the Project in accordance with the EIA 
Regulations. 
2.6.3 
Regulation 5(2)(a) of the Infrastructure Planning (Applications: Prescribed Forms 
and Procedure) Regulations 2009 (the “APFP Regulations”) (Ref. 2.13) requires 
that any ES required pursuant to the EIA Regulations, together with any scoping or 
screening opinions or directions, must accompany the application for development 
consent. 
2.6.4 
This document presents the environmental information and an assessment, of the 
likely significant environmental effects of the Project.   
2.7 
The Well-being of Future Generations (Wales) Act 2015 
2.7.1 
The Well-being of Future Generations (Wales) Act 2015 (Ref 2.14) seeks to 
improve the social, economic, environmental and cultural well-being of Wales by 
undertaking actions in accordance with the “sustainable development principle” 
(section 5) to achieve the well-being goals (section 4).   
2.7.2 
The “sustainable development principle” requires a public body to “act in a manner 
which seeks to ensure that the needs of the present are met without compromising 
the ability of future generations to meet their own needs” (section 5 (1)), thereby 
taking into account (section 5 (2)): 
 
Balancing short term needs with safeguarding long term needs; 
 
Taking an integrated approach considering well-being objectives; 
 
Involving other persons with an interest and reflecting the diversity of the 
population; 
 
Acting in collaboration with other persons to meet well-being objectives; and 
 
Deploying resources to prevent or reduce problems which contribute to well-
being objectives. 
2.7.3 
The well-being goals, comprise the following (Table 1): 
 
“A prosperous Wales;” 
 
“A resilient Wales;” 
 
“A healthier Wales;” 
 
“A more equal Wales;” 
 
“A Wales of cohesive communities;” 
 
“A Wales of vibrant culture and thriving Welsh language;” and 
 
“A globally responsible Wales.” 
2.7.4 
The Wellbeing of Future Generations (Wales) Act is not binding on the Examining 
Authority (ExA) or SoS.  However, it sets out sustainable development principles 
Abergelli ES 2018 – CHAPTER 2: REGULATORY AND POLICY BACKGROUND 
 
Prepared for:  Abergelli Power Limited 
 
AECOM 
2-7 
 
and well-being goals which are applicable to public bodies involved in the planning 
system in Wales.  It is therefore relevant to the examination of the DCO Application. 
2.8 
National Policy Statements 
2.8.1 
The Department for Energy and Climate Change (DECC) published 6 NPS for 
Energy in 2011.  The NPS which are relevant to the consideration of the DCO 
application for the Power Generating Plant are: 
 
Overarching National Policy Statement for Energy (EN-1) (Ref. 2.15); 
 
National Policy Statement for Fossil Fuel Electricity Generating Infrastructure 
(EN-2) (Ref. 2.16); 
 
National Policy Statement for Gas Supply Infrastructure and Gas and Oil 
Pipelines (EN-4) (Ref. 2.17); and 
 
National Policy Statement for Electricity Networks Infrastructure (EN-5) (Ref. 
2.18). 
2.8.2 
Section 104 of the PA 2008 provides that in making decisions on applications for 
development consent, the SoS must have regard (amongst certain other 
documents and matters) to any relevant NPS to which the application relates and 
must decide applications in accordance with such relevant NPS(s) unless the 
adverse impacts of the proposal would outweigh its benefits (or in certain other 
limited circumstances defined in s104, subsections (4) to (8) of the PA 2008).  
2.8.3 
NPS EN-1 is a relevant NPS for any energy NSIP, along with the relevant 
technology specific NPS.  For the DCO Application this includes NPS EN-2 
National Policy Statement for Fossil Fuel Electricity Generating Infrastructure.  NPS 
EN-4 National Policy Statement for Gas Supply Infrastructure does not directly 
relate to the Power Generation Plant, since development consent is not sought in 
the DCO for the Gas Connection, however regard has been had to the NPS and 
the relevant parts are discussed below. NPS EN-5 does not directly relate to the 
Power Generation Plant, since development consent is not sought in the DCO for 
the Electrical Connection, and the design of the  Electrical Connection is 
predominantly underground, however regard has been had to the NPS and the 
relevant parts are discussed below. 
a) Overarching National Policy Statement for Energy (NPS EN-1) 
2.8.4 
NPS EN-1 (Ref. 2.15) sets out the Government’s overall policy towards the delivery 
of major energy infrastructure. 
2.8.5 
Paragraph 1.1.1 of NPS EN-1 states that “…this NPS, when combined with the 
relevant technology-specific energy NPS, provides the primary basis for 
decisions…”.  The relevant technology-specific energy NPS for this Application is 
NPS EN-2.  NPS EN-4 and NPS EN-5 do not directly apply as development 
consent is not sought for the Electricity Connection and Gas Connection, but regard 
has been had to relevant content in the NPS and they are discussed below.  In 
addition, Paragraph 4.1.5 of NPS EN-1 states that Development Plan Documents 
or other documents in the Local Development Framework may be both important 
Abergelli ES 2018 – CHAPTER 2: REGULATORY AND POLICY BACKGROUND 
 
Prepared for:  Abergelli Power Limited 
 
AECOM 
2-8 
 
and relevant considerations to SoS decision-making.  Local planning policy for City 
& County of Swansea (CCS) relevant to this Application is also set out below. 
2.8.6 
Paragraph 3.1.3 of NPS EN-1 states that all development consent applications for 
energy infrastructure should be assessed “on the basis that the Government has 
demonstrated that there is a need for those types of infrastructure and that the 
scale and urgency of that need is as described for each of them in this Part.”  
Accordingly, the SoS “should give substantial weight to the contribution which 
projects would make towards satisfying this need when considering applications for 
development consent under the Planning Act 2008” (paragraph 3.1.4). 
2.8.7 
Section 3.3 of NPS EN-1 sets out the key reasons why the Government believes 
there is an “urgent need” for new electricity NSIPs (paragraph 3.3.1), including: 
 
“Meeting energy security and carbon reduction objectives;” 
 
“The need to replace closing electricity generating capacity;” 
 
“The need for more electricity capacity to support an increased supply from 
renewables;” and 
 
“Future increases in electricity demand.” 
2.8.8 
Furthermore, paragraph 3.7.3 of NPS EN-1 stresses that new electricity network 
infrastructure projects add to the “reliability of the national energy supply” and 
provide “crucial national benefits” which are shared by all users of the system. 
2.8.9 
Whilst alternatives to the need for new large scale electricity infrastructure have 
been considered – including: reducing demand; more intelligent use of electricity; 
and interconnection of electricity systems – the Government believes that these 
measures will not be sufficient to meet energy and climate change objectives on 
their own (paragraph 3.3.25 of NPS EN-1).   
2.8.10 Paragraph 3.6.1 of NPS EN-1 recognises the “vital role” that fossil fuel power 
stations play in providing electricity supplies, and states that “they will continue to 
play an important role in our energy mix as the UK makes the transition to a low 
carbon economy.” 
2.8.11 Section 4 of NPS EN-1 sets out the general assessment principles by which 
applications relating to energy infrastructure are to be decided.  
2.8.12 Paragraph 4.1.2 of NPS EN-1 states that, given the level and urgency of need for 
energy infrastructure, the SoS “should start with a presumption in favour of granting 
consent to applications for energy NSIPs.”  
2.8.13  Paragraph 4.1.3 of NPS EN-1 explains that the SoS will weigh up a proposal’s 
contribution to meeting the need for energy infrastructure, job creation and other 
long term and wider benefits, against the potential adverse impacts of the proposal 
in question including, “any long-term and cumulative adverse impacts, as well as 
any measures to avoid, reduce or compensate for any adverse impacts.” 
2.8.14 Paragraph 4.1.4 of NPS EN-1 continues and explains that the SoS should take into 
account “environmental, social and economic benefits and adverse impacts, at 
Abergelli ES 2018 – CHAPTER 2: REGULATORY AND POLICY BACKGROUND 
 
Prepared for:  Abergelli Power Limited 
 
AECOM 
2-9 
 
national, regional and local levels” whether identified in the NPSs or elsewhere, 
including in local impact reports.   
2.8.15 In addition, Paragraph 4.1.5 of NPS EN-1 states that other matters that the SoS 
may consider both “important and relevant to its decision-making” could include 
Development Plan Documents or other documents in the Local Development 
Framework and explains that “in the event of a conflict between these or any other 
documents and an NPS, the NPS prevails.”  The documents included within the 
Local Development Framework for CCS are referenced below at section 2.9. 
2.8.16 Paragraph 4.1.7 of NPS EN-1 confirms that the SoS will have regard to the 
guidance in Circular 11/95, as revised, on “The Use of Conditions in Planning 
Permissions” in agreeing or suggesting requirements in a DCO.  Although that 
Circular has in part been superseded by advice contained within NPPG (published 
in March 2014), the Applicant notes that the general advice remains essentially 
similar.  
2.8.17 Paragraph 4.1.8 states that “The [SoS] may take into account any development 
consent obligations that an applicant agrees with local authorities.”   
2.8.18 Paragraph 4.1.9 of NPS EN-1 states that viability issues are unlikely to be of 
relevance to decision making providing that the technical feasibility of the proposal 
has been properly assessed, but limited exceptions exist and are set out in NPS 
EN-1 and others. 
2.8.19 Paragraph 4.2.1 of NPS EN-1 advises that, “All proposals for projects that are 
subject to the European Environmental Impact Assessment Directive must be 
accompanied by an ES describing the aspects of the environment likely to be 
significantly affected by the project.” The Environmental Statement (ES) should 
include an assessment of the likely significant effects of the proposed project on the 
environment, including direct, indirect, secondary, cumulative, short, medium and 
long-term, permanent and temporary, positive and negative effects at all stages of 
the project.  Paragraph 4.2.3 of NPS EN-1 adds that “the ES should cover the 
environmental, social and economic effects arising from pre-construction, 
construction, operation and decommissioning of the project.”  When considering 
cumulative effects, Paragraph 4.2.5 of NPS EN-1 advises that the ES should 
provide information on how the effects of the proposal combine and interact with 
the effects of other development, including projects for which consent is sought or 
granted, as well as those already in existence.  
2.8.20 Paragraph 4.3.1 of NPS EN-1 advises applicants to consult with the Countryside 
Council for Wales (CCW) (now Natural Resources Wales (NRW)), in respect of 
Habitats and Species Regulations, and to subsequently undertake an Appropriate 
Assessment if required.   
2.8.21 Paragraph 4.4.1 of NPS EN-1 notes that “the relevance or otherwise to the 
decision-making process of the existence (or alleged existence) of alternatives to 
the proposed development is in the first instance a matter of law, detailed guidance 
on which falls outside the scope of this NPS.  From a policy perspective NPS EN-1 
Abergelli ES 2018 – CHAPTER 2: REGULATORY AND POLICY BACKGROUND 
 
Prepared for:  Abergelli Power Limited 
 
AECOM 
2-10 
 
does not contain any general requirement to consider alternatives or to establish 
whether the proposed project represents the best option.”  However, paragraph 
4.4.2 of NPS EN-1 states that applicants are obliged to include, as a matter of fact, 
information about the main alternatives that have been considered within the ES, 
including the main reasons for the applicant’s choice, taking into account the 
environmental, social and economic effects.   
2.8.22 Paragraph 4.5.1 of NPS EN-1 states that good design for energy infrastructure 
“should produce sustainable infrastructure sensitive to place, efficient in the use of 
natural resources and energy used in their construction and operation, matched by 
an appearance that demonstrates good aesthetic as far as possible.” However, 
paragraph 4.5.1 also acknowledges that “the nature of much energy infrastructure 
development will often limit the extent to which it can contribute to the 
enhancement of the quality of the area.”  
2.8.23 Paragraph 4.5.3 of NPS EN-1 seeks that proposals are “sustainable and, having 
regard to regulatory and other constraints, are as attractive, durable and adaptable 
(including taking account of natural hazards such as flooding) as they can be.”   
Further, Paragraph 4.5.3 states that “Whilst the applicant may not have any or very 
limited choice in the physical appearance of some energy infrastructure, there may 
be opportunities for the applicant to demonstrate good design in terms of siting 
relative to existing landscape character, landform and vegetation.”  
2.8.24 Paragraph 4.5.4 of NPS EN-1 seeks that applicants “demonstrate in their 
application documents how the design process was conducted and how the 
proposed design evolved. Where a number of different designs were considered, 
applicants should set out the reasons why the favoured choice has been selected.”  
Further, paragraph 4.5.4 of NPS EN-1 notes that “in considering applications the 
[SoS] should take into account the ultimate purpose of the infrastructure and bear 
in mind the operational, safety and security requirements which the design has to 
satisfy.” 
2.8.25 Paragraph 4.5.5 of NPS EN-1 states that “applicants are encouraged” to use 
design review services. 
2.8.26 Paragraph 4.6.6 of NPS EN-1 states that, ”Under guidelines issued by DECC (then 
DTI) in 2006, any application to develop a thermal generating station under Section 
36 of the Electricity Act 1989 must either include CHP [Combined Heat and Power] 
or contain evidence that the possibilities for CHP have been fully explored to inform 
the IPC’s consideration of the application.”  Further, paragraph 4.6.7 of NPS EN-1 
advises that the opportunities for CHP should be considered from the outset of the 
site selection process.  
2.8.27 Section 4.7 of NPS EN-1 explains the considerations to be given to Carbon 
Capture and Storage  and Carbon Capture and explains that all applications for 
new combustion plant which are of a generating capacity at or over 300MW and of 
a type covered by the EU’s Large Combustion Plant Directive (LCPD) should 
demonstrate that the plant is “Carbon Capture Ready” (CCR).

AECOM 
2-11 
 
2.8.28 Section 4.8 of EN-1 sets out considerations that applicants and the ExA/SoS 
should take into account to help ensure that new energy infrastructure is resilient to 
climate change.  Paragraph 4.8.5 of NPS EN-1 advises that applicants ”must 
consider the impacts of climate change when planning the location, design, build, 
operation and, where appropriate, decommissioning of new energy infrastructure.”   
2.8.29 Paragraph 4.9.1 of NPS EN-1 advises applicants to consult the National Grid and 
to ensure that there is the necessary infrastructure and capacity within an existing 
or planned transmission or distribution network to accommodate the electricity 
generated.   
2.8.30 Paragraph 4.10.1 of NPS EN-1 advises that “Issues relating to discharges or 
emissions from a proposed project which affect air quality, water quality, land 
quality and the marine environment, or which include noise and vibration may be 
subject to separate regulation under the pollution control framework or other 
consenting and licensing regimes.”     
2.8.31 Paragraph 4.11.1 of NPS EN-1 advises applicants to consult with the Health and 
Safety Executive (HSE) on “matters relating to safety” which are “relevant to the 
construction, operation and decommissioning of energy infrastructure”.  
2.8.32 Paragraph 4.12.1 of NPS EN-1 explains that all establishments wishing to hold 
stock of hazardous substances above a threshold will require Hazardous 
Substances consent, and thus should consult the HSE at the pre-application stage.  
2.8.33 Section 4.13 of NPS EN-1 advises that energy production has the “potential to 
impact on health and wellbeing” (paragraph 4.13.1), through “increased traffic, air 
or water pollution, dust, odour, hazardous waste and substances, noise, exposure 
to radiation and increases in pests” (paragraph 4.13.3).  Accordingly, the ES should 
assess these effects and identify any “measures to avoid, reduce or compensate 
for these impacts as appropriate” (paragraph 4.13.2).   
2.8.34 Paragraph 4.14.2 of NPS EN-1 stresses the importance of considering possible 
sources of nuisance and how they may be mitigated or limited at the pre-application 
stage under section 79(1) of the Environmental Protection Act 1990.  
2.8.35 Paragraph 4.15.2 of NPS EN-1 outlines that “Government policy is to ensure that, 
where possible, proportionate protective security measures are designed into new 
infrastructure projects at an early stage in the project development.”  
2.8.36 Part 5 of NPS EN-1 explains the potential impacts of energy infrastructure, in terms 
of: “air quality and emissions”; “biodiversity and ecological conservation”; “civil and 
military aviation and defence interests”; “coastal change”; “dust, odour, artificial 
light, smoke, steam and insect infestation”; “flood risk”; “historic environment”; 
“landscape and visual”; “land use including open space, green infrastructure and 
Green Belt”; “noise and vibration”; “socio-economic”; “traffic and transport”; “waste 
management”; and “water quality and resources”. 
Abergelli ES 2018 – CHAPTER 2: REGULATORY AND POLICY BACKGROUND 
 
Prepared for:  Abergelli Power Limited 
 
AECOM 
2-12 
 
2.8.37 Paragraph 5.2.1 of NPS EN-1 advises that the construction, operation and 
decommissioning of infrastructure development “can involve emissions to air which 
could lead to adverse impacts on health, on protected species and habitats, or on 
the wider countryside.”  Paragraph 5.2.7 of NPS EN-1 provides that the applicant 
should undertake an assessment as part of the ES, describing:  
 
“Any significant air emissions, their mitigation and any residual effects 
distinguishing between the project stages and taking account of any significant 
emissions from any road traffic generated by the project; 
 
The predicted absolute emission levels of the proposed project, after mitigation 
methods have been applied; 
 
Existing air quality levels and the relative change in air quality from existing 
levels; and 
 
Any potential eutrophication impacts.” 
2.8.38 With regard to biodiversity and geological conservation for EIA development, 
paragraph 5.3.3 of NPS EN-1 advises that the ES “clearly sets out any effects on 
internationally, nationally and locally designated sites of ecological or geological 
conservation importance, on protected species and on habitats and other species 
identified as being of principal importance for the conservation of biodiversity.”  
Appropriate mitigation measures should be “an integral part of the proposed 
development” and should demonstrate that: activities are confined to the minimum 
areas required during construction; best practice is followed during construction 
and operation; habitats are restored after construction works where practicable; 
and opportunities are taken to enhance or create new habitats (paragraph 5.3.18).  
2.8.39 Paragraph 5.4.1 of NPS EN-1 advises that civil and military aviation and defence 
interests can be affected by new energy development, and as such an assessment 
of potential effects should be set out within the ES (paragraph 5.4.10).  In addition, 
the Ministry of Defence (MoD), Civil Aviation Authority (CAA), National Air Traffic 
Services (NATS) and any aerodrome likely to be affected by the proposed 
development should be consulted (paragraph 5.4.11).  
2.8.40 Paragraph 5.6.1 of NPS EN-1 states that “during the construction, operation and 
decommissioning of energy infrastructure there is potential for the release of a 
range of emissions such as odour, dust, steam, smoke, artificial light and infestation 
of insects.”  Accordingly, applicants are required to assess the potential for 
emissions and the impact on amenity in the ES, in particular: the type, quantity and 
timing of emissions; aspects giving rise to emissions; locations affected by the 
emissions; effects of the emissions on identified locations; and measures to be 
employed in preventing or mitigating emissions (paragraph 5.6.5).  Paragraph 
5.6.11 advises that mitigation measures may be provided in respect of engineering, 
lay-out or administration.  
2.8.41 Paragraph 5.7.4 of NPS EN-1 states that application for energy projects of 1 ha or 
greater in Flood Zone 1 and all energy projects in Flood Zones 2 and 3 should be 
accompanied by a flood risk assessment (FRA).  Where necessary, paragraph 
5.7.18 of NPS EN-1 advises that flood risk should be mitigated by making 
Abergelli ES 2018 – CHAPTER 2: REGULATORY AND POLICY BACKGROUND

AECOM 
2-13 
 
arrangements to manage surface water and the impact of the natural water cycle 
on people and property.  
2.8.42 Paragraph 5.8.1 of NPS EN-1 advises that the construction, operation and 
decommissioning of energy infrastructure has the potential to result in adverse 
impacts on the historic environment.  Accordingly, the applicant is required to 
“provide a description of the significance of the heritage assets affected by the 
proposed development and the contribution of their setting to that significance” 
(paragraph 5.8.8).  
2.8.43 Paragraph 5.9.1 of NPS EN-1 acknowledges that the landscape and visual effects 
of energy projects will vary according to “the type of development, its location and 
the landscape setting”.  Paragraphs 5.9.5 – 5.9.7 advise that the applicant should 
carry out a landscape and visual impact assessment of the effects during 
construction and operation, including light pollution effects on local amenity and 
nature conservation.  Paragraph 5.9.21 notes that reducing the scale of the project 
can help to mitigate the landscape and visual impacts, however it is acknowledged 
that amending the design of proposed energy infrastructure may result in a 
significant operational constraint and reduction in function.   
2.8.44 Paragraph 5.10.1 of NPS EN-1 acknowledges that an energy infrastructure project 
“will have direct effects on the existing use of the proposed site and may have 
indirect effects on the use, or planned use, of land in the vicinity for other types of 
development.”  Accordingly, the applicants should consult the local community 
(paragraph 5.10.6) and the ES should include an assessment of the impact of the 
proposed development on existing and proposed land uses near the project.  
Paragraph 5.10.19 notes that “there may be little that can be done to mitigate the 
direct effects” of the energy project on the existing use of the proposed site; 
however, the effects may be minimised through the “application of good design 
principles, including the layout of the project.”  
2.8.45 Paragraph 5.11.1 of NPS EN-1 states that excessive noise can have wide-ranging 
impacts on the quality of human life, health, and use and enjoyment of areas, as 
well as on wildlife and biodiversity (paragraph 5.11.2).  Where noise impacts arise, 
paragraph 5.11.4 states that a noise assessment should be provided, to include: a 
description of the noise generating aspects of the proposal, identification of noise 
sensitive areas, the characteristics of the existing noise environment, and a 
prediction of how the noise environment will change.  Mitigation measures may 
include engineering, layout design, or administrative measures (paragraph 
5.11.12).  
2.8.46 Paragraph 5.12.1 of NPS EN-1 states that “The construction, operation and 
decommissioning of energy infrastructure may have socio-economic impacts at 
local and regional levels.”  Accordingly, an assessment should be undertaken of all 
relevant socio-economic impacts, which may include: the creation of jobs and 
training opportunities, the provision of additional local services and improvements 
to local infrastructure, effects on tourism, the impact of a changing influx of workers 
during different phases of the project, and cumulative effects (paragraph 5.12.3).

2-14 
 
Mitigation measures could include improvements to the visual and environmental 
experience for visitors and the local community through high quality design 
(paragraph 5.12.9).  
2.8.47 Paragraph 5.13.1 of NPS EN-1 notes that ”The transport of materials, goods and 
personnel to and from a development during all project phases can have a variety 
of impacts on the surrounding transport infrastructure and potentially on connecting 
transport networks.”  The applicant should therefore undertake a transport 
assessment and consult with the Highways Agency and Highways Authority 
regarding appropriate mitigation (paragraph 5.13.3).   
2.8.48 Paragraph 5.14.1 of NPS EN-1 outlines that government policy on hazardous and 
non-hazardous waste is intended to “protect human health and the environment by 
producing less waste and by using it as a resource wherever possible.”  Paragraph 
5.14.6 states that the applicant should set out the arrangements proposed for 
managing waste and include information on the proposed waste recovery and 
disposal system.   
2.8.49 Paragraph 5.15.1 of NPS EN-1 advises that infrastructure development can have 
adverse effects during the construction, operation and decommissioning phases on 
the water environment, including groundwater, inland surface water, transitional 
waters and coastal waters.  Accordingly, the applicant should undertake an 
assessment of “the existing status of, and impacts of the proposed project on, 
water quality, water resources and physical characteristics of the water 
environment as part of the ES” (paragraph 5.15.2).  Paragraphs 5.15.9 and 5.15.10 
advise that the impacts on the water environment and local water resources can be 
mitigated through careful design.   
b) National Policy Statement for Fossil fuel Electricity Generating Infrastructure 
(NPS EN-2) 
2.8.50 NPS EN-2 (Ref. 2.16) outlines considerations and factors relating to site selection 
and design for developers for fossil fuel generating stations. NPS EN-2 also sets 
out a number of specific impacts that could arise from a fossil fuel generating NSIP 
and criteria by which they should be assessed.  
2.8.51 Paragraph 1.1.1 of NPS EN-2 states “Fossil fuel generating stations play a vital role 
in providing reliable electricity supplies and a secure and diverse energy mix as the 
UK makes the transition to a low carbon economy…” 
2.8.52 Paragraph 1.2.1 of NPS EN-2 states that, NPS EN-2, together with NPS EN-1, 
provides the primary basis for decisions by the SoS on applications for nationally 
significant fossil fuel electricity generating stations. 
2.8.53 Part 2 of NPS EN-2 provides additional guidance to Part 4 and Part 5 of EN-1 
regarding the assessment of impacts specifically associated with fossil fuel 
generating stations.   
Abergelli ES 2018 – CHAPTER 2: REGULATORY AND POLICY BACKGROUND 
 
Prepared for:  Abergelli Power Limited 
 
AECOM 
2-15 
 
2.8.54 Paragraph 2.2.1 of NPS EN-2, "it is for energy companies to decide which 
applications to bring forward and the government does not seek to direct applicants 
to particular sites for fossil fuel generating stations." 
2.8.55 NPS EN-2 notes that “Fossil fuel generating stations have large land footprints and 
will therefore only be possible where the applicant is able to acquire a suitably-
sized site” (NPS EN-2, paragraph 2.2.2). It also notes that “Applicants should locate 
new fossil fuel generating stations in the vicinity of existing transport routes 
wherever possible.”   
2.8.56 Section 2.3 of NPS EN-2 states that government policy criteria for fossil fuel 
generation stations relating to – CHP, CCR, Carbon Capture and Storage, climate 
change adaptation, and “good design” – must be met before consent is given. 
2.8.57 Section 2.3.13 of NPS EN-2 sets out considerations specifically for fossil fuel 
generating stations in respect of climate change. NPS EN-2 suggests that as fossil 
fuel generating stations are likely to be proposed for coastal or estuarine sites, 
applicants should set out how the proposal would be resilient to: “coastal changes 
and increased risk from storm surge; effects of higher temperatures, including 
higher temperatures of cooling water; and increased risk of drought leading to a 
lack of available cooling water” (paragraph 2.3.13).  
2.8.58 Paragraph 2.3.16 of NPS EN-2 states that, “Applicants should demonstrate good 
design particularly in respect of landscape and visual amenity ...and in the design 
of the project to mitigate impacts such as noise and vibration, transport impacts and 
air emissions.” 
2.8.59 Section 2.4 of NPS EN-2 contains additional policy for assessing the potential 
impacts of energy infrastructure projects for fossil fuel generating stations, relating 
to: “air emissions; landscape and visual; noise and vibration; release of dust by 
coal-fired generating stations; residue management for coal-fired generating 
stations; and water quality and resources” (paragraph 2.4.1). 
2.8.60 Paragraph 2.5.2 of NPS EN-2 acknowledges that CO2 emissions are a “significant 
adverse impact of fossil fuel generating stations”.  As such, paragraph 2.5.5 of EN-
2 states that an assessment should be carried out at the initial stages of developing 
proposals, and Paragraph 2.5.8 of EN-2 states that the SoS and NRW (the relevant 
authority in Wales) should be satisfied that the potential adverse impacts of 
mitigation measures are assessed.   
2.8.61 Paragraph 2.6.2 of NPS EN-2 advises that the main structures of a fossil fuel 
generating station – including the turbine and boiler halls, exhaust gas stacks, 
storage facilities, cooling towers, and water processing plant – are large and likely 
to “have an impact on the surrounding landscape and visual amenity”.  A landscape 
and visual impact assessment should therefore be included as part of the ES, and 
consideration should be given to the design of the plant, the materials to be used, 
and the visual impact of the stack (paragraphs 2.6.3 and 2.6.4).  Paragraph 2.6.5 of 
EN-2 states that mitigation is to “minimise impact on visual amenity as far as 
reasonably practicable”; however, the visibility of a fossil fuel generating station 
Abergelli ES 2018 – CHAPTER 2: REGULATORY AND POLICY BACKGROUND 
 
Prepared for:  Abergelli Power Limited 
 
AECOM 
2-16 
 
should be given limited weight if the SoS is satisfied that the location is appropriate 
for the project and that it has been designed sensitively (paragraph 2.6.10).  
2.8.62 Paragraph 2.7.1 of NPS EN-2 advises that the sources of noise and vibration from 
fossil fuel generating stations may include the gas and steam turbines and external 
noise sources such as externally-sited air-cooled condensers.  Paragraph 2.7.2 of 
EN-2 states that the ES should include a noise assessment, and paragraph 2.7.5 of 
NPS EN-2 states that mitigation should be achieved through “good design”, 
including enclosure of plant and machinery in noise-reducing buildings where 
possible.  
2.8.63 Paragraph 2.10.1 of NPS EN-2 advises that water cooling systems for fossil fuel 
generating stations may have additional impacts on water quality, abstraction and 
discharge.  Where the project is likely to have an effect on water quality and 
resources, Paragraph 2.10.2 of EN-2 states that an assessment should be 
undertaken to “demonstrate that appropriate measures will be put in place to avoid 
or minimise adverse impacts of abstraction and discharge of cooling water.”  
c) National Policy Statement for Gas Supply Infrastructure and Gas and Oil 
Pipelines (EN-4) 
2.8.64 NPS EN-4 (Ref. 2.17), together with NPS EN-1, provides the primary basis for 
decisions by the SoS on applications for gas supply infrastructure and gas and oil 
pipelines (Paragraph 1.2.1).  However, the DCO application does not include Gas 
Connection apparatus for the Project, so the decision making policies in NPS EN-4 
will not be directly applicable.  However, section 2.19 addresses gas and oil 
pipelines and identifies factors that should influence site selection by project 
promoters.  These include noise and vibration, biodiversity, landscape and visual 
effects, soil and geology and effects on water quality and resources.   
2.8.65 Chapter 5: Alternatives Considered of this ES includes a description of 
alternatives considered and route selection for the Gas Connection route.  The 
environmental effects of the Gas Connection are considered within each topic-
specific chapter in this ES.  Accordingly, NPS EN-4 will be of relevance as a matter 
that the SoS may consider important and relevant in the context of the routing of 
the Gas Connection and powers of compulsory acquisition sought, rather than 
being directly applicable to the Power Generation Plant itself.   
2.8.66 Relevant guidance on the assessment of impacts of gas supply infrastructure is 
summarised below, and regard has been had to this guidance in preparation of this 
ES. 
2.8.67 Part 2 of NPS EN-4 provides additional guidance to Part 4 and Part 5 of EN-1 
regarding the assessment of impacts specific to gas supply infrastructure and oil 
and gas pipelines. 
2.8.68 Sections 2.20 – 2.23 of NPS EN-4 set out additional policy for assessing the 
potential impacts of gas and oil pipelines, relating to: noise and vibration; 
Abergelli ES 2018 – CHAPTER 2: REGULATORY AND POLICY BACKGROUND 
 
Prepared for:  Abergelli Power Limited 
 
AECOM 
2-17 
 
biodiversity, landscape and visual; water quality and resources; and soil and 
geology. 
2.8.69 Paragraph 2.20.2 of NPS EN-4 states that there are specific noise and vibration 
impacts which apply to gas pipelines, including: “During the pre-construction phase 
there could be vibration effects from seismic surveys. During construction, tasks 
may include site clearance, soil movement, ground excavation, tunnelling, 
trenching, pipe laying and welding, and ground reinstatement. In addition, 
increased HGV traffic will be generated on local roads for the movement of 
materials.”  The ES should include an assessment of all of the above noise and 
vibration effects during the pre-construction and construction phases (paragraph 
2.20.5).  
2.8.70 Paragraph 2.21.1 of NPS EN-4 states that the construction of a pipeline can impact 
upon “specific landscape elements within and adjacent to the pipeline route, such 
as grasslands, field boundaries (hedgerows, hedgebanks, drystone walls, fences), 
trees, woodlands, and watercourses.”  Accordingly, the ES should include “an 
assessment of the biodiversity and landscape and visual effects of the proposed 
route and of the main alternative routes considered” (paragraph 2.21.3 of EN4).  
Where it is not possible to restore the landscape to its original state, Paragraph 
2.21.3 of EN-4 also states that “the applicant should set out measures to avoid, 
mitigate, or employ other landscape measures to compensate for, any adverse 
effect on the landscape.”  
2.8.71 Paragraph 2.22.2 of NPS EN-4 advises that “constructing pipelines creates 
corridors of surface clearance and excavation that can potentially affect 
watercourses, aquifers, water abstraction and discharge points, areas prone to 
flooding and ecological receptors.”  As such, an assessment should be provided in 
the ES “where the project is likely to have effects on water resources or water 
quality,” for example through impacts on: “groundwater recharge or on existing 
surface water or ground abstraction points; associated ecological receptors,” or 
through: “siltation or spillages, discharges from maintenance activities or the 
discharge of disposals such as wastewater or solvents” (paragraphs 2.22.3 and 
2.22.4).  
2.8.72 Paragraph 2.23.1 of NPS EN-4 states that “it will be important for applicants to 
understand the soil types and the nature of the underlying strata.”  Accordingly, 
applicants should consult with the relevant statutory consultees at an early stage 
regarding the potential impact of gas pipelines on soil and geology (paragraph 
2.23.4).  Paragraph 2.23.2 states that applicants should assess the stability of the 
ground conditions associated with the pipeline route, including considering the 
options for installing the pipeline.  
d) National Policy Statement for Electricity Networks Infrastructure  (EN-5) 
2.8.73 NPS EN-5 (Ref. 2.18), together with NPS EN-1, provides the primary basis for 
decisions by the SoS on applications for electricity networks infrastructure.  
However, the DCO application does not include Electrical Connection apparatus for 
the Project, and the connection will be by underground cable, so the decision 
Abergelli ES 2018 – CHAPTER 2: REGULATORY AND POLICY BACKGROUND 
 
Prepared for:  Abergelli Power Limited 
 
AECOM 
2-18 
 
making policies in NPS EN-5 will not be directly applicable.  Relevant guidance on 
the assessment of impacts underground electrical connections is summarised 
below, and regard has been had to this guidance in preparation of this ES. 
2.8.74 Part 2 of NPS EN-5 provides additional guidance to Part 4 and Part 5 of EN-1 
regarding the assessment of impacts specific to electricity networks infrastructure 
2.8.75 Paragraph 2.8.9 of NPS EN-5 notes, “The impacts and costs of both overhead and 
underground options vary considerably between individual projects (both in 
absolute and relative terms). Therefore, each project should be assessed 
individually on the basis of its specific circumstances and taking account of the fact 
that Government has not laid down any general rule about when an overhead line 
should be considered unacceptable.” 
2.8.76 Paragraph 2.10.1 of NPS EN-5 advises that “power frequency Electric and 
Magnetic Fields (EMFs) arise from generation, transmission, distribution and use of 
electricity and will occur around power lines and electric cables...”  Paragraph 
2.10.15 of EN-5 states that in order to mitigate for EMFs, the applicant should 
consider: height, position, insulation and protection measures; optimal phasing of 
high voltage overhead power lines where possible and practicable; and any new 
Government advice. 
2.9 
Other Government Policy 
2.9.1 
The NPSs have been informed by and followed by other government policy and 
evidence as to the need for viable proposals to contribute towards greater reliability 
of electricity supply in the UK.  
2.9.2 
To ensure that there is reliability of supply, it is Government policy that the 
electricity generation mix needs to incorporate a balance of technologies that 
continuously and reliably produce stable and controllable power and that within this 
scenario, gas-fuelled electricity generating technologies can play a significant role.  
In the Annual Energy Statement (AES) (latest version published October 2014) 
(Ref. 2.19), DECC (now BEIS) supported the role of gas in the energy sector and 
directed the need to build new power generation infrastructure.  
2.9.3 
The AES identifies the need to retain sufficient power generation capacity following 
the rapid closure of existing capacity, and acknowledges the role of gas in the 
energy sector.  The Statement also sets out the Government’s long-term direction 
for reducing energy demand and safeguarding energy security, by increasing the 
proportion of energy from renewable and low carbon sources. 
2.9.4 
The Welsh Government policy statement,  “A Low Carbon Revolution: Wales’ 
Energy Policy Statement, March 2010” (Ref. 2.20), reflects, in terms of energy 
production, the work of the UK Climate Change Commission and the UK National 
Policy Statements on Energy and Renewables. The statement sets out a 
framework for carbon reduction in Wales, provides targets and advice to local 
planning authorities (LPAs) for implementation of policy into Local Development 
Plans (LDPs). In particular it aims to maximise energy savings and energy

Prepared for:  Abergelli Power Limited 
 
AECOM 
2-19 
 
efficiency to make producing the majority of the energy that Wales needs from low 
carbon sources that are feasible and less costly. The statement recognises energy 
needs in a modern society will remain considerable. 
2.9.5 
The “Electricity Market Reform White Paper – Planning our electric future: a White 
Paper for secure, affordable and low-carbon electricity” (DECC, 2011) (Ref. 2.21) 
“sets out the Government’s commitment to transform the UK’s electricity system to 
ensure that our future electricity supply is secure, low-carbon and affordable.” A key 
part of this wide ranging reform is the introduction of a “Capacity Mechanism” in 
order “to guarantee future security of electricity supply as a quarter of ageing plant 
closes during this decade and the proportion of intermittent or less flexible low-
carbon generation rises” (paragraph 1.35).   
2.9.6 
The White Paper sets out, at page 24, a vision for the Electricity System following 
reform, in which it is stated “The electricity grid has evolved to accommodate more 
localised and intermittent sources of generation, as well as being smarter and more 
responsive.” A significant focus of the White Paper is to decarbonise electricity 
generation in the long term, although it is acknowledged at paragraph 2.4.23 that 
“we are going to need new, unabated gas in the next few years.”  
2.9.7 
“The Carbon Plan - delivering our low carbon future” (HM Government, 2011) (Ref. 
2.22) sets out the Coalition Government’s policies for how the UK will achieve 
decarbonisation within the framework of its energy policy; making the transition to 
low carbon economy while maintaining energy security, and minimising costs to 
customers. Paragraph 2.146 of the Plan recognises that the nature of the electricity 
network will need to change so that it becomes smarter at balancing demand and 
supply as generation/supply become more intermittent and demand increases. In 
light of this the Plan states that on the way to 2050, some flexible fossil fuel plant is 
likely to be needed to ensure security of supply. Paragraph 2.147 states that over 
the next decade, the UK will need to invest in new generation capacity to replace 
the coal and nuclear power stations that are set to close by the early 2020s in order 
to maintain our energy security, while meeting our legal commitments to reduce 
carbon emissions and increase renewable electricity generation. Paragraph 2.148 
goes on to outline that to do this, the coming years will see a continuation of 
previous trends, which will include more switching from coal to gas-powered 
generation. Thus the Carbon Plan reinforces the position set out in the White Paper 
and acknowledges that to meet our energy security needs and make the transition 
to a low carbon economy, gas will continue to play a valuable role. 
2.9.8 
“Energy Wales – a Low Carbon Transition” (Welsh Government, March 2012) (Ref. 
2.23) states, at page 10, that “Gas will be a key transitional fuel because 
greenhouse gas emissions from gas are significantly less than coal subject to the 
method of extraction. Gas is a flexible, responsive and reliable source of energy 
which can play a key role in the transition to a genuinely low carbon energy 
system”. In the short term, gas, nuclear and bio-energy will provide the energy to 
compensate for the intermittency in supply from renewable resources.

2.9.9 
“Electricity System: Assessment of Future Challenges – Annex” (DECC, August 
2012) (Ref. 2.24) seeks to fully understand the implications of the challenges posed 
by moving to an energy mix with a greater proportion of intermittent and less 
flexible generation and identify means of addressing them.  The overall aim is to 
ensure that the electricity system can facilitate future low carbon generation and 
expected increases in electricity demand in the most secure and affordable way, 
with the most efficient use of assets.  Again, there is acknowledgement of the 
continued role for unabated gas fired generating plant. Paragraph 3.8 states that 
over the next two decades, gas will continue to play a key role in the UK’s energy 
mix alongside other lower carbon electricity sources.  The paragraph goes on to 
state that new gas generation capacity will be needed to ensure security of supply, 
and to balance the electricity system as more low carbon technology becomes 
available.  
2.9.10 The “Electricity Capacity Report” (ECR) (National Grid, May 2017) (Ref. 2.25) 
summarises the modelling analysis undertaken regarding the amount of capacity to 
be secured for delivery in 2018/19 and 2021/22.  The report states that there is 
expected to be an increase in capacity requirements for 2018/19, compared to the 
2014 ECR, and for 2021/22, when compared to the 2016 ECR, based on a higher 
assumed peak demand.  
2.9.11 The “Gas Generation Strategy” (DECC, December 2012) (Ref. 2.26) consolidates 
the range of government policy as set out above in setting out the important role for 
gas generation. It is stated that as a reliable, flexible source of electricity it will play 
a part in any future generation mix, supporting a secure, low-carbon and affordable 
electricity system. It states that “Gas currently forms an integral part of the UK’s 
generation mix and is a reliable, flexible source of electricity. Using gas as a fuel in 
our power stations currently provides a significant proportion of our electricity 
generation (around 40% in 2011)” (Executive Summary). Moreover, it suggests that 
there could be as much as 26 gigawatts (GW) of new gas generation infrastructure 
required if the decarbonisation target is set at 200 g/CO2/kWh. It also indicates that 
in 2030 we could need more overall gas capacity than we have today, although 
operating at lower load factors, reflecting the role of ‘peaking’ plant in backing up 
intermittent sources of energy generation. “The modelling shows that gas could 
play a more extensive role, with higher load factors, should the 4th Carbon Budget 
be revised upwards” (Executive Summary). The strategy also presents scenarios at 
Table 2B on page 22 which indicate that up to 41 GW of new gas generation 
capacity will be needed by 2030 to underpin long term electricity supplies and 
provide back-up to nuclear and wind generation at times of peak demand. 
2.9.12 The 2014 National Infrastructure Plan (HM Treasury, December 2014) (Ref. 2.27) 
provides explicit support for this type of project, stating: “New gas plant is also 
needed and will be vital in supplying a backup for less flexible renewable 
generation and ensuring that the system can meet peak electricity demand” 
(Paragraph 8.4).  Paragraph 8.3 adds that, “Large-scale investment in gas and low-
carbon electricity generation is vital in order to replace ageing energy infrastructure, 
maintain secure energy supplies and meet legally-binding environmental targets.”

2.9.13 In October 2016, The Energy and Climate Change Committee published “The 
energy revolution and future challenges for UK energy and climate change policy 
— Third Report of Session 2016–17” (Ref 2.28). The report reflects on upcoming 
challenges for UK energy and climate policy. For energy supply it states that “The 
Government should seek to build investor confidence, to avoid exacerbating 
difficulties in bringing forward investment in new electricity capacity and new 
indigenous resources. The Government should also examine the role of the 
‘solidarity principle’ in managing potential gas crises, specifically how the UK can 
continue to participate. If excluded from the ‘solidarity principle’ the UK Government 
must urgently investigate alternative back-up arrangements to ensure security of 
supply in the event of a crisis” (Paragraph 111). 
2.9.14 The “Final Report of the Industrial Strategy Commission” (Industrial Strategy 
Commission, November 2017) (Ref 2.29) reinforces that “the availability of a secure 
and reliable energy supply is a central concern” and emphasises that there is a 
“pressing need” to decarbonise energy supplies due to the impacts of climate 
change (page 58). 
2.10 
Welsh Planning Policy 
2.10.1 Section 104 of the PA 2008 requires the SoS to have regard to any Local Impact 
Report and other matters which the SoS “thinks are both important and relevant to 
the Secretary of State’s decision”, which may include Planning Policy Wales 
(PPW), Technical Advice Notes (TANs), The Wales Spatial Plan, Unitary 
Development Plans (UDPs), (LDPs) or other local policy documents in Wales as 
set out below. 
a) Planning Policy Wales (Edition 9, November 2016) (PPW) and associated 
Technical Advice Notes (TAN) 
2.10.2 PPW (Ref. 2.30) sets out the land use planning policies of the Welsh Government 
and is supplemented by 24 topic-based TANs.  TANs prescribe the government’s 
policies on various planning issues that shape the preparation of development 
plans.  The principles and objectives of TANs prescribe the overarching national 
guidance for specific individual environmental topics.  TANs relevant to the Project 
include: 
 TAN 5: Nature Conservation and Planning (2009) (Ref 2.31); 
 TAN 6: Planning for Sustainable Rural Communities (2010) (Ref 2.32); 
 TAN 11: Noise (1997) (Ref 2.33); 
 TAN 12: Design (2016) (Ref 2.34); 
 TAN 15: Development and Flood Risk (2004) (Ref 2.35);

2.10.3 Both the PPW and TANs may be considered to be relevant and important under the 
PA 2008 regime.  The provisions of the PPW and TANs which are of potential 
relevance to the Project are set out below. 
2.10.4 PPW Chapter 4, “Planning for Sustainability”, sets out the principles and objectives 
underpinning the Welsh Government’s approach to planning policy for sustainable 
development.  
2.10.5 The definition of sustainable development in Wales is given in Chapter 4 as: ”the 
process of improving the economic, social, environmental and cultural well-being of 
Wales by taking action, in accordance with the sustainable development principle, 
aimed at achieving the well-being goals.” (PPW Figure 4.2). 
2.10.6 PPW Paragraph 4.2.2 highlights that “the planning system provides for a 
presumption in favour of sustainable development to ensure that social, economic 
and environmental issues are balanced and integrated”. 
2.10.7 PPW Section 4.4 outlines the objectives for the planning system which reflect the 
Welsh Government’s view for sustainable development and the outcomes they 
seek to deliver across Wales. A summary of the relevant objectives (paragraph 
4.4.3) is listed below: 
 “Promote resource-efficient and climate change resilient settlement patterns…;” 
 “Play an appropriate role in securing the provision of infrastructure to form the 
physical basis for sustainable communities” (including energy supplies and 
distribution networks); 
 “Encourage opportunities to reduce waste and all forms of pollution and 
promote good environmental management and best environmental practice;” 
 “Promote a low carbon economy and social enterprises;” 
 “Support initiative and innovation and avoid placing unnecessary burdens on 
enterprises…so as to enhance the economic success of both urban and rural 
areas…;” 
 “Contribute to the protection and improvement of the environment, so as to 
improve the quality of life, and protect local and global ecosystems;” 
 “Minimise the risks posed by, or to, development on or adjacent to unstable or 
contaminated land and land liable to flooding;” 
 “Promote quality, lasting, environmentally-sound and flexible employment 
opportunities;” 
 “Contribute to the protection and, where possible, the improvement of people’s 
health and wellbeing as a core component of sustainable development and 
responding to climate change;” 
 “Promote access to employment, shopping, education, health, community, 
leisure and sports facilities and open and green space, maximising 
opportunities for community development and social welfare;” 
 “Respect and encourage diversity in the local economy;” 
 “Foster improvements to transport facilities and services which maintain or 
improve accessibility to services and facilities, secure employment, economic 
and environmental objectives, and improve safety and amenity;”

 “Foster social inclusion by ensuring that full advantage is taken of the 
opportunities to secure a more accessible environment for everyone that the 
development of land and buildings provides;” and 
 Support the need to tackle the causes of climate change by moving towards a 
low carbon economy.” 
2.10.8 PPW Chapter 4 is supplemented by TAN 6 “Planning for Sustainable Rural 
Communities” (2010) (Ref 2.32), which provides practical guidance on how the 
planning system can contribute to: sustainable rural economies; sustainable rural 
housing; sustainable rural services and sustainable agriculture.  TAN 6 recognises 
that “strong rural economies are essential to support sustainable and vibrant rural 
communities” (paragraph 3.1.1) and supports the “diversification of the rural 
economy by accommodating the needs of both traditional rural industries and new 
enterprises, whilst minimising impacts on the local community and the environment” 
(paragraph 3.1.2).  
2.10.9 TAN 12, “Design,” (2016) (Ref. 2.34) should also be considered in conjunction with 
Chapter 4 of PPW.  This TAN sets out the objectives of good design and aims to 
encourage good design in all aspects of development, stating that: “The way in 
which development relates to its urban or rural landscape context or seascape 
context is critical to its success” (paragraph 5.5.1).  “The aim should be to achieve 
good design solutions, which maximise the natural landscape assets and minimise 
environmental impact on the landscape.  It is particularly important that proposals 
to amend or create new landscape are not considered as an afterthought and that 
the long term impact of development on the landscape is fully understood” 
(paragraph 5.5.2). 
2.10.10 TAN 18, “Transport,” (2007) (Ref. 2.36) provides guidance on issues relating to 
sustainable development through transport, so represents a further supplementary 
document to Chapter 4. TAN 18 describes how to integrate land use and transport 
planning and explains how transport impacts should be assessed and mitigated. 
2.10.11 PPW Chapter 5, “Conserving and Improving Natural Heritage and the Coast,” sets 
out the Welsh Government’s overarching advice on the conservation of biodiversity 
and the coast in a planning context. The chapter sets out objectives for 
conservation that should be delivered via the planning process. It includes 
guidance on integrating the requirements of development and conservation, and 
highlights existing measures for biodiversity conservation (legislation and policy) in 
Wales.  
2.10.12 The approach to conservation delivered through PPW is similar to the general 
principles contained within NPS EN-1 which states that development should aim to 
avoid significant harm to biodiversity and geological conservation interests through 
mitigation and consideration of reasonable alternatives. Paragraph 5.3.6 of NPS 
EN-1 does however suggest that “the benefits of nationally significant low carbon 
energy infrastructure development may include benefits for biodiversity and 
geological conservation interests and these benefits may outweigh harm to these 
interests”.  
Abergelli ES 2018 – CHAPTER 2: REGULATORY AND POLICY BACKGROUND 
 
Prepared for:  Abergelli Power Limited 
 
AECOM 
2-24 
 
2.10.13 PPW Chapter 5 is supplemented by TAN 5 ”Nature Conservation and Planning” 
(2009) (Ref. 2.31), which is concerned with the protection of statutorily designated 
site and habitats, the conservation of protected and priority species; and protecting 
and enhancing biodiversity and nature conservation in the wider countryside within 
Wales. 
2.10.14 PPW Chapter 7, “Economic Development,” refers to the Welsh Government 
definition of economic development as development of land and buildings for 
activities that generate wealth, jobs and incomes (paragraph 7.1.1).  This 
paragraph also notes that the “construction and energy sectors are important to the 
economy and sensitive to planning policies”.  
2.10.15 It is likely to be relevant to consider the provisions of the NPSs in light of the Welsh 
Government’s definition of economic development. In paragraph 2.1.2 of NPS EN-1 
it states that “energy is vital to economic prosperity and social well-being” and as 
such, it is important to ensure that the UK has secure and affordable energy and 
the infrastructure in place to deliver this. Section 5.12 of the NPS outlines that the 
applicant should assess socio-economic impacts of proposals, which will include 
giving due consideration to the creation of jobs and training opportunities. 
2.10.16 TAN 23, “Economic Development” (2014) (Ref. 2.39), provides additional 
interpretation to chapter 7.  PPW chapter 7 states that the planning system should 
support economic and employment growth alongside social and environmental 
considerations within the context of sustainable development (paragraph 7.1.3). 
TAN 23 contains the concept of “larger than local planning”, which advises that 
market forces do not respect local authority boundaries and therefore the planning 
system should ensure that it steers development to the most efficient and 
sustainable locations.  This means that strategic planning for economic 
development is essential.  Paragraph 2.1.1 addresses the need to weigh economic 
benefits and states that “it should not be assumed that economic objectives are 
necessarily in conflict with social and environmental objectives”.  The TAN advises 
that the planning system should positively and imaginatively seek win-win 
outcomes (paragraph 2.1.1). 
2.10.17 PPW Chapter 12, “Infrastructure and Services,” emphasises the importance of 
infrastructure projects to Wales: “Adequate and efficient infrastructure, including 
services such as education and health facilities along with water supply, sewers, 
waste management, electricity and gas (the utilities) and telecommunications, is 
crucial for the economic, social and environmental sustainability of all parts of 
Wales” (paragraph 12.1.1). 
2.10.18 The Welsh Government aims to secure the environmental and telecommunications 
infrastructure necessary to meet sustainable development objectives, which are 
listed in paragraph 12.1.4 of PPW.  The objectives considered to be relevant for the 
purposes of this project are listed as follows: 
 
“To promote the generation and use of energy from renewable and low carbon 
energy sources at all scales and promote energy efficiency, especially as a 
Abergelli ES 2018 – CHAPTER 2: REGULATORY AND POLICY BACKGROUND 
 
Prepared for:  Abergelli Power Limited 
 
AECOM 
2-25 
 
means to secure zero or low carbon developments and to tackle the causes of 
climate change;” 
 
“To promote an integrated approach to the provision and renewal of 
environmental and telecommunications infrastructure;” 
 
“To ensure that environmental and telecommunications infrastructure is 
provided in such a way as to enable sustainable development objectives to be 
met, avoiding adverse impacts on the environment (including the natural and 
historic environment), local communities and health;” 
 
“To ensure that in considering environmental and telecommunications 
infrastructure account is taken of the impacts of climate change in the location, 
design, build, operation and, where appropriate, the decommissioning of new 
infrastructure (see 4.5 [of PPW6]);” and 
 
“To ensure that the vulnerability of infrastructure to severe weather events is 
minimised and that infrastructure is designed to cope with higher average 
temperatures and increasing risk of storm surges, drought and flooding.” 
2.10.19 Section 12.8.6 of PPW outlines that it is the Welsh government’s aim to, “secure an 
appropriate mix of energy provision for Wales which maximises benefits to our 
economy and communities, whilst minimising potential environmental and social 
impacts. This forms part of the Welsh Government’s aim to secure the strongest 
economic development policies to underpin growth and prosperity in Wales 
recognising the importance of clean energy and the efficient use of natural 
resources, both as an economic driver and a commitment to sustainable 
development.”  
2.10.20 For the purposes of planning policy, 12.8.7 of PPW defines “low carbon energy” as 
the term used to cover technologies that are energy efficient (but does not include 
nuclear).  Figure 12.2 sets out the scales of development, for planning purposes, 
for low carbon and renewable energy projects.  It acknowledges that an energy 
project is deemed to be “strategic” when it exceeds a threshold of 50MW for all 
technologies other than onshore wind.  Additionally the PPW recognises the role of 
the SoS in deciding onshore projects of an installation size of over 50 MW. 
2.10.21 PPW Chapter 13, “Minimising and Managing Environmental Risks and Pollution,” is 
concerned with maximising environmental protection for people, natural and 
cultural resources, property and infrastructure; and preventing or managing 
pollution and promoting good environmental practice (paragraph 13.1.2).  
2.10.22 Chapter 13 is supplemented by TAN 15, “Development and Flood Risk” (2004) 
(Ref. 2.35), which provides a precautionary framework to guide planning decisions 
within which risks arising from both river and coastal flooding, and from additional 
run-off from development in any location, can be assessed.  
2.10.23 PPW Chapter 13 is also supplemented by TAN 11, “Noise” (1997) (Ref. 2.33), 
which provides advice on “how the planning system can be used to minimise the 
adverse impact of noise without placing unreasonable restrictions on development 
or adding unduly to the costs and administrative burdens of business”. It outlines 
some of the main considerations which LPAs should take into account in 
Abergelli ES 2018 – CHAPTER 2: REGULATORY AND POLICY BACKGROUND 
 
Prepared for:  Abergelli Power Limited 
 
AECOM 
2-26 
 
determining planning applications for development which will either generate noise 
or be exposed to existing noise sources. 
2.10.24 PPW Chapter 14 sets out land use planning policy guidance in relation to mineral 
extraction and related development in Wales, which includes all minerals and 
substances in, on or under land extracted either by underground or surface 
working.  The key principles are: 
 
“To provide for an adequate supply of minerals that society needs now and in 
the future, together with protecting and improving amenity; 
 
To protect things that are highly cherished for their intrinsic qualities, such as 
wildlife, landscapes and historic features; and to protect human health and 
safety by ensuring that environmental impacts caused by mineral extraction 
and transportation are within acceptable limits; and to secure, without 
compromise, restoration and aftercare to provide for appropriate and beneficial 
after-use; 
 
To help conserve non-renewable resources for future generations through 
efficient use, recycling and waste prevention; to protect renewable resources 
from serious harm or pollution; and to promote the use of appropriate 
alternative materials; and 
 
To ensure an adequate supply of minerals that are needed at prices that are 
reasonable; and to safeguard mineral resources for future generations.” 
2.10.25 TAN 20, “Planning and the Welsh Language” (2017) (Ref. 2.37), provides guidance 
on how the Welsh language may be given appropriate consideration in the planning 
system, particularly in respect of LDPs, development management and signs and 
advertisements.  Paragraph 3.1.1 notes that, “Planning decisions should be 
concerned with the use of land rather than the identity or personal characteristics of 
the user.” The appropriate use of the Welsh language has been considered 
throughout pre-application consultation and in the preparation of the DCO 
Application. 
2.10.26 TAN 21, “Waste” (2014) (Ref. 2.38), advises on the role of land use planning in the 
management and control of waste. Guidance is based on the principles of the 
waste hierarchy, which seeks to prevent waste in the first instance, or alternatively 
re-use or recycle waste.  The principles in TAN 21 have been applied in 
consideration of waste issues for the Project. 
b) Minerals Technical Advice Notes 
2.10.27 Minerals planning policy set out in PPW is supplemented by topic-based Minerals 
Technical Advice Notes (MTANs). 
2.10.28 Two MTANs have been produced, one concerning aggregates (MTAN 1, March 
2004) (Ref. 2.40) and the other concerning coal (MTAN 2, 2009) (Ref 2.41).  
2.10.29 They set out detailed advice on the mechanisms for delivering the policy for coal 
extraction, through surface and underground working, by mineral planning 
authorities and the coal mining industry and may be material in the determination of 
applications under the Town & Country Planning Act 1990 (“TCPA 1990”).  
Abergelli ES 2018 – CHAPTER 2: REGULATORY AND POLICY BACKGROUND

AECOM 
2-27 
 
2.10.30 The Project Site is located on land identified within local planning policy with coal 
and sand and aggregate resources (section 2.10) and therefore the two MTANs 
may, potentially be considered relevant in relation to NSIP applications under the 
PA 2008, in interpreting land use criteria contained in the relevant NPS.  
c) Wales Spatial Plan 
2.10.31 The Wales Spatial Plan (Ref 2.42) was adopted by the Welsh Government in 2004 
and updated in 2008. 
2.10.32 The purpose of the Wales Spatial Plan is “to ensure that what is done in the public, 
private and third sectors in Wales is integrated and sustainable, and that actions 
within an area support each other and jointly move towards a shared vision for 
Wales and for the different parts of Wales” (paragraph 1.5). The Plan identifies six 
sub-regions in Wales but does not define these Spatial Plan Areas by 
administrative boundaries, allowing partners to work together on common issues in 
a flexible way.  The Spatial Plan area which the Project Site falls under is ”Swansea 
Bay – Waterfront and Western Valleys”. 
2.10.33 Chapter 11 recognises that the economy in Wales has a spatial dimension. 
Paragraph 11.1 recognises that while some areas adjoining the English border 
have economic performance characteristics fairly similar to the UK average, the 
more western areas and the former coal-mining areas lag behind.  
2.10.34 Paragraph 11.6 states the need to take a joint approach with local authorities, travel 
consortia, and others to tackling regional infrastructure problems on issues of 
housing, transport, water, sewerage, energy, waste and information and 
communications technology (ICT). 
d) Environment Strategy for Wales (2006) 
2.10.35 The Environment Strategy for Wales (Ref 2.43) was published in 2006 and outlines 
the Welsh Government’s long term strategy for the environment of Wales over the 
next 20 years. The purpose of the Strategy is to provide a framework within which 
to “achieve an environment which is clean, healthy, biologically diverse and valued 
by the people of Wales”, such that by 2026, the Welsh environment is “thriving and 
contributing to the economic and social well-being and health of all of the people of 
Wales” (page 3).  
2.10.36 The Environment Strategy has 5 main environmental issues: addressing climate 
change; sustainable resource use; distinctive biodiversity, landscapes and 
seascapes; the local environment; and environmental hazards.  For each of the 
environmental themes, the Strategy explains the issues, proposed outcomes and 
associated indicators and timelines for delivery. 
2.10.37 The Environment Strategy is currently being reviewed by the Welsh Government to 
ensure that it reflects the relevant commitments in the Natural Resource 
Management Programme.

e) Noise Action Plan for Wales 2013 – 2018 
2.10.38 The Noise Action Plan (Ref 2.44), produced by the Welsh Government, describes 
how and why environmental noise is managed across Wales and includes a 
chapter devoted to noise management in the built up area of Swansea and Neath 
Port Talbot.  It includes the identification of Quiet Areas and Priority Areas.  The 
Project Site does not lie within or in the vicinity of the designated areas, however 
the general principles of the Noise Action Plan may be of relevance. 
2.11 
Local Planning Policy 
2.11.1 In deciding an application under the PA 2008, the SoS must have regard to the 
NPSs and "any other matters which the Secretary of State thinks are both important 
and relevant to the Secretary of State's decision" (Section 104(2)(d) of the PA 
2008).  Local planning policy guidance on land use and environmental protection 
may be considered by the Secretary of State to be a relevant and important matter 
to which regard should be had in the decision making for the Power Generating 
Plant.   
2.11.2 The relevant development plan for the Project Site is the CCS UDP which is 
considered further below. 
2.11.3 In addition, draft and supplementary local planning policy, referred to below, are 
material considerations under the TCPA 1990 regime and may also be “important 
and relevant” (Section 104(2)(d) of the PA 2008) to the determination of the DCO 
Application. 
a) Development Plan 
2.11.4 The CCS UDP (Ref 2.45) was adopted in November 2008 and comprises the UDP 
Proposals Map and UDP Written Statement.  The UDP is the key development plan 
document for the area which provides a range of policies and proposals relating to 
future development within CCS up to 2016. 
i. 
CCS UDP 2008 Proposals Map and site-specific policies 
2.11.5 As shown on the UDP Proposals Map (Figures 2-1 and 2-2), the Project Site is 
located on land identified as “Coal” and “Sand and Aggregates”, where UDP 
Policies R2 and R4 respectively apply. Policy R2 states that development proposals 
that would affect the working of known potential resources will have to be 
accompanied by a full assessment of the potential resource and the impact of the 
proposal in terms of sterilising the resource. Similarly, Policy R4 states that 
development proposals that would affect the working of known potential mineral 
resources will have to be accompanied by a full assessment of the potential mineral 
resource and the impact of the proposal in terms of sterilising the resource. 
2.11.6 The Project Site is also located adjacent to the south of a Hazardous Installation 
Consultation Zone and approximately 200 m to the north of a Notified High 
Pressure Mains Buffer where UDP Policy EV41 applies.  Policy EV41 states that 
Abergelli ES 2018 – CHAPTER 2: REGULATORY AND POLICY BACKGROUND 
 
Prepared for:  Abergelli Power Limited 
 
AECOM 
2-29 
 
development of land in the vicinity of existing hazardous installations will not be 
permitted if there would be a significant risk to life or health.  
2.11.7 Approximately 300 m to the east of the Project Site, and therefore not affected by 
the Project, is land identified as having known potential for “Crushed Rock” mineral 
resources, where UDP Policy R5 applies.  Policy R5 states that development 
proposals that would affect the working of known potential mineral resources will 
have to be accompanied by a full assessment of the potential mineral resource and 
the impact of the proposal in terms of sterilising the resource.

Prepared for:  Abergelli Power Limited 
 
AECOM 
2-31 
 
In addition to the site-specific policies set out above, the following UDP policies are 
also considered to be relevant. 
2.11.9 Strategic Policy SP1 states that “sustainable development will be pursued as an 
integral principle of the planning and development process.” 
2.11.10 Strategic Policy SP2 states that “the countryside will be protected and 
conserved…” 
2.11.11 Strategic Policy SP3 states that the natural, built, and cultural heritage of the 
County will be protected and enhanced to safeguard from materially harmful 
development. 
2.11.12 Strategic Policy SP11 states that “the upgrading of infrastructure provision and the 
generation of energy from renewable resources to meet the needs of existing and 
new development will be favoured, provided that environmental impact is kept to a 
minimum”. 
2.11.13 Strategic Policy SP12 states that the Council will encourage development that 
“makes efficient use of resources and energy”. 
2.11.14 Policy EV1 states that new development should accord with a number of objectives 
of “good design,” including: 
i. 
“Be appropriate to its local context in terms of scale, height, massing, 
elevational treatment, materials and detailing, layout, form, mix and density;” 
ii. 
“Integrate effectively with adjacent spaces and the public realm;” 
iii. 
“Not result in a significant detrimental impact on local amenity in terms of visual 
impact, loss of light or privacy, disturbance and traffic movements;” 
iv. 
“Incorporate a good standard of landscape design;” 
v. 
“Sensitively relate to existing development patterns and seek to protect natural 
heritage, the historic and cultural environment not only on-site, but in terms of 
potential impact on neighbouring areas of importance;” 
vi. 
“Promote resource efficient and adaptable buildings and layouts using 
sustainable design and construction techniques, including the re-use and 
recycling of construction and demolition waste on site, and energy and water 
efficiency measures;” and 
vii. 
“Provide a safe environment by addressing issues of security…”  
 
2.11.15 Policy EV2 states that new development should have regard to the physical 
character and topography of the site and its surroundings by: 
i. 
“Avoiding locations that would have a significant adverse impact on prominent 
buildings, landscapes, open spaces and the general including loss of visual 
amenity, 
ii. 
Effectively integrating with the landscape, seascape or coastline by utilising 
topography to integrate into the contours of the site and avoiding conspicuous 
locations on prominent skylines and ridges, 
iii. 
Retaining important views into and out of the site, 
Abergelli ES 2018 – CHAPTER 2: REGULATORY AND POLICY BACKGROUND

AECOM 
2-32 
 
iv. 
Taking into account and where possible retaining site features including 
existing buildings, topography, landscape, archaeological and water features, 
trees and hedgerows, and, where appropriate: 
v. 
Undertaking, at the earliest opportunity, an assessment of species and habitats 
on site and, where planning permission is granted, implementing any 
necessary mitigation measures, 
vi. 
Avoiding detrimental effects on the historic environment, 
vii. 
Locating near transport nodes to encourage an integrated transport system, 
viii. 
Not prejudicing the viability and function of any agricultural land adjoining the 
site, 
ix. 
Determining whether the proposal would be at risk from flooding, increase flood 
risk off-site, or create additional water run-off, development for infrastructure 
and services, 
x. 
Having due regard to the implications of the development for infrastructure and 
services, 
xi. 
Integrating with existing community facilities, 
xii. 
Utilising landscape and topography to maximise energy efficiency, 
xiii. 
Having full regard to existing adjacent developments and the possible impact of 
environmental pollution from those developments, as well as the creation of 
any environmental pollution to the detriment of neighbouring occupiers 
(including light, air and noise), 
xiv. 
Identifying the location of any hazardous installations in the area and 
development that would be at risk from, or prejudice the operational use of, 
hazardous installations, 
xv. 
Identifying and fully addressing issues of contamination and land instability.” 
2.11.16 Policy EV3 states that proposals for new development will be required to, inter alia, 
“provide access and facilities for all” and “contribute to a high quality public realm”. 
2.11.17 Policy EV6 states that the Council will seek to “protect, preserve and enhance” 
unscheduled archaeological site and monuments and their settings.  Where 
proposals affect sites and areas of archaeological potential, applicants are required 
to undertake an assessment of the impact of development and set out measures to 
preserve, enhance and record features of archaeological interest.   
2.11.18 Policy EV12 states that “the character of lanes and public paths that contribute to 
the amenity, natural and historic qualities of an area will be protected…In rural 
areas the design of any necessary works should be appropriate to the character of 
the area and should not detract from the landscape or suburbanise the area.” 
2.11.19 Policy EV21 states that non-residential development in the countryside will only be 
permitted where it can be demonstrated that: 
i. 
“It is beneficial for the rural economy or rural employment, or 
ii. 
It meets the overriding social or economic needs of the local community, or 
iii. 
It is an appropriate development associated with farm diversification, 
sustainable tourism and recreation, or nature conservation and does not 
adversely affect the viability of an established farm unit, or 
iv. 
It provides an acceptable economic use for previously developed land or 
existing building(s) in accordance with Policy EC12 [which concerns the 
conversion and re-use of existing rural buildings], or 
Abergelli ES 2018 – CHAPTER 2: REGULATORY AND POLICY BACKGROUND 
 
Prepared for:  Abergelli Power Limited 
 
AECOM 
2-33 
 
v. 
It is essential for communications, telecommunications, other forms of utility 
service provision, minerals or renewable energy generation.” 
2.11.20 Policy EV22 states that the countryside will be “conserved and enhanced for the 
sake of its natural heritage, natural resources, historic and cultural, environment 
and agricultural and recreational value” through the control of development and 
practical management and improvement measures. 
2.11.21 Policy EV30 states that encouragement will be given to the “protection and 
improved management of woodlands, trees and hedgerows which are important for 
their visual amenity, historic environment, natural heritage and/or recreation value.”  
Priority will be given to: “(i) protecting the remaining areas of ancient semi natural 
woodland and planted ancient woodland sites; (ii) promoting new planting with 
species appropriate to the location…; and (iii) ensuring that protection of amenity 
interests is achieved where management involves commercial felling and 
replanting.” 
2.11.22 Policy EV38 states that development proposals on land where there is a risk from 
contamination or landfill gas will not be permitted unless it can be demonstrated 
that “measures can be taken to satisfactorily overcome any danger to life, health, 
property, controlled waters, or the natural and historic environment.” 
2.11.23 Policy EV40 states that development proposals will not be permitted that would 
“cause or result in significant harm to health, local amenity, natural heritage, the 
historic environment or landscape character because of significant levels of air, 
noise or light pollution.” 
2.11.24 Policy EC1 allocates 190 ha of employment land at Felindre Strategic Business 
Park, located approximately 1.5 km to the south-west of the Project Site, in order to 
meet the growth needs of the local economy. 
2.11.25 Policy EC13 states that development that would result in the loss of the best and 
most versatile agricultural land will not normally be permitted, unless “there is an 
overriding need and:  
i. 
Previously developed land is unavailable, and either 
ii. 
Lower grade land is unavailable, or 
iii. 
Lower grade land is of a higher environmental value.” 
2.11.26 Policy HC1 allocates land at Tircoed, Penllergaer, located approximately 2.5 km to 
the south-west of the Project Site, for the delivery of 84 units. 
2.11.27 Policy R16 states that “proposals for major new developments will be required to 
incorporate adequate and effective waste management facilities.” 
2.11.28 Policy AS2 states that new developments should be designed to “allow for the safe, 
efficient and non-intrusive movement of vehicles”.  In addition, the means of access 
to new developments should be designed to ensure that impacts on the natural, 
historic and built environment and local communities are minimised.

Prepared for:  Abergelli Power Limited 
 
AECOM 
2-34 
 
2.11.29 Policy AS3 states that “development that adversely affects the safety, enjoyment 
and convenient use of a Public Right of Way (PROW) will only be permitted where 
an acceptable alternative route is identified.” 
2.11.30 Policy AS10 requires new developments to “incorporate appropriate traffic 
management measures to mitigate against significant adverse impacts that would 
otherwise be caused by traffic movements.” 
b) Other Material Considerations  
i. 
CCS Draft LDP – Overview  
2.11.31 CCS is currently in the process of preparing a new LDP (Ref 2.46), which upon 
adoption will replace the UDP as the key planning policy document for CCS up to 
2025. 
2.11.32 To date, the preparation of the LDP has been subject to the following phases of 
consultation and engagement: 
 Stage 1: Delivery Agreement (DA) – The DA sets out the timetable for 
preparation of the LDP and the Council’s Community Involvement Scheme. 
The DA was subject to consultation in April and May 2009 and was updated in 
2013. 
 Stage 2: Pre-Deposit Plan Preparation and Involvement – This stage included 
the preparation and collection of background evidence, and an invitation for the 
submission of candidate sites for assessment from 2010.  
 Stage 3: Pre-Deposit Plan Preparation and Public Consultation – A Draft LDP 
Vision and Objectives document and a Draft LDP Strategic Options document 
were subsequently subject to consultation in 2012.  Following this, the Draft 
LDP Preferred Strategy was subject to public consultation (via exhibitions, 
community information sessions, presentations and workshops) in 2013, prior 
to the publication of the final LDP Preferred Strategy in July 2014.  In 
December 2014, a draft LDP proposals map was published for consultation on 
proposed sites and boundary changes. 
 Stage 4: Deposit Plan (including consultation on a draft version of the LDP) – 
Further to preceding stages and review of consultation feedback, the Deposit 
LDP was published for consultation between July and August 2016. 
2.11.33 CCS submitted the LDP to the Ministers of the Welsh Government for independent 
examination on 28th July 2017.  Following formal acceptance on 4th August 2017, 
the Ministers of the Welsh Government have appointed Inspectors to conduct the 
independent examination and to assess the soundness of the LDP.  Examination 
hearings commenced on 6th February 2018 and ran until late March 2018. 
2.11.34 The examination hearings were scheduled on a topic basis as set out in Table 2-1:

2.11.35 Following formal closure of the examination hearings, the inspector's report will be 
prepared and submitted to the Council with recommendations regarding the LDP.  It 
is anticipated the LDP would be formally adopted by CCS thereafter subject to the 
inspector’s recommendations.   
2.11.36 Prior to the commencement of examination hearings, the submitted LDP is 
considered to hold some weight for decision-making purposes based on the 
previous stages of preparation and consultation (listed above).  At the closure of 
the examination hearings and following the publication of the inspector’s report, the 
weight to be attached to the draft LDP may change based upon the inspector’s 
recommendations.  Upon adoption, the LDP would replace the UDP and receive full 
weight for decision-making purposes. 
2.11.37 The submitted LDP, comprising the Proposals Maps and Written Statement, seeks 
to provide a planning framework that will enable the delivery of sustainable 
development in the right places across the county.

ii. CCS Draft LDP Proposals Map and site-specific policies 
2.11.38 As shown on the draft LDP Proposals Map (Figures 2-3 and 2-4), the Project Site is 
located on land identified as safeguarded ”Coal Resources” and ”Sand and Gravel” 
resource, where draft LDP Policy R12 applies. Draft Policy RP 12 states that 
“development within mineral safeguarding areas that would permanently sterilise 
identified resources of aggregates and coal will only be permitted where it can be 
demonstrated that:  
 The extraction of the mineral is impracticable, uneconomic or environmentally 
unacceptable;  
 The mineral has already been extracted or can be extracted satisfactorily prior 
to the development taking place;  
 The scale and location of the development would have no significant impact on 
the potential working of the resource; or  
 There is an overriding need for the development.” 
2.11.39 The Project Site is also located within proximity of a designated Mineral Buffer 
Zone, where draft LDP Policy RP 14 applies.  Draft Policy RP 14 states that, aside 
from mineral extraction and sensitive non-mineral development, any other 
development proposals will be “carefully assessed to ensure that there would be no 
significant adverse effect on natural heritage, the amenity and well-being of 
neighbouring properties, or the quality and quantity of controlled waters.” 
2.11.40 To the north, the Project Site is located within proximity of a Landscape Protection 
Area, where Policy ER5 applies, and a Strategic Search Area, where Policy EU1 
applies.  Draft Policy ER 5 states that “development will not be permitted that would 
have a significant adverse effect on the character and quality of the landscape and 
setting of the County”.  Within Special Landscape Areas, including the Mawr 
Uplands to the north of the Project Site, priority will be given to protecting, 
managing and enhancing the character and quality of the area. Draft Policy EU 1 
support proposals for large scale wind farms and their associated infrastructure 
within the Strategic Search Area. 
2.11.41 To the south, the Project Site is located within proximity of a Strategic Development 
Area (Policy SD 1(G)) and safeguarded land at Morriston Hospital (Policy SI 4). 
2.11.42 Draft Policy SD G seeks to allocate a new sustainable settlement at land north-west 
of M4 J46 at Llangyfelach, to the south-west of the Project Site, for “comprehensive 
mixed use development of up to 850 homes during the Plan period, incorporating a 
mix of low-medium and high density residential, a new district centre with 
commercial units, primary school, a mix of public realm, open space and play 
provision, new community buildings, and a strategic business park.” 
2.11.43 Draft Policy SI 4 safeguards land adjacent to Morriston Hospital, to the south-east 
of the Project Site, for future development, restricted to healthcare related uses 
associated with Morriston Hospital.  Proposals are required to be “delivered 
alongside appropriate new and enhanced highway infrastructure that will 
significantly improve the existing substandard road access leading to the site”.  A

new access road is proposed as part of this proposal (Strategic Transport Strategy 
Table 9.2) to resolve road capacity issues from the roundabout immediately north of 
M4 J46.

iii. CCS Draft LDP - Written Statement 
2.11.44 The LDP Written Statement sets out a vision, strategic objectives and growth 
strategy that addresses development opportunities and issues across the county.  
In addition to the site-specific policies set out above, the following draft LDP 
policies are also considered to be relevant. 
2.11.45 Draft paragraph 1.2.2 sets out the overarching vision of the LDP, that “The County 
will be a desirable place to live, work and visit that (sic): 
Abergelli ES 2018 – CHAPTER 2: REGULATORY AND POLICY BACKGROUND 
 
Prepared for:  Abergelli Power Limited 
 
AECOM 
2-38 
 
 Capitalises on the distinctive relationship between its vibrant urban areas and 
outstanding rural and coastal environments; 
 Supports a competitive and prosperous economy that acts as a focal point for 
the wider Swansea Bay City Region; 
 Has sustainable, distinct communities, in both urban and rural locations, that 
benefit from sufficient good quality accommodation, supporting infrastructure, 
community facilities and opportunities for recreation; 
 Is a thriving City Centre destination that offers excellent shopping facilities and 
supporting leisure and business opportunities, capitalising on its proximity to 
the waterfront; 
 Celebrates and conserves its unique natural heritage and cultural and historic 
environments.” 
2.11.46 The LDP vision will be delivered through a series of strategic objectives relating to 
“Enhancing Communities, Facilities & Infrastructure”, “Delivering Economic Growth 
and Prosperity”, and “Fostering a High Quality Environment”.  Of the objectives set 
out in Figure 4, those relevant to the Project are set out below: 
 Ensure that communities have a mix of uses and facilities; 
 Facilitate the provision of appropriate infrastructure to support communities 
and businesses; 
 Encourage appropriate development of low carbon and renewable energy 
resources and energy infrastructure; 
 Support the safeguarding and sustainable use of natural resources where 
appropriate; 
 Support development that positions Swansea as an economically competitive 
place and an economic driver for the City Region; 
 Facilitate growth and diversification of the local economy and an increase in 
high value, skilled employment; 
 Promote and enhance a diverse and sustainable rural economy; 
 Promote a sustainable development strategy that avoids significant adverse 
environmental impacts and respects environmental assets; 
 Maintain and enhance green infrastructure networks; 
 Support measures to minimise the causes and consequences of climate 
change; and 
 Promote good design that is locally distinct, sustainable, innovative and 
sensitive to location. 
2.11.47 Draft Policy PS 1 sets out the Plan’s sustainable development strategy which seeks 
to limit development in the countryside to exceptional circumstances. 
2.11.48 Draft Policy PS 2 requires that development enhances the quality of places and 
spaces and responds positively to local context and character.  In addition, a 
number of design principles are set out dependant on the nature, scale and siting 
of the proposal, including, inter alia: 
 “Have regard to important elements of local heritage, culture, landscape, 
townscape, views and vistas;” 
 “Integrate effectively with and enhance the County’s green infrastructure 
network;” 
 “Provide appropriate parking and circulation areas;” 
Abergelli ES 2018 – CHAPTER 2: REGULATORY AND POLICY BACKGROUND 
 
Prepared for:  Abergelli Power Limited 
 
AECOM 
2-39 
 
 “Maximise opportunities for sustainable construction, resource efficiency and 
contributions towards increased renewable or low carbon energy generation;” 
and 
 “Ensure no significant adverse impact on natural heritage and built heritage 
assets.” 
2.11.49 Draft Policy PS 4 seeks to address opportunities for the creation of up to 14,700 
additional jobs over the Plan period. 
2.11.50 In addition to the proposed sustainable settlement at Llangyfelach (Policy SD G), 
proposed development at the following Strategic Development Areas within 
proximity of the Project Site is allocated within the submitted LDP:  
 Draft Policy SD A seeks to allocate land south of Glanffrwd Road at 
Pontarddulais, to the west of the Project Site, for comprehensive, residential 
led, development of up to 720 homes, incorporating a primary school, leisure 
and recreation facilities, public open space and appropriate community 
facilities, employment and commercial uses. 
 Draft Policy SD C seeks to allocate land south of A4240, Penllergaer, to the 
south-west of the Project Site, for comprehensive, residential led, mixed use 
development of up to 750 homes during the Plan period (and up to 1,000 
homes beyond the Plan period), incorporating primary school, leisure and 
recreation facilities, public realm, public open space and appropriate 
community and commercial uses. 
 Draft Policy SD E seeks to allocate land north of Clasemont Road, Morriston, 
to the south of the Project Site, for comprehensive, residential led, mixed use 
development of up to 675 homes during the Plan period, incorporating primary 
school, leisure and recreation facilities, public realm, public open space and 
appropriate community and commercial uses. 
2.11.51 The following draft LDP policies seek to allocate major residential-led development 
at sites within proximity of the Project Site: 
 LDP Policy H1.11 – 60 dwellings at Land at Ramsey Road, Clydach; 
 
 LDP Policy H1.21 – 90 dwellings at Land east of Pontarddulais Road, 
Gorseinon; 
 
 LDP Policy H1.26 – 100 dwellings at Land at Carmel Road and Bryntirion 
Road, Pontlliw; 
 LDP Policy H1.30 – 50 dwellings at Land north of Llewellyn Road, 
Penllergaer; and 
 
 LDP Policy H1.31 – 50 dwellings at Land at Bolgoed Road, Pontarddulais.  
2.11.52 Draft Policy IO 1 states that “development must be supported by appropriate 
infrastructure, facilities and other requirements considered necessary as part of the 
proposal,” which must be provided in a timely and coordinated manner.  Where 
necessary, “planning obligations will be sought to ensure that the effects of 
developments are fully addressed in order to make the development acceptable.”  
2.11.53 Draft Policy IO 2 requires developers to “maximise added benefits from the 
development in relation to the creation of training and job opportunities.” 
Abergelli ES 2018 – CHAPTER 2: REGULATORY AND POLICY BACKGROUND 
 
Prepared for:  Abergelli Power Limited 
 
AECOM 
2-40 
 
2.11.54 Draft Policy HC 1 seeks to preserve or enhance the County’s distinctive historic 
and cultural environment by requiring high quality design standards.  Similarly, draft 
Policy HC 2 seeks to preserve or enhance the County’s buildings and features of 
historic importance. 
2.11.55 Draft Policy SI 1 states that health inequalities will be reduced and healthy lifestyles 
encouraged by ensuring that development proposals, inter alia, “do not result in 
significant risks to life, human health or well-being, particularly in respect of air, 
noise, light, water or land pollution.” 
2.11.56 Draft Policy SI 8 states that development must be designed to promote safe and 
secure communities and minimise the opportunity for crime. 
2.11.57 Draft Policy ER 1 requires that development proposals take into account the 
following principles to mitigate against the effects of climate change, adapt to its 
impacts, and to ensure resilience: 
i. 
Reduce carbon emissions; 
ii. 
Protect and increase carbon sinks; 
iii. 
Adapt to the implications of climate change at both a strategic and detailed 
design level; 
iv. 
Promote energy and resource efficiency and increase the supply of renewable 
and low carbon energy; 
v. 
Avoid unnecessary flood risk by assessing the implications of development 
proposals within areas susceptible to flooding and preventing development 
that unacceptably increases risk, and 
vi. 
Maintain ecological resilience. 
2.11.58 Draft Policy ER 2 requires that development to maintain or enhance the County’s 
multi-functional green infrastructure network. 
2.11.59 Draft Policy ER 6 states that “development will not be permitted that would result in 
a likely significant adverse effect to sites of international or national nature 
conservation importance”.  In addition, “development that would affect locally 
designated sites of nature conservation importance should maintain or enhance the 
nature conservation interest of the site.” 
2.11.60 Draft ER 8 states that development proposals that would have a significant adverse 
effect on the continued viability of habitats and species will only be permitted 
where: 
i. 
“The need for development outweighs the nature conservation importance of 
the site”; 
ii. 
The developer demonstrates that there is no satisfactory alternative location 
for the development which avoids nature conservation impacts; 
iii. 
Effective mitigation measures are provided by the developer; and 
iv. 
Any unavoidable harm is minimised by effective mitigation to ensure that there 
is no reduction in the overall nature conservation value of the area.”  
2.11.61 Draft Policy ER 9 states that development proposals “will be expected to maintain, 
protect and enhance ecological networks and features of importance for 
Abergelli ES 2018 – CHAPTER 2: REGULATORY AND POLICY BACKGROUND 
 
Prepared for:  Abergelli Power Limited 
 
AECOM 
2-41 
 
biodiversity…Development proposals that could result in a significant adverse 
effect on the connectivity of ecological networks and features of importance for 
biodiversity will only be permitted where: 
i. 
The need for the development outweighs the nature conservation value of the 
site; 
ii. 
It can be demonstrated that there is no satisfactory alternative location for the 
development; 
iii. 
A connected element of the natural resource is retained as part of the design 
of the development; and 
iv. 
Compensatory provision will be made of comparable ecological value to that 
lost as a result of the development.” 
2.11.62 Draft Policy ER 10 states that development will not be permitted that would cause 
significant adverse effect to geological or geomorphological Sites of Special 
Scientific Interest (SSSIs).  Development that would affect regionally important 
geological or geomorphological sites (RIGs) should maintain the geological or 
geomorphological interests of the site. 
2.11.63 Draft Policy ER 11 states that “development that would adversely affect trees, 
woodlands and hedgerows of public amenity, natural/cultural heritage value, or that 
provide important ecosystem services will not normally be permitted.” 
2.11.64 Draft Policy CV 2 sets a presumption against development in the countryside, 
except where it is for, inter alia, “necessary infrastructure provision”.  Development 
in the countryside is required to ensure that the integrity of the countryside is 
conserved and enhanced. 
2.11.65 Draft Policy T 1 requires that “development must be supported by appropriate 
transport measures and infrastructure”.  Development that would have an 
unacceptable impact on the safe and efficient operation of the transport network will 
not be permitted. 
2.11.66 Draft Policy T 5 sets out a series of design principles for transport infrastructure, 
including ensuring that the design of development, inter alia: 
 
“Allows for the safe, efficient and effective movement of vehicles, inclusive of 
service vehicles;” 
 
“Does not give rise to any significant adverse effect on the natural heritage, 
and the historic and cultural environment is preserved and enhanced;” and 
 
“Maintains the character of rural lanes and public paths;” 
2.11.67 Draft Policy T 7 requires that acceptable alternative routes are identified and 
provided where development “significantly adversely affects the character, safety, 
enjoyment and convenient use of a Public Right of Way (PROW).” 
2.11.68 In addition to supporting large scale wind farm developments within the Strategic 
Search Area (referenced above), draft Policy EU 1 supports proposals for 
renewable or low carbon energy development across CCS, subject to the following 
criteria: 
Abergelli ES 2018 – CHAPTER 2: REGULATORY AND POLICY BACKGROUND 
 
Prepared for:  Abergelli Power Limited 
 
AECOM 
2-42 
 
a) “The siting, design, layout, type of installation and materials used do not have 
a significant adverse effect on the characteristics and features of the 
proposed location; 
b) The development would not result in unacceptable loss of public amenity or 
public accessibility to the area; 
c) The development would not result in significant adverse effects on natural 
heritage or historic environment, or visual amenity either individually or 
cumulatively; 
d) There would be no significant adverse effect on the Gower AONB; 
e) There would be no significant adverse impact on water quality and quantity; 
f) The development would not result in the permanent sterilisation of minerals 
resources; 
g) The development would not compromise the transport network; 
h) The 
development 
would 
not 
interfere 
with 
aircraft 
operations 
or 
telecommunications; 
i) There would be no loss of carbon sinks, or that on-site loss can be adequately 
mitigated; and 
j) The satisfactory removal of infrastructure and remediation and/or restoration 
of the natural environment, would be undertaken in accordance with an 
aftercare scheme to be agreed with the Council prior to the development 
being carried out.” 
2.11.69 Draft Policy RP 1 seeks to prevent development that would result in a “significant 
risk to: life; human health and well-being; property; controlled waters; or the natural 
and historic environment,” particularly in respect of: “air, noise or light pollution; 
flood risk; water resources; land contamination; land instability or subsidence; 
mineral resources; and sustainable waste management.” 
2.11.70 Draft Policy RP 2 requires that, “where development could lead to exposure to a 
source of air, noise or light pollution, it must be demonstrated that appropriate 
mitigation measures will be implemented and incorporated into the design of the 
development.” 
2.11.71 Draft Policy RP 3 states that “development that compromises the quality of the 
water environment, or does not comply with good water resource management, will 
not be permitted.  Development proposals must make efficient use of water 
resources and, where appropriate, contribute towards improvements to water 
quality.” 
2.11.72 Draft Policy RP 4 states that development will not be permitted in areas at risk of 
flooding, unless it can be demonstrated that “the development can be justified in 
line with national guidance and is supported by a technical assessment that verifies 
that the new development is designed to alleviate the threat and consequences of 
flooding”. 
2.11.73 Draft Policy RP 5 states that “development proposals on land where there is a risk 
from contamination or landfill gas will not be permitted unless it can be 
demonstrated that measures can be taken to satisfactorily overcome any significant 
risk to life, human health, property, controlled waters, or the natural and historic 
environment.” 
Abergelli ES 2018 – CHAPTER 2: REGULATORY AND POLICY BACKGROUND 
 
Prepared for:  Abergelli Power Limited 
 
AECOM 
2-43 
 
2.11.74 Draft Policy RP 6 states that “development which would create, affect or might be 
affected by unstable or potentially unstable land will not be permitted where there 
would be a significant direct risk to life, human health, property, buildings and 
structures, or the natural heritage on the site or in its vicinity.” 
2.11.75 Draft Policy RP 7 supports the development of sustainable waste management 
facilities in appropriate rural locations. Supporting paragraph 2.14.48 notes that 
preferred areas for new waste management facilities include the former Tip site at 
Felindre, within proximity of the Project Site.  The site at Felindre is identified 
specifically for the potential to accommodate a Combined Heat and Power (CHP) 
Facility which could provide heat or power for adjacent proposed developments.   
2.11.76 Draft Policy RP 9 requires development to incorporate, as appropriate, “adequate 
and effective provision for the storage, recycling and other sustainable 
management of waste, and allow for appropriate access arrangements for recycling 
and refuse collection vehicles and personnel.” 
iv. CCS Supplementary Planning Guidance 
2.11.77 CCS has produced Supplementary Planning Guidance (SPG) to support the 
implementation of adopted UDP planning policies. 
2.11.78 The Planning Obligations SPG (Ref. 2.47), published by CCS in March 2010, is an 
SPG document of potential relevance to the Project.  The Planning Obligations 
SPG identifies the types of obligations developers may be expected to contribute 
towards, the likely amounts of these obligations, and the procedures involved when 
entering into obligations. 
v. Swansea Environment Strategy 2006 and Ten Year Progress Review (2016) 
2.11.79 The Swansea Environment Strategy (SES) (Ref. 2.48), published by Swansea 
Environmental Forum (SEF) in 2006, provides a long-term vision and strategic 
priorities for the natural and built environment in Swansea.  
2.11.80 SEF is the lead strategic partnership for all aspects of the natural and built 
environment in the City and County of Swansea. It is an independent membership 
organisation, initially set-up in 1985, which brings together individuals, statutory 
bodies, businesses and voluntary groups to promote environmental sustainability 
and develop collaborative projects to improve our natural and urban environments. 
2.11.81 The SES establishes a 2020 vision and a series of priorities for: the natural 
environment and biodiversity; the built environment and energy use; water, land 
and waste management; sustainable transport and air quality; and environmental 
awareness and action.

Theme  
2020 Vision 
The Natural 
Environment and 
Biodiversity 
Swansea’s unique and diverse natural environment will be protected, 
enhanced and promoted to maximise social, economic and 
environmental well-being. 
The Built 
Environment and 
Energy Use  
Swansea will have strong, sustainable and distinctive communities 
where everyone can enjoy a clean, safe and high-quality built 
environment 
with 
affordable 
housing, 
public 
spaces 
and 
considerately-designed and resource-efficient buildings. 
Water, Land and 
Waste Management
 
 
Swansea’s water resources, land and waste will be managed 
sustainably to maximise benefits for everyone and minimise risks to 
the environment and human health. 
Sustainable 
Transport and Air 
Quality 
Swansea’s citizens will live near to work opportunities, leisure 
facilities and essential services, have access to a choice of 
convenient and efficient transport options, and enjoy clean air. 
Environmental 
Awareness and 
Action 
All people living in, working in and visiting Swansea will understand, 
respect and appreciate our environment and will participate in 
positive actions towards sustainability. 
2.11.82 The Ten Year Progress Review (Ref. 2.49) demonstrates that progress has been 
made under each of the Environment Strategy’s five themes, most significantly in 
waste management, sustainable building and energy use, managing flood risk, and 
community engagement. 
vi. Swansea Local Biodiversity Strategy and Action Plan 
2.11.83 The Swansea Biodiversity Partnership produced the Swansea Local Biodiversity 
Strategy and Action Plan (Ref. 2.50) in 2005.  The document provides a strategic 
framework and series of detailed species and habitat action plans looking at how 
individuals and organisations could work to try and halt biodiversity loss in 
Swansea. 
2.11.84 The document was prepared with the following aim: “To conserve, enhance and 
promote the special qualities of Swansea’s unique and ecologically diverse natural 
environment, and to maximise the contribution it makes to the social, economic and 
environmental wellbeing of the area” (page 5).

3.2 
Changes since the 2014 PEIR  
3.2.1 
Since the 2014 Preliminary Environmental Information Report (PEIR) there have 
been changes to the Project either as a result of the Project evolution and / or due 
to an update in environmental baseline information. In response to further surveys, 
ongoing at the time of Phase 2 statutory consultation on the 2018 PEIR, and as a 
result of the responses received on the 2018 PEIR, subtle design changes to the 
Project were made. Table 3-2 provides a summary of these changes to the Project 
since the 2014 PEIR and the 2018 PEIR.  
3.2.2 
Further detailed information on the design changes to the Project and why they 
have been made is included in Chapter 5: Alternatives Considered.  
Table 3-2: Summary of Changes since the 2014 PEIR  
Project Component 
Changes in design since the 2014 PEIR  
Power Generation Plant  The Power Generation Plant is now made up of only one Gas 
Turbine Generator with one exhaust gas flue stack, rather 
than up to five.  
 The stack height is now a maximum of 45 m, instead of 40 m.  
 The Generating Equipment Site has now been moved north 
of the Welsh Water Main (Water Main).  
 Selection of an access route from the B4489 to the west of 
the Generating Equipment instead of the alternative 
construction access route from the north; and  
 Two onsite options for the new section of the Access Road 
(Option A and Option B) as shown on Figure 3.3. 
Electrical Connection 
The Electrical Connection now runs alongside the road rather 
than under for ease of maintenance. 
Project Component 
Changes in design since the 2018 PEIR 
Access Road 
 Option B for the new section of the Access Road has been 
chosen to take forward for the Application. This route has 
also been updated from the route presented in the 2018 PEIR 
to avoid ancient woodland. See Figure 3.3. 
3.3 
Project Site and Surroundings  
 The Project Site 
a)
3.3.1 
The Project Site (see Figure 1.1) is located on open agricultural land approximately 
2 km north of Junction  46 on the M4, approximately 3 km to the north of the city of 
Swansea, approximately 1 km southeast of Felindre and 1.4 km north of 
Llangyfelach. The current land use is predominantly agricultural, with sheep and 
horse grazing. The western extent of the Project Site encompasses parts of the 
Substation (comprising a 400 kV and 132 kV substation) and the existing access 
road leading to the Substation and Felindre Gas Compressor Station from the 
B4489. 
Abergelli ES 2018 – CHAPTER 3: PROJECT AND SITE DESCRIPTION 
 
Prepared for:  Abergelli Power Limited   
 
AECOM 
3-5 
 
3.3.2 
The Power Generation Plant is accessed from Junction 46 of the M4 (see Figure 
12.1). From the M4 vehicles would travel north via the B4489, then head east  
utilising the existing access road from the B4489, followed by a newly constructed 
section of road leading south from the Felindre Gas Compressor Station, then 
crossing east over agricultural land to reach the Generating Equipment Site. 
3.3.3 
Ground levels at the Project Site vary from approximately 146 m above ordnance 
datum (AOD) at the highest point in the north-west corner at Rhyd-y-pandy Road to 
approximately 80 m AOD along the southern perimeter, with ground levels 
generally falling in a southerly and south easterly direction. The land within the 
Generating Equipment Site is at approximately 90 m AOD (see site levels on Figure 
3.1). 
3.3.4 
There are no residential dwellings located within the Project Site Boundary. Most of 
the Project Site is improved grassland but there are areas of marshy grassland in 
the south eastern part of the Generating Equipment Site. There are parts of a Site 
of Importance for Nature Conservation (SINC) within the Project Site (Lletty-Morfil 
SINC). A block of broadleaved woodland, classified as Ancient Woodland, and a 
SINC lie to the east. There are also further blocks of Ancient Woodland, also 
classified as SINCs, to the west surrounding the Substation, Felindre Gas 
Compressor Station, and the existing access road leading to these facilities from 
the B4489.  
3.3.5 
Within the Project Site there are springs, with their associated streams and 
drainage ditches which discharge into the Afon Llan (see Figure 3.1). The Afon Llan 
links with the Afon Lliw and the River Loughor, which discharges into the Bristol 
Channel. There are no Main Rivers within the Project Site. 
3.3.6 
The Generating Equipment Site is located primarily within fields used for grazing, 
bounded by a mixture of drainage ditches, fencing and poor quality hedgerows with 
substantial gaps in them. The Generating Equipment Site and Laydown Area are 
both crossed by a soft surface horse training track known as ‘the gallops’ (Figure 
1.2), which runs diagonally north-west to south-east.  
 The Surrounding Area 
b)
3.3.7 
The area surrounding the Project Site is, at present, predominantly rural in 
character, although there is the Felindre Park and Share facility to the south and a 
substantial amount of utility infrastructure in the area, some of which cross the 
Project Site (see Figure 3.5). Please refer to Table 4-6 which describes future 
development in the vicinity.  
3.3.8 
The National Gas Transmission System (see Figure 5.2), a Water Main and an Oil 
Pipeline (see Figure 3.5) cross the Project Site and there is also a network of 
electricity pylons, underground utilities and overhead lines which lead to and from 
the Substation (see Figure 3.5). The Felindre Water Treatment Works is located to 
the northwest, while the Cefn Betingau Solar Park and Abergelli Solar Farm are 
located to the east of Project Site. A further two solar parks are built in the vicinity, 
Rhyd-y-pandy solar park and Abergelli Farm. All of these features have been 
Abergelli ES 2018 – CHAPTER 3: PROJECT AND SITE DESCRIPTION

considered in the design of the Project to ensure that they are safeguarded either 
through avoidance or minimal interaction. 
3.3.9 
Other features of the area include public footpaths, bridleways and tracks located in 
and around the Project Site (see Figure 3.3), linking it to the wider area. 
3.3.10 The closest residential dwellings to the Generating Equipment Site (Figure 1.1) are:  
 
Abergelli Farmhouse approximately 620 m to the north of the Generating 
Equipment Site; 
 
Llwynhelig approximately 590 m to the south east of the Generating Equipment 
Site; 
 
Felin Wen Farm approximately 830 m to the east of the Generating Equipment 
Site; 
 
Lletty Morfil Farm approximately 740 m to the west of the Generating 
Equipment Site; 
 
Cefn betingau approximately 650 m to the north east of the Generating 
Equipment Site; and 
 
Maes-eglwys approximately 440 m to the south of the Generating Equipment 
Site.  
3.3.11 The remains of Abergelli Colliery are located north of Abergelli Farmhouse. 
3.4 
Development Parameters and the ‘Rochdale Envelope’ 
3.4.1 
As a series of parameters have been built into the design of the Project, this ES 
has been prepared with reference to PINS Advice Note 9 (AN9) – ‘Using the 
Rochdale Envelope’. AN9 states that PINS understands that ‘…the ‘Rochdale 
Envelope’ is an acknowledged way of dealing with an application comprising EIA 
development where details of a project have not been resolved at the time when 
the application is submitted’. 
3.4.2 
In the case of this Project, it is considered that the DCO Application would be 
flexible enough using the Rochdale Envelope approach to allow APL to construct 
and operate an electricity generating plant of up to 299 MW by building one Gas 
Turbine Generator with its own dedicated flue stack, which could be procured from 
a range of suppliers. 
3.4.3 
It is made clear in AN9 that an EIA must ‘...ensure that all the realistic and likely 
worst case variations of the project have been properly considered and clearly set 
out in the ES and as such that the likely significant impacts have been adequately 
assessed’. 
3.4.4 
To this end, where flexibility in parameters for the Project (such as the height of the 
stack) has been provided, APL has assessed the realistic worst case and it is made 
clear in each ‘topic’ assessment what this constitutes.

 Overview 
a)
3.4.5 
The maximum area for the Generating Equipment Site would be approximately 
2.64 ha. Figure 3.2 shows an indicative illustration of the position and layout of the 
Generating Equipment with the Electrical Connection. The design would be 
finalised in the event that a DCO is made by the SoS and the Gas Turbine 
Generator has been procured. The requirements of the DCO (similar to planning 
conditions) would control the detail of the final design and would require approval 
by the relevant planning authority at that time. In addition, embedded mitigation is 
inherent to the design with additional mitigation secured as required. APL is 
therefore proposing to submit its application on the basis of a series of parameters 
for the Project which allows an assessment of the realistic worst case in 
accordance with the ‘Rochdale Envelope’ approach. Working areas are allocated 
as per the Works Plans (Document reference 2.3).  
3.4.6 
The nature and purpose of peaking plants such as that which is proposed for the 
Project is set out in paragraph 3.4.7 and the reason for selecting OCGT plant as 
the most appropriate technology choice is further described in Chapter 5: 
Alternatives Considered. The paragraphs below therefore describe the operation 
of OCGT plants in more detail.  
 Open Cycle Gas Turbine (OCGT) 
b)
3.4.7 
An ‘industrial’ type gas turbine would be used for the Project. This type of turbine 
has been selected as it is suited to generating up to 299 MW using only one unit, 
thereby reducing potential effects of noise, air quality and visual impacts. 
Additionally, they are suitable for frequent and fast start-ups, flexibility, and high-
availability maintenance techniques.   
3.4.8 
The main equipment in an OCGT is a Gas Turbine Generator, including the 
following components: 
 
Air inlet filter house; 
 
Air inlet duct; 
 
Exhaust diffuser; and 
 
Auxiliaries, including: 
o Lube oil system; 
o Air dryers; 
o Fuel gas filter package; 
o Instrument air system; 
o Compressor washing; and 
o A stack with an exhaust silencer would also be part of the OCGT.  
3.4.9 
On entering the gas turbine, air would be compressed and natural gas injected into 
the air. The air and natural gas mixture would then burn in the combustion chamber 
producing hot, high pressure gases. The gas would then expand across the blades 
of the gas turbine driving the compressor and the electrical generator to produce 
electricity.

AECOM 
3-8 
 
3.4.10 The waste gases and heat produced from this process would be released into the 
atmosphere via the stack. The stack would contain equipment which would reduce 
emissions released to the atmosphere, including a silencer. 
3.4.11 Further information on why the exhaust gases are emitted to the atmosphere and 
cannot be recovered is given in Chapter 5: Alternatives Considered and in a 
separate Combined Heat and Power (CHP) statement (Appendix 5.1).  
3.4.12 An initial stack height sensitivity study has been undertaken for the Project to 
determine the minimum stack height for the Gas Turbine Generator required for 
adequate dispersion of emissions to meet legislative air quality targets. The 
findings of this initial study setting out the height parameters are in Table 3-3. 
3.4.13 Stack emissions would be continuously recorded to ensure correct and efficient 
operation of the Generating Equipment. Any significant deviations to emission limit 
values specified in the Environmental Permit required for the Project would be 
alarmed and corrections carried out on occurrence. Records of performance and 
deviation would be maintained. Full facilities for interfacing information, control and 
alarm systems would be installed so that the Generating Equipment can be 
operated from a central control room via a distributed control system (DCS). In the 
event of a fault in the Gas Turbine Generator or other major plant items, the 
Generating Equipment would shut down automatically in a controlled manner. 
3.4.14 Processed natural gas sourced from the National Gas Transmission System is a 
clean burning fuel and does not produce the levels of particulate or sulphur 
emissions associated with burning coal. Further discussion of emissions 
characteristics from the Generating Equipment is provided in Chapter 6: Air 
Quality, which sets out the findings of the air quality assessment. 
3.4.15 The Power Generation Plant consists of one Gas Turbine Generator and its 
associated single stack arrangement. Figure 3-1 shows a simple schematic of an 
OCGT operation.

 Other Generating Equipment Plant Items 
c)
3.4.16 In addition to the Gas Turbine Generator at the Generating Equipment Site, the 
following plant and buildings would also be present: 
 
Raw / Fire Water Tank: The fire water storage tank would be designed to 
comply with the relevant fire regulations and would be installed together with 
fire pumps, hose reels, fire hydrants and portable extinguishers; 
 
Demineralised Water Tank: Required to store demineralised water for the 
Generating Equipment (used for e.g. blade washing); 
 
Control Room / office / workshop Building: Required in order to monitor the 
plant operation and house plant controls; 
 
Gatehouse: Needed to provide security and maintain a log of site attendance, 
deliveries etc.; 
 
Transformer Compound: Required to connect the electrical infrastructure from 
the Generating Equipment to transformers before export to the Substation 
which is part of the NETS.  This would also include a generator step-up 
transformer, unit and other transformers, an overhead line gantry and 
associated equipment; 
 
Natural Gas Receiving Station: Required to ensure that gas coming from the 
National Gas Transmission System feeds into the Generating Equipment Site 
at the right flow and pressure conditions. This would include a compression 
station, emergency generator, Joule-Thompson boilers and auxiliary control 
cabinets;  
 
Fin-Fan Coolers to provide cooling to the Generating Equipment; 
 
Telemetry apparatus including electrical cabinets; and

AECOM 
3-10 
 
 
Emergency Generator: A small diesel fired generator to provide power for the 
safe shutdown of the Gas Turbine Generator and running of essential security 
systems in emergency situations. 
3.4.17 Table 3-3 provides indicative maximum and minimum dimensions for the main plant 
items which will be present at the Generating Equipment Site and the EIA has been 
prepared using these parameters following a ‘Rochdale Envelope’ approach, as 
described at the start of this section. The ground level at the Generating Equipment 
Site will be approximately 90 m AOD and the heights in the Table 3-3 are measured 
from this level.

3.4.19 An Access Road to the Generating Equipment Site from the B4489 will be formed 
by upgrading an existing access road between the B4489 junction and the 
Substation and constructing a new section of road from the Substation to the 
Generating Equipment Site. 
3.4.20 The existing access road between the B4489 junction and the Substation will be 
used. Two trees currently sited at the northern edge of the road will need to be 
removed to facilitate the passing of abnormal load(s). APL has consulted with 
National Grid on these changes and the use of the existing access road has been 
agreed as presented in the Outline Construction Traffic Management Plan (CTMP) 
(Appendix 3.3a). A Construction Staff Travel Plan (CSTP) has also been developed 
and presented in Appendix 3.3b. 
3.4.21 Option B, slightly revised from its presentation in the 2018 PEIR, has been selected 
for the Project. The final route begins before the Substation and extends south 
before running east towards the Generating Equipment Site. The route of Option B 
has been amended to avoid an area of ancient woodland. This would also avoid an 
element of cut and fill, although some excavation is still likely.  
3.4.22 The existing National Grid car park as located in Figure 3.2 is unaffected by the 
route of the Access Road but may be used as initial temporary laydown whilst the 
construction of the new section of road commences.   
3.4.23 Construction traffic associated with the AGI will follow the same routeing 
arrangements, but will continue north along the B4489 and then east along Rhyd-y-
Pandy Road. This is considered the optimum route to the AGI Access both in terms 
of distance and minimising disruption to local communities. These routeing 
arrangements form part of the Outline CTMP (Appendix 3.3a).

 Laydown Area 
e)
3.4.24 A temporary Laydown Area during construction will be provided for the storage of 
materials, plant and equipment as well as containing site accommodation and 
welfare facilities, temporary car parking and temporary fencing. The Laydown Area 
will be provided adjacent to the Generating Equipment Site as shown in Figure 3.2. 
A small permanent area within the Laydown Area is required for maintenance 
during the operational phase of the Project. 
 
Car Parking 
f)
3.4.25 During construction adequate car parking would be provided within the Laydown 
Area. During operation car parking for operational and maintenance staff would be 
provided within the Generating Equipment Site. The Project will take into account 
CCS’s policy on parking standards during the operational phase of the Project and 
implement sustainable transport methods where possible.  
 Ecological Mitigation Area 
g)
3.4.26 An area has been allocated within the Project Site Boundary as mitigation for any 
habitat loss from permanent land take resulting from the construction and operation 
of the Project. This Ecological Mitigation Area is commensurate with the extent of 
mitigation required and the Landscape and Ecology Mitigation Strategy (Appendix 
3.4) outlines the methods to be employed in enhancing its natural capital. The 
Landscape and Ecology Mitigation Plan illustrates the mitigation proposed 
(Appendix 3.5). 
3.4.27 The Landscape and Ecology Mitigation Strategy (Appendix 3.4) also outlines how 
the temporary areas used for construction will be reinstated to enhance biodiversity, 
including the reinstatement of hedgerows.  
 Lighting and Security Fencing 
h)
3.4.28 Lighting columns would be erected around the perimeter of the Generating 
Equipment in order to provide security lighting and lighting for safe working in dark 
conditions. The lighting columns would be approximately 8 m in height and 
regularly spaced around the perimeter of the Generating Equipment Site. This is 
outlined in the Lighting Strategy (Appendix 3.5). 
 
Carbon Capture Readiness (CCR) and Carbon Capture and Storage  
i)
3.4.29 On the basis that the Project's maximum rated electrical output would be 299 MW, 
the Project would be below the threshold set out in Directive 2009/31/EC29 on the 
geological storage of carbon dioxide and NPS EN-1 and EN-2 for when operators 
of combustion plants are required to have assessed the feasibility of: a storage site, 
transport facilities and economic considerations of the capture of carbon dioxide 
(CO2) (e.g. CCR for Carbon Capture and Storage) produced as a result of the 
combustion process. Therefore, it is not considered necessary to assess the 
viability of CO2 capture or include it further in this ES. 
Abergelli ES 2018 – CHAPTER 3: PROJECT AND SITE DESCRIPTION 
 
Prepared for:  Abergelli Power Limited   
 
AECOM 
3-13 
 
3.4.30 It is noted that the Project consented by the DCO must have a “rated electrical 
output” of, or less than, 299 MWe and that APL intends to procure a generating 
station with a rated electrical output of no more than 299 MWe measured at the 
terminals of the Generating Equipment.  
3.4.31 APL will be required to demonstrate that it would not be possible for the operating 
plant to exceed 299 MWe, in order to comply with the IED that requires all new 
combustion plants with a rated electrical output of 300 MW or more to have met a 
number of conditions and ensured space is available for carbon capture and 
storage. 
 
Drainage 
j)
3.4.32 The Project will require a site foul water drainage system, and an oily water 
drainage system. A surface water drainage system will also be required to 
adequately drain the site and prevent ponding.  
3.4.33 To prevent inundation of the Project Site from surface runoff, cut off drainage 
ditches will be placed around the uphill site perimeter. Further details can be found 
in Section 3.11 and Chapter 9: Water Quality and Resources. 
3.5 
Description of Gas Connection 
3.5.1 
The Gas Connection would comprise all the necessary elements to enable gas to 
be imported to the Generating Equipment at a suitable rate and pressure to 
produce up to 299 MW, including a Gas Pipeline and AGI.  
3.5.2 
The Gas Connection will be in the form of a new AGI and underground Gas 
Pipeline, which is required in order to connect the Generating Equipment to the 
existing National Gas Transmission System so as to provide a reliable supply of 
fuel. 
3.5.3 
Connection of the Gas Pipeline to the National Gas Transmission System will 
require an AGI to be installed which will comprise: a Minimum Offtake Connection 
(MOC) facility, which will be owned by National Grid; and a Pipeline Inspection 
Gauge (PIG) Trap Facility (PTF) which will be owned by APL. 
3.5.4 
Termination of the Gas Connection will be at a second PTF located on the 
Generating Equipment Site. A further facility known as the Gas Receiving Station 
(GRS) will be situated downstream of the PTF within the Generating Equipment 
Site.  
3.5.5 
The AGI (both the MOC and PTF) will be located at the northern end of the Project 
Site, on the southern side of the Rhyd-y-pandy Road leading to Felindre. Once 
complete, maintenance access for the AGI will be from the Rhyd-y-pandy Road via 
a short, purpose built tarmacadam access track. The AGI will be unlit unless during 
routine and emergency maintenance.  
3.5.6 
The Gas Connection will then follow a route corridor shown on Figure 3.2 running in 
southerly direction to the Generating Equipment Site. It will be approximately 1.4 
Abergelli ES 2018 – CHAPTER 3: PROJECT AND SITE DESCRIPTION 
 
Prepared for:  Abergelli Power Limited   
 
AECOM 
3-14 
 
km in length. It will cross the National Gas Transmission System in two locations, a 
Public Right of Way (LC35B) in one location, two private farm tracks (see Figure 
3.4) and one ditch (field drain). 
3.6 
Description of Electrical Connection 
3.6.1 
The Electrical Connection will comprise all the necessary elements to enable power 
to be exported from the Generating Equipment to the NETS. The connection will be 
approximately 900 m in length. It will consist of a 400kV underground cable to the 
Substation and associated works inside the Substation to connect to a gas-
insulated switchgear (GIS) bay. The GIS Bay will be owned, maintained and 
operated by National Grid. APL will own, maintain and operate the electrical cable 
up to and including the Cable Sealing End. . 
3.6.2 
The Electrical Connection route (see Figure 3.2) leaves the Generating Equipment 
Site passing through open land to the east and south-east of the National Grid Gas 
Transmission System. The route crosses into National Grid’s land to the east of 
tower 4YW251 heading towards the Substation. Once within National Grid’s land 
the Electrical Connection turns to the north-west to run outside the Substation and 
parallel with the Substation fence line. The Electrical Connection then turns into the 
Substation close to the northern corner.  
3.6.3 
The route passes twice under one 400 kV overhead lattice tower mounted 
transmission line and once under one wooden pole mounted 11 kV overhead 
distribution line. The route crosses two ditches and a Local Transmission System 
pipeline within the field to the east of tower 4YW251. 
3.6.4 
The Electrical Connection route coincides with the alignment of the new section of 
Access Road for approximately 500 m of the route length before it turns north 
towards the Substation. 
3.6.5 
The Electrical Connection will be drilled (for example using drilling techniques such 
as Horizontal Directional Drill (HDD)) under the Water Main and Oil Pipeline with at 
least 2 m clearance from the underside of the Water Main. Though the route 
corridor of the Water Main is defined, the depth and exact location is unknown and 
is currently under investigation. Further consultation with Welsh Water will be 
undertaken as those investigations continue.   
3.7 
Construction and Site Preparation 
 Overview 
a)
3.7.1 
Construction and commissioning of the Project would take approximately 22 
months with an anticipated starting date in 2020. Typical construction activities and 
construction assumptions are described in this section and have been used in 
undertaking the assessment. 
Abergelli ES 2018 – CHAPTER 3: PROJECT AND SITE DESCRIPTION 
 
Prepared for:  Abergelli Power Limited   
 
AECOM 
3-15 
 
3.7.2 
The main works associated with the construction phase will be excavation and site 
levelling for new foundations, piling (if required) and the laying of the Gas and 
Electrical Connections, as well as erection of the Generating Equipment.  
 Commencement and Site Preparation 
b)
3.7.3 
Once a DCO has been granted and the relevant pre-commencement Requirements 
discharged, work can start on the Project Site.  It may be necessary to undertake 
preliminary enabling works prior to discharge of the DCO requirements, these 
works would be undertaken as per the definitions of “commence” and “permitted 
preliminary works” described within the Schedule 2 of the DCO). This would include 
treatment of invasive species, assessment of ground conditions and erection of 
temporary means of enclosure, site notices and receipt of construction equipment.  
3.7.4 
Relevant authorisations under the TCPA for the Gas Connection and Electrical 
Connection will also be required, along with discharge of any pre-commencement 
conditions attached to planning permissions. 
3.7.5 
An Outline Construction Environmental Management Plan (see Outline CEMP in 
Appendix 3.1) will be developed and contain the relevant topic specific 
management plans on health and safety and environmental management. 
3.7.6 
The Project Site will be surveyed to mark out with pegs the boundaries and key 
features and to fix the equipment centrelines according to approved planning and 
engineering drawings. 
3.7.7 
The Access Road will cross over the Water Main and National Gas Transmission 
System (see Figure 3.5). There will be temporary bridges over the Water Main and 
National Gas Transmission System during construction, most likely temporary 
bailey bridges or similar. Method statements for working in proximity to the Water 
Main, Oil Pipeline and National Gas Transmission System will be agreed. 
3.7.8 
Water courses and ditches will be diverted around the Generating Equipment Site 
in line with the Landscape and Ecology Mitigation Strategy (Appendix 3.4). These 
diversions will be undertaken using silt traps, straw bale filters / sedimats and an 
attenuation pond formed for any surface water outlet from the Generating 
Equipment Site. Water from the attenuation pond will be discharged in a controlled 
manner to the Afon Llan. 
3.7.9 
The new section of the Access Road will be excavated and formed by placing and 
rolling stone with macadam base course from the B4489 up to the Generating 
Equipment Site to allow clean vehicle access. A wheel cleaning system will be 
installed where vehicles leave the construction site and before reaching the existing 
section of the Access Road. The Access Road will have a tarmacadam surface. 
3.7.10 The perimeter of the Generating Equipment Site will be cleared of undergrowth and 
a permanent or temporary security fence placed with locked gates for main and 
emergency exits (capable of being opened in an emergency). A security cabin will 
Abergelli ES 2018 – CHAPTER 3: PROJECT AND SITE DESCRIPTION 
 
Prepared for:  Abergelli Power Limited   
 
AECOM 
3-16 
 
be established to provide accommodation for security personnel to be on site 
during construction 24 hours, seven days a week. 
3.7.11 The Laydown Area will be cleared and surfaced with stone, and site cabins placed 
with offices, first aid, changing rooms, mess facilities with temporary sewage 
system and parking for cars and machinery. 
3.7.12 Additional geotechnical investigations will be carried out post-consent to confirm 
details of ground properties for optimisation of foundation design. 
3.7.13 Vertical drainage is established and then underground services are excavated and 
placed. 
 Foundations and Piling 
c)
3.7.14 The need for piling will be determined following ground investigation works prior to 
construction. However, it has been assumed as part of the realistic worst case 
scenario for certain environmental topics that piling will be required for the 
purposes of this assessment.  
3.7.15 The main foundation building column bases for heavier structures (e.g. Gas Turbine 
Generator, water tanks and transformers) will be excavated to firm ground, the 
base rolled, blinding concrete placed, and pile caps cropped before fixing meshes 
of reinforcing steel. Timber shuttering boxes will then be placed, holding down bolts 
fixed, and concrete poured and finished for each base. 
3.7.16 Shallow foundations for lighter buildings and bases will be excavated to firm 
ground, the base rolled, blinding concrete placed, before fixing meshes of 
reinforcing steel. Timber shuttering boxes will then be placed, holding down bolts 
fixed, and concrete poured and finished for each base. 
3.7.17 Piling will be carried out using rotary driven piles in high load areas of the 
Generating Equipment Site such as plant and building column foundations. This 
technique will minimise disturbance of nearby sensitive ecological receptors. 
Shallow foundations for lighter buildings will be excavated. 
3.7.18 The ground will be backfilled between foundations and floor slabs will be cast with 
polished finish with spoil from excavations. 
 Access and Traffic 
d)
3.7.19 Site roads are excavated, rolled with stone, and a base coarse of tarmacadam 
placed. This greatly aids the cleanliness of the Project Site during construction. 
3.7.20 It is estimated that the construction and decommissioning phases will each result in 
a maximum of approximately 209 vehicle trips (two way) per day. This will include 
around 146 HGV deliveries (two way) per day during the peak construction and 
decommissioning periods. 
Abergelli ES 2018 – CHAPTER 3: PROJECT AND SITE DESCRIPTION 
 
Prepared for:  Abergelli Power Limited   
 
AECOM 
3-17 
 
3.7.21 The construction phase is anticipated to take 22 months with the peak of HGV 
deliveries occurring during the first quarter of construction (months 1 to 3) and the 
peak car and van trips occurring during the fifth quarter of construction (months 12 
to 14). The car or van trips would be mainly at the start and end of the working day 
whilst HGV trips would be spread across the day outside of peak times (see 
Chapter 12: Traffic, Transport and Access). 
3.7.22 The majority of embedded mitigation measures are set out in the Outline CEMP 
(Appendix 3.1) as set out at the end of this chapter. 
 Buildings 
e)
3.7.23 Factory finish painted building steelwork, columns, frames and roof trusses will be 
delivered and erected on to the cured foundations. 
3.7.24 Liner sheet cladding will be fixed to building frames, insulation blanket attached and 
outer cladding fixed to walls and roof. 
3.7.25 Windows, personnel and roller shutter equipment doors will be fitted to make 
buildings weather tight. 
3.7.26 Block work internal walls will be erected where buildings are divided. All buildings 
will be fitted out with electrical systems, plumbing and drainage. 
3.7.27 Cable draw pits and duct banks around the site would be excavated and cast. 
 
Generating Plant Installation 
f)
3.7.28 The gas turbine and generator package with auxiliary equipment skid would be 
delivered to the Project Site and placed over completed foundations with initial 
alignment. 
3.7.29 Prefabricated interconnecting piping spools and ducting would be fitted to the gas 
turbine and generator package to interconnect its auxiliaries. 
3.7.30 Fuel handling equipment skids would be placed and interconnecting piping made 
up. 
3.7.31 Electrical Switchgear is installed and cables pulled through prepared ducts to 
interconnect systems. 
 Gas Connection  
g)
3.7.32 The Gas Connection includes both the Gas Pipeline together with its connection 
with the AGI. The route for the actual Gas Pipeline will be marked out, topsoil 
stripped and moved to one side and the trench excavated. The exact construction 
method for the Gas Pipeline will be subject to further survey and dependant on the 
National Gas Transmission System depth and ground conditions.  
Abergelli ES 2018 – CHAPTER 3: PROJECT AND SITE DESCRIPTION 
 
Prepared for:  Abergelli Power Limited   
 
AECOM 
3-18 
 
3.7.33 Construction of the Gas Pipeline would likely take place within a temporary fenced 
strip of land called the ‘working width’. The working width is required to facilitate 
safe construction and the protection of off-site receptors. 
3.7.34 It is likely that the working width would be 30 m along the length of the Gas Pipeline 
route, although it may be necessary to increase / decrease the working width at 
specific points. For example, adjacent to road and water crossings it may be 
necessary to increase the working width to provide additional working areas and 
storage for materials or special plant. Alternatively, adjacent to areas of 
conservation or existing services it may be necessary to decrease the working 
width to reduce potential impacts. 
3.7.35 Aside from the special crossings, for example, water and road crossings, where 
trenchless techniques (e.g. HDD) may be used to reduce impact on sensitive 
areas, it is expected that the Gas Pipeline would be constructed using standard 
open-cut cross-country pipeline construction techniques.  
3.7.36 The Gas Pipeline will be delivered to the Project Site in spools and laid out along 
the route before welding into a string. The sections of pipe would then be lowered 
into the trench using side arm booms and backfilled for testing. Where the Gas 
Pipeline route crosses the National Gas Transmission System, an appropriate 
method of crossing will be undertaken which affords the appropriate level of 
protection to the National Gas Transmission System at its existing depth. This may 
include open cut techniques or a trenchless crossing such as HDD. 
3.7.37 Following the laying of the Gas Pipeline, the excavated material and topsoil will be 
returned to its original position. The surface will then be seeded to restore it to its 
original state. 
3.7.38 Gas systems skids will be placed and piping connected before commissioning the 
Gas Pipeline, pressure regulators and metering. 
3.7.39 The Gas Connection and Electrical Connection will cross an existing Public Right of 
Way (PRoW) as shown on Figure 3.4. During construction, temporary closure(s) of 
all or part of the footpath and restriction of the use of the footpath at any time in 
order to facilitate construction of the Project.  The Outline CEMP (Appendix 3.1) 
provides details of how these temporary arrangements will be managed. It is not 
envisaged that these will be stopped up.  
 Electrical Connection 
h)
3.7.40 The Electrical Connection will be constructed within the curtilage of the Access 
Road within a 5 m working width adjacent to the road. A cable duct will be installed 
adjacent to the Access Road to allow the cable to be pulled through at a later date. 
Short sections of open cut trench will be required at either end of the cable route 
where it does not coincide with the Access Road. The installation of the cable within 
the Substation is anticipated to be in cable ducts, although National Grid has 
recently started using direct buried cables within the Substation. 
Abergelli ES 2018 – CHAPTER 3: PROJECT AND SITE DESCRIPTION 
 
Prepared for:  Abergelli Power Limited   
 
AECOM 
3-19 
 
3.7.41 As described in Section 3.6, the Electrical Connection will require temporary 
bridges (for example temporary bailey bridge) over the Water Main and Oil Pipeline 
during the construction phase to enable access from the new section of Access 
Road and Laydown Area. The temporary bailey bridge will approximately 5 m in 
height from the anchor points on the existing ground level. 
3.8 
Commissioning and Completion 
 
Generating Plant 
a)
3.8.1 
All mechanical systems will be cold commissioned once alignment or rotating parts 
and pressure test of enclosed systems has been completed. 
3.8.2 
Electrical systems will be checked, commissioned and energised stage by stage. 
3.8.3 
The Gas Turbine Generator system will be checked and cold commissioned 
together with control room and National Grid communications. 
3.8.4 
When all systems are energised and cold commissioned, the gas turbine will be 
started and ‘first fired’. The turbine is run to full speed before synchronising to the 
grid and producing electrical energy in increasing load steps. 
3.8.5 
Grid Code compliance tests will be carried out as well as performance, noise and 
emissions tests. 
3.8.6 
All buildings will be completed, with sealing, painting, floor finishes and decoration. 
3.8.7 
All areas of the plant and buildings will be surveyed for outstanding work and minor 
defects and a programme established to complete these. 
3.8.8 
The base course at the side of each site road will be cut back to the final width and 
kerbs will be placed before the final wearing course of macadam is placed. Road 
marking and signs will be added. 
3.8.9 
Lighting will be installed in accordance with the Lighting Strategy within Appendix 
3.5. 
3.8.10 Areas surrounding and between the Generating Equipment will be levelled and 
crushed stone placed where required. Stored topsoil is placed in areas free from 
Generating Equipment, including the temporary site laydown areas and will have 
silt fencing or traps installed as appropriate around these stockpiles. The Outline 
CEMP (Appendix 3.1) provides further details.  
3.8.11 The estimated excavation volume for ground works and site levelling is 
approximately 19,000 m3.

3.9 
Operation and Maintenance 
 
Generating Plant 
a)
3.9.1 
For the purpose of this EIA it has been assumed that the Generating Equipment will 
be designed to have an operational life of 25 years. 
3.9.2 
The plant is expected to operate for up to 2,250 hours per year and 1,500 running 
hours rolling average over 5 years, supporting National Grid during periods of peak 
demand and system stress. The plant will have fast start up, response and ramping 
capability in order to meet the demand profile and compensate for the intermittency 
of certain forms of renewable power generation connected to the grid. 
3.9.3 
Sufficient spares would be held to ensure reliable operation of the Generating 
Equipment. Materials and finishes would be selected to ensure that the appearance 
of the Generating Equipment does not deteriorate with time. Periodic and routine 
maintenance would take place, on average, once every six months, to ensure 
optimal operation of the Generating Equipment at all times. 
3.9.4 
The Generating Equipment would benefit from on line monitoring and operational 
diagnosis to identify maintenance needs according to lifecycle use. 
3.9.5 
The permanent maintenance compound would be used to store/transfer spare 
parts should any need to be replaced during maintenance/repair. The maintenance 
compound would also be used periodically during operation for any maintenance 
activities that require movement of large plant items. 
3.9.6 
Materials and finishes would be selected to ensure that the appearance of the 
Power Generation Plant does not deteriorate with time. Periodic and routine 
maintenance would take place on average once yearly. Typically, planned 
maintenance would be carried out by one or two skilled personnel.  
3.9.7 
Inspections to replace or refurbish combustion and turbine hot parts equipment are 
typically carried out approximately every six years. For industrial gas turbines, this 
work can be done on site using a mobile crane and hand tools. A temporary bridge 
or crossing may be required for any abnormal or heavy components to be 
transported over the Water Main and Oil Pipeline. The shutdown duration is 
typically 15-20 days.  
3.9.8 
A gas turbine with dry low NOx combustion will be used. This will avoid the 
requirement for large amounts of demineralised water for emissions control. Water 
will be transported to the Project Site by water tankers for multiple uses including 
compressor washing in the Gas Turbine Generator and for servicing welfare 
facilities including potable water and hygiene consumption. Water for the gas 
turbine compressor washing will be demineralised. Demineralised water tankers will 
attend site approximately once a month to maintain a store of demineralised water. 
Typical quality requirements are for conductivity to be lower than 0.2 µS/cm, but 
vary with gas turbine supplier. After use, the compressor wash water is taken by 
tanker from site for licensed disposal. 
Abergelli ES 2018 – CHAPTER 3: PROJECT AND SITE DESCRIPTION

AECOM 
3-21 
 
3.9.9 
In the event of an unscheduled issue with the Generating Equipment, alarms would 
signal to the control room instances where there are issues with abnormal 
operation. These alarms would not be audible externally. The plant would be shut 
down immediately in such instances and an engineer would attend site. The 
Generating Equipment would not start up again until the issue had been resolved. 
Alarms would only be audible outside where there was an event affecting personnel 
safety such as a fire alarm.  
3.9.10 No significant mode shift away from the private car is likely for the Project and there 
are likely to be only a maximum of five workers on site at the same time. 
 Indicative Gas Connection Maintenance Activities 
b)
3.9.11 The Gas Connection would remain operational for the entire lifetime of the Power 
Generation Plant. No parts of the Gas Connection would be manned. Telemetry 
apparatus (both within the Gas Pipeline trench and at the AGI) would report back 
any issues to a central control room. Should any issues be identified, the Gas 
Pipeline would be isolated and the supply switched off, pending investigation of any 
faults. Access to the AGI during maintenance / repair would be via a new 
permanent access off Rhyd-y-pandy Road. 
3.9.12 The primary maintenance and inspection activities would be as follows: 
 
Visual checks; 
 
In-line inspection; 
 
Cathodic protection checks; and 
 
Valve operation checks. 
 Indicative Electrical Connection Maintenance Activities 
c)
3.9.13 No regular maintenance is anticipated to be carried out on the underground 
electrical cable. Maintenance of the electrical cable will be limited to repair in the 
event of a fault in the cable, in which case the cable will be isolated for repair in line 
with industry good practice. 
3.9.14 The electrical equipment would be subject to periodic inspection. To perform such 
inspections, pedestrian access is adequate.  
3.9.15 The route would be regularly checked to ensure that there are no excavation or 
construction works in the direct vicinity of the cables, that mounds of soil are not 
deposited above the cables and that trees are not planted above the cables; this 
should normally require little more than a drive past. 
3.9.16 In addition, periodic inspection of any above ground equipment associated with the 
cable system would be required. The above ground equipment would include cable 
terminations, and structures, and bonding system link housings; this would require 
access to the equipment. In some case dirt and debris can deposit on cable 
termination insulators which may therefore require cleaning. It is also 
recommended that the integrity of the cable oversheath be tested at least once 
every two to three years; this would require access to the cable terminations and 
Abergelli ES 2018 – CHAPTER 3: PROJECT AND SITE DESCRIPTION 
 
Prepared for:  Abergelli Power Limited   
 
AECOM 
3-22 
 
the bonding system link housings. In the event that the oversheath is found 
degraded or damaged then a repair may be required which would necessitate 
some excavation along the cable route (in most cases, oversheath damage results 
from the actions of third parties). 
3.10 
Decommissioning 
3.10.1 For the purpose of the EIA and in order to allow a decommissioning assessment to 
be presented in this ES, this assessment takes the design life of the power 
generation plant (25 years) as its assumption for the point in time when 
decommissioning is assessed. 
3.10.2 For the purposes of this assessment, it is assumed that the above ground 
Generating Equipment would be demolished after 25 years and all structures 
removed to 1 metre below ground level. The ground would then be dressed with 
topsoil, and reseeded, with the building platforms remaining insitu. No reprofiling of 
the Generating Equipment Site will be undertaken.  
3.10.3 The decommissioning phase would be likely to be of a similar duration to 
construction i.e. 22 months. The detail of future decommissioning will be 
determined following submission of a decommissioning strategy for approval by 
CCS under Requirement 19 in Schedule 2 of the DCO. 
3.10.4 Again, a working assumption has been used that the Electrical Connection and 
Gas Connection would be decommissioned after 25 years. However, it is important 
to note that elements of both Connections would be owned and operated by 
National Grid. In accordance with its statutory duties, National Grid may use these 
assets in the future as part of its wider network. As such, the date of any 
decommissioning cannot be certain and the 25 years working assumption has been 
used to allow for a reasonable assessment of decommissioning effects in this ES. 
In addition, elements of the Gas Connection and Electrical Connection may be left 
in situ as this is likely to cause less environmental effects than removal. This would 
be the case for the Gas Pipeline, for example. 
3.11 
Embedded Mitigation 
3.11.1 Mitigation which is either implicit in the design of the Project or its construction and 
operation through standard control measures routinely used, such as working 
within best practice guidance during construction, is known as embedded 
mitigation. This embedded mitigation has been assumed for the purposes of this 
ES to be in place from the outset, as it is mitigation without which the Project would 
be unlikely to be granted consent or allowed to commence. This ES has therefore 
assessed the likely significant effects of the Project including embedded mitigation.  
3.11.2 The embedded mitigation included within the Project, discussed on a topic-by-topic 
basis, is set out below and in the Mitigation Register provided in Appendix 3.1 and 
secured by the DCO and its requirements.

3.11.3 The CEMP will be prepared and then implemented during construction to mitigate 
any adverse environmental effects. An Outline CEMP for the Project is provided at 
Appendix 3.1. It includes measures relating to the environmental topics assessed in 
this ES which will mitigate the effects of construction. The Outline CEMP will be 
finalised and followed by the Contractor on site, once the content has been agreed 
with CCS. The finalised CEMP will include the following information: 
 
Community liaison; 
 
Complaints procedures; 
 
Nuisance management including measures to avoid or minimise the impacts of 
construction works (covering dust, noise, vibration and lighting); 
 
Dust management measures; 
 
Site waste and materials management measures; 
 
Surface and ground water protection measures; 
 
Pollution control measures; 
 
Security measures and use of artificial lighting; and 
 
A protocol in the event that unexpected contaminated land is identified during 
ground investigation or construction. 
3.11.4 The Outline Surface Water Management Plan (Appendix 3.2) provides details of 
protection of surface water features, including diversion of existing watercourse, 
surface water runoff and protection of private water supplies with particular 
reference to the Gas Connection and section of new Access Road.  
 Drainage  
a)
i. 
Construction 
3.11.5 The Project incorporates welfare facilities which will require a site foul water 
drainage system. The Project Site is remote and it is believed it will be unfeasible to 
connect to a public sewer. Therefore, a foul water drainage system will either drain 
to a septic tank or a package treatment plant within the Project Site but outside any 
area at risk of flooding. It is likely that the latter would be the preferred option for 
ease of maintenance and environmental criteria. The processed water would then 
discharge on site or to a nearby watercourse in accordance with Environmental 
Permit conditions, if required. 
3.11.6 An oily water drainage system will be required to receive surface water from 
potentially contaminated oil retaining areas and prevent contaminated water 
discharging from site. Oily water drainage shall be designed in accordance with 
National Grid Technical Specification 2.20 ‘Oil Containment at Electricity 
Substations and Other Operational Sites’ (Ref. 3.1), Oil Storage Regulations 2016 
(Ref. 3.2) and Pollution Prevention Guidance 3: Use and Design of Oil Separators 
in Surface Water Drainage Systems (Ref. 3.3) or similar approved guidelines.  
3.11.7 The surface water drainage system will be required to adequately drain the Project 
Site and prevent ponding. The surface water drainage system will adopt the 
principles of the SuDS Manual – Ciria C753. – Updated SuDS Manual reference 
2015 (Ref. 3.4).

3.11.8 To prevent inundation of the Project Site from surface runoff cut off drainage 
ditches will be placed around the uphill site perimeter. These new drainage ditches 
will be designed to carry the surface runoff around the Project Site and downstream 
back to the original drainage ditches/watercourses. This is detailed in the Outline 
Surface Water Management Plan (Appendix 3.2).  
3.11.9 Where possible, the new levels and surfacing will be designed so they naturally 
drain by infiltration into the surrounding ground. Where this is not economically 
possible or presents an unsatisfactory risk of flooding, infiltration drains will be 
installed. All infiltration drains will connect to the surface water drainage system.  
3.11.10 It is not expected that it will be possible to connect the surface water drainage 
system to an infiltration basin due to the presumed predominantly clayey ground 
and high groundwater level in places. This will be confirmed when the Ground 
Investigation surveys are carried out post-consent. Instead the discharged flow of 
water at the Generating Equipment Site boundary from the surface water drainage 
system will be attenuated in order to maintain the equivalent greenfield runoff flow 
for a range of events up to the 1 in 100 year event (with climate change allowance). 
The flow will be attenuated using suitably sized attenuation ponds with restricted 
discharge pipes to the existing greenfield runoff rates. An emergency overflow will 
be provided to the attenuation ponds to prevent site flooding in the event of an 
extreme rainfall event with suitable pollution prevention measures installed if 
possible to avoid a pollution event, although priority must be given to site security 
and resilience.  
3.11.11 Where possible, roadside swales and infiltration drains will be used to remove and 
convey any standing water into the surface water drainage system from internal 
roads within the Project Site including the new Access Road. Where there are 
space constraints, or there is an elevated risk of contamination, the new site roads 
will be kerbed and drain via road gullies with pollution control measures. It is 
expected that roadside swales will discharge to nearby local watercourses at the 
existing greenfield runoff rate.  
3.11.12 Existing field drainage that will cross the new Access Road will be culverted or 
bridged for a short length to allow flow up to the 1 in 100 year return period.  
ii. Operation 
3.11.13 As per paragraph 3.11.3, the Project will require a foul water drainage system for 
use from operational staff. Given the limited number of workers on a rotated shift 
pattern, the treated discharges from this foul water drainage system is expected to 
negligible.

 Air Quality 
b)
i. 
Construction 
3.11.14 The CEMP will include standard good practice dust mitigation measures, as set out 
in the Outline CEMP in Appendix 3.1. 
3.11.15 Daily visual inspections of dust emissions will be made in conjunction with dust 
emissions monitoring at locations to be agreed with NRW. If plumes of dust are 
visible, behind moving vehicles for example, or dust was visibly deposited on roads 
outside of the Project Site, more vigorous control measure may be required. 
3.11.16 Institute of Air Quality Management (IAQM) guidance on monitoring air quality at 
construction sites (Ref. 3.5) recommends that, in addition to visual inspections, 
ambient air monitoring is undertaken in the vicinity of high risk sites. This data is 
required for two reasons: the first relates to ensuring that mitigation measures are 
appropriate and being applied rigorously; the second is to provide early warning of 
increased dust emissions which allows for the cessation or modification of activities 
prior to impacts occurring. 
3.11.17 Monitoring will be undertaken in the vicinity of the Lletty-Morfil SINC. Since the risk 
for ecosystems relates to dust deposition, a real time monitor for total suspended 
particulate matter will be installed but this needs be an ‘indicative instrument’ only. 
Trigger levels for the instrument, which would suggest increasing risk/emissions, 
should be agreed with NRW prior to the commencement of construction. The 
monitoring stations will be mobile and would be moved around the Project Site as 
the principal activities move. 
ii. Operation 
3.11.18 The Generating Equipment will be designed to comply with Industrial Emissions 
Directive (IED) emission limits. In addition the stack height determination (Appendix 
6.2) has demonstrated that a minimum stack height of 35 m is appropriate to 
ensure the adequate dispersal of pollutants to ensure that no harm is caused. 
3.11.19 The Project will require an Environmental Permit to operate as required by the 
Environmental Permitting Regulations 2016 (as amended), and monitoring the 
performance of the Generating Equipment against the permit conditions will be the 
responsibility of APL, with NRW requiring confirmation and evidence that 
monitoring is being undertaken. The performance of the emissions control will 
require monitoring by stack emissions testing throughout operation and the 
Generating Equipment will be ‘fine-tuned' so as to ensure that limits are not 
exceeded. 
3.11.20 The operation of the Project will not require a significant onsite workforce. Visits by 
service/maintenance vehicles etc. will occur on average every year.

 Noise and Vibration 
c)
i. 
Construction 
3.11.21 It is anticipated that core working hours and boundary noise will be limited during 
construction by a Requirement in the DCO. Working hours are likely to be between 
08.00 and 18.00 on weekdays, and between 08.00 and 13.00 hours on Saturdays 
and public holidays. Some works may be allowed to take place outside of normal 
working hours provided they do not cause any noise disturbance. Should it be 
necessary to conduct work with the potential to generate noise, outside these core 
hours, this would be with the prior written agreement of CCS. These limits will not 
apply during commissioning and testing of the Project. 
3.11.22 Measures to mitigate noise and ensure compliance with any imposed maximum 
boundary noise limits will be implemented during the construction phase of the 
Project in order to minimise impacts at local residential Noise Sensitive Receptors 
(NSRs), particularly with respect to activities required outside of normal working 
hours. 
3.11.23 Construction noise mitigation measures are included in the Outline CEMP 
(Appendix 3.1). In order to keep noise effects from the construction phase to a 
minimum, all construction activities relating to the Power Generation Plant, Gas 
Connection, and Electrical Connection would be carried out in accordance with the 
recommendations of British Standard (BS) 5228 ‘Noise and Vibration Control on 
Construction and Open Sites’ (Ref. 3.6) as explained in Chapter 7: Noise & 
Vibration. 
3.11.24 Mitigation measures for inclusion within the CEMP may contain, but is not limited 
to: 
 
Abiding by any construction noise limits at nearby NSRs; 
 
Ensuring that all processes are in place to minimise noise before works begin 
and ensuring that best practicable measures (BPM) are being achieved 
throughout the construction programme, including the use of localised 
screening around significant noise producing plant and activities; 
 
Ensuring that modern plant is used, complying with the latest European noise 
emission requirements.  Selection of inherently quiet plant where possible; 
 
Hydraulic techniques for breaking to be used in preference to percussive 
techniques where practical; 
 
Use of lower noise piling (such as rotary bored or hydraulic jacking) rather the 
driven piling techniques (if required), where possible;  
 
Off-site pre-fabrication, where practical; 
 
All plant and equipment being used for the works to be properly maintained, 
silenced where appropriate, operated to prevent excessive noise, and switched 
off when not in use; 
 
All contractors to be made familiar with current legislation and the guidance in 
BS 5228 (Parts 1 and 2) (Ref. 3.6), which should form a prerequisite of their 
appointment; 
Abergelli ES 2018 – CHAPTER 3: PROJECT AND SITE DESCRIPTION 
 
Prepared for:  Abergelli Power Limited   
 
AECOM 
3-27 
 
 
Loading and unloading of vehicles, dismantling of site equipment such as 
scaffolding or moving equipment or materials around the Project Site, to be 
conducted in such a manner as to minimise noise generation; 
 
Appropriate routing of construction traffic on public roads and along access 
tracks;  
 
Consultation with CCS and local residents to advise of potential noisy works 
that are due to take place; and 
 
Monitoring of noise complaints, and reporting to the contractor for immediate 
investigation. 
3.11.25 Method statements regarding construction management, traffic management, and 
overall site management would be prepared in accordance with best practice and 
relevant British Standards, to help to minimise impacts of construction works.  One 
of the key aims of such method statements would be to minimise noise disruption 
to local residents during the construction period. 
3.11.26 Consultation and communication with the local community throughout the 
construction period would also serve to publicise the works schedule, giving 
notification to residents regarding periods when higher levels of noise may occur 
during specific operations, and providing lines of communication where complaints 
can be addressed.   
3.11.27 A detailed noise assessment would be carried out once the contractor is appointed 
and further details of construction methods are known, in order to identify specific 
mitigation measures for the Project.  
3.11.28 In addition, it is proposed that the contractor would be a member of the 
‘Considerate Constructors Scheme’ which is an initiative open to all contractors 
undertaking building work. 
ii. Operation 
3.11.29 The selection of the Project Site and development of the indicative concept layout 
have already included consideration of potential noise effects and proximity to 
NSRs, with Generating Equipment being located as close to the existing electrical 
infrastructure as possible and as far from the NSRs as practicable.   
3.11.30 Other measures with regards to noise and vibration during operation, to be 
incorporated into the design include: 
 
The gas turbine generator and major compressors are to be housed in acoustic 
enclosures. In addition, these will be housed within secondary acoustic 
enclosures specified at 75 dB(A) Sound Pressure Level at 1 m. 
 
Gas turbine air inlet filter and ventilation apertures are to be fitted with 
silencers, and designed such that all sensitive noise receptors benefit from 
screening and/or directivity corrections. 
 
Silencers are to be fitted in the exhaust stack. Due to the impracticality of 
screening stack noise, discharge noise will be controlled using these silencers, 
Abergelli ES 2018 – CHAPTER 3: PROJECT AND SITE DESCRIPTION 
 
Prepared for:  Abergelli Power Limited   
 
AECOM 
3-28 
 
which will be tuned to attenuate low frequencies from the gas turbine generator 
exhausts. 
 
All plant items will be controlled to minimise noise of an impulsive or tonal 
nature. 
 
Noise breakout from the stack will be controlled using silencers. To achieve the 
predicted noise levels used in this assessment, noise from the top of the stacks 
should not exceed the maximum octave band sound power levels identified in 
Table 7-8 in Chapter 7: Noise and Vibration. 
3.11.31 During the detailed design stage, options to mitigate potential significant residual 
noise effects by design will be further explored. 
3.11.32 Several options for configuration and suppliers of the Generation Equipment are 
under consideration. Preliminary modelling has shown that options are available 
that are capable of meeting the threshold noise levels. 
3.11.33 The Project would operate in accordance with an Environmental Permit issued and 
regulated by NRW. This would require operational noise from the Generating 
Equipment to be controlled through the use of BAT, which would be determined 
through the Environmental Permit application. 
3.11.34 If any non-normal and/or emergency operations were to lead to noise levels in 
excess of the agreed limits specified in the DCO Requirements, the operator will 
inform the local authority and residents of the reasons for these operations, the 
anticipated emergency period and the steps to be taken to bring it back to 
compliance. 
 Ecology 
d)
i. 
Construction 
3.11.35 Local habitats and protected species would be protected during the construction 
works through measures included within the Outline CEMP (Appendix 3.1) such as 
fencing to prevent access of species to working areas and translocation of 
protected species (e.g. reptiles). 
3.11.36 Sensitive ecology features such as the Ancient Woodland, trees and habitats have 
been avoided as much as possible during the Project design development and will 
continue to be considered in the potential improvements and widening of the 
existing access road from the B4489, drainage and landscape reinstatement.  
3.11.37 The Landscape and Ecology Mitigation Strategy (Appendix 3.4) sets out all 
necessary ecological mitigation measures as necessary to sufficiently mitigate the 
impacts on ecological receptors. The plan also outlines procedures to manage 
invasive species. 
ii. Operation 
3.11.38 The stack has been designed to minimise impacts from emissions during operation, 
which includes minimising deposition that could affect ecological receptors.

 Water Quality and Resources 
e)
i. 
Construction 
3.11.39 Hydrological protection measures have been included in the Outline Surface Water 
Management Plan (Appendix 3.2) to prevent pollution events, with particular 
reference to the Gas Connection and section of new Access Road. The Surface 
Water Management Plan includes details of silt traps and / or sedimats to reduce 
flow of suspended solids, suitable phasing to reduce the need for unprotected 
slopes and avoidance of stockpiled materials. The drainage strategy is included in 
Appendix E of Appendix 9.1. 
3.11.40 All designated oil retaining areas (e.g. oil filled transformers and oil storage areas) 
will be designed and constructed to contain at least 110% of the stored oil.  
ii. Operation 
3.11.41 Adaptation of different platform levels at the locations of key elements of the Project 
development. In line with this, the ground level of the Water Main easement area 
will be retained at the existing level in order to provide a path for any flood water to 
pass through the Project Site, thereby avoiding the elevated Power Generation 
Plant areas – with the Power Generation Plant finished floor level to be raised by 
approximately 150 mm above the site road crown level while keeping the plant 
plinths at 300 mm above the site level. 
3.11.42 Provision for all process water (i.e. gas turbine compressor wash water) to be 
collected in a drain tank removed by road tanker and disposed by an accredited 
company to a designated treatment facility off-site. 
3.11.43 Rainwater will be removed from oil retaining areas by an automatic pump to the oily 
water drainage system. The automatic pumps will be designed to shut down in the 
event that a major oil spillage is detected. This will help prevent large quantities of 
oil entering the oily water drainage system.  
3.11.44 The oily water drainage system will ultimately pass through a Class 1 Full Retention 
Oil Separator (as defined in BS EN 858) before discharging into surface water 
bodies or drainage systems. 
3.11.45 All oil unloading areas on site have been designed to include containment for 
accidental spillage of fuel during unloading with the loading system equipped such 
that drainage is isolated during filling and any spillage goes to the dedicated 
interceptor. 
3.11.46 The oil separator will be fitted with an alarm to indicate when the oil coalesce 
requires emptying. All oil separators will be sized to suit the oily water catchment 
area. Routine and regular maintenance inspections will be undertaken in 
accordance with legislation, the manufacturer’s recommendations and good 
practice.

Ground Conditions 
f)
i. 
Construction 
3.11.47 The CEMP will be implemented during construction to mitigate any adverse 
environmental effects and includes working in accordance with best practices, such 
as the completion of all necessary ground investigation and risk assessments, 
maintaining safe working practices and the use of correct and appropriate Personal 
Protective Equipment (PPE). 
3.11.48 The following information which relates specifically to geology, ground conditions 
and hydrogeology will be included within the CEMP: 
 
Surface and groundwater protection measures; 
 
Peat management measures as required; and 
 
Security measures; a protocol in the event that unexpected contaminated land 
is identified during ground investigation or construction. 
3.11.49 Intrusive ground investigation will be conducted post-consent, to be secured via a 
DCO Requirement, to identify ground conditions and potential contaminants, as will 
risk assessments including gas, control waters and human health.   
3.11.50 A detailed mining risk assessment may be required to establish the risk of 
untreated shallow underground workings beneath the Project Site. There is 
potential for mine workings and entries requiring stabilisation treatment so ground 
stability will be improved. 
3.11.51 A mineral resources survey will be undertaken to establish the value of the sand, 
gravel and coal reserves. 
3.11.52 A foundations risk assessment is likely to be required to assess the risk of piling 
foundations to controlled waters; however this will be confirmed by the ground 
investigation. 
 Landscape and Visual 
g)
i. 
Construction 
3.11.53 Mitigation measures will be implemented during the construction phase as set out 
in the Outline CEMP (Appendix 3.1) and the Landscape and Ecology Mitigation 
Strategy (Appendix 3.6) in order to limit impacts on the landscape and visual 
resource. These measures will include:  
 
The use of tall hoardings to screen views of ground level construction activities 
in relation to sensitive receptors such as residential views and views from 
nearby PRoW; 
 
Materials and machinery will be stored tidily during the construction works in 
order to minimise impacts on views; 
 
Lighting of compounds and work sites will be restricted to agreed working hours 
and those which are necessary for security in accordance with the Institution of 
Lighting Professionals guidelines (Ref. 3.7); 
Abergelli ES 2018 – CHAPTER 3: PROJECT AND SITE DESCRIPTION

 
The unnecessary removal of vegetation will be avoided; 
 
The retention and protection of existing trees in accordance with BS5837:2012 
Trees in Design, Demolition and Construction, Recommendations (Ref. 3.8); 
 
public roads providing access to construction site will be maintained fee of dust 
and mud; 
 
The Contractor will clear and clean all working areas and accesses as work 
proceeds and when no longer required for the works; 
 
On completion of construction works, all structures, equipment, surplus 
materials, waste, notice boards and temporary fences used during construction 
will be removed from the Project Site with minimum damage to the surrounding 
area; and  
 
Prompt reinstatement of areas that are no longer required following 
construction. 
ii. Operation 
3.11.54 Mitigation has been developed through a collaborative and iterative design process 
and is embedded into the Project design.  These design measures are set out in 
the following paragraphs.  
3.11.55 Utilising technology OCGT will allow a significant reduction in stack height 
compared to other technology types. As a result of selecting OCGT technology, 
there will be no visible plume arising from the stack. The high temperature of the 
exhaust gases means that water vapour is well above the condensation point which 
would give rise to a visible plume.  
3.11.56 The architectural design of the buildings and structures on the Project Site has 
been designed to reduce glare and to assimilate the Project into the surrounding 
landscape as much as possible by using neutral recessive colours to lessen the 
contrast with the surrounding landscape and break up the overall massing of the 
large scale structures. 
3.11.57 External lighting has been designed to reduce trespass and configured to avoid 
glare and spillage Details will be provided in the Lighting Strategy as submitted as 
part of the DCO Application and undertaken in accordance with the Institution of 
Lighting Professionals Guidelines (Ref. 3.7). 
3.11.58 The Landscape and Ecology Mitigation Strategy (Appendix 3.4) and Landscape 
and Ecology Mitigation Plan (LEMP) in Figure 3.6 has been developed to both 
provide reinstatement planting as well as to integrate the Project into the landscape 
and its wider setting. The planting proposals will be developed in accordance with 
the various utility and service constraints within the Project Site.  
3.11.59 The landscape proposals will cover a minimum period of five years of monitoring, 
management and maintenance to ensure the landscape objectives are successfully 
achieved.

Approach to Environmental Impact Assessment 
4.1 
Introduction 
4.1.1 
The purpose of this chapter is to provide a more detailed description of the EIA 
process, as well as outlining the methodology and relevant guidance used to 
undertake the EIA and the structure of the remainder of this ES.  
4.2 
EIA Regulations  
4.2.1 
The Infrastructure Planning (Environmental Impact Assessment) Regulations 2009 
(the ‘EIA Regulations’) require an EIA to be carried out in respect of any 
development listed in Schedule 1 to the EIA Regulations (‘Schedule 1 
development’). The Project is a Schedule 1 development as it is a thermal 
generating station with a heat output1 of 300 MW or more as listed in Schedule 1, 
paragraph 2(1) of the EIA Regulations.   
4.2.2 
The Project falls under the EIA Regulations and not the Infrastructure Planning 
(Environmental Impact Assessment) Regulations 2017 (EIA Regulations 2017). 
This is because a scoping opinion was requested from the Secretary of State under 
the EIA Regulations before the commencement of the EIA Regulations 2017. This 
means that, in accordance with the transitional arrangements at Regulation 37 of 
the EIA Regulations 2017, the EIA Regulations will continue to apply to the Project.

The information to be included in an ES is set out in Schedule 4 of the EIA 
Regulations. Part 1 of the Schedule details the information that the applicant can 
reasonably be required to provide, whilst Part 2 identifies the information that the 
applicant must provide. This information is highlighted in Table 4-1 below, which 
also provides confirmation of where the information is provided within this ES.

1 Thermal output is commonly defined as the amount of ‘useable heat’ which is produced as part of the process of the combustion of fuel. 
Only a part of this useable heat can be converted to electrical energy, which is why this is a larger value than electrical output.

Environmental Impact Assessment 
4.3.1 
EIA is the process of identifying, evaluating and, where possible, mitigating the 
likely significant environmental effects of a proposed development. It promotes the 
early identification and evaluation of the potentially significant environmental effects 
of a proposed development and enables appropriate mitigation (that is measures to 
avoid, reduce or offset significant adverse effects) to be identified and incorporated 
into the design of a development, or commitments to be made to environmentally 
sensitive construction methods and practices. 
4.3.2 
The results of the EIA also ensure that decision makers such as the SoS and 
statutory consultees such as planning authorities, in this case CCS, as well as 
other interested parties, including local communities, are aware of a Project’s 
environmental effects. These are then taken into account by the decision-maker 
prior to determination of an application for planning approval. 
4.3.3 
The main steps outlined in the PA 2008 and the EIA Regulations are as follows: 
 
Production of a Scoping Report to identify the likely significant effects (scoped 
in) and the proposed methodology for their assessment in line with relevant 
legislation, guidance and methods, and justification for any significant effects 
that are not likely (scoped out). The Scoping Report will also seek agreement of 
study areas, data sources, survey methodologies and terminology; 
 
Baseline surveys are undertaken to identify and describe the environmental 
character of the area that could potentially be affected by the Project. Where 
baseline data indicates major constraints to the Project, this information is to be 
provided to the design team immediately; 
 
Relevant natural and manmade processes that may change the character of 
the site are identified; 
 
Consideration is then given to the possible interactions between the 
Development and both existing and future site conditions. These interactions or 
impacts are assessed using set criteria based on accepted guidance and good 
practice; 
 
Using the initial designs of the Project, the likely significant environmental 
effects, both direct and indirect, can be established;  
 
Production of a Preliminary Environmental Information report (PEIR) for 
consultation purposes; 
Abergelli ES 2018 – CHAPTER 4: APPROACH TO ENVIRONMENTAL IMPACT ASSESSMENT 
 
Prepared for:  Abergelli Power Limited 
 
AECOM 
4-5 
 
 
Recommendations are made to avoid, minimise or mitigate adverse effects and 
enhance positive effects. Alterations to the design will then be reassessed and 
the significance of likely residual environmental impacts ascertained; and 
 
Following statutory consultation, the results of the EIA in combination with the 
responses to the Scoping Opinion are set out in an ES that accompanies the 
proposed DCO Application. 
4.3.4 
This ES summarises the environmental impact assessment undertaken to date and 
has sought to address comments that were raised by consultees and stakeholders 
during statutory consultation carried out under s42 and s47 of the PA 2008. These 
comments are addressed within each individual technical chapter as necessary.  
a) Scoping  
4.3.5 
Scoping involves focusing the EIA on those issues of greatest potential 
significance. It is an important tool for identifying the likely significant environmental 
effects of a project through its design, construction and operation and 
decommissioning phases and ensures that appropriate mitigation options are 
considered, where necessary. 
4.3.6 
APL requested a Scoping Opinion from the SoS in July 2014. The request was 
supported by a Scoping Report that described the anticipated likely significant 
environmental issues requiring detailed evaluation as part of the EIA process. The 
formal Scoping Opinion was received in August 2014. It has allowed for agreement 
on the potential likely significant environmental effects of the Project and, therefore, 
the aspects of the environment on which the EIA should focus. 
4.3.7 
The Scoping Report and Opinion can be found on the Planning Inspectorate’s 
website2 and APL’s website3 as well as at Appendix 4.1 and 4.2. APL’s responses 
to the matters raised in the Scoping Opinion and later consultation and 
engagement are set out in Appendix 4.3. 
4.3.8 
Further consultation with those organisations that commented on the Scoping 
Report, as well as the Community Councils, was also carried out during Phase 1 
and Phase 2 consultation including: 
 
Natural Resources Wales (NRW); 
 
South and West Wales Wildlife Trust (SWWWT);

4.3.9 
Regular meetings and telecoms were held with CCS and NRW to discuss the 
progress of the application for development consent and to consult with the 
different environmental departments. 
4.3.10 The consultation process has led to the general agreement with all organisations 
that the EIA reported on in this ES will consider the following environmental topics: 
 
Air Quality; 
 
Noise; 
 
Ecology; 
 
Landscape; 
 
Water Quality and Resources; 
 
Geology and Hydrogeology; 
 
Traffic, Transport and Access; 
 
Historical Environment; and 
 
Socio-economics. 
4.3.11 Chapter 15: Other Effects has also been included in the ES and covers issues 
which are not covered within the standard topic chapters but which have emerged, 
through the consultation process, as matters that need to be addressed. 
4.3.12 Table 4-2 discusses the items that have been scoped out of the assessment, but 
fall under the above topic areas. 
Table 4-2: Items Scoped out of the EIA 
Topic / Scope 
Justification 
Transboundary 
Effects 
Due to the design, proposed mitigation and implementation of best 
practice measures, it is considered that there will be no significant 
transboundary effects caused by the Project that will affect any other 
European Economic Area State. A Transboundary Screening 
assessment has been undertaken by the SoS which confirms this 
approach. 
Air 
Quality 
[Electrical or Gas 
Connections] 
No impacts on local air quality are anticipated from the operation of 
the Electrical or Gas Connections and therefore this has not been 
assessed. The SoS agreed with this approach in the Scoping Opinion 
(paragraph 3.8, Appendix 4.3). 
Vibration 
The identified plant/equipment items to be used are not recognised 
as sources of high levels of vibration and therefore operation and 
decommissioning vibration has not been assessed. The SoS did not 
disagree with this approach in the Scoping Opinion (Appendix 4.3). 
Noise [Electrical or 
Gas Connections] 
The Gas and Electrical Connections will be buried underground and 
therefore it is not anticipated that they will generate any noise or 
vibration during operation. Therefore, these elements have not been 
assessed. The SoS partly agreed with this approach in the Scoping 
Opinion (paragraph 3.8, Appendix 4.2) but requested further 
justification of the approach. Further justification is set out in Chapter 
7: Noise and Vibration.

AECOM 
4-7 
 
Topic / Scope 
Justification 
Landscape [Brecon 
Beacons 
National 
Park] 
The Brecon Beacons National Park lies over 15 km to the north of the 
Project Site and, due to the intervening distance, is both physically 
and visually separate. Both protected landscapes have been scoped 
out of the assessment due to the physical and visual separation. This 
approach has been agreed with the Brecon Beacons National Park 
Authority at the request of the SoS (paragraph 3.66, Appendix 4.3). 
Water Quality and 
Resources 
[Electrical or Gas 
Connections] 
Effects on water quality and resources during operation and 
decommissioning of the Gas and Electrical Connections are unlikely 
to occur and have been scoped out of the chapter (Chapter 9: Water 
Quality and Resources). Ground levels along the route corridor of 
the Gas and Electrical Connections will be very similar to existing 
levels and any ongoing maintenance will be negligible, as described 
in Section 3.9. The impacts during the operation phase are therefore 
considered to be limited to the presence of the trench if it has 
different hydraulic properties to the surrounding natural ground. This 
can be mitigated through careful selection and placing of bedding and 
backfill material to try and match the natural ground as far as 
possible. Transport of pollutants associated with previous land uses 
is addressed in Chapter 10: Geology, Ground Conditions, and 
Hydrogeology. 
Water Quality and 
Resources [AGI] 
The AGI will have a small footprint and the design will include 
appropriate SuDS measures for control and treatment of surface 
water runoff in accordance with the drainage strategy for the Project 
Site. There will be no effluent discharges for the Gas Connection. The 
Gas Connection lies north of the Generating Equipment Site where 
flood risks are low, and will be mitigated through raised ground levels 
where necessary. No comments were received at Scoping stage 
therefore this has been scoped out of the assessment.  
Carbon 
Capture 
Readiness 
With a rated electrical output of less than 300MW, the Project will be 
below the threshold set out in Directive 2009/31/EC (as transposed 
by The Carbon Capture Readiness (Electricity Generating Stations) 
Regulations 2013) and NPS EN-1 and EN-2. Operators of 
combustion plants which are above this threshold are required to 
have assessed the feasibility of: a storage site, transport facilities and 
economic considerations of the capture of CO2
 produced as a result 
of the combustion process. As a result it is not necessary to assess 
the viability of CO2 capture in this ES. 
 
b) Preliminary Environmental Information Report 
4.3.13 Under Regulation 10(b) of the EIA Regulations the applicant must consult on 
preliminary environmental information relating to the Project. In 2014, this 
information was compiled into a Preliminary Environmental Information Report 
(2014 PEIR) (Ref. 4.1), which provided the environmental information collected part 
of the way through the EIA process as well as an assessment, on a preliminary 
basis, of the likely significant environmental effects of the Project. 
Abergelli ES 2018 – CHAPTER 4: APPROACH TO ENVIRONMENTAL IMPACT ASSESSMENT 
 
Prepared for:  Abergelli Power Limited 
 
AECOM 
4-8 
 
4.3.14 The 2014 PEIR was compiled along with the 2014 PEIR NTS to accompany APL’s 
Phase 1 statutory consultation with both the local community and prescribed 
consultees. 
4.3.15 In 2018, a second PEIR was compiled (2018 PEIR; Ref 4-3) along with the 2018 
PEIR NTS to accompany APL’s Phase 2 statutory consultation on a refined Project 
in advance of submitting its DCO Application. This ES has evolved from the 2018 
PEIR, and includes an updated environmental assessment and provides more 
information on how the Project has developed since the Phase 2 consultation in 
2018. 
4.3.16 Feedback received during both the Phase 1 and Phase 2 statutory consultation 
helped further inform and refine the development of the design of the Project and 
the EIA process. More detailed analysis of this is included within the Consultation 
Report (Document Reference 5.1.0); however a summary of a selection of the main 
themes is as follows: 
 
Site selection; 
 
Landscape; 
 
Transport and traffic; 
 
Socio-economics; 
 
Air quality and Noise; and  
 
Water. 
4.3.17 In order to aid the reader, this ES highlights where the technical assessments have 
been updated, either as a result of the Project evolution and / or due to an update 
in environmental baseline information which has been collated since 2014. Within 
the Introduction section to each technical chapter, a short summary of any changes 
which have been undertaken has been included where necessary.  Further detailed 
information on the design changes to the Project is included in Chapter 5: 
Alternatives Considered.  
4.4 
Environmental Baseline 
4.4.1 
In undertaking an EIA for any project, it is important to identify the environmental 
baseline for the potential receptors which may be affected. This has allowed the 
effects of the Project to be compared and/or combined with the existing baseline in 
order to ensure an informed assessment of the potential effects of the Project and 
to allow the identification of the most appropriate mitigation which could be 
employed to minimise any identified likely significant adverse effects. 
4.4.2 
To establish the baseline, a study area that is appropriate for each assessment 
topic is identified which takes into consideration the surrounding context and the 
likely scale and range of potential significant effects. Next, a range of environmental 
data has been gathered from a combination of sources in respect of the study area 
in order to inform the preliminary assessment. This has included: 
Abergelli ES 2018 – CHAPTER 4: APPROACH TO ENVIRONMENTAL IMPACT ASSESSMENT 
 
Prepared for:  Abergelli Power Limited 
 
AECOM 
4-9 
 
 
Documentary information on the Power Generation Plant, Gas Connection and 
Electrical Connection, and their surroundings within each relevant study area, 
including information available from the previous EIA work for other projects; 
 
Field survey information, including: Phase 2 ecological surveys; landscape 
character 
assessments; 
background 
noise 
levels; 
ground 
conditions/ 
contaminated land assessments, location of sensitive receptors and traffic 
levels on the road network; and 
 
Data held by both statutory and non-statutory consultees. 
4.4.3 
It is anticipated that the construction of the Project will commence in early 2020. 
The assessment has therefore used a '2020 baseline' to provide a future baseline 
against which the assessment is undertaken. As such a number of developments 
are considered in the assessment of effects, where those already have planning 
permission and are expected to be constructed in the next three years. Cumulative 
Projects have been agreed with CCS and are listed in Table 4-6. 
4.5 
Realistic Worst Case Scenario for Assessment 
4.5.1 
In accordance with PINS Advice Note 9 (Rochdale Envelope) (Ref. 4.2), the 
assessments presented in this ES are based on an assessment of the realistic 
'worst case' scenario arising from the Project parameters described in Table 3-3. 
This allows flexibility for APL whilst ensuring that the likely significant environmental 
effects are identified and adequately assessed. The realistic worst case scenario is 
set out in each topic chapter for clarity and transparency. 
4.5.2 
Taking the above into consideration, it has been determined that for all topic areas 
to be addressed in the EIA except air quality, the highest stack height (45 m) 
represents the 'worst case'. For air quality the minimum stack heights of 35 m 
represents the 'worst case' due to lower dispersion. The ES contains an 
explanation in each chapter of why the scenario assessed represents the worst 
case for that topic. 
4.5.3 
For the assessment, it has been assumed that the Generating Equipment will 
operate for a worst case of 2,250 hours per year in the noise and air quality 
assessments, although actually it is expected to be running for 1,500 hours 
averaged over a rolling 5 year period. In the noise assessment, it is assumed that 
the Generating Equipment will operate at night to represent the worst case 
scenario. Where there is the possibility that intermittent operation could give rise to 
more significant effects than continuous operation (for example start-up noise) this 
has been considered in the noise and air quality assessments, as well as 
disturbance to ecological receptors in the ecological assessment. This issue is not 
relevant to any other topic chapters. 
4.6 
Assessment Methodology 
4.6.1 
Methodologies for each subject area are presented within each of the technical 
chapters. These methodologies are based upon recognised good practice and 
Abergelli ES 2018 – CHAPTER 4: APPROACH TO ENVIRONMENTAL IMPACT ASSESSMENT 
 
Prepared for:  Abergelli Power Limited 
 
AECOM 
4-10 
 
guidelines specific to each subject area, and take into account any consultation 
responses relating to the methods used in the 2014 and 2018 PEIR, the SoS 
Scoping Opinion and any additional requirements that have been identified in 
connection with the Project. 
a) Assessment of Effects 
4.6.2 
The approach is broadly the same for all specialist topic areas with some variation 
in the descriptions of assessment criteria. For each topic, the assessment of 
significance will be informed by the sensitivity of the existing or baseline 
environmental conditions or character, and the magnitude of the change to the 
existing conditions or baseline character which occur as a result.  
4.6.3 
The determination of the significance of the likely environmental effects arising from 
development is a key stage in the EIA process. To assess the overall significance of 
an effect it is necessary to establish the magnitude of the effect occurring (i.e. the 
change to the existing baseline conditions as a result of the Project) and the 
sensitivity or importance of the receiving environment or receptor. Assessment of 
significance for environmental topics will combine professional judgement with the 
consideration of a number of factors including: 
 
The probability of the effect occurring based on the scale of certain, likely or 
unlikely; 
 
The sensitivity and value of the resource or receptor under consideration; 
 
The magnitude of the impact in relation to the degree of change which occurs 
as result (which includes the duration of the effect – short medium or long 
term); 
 
Reversibility of the effect; 
 
Comparison with legal requirements, policies and standards; and 
 
Comparison with applicable environmental thresholds. 
4.6.4 
The value of the receptors is assessed according to the relative importance of 
existing environmental features on or near to the site, or by the sensitivity of 
receptors i.e. whether they are likely to be robust enough to be unaffected by the 
Project or alternatively are highly susceptible to the type of effects likely to occur. 
Criteria for the determination of sensitivity or value of receptors are established 
based on approved guidance, legislation, statutory designation and/or professional 
judgment. 
4.6.5 
The below provides only a general framework for the determination of effects. In 
some cases a technical chapter may define its own interpretation of sensitivity or 
magnitude of effect in line with the relevant topic specific guidance.  
i. 
Sensitivity or value of Receptors 
4.6.6 
Table 4-3 provides general definitions of the sensitivity criteria used within the 
assessment. In each specialist chapter of this ES, criteria will be explained with 
reference to that particular discipline which may differ to the below.

Table 4-3: Generic Guidelines for the assessment of value/ sensitivity  
Value/ 
sensitivity 
Guidelines 
Very High 
The receptor has little or no ability to absorb change without fundamentally 
altering its present character, is of very high environmental value, or of 
international importance. 
High 
The receptor has low ability to absorb change without fundamentally altering 
its present character, is of high environmental value, or of national 
importance. 
Medium 
The receptor has moderate capacity to absorb change without significantly 
altering its present character, has some environmental value, or is of 
regional importance. 
Low 
The receptor is tolerant of change without detriment to its character, is low 
environmental value, or local importance. 
Negligible 
The receptor is resistant to change and is of little environmental value. 
 
ii. Magnitude of Effect 
4.6.7 
The magnitude of potential effects on environmental baseline conditions is 
identified through consideration of the Project taking into account the scale or 
degree of change from the existing situation as a result of the effect; and the 
duration and reversibility of the effect, as well as consideration of relevant 
legislative or policy standards or guidelines. 
4.6.8 
Table 4-4 provides general definitions of effect magnitude criteria. In each specialist 
chapter of this ES, effect magnitude criteria will be explained with reference to that 
particular discipline which may differ to the below.

iii. Assessment of Significance of Effects 
4.6.9 
The approach to the assessment of significance is outlined in Table 4-5. A 
combination of the magnitude of the effect under consideration and the sensitivity 
of the receiving environment determines the significance of effect. 
4.6.10 It should be noted that this general approach is a framework and should not be 
treated as a matrix. In each specialist chapter of the ES, significance of effects will 
be explained with reference to that particular discipline which may differ to the 
below.

4.6.12 For some specialist topics, additional categories have been added where a greater 
level of definition is required. 
4.6.13 Effects predicted to be Minor Adverse or Negligible are considered to be 
manageable and are therefore ‘Not Significant’. Effects assessed as Moderate 
Adverse or Major Adverse are considered to be 'Significant'. 
4.6.14 These classifications may differ between the specialist topic chapters, but where 
this occurs, the variation will be explained clearly and fully. 
iv. Types of Effect 
4.6.15 Potential effects have been separated into three types based on the different 
phases of development:  
 
Construction Effects: These are effects that begin and end during the 
construction phase of the Project. This covers the likes of the potential effects 
of construction traffic, noise and vibration from construction, dust generation, 
site runoff, mud on roads, risk of fuel/oil spillage, visual intrusion of machinery 
on site for example. 
 
Operational Effects: Operational effects are those long-term effects that would 
occur as a result of the Project such as the land take associated with 
permanent physical infrastructure as well as effects which occur as a result of 
its operation. 
 
Decommissioning Effects: Decommissioning effects are temporary, short 
term effects that will occur during the removal of the Project at the end of its 25 
year operational life time. 
 
b) Mitigation and Monitoring 
4.6.16 Full consideration has been given to the potential mitigation measures which could 
be used to ensure that any potentially adverse significant environmental effects of 
the Project are minimised. In the hierarchy of mitigation, likely significant adverse 
effects should, in the first instance, be avoided altogether; where this is not possible 
such effects should then reduce and, finally, be off-set. 
4.6.17 Two broad types of potential mitigation measures have been applied in this EIA and 
are described in this ES. 
Embedded mitigation: Namely design/standard control measures, such as 
working within best practice guidance, which would routinely be incorporated for the 
Project or for any similar project constructed in the UK, and as such would be taken 
into account in the initial assessment as to the likely significant effects of the 
Project (further details have been provided in Section 3.11, and in the Outline 
CEMP and Mitigation Register in Appendix 3.1).  
 
 
Additional mitigation: Mitigation which may be introduced, where appropriate, 
following the assessment of the likely significant effects of the Project alone 
Abergelli ES 2018 – CHAPTER 4: APPROACH TO ENVIRONMENTAL IMPACT ASSESSMENT 
 
Prepared for:  Abergelli Power Limited 
 
AECOM 
4-15 
 
and cumulatively with other projects with embedded mitigation. It is this 
additional mitigation that has been assessed for effectiveness and that has 
been taken into account in the assessment of the residual likely significant 
environmental effects of the Project (i.e. the likely significant environmental 
effects that remain following the application of additional mitigation). .  
4.6.18 These measures are described in the Chapter 3: Project and Site Description, 
and a summary is provided in the topic chapters, where relevant to the topic. 
4.7 
Assumptions and Limitations 
4.7.1 
The following assumptions have been made in each of the topic chapters when 
assessing the Project. 
a) Construction/ Decommissioning 
 
The total construction programme will be approximately 22 months, with a start 
date of early 2020.  
 
The Generating Equipment will be decommissioned and removed at the end of 
its operational life which is 25 years; 
 
The decommissioning phase will be around 22 months; 
 
The underground elements of the Gas and Electrical Connections will be 
capped and left in situ at the end of their operational life to avoid any adverse 
environmental effects associated with their removal; 
 
The design, construction and decommissioning phases of the Project will 
satisfy minimum environmental standards, consistent with contemporary 
legislation, practice and knowledge. 
 
b) Operation 
 
To ensure decommissioning is assessed in principle, the operational life of the 
Power Generation Plant has been assumed to be 25 years; 
 
The Generating Equipment will operate intermittently for up to 2,250 hours per 
annum (1,500 running hours rolling average over 5 years). This could be at any 
time during the year, at any time of day and for any length of time up to but not 
exceeding 2,250 hours; 
 
The Generating Equipment will have a rated electrical output of up to 299 MW; 
 
Existing (2017) surrounding land uses will not change, with the exception of the 
developments to be cumulatively assessed with the Project, which have been 
identified below; 
 
Assessments are based on published sources of information and primary data 
collection; 
 
Assessments are based on the description of the Project as set out in Chapter 
3: Project and Site Description; and 
 
Any future development of the Project Site will be determined through separate 
planning or application or application for development consent and has not 
been assessed as part of the assessment presented in this ES.

4.7.2 
Each topic chapter sets out any specific additional limitations and assumptions 
relevant to that topic. 
4.8 
Cumulative and In-Combination Effects 
4.8.1 
Schedule 4, Part 1 (paragraph 20) of the EIA Regulations requires an ES to include 
‘…a description of the likely significant effects of the development on the 
environment, which should cover….cumulative effects’.   
4.8.2 
Cumulative and in-combination effects on specific resources or receptors are 
described, where relevant, in each of the specialist chapters of this ES. 
4.8.3 
Cumulative effects may occur where, for example, landscape and visual resources, 
land use or ecological receptors are affected by other developments in addition to 
the Project i.e. two effects which are not significant could combine to result in a 
potential cumulative effect which is significant. 
4.8.4 
In consultation with CCS, it has been confirmed that there are 34 projects with the 
potential to cause cumulative effects. Discussions with CCS have been undertaken 
to determine the potential for any inter-project cumulative effects. Cumulative and 
in-combination effects have been defined and considered within this EIA and are 
assessed in Chapter 17: Cumulative Effects.  
4.8.5 
Developments which may need to be considered within the cumulative assessment 
(in accordance with paragraph 86 of DCLG guidance and PINS Advice Note 17 
(AN17) (Version 1, December 2015) include those that are: 
 
In the process of being built; 
 
Permitted application(s) but not yet implemented; 
 
Submitted application(s) not yet determined; 
 
Projects on the National Infrastructure’s programme of projects; 
 
Projects identified in the relevant development plan (and emerging 
development plants – with appropriate weight being given as they move closer 
to adoption) recognising that information on the relevant proposals will be 
limited; and 
 
Projects identified in other plans and programmes (as appropriate) which set 
the framework for future DCOs/approvals, where such development is 
reasonably likely to come forward. 
4.8.6 
Using this approach, the developments listed in Table 4-6 have been identified (see 
Figure 4.1), with a cut-off date (end of February 2018), and have been agreed with 
CCS.

4.8.7 
In addition, the Project is located within the Swansea Vale Development Area (UDP 
Policy EC1(3)) and this policy has also been considered for assessment of any 
significant cumulative effects. Swansea Vale is situated approximately 5 km from 
the Project Site and extends to some 190 ha south of a railway line and the M4. 
The assessment has also considered emerging LDP Proposals for settlements at 
the former tinplate works (also allocated for the Felindre Sustainable Urban Village) 
and Penllergaer, and the solar park at Lletty Morfil Farm (CCS Ref: MA0004). 
4.8.8 
The GIS building within the Substation will be extended at its eastern elevation 
(retaining the same height and width as the existing building) in order to facilitate 
the connection of the Project to the NETS. These works will be implemented by 
National Grid and is considered as a cumulative scheme within this DCO 
Application. 
4.8.9 
Approximately 300 m of 11 kV overhead line crosses the Generating Equipment 
Site from north west to south east at its western boundary. This section of line, 
owned by Western Power Distribution, will be diverted to avoid the Generating 
Equipment Site either above or below ground. This is not to be considered as part 
of the DCO Application, and will be assessed in the cumulative assessment.  
4.8.10 Projects described in Table 4-6 have been considered in the cumulative 
assessment in each of the topic chapters where relevant. 
4.8.11 Paragraph 87 of the DCLG guidance states ‘It may not always be easy for 
applicants to assess potential impacts fully due to lack of available information. In 
such circumstances, applicants should take a pragmatic approach when 
determining what is reasonable and feasible. They should satisfy themselves that 
they have made all reasonable efforts to identify the main impacts and to include 
mitigation in the draft Order.’ The assessment of cumulative effects in each of the 
topic chapters has utilised information in relation to each of the above applications 
where publicly available.  
4.8.12 See Chapter 17: Cumulative Effects for further detail and the assessment. 
4.9 
Residual Effects 
4.9.1 
Residual effects are those given after taking into account additional mitigation. 
Effects are concluded to be significant or not significant. In some chapters, 
guidance is used which specifies its own variation to this assessment matrix. This 
will be explained and justified as appropriate. Further detail is provided in each 
technical chapter. 
4.9.2 
Judgements of significance are made based on a combination of perceived value 
and sensitivity of the receptor and the magnitude of change, and will also include, 
where necessary, an element of professional judgement by each of the technical 
specialists. The final evaluation of significance considers the residual effects, 
assuming all mitigation measures are applied. The terminology for expressing 
significance has been outlined in Section 4.6. Where appropriate, any topic-specific 
Abergelli ES 2018 – CHAPTER 4: APPROACH TO ENVIRONMENTAL IMPACT ASSESSMENT

deviation to this by guidance and best practice is described in the technical 
chapters. 
4.10 
Consultation and Engagement 
a) 
Non-statutory Consultation  
4.10.1 APL engaged with the local community and key stakeholders during an early phase 
of non-statutory consultation between June and September 2014, in advance of the 
commencement of the statutory consultation phase and at a point where the 
Project was still being actively refined. This was at the same time as seeking 
feedback from Statutory Consultees on the Scoping Report. 
4.10.2 Local community representatives at the national, regional and local levels were 
consulted by APL and public exhibitions were held in Clydach, Felindre and Tircoed 
in June 2014. As part of this non- statutory phase of consultation, APL explained 
the rationale and key objectives of the Project, gave reasons why the Project Site 
had been chosen and presented opportunities for written and verbal feedback on 
the early, emerging project concepts. 
4.10.3 Drawing on this early feedback on the proposals, APL was able to consider the 
consultation responses as part of the design development and environmental 
assessment processes. This phase of non-statutory consultation helped to shape 
the development of the Project. This process is described in detail in the 
Consultation Report. 
b) Statutory Consultation  
4.10.4 APL conducted Phase 1 statutory consultation under s42, s47 and s48 of PA 2008 
between 13th October 2014 and 16th November 2014. Published in September 
2014, and agreed with CCS prior to publication, the Statement of Community 
Consultation (SoCC) Notice confirmed where and when the SoCC could be 
inspected by members of the public. Letters inviting comments on the Project, 
including the Preliminary Environmental Information, were sent to s42 consultees 
directly. Consultation notices were published in national and local newspapers 
under s48 of the PA 2008. 
4.10.5 The statutory consultation phase also coincided with the publication of the 2014 
PEIR. The 2014 PEIR provided the environmental information collected in the early 
stages of the EIA process as well as an assessment, on a preliminary basis, of the 
likely significant environmental effects of the Project. The 2014 PEIR, together with 
supporting information and a Non-Technical Summary (2014 PEIR NTS), was 
compiled to accompany APL’s statutory consultation with both the local community 
and prescribed consultees.  
4.10.6 The Phase 2 consultation and 2018 PEIR provided updated environmental 
information and design changes, and on a preliminary basis, of the likely significant 
environmental effects of the Project. Letters inviting comments on the Project were 
sent to s42 consultees directly. Consultation notices were published in national and 
Abergelli ES 2018 – CHAPTER 4: APPROACH TO ENVIRONMENTAL IMPACT ASSESSMENT 
 
Prepared for:  Abergelli Power Limited 
 
AECOM 
4-25 
 
local newspapers under s48 of the PA 2008. Consultation took place from 16th 
January 2018 until 19th February 2018 (inclusive) and public exhibitions were again 
held in Llangyfelach, Clydach, Tircoed and Felindre to update people living in close 
proximity to the Project and introduce it to anyone who did not participate in the 
2014 consultation. 
4.10.7 Between the 2014 PEIR, 2018 PEIR and this ES, there have been changes to the 
Project resulting from design progression, consultation and feasibility. This is 
further described in Chapter 5: Alternatives Considered.

5.1.1 
Schedule 4, Part 1 of the EIA Regulations (Ref. 5.1) requires that an ES provides 
‘An outline of the main alternatives studied by the Applicant [APL] and an indication 
of the main reasons for the Applicant's [APL’s] choice, taking into account the 
environmental effects’. Under the EIA Regulations applicable to this Project there is 
no requirement to assess alternatives, only a requirement to provide an outline of 
those alternatives that have actually been considered. In this case, the need to 
consider alternatives is not engaged under the Habitats Regulations or pursuant to 
a policy requirement under Section 5.3, 5.7 and 5.9 of NPS EN-1. 
5.1.2 
This chapter therefore describes the site selection process followed by APL and the 
key factors that led to the identification of the Project Site, and provides an outline 
of the main generating equipment technologies, layouts and access, and Gas 
Connection and Electrical Connection route options, considered for the Project. 
5.2 
Project Site Selection 
5.2.1 
APL’s site selection process began in 2010 and considered a range of factors, 
including key factors identified in section 2.2 (Factors influencing site selection by 
developers) of NPS EN-2. As recognised by NPS EN-2 (see further Chapter 2: 
Regulatory and Policy Background, Section 2.7), it is for energy companies to 
decide what applications to bring forward and the Government does not seek to 
direct applicants to particular sites. In addition, the specific criteria considered by 
applicants, and the weight they give to them, can and will vary from project to 
project. 
5.2.2 
The process followed by APL included the following main phases, in order to first 
identify a number of potentially feasible sites and thereafter refine this set of sites 
through increasingly detailed selection criteria: 
 
Identification of a large number of potential sites across the UK through existing 
data sources; 
 
Refinement of this set of sites, driven mainly by the need for electrical 
generation capacity to be located as closely as possible to the main sources of 
demand in the UK; 
 
Further refinement based on the layout of the electricity and gas transmission 
networks in the UK, to ensure proximity to these networks; and 
 
Assessment of the remaining sites based on technical, environmental and 
economic factors, as well as consideration of whether or not a proposed Project 
would be in accordance with local planning policy and with the availability of the 
sites.

AECOM 
5-3 
 
5.2.3 
Within the final phase, the key technical considerations included the size of the site 
(i.e. is a sufficient area available to support a power generation plant of up to 299 
MWe and integral infrastructure) as well as any geographical or network-related 
constraints to accessing gas and electricity connections. 
5.2.4 
From an environmental perspective, consideration was given to the proximity of 
sensitive receptors, such as residential properties or sites of ecological importance 
(to avoid unacceptable impacts from noise and visual disturbance), the current 
nature of the surrounding area (to limit impacts on the landscape character of the 
area), previous site uses and land quality (to avoid sterilisation of the best and most 
versatile agricultural land) and proximity to sensitive ecological habitats. 
5.2.5 
The key economic criterion is the proximity of a site to appropriate gas and 
electrical connection points, in order to reduce the cost to the UK consumer and the 
environmental impact of the associated connections. 
5.2.6 
Based on these factors, the Project Site was considered suitable for the following 
main reasons: 
 
It is in close proximity to a suitable electrical connection point; 
 
It is in close proximity to a suitable gas connection point; 
 
The Project Site does not include any nationally important environmental 
designations; 
 
The land available is of an adequate size to accommodate the Power 
Generation Plant, Gas Connection and Electrical Connection; 
 
The Project Site is largely situated on poor quality agricultural land (improved 
grassland classified as Grade 4 agricultural land); 
 
It is in close proximity to similar industrial developments including the Felindre 
Gas Compressor Station and Substation; 
 
The surrounding network is within an area of net electricity import; and 
 
It is in close proximity to a well-developed road network to the Project Site. 
5.2.7 
As a result of the site selection process outlined above, Drax is bringing forward 
three other power generation projects through the PA 2008 process. They are: 
Progress Power Ltd at Eye Airfield in Suffolk (www.progresspower.co.uk): Hirwaun 
Power Ltd at Hirwaun in South Wales (www.hirwaunpower.co.uk): and Millbrook 
Power Ltd in Bedfordshire (www.millbrookpower.co.uk).  The first two projects listed 
received DCOs in July 2015. A DCO application for Millbrook Power Limited was 
submitted to the Secretary of State in October 2017. 
5.3 
Power Generation Plant 
5.3.1 
The following technology options have been considered for the Power Generation 
Plant: OCGT plant; Combined Cycle Gas Turbine (CCGT) plant; Reciprocating Gas 
Engines (RGE) plant and CHP Plant. 
Abergelli ES 2018 – CHAPTER 5: ALTERNATIVES CONSIDERED 
 
Prepared for:  Abergelli Power Limited   
 
AECOM 
5-4 
 
5.3.2 
The operation of OCGT plant has been described previously in Section 3.4. CCGT 
plant consist of the same plant items as OCGT, although they also utilise a heat 
recovery steam generator (HRSG) which uses the waste heat from the exhaust 
gases to produce steam which is used to power a steam turbine. RGE plant are 
similar in operation to a large internal combustion engine, with a crankshaft driven 
by pistons. CHP utilises waste heat from the combustion process to feed to other 
industrial users (deemed off-takers) within the vicinity of the plant. Further 
information is provided in a separate report prepared regarding the use of CHP at 
the Project (Appendix 5.1). 
5.3.3 
OCGT is considered to be the most suitable technology choice for generating up to 
299 MW as a peaking plant and operating at up to 2,250 hours at the Project Site 
based on the following environmental, technical and feasibility considerations: 
 
Visual impact: OCGT plants require shorter stack(s) compared to CCGT plant 
and therefore are less visually intrusive in views from the surrounding 
environment; 
 
Water resources: Since no cooling is required for the condensing of steam, the 
cooling requirements of OCGT plants are significantly lower than, for example, 
CCGT plants. The auxiliary cooling requirements (for lubrication oil, etc.) would 
be met via dry air cooling through the use of fin-fan coolers or Air Cooled 
Condensers (ACC). The water requirement of a OCGT plant is therefore 
significantly lower than for CCGT plants; 
 
Noise and available space: noise levels from an OCGT plant would typically be 
lower than for an RGE plant. A larger number of RGE units would be required 
at the Generating Equipment Site to generate up to 299 MW. Spatially this may 
not be possible; 
 
Financial: based on the anticipated electricity market, it is essential that the 
Power Generation Plant of the size proposed would be particularly cost 
effective, as it would be called upon to operate flexibly to balance out the 
National Grid and meet changing demands of customers; and 
 
Start-up times: OCGT plants are able to start up and shut down much quicker 
than similar sized CCGT plants and are, therefore, better suited to meeting 
variable demands. 
5.3.4 
Uncertain market conditions in 2014 led to the consideration of a number of 
different OCGT technologies and, as such, the 2014 PEIR and associated Phase 1 
consultation process was based on the construction and operation of between 1 
and 5 Gas Turbine Generators. However, greater clarity on the capacity market 
rules, further engagement with the equipment manufacturers, and consultation with 
the local community and relevant stakeholders has led to the decision that a single 
Gas Turbine Generator is the best technology solution for the Project. These 
changes have been consulted on in the 2018 PEIR and are reported on in this ES.

a) Layout 
5.3.5 
The design of an OCGT is dictated by its operational requirements. A limited range 
of site layouts were examined, culminating in the final design of the Project taking 
into account the following constraints: 
 
Avoidance of utilities such as the 1.68 m cast iron Water Main and the oil 
pipeline (which bisect the site under the Gallops), and National Gas 
Transmission System; 
 
Avoidance of landfill to north; 
 
Avoidance of higher topography to the north west which would be more visible 
in key views; 
 
Avoidance of woodland to the East; 
 
Avoidance of solar farms to the north, south, east and west; and 
 
Avoidance of field boundaries, ancient woodland and mature trees as far as 
reasonably possible (being wildlife/ heritage features). 
5.3.6 
The final layout of the Project Site has also been determined by the following main 
factors in relation to each of the components, as discussed below. 
i. 
Generating Equipment 
5.3.7 
The Gas Turbine Generator and stack require the largest area of land-take as 
compared to the other components. It is also best practice for the layout of the 
Generating Equipment Site to make the Generating Equipment easily accessible by 
the operators and maintenance staff from the control and administration building. 
These were key considerations which influenced the siting of the Generating 
Equipment Site.  
5.3.8 
However, the subsequent identification of the Water Main, which crosses the 
Generating Equipment Site and Laydown Area from northwest to southeast (see 
Figure 3.4), has influenced where the Generating Equipment will be located within 
the Generating Equipment Site. The Water Main is owned by Welsh Water, who 
has advised that typically a 30 m buffer (15 m either side of the Water Main) is 
required to be kept clear of construction activities. To accommodate this 
requirement, and to allow for uncertainty over the accuracy and digitisation of 
Welsh Water’s archive drawings, a 60 m allowance has been incorporated in the 
configuration of the Generating Equipment.  
5.3.9 
The location of the Water Main is now known, however further discussions continue 
with Welsh Water to determine whether or not the current 60 m allowance can 
reasonably be reduced. 
Abergelli ES 2018 – CHAPTER 5: ALTERNATIVES CONSIDERED 
 
Prepared for:  Abergelli Power Limited   
 
AECOM 
5-6 
 
5.3.10 The 2017 engineering review of the Project identified that the site for the 
Generating Equipment could be contained in one location instead of being 
separated by the Water Main by staging or raising the ground levels to create 
platforms. By applying the same 60 m allowance to the location of the Water Main 
and as a result of the reduction in gas turbine units to a single turbine unit, it was 
therefore possible to fit the Generating Equipment Site into a single location to the 
north of the gallops, thereby avoiding the requirement for splitting the Generation 
Equipment and increasing the land available for potential Laydown Area and 
Ecological Mitigation Area.  
5.3.11 The Generating Equipment is therefore positioned to the north of the Water Main. 
b) Access  
5.3.12 During Phase 1 statutory consultation, two options were considered for access to 
the Generating Equipment Site. Access Option 1 (so-called as it was identified first) 
would have involved taking access from the north via the Rhyd-y-pandy Road and 
the existing access road west of Brynheulog past Abergelli Farm which would need 
to be extended to the Generating Equipment Site, as shown between the points D 
and C on Figure 5.1. This option involved widening of the existing gravel track to 6 
m and localised upgrades along the Rhyd-y-Pandy Road. The track crosses the 
National Gas Transmission System. It runs parallel to the Water Main but does not 
cross it. 
5.3.13 Subsequently, a second access option, known as Access Option 2, was identified. 
This is from the west via the B4489, along the access road to the Substation and 
Felindre Gas Compressor Station, which will be widened to accommodate the 
abnormal loads required during construction, and then along a new section of 
purpose built access road to be constructed across undeveloped land to the 
Generating Equipment Site as shown between the points A and B on Figure 5.1. 
The purpose built extension from the existing access road to the Generating 
Equipment Site will cross under a 400 kV overhead electrical line, two 
watercourses and a Local Transmission System pipeline. 
5.3.14 Following consultation on the 2014 PEIR, the decision was made to take forward 
Access Option 2. The main reasons for this choice were that the majority of the 
public consulted during 2014 supported Access Option 2 in preference to Access 
Option 1, as it would result in a lower adverse impact on traffic by using a shorter, 
more direct route and would avoid the roads leading to Morriston Hospital. This 
option would also minimise the amount of construction required, as part of the 
access is existing. 
5.3.15 Further investigation and review resulted in the optimisation of the new section of 
access road proposed by Option 2. As a result, within the 2018 PEIR, two options 
(Option A and Option B) were considered for the purpose built new section of 
Access Road from the Substation to the Generating Equipment Site.  
5.3.16 Option A is Option 2 from the 2014 PEIR.  
Abergelli ES 2018 – CHAPTER 5: ALTERNATIVES CONSIDERED 
 
Prepared for:  Abergelli Power Limited   
 
AECOM 
5-7 
 
5.3.17 Option B is detailed in Chapter 3: Project and Site Description and shown on 
Figure 5.1. 
5.3.18 Option B had a number of advantages:  
 
Reduced impact on the day-to-day and major maintenance activities of National 
Grid by avoiding modifications to the existing layout or location of the National 
Grid car park. .   
 
Reduced level of cut and fill required to create the new section of Access Road. 
This is due to the fact that the embankment that borders the southwestern edge 
of the Substation and Felindre Gas Compressor Station has a lesser gradient 
at the point where the new section of Option B begins.  
5.3.19 The key advantage to Option A was its complete avoidance of the Ancient 
Woodland area adjacent to the Substation and Felindre Gas Compressor Station.  
5.3.20 Option B performed better in terms of impacts to National Grid’s current and future 
planned operations, sustainability in relation to materials to be excavated and 
removed, and Project cost. However, consultation feedback in response to the 
2018 PEIR highlighted the importance of avoiding the Ancient Woodland.  
5.3.21 In response to the consultation feedback, APL undertook to realign the route of the 
new section of Access Road associated with Option B. Option B was modified 
(Revised Option B) to curve further south and avoid the area of Ancient Woodland. 
This is now the chosen internal road layout which is presented as Revised Option B 
in Figure 5.1 and Figure 3.3.  
c) Combined Heat and Power (CHP) 
5.3.22 The potential for using CHP opportunities with these technologies was also 
considered (Appendix 5.1). However, it is not technically or economically feasible 
with a peaking power station in this location for the following reasons: 
 
There is no existing regional heat market. From local searches, there are no 
suitable heat users of applicable scale available and none able to accept the 
unpredictable supply of heat available. 
 
The intermittent and peaking modes of operation of OCGT are incompatible 
with the likely continuous demands of heat users. 
 
No potential future heat requirements in the area have been identified and none 
are currently anticipated that would match the irregular operational pattern of a 
peaking plant. 
5.3.23 Given the lack of applicable heat demand as outlined above, it is not considered 
reasonable to seek to make provision for exploiting potential future heat demand. 
5.3.24 Based on the above environmental, technical and feasibility considerations, an 
OCGT is considered to be the most suitable technology choice for generating up to 
299 MW as a peaking plant, operating up to 2,250 hours year and 1,500 running 
hours rolling average over 5 years at the Project Site.

5.4 
Gas Connection 
5.4.1 
A gas connection feasibility study was undertaken in March 2014 to define and 
evaluate the options available for connecting the Generating Equipment to a 
suitable source of fuel gas. This identified Feeder 28 of the National Gas 
Transmission System or a nearby Local Transmission System pipeline as possible 
connection points. The location of these connection points in relation to the Project 
Site is shown on Figure 5.2. 
5.4.2 
Investigations to identify specific route corridor options to the National Gas 
Transmission System or Local Transmission System pipelines within a 
predetermined Gas Connection Opportunity Area (Figure 5.2) were carried out, 
considering in particular the length, the number of crossings required, 
environmental effects and cost. The Gas Connection Opportunity Area was defined 
as a result of a gas feasibility study undertaken by Parsons Brinkerhoff in 2014. 
5.4.3 
The four principal potential connection route options (shown on Figure 5.2) listed 
below were explored further leading to the identification of a single preferred route 
for the Gas Connection. Due regard has been paid to relevant factors including 
environmental, planning, safety, engineering and constructability in selecting the 
preferred route. 
5.4.4 
Route 1 was approximately 1.7 km in length and included: no major road crossings; 
four minor road crossings; no major watercourse crossings; and two minor 
watercourse crossings. This route was a feasible route although it presented some 
major risks in regards to the potential for impacts on protected species and their 
habitats and proximity to the development of a Solar Farm at Abergelli Farm, to the 
west of the National Gas Transmission System. 
5.4.5 
Route 2 was approximately 1.2 km in length and included: no major road crossings; 
one minor road crossing; no major watercourse crossings; and one minor 
watercourse crossing. This route avoids pasture and deciduous woodland which 
have been identified as favourable for protected species. Although this route would 
not be as straight forward as Route 4 to implement, it is more viable than Route 1. 
A major risk remains in the possibility of routeing through the proposed solar farm 
or alongside and parallel to the National Gas Transmission System. Therefore, 
variations to this route were considered as Routes 2a and 2b. Route 2a would 
travel between the National Gas Transmission System and the edge of Abergelli 
Solar Farm and Route 2b as proposed would cross the National Gas Transmission 
System twice. 
5.4.6 
Route 3 was approximately 1.4 km in length and included: no major road crossings; 
one minor road crossing; no major watercourse crossings; and three minor 
watercourse crossings. Route 3 was considered the most viable alternative to 
Route 2. The route crosses the National Gas Transmission System and therefore 
would require the use of the HDD crossing technique. 
Abergelli ES 2018 – CHAPTER 5: ALTERNATIVES CONSIDERED 
 
Prepared for:  Abergelli Power Limited   
 
AECOM 
5-9 
 
5.4.7 
Route 4 was approximately 0.4 km in length and included: no major road crossings; 
no minor road crossings; no major watercourse crossings; and one minor 
watercourse crossing. Route 4 would connect into the Local Transmission System. 
The route would allow little buffer capacity and would require negotiation with 
Wales and West Utilities in regards to their availability of fuel gas capacity. 
5.4.8 
Initially, Route 2 was chosen as the preferred option as it represented the shortest 
distance, whilst avoiding environmental constraints and risks associated with 
crossing the existing National Gas Transmission System. 
5.4.9 
Route 2a, which was the option to route the Pipeline between the solar park and 
the National Gas Transmission System, was also deemed unfeasible following 
discussions with National Grid who are owners of the National Gas Transmission 
System. Proceeding with Route 2a would involve working in close proximity with 
the National Gas Transmission System hence working under very constrained 
conditions over a longer distance compared to Route 2b which crosses the National 
Gas Transmission System at 2 locations over a shorter distance where working 
conditions would be more favourable. 
5.4.10 Consequently Route 2b was chosen as the preferred route for the Gas Connection 
and is therefore the route which has been fully assessed in this ES. Although not 
the shortest route, it has lower risks and avoids ecologically significant habitats, 
such as rough pasture and deciduous woodland which were identified during the 
Phase 1 Habitat Survey (see Appendix 8.1). 
5.5 
Electrical Connection 
5.5.1 
A grid connection assessment was undertaken for the Project in March 2014 in 
order to define and evaluate the options available for connecting the Generating 
Equipment to the NETS for the export of electricity. The Project will connect into a 
Gas Insulated Switchgear (GIS) generator bay within the Substation. APL received 
an offer of a Bilateral Connection Agreement and Construction Agreement from 
NGET on 23 February 2018 (the Connection Agreement) to connect the Generating 
Equipment to the NETS. 
5.5.2 
Both underground cables and overhead lines were initially considered. However, 
underground cables were selected as the preferred option in order to minimise 
visual impact. In the 2014 PEIR, it was noted that the cable would be installed 
beneath the road. It has now been decided that the cable will be laid alongside the 
road for ease of maintenance.

5-10 
 
5.5.3 
The Electrical Connection Opportunity Area (see Figure 5.3), to the south west of 
the Generating Equipment Site, is the area within which the route for the Electrical 
Connection has been identified. In July 2014, the chosen route (as described in 
Section 3.6) was identified during a site walkover of the Electrical Connection 
Opportunity Area. A limited number of route corridor options for the Electrical 
Connection were considered, as the most appropriate option i.e. the shortest, most 
direct route from the Generating Equipment Site to the Substation, requiring the 
least amount of land take and avoiding any statutory designated sites or valued 
habitats, was available (see Figure 5.3). This negated the need to assess any less 
favourable options. 
5.6 
Ecological Mitigation Area 
5.6.1 
An area has been set aside within the Project Site boundary to be available for 
ecological mitigation. The location and area of mitigation required was consulted on 
during Phase 2 consultation, and an outline Landscape and Ecology Mitigation 
Plan (LEMP) was produced. A finalised Landscape and Ecology Mitigation Strategy 
has now been prepared to show the extent of the mitigation required as presented 
in Appendix 3.4.

Introduction
6.1.1
This chapter provides an assessment of the likely air quality effects arising from
construction, operation and decommissioning of the Project. Maintenance is
included within the operational assessment of the Project.
6.1.2
A detailed description of the Project Site and the Project is provided in Chapter 3:
Project and Site Description.  A glossary of terms and list of abbreviations used in
this chapter is provided in Document Reference 1.4.
6.1.3
The effects of the Project have been assessed using a detailed dispersion model to
predict the effects of the proposed operational Open Cycle Gas Turbine (OCGT)
exhaust stack emissions, based on the emission limit values set out in the Industrial
Emissions Directive (IED) (Ref. 6.1).
6.1.4
In addition to air quality effects from the proposed OCGT stack emissions, an
assessment has been undertaken of the potential for dust generation from the
construction phase.
6.1.5
Potential effects on air quality are interrelated with impacts on ecological receptors.
This chapter should be read in conjunction with Chapter 8: Ecology and Chapter
12: Traffic, Transport and Access of this ES.
a)
Objectives of the assessment
6.1.6
The objectives of the assessment were to:
·
Assess impacts during the construction phase of the Project in terms of
construction dust;
·
Determine the appropriate stack height for the Generating Equipment so as to
overcome building downwash effects and minimise off-site air quality impacts;
and
·

Legislation, policy and guidance
b)
National and European Air Quality Legislation and Policy
i.
Local Air Quality Management
6.3.1
The provisions of Part IV of the Environment Act 1995 establish a national
framework for air quality management, which requires all local authorities in
England, Scotland and Wales to conduct local air quality reviews. Section 82(1) of
the Act requires these reviews to include an assessment of the current air quality in
the area and the predicted air quality in future years. Should the reviews indicate
that the objectives prescribed in the Air Quality Strategy (AQS) for England,
Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland (Ref. 6.3) and the Air Quality Standards
(Wales) Regulations 2010 (Ref. 6.3) will not be met, the local authority is required
to designate an Air Quality Management Area (AQMA). Action must then be taken
at a local level to ensure that air quality in the area improves. This process is
known as ‘local air quality management’ or LAQM and the approach to be followed
by Welsh Local Authorities is detailed within the Local Air Quality Management in
Wales Policy Guidance (Ref. 6.4).
ii.
Air Quality Strategy
6.3.2
The AQS identifies nine ambient air pollutants that have the potential to cause harm
to human health, with the exception of ozone which is instead considered to be a
regional problem, and two for the protection of vegetation and ecosystems. The
AQS defines objectives for these pollutants that aim to reduce the impacts of these
pollutants to negligible levels. The objectives are not mandatory but rather policy
intentions made by the UK Government and its Devolved Administrations which set
targets that local authorities should try to achieve.
6.3.3
The current AQS was published in July 2007 and updates the original strategy to
set out new objectives for local authorities in undertaking their local air quality
management duties. The AQS objectives are based on the evidence supporting the
identification of the limit values and, in some instances, objectives in the current
AQS may be more onerous than the limit values set out within the relevant
European Union (EU) Directives and the Air Quality Standards (Wales) Regulations
2010. It is not a specific legal requirement to comply with objectives set within the
AQS except where equivalent limit values are set within the EU Directives and Air
Quality Standards (Wales) Regulations 2010.
iii.
European Air Quality Directives
6.3.4
The Air Quality Framework Directive (96/62/EC) (Ref. 6.5) on ambient air quality
assessment and management defines the policy framework for 12 air pollutants
known to have a harmful effect on human health and the environment. The limit
values for the specific pollutants are set through a series of Daughter Directives.
Abergelli ES 2018 – CHAPTER 6: AIR QUALITY
Prepared for: Abergelli Power Limited
AECOM
6-6
·
Directive 1999/30/EC (the 1st Daughter Directive) sets limit values (values not
to be exceeded) for sulphur dioxide, nitrogen dioxide and oxides of nitrogen,
particulate matter (dust) and lead in ambient air;
·
Directive 2000/69/EC (the 2nd Daughter Directive) establishes limit values for
concentrations of benzene and carbon monoxide in ambient air;
·
Directive 2002/3/EC (the 3rd Daughter Directive) establishes long-term
objectives, target values, an alert threshold and an information threshold for
concentrations of ozone in ambient air;
·
Directive 2004/107/EC (the 4th Daughter Directive) establishes a target value
for the concentration of arsenic, cadmium, nickel and benzo(a)pyrene in
ambient air so as to avoid, prevent or reduce harmful effects of arsenic,
cadmium, nickel and polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons on human health and
the environment as a whole.
6.3.5
The Air Quality Standards (Wales) Regulations 2010 (Ref. 6.3) came into force on
11th June 2010, replacing the previous Air Quality Standards (Wales) Regulations
2007.  The 2010 regulations transpose into national legislation the requirements of
Directive 
2008/50/EC 
and 
Directive 
2004/107/EC. 
Directive 
2008/50/EC
consolidates existing EU air quality legislation apart from the 4th Daughter Directive
and provides a new regulatory framework for PM2.5.
6.3.6
It makes provision under Article 22 for Member States to postpone attainment
deadlines and allow an exemption from the obligation to limit values for certain
pollutants, subject to strict conditions and assessment by the European
Commission.
iv.
Air Quality Objectives and Limit Values
6.3.7
The air quality objectives and limit values currently applying to the UK can therefore
be split into two groups.  Each has a different legal status and is therefore handled
differently within the framework of UK air quality policy. These are:
·
EU limit values transcribed into UK legislation for which compliance is
mandatory; and
·
AQS objectives set down in regulations for the purposes of local air quality
management.
6.3.8
The AQS objectives and EU limit values relevant to this assessment are set out in
Table 6-1 and Table 6-2. It should be noted that while PM10 and PM2.5 are
included in the following tables these are only relevant to construction dust and
road vehicle emission as particulate matter emission from burning natural gas is
considered to be negligible.

Environmental Permitting Regulations
6.3.9
EU Directive 96/61/EC (Ref. 6.7) concerning Integrated Pollution Prevention and
Control (“the IPPC Directive”) applies an integrated environmental approach to the
regulation of certain industrial activities. The Environmental Permitting Regulations
(EPR) 2016 (Ref. 6.8) implement the IPPC Directive relating to installations in
England and Wales. The Regulations define activities that require an Environmental
Permit from NRW.
6.3.10 EPR is a regulatory system that employs an integrated approach to control the
environmental impacts of certain listed industrial activities including the generation
of energy. The intention of the regulatory system is to ensure that Best Available
Techniques (BAT), required by the IPPC Directive, are used to prevent or minimise
the effects of an activity on the environment, having regard to the effects of
emissions to air, land and water via a single permitting process.
6.3.11 To gain a permit, operators have to demonstrate in their applications that the
techniques they are using or are proposing to use are the BAT for their installation
and meet certain other requirements taking account of relevant local factors. The
permitting process also places a duty on the regulating body to ensure that the
requirements of the Industrial Emissions Directive 2010/75/EU (IED) (Ref. 6.1) are
included for permitted sites to which these apply.
6.3.12 The essence of BAT is that the techniques selected to protect the environment
should achieve a high degree of protection of people and the environment taken as
a whole. Indicative BAT standards are laid out in national guidance and where
relevant, should be applied unless a different standard can be justified for a
particular installation. NRW, as the regulating body, is legally obliged to require
more than BAT requirements where EU Air Quality Limit Values may be exceeded
by an existing operator.

6.3.13 The Environment Agency’s
(EA)
“Air emissions risk assessment for your
environmental permit” guidance (Ref. 6.9) (as applied by NRW), sets out the
approach that should be followed when assessing the potential air quality impacts
of a development. This comprises of an initial screening assessment making it
possible to identify emissions that result in “insignificant” impacts and therefore
further assessment is not required.
6.3.14 The EA guidance provides further assessment criteria in the form of EALs. The
EALs are additional assessment criteria outside of those that are set out in the AQS
objectives/limit values and are used for regulatory purposes to assess emissions
that are not under local authority control or receptors, such as ecological sites,
which can cover extensive areas outside of the local authority boundary. Table 6-4
presents the EALs relevant to this assessment.

Critical Loads and Levels for Sensitive Ecological Receptors
6.3.15 The UK is bound by the terms of the European Birds and Habitats Directives (Ref.
6.10) and the Ramsar Convention (Ref. 6.11). The Conservation of Habitats and
Species Regulations 2017 (SI 2017/1012) (Ref. 6.12) provides for the protection of
European sites created under these polices, i.e. Special Areas of Conservation
(SACs) designated pursuant to the Habitats Directive, Special Protection Areas
(SPAs) classified under the Birds Directive, and Ramsar Sites designated as
wetlands of international importance. The
2017
Regulations apply specific
provisions of the European Directives to SACs, SPAs, candidate SACs (cSACs)
and proposed SPAs (pSPAs), which require them to be given special consideration
and further assessment by any development which is likely to lead to a significant
effect upon them.
6.3.16 The impact of emissions from the Generating Equipment on sensitive ecological
receptors are quantified within this assessment in two ways:
·
As direct impacts arising due to
increases in atmospheric pollutant
concentrations; assessed against Critical Levels (i.e. NOx), and
·
Indirect impacts arising through deposition of acids and nutrient nitrogen to the
ground surface, assessed against Critical Loads.
6.3.17 The critical levels for NOx for the protection of vegetation and ecosystems are
30 µg/m3 as an annual mean and 75 µg/m3 as a daily mean.  The critical levels
apply at all relevant ecological areas regardless of habitat type.  These values have
been adopted as the assessment criteria for the impact of the Generating
Equipment on designated nature sites.
Abergelli ES 2018 – CHAPTER 6: AIR QUALITY
Prepared for: Abergelli Power Limited
AECOM
6-10
6.3.18 Critical loads are set to assess the impacts of a development on the ecological
feature of interest in terms of eutrophication (deposition of nutrient nitrogen) and
acidification (deposition of nitrogen and sulphur) and are dependent on the habitat
type and species present, and are specific to the sensitive receptors considered
within the assessment. The critical loads are set out on the Air Pollution Information
System (APIS) website (Ref. 6.13).
6.3.19 Critical loads are set at levels below which significant harmful effects do not occur.
For eutrophication critical loads are given in terms of the mass of nitrogen
deposited per unit area over a year (kgN/ha/yr) and are given as a range e.g. 10-15
kgN/ha/yr.  For acidification the critical load is assessed relevant to a Critical Load
Function (CLF) which assesses the relative contributions of nitrogen and sulphur
and the sensitivity of the habitat in question to each pollutant.
To determine the
CLF the sulphur deposition is plotted vs nitrogen deposition based on the following
three quantities:
·
Maximum critical load for sulphur - CLmax(S);
·
Minimum critical load for nitrogen - CLmin(N); and
·
Maximum critical load for nitrogen - CLmax(N).
6.3.20 Some habitat types are not considered sensitive to eutrophication or acidification
and for these habitats there is no relevant critical load against which contributions
from a development can be assessed.
6.3.21 The APIS website also provides background NOx concentrations and nitrogen/acid
deposition rates for use in assessing the impacts of a development on ecological
sites where the Process Contributions (PC) from the development exceed the
relevant screening criteria.
6.3.22 The critical load criteria adopted for the sensitive ecological receptors considered
by this assessment are presented in the Habitats Regulation Assessment which
accompanies Chapter 8: Ecology.
vii.
Industrial Emission Directive (IED) Emission Limits
6.3.23 The Project will be designed and operated in accordance with the requirements of
the IED, which requires adherence to emission limits for a range of pollutants.
Emission Limit Values (ELVs) are maximum concentrations of residual pollutants
that can be released at source usually from a stack from the Project.  The relevant
ELVs for the Generating Equipment are set out in Annex V Part 2 of the IED. The
IED emission limits applicable to the Project are set out in Table 6-5.

Planning Policy
i.
National Policy Statements
6.3.24 The overarching National Policy Statement for Energy (EN-1) (Ref. 6.14), National
Policy Statement for Fossil Fuel Electricity Generating Infrastructure (EN-2) (Ref.
6.15), National Policy Statement for Gas Supply Infrastructure and Gas and Oil
Pipelines (EN-4) (Ref. 6.16) and National Policy Statement for Electricity Networks
Infrastructure (EN-5) (Ref. 6.17) were adopted by Parliament in July 2011. EN-1
describes the requirements for an air quality assessment for energy and electricity
infrastructure projects and identifies traffic emissions, air pollution, dust and odour
as issues for human health that need to be taken into account in the assessment of
any proposed schemes, along with the effects of nuisance on sensitive receptors.
EN-2 and EN-4 do not set out additional guidance for air quality, referring the
reader back to the overarching guidance and approach set out in EN1. EN-5 does
not specifically reference air quality.
EN-1 specifically references the issue of air
quality, and these are set out below.
6.3.25 Paragraph 5.2.1 states:
6.3.26 “Infrastructure development can have adverse effects on air quality. The
construction, operation and decommissioning phases can involve emissions to air
which could lead to adverse impacts on health, on protected species and habitats,
or on the wider countryside.”
6.3.27 Paragraph 5.2.2 states that:
6.3.28 "the Government has determined that CO2 emissions are not reasons to prohibit
the consenting of projects" and that the "[IPC] does not, therefore, need to assess
individual applications in terms of carbon emissions against carbon budgets and
this section [NPS EN-1, Section 5.2 Air quality and emissions] does not address
CO2 emissions".
6.3.29 Paragraph 5.2.7 states:
6.3.30 “The ES should describe:
·
any significant air emissions, their mitigation and any residual effects
distinguishing between the project stages and taking account of any significant
emissions from any road traffic generated by the project;
·
the predicted absolute emission levels of the proposed project, after mitigation
methods have been applied;

·
existing air quality levels and the relative change in air quality from existing
levels; and
·
Any potential eutrophication impact.”
ii.
Planning Policy Wales
6.3.31 Current land use policies for Wales are set out in Planning Policy Wales (‘PPW’)
(9th Edition, November 2016) (Ref. 6.18).  The policy document is supplemented
by a series of Technical Advice Notes (‘TANs’).  Paragraph 13.12.1 of PPW states
that:
6.3.32 “The potential for pollution affecting the use of land will be a material consideration
in deciding whether to grant planning permission.  Material considerations in
determining applications for potentially polluting development are likely to include:
·
Location, taking into account such considerations as the reasons for selecting
the chosen site itself;
·
Impact on health and amenity;
·
The risk and impact of potential pollution from the development, insofar as this
might have an effect on the use of other land and the surrounding environment
(the environmental regulatory regime may well have an interest in these issues,
particularly if the development would impact on an Air Quality Management
Area or a SAC);
·
Prevention of nuisance;
·
Impact on the road and other transport networks, and in particular on traffic
generation; and
·
The need, where relevant, and feasibility of restoring the land (and water
resources) to standards sufficient for an appropriate after use. (Powers under
the Pollution Prevention and Control Act 1999 require an operator to return a
site to a satisfactory state on surrender of an Integrated Pollution Prevention
and Control Permit).”
iii.
Local Planning Policy – City and County Swansea
6.3.33 City and County Swansea’s (CCS’s) Unitary Development Plan (UDP) (Ref. 6.19),
adopted on 10th November 2008, is the council's most up to date Development
Plan that will be used in the determination of planning applications.
6.3.34 CCS’s UDP includes Policy EV40, which states, “Development proposals will not
be permitted that would cause or result in significant harm to health, local amenity,
natural heritage, the historic environment or landscape character because of
significant levels of air, noise or light pollution” the policy further states that,
“planning permission will not be granted for developments that would cause
significant harm to air quality by virtue of emissions from the development itself or
the additional new traffic movements it would generate.”
Abergelli ES 2018 – CHAPTER 6: AIR QUALITY
Prepared for: Abergelli Power Limited
AECOM
6-13
6.3.35 CCS submitted the Swansea Local Development Plan (LDP) (Ref. 6.20) to the
Ministers of the Welsh Government for independent examination, in 28 July 2017.
If approved and once adopted by CCS, this will replace the UDP.
6.3.36 Section 2.14 of the LDP, Resources and Public Health Protection, re-iterates the
text from CCS’s UDP once more stating that “developments that would result in
significant risk to: life; human health and well-being; property; controlled waters; or
the natural and historic environment, will not be permitted”.
6.3.37 RP 2 of the emerging LDP relates to air, noise and light pollution and states that:
6.3.38 “Where development could lead to exposure to a source of air, noise or light
pollution it must be demonstrated that appropriate mitigation measures will be
implemented, and incorporated into the design of the development to minimise the
effects on future occupants.
6.3.39 ….Pollution may cause significant risk to human health, quality of life, residential
amenity, and the natural and historic environment. This Policy seeks to ensure that
development that would result in significantly high levels of air, noise or light
pollution are appropriately located away from residential areas, other sensitive
developments and areas of landscape, natural environment and heritage
importance. The Policy also seeks to ensure that incompatible development and
land uses are not located close to existing sources of potential pollution.
6.3.40 Where possible planning conditions will be used to minimise environmental harm
and achieve environmental enhancement. The Council will look to the statutory
environmental agencies to use their anti-pollution legislative powers to monitor and
enforce against discharges, noise and other nuisances.”
6.3.41 Section 2.14.11 of Policy RP2 states that in regards to air quality:
6.3.42 “Planning permission will not be granted for development that would cause
significant risk to air quality by virtue of emissions from the development itself or the
additional new traffic movements it would generate. Neither will permission be
granted where a development is proposed that would increase the number of
exposed individuals in an area likely to fail UK air quality objectives (proposed or in
Regulations). This may be a declared Air Quality Management Area (AQMA), or an
area that might become an AQMA if the application were to be granted. The
Swansea Air Quality Management Area (AQMA) 2010 (Nitrogen dioxide (NO2)) is
currently the only AQMA within the County boundary and evidence suggests that
the annual mean objective for NO2 will continue to be exceeded within the AQMA.
The AQMA boundary is shown on the Constraints Map. Monitoring also indicates
areas of exceedances, outside the AQMA, within Mumbles and the City Centre.”
iv.
City and County Swansea Air Quality Action Plan
6.3.43 CCS declared parts of the lower Swansea Valley an AQMA in 2001, for exceedance
of annual mean NO2 objective. The originally declared AQMA was amended in
Abergelli ES 2018 – CHAPTER 6: AIR QUALITY
Prepared for: Abergelli Power Limited
AECOM
6-14
2010 due to further exceedance of NO2 objective occurring within the Sketty and
Fforestfach areas. The latest published Air Quality Progress report for year 2017
(Ref. 6.21) states that the latest monitoring indicates areas of exceedances of the
NO2 annual mean objective outside the current AQMA. Therefore CCS has
proposed to undertake a Detailed Assessment study for an area located within City
Centre.  At the time of writing the results of the Detailed Assessment have not been
published, however given the distance of the Project Site from the City Centre the
impacts of any emissions from the Generating Equipment on any potential AQMA is
anticipated to be negligible.
6.3.44 CCS published the Air Quality Action Plan (AQAP) in 2004 (Ref. 6.22) which
outlined air quality improvement measures for declared AQMA. The AQAP
incorporates work already undertaken by the CCS in the Local Transport Plan and
Unitary Development Plan.
6.4
Methodology
a) Scope of the assessment
6.4.1
The scope of this assessment has been determined through a formal EIA scoping
opinion given by the Secretary of State. Comments raised on the EIA Scoping
Report have been taken into account in the development of the assessment
methodology and these are detailed where relevant in this chapter.  Responses to
the comments raised in the EIA Scoping Opinion can be found in Appendix 4.3 and
Table 6-6.
6.4.2
The approach to the assessment of emissions from the Project will involve the
following key elements:
·
Establish appropriate air quality assessment criteria for the Project in terms of
EU Limit values, AQS objectives and EALs.
·
Establishing the background ambient concentrations of each relevant pollutant.
·
Qualitative assessment of construction phase dust and PM10 emissions in
terms of the Generating Equipment Site, Gas Connection and Electrical
Connection.  The assessment will consider dust nuisance, human health
impacts and ecological impact.
·
Detailed consideration of stack height for the Generating Equipment.
·
Quantitative assessment of the operational effects on local air quality from
stack emissions utilising a “new generation” Gaussian dispersion model
assessed in terms of process contributions (PC) from the site in isolation, and
assessment of resultant predicted environmental concentrations (PEC) taking
into account cumulative impacts through incorporation of the background
concentration. Modelling will consider:
·
For Human Health, NO2 and CO concentrations will be predicted and
compared with the relevant standard.
·
For sensitive ecosystems, concentrations of NOx, and will be modelled along
with nitrogen and acid depositions at the closest sensitive ecological receptor
sites.
Abergelli ES 2018 – CHAPTER 6: AIR QUALITY
Prepared for: Abergelli Power Limited
AECOM
6-15
·
An assessment of the significance of the potential impacts of the development
will be made with reference to appropriate air quality assessment criteria and
critical loads and critical levels set out in the APIS system for ecological
receptors.
6.4.3
The following items have been scoped out of further detailed consideration:
·
Operational emissions from the Gas Connection and Electrical Connection;
·
Construction and operation traffic emissions; and
·
Odour.
i.
Gas Connection and Electrical Connection Operational emissions
6.4.4
There are routine or normal emission to air associated with the operational phase
of either the Gas Connection or the Electrical Connection.  Any emission from the
Gas Connection would be due to a leak/failure of the pipeline and would be
considered to an abnormal event and would be corrected as a matter of urgency.
There are no emissions to air associated with the Electrical Connection. As such
both these operational phases have been scoped out of detailed consideration.
ii.
Traffic Emissions
6.4.5
In order to assess potential traffic impacts during construction, operation,
maintenance and decommissioning the EPUK/IAQM Land-Use guidance (Ref. 6.2)
provides indicative criteria to aid in determining if an air quality assessment is
required.  The IAQM/EPUK guidance states that in terms of road traffic and
assessment is required where the development will:
·
Cause a significant change in Light Duty Vehicle (LDV) traffic flows on local
roads with relevant receptors. (LDV = cars and small vans <3.5 t gross vehicle
weight). A change in LDV flows is considered to be an increase of more than
100 Annual Average Daily Traffic (AADT) movements within or adjacent to an
AQMA or more than 500 AADT elsewhere.
·
Cause a significant change in Heavy Duty Vehicle (HDV) flows on local roads
with relevant receptors. (HDV = goods vehicles + buses >3.5 t gross vehicle
weight). A change in LDV flows is considered to be an increase of more than
25 AADT within or adjacent to an AQMA or more than 100 AADT elsewhere.
·
Realign roads, i.e. changing the proximity of receptors to traffic lanes. Where
the change is 5m or more and the road is within an AQMA.
6.4.6
The Project is located over 5 km from the closest AQMA and is not anticipated to
lead to a change in traffic flows on any roads covered by an AQMA, as such the
factors related to non-AQMA changes are applicable to this assessment.  The
traffic assessment, Chapter 12: Traffic, Transport and Access, sets out predicted
changes in traffic flows associated with the construction, operational and
decommissioning phases of the development.  The predicated increase in LDV and
HDV movements associated with the Project is well below the limits set out in the
EPUK/IAQM guidance.

c) Study Area
6.4.10 The study areas are defined separately for the construction and operational phases
and for the different Project components. Impacts during decommissioning are
considered to mirror construction impacts and the study area is as defined for the
construction phase.
6.4.11 The study area for the assessment of impacts during construction and
decommissioning is defined on the following criteria detailed in the IAQM guidance:
Abergelli ES 2018 – CHAPTER 6: AIR QUALITY
Prepared for: Abergelli Power Limited
AECOM
6-20
·
Human receptors within 350 m of potential dust sources and 50 m of the routes
used by construction vehicles on the public highway; and
·
Ecological receptors within 100 m of potential dust sources and 50 m of the
routes used by construction vehicles on the public highway.
6.4.12 The potential dust sources include areas of specific construction activities, the
routes of the Gas Connection and Electrical Connection, and also roads within 500
m of potential construction works (taken to be the junction of public roads and the
Project Site).
6.4.13 Outside of the construction study area defined above it is reasonable to conclude
that construction impacts will be negligible.
6.4.14 The study area for the assessment of impacts during the operational phase
depends on the receptors being considered.  For ecological sites the EA guidance
“Air emissions risk assessment for your environmental permit” (Ref. 6.9) (as applied
by NRW), requires that air quality impacts are assessed at all special protection
areas (SPAs), special areas of conservation (SACs), Ramsar sites (protected
wetlands) within 10 km of the site. While sites of special scientific interest (SSSIs)
and local nature sites (ancient woods, local wildlife sites and national and local
nature reserves) should only be assessed if within 2 km of the application site.
6.4.15 There are no limits set for the assessment of
human
health, however,
representative receptors have been selected from amongst the closest residential
properties, and these have been discussed with CCS (see Appendix 6.2). In
addition a grid of receptors has been modelled extending 10 km from the Project
Site boundary to assess maximum ground level concentrations.
d) Assessment of Stack Emission Effects
6.4.16 The assessment of emissions from the
Generating Equipment
has been
undertaken using the latest version of Atmospheric Dispersion Modelling System
(ADMS) (V5.2.1.0), supplied by Cambridge Environmental Research Consultants
Limited (CERC) (Ref. 6.23). ADMS is a modern dispersion model that has an
extensive published validation history for use in the UK. This model has been
extensively used throughout the UK to demonstrate regulatory compliance.

Meteorological Data
6.4.18 Hourly sequential data from Cwm Level Park for the years 2012 to 2016 inclusive,
provided by CCS, were used in this study. The station is situated approximately
5 km to the south of the Project Site and is considered to be representative of
meteorological conditions at the point of release.  The Cwm Level Park data was
supplemented with data from the Mumbles Head meteorological station located
approximately 15 km to the south of the Project Site. The Mumbles Head
meteorological station is located on a headland on the far side of Swansea Bay to
the Project Site and, as such, the Cwm Level Park meteorological data is
considered to be much more representative of meteorological conditions on the
Project Site.
6.4.19 A visual representation of the meteorological data used in the assessment is shown
in the wind roses presented in Figure 6.1.
iii.
Terrain
6.4.20 Terrain data has been included within the dispersion modelling.  A site specific
terrain file has been generated for the site which accounts for the final site platform
height, upon which the buildings and stack will be built, with detailed terrain data
used for the area immediately off-site with more distant terrain data derived from
the open OS terrain data off-site.  All terrain files have been generated based on
the maximum sampling resolution allowable within the ADMS terrain file creator of
64x64 points with the model run with a corresponding resolution.

iv.
Surface Roughness
6.4.21 A surface roughness of 0.3 m was used to represent the conditions of the land
surrounding the Project Site and fits the description of the landscape between the
emission points and the closest sensitive receptors. A surface roughness value of
0.5 m was used to represent conditions at the meteorological observation site
which is in a suburban park.
v.
Building Downwash Effects
6.4.22 When wind passes over buildings or other structures, turbulent eddies are formed
in the downwind side of the building. Those eddies can cause a plume from a stack
located within about five times the height of a nearby building or structure to be
forced down to the ground much sooner than it would if a building or structure were
not present. The net effect of such turbulence can be to entrain emissions and to
reduce the effective release height of the emission.
6.4.23 The effect can greatly increase the resulting near-by ground-level pollutant
concentrations downstream of the building or structure.  This phenomenon is
known as building downwash.  Where building heights are greater than about 30%
- 40% of the stack height, downwash effects can be significant.  The buildings that
make up the main structure of the Generating Equipment buildings have therefore
been included within the dispersion model as detailed in Table 6-8 and illustrated in
Figure 6.2, please note that these are indicative dimensions and are based on the
maximum building sizes and as such are considered to be the worst-case.  These
buildings have the greatest influence on air flow across the Project Site and have
the potential to generate turbulence which will effect stack dispersion. The buildings
that have been included within the dispersion modelling are presented in Figure
6.2.
6.4.24 The ADMS buildings effect module has been used to take account of building
downwash effects as part of the modelling procedure.  The air inlet house
(Building 1) has been selected as the main building to effect dispersion as it is the
tallest building on the Project Site. ADMS takes the parameters of the selected
main building and applies this to the other buildings included within the model to
form a single combined structure with the height of the selected main building when
calculating downwash effects.  This, therefore, ensures a conservative approach to
building downwash effects as it treats all the buildings as if they are one large
building for purposes of modelling.

* Indicative dimensions. The land within the Generating Equipment Site is at approximately 90 m AOD and the heights in
the Table 6-8 are measured from this level.
6.4.25 Table 6-8 presents the grid locations of the centres of each modelled buildings
included within the model.  This data is presented only for reference and the exact
buildings centres may differ in practice once constructed within the limits of
deviation being applied for.
The buildings have been modelled relative to each
other and to the stack; as such, any variation on building location will not
significantly alter the results of the modelling as long as the buildings and stack are
built in the same orientations and same relative distances to one another.  Any
changes in predicted pollutant concentrations would be negligible and would fall
within the degree of error associated with the dispersion modelling.
vi.
Modelled Domain
6.4.26 The dispersion model output is reported at specific receptors and as a nested grid
of values. Three separate grid resolutions have been used:
·
A 30 m resolution covering a 1.5 km radius around the Project Site, centred on
the stack location, used for the stack height determination modelled at a height
of 1.5 m. This has been based on ensuring that the grid spacing is 1.5 times
the shortest stack height modelled (1.5 x 20 m = 30 m) and well below the
resolution for the maximum stack height modelled (1.5 x 50 m = 75 m).
·
A 50 m resolution grid covering all ecological areas within 10 km of the Project
Site covering only ecological areas ensure that each ecological site had more
than 2 receptors within it.  Additional receptors were manually added to ensure
that each site was sufficiently represented. Modelled concentrations were at 0
m.
·
A 200 m resolution grid covering a 10 km radius around the Project Site,
centred on the stack location, modelled at a height of 1.5 m and used for
creating contour plots.
6.4.27 Ground-level concentrations of the modelled pollutants relevant to human health
have been predicted at discrete air quality sensitive receptors, detailed in Table 6-9.
The locations of the sensitive human receptors are displayed in Figure 6.3. The
receptors have been selected to be representative of residential dwellings closest
Abergelli ES 2018 – CHAPTER 6: AIR QUALITY

to the Project Site covering each compass direction. For sensitive human
receptors, the flagpole height has been set at 1.5 m.

of nitrogen and sulphur deposition are presented within the Habitats Regulations
Assessment (HRA) will accompany Chapter 8: Ecology and as such are not
repeated within this chapter.
viii. Oxides of nitrogen to nitrogen dioxide conversion
6.4.29 Emissions of NOx from the stack will consist mainly of nitric oxide (NO) at the point
of release. A number of mechanisms are known that result in an increasing
proportion of the oxides of nitrogen being in the form of nitrogen dioxide with
increasing distance from the point of release.
6.4.30 The approach undertaken in the assessment of effects from continuously operating
power plant is to use conversion rates recommended by the Environment Agency’s
Air Quality Modelling and Assessment Unit (Ref. 6.24), which are:
·
to assume 70% of oxides of nitrogen present as NO2 at ground level, plus the
background NO2 concentration in the calculation of long-term annual mean
calculations; and
·
to assume 35% oxides of nitrogen present as NO2 at ground level, plus double
the background NO2 concentration in the calculation of short-term hourly
concentrations.
ix.
Acid and Nitrogen Deposition
6.4.31 The deposition of nitrogen is modelled using a deposition velocity approach, where
the surface flux of pollutants is modelled by multiplying the ground level
concentration by a pollutant specific deposition velocity. The velocity used in the
assessment of nitrogen deposition from NO2 was 1.5 mm/s for short vegetation and
3.0 mm/s for tall vegetation.
6.4.32 For the emissions from the Generating Equipment, only nitrogen deposition need
be considered. Impacts due to emissions of sulphur dioxide and, by inference
deposition of sulphur, have not been assessed as natural gas is an inherently low
sulphur fuel. However, background levels of sulphur deposition are considered in
the assessment of acidification.

6.4.33 Relevant Critical Loads (acid and nitrogen) for each sensitive ecological area are
detailed within the Habitat Risk Assessment which accompanies the Chapter 8:
Ecology and as such are not repeated within this chapter.
x.
Specialised Model Treatments
6.4.34 Emissions have been modelled such that they are not subject to dry and wet
deposition or depleted through chemical reactions. The assumption of continuity of
mass is likely to result in an overestimation of impacts at receptors.
xi.
Realistic Worst Case Scenario for Assessment of Stack Emissions
6.4.35 In accordance with PINS Advice Note 9 (Rochdale Envelope) (Ref. 6.25), the
assessments presented in this ES are based on an assessment of the realistic
'worst case' scenario. This allows flexibility for APL whilst ensuring that the likely
significant environmental effects are identified and adequately assessed. The
realistic worst case scenario is set out in each topic chapter for clarity and
transparency.
6.4.36 Taking the above into consideration, it has been determined that for all topic areas
to be addressed in the EIA apart from socio-economics, a realistic ‘worst case’
scenario from the perspective of environmental effects will be one gas turbine
generator unit. In addition, for all topic areas except air quality and ecology, the
highest stack height (45 m) represents the 'worst case'. For air quality the minimum
stack height (35 m) represent the 'worst case' due to lower dispersion from the
stack. This in turn results in higher predicted ground-level concentrations at both
human health and ecological receptors and predicted levels of nitrogen and acid
deposition at ecological receptors locations.
6.4.37 The Generating Equipment Site is a peaking plant and will therefore only operate
during periods of high power demand.  It is therefore anticipated that the
Generating Equipment will normally operate for 1,500 hours per year, estimated as
a rolling average over 5 years, but may operate for up to a maximum of 2,250
hours per year as a realistic worst-case for any given year.  The maximum number
of hours that the plant can operate will be set out in the site's Environmental Permit
and this operating period cannot be exceeded.
6.4.38 The assessment of impacts takes into account the anticipated maximum operating
hours which the plant will operate under i.e. is based on a realistic worst case.  It is
not possible to specify which hours of the year the plant will operate, the method by
which this is taken into account in the dispersion modelling is dependent on the
metric being assessed i.e. annual, daily, 8-hour or hourly mean concentrations.
6.4.39 The impacts of the Project on short term (8 hours or less) pollutant concentrations
were modelled with the OCGT assumed to be operating at full load continuously for
a whole year. This is appropriate since the UK objectives and EU limit values for
hourly NO2 and 8 hourly CO are based on the 18 highest and highest
concentrations respectively over a year and, with 2,250 hours of operation, it is
Abergelli ES 2018 – CHAPTER 6: AIR QUALITY
Prepared for: Abergelli Power Limited
AECOM
6-27
likely that operations will, at times, coincide with examples of the poorest dispersion
conditions.
6.4.40 In relation to long term (annual mean) concentrations assuming full load operation
for the year will be unrealistic. Therefore, long term impacts were estimated by
scaling the results for continuous full load operation by the likely operating time i.e.
6.4.41
2,250 (maximum hours of operation)
8,760 (total hours in a year)
= 0.257
6.4.42 This approach is appropriate and is based on the assumption that the range of
meteorological conditions under which the generators will operate will, over the
2,250 hours, be statistically similar to those experienced over a year.  The annual
stack contributions have been adjusted when presenting both the impacts at human
health receptors close to the Project Site and for the ecological modelling when
considering annual NOx concentrations and annual nitrogen/acid deposition.  To
ensure a level of conservativeness both the human health and ecological
assessments have been calculated based on the maximum annual concentrations
predicted at each location from the 5 years of meteorological data used in the
modelling.
6.4.43 The assessment of daily mean concentrations, applicable to the ecological
assessment, falls between the cases for long and short-term concentrations.
Nevertheless to ensure a conservative assessment daily mean concentrations are
assessed on the basis of continuous operation.
xii.
Impacts During Start Up and Shut Down
6.4.44 The start-up and shut down periods do not warrant specific assessment for the
Project and impacts during these periods are robustly considered in the
assessment by the assumed 2,250 hours of full load operation for the Plant, i.e.
maximum annual operations rather than the anticipated normal operating hours of
1,500 per year.
6.4.45 The main element of the Generating Equipment is the Gas Turbine Generator. The
OCGT is designed to meet short-term changes in electricity demand and is,
therefore, specifically designed for rapid start up and shut down to benefit for these
short-term changes in demand. Typical start up procedures will take around ten
minutes to complete, and combustion fuel will not be introduced into the system
until two to three minutes of the start-up have elapsed. During the next seven to
eight minutes, fuel will be introduced into the system, first at a low rate and then at
an increasing rate, up to full load operations.
6.4.46 During start up, whilst the concentration of pollutants in the engine exhaust (at
reference conditions) may be higher than under partial or full load operation during
the first few minutes (e.g. minutes two to eight, at <75% load), the pollutant mass
release rate will actually be lower than under full load operations due to the overall
lower flow rates of exhaust gases. The mass release rate (mg/s) is calculated as
the concentration of pollutant (mg/Nm3) times the exhaust gas flow rate (Nm3/s).
Abergelli ES 2018 – CHAPTER 6: AIR QUALITY
Prepared for: Abergelli Power Limited
AECOM
6-28
Furthermore, the concentration of pollutants decreases rapidly as start-up proceeds
and, by around 8 minutes into start up, has decreased to levels equivalent to full
load operations.
6.4.47 In relation to air quality impacts, the mass release rate of pollutants is more
important than the initial exhaust gas concentration of pollutants, since ground level
impacts are proportional to the total mass release. This takes into consideration the
competing effects of lower pollutant mass release rate during start up, but reduced
plume buoyancy at low load (during early start up).
6.4.48 Impacts during start-up are likely to be imperceptibly different from those during full
load operation.  Similar conclusions hold for impacts during the ramping down from
full load operations i.e. emission rates fall as the fuel flow rate is decreased but
impacts of this decrease are countered by the effects of reduced plume buoyancy.
xiii. Demolition and Construction Phase Fugitive Emissions of Particulate Matter
6.4.49 Fugitive emissions (i.e. emissions which are not associated with a single fixed
release point of airborne particulate matter) are readily produced through the action
of abrasive forces on materials and therefore a wide range of demolition and
construction activities have the potential to generate this type of emission (although
not all relevant to this Project), including:
·
Demolition work:
·
Earthworks, including the handling, working and storage of materials;
·
Construction activities; and
·
The transfer of dust-making materials from the Project Site onto the local road
network (Track-out).
6.4.50 Particulate matter in the air is made up of particulates of a variety of sizes, and the
concept of a ‘size fraction’ is used to describe particulates with sizes in a defined
range. These definitions are based on the collection efficiency of specific sampling
methods and each of the size fractions is especially associated with different types
of impacts. In this assessment the term ‘dust’ is used to mean particulate matter in
the size fraction 1 µm – 75 µm in diameter, as defined in BS 6069:1994 (Ref. 2.26).
The size fraction called ‘PM10’ is composed of material with an aerodynamic
diameter of less than 10 µm in diameter and overlaps with the size fraction for dust.
6.4.51 The assessment has been undertaken in accordance with the methodology set out
in the IAQM (Ref. 6.27) guidance. Dust impacts are considered in terms of the
change in airborne concentration and the change in the rate of deposition of dust
onto surfaces. The IAQM adopts a broad definition of dust that includes the
potential for changes in airborne concentration, changes in deposition rates and the
risk to human health and public amenity, when considering the significance of
effects from emissions of fugitive particulate matter. In this assessment, specific
reference is made to the impacts associated with specific size fractions (dust,
PM10), before considering the overall effect on receptors.

6.4.52 For the Project this will include the areas of specific construction associated with
the Generating Equipment Site and also the routes of the Access Road, Gas
Connection and Electrical Connection. Outside of this study area it is reasonable to
conclude that construction impacts will be negligible.
6.4.53 A qualitative assessment has been undertaken to assess the significance of any
effects on sensitive receptors associated with the demolition and construction
phase.
6.4.54 For each activity the following steps are applied with respect to identifying the
potential impacts, before coming to an overall conclusion about the significance of
the effects predicted. The approach to the assessment involves the following
process:
·
Identify the nature, duration and the location of activities being carried out;
·
Establish the risk of significant effects occurring as a result of these activities;
·
Review the proposed or embedded mitigation against good site practice;
·
Identify additional mitigation measures, if necessary, to reduce the risk of a
significant adverse effect occurring at receptors; and
·
Summarise the overall effect of the works with respect to fugitive emissions of
particulate matter and then report the significance of the effects.
6.4.55 The emphasis of the regulation and control of construction dust should be the
adoption of good working practices as standard. Good practice is a process that is
informed by the assessment, which seeks to avoid the potential for adverse effects.
This approach assumes that this environmental management, beyond those
mitigation measures inherent in the proposed design, will be implemented during
works to ensure potential significant adverse effects do not occur.
6.4.56 Examples of accepted good site practice include the IAQM guidance. It has been
assumed that good site practice will be implemented on-site when assessing
potential dust impacts. An outline Construction Environmental Management Plan
(CEMP) has been prepared for the Project (Appendix 4.1) and includes measures
comprising good site practice to avoid or reduce the potential for dust impacts.

6.4.57 According to the IAQM, an assessment will normally be required where there are:
·
Human receptors within 350 m of potential dust sources and 50 m of the routes
used by construction vehicles on the public highway, up to 500 m from the
Project Site entrance; and
·
Ecological receptors within 50 m of potential dust sources and 50 m of the
routes used by construction vehicles on the public highway, up to 500 m from
the Project Site entrance.

6.4.58 The nature of particulate impact for demolition and construction works varies
between different types of receptors based on their sensitivity, as summarised in
Table 6-10 below. Professional judgement is required when assessing sensitivities
as some hi-technology industries and horticultural activities are particularly dust
sensitive.

can be assessed.  These differ dependent on the type of construction activity being

6.4.63 For effects on amenity (including those associated with dust), the aim is to bring
forward a demolition  and construction phase, including mitigation measures if
necessary, that avoids the potential for complaints to be generated as a result of
the Project.
6.4.64 Experience in the UK is that good site practice is capable of mitigating the impact of
fugitive emissions of particulate matter effectively, so that in all but the most
exceptional circumstances, effects at sensitive receptors can be controlled to
ensure that effects are of negligible or minor adverse significance (i.e. ‘not
significant’) (see Table 6-17). This process can be managed through the
implementation of the CEMP (Appendix 3.1).
6.4.65 The scale of the risk of adverse effects occurring due to each type of demolition or
construction activity, with mitigation in place is described using the terms ‘high’,
‘medium’ and ‘low’ risk. The basis for the choice of description is set out for each
activity, comprising demolition, earthworks, construction and track-out, and is
consistent with the IAQM’s Guidance.

6-36
Table 6-17: Descriptors Applied to the Predicted Effects of Fugitive Emissions of Particulate Matter
Risk level
Description
High
A significant effect that is likely to be a material consideration in its own
right.
Medium
A significant effect that may be a material consideration in combination
with other significant effects, but is unlikely to be a material
consideration in its own right.
Low
An effect that is not significant but that may be of local concern.
Negligible
An effect that is not a significant change.
6.4.66 Construction dust effects generally occur when high risk dust generating activities
coincide with adverse meteorological conditions. Therefore, even without
mitigation, any impact would be limited to events that are infrequent and short-term
in nature.
6.4.67 A significant impact can be anticipated should the assessment conclude that the
unmitigated impacts are of medium or high risk, however, only if suitable mitigation
measures are not applied to control dust emissions.  It should be noted that even
sites which are assessed as low risk could lead to significant impacts if appropriate
mitigation is not applied.  Once appropriate dust controls are applied then the
residual impacts of construction dust should be not significant.  On this the IAQM
states, “Once the risk of dust impacts has been determined and the appropriate
dust mitigation measures identified the final step is to determine whether there are
significant effects arising from the construction phase of a proposed development.
For almost all construction activity, the aim should be to prevent significant effects
on receptors through the use of effective mitigation. Experience shows that this is
normally possible. Hence the residual effect will normally be ‘not significant’.”

6.4.68 With regard to stack emissions, the change in pollutant concentrations has been
described at receptors that are representative of exposure to impacts on local air
quality within the study area. For consideration of a change an assessment criteria

Standard or EAL for long term releases;
·
PC <10% of the Environmental Standard or EAL, or the PEC is less than 20%

concentration, for short term releases.
6.4.70 Impacts of the proposed Project have been assessed relative to both the adapted
IAQM/EPUK criteria and EA screening criteria.
Ecological Receptors
6.4.71 For European sites (SPA, SAC or Ramsar sites) an assessment is made as to
whether the installation is “likely to have a significant effect”, and whether this could
lead to an “adverse effect on site integrity”.
6.4.72 For Sites of Special Scientific Interest (SSSIs) the assessment needs to determine
whether the installation is “likely to damage” the SSSI.

6.4.73 The EA’s Risk Assessment guidance (Ref. 6.9) screening criteria for significance of
the emission have been applied to the outcome of the dispersion modelling for both
European and SSSIs. The predicted PCs have been compared with the appropriate
Critical Level to determine the significance of the pollutant emission.
6.4.74 The total pollutant emission is defined in the EA’s Risk Assessment guidance as
being insignificant where:
·
PC <1% of the Critical Level, or the PEC <70% of Critical Level for long term
releases;
·
PC <10% of the Critical Level for short term releases.
6.4.75 For all other nature conservation sites, i.e. LNRs, NNRs, SINCs and ancient
woodlands, the assessment needs to determine whether the installation will result
in “significant pollution” i.e. where Critical Levels are exceeded. Therefore if the
long and short term PC is less than 100% of the relevant Critical Level, it is
considered to be not significant.
6.4.76 The assessment against Critical Loads has been carried out in accordance with
AQTAG06 ‘Technical guidance on detailed modelling approach for an appropriate
assessment for emissions to air’ (Ref. 6.29).  However, it should be noted that this
does not provide definitive advice on interpreting the likely effects on different
habitats of changes in air quality.
6.4.77 As with Critical Levels where process contributions of nitrogen and acid are less
than 1% of the Critical Load impacts can be considered to be insignificant.  Should
PCs be greater than 1% of the critical load then there is the potential for the effects
to be significant, depending upon the context, i.e. sensitivity of the habitat to
acid/nitrogen or other factors such as buffering capacity of the local soils.

Baseline Environment
a)
CCS Air Quality Monitoring and Reporting
6.5.1
A review of existing baseline air quality has been undertaken using information
presented within the CCS Progress Report 2016 (Ref. 6.21), information published
on an official CCS Air Quality website (Ref. 6.30) and Defra website (Ref. 6.31).
6.5.2
There are a number of Continuous Monitoring Stations (CMS) in the administrative
area of CCS. A summary of the monitoring stations and last five years of monitoring
data from each, are presented in Table 6-20 to Table 6-23 CCS agreed the use of
2016 data. The 2017 will generally not be available until mid-2018.

Additionally CCS managed a network of diffusion tube monitoring sites focused on
roadside locations mainly at busy junctions and along narrow and congested roads.
The Project Site is at a rural location and therefore monitoring data from the NO2
diffusion tube network are not considered relevant to inform the air quality baseline
at the Project Site.
b)
Defra Mapped Background Data
6.5.4
A large number of small sources of air pollutants exist, which individually may not
be significant, but collectively, over a large area, need to be considered in the
modelling process.
Pollutant emissions from these sources contribute to
Abergelli ES 2018 – CHAPTER 6: AIR QUALITY

AECOM
6-40
background air quality, which when added to modelled emissions allow estimates of
total ambient pollutant concentrations to be made.
6.5.5
Defra has produced maps of background pollutant concentrations covering the
whole of the UK for use by local authorities and consultants in the completion of
LAQM reports and Air Quality Assessments where local background monitoring is
unavailable or inappropriate for use. The current maps are based on a background
year of 2015 and provide background pollutant concentrations for NO2, PM10 and
PM2.5 for each 1 km grid square within the UK for all years between 2015 and 2030.
Defra also provides historic mapped estimates from 2001 for CO.  While the Defra
mapped backgrounds have not been updated this data is still considered
appropriate to use as it will give an indication of the background concentrations in
the study area, though it is anticipated that these will be conservative. The mapped
Defra NO2, PM10 and PM2.5 concentrations at the Project Site are presented in
Table 6-24 for 2016.

Note: The DEFRA background concentrations were downloaded in November 2017 from the 2015 reference year
background maps.
6.5.7
The available CCS monitoring data are likely to overestimate pollutant
concentrations in the study area since the study area is predominantly rural in
comparison to the more urban nature of Cwm Level Park. The comparison shows
that the Defra mapped values are slightly lower than the monitored background
concentration at Cwm Level Park. However, given the rural nature of the Project
Site it is not considered appropriate to use the Cwm Level Park monitoring to
represent background concentrations to inform the wider study, especially when
considering Sensitive Receptors which are located in rural areas. Background NO2

concentrations in for this study will, therefore, be based on the 2016 mapped Defra
estimates for the relevant grid square in which the receptor is located. The use of
the Defra mapped background data to represent air quality at each modelled
receptor location was agreed in consultation with CCS, as set out in Appendix 6.1.
6.5.8
CCS does not undertake any background monitoring for PM10 or PM2.5.  As such,
background concentrations will be established based on Defra mapped background
concentrations for 2016.
6.6
Embedded Mitigation
6.6.1
As detailed in Chapter 3: Project and Site Description (Section 3.11), a number
of embedded mitigation measures have been identified through the iterative EIA
process and have been incorporated into the design and construction planning of
the Project.
6.6.2
As these mitigation measures have been embedded into the design, are legal
requirements or are standard practices that will be implemented, the assessment of
likely significant effects assumes that they are in place.
6.7
Assessment of Effects
a)
Construction Phase
i.
Generating Equipment Site
6.7.1
The sensitivity of the human receptors to the Generating Equipment Site is classed
as low in terms of both nuisance and health impacts as the closest receptors
(Abergelli Farmhouse and Maes-eglwys) are over 20 m from activities on-site. In
relation to ecology the sensitivity is classed as low as the only ecological sites close
to dust generating activities, Lletty-Morfil SINC and an area of Ancient Woodland,
are locally designated and not considered to be sensitive to dust deposition. PM10
concentrations are at low likelihood of exceedences of the air quality objective in
the area of construction activities are mainly associated with larger particles rather
than fine particles like PM10. Existing PM10 concentrations are well below the
relevant objective and are, therefore, unlikely to be exceeded due to the
construction of the Generating Equipment Site.
6.7.2
There are no existing buildings on the Project Site and, as such, there are no
demolition activities associated with the
construction
phase
of the
Power
Generation Plant (though there will be demolition works required as part of the
decommissioning phase, however this is addressed separately in Section C
Decommissioning (paragraphs 6.7.29 – 6.7.32) below). The dust emission potential
for earthworks during construction of the Generating Equipment Site and new
section of Access Road from the Substation to the Generating Equipment Site is
assessed as being large due to its size. Construction emissions are classed as
medium due to the potential for on-site concrete batching even though the internal
area of the buildings on-site is <25,000 m3 there will also be the need to pour
foundations and other on-site hard standing and as such a conservative approach
Abergelli ES 2018 – CHAPTER 6: AIR QUALITY
Prepared for: Abergelli Power Limited
AECOM
6-42
has been taken that construction volumes will be in the range of 25,000 to 100,000
m3. Emissions from trackout have a large dust magnitude due to the number of
vehicles which may be operating at the Generating Equipment Site.
6.7.3
Table 6-26 sets out the assessment of dust emission class from demolition
activities, earthworks, construction and trackout from the Access Road.

Using the IAQM construction dust assessment criteria the dust emission magnitude
is combined with the distance to and sensitivity of the nearest receptors to assess
the risk of effects associated with the construction phase of the Generating
Equipment Site excluding the benefits of any embedded mitigation already
proposed as part of the CEMP. Table 6-26 shows the risk of effects with no
mitigation is negligible or low in terms of human health, nuisance and ecological
impacts. Impacts are, therefore, anticipated to be not significant, given the low risk
identified and once the embedded mitigation already proposed, as set out in the
CEMP, is taken into account effects are reduced to Negligible.
ii.
Gas Connection
6.7.5
The sensitivity of the human receptors to the Gas Connection is classed as low in
terms of both nuisance and health impacts as the closest receptors (Abergelli
Farmhouse and Maes-eglwys) are over 20 m from activities on-site. In relation to
ecology the sensitivity is classed as low as the only ecological sites close to dust
generating activities, Lletty-Morfil SINC and an area of Ancient Woodland, are
locally designated and not considered to be sensitive to dust deposition.
6.7.6
The dust emission potential for construction of the Gas Connection is assessed as
being large during earthworks due to the size of the corridor affected, which is
approximately 1,400 m long and a maximum of 50 m wide, the number of earth
moving machines that may be required and the volume of material that will be
excavated to form the trench into which the gas pipe will be laid. Construction
emissions are classed as small which is considered to be conservative given the
prefabricated nature of installing the gas pipe. Emissions from trackout have a large
dust potential due to the number of vehicles operating.  There is no demolition
associated with this phase of the works.

Using the IAQM construction dust assessment criteria the dust emission magnitude
is combined with the distance to and sensitivity of the nearest receptors to assess
the risk of effects associated with the construction phase of the Gas Connection
with no mitigation. Table 6-27 shows the risk of effects with no mitigation is
negligible or low in terms of human health, nuisance and ecological impacts.
Impacts are, therefore, anticipated to be not significant, given the low risk identified.
Taking account of embedded mitigation already proposed as part of the outline
CEMP (Appendix 3.1) effects are considered to be Negligible. .
iii.
Electrical Connection
6.7.9
The sensitivity of the human receptors to the Electrical Connection is classed as
low in terms of both nuisance and health impacts as the closest receptors (Abergelli
Farmhouse and Maes-eglwys) are over 20 m from activities on-site. In relation to
ecology the sensitivity is classed as low as the only ecological sites close to dust
generating activities, Lletty-Morfil SINC and an area of Ancient Woodland, are
locally designated and not considered to be sensitive to dust deposition.
6.7.10 The dust emission potential for construction of the Electrical Connection is
assessed as being small during earthworks and construction considering that the
earthworks are confined to small area and construction emissions will be
moderated by the largely prefabricated nature of the installation. Emissions from
trackout have a small dust potential due to the number of vehicles operating and
the fact there will be minimal amount of excavation/trenching needed. There is no
demolition associated with this phase of the works.
6.7.11 Table 6-28 sets out the assessment of dust emission class from demolition
activities, earthworks, construction and trackout as a function of the works
associated with the Electrical Connection.

6.7.12 Using the IAQM construction dust assessment criteria the dust emission magnitude
is combined with the distance to and sensitivity of the nearest receptors to assess
the risk of effects associated with the construction phase of the Electrical
Connection with no mitigation. Table 6-28 shows the risk of effects with no
mitigation is negligible in terms of human health, nuisance and ecological impacts.
Impacts are therefore anticipated to be not significant.
b) Operational Phase
i.
Stack Height Determination
6.7.13 Stack height sensitivity testing was undertaken using meteorological data from
2012 to 2016 with the maximum ground-level concentrations predicted across a
grid of receptors with a model resolution of 30 m.
6.7.14 Dispersion model runs were undertaken for various stack heights between 20 m
and 50 m with the stack height models in 2 m incremental heights. The modelling
demonstrated no significant improvement in ground-level concentrations of NO2
with a stack height greater than 34 m.  As such a minimum stack height of 35 m
has been selected and has been used in all subsequent modelling.  Further details
of the stack height determination process are presented in Appendix 6.2.
ii.
Impacts on Human Health
6.7.15 In this section, the modelled contributions of the Generating Equipment Site are
presented as maximum ground-level concentrations of NO2 and CO at a height of
1.5 m and at the closest sensitive receptors included within the dispersion
modelling also predicted at a height of 1.5 m.
6.7.16 For comparison with the air quality objectives, all hourly concentrations of NO2 are
presented as the 99.79th percentile of hourly mean concentrations. This represents
the 19th highest hourly concentration in the year which takes into account the 18
exceedences of the standard allowed under EU and UK regulations.
6.7.17 Furthermore, the model results are presented as the contribution of the Generating
Equipment Site on its own, termed the Process Contribution (PC), and in
combination with background concentrations, termed the Predicted Environment
Concentration (PEC). All process contributions are modelled with the Generating

Equipment Site operating at full load limited to the maximum annual operations of
2,250 hours.
6.7.18 Table 6-29 presents the maximum predicted impacts anywhere across the grid of
modelled receptor locations taken over the five meteorological years tested (2012
to 2016) for a stack height of 35 m. The data are shown as predicted PC and total
PEC (i.e. PC in addition to Defra mapped background concentrations) for
comparison against the relevant AQS objective.

6.7.19 The results in Table 6-29 show that even based on the maximum predicted
concentrations across the grid of receptors PCs are below 0.2 µg/m3 and as such
can be screened out as negligible in accordance with the adapted IAQM/EPUK
planning guidance and the EA screening criteria.  Despite the PC being well below
1% of the AQS objective Table 6-29 also presents the PEC to illustrated total
annual mean NO2 concentrations and to show that they are also well below the
AQS objective even once the contributions from the Generating Equipment Site are
included.

6.7.21 The results in Table 6-30 show that even based on the maximum predicted
concentrations across the grid of receptors PCs are well below 10% of the hourly
maximum AQS objective of 200 µg/m3 and as such can be screened out as
negligible in accordance with the adapted IAQM/EPUK planning guidance and the
EA screening criteria.  Despite the PC being well below 10% of the AQS objective
Table 6-30 also presents the PEC to illustrated total PECs are also well below the
AQS objective even once the contributions from the Generating Equipment Site are
included. Table 6-31 presents the maximum 8 hour rolling CO impacts anywhere
across the grid of modelled receptor locations taken over the five meteorological
years tested (2012 to 2016) for a stack height of 35 m.

6.7.23 The results in Table 6-31 show that even based on the maximum predicted
concentrations across the grid of receptors PCs are well below 10% of the AQS
objective of 10,000 µg/m3 and, as such, can be screened out as negligible in
accordance with the adapted IAQM/EPUK planning guidance and the EA screening
criteria.  Despite the PC being well below 10% of the AQS objective, Table 6-31
also presents the PEC to illustrated total PECs are also well below the AQS
objective even once the contributions from the Generating Equipment Site are
included.
6.7.24 Contour plots of the process contribution of annual mean NO2, 99.78th percentile
hourly NO2 and the 8 hour rolling CO are provided in Figure 6.4 to Figure 6.6. The
annual and 99.78th percentile contour plots have been prepared using 2015
meteorological data from Cwm Level Park as this gave the highest maximum
ground-level concentrations, while the 8 hour rolling CO contour plot has been
prepared using meteorological data from 2012.
6.7.25 Annual mean and 99.79th Percentile NO2 impacts are concentrated to the north-
east of the stack reflecting the prevailing south-westerly winds in all years, whereas
the rolling eight hour mean CO impacts are concentrated to the north stack.
6.7.26 The maximum impacts of the Project occur away from major roads and urban
areas. It is therefore unlikely that there will be cumulative impacts at either roadside
locations. Likewise, impacts are located to the north east and away from the closest
AQMA which is located approximately 5 km away to the south of the Project Site in
central Swansea.  As such, no impacts are anticipated in the nearest AQMA.
6.7.27 In summary, the magnitude of the impacts on pollutant concentrations are
considered to be negligible for all pollutant and averaging periods considered within
the dispersion modelling. As such, impacts on air quality as a result of the Project
are therefore not considered to be significant.
iii.
Impacts on Ecosystems
6.7.28 The HRA has concluded that no likely significant effects are predicted to occur from
the Project.
c)
Decommissioning
6.7.29 The sensitivity of the human receptors to the Generating Equipment Site is classed
as low in terms of both nuisance and health impacts as the closest receptors
(Abergelli Farmhouse and Maes-eglwys) are over 20 m from activities on-site. In
relation to ecology the sensitivity is classed as low as the only ecological sites close
to dust generating activities, Lletty-Morfil SINC and an area of Ancient Woodland,
are locally designated and not considered to be sensitive to dust deposition. It
should be noted that it is assumed that no additional receptors are introduced
within the assessment area, or new sensitive ecological sites declared prior to the
site being decommissioned.

6.7.30 The decommissioning phase will involve the demolition of the buildings on the
Generating Equipment Site and removal or hardstanding and restoration of the site.
There is no construction associated with the restoration phase.
The emission
potential for demolition of the Generating Equipment Site is assessed as being
Large, i.e. >50,000 m3 of material to be demolished, due to the amount of concrete
used on site,
which has a greater dust potential, .i.e. buildings and
hardstanding/foundations. A
conservative 
approach 
has 
been 
made 
to
decommissioning phase demolition activates taking account for the fact that
construction volumes were conservatively assumed to be between 25,000 and
100,000m3 (medium magnitude).  Emission during earthworks are anticipated to be
large due to the size of the Generating Equipment Site.  It anticipated that the new
section of Access Road from the Substation to the Generating Equipment Site will
not be removed, that the Gas Connection will be closed off but not extracted and
that there will be minimal works required to remove the electrical connection.
Trackout is anticipated to have a large magnitude due to the number of vehicles
anticipated to be operating at the Generating Equipment Site.
6.7.31 Table 6-32 sets out the assessment of dust emission class from demolition
activities, earthworks, construction and trackout from the Access Road (to the west
from the B4489).

6.7.32 Using the IAQM construction dust assessment criteria the dust emission magnitude
is combined with the distance to and sensitivity of the nearest
existing
receptors/designated ecological sites to assess the risk of effects associated with
the decommissioning phase of the Generating Equipment Site excluding the
benefits of any embedded mitigation already proposed as part of the Outline CEMP
(Appendix 3.1). Table 6-32 shows the risk of effects with no mitigation is low to
medium in terms of human health, nuisance and ecological impacts. Taking into
account the embedded mitigation within the Outline CEMP (Appendix 3.1) impacts
are, therefore, anticipated to be Negligible and therefore not significant.  It is
recommended that the construction phase embedded mitigation already proposed,
as set out in the Outline CEMP, is included within the Decommissioning Strategy.

6.8
Mitigation and Monitoring
6.8.1
Embedded mitigation measures, which have been incorporated within the design of
the Project or are standard practice measures that have been committed to are
summarised in Chapter 3: Project and Site Description.
a)
Construction Phase
6.8.2
The construction phase dust assessment concluded that nuisance dust, human
health impacts and ecological impacts will be negligible.  As such no additional
mitigation or monitoring is proposed.
b)
Operation
6.8.3
The air quality assessment has demonstrated that air quality impacts as a result of
the Project are negligible.  As such, no additional mitigation is proposed. Emissions
from the stack will be monitored by a Continuous Emission Monitoring System
(CEMS) which will be required to obtain an Environmental Permit to operate.
c)
Decommissioning Phase
6.8.4
The decommissioning phase dust assessment concluded that nuisance dust,
human health impacts and ecological impacts will be Negligible.  As such no
additional mitigation or monitoring is proposed.
6.9
Residual Effects

The following tables present a summary of the Air Quality assessment. They
identify the receptor/s likely to be impacted, the level of effect and, where the effect

a)
Project ‘“in combination” Effects
6.9.2
The combined impacts from the Generating Equipment Site, Gas Connection and
Electrical Connection upon receptors to air quality are limited to those assets listed
in Tables 6-33 and 6-34, and as such no significant impacts are predicted from the
Project.
6.10
Cumulative and In-Combination Effects
a)
Construction
6.10.1 There are no other permitted or proposed developments within the study area
which may result in any air quality impacts during construction.  As such, no
cumulative construction effects with other project are anticipated.
b)
Operation
6.10.2 There are no other permitted or proposed developments within the study area that
are not currently in operation.  As such, all other large combustion sources are
considered to be accounted for within the background selected for this project. The
results have illustrated the PECs for the Generating Equipment are all within the
relevant AQS objectives and, as such, in combination impacts are considered to be
not significant.
c)
Decommissioning
6.10.3 It is not possible to determine if there will be any other development being
constructed/decommissioned at the same time as the Project is decommissioned,
however, given the remote location it is not anticipated that there will be any other
significant development close to the site that will require decommissioning at the
same time as the Project and if a new development is proposed then this will need
to take account of the decommissioning of the Project as part of the construction
dust risk assessment at that time.

Noise and Vibration
7.1
Introduction
7.1.1
This chapter addresses the potential effects of noise and vibration resulting from
the construction, operation and decommissioning of the Project on local NSRs.
Maintenance is included within the operational assessment of the Project.
7.1.2
A detailed description of the Project Site and the Project is provided in Chapter 3:
Project and Site Description.  A glossary of terms and list of abbreviations used in
this chapter is provided in Document Reference 1.4.
7.1.3
Effects during the construction, operation, maintenance, and decommissioning
periods of the Project are assessed. In particular, the chapter considers potential
effects on identified NSRs in terms of:
·
Predicted noise and vibration levels during the site clearance and construction
works associated with the Project;
·
Qualitative assessment of changes in road traffic noise levels on the local road
network during the construction phase;
·
Predicted noise and vibration resulting from operation of the Project; and
·
Predicted noise and vibration resulting from decommissioning of the Project
based upon those that would be experienced during the construction period.
a)
Objectives of the assessment
7.1.4
The objectives of the assessment are to:
·
Describe the legislative, planning and technical guidance backgrounds related
to noise and vibration from industrial projects;
·
Determine the appropriate noise and vibration assessment method and criteria;
·
Assess the proposed details of the project against these criteria; and
·
Demonstrate the mitigation measures necessary to achieve the criteria.
7.2
Changes since the 2014 PEIR
7.2.1
There have been changes to the design as a result of design evolution and
consultation as detailed in Chapter 3: Project and Site Description since the
2014 PEIR. The 2018 PEIR assessed those design changes based on the previous
baseline noise survey data. To aid the reader, Table 7-1 below outlines the changes
to this assessment compared with the 2014 and 2018 PIER.

assessment.
This was included in response to
Section 42 response comments on the 2018 PEIR
from Natural Resources Wales and the updated
baseline noise data provided by the detailed
survey.

Environmental Protection Act 1990
7.3.7
The Environmental Protection Act 1990 (EPA) Part 3 (Ref. 7.5) states that noise
(and vibration) emitted from premises (including land) so as to be prejudicial to
health or a nuisance constitutes a statutory nuisance.
7.3.8
Local Authorities are required to investigate any public complaints of noise and if
they are satisfied that a statutory nuisance exists, or is likely to occur or recur, they
may serve a noise abatement notice.  A notice is served on the person responsible
for the nuisance.  It requires either simply the abatement of the nuisance or works
to abate the nuisance to be carried out, or it prohibits or restricts the activity.
Contravention of a notice without reasonable excuse is an offence.  Right of appeal
to the Magistrates Court exists within 21 days of the service of a noise abatement
notice.
7.3.9
In determining if a noise complaint amounts to a statutory nuisance the Local
Authority can take account of various guidance documents and existing case law;
no statutory noise limits exist.  Demonstrating the use of ‘Best Practicable Means’
(BPM) to minimise noise levels is considered to be an accepted defence against a
noise abatement notice.
ii.
Control of Pollution Act 1974
7.3.10 Sections 60 and 61 of the Control of Pollution Act 1974 (CoPA) (Ref. 7.6) provide
the main legislation regarding demolition and construction site noise and vibration.
If noise complaints are received, a Section 60 notice may be issued by the Local
Planning Authority with instructions to cease work until specific conditions to reduce
noise have been adopted.
7.3.11 Section 61 of the CoPA provides a means for applying for prior consent to carry out
noise generating activities during construction. Once prior consent has been
agreed under Section 61, a Section 60 notice cannot be served provided the
agreed conditions are maintained on-site.
7.3.12 CoPA requires that BPM (as defined in Section 72 of CoPA) be adopted for
construction noise on any given site. CoPA makes reference to British Standard
(BS) 5228 as BPM.

iii.
Environmental Permitting (England and Wales) Regulations 2016
7.3.13 The Environmental Permitting (England and Wales) Regulations 2016 (Ref. 7.7)
require the application of Best Available Techniques (BAT) to activities performed
within installations regulated by the legislation in order to manage the impact of
these operations on the surrounding environment. This, therefore, just applies to
the operational period, not construction of the Project.
7.3.14 In terms of noise specifically, the selection of BAT will have to be considered and
balanced with releases to different environmental media (air, land, and water) and
to give due consideration to issues such as usage of energy and raw materials.
Noise, therefore, cannot be considered in isolation from other impacts on the
environment.
7.3.15 The definition of pollution includes ‘emissions which may be harmful to human
health or the quality of the environment, cause offence to human senses or impair
or interfere with amenities and other legitimate uses of the environment’ (clause 2).
BAT is therefore likely to be similar, in practice, to the requirements of the Statutory
Nuisance legislation which requires the use of BPM to prevent or minimise noise
nuisance.  In the case of noise, ‘offence of any human senses’ may be judged by
the likelihood of complaints. However, the lack of complaint should not necessarily
imply the absence of a noise problem. In some cases it may be possible, and
desirable, to reduce noise emissions still further at reasonable costs and this may
therefore represent BAT for the control of noise emissions from an installation..
7.3.16 Guidance regarding Environmental Permitting and noise is available in the
Environment Agency’s Integrated Pollution Prevention and Control (IPPC) H3
document ‘Horizontal Guidance for Noise Part 2 - Noise assessment and Control’
(Ref. 7.8). However, ‘Horizontal Guidance for Noise Part 1 – Regulation and
Permitting’ (Ref. 7.9), which provided useful guidance relating to noise limits from
industrial installations in terms of absolute rating levels and rating levels relative to
background noise levels (as defined in BS 4142:1997 (now superseded)) was
withdrawn in February 2016.  Therefore, industry wide noise limits no longer apply.
There is no equivalent Wales specific guidance to these documents, however in
their responses to the 2018 PEIR NRW have not questioned the use of them for the
derivation of noise assessment criteria.
iv.
National Policy Statements
7.3.17 The Overarching National Policy Statement for Energy (NPS EN-1) (Ref. 7.10)
issued by the Department for Energy and Climate Change (as was) sets out
national policy with respect to energy infrastructure.
7.3.18 Section 5.11 of NPS EN-1 sets out the requirements for assessing and mitigating
noise and vibration from nationally significant infrastructure projects NSIPs in the
energy sector. It also sets out the approach the SoS should adopt when
considering noise assessments.
Abergelli ES 2018 – CHAPTER 7: NOISE AND VIBRATION
Prepared for: Abergelli Power Limited
AECOM
7-7
7.3.19 It advises that operational noise from a proposed development and the proximity to
noise sensitive receptors, quiet areas or sites designated for ecological reasons will
determine the likely impact of noise.
7.3.20 Where noise impacts are likely, a noise assessment should be undertaken in line
with details listed in the NPS EN-1.
7.3.21 Operational noise and vibration should be assessed using relevant British
Standards (e.g. BS 4142, BS 6472, BS 8233 and BS 5228) and other guidance,
including the other NPS’s.
7.3.22 NPS EN-1 advises the SoS that the project should:
“Demonstrate good design through selection of the quietest cost-effective plant
available; containment of noise within buildings wherever possible; optimisation of
plant layout to minimise noise emissions; and, where possible, the use of
landscaping, bunds or noise barriers to reduce noise transmission.”
7.3.23 The proposal should meet the following aims before the SoS grants consent:
·
“Avoid significant impacts on health and quality of life from noise,
·
Mitigate and minimise other adverse impacts on health and quality of life from
noise,
·
Where possible, contribute to improvements to health and quality of life through
the effective management and control of noise.”
7.3.24 Paragraphs 5.11.11 to 5.11.13 of NPS EN-1 also set out advice on mitigation and
states:
“5.11.11 The IPC should consider whether mitigation measures are needed both for
operational and construction noise over and above any which may form part of the
project application. In doing so the IPC may wish to impose requirements. Any such
requirements should take account of the guidance set out in Circular 11/95 (see
Section 4.1) or any successor to it.
5.11.12 Mitigation measures may include one or more of the following:
·
Engineering: reduction of noise at point of generation and containment of noise
generated;
·
Lay-out: adequate distance between source and noise-sensitive receptors;
incorporating good design to minimise noise transmission through screening by
natural barriers, or other buildings; and
·
Administrative: restricting activities allowed on the site; specifying acceptable
noise limits; and taking into account seasonality of wildlife in nearby designated
sites.
5.11.13 In certain situations, and only when all other forms of noise mitigation have
been exhausted, it may be appropriate for the IPC to consider requiring noise
mitigation through improved sound insulation to dwellings.”

AECOM
7-8
7.3.25 The National Policy Statement for Gas Supply Infrastructure and Gas and Oil
Pipelines (EN-4) issued by the Department for Energy and Climate Change (as
was) sets out national policy with respect to energy infrastructure.
7.3.26 Paragraphs 2.20.2 to 2.20.4 of EN-4 advise that:
“2.20.2 During the pre-construction phase there could be vibration effects from
seismic surveys. During construction, tasks may include site clearance, soil
movement, ground excavation, tunnelling, trenching, pipe laying and welding, and
ground reinstatement. In addition, increased HGV traffic will be generated on local
roads for the movement of materials. These types of noise and vibration impacts
will need to be assessed.
2.20.3 The commissioning of a new pipeline can involve extensive periods of drying
after hydro-testing, using air compressors, and noise mitigation may be required for
this type of activity.
2.20.4A new gas pipeline may require an above ground installation such as a gas
compression station on the route of the pipeline to boost transmission line
pressure. A new oil pipeline may require pumping stations. These may be located
in quiet rural areas, and therefore the control of noise from these facilities is likely to
be an important consideration.”
7.3.27 Paragraph 2.20.7 of EN-4 also advises on mitigation measures and states:
“2.20.7 Noise mitigation measures for gas and oil pipelines, in particular their
associated above-ground installations, include screening or enclosure of
compressors and pumps. Other measures could include the use of sound
attenuators on ventilation systems, acoustic lagging on pipework, multi-stage
(inherently quiet) control valves, gas turbine exhaust silencers, and high efficiency
low speed cooler fans, depending on the specific issues. Vibration mitigation
measures could include the use of non-impact piling such as augur boring.”
v.
Noise Action Plan for Wales 2013-2018
7.3.28 The Noise Action Plan for Wales (Ref. 7.11) states in Section 1.1 as regards
development:
7.3.29 “The challenge therefore is to take a balanced approach to managing noise which
considers the needs of individuals as well as the requirements of business and
industry, so that our quality of life is not reduced in other ways”.
7.3.30 Section 1.2 of the Noise Action Plan for Wales goes on to state:
7.3.31 “Almost everything that people do creates sound, and noise – unwanted sound – is
to a certain extent an inevitable by-product of life. Yet for the reasons described in
more detail in the sections below, and in the interests of a healthy, fair and
prosperous society, it is important to have a legal and policy framework in place
that:
Abergelli ES 2018 – CHAPTER 7: NOISE AND VIBRATION

AECOM
7-9
·
Protects people and wildlife from unacceptable or harmful levels of noise
intrusion; and
·
Gives everyone access to tranquil places where they can find respite from
man-made sights and sounds.
7.3.32 In Wales, sustainable development means enhancing the economic, social and
environmental wellbeing of people and communities, achieving a better quality of
life for our own and future generations.
7.3.33 The Welsh Government’s vision of a sustainable Wales includes:
·
Healthy, biologically diverse and productive ecosystems that are managed
sustainably; and
·
Communities that are safe, sustainable, and attractive places for people to live
and work, where people have access to services and enjoy good health.”
7.3.34 Guidance on the "need to consider noise when planning a new development, be it
a noise generating or a noise-sensitive" development is set out in Planning Policy
Wales and Technical Advice Note 11 (TAN) as described below:
vi.
Planning Policy Wales (Edition 9, November 2016)
7.3.35 Planning Policy Wales (PPW) (Ref. 7.12) sets out the land use planning policies of
the Welsh Government (WG) and is supplemented by 21 topic based Technical
Advice Notes (TANs);
·
Paragraph 11.1.11: “Formal and informal open green spaces, including parks
with significant recreational or amenity value, should be protected from
development, particularly in urban areas where they fulfil multiple purposes, not
only enhancing the quality of life, but contributing to biodiversity, the
conservation of nature and landscape, air quality and the protection of
groundwater”.
·
Paragraph 13.13.1: “Noise action plans, drawn up by the Welsh Ministers in
relation to Wales under the Environmental Noise Directive and its transposing
Regulations, aim to prevent and reduce environmental noise where necessary
and preserve environmental noise quality where it is good. They are a planning
consideration in the use and development of land”.
·
Paragraph 13.15.2: “Special consideration is required where a noise-generating
development is likely to affect a protected species, or is proposed in or near
statutorily designated areas, including urban quiet areas designated in noise
action plans. The effect of noise on the enjoyment of other areas of landscape,
wildlife and historic value should also be taken into account”.
7.3.36 The policy also requires best practice in construction.
vii.
Technical Advice Note (TAN) 11
7.3.37 Technical Advice Note TAN 11 – Noise (1997) (Ref. 7.13) is a Welsh Government
document that provides guidance on how the planning system can be used to
minimise the adverse impact of noise without placing unreasonable restrictions on
development.
Abergelli ES 2018 – CHAPTER 7: NOISE AND VIBRATION
Prepared for: Abergelli Power Limited
AECOM
7-10
7.3.38 The document talks about general principles in relation to noise and planning, and
provides general guidance on both noise sensitive and noise generative
developments, including draft planning conditions dealing with noise. The main
detailed guidance provided in TAN 11 is the Noise Exposure Categories for new
residential developments.
7.3.39 Some detailed guidance is provided on the assessment of noise from a variety of
sources, but this guidance generally refers to other documents for methods of
assessment and criteria. This guidance has been taken into consideration in this
assessment
7.3.40 The documents makes reference to BS 8233, BS 4142, BS 5228 (Ref. 7.14 to Ref.
7-17).
viii. National Planning Policy Framework
7.3.41 The National Planning Policy Framework (NPPF) was published in March 2012
(Department for Communities and Local Government (DCLG), 2012a) (Ref. 7.18)
and details the Government’s planning policies for England and how these are to
be applied. As such, the NPPF is not directly applicable in Wales but does offer
guidance with a relevance to the Project particularly with reference to the
evaluation of Significant Observable Adverse Effect Level (SOAEL) and Lowest
Observable Adverse Effect Level (LOAEL) levels (see Table 7.2 for further details
on SOAELs and LOAELs).
It is a material consideration in planning decisions
made by local planning authorities in England. In respect of noise, it states:
“The planning system should contribute to and enhance the natural and local
environment by: preventing both new and existing development from contributing to
or being put at unacceptable risk from, or being adversely affected by unacceptable
levels of soil, air, water or noise pollution or land instability…” (paragraph 109)
7.3.42 The NPPF supersedes the previous guidance document PPG 24 ‘Planning and
Noise’ (Ref. 7.12).
7.3.43 The planning system is required to contribute to and enhance the natural and local
environment. Consequently, the aim is to prevent both new and existing
development from contributing to or being put at unacceptable risk from, or being
adversely affected by unacceptable levels of noise pollution.
7.3.44 The NPPF states that planning policies and decisions should aim to:
·
“Avoid noise from giving rise to significant adverse impacts on health and
quality of life as a result of new development;
·
Mitigate and reduce to a minimum other adverse impacts on quality of life
arising from noise from new development, including through the use of
conditions;
·
Recognise that development will often create some noise and existing
businesses wanting to develop in continuance of their business should not
have unreasonable restrictions put on them because of changes in nearby land

uses since they were established [subject to the provisions of the
Environmental Protect Act 1990 and other relevant law]; and
·
Identify and protect areas of tranquillity which have remained relatively
undisturbed by noise and are prized for their recreational and amenity value for
this reason.” (paragraph 123)
ix.
Planning Practice Guidance
7.3.45 In March 2014, Department for Communities and Local Government (DCLG
released its Planning Practice Guidance (PPG) web-based resource to support the
NPPF (Ref. 7.19). The guidance advises that local planning authorities’ should
consider:
Again this document is only strictly applicable to England but does give
useful information on the setting of observable adverse effect levels, as described
in Table 7.2.
·
“Whether or not a significant adverse effect is occurring or likely to occur;
·
Whether or not an adverse effect is occurring or likely to occur; and
·
Whether or not a good standard of amenity can be achieved.”
7.3.46 This guidance uses the additional concepts of NOAEL (No Observed Adverse
Effect Level), and UAEL (Unacceptable Adverse Effect Level). Full details of the
PPG on effects are provided in Table 7-2.
7.3.47 Factors to be considered in determining if noise is a concern are identified including
the absolute noise level of the source, the existing ambient noise climate, time of
day, frequency of occurrence, duration, character of the noise and cumulative
impacts.
7.3.48 With particular regard to mitigating noise impacts on residential development, the
guidance highlights those impacts may be partially off-set if residents have access
to a relatively quiet façade as part of their dwelling or a relatively quiet amenity
space (private, shared or public).

Methodology
a)
Scope of the assessment
7.4.1
The scope of this
assessment has been determined through a formal
Environmental Impact Assessment (EIA) scoping process undertaken to obtain a
formal Scoping Opinion from the Secretary of State. Comments raised on the EIA
Scoping Report have been taken into account in the development of the
assessment methodology and these are detailed where relevant in this chapter.
Responses to the comments raised in the Scoping Opinion can be found in Table
7-4.
7.4.2
The elements of the project scoped out from this assessment are listed in Table
7-3.

Rationale
A detailed
assessment
construction traffic
assessment has
been scoped out
on the basis of
<50 HGVs per day
over the
construction
Phase.
DMRB advises that an increase in road traffic flows of 25% (where the
traffic speed and composition remain consistent) equates to an
increase in road traffic noise of 1 dB LA. A doubling of traffic flow would
be required for an increase in 3 dB LA. As there will be less than 25 %
increase in traffic flows, the impacts will be negligible, and therefore
not significant. No further assessment is deemed necessary. The
actual traffic flows associated with construction for the project are
expected to be below these levels except for a very brief period when
a maximum of 146 movements may occur per day. This will affect
very few receptors for a brief period and will be managed through the
CEMP to minimise impacts when the exact details of the programme

and construction options are known.
As a result a detailed
assessment would add little beneficial information at this stage.

The equipment on the AGI will be restricted to passive pipework with
no pressure reduction valves, water bath heaters or other potential

construction
vibration
In the absence of specific information on likely construction activities
and plant, a qualitative assessment based upon professional
judgement has been undertaken at this stage.  Given the significant
distance to residential receptors, this qualitative judgement made is
that no significant vibration (medium or high magnitude impacts) is
expected to result at residential NSRs from construction and therefore
assessment beyond the qualitative assessment in paras 7.7.22 and
7.7.23 is scoped out.

anticipated. The primary rotating equipment within the generator set
will be balanced to a high degree and constantly monitored for any
changes in the vibration levels it produces.  Therefore, further
assessment of operational vibration has been scoped out of this
assessment.

7.4.6
Key NSR locations have been selected which are considered to be representative
of the nearest and potentially most sensitive existing receptors to the Project Site. It
is considered that if noise and vibration levels are suitably controlled at the key
receptors identified, then noise and vibration levels would be suitably controlled at
other sensitive receptors in the surrounding area, including the amenity of local
footpaths and leisure facilities as the requirements for these will be less onerous.
Impacts upon ecological receptors are considered in the Chapter 8: Ecology.

Assessment of Construction Noise Effects
7.4.9
Before the appointment of a construction contractor, site specific details on the
construction activities, programme and number or type of construction plant are not
yet available. Therefore, detailed construction noise predictions at specific NSRs
have not been undertaken. As stated in the scoping report, a qualitative
assessment will be undertaken, based on review of the indicative worst case
construction noise predictions which were undertaken for a representative project
using the calculation methods set out in BS 5228:2009+A1:2014 ‘Code of practice
for noise and vibration control on construction and open sites' (Ref. 7.16). The
predictions for each phase of the construction will be adjusted to reflect the
distances to the actual receptors at the Project Site.
7.4.10 BS 5228 contains a number of example methodologies for identifying significant
construction noise effects based on fixed thresholds or noise level changes. Taking
into account this guidance the threshold values detailed in Table 7-7 have been
adopted in this ES to define the SOAEL (the ‘significant observed adverse effect
level’, as defined in Section 7.3) and the LOAEL (the ‘lowest observable adverse
effect level’) for residential receptors.

7.4.11 The criterion for the SOAEL at residential receptors corresponds to the threshold
values for Category C in the BS 5228 example ABC method.  Similarly, the criterion
for the LOAEL corresponds to the threshold values for Category A in the BS 5228
example ABC method.  This is in accordance with the NPPF and NPSE which have
been referenced, as stated in the 2018 PEIR as they give more quantitative
information then the Welsh national guidance and give a robust and high standard
of assessment for construction noise levels in keeping with the aims of the Welsh
guidance.  The results have been used to consider receptors that exceed the
LOAEL and propose mitigation to minimise adverse effects.
7.4.12 When considering exceedances of the SOAEL and LOAEL, other project-specific
factors have been taken into account, such as the existing ambient noise levels,
number of receptors affected and the frequency and duration of the impact.
7.4.13 Based upon the above, the magnitude of the impact of construction noise on
residential receptors has been classified in accordance with the descriptions in
Table 7-8.

Assessment of Demolition and Construction Vibration Effects
Effects on Humans – Annoyance
7.4.14 Vibration due to construction activities has the potential to result in adverse impacts
at nearby NSRs. The transmission of ground-borne vibration is highly dependent on
the nature of the intervening ground between the source and receiver and the
activities being undertaken. BS 5228-2: 2009+A1: 2014 ‘Code of Practice for Noise
and Vibration Control on Construction and Open Sites - Vibration’ (Ref 7.17)
Abergelli ES 2018 – CHAPTER 7: NOISE AND VIBRATION
Prepared for: Abergelli Power Limited
AECOM
7-21
provides data on measured levels of vibration for various construction works, with
particular emphasis on piling. Impacts are considered for both damage to buildings
and annoyance to occupiers.
7.4.15 Table 7-9 details Peak Particle Velocity (PPV) vibration levels and provides a
semantic scale for the description of demolition and construction vibration effects
on human receptors, based on guidance contained in BS 5228-2.
Table 7-9: Construction Vibration threshold at Residential Dwellings

Description
Magnitude

>= 10 mm/s
Vibration is likely to be intolerable for any more
than a very brief exposure to this level.
High
1.0 to <
10 mm/s
It is likely that vibration of this level in residential
environments will cause complaint, but can be
tolerated if prior warning and explanation has
been given to residents.
Medium
0.3 to <
1 mm/s
Vibration might be just perceptible in residential
environments.
Low
0.14 to <
0.3 mm/s
Vibration might be just perceptible in the most
sensitive 
situations 
for 
most 
vibration
frequencies
associated with construction. At
lower frequencies, people are less sensitive to
vibration.
Very low
7.4.16 For residential receptors and other high sensitivity receptors, the LOAEL is defined
as a PPV of 0.3 mm/s (millimetres per second), this being the point at which
construction vibration is likely to become perceptible. The SOAEL is defined as a
PPV of 1.0 mm/s, this being the level at which construction vibration can be
tolerated with prior warning.
7.4.17 At receptors above the SOAEL, further consideration of whether an effect is
significant is undertaken using professional judgement, taking account of the
duration and frequency of the effect, as well as the time of evening/night that the
effect would be experienced.
Effects on Buildings
7.4.18 In addition to human annoyance, building structures may be damaged by high
levels of vibration. The levels of vibration that may cause building damage are far in
excess of those that may cause annoyance. Consequently, if vibration levels are
controlled to those relating to annoyance (i.e. 1.0 mm/s), then it is highly unlikely
that buildings will be damaged by construction vibration levels.

AECOM
7-22
7.4.19 The criteria used in this assessment relate to the potential for cosmetic damage,
not structural damage. The principal concern is generally transient vibration, for
example due to piling.
7.4.20 BS 7385-2: 1993 ‘Evaluation and measurement for vibration in buildings – Part 2:
Guide to damage levels from groundborne vibration’ (Ref. 7.23) provides guidance
on vibration levels likely to result in cosmetic damage and is referenced in BS
5228-2: 2009+A1:2014. Guide values for transient vibration, above which cosmetic
damage could occur, are given in Table 7-10.

NOTE 1: Values referred to are at the base of the building.
NOTE 2: For un-reinforced or light framed structures and residential or light
commercial buildings, a maximum displacement of 0.6 mm (zero to peak) is
not to be exceeded
7.4.21 BS 7385-2:1993 states that the probability of building damage tends to zero for
transient vibration levels less than 12.5 mm/s PPV. For continuous vibration, such
as from vibratory rollers, the threshold is around half this value.
7.4.22 It is also noted that these values refer to the likelihood of cosmetic damage. ISO
4866:2010 defines three different categories of building damage:
·
Cosmetic – formation of hairline cracks in plaster or drywall surfaces and in
mortar joints of brick/concrete block constructions;
·
Minor – formation of large cracks or loosening and falling of plaster or drywall
surfaces or cracks through brick/block; and
·
Major – damage to structural elements, cracks in support columns, loosening of
joints, splaying of masonry cracks.
7.4.23 BS 7385-2:1993 defines that minor damage occurs at a vibration level twice that of
cosmetic damage and major damage occurs at a vibration twice that of minor
damage. Therefore, this guidance can be used to define the magnitude of impact
identified in Table 7-11.

Assessment of Operational Noise
7.4.24 The assessment of operational sound levels has been based upon calculations
using plant emissions data available at this stage. The data currently available
includes generating equipment, sound power levels (LW), distance between the
Power Generation Plant and NSRs and the acoustic screening offered by the
existing landscape
7.4.25 Based upon the predicted sound levels, an assessment of potential impact at
nearby NSRs has been undertaken using the guidance in BS 4142: 2014 ‘Methods
for rating and assessing industrial and commercial sound’ (Ref. 7.15) and the WHO
Night time noise guides (Refs. 7.1 and 7.2)
7.4.26 BS 4142 describes methods for rating and assessing sound of an industrial and/or
commercial nature. The method compares the rating sound level with the existing
background sound level.  The standard uses the following definitions to describe
various aspects of the soundscape of the scenario being assessed:
·
Background sound level, LA90,T dB - defined in the Standard as the ‘A-weighted
sound pressure level that is exceeded by the residual sound for 90% of a given
time interval, T, measured using time weighting F and quoted to the nearest
whole number of decibels’.
·
Specific sound level, Ls = LAeq,Tr dB – the ‘sound source at the assessment
location over a given reference time interval, Tr,’.
·
Rating level, LAr,Tr – the ‘specific sound level plus any adjustment made for the
characteristic features of the sound’.
·
Ambient sound level, LAeq,T
dB - defined  in the standard as  ‘the totally
encompassing sound in a given situation at a given time, usually composed of
sound from many sources near and far when present. The ambient sound
comprises the residual sound and the specific sound.’
·
Residual sound level, Lr = LAeq,T
–the ‘Ambient Sound remaining at the
assessment location when the Specific Sound source is suppressed to such a
degree that it does not contribute to the Ambient Sound’.
7.4.27 When assessing a new sound source such as the Generating Equipment it is
important to consider the context of the site and the nature of the existing noise
sources in the area.  The Substation is part of the background sound environment
in the area and the impact of the generators should to be viewed in the context of
Abergelli ES 2018 – CHAPTER 7: NOISE AND VIBRATION
Prepared for: Abergelli Power Limited
AECOM
7-24
that existing environment.
However, it is also necessary to consider the risks of
new sources causing the ambient sound levels in the area to ‘creep’ up.
7.4.28 Whereas the previous version of BS 4142:1997 allowed for a single correction of
+5 dB to be made to the Specific Noise Level if one or more of the distinguishable,
impulsive or irregular features were considered to be present, BS 4142:2014 allows
for corrections to be applied based upon the presence or expected presence of the
following:
·
Tonality: up to +6 dB penalty;
·
Impulsivity: up to +9 dB penalty (this can be summed with tonality penalty); and
·
Other sound characteristics (neither tonal nor impulsive but still distinctive): + 3
dB penalty.
7.4.29 Once any adjustments have been made, the background sound level and the rating
level are compared.  The standard states that:
“Typically, the greater the difference, the greater the magnitude of impact.
A difference of around +10 dB or more is likely to be an indication of a significant
adverse impact, depending upon the context.
A difference of around +5 dB is likely to be an indication of an adverse impact,
depending upon the context.
The lower the rating level is to the measured background sound level, the less
likely it is that the specific sound will have an adverse impact or a significant
adverse impact.  Where the rating level does not exceed the background sound
level, this is an indication of the specific sound source having a low impact,
depending upon the context.” (Section 11)
7.4.30 Importantly, as suggested above, BS 4142:2014 requires that the rating level of the
noise source under assessment be considered in the context of the environment
when defining the overall significance of the impact.
7.4.31 BS 4142:2014 suggests that a one hour assessment period is considered during
the day and a 15-minute assessment period at night.
7.4.32 Table 7-12 illustrates the adopted magnitude of impact scale used in this
assessment based upon the numerical level difference. For BS 4142 assessment
purposes the SOAEL is set at a rating level above the background sound level of
+10 dB, and the LOAEL at +5 dB, although it should be remembered that the
context assessment (including the absolute level of the sound under consideration)
can vary the overall classification of effects.
7.4.33 For reasons that are discussed in the following paragraphs the nature and context
of the site mean that BS 4142 alone would produce an incomplete assessment of
operational noise impacts at night.  As a result it was agreed in discussion with
CCS to include a night time assessment based upon the WHO document Night
Noise Guidelines for Europe (Ref. 7.2). These discussions were held before the
Abergelli ES 2018 – CHAPTER 7: NOISE AND VIBRATION
Prepared for: Abergelli Power Limited
AECOM
7-25
updated noise survey was complete and based on the baseline sound data
available at the time, which was based on very limited measurements.  The
approach was reviewed after the more detailed and representative data provided
by the 2018 survey was available.  It was concluded that, although the 2018 night
time data gave greater validity to a BS 4142 assessment than the previous data the
WHO based method still provided useful additional context to the results.
7.4.34 The Night Noise Guidelines for Europe (Ref. 7.2) build on the earlier WHO
Community Noise Guidelines (Ref. 7.1) and assess the health and sleep effects of
noise experienced by people at night.  It observes that below the level of 30 dB
Lnight, no effects on sleep are observed except for a slight increase in the frequency
of body movements during sleep due to night noise. There is no sufficient evidence
that the biological effects observed at the level below 40 dB Lnight are harmful to
health. However, adverse health effects are observed at the level above 40 dB
Lnight, such as self-reported sleep disturbance, environmental insomnia, and
increased use of sleeping pills and sedatives. Therefore, 40 dB Lnight is equivalent
to the lowest observed adverse effect level (LOAEL) and 30 dB Lnight is equivalent
to the no observable adverse effect level (NOAEL) for night noise.
7.4.35 These values apply to the total ambient sound incident on a dwelling not just to the
contribution from an individual source such as the Project.  For this assessment it
will therefore be necessary to predict the future ambient sound level by adding
together the measured residual sound level and the predicted specific sound level.
However when assessing the impact and effect of a new noise source it is
important to consider the relative contributions of that source compared with other
ambient sources and look at the overall change in levels that the introduction of the
new source creates.
7.4.36 The WHO document recommends that for the prevention of subclinical adverse
health effects related to night noise in the population, it is recommended that the
population should not be exposed to night noise levels greater than 40 dB of
Lnight during the part of the night when most people are in bed. The document also
suggests an interim target (IT) of 55 dB Lnight in the situations where the
achievement of the NOAEL is not feasible in the short run for various reasons.

Effect definitions
7.4.39 Effects are classified based on the magnitude of the impact and the sensitivity or
value of the affected receptor. The criteria for assigning the magnitude of impacts
are outlined for the various potential impacts during construction, operation and
decommissioning, and these are followed by a scale of receptor sensitivity in Table
7-6 and overall classification of effects matrix in Table 7-14.
7.4.40 The following terminology has been used in the assessment to define effects:
·
Adverse – detrimental or negative effects to an environmental resource or
receptor;
·
Neutral – effects to an environmental resource or receptor that are neither
adverse nor beneficial; or
Abergelli ES 2018 – CHAPTER 7: NOISE AND VIBRATION
Prepared for: Abergelli Power Limited
AECOM
7-27
·
Beneficial – advantageous or positive effect to an environmental resource or
receptor.
7.4.41 The effect resulting from each individual potential impact type above is classified
according to the magnitude of the impact and the sensitivity or value of the affected
receptor using the matrix presented in Table 7-14 but where necessary also
considering the context of the acoustic environment.

Baseline Environment
7.5.1
This section describes the baseline environmental characteristics for the Project
and surrounding areas with specific reference to noise and vibration. The baseline
sound levels presented within this report were measured by AECOM in February
2018 and summarised Table 7-15.
7.5.2
The assessment in the 2018 PEIR for the project was based on a survey conducted
for the 2014 PEIR before the current version of BS 4142 (2014) was published.
The methodology of the 2014 version of the standard has different and more
detailed requirements for the acquisition of representative baseline sound than the
previous versions.  As a result the results used in the PEIR would be seen as
unrepresentative in the context of the 2014 version of the standard.  It had always
been the intention to update the baseline data when suitable on site conditions
allowed.
In their comments on the 2018 PEIR, Natural Resources Wales stated
their opinion that updated baseline levels would be required going forward.
7.5.3
For the February 2018 survey, access could only be obtained to four of the six
NSRs. Unattended loggers were installed at NSRs 1, 4, 5 and 6 over a period of six
days and were located within the property boundary of each NSR following prior
agreement with the residents. This was to obtain representative levels at each NSR
meeting the requirements of BS 4142:2014. It was not possible to place loggers at
NSRs 2 and 3, even though attempts were made to locate and contact the
residents both prior to and during the monitoring period. However the four locations
that were used cover the major compass directions from the proposed power plant
site and include the two closest receptors (1 and 6).  Therefore the lack of
Abergelli ES 2018 – CHAPTER 7: NOISE AND VIBRATION

7-28
monitoring data from NSRs 2 and 3 does not impact the comprehensiveness or
validity of the assessments and conclusions on the impacts and effects on NSRs 2
and 3 can be drawn from application of professional judgement to the results for the
other four NSRs.
7.5.4
BS 4142 gives guidance on how a representative background sound level can be
derived from a sound measurement data set such as the six days and nights of five
minute sample data gathered during the survey.
7.5.5
Section 8.1.1 of BS 4142 states that background sound level should be determined
in “weather conditions that are representative or comparable to the weather
conditions when the specific sound occurs”.  The propagation of sound from
outdoor sources is significantly influenced by the weather.  In particular the
propagation down wind of a source can be 10 to 15 dB greater than that upwind.
The prediction methodology used to derive the specific sound level for the
Generating Equipment (based on ISO 9613) assumed downwind conditions for
each receptor.  Therefore the predicted specific sound levels will only occur at each
receptor when that receptor is downwind of the source.  Representative
background sound levels must therefore be measured in similar conditions.
Therefore, for each receptor the data set was filtered so that only measurements
sessions were the average wind direction was within a 120° arc (60°s each side) of
the downwind condition were included for further analysis.
7.5.6
Section 8.1.4 of BS 4142 states that to obtain a representative value the data set
should be analysed statistically and then a judgment made.
It clearly states that
the lowest measured level should not be taken as representative.  Therefore, after
filtering for wind direction as described above the mean and modal values of the
remaining results for each receptor were obtained.  The modal value was selected
as representative for each receptor based on examination of the full, filtered data
set.
7.5.7
Representative background and ambient sound levels are summarised below in
Table 7-15 for each of the four NSRs.

7.5.8
In the absence of the Project, future baseline sound levels at NSRs would depend
largely on traffic flows on surrounding road networks and the future operations at
other industrial and commercial premises in the area.
7.6
Embedded Mitigation
7.6.1
As detailed in Chapter 3: Project and Site Description, a number of embedded
mitigation measures have been identified through the iterative EIA process and
have been incorporated into the design and construction planning of the Project.
7.6.2
As these mitigation measures have been embedded into the design, are legal
requirements or are standard practices that will be implemented, the assessment of
likely significant effects assumes that they are in place.
7.6.3
The preferred approach for controlling construction noise and vibration is to reduce
levels at source where possible, but with due regard to practicality. Sometimes a
greater noise or vibration level may be acceptable if the overall construction time,
and therefore length of disruption, is reduced.
7.6.4
During operation, monitoring is considered appropriate in order to track the success
of delivery of proposed mitigation.  Ideally this monitoring would be based on
regular or fixed measurements close to the Project Site Boundary to give
consistency by minimising the impact of weather and extraneous sources.  The
measured levels at these locations must be calibrated against the levels at the
receptors as part of the plant commissioning sound test procedure.  Any change in
Project Site Boundary levels can then be related directly to changes at the
receptors.
7.7
Assessment of Effects
7.7.1
This section presents the findings of the noise and vibration assessment for the
construction phase, the operational phase and the decommissioning phase of the
Project.
7.7.2
This section identifies any likely significant effects that are predicted to occur and
Section 7.8 highlights the additional mitigation and monitoring measures that are
proposed to reduce or eliminate the identified significant effects if required.
a)
Construction
7.7.3
This section sets out the preliminary assessment of the potential noise and
vibration effects on sensitive receptors arising during the construction period.
Abergelli ES 2018 – CHAPTER 7: NOISE AND VIBRATION
Prepared for: Abergelli Power Limited
AECOM
7-31
7.7.4
Noise levels experienced by local receptors during such works depend upon a
number of variables, the most significant of which are:
·
The noise generated by plant or equipment used on-site, generally expressed
as Sound Power Levels (Lw) or the vibration generated by the plant;
·
The periods of use of the plant on-site, known as its on-time;
·
The distance between the noise/vibration source and the receptor;
·
The noise attenuation due to ground absorption, air absorption and barrier
effects;
·
In some instances, the reflection of noise due to the presence of hard surfaces
such as the sides of buildings; and
·
The time of day or night the works are undertaken.
7.7.5
At this stage, the final construction methods are not confirmed, therefore the worst
case indicative construction noise levels have been based on information from
other technically similar projects provided by the client and taken from published
standards and AECOM archives.
i.
Power Generation Plant
7.7.6
The Residential NSRs are located at a range of distances in different directions
around the Project Site, where the Generating Equipment is to be installed. The
closest residential NSRs are Cefn-betingau, located approximately 500 m to the
east, and Abergelli Farm located approximately 600 m to the north-west of the
Generating Equipment Site.
The construction assessment has been based on
daytime magnitude of impacts as detailed in Table 7-8, as the proposed
construction hours as detailed in Paragraph 3.11.19 fall within these hours.
7.7.7
The predicted levels are given in Table 7-16 below.

The predicted indicative construction noise levels for the Power Generation Plant
are below the LOAEL level in Table 7-7.
Based on Table 7-8 the magnitude of
impact is very low at all NSRs. The sensitivity of all residential receptors is high as
outlined in Table 7-6.  Therefore the significance of effects using the scale in Table
7-14 is predicted to be negligible at all NSRs, and is therefore considered not
significant.

7.7.11 The predicted indicative construction noise levels for the Gas Connection were
below the LOAEL level in Table 7-7, apart from at NSR6 where a level just
exceeding the LOAEL during the day time but significantly below the SOAEL is
predicted. Based on Table 7-8 the magnitude of impact is very low for NSRs 1-5,
and low for NSR6. The sensitivity of all residential receptors is high, as outlined in
Table 7-6. Therefore the significance of effects, using the scale in Table 7-14 is
predicted to be Negligible at NSR1-NSR5 and Minor at NSR6, which is
considered not significant at all NSRs.

7.7.12 The Residential NSR4 and NSR5 are located close to the Electrical Connection.

7.7.14 Predicted indicative construction noise levels for the Substation, cable and
connections were below the LOAEL level in Table 7-7.
Based on Table 7-8 the
magnitude of impact is very low at all NSRs. The sensitivity of all residential
receptors is high, as outlined in Table 7-6. Therefore the significance of effects,
using the scale in Table 7-14 is predicted to be Negligible at all NSRs, and is
therefore considered not significant.
iv.
Project Inter-relationship Effects
7.7.15 The in combination effects of all construction activities taking place simultaneously
on each of the receptors are summarised in Table 7-19 below.

7.7.16 The predicted indicative construction noise levels for three components of the
Project were below the LOAEL level in Table 7-7, apart from at NSR6.  This was
due to a very brief period during construction of the Gas Connection, which passes
within 60 m of that NSR.  As such, the significance of effects is predicted to be
Negligible for the NSRs during the various construction phases.
7.7.17 Based on Table 7-8 the magnitude of impact is very low for NSRs 1-5, and low for
NSR6. The sensitivity of all residential receptors is high, as outlined in Table 7-6.
Therefore the significance of effects, using the scale in Table 7-14 is predicted to be
Negligible at NSR1-NSR5 and Minor at NSR6, which is considered not significant
at all NSRs.
v.
General
7.7.18 It may be necessary for some project critical construction activities, such as
concrete pours, to take place continuously over day, evening and night periods
during peak construction times of the Project, although the exact nature of the
works is unknown. SOAEL and LOAEL threshold values during non-weekday
daytime periods have been defined in Table 7-7.
Abergelli ES 2018 – CHAPTER 7: NOISE AND VIBRATION
Prepared for: Abergelli Power Limited
AECOM
7-34
7.7.19 The predicted daytime noise levels have been compared against the lower limit
values for evening, weekend and night-time periods. Based on Table 7-8 the
magnitude of impact for evening works would be low/very low at all NSRs apart
from NSR6 during gas connection works, when the magnitude of impacts is
predicted to be Medium adverse.  During the night time period, the magnitude of
impacts based on Table 7-8 would be low/ very low at all NSRs apart from NSR6
during gas connection works when the magnitude of impacts is High adverse and
at NSR5 during the electrical substation and connections works. Therefore there is
the potential for Major/Moderate adverse (significant) effects to occur at NSR5
and NSR6 during the evening/ night time periods if the same intensity of working as
for the daytime is assumed.
7.7.20 Therefore, restrictions on construction hours are included as embedded mitigation
in paragraph 3.11.19r.
If construction activities outside these restricted hours
cannot be avoided, these events will be planned, managed and mitigated
appropriately through the CEMP, so as not to exceed the SOAEL threshold values
and reduce levels towards the LOAEL (or less) where practical. Construction
activities outside the hours listed in paragraph 3.11.19 will only occur with the
approval of CCS. Provided the SOAEL threshold values are not exceeded, or are
only exceeded for brief and planned periods, construction activities outside of
normal working hours can be considered as having a Minor adverse effect or less,
and therefore not significant.  Potential measures to ensure that appropriate
mitigation is in place during the works have already been discussed in Section 7.5.
7.7.21 The level of impact at different receptors would be dependent upon a number of
factors, including distance between the works and receptors, ground conditions, the
nature and method of works required close to receptors and the specific activities
being undertaken at any given time.
7.7.22 There are no residential receptors in close proximity to the Project to be
significantly affected by construction vibration. However, there is the potential for
some vibration impacts upon any buildings or structures close to the Project Site.
Whilst it is considered unlikely that most typical construction working routines would
generate levels of vibration above which building damage would be expected to be
sustained (subject to final plant and working requirements).
7.7.23 Where piling, heavy earthworks, vibratory rollers or other significant vibration
producing operations are proposed in close proximity to any existing buildings,
further consideration would be given to potential impacts, once the contractor is
appointed and the construction methods requirements are developed.
It is not
possible at this stage to evaluation what the vibration levels produced might be.
The vibration limits based on the values in Table 7-11 will be included as part of the
CEMP. As the construction of the Project is within the control of the Applicant, any
identified issues can be effectively managed by the Applicant and their
contractor(s).

b)
Operation
7.7.24 The preferred configuration of the Project, including Generating Equipment is yet to
be confirmed but will be within the Rochdale Envelope employed for the Project.
Therefore operational noise modelling has been undertaken for the indicative plant
configuration outlined in Chapter 3: Project and Site Description in order to give
a view of the noise levels that could be produced by the Generating Equipment.
The predictions were undertaken based on all noise sources being located at the
closest part of the Project Site within the Rochdale envelope parameters to each
receptor and with no allowances for source directivity or on-site screening.  This
was to give a worst case within the Rochdale envelope.
7.7.25 Input LW data was either provided by the potential suppliers or has been taken from
AECOMs archive of data for similar installations. The sound power level data was
provided for various source components.  The typical source components included
the following, although there were some minor differences in the data provided by
each supplier:
·
Gas turbine equipment enclosures and buildings
·
Diffuser enclosure;
·
Generator enclosure;
·
Auxiliaries enclosure;
·
Air duct;
·
Air intake inlet;
·
Air intake body;
·
Stack body upstream silencer;
·
Stack body downstream silencer; and
·
Stack outlet.
7.7.26 Discussions were held with potential suppliers and the AECOM database of noise
levels for similar projects was examined in order to identify the levels that can be
achieved by applying the noise control measures, sound power levels for each of
the major sources. Based on that research the following levels were used:
·
A sound power level of 98 dB LWA from the stack in the direction of the
receptors;
·
A total sound power level of 96 dB LWA from the Generating Equipment
enclosures; and
·
A sound power level of 90 dB LWA from the fin fan cooler.
7.7.27 These levels can be achieved by extensive use of the mitigation measures
described in Chapter 3: Project and Site Description during the detailed design.
They therefore represent the application of BAT to the design of the power station
7.7.28 The assessment described sets out the predicted impacts and effects associated
with operation of the Project operating throughout the day and night.  This is the
plant’s anticipated worst case long term operating condition.
7.7.29 The following assumptions have been made when undertaking the operational
noise modelling to give a realistic worst case assessment:
Abergelli ES 2018 – CHAPTER 7: NOISE AND VIBRATION
Prepared for: Abergelli Power Limited
AECOM
7-36
·
The Project would operate any time during the day or night;
·
Noise levels provided by manufacturers for all principal noise emitting
buildings/elements (air inlet filters, electrical buildings, transformers, workshops
etc.) are understood to be external radiated sound power level.
·
Prediction methodologies were based on ISO 9613:2 assuming downwind
propagation to each receptor.  This negates effect of any screening by rolling
ground and means that the sound pressure levels are determined by distance
and air absorption; and
·
Corrections for tonality, impulsivity, and intermittency have not been applied on
the assumption that these potential features would be designed out of the
Project during the detailed design phase by the selection of appropriate plant,
building cladding louvres and silencers/attenuators. However, for the daytime
BS 4142 assessment a +3 dB correction has been applied to the specific noise
levels predicted from the Project Site on the basis that the noise emissions may
be distinctive above the residual acoustic environment.  This is considered
conservative in the context of the prevailing noise environment, which includes
road traffic, the existing electrical infrastructure and agricultural equipment.
7.7.30 It is currently understood that the operation of the Generating Equipment would be
driven by the dynamics of the energy market; as a result the plant could run for
short or longer periods, at any time of day, up to the maximum allowed under its
Environmental Permit.
7.7.31 The predicted free-field operational specific sound levels at the NSRs around the
Project Site are presented in Table 7-20. NSRs 2 and 3 have not been included in
the numerical assessments in Tables 7-20, 7-21 and 7-23 as access could not be
obtained to measure representative background levels at
these locations.
However, the impacts at these receptors have been assessed by applying
professional judgment to the results at NSR1 and NSR4. The conclusions of these
judgment based assessments are discussed in the text.

7.7.32 The nature of the predictions, which allow flexibility of plant location within the
Rochdale Envelope to produce a worst case at each receptor mean that exact
predictions cannot be made at the Project Site Boundary at this time.  However, the
calculations used to predict the levels at the receptors also indicate that the
average level around the site boundary will be around 50 dB LA with a maximum
level of around 55 dB LA.

7.7.33 The BS 4142 assessments results for receptors NSR1, NSR4, NSR5 and NSR6
are presented in Table 7-21.  The values are the differences between the range of
representative background sound level at each NSR and the predicted rating level
(the specific sound level LAeq,T plus a +3 dB correction for a potentially distinctive
character).  Positive values in Table 7-21 indicate an excess of the rating level over
the background sound level and negative levels indicate that the rating level is
lower than the background sound level.

7.7.35 In accordance with Table 7-12 (BS 4142), during the day the values in Table 7-21
produce very low impact magnitudes at all four NSRs for which representative data
could be obtained. This would result in a negligible significance of effect using the
scale in Table 7-14, which would therefore be considered to be not significant.
7.7.36 Examination of the locations of the proposed power plant, receptors and significant
baseline sound sources indicates that the daytime conclusion of a very low impact
would also apply to NSR2 and NSR3, for which baseline data could not be
obtained.
This would result in a Negligible significance of effect, which would
therefore be considered to be not significant.
7.7.37 In accordance with Table 7-12 (BS 4142), during the night the values in Table 7-21
produce very low impact magnitudes at NSR4 and NSR5 and a low impact at
NSR1 and NSR6. This would result in a Negligible significance of effect at NSR4
and NSR5 and a Minor adverse significance of effect at NSR1 and NSR6 using
the scale in Table 7-14, which would therefore be considered not significant.
7.7.38 In accordance with Table 7-13 (WHO), the values in Table 7-22 produce low impact
magnitudes at NSR4, NSR5 and NSR6. This would result in Minor adverse effect
using the scale in Table 7-14, which is therefore considered not significant.
7.7.39 Based on the magnitude criteria in Table 7-13 the ambient sound level at NSR1
after inclusion of the Generation Equipment produces a medium impact magnitude
and therefore a Moderate significance of effect due to the high pre-existing
ambient levels at that location. However the addition of the Generating Equipment
sound causes the ambient level at NSR1 to increase by only 1 dB.  Such an
increase would not be considered to be significant therefore the impact of the
scheme on the sound environment is Negligible. The effect of the operation of the
Generation Equipment is therefore not significant.
7.7.40 Examination of the locations of the proposed power plant, receptors and significant
baseline sound sources indicates that the night time conclusions would also apply
to NSR2 and NSR3, for which baseline data could not be obtained.
This would
result in a Negligible or Minor adverse significance of effect, which would
therefore be considered not significant.

Rochdale Envelope
7.7.41
The noise and vibration assessment has been undertaken with reference to the
Rochdale Envelope (i.e. the maximum parameters for the Project and in particular
its main buildings and structures).  It is estimated that the potential variation in
building locations and dimensions presented in Chapter 3: Project and Site
Abergelli ES 2018 – CHAPTER 7: NOISE AND VIBRATION
Prepared for: Abergelli Power Limited

7-39
Description could result in a variation in predicted levels at the receptors of ± 1 dB
at each location.

* Based on the application of professional judgment to specific details of the site and the quantitative
assessments at NSR1, NSR4, NSR5 and NSR6
7.7.42 The assessment of operational effects is based on the Rochdale Envelope as
defined in Chapter 3: Project and Site Description, which constrains the design
parameters of each element of the Project. As for construction, in any event
mitigation would be integrated into the detailed design, where necessary, in order to
achieve the appropriate noise levels.
7.7.43 The qualitative construction noise assessment was based on the worst-case
assumption of activities occurring at the closest part of the relevant part of the
Project Site to each receptor for each phase of construction.
c)
Decommissioning
7.7.44 At this stage no information is available on the techniques and programme
necessary for decommissioning.
7.7.45 However it is considered that the location, duration and nature of the operations
associated with decommissioning will be similar to those necessary for
construction.  Therefore it is considered that the worst case assessments
presented for the construction would also apply to decommissioning.
7.8
Mitigation and Monitoring
7.8.1
As a general rule, additional mitigation measures have been proposed where a
significant effect is predicted to occur.  Embedded mitigation measures, which have
been incorporated within the design of the Project or are standard practice
measures that have been committed to are summarised in Chapter 3: Project and
Site Description.
a)
Construction
7.8.2
The qualitative assessment predicted that there is the potential for no more than
minor adverse noise effects at residential NSRs during construction works.
Therefore, no further specific mitigation or monitoring measures have been

7-40
identified at this stage. If work is required outside normal working hours, additional
management, controls and mitigation may be required as controlled through the
CEMP.
b)
Operational Noise
7.8.3
The noise assessment has demonstrated that noise effects as a result of the
operation of the Project are not significant, and therefore no further mitigation or
monitoring is proposed.
7.9
Residual Effects
7.9.1
Tables 7-24 and 7-25 present a summary of effects from the noise and vibration
assessment. The tables identifies the receptor/s likely to be impacted, the level of
effect and, where the effect is deemed to be significant. The tables include the
mitigation proposed and the resulting residual effect.

Project ‘“in combination” Effects
7.9.2
The predicted effects of the Project upon receptors to noise and vibration are
limited to the power generation equipment (GT, ancillaries, cooling
equipment, transformers etc.), Electrical Connection and Gas Connection
and as such no significant effects are predicted from the Project.
7.10
Cumulative Effects
7.10.1 No receptors have been identified which could, potentially, experience
cumulative effects
generated by the construction,

Ecology 
8.1 
Introduction 
8.1.1 
This chapter provides an assessment of the likely significant ecological effects 
arising from construction, operation, maintenance and decommissioning of the 
Project. Maintenance is included within the operational assessment of the Project. 
8.1.2 
A detailed description of the Project and Project Site is provided in Chapter 3: 
Project and Site Description. A glossary of terms and list of abbreviations used in 
this chapter is provided in Document Reference 1.4.  
8.1.3 
Potential effects on the valued ecological features are interrelated with effects from 
air quality, noise, water quality, landscape and lighting.  This chapter should be 
read in conjunction with Chapter 6: Air Quality, Chapter 7: Noise and Vibration, 
Chapter 9: Water Quality and Resources, Chapter 11: Landscape and Visual 
Effects and Chapter 17: Cumulative Impacts.  
8.1.4 
Previous ecological surveys have been undertaken by BSG Ecology in 2014 and 
the baseline reports are contained within the Appendices referred to throughout this 
chapter.  It should be noted that the current Project Site Boundary is now smaller 
than the site boundary used by BSG Ecology and Parsons Brinckerhoff.  The 
current Project Site Boundary is fully within the previous site boundary and 
therefore the surveys previously undertaken have captured the current Project Site 
Boundary (Figure 8.1). A summary of the previous reports utilised in this 
assessment is contained within Section 8.4.  
 Objectives of the Assessment 
a)
8.1.5 
The aims of the ecology assessment are to:  
 
Identify relevant ecological features (i.e. designated sites, habitats, species or 
ecosystems) which may be affected; 
 
Provide an objective and transparent assessment of the likely significant 
ecological effects and residual effects of the Project; 
 
Facilitate objective and transparent determination of the effects of the project in 
terms of national, regional and local policies relevant to nature conservation 
and biodiversity; and 
 
Set out what steps would be taken to adhere to legal requirements relating to 
the relevant ecological features concerned.  
8.2 
Changes since the 2014 PEIR 
8.2.1 
There have been changes to the design as a result of design evolution and 
consultation as detailed in Chapter 3: Project and Site Description. To aid the 
reader, Table 8-1 below outlines the changes to this assessment compared with the 
2014 and 2018 PEIR.

Legislation, Policy and Guidance  
8.3.1 
This section identifies and describes legislation, policy and guidance of relevance 
to the assessment of the likely significant ecological effects associated with the 
construction, operation, maintenance and decommissioning of the Project. 
8.3.2 
Legislation and policy has been considered on an international, national, regional 
and local level.  The following is considered to be relevant to the ecological 
assessment as it has influenced the assessment of sensitivity of receptors and 
requirements for mitigation or the scope and/or methodology of the ES. 
a) International and National Legislation 
i. 
Designated Sites and Habitats 
8.3.3 
A variety of sites are designated in the UK, under Conventions, Directives and 
Regulations for their nature conservation importance and interest.  The general aim 
of these designations is to conserve and protect ecological resources, as well as 
raising awareness and understanding.  Other non-statutory sites are afforded some 
Abergelli ES 2018 – CHAPTER 8: ECOLOGY 
 
Prepared for:  Abergelli Power Limited  
AECOM 
8-6 
 
protection through local plans. Table 8.2 outlines the most common statutory and 
non-statutory designations.  
Table 8.2: Summary of relevant legislation with regards to designated sites 
Designation  
Brief Description 
Special Areas of 
Conservation 
(SAC) 
SACs are sites selected to conserve the natural habitat types and 
species of wild flora and fauna listed in the Annexes of the Habitats 
Directive (further information regarding the Habitats Directive is set out 
in more detail in Table 8.3 below).  They are the best areas to 
represent the range and variety of habitats and species within the 
European Union (EU).   
Special Protection 
Area (SPA) 
SPAs are strictly protected sites for the most important habitats for rare 
and migratory birds within the EU classified in accordance with Article 
4 of the Birds Directive information regarding the Birds Directive is set 
out in more detail in Table 8.3 below).   
Ramsar Sites 
Ramsar Sites are wetlands of international importance. Ramsar Sites 
are protected, through the planning system, under the Wildlife and 
Countryside Act 1981 (as amended), and the Countryside and Rights 
of Way Act 2000 through their notification as SSSIs and through other 
regulatory systems addressing water, soil and air quality. 
National 
Nature 
Reserve (NNR) 
NNRs are nationally important areas of wildlife habitat and geological 
formations in Britain.  NNRs are designated and protected under the 
National Parks and Access to the Countryside Act 1949 and the 
Wildlife and Countryside Act 1981 (as amended). They receive 
additional protection under the Countryside and Rights of Way Act 
2000.  They are managed for the benefit of nature conservation. 
Site 
of 
Special 
Scientific Interest 
(SSSI) 
A SSSI is a site of at least national importance for nature conservation 
designated under the Wildlife and Countryside Act 1981 (as amended) 
due to its special interest in terms of flora, fauna or geological or 
physiographical features.  Protection afforded to SSSI’s was 
strengthened by the Countryside and Rights of Way Act 2000.  It 
should be noted that under the Countryside and Rights of Way Act 
2000 owners of SSSIs must give Natural Resources Wales (NRW) 
written notice before they begin any of the operations listed in the 
notification as likely to damage the special interest features, or if they 
allow others to carry out these activities.  None of the listed operations 
can be carried out without NRW’s consent. 
County 
Wildlife 
Site (Local site) 
A County Wildlife Site is a non-statutory site designated by a local 
authority as being of local nature conservation value.  
Ancient Woodland 
Inventory 
Ancient Woodland is a term applied to woodlands which have existed 
from at least Medieval times to the present without ever having been 
cleared for uses other than wood or timber production.  A convenient 
date used to separate ancient and secondary woodland is about the 
year 1600. In special circumstances semi-natural woods of post-1600 
but pre-1900 origin are also included.  
Wildlife Trust 
Reserve 
These non-statutory sites are managed by the Wildlife Trusts with the 
purpose of conserving wildlife.

ii. Species 
8.3.4 
In addition to habitats, a number of species have been afforded protection through 
international/European and national law.  Other species are considered to 
contribute to our ‘quality of life’.  Although these species do not benefit from legal 
protection, they can be material considerations in the planning process.  The 
Countryside and Rights of Way Act 2000, the Wildlife and Countryside Act 1981 (as 
amended), the Protection of Badgers Act 1992 and the Conservation of Habitats 
and Species Regulations 2017 are the main legislative framework for protection of 
wild animals in the UK.  Schedule 1 of the Wildlife and Countryside Act 1981 (as 
amended) covers birds which are protected by special penalties, Schedule 5 covers 
other animals which are protected and Schedule 8 covers plants which are 
protected. 
8.3.5 
Species including bats, otters and great crested newts are listed under Schedule 2 
of the Conservation of Habitats and Species Regulations 2017.  Badgers are 
protected under their own Act: The Protection of Badgers Act 1992.  Activities 
affecting protected species must usually be conducted under licence obtained from 
the appropriate body (in Wales, this is Natural Resources Wales).  
8.3.6 
Developers must be able to show that all reasonable measures have been taken to 
ensure that protected species are not subject to disturbance.  The habitats which 
regularly support the Conservation of Habitats and Species Regulations 
2017Schedule 2 species, the Wildlife and Countryside Act 1981 (as amended) 
Schedule 1 species and some Wildlife and Countryside Act 1981 (as amended) 
Schedule 5 species are also protected from disturbance and destruction. Again, all 
reasonable precautions should be taken to ensure that this does not happen. The 
Countryside and Rights of Way Act 2000 has strengthened enforcement powers 
and introduced a new offence of “reckless disturbance” that applies to both 
protected sites and species. Table 8.3 below provides a summary of the relevant 
legislation with regards to protected and priority species.  
Table 8.3: Summary of relevant legislation with regards to protected and priority species 
Legislation 
Brief Description 
The Habitats Directive 
The Habitats Directive 1992 (Directive 92/43/EEC) sets out the 
legal framework requiring EU member states to protect habitat 
sites supporting vulnerable and protected species, as listed 
within the Directive. The need for an assessment of impacts on 
Natura 2000 sites (the collective name for European designated 
sites, including SPAs and SACs) is set out within Article 6 of the 
Directive. The Directive is transposed into UK law through the 
Conservation of Habitats and Species Regulations 2017 (the 
"Habitats Regulations") and the Wildlife & Countryside Act 1981 
(as amended).  
The Birds Directive 
The Directive on the Conservation of Wild Birds (Directive 
2009/147/EC (the codified version of Council Directive 
79/409/EEC as amended)) provides a framework for the 
protection, management and control of all species of naturally

Brief Description 
occurring wild birds in the European territory of Member States, 
including the UK. The provisions of the Birds Directive are 
transposed into UK law by the Conservation of Habitats and 
Species Regulations, 2017 and the Wildlife & Countryside Act 
1981 (as amended). 
Wildlife and Countryside 
Act 
(1981) 
(as 
amended) 
The Wildlife and Countryside Act 1981 (as amended) is the 
principal mechanism for the legislative protection of wildlife in 
Great Britain. This legislation is the means by which the 
Convention on the Conservation of European Wildlife and 
Natural Habitats (Bern Convention) and (partially) the Birds 
Directive and the Habitats Directive are implemented in the UK.  
The Countryside and Rights of Way Act 2000 has strengthened 
this legal protection (see below).  
A small number of plant species are listed under Schedule 9 of 
the Wildlife and Countryside Act 1981, as amended, which 
includes species such as Japanese knotweed (Fallopia 
japonica), 
Himalayan 
balsam 
(Impatiens 
glandulifera), 
montbretia (Crocosmia x crocosmiiflora), giant hogweed 
(Heracleum mantegazzianum) and some cotoneaster species 
(Cotoneaster sp.).  It is illegal to plant or to cause these plants to 
grow in the wild, and legal disposal methods for vegetation and 
soil subject to disturbance or clearance from a site must be 
used.  
The 
Natural 
Environment and Rural 
Communities Act 2006 
(the NERC Act) 
The Natural Environment and Rural Communities Act (NERC 
Act) provides that any public body or statutory undertaker in 
England and Wales must have regard to the purpose of 
conservation of biological diversity in the exercise of their 
functions. The intention is to help ensure that biodiversity 
becomes an integral consideration in the development of 
policies and plans. 
Convention on Biological 
Diversity 
and 
the 
Countryside and Rights 
of Way Act 2000 
The Countryside and Rights of Way Act 2000 provides a 
statutory framework for biodiversity conservation.  The Act 
places a duty on Government Departments and the National 
Assembly for Wales to have regard for the conservation of 
biodiversity and maintain lists of species and habitats for which 
conservation steps should be taken or promoted, in accordance 
with the Convention on Biological Diversity. 
Schedule 9 of the Act amends SSSI provisions of the Wildlife 
and Countryside Act 1981, including provisions to change SSSIs 
and providing increased powers for their protection and 
management. The provisions extend powers for entering into 
management agreements; place a duty on public bodies to 
further the conservation and enhancement of SSSIs; increases 
penalties on conviction where the provisions are breached; and 
introduce a new offence whereby third parties can be convicted 
for damaging SSSIs.   
Schedule 12 of the Act amends the species provisions of the 
Wildlife and Countryside Act 1981, strengthening the legal

Legislation 
Brief Description 
protection for threatened species. The provisions make certain 
offences 'arrestable' and create a new offence of reckless 
disturbance.  
The UK Biodiversity Action Plan (BAP) was published in 1994, 
and was the UK Government’s response to the Convention on 
Biological Diversity (CBD), which the UK signed up to in 1992. It 
provides the framework for fulfilling the UK’s responsibilities 
towards the Convention on Biological Diversity.  Conservation of 
biodiversity (the variety of life on earth) is an essential element 
of sustainable development.  
Environment 
(Wales) 
Act 2016 
The Environment (Wales) Act puts in place the legislation 
needed to plan and manage Wales’ natural resources in a more 
proactive, sustainable and joined-up way.  Part 1 relates to the 
sustainable management of natural resources.  This ensures 
that the way in which the use of and the impacts on natural 
resources do not result in long term decline.  The aim is to 
sustainably manage natural resources in a way and rate that 
meets the needs of present and current generations without 
compromising the needs of future generations.  
The Act also contains at section 7, a duty for the Welsh 
Ministers to prepare and publish a list of the living organisms 
and types of habitat which in their opinion are of principal 
importance for the purpose of maintaining and enhancing 
biodiversity in relation to Wales. This section replaces the duty 
in section 42 of the NERC Act 2006.  
Protection of Badgers 
Act 1992 
The Protection of Badgers Act 1992 makes it an offence to 
wilfully take, kill, injure or ill-treat a badger, possess a dead 
badger or any part of a badger.  Sett interference includes 
damaging or destroying a sett, obstructing access to a sett, and 
disturbing a badger whilst it is occupying a sett. The Act defines 
a badger sett as ‘any structure or place, which displays signs 
indicating the current use by a badger’ and Natural England 
takes this definition to include seasonally used setts. 
Work that may disturb badgers or their setts is illegal without a 
development licence from the relevant statutory body (in this 
case Natural Resources Wales). 
The 
Hedgerow 
Regulations 1997 
The Hedgerow Regulations (1997) make provision for the 
protection of important hedgerows in England and Wales. The 
regulations affect hedgerows which are 20m or more in length, 
or connected at both ends to another hedgerow of any length. 
They relate to hedgerows which are on, or adjoining land used 
for the following purposes: agriculture or forestry; the breeding 
or keeping of horses, ponies or donkeys; common land; village 
greens; and SSSIs (They do not include hedges that are 
attached to, or marking the boundaries of a private house. 
It is an offence to intentionally or recklessly remove or cause or 
permit another person to remove a hedgerow or intentionally or 
recklessly remove, or cause or permit another person to

b) National Planning Policy 
i. 
National Policy Statements 
National Planning Policy Statement for Energy EN-1 
8.3.7 
Section 5.3 of the Overarching National Policy Statement for Energy (EN-1) (July 
2011) (Ref. 8.1) contains policies relating to biodiversity and geological 
conservation; in this chapter only biodiversity will be considered. 
8.3.8 
Section 4.3 of EN-1 refers to the requirement to consider whether a project is likely 
to have a significant effect on a European site either alone or in combination with 
other plans or projects.  EN-1 requires the EIA for an NSIP to clearly set out "any 
effects on internationally, nationally and locally designated sites of ecological 
importance, on protected species and on habitats and other species identified as 
being of principal importance for the conservation of biodiversity".  
8.3.9 
The NPS sets out policies in relation to each of the following types of designated 
sites of relevance to the Project: 
 
International sites (Ramsar, SAC, SPA (including proposed sites);  
 
SSSIs;  
 
Marine Conservation Zones;  
 
Regional and local sites (e.g. Local Nature Reserves (LNR));  
 
Ancient Woodland and veteran trees;  
 
Biodiversity within developments; and,  
 
Protection of habitats and other species (i.e. species and habitats of principle 
importance nationally, or species and habitats of regional importance.   
International sites 
8.3.10 Section 5.3.9 of EN-1 identifies Ramsar sites as the most important sites for 
biodiversity. Section 5.5.9 states that the applicant should be particularly careful to 
identify any effects of physical changes on the integrity and special features of 
Marine Conservation Zones, candidate SACs, coastal SACs and candidate coastal 
SACs, coastal SPAs and potential coastal SPAs, Ramsar sites, Sites of Community 
Importance (SCIs) and potential SCIs and Sites of Special Scientific Interest. 
Regional and local sites 
8.3.11 Regional and local sites are covered under section 5.3.13 of EN-1 which 
acknowledges the importance of such sites and that the Secretary of State should 
give due consideration to such regional or local designations. However, it goes on 
to state that given the need for new infrastructure, these designations should not be 
used in themselves to refuse development consent. 
 
 
Abergelli ES 2018 – CHAPTER 8: ECOLOGY 
 
Prepared for:  Abergelli Power Limited  
AECOM 
8-11 
 
Ancient Woodland and veteran trees  
8.3.12 Section 5.3.14 of EN-1 sets out that Ancient Woodland is a valuable biodiversity 
resource both for its diversity of species and for its longevity as woodland. It states 
that the Secretary of State should not grant development consent for any 
development that would result in its loss or deterioration unless the benefits 
(including need) of the development, in that location outweigh the loss of the 
woodland habitat. 
Biodiversity within developments 
8.3.13 Section 5.3.15 of EN-1 states that development proposals provide many 
opportunities for building-in beneficial biodiversity or geological features as part of 
good design. When considering proposals, the Secretary of State should maximise 
such opportunities in and around developments, using requirements or planning 
obligations where appropriate. 
Protection of habitats and other species 
8.3.14 Section 5.3.17 of EN-1 sets out that other species and habitats have been identified 
as being of principal importance for the conservation of biodiversity in England and 
Wales and thereby requiring conservation action. The Secretary of State should 
ensure that these species and habitats are protected from the adverse effects of 
development by using requirements or planning obligations. The Secretary of State 
should refuse consent where harm to the habitats or species and their habitats 
would result, unless the benefits (including need) of the development outweigh that 
harm. In this context the Secretary of State should give substantial weight to any 
such harm to the detriment of biodiversity features of national or regional 
importance which it considers may result from a proposed development. 
Mitigation 
8.3.15 The NPS also requires the applicant to demonstrate that its proposals include 
appropriate mitigation measures such as: habitats will, where practicable, be 
restored after construction works have finished; and opportunities will be taken to 
enhance existing habitats and, where practicable, to create new habitats of value 
within the site landscaping.  
8.3.16 Where the applicant cannot demonstrate that appropriate mitigation measures will 
be put in place the Secretary of State should consider what appropriate 
requirements should be attached to any consent and/or planning obligations 
entered into. The Secretary of State will need to take account of what mitigation 
measures may have been agreed.  
ii. Planning Policy Wales (9th Ed. November 2016) 
8.3.17 Planning Policy Wales (PPW) sets out the land use planning policies of Welsh 
Government.  
8.3.18 Chapter 5: Alternatives Considered, Conserving and Improving the Natural 
Heritage and the Coast, outlines Welsh Government’s objectives for the 
Abergelli ES 2018 – CHAPTER 8: ECOLOGY 
 
Prepared for:  Abergelli Power Limited  
AECOM 
8-12 
 
conservation and improvement of natural heritage.  The relevant measures in place 
to conserve landscape and biodiversity include:  
 
Statutory designations; 
 
Non-statutory designations; 
 
LANDMAP Information System (LANDMAP describes and evaluates aspects of 
the landscape and provides the basis of a consistent Wales-wide approach to 
landscape assessment); 
 
Development plans and the conservation and improvement of the natural 
heritage; 
 
Development management and the conservation and improvement of the 
natural heritage; 
 
Development management and statutory designations; 
 
Trees and woods; and, 
 
Protected species.  
8.3.19 Paragraph 5.3.10 states that "potential SPAs and candidate SACs (included in the 
list sent to the European Commission) should be treated in the same way as 
classified SPAs and designated SACs. Sites which the UK and the European 
Commission have agreed as Sites of Community Importance and which are to be 
designated as SACs attract the same legal protection as if they had already been 
designated. The same considerations should, as a matter of policy, be applied to 
listed Ramsar sites". 
8.3.20 Paragraph 5.2.9 states that "Local planning authorities should seek to protect trees, 
groups of trees and areas of woodland where they have natural heritage value or 
contribute to the character or amenity of a particular locality. Ancient and semi-
natural woodlands are irreplaceable habitats of high biodiversity value which should 
be protected from development that would result in significant damage." 
8.3.21 Paragraph 5.5.4 states that "For all planning applications likely to result in 
disturbance or harm to a protected species or likely to have a significant adverse 
effect on sites of more than local importance, or on a designated area, local 
planning authorities should seek the advice of Natural Resources Wales and 
should always consult them before granting permission".  
iii. Technical Advice Note 5 (TAN5) Nature Conservation and Planning 
(September 2009)  
8.3.22 The Planning Policy Wales (PPW) is supplemented by a series of Technical Advice 
Notes. TAN 5 provides guidance on how the land use planning system should 
contribute to protecting and enhancing biodiversity and geological conservation.  It 
provides advice on areas including the key principles of positive planning for nature 
conservation, nature conservation in Local Development Plans and development 
management procedures.  It also provides advice on development affecting 
designated sites and habitats, in addition to protected or priority habitats and 
species.  
8.3.23 Key Principles include that the town and country planning system in Wales should 
integrate nature conservation into all planning decisions; that the town and country 
Abergelli ES 2018 – CHAPTER 8: ECOLOGY 
 
Prepared for:  Abergelli Power Limited  
AECOM 
8-13 
 
planning system should look for development to provide a net benefit for 
biodiversity conservation with no significant loss of habitats or populations of 
species, locally or nationally and that they should ensure that the UK’s international 
and national obligations for site, species and habitat protection are fully met in all 
planning decisions.  
c) Local Development Plans 
8.3.24 Local Development Plans (LDPs) must be produced by every Local Planning 
Authority in Wales.  Any development proposal will be tested against the policies 
within the LDP.  The LDPs follow the planning guidance provide in PPW, including 
biodiversity and natural heritage policies.  These include protecting designated 
sites and other areas of importance for biodiversity conservation; safeguarding 
protected species and priority species, including those listed in local biodiversity 
action plans and retaining, creating and enhancing features of importance for 
biodiversity conservation where appropriate.  
8.3.25 Relevant local planning policies for CCS are detailed in the adopted City and 
County of Swansea Unitary Development Plan.  
8.3.26 Table 8-4 provides a summary of relevant local planning policies set out in the City 
and County of Swansea Unitary Development Plan.  For the precise wording of 
each specific policy please refer back to the source document.

Planning Policy 
Purpose / Relevant Sections 
SP1 Creating a 
Quality Environment 
Sustainable development will be pursued as an integral principle of 
the planning and development process.  
Development proposals designed to a high quality and standard, 
which enhance townscape, landscape, sense of place, and 
strengthen Swansea Waterfront identity, will be favoured.  
SP2 - Creating a 
Quality Environment 
The countryside will be protected and conserved, with green 
wedges shaping the urban form and safeguarding the distinctive 
interplay of town and country. Village character will be protected. 
SP3 - Creating a 
Quality Environment 
The natural, built, and cultural heritage of the County will be 
protected and enhanced to safeguard from materially harmful 
development. 
Siting and Location - 
EV2 
The siting of new development should give preference to the use of 
previously developed land over greenfield sites, and must have 
regard to the physical character and topography of the site and its 
surroundings by:  
i. Avoiding locations that would have a significant adverse impact on 
prominent buildings, landscapes, open spaces and the general 
locality, including loss of visual amenity, 
ii. Effectively integrating with the landscape, seascape or coastline 
by utilising topography to integrate into the contours of the site and 
avoiding conspicuous locations on prominent skylines and ridges,

from 
those 
developments, as well as the creation of any environmental 
pollution to the detriment of neighbouring occupiers (including light, 
air and noise). 
Rural Development - 
EV21 
In the countryside non-residential development will only be 
permitted where it can be demonstrated that:  
iii. It is an appropriate development associated with farm 
diversification, sustainable tourism and recreation, or nature 
conservation and does not adversely affect the viability of an 
established farm unit.  
Rural Development - 
EV22 
The countryside throughout the County will be conserved and 
enhanced for the sake of its natural heritage, natural resources, 
historic and cultural environment and agricultural and recreational 
value through:  
i. The control of development, and 
ii. Practical management and improvement measures. 
Sites of International 
Importance - EV25 
Development, alone or in combination with other plans or projects, 
which is likely to adversely affect the integrity of a European 
protected site (SAC, Marine SAC, SPA and Ramsar Sites) and is 
not directly connected with or necessary to the management of the 
site, will not be permitted unless:  
i. There are imperative reasons of over-riding public interest, 
including those of a social or economic nature, which are sufficient 
to override the reasons for designation, and 
ii. There is no alternative solution. 
Where such development is permitted, planning conditions and/or 
obligations will be used to secure all compensatory measures 
necessary to ensure that the overall coherence of the European 
Site is protected. 
SSSIs and National 
Nature Reserves - 
EV27 
Development that significantly adversely affects the special 
interests of sites designated as SSSIs and NNRs will not be 
permitted unless the need for the development is of such 
significance that it outweighs the national importance of the 
designation.  
Where development is permitted, planning conditions and/or 
obligations will be used to protect and enhance those interests and

measures. 
Sites of Local 
Importance - EV28 
Within locally designated areas the natural heritage will be 
preserved and enhanced wherever possible.  
Development that would significantly adversely affect the special 
interest of Local Nature Reserves will not be permitted unless the 
need for the development is of such significance that it outweighs 
the importance of the designation.  
Development that would significantly adversely affect SINCs or 
RIGs, or which would not provide for appropriate compensatory or 
mitigation measures will not be permitted, unless it can be 
demonstrated to meet appropriate social or economic needs where 
the benefits in such terms would outweigh the harm to the feature 
concerned.  
Where development is permitted which would damage the nature 
conservation value of the site, such damage will be kept to a 
minimum, and appropriate mitigation or compensatory measures 
sought. 
Trees, Woodland 
and Hedgerow 
Protection - EV30 
Protection and improved management of woodlands, trees and 
hedgerows which are important for their visual amenity, historic 
environment, natural heritage, and/or recreation value will be 
encouraged, with priority being given to:  
i. Protecting the remaining areas of ancient semi natural woodland 
and planted ancient woodland sites, 
ii. Promoting new planting with species appropriate to the location, 
where there is no conflict with other land uses or nature 
conservation interests, and 
iii. Ensuring that where management involves commercial felling 
and replanting, protection of amenity interests is achieved. 
Environmental 
Enhancement - 
EV32 
Environmental improvement schemes will be implemented at a 
number of locations shown on the Proposals Map. These are 
intended to:  
i. Improve visual appearance, natural heritage value and recreation 
potential, 
ii. Improve the setting of industrial, commercial and residential 
developments and transport corridors, and 
iii. Maintain, extend and improve the quality of the urban 
greenspace network in line with the aims of the ‘Greening the City’ 
strategy 
Protection of 
Controlled Waters - 
EV34 
Development proposals that may impact upon the water 
environment will only be permitted where it can be demonstrated 
that they would not pose a significant risk to the quality and or 
quantity of controlled waters.  
Initiatives that lead to improvements in the quality of surface water 
will be approved subject to satisfactory ecological and visual 
safeguards.

flooding on site or an increase in flood risk elsewhere, and/or 
ii. A reduction in the quality of surface water run-off, 
will only be permitted where it can be demonstrated that appropriate 
alleviating measures can be implemented.  
Sustainable drainage systems (SUDS) will be encouraged wherever 
they would be effective and practicable, so as to ensure that 
development does not increase run off, and potentially damage 
important landscape features and protected species and habitats. 
Where SUDS are not provided then any conventional drainage 
system utilised must improve the status quo. 
Air, Noise and Light

ER 6 Designated Sites 
of 
Importance 
for 
Nature Conservation 
Development will not be permitted that would result in a likely 
significant adverse effect to sites of international or national 
nature conservation importance.  
Development that would affect locally designated sites of nature 
conservation importance should maintain or enhance the nature 
conservation interest of the site.  Where this cannot be achieved 
development will only be permitted where it can be demonstrated 
that:  
i. The need for the development outweighs the need to protect 
the site for nature conservation purposes; 
ii. There is no satisfactory alternative location for the development 
that avoids nature conservation impacts; and, 
iii. Any unacceptable harm is kept to a minimum by effective 
avoidance measures and mitigation, or where this is not feasible 
compensatory measures must be put in place to ensure that there 
is no overall reduction in the nature conservation value of the 
area. 
ER 8 Habitats and 
Species 
Development proposals that would have a significant adverse 
effect on the continued viability of habitats and species, including 
those identified as priorities in the UK or Swansea Local 
Biodiversity Action Plan, will only be permitted where:  
i. The need for development outweighs the nature conservation 
importance of the site; 
ii. The developer demonstrates that there is no satisfactory 
alternative location for the development which avoids nature 
conservation impacts; 
iii. Effective mitigation measures are provided by the developer; 
And, 
iv. Any unavoidable harm is minimised by effective mitigation to 
ensure that there is no reduction in the overall nature 
conservation value of the area.  Where this is not feasible, 
compensation measures designed to conserve, enhance, 
manage and, where appropriate, restore natural habitats and 
species must be provided.

The objectives of the desk study are to review the existing information available in 
the public domain concerning species and habitats to identify the following: 
 
Internationally, nationally and locally designated sites, up to 2 km from the 
Project Site Boundary using the Multi Agency Geographic Information for the 
Countryside (MAGIC) website (www.magic.gov.uk) in accordance with 
published guidelines (Figure 8.3) (Ref. 8.2);  
 
Natura 2000 sites, up to 10 km from the Project Site Boundary (Figure 8.2) (see 
Table 8.7 for justification on search distances);  
 
Protected and Priority species records and records of locally designated sites 
up to 2 km from the Project Site Boundary, using the South East Wales 
Biodiversity Records Centre (SEWBReC) in accordance with published 
guidelines (Ref. 8.2);  
 
SACs and SSSIs designated for bats within a 10 km radius of the Project Site 
Boundary 
in 
accordance 
with 
Bat 
Conservation 
Trust 
(Ref. 
8.3) 
recommendations;  
 
Section 7 list of Species and Habitats of Principal Importance for Conservation 
of Biological Diversity in Wales;  
 
Ancient Semi-Natural Woodland (ASNW), Plantation on Ancient Woodland Site 
(PAWS), Restored Ancient Woodland Site (RAWS) or Ancient Woodland Site 
of Unknown category (AWSU) within or adjacent to the Project Site Boundary 
using Ancient Woodland Inventory 2011 dataset downloaded from the Lle 
website;  
 
Tree Protection Orders (TPO’s) from CCS;  
 
Local/county recorders for bryophytes, flora, moths, butterflies, amphibians, 
reptiles, birds, bats, mammals, and the County Ecologist were contacted for 
local records or knowledge about the Project Site; and, 
 
Aerial photographs and Ordnance Survey (OS) maps were reviewed to identify 
features of ecological interest surrounding the Project Site Boundary including 
ponds within 500 m, nearby areas of ecological interest and features 
connecting these habitats (hedgerows, watercourses, railway lines).

ii. Field Survey Methods 
8.4.3 
A Preliminary Ecological Appraisal (PEA) (Ref. 8.4) was undertaken in May 2017.  
Included within the PEA were a Phase 1 Habitat survey and an appraisal of the 
potential of the Project Site to support protected or notable species.  The results of 
this survey combined with the desk top assessment informed the need for further 
ecological surveys.  
8.4.4 
Table 8.6 provides a summary of the surveys undertaken, coupled with their extent 
and limitations.  The species scoped in were determined through an assessment of 
known range, habitat preferences and desk-based data.  The detailed 
methodologies are outlined in each of the respective baseline technical appendices 
(Appendix 8.1 – 8.11).  The table explains where data from the ecology surveys 
undertaken by BSG Ecology in 2014 will be used to inform the assessment and 
why this is considered to be appropriate and identifies limitations on the survey 
data obtained by AECOM in 2017.

Phase 1 Habitat 
survey 
The survey involved a site walkover of all 
accessible land within the Project Site Boundary 
and preliminary assessment of key habitats, land 
use and ecological features. The main habitats 
present were recorded using standard Phase 1 
Habitat Survey methodology as described in the 
Handbook for Phase 1 Habitat Survey: A 
technique for Environmental Audit (Ref. 8.6). The 
plant species defining the habitat types within the 
Project Site Boundary were recorded. Evidence of 
any invasive plant species subject to legal controls 
was recorded. The Project Site was assessed for 
its potential to support protected or notable 
species in order to identify potential ecological 
constraints and to guide recommendations for 
further surveys. 
May 2017 
Appendix 8.1  
There were no significant limitations associated with the Phase 1 
Habitat Survey.  
During the Phase 1 Habitat survey some areas adjacent to but 
outside of the Project Site Boundary were not accessible at the 
time of survey and as such these habitats were surveyed from the 
road at a distance and some areas within the Project Site 
Boundary were not accessible due to the presence of horses; 
these habitats were surveyed at a distance.  It is possible that 
evidence of some species, including invasive non-native plant 
species may not have been recorded due to access limitations.  
Site conditions not significantly different to 
those in 2014. 
 
 
National 
Vegetation 
Classification 
(NVC) survey 
BSG Ecology used the Phase 1 Habitat survey to 
identify Section 42 habitats of the NERC Act 2006 
(now Section 7 habitats of the Environment 
(Wales) Act 2016); these habitats plus any 
designated site habitats within the Project Site 
Boundary were selected for inclusion in the NVC 
survey.  
June, 
July, 
September 
and 
November

Appendix 8.2 
There were no significant limitations associated with the NVC 
survey. 
Site conditions as documented in the Phase 
1 Habitat Survey undertaken by AECOM 
were not significantly different to those 
recorded in 2014 and as such the 2014 
NVC survey results provide an accurate 
representation of the habitats currently 
present within the Project Site Boundary; 
there is no requirement for an updated 
NVC.  
Invasive species 
A dedicated survey for invasive species was 
undertaken by BSG Ecology in 2014.  Invasive 
species were recorded during the 2017 Phase 1 
survey.   
July 2014 & 
May 2017 
Appendix 8.1 
The scale of the Project Site and the presence of dense areas of 
scrub or woodland understorey in some areas mean that it is 
possible that small stands or individual plants of invasive species 
could have been missed during the walkover survey.  In addition, 
the presence of horses in some fields restricted access to some 
areas of the Project Site although these areas were assessed 
using binoculars and it is likely, given the heavily grazed nature of 
these fields, that most invasive plant species would have been 
visible using binoculars.  It is considered that the majority of the 
Project Site was surveyed adequately and that overall the 
distribution of invasive species across the Survey Site has been 
mapped accurately.  
Site conditions when visited in 2017 were 
not significantly different to those recorded 
in 2014. 
 
An update to survey will be required prior to 
the production of the final management plan 
and/or implementation of control measures.  
Invertebrates 
BSG Ecology conducted invertebrate surveys for 
moths, marsh fritillary (adult and larval stages), 
terrestrial beetles, and aquatic macroinvertebrates 
in ponds and watercourses. 
June 
– 
September 
2014 
Appendix 8.3  
There were no significant limitations associated with the 
invertebrate survey. 
Site conditions as documented in the Phase 
1 Habitat Survey undertaken by AECOM 
were not significantly different to those 
recorded in 2014 and as such the 2014 
invertebrate survey results provide an 
accurate representation of the species likely 
to be present within the Project Site 
Boundary; this is no requirement for an 
updated invertebrate survey.

Great

A total of 26 ponds were identified within proximity 
of the Project Site.  
 
An HSI Assessment was undertaken on all ponds 
within 500m of the Site and ponds outside of the 
500m but clustered with ponds within the 500m of 
the Project Site Boundary.  
 
Following the HSI Assessment, of the 26 ponds 
identified, two were classed as poor (a further 
survey was undertaken on one of these) nine were 
dry and seven were not accessible and therefore 
could not be surveyed either due to no land 
access agreement or dense vegetation restricting 
access.  
 
Manual surveys were based on English Nature 
‘Great Crested Newt Mitigation Guidelines’ (2001) 
(Ref. 8.7), using three methods where possible. 
May – June 
2017 
Appendix 8.4 
Of the 26 ponds identified, seven were surveyed due to land 
access restrictions and dense vegetation.  It is considered unlikely 
for these ponds to support great crested newt (GCN) given the 
lack of GCN records from the local records centre and the 
absence of GCN identified in other ponds during the surveys.  
A summary of the manual survey and environmental DNA (eDNA) 
analysis limitations is given in the embedded table below.

A dead water shrew (Neomys

A dead water shrew was found in 
one of the bottle traps during the 
first survey visit in Pond 7. Due to 
the proximity of Pond 8 to Pond 7 
and the risk of trapping water 
shrews, bottle trapping ceased for 
Pond 8 and the netting technique 
was used for future surveys. 
None 
11 
Only approximately 5% of edge is 
accessible. Low water level and 
steep sides, not suitable for bottle 
trapping and dense vegetation 
will restrict torching.  
Small area was torched on 1st 
survey visit but ineffective. No 
further manual 
surveys 
were 
undertaken. 
Only 5% of 
pond perimeter 
accessible to 
sample. 
Ponds 1b and 4 are within a cluster of 
ponds to the north west of the Project Site. 
No evidence of GCN was identified for other 
ponds within this cluster of ponds and 
therefore the manual survey limitation is not 
significant.  
Pond 11 has previously been surveyed and 
no evidence of GCN was found Appendix 
8.17). 
Therefore, 
the 
manual 
survey 
limitation is not significant.  
Pond 19b is connected to Pond 19a. Pond 
19a was assessed to be poor as part of the 
HSI assessment. However, due to the 
limitation to the surveys on Pond 19b, 
manual surveys and an eDNA survey was 
undertaken on Pond 19a.  No evidence of 
GCN was returned for Pond 19a and 
therefore the manual survey limitation on 
Pond 19b is not significant.  
Usually a GCN eDNA water sample which 
has been taken from such a restricted area 
reduces the confidence in any negative 
result returned as GCN eDNA can be 
patchy depending upon where the animals 
have been in the pond.  However, on this 
occasion, given the lack of evidence of GCN 
within other ponds in close proximity of 
Ponds 1b, 4 and 11 and the previous survey 
undertaken on Pond 11 which returned no 
results for GCN (Appendix 8.17).  The 
eDNA limitation on Ponds 1b, 4 and 11 is 
not significant.

Appendix 8.5 
Several areas of habitat suitable for supporting reptiles within the 
Project Site Boundary could not be surveyed using artificial refugia 
due to the presence of grazing livestock.  Artificial refugia would 
pose a health and safety risk to the livestock as well as posing a 
risk of trampling to sheltering reptile utilising the artificial refugia.  
These areas lacked features where reptiles might be easily 
observed and as such a walkover survey of these areas was not 
considered appropriate.  There is the potential for reptiles to have 
gone unrecorded in these areas.  These areas have been 
indicated on Figure 2 of in Appendix 8.6.

is 
not

the survey as the initial visit in June 2017

Further surveys will be conducted in April 
and May 2018, and will be reported and

Following an initial ground-based assessment, trees which showed 
potential for supporting roosting bats were subject to a climbed

were not climbed as they could not be re-found.  These trees did 
not have their bat roost potential category altered from the ground-
based assessment assigned category and all trees with a

limitation. 
Building 1 was not fully assessed due to time constraints (AECOM, 
2017). However, this building is approximately 120m outside of the 
Project Site Boundary and no further surveys were considered 
necessary on this building. Therefore, this is not a significant 
limitation.  
Access was not granted to Buildings 7 and 8 (collectively known 
as Abergelli Farm) to the west of, but outside, the Project Site and 
these could not be assessed for their potential to support roosting 
bats.  However, these buildings (BSG Buildings 4 and 5) were 
previously assessed by BSG Ecology (Appendix 8.8).  The 
previous results will be used in the assessment.  
A number of limitations were identified for the walked transects, 
including occasionally missing listen points, completing the 
transect prior to the recommended finish time. These are not 
significant limitations.  
No bat activity transect surveys were undertaken in April or May 
and no static detectors were deployed in April or May.  This is not 
considered a significant limitation as the numbers of bats were 
fairly homogenous across the survey months.  
The first two emergence/re-entry surveys of Building B4 in August 
are ten days apart, as opposed to 2 weeks, as recommended by 
guidelines.

Bat Activity Walked Transect Survey 
The first set of June walked transect surveys had 11 listening 
points (LPs) per transect, this was increased to 12 LPs per 
transect for all subsequent surveys.  This was done to increase the 
spread of sample points.   
On 10 July 2017 during the Northern Transect the SD recording 
card briefly came out of the EM3 bat detector and calls during that 
period were not recorded electronically.  However, this was 
replaced and all bats heard during the period were recorded on the 
survey sheet and were of common species which the surveyor 
was able to determine species identification with confidence.   
On 13 September 2017 the dawn South Transect survey finished 
at 06:42 which was 5 minutes before sunrise, however no bats had 
been heard since 06:16.  
On a small number of occasions surveyors walked past LPs or 
LPs were not accessible meaning that bat data was not recorded 
for three minutes at that location. For calculations of Bat Activity 
Index, the survey time at each LP has been adjusted to reflect this 
variation and will mitigate the impact of this limitation of the 
comparisons of bat activity between LPs. The occasions are listed 
below:  
 On 10 July 2017 North Transect LP 4 was missed;   
Based on observations in 2017, habitats 
have not changed significantly since 2014.

 On 23 August and 7, 11 and 12 September 2017, North 
Transect LP1 was not accessible due to horses being present 
in the field. A replacement LP was completed as close as 
possible to the original location at LP1a, as shown on Figure 
5.2; 
 On 7 and 13 September 2017 LP7 on the South Transect not 
accessible due to the presence of rams in the field.  On 7 
September 2017, LP9 was missed, this was replaced with 
LP9a (see Table 1. 12, LP9a and Figure 5. 3).  As LP9 was 
replaced with another LP close to the original location;  
 On 3 October 2017, LP9 was missed, this was replaced with 
LP9b (See Table 1.12, LP9b and Figure 5. 3).  As LP9 was 
replaced with another LP close to the original location.  
The weather conditions encountered on the dusk transect surveys 
on 13 September 2017 were not considered wholly favourable for 
bats, but not so bad as to need to abandon the survey.  There was 
light rain at 21:33 and a spell of heavy rain between 21:50 and 
22:17. The North Transect was also sampled at dusk on 11 
September 2017 in favourable weather conditions. 
It was not possible to incorporate land within the gated National 
Grid land in a walked bat activity transect due to access 
restrictions at night and during the early morning.   
Bat Activity Static Detector Survey 
Some of the static detectors did not record for the full five night 
period. Details of malfunctions and reduced survey nights are 
provided in Appendix 8.7: Appendix 3A Static Detector Limitations.  
No data was recorded at South 3 in June 2017 and South 1 in July 
2017. Data in these locations was successfully collected in the 
other four months. 
No data was recorded at: Lane 2 in August and September 2017.  
Two other static detectors (Lane 1 and Lane 3) were positioned 
within the lane and have captured bat activity which is 
representative of the lane.  
Data Analysis and Interpretation 
Different bat species vary in their likelihood of detection using bat 
detectors and therefore it is not relevant to compare numbers of 
bat passes from different species (Ref. 8.3).   
Results of the statistical analysis could only utilise the first night of 
data for each location in each month, due to the variation in 
successful recording nights. Therefore, the results are less 
powerful than if the full five nights could have been compared. 
However, the statistical analysis provides an additional tool, 
alongside Bat Activity Index (BAI) and count data in the 
interpretation of bat activity.  
 
These are not considered to be significant limitations to the survey.

Felindre Gas Compressor Station and the two National Grid 400 
kV electrical substations were not included in the static surveys as 
access to these areas could not be arranged until late in June.  
This area is a small proportion of the Project Site that does not 
contain habitats significantly different to those present in other 
parts of the Project Site, and is unlikely to support a more diverse

Air Quality - Nature Conservation Interests 
For all SSSI within at least 2 km, and all SAC/SPA/Ramsar within 10 km, of the 
proposed plant, information should be included in the ES as follows: 
Concentrations of NOx (and SO2 if present in emissions) emitted by the proposed 
plant compared to critical levels for sensitive habitats at the above sites.  
Proposed plant emissions (Process Contribution/PC) should be compared as a 
percentage of the relevant critical level as well being compared to the PC added to the 
background (PEC), to give percentage figures.  
Levels of nutrient Nitrogen deposition and Acid deposition derived from the proposed 
plant (PC) should also be compared to site relevant critical loads for the above sites, 
and should be similarly compared to the PC and PEC for each feature's most sensitive 
critical load value, to give percentage values.  
In relation to a Peaking Power facility which operates sporadically, the assessment 
must assess a worst case scenario i.e. the maximum number of hours that the plant 
will be able to operate, over a year.  
Habitats Regulations Assessment 
NRW advise that a Shadow Habitats Regulations Assessment (HRA) should be 
recorded by the applicant (as per PINS guidance Note 10). The HRA should test the 
likely significant effects of the development for all relevant receptor SAC, SPA and 
Ramsar sites, in light of impact pathways from the development itself (for example 
aerial emissions). These effects should be tested alone and if no likely significant 
effects concluded for a particular impact pathway on a site(s) alone, in-combination 
effects should then be tested for those parameters, according to any residual effects 
from this development and other relevant plans/projects. Any likely significant effects 
identified should lead to the recording of a shadow Appropriate Assessment (or Report

CCS advised that they would not be able to comment on an application prior to all 
survey work being completed and submitted. CCS will also require comment from 
NRW and likewise will not comment before all survey work is completed and 
submitted.  
CCS noted that the BSG Ecology reports that they had seen were robust but lacked 
analysis, conclusions and recommendations. CCS approved that the AECOM reports 
would be drawing conclusions based on the BSG Ecology work as well as the updated 
surveys.  
Based on the outcomes of the survey work CCS are likely to also require the following:  
An Ecological Management Plan detailing retained features, mitigation and 
enhancement for ecology. The document needs to include how any valued receptors 
identified and proposed mitigation/compensation areas will be monitored and 
managed in the long term (minimum 5 year rolling management plan).  
Construction Ecological Management Plan (CEMP) outlining how retained ecological 
features on and adjacent to the Project Site will be safeguarded during the 
construction phase.   
A lighting design strategy to identify those areas/features on-site that are particularly 
sensitive for nocturnal fauna. The strategy must show how and where external lighting 
will be installed (through the provision of appropriate lighting contour plans and 
technical specifications) so that it can be clearly demonstrated that areas to be lit will 
not disturb or prevent the above species crossing and utilising the Project Site.

There is currently a lack of detail around the total extent of habitat loss and the 
measures to be employed to avoid, mitigate and compensate for the unavoidable 
impacts. The mitigation hierarchy must be clearly presented to allow an informed 
decision to be made regarding the degree of loss and subsequent measures to be 
employed to ameliorate that loss.  
 
Bats 
Numerous species and in good numbers have been recorded as foraging and 
commuting across the Project Site and NRW will provide detailed advice in relation to 
this European Protected Species. However, particularly important routes appear to 
exist along the drainage ditches that cross the proposed main power generation plant 
area. It is suggested that this be re routed around the boundary of this working area to 
maintain the commuting route for these species. This boundary also needs to 
integrate suitable habitat for other protected species such as otter, reptile and badger. 
It must be kept dark. 
There are trees that have been identified as existing and potential bat roosts that must 
be fully considered as part of the application. In addition any new trees that might 
become affected as the scheme progresses must also be assessed for their potential 
to support roosting bats.  
There is still a question mark over the presence of hibernation roosts in an identified 
mine and adit. This issue must be resolved as there is the potential for these roosts to 
be impacted by the proposal if they are present.  
A detailed mitigation statement should be compiled to demonstrate how these species 
Habitat loss calculations for each habitat and designated site are presented in Figure 
8-4. Mitigation and compensation measures have been included in this chapter for 
each feature where an effect has been evaluated as being significant. This ES 
includes mitigation and compensation measures for each feature where the effect has 
been evaluated as significant. A LEMP and Strategy (Figure 3.6 and Appendix 3.4) 
includes details of where mitigation and compensatory habitats will be located, and 
how they will be created and managed. The mitigation hierarchy is presented in this 
ES.  
 
Bats 
Comment noted regarding NRW providing advice on bats as a European Protected 
Species. Mitigation with regards to bats has considered key commuting and foraging 
routes, and aims to continue to allow species to commute and forage across the 
Project Site. Other species are included in the mitigation plan for the Project Site. The 
LEMP and Strategy (Figure 3.6 and Appendix 3.4) includes a lighting plan and details 
of dark corridors designed to allow species to commute and forage across the Site 
during construction and operation.  
Comments with regards to trees and bat roosts have been noted. Any trees that will 
be affected by the Project will be assessed for their potential to support roosting bats if 
not undertaken already. 
Safety investigations regarding the trial shaft (mining feature) have confirmed the 
location of the shaft and that it has been filled in. The adit was confirmed by the

will be considered during construction works (could be incorporated into the CEMP), 
during plant operation and during the decommissioning phase. 
Lighting will be particularly important for these and the other nocturnal animals that 
have been identified as on and around the Project Site. A lighting strategy must be 
compiled that clearly demonstrates how lighting will be minimised and sensitively 
located in relation to the ecological constraints of the Project Site. This is to retain 
valuable habitat for Protected species and in accordance with UDP Policy EV41.  
 
Badgers 
There are setts present that could be impacted by the proposal and NRW will need to 
comment on whether a licence might be necessary if works have the potential to 
infringe on The Protection of Badgers Act 1992. 
A detailed mitigation statement should be compiled to demonstrate how these species 
will be considered during construction works (could be incorporated into the CEMP), 
during plant operation and during the decommissioning phase.  
 
Otter & Water Vole 
Although current use by water vole has been ruled out there is some evidence that 
they could have used the Project Site previously. Water vole should therefore be able 
to re-colonise the Project Site if they move back into the area. All new water features 
created as part of the scheme should incorporated features to enable them to be used 
by this species if present. 
A detailed mitigation statement should be compiled to demonstrate how these species 
will be considered during construction works (could be incorporated into the CEMP), 
during plant operation and during the decommissioning phase. 
 
Reptiles 
Good populations of slow worm and Grass snake have been recorded on Project Site 
and in areas to be affected by the works. It is not possible to rule out other species 
such as Adder as the habitat is suitable particularly the wet woodland edge habitat 
and they have been recorded within the 2km record search buffer. 
A full and detailed method statement must be produced in respect of these species 
outlining how works will be carried out to avoid killing or injuring these species as 
required by the Wildlife & Countryside Act (1981). Given the amount of suitable 
surrounding habitat the strategy should seek to systematically make the working areas 
unsuitable for them and effectively "push" them into safeguarded adjacent receptor 
areas in the first instance. Some work may be required in the receptor areas before 
any works begin to increase the carrying capacity ready to receive the additional 
numbers of reptiles. As they will not be able to use the Project Site in the same way as 
they currently do a certain amount of mitigation will be required to make up this short 
fall in the form of habitat improvement and targeted management. Some mitigation 
should take the form of creating suitable boundary habitats around working areas 
allowing reptiles to recolonise the Project Site to some degree post construction.  
These details should be secured within the application. This could be done by the 
submission of a detailed mitigation statement demonstrating how these species will be 
considered during construction works (could be incorporated into the CEMP), during 
plant operation and during the decommissioning phase.

Invasive and Non-native Species 
These are numerous on the Project Site and there is a substantial risk of spread and 
contamination without appropriate preventative measures being in place. Of particular 
concern is the presence of floating pennywort in one of the ponds scheduled for 
removal. Given the amount of ground works and movement of soils, digging of new 
ditches and ponds that will be required there is a significant risk of spread. A detailed 
and thorough plan must be produced for its eradication on Project Site and to prevent 
it from spreading to others. The same goes for the other species identified as present. 
A detailed mitigation statement should be compiled to demonstrate how these species 
will be considered during construction works (could be incorporated into the CEMP), 
during plant operation and during the decommissioning phase. 
 
SINC and Section 7 Habitats 
It is currently unclear exactly how much SINC and Section 7 habitat will be lost to the 
proposal. Whilst the PEIR sets out some figures for habitat loss these are based on 
the main power generation plant and does not consider other loss that may occur 
during associated works such as access routes construction, electrical cable 
installation, drainage, AGI construction etc. All these elements must be fully 
considered to allow a thorough mitigation package to be determined. 
Some loss has been identified as a temporary loss that can be reinstated once 
construction works are complete but this is not necessarily an easy thing to achieve, 
some habitat is easier than others but it must be carefully thought about and planned 
for it to be successful. Based on the current level of information it is not possible to 
determine if this strategy is feasible for example; is there sufficient receptor and 
storage areas for the temporarily removed habitat without harming existing habitat? 
How much will require new planting? More detail on how the temporary loss will be 
managed will be needed to properly determine the impacts of the scheme. 
Where long term loss of habitat will occur compensation will be necessary. Although 
not detailed in the submitted literature it is understood from verbal communication that 
the "tear drop" or southernmost part of the development boundary is being considered 
as an offsetting area. This area is already assessed as marshy grassland and 
therefore has value in its own right. It is acknowledged that improvements could be 
made to this area to partially offset some loss but based on current information is 
considered insufficient on its own. The most suitable areas for offsetting are those of 
low ecological value such as improved grassland which is present in the surrounding 
area. As a standard, twice the amount of area should be sought in compensation as 
that which has been lost. 
 
Wildlife Protection Plan or CEMP 
The Wildlife Protection Plan (WPP) should build upon the principles of the submitted 
Outline CEMP and include the following as a minimum; 
 Risk assessment of potentially damaging construction activities.  
 Identification of "biodiversity protection zones". 
 Practical measures (both physical measures and sensitive working practices) to 
avoid or reduce impacts during construction (including species and habitat 
specific method statements*).

traverse the Project Site. If this impact does not need to be considered, it would be 
useful to clarify why this element has not been considered further as it appears as an 
omission at the current time. 
Para 8.8.43 states that the detailed decommissioning....would be subject to a separate

It is appreciated that the additional mitigation measures will be required and that these 
have not been confirmed at this stage as they are subject to discussion with NRW and 
the Council's Ecologist (and some surveys are still on-going). Full details should

We note the bat surveys that have been undertaken so far and that further bat activity 
surveys are planned for Spring 2018, with the results to be included in the DCO 
submission.  
We welcome Figure 7 within Appendix 8.7 entitled ‘Bat Activity - Areas of Potential 
Impact’ which shows where bat flightlines along habitat features may be severed by 
habitat removal and/or lighting.  We consider that these matters should be addressed 
by reinstating the hedgerows and rows of trees in the north of the Project Site, 
following the installation of the proposed gas pipeline. This will ensure that bat 
flightpaths along habitat features are maintained.  
In addition to the above, we advise the agreement of a lighting plan that limits lighting 
of the Project Site’s infrastructure and not on the surrounding vegetation, by creating 
dark corridors within the Project Site. We note that an outline lighting strategy is to be 
submitted as part of the DCO submission (this should cover construction, operational 
and emergency lighting proposals). This should demonstrate the location of the dark 
corridors to continue to allow species to commute and forage across the Project Site. 
Focus should be on the ancient woodland area to the north/north-east of the 
generating station site, where figure 7 has highlighted an area of potential impacts on 
bats from lighting. In addition to bats, otters are thought to be using the ditches in this 
area, and we note that there are proposals to re-route ditches around this area, which 
may increase activity.  
We note that the mine adit and trial shaft is currently being assessed for its potential to 
support bats, and welcome that the results will be included in the final submission.  
APL acknowledges the comments provided and confirms that a LEMP has been 
produced (as discussed in the meeting held on the 6th February 2018), which shows 
where hedgerows and trees will be removed and reinstated (Figure 3.6 and Appendix

removal should be avoided where possible. Planning Policy Wales (November 2016) 
Chapter 5 states in Section 5.2.9. that “Ancient and semi-natural woodlands are 
irreplaceable habitats of high biodiversity value which should be protected from 
development that would result in significant damage.” We refer you to the City and 
County of Swansea’s Local Development Plan Policy ‘ER 11 – Trees and 
Development’ in relation to Ancient Woodland.  
Acknowledged. The routing of the new section of Access Road (formerly described as 
“Option B”) has been revised in order to avoid Ancient Woodland. Mitigation required 
is outlined in the LEMP and Strategy (Figure 3.6 and Appendix 3.4).

The areas of marshy grassland on the Project Site have been identified  
within the ecological surveys as having the appropriate structure and species 
composition to support marsh fritillary butterflies. While we appreciate that marsh 
fritillaries have not been identified as currently using the Project Site, the Project Site 
is within the larger meta-population area, which includes Nant Y Crimp SSSI and 
several other areas of suitable habitat and known marsh fritillary records. We therefore 
recommend that suitable mitigation is included for the temporary and permanent loss 
of marsh grassland habitat that will occur as a result of the development. This could 
include managing the remaining areas of marshy grassland for the benefit of marsh 
fritillaries and restoring the temporary storage areas to marshy grassland once 
construction activities are complete, and can be included in the HMP.  
Acknowledged. Mitigation required is outlined in the LEMP and Strategy (Figure 3.6 
and Appendix 3.4). 
NRW

We advise that an assessment of Air Quality impacts (both alone, and cumulative 
effects) on the Sites of Special Scientific Interest (SSSI) within the relevant screening 
distance (2km) is required to be submitted.  
Nant y Crimp SSSI is greater than 2 km from the stack of the Generating Equipment 
and as such there are no effects in relation to air quality from stack emissions alone or 
cumulatively with other plans or projects.  
Transport related emissions are most relevant to sites within 200 m of a major road. 
The Design Manual for Roads and Bridges (DMRB) (Ref. 8.17) identifies 200 m as the 
distance beyond which the contribution of traffic emissions to local pollutant 
concentrations is considered to be negligible.  Nant y Crimp SSSI is greater than 200 
m from any road, as such there are no effects in relation to transport related emissions 
alone or cumulatively with other plans or projects.

 Study Area 
b)
8.4.7 
Each study area is displayed on a figure in the applicable appendix as referred to in 
Table 8.6.  
8.4.8 
In accordance with the published guidance for the Phase 1 Habitat survey (Ref. 
8.6) and the breeding bird survey (Ref. 8.15) the study area comprised the land 
within the Project Site Boundary (Appendix 8.1, Figure 1; and Appendix 8.6, Figure 
1, respectively).  
8.4.9 
In accordance with the published guidance (Ref. 8.8) the reptile study area 
comprised suitable and accessible habitat within the Project Site Boundary 
(Appendix 8.5, Figure 1).  
8.4.10 In accordance with the published guidance (Ref. 8.7) the great crested newt study 
area comprised suitable and accessible land within the Project Site Boundary and 
within a 500 m buffer of the Project Site Boundary, as well as a string of ponds 
extending outside of the buffer but in very close proximity to each other (Appendix 
8.4, Figure 1).  
8.4.11 The bat study area comprised the land within the Project Site Boundary and the 
area within the Zone of Influence (ZoI) (Appendix 8.7 Figure 2). The Bat Survey 
Guidelines (Ref. 8.10) state that bat roost assessments must be considered within 
the Project Site Boundary and the areas under the ZoI of the project.  For potential 
bat roosts the ZoI was assessed to be all land within the Project Site Boundary; and 
using professional judgement, within a 50 m buffer surrounding area where the 
Generating Equipment Site (see Assessment Method below) will be situated due to 
noise, vibration and lighting during construction, operation and decommissioning. 
For potential bat commuting and foraging habitat the transect routes for bat activity 
surveys covered all accessible land within or crossed by the Project Site Boundary.  
8.4.12 In accordance with the published guidance the otter (Ref. 8.12) and water vole 
study (Ref. 8.13) area comprised watercourses and water bodies within the Project 
Site Boundary and within a 100 m radius of the Project Site Boundary (Appendix 
8.9, Figure 1).  
8.4.13 In accordance with the published guidance (Ref. 8.11) the dormouse study area 
comprised suitable and accessible habitat within the Project Site Boundary 
(Appendix 8.9, Figure 1).  
8.4.14 In accordance with the published guidance (Ref. 8.14) the badger study area 
comprised suitable and accessible habitat within the Project Site Boundary and 
within a 100 m buffer of the Project Site Boundary (Appendix 8.11, Figure 1).  
8.4.15 The study areas for the NVC survey (Appendix 8.2, Figures 1 & 2), invasive 
species, invertebrates (Appendix 8.3, Figures 1 & 2) and static bat detectors 
(Appendix 8.8, Figure 1) undertaken by BSG Ecology in 2014 (Appendix 8.8) were 
undertaken for a larger study area.  The current Project Site Boundary is smaller 
than the previous site boundary used by BSG Ecology but is encompassed by it 
Abergelli ES 2018 – CHAPTER 8: ECOLOGY 
 
Prepared for:  Abergelli Power Limited  
AECOM 
8-30 
 
(Figure 8.1).  Therefore the surveys undertaken by BSG Ecology have captured the 
current Project Site Boundary.  The results of the BSG Ecology surveys have been 
reviewed to extrapolate those results that are within the Project Site Boundary only.  
c) Assessment Method 
8.4.16 The Ecological Impact Assessment (EcIA) has been undertaken with reference to 
the Chartered Institute for Ecology and Environmental Management (CIEEM) 
Guidelines for Ecological Impact Assessment in the UK and Ireland (Ref. 8.2).  
8.4.17 The following principles underpin EcIA and have been applied throughout the 
process: 
 
Avoidance: Seek options that avoid harm to ecological features. 
 
Mitigation: Adverse effects should be avoided or minimised through mitigation 
measures, either through the design of the project or subsequent measures 
that can be guaranteed.  
 
Compensation: Where there are significant residual adverse ecological effects 
despite the mitigation proposed, these should be offset by appropriate 
compensatory measures.  
 
Enhancements: Seek to provide net benefits for biodiversity over and above 
requirements for avoidance, mitigation or compensation.  
8.4.18 A matrix-based approach has been used to ensure consistency across the ES. As 
per the CIEEM guidelines rankings are used with a clear definition of the criteria 
and thresholds that underpin them. See ‘Sensitivity or Value of Receptors’ and 
‘Magnitude’ below.  
8.4.19 The assessment describes the methods used to identify and assess the likely 
significant effects of the Project during the construction, operation, maintenance 
and decommissioning phases.  Baseline conditions are then described and 
subsequently the impact assessment is undertaken taking into account avoidance 
and mitigation measures that are inherent to the design, including the use of best 
practice construction.  
8.4.20 If necessary, additional mitigation, compensation and enhancement measures are 
then described followed by an assessment of the significance of residual effects.  A 
summary of the assessment is provided, together with relevant conclusions.  
8.4.21 The assessment is undertaken for each components of the Project as detailed in 
Chapter 3: Project and Site Description.  
8.4.22 Data received through consultation, desk-based investigations and field-based 
investigations will be used to allow relevant ecological features (including 
designated sites, ecosystems, habitat and species) of value (or potential value) to 
be identified, and the main factors contributing to their value described and related 
to available guidance.  
8.4.23 Ecological features may be important for multiple different reasons (e.g. rarity in a 
particular geographic context; role in habitat connectivity; or a species on the edge 
Abergelli ES 2018 – CHAPTER 8: ECOLOGY 
 
Prepared for:  Abergelli Power Limited  
AECOM 
8-31 
 
of their range).  Relevant reasons for which an ecological feature is important are 
described and considered in order to assign each relevant ecological feature an 
overall value.  
8.4.24 The value of ecological receptors identified is determined according to a 
geographical frame of reference and the conservation importance of a receptor.  
The value of receptors to be used in the EcIA is defined in Table 8-8.  
Table 8.8: Evaluation of Value  
Value / 
Sensitivity 
Guidelines 
Very High 
The receptor has little or no ability to absorb change without 
fundamentally altering its present character, is of very high 
environmental value, or of international importance.  
For example:  
An internationally designated site e.g. SPA, SAC, Ramsar, or site 
considered worthy of such designation. 
A regularly occurring globally threatened species.  
A viable area of a habitat type listed in Annex 1 of the Habitats 
Directive (92/43/EEC), or smaller area of such habitat which is 
essential to maintain the viability of a larger whole. 
A regularly occurring population of internationally important species 
listed in Annex II of the Habitats Directive (92/43/EEC). 
Any regularly occurring population of internationally important species 
that are rare or threatened in the UK or of uncertain conservation 
status (including individual species listed on Annex 1 of the EC Birds 
Directive) and/or listed as a qualifying feature of an SPA, SAC or 
Ramsar site. 
High 
The receptor has low ability to absorb change without fundamentally 
altering its present character, is of high environmental value, or of 
national importance.  
For example:  
A nationally designated site e.g. a SSSI, NNR or site that meets the 
criteria for such designation. 
A regularly occurring population of individual species listed or included 
on a SSSI citation as a reason for designation of a SSSI.  
A regularly occurring significant population/number of any nationally 
important species i.e. listed on the Wildlife and Countryside Act (1981) 
(as amended). 
A viable area of priority habitat type as identified in the Section 7 List 
of Habitats of Principal Importance for Conservation of Biological 
Diversity in Wales, or smaller areas of such habitat which are 
essential to maintain the viability of a larger whole. 
A regularly occurring, substantial population of a nationally rare 
species i.e. a species that contributes to the integrity of an SAC or 
SSSI but which are not cited as species for which the site is 
designated (SACs) or notified (SSSIs).

Species present in nationally important numbers (>1% UK population). 
Any regularly occurring highly significant population of any bird listed 
on the RSPB Red List of High Conservation Concern. 
A species assemblage that includes one or more nationally important 
species (as defined above) that occurs regularly in significant 
numbers. 
Medium 
The receptor has moderate capacity to absorb change without 
significantly altering its present character, has some environmental 
value, or is of regional importance.  
For example:  
Areas of internationally or nationally important habitats which are 
degraded but which could be readily restored. 
A regularly occurring, substantial population of a nationally scarce 
species i.e. priority species in the Section 7 List of Species of Principal 
Importance for Conservation of Biological Diversity in Wales. 
Viable areas of a Local BAP Priority habitat or small areas of such 
habitat which are essential to maintain the viability of the larger whole. 
A regularly occurring regionally significant population of a Local BAP 
Priority Species. 
Any regularly occurring significant population that is listed in a Local 
Red Data Book or a highly significant population of any bird listed on 
the RSPB Amber List of Medium Conservation Concern or substantial 
population of a regionally scare species. 
Species present in regionally important numbers (>1% regional 
population). Species occurring within SACs and SSSIs locally but not 
crucial to the integrity of the site. 
A site designated as a Local Nature Conservation Site (LNCS), 
Wildlife Site or Site of Interest for Nature Conservation (SINC). 
Low 
The receptor is tolerant of change without detriment to its character, is 
low environmental value, or local importance.  
For example:  
Areas identified as areas of conservation interest by organisations 
such as the local Wildlife Trust. 
A regularly occurring, substantial population of a species scarce in the 
local area or sites/features that are scarce within the locality or which 
appreciably enrich the local area’s habitat resource. 
Species, habitats or features that are a key component of a Local 
Nature Conservation Site (LNCS) or LNR. 
Locally significant populations of Red and Amber List species. A good 
example of a common or widespread habitat in the local area. 
Negligible 
The receptor is resistant to change and is of little environmental value.  
For example:  
A degraded/impoverished example of a common or widespread 
habitat in the local area. A habitat which offers little value for nature

conservation e.g. arable field. 
Populations of common and widespread species. 
A species considered to enrich the local ecological resource within the 
context of the Parish or Neighbourhood. 
 
iii. Magnitude 
8.4.25 Magnitude refers to size, amount, intensity and volume. It has been quantified 
where possible and expressed in absolute or relative terms e.g. the amount of 
habitat lost, percentage change to habitat area, percentage decline in a species 
population.  
8.4.26 Magnitude will then be ascribed a value as per Chapter 4: Approach to 
Environmental Impact Assessment.  
iv. Effect Definitions 
8.4.27 In line with the CIEEM (2016) guidelines, the terminology used within the EcIA 
draws a clear distinction between the terms ‘impact’ and ‘effect’.  For the purposes 
of the EcIA these terms are defined as follows: 
 
Impact – Actions resulting in changes to an ecological feature.  For example, 
demolition activities leading to the removal of a building utilised as a bat roost; 
and, 
 
Effect – Outcome resulting from an impact, acting upon the conservation status 
or structure and function of an ecological feature.  For example, killing/injury of 
bats and reducing the availability of breeding habitat because of the loss of a 
bat roost may lead to an adverse effect on the conservation status of the 
population concerned.  
8.4.28 When describing potential impacts (and where relevant the resultant effects) 
reference is made to the following characteristics: 
 
Beneficial/adverse – i.e. is the change likely to be in accordance with nature 
conservation objectives and policy: 
- 
Beneficial (i.e. positive) – a change that improves the quality of the 
environment, or halts or slows an existing decline in quality e.g. increasing 
the extent of a habitat of conservation value; or, 
- 
Adverse (i.e. negative) – a change that reduces the quality of the 
environment e.g. destruction of habitat or increased noise disturbance.  
 
Magnitude – the ‘size’, ‘amount’ or ‘intensity’ of an impact – this is informed on 
a quantitative basis where possible, and considers:  
- 
Spatial extent – the spatial or geographical area or distance over which the 
impact/effect occurs; 
- 
Duration – the time over which an impact is expected to last prior to 
recovery or replacement of the resource or feature. The likely duration of 
the impact should be quantified. Consideration has been given to how this 
Abergelli ES 2018 – CHAPTER 8: ECOLOGY 
 
Prepared for:  Abergelli Power Limited  
AECOM 
8-34 
 
duration relates to relevant ecological characteristics such as a species’ 
lifecycle. However, it is not always appropriate to report the duration of 
impacts in these terms. The duration of an effect may be longer than the 
duration of an activity or impact; 
- 
Reversibility – i.e. is the impact temporary or permanent. A temporary 
impact is one from which recovery is possible or for which effective 
mitigation are both possible and an enforceable. A permanent effect is one 
from which recovery is either not possible, or cannot be achieved within a 
reasonable timescale (in the context of the feature being assessed); and  
- 
Timing and frequency – i.e. consideration of the point at which the impact 
occurs in relation to critical life-stages or seasons.  
8.4.29 For each phase of the Project the assessment is structured and reported by valued 
ecological receptor with relevant potential impacts on that feature described in turn, 
and then the overall effect arising from those impacts reported.  For example, the 
impacts of roost loss, and light disturbance on retained roosts is documented, 
before a conclusion is reached on the overall effect on the conservation status of 
the local bat population concerned.  
v. Assessment of Significance of Effects 
8.4.30 A combination of the magnitude of the effect under consideration and the sensitivity 
of the receiving environment determines the significance of effect. This approach to 
the assessment of significance is outlined in Chapter 4: Approach to 
Environmental Impact Assessment.   
8.4.31 It should be noted that this general approach is a framework and should not be 
treated as a matrix. Within the chapter the significance of effects will be explained 
with reference to that particular discipline. 
8.5 
Baseline Environment 
8.5.1 
This section describes the baseline environmental characteristics for the Project 
Site and surrounding areas with specific reference to ecology.  
8.5.2 
A summary of the baseline conditions has been provided in the following sections.  
Detailed information such as survey data has been provided for each element in 
Appendices 8.1 – 8.19.  
 Designated Sites 
a)
8.5.3 
In addition to land within the Project Site, the primary effects on the designated 
sites in the vicinity of the Project Site are as a result of emissions from the stack, 
which have the potential to alter the concentration of NOx and lead to a change in 
acid and nitrogen deposition.  In lieu of any specific guidance on the NRW website, 
NRW have provided the following advice in consultation.  
8.5.4 
“Nature conservation-sites should be screened against the relevant standards if 
they occur within specified distance criteria, as detailed below:  
 
SPAs, SACs or Ramsar sites within 10 km of the Project; and,  
Abergelli ES 2018 – CHAPTER 8: ECOLOGY 
 
Prepared for:  Abergelli Power Limited  
AECOM 
8-35 
 
 
SSSIs within 2 km of the location of the Project.” 
8.5.5 
Given the advice provided within the recently withdrawn Environment Agency H1 
guidance (Annex F Air Emissions) and the Air emissions risk assessment for your 
environmental permit guidance on the gov.uk website, it has been deemed 
appropriate to include a search for NNRs, LNRs, local wildlife sites and ancient 
woodland within 2 km of the Project also.  
i. 
Statutory Designated Sites 
8.5.6 
Using the MAGIC website three internationally designated sites were identified 
within 10 km of the proposed exhaust gas flue stack of the Power Generation Plant 
within the Project Site Boundary (given as SN 65577 01324 at the time of 
conducting the desk study); and one nationally designated site within 2 km of the 
Project Site Boundary.  The details of the sites are presented below in Table 8.9. 
The location of these sites in relation to the Project Site Boundary is shown on 
Figure 8.2 – 8.3.  
8.5.7 
Statutory designated sites have been scoped in or out for further assessment in the 
EcIA, as detailed in Table 8.9, based upon a number of factors: 
 
Distance between the site and the Project Site Boundary;  
 
Designation features e.g. habitats, species; 
 
Ecological connectivity or linkages (e.g. connecting watercourse/hydrology or 
movement of species) between the designated site and the Project Site; or 
 
A combination of the above.  
8.5.8 
Two distances have been provided; one from the Project Site Boundary and 
another giving the distance from the proposed exhaust gas flue stack of the Power 
Generation Plant (given as SN 65577 01324 at the time of conducting the desk 
study) for assessing air quality effects.

Nant Y Crimp SSSI 
1.3 km west 
2.3 km 
Nant y Crimp is of special interest for its wet pastures, species-rich 
neutral grasslands and semi-natural woodland as well as associated 
scrub, which are host to several uncommon plant species. 
Notable plant species recorded at the site include petty whin Genista 
anglica, cranberry Vaccinium oxycoccos, narrow buckler fern 
Dryopteris carthusiana and whorled caraway Carum verticillatum, 
the latter an Atlantic species characteristic of unimproved pastures 
in the South Wales coalfield. 
In addition, there is also a colony of the marsh fritillary butterfly 
Euphydryas aurinia at the site. This is a declining species confined, 
in South Wales to wet agriculturally unimproved pastures where its 
food plant, devil’s bit scabious Succisa pratensis, grows in profusion.

ii. Non-Statutory Designated Sites 
8.5.9 
The desk study identified 12 non-statutory designated sites within 2 km of the 
Project Site Boundary, one is a Wildlife Trust Reserve and 11 are SINCs. Details of 
the sites are presented below in Table 8.10. The location of these sites in relation to 
the Project Site is shown on Figures 8.2 – 8.3.  
8.5.10 Non-statutory designated sites have been scoped in or out for further assessment 
in the EcIA, as detailed in Table 8.10, based upon a number of factors: 
 
Distance between the site and the Project Site Boundary;  
 
Designation features e.g. habitats; 
 
Ecological connectivity or linkages (e.g. connecting watercourse/hydrology or 
movement of species) between the site and the Project Site; or 
 
A combination of the above.  
8.5.11 Two distances have been provided; one from the Project Site Boundary and 
another giving the distance from the proposed exhaust gas flue stack of the Power 
Generation Plant for assessing air quality effects.

 NVC Survey 
d)
8.5.15 Land within the Project Site Boundary identified as being potentially ‘habitats of 
principal importance for nature conservation’ or identified as a SINC was selected 
for inclusion in the NVC survey by BSG Ecology; habitats included areas of 
woodland, grassland and mire.  
8.5.16 NVC habitats within the Project Site Boundary comprise:  
 
Two woodland communities/sub-communities; 
- 
W6e Alnus glutinosa – Urtica dioica woodland, Betula pubescens sub-
community; 
- 
W10 Quercus robur – Pteridium aquilinum – Rubus fruticosus woodland. 
 
Two mire sub-communities 
- 
M23a Juncus effusus/acutiflorus - Galium palustre rush-pasture, Juncus 
acutiflorus sub-community;  
- 
M25a Molinia caerulea – Potentilla erecta mire, Erica tetralix sub-

8.5.17 All of these NVC communities are situated in one area within the Project Site 
Boundary, adjacent to and partially within an area of Lletty-Morfil SINC.  
 Invasive Plant Species 
e)
8.5.18 Three invasive species subject to legal controls were identified within the Project 
Site Boundary during the Phase 1 Habitat survey – Rhododendron Rhododendron 
ponticum, Japanese knotweed and Himalayan balsam.  
8.5.19 During the 2014 survey, BSG Ecology identified five invasive species subject to 
legal controls: Japanese knotweed; Himalayan balsam; rhododendron; floating 
pennywort Hydrocotyle ranunculoides; and montbretia Crocosmia × crocosmiiflora.  
8.5.20 The most frequently recorded species in both surveys were Japanese knotweed 
and Himalayan balsam.  Japanese knotweed was found to be strongly associated 
with roads and trackways within the Project Site.  Himalayan balsam was found to 
be strongly associated with woodland, stream corridors and ditches across the 
Project Site.  
8.5.21 Rhododendron was found on the edge of woodlands and dense scrub in the south 
of the Project Site.  
8.5.22 Montbretia was recorded in one location within the Project Site Boundary along the 
existing access road.  
8.5.23 Floating pennywort was found in Pond 16.

i. 
Invertebrates 
8.5.24 Several records of notable moths and the protected marsh fritillary butterfly 
Euphydryas aurinia were returned from the local records centre.  
8.5.25 Invertebrate surveys were carried out by BSG Ecology for moths, beetles, and 
aquatic macroinvertebrates (in ponds and watercourses).  There is no habitat with 
the potential to support marsh fritillary within the Project Site Boundary and they are 
considered to be absent from the survey area.  
8.5.26 Only one pond was sampled by BSG Ecology within the Project Site Boundary 
(Pond 16).  Thirty two different species were recorded during the pond survey.  The 
samples were generally dominated by Coleoptera (beetles), followed by Hemiptera 
(bugs). No scarce or threatened aquatic invertebrates were identified within the 
samples.

8.5.27 The watercourses were sampled and samples were analysed to at least family level 
as required to obtain a score for water quality for the watercourse sections 
sampled; where possible species were also recorded for completeness and so that 
any rare species collected would be identified.  The report did not highlight any rare 
species and concluded the watercourses were of generally good quality.  
8.5.28 Notable or Priority beetle, butterfly and moths species identified during the survey 
from within the Project Site Boundary are given in Table 8-11 below.  Thirteen 
Section 7 species of moth were recorded during the survey. Their habitat 
requirements fit with the habitats present within the Project Site Boundary, and as 
such it is likely they are present across the Project Site.

assessment and where access allowed seven ponds were subject to further 
surveys for GCN including eDNA analysis.  
8.5.31 No GCNs were recorded during the surveys and the eDNA analysis returned 
negative results for each of the ponds for GCN.  A number of the ponds were found 
to support common toads, smooth newts Lissotriton vulgaris, and/or palmate newts.  
8.5.32 The majority of the habitat suitable for supporting common amphibians is present in 
the south of the Project Site Boundary. The dominance of improved grassland fields 
with fenced boundaries in the north limits the suitability of the area for supporting 
amphibians.  
8.5.33 It is considered unlikely that GCN will be present within any of the ponds that were 
not surveyed or within 500 m of these ponds in surrounding habitat given the 
absence of GCN from all nearby ponds surveyed.  The development will require the 
removal of three ponds (Ponds 16, 22 and 23).  Pond 22 currently supports 
palmate newts and is likely to support other amphibians including frogs and toads

as well as a range of common aquatic invertebrates.  Pond 16 was dry. Pond 23 
could not be assessed but if it contains water has the potential to support common 
amphibians.  
iii. Reptiles 
8.5.34 The desk study confirmed the presence of slow-worm Anguis fragilis, grass snake 
Natrix helvetica helvetica, adder Vipera berus and common lizard Zootoca vivipara 
within 2 km, and the presence of grass snake and common lizard within the Project 
Site Boundary.  
8.5.35 During the 2017 reptile survey, a total of 51 adult and juvenile common lizard 
observations were recorded, with a peak count of six adults recorded on one 
survey visit.  Observations of common lizard were recorded from across the reptile 
survey area within the Project Site Boundary.  The majority of records were from 
the verges either side of the grassy track running through the centre of the Project 
Site and from the semi-improved neutral grassland present around the National 
Grid site.  
8.5.36 During the course of the reptile survey, male, female, and juvenile common lizards 
were recorded, which confirmed that there was a breeding population present 
within the Project Site Boundary.  
8.5.37 Based on the survey results and the criteria laid out in Froglife Advice Sheet 10 
(Ref. 8.8), the Site supports a ‘Good population’ of common lizard.  
8.5.38 The Project Site does not meet the criteria for a ‘Key Reptile Site’.  
8.5.39 No grass snakes were identified within the 2017 reptile survey area including the 
area with the highest abundance during the 2014 surveys.  However, there is the 
potential for grass snake to be present within the Project Site Boundary and to have 
gone unrecorded since:  
 
Grass snake are wide ranging;  
 
Pond 16, where the majority of the 2014 records were from, was mostly dry 
throughout the 2017 reptile survey period, making the areas less suitable for 
supporting grass snake; and,  
 
The area in the north of the reptile survey area where grass snake was 
recorded in 2014 could not be accessed for survey in 2017 due to grazing 
livestock.  
8.5.40 As such, it should be assumed grass snake is likely to be present at low densities 
within the Project Site Boundary and surrounding habitat.  
iv. Breeding Birds 
8.5.41 The BSG Ecology surveys identified nine Section 7 bird species (previously 
referred to as species of principal importance for nature conservation in S42 of the 
NERC Act 2006, now repealed by Environment (Wales) Act 2016) comprising 
cuckoo Cuculus canorus, grasshopper warbler Locustella naevia, dunnock Prunella 
modularis, house sparrow Passer domesticus, linnet Carduelis cannabina, lesser 
Abergelli ES 2018 – CHAPTER 8: ECOLOGY

AECOM 
8-54 
 
redpoll Acanthis cabaret, skylark Alauda arvensis, song thrush Turdus philomelos, 
and tree pipit Anthus trivialis were considered likely to breed on-site.  
8.5.42 All nine Section 7 species recorded are also red-listed species of conservation 
concern in Wales, with the exception of dunnock (which is amber-listed).  An 
additional seven amber-listed species, bullfinch Pyrrhula pyrrhula, mistle thrush 
Turdus viscivorus, meadow pipit Anthus pratensis, reed bunting Emberiza 
schoeniclus, common redstart Phoenicurus phoenicurus, whitethroat Sylvia 
communis and willow warbler Phylloscopus trochilis were also considered to have 
bred.  
8.5.43 No territories of species listed under Schedule 1 Part 1 of the Wildlife & 
Countryside Act 1981 (as amended) (Schedule 1 species) were recorded, although 
two Schedule 1 species were recorded during the surveys, as follows. A pair of red 
kite was recorded mobbing a peregrine falcon Falco peregrinus in May.  A pair of 
red kite was also recorded flying over the breeding bird survey area on the same 
survey day. Given the timing of the records, and that at least one pair were 
recorded during survey it is likely that red kite breed locally but that the single 
record of peregrine referred to a transient bird.  No evidence was found to suggest 
breeding of either species occurred within the breeding bird survey area during 
2014.  
8.5.44 The single breeding bird survey undertaken in 2017 revealed the same nine 
Section 7 bird species as recorded during the 2014 survey (cuckoo, grasshopper 
warbler, dunnock, house sparrow, linnet, lesser redpoll, skylark, song thrush and 
tree pipit). Nine further species listed on the Amber List were also recorded 
(bullfinch, common redstart, meadow pipit, mistle thrush, meadow pipit, reed 
bunting, stock dove, whitethroat and willow warbler) although no species listed on 
Schedule 1 were recorded within the Project Site Boundary. The survey results 
from 2017 are largely found to be in line with what was identified in 2014 and there 
is no significant difference in species breeding within the Project Site between the 
two surveys.  
8.5.45 A survey for goshawk was undertaken in February 2018 of habitats suitable for 
supporting the species and with the potential to be impacted by the Project. During 
the survey there were no observations of goshawk.  
v. Bats 
8.5.46 The desk study identified no sites designated for bats within 10 km of the Project 
Site Boundary.  The desk study confirmed the presence of the following species 
from within 2 km of the Project Site Boundary: Daubenton's Myotis daubentonii, 
Natterer's Myotis nattereri, Noctule Nyctalus noctule, pipistrelle species Pipistrellus 
sp., common pipistrelle Pipistrellus pipistrellus, soprano pipistrelle Pipistrellus 
pygmaeus, long-eared species Plecotus sp., brown long-eared Plecotus auritus 
and generic records of bat species Chiroptera. None of these records of bats were 
from within the Project Site.  
Abergelli ES 2018 – CHAPTER 8: ECOLOGY 
 
 
Prepared for:  Abergelli Power Limited  
AECOM 
8-55 
 
8.5.47 The desk study identified the following records of known roost sites within 2 km of 
the Project Site: 
 
A noctule tree roost approximately 1 km north-west of the Project Site 
Boundary; 
 
Common pipistrelle roost approximately 1.3 km east of the Project Site 
Boundary; 
 
A common pipistrelle roost approximately 1.8 km south-east of the Project Site 
Boundary; 
 
A common pipistrelle roost approximately 1 km southeast of the Project Site 
Boundary; 
 
A common pipistrelle roost approximately 1 km north-west of the Project Site 
Boundary; 
 
A soprano pipistrelle roost approximately 2 km south-west of the Project Site 
Boundary; 
 
A soprano pipistrelle roost approximately 2 km north-west of the Project Site 
Boundary; 
 
A long-eared bat and brown-long-eared bat  roost approximately 1.6 km east of 
the Project Site Boundary; and, 
 
A long-eared bat and brown long-eared bat roost approximately 1.1 km north-
west of the Project Site. 
8.5.48 The specific locations of the bat roosts are confidential.  
Bat Roosts 
8.5.49 There are no buildings suitable for supporting bats within the Project Site.  
8.5.50 Buildings adjacent to the Project Site were assessed. None of the buildings 
surveyed by AECOM in 2017 supported bat roosts. Previous surveys by BSG in 
2014 confirmed roosts in buildings not surveyed by AECOM in 2017 (Appendix 
8.8).   
 
AECOM Building 1:  Unknown Roost Status. Not surveyed by AECOM or BSG 
Ecology, Building is approximately 125m from the Project Site Boundary; 
 
AECOM Building 2:  Confirmed as a long-eared and pipistrelle roost by BSG in 
2014 (Appendix 8.8). Not surveyed by AECOM. It is approximately 120 m 
outside of the Project Site Boundary;  
 
AECOM Building 3:  No Roost; 
 
AECOM Building 4:  No Roost; 
 
AECOM Building 5:  No Roost; 
 
AECOM Building 6:  No Roost; 
 
AECOM Building 7:  Confirmed as a lesser horseshoe, long-eared and 
pipistrelle roost by BSG Ecology in 2014 (Appendix 8.8). To be surveyed by 
AECOM in May, June & July 2018. It is approximately 90 m outside of the 
Project Site Boundary; and, 
Abergelli ES 2018 – CHAPTER 8: ECOLOGY 
 
 
Prepared for:  Abergelli Power Limited  
AECOM 
8-56 
 
 
AECOM Building 8: Unknown Roost Status.  BSG Ecology internal inspection 
did not find evidence of bats but not all areas were accessible (Appendix 8.8). 
Due to the bat roost features identified by BSG Ecology an internal inspection 
only is not sufficient to determine if this building is being used as a bat roost. To 
be surveyed by AECOM in May, June & July 2018. The building is 
approximately 65 m outside of the Project Site Boundary. 
 
8.5.51 Tree 19 is a lone male or non-breeding female common pipistrelle summer roost.  
No other trees were identified as bat roosts. 
8.5.52 Safety investigations regarding the trial shaft (mining feature) have confirmed the 
location of the shaft and that it has been filled in. The adit was confirmed by the 
respective landowner as being present next to Building 4 and is an underground 
feature that has been capped and grass now covers the feature. Therefore, there is 
no likelihood of hibernating bats or any suitable bat habitat being present in the trial 
shaft or adit.  
Bat Activity – Walked Transects 
8.5.53 At least 10 species of bat were recorded foraging and/or commuting in close 
proximity of and within the Project Site.  The following species have been identified 
during bat surveys at the Project Site during the bat surveys undertaken in 2017: 
 
Lesser horseshoe; 
 
Common pipistrelle; 
 
Soprano pipistrelle; 
 
Nathusius’ pipistrelle; 
 
Mytois species (including those with characteristics of Daubenton’s and 
Natterer’s);; 
 
Noctule; 
 
Serotine; 
 
Long-eared species; and, 
 
Indeterminate species.  
8.5.54 Nathusius’ pipistrelle and serotine were not identified during the BSG 2014 activity 
transect surveys (Appendix 8.8).  Leisler’s bat was identified during the BSG 
Ecology 2014 activity transect surveys (Appendix 8.8) but was not identified during 
the 2017 transect surveys.  
8.5.55 Common and soprano pipistrelles were the most commonly recorded species in the 
Project Site during 2017.  Overall pipistrelle species comprised 86.8 % of all passes 
recorded on the transect surveys; they were also the most commonly recorded 
species during the emergence/re-entry surveys. Pipistrelle species comprised of 
89.5% of the passes recorded on the North Transect and 84.6% of the passes 
recorded on the South Transect.   
8.5.56 Pipistrelle species were similarly the most commonly recorded species during the 
BSG Ecology 2014 transects surveys (Appendix 8.8).  
Abergelli ES 2018 – CHAPTER 8: ECOLOGY 
 
 
Prepared for:  Abergelli Power Limited  
AECOM 
8-57 
 
8.5.57 Two passes of Nathusius’ pipistrelle were recorded during the July transect 
surveys, one record from the South Transect and one record from the North 
Transect, making up 0.2% of total bat passes.  
8.5.58 Overall Myotis species comprised 9.8% of the total calls recorded on the transect 
surveys. Myotis species comprised 7.7% of the passes recorded on the North 
Transect and 11.5% of the calls recorded on the South Transect  
8.5.59 Activity levels for Myotis species during the 2017 transects surveys were 
comparable with the activity levels recorded during the BSG Ecology 2014 transect 
surveys (Appendix 8.8).  
8.5.60 Overall noctule and serotine bats comprised 1.8% of the passes recorded on 
transect surveys. Noctule and serotine bats comprised of 1.9% of the passes 
recorded on the North Transect and 1.8% of the passes recorded on the South 
Transect.  BSG Ecology did not breakdown these species into percentages but 
figures are comparable between years.  
8.5.61 Long-eared and possible long-eared bat comprised a total of 0.5% of the passes 
recorded on the North Transect and 0.6% recorded on the South Transect surveys.  
BSG Ecology did not breakdown these species into percentages but figures are 
comparable between years. 
8.5.62 There was a single lesser horseshoe bat pass, recorded on the South Transect, 
equating to 0.2% of the total passes for the South Transect and 0.1% of the total 
passes for the Project Site.  This was recorded in August 2017.  BSG Ecology also 
recorded a single pass of lesser horseshoe on the South Transect.  
8.5.63 Higher levels of activity were recorded in the Southern Transect (513 bat passes; 
15.2 Bat Activity Index (BAI)), compared to the Northern Transect (427 bat passes, 
13. 2 BAI). The bat activity levels across the Project Site however are broadly 
similar. In total 940 bat passes were recorded.  
8.5.64 Bat activity was recorded across the Project Site (Figure 5.1). Vegetated stream or 
wet ditch corridors appear to be important for bats within the Project Site. The 
distribution of bat calls suggests the following general patterns of activity. This is a 
qualitative assessment only: 
 
Pipistrelle bats were recorded across the Project Site;  
 
Myotis Species showed some association with mature tree lines and/or areas 
near water; 
 
Noctule and Serotine bats were primarily recorded at height over open fields 
across the Project Site; 
 
Long-eared bats showed some association with mature tree lines and are 
focused more towards the centre and south-east of the Project Site.  The 
passes recorded are within approximately 315m to 700m of the BSG confirmed 
long-eared roost in Building 7 and approximately 270m and 850m of the BSG 
confirmed long-eared roost in Building 2; and 
Abergelli ES 2018 – CHAPTER 8: ECOLOGY

AECOM 
8-58 
 
 
The single lesser horseshoe was recorded on the South Transect along a 
mature tree line approximately 900 m south of the closest known lesser 
horseshoe roost in Building 2. 
8.5.65 Bat activity was recorded at the Project Site between June and October 2017.  Bat 
surveys for April and May are due to be undertaken in 2018 with the results to be 
included in an addendum in August 2018 for DCO examination,].  
8.5.66 August had the highest BAI for both transects.  The North Transect had a BAI of 8.5 
and the South Transect had a BAI of 4.8. 
8.5.67 For the North Transect, the second highest BAI was 7.0, both in June and July. 
8.5.68 For the South Transect, the second highest BAI was 3.0 in July and the third 
highest was 2.8 in October.   
8.5.69 Young bats are typically born in June and July and during August the young are 
starting to leave the roosts to fly and feed. October is part of the bat mating period 
and a time when bats are extensively foraging for food as they are looking to store 
fat for the winter hibernation period. The general ecology of bat species is likely to 
influence the temporal activity for the Project Site.  
Bat Activity – Static Detectors from June – October 2017 
8.5.70 One pass of Nathusius' pipistrelle was recorded at Lane 1 in June 2017 and one 
pass of Nathusius' pipistrelle at North 2 in October 2017, making up <0.1% of the 
total bat passes.  
8.5.71 One pass of Nathusius' pipistrelle was recorded during the BSG static detector 
surveys in 2014 at Location D8 (Appendix 8.8)).  Location D8 is in a similar area to 
the AECOM South 1.  Nathusius' pipistrelle were not identified during the BSG 
2014 activity transect surveys (Appendix 8.8).  
8.5.72 A total of 1881 Myotis bat passes, 5.6% of the total calls, were recorded during the 
static detector surveys. Myotis species were recorded in every month, with the 
highest level of activity recorded in July with BAI of 20.6, and the second highest 
level recorded in June with a BAI of 17.0. 
8.5.73 Some of the Myotis bat echolocation calls from the static detector surveys were 
considered to have characteristics of Bechstein's (85 passes), Brandt's (50 passes) 
and whiskered (87 passes). BSG did not identify Myotis to species level (ES 
Appendix 8.8).  
8.5.74 Noctule, serotine and Leisler's (N/S/L) bats comprised 0.4% of the passes recorded 
during the static detector surveys.  
8.5.75 Noctule, serotine and Leisler's were recorded during the BSG 2014 static detector 
surveys Serotine were not identified during the BSG 2014 activity transect surveys 
(ES Appendix 8.8).  
Abergelli ES 2018 – CHAPTER 8: ECOLOGY 
 
 
Prepared for:  Abergelli Power Limited  
AECOM 
8-59 
 
8.5.76 Long-eared bats comprised 0.1% of the passes recorded during the static detector 
surveys.  
8.5.77 A total of 14 lesser horseshoe passes were recorded during the static detector 
survey:  
 
Three passes recorded in July; one pass at South 3 and two passes at Lane 3; 
 
Eight passes recorded in August; six passes at South 2, one pass at South 3 
and one pass at Lane 1:  
 
Two passes in September:  one at Lane 1 and one at Lane 3; and,  
 
One pass in October at Lane 3.   
8.5.78 BSG recorded a single lesser horseshoe pass at Location D3 (ES Appendix 8.8), 
which is in a similar area to AECOM South 3.   
8.5.79 A single greater horseshoe pass was recorded at Lane 2 in July during the static 
detector surveys. BSG recorded two greater horseshoe passes in 2014, in 
Locations D5 and D8 (ES Appendix 8.8). Location D5 was located along the 
Gallops near to Abergelli Farm and is not comparable with any of the AECOM 
locations as this is outside of the Project Site Boundary.  Location D8 is relatively 
close to AECOM South 1.  
8.5.80 In total 33,764 bat passes were recorded during the static detector surveys.  Table 
1.22 gives the bat activity by the Static Detector Location Groups. Higher levels of 
activity were recorded in the Southern Static Detector Locations (7,779 total bat 
passes; 148.2 BAI), compared to the Northern Static Detector Locations (5,847total 
bat passes, 87.3 BAI), reflecting the pattern of the walked transect. 
8.5.81 Using the first night data from static detector surveys, the species richness 
recorded across different locations was not statistically significant. Therefore, 
similarly to the walked transect results, the bat activity levels between North and 
South are broadly similar.  
8.5.82 The highest level of activity was recorded in the Lane Static Detector Locations 
(20,138 total bat passes, 372.9 BAI). The Lane Static Detector Locations (even with 
the equipment malfunctions, see Limitations) had higher levels of activity compared 
to both the North and South Static Detector Locations combined. This may be 
because the Lane is likely used for foraging, along the sheltered woodland edge, 
and detectors may have been recording multiple passes by the same bats up and 
down the Lane.  
8.5.83 The distribution of bat echolocation calls detected during the static detector surveys 
suggests the following general patterns of activity. This is a qualitative assessment 
only:  
 
Pipistrelle bats were recorded across the Project Site;  
 
Myotis species were recorded across the Project Site; 
 
Noctule, Serotine and Leisler bats were recorded across the Project Site;  
 
Long-eared bats were recorded at the majority of Static Detector Location 
except for North 1 and Lane 2;  
Abergelli ES 2018 – CHAPTER 8: ECOLOGY

AECOM 
8-60 
 
 
The single greater horseshoe was recorded at Lane 2 in the south-west of the 
Project Site; and, 
 
Lesser horseshoe bats were recorded within the south and south-west of the 
Project Site at South 2, South 3, Lane 1 and Lane 2.  
Bat Activity – Temporal Distribution 
8.5.84 Bat activity was recorded at the Project Site between June and October 2017.  Bat 
surveys for April and May are due to be undertaken in 2018.  
8.5.85 August had the highest BAI for both transects.  The North Transect had a BAI of 8.5 
and the South Transect had a BAI of 4.8. 
8.5.86 For the North Transect, the second highest BAI was 7.0, both in June and July. 
8.5.87 For the South Transect, the second highest BAI was 3.0 in July and the third 
highest was 2.8 in October.   
8.5.88 For the static detector surveys, July had the highest BAI of 377.3, the second 
highest BAI was 238.9 in June.  
8.5.89 Higher levels of Myotis species activity in June and July during the 2017 static 
detector surveys were comparable with the higher activity levels recorded in June 
and July during the BSG 2014 static detector surveys, although it should be noted 
that BSG did not have any static detectors placed within the lane area to the west 
of the Project Site.   
8.5.90 The statistical analysis of the first night of static detector data showed that bat 
species richness is influenced by month. August and October had a statistically 
significant greater species richness than September.  
8.5.91 The statistical analysis of the first night of static detector data showed that bat 
passes is influenced by month. June has a significantly higher bat echolocation call 
frequency than August and October. This result differs from the walked transect 
results which showed highest level of bat activity in July and June as the second 
highest. Both survey methods indicate that the summer months had the highest 
level of activity. This is likely due to general bat ecology, with bats being most active 
in mid-summer.  
8.5.92 Young bats are typically born in June and July and during August the young are 
starting to leave the roosts to fly and feed. October is part of the bat mating period 
and a time when bats are extensively foraging for food as they are looking to store 
fat for the winter hibernation period. The general ecology of bat species is likely to 
influence the temporal activity for the Project Site.  
8.5.93 The species composition, pattern of activity and temporal distribution are broadly 
similar between the 2014 survey and 2017 survey. It is considered likely that the 
surveys in April and May 2018 will provide similar results and the valuation of the 
feature (bat species) will remain the same (Table 8.13).

8.5.94 An addendum to this ES will be provided in August 2018 once the survey data from 
April and May 2018 is available.  
vi. Dormouse 
8.5.95 No records of dormouse were returned from the local records centre.  No evidence 
of dormouse was identified during the field surveys.  
vii. Water Vole 
8.5.96 No records of water vole were returned during the desk study.  
8.5.97 Four watercourses that had potential for supporting water vole were recorded within 
the water vole survey area.  Two of these had limited potential for water vole due to 
the relative isolation of these watercourses within the landscape (i.e. not connected 
to watercourses with potential to support water vole).  Burrows suitable for water 
vole were found but there was no evidence of current occupancy.  It was therefore 
not possible to determine if the burrows had been excavated by brown rat or water 
vole. It is likely that water vole is absent from the water vole survey area.  
viii. Otter 
8.5.98 A total of thirteen watercourses within the otter survey area were suitable for 
supporting commuting otter and two watercourses were suitable for supporting 
foraging otter, holt and couch creation.  One potential couch was identified with a 
trampled vegetation track leading to it which suggested occasional use by a 
mammal.  Two mammal tracks were identified; these may have been fox or another 
mammal.  No spraints, holts, footprints, anal jelly or other signs were identified 
during the otter surveys.  
8.5.99 One couch and slide next to a watercourse with a pathway leading from an area of 
marshy grassland, and feeding remains and a spraint were identified during the 
badger survey.  These were recorded outside of the otter survey area but adjacent 
to a watercourse that flows through and immediately adjacent to the Project Site 
Boundary.  
8.5.100 Due to the confirmed presence of otter upstream from the Project Site in 2015, the 
presence of spraints and a footprint from a nearby pond in May 2017 and the 
presence of a couch, slide pathway, feeding remains and a spraint from a 
watercourse that flows through and immediately adjacent to the Project Site 
Boundary it can be concluded that otters are still active in the locality.  As such it is 
likely that otters use the suitable watercourses within the otter survey area and 
Project Site Boundary for occasional forging, commuting, resting and holt creation; 
although no evidence of holts was identified during the survey.  
ix. Brown Hare 
8.5.101 No records of brown hare Lepus europaeus were returned from the local records 
centre.  
Abergelli ES 2018 – CHAPTER 8: ECOLOGY

AECOM 
8-62 
 
8.5.102 Sightings of brown hare were made during surveys for other species. A targeted 
survey for brown hare was not undertaken.  
8.5.103 Scrub, woodland edge and grassland habitat present throughout the Project Site 
Boundary are suitable for supporting the species.  
x. Badger 
8.5.104 A number of badger records were returned from the local records centre, including:  
 
Adjacent to the Project Site Boundary, near to the Felindre Gas Compressor 
Station site; 
 
350 m south; 
 
Penllergaer Valley Woods; 
 
1 km south; 
 
1.4 km south; and, 
 
1.5 km north.  
8.5.105 The badger survey area contains suitable habitat for supporting badgers. The 
scrub, woodland edge and grassland habitat present throughout the Project Site 
Boundary are suitable for supporting the species. A total of five badger setts were 
recorded during the survey (one of which was immediately adjacent to the Project 
Site Boundary and the other four were well outside of the Project Site Boundary).  
8.5.106 The survey identified signs of badger actively using the Project Site. Badger signs 
recorded included latrines, dung pits and mammal paths. It is therefore likely that 
badger use the Project Site on a regular basis for foraging and to commute 
between foraging areas within the wider landscape. 
 Evaluation of Ecological Features 
g)

Embedded Mitigation 
8.6.1 
As detailed in Chapter 3: Project and Site Description, a number of embedded 
mitigation measures have been identified through the iterative EIA process and 
have been incorporated into the design and construction planning of the Project.  
8.6.2 
As these mitigation measures have been embedded into the design, are legal 
requirements or are standard practices that will be implemented, the assessment of 
effects assumes that they are in place.

Assessment of Effects 
8.7.1 
This section presents the findings of the ecological assessment for the construction 
phase, operation and maintenance phase and the decommissioning phase of the 
Project.

i. 
Statutory Designated Sites 
8.7.4 
There is a hydrological link between the Project Site and Carmarthen Bay SAC and 
Burry Inlet SPA and Ramsar via the Afon Llan. There are springs, with their 
associated streams and drainage ditches within the Project Site which discharge 
into the Afon Llan. The Afon Llan links with the Afon Lliw and the River Loughor. 
The Afon Llan flows for approximately 12 km before reaching the designated sites.  
8.7.5 
Discharges into to Afon Llan or any other watercourses linking to the Afon Llan will 
be controlled via various measures as outlined in the embedded mitigation.  The 
embedded mitigation covers drainage and following best practice and guidelines, 
controlling pollution, storage of potential pollutants, and precautionary measures 
will help to limit the likelihood and effects of pollution incidents and/or runoff.  
Discharges will not perceptively increase the flow of the Afon Llan.  
8.7.6 
There are considered to be no effects on statutory designated sites with regards to 
water discharges due to the Site preparation works and embedded mitigation 
measures, in addition to the large dispersal distance within the Afon Llan from the 
Project Site to the designated sites.  
8.7.7 
Transport related emissions are most relevant to sites within 200 m of a major road. 
The Design Manual for Roads and Bridges (DMRB) identifies 200 m as the 
distance beyond which the contribution of traffic emissions to local pollutant 
concentrations is considered to be negligible.  Crymlyn Bog SAC and Ramsar, 
Carmarthen Bay SAC, and Burry Inlet SPA and Ramsar are all within 200 m of a 
major road; there are no roads within 200 m of any of these statutory sites that are 
forecast to receive anything other than a nominal change in vehicle flows as a 
result of this Project.  There are no roads within 200 m of Nant Y Crimp SSSI. 
There are considered to be no effects associated with transport-related emissions 
generated during construction and therefore no additional mitigation is required.  
8.7.8 
There are considered to be no additional effects on statutory designated sites in 
relation to the construction of the Project due to the distances between the Project 
and the site and the lack of pathways between the Project and the sites and 
therefore no additional mitigation is required.  
ii. Non-Statutory Designated Sites 
8.7.9 
The embedded mitigation within the CEMP (Appendix 3.1) will control movement of 
people, vehicles and machinery on to and around the Project Site during the 
construction phase and to help prevent the degradation and destruction associated 
with increased foot traffic, trampling and/or tracking over of retained non-statutory 
designated site habitat.  
8.7.10 As detailed in Section 8.7 (a)(i), all non-statutory designated sites within 200 m of 
the Project Site Boundary are greater than 200 m from a major road. There are 
deemed expected to be no effects associated with transport-related emissions 
generated during construction.

8.7.11 As defined by the Institute of Air Quality Management (IAQM) guidance, ecological 
receptors should be considered within 50 m of potential dust sources and 50 m of 
the routes used by construction vehicles on the public highway, up to 500 m from 
the Project Site entrance. The following non-statutory designated sites are present 
within 500 m of the Project Site entrance to the north: Rhos Fawr SINC, Rhyd-Y-
Pandy Valley and Grasslands SINC, Waun Garn Wen SINC, Coed Barcud Wildlife 
Trust Reserve, Ancient Woodland 11; and within 500 m of the Project Site entrance 
to the south: Cefn Forest Steam SINC, Felindre Grasslands SINC, Lletty-Morfil 
SINC, Ancient Woodland 6, Ancient Woodland 12. Part of the Power Generation 
Plant construction site falls within the Lletty-Morfil SINC. There are no additional 
non-statutory designated sites within 50 m of the construction routes or potential 
dust sources.  
8.7.12 Indirect impacts on the sites listed above (Table 8-15) from dust generation have 
been considered but vehicle flows on the access route and Access Road will be 
temporary and little dust generation is expected, particularly given the embedded 
mitigation with regards to measures for controlling dust generation which could 
include wetting of the Access Road if needed. Moreover these impacts are 
reversible as soon as construction ceases. There are expected to be no effects 
associated with dust generated during construction requiring additional mitigation.  
8.7.13 The embedded mitigation with regards to following good practice and guidelines, 
controlling pollution, storage of potential pollutants, and precautionary measures 
will help to limit the likelihood and effects of pollution incidents and/or runoff; and 
the embedded mitigation with regards to measures for controlling dust will help to 
limit the likelihood of increases of nutrient inputs non-statutory designated site 
habitats.  
8.7.14 There are no designated features within the non-statutory designated sites that are 
sensitive to lighting. Construction-related lighting on non-statutory designated sites 
has not been considered any further.  
8.7.15 For woodlands with root protection zones within the Project Site Boundary the 
embedded mitigation for all retained trees to be protected from any damage in 
accordance with BS5837:2012 Trees in Design, Demolition and Construction, 
Recommendations will help protect trees, scrub, woodland and hedgerows within 
non-statutory designated sites from direct damage and implement root protection 
zones.  
8.7.16 There will be loss of Lletty-Morfil SINC habitats and Ancient Woodland habitat, as 
detailed below. There will be no loss of habitat within the other non-statutory 
designated sites.  
Lletty-Morfil SINC 
8.7.17 During the construction of the Power Generation Plant there will be a permanent 
loss of 0.43 ha (representing 1.20% of total Lletty-Morfil SINC area – 36 ha) of 
Lletty-Morfil SINC comprising 0.26 ha of broadleaved semi-natural woodland and 
0.17 ha of marshy grassland. The SINC is considered to be of medium sensitivity 
Abergelli ES 2018 – CHAPTER 8: ECOLOGY 
 
 
Prepared for:  Abergelli Power Limited  
AECOM 
8-72 
 
with the extent of habitat loss being a medium magnitude, therefore resulting in a 
Moderate effect. This is considered to be significant.  
8.7.18 During construction of the Gas Connection there will be a temporary loss of 0.36 m2 
(<0.01%) of Lletty-Morfil SINC comprising broadleaved semi-natural woodland. 
Given the same sensitivity as above, the extent of habitat loss is considered to 
negligible magnitude, therefore resulting in a Negligible effect. This is not 
considered to be significant and therefore no further mitigation is required.  
Middle Llan SINC, Pant Lasau SINC and Ancient Woodland 4 
8.7.19 There is a hydrological link between the Project Site and Middle Llan SINC, Pant 
Lasau SINC and Ancient Woodland 4 via the Afon Llan. There are springs, with 
their associated streams and drainage ditches within the Project Site which 
discharge into the Afon Llan. The Afon Llan flows through each of these sites.  
8.7.20 Discharges into Afon Llan or any other watercourses linking to the Afon Llan will be 
controlled via various measures as outlined in the embedded mitigation.  The 
embedded mitigation covers drainage and following best practice and guidelines, 
controlling pollution, storage of potential pollutants, and precautionary measures 
will help to limit the likelihood and effects of pollution incidents and/or runoff.  
Discharges will not perceptively increase the flow of the Afon Llan.  
8.7.21 There are considered to be no effects on non-statutory designated sites with 
regards to water discharges due to the Site preparation works and embedded 
mitigation measures.  
Ancient Woodland 2 and Ancient Woodland 6 
8.7.22 Ancient Woodland is shown to be present over non-wooded habitats such as open 
grassland, hard standing and buildings.  The habitat loss calculations for Ancient 
Woodland have only considered those areas which are wooded.  
8.7.23 The location of the new section of Access Road seeks to avoid Ancient Woodland 
2. No habitat loss is anticipated for Ancient Woodland 6 with regards to the 
widening of the existing Access Road. There is no affect on Ancient Woodland as a 
result of the avoidance measures.  
iii. Habitats 
8.7.24 The embedded mitigation for a CEMP (Appendix 3.1) will control movement of 
people, vehicles and machinery on to and around the Project Site during the 
construction phase and to help prevent the degradation and destruction associated 
with increased foot traffic, trampling and/or tracking over of retained habitats.  
8.7.25 As detailed in Section 8.7 (a)(i), all habitats within the Project Site Boundary are 
greater than 200 m from a major road. There are expected to be no effects 
associated with transport-related emissions generated during construction.  
Abergelli ES 2018 – CHAPTER 8: ECOLOGY 
 
 
Prepared for:  Abergelli Power Limited  
AECOM 
8-73 
 
8.7.26 For reasons given in Section 8.7 (a)(ii), indirect impacts on the sites from dust 
generation have been considered but vehicle flows on the access route and Access 
Road will be temporary and little dust generation is expected, particularly given the 
embedded mitigation with regards to measures for controlling dust generation 
which could include wetting of the Access Road if needed. Moreover these impacts 
are reversible as soon as construction ceases. There are deemed to be no effects 
associated with dust generated during construction requiring additional mitigation.  
8.7.27 The embedded mitigation with regards to following best practice and guidelines, 
controlling pollution, storage of potential pollutants, and precautionary measures 
will help to limit the likelihood and effects of pollution incidents and/or runoff; and 
the embedded mitigation with regards to measures for controlling dust will help to 
limit the likelihood of increases of nutrient inputs on retained habitats.  
8.7.28 The embedded mitigation for all retained trees to be protected from any damage in 
accordance with BS5837:2012 Trees in Design, Demolition and Construction, 
Recommendations will help protect trees, scrub and hedgerows from direct 
damage and implement root protection zones.  
8.7.29 Where habitats are present within designated sites (for example, Lletty-Morfil 
SINC), the habitat loss calculations have been undertaken for the designated site 
only so as to not falsely over-represent habitat loss. A breakdown of habitat types to 
be removed has been provided for the designated sites above.  
Broadleaved Woodland – Semi-Natural and Broadleaved Woodland – Plantation 
8.7.30 During the construction of the Power Generation Plant there will be a permanent 
loss of 0.79 ha of broadleaved semi-natural woodland and a permanent loss of 0.02 
ha of broadleaved plantation woodland.  Due to the small area and isolated nature 
of the habitats to be removed habitat loss is afforded Low magnitude resulting in a 
Minor effect. Loss of broadleaved semi-natural woodland habitat is not considered 
a significant effect and therefore no additional mitigation is required.  
8.7.31 There is no requirement to remove broadleaved semi-natural woodland habitat or 
broadleaved plantation woodland for the Gas Connection and Electrical Connection 
elements of the Project.  
Dense/Continuous Scrub 
8.7.32 During the construction of the Power Generation Plant there will a permanent loss 
of 0.18 ha of dense/continuous scrub.  
8.7.33 During the construction of the Gas Connection there will be a temporary loss of 
0.02 ha of dense/continuous scrub.  
8.7.34 During the construction of the Electrical Connection there will be a temporary loss 
of 54 m2 of dense/continuous scrub.  
8.7.35 Due to the small area and isolated nature of the habitats to be removed habitat loss 
is afforded Low magnitude resulting in a Negligible effect.  Loss of dense-

loss of approximately 530 m of the row of trees habitat and a temporary loss of 40 
m for laydown areas.  
8.7.37 During the construction of the Gas Connection there will be a temporary loss of 
approximately 350 m of the row of trees habitat.  
8.7.38 During the construction of the Electrical Connection there will be a temporary loss 
of approximately 15 m of the row of trees habitat.  
8.7.39 Loss of this habitat type will reduce connectivity across the Project Site and to the 
wider landscape.  Although there is an abundance of this habitat type within the 
Project Site Boundary and wider landscape the loss of this habitat may have a long 
term effect on species utilising the habitat.  As such this habitat loss for each 
element is afforded High magnitude resulting in a Moderate effect for each 
element.  Loss of the row of trees habitat is therefore a significant effect and will 
require additional mitigation for each element.  
Standalone Trees 
8.7.40 During the construction of the Power Generation Plant there will potentially be a 
loss of up to two standalone trees.  
8.7.41 During the construction of the Gas Connection there will potentially be a loss of up 
to two standalone trees.  
8.7.42 During the construction of the Electrical Connection there will potentially be a loss 
of up to one standalone tree.  
8.7.43 The trees are located on the edge of the Project Site Boundary, and as such 
construction works may be able to avoid removing them. There is an abundance of 
this habitat type within the Project Site Boundary and wider landscape. Habitat loss 
is afforded Medium magnitude resulting in a Minor effect. Loss of standalone trees 
is not considered a significant effect and therefore no additional mitigation is 
required.  
Semi-Improved Neutral Grassland 
8.7.44 During the construction of the Power Generation Plant there will be a permanent 
loss of 0.65 ha and a temporary loss of 0.15 ha for laydown areas of semi-improved 
neutral grassland.  
8.7.45 During the construction of the Gas Connection there will be a temporary loss of 
1.02 ha of semi-improved neutral grassland.

8.7.46 During the construction of the Electrical Connection there will be a temporary loss 
of 0.07 ha of semi-improved neutral grassland.  
8.7.47 There is an abundance of this habitat type within the Project Site Boundary and 
wider landscape.  Habitat loss is afforded Medium magnitude resulting in a minor 
effect.  Loss of semi-improved neutral grassland is therefore not a significant effect 
and therefore no additional mitigation is required.  
Marshy Grassland 
8.7.48 During the construction of the Power Generation Plant there will a permanent loss 
of 1.45 ha loss and a temporary loss of 1.94 ha for laydown areas of marshy 
grassland. There is an abundance of this habitat type within the Project Site 
Boundary and wider landscape.  Habitat loss is afforded Medium magnitude 
resulting in a Moderate effect.  Loss of marshy grassland is therefore a significant 
effect and will require additional mitigation.  
8.7.49 During the construction of the Gas Connection there will be a temporary loss of 
0.01 ha of marshy grassland. Due to the small area of the habitat to be temporarily 
removed habitat loss is afforded Low magnitude resulting in a Negligible effect.  
Loss of marshy grassland is not considered a significant effect and therefore no 
further mitigation is required.  
8.7.50 During the construction of the Electrical Connection there will be a temporary loss 
of 0.15 ha of marshy grassland. Due to the small area of the habitat to be 
temporarily removed habitat loss is afforded Low magnitude resulting in a 
Negligible effect.  Loss of marshy grassland is not considered a significant effect 
and therefore no further mitigation is required.  
Running Water 
8.7.51 During the construction of the Power Generation Plant and the Gas Connection 
there is shown to be a loss of the running water habitat; however, cut off drainage 
ditches will be placed around the uphill perimeter of the Project Site. These new 
drainage ditches will be designed to carry the surface runoff around the Project Site 
and downstream back to the original drainage ditches/watercourses; and existing 
field drainage that will cross the Access Road will be culverted or bridged for a 
short length.  Overall there will be no loss of running water habitat and therefore the 
effect is Negligible and no mitigation is required.  
8.7.52 The embedded mitigation with regards to the CEMP (Appendix 3.1), following best 
practice and guidelines, controlling pollution and runoff, sediment loads, storage of 
potential pollutants, and precautionary measures will help to limit the likelihood and 
effects of pollution incidents and/or runoff, and control dust and sediment loads on 
aquatic habitats. 
Running Water – Afon Llan 
8.7.53 Discharges into Afon Llan or any other watercourses linking to the Afon Llan will be 
controlled via various measures as outlined in the embedded mitigation.  The 
Abergelli ES 2018 – CHAPTER 8: ECOLOGY

AECOM 
8-76 
 
embedded mitigation covers drainage and following best practice and guidelines, 
controlling pollution, storage of potential pollutants, and precautionary measures 
will help to limit the likelihood and effects of pollution incidents and/or runoff.  
Discharges will not perceptively increase the flow of the Afon Llan and as such 
there will be no scouring of the watercourse. Effect on Afon Llan is Negligible and 
no mitigation is required.  
Standing Water 
8.7.54 The Power Generation Plant component of the Project will require the removal of 
standing water – Pond 16 and Pond 22. Pond 16 is temporal and Pond 22 holds 
water year round.  
8.7.55 The construction of the Gas Connection may require the removal of Pond 23. Pond 
23 holds water year round.  Pond 23 is on the edge of the Project Site Boundary 
and it may be possible that construction works can avoid the pond.  
8.7.56 Although there is an abundance of this habitat type within the Project Site Boundary 
and wider landscape, the loss of this habitat may have a long term effect on 
species utilising the habitat.  Habitat loss is afforded Medium magnitude resulting in 
a Moderate effect.  Loss of standing water is therefore a significant effect and will 
require additional mitigation.  
8.7.57 The embedded mitigation with regards to the CEMP (Appendix 3.1), following best 
practice and guidelines, controlling pollution and runoff, sediment loads, storage of 
potential pollutants, and precautionary measures will help to limit the likelihood and 
effects of pollution incidents and/or runoff, and control dust and sediment loads on 
aquatic habitats.  
Hedgerows – Species-Poor 
8.7.58 During the construction of the Power Generation Plant there will be a permanent 
loss of approximately 140 m of species-poor hedgerow habitat.  
8.7.59 During the construction of the Gas Connection there will be a temporary loss of 
approximately 180 m of hedgerow habitat.  
8.7.60 Loss of this habitat type will reduce connectivity across the Project Site and to the 
wider landscape.  Although there is an abundance of this habitat type within the 
Project Site Boundary and wider landscape the loss of this habitat may have a long 
term effect on species utilising the habitat.  As such this habitat loss is afforded 
Medium magnitude resulting in a Moderate effect.  Loss of the hedgerow habitat is 
therefore a significant effect and will require additional mitigation.  
Scattered Scrub, Hedgerows – Species-Rich and Tall Ruderal 
8.7.61 There will be no removal of scattered scrub, and tall ruderal vegetation. There are 
considered to be no significant effects requiring mitigation.

iv. Species 
Invertebrates 
8.7.62 The Power Generation Plant requires the permanent removal of: 
 
A small proportion  of Lletty-Morfil SINC (0.43 ha representing 1.20% of total 
Lletty-Morfil SINC area – 36 ha), this has the potential to have a limited impact 
on the Section 7 listed butterfly, wall due to loss of habitat;  
 
A proportion (0.5 ha) of broadleaved semi-natural woodland, this has the 
potential to have a limited impact on the two Nationally Scarce beetles through 
partial loss of a habitat;  
 
Running and standing water, this has the potential to have a limited impact on 
common species only; and, 
 
Marshy grassland, semi-improved neutral grassland, scrub, standing water, this 
has the potential to have an impact on the Section 7 species of moth and 
butterfly identified during the field surveys.  
8.7.63 The partial loss of a small proportion of the suitable invertebrate habitat available in 
the wider area is unlikely to have a long term effect on invertebrate species utilising 
the habitat. As such this habitat loss is afforded Low magnitude resulting in a Minor 
effect.  Loss of habitat is therefore not a significant effect and will not require 
additional mitigation.  
8.7.64 The Gas Connection requires the temporary removal of:  
 
A small proportion of Lletty-Morfil SINC (0.36m2), this is likely to have a 
negligible impact on the Section 7 listed butterfly, wall due to loss of habitat;  
 
Running and standing water, this has the potential to have a limited impact on 
common species only; and, 
 
Marshy grassland, semi-improved neutral grassland, scrub, standing water, this 
has the potential to have an impact on the Section 7 species of moth and 
butterfly identified during the field surveys.  
8.7.65 The Electrical Connection requires the temporary removal of marshy grassland, 
semi-improved neutral grassland and scrub, this has the potential to have an 
impact on the Section 7 species of moth and butterfly identified during the field 
surveys.  
8.7.66 Temporarily removed habitats will be reinstated once construction works are 
complete. Temporary habitat loss is afforded Low magnitude resulting in a Minor 
effect. Temporary loss of habitat is therefore not a significant effect and will not 
require additional mitigation.  
Amphibians 
8.7.67 The Power Generation Plant requires the permanent removal of standing water, 
scrub, broadleaved semi-natural woodland, species-poor hedgerows and semi-
improved neutral grassland and the temporary removal of semi-improved neutral 
grassland, marshy grassland and rows of trees.  
Abergelli ES 2018 – CHAPTER 8: ECOLOGY 
 
 
Prepared for:  Abergelli Power Limited  
AECOM 
8-78 
 
8.7.68 The Gas Connection requires the temporary removal of standing water (may be 
possible to avoid), scrub, semi-improved neutral grassland, marshy grassland, rows 
of trees and species-poor hedgerows.  
8.7.69 The Electrical Connection requires the temporary removal of a single tree, scrub, 
semi-improved neutral grassland, marshy grassland and rows of trees.  
8.7.70 Habitat removal has the potential to impact common amphibians due to the 
permanent and temporary reduction in suitable habitat, including permanent loss of 
suitable breeding habitat (standing water).  There is an abundance of suitable 
habitat within the Project Site Boundary and the wider landscape.  Loss of habitat is 
afforded Medium magnitude resulting in a Moderate effect.  Loss of habitat is 
therefore a significant effect and will require additional mitigation.  
8.7.71 During construction activities there is the potential for common amphibians to be 
injured or killed through removal of habitats.  Injury of killing of common amphibians 
is afforded Medium magnitude, resulting in a Moderate effect. Injury or killing is 
therefore a significant effect and will require additional mitigation.  
8.7.72 The embedded mitigation with regards to the CEMP (Appendix 3.1), following best 
practice and guidelines, controlling pollution and runoff, storage of potential 
pollutants, dust, and precautionary measures will help to limit the likelihood and 
effects of trampling, pollution incidents and/or runoff, and dust on terrestrial and 
aquatic habitats with the potential to support amphibians.  
Reptiles 
8.7.73 The Power Generation Plant requires the permanent removal of standing water, 
scrub, broadleaved semi-natural woodland, species-poor hedgerows and semi-
improved neutral grassland, and the temporary removal of semi-improved neutral 
grassland, marshy grassland and rows of trees.  
8.7.74 The permanent removal of habitats has the potential to impact reptiles due to the 
loss of breeding, sheltering and foraging habitat.  The loss of this habitat may have 
a long term effect on reptile species utilising the habitat.  As such this habitat loss is 
afforded Medium magnitude resulting in a Moderate effect.  Loss of reptile habitat 
is therefore a significant effect and will require additional mitigation.  
8.7.75 The Gas Connection requires the temporary removal of breeding, sheltering and 
foraging habitat (standing water (may be possible to avoid), scrub, semi-improved 
neutral grassland, marshy grassland, rows of trees and species-poor hedgerows). 
Habitats will be reinstated once works are complete.  Temporary habitats loss is 
afforded Low magnitude resulting in a Minor effect. Temporary loss of habitat is 
therefore not a significant effect and will not require additional mitigation.  
8.7.76 The Electrical Connection requires the temporary removal of breeding, sheltering 
and foraging habitat (a single tree, scrub, semi-improved neutral grassland, marshy 
grassland and rows of trees). Habitats will be reinstated once works are complete.  
Temporary habitats loss is afforded Low magnitude resulting in a Minor effect. 
Abergelli ES 2018 – CHAPTER 8: ECOLOGY 
 
 
Prepared for:  Abergelli Power Limited  
AECOM 
8-79 
 
Temporary loss of habitat is therefore not a significant effect and will not require 
additional mitigation.  
8.7.77 Although the works are temporary in these areas (Electrical Connection and Gas 
Connection), the loss of standing water and/or mature trees must be considered 
permanent due to the time required for mature trees to grow and the change in 
ground conditions making it unlikely for the pond (within the Gas Connection route) 
to reform without human intervention.  Therefore, permanent loss of standing water 
and/or trees for the Electrical Connection and Gas Connection is afforded Medium 
magnitude resulting in a Moderate effect for each of the elements. Habitat loss is 
therefore a significant effect and will require additional mitigation.  
8.7.78 During all construction activities there is the potential for reptiles to be injured or 
killed through removal of habitats. Injury of killing of reptiles is afforded High 
magnitude resulting in a Moderate effect; and is therefore a significant effect and 
will require additional mitigation.  
8.7.79 The embedded mitigation with regards to the CEMP (Appendix 3.1), following best 
practice and guidelines, controlling pollution and runoff, storage of potential 
pollutants, control of dust, and precautionary measures will help to limit the 
likelihood and effects of trampling, pollution incidents and/or runoff, and dust on 
habitats with the potential to support common reptiles. 
Breeding Birds 
8.7.80 The Power Generation Plant requires the permanent removal of habitat with the 
potential to support breeding birds (trees, woodland, hedgerows and scrub) and the 
temporary removal of habitat with the potential to support breeding birds (trees).  
8.7.81 The Gas Connection requires the temporary removal of habitat with the potential to 
support breeding birds (trees, woodland, hedgerows and scrub).  
8.7.82 The Electrical Connection requires the temporary removal of habitat with the 
potential to support breeding birds (trees).  
8.7.83 The removal of habitat with the potential to support breeding birds will reduce the 
availability of suitable breeding habitat within the Project Site Boundary.  However, 
there is an abundance of suitable habitat within the Project Site Boundary and 
wider landscape, and as such the loss of suitable breeding habitat within the 
Project Site Boundary is unlikely to have a long term significant effect on breeding 
bird populations.  Loss of habitat is afforded Low magnitude resulting in a Minor 
effect; and is therefore not a significant effect and will not require additional 
mitigation.  
8.7.84 During the winter months working within the core hours (08:00 – 18:00) will require 
night time illumination. There will be illumination of the security cabin (24 hour, 
seven days a week facility). Night time illumination of and construction noise in the 
vicinity of features with the potential to supporting nesting birds have the potential 
to cause localised disturbance to nesting birds.  Disturbance will be temporary and 
Abergelli ES 2018 – CHAPTER 8: ECOLOGY 
 
 
Prepared for:  Abergelli Power Limited  
AECOM 
8-80 
 
localised. Disturbance is afforded Low magnitude resulting in a Minor effect. As 
such disturbance is not significant and will not require additional mitigation.   
8.7.85 There will be temporary impacts as a result of noise generated during construction 
and this may cause disturbance to breeding birds. Birds have been shown to 
quickly adapt to changes in noise levels.  Noise levels for various type of 
construction equipment typically range from 55 dB to 83dB in the immediate vicinity 
of the equipment.  As such there will be localised disturbance to birds and the 
increases are not going to be significant enough to effect the distribution or activity 
of breeding species. All species recorded during surveys are tolerant of regular 
noise where habitat remains suitable as evidenced by the distribution of breeding 
species recorded alongside busy roads for example. Effects of noise will be 
temporary and localised. Noise is afforded Low magnitude, resulting in a Minor 
effect, and as such noise effects are not significant and will not require additional 
mitigation.  
8.7.86 The embedded mitigation with regards to the CEMP (Appendix 3.1), following best 
practice and guidelines, controlling pollution and runoff, storage of potential 
pollutants, and precautionary measures will help to limit the likelihood and effects of 
pollution incidents and/or runoff, and dust on habitats with the potential to support 
breeding birds.  
8.7.87 The embedded mitigation with regards the CEMP and protection of protected 
species during construction would include seeking to avoid vegetation removal 
during breeding bird season (breeding season March – September) wherever 
possible, or an ecologist examining the vegetation for active nests immediately 
prior to removal.  
Bats 
8.7.88 Based on the current known distribution of bat roosts within the Project Site, there 
is no risk of killing or injuring bats during construction.  
8.7.89 There is no potential for hibernating bats to be present within the mine trial shaft or 
adit.   
8.7.90 There is the potential for new roosts to be formed in trees previously identified as 
having potential to support roosting bats, but not confirmed as roosts during any of 
the surveys; there is the potential for new roosts to be disturbed, or bats to be 
injured or killed during construction. Disturbance, injury or killing is afforded High 
magnitude, resulting in a Major effect, and is considered a significant effect 
requiring further mitigation.  
8.7.91 The Power Generation Plant requires the permanent removal of habitat with the 
potential to support foraging and commuting bats (broadleaved semi-natural 
woodland, hedgerows, mature trees lines semi-improved grassland and marshy 
grassland).  Without mitigation, this will sever the connectivity to habitats either side 
of the Access Road, resulting in fragmentation of retained areas.  This will impact 
on bats using the existing features in the landscape to commute and forage 
Abergelli ES 2018 – CHAPTER 8: ECOLOGY

AECOM 
8-81 
 
between these two areas. There is an abundance of foraging habitat within the 
wider landscape, and as such loss of small amounts of foraging habitat is afforded 
Low magnitude; due to the High value of the receptor (bats) this is considered a 
significant effect (Moderate Adverse) requiring mitigation. Severance of 
connectivity and fragmentation is afforded Medium magnitude resulting in a 
Moderate effect; this is considered a significant effect requiring mitigation.  
8.7.92 The Gas Connection requires the temporary removal of habitat with the potential to 
support foraging and commuting bats (hedgerow, mature trees lines and woodland 
edges). There is potential for roosting bats to be present within Buildings 7 and 8, 
and potential for roosting bats to use linear features to cross the Project Site 
Boundary. Removal or severance of tree lines and hedgerow will sever the 
connectivity they provide and create fragmentation of retained habitat. This will 
impact on bats using the existing features in the landscape to commute and forage 
between these two areas. Severance of connectivity and fragmentation is afforded 
Medium magnitude, resulting in a Moderate effect; this is considered a significant 
effect requiring mitigation.  
8.7.93 The Electrical Connection requires the temporary removal of habitat with the 
potential to support foraging and commuting bats (mature trees lines). Removal or 
severance of tree lines will sever the connectivity they provide and create 
fragmentation of retained habitat. This will impact on bats using the existing 
features in the landscape to commute and forage between these two areas. 
Severance of connectivity and fragmentation is afforded Medium magnitude, 
resulting in a Moderate effect; this is considered a significant effect requiring 
mitigation. There will be an increase in external lighting at the Project Site during 
construction. There is currently no external lighting within the majority of the Project 
Site. Many species of bat are averse to light, with different species having different 
tolerances. External lighting can make areas of previous foraging habitat unsuitable 
and fragment commuting routes.  If external lighting for the Project is poorly 
designed there is potential for a light spill onto hedgerows, tree lines, woodland 
edges and vegetated areas which will negatively impact on bats, severing 
commuting routes and impeding access to foraging habitat. Poorly designed 
lighting also has the potential to affect areas outside the Project Site Boundary. 
During the winter months working within the core hours (08:00 – 18:00) will require 
night time illumination. There will be illumination of the security cabin (24hr, seven 
days a week facility). Night time illumination of and construction noise in the vicinity 
of features with the potential to supporting bats has the potential to cause localised 
disturbance to commuting or foraging.  The embedded mitigation measures with 
regards to lighting seek to limit impacts on bats. Effects from lighting as set out in 
the LEMP and Landscape and Ecology Mitigation Strategy (Figure 3.6 and 
Appendix 3.4) and in the Outline Lighting Strategy (Appendix 3.5) are afforded 
Negligible magnitude, resulting in a Minor effect. This is not considered a 
significant effect and does not require additional mitigation.  
8.7.94 The nearest known bat roost to the Project is approximately 90 m (300 feet) from 
the Gas Connection element; the nearest possible bat roost (yet to be surveyed) is 
Building 8 and 65 m (213 feet) from the Electrical Connection.  Noise dissipates at 
Abergelli ES 2018 – CHAPTER 8: ECOLOGY 
 
 
Prepared for:  Abergelli Power Limited  
AECOM 
8-82 
 
a rate of 6 dB with the doubling of the distance (in feet). Given the loudest 
equipment used during construction will be 90 dB, the noise will be imperceptible at 
the nearest known bat roost and in line with background noise (farm machinery and 
vehicles) at Building 8.  Similarly, vibration from construction equipment will not be 
perceptible at these distances.  Effects from noise and construction equipment 
vibration are afforded Negligible magnitude resulting in a Negligible effect. This is 
not considered a significant effect and does not require mitigation.  
8.7.95 The need for piling, and the type of any piling potentially required is not yet 
confirmed. Where piling, heavy earthworks, vibratory rollers or other significant 
vibration producing operations are proposed in close proximity to any existing 
sensitive receptors, further consideration would be given to potential impacts, once 
the contractor is appointed and the construction methods requirements are 
developed.   
Water Vole 
8.7.96 The Power Generation Plant is close to an area with potential for supporting water 
vole burrows (Watercourse 45). Although no recently occupied burrows were 
identified during the survey, it is possible that prior to construction new burrows are 
created in this area. There is the potential for this to cause disturbance of, harm or 
kill individual water voles during construction within 10 m of Watercourse 45. 
Disturbance, injury or killing are afforded High magnitude, resulting in a Moderate 
effect; and is therefore considered a significant effect and will require additional 
mitigation. 
8.7.97 There will be temporary impacts as a result of noise and vibration generated during 
construction and this may cause disturbance to water voles.  
8.7.98 The predicted noise level from construction equipment is expected to be a 
maximum of 90 dB 10 m from the source. The construction area at the boundary of 
the Power Generation Plant is between approximately 20 m (65 feet) and 80 m 
(260 feet) from the section of Watercourse 45 suitable for supporting water voles.  
In general background noise levels at watercourses are around 45 dB and noise 
dissipates at a rate of 6 dB with the doubling of the distance (in feet).  The noise 
would therefore be around 60 dB at the closest point to Watercourse 45.  
8.7.99 Water voles have been shown to quickly adapt to changes in noise levels and the 
occasional change in noise level is unlikely to be enough to deter water voles 
where Watercourse 45 is 20 m from the Power Generation Plant boundary. Further 
afield, as the noise level reduces in line to the background level it is likely that water 
voles will not be deterred from using these areas. Similarly, vibration from 
construction equipment will not be perceptible at this distance.   
8.7.100 Effects of noise will be temporary and localised. Noise and construction equipment 
vibration is afforded Low magnitude, resulting in a Negligible effect, and as such 
noise effects are not significant and will not require additional mitigation.

8.7.101 The need for piling, and the type of any piling potentially required is not yet 
confirmed. Where piling, heavy earthworks, vibratory rollers or other significant 
vibration producing operations are proposed in close proximity to any existing 
sensitive receptors, further consideration would be given to potential impacts, once 
the contractor is appointed and the construction methods requirements are 
developed.  
8.7.102 The embedded mitigation with regards to the CEMP (Appendix 3.1), following best 
practice and guidelines, controlling pollution and runoff, storage of potential 
pollutants, and precautionary measures will help to limit the likelihood and effects of 
pollution incidents and/or runoff, and control dust on aquatic habitats with the 
potential to support water vole.  
8.7.103 The embedded mitigation measures with regards to lighting and noise seeks to limit 
impacts on water vole.  
8.7.104 There are no effects associated with the Electrical Connection or Gas Connection 
on water vole requiring mitigation.  
Otter 
8.7.105 The Power Generation Plant is shown to be near areas deemed suitable for 
supporting otters (Watercourses 9, 11, 12, 41 and 45 and Watercourses 27, 28 and 
29, respectively). Although no recent activity was identified during the survey, it is 
possible that prior to construction new holts/couches are created or activity is 
present in this area. There is the potential to cause disturbance of otters during 
construction within 100 m of Watercourses 9, 11 12, 41 and 45 and Watercourses 
27, 28 and 29. There is the potential to harm or kill individual otters during 
construction within 10 m of Watercourses 9, 11 12, 41 and 45 and Watercourses 
27, 28 and 29.  Additionally, night time illumination in the vicinity of Watercourses 9, 
11 12, 41 and 45 and Watercourses 27, 28 and 29 has the potential to cause 
disturbance of otters. Disturbance, injury or killing are afforded High magnitude, 
resulting in a Moderate effect, and as such are considered significant effects and 
will require further mitigation.  
8.7.106 The predicted noise level from construction equipment is expected to be a 
maximum of 90 dB at a distance of 10 m from the source. The construction area at 
the boundary of the Power Generation Plant are between approximately 80 m (260 
feet) and immediately adjacent to Watercourses 9, 11, 12, 41 45 and the Access 
Road is immediately adjacent to Watercourses 27, 28 and 29.  In general 
background noise levels at watercourses are around 45 dB and noise dissipates at 
a rate of 6 dB with the doubling of the distance (in feet).  The noise would therefore 
be 90 dB at the closest point to the watercourses, and would dissipate to being 
imperceptible at about 40 m away.  
8.7.107 The increase in perceptible noise level is likely to be enough to deter otter.  
However, no evidence of otter was found to be using these areas and any effects 
will be temporary and localised. Further afield, as the noise level reduces in line 
with the background level it is likely that otters will not be deterred from using these 
Abergelli ES 2018 – CHAPTER 8: ECOLOGY

8-84 
 
areas.  Otters are known to use noisy areas (for example they are known to cross 
under busy roads) and will habituate to noise levels over time. Similarly, vibration 
from construction equipment will be perceptible only in the vicinity of the 
construction works.    
8.7.108 Effects of noise will be temporary and localised. Noise and construction equipment 
vibration is afforded Low magnitude, resulting in a Negligible effect, and as such 
noise effects are not significant and will not require additional mitigation.   
8.7.109 The need for piling, and the type of any piling potentially required is not yet 
confirmed. Where piling, heavy earthworks, vibratory rollers or other significant 
vibration producing operations are proposed in close proximity to any existing 
sensitive receptors, further consideration would be given to potential impacts, once 
the contractor is appointed and the construction method requirements are 
developed.  
8.7.110 The Gas Connection is near an area suitable for supporting otters (Watercourse 6). 
Although no recent activity was identified during the survey, it is possible that prior 
to construction new holts/couches are created or recent activity is present in this 
area. There is the potential for this to cause disturbance of otters during 
construction within 100 m of Watercourse 6. There is the potential to harm or kill 
individual otters during construction within 10 m of Watercourse 6.  Additionally, 
night time illumination and in the vicinity of Watercourse 6 have the potential to 
disturb otters. Disturbance, injury or killing are afforded High magnitude, resulting in 
a Moderate effect, and as such are considered significant effects and will require 
further mitigation.  
8.7.111 Construction noise and vibration at Watercourse 6 will be imperceptible since it is 
approximately 90 m (290 feet) from the Gas Connection. Noise and construction 
equipment vibration at the Gas Connection is afforded Negligible magnitude, and 
as such noise effects are not significant and will not require additional mitigation.   
8.7.112 The Electrical Connection is near areas suitable for supporting otters 
(Watercourses 27, 28 and 29). Although no recent activity was identified during the 
survey, it is possible that prior to construction new holts/couches are created or 
recent activity is present in this area. There is the potential to cause disturbance of 
otters during construction within 100 m of Watercourses 27, 28 and 29. There is the 
potential harm or kill individual otters during construction within 10 m of 
Watercourses 27, 28 and 29.  Disturbance, injury or killing are afforded High 
magnitude, resulting in a Moderate effect, and as such are considered significant 
effects and will require further mitigation.  
8.7.113 The effects of noise and vibration for the Electrical Connection will be the same as 
for the Access Road.  Effects of noise will be temporary and localised. Noise and 
construction equipment vibration is afforded Low magnitude, resulting in a 
Negligible effect, and as such noise effects are not significant and will not require 
additional mitigation.

8.7.114 The embedded mitigation with regards to the CEMP (Appendix 3.1), following best 
practice and guidelines, controlling pollution and runoff, storage of potential 
pollutants, and precautionary measures will help to limit the likelihood and effects of 
pollution incidents and/or runoff, and control dust on aquatic habitats with the 
potential to support otter.  
8.7.115 The embedded mitigation measures with regards to lighting and noise seeks to limit 
impacts on otter.  
Brown Hare 
8.7.116 The removal of grassland, broadleaved woodland and scrub habitats during 
construction of the Power Generation Plant and Gas Connection are unlikely to 
significantly impact local brown hare populations due to the abundance of this 
habitat type within the Project Site Boundary and the wider landscape.  Loss of 
habitat is afforded Low magnitude, resulting in a Negligible effect, and as such is 
not considered a significant effect and will not require further mitigation.  
8.7.117 All construction work has the potential to disturb, injure or kill breeding, sheltering 
and foraging brown hares. Disturbance, injury or killing are afforded Medium 
magnitude, resulting in a Minor effect, and as such are not considered significant 
effects and will not require further mitigation.  
Badger 
8.7.118 Currently no construction works impede on badger setts. However, it is possible 
that prior to construction new setts are created within 30 m of the construction 
areas. Any works, in particular heavy machinery and ground breaking works, that 
takes place within 30 m of an active badger sett has the potential to cause a 
collapse of a sett and disturb, harm or kill a badger.  Injury or killing are afforded 
High magnitude, resulting in a Moderate effect, and as such are considered 
significant effects and will require further mitigation.  
8.7.119 The excavation of open trenches to facilitate the Gas Connection may obstruct 
badgers from commuting across the Project Site and badgers may become trapped 
in open trenches or excavations. Trapping is afforded High magnitude, resulting in 
a Moderate effect, and is considered a significant effect. As such it will require 
further mitigation.  
8.7.120 Night time illumination in the vicinity of badger setts or foraging areas may deter 
badgers from using these areas and as such will be avoided. This is deemed to be 
of Negligible magnitude, resulting in a negligible effect, and not a significant effect 
requiring mitigation.   
8.7.121 There is the potential for disturbance of badger during construction due to 
increased noise.  The predicted noise level from construction equipment is 
expected to be a maximum of 90 dB 10 m from the source. The construction area 
at the boundary of the Power Generation Plant and Gas Connection is between 
Abergelli ES 2018 – CHAPTER 8: ECOLOGY 
 
 
Prepared for:  Abergelli Power Limited  
AECOM 
8-86 
 
approximately 100 m (330 feet) and 200 m (655 feet) from the active badger setts, 
and noise from construction equipment at these setts will be imperceptible.  
8.7.122 There are no changes to the existing road along the Access Track that will have 
any direct impacts on badgers, and any badgers in this area will already be 
habituated to vehicle noise and vibration. As such, post development there will be 
no impact on badgers in this area.  
8.7.123 Noise and vibration disturbance is afforded Negligible magnitude, resulting in a 
Negligible effect. This is not considered a significant effect and will not require 
further mitigation.  
8.7.124 Badgers using the Project Site for commuting and foraging are likely to be 
disturbed in the immediate vicinity of the construction works at night but are likely to 
habituate to the higher background noise over time.  The temporary increase in 
noise levels is not considered significant enough to deter them from returning. 
Therefore this effect is considered to be of Negligible magnitude, resulting in a 
Negligible effect. This is not considered a significant effect and will not require 
further mitigation.  
8.7.125 The removal of scrub, woodland edge and grassland habitat during construction of 
the Power Generation Plant and Gas Connection will reduce the availability of 
suitable habitat for badgers within the Project Site Boundary.  However, there is an 
abundance of suitable habitat within the Site Boundary and wider landscape, and 
as such the loss of suitable habitat within the Site Boundary is unlikely to have a 
long term significant effect on badger populations.  Loss of habitat is afforded Low 
magnitude, resulting in a Negligible effect; and is therefore not a significant effect 
and will not require additional mitigation.  
Invasive Species 
8.7.126 The potential for the construction of the Project to cause the spread of invasive 
species will be controlled due to the embedded mitigation to implement measures 
contained in relevant best practice guidance on the control and removal of invasive 
weed species, resulting in a Minor adverse effect; and is therefore not a significant 
effect and will not require additional mitigation.  
 Operation

i. 
Statutory Designated Sites 
8.7.127 The four statutory designated sites were scoped in for assessment of air quality 
effects relating to the Power Generation Plant component of the Project only. A 
Habitat Regulations Assessment Screening exercise was undertaken and report 
written (Ref. 8.5). The results of the air quality modelling (Chapter 6: Air Quality) 
show that the Project’s Process Contribution (PC) of NOx, and consequently the 
PC of nitrogen deposition and nitrogen acidity deposition are very small and so low 
as to be effectively zero (less than 0.01 kg/N/ha/yr and less than 0.01 keqH+/ha/yr, 
respectively). For all sites, the PC does not cause Critical Loads to be exceeded. In 
the case of Crymlyn Bog SAC and Ramsar site where the Critical Load for nitrogen 
Abergelli ES 2018 – CHAPTER 8: ECOLOGY 
 
 
Prepared for:  Abergelli Power Limited  
AECOM 
8-87 
 
and nitrogen acid is already in exceedance, the influence of nitrogen and nitrogen 
acid from the Project is not at a level where it would cause a significant effect. No 
project or plans were considered to have an in-combination effect with the Project 
associated with air quality- nitrogen and nitrogen acid deposition, as a result of NOx 
emissions from the Project. Effects in relation to air quality are considered 
Negligible and as such are not considered significant and will not require further 
mitigation.  
8.7.128 There is a hydrological link between the Project Site and Carmarthen Bay SAC and 
Burry Inlet SPA and Ramsar via the Afon Llan.  The Afon Llan flows for 
approximately 12 km before reaching the designated sites.  There are springs, with 
their associated streams and drainage ditches within the Project Site which 
discharge into the Afon Llan. The Project incorporates welfare facilities (two toilets) 
which will require a site foul water drainage system.  The foul water drainage 
system will either drain to a septic tank or a package treatment plant within the 
Project Site. During operation the Project will have a maximum of three shifts of five 
workers in a 24 hour period.  Due to the very small quantity of foul water generated 
during operation, it is anticipated that treated water can be discharged via 
infiltration (soakaway) on the Project Site. The foul water drainage system will be 
positioned to minimise the risk of inundation by floodwaters. Where there is an 
inadequate unsaturated zone beneath the Project Site, the option of discharging to 
local watercourses will be adopted. A manned site with discharges to local 
watercourses will contribute nitrogen to Carmarthen Bay SAC and Burry Inlet SPA 
and Ramsar. Any discharges will be subject to the Environmental Permitting 
Regulations and will need to meet quality criteria set by NRW.  
8.7.129 Chapter 9: Water Quality and Flood Risk states that due to the quantity of 
treated foul waste/wastewater likely to be generated from the packaged sewage 
treatment plant and dilution properties of these receiving receptors, the magnitude 
of pollution impacts from discharges is considered to be Negligible. Hence, the 
significance of effect on Carmarthen Bay SAC and Burry Inlet SPA and Ramsar is 
considered to be Negligible.  
8.7.130 As stated in Chapter 12: Traffic, Transport and Access the Project will employ 15 
permanent staff in shifts, which will likely generate 30 movements per day (two 
movements per staff member). A demineralised water trailer and diesel fuel tanker 
will visit the Project Site periodically.  Maintenance periods will occur annually. 
During these periods, there may be up to 40 additional staff on-site for a period of 
one month. Based on a vehicle occupancy level of 1.6, this will equate to an 
additional 50 movements per day (25 arrivals during the AM peak hour, 25 
departures during the PM peak hour).  Transport related emissions are most 
relevant to sites within 200 m of a major road. The DMRB (Ref. 8.17) identifies 
200m as the distance beyond which the contribution of traffic emissions to local 
pollutant concentrations is considered to be negligible.  Crymlyn Bog SAC and 
Ramsar, Carmarthen Bay SAC, and Burry Inlet SPA and Ramsar are all within 200 
m of a major road; there are no roads within 200 m of any of these statutory sites 
that are forecast to receive anything other than a nominal change in vehicle flows 
as a result of this Project.  There are no roads within 200 m of Nant Y Crimp SSSI.

8-88 
 
There are considered to be no effects associated with transport-related emissions 
generated during operation. There are considered to be no effects on statutory 
designated sites in relation to the Gas Connection or Electrical Connection 
components of the Project due to the distances between the Project and the 
designated sites and the lack of pathways between the Project and the designated 
sites.  
ii. Non-Statutory Designated Sites 
8.7.131 Thirty-four non-statutory designated sites (one Wildlife Trust Reserve, 11 SINCSs 
and 22 Ancient Woodlands) were scoped in for assessment of air quality effects 
relating to the Power Generation Plant component of the Project. The results of the 
air quality modelling (Chapter 6: Air Quality) show that the Project’s PC of NOx, 
and consequently the PC of nitrogen deposition and nitrogen acidity deposition are 
very small (less than 0.01 kg/N/ha/yr and less than 0.01 keqH+/ha/yr, respectively).  
For all sites, the PC does not cause Critical Loads for the most sensitive habitat 
type within the site to be exceeded. In the cases where the Critical Loads for 
nitrogen and nitrogen acidity are already in exceedance, the very slight increase in 
nitrogen or nitrogen acidity from the Project is not at a level where it would cause a 
significant effect. Effects in relation to air quality are considered Negligible and as 
such are not considered significant and will not require further mitigation.  
8.7.132 Transport related emissions are most relevant to non-statutory designated sites 
within 200 m of a major road. The DMRB identifies 200 m as the distance beyond 
which the contribution of traffic emissions to local pollutant concentrations is 
considered to be negligible.  All non-statutory designated sites within 200 m of a 
major road are not forecast to experience anything other than a nominal change in 
vehicle flows as a result of this Project. There are deemed to be no effects 
associated with transport-related emissions generated during operation.  
8.7.133 As defined by the IAQM guidance, ecological receptors should be considered within 
50 m of potential dust sources and 50 m of the routes used by vehicles on the 
public highway, up to 500 m from the Project Site entrance. The following non-
statutory designated sites are present within 500 m of the Project Site entrance: 
Cefn Forest Steam SINC, Felindre Grasslands SINC, Lletty-Morfil SINC, Ancient 
Woodland 6, and Ancient Woodland 12.  Lletty-Morfil SINC will be within 50 m of 
the operation access route.  There are no additional non-statutory designated sites 
within 50 m of the operation access routes or potential dust sources. As stated in 
Chapter 12: Traffic, Transport and Access, the Project will employ 15 permanent 
staff in shifts, which will likely generate 30 movements per day (two movements per 
staff member). A demineralised water trailer and diesel fuel tanker will visit the 
Project Site periodically.  Maintenance periods will occur annually. During these 
periods, there may be up to 40 additional staff on-site for a period of one month. 
Based on a vehicle occupancy level of 1.6, this will equate to an additional 50 
movements per day (25 arrivals during the AM peak hour, 25 departures during the 
PM peak hour).  Increase to traffic during operation is afforded Low magnitude 
resulting in a Minor adverse effect, and is therefore not a significant effect and will 
not require additional mitigation.

8.7.134 There are no designated features within the non-statutory designated sites that are 
sensitive to lighting.  Furthermore, embedded mitigation will help to limit light spill 
outside of the Power Generation Plant, and the Gas Connection and Electrical 
Connection will not be lit. Operation-related lighting on non-statutory designated 
sites has not been considered any further.  
8.7.135 Runoff and pollution during any operational maintenance or repair works will be 
controlled and managed in a similar way as during construction.  There are deemed 
to be no significant effects on statutory designated sites in relation to the Gas 
Connection or Electrical Connection components of the Project.  
Middle Llan SINC, Pant Lasau SINC and Ancient Woodland 4 
8.7.136 There is a hydrological link between the Project Site and Middle Llan SINC, Pant 
Lasau SINC and Ancient Woodland 4 via the Afon Llan. There are springs, with 
their associated streams and drainage ditches within the Project Site which 
discharge into the Afon Llan. The Afon Llan flows through each of these sites.  
8.7.137 The Project incorporates welfare facilities (two toilets) which will require a site foul 
water drainage system.  During operation the Project will have a maximum of three 
shifts of five workers in a 24 hour period.  The foul water drainage system will either 
drain to a septic tank or a package treatment plant within the Project Site but 
outside any area at risk of flooding.  The processed water would then discharge on-
site or to a nearby watercourse.  Discharges will not perceptively increase the flow 
of the watercourse.  Discharges will be controlled via various measures as outlined 
in the embedded mitigation.   
8.7.138 The retained semi-improved neutral grassland, marshy grassland and woodland 
within the Project Site Boundary are sensitive to nitrogen deposition and nitrogen 
acidity deposition.  The results of the air quality modelling (Chapter 6: Air Quality) 
show that the Project’s PC of NOx, and consequently the PC of nitrogen deposition 
and nitrogen acidity deposition are very small (less than 0.01 kg/N/ha/yr and less 
than 0.01 keqH+/ha/yr, respectively).  For all habitats, the PC does not cause 
Critical Loads to be exceeded. In the cases where the Critical Loads for nitrogen 
and nitrogen acidity are already in exceedance, the influence of nitrogen or nitrogen 
acidity from the Project is not at a level where it would cause a significant effect. 
Effects in relation to air quality are considered Negligible and as such are not 
considered significant and will not require further mitigation.  
8.7.139 The embedded mitigation covers drainage and following best practice and 
guidelines, controlling pollution, storage of potential pollutants, and precautionary 
measures will help to limit the likelihood and effects of pollution incidents and/or 
runoff.  In line with the drainage strategy the Project Site drainage will include filter 
drains / swales or oil interceptors as necessary to remove pollutants and all 
necessary treatment will take place on the Project Site before it is discharged to the 
existing watercourses.  Effects in relation to discharges are considered Negligible 
and as such are not considered significant and will not require further mitigation.

8.7.140 It is assumed that the potential effects on habitats for any partial underground cable 
or pipeline replacement or repairs in relation to the Gas Connection or Electrical 
Connection components of the Project will be the same or similar to those identified 
during the construction phase of the Project.  
8.7.141 There will be no additional effects on habitats during the operational phase of the 
Project.  
iii. Protected or Priority Species 
8.7.142 It is assumed that the potential effects on species for any partial underground cable 
or pipeline replacement or repairs in relation to the Gas Connection or Electrical 
Connection components of the Project will be the same or similar to those identified 
during the construction phase of the Project.  
8.7.143 Operational external lighting has been designed to reduce trespass and configured 
to avoid glare and spillage, and otherwise in accordance with the Outline Lighting 
Strategy (Appendix 3.5) undertaken in accordance with the Institution of Lighting 
Professionals guidelines. The strategy will seek to limit effects of lighting on 
habitats (and therefore species) adjacent to the Project Site.  During the hours of 
darkness, only critical light sources will remain in operation, these include 
emergency exit illumination and Project Site security lighting at a low level. The 
Access Road shall not be lit. A curfew will be implemented for all non-critical lighting 
from 23.00 to 05.00 hrs; all non-critical lighting will be switched off during these 
hours via a time clock. Routes and entrances not in constant use will be controlled 
via a movement detector or manual switch, ensuring that lighting in these areas will 
be switched off the vast majority of the time.  
8.7.144 The sensitivity of the infrared motion detectors will be set so as not to be activated 
by the movement of large mammals such as badgers and otters. The lighting 
strategy will ensure that all lighting columns will be fitted with cowls to reduce light 
spill and will be directed away from boundary features. A ‘dark corridor’ (as shown 
in Figure 3.6) has been designed to keep lighting to less than 1 lux along adjacent 
woodland edges and watercourses that are likely to be used by nocturnal species 
such as bats, badgers and otters.  
8.7.145 The Gas Connection and Electrical Connection will not be lit.  
Invertebrates 
8.7.146 Invertebrate species such as moths are very sensitive to lighting and light levels as 
low as 0.1 lux has been shown to affect invertebrate activity (Ref. 8.18). The 
embedded mitigation will help to limit light spill outside of the Power Generation 
Plant. However, some types of lights have spectrums and wavelengths that are 
attractive to invertebrates. Effects in relation to lighting are deemed to be of Low 
magnitude, resulting in a Minor effect, and as such are not considered a significant 
and will not require further mitigation.

8.7.147 The Project incorporates welfare facilities which will require a site foul water 
drainage system.  During operation, the Project will have a maximum of two toilets 
on site with approximately three shifts of five workers in a 24 hour period.  The foul 
water drainage system will either drain to a septic tank or a package treatment 
plant within the Project Site but outside any area at risk of flooding. The processed 
water would then discharge on-site or to a nearby watercourse. There are deemed 
to be no effects on aquatic invertebrates as a result of waste water discharges.  
Amphibians 
8.7.148 The Project incorporates welfare facilities which will require a site foul water 
drainage system.  During operation the Project will have a maximum of two toilets 
on site with approximately three shifts of five workers in a 24 hour period.  The foul 
water drainage system will either drain to a septic tank or a package treatment 
plant within the Project Site but outside any area at risk of flooding. The processed 
water would then discharge on-site or to a nearby watercourse. There are deemed 
to be no effects on amphibians as a result of waste water discharges.  
Breeding Birds 
8.7.149 Lighting can cause disruptions to bird behaviour. However, the embedded 
mitigation will limit light spill outside of the Project Site Boundary and this will help 
limit the effects on breeding birds.  There will be no significant operational effects 
on breeding birds as a result of lighting. 
8.7.150 Operational noise can cause disturbance to birds although the assemblage of 
species recorded are tolerant of changes in noise and as such will become 
habituated to noise levels nearby. There will be no significant operational effects on 
breeding birds as a result of noise. 
Reptiles 
8.7.151 Reptiles are not considered to be sensitive to disturbance during operation in the 
form of noise or lighting.  There will be no significant operational effects on reptiles 
as a result of noise or lighting.  
8.7.152 Reptiles are sensitive to vibration. Vibration from the operation of the Power 
Generation Plant is unlikely to be perceptible to reptiles and therefore Negligible 
effects are anticipated, and as such are not considered significant and will not 
require further mitigation.  
8.7.153 There is a risk of direct mortality from the use of the Access Road by operational 
traffic.  However, this is considered to be of Low magnitude given the infrequent 
traffic envisaged, the numbers of reptiles likely to be moving across the Access 
Road and the low speed limits in place. This results in a Minor effect, and as such 
is not considered significant and will not require further mitigation.

Bats 
8.7.154 There will be an increase in external lighting at the Power Generation Plant during 
operation. There is currently no external lighting within the majority of the Project 
Site. Many species of bat are averse to light, with different species having different 
tolerances.  External lighting can make areas of previous foraging habitat 
unsuitable and fragment commuting routes.  If external lighting for the Power 
Generation Plant is poorly designed there is potential for a light spill onto 
hedgerows, tree lines, woodland edges and vegetated areas which will negatively 
impact on bats, severing commuting routes and impeding access to foraging 
habitat.  Poorly designed lighting also has the potential to affect areas outside the 
Project Site Boundary.  The embedded mitigation measures with regards to lighting 
will limit impacts on surrounding habitats and bats. As such the impact from lighting 
is afforded Negligible magnitude resulting in a Minor effect; this is not considered a 
significant effect and will not require additional mitigation.  
8.7.155 The nearest known bat roost to the Project is approximately 330m (1000 feet) from 
the Power Generation Plant boundary.  Noise dissipates at a rate of 6 dB with the 
doubling of the distance (in feet). Given the noise during operation will be 55 dB LA 
or lower at the Power Generation Plant boundary fence, the noise will not effect 
echo location at the nearest known bat roost.  Similarly, vibration from operation will 
not be perceptible at this distance.   
8.7.156 Noise during operation has the potential to disrupt commuting and foraging bats. 
However, noise is considered unlikely to have an impact on bats and is unlikely to 
cause any indirect habitat loss through disturbance to foraging areas. The 
Generating Equipment will only be operational intermittently at times of peak 
demand and will not emit ultrasonic noise (ultrasonic being noise which is higher 
than the upper audible limit of human hearing and typically considered to be above 
20kHz).  
8.7.157 The Generating Equipment is predicted to emit a sound power level of around 
100dB LWA, the power peaks at a frequency of around 50/63 Hz and roughly halves 
with every doubling of frequency above that. A typical attenuated power station 
sound power spectrum is shown in Insert 8.1. This only goes up to 8,000Hz (8kHz) 
but the tail off in the spectrum continues with increased frequency, showing that 
there will be little sound power (dBA) above 10,000Hz (10kHz).  
8.7.158 The specific sound level near the Project Site Boundary is estimated to be 
approximately 55dB LAeq (Chapter 7: Noise and Vibration, Figure 7.1) (this term 
is the Equivalent Continuous Level, a type of average, where noisy events have a 
significant influence). The theoretical average sound pressure level (dBA) at the 
Project Site Boundary approximately 30 m from the Generating Equipment will be 
approximately 55 dBA to 63 dBA. Equivalent general sounds comparisons are: 50 
dBA is light traffic or rainfall; 60-65 dBA is normal conversation; and 85 dBA is 
heavy traffic.

Insert 8.1: A Typical Attenuated Power Station Sound Power Spectrum (Not Site Specific) 
 
 
8.7.159 There is limited research on the impact of anthropogenic noise on foraging bats 
and no directly comparable research on the impacts of power station noise have 
been identified. Research that exists shows that increased anthropogenic noise can 
negatively impact foraging activity of some species of bats, particularly low 
frequency bats (<35 kHz), as a result of prey masking and avoidance of noise. Two 
of these are summarised below. 
8.7.160 Bunkley et. al. (Ref. 8.20) investigated the potential effects of gas compressor 
station noise in the USA on the activity levels of the local bat assemblage. The gas 
compressor stations run 24 hour a day, 365 days a year. The mean background 
sound level (dBA) recorded at 50 m from the gas compressor site centre was 
between 70 dBA and 85 dBA. The frequency of the compressor noise was 24 kHz.  
8.7.161 Bunkley et. al. (Ref. 8.20) found that activity levels for the Brazilian free-tailed bat 
(Tadarida brasiliensis) were 40% lower at loud compressor sites compared to 
quieter oil well pads, whereas the activity levels of four other species (Myotis 
californicus, M. cillolabrum, M. lucifugus, Parastrellus hesperus) were not affected 
by noise. The assemblage of bat species emitting low frequency (<35 kHz) 
echolocation calls showed a 70% reduction in activity levels at loud sites compared 
to quieter oil well pad sites whereas the assemblage using high frequency (>35 
kHz) echolocation did not exhibit altered activity levels. Bunkley et. al. (Ref. 8.20) 
concluded that lower activity levels of Brazilian free-tailed bats at loud sites indicate 
a potential reduction in habitat for this species and that this species modifies its 
echolocation search calls in noise, producing longer calls with a narrower 
bandwidth, which might affect prey detection.  
8.7.162 Luo et al., 2015 (Ref. 8.21) investigated how anthropogenic noise impairs foraging, 
which has direct consequences for animal survival and reproductive success, using

Daubenton’s bats, which ﬁnd prey by echolocation. The study looked to identify the 
potential mechanisms of disturbance in any species capable of detecting the noise, 
namely acoustic masking of prey echoes, reduced attention and noise avoidance. 
The study used playback of traffic noise and was laboratory based. Traffic noise 
was played at around 76 dBA, at nonoverlapping frequencies below 25 kHz (not 
spectrally overlapping the minimum call frequency of Daubenton’s, which is at 28 
kHz), and overlapping frequencies above 25 kHz. 
8.7.163 Luo et al., 2015 (Ref. 8.21) found that trafﬁc noise reduced foraging efﬁciency in 
most Daubenton’s bats. This effect was present even if the playback noise did not 
overlap in frequency with the prey echoes. Neither overlapping noise nor 
nonoverlapping noise inﬂuenced the search effort required for a successful prey 
capture. Hence, noise did not mask prey echoes or reduce the attention of bats. 
Instead, traffic noise acted as an aversive stimulus that caused avoidance 
response, thereby reducing foraging efﬁciency.  
8.7.164 The frequency emitted from the Generating Equipment (between 50 Hz and 10,000 
Hz (10 kHz)) is unlikely to mask the frequencies of large bat prey items, which are 
generally in the range of 20 – 35 kHz and frequencies less than 1 kHz are probably 
inaudible to bats (Ref. 8.21).  
8.7.165 Bunkley et. al. (Ref. 8.20) suggests that bat species emitting low frequency (<35 
kHz) echolocation calls may be more affected by noise than other species. At the 
Project Site, bats which echolocate at frequencies <35 kHz include the large bats; 
noctule, serotine and Leisler's. Lower frequency bats at the Project Site make up 
5.8% of the total composition of bat species, the rest are higher frequency bat 
species (>35kHz). However, the predicted frequencies emitted from the Generating 
Equipment (between 50 Hz and 10,000 Hz (10 kHz)) were much lower than in 
Bunkley et. al. (Ref. 8.20) and, as above, are unlikely to mask prey items for any 
bat species. 
8.7.166 There may be some noise avoidance by some bat species when the Generating 
Equipment is operating, as there is little research available to be able to completely 
rule out potential avoidance from noise of 55 – 63 dBA. However, the generation of 
noise would be sporadic and the sound power anticipated at the Project Site 
Boundary is lower than that in the studies summarised above and it would be 
anticipated that any impact from avoidance would therefore be comparably lower. 
No studies were identified which looked at potential foraging impacts from sound 
power (dBA) less than 70 dBA to be able to draw any direct conclusion. 
8.7.167 At the Project Site, the nature of the noise generated will be sporadic and the 
sound power will peak at a frequency well below the typical frequency used by 
echolocating bats. As such, effects from noise and vibration are afforded Negligible 
magnitude, resulting in a Minor effect. This is not considered a significant effect 
and does not require mitigation.

Badger 
8.7.168 The new section of Access Road has the potential to result in road traffic mortality 
of badgers.  The Project will employ 15 permanent staff in shifts, which will likely 
generate 30 movements per day (two movements per staff member). A 
demineralised water trailer and diesel fuel tanker will visit the Project Site 
periodically.  Regular night time access (when badgers are more active) is likely to 
comprise approximately fifteen one way journeys.  Maintenance periods will occur 
annually. During these periods, there may be up to 40 additional staff on-site for a 
period of one month. Based on a vehicle occupancy level of 1.6, this will equate to 
an additional 50 movements per day (25 arrivals during the AM peak hour, 25 
departures during the PM peak hour).  A 20 mph speed limit will be in place along 
the Access Road.  This will reduce the likelihood of badger mortality incidents.  This 
impact is considered to be of Low magnitude, resulting in a Negligible effect, and 
is therefore not significant and does not require additional mitigation.  
8.7.169 There is the potential to cause disturbance of badger during operation due to 
increased lighting.  The embedded mitigation will help to limit light spill outside of 
the Power Generation Plant. Effects in relation to lighting are deemed to be of Low 
magnitude, resulting in a Negligible effect, and as such are not considered a 
significant and will not require further mitigation.  
8.7.170 Any new fencing has the potential to inhibit commuting routes across the Project 
Site.  This impact is considered to be of Low magnitude and therefore not 
significant.  However, where possible, measures should be put in place to allow the 
continued movement of badgers across the Project Site.  
8.7.171 There is the potential for disturbance of badger during operation due to increased 
noise.  The background noise as identified in Chapter 7: Noise and Vibration 
within the Project Site ranges from between 17dB (night time noise in an isolated 
location) and 50 dB (day time noise near a road/active farm).  The predicted 
operational noise level from plant is expected to be an average of 50 dB and a 
maximum of 55 dB at the boundary of the Power Generation Plant.  The noise level 
at the nearest setts (an active annex and active main sett) is expected to be 
between 40 dB and 50 dB (similar to the noise of a babbling brook or light traffic).  It 
is considered that badgers will habituate to the higher background noise since the 
area near to the setts will already be subject to sudden loud noises such as 
agricultural machinery passing nearby and farm workers.  Badgers are known to 
tolerate high levels of noise, setts have been found next to motorways, major roads 
and railway lines (Ref. 8.22). Noise levels at the other setts are expected to be 
between 32 dB and 22 dB.  This is unlikely to be enough to deter badgers from 
using these setts.  Disturbance at the active annex and active main sett is afforded 
Low magnitude, resulting in a Negligible effect. This is not considered a significant 
effect and will not require further mitigation.  
8.7.172 Badgers using the Project Site for commuting and foraging are likely to be 
disturbed in the immediate vicinity of the Power Generation Plant during the start-
up of the facility only but are likely to habituate to the higher background noise over 
Abergelli ES 2018 – CHAPTER 8: ECOLOGY

AECOM 
8-96 
 
time and at increased distances from the Power Generation Plant. The increase in 
noise levels is not considered significant enough to deter them from returning. 
Therefore this effect is considered to be of Low magnitude, resulting in a 
Negligible effect. This is not considered a significant effect and will not require 
further mitigation.  
8.7.173 There are no additional effects associated with the Electrical Connection or Gas 
Connection on otters requiring mitigation.  
Water Vole 
8.7.174 The Power Generation Plant is close to an area suitable for supporting water vole 
burrows (Watercourse 45). Although no recently occupied burrows were identified 
during the survey, it is possible that prior to construction new burrows are created in 
this area.  
8.7.175 There is the potential for disturbance of water voles during operation due to 
increased noise.  The predicted operational noise level from plant is expected to be 
an average of 50 dB and a maximum of 55 dB at the boundary of the Power 
Generation Plant, which is between approximately 20 m and 80 m from the section 
of Watercourse 45 suitable for supporting water voles.  In general background 
noise levels at watercourses are around 45 dB.  The change in noise level is 
unlikely to be enough to deter water voles where Watercourse 45 is 20 m from the 
Power Generation Plant boundary. Further afield, as the noise level reduces in line 
to the background level it is likely that water voles will not be deterred from using 
these areas.  Given the extremely localised impact, noise is afforded Low 
magnitude, resulting in a Negligible effect and as such noise effects are not 
significant and will not require additional mitigation.  
8.7.176 The Project incorporates welfare facilities which will require a site foul water 
drainage system.  During operation the Project will have a maximum of two toilets 
on site with approximately three shifts of five workers in a 24 hour period.  The foul 
water drainage system will either drain to a septic tank or a package treatment 
plant within the Project Site but outside any area at risk of flooding.  The processed 
water would then discharge on-site or to a nearby watercourse.  There are 
considered to be Negligible effects on water vole as a result of waste water 
discharges, therefore not significant and no additional mitigation will be required.  
8.7.177 There are no effects associated with the Electrical Connection or Gas Connection 
on water vole requiring mitigation.  
Otter 
8.7.178 The new section of Access Road has the potential to result in road traffic mortality 
of otters.  The Project will employ 15 permanent staff in shifts, which will likely 
generate 30 movements per day (two movements per staff member). A 
demineralised water trailer and diesel fuel tanker will visit the Project Site 
periodically.  Regular night time access (when otters are more active) is likely to 
comprise approximately fifteen one way journeys.  Maintenance periods will occur

annually. During these periods, there may be up to 40 additional staff on-site for a 
period of one month. Based on a vehicle occupancy level of 1.6, this will equate to 
an additional 50 movements per day (25 arrivals during the AM peak hour, 25 
departures during the PM peak hour). A 20 mph speed limit will be in place along 
the Access Road.  This will reduce the likelihood of otter mortality incidents.  This 
impact is considered to be of Negligible magnitude, resulting in a Negligible effect, 
and therefore is not considered significant and does not require additional 
mitigation.  
8.7.179 There is the potential for disturbance of otter during operation due to increased 
lighting.  The embedded mitigation will help to limit light spill outside of the Power 
Generation Plant. Effects in relation to lighting are considered to be of Low 
magnitude, resulting in a Negligible effect, and as such are not considered 
significant and will not require further mitigation.  
8.7.180 Any new fencing has the potential to inhibit commuting routes across the Project 
Site. This impact is considered to be of Low magnitude and therefore not 
significant.  However, where possible, measures should be put in place to allow the 
continued movement of otters across the Project Site. 
8.7.181 There is the potential for disturbance of otter during operation due to increased 
noise.  The predicted operational noise level from plant is expected to be an 
average of 50 dB and a maximum of 55 dB at the boundary of the Power 
Generation Plant, which is between 80 m and immediately adjacent to water 
courses suitable for supporting otter.  In general, background noise levels at 
watercourses are around 45 dB.  The change in noise level is unlikely to be enough 
to deter otter in these areas.  Otters have been shown to use areas with high levels 
of background noise such as under roads, in industrial buildings and close to 
quarries (Ref. 8.24). Further afield, as the noise level reduces in line to the 
background level it is likely that otters will not be deterred from using these areas.  
As otters generally use the Project Site for commuting and foraging the increase in 
noise levels is not considered significant enough to deter them from returning as 
they are tolerant of relatively high levels of disturbance (Ref. 8.24) and will resume 
their previous activity. It is considered that otters will habituate to the higher 
background noise. Therefore this effect is considered to be of Negligible 
magnitude, resulting in a Negligible effect and therefore is not significant and does 
not require additional mitigation.  
8.7.182 The Project incorporates welfare facilities which will require a site foul water 
drainage system.  During operation the Project will have a maximum of two toilets 
on site with approximately three shifts of five workers in a 24 hour period.  The foul 
water drainage system will either drain to a septic tank or a package treatment 
plant within the Project Site but outside any area at risk of flooding. The processed 
water would then discharge on-site or to a nearby watercourse.  There are 
considered to be no effects on otter as a result of waste water discharges.  
8.7.183 There are no additional effects associated with the Electrical Connection or Gas 
Connection on otters requiring mitigation.

 Decommissioning 
c)
8.7.184 The detailed decommissioning methodology cannot be finalised until immediately 
prior to decommissioning, but would be in line with relevant legislation and policy at 
that time.  
8.7.185 The working assumption has been made for the purposes of this assessment that 
after 25 years, the Generating Equipment would be removed and the Generating 
Equipment Site re-instated to a similar condition as before construction. Any 
decommissioning phase would be likely to be of a similar duration to construction 
i.e. 22 months.  
8.7.186 A working assumption has been used that the Electrical Connection and Gas 
Connection would be decommissioned after 25 years. Elements of the Gas 
Connection and Electrical Connection may be left in situ as this is likely to cause 
less environmental effects than removal. This would be the case for the Gas 
Pipeline, for example.  
8.8 
Mitigation and Monitoring  
8.8.1 
Additional mitigation measures have been proposed where a significant effect is 
predicted to occur.  Embedded mitigation measures, which have been incorporated 
within the design of the Project or are standard practice measures that have been 
committed to are summarised in Chapter 3: Project and Site Description.   
8.8.2 
This section describes the proposed additional mitigation measures for the 
ecological assessment.  Where other additional mitigation is required to reduce or 
eliminate a significant effect, this is referred to as additional mitigation.  Additional 
mitigation measures have not been incorporated into the design of the Project and 
are therefore described in this section.  
8.8.3 
This section also describes any required monitoring regimes, including monitoring 
of specific receptors/resources, or monitoring the effectiveness of a mitigation 
measure.  The requirements, scope, frequency and duration of a given monitoring 
regime are set out, as far as possible, in this section. 
a) Mitigation 
i. 
During Construction 
8.8.4 
Throughout the construction mitigation section areas of replacement habitats are 
referred to within the LEMP and Strategy presented in Figure 3.6 and Appendix 3.4.  
Indicative areas based on the Project layout presented Figure 3.2. The overall 
totals are as follows and that the same areas are referred to more than once:  
 
1.07 ha of woodland/scrub; 
 
2.50 ha of grassland (acid grassland/marshy grassland mosaic); 
 
900 m of hedgerow; and, 
 
Two wildlife ponds and 180 m2 of attenuation pond.

Lletty-Morfil SINC 
8.8.5 
Mitigation for the loss of SINC habitat (broadleaved semi-natural woodland, 
dense/continuous scrub and marshy grassland) will include the provision of 
replacement habitats. A LEMP and Strategy are presented in Figure 3.6 and 
Appendix 3.4.   
8.8.6 
Indicative areas, based on the plan are as follows: 
 
1.07 ha of woodland/scrub; 
 
2.50 ha of grassland (acid grassland/marshy grassland mosaic); 
 
900 m of hedgerow; and, 
 
Two wildlife ponds and 180 m2 of attenuation pond. 
Row of Trees – Broadleaved and Hedgerows – Species-Poor 
8.8.7 
Loss of rows of trees and hedgerows utilised by wildlife such as commuting and 
foraging bats, and commuting badgers will be mitigated for through the introduction 
of hedgerows and linear woodland features as shown on the LEMP and Strategy 
presented in Figure 3.6 and Appendix 3.4.  
8.8.8 
Mitigation measures include that habitats temporarily removed will be reinstated 
and that mature trees removed may be replaced by standards of the same species 
or transplanted to a suitable location elsewhere within the Project Site Boundary.  
Marshy Grassland 
8.8.9 
Temporarily removed habitats will be reinstated.  Mitigation for the loss of marshy 
grassland habitat will include the provision of replacement habitat, as shown on the 
LEMP and Strategy, presented in Figure 3.6 and Appendix 3.4. The indicative area, 
based on the previous layout of the landscaping plans, is 2.50 ha of grassland (acid 
grassland/marshy grassland mosaic); however, this area is subject to change.  
Standing Water 
8.8.10 Mitigation for the loss of standing water habitat will include the provision of 
replacement habitat, as shown on the LEMP and Strategy, presented in Figure 3.6 
and Appendix 3.4.  Provisionally, it has been suggested that two attenuation ponds 
will be provided and function as wildlife ponds as well as two wildlife ponds within 
the acid grassland/marshy grassland mosaic replacement habitat. The attenuation 
ponds will be planted with native wetland species and where possible maintained 
as wetland features. The wildlife ponds will be planted with native wetland species 
and maintained as wetland features. 
Amphibians 
8.8.11 Recommendations for reptiles below will help to limit the injury or killing of 
amphibians.

Reptiles 
8.8.12 Mitigation for the loss of habitat suitable for supporting reptiles (dense/continuous 
scrub and grassland) will include the provision of replacement habitats, as shown 
on the LEMP and Strategy, presented in Figure 3.6 and Appendix 3.4.   
8.8.13 Indicative areas, based on the plan are as follows: 
 
1.07 ha of woodland/scrub; 
 
2.50 ha of grassland (acid grassland/marshy grassland mosaic); 
 
900 m of hedgerow; and, 
 
Two wildlife ponds and 180 m2 of attenuation pond. 
8.8.14 Based on the positive result from the surveys reptile translocation will be required in 
areas of suitable habitat with the Project Site Boundary that are to be permanently 
or temporarily lost during construction.  
8.8.15 The trapping and translocation programme will be designed following the guidance 
set out in Herpetofauna Groups of Britain and Ireland 1998 publication (Ref. 8.25).  
8.8.16 Due to the ‘Good’ population of common lizard and the presence of low numbers of 
grass snakes within the survey area it is recommended that a trapping and 
translocation programme is undertaken to help protect any reptiles from being 
injured or killed.  Due to the presence of suitable habitat for adder, the programme 
will include measures for this species.  The actions involved in the proposed 
trapping and translocation are outlined below: 
 
Any construction areas suitable or known to support reptiles, including any 
routes in and out, areas for site compounds, offices or storage of 
materials/waste, will be fenced off using suitable fencing (drift or semi-
permanent) to limit individuals attempting to enter the Project Site from the 
adjacent land; 
 
No construction activities, including pedestrian access will be allowed outside 
of the fencing in areas of habitat suitable for supporting reptiles.  
 
A number of refugia (at a density of 50/ha) will be placed within the fenced area 
to attract reptiles; 
 
Each day, up to twice a day for a minimum of 60 days an ecologist will check 
the refugia for the presence of reptiles; 
 
Any reptiles or amphibians found will be captured for relocation to suitable 
habitat outside of the fenced areas.  
 
After 60 days the trapping can cease once there have been five consecutive 
days where no reptiles have been found; 
 
After the fenced area has been cleared of reptiles and prior to soil stripping the 
vegetation can undergo a process of habitat management and hand searches 
for reptiles; 
 
Supervision of the soil strip during construction work by a suitably qualified 
ecologist will be required to help protect injury or killing of reptiles; and, 
 
Any litter or rubble piles will be removed by hand under the supervision of an 
ecologist to avoid injuring or killing any reptiles. If the material is too heavy to 
be removed by hand it can be done so using a mini excavator carefully and 
slowly removing the material, under the supervision of an ecologist.  
Abergelli ES 2018 – CHAPTER 8: ECOLOGY 
 
 
Prepared for:  Abergelli Power Limited  
AECOM 
8-101 
 
8.8.17 Due to the relatively low numbers of reptiles likely to be present within the fenced 
area it is considered appropriate to move any captured reptiles to the areas of 
habitat suitable for supporting reptiles being retained outside of the fenced area.  
Project Site Boundary The habitats will be maintained in such a condition as to be 
suitable for receiving reptiles once the programme commences (i.e. not recently 
cut).  
8.8.18 Any amphibians captured during the reptile trapping programme will be moved to a 
suitable location within the Project Site Boundary.  
8.8.19 To reduce the risk of individual reptiles being injured or killed, all works will proceed 
under a Method Statement agreed with the Local Biodiversity Officer/Council 
Ecologist prior to works commencing.  
8.8.20 The risk of reptiles and the mitigation measures will be included in the Project Site 
induction package and prior to any site clearance and construction tasks.  
8.8.21 Full details are provided in the LEMP and Strategy in Figure 3.6 and Appendix 3.4. 
Breeding Birds 
8.8.22 Habitat creation measures relating to the loss of the SINC, broadleaved woodland, 
marshy grassland, hedgerows and lines of trees will provide additional areas for 
breeding birds post construction.  Embedded landscape planting will also provide 
additional habitat for the species assemblage recorded. Badger 
8.8.23 A pre-construction check for badger setts and activity will be undertaken where 
construction works are within 30 m of suitable habitats for badger sett creation.  
8.8.24 Works likely to damage or destroy a badger sett will require a license to close the 
sett prior to works commencing.  The terms of the license may stipulate the 
requirement for compensatory setts to be created should any main setts be 
destroyed and/or temporarily closed.  
8.8.25 Excavations, if left unfilled overnight, should be covered to avoid badgers and other 
animals becoming trapped. Sloping escape ramps for badgers should be created 
by edge profiling trenches/excavations and/or excavations should be fitted with a 
scaffolding board ramp to allow any trapped animals to exit. Crossing places will be 
provided across open excavations for the duration of the works on the sections 
where known badger paths have been identified. Open pipework greater than 150 
mm diameter that is left over night will be made secure by either filling in the end of 
the pipe or covering the end with a solid timber panel or similar.  
8.8.26 Night time working with its associated need for additional lighting should be avoided 
as far as possible within areas near to setts and areas of known activity to reduce 
disturbance to badger when they are out of their setts and foraging.  There should 
be no night time illumination of the hedgerows, woodland or setts.  
8.8.27 The introduction of new woodland, scrub, species-rich grassland and hedgerows 
will increase opportunities for resting, breeding and foraging badger.

Invasive Species 
8.8.28 An invasive species management plan will be produced to control and eradicate the 
invasive species within the Project Site Boundary. An updated invasive species 
survey should be undertaken to accurately assess invasive species and extents 
within the Project Site Boundary prior to the implementation of control measures.  
8.8.29 Details of control and eradication are provided in the LEMP (Figure 3.6) and 
Strategy (Appendix 3.4). 
ii. During Operation 
Protected Species 
8.8.30 The mitigation for partial underground cable or pipework replacement or repairs will 
follow best practice and any intrusive works will only commence after consultation 
with an ecologist to assess whether there are any impacts associated with the 
work.  
8.8.31 Management of newly created habitats or compensatory features are detailed in 
the LEMP and Strategy and will be designed to minimise disturbance or adverse 
effects on protected and/or priority species, such as avoiding vegetation 
management during nesting bird season, and cutting grass and scrub within the 
reptile receptor area to a height of no less than 150 mm.  
Bats 
8.8.32 The lighting should utilise warm light luminaire such as yellow or amber LED.  
White LED lamps have a broad spectrum of light with whilst yellow and amber LED 
lamps each have a specific, narrower spectrum and have peak wavelengths 
between 590 and 660 nm, which is less attractive to invertebrates.  This in turn will 
reduce the number of bats that will be attracted to feed and be open to predation 
through increased visibility.  
Badger and Otter 
8.8.33 Any new fencing along the Access Road will continue to allow the movement of 
badger across the Project Site through the inclusion of badger/otter gates or large 
gaps between the bottom of the fence and the ground.  Speed limits on the Access 
Road will be enforced to help reduce the likelihood of any traffic mortalities or 
collisions.  
iii. During Decommissioning  
8.8.34 The detailed decommissioning methodology cannot be finalised until immediately 
prior to decommissioning, works associated with decommissioning would be 
subject to a separate assessment (likely EcIA) at that time, and as such appropriate 
mitigation would be decided upon during that process.  
8.8.35 A Decommissioning Strategy will be secured as part of the DCO requirement.

b) Monitoring and Management 
8.8.36 Monitoring will be undertaken on any newly created or relocated habitats for at 
least five years from establishment.  
8.8.37 Monitoring will be undertaken for any species with newly created compensatory 
habitats for at least five years following establishment; for example, artificial badger 
setts, the reptile receptor site and bat boxes to assess their effectiveness and 
inform any ongoing management.  
8.8.38 Management of newly created habitats will continue for the operational lifetime of 
the Project. Details of monitoring and management are contained within the 
Landscape and Ecology Mitigation Strategy (Appendix 3.4).

 Project ‘inter effects’ 
a)
8.9.2 
The predicted effects of the Project upon receptors to air quality are limited to those 
assets listed in Table 8-17 and Table 8-18, and as such no significant impacts are 
predicted from the Project.  
8.10 
Assessment of Effects on Natural Features (APFP Regulations 2009) 
8.10.1 Regulation 5(2)(l) of the Infrastructure Planning (Applications: Prescribed Forms 
and Procedure) Regulations 2009 requires DCO applicants to provide, where 
applicable: 
a plan with accompanying information identifying— 
 
any statutory or non-statutory sites or features of nature conservation 
 
such as sites of geological or landscape importance; 
 
habitats of protected species, important habitats or other diversity features; and 
 
water bodies in a river basin management plan. 
together with an assessment of any effects on such sites, features, habitats or 
bodies likely to be caused by the proposed development. 
8.10.2 Statutory and non-statutory designated sites of nature conservation importance are 
shown in Figure 8.2; the Figures also show habitats of protected species, important 
habitats and other diversity features. 
8.10.3 Relevant water bodies are identified in Figure 9.5. 
8.10.4 Sections 8.7 to 8.9 of this chapter (together with Appendices 8.1 to 8.19)  assess 
any effects of the Project on the sites, features and habitats mentioned in regulation 
5(2)(l) and consider whether or not they are 'significant' for EIA purposes. 
8.10.5 An assessment of the effects on relevant water bodies is provided in Chapter 9: 
Water Resources and Flood Risk.

Cumulative Effects 
a) Assessment of Potential Cumulative Effects – Construction and Demolition 
i. 
Description of baseline where cumulative impacts expected 
8.11.1 The assessment of residual effects identified that the implementation of the Project 
would have no significant effects once mitigation measures have been fully 
implemented. The assessment of cumulative effects relies upon there being a 
perceptible effect as a result of the project being considered in order for this to be 
significant in combination with other projects. It is therefore considered that there is 
no potential for cumulative impacts on ecological receptors as a result of operation 
of the Project in combination with the identified other projects. 
8.11.2 No further mitigation will be required.  
b) Assessment of Potential Cumulative Effects – Operation 
i. 
Description of baseline where cumulative effects expected 
8.11.3 It is considered that there is no potential for cumulative impacts on ecological 
receptors as a result of operation of the Project in combination with the identified 
other schemes as all residual effects were considered not to be significant.  
8.11.4 No further mitigation will be required.  
8.12 
Conclusions and Remaining Surveys 
8.12.1 This chapter has identified ecological designated sites, habitats, species or 
ecosystems which may be affected by the Project and assessed the likelihood of 
significant effects.  
8.12.2 No residual significant effects have been identified for each component of the 
Project, or the Project as whole due to the embedded mitigation inherent within the 
design but also the application of additional mitigation where required.  
8.12.3 The following surveys are ongoing and will be undertaken in 2018: 
 
Hedgerow survey in April 2018; 
 
Ongoing bat activity surveys in April and May 2018;  
 
Bat emergence and re-entry surveys on Buildings 7 and 8 in May, June & July 
2018; and 
 
Breeding bird survey in April and May 2018. 
8.12.4 Where possible the survey results are provided in this chapter, or as supplementary 
information to follow soon after submission. Any delayed results are not expected to 
materially change the impact assessment results. It is also intended to continue 
liaison with CCS and NRW regarding the ecological mitigation required for reptiles 
and other species present onsite.

Water Quality and Resources 
9.1 
Introduction 
9.1.1 
This chapter provides an assessment of the likely significant effects on water 
quality, water resources and flood risk arising from construction, operation and 
decommissioning of the Project. Maintenance is included within the operational 
assessment of the Project. 
9.1.2 
A detailed description of the Project Site and the Project is provided in Chapter 3: 
Project and Site Description.  A glossary of terms and list of abbreviations used in 
this chapter is provided in Document Reference 1.4.   
9.1.3 
This chapter is supported by the assessment demonstrated in Appendix 9.1: Flood 
Consequence Assessment (FCA), and a Water Framework Directive (WFD) 
Screening Assessment provided in Appendix 9.2. Both the FCA and WFD 
Screening Assessment should be read alongside this chapter. Assessments of 
likely significant effects on hydrogeology are presented in Chapter 10: Geology, 
Ground Conditions and Hydrogeology.  
a) Objectives of the assessment 
9.1.4 
The objectives of the assessment were to: 
 Assess the activities to be carried out and their associated potential impacts 
likely to arise throughout the different phases of the Project which pose a risk to 
all water environmental receptors within the Project Site and surroundings; 
 To provide any additional mitigation as required to prevent, reduce and offset 
any significant adverse effects to water quality and resources likely to be 
affected by the Project;  
 Detail the residual effects after implementation of the mitigation; 
 Detail cumulative effects of the Project and nearby projects; 
 To ensure the Project complies with all local, national and international 
regulatory and legislative requirements; and 
 To address the issues and concerns raised in the Scoping Opinion (Appendix 
4.2) by the SoS in relation to Water Quality and Resources following an initial 
consultation in 2014. 
9.2 
Changes since the 2014 PEIR 
9.2.1 
There have been changes to the Project design as a result of design evolution and 
consultation as detailed in Chapter 3: Project and Site Description. To aid the 
reader, Table 9-1 below outlines the changes to this assessment compared with the 
2014 PEIR. Note, there are no design changes since 2018 that has altered this 
assessment.

This section identifies and describes legislation, policy and guidance of relevance 
to the assessment of the potential water quality, water resources and flood risk 
impacts associated with the Project.

9.3.2 
Legislation and policy has been considered on an international, national, regional 
and local level. The following is considered to be relevant to the water quality, water 
resources and flood risk assessment as it has influenced the sensitivity of receptors 
and requirements for mitigation or the scope and/or methodology of the 
Environmental Impact Assessment (EIA). 
a) International 
i. 
Water Framework Directive (WFD) (2000/60/EC) (European Union, 2000) 
9.3.3 
The Water Framework Directive (WFD) (2000/60/EC) (Ref. 9-3) together with its 
two daughter directives, being the Groundwater Directive (GWD) (2006/118/EC) 
(Ref. 9-4) and the Priority Substances Directive (2008/105/EC) (Ref. 9-5), and the 
EC Floods Directive (2007/60/EC) (Ref. 9-6) set out by the European Union are key 
international legislations that affect the Project within the context of water quality 
and resources. These directives together provide consensus measures on which 
surface water and groundwater bodies are protected. 
9.3.4 
The WFD also establishes a legal framework to protect and restore clean water 
status (i.e. “good” in terms of ecological and chemical quality and water quantity, as 
appropriate) across Europe and to ensure its long-term, sustainable use. The WFD 
is a significant piece of EU water legislation, with the overarching objective of 
enabling all water bodies in Europe to attain ‘Good’ or ‘High’ ecological status by 
2015.   
9.3.5 
The WFD directive establishes an innovative approach for water management 
based on river basins, the natural geographical and hydrological units and sets 
specific deadlines for Member States to protect aquatic ecosystems. The Directive 
addresses inland surface waters, transitional waters, coastal waters and 
groundwater. It establishes several principles for water management, including 
public participation in planning and the integration of economic approaches, 
including the recovery of the cost of water services. 
9.3.6 
The WFD is implemented in England and Wales by “The Water Environment (Water 
Framework Directive) (England and Wales) Regulations 2017” (Ref. 9-7). The 
Natural Resources Wales (NRW) is the competent authority in Wales responsible 
for delivering the objectives of the WFD. River Basin Management Plans (RBMP) 
specifically set out measures to ensure that water bodies in Wales achieve ‘Good’ 
ecological status. 
b) National 
9.3.7 
The national legislations relevant to the Project in terms of water quality and water 
resources are summarised below: 
i. 
The Water Environment (Water Framework Directive) (England and Wales)  
Regulations 2017 
9.3.8 
The Water Framework Directive requires that Member States continue to provide 
shellfish water protected areas with at least the same protection as under the 
Abergelli 2018 ES – CHAPTER 9: WATER QUALITY AND FLOOD RISK 
Prepared for:  Abergelli Power Limited  
AECOM 
 
9-5 
 
repealed Shellfish Waters Directive. The Water Environment (Water Framework 
Directive) (England and Wales) Regulations 2017 were laid before the National 
Assembly for Wales on 16 March 2017. The regulations came into force from 10 
April 2017. 
9.3.9 
The Regulations ensure that objectives are set for improving or protecting the water 
quality of shellfish waters and that these are monitored. Information about these 
areas must also be included in the river basin management plans. 
9.3.10 The content of the list of shellfish water protected areas in Wales has not changed 
since 2013. 
ii. Flood and Water Management Act 2010 
9.3.11 The Act (Ref. 9-8) designates City and County Swansea Council (CCS) as the Lead 
Local Flood Authority (LLFA), with the responsibility to lead and co-ordinate local 
flood risk management in the area. It also requires a Sustainable Urban Drainage 
System (SuDS) Approving Body (SAB) to be established within the LLFA. This 
responsibility to promote, approve and adopt sustainable drainage systems in new 
and re-developments can be delegated but the legal responsibility for drainage 
remains with CCS as the LLFA. SAB must approve drainage systems for the new 
and re-developed site in their area before construction can begin. The proposed 
drainage system must also meet National Standards for Sustainable Drainage 
(Ref. 9-9).  
iii. Flood Risk Regulations 2009 
9.3.12 The Flood Risk Regulations (Ref. 9-10) require NRW and LLFA to produce a 
Preliminary Flood Risk Assessment, Flood Hazard Maps, Flood Risk Maps and 
Flood Risk Management Plans for any areas at significant risk.  
iv. Environmental Permitting (England and Wales) Regulations 2016 
9.3.13 The Permitting regulations (Ref. 9-11) require operators to obtain permits for some 
facilities regarding water resources. The permits are granted by NRW, who control 
permitting water discharge and groundwater activities.  The 2016 update requires 
permits to be obtained for flood risk activities, including work on or near a main river 
and in a flood plain. 
v. Well-being of Future Generations (Wales) Act 2015  
9.3.14 The Act (Ref. 9-12) requires public bodies to undertake their duties and decision 
making in a sustainable way to help secure Wales’ long term well-being, so that it 
benefits from a prosperous economy, a healthy and resilient environment and 
vibrant, cohesive communities. The Act includes the requirement for decision 
making to take account of long term implications, such as climate change.  
vi. Environment (Wales) Act 2016 
9.3.15 The Act (Ref. 9-13) aims to enable Wales’ natural resources to be managed in a 
more proactive, sustainable and joined up way and to help tackle climate change.

c) National Policy 
i. 
Overarching National Policy Statement for Energy (NPS EN – 1) 
9.3.16 According to the policy (Ref. 9-14), an assessment of the existing baseline 
conditions regarding water quality, water resources and physical characteristics of 
the water environment is required where a proposed project is likely to have effects 
on the water environment. 
9.3.17 The NPS EN – 1 also sets the requirement for additional pollution control measures 
that must be considered for all activities that discharge to the water environment 
and recommends that the SoS gives increased weight in its decision making to 
impacts on the water environment that would have an adverse effect on the 
achievement of the objectives of the WFD. 
ii. National Policy Statement for Gas Supply Infrastructure and Gas and Oil 
Pipelines (NPS EN – 4)  
9.3.18 The NPS EN-4 Part 2 Section 2.22.2 (Ref. 9-15) recognises that “constructing 
pipelines creates corridors of surface clearance and excavation that can potentially 
affect watercourses, aquifers, water abstraction and discharge points, areas prone 
to flooding and ecological receptors. Pipeline impacts could include inadequate or 
excessive drainage, interference with groundwater flow pathways, mobilisation of 
contaminants already in the ground, the introduction of new pollutants, flooding, 
disturbance to water ecology, pollution due to silt from construction / demolition and 
disturbance to species and their habitats”. 
9.3.19 The NPS EN-4 states that where the project is likely to have effects on water 
resources or water quality, an assessment of the impacts should be provided in line 
with Section 5.15 of EN-1. The SoS should be satisfied that the impacts on water 
quality and resources are acceptable in accordance with Section 5.15 of EN-1. 
iii. National Policy Statement for Electricity Networks Infrastructure (NPS EN-5)  
9.3.20 NPS EN-5 (Ref. 9-16) requires consideration of adaption to climate change 
particularly from the increased risk of flooding to the resilience of some of the sites 
infrastructure and should be covered in the FCA.  
iv. Planning Policy Wales (Welsh Government, 2016) 
9.3.21 The policy (Ref. 9-17) is supplemented by TAN15 and incorporates sustainable 
development into the planning system which can be adhered to.  It requires every 
local planning authority to have produced a Local Development Plan (LDP) 
superseding the Unitary Development Plan (UDP). 
v. TAN15: Development and Flood Risk (Welsh Government, 2004)  
9.3.22 Technical Advice Note 15 (TAN15) (Ref. 9-18) provides the framework for guiding 
planning decisions to assess and manage flood risk impacts for new developments.  
The aim is to, for preference, direct new developments away from high risk of 
flooding areas.  If using a high risk area is unavoidable, the development must be

justified on sustainability grounds and that the consequences of the flooding are 
acceptable.  
9.3.23 The development advice maps (DAM) (Ref. 9-19) are the information considered 
most suitable to determine flood risk zones and when flood risk issues must be 
taken into consideration in planning future development in that area.  
vi. Recommended non-statutory standards for sustainable drainage (SuDS) in 
Wales (Welsh Government, 2017) 
9.3.24 This SuDS approach (Ref. 9-20) aims at reducing the volume of water 
contaminated by sewerage and needing to be pumped for treatment.  This would 
allow new development to use the free capacity in the sewerage network to remove 
the need to install new infrastructure and reducing the risk of flooding.  
vii. Water Strategy for Wales (Welsh Government, 2015) 
9.3.25 The Water Strategy (Ref. 9-21) aims to improve natural resource management of 
water systems.  It aims to improve the resilience of the whole water systems and 
therefore reduce costs to consumers and businesses, including water companies.  
d) Regional 
i. 
Western Wales River Basin Management Plan (RBMP) (NRW, 2015) 
9.3.26 The purpose of RBMP (Ref. 9-22) is to protect and improve the water environment 
in the Western Wales River Basin District (RBD).  The plan includes; classification 
of water bodies; summary of Programme of Measures to achieve statutory 
objectives and statutory objectives for water bodies. 
e) Local 
i. 
City and County of Swansea Council Local Development Plan (2017) 
9.3.27 This adopts a sustainable approach to flood risk by avoiding vulnerable 
development occurring within flood hazard areas.  Policy RP4 Avoidance of Flood 
Risk (Ref. 9-23) states that development will not be permitted if it causes an 
increase to flooding on or off site. 
ii. City and County of Swansea Council Unitary Development Plan (2008) 
9.3.28 Policy EV35: Surface water run-off, and Policy EV36: Development and Flood Risk, 
are the relevant policies in CCS Unitary Development Plan (Ref. 9-24). Policy EV35 
affects developments that will lead to additional surface water run-off or cause a 
reduction of the quality of surface water run-off, and encourages SuDS 
implementation wherever practical to counteract this. Policy EV36 only allows new 
developments within flood risk areas if developers can justify the location by 
proving the flooding consequences associated with the development are 
acceptable.

iii. The City and County of Swansea Council Strategic Flood Consequence 
Assessment (SFCA) Stage 2 (2012) 
9.3.29 Stage 1 SFCA (Ref. 9-25) is a desk based study of flood risk, and Stage 2 (Ref. 9-
26) is a more detailed assessment of flood risks.  This determined that the main 
flood risk to the area is from fluvial and tidal water sources, with surface water also 
occurring and groundwater risk considered minimal. A Stage 3 SFCA was not 
required as Stage 1 and 2 satisfied the requirements of TAN15 for the potential 
development.  
iv. The City and County of Swansea Flood Risk Management Plan (FRMP) (2015) 
9.3.30 The FRMP (Ref. 9-27) contains the overview of the flood risk within the CCS area 
and the objective to reduce flood risk in significant flood risk areas for six years to 
2021.  The plan covers flooding from surface water, groundwater and ordinary 
watercourse.  NRW are responsible for flooding from main rivers and reservoirs.  
v. The City and County of Swansea Site Waste Management Plan (SWMP) 
(2015) 
9.3.31 The SWMP details how resources will be managed and how waste will be 
minimised and reduced, re-used and recycled wherever possible.  This will include 
guidelines such as to keep waste segregated as it’s generated to save time and 
money. 
vi. The City and County of Swansea Local Flood Risk Management Strategy 
(LFRMS) (2013) 
9.3.32 Under the LFRMS (Ref. 9-28), flood risk from surface run-off, groundwater and 
ordinary watercourses have been considered.  The LFRMS is the method through 
which the LLFA leads and co-ordinates flood risk management on a day to day 
basis.  Local strategies must include objectives and methods for managing local 
flood risk, as well as timescales and cost of implementation.  
9.4 
Methodology 
a) Scope of the assessment 
9.4.1 
The scope of this assessment has been determined through a formal EIA scoping 
process undertaken with the Planning Inspectorate (PINS) on behalf of the 
Secretary of State (SoS) and subsequent consultation with key consultees, 
including NRW and CCS. Comments raised on the EIA Scoping Report by NRW in 
their letter dated 14 November 2014 have been taken into account in the 
development of the assessment methodology and these are detailed where 
relevant in this chapter. Responses to the comments raised in the EIA Scoping 
Opinion, NRW and CCS can be found in Table 9-2. 
i. 
Water Quality 
9.4.2 
The scope of the water quality assessment has been undertaken in accordance 
with the relevant applicable regulations as outlined in Section 9.3 above. 
Abergelli 2018 ES – CHAPTER 9: WATER QUALITY AND FLOOD RISK 
Prepared for:  Abergelli Power Limited  
AECOM 
 
9-9 
 
9.4.3 
The assessment consisted of a desk-based study to establish the baseline 
conditions of the water environment within the Project Site and surroundings, 
informed by the literature and internet-based information sources and 
supplemented by responses received via direct consultation with relevant 
regulatory authorities and stakeholders. 
9.4.4 
The potential impacts on the water environment during the construction, operational 
and decommissioning phases of the Project have been identified and assessed, 
taking into account the embedded design mitigations as contained in Chapter 3: 
Project and Site Description and the comments raised in the Scoping Opinion 
Report by the SoS (Appendix 4.2). 
ii. Flooding 
9.4.5 
Potential effects from the development have been assessed with reference to the 
Highway Agency’s Design Manual for Roads and Bridges (DMRB, HD/45/09) (Ref. 
9-29) in relation to the water environment. Although primarily developed for the 
assessment of water quality effects, the method can also be applied to drainage 
and flooding effects and provides a robust and accepted method for assessing the 
significance of effects 
9.4.6 
This chapter has also followed guidance set out in NPS EN-1 and TAN15: 
Development and Flood Risk. Consultation with NRW, and with the LLFA, has also 
been undertaken for the preparation of the FCA, which has informed this 
assessment, as noted in Section 9.4b.  The FCA (Appendix 9.1) supporting this ES, 
considers the impact of the Project on flooding and drainage. 
9.4.7 
Sustainable disposal of surface water through SuDS design has been proposed 
wherever possible. 
9.4.8 
Appropriate methods for the construction of the Gas Connection and Electrical 
Connection at water crossings to prevent adverse effects on drainage and flooding 
have been considered.  
b) Consultation 
9.4.9 
The scope of the assessment has also been informed by ongoing consultation with 
statutory consultees throughout the design and assessment process, including past 
and recent email communications with the SoS, and a meeting with NRW and 
CCS. A summary of the comments raised and responses are detailed in Table 9-2.

watercourses and steep catchment, there is low risk of 
flooding from ordinary watercourses. Diversion of the 
ordinary watercourse through Generating Equipment

Discussion and agreement of approach to assessing 
the flood risk from ordinary watercourse. CCS 
understands the limitations of the UFMfSW and 
accepts that the flood risk to the site is likely to be more 
from overland flow than fluvial sources. Therefore 
maintenance of flow routes is important to reduce this 
flood risk and any downstream impacts. The overland 
flow path on the eastern boundary of the Generating 
Equipment Site should be kept clear and formalised to 
encourage water to flow downslope, away from the 
development and nearby Solar Farm and towards the 
ecological mitigation area to the south.  The 7 m 
easement could be relaxed provided some access is 
maintained. Overland flow routes should be formalised 
along the eastern edge of the site and kept clear. 
Easement of these routes is not necessary.

In regards to run-off rates, the approach used is

preference to FSR or earlier versions of FEH in line

area therefore includes the area within the Project Site Boundary and a potential 
zone of influence (ZoI) which is defined as a distance over which significant effects 
on important water receptors/features can reasonably have the potential to occur. 
In this case, from the perspective of water receptors/features, this is defined as a 
1 km buffer zone of influence (ZoI) around the Project Site Boundary (Figure 1.1 of 
Appendix 9.2). 
9.4.11 The 1 km buffer ZoI has been determined considering a number of factors, 
including the number of water receptors likely to be affected by the Project, taking 
into account the nature of the Project, adopted assessment methodology as 
described in Chapter 4: Approach to Environmental Impact Assessment, the 
embedded design mitigation measures, the Outline CEMP, outline drainage 
strategy (Appendix E of the FCA provided in Appendix 9.1) and the proximity of 
each identified receptor to the Project Site.  
d) Sensitivity and value of resources 
9.4.12 The sensitivity of each water feature/receptor identified with respect to the water 
quality and water resources within the study area has been determined by the 
importance of the affected features/receptors in the study area. 
9.4.13 A list of the main water features/receptors identified and considered within the study 
area is given below. The list takes into account the site’s characteristics, 
background project documents, relevant reference documents and professional 
judgement. 
 WFD classified water bodies ('Main Rivers'); 
 Ordinary water bodies including springs, ponds, reservoirs, lakes and rivulets; 
 Groundwater bodies and aquifer(s); 
 Licensed groundwater and surface water abstractions; 
 Flood risk zones; and 
 Water dependent conservation areas and other key environmental receptors 
such as sites of importance for nature conservation (SINC), ancient 
Woodlands, SSSI (Figure 9.2). 
9.4.14 The criteria used in assessing the value and sensitivity of key water 
features/receptors within the study area are set out in Table 9-3.

Significance of effect and definitions 
9.4.16 The significance of the potential effects of the Project on the water environment is 
defined by the sensitivity of and the magnitude of the impact on the 
receptors/features within the study area. 
9.4.17 Based on the receptor sensitivity and the magnitude of impact on the water 
environment, the definition of the significance of effect on the water features 
receptors are set out in Table 9-5.

9.4.18 Following the classification of an effect as detailed in Table 9-5, a clear statement is 
made as to whether the effect is ‘significant’ or ‘not significant’.  
9.4.19 Effects predicted to be Minor or Negligible are considered to be manageable and 
are therefore ‘Not Significant’ and effects assessed as Moderate or Major are 
considered to be 'Significant'. 
9.5 
Baseline Environment 
9.5.1 
This section describes the baseline environmental characteristics for the Project 
Site and surroundings with specific reference to the water quality and water 
resources within the study area. 
9.5.2 
In order to assess the potential impacts and effects of the Project, the baseline 
environmental conditions and relevant water features/receptors that currently exist 
in the study area have been determined from a number of sources including the 
following: 
 British Geological Survey (BGS) 1:50,000 Series Geological Maps Sheet 247 
Swansea (England and Wales); 
 Information from Natural Resources Wales (NRW) website and consultation; 
 Information from City Council of Swansea (CCS) website and consultation; 
 Information from Ordnance Survey Map covering the study area; 
 Report of the Western Wales River Basin Management Plan (RBMP) 
 Relevant European Union (EU) legislation – Status report of WFD designated 
water bodies identified within the study area;  
 Observations made during a site visit on 8 November 2017; and 
 Envirocheck report, Landmark (2017) (Appendix 10.1).

9.5.3 
Taking into account the defined study area as described in Section 9.4(c), the value 
and sensitivity of the main environmental receptors and resources identified within 
the study area is summarised in Table 9-11 (water quality) and Table 9-12 (flood 
risk and surface water drainage). 
9.5.4 
The criteria used in determining the sensitivity and value, significance of the 
magnitude and effects impact on the water environment baseline conditions are set 
out in Section 9.4 of this ES. 
a) 
Topography and land use 
9.5.5 
The topography of the study area is reasonably elevated and steeply sloping. 
Ground levels across the Project Site vary from approximately 146 m AOD in the 
north with ground levels at the Generating Equipment Site reaching an elevation of 
about 90 m AOD before generally falling in a southerly and south easterly direction 
to an elevation of approximately 80 m AOD along the Afon Llan River and its 
tributaries.  Felindre Gas Compressor Station located immediately to the north of 
the Access Road is constructed on raised ground at a level of approximately 87 m 
AOD. This is approximately 5-8 m above the flood plain of the field drainage and 
ordinary watercourse to the south of the Access Road, which drains to the Afon 
Llan. 
9.5.6 
The land within the Project Site is currently used for sheep and horse grazing with 
existing development consisting of farm buildings and access roads. The area 
surrounding the Project Site is, at present, predominantly rural, although there is 
Felindre Park and Share to the south and a substantial amount of utility 
infrastructure in the area, some of which cross the Project Site. There are a number 
of solar farms in fields neighbouring the Site. Some springs and drainage 
channels/ditches within the Project Site drain the land and discharge into the Afon 
Llan River. The current land uses are considered “Less vulnerable” to flooding 
according to the TAN15 classifications. 
b) Ground conditions and hydrogeology 
9.5.7 
A full description of ground conditions and hydrogeology of the Project Site is 
provided in Chapter 10: Geology, Ground Conditions and Hydrogeology. A 
summary is provided here to understand the possible linkages with surface water 
features and groundwater resources explicitly used for private groundwater supply 
within the study area. 
9.5.8 
The British Geological Survey (BGS), online mapping data, provides details of both 
the regional and local geology of the study area. The data indicates that the Project 
Site is underlain by bedrock of the Grovesend Formation, comprising mudstone, 
siltstone and sandstone (Figure 9.3). Superficial deposits across the Project Site 
are quite variable. However, they primarily comprise till and glaciofluvial deposits 
(sands and gravels) with a smaller area of peat, to the west of the north-western 
corner of the Project Site (Figure 9.4). The thickness of the superficial deposits 
beneath the Project Site is currently unknown. Groundwater occurs in both the 
superficial and bedrock beneath the study area. 
Abergelli 2018 ES – CHAPTER 9: WATER QUALITY AND FLOOD RISK 
 
Prepared for:  Abergelli Power Limited  
AECOM 
 
9-24 
 
9.5.9 
NRW has designated the bedrock geology beneath the Project Site and the study 
area as a Secondary A aquifer with the superficial deposits designated a mixture of 
Secondary A aquifer and unproductive strata. Secondary A aquifers are permeable 
layers capable of supporting water supplies at a local rather than strategic scale 
and, in some cases, can form a vital source of base flow to rivers. Unproductive 
strata are rock layers or drift deposits with low permeability that have negligible 
significance for water supply or river base flow. Soils in the study area are variable, 
designated to have high, intermediate and low leachate potential. 
9.5.10 Groundwater movement within the underlying geology is likely to be limited 
considering the aquifer designations as discussed above. Although the Project Site 
is elevated, shallow or perched groundwater within the superficial deposits is 
expected to be reasonably close to the surface and in hydraulic connectivity with 
the surface watercourses present within the Project Site and immediate 
surroundings.  From the site visit in November 2017, it was noted that infiltration is 
likely to be limited on the Generating Equipment Site where collections of surface 
water and saturated ground were observed throughout the locality. The timing of 
the visit did not follow a particularly wet period of weather. 
9.5.11 The objectives of the WFD have been used to assess the groundwater quality in 
the study area. The Carmarthen Carboniferous Coal Measures (Waterbody ID 
GB41002G200600) and Swansea Carboniferous Coal Measures (Waterbody ID 
GB410002G201000) are two WFD groundwater bodies within the study area 
(Figure 9.5). Information on their status regarding water quality is available from 
NRW Rivers and Waterbodies website (accessed October 2017). According to 
NRW website, the current quantitative water quality for both the Carmarthen and 
Swansea water bodies is good and predicted to remain so beyond 2015, based on 
the most recent available data from 2015.  
9.5.12 However, the overall 2015 Cycle 2 Status and current chemical quality for both 
Carmarthen Carboniferous Coal Measures and Swansea Carboniferous Coal 
Measures groundwater bodies are reported to be poor and are expected to remain 
so beyond 2015. There are no identified designated groundwater SPZs or drinking 
water Safeguard Zones with regards to agricultural activities within 1 km of the 
Project Site. Furthermore, information on the status of the Carmarthen and 
Swansea Carboniferous WFD groundwater bodies shows that they are not targeted 
for improvement within the Western Wales River Basin Management Plan (RBMP). 
9.5.13 The Landmark Envirocheck report (Appendix 10.1) has identified no groundwater 
abstraction licences associated with the Project Site. The Landmark report 
identified only one licence located within 100 m of the Project Site, recorded 56 m 
to the north-east for a well at Abergelli Farm, licence number 22/59/4/0027 dated 
February 1993, for general farming and domestic use. Recent date (received on 9 
October 2017) on private groundwater and abstraction licences received from CCS 
and NRW respectively did not identify this licence or any other licences within the 4 
km of the Project Site.

c) Contaminated land 
9.5.14 A detailed assessment of the potential for contaminated land is included in Chapter 
10: Geology, Ground Conditions and Hydrogeology. A summary of the possible 
risks to surface water features and the groundwater bodies and aquifer is provided 
below. 
9.5.15 No intrusive site investigation has been completed to inform this assessment. 
However, as the majority of the Project Site is undeveloped, it is unlikely to have 
experienced significant potentially contaminative activities. Figure 9.6 shows 
current or historical potential pollution point/aerial sources within 1 km of the Project 
Site. It also includes historic landfill and industrial land use activities that have a 
higher potential for ground contamination such as the disused (inert) landfill site 
located approximately 100 m west of the Gas Connection, a coal mine north of 
Abergelli Farm and the Substation towards the south west of the Project Site. 
9.5.16 The Project Site is overlying mine workings. An assessment of the workings, adits 
and mine entries is discussed in Chapter 10: Geology, Ground Conditions and 
Hydrogeology. A comprehensive ground investigation will be undertaken as part of 
embedded mitigation, prior to construction, and will provide more detail of ground 
conditions. 
9.5.17 A mine spoil dump covered approximately three-quarters of the landfill area from 
the former Abergelli Colliery (Figure 9.6). This mine waste largely was removed 
leaving a layer of well compacted mine waste over the majority of the landfill area. 
Part of the ground that was covered by mine spoil was formerly used for drying out 
of water treatment sludge (aluminium sulphate) though this ceased when the landfill 
became operational. No further information regarding potential impacts to the water 
environment from this operation is known. 
d) Surface water and groundwater features 
9.5.18 There are both designated "ordinary" and "main" surface water bodies within the 
study area (Figures B2 and B3, Appendix B of FCA provided in Appendix 9.1). 
Within the Project Site, there are springs and spring-drainage rivulets and drainage 
ditches that drain the Project Site into the Afon Llan River. The Afon Llan River and 
its tributaries are the closest surface water features in the vicinity of the Project Site 
considered in the assessment. The Afon Llan River catchment includes all of the 
Project Site. The Loughor Estuary, alongside other ecological statutory designated 
sites more distant from the Project Site downstream of the Project Site, are also 
discussed. 
9.5.19 There are three WFD classified surface water bodies (Figure 9.1) within the study 
area: the Afon Llan (Water body ID GB110058032070 to the south of the Project 
Site), the Afon Lliw (Water body ID GB110059032100 to the north of the Project 
Site) and the Loughor Estuary (Burry Inlet Inner) (Water body ID GB531005913500 
located approximately 7 km south of the Project Site) into which these water bodies 
discharges.

AECOM 
 
9-26 
 
9.5.20 The Afon Llan River is the closest WFD designated surface watercourse that 
traverses the immediate vicinity of the Project Site. It flows in a south-westerly 
direction and is designated as a Main River by Natural Resources Wales (NRW).  
The Afon Llan borders the southern boundary of the Project Site.  The Afon Llan 
links with the Afon Lliw and the River Loughor, which discharges into Carmarthen 
Bay.  The Power Generation Plant is located approximately 400 m from the Afon 
Llan watercourse.  The rivers will not be directly altered by the Project. 
9.5.21 There is one WFD groundwater body (Table 9-10) (i.e. the Carmarthen 
Carboniferous Coal Measures Water body ID GB41002G200600) in the vicinity of 
the Project Site. This WFD water body is not targeted for improvements within the 
Western Wales RBMP. 
9.5.22 Information about the current and predicted status of the Afon Llan River and the 
other designated WFD water bodies within the study area are available from  NRW 
Cycle 2 River and Waterbodies websites1 (accessed May 2017) and is summarised 
in Table 9-8. Details of groundwater bodies are provided in Table 9-10.

9.5.23 The Afon Lliw is located approximately 1.3 km north of the Project Site and has 
been assessed under the WFD as shown in Table 9-9.  
9.5.24 There are other smaller watercourses in the vicinity of the Project Site that drain to 
the Afon Llan, along with some springs and small ponds. These have not been 
individually assessed previously under the WFD. The selection of waterbodies to 
be evaluated in 2015 was based on the judgment of NRW considering the 
catchment size, available data and overall significance. It is thought that these 
waterbodies were not previously assessed partly due to lack of data and because 
their small size means their overall importance to the river basin district is reduced. 
9.5.25 The largest ordinary watercourse traversing the eastern perimeter of the Project 
Site has been observed to be 2.0-2.5 m wide at the bank and 1 m deep.  Some 
ordinary watercourses will be directly altered by the Project (Figures 2.4-2.6, 
Appendix E of FCA (Outline Drainage Strategy) provided in Appendix 9.1).  
9.5.26 Both the Afon Llan and Afon Lliw discharge to the Loughor Estuary west of 
Swansea, approximately 7 km from the Project Site. The Project Site lies outside of 
the Afon Lliw topographic catchment and therefore it is expected that any direct 
hydraulic connectivity will be limited. The Afon Llan does, however, join with the 
Afon Lliw approximately 9 km downstream of the Project Site. There may also be 
some potential for the cross-transfer of shallow groundwater flows between the two 
catchments. The Loughor Estuary has been assessed under the WFD as shown in 
Table 9-9. NRW has identified that the Loughor Estuary contains designated 
Shellfisheries. 
9.5.27 No surface water abstraction points have been identified within the Project Site. 
The closest surface water abstractions, assumed to be from a tributary of the Afon 
Llan, have been identified approximately 1.6 km northeast and upstream of the 
Project Site.  Accordingly, no impact to this receptor is envisaged and it is not 
considered further in this assessment. 
9.5.28 There are a number of small drainage ditches and land drains which cross the 
Project Site and output into the ordinary watercourses and then the Afon Llan.  
There are also springs with associated streams which discharge into the Afon Llan 
throughout the Project Site.   
9.5.29 There are two heavily vegetated ponds located within the Generating Equipment 
Site. These are of unverified extent owing to vegetation cover but are thought to 
have a radius of approximately 5 m.

e) Flood risk 
9.5.30 There are no flood defence structures in the study area. 
9.5.31 The Lle Geo-Portal  Development Advice Map (DAM) (Ref 9-25) determines that a 
relatively small area in the Project Site, south of the Generating Equipment lie 
within DAM Zone C2 (areas of the floodplain without significant defence 
infrastructure).  Small areas along the eastern edge of the Project Site 
Boundary, east and south of the Generating Equipment Site lie within DAM Zone B 
(areas known to have flooded in the past).  The remainder of the Project Site is 
outside the DAM Zones and considered to be at very low risk of flooding i.e. DAM 
Zone A. Figure D1 in Appendix 9.1 displays the flood zones and Project Site 
Boundary.   
9.5.32 During the site visit, the area between the Felindre Gas Compressor Station and 
the Generating Equipment Site was notably saturated.  It is assumed that this area 
and the lower lying area to the south may be susceptible to groundwater or surface 
water flooding.  This is consistent with BGS groundwater flooding susceptibility 
mapping showing the south area of Project Site as potential groundwater flooding 
at surface, while the rest of the Project Site lies in limited potential or potential for 
flooding properties below ground level.  Chapter 10: Geology, Ground 
Conditions and  Hydrogeology 
describes 
additional 
information 
on 
the 
Landmark Envirocheck Report (2017).  
9.5.33 The literature review has not identified any historic incidents of flooding affecting 
the Project Site from any source.  The references considered are in the References 
section (Section 9.12). 
9.5.34 The CCS PFRA (2011), Level 1 (2010) and Level 2 (2012) SFCA’s do not report 
any recorded flood events from groundwater sources within the CCS region.  The 
FRMP (2015) indicates that there is a low risk of groundwater flooding across the 
CCS region. 
9.5.35 NRW online maps show that reservoir flooding is not predicted to affect the Project 
Site.  This is relevant with respect to the upstream Lliw Reservoir. 
9.5.36 The existing Water Main that crosses the Project Site in a northwest to southeast 
orientation could present a flood risk if inadvertently damaged or leaking.  Previous 
consultation on the Project with Welsh Water ascertained that flow rates in the pipe 
are approximately 1.2.-1.7 m3/s. The flood risk from this source if it were to leak is 
considered to be very low.   
f) 
Artificial water features 
9.5.37 Situated north of the Project Site is Felindre Water Treatment Works with a covered 
reservoir.  There is a Water Main connected to Felindre water treatment works via a 
1.68 m diameter pipe which follows a south-east to north-west direction across the 
Generating Equipment Site and along the line of an existing access track.  The 
treated water is supplied to Swansea, Llanelli and Bridgend areas.

9.5.38 The Lower Lliw Reservoir is also situated north and upstream of the Site, 
approximately 1.1 km away.  It is part of the water supply infrastructure in the 
adjacent Lliw catchment.  
g) Ecological designations 
9.5.39 A detailed description of ecological designations within the study area is provided in 
Chapter 8: Ecology and illustrated in Figures 8.1 and Figure 8.2. A summary of 
features relevant to the assessment of impacts on the water environment is 
provided below. 
9.5.40 The Loughor Estuary is located approximately 7 km west of the Project Site and 
receives water from the Afon Llan and Afon Lliw. It is designated as an SSSI with 
the Burry Inlet further downstream also a designated Ramsar site. Both form part of 
the Carmarthen Bay SAC. 
9.5.41 Two SSSI sites (Figure 9.2) located closer to and potentially in hydraulic 
connectivity with the Project Site are: 
 Nant y Crimp SSSI, located approximately 2.2 km west which is designated for 
its wet pastures, grassland/woodland habitat and marsh fritillary butterfly. The 
Project Site is not located within the catchment of the Nant y Crimp and 
therefore any hydraulic connectivity with the Project Site would be limited to 
potential groundwater flows; and 
 Penllergaer railway cutting SSSI, approximately 3 km to the south-west which 
is designated for geological interest. An unnamed tributary of the Afon Llan 
flows through the Penllergaer SSSI. Geological designations are not relevant to 
this assessment as there will not be any effects of the Project on the geological 
conditions from the perspective of water quality and resources. 
9.5.42 Effects on the SSSIs are addressed in Chapter 8: Ecology. 
9.5.43 There are SINCs situated within and surrounding the Project Site (Figure 9.2). 
Three are considered relevant to this assessment: the Lletty-Morfil SINC, which is 
partly within the Project Site and is designated for purple moor grass and rush 
pasture and scrub habitats; and the Waun Garn Wen and Rhos Fawr SINCs 
adjacent to the Project Site, which are also designated for purple moor grass and 
rush pasture, wet woodland, scrub and watercourse habitats. The SINCs may, 
therefore, have some sensitivity to changes in water table and water quality. The 
area of peat adjacent to the north-west corner of the Project Site extends into the 
Waun Garn Wen SINC. 
h) Drainage 
9.5.44 Most of the Project Site is undeveloped and surface water run-off flows overland 
and through field drains discharging into the Afon Llan. These field drains and 
drainage ditches can be seen to cross the Project Site and flow to the ordinary 
watercourses. The largest ordinary watercourse flows south along the east 
perimeter of the Project Site before discharging to the Afon Llan.

9.5.45 It has been identified that there are no foul sewers within the Project Site, and 
therefore assumed that the foul effluent from the nearby farm and residential 
properties discharge to cess pits and septic tanks.  
i) 
Summary of Receptors 
9.5.46 Based on the information reviewed for this ES, the water quality and resources and 
flood receptors/features with the potential to be affected by the Project have been 
identified.  
9.5.47 Table 9-8 summarises the key receptors and classifies their importance.  This has 
been undertaken using professional judgement and with reference to the baseline 
information and the policy guidance noted in Section 9.3. The identified receptors 
are assessed to have a hydrological or hydraulic connection to the Project Site. The 
Lower Lliw reservoir and Afon Lliw are upgradient and not in direct hydraulic 
continuity so are excluded from further assessment.  Receptors are located in 
Figure 9.2.

9.6 
Embedded Mitigation 
9.6.1 
As detailed in Chapter 3: Project Site and Description, a number of embedded 
mitigation measures have been identified through the iterative EIA process and 
have been incorporated into the design and construction planning of the Project. 
9.6.2 
As these mitigation measures have been embedded into the design, are legal 
requirements or are standard practices that will be implemented, the assessment of 
likely significant effects assumes that they are in place. 
9.7 
Assessment of Effects 
9.7.1 
This section presents the findings of the water quality and resources impact 
assessment and flood risk impact assessment during the construction, operation 
and decommissioning phases of the Project. 
9.7.2 
This section identifies any likely significant effects that are likely to occur and the 
additional mitigation and monitoring measures that are proposed to reduce or 
eliminate the identified significant effects. 
j) 
Construction effects – Power Generation Plant 
i. 
Water Quality and Resources 
9.7.3 
This section considers the potential impacts and effects that construction works for 
the Project pose to water quality and resources.  A description of the anticipated 
scope of the construction works required is included in Chapter 3: Project Site 
and Description. 
9.7.4 
The principal risks of the construction works to water quality and resources 
therefore comprise: 
 Pollution impacts on surface watercourses and groundwater associated with: 
o increased sediment loads in site runoff containing elevated suspended 
sediment levels disturbed during site clearance; 
o the release of hydrocarbons and oils due to a large number of vehicles 
accessing the site, leakages from temporary oil/fuel storage tanks and 
accidental spillages; and 
o accidental leaks of hazardous materials, such as concrete and cement 
products, which can be contained in uncontrolled wash-down water and 
surface water runoff;  
o dewatering of excavations and the discharge of potentially polluted/high 
sediment loading water to the water receptors; and 
o pollution from dust and debris. 
9.7.5 
Measures to address the above have been identified and, where appropriate, are 
included in the embedded mitigation given in Chapter 3: Project and Site 
Description and in the Outline CEMP (Appendix 3.1). 
 
 
Abergelli 2018 ES – CHAPTER 9: WATER QUALITY AND FLOOD RISK 
 
 
Prepared for:  Abergelli Power Limited  
AECOM 
 
9-36 
 
Increased pollution and sediment load 
9.7.6 
The magnitude of potential impacts to surface water receptors will be most 
significant when working in areas adjacent to a water body or drainage channel. If 
they occur, the impacts will be direct and temporary - water quality within the 
affected water body is expected to improve over time as sediments settle or are 
trapped by vegetation and pollutants such as hydrocarbons, oils and other 
hazardous products are dispersed, diluted and treated by natural processes.  
9.7.7 
Surface water runoff from the Project Site will be conveyed to the tributaries of the 
Afon Llan River, east of the Project Site. This tributary to the Afon Llan is a 
designated ordinary watercourse with a Medium sensitivity. Consequently, the 
magnitude of any potential impacts to this water receptor during the construction 
phase of the Project will be Negligible. Accordingly, the significance of effects is 
assessed to be Negligible and no additional mitigation is required. 
9.7.8 
There is potential for hydraulic connectivity (most likely through shallow 
groundwater) and therefore for runoff to migrate to the Lletty-Morfil, Waun Garn 
Wen and Rhos Fawr SINCs located within the  Project Site at approximately 200 m 
and 300 m from the Power Generation Plant (Figure 9.2). Given the approximate 
distances and locations of these features, their Medium sensitivity and the inferred 
groundwater flow direction (Figure 9.2), the magnitude of potential impacts on 
these receptors is assessed as Negligible. Hence the significance of any effects 
will be Negligible and no additional mitigation is required. 
9.7.9 
Surface water runoff from the Project Site may infiltrate and migrate further afield 
via groundwater. The primary groundwater flow direction is assessed to be towards 
the Afon Llan (Figure 9.3) but will be confirmed through future geotechnical/ground 
investigations at the Project Site post DCO Application. The groundwater aquifer 
beneath the Project Site is a WFD designated water body (i.e. Carmarthen 
Carboniferous Coal Measures groundwater body) (Figure 9.5) of medium 
sensititivity. Taking into account its current and forecasted WFD water quality status 
which is expected to remain poor, its dilution and dispersion potential, it is 
envisaged that infiltration of surface runoff will not significantly impact the flow or 
quality of groundwater. The receptor sensitivity is Medium, the magnitude of 
potential impact on groundwater arising from pollution by surface water runoff is 
considered to be Negligible so the significance of effects is assessed to be 
Negligible and no mitigation is required. Potential impacts to groundwater 
resources are discussed in Chapter 10: Geology, Ground Conditions and 
Hydrogeology. 
9.7.10 Runoff from the Generating Equipment Site will contribute only a small proportion of 
flow in the Afon Llan. The Afon Llan is hydrologically connected with the Loughor 
Estuary which is also a WFD designated surface water body of High sensitivity 
located about 7 km south of the Project Site. In the event that surface water runoff 
is accidentally polluted, before it is discharged from the Project Site into the Afon 
Llan River, it will have to travel several kilometres before reaching the Loughor 
Estuary (SAC, SSSI). As such, any pollutants would have settled, dispersed, diluted 
Abergelli 2018 ES – CHAPTER 9: WATER QUALITY AND FLOOD RISK 
 
 
Prepared for:  Abergelli Power Limited  
AECOM 
 
9-37 
 
and be treated by natural processes thereby limiting any subsequent impact to the 
Loughor Estuary.  The sensitivity of the Loughor Estuary is High, the magnitude of 
potential pollution impacts will be Negligible, hence the significance of effect has 
been assessed as Minor and no additional mitigation is required. 
9.7.11 The two existing ponds within the Generating Equipment Site will be lost as a result 
of the Project – Pond 16 and Pond 22. Pond 16 is temporal and Pond 22 holds 
water year round as located in Appendix A8.4, Figure 1. Based on this, from a 
water quality and resources perspective, the potential pollution and sediment 
loading impacts on these ponds is scoped out of the assessment. 
9.7.12 Potential impacts and effects associated with ground instability and piling works are 
discussed in Chapter 10: Geology, Ground Conditions and Hydrogeology. 
Dewatering discharges 
9.7.13 Dewatering of site excavations may be required for piling or construction of 
foundations within the Generating Equipment Site. As described previously, given 
the current and historic land uses, ground contamination is unlikely to pose a 
significant groundwater quality risk as a result of mobilisation of existing 
contaminants. Therefore dewatering of excavations is unlikely to introduce polluted 
water to the water environment. Water removed during dewatering activities may 
contain elevated suspended solids and will be subject to appropriate mitigation 
(e.g. settlement ponds) before discharge to the water environment off-site.  
9.7.14 As noted above, water from dewatering activities will be discharged a treatment 
process (e.g. settlement ponds/oil removal system) and this will likely be 
discharged directly into the tributary to the Afon Llan east of the Project Site. This 
tributary is not a WFD designated water body but an ordinary water body of 
Medium sensitivity. The magnitude of potential impacts from dewatering 
discharges on this tributary to the Afon Llan during construction is considered to be 
Low. Accordingly, the significance of potential effects is assessed as Minor and no 
additional mitigation is required. 
Sediment filled and turbid surface water resulting from dust and debris 
9.7.15 Construction activities have the potential to release debris and dust that may be 
blown into adjacent surface water features. Increased dust levels in surface water 
bodies may reduce the levels of light reaching aquatic plant and animal species 
and cover sensitive habitats on the floor of the streams and ponds. Debris blown 
into water bodies can decrease the aesthetic quality of the water body. Impacts will 
be direct and temporary. 
9.7.16 The Project does not involve any demolition activities therefore high levels of dust 
and debris are unlikely particularly with the implementation of the dust control 
measures incorporated into the Outline CEMP (Appendix 3.1). 
9.7.17 The ordinary surface water bodies (i.e the watercourses close to and within the 
Generating Equipment Site) including the tributary to the Afon Llan east of the the 
Abergelli 2018 ES – CHAPTER 9: WATER QUALITY AND FLOOD RISK

AECOM 
 
9-38 
 
Project Site are potential surface water receptors that could be impacted by dust 
and debris during construction. These will be directly affected by physical works 
however the embedded mitigation measures in the Outline CEMP (Appendix 3.1) 
will control potential pollution impacts. The sensitivity of the receptors is Medium, 
the magnitude of impacts associated with dust generation and debris has been 
assessed as Negligible. Accordingly, the significance of effects is assessed to be 
Negligible no additional mitigation is required. 
9.7.18 It is envisaged that the embedded mitigation measures will help control dust and 
debris related impacts such that they do not affect waterbodies and SINCs at a 
distance from the Power Generation Plant. The sensitivity of the ordinary 
waterbodies and SINCs within the Project Site is Medium. In the event of any 
accidental escape of dust and debris into any of the ordinary surface water 
receptors (e.g. ponds, rivulets and ditches) within and nearby watercourses (e.g. 
the tributary to the Afon Llan) to the Project Site the magnitude of impact will be 
Negligible. Accordingly, the significance of effect at any of these ordinary water 
receptors (i.e. the tributary to the Afon Llan, ponds, rivulets and ditches) is 
assessed as Negligible and no additional mitigation is required. 
9.7.19 The magnitude of the potential impacts likely to arise during the construction works 
on the identified water receptors at the Power Generation Plant are considered to 
be negligible. Accordingly the effect significance on the water receptors within the 
Project Site and study area is assessed as minor or negligible and Not significant. 
ii. Flooding 
9.7.20 This section considers the potential impacts and effect that construction works for 
the Power Generation Plant may have on flood risk and drainage. A description of 
the anticipated scope of construction works required is included in Chapter 3: 
Project and Site Description.  The construction phase is expected to take 
approximately 22 months. 
9.7.21 The potential flood risks include: 
 Damage to Water Main;  
 Water Main temporary bridge; and  
 Maintenance Compound and construction car parking within temporary 
Laydown Area. 
Damage to Water main 
9.7.22 A 1.68 m diameter Water Main, the Felindre-Margam trunk main, traverses the 
Generating Equipment Site, and is a key part of the main water supply 
infrastructure in the area.  The exact location and depth of the Water Main will be 
determined during site investigations (currently scheduled to be completed in 
January 2018), liaison with Dwr Cymru Welsh Water and a precautionary 
safeguarded area of 30 m  has been allowed for either side of the assumed location 
of the Water Main during construction to avoid the chance of striking the Water 
Main.  Following survey and discussion of construction methodology with Dwr 
Cymru Welsh Water it may be possible to reduce the safeguarded area. 
Abergelli 2018 ES – CHAPTER 9: WATER QUALITY AND FLOOD RISK 
 
 
Prepared for:  Abergelli Power Limited  
AECOM 
 
9-39 
 
9.7.23 Within the Water Main easement area, the existing ground level has been retained.  
In the very unlikely event of an accidental rupture, any resultant outflow is likely to 
pass through the Project Site but is unlikely to impact the elevated Generating 
Equipment Site.  The predicted flow volumes and land levels are such that the 
adjacent ordinary watercourses, either side of the main, and the receiving Afon Llan 
should accommodate the temporary increase in overland flow until the fracture is 
repaired or flow is halted, avoiding an effect on third parties. Therefore, based on 
the sensitivity of the receptor being Low, and a Low magnitude impact as a result 
of embedded mitigation and accounting for the unlikely event of an accident, the 
significance of effect via safeguarding is predicted to be Negligible, and therefore 
not significant.  
Water Main Temporary Bridge 
9.7.24 The Water Main will be crossed by a temporary bridge designed for construction 
loads from the Access Road to Generating Equipment Site.  Welsh Water will be 
consulted during detailed design to include the required protective measures to the 
crossing to preserve the Water Main’s integrity.  There will also be a specialist 
engineering consultant on site during the bridge’s construction to ensure the safe 
crossing of heavy loads in the construction period, some in excess of 300 tons, 
over the Water Main.  Historic Welsh Water consultation has preferred a Bailey 
bridge solution, previously used to cross the same Water Main, which will be 
discussed further. Any crossing solution will be subject to Welsh Water agreement. 
With a receptor sensitivity of Low and a predicted impact magnitude of Negligible 
owing to appropriate loading mitigation, the effect significance predicted to be 
Negligible, and therefore not significant. 
Maintenance Compound and construction car parking within the temporary 
Laydown Area 
9.7.25 The temporary Laydown Area will provide storage space for materials, plant and 
equipment.  It will also comprise accommodation and welfare facilities for 
construction staff as well as parking.  The location of the Laydown Area is currently 
greenfield.  The construction of the Laydown Area will involve vegetation clearance 
and laying down of granular material which, subject to infiltration tests, should 
permit surface water to drain to ground at a rate close to the existing conditions.  
The granular area amounts to 2.8 ha.  The footprints of the construction compound 
building facilities will result in some, temporary, loss of surface draining area; 
however, this amounts to a negligible portion of the Laydown Area.   
9.7.26 The temporary, low permeability of the surface during construction from building 
facilities and changes in runoff have not been considered in calculations for 
permanent construction runoff.  Therefore, this has not been allowed for in the 
compensatory attenuation pond, proposed for the south eastern corner of the 
Generating Equipment Site.  However, there is provision for consideration of 
temporary runoff in the Outline CEMP (Appendix 3.1).  The temporary Laydown 
Area will be returned to its original pre-construction composition (grassland) 
following construction. Based on the sensitivity of the receptor (other non-specific 
locations within study area) being Negligible because of the very low flood risk, 
Abergelli 2018 ES – CHAPTER 9: WATER QUALITY AND FLOOD RISK

AECOM 
 
9-40 
 
and the Negligible magnitude of the impact through embedded mitigation of 
predominantly gravel surfacing. The significance of the temporary effect is 
considered to be Negligible. 
9.7.27 The size of the temporary Laydown Area car park is 0.3 ha and is additional to the 
2.8 ha referred to above for the remainder of the Laydown Area i.e. it is 
approximately 10% of the total Laydown Area.  The surface of the car parking area 
is assumed to be constructed using a gravel / granular surface finish, under the 
‘General Site Area’ runoff designation of the Outline Drainage Strategy (Appendix E 
of FCA provided in Appendix 9.1).  This should, subject to infiltration tests, permit 
surface water to drain to ground at a rate close to existing conditions. Based on the 
sensitivity of the receptor (other non-specific locations within study area) being 
Negligible because of the very low flood risk, and the Negligible magnitude of the 
impact through embedded mitigation, the significance of the permanent effect is 
considered to be Negligible. 
k) Construction effects - Gas Connection  
i. 
Water Quality and Resources 
9.7.28 The potential impacts associated with the activities and the water receptors likely to 
be impacted during the construction phase are the same as those identified for the 
Power Generation Plant. From water quality and resources perspective, it is 
envisaged that the Gas Pipeline will not give rise to an increase in impermeable 
area within the Project Site and impact upon the surface water run-off regime for 
the Gas Connection. Consequently, given the nature of the works and the size of 
the area required for the Gas Connection construction works, the overall effects of 
the potential impacts associated with the construction activities at the Gas 
Connection areas are considered to be similar or less than the impacts determined 
at the Power Generation Plant and as detailed above. 
9.7.29 Accordingly, given that the water receptors and their sensitivities remains the same, 
the magnitude of the potential water quality impacts likely to arise during the 
construction works at the Gas Connection point is considered to be Negligible and 
the overall significance of effects on the range of sensitivity water receptors as a 
result of the construction activities is therefore considered to range from minor to 
Negligible and therefore Not significant with no further mitigation required. 
ii. Flooding 
9.7.30 No Gas Connection effects for flooding have been identified during the construction 
phase. 
l) 
Construction effects – Electrical Connection 
i. 
Water Quality and Resources 
9.7.31 A detailed description of the construction activities for the Electrical Connection is 
provided in Chapter 3: Project and Site Description. In summary, the majority of 
the Electrical Connection route runs along side the new section of the Access Road  
Abergelli 2018 ES – CHAPTER 9: WATER QUALITY AND FLOOD RISK 
 
 
Prepared for:  Abergelli Power Limited  
AECOM 
 
9-41 
 
9.7.32 The potential impacts associated with the activities and the water receptors likely to 
be impacted during this construction phase are likely to be similar to those 
identified for the Power Generation Plant. Consequently, given the nature of the 
works and the size of the area required for the Electrical Connection construction 
works, the overall effects of the potential impacts associated with the construction 
activities at the Electrical Connection are considered to be similar, but slightly less 
than the impacts determined at the Power Generation Plant as detailed above. 
9.7.33 Taking into account the medium sensitivity of the groundwater body beneath the 
Project Site and the current and forecasted WFD status (i.e. poor water quality) for 
the groundwater body, the Magnitude of potential impacts likely to arise from  the 
installation of the Electrical Connection is considered to be Negligible. Hence the 
significance of effect is assessed as Negligible. 
9.7.34 Additionally, given that the water receptors and their sensitivities remain the same, 
the overall Magnitude of the potential water quality impacts likely to arise during 
the construction of the Electrical Connection is considered to be Negligible and the 
overall significance of effects on the range of sensitivity water receptors as a result 
of the construction activities is therefore considered to range from Minor to 
Negligible and therefore Not significant with no further mitigation required. 
ii. Flooding 
9.7.35 No Electrical Connection effects for flooding have been identified during the 
construction phase. 
m) Operational Effects – Power Generation Plant 
9.7.36 A full description of the operational phase of the Project is included in Chapter 3: 
Project and Site Description.  
i. 
Water Quality and Resources 
9.7.37 The main activities with the potential to affect the water environment have been 
identified as follows: 
 Potable water use for staff welfare and discharge of grey water/sewage (i.e. 
treated foul wastewater discharges); 
 Water for emergency use (e.g. fire control) (water discharges); 
 Storage and use of fuels or other chemicals on-site; and 
 Vehicle movement to and around the Project Site. 
9.7.38 The key risks to the water environment during the operational phase include: 
 Pollution from oil (lubrication etc.) and fuels leakage from storage facilities or 
resulting from accidental spillages during delivery which may be carried by 
surface water runoff discharging to the water environment through the 
proposed surface water drainage system; and 
 Water quality impacts associated with treated wastewater discharges.

Pollution  
9.7.39 Within the drainage strategy (Appendix E of Appendix 9.1) it is proposed that 
surface water runoff from the Power Generation Plant will be discharged either via 
infiltration (where ground conditions allow) or to the local watercourses on and 
around the Power Generation Plant which eventually drain to the Afon Llan. It is 
expected that the Power Generation Plant drainage will include a combination of 
piped and SuDS systems, including oil interceptors, trapped gullies/filter drains, 
attenuation ponds and swales providing appropriate water quality treatment stages 
in line with current guidance to reduce the risk of surface water and groundwater 
contamination. 
9.7.40 The tributary to the Afon Llan east of the Project Site will be the receiving surface 
water body for discharges from the Project Site. The sensitivity of this water body is 
Medium. Taking into account the embedded mitigation measures, the Magnitude 
of potential impacts from pollution during the operational phase is considered to be 
Negligible. Accordingly, the significance of effects is therefore assessed to be 
Negligible. 
9.7.41 The potential water quality related pollutants likely to arise from the Project Site 
during operation are expected to be hydrocarbon-related, mainly from fuel, oil and 
lubricant stored at the Project Site. Where pollution occurs due to a breach of the 
embedded mitigation measures, impacts arising from leachate from the attenuation 
pond or accidental hydrocarbon spillage, for example, there is the potential for 
infiltration to groundwater to occur. However, the impacts will likely be localised. 
The sensitivity of the groundwater beneath the Project Site is Medium. Taking into 
account natural attenuation, the quantity of hydrocarbon likely to be stored at the 
Project Site at a given time as well as the dilution potential of the groundwater, the 
magnitude of potential impacts arising from pollution is Negligible. Accordingly, the 
significance of effects is assessed to be Negligible and no additional mitigation is 
required. 
Water quality impacts associated with treated wastewater discharges  
9.7.42 The quantity of foul effluent generated on site is expected to be small due to the 
limited number of workers on site at any one time during regular operational hours. 
Connection to a public sewer is not deemed feasible. The drainage strategy has 
considered the use of either septic tanks within the site or a package sewage 
treatment plants for foul effluent. However, package treatment plants are the 
preferred option, subject to detailed design following completion of ground 
investigations. The choice of one or other of these disposal methods is not 
considered to have a material effect on the impact assessment. Due to the small 
quantity of foul water generated during operations, it is anticipated that treated 
water can be discharged via infiltration (soakaway) on site. The foul water drainage 
system will be positioned to minimise the risk of inundation by floodwaters. Where 
there is an inadequate unsaturated zone beneath the site, the option of discharging 
to local watercourses will be adopted. Any discharges will be subject to the 
Abergelli 2018 ES – CHAPTER 9: WATER QUALITY AND FLOOD RISK

AECOM 
 
9-43 
 
Environmental Permitting Regulations and will need to meet quality criteria set by 
NRW.  
9.7.43 The sensitivity of the surface water and/or groundwater receptors (i.e. the tributary 
to the east of the Afon Llan and/or Carmarthen Carboniferous Coal Measures 
groundwater body beneath the Project Site) likely to receive foul effluent from the 
Project Site is Medium. Taking into account the quantity of treated foul 
waste/wastewater likely to be generated from the packaged sewage treatment plant 
and dilution properties of these receiving receptors, the magnitude of pollution 
impacts from discharges is considered to be Negligible. Hence, the significance of 
effect is considered to be Negligible and not significant. 
9.7.44 It envisaged that temporary toilets with appropriate foul waste facility will be in 
place during maintenance operation and all foul waste generated during this period 
will be taken off-site for disposal at appropriate facilities by specialist contractors. 
Accordingly, no impact on water receptors is expected and no further mitigation is 
required. 
ii. Flooding 
9.7.45 Potential impacts and effects on flood risk and surface water drainage during 
operation are detailed in this section. 
Surface water runoff from impermeable areas  
9.7.46 There will be a change in the existing surface water drainage behaviour and 
storage capacity as a result of the development.  This will result in a reduction in 
infiltration rates compared to existing conditions.  To compensate for this impact, an 
attenuation pond is proposed for the south eastern corner of the Generating 
Equipment Site.  The purpose of the attenuation pond is to attenuate surface water 
runoff in order to maintain the equivalent greenfield runoff. Additional information 
regarding the attenuation pond is in FCA Section 8.4. The discharge will enter the 
ordinary watercourse immediately to the east of the Generating Equipment Site via 
a drainage swale, subject to the agreement of CCS.  An emergency overflow will be 
provided to the attenuation pond to prevent the site becoming inundated in the 
event of an extreme rainfall event. 
9.7.47 The sensitivity of the receptor (Generating Equipment Site) is considered to be 
High as a result of the Generating Equipment Site coinciding with an area of high 
risk of surface water, and historic (Dam Zone B), flooding.  The magnitude of the 
impact is considered to be Negligible through the embedded attenuation 
mitigation.  The significance of the permanent effect is therefore considered to be 
Minor and Not significant. 
9.7.48 For the Access Road, and internal roads, it is proposed that roadside swales or 
infiltration drains will be used to remove and convey surface water from the road 
surface. Alternatively, where there are space constraints, the new site roads will be 
kerbed and drain via road gullies with pollution control measures. It is proposed that 
roadside swales will discharge to the nearest local watercourse, attenuated the 
Abergelli 2018 ES – CHAPTER 9: WATER QUALITY AND FLOOD RISK

AECOM 
 
9-44 
 
existing greenfield runoff rate.  The sensitivity of the Access Road as a flood risk 
receptor is considered to be Negligible since the Access Road is in a very low 
flood risk area.  The magnitude of the impact is considered to be Low through 
embedded mitigation.  The significance of the permanent effect is therefore 
considered to be Negligible, and Not significant. 
Drainage System Modifications (diversions of ditches for cut offs including Gas 
Connection diversion, swales) 
9.7.49 The existing site benefits from a combination of ordinary watercourses and 
drainage ditches that drain surface water towards the Afon Llan main river.  The 
presence of the development may impede existing surface water flow paths.  Cut 
off drainage ditches will be placed around the uphill site perimeter of the 
Generating Equipment Site.  The new drainage ditches will be designed to divert 
existing surface water runoff around the Project Site and downstream to re-join the 
existing drainage ditches and local watercourses.  They will also be designed to 
avoid any loss of existing conveyance capacity.  The sensitivity of the Generating 
Equipment Site as a flood risk receptor is considered to be High as a result of the 
Generating Equipment Site coinciding with an area of high risk of surface water and 
historic (Dam Zone B), flooding.  The magnitude of the impact is considered to be 
Negligible through the embedded drainage diversion mitigation.  The significance 
of the permanent effect is therefore considered to be Minor and Not significant. 
9.7.50 The new Access Road may also impede existing surface water drainage channels 
and overland flow routes.  Therefore, existing field drainage that coincides with the 
new Access Road will be culverted or bridged for a short length to allow flow up to 
the 1 in 100 year return period.   This is required in the area to the south of the 
Felindre Gas Compressor Station, where the new Access Road extends from the 
existing access road, and swings east and northeast towards the Generating 
Equipment Site.  The sensitivity of the Access Road as a flood risk receptor is 
considered to be Negligible since the Access Road is in a very low flood risk area.  
The magnitude of the impact is considered to be Low.  The significance of the 
permanent effect is therefore considered to be Negligible, and Not significant. 
Water Main Permanent Bridge 
9.7.51 The Water Main will be crossed by a single, permanent access bridge replacing the 
temporary one for construction to allow access from the new Access Road and 
Laydown Area.  This section of road will be built on an embankment above the 
easement or on a suspended bridge structure. The embankment would include 
open pipes to allow surface water run-off from the north to drain through and the 
suspended bridge option allows surface water to flow unhindered underneath 
without being impeded.  It is considered that the sensitivity of the bridge to flood 
risk is Low because the crossing is in an area of low risk of surface water flooding.  
The predicted magnitude of the impact is Negligible through the implementation of 
embedded mitigation to avoid flow impedance.  The significance of the permanent 
effect is therefore considered to be Negligible and Not significant.

Impedance and storage of overland flow route 
9.7.52 There is an existing overland flow route that crosses the eastern boundary of the 
Generating Equipment Site, which also flanks an ordinary watercourse immediately 
east.  This route, according to NRW surface water maps is considered to be 
‘medium to high’ risk of surface water flooding. Part of this overland flow route 
could enter the Generating Equipment Site because of the raised topography of the 
land surrounding the northern tip of the Project Site.  To mitigate this potential 
impact, localised land reprofiling and appropriate orientation of the uphill perimeter 
ditch is planned.  In the event that some flow does enter the site, the onsite 
drainage and surface water attenuation storage in the south eastern corner has 
been designed to accommodate it. 
9.7.53 There is land raising at the Generating Equipment Site, which could impede the 
existing overland flow route to be diverted along the eastern boundary of the 
Project Site. CCS have noted the need to retain access to this overland flow path 
along the eastern boundary of the Generating Equipment Site.  This means it 
should be kept clear and formalised to encourage water downslope and away from 
the development towards the Ecological Mitigation Area to the south. By taking 
these steps, it would provide the access easement required by CCS for 
maintenance access to the watercourse.  This would need to be subject to an 
agreement between APL and CCS, but legislation permits access by CCS for up to 
7 m either side of the ordinary watercourse. 
9.7.54 The sensitivity of the Generating Equipment Site receptor as a flood risk receptor is 
considered to be High as a result of the Project Site coinciding with an area of high 
risk of surface water, and historic (DAM Zone B) flooding.  The magnitude of the 
impact is considered to be Negligible through the embedded mitigation to 
accommodate and retain the overland flow path.  The significance of the permanent 
effect is therefore considered to be Minor. 
n) Operational effects - Gas Connection 
i. 
Water Quality and Resources 
9.7.55 A detailed description of the activities at the Gas Connection point during this phase 
is provided in Chapter 3: Project and Site Description. From a water quality and 
resources point of view, no impact is expected to arise from the Gas Connection 
during the operational phase of the Project. The effects are not material during the 
operation of the Project and have been scoped out of the assessment. No 
mitigation is therefore required. 
ii. Flooding 
9.7.56 The only permanent structure constructed for the Gas Connection is the Above 
Ground Installation (AGI) at the connection to the National Gas Transmission 
System (Figure 3.4), which will change the infiltration capacity of the ground.   
9.7.57 The installation will have exposed plant on reinforced foundations with gravel 
surfacing in between.  The detailed layout will be determined in the next design 
Abergelli 2018 ES – CHAPTER 9: WATER QUALITY AND FLOOD RISK

AECOM 
 
9-46 
 
phase. It is anticipated that, like the main Generating Equipment Site, infrastructure 
will be identified to appropriately attenuate surface water runoff in order to maintain 
the equivalent greenfield runoff.  The total size of the AGI, including access spur 
road is approximately 0.3 ha.  The sensitivity of the AGI as a flood risk receptor is 
considered to be Negligible as a result of the AGI being located in an area of very 
low surface water risk.  The magnitude of the impact is considered to be Negligible 
through the embedded attenuation mitigation. The significance of the permanent 
effect is therefore considered to be Negligible and Not significant. 
o) Operational effects – Electrical Connection 
i. 
Water Quality and Resources 
9.7.58 Detailed description of the activities at the Electrical Connection during the 
operational phase is provided in Chapter 3: Project and Site Description. For 
water quality and resources, no impact is expected to arise from the Electrical 
Connection location during the operational phase of the Project. The effects are not 
material during the operation of the Electrical Connection and have therefore been 
scoped out of the assessment. No mitigation is therefore required. 
ii. Flooding 
9.7.59 For flooding, no impact is expected to arise from the Electrical Connection during 
the operational phase of the Electrical Connection. The effects are not material 
during the operation of the Electrical Connection and have therefore been scoped 
out of the assessment. No mitigation is therefore required. 
p) Decommissioning effects – Power Generation Plant 
i. 
Water Quality and Resources 
9.7.60 The assessment has considered the effects of decommissioning the Power 
Generation Plant after 25 years. At that time, the Generating Equipment would be 
removed and the Generating Equipment Site re-instated to a similar condition as 
before construction. The decommissioning phase would be likely to be of a similar 
duration to construction i.e. 22 months.  Based on the principle of the construction 
effects being wholly reversed, the assessment considers that decommissioning will 
not result in any change to the effects identified for construction and operation. The 
significance of effects would be Negligible and no further mitigation is required. 
ii. Flooding 
9.7.61 Reinstatement of the Power Generation Plant to the existing characteristics would 
bring back the drainage benefits of the existing ‘greenfield’ characteristics. The 
significance of effects would be Negligible and no further mitigation is required.  
q) Decommissioning effects – Gas Connection 
9.7.62 The assessment has also considered the effects of decommissioning the Gas 
Connection after 25 years. It is probable that the Gas Connection may be left in situ 
as this is likely to cause less environmental effects than removal. 
Abergelli 2018 ES – CHAPTER 9: WATER QUALITY AND FLOOD RISK 
 
 
Prepared for:  Abergelli Power Limited  
AECOM 
 
9-47 
 
9.7.63 Assuming the Gas Pipeline is left in situ, no impact from the Gas Connection on 
water quality and resources and flooding is expected during the decommissioning 
phase of the Project and no additional mitigation is required. 
r) 
Decommissioning effects – Electrical Connection 
9.7.64 As for the Gas Connection, no impact from the Electrical Connection on water 
quality and resources and flooding is expected during this phase of the Project. 
Accordingly no additional mitigation is required. 
9.8 
Water Framework Directive Assessment 
9.8.1 
This section provides a summary of the Water Framework Directive Assessment 
(WFD) of the WFD water bodies likely to be impacted by the Project. A separate 
assessment to the EIA required to satisfy the objectives of the WFD is provided in 
Appendix 9.2 and should be read along this section of the ES. 
9.8.2 
It is envisaged that the construction works will require diversion of existing ordinary 
watercourses (i.e. watercourses that are not WFD designated water bodies, but are 
tributaries to WFD designated water bodies) currently crossing the Generating 
Equipment Site to instead run around the perimeter of the Generating Equipment 
Site. This diversion is expected not to significantly affect the general drainage 
paths, flow regime or connectivity of watercourses in the area. It is also anticipated 
that bankside vegetation lost on the Generating Equipment Site will be returned 
along the route of the new watercourses. There may be some short-term loss of 
habitat while vegetation establishes, however, no reduction is expected in the 
longer term. 
9.8.3 
The Project will involve culverting of ordinary watercourses (i.e. watercourses that 
are not WFD designated water bodies) where these are crossed by the Access 
Road. In accordance with the embedded design mitigation the crossings will be 
designed so as not to restrict flood flows, to maintain a natural bed through the 
structure, and where necessary to include specific measures to maintain species 
connectivity through the structure such as otter ledges. There will be some 
permanent loss of bankside habitat at the culverts. However, this will be for short 
lengths only and is therefore not expected to affect the integrity of the aquatic 
ecosystems significantly. 
9.8.4 
There is an existing pond on the Power Generation Plant which holds water all year 
round and supports aquatic ecology and ecological habitat which is to be removed. 
The embedded mitigation provides for a permanent attenuation pond for the 
Project, which will be sited close to this location, including suitable habitat insofar 
as this does not compromise the storage volume. Consequently, no significant 
permanent loss of habitat is, therefore, envisaged with these mitigation measures 
implemented. 
9.8.5 
The Project will incorporate appropriate SuDS and proprietary products as part of 
both its embedded and additional mitigation to provide adequate water treatment 
before discharging from the Project Site to any nearby ordinary (i.e. tributaries to 
Abergelli 2018 ES – CHAPTER 9: WATER QUALITY AND FLOOD RISK 
 
 
Prepared for:  Abergelli Power Limited  
AECOM 
 
9-48 
 
WFD designated) water bodies or main (WFD designated) water bodies in 
accordance with current guidance. It is predicted that even with these mitigation 
measures in place, slight changes in the water quality of the receiving water bodies 
may occur. However, due to dispersion and dilution, changes that will cause a fall in 
one class of any relevant element of the WFD water quality elements is unlikely. 
Consequently, while the Project may create a slight change in the water quality of 
WFD surface and groundwater bodies nearby, this will not threaten the current 
status of the water bodies and therefore does not pose a risk to achieving the 
objectives of the WFD. 
9.8.6 
Risks during construction will be temporary and will not cause any long term effects 
beyond the construction phase. The construction works will therefore not pose a 
risk to achieving the objectives of the WFD. 
9.9 
Mitigation and Monitoring 
9.9.1 
As a general rule, additional mitigation measures are proposed where a significant 
effect is predicted to occur.  Embedded mitigation measures, which have been 
incorporated within the design of the Project or are standard practice measures that 
have been committed to are summarised in the Outline CEMP in Appendix 3.1 and 
the Landscape and Ecology Mitigation Plan in Appendix 3.3. 
9.9.2 
It is considered that no additional mitigation is required, to supplement the identified 
embedded mitigation effects.  The implemented embedded mitigation should result 
in minor or less significant risks from the operation of the Project. 
9.9.3 
No monitoring is proposed to supplement and verify the embedded mitigation 
proposed, which will be delivered via the Outline CEMP (Appendix 3.1). 
9.10 
Residual Effects 
9.10.1 The following tables present a summary of the Water Quality and Resources and 
Flooding assessment.  They identify the receptors likely to be impacted, the level of 
effect and, where the effect is deemed to be significant, the tables include the 
mitigation proposed and the resulting residual effect.

a) Project “in combination” Effects 
9.10.2 From the perspective of both water quality and flood risk, there are no significant 
effects likely to arise from any elements of the Project during the different phases of 
the Project Life. Therefore, overall, it has been considered that there is no 
significant effect predicted for the Project.

Cumulative Effects

Potential

Effects 
– 
Construction 
and 
Decommissioning 
9.11.1 It has been demonstrated that the likely effects of the Project are at worse 
Negligible/Minor and there are no likely significant effects on Water Quality and 
Resources and Flooding.  
9.11.2 Given that the effects of the Project are Negligible/Minor, this will not have any 
likely additive effects to any other projects of those listed in Table 4-6 or those 
within the ZoI of the Project Site during construction or decommissioning and 
therefore no significant cumulative effects are predicted. 
b) Assessment of Potential Cumulative Effects – Operation 
9.11.3 It has been demonstrated that the likely effects of the Project are at worse 
Negligible/Minor and there are no likely significant effects on Water Quality and 
Resources and Flooding.  
9.11.4 Given that the effects of the Project are Negligible/Minor, this will not have any 
likely additive effects to any other projects of those listed in Table 4-6 or those 
within the zone of influence of the Project Site during operation and therefore no 
significant cumulative effects are predicted.

Geology, Ground Conditions and Hydrogeology
10.1
Introduction
10.1.1 This chapter provides an assessment of the geology and ground condition effects
arising from construction, operation and decommissioning of the Project.
Maintenance is included within the operational assessment of the Project.
10.1.2 A detailed description of the Project Site and the Project is provided in Chapter 3:
Project and Site Description.  A glossary of terms and list of abbreviations used in
this chapter is provided in Document Reference 1.4.
10.1.3 This chapter also provides details of the geological conditions and the presence of
potentially contaminated land and hazardous materials. The effects of the Project
on the ground conditions and of constraints posed by the existing ground
conditions on the Project are considered for the construction, operational and
decommissioning phases of the Project. Where appropriate, mitigation measures
are presented to minimise the effects of actual or predicted adverse effects.
10.1.4 Data used within this chapter includes that presented within the Preliminary Geo-
environmental Risk Assessment (Appendix. 10.1).
a)
Objectives of the assessment
10.1.5 The objectives of the assessment were to describe:
·
The legislation, policy and guidance which have been taken into account in the
assessment;
·
The assessment methodology, including the consultation outcomes which have
informed the assessment;
·
Baseline conditions currently existing at the Project Site and in the surrounding
study area;
·
The likely significant effects of the Project (including the embedded mitigation
and 
avoidance 
measures) 
during 
the 
construction, 
operation 
and
decommissioning phases;
·
The additional mitigation required to prevent, reduce or offset any significant
adverse effects; and,
·
The likely residual effects and cumulative effects after these measures have
been employed.
10.2
Changes since the 2014 PEIR
10.2.1 There have been changes to the design as a result of design evolution and
consultation as detailed in Chapter 3: Project and Site Description. To aid the
reader, Table 10-1 outlines the changes to this assessment compared with the
2014 PEIR.

Legislation, policy and guidance
10.3.1 Legislation and policy has been considered on an international, national, regional
and local level. The following is considered to be relevant to the geology, ground
conditions and hydrogeology effects assessment as it has influenced the sensitivity
of receptors and requirements for mitigation or the scope and/or methodology of
the EIA.
a)
International and EU
·
Directive 2010/75/EU on 24th November 2010 on industrial emissions
(integrated pollution prevention and control), the Industrial Emissions Directive
(IED) (Ref. 10.2).  The IED is implemented in Wales by the Environmental
Permitting (England and Wales) Regulations 2016;
·
Water Framework Directive (WFD) 2000/60/EC aims to ensure that all surface
water and groundwater reaches ‘good’ status (in terms of ecological and
chemical quality and water quantity as appropriate), promotes sustainable
water use, reduce pollution and contribute to the mitigation of flood and
droughts (Ref. 10.3).  The WFD is implemented in Wales by the Water
Environment (Water Framework Directive) (England and Wales) Regulations
2017;
·
Groundwater Directive 2006/118/EC aims to set groundwater quality standards
and introduce measures to prevent or limit pollutants entering groundwater,
including those listed within the ‘List of Priority substances’ (Ref. 10.4); and
·
Seventh Environmental Action Programme came into force on 17th January
2014 to ensure land is managed more sustainably in the European Union (EU),
that soil is adequately protected and that the remediation of contaminated sites
is well underway (Ref. 10.5). It also commits the EU and its Member States to
increasing efforts to reduce soil erosion, increase soil organic matter and to
remediate contaminated sites.

National Legislation
i.
Environmental Protection Act
10.3.2 The contaminated land regime in Part 2A of the Environment Protection Act (EPA)
1990 (Ref. 10.9) was introduced to specifically address the historical legacy of land
contamination.  Part 2A of the Environmental Protection Act 1990 has introduced
the following statutory definition for "contaminated land":
"any land which appears to the local authority in whose area it is situated to be in
such a condition by reason of substances in, on, or under the land, that:
Significant harm is being caused or there is significant possibility of such harm
being caused; or
Significant pollution of controlled waters is being caused, or there is a significant
possibility of such pollution being caused."
10.3.3 Part 2A provides a means of dealing with unacceptable risks posed by land
contamination to human health and the environment.  Enforcing authorities are
required to identify and deal with such land but Part 2A is only to be used by the
Enforcing Authority where no appropriate alternative solution exists.
10.3.4 The term 'contaminant linkage' indicates that all three elements (i.e. contaminant /
pathway / receptor) have been identified.  The land can only be determined as
Contaminated Land if there is a contaminant linkage and the contamination meets
the criteria, outlined above.
c)
National Policy
ii.
Overarching National Policy Statement for Energy (NPS EN-1)
10.3.5 The relevant assessment principles in terms of generic impacts ('Biodiversity and
Geological Conservation' and 'Land Use including Open Space, Green
Infrastructure and Green Belt' and 'Waste Management') from Part 5 of NPS EN-1
(Generic Impacts) are set out below (Ref. 10.6).
10.3.6 Paragraphs 5.10.8 to 5.10.9 of NPS EN1 state "Applicants should seek to minimise
impacts on the best and most versatile agricultural land (defined as Grades 1, 2
and 3a of the Agricultural Land Classification) and preferably use land in areas of
poorer quality (Grades 3b, 4 and 5) except where this would be inconsistent with
other sustainability considerations. Applicants should also identify any effects and
seek to minimise impacts on soil quality taking into account any mitigation
measures proposed. For developments on previously developed land, applicants
should ensure that they have considered the risk posed by land contamination.
10.3.7 Applicants should safeguard any mineral resources on the proposed site as far as
possible, taking into account the long-term potential of the land use after any future
decommissioning has taken place".

iii.
National Policy Statement for Gas Supply Infrastructure and Gas and Oil
Pipelines (NPS EN-4)
10.3.8 Sections 2.20 - 2.23 of NPS EN-4 (Ref. 10.7) set out additional policy for assessing
the potential impacts of gas and oil pipelines, relating to: noise and vibration;
biodiversity, landscape and visual; water quality and resources; and soil and
geology.
10.3.9 Paragraph 2.23.1 of EN-4 states that, ‘it will be important for applicants to
understand the soil types and the nature of the underlying strata.’
Accordingly,
applicants should consult with the relevant statutory consultees at an early stage
regarding the potential impact of gas pipelines on soil and geology (paragraph
2.23.4). Paragraph 2.23.2 states that applicants should assess the stability of the
ground conditions associated with the pipeline route, including considering the
options for installing the pipeline.
iv.
National Policy Statement for Electricity Networks Infrastructure (NPS EN-5)
10.3.10 NPS EN-5 (Ref. 10.8) includes limited information regarding impacts on geology,
although Paragraph 2.8.9 recognises that an underground line is likely to have
more potential impacts on geology and soils than an overhead line.
v.
Environment Agency Guidance
10.3.11 In April 2013, National Resources Wales (NRW) was formed from a merger of
Environment Agency Wales, the Countryside Council for Wales and the Forestry
Commission Wales and undertakes the environmental regulatory duties in Wales.
However Environmental Agency guidance documents continue to be used as
representing “best practice” in the field of land contamination.
10.3.12 The Environment Agency’s Model Procedures for the Management of Land
Contamination (also known as Contaminated Land Report 11 (CLR11)) (Ref.
10.10), form the core reference guidance across the range of land contamination-
related regulatory regimes in the UK and are integral to most projects dealing with
land contamination. The report provides a road map/ flowcharts for structured
decision making required for the management of land affected by contamination.
CLR11 consolidates the general approach for the assessment of land
contamination that was introduced with the CLR in 2000. CLR11 is based on a
phased, risk-based approach using the ‘source/ contaminant – pathway – receptor’
concept as the key part of a Conceptual Site Model (CSM). A contaminant linkage
is said to exist when all three components of the model can be identified on a site.
A contaminant is a substance which is in, on or under the land and which has the
potential to cause harm or to cause pollution of the water environment. A receptor is
either a living organism, a group of living organisms, an ecological system or a
piece of property which is being, or could be, harmed, by a contaminant; or a water
environment which is being, or could be, polluted by a contaminant. A pathway is
one or more routes or means by, or through, which a receptor is being exposed to,
or affected by, a contaminant, or could be so exposed or affected.
10.3.13 The Environment Agency’s Guiding Principles for Land Contamination (GPLC)
(Ref. 10.11), provide a simplified overview of the approach laid out in CLR11 for

site/ problem holders and their professional advisors/ consultants. The aim of the
GPLC is to clarify roles and responsibilities, encourage good practice and comply
with or avoid the need for regulation and to provide a link to relevant advice in other
guidance documents.
10.3.14 NRW have adopted the Environment Agency’s approach to protecting groundwater.
The Environment Agency’s approach to groundwater protection document (Ref
10.12) details position statements that
describe the
Environment Agency’s
approach to managing and protecting groundwater. The position statements set a
framework which assist the Environment Agency is making decisions on
groundwater management, including a position statement on mining induced
pollution
10.3.15 The following CIRIA Guidance documents are relevant:
·
Control of water pollution from construction sites (C532) (Ref. 10.13);
·
The SuDS (Sustainable Urban Drainage Systems) manual 2015 (C753) (Ref.
10.14), and the SuDS manual 2007 (C697) (Ref. 10.15);
·
Environmental good practice on site guide (C741) (Ref. 10.16);
·
Assessing risks posed by hazardous ground gases to buildings (C665) (Ref.
10.17); and
·
Contaminated land risk assessment - a guide to good practice (C552) (Ref.
10.18).
vi.
Planning Policy Wales
10.3.16 Section 4.10 of PPW (Ref. 10.19) discusses the requirement for conserving the
best, most versatile agricultural land, as a finite resource for the future. "Land of
grades 1, 2, and 3a should only be developed if there is an overriding need for the
development, and either previously developed land or land in lower agricultural
grades is unavailable, or available lower grade land has an environmental value
recognised by a landscape, wildlife, historic or archaeological designation which
outweighs the agricultural considerations."
10.3.17 Section 13.5, discusses dealing with unstable and contaminated land, and how "the
planning system should guide development to lessen the risk from natural or
human made hazards, including risk from land instability and land contamination."
10.3.18 Section 13.7 discusses development management and contaminated
land,
outlining what planning decisions need to take into account, "evidence of a detailed
investigation and risk assessment prior to the determination of the application to
enable beneficial use of the land."
10.3.19 Section 13.9 outlines development management policies for unstable land.
"Planning decisions need to take into account the potential hazard that instability
could create, and the results of a specialist investigation and assessment to
determine the stability of the ground."

Local
10.3.21 The Project Site is located on land identified as 'Coal' resource, as illustrated on the
City and County of Swansea (CCS) Unitary Development Plan (UDP) Proposals
Map, where UDP Policy R2 applies (Ref. 10.21). Policy R2 states that development
proposals that would affect the working of known potential resources will have to be
accompanied by a full assessment of the potential resource and the impact of the
proposal in terms of sterilising the resource.
10.3.22 An area of the Gas Connection within the Project Site is located on land identified
as 'Sand and Aggregates' resource, as illustrated on the UDP Proposals Map,
where UDP Policy R4 applies. Policy R4 states that development proposals that
would affect the working of known potential mineral resources will have to be
accompanied by a full assessment of the potential mineral resource and the impact
of the proposal in terms of sterilising the resource. These areas are shown on
Figure 10-1.
10.3.23 Policy 1 of the UDP states that the County's environment will be protected from
materially harmful development and where possible enhanced. Development that
would result in adverse environmental effects will not be permitted, particularly in
respect of:
·
Air, noise or light pollution;
·
Flood risk;
·
The quality and quantity of water resources;
·
Land contamination; and
·
Land instability or subsidence.
10.3.24 CCS also has a Deposit Local Development Plan (LDP) which is supported by
evidence presented in a number of Topic Papers. The Topic Paper which supports
minerals (Ref. 10.22) indicates that the Welsh Government commissioned the
British Geological Survey (BGS) to prepare Mineral Resource Maps for Wales (Ref.
10.23). This map indicates that the Project Site is located on secondary shallow
coal resources overlain by glacigenic superficial deposits and peat.

Methodology
a)
Scope of the assessment
10.4.1 The scope of this assessment has been determined through a formal EIA scoping
process undertaken with the Secretary of State (SoS). Comments raised on the
Scoping Report (Appendix 4.1) have been taken into account in the development of
the assessment methodology and these are detailed where relevant in this chapter.

Recommendation that information on the location and extent of peat
is provided upfront as part of the DCO submission. A peat survey
should comply of a minimum of 1 peat probe per hectare of
development area, and 1 peat core per 10 peat probes. This will
show the distribution of peat across the development area so that the
main areas of deep peat can be avoided by infrastructure, and
therefore inform the subsequent PMP.
An additional desk study of peat
resources 
including 
NATMAP
Soilscapes 
dataset 
(Cranfield
University) and soil maps has been
undertaken 
in 
order 
to 
better
understand the location and spatial
extent of the peat deposits.
The desk study did not reveal any
more detail than what was presented
in the 2018 PEIR.
A peat survey will therefore be
undertaken post-consent as part of
the overall site investigation and in
line with these recommendations. If
peat is discovered to a significant
depth, a Peat Management Plan will
be produced (if required) and agreed
with CCS and NRW.

Study area
10.4.4 An approximate 1 km search buffer has been used from the Project Site for
purposes of relevant environmental data searches and a historical mapping review.
This study area has been chosen for the assessment based on professional
judgement as it is considered to incorporate all potential receptors that could be
impacted by geology, ground conditions and hydrogeology relating to the Project
(i.e. sensitive environments, surface water and groundwater resources, etc.) and
activities that may impact on the Project (i.e. historical development in the
surrounding area, potentially contaminative permitted activities, waste operations,
etc.).
d)
Sensitivity
10.4.5 The criteria used to assess the sensitivity of contaminated land receptors are
presented in Table 10-43. This table is specifically for assessing the sensitivity of
geology, ground conditions and hydrogeology receptors and complements the

Baseline Environment
10.5.1 This section describes the baseline environmental characteristics for the Project
Site and surrounding areas with specific reference to geology, ground conditions
and hydrogeology.
10.5.2 This assessment has been undertaken using desk based information currently
available including the Landmark Envirocheck Report (dated October 2017 and
presented in Appendix
10.2)
and
the Preliminary Geo-Environmental Risk
Assessment for Abergelli Power Project (Appendix 10.1), and a site walkover
undertaken in July 2014.

AECOM
11-16
10.5.3 The ground conditions have not yet been assessed via an intrusive ground
investigation. The results of the site investigation works must be reported to
CCS/NRW as secured by the DCO Requirements.
a)
Current and Surrounding Land-use
10.5.4 The land-use is predominantly agricultural, used for sheep and horse grazing
bounded by drainage ditches, fencing and hedgerows. There are no residential
buildings within the Project Site.
10.5.5 A detailed description is presented in Chapter 3: Project and Site Description,
Section 3.3.
b)
Geological information
10.5.6 The baseline geology, ground conditions and hydrogeology data of the Project Site
has been gathered from the following sources:
·
Landmark Information Group Envirocheck Report. Presented in  Appendix 10.2;
·
British Geological Survey (BGS) Borehole Log SN65200160 Aber-gelli-fach
Farm - Dated 7 October 1991. Presented in Appendix 10.3;
·
Preliminary Geo-Environmental Risk Assessment from Abergelli Power Project
(Ref. 10.1); and
·
BGS.  Digital Geological map of Great Britain at 1:50,000 scale (Ref. 10.25).
i.
Made Ground
10.5.7 There is no Made Ground indicated within the Project Site, based on published
BGS records. Made Ground is only considered to be likely to be present an areas
associated with previous development such as the landfill and colliery. It may also
be present if the landowner undertook land levelling. If any Made Ground is present
within the Project Site, its composition and provenance would be unknown.
ii.
Superficial Geology
10.5.8 There are four types of superficial deposits identified across the Project Site
comprising: glacial diamicton till, glaciofluvial deposits of sand and gravel, alluvium
deposits of clay, silt, sand and gravel and quaternary peat.
10.5.9 The glaciofluvial deposits are located along the Access Road, and areas to the
north of the Laydown Area, while till is present on the Access Road, across the
Laydown Site, in the western portion of the Generating Equipment Site and the
mid-section of the Gas Connection. Alluvium deposits are located across the
Ecological Mitigation Site and along the eastern boundary of the Generating
Equipment Site while peat is present in the north east of the Generating Equipment
Site and to the north west of Abergelli Farm.
10.5.10 The BGS indicates that there are three boreholes located in the Project Site,
however only one is available to view online and presented in Appendix 10.3.  The
borehole log is located east of Abergelli Farm in an area mapped as being
underlain by Devensian glaciofluvial deposits of sand and gravel.
Abergelli ES 2018 – CHAPTER 10: GEOLOGY, GROUND CONDITIONS AND HYDROGEOLOGY
Prepared for: Abergelli Power Limited
AECOM
11-17
10.5.11 The borehole log indicates superficial deposits comprising yellow brown sandy
gravelly clay down to 6.4 metres below ground level (mbgl), overlying grey brown
clayey gravelly sand, clayey sand and sandy clay down to 15.8 mbgl considered to
be representative of glaciofluvial deposits. These are underlain by firm yellow clay
becoming stiff grey gravelly clay described in the log as possible boulder clay which
is likely to be glacial till; proven to a maximum depth of 16.8 mbgl. Traces of coal
were identified at 10.7 mbgl within the clayey sand.
iii.
Bedrock Geology
10.5.12 The bedrock geology underlying the Project Site consists of the Grovesend
Formation of the South Wales Upper Coal Measures Formation, comprising
argillaceous mudstones and siltstones, with well-developed coals, and minor lithic
sandstones. The BGS (Ref. 10.26) indicates that the Grovesend Formation is the
youngest unit found in the South Wales coalfield.
10.5.13 The north eastern corner of the 1 km search buffer surrounding the Project Site is
underlain by the Swansea Member, comprising green-grey Pennant Sandstone,
with thin mudstone/siltstone and seatearth interbeds and (mainly thin) coals. This
geological formation is overlain conformably by the Grovesend Formation.
10.5.14 The geological map (Appendix 10.2) indicates the presence of one fault crossing
the Project Site running north west to south east through the Access Road. There
are numerous other faults identified within the 1 m search buffer around the Project
Site predominantly running from north-west to south east.
10.5.15 The Preliminary Geo-Environmental Risk Assessment (Ref.10.1) indicates that
there was a ‘Slant’ (inclined shaft or level) identified at Abergelli Colliery, which
provided access to both the Graigola and Swansea Four Feet coal seams.
c)
Soils and Agriculture
10.5.16 The soil and agriculture land classifications are discussed in the Preliminary Geo-
Environmental Risk Assessment (Ref. 10.1) and confirmed by NATMAP Soilscapes
indicate the following:
·
There are two different soil classification areas across the Project Site. The
predominant soil classification is described as “slowly permeable, wet, very
acidic upland soils with a peaty surface”. The soils are described as “low
fertility” and land cover is described as “moorland rough grazing and forestry”.
The precipitation “drains to the stream network”. Overgrazing of this soil could
lead to accelerated run-off and soil erosion.
·
Through the centre and north eastern section of the Project Site, the soils are
described as “freely draining, slightly acid loamy soils”. The soils are of “low
fertility”, with “arable and grassland” land cover and precipitation “drains to local
groundwater and rivers”. There is potential for groundwater contamination with
these soils, comprising nitrate, siltation and nutrient enrichment of streams from
soil erosion.
·
The agricultural land classification for the land within and surrounding the
Project Site is Grade 4 (“poor quality agricultural land”) “with severe limitations
Abergelli ES 2018 – CHAPTER 10: GEOLOGY, GROUND CONDITIONS AND HYDROGEOLOGY
Prepared for: Abergelli Power Limited
AECOM
11-18
which significantly restricts the range of crops and/or level of yields, mainly
suited to grass with occasional arable crops”.
·
The Project Site is known to be utilised as improved grazing for sheep and
horses, with small areas of marshy grassland and woodland copses
interspersing the improved grassland to the north and east.
d)
Ground Workings and Mineral Resources
10.5.17 The Envirocheck (Appendix 10.2) does not indicate the presence of any historical
ground workings on the Project Site, however within the 1 km search buffer there
are ten records of historical ground working features. These have all ceased
production and are listed in Table 10-7. These comprise nine opencast mines
producing sandstones and sands and gravel and one underground mine producing
coal.

10.5.18 The Coal Authority Mining Report (Appendix 10.4) identified Abergelli Colliery
located adjacent to the Project Site approximately 500 m north of Abergelli Farm. A
coal pit, shaft, colliery, and mine spoil heap have all been identified on historical
mapping at locations extending to between 480 m and 1 km from the Project Site
Boundary (i.e. outside the boundaries of the Project Site).
Abergelli ES 2018 – CHAPTER 10: GEOLOGY, GROUND CONDITIONS AND HYDROGEOLOGY
Prepared for: Abergelli Power Limited
AECOM
11-19
10.5.19 The Coal Authority Mining Report (dated 30 July 2014) indicated that the Project
Site is in the “likely zone of influence from workings in three seams of coal, at
shallow to a depth of 380 m”. Figure 10.2 presents the mine workings from the
mine abandonment plan across the Project Site. This plan shows that the entire
Project Site is influenced by mine workings.
10.5.20 As illustrated in Figure 10.2, there is one mine and one shaft entry located within or
close to the Project Site. The mine entry is located outwith the Project Site
Boundary, in the vicinity of Abergelli Colliery (north of Abergelli Farm). The mine
shaft is located south of the Substation at (NGR 264970, 200800) within the Project
Site Boundary. There is no record of any treatment to the mine/shaft entries. These
mine/shaft entries are shown on Figure 10.3. A site visit undertaken on the 12th
March 2018 has confirmed that the shaft has been back filled and no open void
was visible.
10.5.21 The Coal Authority indicates that reserves of coal exist and could be worked in the
future. However, the Project Site is currently not in an area for which the Coal
Authority is determining to grant a licence to remove coal using underground
methods, where a licence has been granted or in an area that is likely to be
affected at the surface from any planned future underground workings.
10.5.22 The Coal Authority report states that the Project Site is not within the boundary of
an opencast site from which coal has been removed by opencast methods, and
does not lie within 200 m of a boundary of an opencast site. It also states that the
Project Site is not within 800 m of the boundary of an opencast site for which the
Coal Authority are determining whether to grant a licence to remove coal by
opencast methods, or for which a licence to remove coal has been granted.
e)
Ground Stability/Subsidence
10.5.23 The Coal Authority Mining Report indicates that no notice of the risk of the land
being affected by subsidence has been given under Section 46 of the Coal Mining
Subsidence Act 1991.
10.5.24 Abergelli Farm has been subject to remedial works, by or on behalf of the Coal
Authority under its emergency surface hazard call out procedures. No further
information was provided, however two damage notices or claims for alleged
subsidence damage were made in June 1995 and November 1996 both of which
were rejected.
10.5.25 Geological hazards across the Project Site have been identified in the Landmark
Envirocheck Report; these are detailed in Table 10-8.

10.5.26 The high compressible ground hazard is assumed to be associated with the peat
located in the north east of the Generating Equipment Site and to the north west of
Abergelli Farm. The presence of peat and nature of its compressibility will be
determined during the post consent ground investigation.
10.5.27 Consideration of this hazard will be made in the design of any ground works
(including ground investigation, earthworks, de-watering) and foundation design.
There is an impact associated with any measure selected to mitigate the risk of
settlement of compressible peat deposits (if present). The final design will
incorporate suitable mitigation on the basis of the ground investigation findings to
minimise the interaction of the Project with the peat / disturbance of the peat as a
result of the Project. In the event that there will be some disturbance of peat, part of
the embedded mitigation is to undertake a peat survey, including probing of the
peat to determine the thickness and extent of the deposits, and the production of a
Peat Management Plan, which will detail how to handle the peat properly and
maximise on-site reuse of any excavated peat The peat survey methodology and
Peat Management Plan (if a reasonable amount of peat is found) will be prepared
in consultation with and approved by CCS and NRW prior to construction. Both the
methodology and the management plan will be secured via a DCO Requirement.
f)
Hydrogeology
10.5.28 The superficial glaciofluvial deposits and the bedrock geology are both classified as
Secondary A Aquifers.  Secondary A Aquifers are defined as ‘permeable layers
capable of supporting water supplies at a local rather than strategic scale, and in
some cases forming an important source of base flow to rivers.’
10.5.29 The superficial glacial till deposits are classed as Unproductive Strata, defined as
‘rock layers or drift deposits with low permeability that have negligible significance
for water supply or river base flow’.
10.5.30 The Landmark Envirocheck report has identified no groundwater abstraction
licences associated with the Project Site. There is only one licence located within
100 m of the Project Site, recorded 56 m to the north-east for a well at Abergelli
Farm, licence number 22/59/4/0027 dated February 1993, for general farming and
domestic use. There are a further seven licensed groundwater abstractions within 1
km of the site all for general farming and domestic use and a further 21 within 2 km
of the Project Site. Swansea Council has also identified a number of private water
supplies located in close proximity to the Project Site. Further detail relating to
Abergelli ES 2018 – CHAPTER 10: GEOLOGY, GROUND CONDITIONS AND HYDROGEOLOGY
Prepared for: Abergelli Power Limited
AECOM
11-21
water abstractions including the potential presence of unlicensed private water
supplies is included in Chapter 9: Water Quality and Resources.
10.5.31 The Project Site does not lie within a groundwater Source Protection Zone (SPZ).
10.5.32 The Landmark Envirocheck identifies the groundwater vulnerability classification of
the soils beneath the Project Site and surrounding area. These vary between Low
(L) to High (H) Leaching Potentials (classifications of L, H1, H3, I1 and U).  These
classifications are described as follows:
·
L: Soils in which pollutants are unlikely to penetrate the soil layer because
water movement is largely horizontal or they have large ability to attenuate
diffuse pollutants. Lateral flow from these soils contributes to groundwater
recharge elsewhere in the catchment.
·
H1: Soils which readily transmit liquid discharges because they are either
shallow or susceptible to rapid by-pass flow directly to rock, gravel or
groundwater.
·
H3: Coarse textured or moderately shallow soils which readily transmit non-
absorbed pollutants and liquid discharges but which have some ability to
attenuate absorbed pollutants because of their large clay or organic matter
contents.
·
I1: Soils which can possibly transmit a wide range of pollutants.
·
U: Soil information for restored mineral workings and urban areas is based on
fewer observations than elsewhere. A worst case vulnerability classification (H)
assumed, until proved otherwise.
10.5.33 The Envirocheck Report identifies areas prone to flooding associated by the Afon
Llan in the south of the Project Site in the Ecological Mitigation Area. NRW website
(Ref. 10.27) indicates a medium chance of flooding from rivers or the sea with a
chance of flooding of between 1 in 100 (1%) and 1 in 30 (3.3%).
10.5.34 The Envirocheck Report indicates the presence of two discharge consents to
groundwater on the Project Site, however these have both been surrendered.  Both
were held by the Felindre Gas Compressor Station, one for discharging sewage to
an unnamed land drain, effective between 2007 and 2010; and one for trade
discharges (site drainage) to the Afon Llan, effective from 2006 until it was
surrendered in 2011. There are a further three discharge consents within 250 m of
the Project Site, all of which have expired.
10.5.35 There have been no Pollution Incidents to Controlled Waters recorded on the
Project Site by the Envirocheck Report. There have been three between 250 m and
500 m of the Project Site, which were classed as Category 3 minor incidents and a
further eight incidents between 500 km and 1 km of the Project Site. These were
classed between Category 1 major incident and Category 3 minor incidents.
g)
Soil Chemistry
10.5.36 The Envirocheck Report has identified the estimated background soil chemistry (for
selected key elements) across the Project Site. They are summarised as:

h)
Groundwater Quality
10.5.37 Groundwater quality in the study area has been assessed against the objectives of
the Water Framework Directive (WFD). Details are presented in Chapter 9: Water
Quality and Resources.
i)
Landfill
10.5.38 The Envirocheck Report indicates that there are no landfill sites located within the
Project Site Boundary.
10.5.39 The closest landfill sites to the Project Site is one registered landfill and an adjacent
historic “Landfill Extension” located at Abergelli Fach Farm located between 92 m
and 121 m north east of the Project Site.
The current status of the registered
landfill is ‘closed’ and it was only able to accept non-biodegradable wastes. The
total void space was calculated at 75,000 m3 with a total tonnage of 142,500 t.
10.5.40 The Landfill Extension is reported to have accepted inert waste. The planning
application for this extension was granted in 1997. NRW provided the Working Plan
and associated drawings for the landfill which were dated March 1994. The total
void space was calculated at 99,898 m3, with a total tonnage of 179,816 t. The
Working Plan described the land as low lying, and poorly drained. Approximately
three quarters of the landfill area was covered by a mine soil dump from Abergelli
Colliery. This mine waste was removed leaving a layer of well compacted mine
waste over the majority of the landfill area. The area of ground that was covered by
the mine spoil was used for drying out of water treatment sludge (aluminium
sulphate) though ceased when the landfill became operational. No further
information on this operation is known.
10.5.41 Swansea City Waste Disposal Company Ltd gained planning permission for
‘excavation and removal of inert material from landfill site and restoration’ at
Abergelli Farm in February 2003 (CCS Ref: 2002/0312). This consent was
subsequently amended, extending the permission to allow the excavation and
removal of inert material until 31st December 2010 (2007/0907). The site has now
been fully restored.
10.5.42 There are also an additional three historical landfills within 400 m of the Project
Site, all located between 294 m and 402 m south-east of the Project Site. The first
is located 294 m east of the Project Site at Gorswen Farm and accepted
unspecified waste between 1971 and 1972.  The second landfill was licenced to
British Steel and located 309 m south-east. It was active between 1980 and 1994
and received deposited waste included industrial and household waste. The third
landfill is located 402 m south-east and was active been 1955 and 1970 receiving
deposited waste included inert, industrial and special waste.

Sources of Contamination
10.5.47 It is considered that the most likely sources of contamination for the Project Site
are:
·
Contamination associated with the off-site historic landfill and landfill extension
including aluminium sulphate sludge; and
·
Contamination from agricultural land use.
o)
Preliminary Conceptual Site Model (CMS)
10.5.48 On the basis of the information summarised above, a preliminary CSM has been
developed for the Project Site. The CSM identifies potential contaminants,
receptors (both on and off-site) and exposure pathways that may be present. The
identification of such potential “pollutant linkages” is a key aspect of the evaluation
of potentially contaminated land. Potential “pollutant linkages” associated with the
Project Site are detailed within Table 10-11.
10.5.49 It should be noted that the identification of potential “pollutant linkages” does not
indicate that they are significant in any way or that the Project Site is unsuitable for
its current/proposed use. It does, however, act as a way of focusing future data
collection at the Project Site and identifying any key potential risks associated with
the Project Site.
10.5.50 The model is based on a desk study and a walkover undertaken in 2014 and will be
confirmed through intrusive investigation prior to detailed design and as per a DCO
Requirement.

Embedded Mitigation
10.6.1 As detailed in Chapter 3: The Project and Site Description, a number of
embedded mitigation measures have been identified through the iterative EIA
process and have been incorporated into the design and construction planning of
the Project.
10.6.2 As these mitigation measures have been embedded into the design, are legal
requirements or are standard practices that will be implemented, the assessment of
likely significant effects assumes that they are in place.
10.7
Assessment of Effects
10.7.1 This section presents the findings of the geology, ground conditions and
hydrogeology assessment for the construction phase, the operational phase and
decommissioning of the Project.
10.7.2 This section identifies any likely significant effects that are predicted to occur
following embedded mitigation measures and Section 10.8 highlights the additional
mitigation and monitoring measures that are proposed to reduce or eliminate the
identified significant effects.
a)
Construction
i.
Power Generation Plant
Geology and Soils: Sand and Gravel Reserves
10.7.3 The UDP Proposals Map indicates that sand and gravel reserves are present
underlying the Project Site. These areas are presented in Figure 10.1. The sand
and gravel reserves have historically been worked adjacent to the Project Site; the
location of the disused gravel pit is shown in Figure 10.3.
10.7.4 Should the ground investigation provide evidence that sand and gravel reserves
are available directly under the Power Generation Plant footprint, there will be a
permanent sterilisation of those potentially available reserves.
The sand and
gravels reserves are considered to be of low sensitivity due to minimal economic
use. The magnitude of the impact is assessed as low, as while there will be
permanent (for the duration of the Project) sterilisation of the reserves, a relatively
small area of the reserves will be affected compared to the full reserve extent
available for potential extraction.
The significance of the effects is therefore
considered to be Minor adverse which is not significant.
Geology and Soils: Coal Reserves
10.7.5 The UDP Proposals Map indicates that coal reserves are present underlying the
Project Site. These areas are presented in Figure 10.1. The coal reserves have
historically been worked underlying the Project Site; the location of the workings is
shown in Figure 10.2. Should the ground investigation provide evidence of further
commercially viable coal reserves under the footprint of the Power Generation Site,
there could be a permanent sterilisation of potentially available reserves.
Abergelli ES 2018 – CHAPTER 10: GEOLOGY, GROUND CONDITIONS AND HYDROGEOLOGY
Prepared for: Abergelli Power Limited
AECOM
11-33
10.7.6 The coal reserves are considered to be of low sensitivity due to minimal economic
use. The magnitude of the impact is assessed as low, as while there will be
permanent constraint on future extraction, a relatively small area of the coal
reserves will be affected compared to the full extent.  The significance of the effects
is therefore considered to be Minor adverse which is not significant in EIA terms.
Geology and Soils: Peat Deposits
10.7.7 There are areas of peat identified across the region with one deposit shown to be
located within or close to the Power Generation Plant. The peat deposits are
characterised as being of Low sensitivity due to their limited spatial extent (pockets
located north east of the Generating Equipment Site and to the north west of
Abergelli Farm).
10.7.8 The interaction of the Project with the peat is likely to be minimal. The volume of
peat affected will be determined through the completion of the peat survey and
ground investigation and therefore cannot be currently assessed as the thickness
of the unit is unknown but likely to variable. The area of mapped peat within the
Project Site is ~2.3 ha compared to the total area of the mapped deposit of ~7.4 ha
that extends beyond the Project Site Boundary. The magnitude of the impact is
therefore considered to be low and the significance of the effects is therefore Minor
which is not significant.
Agricultural Land
10.7.9 There will be a direct, permanent (for the duration of the Project) local loss of
approximately 3 ha of Grade 4 agricultural land in the area of the Generating
Equipment Site. Grade 4 land is defined as land with severe limitations which
significantly restrict the range of crops and / or level of yield and therefore the
sensitivity of this receptor is considered to be negligible. While there will be
sterilisation of the receptor under the Project structures, this is over a relatively
small area of the Project Site. Therefore the magnitude is assessed as negligible
and the significance of the effects also considered to be Negligible which is not
significant.
Structures
10.7.10 There is high potential for the ground beneath the structures to become unstable
from previous mining activities, ground workings, and compressible ground (in
particular the peat deposits where directly impacted). The sensitivity of the receptor
is considered to be high as these effects can lead to loss or damage to plant and
structures. A comprehensive ground investigation will be undertaken prior to
construction (as per a DCO Requirement) which will inform the foundation design
and any remediation required to be undertaken as standard and as required as part
of the embedded mitigation for the Project. Once the embedded mitigation has
been taken into account, the magnitude of effect is considered to be negligible. The
significance of the effects has therefore been assessed as Minor adverse which is
not significant.

Prepared for: Abergelli Power Limited
AECOM
11-34
Controlled Waters
10.7.11 Piling is anticipated to be the realistic worst case scenario required as part of the
construction works. There is potential for the quality of the groundwater present in
the Secondary A superficial and bedrock aquifers to be impacted by the piling
process producing additional pollutant migration
pathways for contaminated
shallow groundwater or surface waters to impact deeper aquifer groundwater. The
sensitivity of the groundwater is assessed as high due to the Secondary Aquifer
designation and the presence of water abstractions and private water supplies.
Once the embedded mitigation such as pollution control measures have been
taken into account, the magnitude of effect is considered to be negligible. The
significance of the effects has therefore been assessed as Minor adverse which is
not significant.
10.7.12 The depth to and extent of coal workings is currently unconfirmed and therefore it is
currently not assessed as to whether the proposed piles will intercept worked or
unworked coal measures or will be founded in strata not affected by the zone of
influence 
of 
mine 
workings. 
If 
grouting 
is 
required 
as 
part 
of
remediation/stabilisation of mine workings this could also have an impact upon
groundwater quality. However potential effects would be mitigated by the CEMP
and are likely to be short term in duration once the grout has set and no bleed
water is present to leach into the surrounding strata.
10.7.13 There is potential for the introduction of contaminated material to enter the ground
or controlled waters during the construction phase of the Power Generation Plant.
This may occur due to incorrect storage/transport/use of materials such as fuels,
oils and chemicals. The pollutants from the spill/leak could infiltrate into the ground,
contaminating soils and / or groundwater, or run off directly into surface water
bodies. The sensitivity of the groundwater is assessed as high due to the
Secondary Aquifer designation and the presence of water abstractions and private
water supplies.  The magnitude of this effect is however assessed as negligible
once embedded mitigation measures have been taken into account such as
pollution control measures. The significance of the effects considered to be Minor
adverse which is not significant.
Human Health: Construction Workers
10.7.14 The construction workers are considered to have high sensitivity as construction
groundworks will be required and as such the workforce may be in direct contact
with soil and groundwater. Contamination within soils (the presence of which is to
be confirmed during the ground investigation) has the potential to affect the health
of construction workers adversely. Any ground disturbance has the potential to
cause temporary, moderate adverse effect to health arising from oral, inhalation or
dermal contact with potential contaminants including potential sheep dips, use of
fertilisers, ground gas/landfill gas/mine gas or mine water during construction.
However once embedded mitigation measures detailed in the CEMP are taken into
account, the magnitude of this effect is assessed as negligible. The significance of
the effects considered to be Minor adverse which is not significant.

ii.
Gas Connection
10.7.15 The Gas Connection will be in the form of a new above ground installation (AGI)
and the Gas Pipeline, which will be approximately 1.4 km in length.
Geology and Soils: Sand and Gravel Reserves
10.7.16 Should ground investigation works demonstrate that there is sand and gravel
reserves at the depth of the Gas Connection works, there will be a permanent
sterilisation of potential sand and gravel reserves along the Gas Connection where
the pipe laying activities are expected to occur. The sand and gravels reserves are
considered to be of low sensitivity due to minimal economic use. The magnitude of
the impact is assessed as low, as while there will be permanent (for the duration of
the Project) sterilisation of the reserves, a relatively small area of the reserves will
be affected compared to the full extent.  The significance of the effects is therefore
considered to be Minor adverse which is not significant.
10.7.17 Sand and gravel reserves were not identified within the AGI area on the UDP
Proposals Map (shown in Figure 10.1).
Geology and Soils: Coal Reserves
10.7.18 The UDP Proposals Map indicates that coal reserves are present underlying the
Gas Connection (including AGI), shown in Figure 10.1. Should the ground
investigation works demonstrate that coal reserves will be directly affected by the
depth of the Gas Connection; there will be permanent sterilisation on future coal
extraction along the Gas Pipeline route. The coal reserves are considered to be of
low sensitivity due to minimal economic use. The magnitude of the impact is
assessed as low, as while there will be permanent constraint on future extraction, a
relatively small area of the coal reserves will be affected compared to the full
extent.  The significance of the effects is therefore considered to be Minor adverse
which is not significant.
10.7.19 Coal reserves were not identified within the AGI area on the UDP Proposals Map
(shown in Figure 10.1).
Agricultural Land
10.7.20 The construction phase associated with the Gas Connection will be a corridor with
a working width of 50 m to 200 m wide and result in a temporary sterilisation of
Grade 4 agricultural land during the construction period. Grade 4 land is defined as
land with severe limitations which significantly restrict the range of crops and / or
level of yield and therefore the sensitivity of this receptor is considered to be
negligible. While there will be sterilisation of the receptor over a relatively small
area of the Project Site and therefore the magnitude is assessed as negligible and
the significance of the effects also considered to be Negligible which is not
significant.
10.7.21 The Above Ground Installation (AGI) will be approximately 2,975 m2, and result in
the localised, permanent sterilisation of poor quality agricultural land. Grade 4 land
is defined as land with severe limitations which significantly restrict the range of
Abergelli ES 2018 – CHAPTER 10: GEOLOGY, GROUND CONDITIONS AND HYDROGEOLOGY

11-36
crops and / or level of yield and therefore the sensitivity of this receptor is
considered to be negligible. While there will be sterilisation of the receptor, it will
only be over a relatively small area of the Project Site and therefore the magnitude
is assessed as negligible and the significance of the effects also considered to be
Negligible which is not significant.
iii.
Electrical Connection
10.7.22 The Electrical Connection will involve short sections of open cut trench at either
end of the access road and the installation of cable ducts. The baseline conditions
and receptors are the same to that of the Power Generation Plant and Gas
Connection (described above). The Electrical Connection also coincides with the
Access Road for approximately 500 m which extends to the Substation.
Geology and Soils: Sand and Gravel Reserves
10.7.23 The Electrical Connection will be routed adjacent to the Felindre Gas Compressor
Station and the Substation, and adjacent to the Access Road. Therefore the land is
already sterilised in this area. The sand and gravels reserves are considered to be
of low sensitivity due to minimal economic use. The magnitude of the impact is
assessed as low, as while there will be permanent sterilisation of the reserves, a
relatively small area of the reserves will be affected compared to the full extent.
The significance of the effects is therefore considered to be Minor adverse which is
not significant.

10.7.24 The Electrical Connection will be routed adjacent to Felindre Gas Compressor
Station and the Substation and adjacent to the Access Road, where the land is
already sterilised in this area. The coal reserves are considered to be of low
sensitivity due to minimal economic use. The magnitude of the impact is assessed
as low, as while there will be permanent constraint on future extraction, a relatively
small area of the coal reserves will be affected compared to the full extent.  The
significance of the effects is therefore considered to be Minor adverse which is not
significant.
Agricultural Land
10.7.25 The construction works associated with the Electrical Connection will result in the
direct, local and permanent sterilisation of agricultural land. However, the route will
be result in the permanent loss of approximately 0.33 ha of agricultural land. As
above, the sensitivity of the agricultural land is considered to be negligible and the
magnitude also negligible due to the limited extent of the impact. The significance
of effect is therefore considered to be Negligible which is not significant.
iv.
Project
10.7.26 Overall, it is considered that the construction phase of the Project will have a
localised, minor adverse significance of effect on mineral resources (sand and
gravel reserves) but a negligible effect on peat deposits and agricultural land.
Effects on controlled waters, structures and human health have been assessed that

Operation and Maintenance
10.7.27 Potential impacts during the operational phase of the Project (including expected
maintenance activities) are detailed below.
i.
Power Generation Plant
Geology and Soil - Sand and Gravel, Coal and Peat Reserves and Agricultural
Land
10.7.28 The geology and soils are considered to be of low sensitivity and the magnitude of
the impact is therefore considered to be low, Operation and maintenance is
anticipated to have a Minor adverse significance of effect on the geology and soils
present on the Power Generation Plant as the potential impact would have
occurred during the construction phase which is not significant.
Structures
10.7.29 Previously unstable land will be directly stabilised during the construction works.
The sensitivity of the structures is assessed high as the effect of unstable land can
lead to loss or damage to operational plant and structures. Once embedded
mitigation measures have been taken into account the magnitude of effect is
considered to be negligible. The significance of the effects has therefore been
assessed as Minor beneficial which is not significant.
10.7.30 There is potential for long term chemical attack on the foundations of the structures.
Chemical compounds such as sulphate and pH levels in natural ground or polluted
ground can cause damage to foundations and other sub surface structures. The
sensitivity of the structures is assessed as high as the receptor has low ability to
absorb change without fundamentally altering its character. Once embedded
mitigation measures are taken into account the magnitude of the effect is assessed
as negligible. The significance of the effect has been assessed as Minor adverse
which is not significant.
Land and/or Controlled Waters
10.7.31 There is potential for the accidental release of stored fuels and chemicals directly
affecting localised areas of the land or groundwater quality, during the operation
and maintenance phase of the Project. These pollution incidents may occur due to
incorrect storage / transport / use of materials such as fuels, oils and chemicals.
With containment in place, any accidents may result in the containment system
being affected and a greater risk of measures being defeated. The sensitivity of the
groundwater is assessed as high due to the Secondary Aquifer designation and the
presence of water abstractions and private water supplies.
Once the embedded
mitigation such as pollution control measures has been taken into account, the
magnitude of effect is considered to be negligible. The significance of the effects
has therefore been assessed as Minor adverse which is not significant.
Abergelli ES 2018 – CHAPTER 10: GEOLOGY, GROUND CONDITIONS AND HYDROGEOLOGY
Prepared for: Abergelli Power Limited
AECOM
11-42
Human Health: Site Workers
10.7.32 There are no potential human health pollutant linkages anticipated to remain during
the operational phase or during maintenance as it is assumed that the design of the
Project will embed suitable mitigation for the protection of human health. The
sensitivity of the site workers is assessed as high. However once embedded
mitigation measures detailed in the CEMP are taken into account it is considered to
have a negligible magnitude. The resulting Minor effect is considered to be not
significant in EIA terms.
ii.
Gas Connection
Geology and Soil - Sand and Gravel, Coal and Peat Reserves and Agricultural
Land
10.7.33 The geology and soils are considered to be of low sensitivity and the magnitude of
the impact is therefore considered to be low, Operation and maintenance is
anticipated to have a Minor adverse effect on the geology and soils present at the
Gas Connection
as the potential impact would have occurred during the
construction phase which is not significant.
Structures
10.7.34 There is potential for long term chemical attack on the Gas Pipeline during the
operational phase of the Project. Chemical compounds such as sulphate and pH
levels in natural ground or polluted ground can cause damage to sub surface
structures. The sensitivity of the structures is assessed as high as the receptor has
low ability to absorb change without fundamentally altering its character. Once the
embedded mitigation has been taken into account, the magnitude of effect is
considered to be negligible. The significance of the effects has therefore been
assessed as Minor adverse which is not significant.
Controlled Waters
10.7.35 Operation and maintenance of the Project is anticipated to have a Minor adverse
effect on the controlled waters as while the potential impact would have occurred
during the construction phase, the sensitivity of the receptor remains high although
the magnitude is considered to be negligible. This is not significant.
Human Health: Site Workers
10.7.36 During the operation and maintenance of the Project it is anticipated that, while the
sensitivity of the receptor is high, the magnitude is considered to be negligible as
the potential impact would have occurred during the construction phase.
The
significance of the effects has therefore been assessed as Minor adverse which is
not significant.

iii.
Electrical Connection
Geology and Soil - Sand and Gravel, Coal and Peat Reserves and Agricultural
Land
10.7.37 The geology and soils are considered to be of low sensitivity and the magnitude of
the impact is therefore considered to be low. Operation and maintenance is
anticipated to have a Minor adverse effect on the geology and soils present at the
Electrical Connection as the potential impact would have occurred during the
construction phase which is not significant.
Structures
10.7.38 There is potential for long term chemical attack on the underground cable ducts
during the operational phase of the Project. Chemical compounds such as sulphate
and pH levels in natural ground or polluted ground can cause damage to sub
surface structures. The sensitivity of the structures is assessed as high as the
receptor has low ability to absorb change without fundamentally altering its
character. Once the embedded mitigation has been taken into account, the
magnitude of effect is considered to be negligible. The significance of the effects
has therefore been assessed as Minor adverse which is not significant.
Controlled Waters
10.7.39 During the operation and maintenance of the Project it is anticipated that, while the
sensitivity of the receptor is high, the magnitude is considered to be negligible as
the potential impact would have occurred during the construction phase.
The
significance of the effects on controlled waters has therefore been assessed as
Minor adverse which is not significant.
Human Health: Site Workers
10.7.40 During the operation and maintenance of the Project it is anticipated that, while the
sensitivity of the receptor is high, the magnitude is considered to be negligible as
the potential impact would have occurred during the construction phase.
The
significance of the effects on human health has therefore been assessed as Minor
adverse which is not significant.
iv.
Project
10.7.41 Overall, it is considered that the operational phase and maintenance of the Project
will have a localised, Minor adverse significance of effect on mineral resources
(sand, gravel and reserves), peat deposits and agricultural land. Stability effects on
structures have been assessed as Minor beneficial and effects on controlled
waters, structures and human health have been assessed as Minor adverse
significance.

c)
Decommissioning
i.
Power Generation Plant
Geology and Soil
10.7.42 The Power Generation Plant will be returned to a pre-construction condition. The
potential mineral reserves underlying the Power Generation Plant that may have
been sterilised during the construction and operation phases of the Project may
become available again. The geology and soils are considered to be of low
sensitivity and the magnitude of the impact is therefore considered to be low, The
significance of the effect is therefore considered to be Minor adverse which is not
significant.
10.7.43 If mine workings are stabilised as part of the pre-construction works, the land will
be returned to a
better than baseline condition which will enable future
development. The coal reserves are considered to be of low sensitivity due to
minimal economic use however the magnitude of the impact is assessed as high,
as the baseline has fundamentally been changed. The significance of the effect is
therefore considered to be Moderate beneficial which is significant.
Agricultural Land
10.7.44 The Power Generation Plant will be returned to a pre-construction condition.
Therefore the land will become available for potential agricultural use once again.
The sensitivity of the agricultural land is considered negligible due to the low quality
nature of the land and the magnitude considered to be low due to the permanent
loss of surface soils. This is anticipated to result in a Negligible effect which is not
significant.
Controlled Waters
10.7.45 If piled foundations are used, these will likely be retained in the ground following
decommissioning of the Power Generation Plant as this would create less direct
disturbance to the groundwater regime and ground conditions. The sensitivity of the
groundwater is assessed as high due to the Secondary Aquifer designation and the
presence of water abstractions and private water supplies.  The magnitude of this
effect is however assessed as negligible as there will only be a minor shift from
baseline conditions. The significance of the effects considered to be Minor adverse
which is not significant.
10.7.46 There is potential for the accidental release of stored fuels and chemicals directly
affecting localised areas of the land or groundwater quality, during the
decommissioning of the Project. These pollution incidents may occur due to
incorrect storage / transport / use of materials such as fuels, oils and chemicals.
With containment in place, any accidents may result in the containment system
being affected and a greater risk of measures being defeated. The sensitivity of the
groundwater is assessed as high due to the Secondary Aquifer designation and the
presence of water abstractions and private water supplies.
Once the embedded
mitigation such as pollution control measures has been taken into account, the

magnitude of effect is considered to be negligible. The significance of the effects
has therefore been assessed as Minor adverse which is not significant.
Human Health: Demolition Workers
10.7.47 The demolition workers are considered to have high sensitivity as groundworks will
be required during demolition and as such the workforce may be in direct contact
with soil and groundwater. The construction phase of the project is likely to have
addressed any contamination issues within soils which would have the potential to
affect the health of demolition workers adversely and once embedded mitigation
measures detailed in the CEMP are taken into account it is considered to have a
Minor adverse effect which is considered to be not significant.
ii.
Gas Connection
10.7.48 The decommissioning works associated with the Gas Connection will include the
Gas Pipeline being capped and left in situ. The AGI will be removed and land will
be returned to a pre-construction condition.
Geology and Soil - Sand and Gravel, Coal and Peat Reserves
10.7.49 The Gas Pipeline is to be left in situ and a narrow strip of land and potentially any
easement permanently sterilised until it is removed for any future development. The
sand, gravel and coal reserves are considered to be of low sensitivity due to
minimal economic use. The magnitude of the impact is assessed as low, as while
there will be permanent constraint on future extraction, a relatively small area of the
mineral reserves will be affected compared to the full extent.  The significance of
the effects is therefore considered to be Minor adverse which is not significant.
10.7.50 The decommissioning of the AGI is anticipated to make potential mineral reserves
that may have been sterilised during the construction and operation phases of the
Project become available again. The sand, gravel and coal reserves are considered
to be of low sensitivity due to minimal economic use. The magnitude of the impact
is assessed as low, as the underlying composition of the mineral reserves will be
similar to the pre-development situation. The significance of the effect is therefore
considered to be Minor adverse which is not significant.
Agricultural Land
10.7.51 The Gas Connection will be left in situ and the narrow strip of land therefore
permanently sterilised until it is removed for any future development. The AGI land
area will be returned to a pre-construction condition. Therefore the land will become
available for agricultural use once again. The sensitivity of the agricultural land is
considered low, as while there will be permanent constraint on future agricultural
only a relatively small area will be affected and the land is considered to be low
quality in nature. The magnitude considered low due to the permanent loss of low
quality surface soils.  This is anticipated to result in a Minor adverse effect which is
not significant.

negligible magnitude of effect. The significance of the effects has therefore been
assessed as Minor adverse which is not significant.
iii.
Electrical Connection
Geology and Soil - Sand and Gravel, Coal and Peat Reserves
10.7.54 The decommissioning works will include the Electrical Connection being capped
and left in situ and the narrow strip of land and potentially an easement therefore
permanently sterilised until it is removed for any future development. The sand,
gravel and coal reserves are considered to be of low sensitivity due to minimal

is therefore considered to be Minor adverse which is not significant.
Agricultural Land
10.7.55 The Electrical Connection will be left in situ therefore the land will become available
for agricultural use once again. There is anticipated to be permanent sterilisation of
narrow strip of land directly over the cable and any potential easement. The
sensitivity of the agricultural land is considered negligible due to the low quality
nature of the land and the magnitude considered to be low due to the permanent
loss of low quality surface soils.  This is anticipated to result in a Negligible effect
which is not significant.

Additional Mitigation Measures
10.8.1 As a general rule, additional mitigation measures are proposed where a significant
effect is predicted to occur.
Embedded mitigation measures, which have been
incorporated within the design of the Project or are standard practice measures that
have been committed to are summarised in Chapter 3: Project and Site
Description and have been taken account of in the assessment described above.
These include the ground investigation which is expected to be undertaken post-
consent and as required by a DCO Requirement.
10.8.2 This assessment did not identify any significant effects to Geology Ground
Conditions and Hydrogeology receptors
during construction, operation and
decommissioning of the Project. No additional mitigation or monitoring is therefore
deemed necessary.
10.9
Residual Effects
10.9.1 There were no significant effects identified during the life cycle of the Power
Generation Plant, Gas Connection, Electrical Connection, or the Project. Therefore,
there are no residual effects identified and therefore no additional mitigation
measures were deemed necessary.
10.10 Cumulative Effects
10.10.1 It is considered that there is no potential for cumulative impacts on geology, ground
conditions and hydrogeology receptors as a result of construction, operation and
maintenance or decommissioning of the Project in combination with other schemes
for the following reasons:
·
Solar park developments such as Abergelli Solar Farm and Brynwhilach Solar
Park would not impact significantly on the geology and hydrogeology of the
Project Site as it is understood there would be limited excavation works for the
construction of those projects. The identified potential impacts on the geology
and hydrogeology of the Project would comprise accidental pollution incidents
during the construction phase. This would not have a cumulative effect with the
other projects.
·
Based on information available at this time, it is anticipated that the planning
applications for the sustainable urban village at Felindre, and Felindre Business
Park will not have an impact on geology and hydrogeology such that a
cumulative impact would occur alongside the Project’s impacts; and
·
The development of the Project or other planned developments within the area
are not anticipated to have any cumulative effects as they will not likely create a
larger contamination or ground instability impact than the individual projects
taken in isolation. In addition, none of the planned developments will remove
large amounts of good quality agricultural land or sites of important geology.

Landscape and Visual 
11.1 
Introduction 
11.1.1 This chapter provides an assessment of the likely significant Landscape and Visual 
effects arising from construction, operation and decommissioning of the Project as 
part of this ES.   
11.1.2 A detailed description of the Project Site and the Project is provided in Chapter 3: 
Project and Site Description.  A glossary of terms and list of abbreviations used in 
this chapter is provided in Document Reference 1.4. 
11.1.3 Landscape and visual effects are interrelated with other environmental effects but 
are assessed separately. Whilst elements of the landscape, such as Listed 
Buildings or ecologically designated areas, are important elements of the 
landscape and contribute to its character and influence its quality and value, 
assessment of the significance of effects on these features is considered in 
Chapter 8: Ecology, Chapter 13: Historic Environment and Chapter 14: Socio-
economics.  
11.1.4 This chapter is supported by the following technical appendices presented in: 
 Appendix 11.1: LANDMAP Aspect Data; 
 Appendix 11.2: Landscape Assessment; and 
 Appendix 11.3: Visual Assessment. 
a) Objectives of the assessment 
11.1.5 The LVIA considers how the Project may have an effect upon landscape character 
and visual amenity. It considers how: 
 Landscape effects associated with a development relate to change to the 
fabric, character and quality of the landscape resource and how it is 
experienced; and  
 Visual effects relate closely to landscape effects but also concern changes in 
views as visual assessment is also concerned with people’s perception and 
response to changes in visual amenity. 
11.2 
Changes since the 2014 PEIR  
11.2.1 There have been changes to the Project design as a result of design evolution and 
consultation as detailed in Chapter 3: Project and Site Description. To aid the 
reader, Table 11-1 outlines the changes to this assessment compared with the 
Landscape and Visual section of the 2014 PEIR and 2018 PEIR.

Changes since the 2014 PEIR 
Section Reference 
Methodology 
The 
detail 
contained 
in 
the 
methodology including the criteria 
for sensitivity, magnitude and 
significance varies between the 
2014 PEIR and the 2018 PEIR 
and ES, however both are in 
accordance with GLVIA3 and the 
differences 
reflect 
professional 
judgements on methodology.  
Viewpoint 10 has been replaced 
with Viewpoint 17 as the site visit 
in November 2017 revealed that 
foreground views now contain a 
solar farm and associated security 
fencing. 
The stack height has increased to 
45 m in the 2018 PEIR; however 
the study area for visual amenity 
has remained the same in both 
the PEIRs at 15 km. This has 
been agreed through consultation. 
Section 11.5, Methodology 
Baseline 
The baseline has changed since 
the 2014 PEIR, most notably with 
the construction of solar farms 
within the 5 km landscape study 
area. This was observed during 
the site visit in November 2017. 
Updated photography reflecting 
winter (March 2018) and summer 
(August/September 
2017) 
seasonal variations have also 
been captured.   
Section 11.6, Baseline  
Significance of 
Effect 
Effects are similar between the 
2014 PEIR, 2018 PEIR and this 
ES with the same conclusions 
drawn on overall significance.

Legislation, policy and guidance  
11.3.1 This section identifies and describes legislation, policy and guidance of relevance 
to the assessment of the potential landscape and visual impacts associated with 
the Project.

11.3.2 Legislation and policy has been considered on an international, national, regional 
and local level.  The following is considered to be relevant to the landscape and 
visual assessment as it has influenced the sensitivity of receptors and requirements 
for mitigation or the scope and/or methodology of the ES. 
a) International 
11.3.3 The European Landscape Convention (ELC) came into force on 1st March 2007 in 
the UK and is the first international convention to be exclusively devoted to all 
aspects of the landscape. Its purpose is to develop policies to the protection, 
management and planning of landscape and the integration into relevant policies, 
including cultural, heritage and economic policies. In 2008 the Council of Europe 
adopted guidelines for the implementation of the ELC. In delivering the outcomes of 
the ELC in the UK, a framework for Implementation in England has been drawn up 
(Integrating the European Landscape Convention: Part 1-3 Guidance (2009) 
(Ref.11.1)).  
b) National 
11.3.4 There are three NPSs that are relevant to the Project; the overarching NPS EN-1 
covering all nationally important energy infrastructure and the technology specific 
NPS EN-2 for Fossil Fuel Electricity Generating Infrastructure and NPS EN-4 for 
Gas Supply Infrastructure and Gas Oil Pipelines.   
 
Overarching National Policy Statement for Energy (NPS EN-1) 
i.
11.3.5 NPS EN-1 directs those deciding applications on what general policies and 
considerations they should assess with regards to an energy Nationally Significant 
Infrastructure Project (NSIP), such as the Project. Within, it recognises that NSIPs 
will have potential landscape and visual impacts, which is outlined in section 5.9 
and the therefore the Applicant should “…include the effects during construction of 
the project and the effects of the completed development and its operation on 
landscape components and landscape character. The assessment should include 
the visibility and conspicuousness of the project during construction and of the 
presence and operation of the project and potential impacts on views and visual 
amenity. This should include light pollution effects, including on local amenity, and 
nature conservation”.  
11.3.6 NPS EN-1 also recognises that the scale of development located outside the 
boundaries of national designated areas may have impacts as structures may be 
visible within such designated areas. It states that “the aim should be to avoid 
compromising the purposes of designation and such projects should be designed 
sensitively given the various siting, operational, and other relevant constraints. … 
The fact that a proposed project will be visible from within a designated area should 
not in itself be a reason for refusing consent.”

AECOM 
11-6 
 
11.3.7 In response to the potential landscape and visual impacts, NPS EN-1 has outlined 
guidance in terms of mitigation. It states “Within a defined site, adverse landscape 
and visual effects may be minimised through appropriate siting of infrastructure 
within that site, design including colours and materials, and landscaping schemes, 
depending on the size and type of the proposed project. Materials and designs of 
buildings should always be given consideration.” 
ii. National Policy Statement for Fossil Fuel Electricity Generating Infrastructure 
(NPS EN-2) 
11.3.8 The NPS EN-2 is to be read in conjunction with NPS EN-1, with EN-2 specifically 
covering gas fired infrastructure projects such as the Project. It recognises that 
applicants should demonstrate good design in respect to landscape and visual 
amenity set out in section 2.6 and detailed in EN-1. NPS EN-2 also requires the 
Applicant to have given considerations to the aesthetic design of a development, 
and siting of the development in the context of existing landscape, landform and 
vegetation.  
iii. National Policy Statement for Gas Supply Infrastructure and Gas and Oil 
Pipelines (NPS EN-4) 
11.3.9 The NPS EN-4 covers infrastructure involving underground gas pipelines, such as 
included in the Project. The potential landscape and visual impacts are outlined in 
section 2.14 of which it notes that pipeline construction can cause temporary 
landscape and visual impacts.  
 National Policy Statement for Electricity Networks Infrastructure (NPS EN-5) 
iv.
11.3.10 The NPS EN-5 covers infrastructure for electricity networks including transmission 
systems and the associated infrastructure such as substations. Section 2.8 
identifies principles to be followed when designing the route of overhead line 
proposals including consideration of undergrounding lines where there is the 
potential for adverse landscape and visual effects. 
 Future Landscapes: Delivering for Wales 
v.
11.3.11 The Future Landscapes: Delivering for Wales was published in 2017 and provides 
an independent review of designated landscapes in Wales. The findings and 
recommendations contained in this report follow in the spirit of the Well-Being of 
Future Generations (Wales) Act 2015 and the Environment (Wales) Act 2016.

11.3.12 Planning Policy Wales (Edition 9, November 2016) (PPW) sets out the land use 
planning policies of the Welsh Government and is supplemented by topic based 
Technical Advice Notes (TANs).  
11.3.13 TANs considered to be relevant to the landscape and visual resource include 
Technical Advisory Note 12: Design (TAN12) (2016).

11.3.14 TAN 12 provides advice on how developments should promote sustainability 
through good design.  Specifically in relation to landscape, it states “appraisal of the 
landscape should focus on its quality in terms of geology and geomorphology, 
vegetation and habitats, visual and sensory quality and historic and cultural quality.” 
It also provides design solutions and guidance to help promote sustainability in 
terms of landscape setting and local environment outlined in section 5.5.2 in the 
following terms: “The aim should be to achieve good design solutions which 
maximise the natural landscape assets and minimise environmental impact on the 
landscape. It is particularly important that proposals to amend or create new 
landscape are not considered as an afterthought and that the long term impact of 
development on the landscape is fully understood.” 
c) Local 
11.3.15 The City and Council of Swansea Unitary Development Plan (UDP) was adopted 
on the 10th November 2008. It sets out a range of policies and proposals relating to 
future development and contains a number of policies which are relevant to the 
landscape and visual resource as follows: 
 Policy EV1: Design – Outlines a number of objectives to achieve good design 
in all new developments such as “be appropriate to its local context in terms of 
scale, height, massing, elevational treatment, materials and detailing, layout, 
form, mix and density.” Such developments should be sensitive to the county’s 
unique settings and respect its surroundings. 
 Policy EV2: Siting and Location – The policy recognises that new proposed 
developments must have regards to the physical character and topography of 
the site and its surroundings. It outlines guidance such as “effectively 
integrating with the landscape, seascape or coastline by utilising topography to 
integrate into the contours of the site and avoiding conspicuous locations on 
prominent skylines and ridge”. 
 Policy EV11: Historic Parks, Gardens and Landscapes – Insures that all new 
development will not harm registered historic parks and gardens and the 
character of the historic landscapes. 
 Policy EV26: Areas of Outstanding Natural Beauty – Within the Gower AONB, 
the policy’s objective is the conservation and enhancement of the area’s 
beauty. Therefore, proposed development will not have adverse effect or 
impact on the area. 
 Policy EV30: Trees, Woodland and Hedgerow Protection – The policy ensures 
the protection of existing woodland, trees and hedgerow. 
 Policy EV32: Environment Enhancement – The policy recognises that new 
developments should be combined with improvements to the overall 
environmental quality, and to avoid significant adverse environmental impacts 
from the new development.

11.3.16 The Deposit Local Development Plan (LDP) was published for consultation 
between the 18th July and 31st August 2016. The deposit LDP presents the policies 
and proposals for managing the future growth and change that will occur within the 
City and County of Swansea. The LDP is not yet adopted and is not therefore part 
of the statutory development plan.  As emerging policy, it cannot be afforded full 
weight.  Please see Chapter 2: Regulatory and Policy Background for further 
detail. The policies relevant to the Landscape and Visual resource are as follows: 
 ER 2: Strategic Green Infrastructure Network: This Policy seeks to maintain or 
enhance the extent, quality and connectivity of the County’s multi-functional 
green infrastructure network. 
 ER 3: Green Belt and Green Wedges. This Policy seeks to ensure that within 
the Greenbelt and Green Wedges, development will only be permitted if it 
maintains the openness and character of the land. 
 ER 4: Gower Area of Outstanding Natural Beauty. This Policy seeks to 
conserve and enhance the natural beauty of the AONB, whilst accommodating 
the sustainable development needs of the local community and visitors to the 
area. 
 ER 5: Landscape Protection. The aim of this policy is to ensure that the 
character and quality of the County’s most valued landscapes are protected 
from inappropriate development and to encourage the management, 
enhancement and creation of key landscape features wherever possible. This 
Policy relates to areas outside the AONB including Special Landscape Areas 
(SLAs) of which three separate areas are identified. 
 ER 7: Undeveloped Coast. This purpose of this policy is to safeguard the 
undeveloped coast from inappropriate development. 
 ER 11: Trees and Development. This Policy seeks to protect trees, woodland 
and hedgerows of public amenity, natural/cultural heritage value or that provide 
important ecosystem services from being adversely affected by development.

Methodology 
11.4.1 This section sets out the methodology for the LVIA for the Project.  It builds on the 
general assessment methodology presented in Chapter 4: Approach to 
Environmental Impact Assessment and develops this to take account of the 
range of likely significant effects on the landscape character and visual amenity 
arising from the construction, operation and decommissioning of the Project.  
11.4.2 This section of the chapter presents the following: 
 Identification of the information sources that have been consulted throughout 
preparation of this chapter; 
 Details of consultation undertaken with respects to the landscape and visual 
resource; 
 The methodology behind the assessment of landscape and visual effects, 
including the criteria for the determination of the significance of the receptor 
and the magnitude of change from the baseline condition; 
 An explanation as to how the identification and assessment of potential 
landscape and visual effects has been reached; and; 
 The significance criteria and terminology for assessment of the residual effects 
to the landscape and visual resource.

Prepared for:  Abergelli Power Limited  
AECOM 
11-9 
 
11.4.3 The approach to the LVIA has been devised to address the specific effects likely to 
result from developments of this scale and nature. The methodology draws upon 
the following established best practice guidance: 
 Guidelines for Landscape and Visual Impact Assessment, 3rd Edition (GLVIA3) 
(Landscape Institute and Institute of Environmental Assessment and 
Management, 2013) (Ref. 11.2);  
 LANDMAP Methodological Guidance Series 2016 (Ref. 11.3); 
 Photographs from representative viewpoints and Visually Verified Montages 
(VVM) of the Project have been produced in compliance with Landscape 
Institute Advice Note 01/11: Photography and photomontage in landscape and 
visual impact assessment (Landscape Institute, 2011) (Ref. 11.4). 
11.4.4 The following terminology has been used throughout the assessment: 
 Landscape Character Areas (LCA): Areas of relatively homogenous 
landscape character. They are defined by the combination of elements that 
contribute to landscape context, character and value. Typical landscape 
elements include landform, land use, built development, vegetation and open 
space. More subjective criteria are also considered such as scale, unity and 
enclosure. In Wales landscape character is mapped using LANDMAP. 
LANDMAP 
is 
an 
all-Wales 
landscape 
resource 
where 
landscape 
characteristics, qualities and influences on the landscape are recorded and 
evaluated.  
 Zone of Theoretical Visibility (ZTV): A computer generated map based on a 
3D model of the Project and the topography within the surrounding landscape, 
which shows areas of land within which the Project will theoretically be visible.  
 Visual amenity: Relates to the way in which people visually experience the 
surrounding landscape.  Adverse visual effects may occur through the intrusion 
of new elements into established views, which are out of keeping with the 
existing structure, scale and composition of the view.  Visual effects may also 
be beneficial, where an attractive focus is created in a previously unremarkable 
view or the influence of previously detracting features is reduced.  The 
significance of effects will vary, depending on the nature and degree of change 
experienced and the perceived value and composition of the existing view. 
 Visual Receptors: Special interest or viewer groups who will have views of the 
Project. Visual receptors have been identified through desk study and 
fieldwork. 
 Representative Viewpoint: Viewpoints selected to represent the experience of 
different types of visual receptor (viewer) including settlements and residential 
properties, transport and recreational routes and other outdoor locations. 
Representative viewpoints are located predominantly within publicly accessible 
locations and have been selected in consultation with CCS and NRW. 
a) Basis of Assessment 
11.4.5 Table 3-2 in Chapter: 3 Project and Site Description outlines the parameters 
which form the basis of the assessment of likely significant effects on landscape 
and visual amenity. The LVIA assesses only the effects of the maximum 
parameters, as for this topic the maximum parameters represent the realistic worst-
case scenario.

11-10 
 
b) Scope of the assessment 
11.4.6 GLVIA3 requires that a clear distinction is drawn between landscape and visual 
effects: 
 Landscape effects relate to the degree of change to characteristics or physical 
components of a rural area, which together form the character of that 
landscape, e.g. topography, land use, vegetation and open space. 
 Visual effects relate to the degree of change to an individual receptor's or a 
receptor group's view of that landscape, e.g. local residents, users of public 
open space, footpaths or motorists passing through the area. 
11.4.7 By assessing the construction, operational and decommissioning stages of the 
Project separately, distinctions may be drawn between temporary and permanent 
effects, with permanent effects typically being of greater importance. Residual 
effects are those likely to arise from the Project taking into account all additional 
mitigation measures.  
11.4.8 The scope of this assessment has been determined through a formal EIA scoping 
process undertaken with the Secretary of State. Comments raised on the EIA 
Scoping Report have been taken into account in the development of the 
assessment methodology and these are detailed where relevant in this chapter.  
Responses to the comments raised in the EIA Scoping Opinion can be found in 
Appendix 4.1. Additional consultation has been carried out with both NRW and 
CCS and these are outlined in more detail below. 
c) Consultation 
11.4.9 The scope of the assessment has also been informed by ongoing consultation with 
statutory consultees throughout the design and assessment process, including 
NRW and CCS.

in 
stack 
height. 
They 
also 
suggested that viewpoints within 
the two neighbouring authorities 
(Carmarthenshire and Neath Port 
Talbot) could be considered. A 
final comment was made that the 
impact of the Project on heritage 
assets will need to be assessed 
along with discussion with Cadw 
(Welsh 
Government’s 
historic 
environment service). 
 
AECOM responded on the 30th 
November 2017 clarifying that 
the change in the ZTV is due to 
not only the maximum stack 
height, but also the reduction in 
the number of stacks from 5 to 1.

d) Study area 
11.4.11 The extent of the study area for the landscape assessment has been determined 
by desk based study and field survey and is defined by a 5 km radius from the 
location of the stack within the Project Site. Beyond this distance the Project is not 
considered likely to have any potential to give rise to significant landscape effects, 
due to the distance and intervening landform, settlement pattern and vegetation. 
Abergelli ES 2018 – CHAPTER 11: LANDSCAPE AND VISUAL 
 
 
Prepared for:  Abergelli Power Limited  
AECOM 
11-14 
 
11.4.12 In order to determine an initial broad study area for the visual baseline it is 
necessary to understand the likely visibility of the Project. The extent of the study 
area for the visual assessment has been identified through a review of maps and 
aerial photographs of the Project Site and surrounding area alongside the ZTV. The 
ZTV was developed using a 3D model of the maximum parameters of the Project 
and the topography within 15 km of the Project, to take account of the 45 m 
maximum height of the stack (beyond this distance significant adverse effects on 
views and visual amenity are considered unlikely). Fieldwork has been used to 
refine the theoretical visibility by establishing the influence of existing landform, 
buildings and vegetation. It is considered that significant adverse effects on visual 
amenity are likely to be limited to within 5 km of the Project Site which is reflected in 
the spread of viewpoints chosen to represent the variety of potential views of the 
Project Site. 
11.4.13 The study area for the landscape assessment is 5 km from the stack and for the 
visual assessment is 15 km from the stack as illustrated in Figures 11.7 and 11.8.  
11.4.14 Photographs and Visually Verified Montages (VVMs) have been used to describe 
and illustrate the view from each viewpoint and are contained in Document 
Reference 7.1: Photographs and Photomontages. 
e) Temporal Scope  
11.4.15 Landscape and visual effects change over time as the existing landscape external 
to the Project evolves and the proposed embedded mitigation planting establishes 
and matures.  The assessments therefore report on potential effects during 
construction, decommissioning and at operation both during winter (Year of 
opening) and summer (Year 15 once the embedded mitigation is expected to be 
established).  The assessments have been carried out, as is best practice, by 
assuming the worst case scenario, i.e. on a clear bright day, when haze would not 
interfere with the clarity of the view obtained.  
f) 
Baseline Data Collection 
11.4.16 The baseline data has been informed by a combination of desktop study and 
fieldwork. Desk based research has been undertaken with the aid of various 
published documents, including LANDMAP Aspect Data, designation citations, 
policy documents, and computer tools/software, including Ordnance Survey maps / 
digital terrain models (DTM), Google Maps and ArcGIS. 
11.4.17 Field survey visits have been undertaken during periods of clear visibility between 
July 2017 and February 2018.  This has allowed the landscape character and 
visual amenity of the study area to be experienced in a range of different conditions 
and takes into account seasonal variation. 
11.4.18 A detailed study of the existing landscape components and character of the study 
area and views within and around the Project Site has been carried out in 
consideration of the following: 
 Site context; 
Abergelli ES 2018 – CHAPTER 11: LANDSCAPE AND VISUAL 
 
 
Prepared for:  Abergelli Power Limited  
AECOM 
11-15 
 
 Topography and hydrology; 
 Movement and connectivity; 
 Land use including settlement and vegetation patterns; 
 Landscape character (with reference to LANDMAP Aspect Areas); and 
 Representative views. 
11.4.19 The visual amenity of the study area was surveyed to note the general 
characteristics and nature of existing views.  This included identification of a 
comprehensive range of viewpoints that represent a cross section of locations, 
views and viewer types likely to experience views of the Project.  These viewpoints 
include locations at a variety of distances, aspects, elevations and visual extent and 
are representative of a range of receptor types, including residential areas and 
individual properties, transport and recreational routes.   
11.4.20 Field survey is essential to develop an understanding of the key characteristics of 
the existing landscape or view, in order to establish the baseline against which 
proposed change can be assessed.  
g) Impact Assessment Methodology  
11.4.21 The following provides details of the process and classification criteria employed in 
undertaking the landscape and visual assessments.  The criteria detailed in Tables 
11-3 to Table 11-11 are not intended to be prescriptive.  Rather these examples are 
used to illustrate potential combinations of judgements which relate to the scales 
for value, susceptibility, sensitivity to change, magnitude of change and significance 
of effect as described subsequently. 
h) Sensitivity  
 
Landscape Receptors 
i.
11.4.22 Landscape receptors are described within GLVIA3 (para 5.34) as ‘components of 
the landscape that are likely to be affected by the Project’. These can include 
overall character and key characteristics, individual elements or features and 
specific aesthetic or perceptual aspects. It is the interaction between the different 
components of the Project and these landscape receptors which has potential to 
result in landscape effects (both adverse and beneficial).  
11.4.23 The sensitivity of the landscape receptor is a combination of the value of the 
landscape (undertaken as part of the baseline study) and the susceptibility to 
change of the receptor to the specific type of development being assessed. 
11.4.24 Landscape value is frequently addressed by reference to international, national, 
regional and local designations, determined by statutory bodies and planning 
agencies.  Absence of such a designation does not necessarily imply a lack of 
quality or value.  Factors such as accessibility and local scarcity can render areas 
of nationally unremarkable quality, highly valuable as a local resource.  The quality 
and condition has also been considered in the determination of the value of a 
landscape.  The evaluation of landscape value has been undertaken with reference 
to a three point scale, as outlined in Table 11-3. 
Abergelli ES 2018 – CHAPTER 11: LANDSCAPE AND VISUAL 
 
 
Prepared for:  Abergelli Power Limited  
AECOM 
11-16 
 
Table 11-3: Landscape Value Criteria 
Value 
Classification Criteria 
High 
Protected by a statutory landscape designation, an iconic landscape 
contributing strongly to a sense of place, or an unspoilt landscape 
containing unique or scarce elements/features with few, if any, 
detracting elements/features. 
Medium 
Regionally or locally designated landscape or an undesignated 
landscape with locally important, but more commonplace, features 
and containing some detracting elements/features. 
Low 
Undesignated landscape with few, if any, notable elements/features, 
or containing several detracting elements/features. 
11.4.25 The susceptibility to change is a measure of the ability of a landscape to 
“accommodate the proposed development without undue consequences for the 
maintenance of the baseline situation and/or the achievement of landscape 
planning policies and strategies” (Ref. 11.1 para 5.40, GLVIA). 
11.4.26 The guidance also refers to the fact that many existing assessments provide a 
valuation of landscape character areas/types for their ‘intrinsic’ or ‘inherent’ 
sensitivity, with no reference to specific development types.  Paragraph 5.42 of 
GLVIA (Ref. 11.1) states that “these cannot reliably inform assessment of the 
susceptibility to change since they are carried out without reference to any 
particular type of development and so do not relate to the specific development 
proposed.”  Furthermore, it goes on to say “since landscape effects in LVIA are 
particular to both the specific landscape in question and the specific nature of the 
project, the assessment of susceptibility must be tailored to the project.  It must not 
be recorded as part of the landscape baseline but should be considered as part of 
the assessment of the effects.” 
11.4.27 Landscape susceptibility has been appraised through consideration of the baseline 
characteristics of the landscape, and in particular, the scale or complexity of a given 
landscape.  The evaluation of landscape susceptibility has been undertaken with 
reference to a three point scale, as outlined in Table 11-4, below. 
Table 11-4: Landscape Susceptibility Criteria 
Susceptibility 
Classification Criteria 
High 
Attributes that contribute to a landscape which is considered to be 
intolerant of even minor change without fundamentally altering key 
characteristics. 
Medium 
Attributes that contribute to a landscape which offers some 
opportunities to accommodate change without fundamentally altering 
the key characteristics. 
Low 
Attributes that contribute to a landscape which is considered to be 
tolerant of a large degree of change without fundamentally altering 
the key characteristics.

11.4.28 Landscape sensitivity to change has been determined by employing professional 
judgement to combine and analyse the identified value and susceptibility and has 
been defined with reference to the three point scale outlined in Table 11-5, below. 
Combining susceptibility and value GLVIA3 indicates that this can be achieved in a 
number of ways and needs to include professional judgement. However it is 
generally accepted that a combination of high susceptibility and high value is likely 
to result in the highest sensitivity, whereas a low susceptibility and low value is 
likely to result in the lowest level of sensitivity. 
Table 11-5: Sensitivity of Landscape Receptors 
Sensitivity 
Classification Criteria 
High 
Landscape of national or regional value with distinctive elements and 
characteristics, considered to have a limited ability to absorb change 
without fundamentally altering the key characteristics. 
Medium 
Landscape of regional or local value, or rarity, exhibiting some distinct 
elements/features, considered tolerant of some degree of change 
without fundamentally altering the key characteristics. 
Low 
Landscape 
with 
few 
distinctive 
elements/features 
or 
valued 
characteristics and considered tolerant of a large degree of change 
without fundamentally altering the key characteristics. 
 Visual Receptors 
ii.
11.4.29 Sensitivity of visual receptors has been defined through appraisal of the viewing 
expectation, or value placed on the view as identified in the baseline study, and its 
susceptibility to change. 
11.4.30 Value of the view is an appraisal of the value attached to views and is often 
informed by the appearance on Ordnance Survey or tourist maps and in 
guidebooks, literature or art.  Value can also be indicated by the provision of 
parking or services and signage and interpretation.  The nature and composition of 
the view is also an indicator.  Value of the view has been determined with reference 
to the three point scale and criteria outlined in Table 11-6. 
Table 11-6: Value of the View 
Value 
Classification Criteria 
High 
Nationally recognised view, a view with cultural associations 
(recognised in art, literature, or other medium), or a recognised high 
quality view of the landscape with very few, if any detracting 
elements. 
Medium 
Regionally or locally recognised view, or unrecognised but pleasing 
and well composed view, with few detracting elements. 
Low 
Typical or poorly composed view, often with numerous detracting 
elements.

AECOM 
11-18 
 
11.4.31 Visual susceptibility relates to the importance of views to receptors at a certain 
location and is informed by the type of receptor and the activity with which they are 
engaged.  This considers the extent to which receptors’ attention or interest is 
focused on the view or visual amenity.  For example, residents in their home, 
walkers whose interest may tend to be focused on the landscape or a particular 
view, or visitors at an attraction where views are an important part of the 
experience, may indicate a higher level of susceptibility.  Whereas, receptors 
occupied in outdoor sport where views are not important or at their place of work 
could be considered less susceptible to change.  Visual susceptibility has been 
determined with reference to the three point scale and criteria outlined in Table 11-
7, below. 
Table 11-7: Visual Susceptibility Criteria 
Susceptibility 
Classification Criteria 
High 
Locations where the view is of primary importance and receptors are 
likely to notice even minor change. 
Medium 
Locations where the view is important but not necessarily the primary 
focus and receptors are tolerant of some change. 
Low 
Locations where the view is incidental or unimportant to receptors and 
tolerant of a high degree of change. 
11.4.32 Visual sensitivity to change has been determined by employing professional 
judgement to combine and analyse the identified value and susceptibility and has 
been defined with reference to the three point scale outlined in Table 11-8. In 
combining susceptibility and value it is generally accepted that a combination of 
high susceptibility and high value is likely to result in the highest sensitivity, 
whereas a low susceptibility and low value is likely to result in the lowest level of 
sensitivity.  
Table 11-8: Sensitivity of Visual Receptors 
Sensitivity 
Classification Criteria 
High 
Locations where receptors experience an impressive or well 
composed view containing few detracting elements, with limited ability 
to absorb change.   
Medium 
Locations where receptors experience a valued view which generally 
represents a pleasing composition but may include some detracting 
features and is tolerant of a degree of change. 
Low 
Locations where the view is incidental or not important to the 
receptors and the nature of the view is of limited value or poorly 
composed with numerous detracting features and is tolerant of a large 
degree of change.   
i) 
Landscape Magnitude of Change 
11.4.33 The magnitude of landscape change refers to the extent to which the Project would 
alter the existing characteristics of the landscape. Changes to landscape 
characteristics can be both direct and indirect.   
Abergelli ES 2018 – CHAPTER 11: LANDSCAPE AND VISUAL 
 
 
Prepared for:  Abergelli Power Limited  
AECOM 
11-19 
 
11.4.34 Magnitude of landscape change refers to the extent to which the Project would alter 
the existing characteristics of the landscape.  It is an expression of the size or scale 
of change to the landscape, the geographical extent of the area influenced and its 
duration and reversibility.  The variables involved are described below: 
 The extent of existing landscape elements that would be lost, the proportion of 
the total extent that this represents and the contribution of that element to the 
character of the landscape; 
 The extent to which aesthetic or perceptual aspects of the landscape are 
altered either by removal of existing components of the landscape or by 
addition of new ones; 
 Whether the change alters the key characteristics of the landscape, which are 
integral to its distinctive character; 
 The geographic area over which the change will be felt (within the application 
boundary itself, the immediate setting, at the scale of the landscape character 
area, on a larger scale influencing several landscape character areas); and 
 The duration of the change short term, medium term or long term and its 
reversibility (whether it is permanent, temporary or partially reversible). 
11.4.35 Magnitude of landscape change has been evaluated with reference to Table 11-9 
below ranging from higher to lower levels of magnitude described using a four point 
scale (high, medium, low, negligible).

Visual Magnitude of Change 
11.4.36 Visual magnitude of change relates to the extent to which the Project would alter 
the existing view and is an expression of the size or scale of change in the view, the 
geographical extent of the area influenced and its duration and reversibility.  The 
variables involved are described below: 
 The scale of the change in the view with respect to the loss or addition of 
features in the view and changes in its composition, including the proportion of 
the view occupied by the Project; 
 The degree of contrast or integration of any new features or changes in the 
form, scale, composition and focal points of the view; 
 The nature of the view of the Project in relation to the amount of time over 
which it will be experienced and whether views will be full, partial or glimpsed; 
 The angle of view in relation to the main activity of the receptor, distance of the 
viewpoint from the Project and the extent of the area over which the changes 
would be visible; and

a) Significance of Landscape Effect 
11.4.38 Determination of the significance of landscape effects has been undertaken by 
employing professional judgement to combine and analyse the magnitude of 
change, against the identified sensitivity of the receptor.  The assessment takes 
account of direct and indirect change on existing landscape elements, features and 
key characteristics and evaluates the extent to which these would be lost or 
modified, in the context of their importance in determining the existing baseline 
character. 
11.4.39 The levels of landscape effects are described with reference to the four point scale 
outlined in Table 11-11, below.  
Table 11-11: Significance of Landscape Effect 
Significance 
Classification Criteria 
Major 
Considerable change over an extensive area of a more sensitive 
landscape, fundamentally affecting the key characteristics and the 
overall impression of its character. 
Moderate 
Small or noticeable change to a more sensitive landscape or more 
intensive change to a less sensitive landscape, affecting some key 
characteristics and the overall impression of its character. 
Minor 
Small change to a limited area of more sensitive landscape or a more 
widespread area of a less sensitive landscape, affecting few 
characteristics and not altering the overall impression of its character. 
Negligible 
Scarcely any perceptible change to the existing landscape. 
11.4.40 Following the classification of an effect as detailed in Table 11-10, a clear statement 
is made as to whether the effect is ‘significant’ or ‘not significant’.  As a general rule, 
major and moderate effects are considered to be significant and minor and 
negligible effects are considered to be not significant. However, professional 
judgement is also applied where appropriate. 
b) Significance of Visual Effect 
11.4.41 Determination of the significance of visual effects has been undertaken by 
employing professional judgement to combine and analyse the magnitude of 
change against the sensitivity of the receptor.  The assessment takes into account 
likely changes to the visual composition, including the extent to which new features 
would distract or screen existing elements in the view or disrupt the scale, structure 
or focus of the existing view.  
11.4.42 The levels of visual effects are described with reference to the four point scale 
outlined in Table 11-12, below.

Prepared for:  Abergelli Power Limited  
AECOM 
11-24 
Table 11-12: Significance of Visual Effect 
Significance 
Classification Criteria 
Major 
Substantial loss, alteration or replacement of existing components 
which causes a very noticeable change in the existing view. 
Moderate 
Whilst some existing characteristic components of the existing view 
remain, there is a noticeable change in the overall composition. 
Minor 
The Project would be visible in the view but would form a small 
component and the majority of the view would be unaffected. 
Negligible 
The Project would be scarcely perceptible in the existing view. 
11.4.43 Following the classification of an effect as detailed in Table 11-12, a clear statement 
is made as to whether the effect is ‘significant’ or ‘not significant’.  As a general rule, 
major and moderate effects are considered to be significant and minor and 
negligible effects are considered to be not significant.  However, professional 
judgement is also applied where appropriate. 
11.5 
Baseline Environment 
11.5.1 This section describes the baseline environmental characteristics for the Project 
and surrounding areas with specific reference to the landscape and visual resource 
and respective study areas.  It should be read with reference to Figures 11.1 – 11.8. 
a)
Project Site Location and Context
Site Location and Landform
i.
11.5.2 The Project Site is situated on open agricultural land located approximately 2 km 
north of junction 46 of the M4 within the administrative boundary of the City and 
County of Swansea Council (CCS). Figure 11.1 shows the location of the Project 
approximately 1 km southeast of Felindre and 1.4 km north of Llangyfelach. 
The Project Site covers an area of up to approximately 35 ha and lies centrally 
within the Afon Lian Valley which forms a wide lowland basin with higher 
ground and steep valleys to the north and east. The valley floor is wide and 
undulating, backed to the north by upland moorland rising to over 250 m 
AOD and divided by numerous steep, narrow valleys. 
11.5.3 The Project Site is located within a valley with ground rising to the north, east and 
west which provides visual containment. Ground levels vary across the Project Site 
from approximately 140 m AOD in the north-west corner to 80 m AOD along the 
southern perimeter. Ground levels generally fall in a southerly and south easterly 
direction.

 Movement and Connectivity 
ii.
11.5.4 Junction 46 on the M4 lies approximately 2 km to the south of the Project Site 
providing immediate access to the strategic road network between London and 
South Wales. To the immediate north of Junction 46 lies the Felindre Park and 
Share at Brynwhilhach adjacent to the un-developed Felindre Business Park. A 
network of minor roads dissect the 5 km study area, connecting settlements and 
farmsteads. These are typically surrounded by earthbanks with hedgerow and tree 
planting which contains views along them and successfully integrates them into the 
wider landscape. The study area is well served with Public Rights of Way (PRoW) 
although not all are easily accessible nor do they appear to be regularly used. A 
section of the Gower Way, a long distance footpath through the Afon Lliw valley 
passes within approximately 2 km at its closest point to the northern boundary of 
the Project Site.  
 Land Use and Built Form 
iii.
11.5.5 The Project Site is predominantly covered with pasture which is currently used for 
sheep and horse grazing as well as a band of broadleaf woodland to the east. A 
soft surface horse training track, known as ‘The Gallops’, crosses the Project Site 
and runs diagonally north-west to south-east. Broadleaf woodland which is 
classified in part as Ancient Woodland lies to the east of the Project Site as well as 
around the Access Road to the Substation and Felindre Gas Compressor Station. 
Fields across the Project Site are subdivided by ditches, post and wire fencing, 
remnant hedgerows and are interspersed with scrub vegetation. 
11.5.6 Pastoral land and woodland are the predominant land uses within the wider valley, 
including Penllergaer Forest and other smaller broadleaved woodlands that are 
scattered throughout the valley. Combined with the network of hedgerows and 
hedgerow tree planting which define many of the small and irregular shaped fields 
as well as the network of minor roads, the landscape displays a well vegetated 
character. This character of woodland, rolling topography and visual containment 
helps integrate developments in the rural fabric. 
11.5.7 The western part of the Project Site encompasses the Access Road National Grid 
Car Park, adjacent to the Felindre Gas Compressor Station. Both the Substation 
and the Felindre Gas Compressor Station comprise large scale power 
infrastructure facilities characterised by tall industrial structures enclosed by 
security fencing and set within woodland planting. Pylons are prominent across the 
landscape and converge at the Substation. Pylons range in height with the closest 
pylon to the north of the Project Site 44 m in height and the pylon to the south of 
the Project Site, 51 m tall. 
11.5.8 To the west of the Project Site lies an Air-Insulated Switchgear (AIS) substation at 
Waun Ffyrdd. The associated overhead transmission lines and steel pylons are 
prominent elements within the valley landscape. To the north lies the Felindre 
Water Treatment Works at Waun y Garn-wen which is partially screened by planting 
although apparent in more elevated views from the north. 
Abergelli ES 2018 – CHAPTER 11: LANDSCAPE AND VISUAL 
 
 
Prepared for:  Abergelli Power Limited  
AECOM 
11-26 
 
11.5.9 A number of solar farms lie around the Project Site particularly to the north-east and 
east as well as to the north-west. The Felindre Business Park adjacent to the Park 
and Share at Brynwhilhach has been partially constructed with service 
infrastructure in place along with an outline landscape structure including stone 
walls and planting.   
11.5.10 The main settlement in the 5 km study area is Swansea, with the northern edges of 
the city forming notable built form in the south and south eastern parts of the study 
area, approximately 2 km from the Project Site. The Driver and Vehicle Licensing 
Agency (DVLA) office block forms a prominent tall building and local landmark in 
many views that look south. Morriston hospital complex at Pant-lasau lies to the 
south-east of the Project Site with the settlement of Clydach extending to the east. 
Settlement locally is dispersed comprising small villages such as Felindre to the 
north-west or scattered properties and farmsteads.  
b) Landscape Character 
 
Landscape Designations 
i.
11.5.11 Landscapes can be given international, national, regional or local designations in 
recognition of their importance, outstanding scenic interest or attractiveness.  The 
Brecon Beacons National Park lies 12.8 km to the northern edge of the Project Site 
at its closest point. The ZTV (Figure 11.8) indicates that there is no theoretical 
visibility between the Project and the National Park and as such the Brecon 
Beacons National Park as a landscape receptor is not considered further in the 
assessment. 
11.5.12 The Gower Area of Outstanding Natural Beauty (AONB) lies 9.1 km to the south-
west of the Project Site. The Gower AONB was designated in 1956 for its classic 
limestone coast and the variety of natural habitats. The Gower’s scenery ranges 
from dune and salt marsh in the north to dramatic limestone cliffs along the south 
coast, interspersed by sandy beaches. Inland the hills of Cefn Bryn and Rhossili 
Down dominate the landscape of traditional small fields, wooded valleys and open 
commons. The ZTV illustrates limited visibility between the Project and the AONB. 
Views of the Project Site from within the Gower AONB are substantially screened 
by intervening woodland at Penllergaer Forest and Valley Wood, intervening 
hedgerows, hedgerow trees and copses and built form within settlements at 
Gorseinion, Penllergaer, Gowerton and Waunarlwydd, as well as extensive urban 
development within Swansea.  
11.5.13 Special Landscape Areas (SLAs) are identified in the draft UDP within Policy ER 5: 
Landscape Protection and are identified on Figure 11.1. The Policy state states that 
priority will be given to protecting, managing and enhancing the character and 
quality of the three SLAs: 
 Mawr Uplands; 
 Lower Loughor Valley and Estuary and Southern part of the Burry Inlet; and 
 North East Gower and Cockett Valley. 
Abergelli ES 2018 – CHAPTER 11: LANDSCAPE AND VISUAL 
 
 
Prepared for:  Abergelli Power Limited  
AECOM 
11-27 
 
11.5.14 Within the SLAs, development will only be permitted where proposals include 
measures to protect, manage and enhance the character and quality of the 
particular landscape features for which the SLA has been designated. The aim of 
the Policy is to ensure that the character and quality of the County’s most valued 
landscapes are protected from inappropriate development and to encourage the 
management, enhancement and creation of key landscape features where 
possible. 
11.5.15 There are four Country Parks within the wider landscape but all lie beyond the 15 
km study area and do not experience any theoretical visibility. 
 Landscape Character Areas 
ii.
11.5.16 LANDMAP is the formally recognised national landscape resource in Wales to 
understand Landscape Character. It is an all-Wales landscape resource where 
landscape characteristics, qualities and influences on the landscape are recorded 
and evaluated. LANDMAP evaluates areas in terms of five key spatial datasets or 
Aspect areas:  
 Geological Landscape: considers the physical, primarily geological influences 
that have shaped the contemporary landscape and identifies those landscape 
qualities which are linked to the control or influence exerted by bedrock, 
surface processes, landforms and hydrology; 
 Landscape Habitats: identifies the characteristics and spatial relationships of 
habitats and vegetation at scales broadly comparable to other Evaluated 
Aspects; 
 Visual and Sensory: identifies perceptual landscape qualities as well as the 
physical attributes of landform and land cover including visible patterns of 
distribution and the relationships between them; 
 Historic Landscape: identifies those qualities that depend on key historic land 
uses, patterns and features; and 
 Cultural Landscape: considers the links between landscape and people, how 
human activity shapes the landscape and how culture can shape the way 
people think about the landscape. Its aim is to identify those cultural patterns 
that are keeping the landscape alive today, rather than those that sustained it in 
the past. 
11.5.17 All of the above Aspect areas have been analysed with respect to the Project in 
order to inform the assessment of landscape character and are presented in 
Appendix 11.1 and Figures 11.2 to 11.6. NRW in response to the 2018 PEIR noted 
‘that the assessment of landscape character and sensitivity should consider 
information from all five aspect areas. As well as the overall evaluation for each 
aspect, 
the 
rarity/uniqueness 
evaluation 
for 
Geological 
Landscape, 
the 
connectivity/cohesion evaluation for Landscape Habitats, the scenic quality and 
character evaluation for Visual and Sensory and the rarity and group value for 
Historic Landscape and Cultural Landscape should be taken account of’. 
Landscape character derives from all five aspects within LANDMAP and it is the 
analysis and evaluation of all the aspects which has informed judgements on value, 
susceptibility and sensitivity.  
Abergelli ES 2018 – CHAPTER 11: LANDSCAPE AND VISUAL 
 
 
Prepared for:  Abergelli Power Limited  
AECOM 
11-28 
 
11.5.18 Effects on landscape character are considered at a Project Site level and also 
within the 5 km study area.  All five aspects have been analysed within the Project 
Site and immediate visual influence to inform judgements on value, susceptibility 
and sensitivity of the landscape character at the Project Site level. The Visual and 
Sensory Aspect areas have been considered in greater detail within the 5 km study 
area as it is considered that this Aspect area is most likely to be affected by indirect 
effects on the wider landscape setting. However, where theoretical visibility exists 
within the 5 km study area, other Aspect data including Historic and Cultural 
elements have also been considered to understand the potential indirect effects on 
the landscape resource.   
c) Visual Amenity 
11.5.19 A series of 19 representative viewpoint locations have been selected to form the 
basis of the visual assessment. These have been identified to provide a 
representative cross section of visual receptors within the study area and have 
been selected in consultation with CCS and NRW. The locations of the viewpoints 
are provided on Figures 11.7 and 11.8 and details of each, including a description 
of the baseline view are provided in Table 11.13. Document Reference 7.1: 
Photographs and Photomontages provides photography of the baseline view 
from each of the viewpoint locations.

This view is representative of recreational users of the PRoW and 
minor road which lead to the small settlement of Pant-lasau. The 
PRoW follows the minor (no through) road and views are generally 
contained by roadside hedgerows and trees. Breaks in the hedgerow 
planting and field access gates provide views across agricultural land 
to extensive woodland which extends across the entire mid ground 
view. Land rises to the north and the mosaic of grazing land and 
hedgerow tree planting is evident in the distance of the view with a 
backcloth of hills within the Mawr uplands in long distance views. 
Pylons and associated transmission lines are prominent across the 
view, appearing against the skyline with a cluster around the Substation 
which along with the Felindre Gas Compressor Station is noticeable 
built elements in the mid ground left of the view.

11.6 
Embedded Mitigation 
11.6.1 As detailed in Chapter 3: Project and Site Description, a number of embedded 
mitigation measures have been identified through the iterative EIA process and 
have been incorporated into the design and construction planning of the Project.   
11.6.2 As these mitigation measures have been embedded into the design, are legal 
requirements or are standard practices that will be implemented, the assessment of 
likely significant effects assumes that they are in place. 
11.6.3 Embedded mitigation measures are described in Chapter 3: Project Site and 
Description and summarised below.  
11.6.4 Mitigation measures will be implemented during the construction phase as set out 
in the Outline CEMP (Appendix 3.1) in order to limit impacts on the landscape and 
visual resource. 
11.6.5 Utilising technology (OCGT) will allow a significant reduction in stack height 
compared to other technology types. As a result of selecting OCGT technology, 
there will be no visible plume arising from the stack. The high temperature of the 
exhaust gases means that water vapour is well above the condensation point which 
would give rise to a visible plume.  
11.6.6 The architectural design of the buildings and structures on the Project Site has 
been designed to reduce glare and to assimilate the Project into the surrounding 
landscape as much as possible by using neutral recessive colours to lessen the 
contrast with the surrounding landscape and break up the overall massing of the 
large scale structures. 
11.6.7 External lighting has been designed to reduce trespass and configured to avoid 
glare and spillage (Appendix 3.5 Outline Lighting Strategy), in accordance with the 
Outline CEMP (Appendix 3.1), and undertaken in accordance with the Institution of 
Lighting Professionals Guidelines. 
11.6.8 An Outline Landscape and Ecology Mitigation Strategy (LEMS) has been 
developed to both provide reinstatement planting as well as to integrate the Project 
into the landscape and its wider setting (Appendix 3.4). The outline planting 
proposals shown in Figure 3.6 Landscape and Ecology Mitigation Plan would be 
developed further prior to construction, in accordance with the various utility and 
service constraints within the Project Site. 
11.6.9 The landscape proposals will cover a minimum period of 25 years of monitoring, 
management and maintenance to ensure the landscape objectives are successfully 
achieved, with a review every five years.

AECOM

11.6.10 No additional or secondary mitigation measures have been proposed as there is no 
feasible additional landscape mitigation within the Project Site which could further 
reduce the landscape and visual effects due to the height of the stack and the scale 
and mass of the Power Generation Plant. However, there may be an opportunity for 
affected parties to be engaged in a voluntary scheme of off-site planting. As this 
would be entirely voluntary and would not be committed, it isn’t included in this 
assessment. All effects described in Assessment of Effects (Section 11.7) below 
are, therefore, residual.   
11.7 
Assessment of Effects 
11.7.1 This section presents the findings of the landscape and visual effects assessment 
for the construction phase, operational and decommissioning phase of the Project. 
Landscape and visual effects arising from the construction and decommissioning 
phases would be similar and have been grouped together under the construction 
phase to avoid repetition.  
11.7.2 This section should be read in conjunction with the following Appendices and 
figures: 
 Appendix 11.2 – Assessment of Landscape Effects; 
 Appendix 11.3 – Assessment of Visual Effects; and  
 Figures and Photomontages (Document Reference 7.1) 
11.7.3 Appendix 11.2 provides a detailed assessment of landscape effects for the 
construction/decommissioning and operational phases of the Project, identifying the 
value, susceptibility and sensitivity of the Aspect areas affected along with 
magnitude of change and resulting level of effect.  
11.7.4 Similarly, Appendix 11.3 provides a detailed assessment of visual effects on each of 
the viewpoints for the construction/decommissioning and operational phases of the 
Project, identifying the value, susceptibility and sensitivity of the receptors affected 
along with the magnitude of change and resulting level of effect. 
11.7.5 The sections below therefore provide a summary of the likely significant effects 
during construction/decommissioning and operation on the landscape and visual 
resource. For the full assessment, reference should be made to Appendix 11.2 and 
11.3.

detailed 
assessment 
of 
landscape 
effects 
during 
the 
construction/ 
decommissioning phase is contained in Appendix 11.2. The likely significant effects 
are summarised below. Whilst construction effects are all temporary (up to 2 years), 
there will be differences in the duration of the temporary effects for the Power 
Generation Plant, Gas Connection and Electrical Connection with the construction 
effects associated with the Power Generation Plant extending for the longest period 
of time.

11.7.7 Significant landscape effects are only predicted to result on the landscape resource 
of the Project Site. Effects on the surrounding landscape character within the 5 km 
study area would not be significant and are described in detail in Appendix 11.2. 
 
Landscape Character – Project Site 
i.
11.7.8 The landscape character of the Project Site is made up of the following LANDMAP 
Aspect Areas: 
 Visual and Sensory Aspect Areas – Rhyd-y-pandy and Penllergaer forest; 
 Landscape Habitats Aspect Areas – North of Gorseinon and Swansea; East of 
Penllergaer; Waun Y Garn Wen; 
 Historic Landscape Aspect Area – H27 Gower Supraboscus Agricultural; 
 Geological Landscape Aspect Area – Penllergaer; and 
 Cultural Landscape Aspect Area – The Mawr. 
11.7.9 It is the combination of all of the above Aspect areas which defines the overall 
character of the landscape at the Project Site level and as such value, susceptibility 
and sensitivity have been determined by consideration of each of these Aspect 
areas which have led to the following judgements. 
11.7.10 Value: With reference to the LANDMAP overall evaluation, the Aspect areas range 
from Moderate to Outstanding. The Aspect areas considered to be of High or 
Outstanding value tend not to be particularly apparent within the Project Site and 
consequently the landscape character of the Project Site is considered to be of 
Medium value. 
11.7.11 Susceptibility: The landscape resource of the Project Site is considered to have 
some capacity to accommodate the Project without effects upon its overall integrity.  
The pattern of the landscape reflects a mostly intact pattern of elements, with 
features in reasonable condition although a number of detracting elements exist 
such as the prominent power lines and adjacent Felindre Gas Compressor Station 
and Substation. Taking all of this into account, landscape susceptibility to change is 
considered to be Medium. 
11.7.12 Sensitivity: Taking into account value judgements and susceptibility, overall 
sensitivity of the landscape character for the Project Site is considered to be 
Medium. 
 Power Generation Plant  
ii.
11.7.13 Construction of the Power Generation Plant would result in temporary adverse 
effects as a result of the construction plant and activities, laydown areas and 
temporary structures on site. During construction there would be a permanent loss 
of landscape features including grazing land, trees and scrub vegetation along with 
extensive earth re-profiling. Construction noise, activities and lighting would reduce 
the relative tranquillity in the vicinity of the Project Site. Construction of the Access 
Road would result in the removal of trees and some woodland although the wider 
woodland structure including the Ancient Woodland and the associated strong 
degree of enclosure and shelter it currently provides would remain intact.  
Abergelli ES 2018 – CHAPTER 11: LANDSCAPE AND VISUAL 
 
 
Prepared for:  Abergelli Power Limited  
AECOM 
11-41 
 
11.7.14 Across the entire Project Site, the temporary presence of construction plant, 
activities and lighting would introduce noticeable features uncharacteristic of the 
landscape at present. As a result of these changes and the partial loss and 
alteration of some of the key characteristics, magnitude of change is considered to 
be Medium.   
11.7.15 The Medium sensitivity of the landscape character of the Project Site combined 
with the Medium magnitude of change would result in a Moderate Adverse effect 
on the landscape character of the Project Site during construction. 
 Gas Connection 
iii.
11.7.16 The construction of the Gas Connection would result in temporary adverse effects 
as a result of the construction plant and activity involved in constructing the Above 
Ground Installation (AGI) along with an access road into it off the Rhyd-y-pandy 
road and the Gas Pipeline. The open trench method of constructing the Gas 
Pipeline would result in the temporary removal of grazing land and the permanent 
removal of sections of field boundary hedgerow and trees.  
11.7.17 The temporary presence of construction plant, activities and lighting would 
introduce noticeable features uncharacteristic of the landscape at present. As a 
result of these changes and the partial loss and alteration of some of the key 
characteristics, magnitude of change is considered to be Medium.   
11.7.18 The Medium sensitivity assessed combined with the Medium magnitude of change 
would result in a Moderate Adverse effect on the landscape character of the 
Project Site during construction. 
 Electrical Connection 
iv.
11.7.19 The Electrical Connection route would run immediately adjacent to the alignment of 
the new Access Road and so disruption associated with its construction would be 
similar to that of the new Access Road as described above. However, the 
construction activity and plant associated with the Electrical Connection alone 
would only result in localised and limited effects to the landscape character 
resulting in a small loss of woodland and some trees which would not affect the 
integrity or key characteristics of the landscape. Magnitude of change would be 
Low which combined with the Medium sensitivity would result in a Minor Adverse 
effect on the landscape character of the Project Site during construction.

 The Project (all components) 
v.
11.7.20 Construction of the Power Generation Plant would result in temporary adverse 
effects as a result of the construction plant and activities, laydown areas and 
temporary structures on site. During construction there would be a permanent loss 
of landscape features including grazing land, trees and scrub vegetation along with 
extensive earth re-profiling. Construction noise, activities and lighting would reduce 
the relative tranquillity in the vicinity of the Project Site. Construction of the Access 
Road would result in the removal of trees and some woodland although the wider 
woodland structure including the Ancient Woodland and its associated strong 
degree of enclosure and shelter it currently provides would remain intact.  
11.7.21 The construction of the Gas Connection would result in temporary adverse effects 
as a result of the construction plant and activity involved in constructing the AGI 
along with an access road into it off the Rhyd-y-pandy road and the Gas 
Connection. The open trench method of constructing the Gas Pipeline would result 
in the temporary removal of grazing land and the permanent removal of sections of 
field boundary hedgerow and trees.  
11.7.22 The Electrical Connection route would follow the alignment of the new Access Road 
and so disruption associated with its construction would be similar to that of the 
new Access Road as described above. 
11.7.23 Across the entire Project Site, the temporary presence of construction plant, 
activities and lighting would introduce noticeable features uncharacteristic of the 
landscape at present. As a result of these changes and the partial loss and 
alteration of some of the key characteristics, magnitude of change is considered to 
be Medium.   
11.7.24 The Medium sensitivity assessed combined with the Medium magnitude of change 
would result in a Moderate Adverse effect on the landscape character of the 
Project Site during construction.

11.7.25 A 
detailed 
assessment 
of 
visual 
effects 
during 
the 
construction 
and 
decommissioning phases is contained in Appendix 11.3. Of the 19 representative 
viewpoints assessed only 5 of the viewpoints (9, 14, 15, 16 and 17) representing 
views from residential receptors or recreational routes within 700 m of the Project 
Site 
would 
experience 
significant 
effects 
during 
the 
construction 
and 
decommissioning phases of the Project. All other viewpoints across the 15 km 
study area would either experience a Minor Adverse or Negligible effect or No 
Effect at all.

11.7.26 The Project Site lies within a valley where it is visually contained from the north, 
east and west by the higher valley sides and vegetation. Views from local roads are 
screened or filtered by hedges and earth banks. Views overlooking the Project Site 
from higher ground to the north and more distant views from the south east close to 
the Gower AONB would not experience significant effects due to the intervening 
distance, vegetation and built form. Where views of the construction of the upper 
parts of the Power Generation Plant and stack are visible in the middle distance of 
views, they would be seen in the context of the existing network of pylons and 
transmission lines as well as the tall structures present at the Felindre Gas 
Compressor Station and Substation and as a result would not experience 
significant visual effects. 
11.7.27 The remaining significant effects would be experienced by viewpoints 
representative of residential and recreational receptors within close proximity to the 
Project Site and are summarised below. 
 
Power Generation Plant  
i.
11.7.28 Significant effects during construction are predicted to be experienced at 5 of the 
19 representative viewpoints assessed. 
11.7.29 Viewpoint 9 – Public Right of Way, north of Aber-gelli fach. 
11.7.30 This view overlooks the Power Generation Plant where construction plant and 
activity associated with the upper parts of the gas turbine unit and stack would be 
visible in the view. Much of the Project Site would be screened by intervening 
woodland and scrub vegetation. The degree of screening provided by existing 
vegetation would reduce during winter months when some construction plant and 
activities including lighting would be more visible through the intervening woodland 
and hedgerows.   
11.7.31 Magnitude of change would be Medium which when combined with a Medium 
sensitivity would result in a Moderate Adverse effect. 
11.7.32 Viewpoint 14 – Public Right of Way near Maes-eglwys Farm 
11.7.33 Construction activity and plant associated with the Power Generation Plant would 
be prominent in views from this location. Whilst some of the construction of the 
lower sections of plant would be screened by tall hoardings (>3 m high) and 
intervening vegetation in summer months, the change to the view whilst temporary 
would be extensive and prominent affecting a wide part of the view.  
11.7.34 Magnitude of change would be High which when combined with the High sensitivity 
would result in a Major Adverse effect.

11.7.35 Viewpoint 15 – Public Right of Way and Minor Road 
11.7.36 Temporary construction activity and taller plant such as cranes associated with the 
construction of the stack and upper parts of the Power Generation Plant would be 
visible against the skyline. Intervening trees and woodland would limit the extent of 
construction activity visible in the view although, the degree of screening provided 
by existing vegetation would reduce during winter months when some construction 
plant and activities including lighting would be more visible through the intervening 
woodland and hedgerows.   
11.7.37 Magnitude of change would be Medium which combined with the Medium 
Sensitivity would result in a Moderate Adverse effect. 
11.7.38 Viewpoint 16 – Dorglwyd 
11.7.39 The lower part of the Power Generation Plant would be screened by intervening 
trees during the construction period. Construction plant associated with the gas 
turbine unit and stack would be prominent in the view and visible against the 
skyline. The change to the view whilst temporary would be extensive and prominent 
affecting a wide part of the view. 
11.7.40 Magnitude of change would be High which combined with the High Sensitivity 
would result in a Major Adverse effect. 
11.7.41 Viewpoint 17 – Cefn Betingau Farm 
11.7.42 Construction activity and plant associated with the Power Generation Plant would 
be prominent in views from this location. Whilst some of the construction of the 
lower sections of plant would be screened by extensive intervening woodland and 
landform the taller plant and lighting would be prominent in the view.  
11.7.43 Whilst the intervening woodland would limit the extent of construction activity visible 
in the view in the summer months, the degree of screening provided by the 
woodland would reduce during winter months when construction plant and activities 
including lighting, whilst temporary, would be extensive and prominent affecting a 
wide part of the view.  
11.7.44 Magnitude of change would be High which when combined with the High sensitivity 
would result in a Major Adverse effect. 
 Gas Connection 
ii.
11.7.45 During construction significant effects resulting from the construction of the Gas 
Connection are predicted to only occur at one of the representative viewpoints. 
11.7.46 Viewpoint 9 – Public Right of Way, north of Aber-gelli fach.

11.7.47 The focus of this view is towards the Power Generation Plant; however, the Gas 
Connection route would cut across the fields to the right of the view where the 
construction activity and plant would be a prominent although temporary element of 
the view. Further south some screening would be provided by intervening trees and 
hedges. Whilst the construction of the AGI would not be visible from this particular 
point on the PRoW, construction of it would be prominent in the view of walkers as 
they travel north. 
11.7.48 Magnitude of change would be Medium which when combined with a Medium 
sensitivity would result in a Moderate Adverse effect. 
 Electrical Connection 
iii.
11.7.49 There would be no significant effects on any of the views from the representative 
viewpoints as a result of construction of the Electrical Connection. 
 The Project (all components) 
iv.
11.7.50 The construction plant and activity associated with the construction of the most 
visually prominent element of the Project would be the Power Generation Plant 
including the stack. As such the significant visual effects experienced by receptors 
for the construction and decommissioning phases of the Project as a whole would 
be as described in the Power Generation Plant section above with significant 
effects experienced at 5 of the 19 representative viewpoints assessed (viewpoints 
9, 14, 15, 16 and 17).   
c) Operation – Summary of significant landscape effects 
11.7.51 A detailed assessment of landscape effects during the operation phase is contained 
in Appendix 11.2. The significant effects are summarised below. 
11.7.52 Significant landscape effects are only predicted to result on the landscape resource 
of the Project Site. Effects on the surrounding landscape character within the 5 km 
study area would not be significant and are described in detail in Appendix 11.2. 
11.7.53 Landscape Character – Project Site 
11.7.54 The landscape character of the Project Site is made up of the following LANDMAP 
Aspect Areas: 
 Visual and Sensory Aspect Areas – Rhyd-y-pandy and Penllergaer forest; 
 Landscape Habitats Aspect Areas – North of Gorseinon and Swansea; East of 
Penllergaer; Waun Y Garn Wen; 
 Historic Landscape Aspect Area – H27 Gower Supraboscus Agricultural; 
 Geological Landscape Aspect Area – Penllergaer; and 
 Cultural Landscape Aspect Area – The Mawr. 
11.7.55 It is the combination of all of the above Aspect areas which defines the overall 
character of the landscape at the Project Site level and as such value, susceptibility 
and sensitivity have been determined by consideration of each of these Aspect 
areas which have led to the following judgements. 
Abergelli ES 2018 – CHAPTER 11: LANDSCAPE AND VISUAL 
 
 
Prepared for:  Abergelli Power Limited  
AECOM 
11-46 
 
11.7.56 Value: With reference to the LANDMAP overall evaluation, the Aspect areas range 
from Moderate to Outstanding. The Aspect areas considered to be of High or 
Outstanding value tend not to be particularly apparent within the Project Site and 
consequently the landscape character of the Project Site is considered to be of 
Medium value. 
11.7.57 Susceptibility: The landscape resource of the Project Site is considered to have 
some capacity to accommodate the Project without effects upon its overall integrity.  
The pattern of the landscape reflects a mostly intact pattern of elements, with 
features in reasonable condition although a number of detracting elements exist 
such as the prominent power lines and adjacent Felindre Gas Compressor Station 
and Substation. Taking all of this into account, landscape susceptibility to change is 
considered to be Medium. 
11.7.58 Sensitivity: Taking into account value judgements and susceptibility, overall 
sensitivity of the landscape character for the Project Site is considered to be 
Medium. 
 
Power Generation Plant  
i.
11.7.59 Once operational the Power Generation Plant would be a prominent feature within 
the immediate landscape of the Generating Equipment Site. It would result in the 
partial loss to landscape features, including grazing land, trees and scrub 
vegetation, which would result in a partial change to some of the landscape 
characteristics although it would not diminish the overall integrity of the landscape. 
11.7.60 The Access Road would lie substantially within the woodland characteristic of the 
Penllergaer Forest Aspect Area which would retain its qualities providing a strong 
degree of enclosure and shelter.  
11.7.61 Across the wider Generating Equipment Site  there would be a partial loss to some 
of the key characteristics of the landscape but this would not result in an obvious 
change to the overall character of the area. These effects would be long term. At 
year of opening the magnitude of change would be Medium which when combined 
with the Medium sensitivity to change would result in a Moderate Adverse effect 
on the landscape character of the Project Site. 
11.7.62 Once the structure planting around the Power Generation Plant establishes it would 
assist in providing some additional structure to the landscape which would assist in 
integrating elements of the development into the local landscape. Nonetheless, 
despite the establishment of the planting, the magnitude of effect is considered to 
remain Medium in the long term (Year 15) as there would remain a noticeable 
alteration of the existing components of the landscape of the Generating Equipment 
Site. This would result in a Moderate Adverse effect on the landscape character. 
 Gas Connection 
ii.
11.7.63 There would be no significant effects on the landscape character as a result of the 
Gas Connection.

 Electrical Connection 
iii.
11.7.64 There would be no significant effects on the landscape character as a result of the 
Electrical Connection. 
 The Project (all components) 
iv.
11.7.65 Once operational the Power Generation Plant would be a prominent feature within 
the immediate landscape of the Project Site. It would result in the partial loss to 
landscape features, including grazing land, trees and scrub vegetation, which 
would result in a partial change to some of the landscape characteristics although it 
would not diminish the overall integrity of the landscape. 
11.7.66 The Access Road would lie substantially within the woodland characteristic of the 
Penllergaer Forest Aspect Area which would retain its qualities providing a strong 
degree of enclosure and shelter.  
11.7.67 The Gas Pipeline would be reinstated upon operation with fields returned to grazing 
and field boundaries reinstated with hedgerow and tree planting. Structure planting 
and reinstatement boundary vegetation would be planted around the AGI to assist 
in assimilating it within the immediate landscape pattern. Planting would extend up 
to existing field boundaries in order to retain the field pattern and avoid land 
severance.  
11.7.68 The Electrical Connection route would be buried immediately adjacent to the 
Access Road and the long term residual effects on the landscape would be similar 
to the Access Road as described above. 
11.7.69 Across the wider site there would be a partial loss to some of the key 
characteristics of the landscape but would not result in an obvious change to the 
overall character of the area. These effects would be long term.  At year of opening 
the magnitude of change would be Medium which when combined with the Medium 
sensitivity to change would result in a Moderate Adverse effect on the landscape 
character of the Project Site. 
11.7.70 Once the structure planting around the Power Generation Plant and AGI 
establishes it would assist in providing some additional structure to the landscape 
which alongside the reinstatement hedgerow planting and fields returned to grazing 
along the Gas Pipeline route would assist in integrating elements of the 
development into the local landscape. Nonetheless, despite the establishment of 
the planting, the magnitude of effect is considered to remain Medium at year 15 as 
there would remain a noticeable alteration of the existing components of the 
landscape of the Project Site. This would result in a Moderate Adverse effect on 
the landscape character of the Project Site.

d) Operation – Summary of significant visual effects 
11.7.71 A detailed assessment of visual effects during the operation phase is contained in 
Appendix 11.3. Of the 19 representative viewpoints assessed only 5 of the 
viewpoints (9, 14, 15, 16 and 17) representing views from residential receptors or 
recreational routes within 700 m of the Project Site would experience significant 
effects once the Project is operational. All other viewpoints across the 15 km study 
area would either experience a Minor Adverse or Negligible effect or No Effect at 
all.  
11.7.72 The Project Site lies within a valley where it is visually contained from the north, 
east and west by the higher valley sides and vegetation. Views from local roads are 
screened or filtered by hedges and earth banks. Views overlooking the Project Site 
from higher ground to the north and more distant views from the south east close to 
the Gower AONB would not experience significant effects due to the intervening 
distance, vegetation and built form. Where the upper parts of the Power Generation 
Plant and stack are visible in the middle distance of views, they would be seen in 
the context of the existing network of pylons and transmission lines as well as the 
tall structures present at the Felindre Gas Compressor Station and Substation and 
as a result would not experience significant visual effects. 
11.7.73 The remaining significant effects would be experienced by viewpoints 
representative of residential and recreational receptors within close proximity (700 
m) to the Project Site where the landscape mitigation planting (Figure 3.6) would 
not be able to reduce the significant effects experienced. These significant effects 
are summarised below. 
 
Power Generation Plant  
i.
11.7.74 Significant effects associated with the Power Generation Plant during operation 
would be experienced at 5 of the 19 representative viewpoints assessed. 
11.7.75 Viewpoint 9 – Public Right of Way, north of Aber-gelli fach. 
11.7.76 Once operational the upper part of the gas turbine and stack would be visible 
against the vegetated backcloth of rising ground to the south, within a small portion 
of the centre of the mid ground of the view. Whilst they would be seen in the 
immediate context of the pylons and the stack would not be visible against the 
skyline, it would introduce a noticeable element into the view resulting in a partial 
change to the composition of the view. 
11.7.77 Magnitude of change would be Medium which when combined with a Medium 
sensitivity would result in a Moderate Adverse effect.  
11.7.78 Viewpoint 14 – Public Right of Way near Maes-eglwys Farm 
Abergelli ES 2018 – CHAPTER 11: LANDSCAPE AND VISUAL 
 
 
Prepared for:  Abergelli Power Limited  
AECOM 
11-49 
 
11.7.79 The Power Generation Plant and in particular the upper part of the Generating 
Equipment Site would appear prominent in the view and at close range. The stack 
would appear against the skyline at a similar height as the adjacent pylons but 
more apparent due to the solid mass of the stack structure. Whilst mitigation 
structure planting once established would help to screen lower parts of the Power 
Generation Plant, the taller structures would remain prominent. Overall there would 
be an extensive change to the composition of the existing view. 
11.7.80 Magnitude of change would be High which combined with the High Sensitivity 
would result in a Major Adverse effect. 
11.7.81 Viewpoint 15 – Public Right of Way and Minor Road 
11.7.82 The taller structures in the Power Generation Plant including the stack would be 
visible from this viewpoint. The stack would be seen against the skyline and at a 
similar height as the adjacent pylons although would appear more prominent as it 
would be a denser structure. There would be a partial change to the composition of 
the view which whilst immediately visible would not become the key features in the 
view particularly given the existing industrial elements apparent in the view. 
11.7.83 Magnitude of change would be Medium which combined with the Medium 
Sensitivity would result in a Moderate Adverse effect. 
11.7.84 Viewpoint 16 – Dorglwyd 
11.7.85 Once operational and during winter months, there would be clear views of the taller 
structures within the Power Generation Plant, viewed over extensive intervening 
woodland. The stack would be prominent and seen against the skyline. Whilst it 
would appear smaller than the adjacent pylon in the view, the stack would appear 
as prominent due to its denser structure. During summer months the Power 
Generation Plant including the stack would be barely discernible due to the 
boundary screen planting, however, the degree of screening provided by this 
vegetation would reduce during winter months when the taller structures would 
remain prominent. Overall there would be an extensive change to the composition 
of the existing view.   
11.7.86 Magnitude of change would be High which combined with the High Sensitivity 
would result in a Major Adverse effect. 
11.7.87 Viewpoint 17 – Cefn Betingau Farm 
11.7.88 The Power Generation Plant and in particular the upper part of the generating 
equipment would appear prominent in the view, at close range, changing an 
extensive proportion of the view, particularly during winter months. The stack would 
appear against the skyline and whilst seen in the context of the adjacent pylons, 
would be more apparent due to the solid mass of the stack structure. This along 
with the taller structures would remain prominent in the view, particularly during the 
winter when the intervening vegetation would offer less screening. Overall there 
would be an extensive change to the composition of the existing view.

11.7.89 Magnitude of change would be High which combined with the High Sensitivity 
would result in a Major Adverse effect. 
 Gas Connection 
ii.
11.7.90 Once operational, the Gas Connection would not result in any significant visual 
effects from the representative viewpoints assessed.  
 Electrical Connection 
iii.
11.7.91 Once operational, the Electrical Connection would not result in any significant 
visual from the representative viewpoints assessed. 
 Project “in combination” Effects 
iv.
11.7.92 The most visually prominent element of the Project would be the Power Generation 
Plant including the stack. Although the Project Site is surrounded by existing 
woodland and undulating topography which would screen the lower parts of the 
Power Generation Plant the stack and upper parts of the Power Generation Plant 
would be visible above it. The existing vegetation screen would be strengthened by 
woodland and hedgerow planting as part of the Outline Landscape and Ecology 
Mitigation Strategy (Appendix 3.4) and Outline Landscape and Ecology Mitigation 
Plan (LEMP) (Figure 3.6). Nonetheless the Power Generation Plant would result in 
significant adverse visual effects for the viewpoints representative of views 
experienced by nearby residential properties and recreational receptors within 700 
m of the Project Site. 
11.7.93 As such the visual effects associated with the Project as a whole would be the 
same as those described in the Power Generation Plant section above with 
significant effects experienced at 5 of the 19 representative viewpoints assessed 
(viewpoints 9, 14, 15, 16 and 17).   
11.8 
Mitigation and Monitoring  
11.8.1 Embedded mitigation measures, which have been incorporated within the design of 
the Project or are standard practice measures that have been committed to are 
summarised in Section 11.5. All mitigation measures for the landscape and visual 
assessment are embedded. Whilst residual significant effects remain for some of 
the landscape and visual receptors, no additional mitigation is available that would 
be effective in further reducing effects.   
11.9 
Residual Effects 
11.9.1 As all mitigation is embedded in the Project and there is no additional mitigation, all 
effects described in the Assessment of Effects section above are residual. The 
following tables therefore present a summary of the landscape and visual 
assessment.

11.10 Cumulative Effects  
a) Assessment 
of 
Potential 
Cumulative 
Effects 
– 
Construction 
and 
Decommissioning 
 
Description of Impact 
i.
11.10.1 The following potential cumulative effects on landscape and visual receptors have 
been identified as potentially arising as a result of construction and 
decommissioning of the Project in combination with other schemes set out in 
Chapter 17: Cumulative Impacts. Only receptors considered to experience 
significant residual effects as identified in the landscape and visual assessment of 
the Project have been considered below in combination with the potential effects 
from the cumulative projects. 
 Landscape character of the Project Site comprising the following Aspect Areas:  
- 
Visual and Sensory Aspect Areas – Rhyd-y-pandy and Penllergaer forest; 
- 
Landscape Habitats Aspect Areas – North of Gorseinon and Swansea; 
East of Penllergaer; Waun Y Garn Wen; 
- 
Historic Landscape Aspect Area – H27 Gower Supraboscus Agricultural; 
- 
Geological Landscape Aspect Area – Penllergaer; and 
- 
Cultural Landscape Aspect Area – The Mawr 
 Viewpoint 9 – views experienced from the PRoW north of Aber-gelli fach; 
 Viewpoint 14 – views experienced from the PRoW near Maes-eglwys Farm; 
 Viewpoint 15 – views experienced from the PRoW and minor road which lead 
to Pant-lasau; 
 Viewpoint 16 – views from Dorglwyd residential property; and 
 Viewpoint 17 – views from Cefn Betingau Farm. 
11.10.2 However, no cumulative development would be visible from viewpoints 14, 16 and 
17 and are therefore not considered any further in the cumulative assessment. 
ii. Assessment of cumulative effect 
11.10.3 The following cumulative developments are located within the Aspect areas which 
characterise the landscape of the Project Site: 
Rhyd-y-pandy (Visual and Sensory) 
 1,10,12 (Felindre Business Park) 
 Identified/Allocated sites 23, 24, 27-29 
Penllergaer forest (Visual and Sensory) 
 6 – Former J R Steelworks, Bryntywod 
 11 – Llettyr Morfil Farm 
 13 – Griffiths Waste Management Site 
 21 – Land at Bryntywod 
Abergelli ES 2018 – CHAPTER 11: LANDSCAPE AND VISUAL 
 
 
Prepared for:  Abergelli Power Limited 
 
AECOM 
11-63 
 
11.10.4 The construction activity and plant associated with the Project in combination with 
the construction of these cumulative developments would result in localised effects 
on these Visual and Sensory Aspect areas, with the cumulative developments 
concentrated in areas that are already influenced by development. As such the 
introduction of construction activity and lighting associated with the Project into this 
cumulative picture would result in a partial change to some of the landscape 
characteristics although it would not be sufficient to diminish the overall integrity of 
the landscape. 
North of Gorseinon and Swansea (Landscape Habitats) 
 Identified/Allocated sites 23, 28, 29 
East of Penllergaer (Landscape Habitats) 
 1, 10, 12 (Felindre Business Park) 
 6 – Former J R Steelworks, Bryntywod 
 11 – Llettyr Morfil Farm 
 13 – Griffiths Waste Management Site 
 21 – Land at Bryntywod 
 24 – NW of M4 J46, Llangyfelach 
Waun Y Garn Wen (Landscape Habitats) 
 No cumulative schemes 
11.10.5 The construction activity and plant associated with the Project in combination with 
these cumulative schemes is considered to have localised effects on the grassland 
habitats but not sufficient to result in a noticeable change to the landscape habitat 
characteristics. 
H27 Gower Supraboscus Agricultural (Historic Landscape) 
 1, 10, 12 (Felindre Business Park) 
 6 – Former J R Steelworks, Bryntywod 
 11 – Llettyr Morfil Farm 
 13 – Griffiths Waste Management Site 
 24 – NW of M4 J46, Llangyfelach 
 Identified/Allocated sites 21, 27-29 
11.10.6 The construction activity and plant associated with the Project in combination with 
these cumulative schemes is considered to have a localised effect on the enclosed 
pattern of fields typical of this historic landscape Aspect area. 
Penllergaer (Geological Landscape) 
 1, 10, 12 (Felindre Business Park) 
 6 – Former J R Steelworks, Bryntywod

 Identified/Allocated sites 21, 27-29 
11.10.7 The construction activity and plant associated with the Project in combination with 
these cumulative schemes is not considered to affect key features of geological or 
geomorphological significance. 
The Mawr (Cultural Landscape) 
 1, 10, 12 (Felindre Business Park) 
 6 – Former J R Steelworks, Bryntywod 
 11 – Llettyr Morfil Farm 
 13 – Griffiths Waste Management Site 
 24 – NW of M4 J46, Llangyfelach 
 Identified/Allocated sites 21, 27-29 
11.10.8 The construction activity and plant associated with the Project in combination with 
these cumulative schemes is not considered to affect the multi-period historic and 
evolved cultural significance. 
11.10.9 Overall the construction activity and plant associated with the Project in 
combination with the construction of these cumulative schemes would result in 
localised effects on these Aspect areas which define the landscape character of the 
Project Site, with the cumulative developments mainly concentrated in areas that 
are already influenced by development. As such the introduction of construction 
plant and lighting associated with the Project into this cumulative picture would 
result in a partial change to some of the landscape characteristics of the Project 
Site area although it would not be sufficient to diminish the overall integrity of the 
landscape. 
11.10.10 Cumulative magnitude of change would be Low which combined with the Medium 
sensitivity would result in a Minor Adverse cumulative effect which is not 
significant. 
Viewpoint 9 – PRoW, north of Aber-gelli fach 
11.10.11 The construction of the following cumulative developments would potentially be 
visible from this viewpoint: 
 1 – Felindre Business Park 
 6 – Former Steelworks, Bryntywod 
 11 – Llettyr Morfil Farm 
 12 – Plot 8 Felindre Business Park 
 13 – Griffiths Waste Management Site 
 15 – Land at Llewellyn Road 
 16 – Royal Fern Golf Resort 
 8 – Parc Ceirw 
 19 – Former Civic Centre Penllergaer 
 Identified/Allocated sites 21-24, 26-29

Prepared for:  Abergelli Power Limited 
 
AECOM 
11-65 
 
11.10.12 Construction associated with the majority of the above cumulative schemes would 
be barely discernible in the view due to distance, intervening planting, landform and 
built fabric. The only cumulative developments where the plant and construction 
activity might be visible in combination with the Project would be sites 24, 27 and 
29, all of which are Identified/Allocated sites, where little information is currently 
available. Construction plant and activity associated with the residential 
development in site 27 might appear in the distant view against the urban backcloth 
of north Swansea. The construction of the potential Combined Heat and Power 
(CHP) facility (site 29) and site 24 (northwest of M4 J46, Llangyfelach) might 
potentially be visible in the mid-ground of the view.  
11.10.13 The construction of the Project in combination with these three sites has the 
potential to introduce construction activity into small, separate parts of the view 
resulting in a limited cumulative change. As such the construction of the Project in 
combination with these three cumulative sites would result in a Low magnitude of 
cumulative change which when combined with the Medium sensitivity of the 
receptor would result in a Minor Adverse cumulative effect which is not significant. 
11.10.14 Viewpoint 15 – PRoW and Minor Road 
11.10.15 The construction of the following cumulative development would potentially be 
visible from this viewpoint: 
 28 – Morriston Hospital 
11.10.16 This is an Identified/Allocated site and little information is available about the future 
development, either in terms of location or scale. Construction plant and activity 
associated with the Project in combination with the construction of cumulative site 
28 might result in small changes to the mid-ground view, although intervening 
vegetation would limit the extent of construction activity visible. 
11.10.17 At worst, cumulative magnitude of change would be Low which combined with the 
Medium sensitivity would result in a Minor Adverse cumulative effect which is not 
significant.  
 Mitigation 
ii.
11.10.18 As no significant cumulative effects are predicted, it is not considered necessary to 
identify additional mitigation, management actions or monitoring.  
 Residual cumulative effect 
iii.
11.10.19 As no mitigation is proposed, all effects described above are residual. These are 
summarised in Table 11-16.

11.10.20 The following potential cumulative impacts on landscape and visual receptors have 
been identified as potentially arising as a result of operation of the Project in 
combination with other schemes set out in Chapter 17. Only receptors considered 
to experience significant residual effects as identified in the landscape and visual

11.10.31 The majority of the above cumulative schemes would be barely discernible in the 
view due to distance, intervening planting, landform and built fabric. The only 
cumulative developments which might be visible in combination with the Project 
would be schemes 24, 27 and 29, all of which are Identified/Allocated sites and so 
little information is currently available. Once operational the residential mixed use 
development (scheme 27) would be barely discernible from the northern urban 
edge of Swansea. Depending on the scale of the CHP facility (scheme 29) it might 
be visible in the mid-ground of the view, partially screened by intervening 
vegetation and site 24 might be visible set within the wooded valley structure in the 
periphery of the view. The Project in combination with site 29 would introduce 
another industrial development into the mid-ground of the view, and in combination 
with site 24 both would occupy a different horizontal extent of the view and would 
be partially screened by vegetation. The Low cumulative magnitude of change 
combined with the medium sensitivity would result in a Minor Adverse cumulative 
effect which would not be significant. 
Viewpoint 15 – PRoW and Minor Road 
11.10.32 The following cumulative development would potentially be visible from this 
viewpoint: 
 28 – Morriston Hospital 
11.10.33 This is an Identified/Allocated site and little information is available about this future 
development, either in terms of location or scale. There is a possibility that the 
Project would be visible in combination with cumulative site 28, however, 
intervening vegetation is likely to screen much of cumulative site 28 and the 
introduction of the Project into this cumulative picture would at worst result in a Low 
cumulative magnitude of change. This combined with the Medium sensitivity would 
result in a Minor Adverse cumulative effect which would not be significant.

Traffic, Transport and Access 
12.1 
Introduction 
12.1.1 This chapter provides an assessment of the likely transport effects arising from 
construction, operation and decommissioning of the Project. Maintenance is 
included within the operational assessment of the Project. 
12.1.2 A detailed description of the Project Site and the Project is provided in Chapter 3: 
Project and Site Description.  A glossary of terms and list of abbreviations used in 
this chapter is provided in Document Reference 1.4. 
12.1.3 A Transport Assessment (TA) has been incorporated into this chapter to provide a 
single source for the analysis of the likely transport effects of the Project. This is in 
line with approach undertaken in relation to other nationally significant infrastructure 
projects. A Construction Traffic Management Plan (CTMP) and a Construction Staff 
Travel Plan (CSTP) are presented in Appendix 3.3a and 3.3b respectively. 
a) 
Objectives of the assessment 
 The objectives of the assessment were to: 
12.1.4
 Identify the national and local legislation and policy considered relevant to the 
Project; 
 Identify the baseline conditions of the study area, including existing movements 
associated with the Project Site, the local highway network and operational 
conditions, road safety and accessibility by sustainable modes; 
 Identify the significance of effects of the Project during the construction, 
operational and decommissioning periods following implementation of 
embedded mitigation; 
 Identify the additional mitigation required to prevent, reduce or offset any 
significant adverse effects; and 
 Identify the likely residual effects and cumulative effects once these measures 
have been employed. 
12.2 
Changes since the 2014 PEIR 
12.2.1 There have been changes to the design as a result of design evolution and 
consultation as detailed in Chapter 3: Project and Site Description. To aid the 
reader, Table 12-1 below outlines the changes to this assessment compared with 
the 2014 PEIR. There are no changes to report since the 2018 PEIR.

Legislation, Policy and Guidance  
12.3.1 This section identifies and describes legislation, policy and guidance of relevance 
to the assessment of the potential transport impacts associated with the Project. 
12.3.2 Legislation and policy has been considered on a national, regional and local level. 
The following is considered to be relevant to the TA as it has influenced the 
sensitivity of receptors and requirements for mitigation or the scope and/or 
methodology of the ES. 
a) National 
12.3.3 The national (UK and Wales) legislation, policy and guidance that has been 
consulted is as follows: 
 Overarching National Policy Statement for Energy (EN-1), Department of 
Energy and Climate Change (July 2011) (Ref. 12.1); 
 Planning Policy Wales, Edition 9, Welsh Government (November 2016) (Ref. 
12.2); 
 Technical Advice Note 18: Transport, Welsh Government (March 2007) (Ref. 
12.3); 
 Wales Transport Strategy, Welsh Government (April 2008) (Ref. 12.4); 
 Active Travel (Wales) Act, Welsh Government (2013) (Ref. 12.5); and 
 Guidelines for the Environmental Assessment of Road Traffic, Institute of 
Environmental Assessment (1993) (Ref. 12.6). 
12.3.4 Relevant provisions and policies from these documents have been identified under 
the following sub-sections. 
Abergelli ES 2018 – CHAPTER 12: TRAFFIC, TRANSPORT AND ACCESS 
Prepared for:  Abergelli Power Limited  
AECOM 
12-7 
 
i. 
Overarching National Policy Statement for Energy (EN-1) 
12.3.5 The Overarching National Policy Statement for Energy (EN-1) was published in 
July 2011 (Ref. 12.1). It sets out the national policy for energy infrastructure. 
12.3.6 Section 5.13 deals with ‘Traffic and Transport’. It requires projects that are likely to 
have significant transport implications to include a TA as part of the Environmental 
Statement (ES), prepared in accordance with the appropriate guidance at that time. 
Where appropriate, a travel plan should be prepared including demand 
management measures to mitigate transport impacts, and details of proposed 
measures to improve access by public transport, walking and cycling, to reduce the 
need for parking associated with the proposal and to mitigate transport impacts. 
Where mitigation is needed, possible demand management measures must be 
considered and if feasible and operationally reasonable, required, before 
considering requirements for the provision of new inland transport infrastructure to 
deal with remaining transport impacts. Where the proposed mitigation measures 
are insufficient to reduce the impact on the transport infrastructure to acceptable 
levels, the Secretary of State (SoS) should consider requirements to mitigate 
adverse impacts on transport networks arising from the development. 
ii. Planning Policy Wales, Edition 9 
12.3.7 Edition 9 of Planning Policy Wales (PPW) was published in November 2016 and 
sets out the land use planning policies of the Welsh Government (WG) (Ref. 12.2). 
It is supported by a number of Technical Advice Notes (TANs), which provide 
detailed planning advice on subjects contained within PPW. TAN 18: Transport is 
considered of particular relevance to the Project and is included in this policy 
review. An overarching theme within PPW is the commitment of the WG to 
sustainability. 
12.3.8 Planning policy in Wales is plan-led, with up to date Local Development Plans 
(LDPs) forming a fundamental part of the system. PPW states that planning 
applications “must be determined in accordance with the adopted plan unless 
material considerations indicate otherwise”. 
iii. Technical Advice Note 18: Transport 
12.3.9 TAN 18 was published in March 2007 (Ref. 12.3). It describes how to integrate land 
use and transport planning, and explains how transport impacts should be 
assessed and mitigated. It supports and should be read in conjunction with PPW. 
12.3.10 Paragraph 9.2 states that “developers should be required by local authorities to 
submit 
transport 
assessments 
to 
accompany 
planning 
applications 
for 
developments that are likely to result in significant trip generation”. A TA is included 
as part of this ES. 
 TAN 18 requires a Transport Implementation Strategy (TIS). This should seek to: 
12.3.11
 “Identify what policy objectives and requirements are set by the development 
plan in terms of access to the development and movements in and around the 
site; 
Abergelli ES 2018 – CHAPTER 12: TRAFFIC, TRANSPORT AND ACCESS 
Prepared for:  Abergelli Power Limited  
AECOM 
12-8 
 
 Identify what access arrangements are required for a successful development 
(meeting the needs of the developer, end user, addressing impacts on 
neighbours and existing movements surrounding the site); and 
 Specify the package of physical, management and promotional measures 
needed to accommodate the requirements identified above, such as physical 
infrastructure, the design and location of buildings, parking management, 
financial incentives and dedicated travel plan co-ordinators.” 
12.3.12 The requirements of a TIS are addressed in this ES chapter. Policy is discussed at 
Section 12.2. The access arrangements, embedded mitigation and package of 
measures are set out at Chapter 3: Project and Site Description. 
iv. Wales Transport Strategy 
12.3.13 The Wales Transport Strategy (WTS) was published in April 2008 (Ref. 12.4). This 
seeks to ensure that transport features strongly in the WG’s policy spectrum: 
 “Getting the most out of our existing transport system; 
 Making greater use of more sustainable modes of travel; and 
 Reducing demands on the transport system.” 
v. Active Travel (Wales) Act 
12.3.14 The Active Travel (Wales) Act came into force in Wales in November 2013 (Ref. 
12.5). The Act makes it a legal requirement for local authorities in Wales to map 
and plan for suitable routes for active travel, and to build and improve their 
infrastructure for walking and cycling every year. It also requires both the WG and 
Local Authorities to promote walking and cycling as a mode of transport. 
12.3.15 The Act is accompanied by a statutory design guidance document, published in 
December 2014, which provides advice on the planning, design, construction and 
maintenance of active travel networks and infrastructure, and is to be used at all 
stages of the process. This is more specifically aimed at residential and 
employment development. 
vi. Guidelines for the Environmental Assessment of Road Traffic 
12.3.16 The Guidelines for the Environmental Assessment of Road Traffic (the IEA 
Guidelines) suggests rules-of-thumb to delimit the scale and the extent of 
assessment (Ref. 12.6). It also identifies numerous receptors for consideration in 
assessment. These rule-of-thumb and receptors are discussed in further detail in 
Section 12.4. 
b) Regional 
 The regional policy and guidance that has been consulted is as follows: 
12.3.17
 Joint Transport Plan for South West Wales 2015-2020, South West Wales 
Integrated Transport Consortium (2015) (Ref. 12.7). 
i. 
Joint Transport Plan South West Wales 2015-2020 
12.3.18 The Joint Transport Plan South West Wales 2015-2020 sets out the vision and 
objectives for transport in the four Local Authorities in South West Wales, namely 
Abergelli ES 2018 – CHAPTER 12: TRAFFIC, TRANSPORT AND ACCESS 
Prepared for:  Abergelli Power Limited  
AECOM 
12-9 
 
Carmarthenshire County Council, Neath Port Talbot County Borough Council, 
Pembrokeshire County Council and the CCS (Ref. 12.7). 
12.3.19 The document references a number of key issues across the South West Wales 
area. This includes “increased congestion on the strategic highway network, 
increasing journey times and reduced journey time reliability for the movement of 
people and goods”. Proposed actions include encouraging travel plan 
development, car sharing and the use of Park and Ride (P&R) sites. 
12.3.20 It provides a short, medium and long term programme of interventions to work 
towards achieving its goals. The short-term programme sets out those schemes 
that are priorities for the next five years up to 2020. The medium and long term 
programme identifies aspirations up to 2030. The medium and long term 
programme lists the ‘Felindre Strategic Business Park Northern Roads 
Improvement’ scheme, described as “improvements to accommodate greater levels 
of traffic generated by new development being established at the Felindre Strategic 
Business Park and a possible large residential development adjacent to it (subject 
to LDP approval)”. This is relevant as the Project Site lies approximately 1.5 km to 
the northwest of this development area. 
c) Local 
 The local policy and guidance that has been consulted is as follows: 
12.3.21
 Unitary Development Plan. City and County of Swansea (2008) (Ref. 12.8); and 
 Local Development Plan 2010-2025: Deposit Plan. City and County of 
Swansea (2016) (Ref. 12.9). 
i. 
Unitary Development Plan 
12.3.22 The Unitary Development Plan (UDP) was adopted in November 2008 (Ref. 12.8). 
It sets out the policies and proposals to guide future development in the CCS up to 
2016. It will remain the current LDP until adoption of the Local Development Plan 
2010-2015. 
12.3.23 Policy EV21 relates to non-residential development in rural areas. Part V states that 
schemes will be permitted where it can be demonstrated it is essential for utilities 
provision. 
 Policy R9 states: 
12.3.24
“The renewal, upgrading or extension of the infrastructure of utility services 
providers will be supported where the development: 
 Contributes towards objectives of economic regeneration or forms part of the 
planned development of a wider network; and 
 Incorporates all reasonable measures to minimise any significant adverse 
impact on the natural heritage, historic environment, health and communities.” 
ii. Local Development Plan 2010-2025: Deposit Plan 
12.3.25 The CCS is currently in the process of developing a new LDP, which, when 
adopted, will replace the existing UDP. The latest LDP document is the Deposit 
Abergelli ES 2018 – CHAPTER 12: TRAFFIC, TRANSPORT AND ACCESS

AECOM 
12-10 
 
Plan, published in July 2016 (Ref. 12.9). Following a period of public consultation, 
this was submitted for independent examination in July 2017. Most policies relate to 
residential and employment developments, but there are some that are relevant to 
the Project, as identified in the following paragraphs. As emerging policy this is not 
yet part of the statutory development plan, and it is likely that it would only be 
afforded limited weight in decision-making.    
12.3.26 Policy IO1 (Supporting Infrastructure) states that “development must be supported 
by appropriate infrastructure, facilities and other requirements considered 
necessary as part of the proposal” and “where there is a deficiency in provision or 
capacity that arrangements are in place to support the development with new or 
improved infrastructure, facilities or other measures.” 
12.3.27 Policy CV2 (Development in the Countryside) states that there is a presumption 
against development in the countryside, except where it is for necessary 
infrastructure provision. 
12.3.28 Policy T1 (Transport Measures and Infrastructure) states “development must be 
supported by appropriate transport measures and infrastructure”. This includes 
ensuring safe and efficient access to the transport network can be achieved and 
that developments are served by appropriate parking provision and circulation 
areas. It concludes by stating that “development that would have an unacceptable 
impact on the safe and efficient operation of the transport network will not be 
permitted”. 
12.3.29 Policy T5 (Design Principles for Transport Measures and Infrastructure) states that 
the design of development together with any supporting transport measures and 
infrastructure must allow for the safe, efficient and effective movement of vehicles. 
12.3.30 Policy T6 (Parking) states that proposals must be served by appropriate parking 
provision, in accordance with maximum parking standards. Where parking cannot 
be provided on-site, provision should be made for alternative transport measures. 
12.3.31 Policy T7 (Public Rights of Way and Recreational Routes) seeks to ensure the 
protection of Public Rights of Way (PRoW) and requires an alternative route to be 
identified and provided where an existing route is adversely affected by a 
development. 
12.4 
Methodology 
a) Scope of the Assessment 
12.4.1 The scope of this assessment has been determined through a formal EIA scoping 
process undertaken with the SoS. Comments raised on the EIA Scoping Report 
have been taken into account in the development of the assessment methodology 
and these are detailed where relevant in this chapter. Full responses to the 
comments raised in the EIA Scoping Opinion can be found in Appendix 4.3, which

Set out in Section 12.10. 
 
c) Study Area 
12.4.4 Access to the Project Site will be from the B4489 approximately 1.7 km from M4 
Junction 46. Traffic will utilise the Access Road to the Substation and Felindre Gas 
Compressor Station and then along a new section of Access Road. The new 
section of Access Road is to be constructed as a permanent feature of the Project 
and would run across agricultural land to the Generating Equipment Site. In the 
2014 PIER the new section of Access Road was proposed to be taken from the 
existing Substation car park (Option A).The 2018 PIER proposed a new section of 
Access Road (Option B), which is described in detail within Chapter 3: Project & 
Site Description. The new section of Access Road will commence around 850 m 
along the Access Road at a point where a junction already exists. The Access Road 
options have been developed in order to avoid disruptive works to the existing 
Substation and to avoid significant earthworks and Ancient Woodland. The current 
proposals are progressing Option B. For the purposes of the assessments, the 
choice of new section of Access Road is not a material concern and does not in any 
way affect the findings or outcomes of the extensive analysis undertaken. The 
Generating Equipment Site is approximately 1.7 km from the B4489 (measured 
along the Access Road and new section of Access Road). 
Abergelli ES 2018 – CHAPTER 12: TRAFFIC, TRANSPORT AND ACCESS 
Prepared for:  Abergelli Power Limited  
AECOM 
12-13 
 
12.4.5 An access point will also be created at the northern extent of the Project Site for the 
AGI (the AGI Access). In travel terms, the AGI Access is located a further 2 km 
north along the B4489 from the Access Road, then 1.6 km east along Rhyd-y-
Pandy Road. Rhyd-y-Pandy Road also serves the Felindre Water Treatment 
Works.  
12.4.6 The transport study area includes the Access Road between the Project Site and 
the B4489 and continues south to incorporate the M4 Junction 46 and the A48/Pant 
Lasau Road junction. The section of the B4489 north of the Access Road and the 
section of Rhyd-y-Pandy Road to the AGI Access is also included. This study area 
was selected to include the necessary junctions and access routes agreed with the 
CCS as part of the consultation process. 
12.4.7 The study area remains constant between the construction, operational and 
decommissioning periods. The study area is shown on Figure 12.1. 
d) Assessment Approach and Scenarios 
i. 
Construction 
12.4.8 For the assessment of the construction period, the methodology has been 
designed to assess the impact of the construction traffic generated by the Project 
against background traffic conditions. 2020 has been identified as the peak year of 
activity for traffic generation during the construction period. The Project is expected 
to be in operation by 2022. 2022 is likely to be the final year of construction and 
therefore represents the year at which background traffic will be highest prior to the 
opening of the Project. Therefore, to ensure a ‘worst case’ assessment, 2022 has 
been selected as the future assessment year and compounded with the peak 
construction traffic activity from 2020. The following scenarios have been assessed: 
 2017 Base Year (for establishing the existing conditions); 
 2022 Baseline (for establishing the future conditions); 
 2022 Baseline + Power Generation Plant Construction Traffic (for establishing 
the future conditions with the addition of the Power Generation Plant 
construction traffic); 
 2022 Baseline + Gas Connection Construction Traffic (for establishing the 
future conditions with the addition of the Gas Connection construction traffic); 
 2022 Baseline + Electrical Connection Construction Traffic (for establishing the 
future conditions with the addition of the Electrical Connection construction 
traffic); and 
 2022 Baseline + Project Construction Traffic (for establishing the future 
conditions with the addition of the Project construction traffic). 
12.4.9 Information relating to existing traffic patterns on local roads was obtained through 
commissioned traffic surveys undertaken in October 2014. 
12.4.10 In order to estimate future growth in traffic flows, traffic growth factors have been 
obtained from TEMPro. The TEMPro program is based on the National Trip End 
Model (Dataset 7.2) and takes into account changes in car ownership and local 
planning forecasts regarding housing and employment. 
Abergelli ES 2018 – CHAPTER 12: TRAFFIC, TRANSPORT AND ACCESS 
Prepared for:  Abergelli Power Limited  
AECOM 
12-14 
 
12.4.11 The forecast has been based on a ‘rural’ road in the ‘Swansea 004’ TEMPro zone. 
An average of the factors for the ‘motorway’, ‘trunk’ and ‘principal’ road types has 
been taken, consistent with the road types in the study area. The factors have been 
derived for growth from 2014, as this was the year in which the traffic data was 
collected. The factors are set out in Table 12-3.

12.4.12 The traffic generated by the Project during the construction period has been 
quantified using contractor estimates of the resources required and refined using 
calculations based on available information. Construction traffic will be associated 
with both the construction staff working on the Project Site (travelling in cars and 
vans) and the delivery of materials (by HGVs). There will also be a requirement for 
abnormal deliveries; these will be very few in number and managed outside of 
normal working hours. More information on abnormal loads is provided in Section 
12.7. From this, an approximate construction programme has been developed and 
used to estimate the peak traffic generated. The traffic generation has been 
calculated based on the following assumptions: 
 All construction staff will arrive at and depart the Project Site in private cars or 
vans at average vehicle occupancy of 1.6 (this value was agreed with the CCS 
as part of previous assessment work). Due to the limitations of public transport 
provision, no staff are expected to arrive or depart by public transport. The 
contractor will be responsible for implementing a CSTP to encourage car 
sharing amongst staff; 
 All imports and exports of materials required for construction will be via HGVs. 
 The assessment of construction has included weekdays only as the base levels 
of traffic were surveyed and were shown to be higher on a weekday than a 
Saturday. Saturdays have therefore not been considered in this assessment as 
weekdays present the worst case. The core working hours during construction 
are between 08:00 and 18:00hrs (Monday to Friday) and 08:00 and 13:00hrs 
(Saturdays and Bank Holidays); 
 All construction staff will arrive and depart during the peak hours to ensure a 
robust worst case assessment. Therefore, all staff are assumed to arrive 
between 07:45 and 08:45hrs, and depart between 16:30 and 17:30hrs. 
Temporary parking spaces for staff will be made available within the Laydown 
Area during construction of the new Access Road. No construction staff 
vehicles will be parked on any of the public roads surrounding the Project Site 
at any time; 
Abergelli ES 2018 – CHAPTER 12: TRAFFIC, TRANSPORT AND ACCESS 
Prepared for:  Abergelli Power Limited  
AECOM 
12-15 
 
 For all imports, HGVs will arrive full and depart empty. For all exports, HGVs 
will arrive empty and depart full. This will ensure a robust worst case 
assessment. However, it is likely to be the case that HGV usage will be more 
efficiently optimised to ensure that HGVs arrive and depart with a full load to 
reduce the total number of trips on the network; and 
 The import and export of materials to and from the Project Site will occur 
throughout the duration of the site’s operational hours. At this stage, it is not 
possible to estimate groupings of deliveries and therefore a flat profile of 
deliveries has been assumed throughout the day. 
12.4.13 There are two peaks, one associated with construction staff and one associated 
with the delivery of materials. These will occur at different times in the construction 
period. In this assessment the two peaks have been assessed together, i.e. 
compounded to ensure a robust worst case assessment in the event of any 
changes to the construction programme. The assessment considers the likely 
transport effects during the weekday AM and PM peak hours, and for the weekday 
24-hour period. The peak hours have been determined as 07:45-08:45hrs and 
16:30-17:30hrs respectively from the traffic survey information. 
ii. Operation and Maintenance 
12.4.14 The impacts of the operational period have not been assessed to the same extent 
as the construction period as the traffic generation will be relatively minor compared 
to the construction period, with the increases in traffic well within both rules-of-
thumb identified in the IEA Guidelines (see paragraph 12.3.16) (Ref. 12.6); these 
are discussed at paragraph 12.4.16. 
iii. Decommissioning 
12.4.15 Traffic forecasts for the decommissioning phase are not available, but are likely to 
be of a similar level to that generated during the construction period. However, 
traffic growth forecasts are not available to assess as far in the future as 
decommissioning (25 years after opening). Therefore, the impact has been 
assessed, in detail, only in terms of the traffic generated during the construction 
period. 
e) Determining the Significance of Effect 
12.4.16 The assessment has been based upon the Institute of Environmental Assessment’s 
Guidelines for the Environmental Assessment of Road Traffic (the IEA Guidelines). 
The IEA Guidelines suggest in paragraph 3.15 that two broad rules-of-thumb be 
used as a screening process to delimit the scale and extent of the assessment. 
These are: 
 “Rule 1 include highway links where traffic flows will increase by more than 
30% (or the number of heavy goods vehicles will increase by more than 30%). 
 Rule 2 include any other specifically sensitive areas where traffic flows have 
increased by 10% or more.” (Ref. 12.6) 
12.4.17 These rules-of-thumb form the starting point for the assessment of effects. 
Specifically sensitive areas under Rule 2 include accident black-spots, conservation 
areas, hospitals and links with high pedestrian flows. 
Abergelli ES 2018 – CHAPTER 12: TRAFFIC, TRANSPORT AND ACCESS 
Prepared for:  Abergelli Power Limited  
AECOM 
12-16 
 
12.4.18 The significance of the effects of the Project have been considered in respect of the 
following receptors based on the IEA Guidelines: 
 Severance; 
 Driver delay; 
 Pedestrian delay; 
 Pedestrian amenity; 
 Fear and intimidation; and 
 Accidents and safety. 
12.4.19 For many receptors, the IEA Guidelines do not contain simple rules or formulae 
which define the thresholds of significance. Therefore, there is a need to exercise 
professional judgement in determining the degree of the effect and whether or not 
an improvement is required and, if required, what the improvement should 
comprise. The following tables have been developed in this manner. 
i. 
Severance, Pedestrian Delay, Pedestrian Amenity, Fear and Intimidation 
12.4.20 Receptors relating to severance, pedestrian delay, pedestrian amenity, and fear 
and intimidation are associated primarily with the pedestrian experience. The 
criteria for the sensitivity of these receptors and magnitude of change have been 
developed based on changes in the volume and composition of traffic. An increase 
in traffic volumes and HGV composition can result in difficulties for pedestrians 
when crossing roads and affect the pleasantness of journeys. The criteria for 
assessment are set out in Table 12-4. 
Table 12-4: Receptor Sensitivity and Magnitude of Change Criteria – Severance, Pedestrian Delay, 
Pedestrian Amenity, Fear and Intimidation 
Sensitivity 
Criteria 
Very Low 
Traffic flows of less than 100 vehicles per hour or HGV flow of 
less than 100 HGVs per day. 
Low 
Traffic flows of between 100 and less than 1,000 vehicles per 
hour or HGV flow of between 100 and less than 1,000 HGVs per 
day. 
Medium 
Traffic flows of between 1,000 vehicles and less than 2,000 
vehicles per hour or HGV flow of between 1,000 and less than 
2,000 HGVs per day. 
High 
Traffic flows of 2,000 vehicles and greater per hour or HGV flow 
of 2,000 HGVs and greater per day. 
Magnitude 
Criteria 
Very Low 
Changes in traffic flows/HGV flow of between 1% and less than

Medium 
Changes in traffic flows/HGV flow of between 60% and less than 
90%. 
High 
Change in traffic flows/HGV flow of 90% and greater.

12.4.21 The significance of effects for these receptors have also been assessed in 
qualitative terms in the context of existing pedestrian infrastructure, including the 
quality of footways, presence of street lighting and availability and type of crossing 
facilities. 
12.4.22 In respect of PRoW, it is considered inappropriate to use this criteria given the 
existing PRoW in the vicinity of the Project Site are not adjacent to the carriageway. 
As will be discussed at Section 12.5.19, there are PRoW that cross the Project Site 
and, in view of the negligible existing traffic movements at these locations, it is 
considered appropriate to use a qualitative assessment criteria, as set out in Table 
12-5.

Little or no hindrance to pedestrian movement. 
Low 
All people wishing to make pedestrian movements will be able to 
do so, but there will be some hindrance to movement. 
Medium 
Some people, particularly vulnerable user groups, are likely to 
be deterred from making journeys on foot. For others, pedestrian 
journeys will be longer or less attractive. 
High 
People are likely to be deterred from making pedestrian journeys 
to an extent sufficient to induce a reorganisation of their 
activities. Those who do make journeys on foot will experience 
considerable hindrance. 
ii. Driver Delay 
12.4.23 Changes in levels of delay at junctions have been used in the assessment of driver 
delay. The criteria for sensitivity of receptor and magnitude of change are set out in 
Table 12-6. 
 
 
Abergelli ES 2018 – CHAPTER 12: TRAFFIC, TRANSPORT AND ACCESS 
Prepared for:  Abergelli Power Limited

Table 12-6: Receptor Sensitivity and Magnitude of Change Criteria – Driver Delay 
Sensitivity 
Criteria 
Very Low 
Junction delay of less than 10 seconds per vehicle. 
Low 
Junction delay of between 10 seconds and less than 30 seconds 
per vehicle. 
Medium 
Junction delay of between 30 seconds and less than 60 seconds 
per vehicle. 
High 
Junction delay greater of 60 seconds and greater per vehicle. 
Magnitude 
Criteria 
Very Low 
Change in junction delay per vehicle of between 1% and less 
than 30%. 
Low 
Change in junction delay per vehicle of between 30% and less 
than 60%. 
Medium 
Change in junction delay per vehicle of between 60% and less 
than 90%. 
High 
Change in junction delay per vehicle of 90% and greater. 
12.4.24 The level of driver delay is derived from the capacity assessment of junctions in the 
study area network. The capacity assessment has been undertaken using the 
Transport Research Laboratories (TRL) software program ‘Junctions 9’. This 
summarises the performance for all movements/approach arms in terms of their 
ratio of flow to capacity (RFC), queues in vehicles and delay in seconds per 
vehicle. Delay is the key measurement for this receptor. 
iii. Accidents and Safety 
12.4.25 The number of collisions on a road is an indicator of the current road safety 
conditions. An analysis of Personal Injury Collision (PIC) data has been undertaken 
over a three year period to identify whether there are any locations within the study 
area where there is an existing safety issue. Where an issue has been identified, a 
qualitative assessment has been undertaken to ascertain the likelihood that the 
Project will lead to further deterioration in safety. 
iv. Interaction of Magnitude of Change and Sensitivity of Receptor 
12.4.26 Effects on receptors can be beneficial, adverse or negligible, and of minor, 
moderate or major significance. The significance criteria are derived from the 
interaction of receptor sensitivity and magnitude of change of effect. A matrix of 
magnitude of change and sensitivity of receptor is set out in Table 12-7, and in 
Chapter 4: Approach to Environmental Impact Assessment. Major and 
moderate effects are considered significant, and minor and negligible effects are 
considered not significant.

Baseline Environment 
12.5.1 This section describes the baseline environmental characteristics for the Project 
and surrounding areas with specific reference to transport. 
a) Project Site Description and Context 
12.5.2 The Project Site is currently used for agricultural purposes (sheep and horse 
grazing). The western extent of the Project Site includes parts of the Substation 
and the Access Road from the B4489 that serves the Substation and Felindre Gas 
Compressor Station. The level of traffic generation associated with the agricultural 
activities and maintenance visits to the Substation and Felindre Gas Compressor 
Station is immaterial and likely to be accommodated in the daily variation of traffic 
flows. 
b) Data Collection 
12.5.3 In order to determine the baseline conditions in the study area, data was collected 
from numerous sources, as summarised in Table 12-8.

Local Highway Network 
 The local highway network is shown on Figure 12.2. 
12.5.5
12.5.6 The Project Site is served by a privately maintained Access Road from the B4489. 
The Access Road is unlit. The width of the Access Road varies along its length 
between 3.5 m and 7.5 m, and is generally bordered by trees and intermittent 
hedgerows. The Access Road connects to the B4489 via a simple priority junction. 
This is characterised by large radii on the minor arm (the Access Road) to 
accommodate HGV movements. 
12.5.7 The B4489 routes between the village of Felindre to the north (approximately 2.3 
km from the Access Road) and the M4 Junction 46 to the south (approximately 1.8 
km from the Access Road). The B4489 is subject to a 40 mph speed limit at its 
junction with the Access Road. At this location, the road has a 5.5 m wide 
carriageway and is unlit. Approximately 330 m to the north of the Access Road, the 
B4489 becomes subject to the national speed limit. The B4489 continues a further 
1.7 km north where it connects to Rhyd-y-Pandy Road at a priority junction. This 
section of the B4489 is unlit and ranges in width between 4.5 m and 5.5 m, with 
numerous passing places. The junction with Rhyd-y-Pandy Road and its 
approaches are subject to a 30 mph speed limit. Rhyd-y-Pandy Road routes east 
for 1.6 km where it passes the northern extent of the Project Boundary. This section 
of Rhyd-y-Pandy Road is unlit and ranges in width between 4.5 m and 5.5 m, with 
numerous passing places. It is subject to a 30 mph speed limit, increasing to the 
national speed limit around 900 m east of its junction with the B4489. It also serves 
the Felindre Water Treatment Works. 
12.5.8 Approximately 475 m to the south of the Access Road, the B4489 is street lit. A 
further 75 m south from this point, the B4489 forms a three-arm roundabout with 
the access to the Felindre Park and Share. 
12.5.9 The B4489 forms a dumbbell roundabout with the M4 Junction 46. The northern 
dumbbell roundabout junction comprises three arms; the B4489 and the eastbound 
on/off-slips of the M4. The southern dumbbell roundabout junction comprises six 
arms; the A48 (three arms), the B4489 Swansea Road, and the westbound on/off-
slips of the M4. The south-eastern arm of the A48 forms a mini-roundabout junction 
with Pant Lasau Road approximately 90 m southeast of the southern dumbbell 
roundabout. These junctions are subject to a 40 mph speed limit and are lit. 
ii. Highway Operational Conditions 
12.5.10 An Automatic Traffic Count (ATC) survey was undertaken on the B4489 between 
the Access Road and the roundabout junction with the Felindre Park and Share. 
The survey was undertaken between Thursday 16th October 2014 and Wednesday 
22nd October 2014. The traffic flow information for an average weekday is 
summarised in Table 12-9. Growth factors have been applied to the 2014 data to 
represent conditions in 2017.

traffic. 
12.5.12 Junction Turning Count (JTC) surveys were also undertaken on Thursday 16th 
October 2014 at the following junctions in the study area network: 
 M4 Junction 46 Northern Dumbell Roundabout; 
 M4 Junction 46 Southern Dumbell Roundabout; and 
 A48/Pant Lasau Road Mini-Roundabout. 
12.5.13 The traffic survey data is reproduced in Appendix 12.1. The 2014 traffic flows at the 
surveyed locations during the weekday AM and PM peak hours are shown on 
Figures 12.3 and 12.4 respectively. Growth factors have been applied to represent 
traffic flows in 2017, as shown on Figures 12.5 and 12.6 respectively. 
12.5.14 The surveyed junctions have been modelled using the TRL software program 
‘Junctions 9’. They have been modelled as a linked network in view of their 
proximity to each other. This has required the use of the lane simulation tool, which 
only provides outputs for queuing and delay. The capacity assessment results for 
2017 during the weekday AM and PM peak hours are summarised in Table 12-10. 
These are shown for the entry arms to the network (listed clockwise from the 
northern arm of the B4489) and exclude the internal links. The capacity 
assessment output reports are reproduced in Appendix 12.2.

12.5.15 Table 12-10 shows that, during the AM peak hour, the highest levels of queuing and 
delay are experienced on the M4 eastbound and westbound off-slips, followed by 
the A48 (Southwest) and B4489 (South). During the PM peak hour, levels of 
queuing and delay are significantly lower across the junction, with Pant Lasau 
Road and the A48 (Southeast) experiencing the highest levels of queuing and 
delay. 
12.5.16 On-site observations carried out by AECOM during the AM peak hour on Tuesday 
21st November 2017 suggests that the M4 Junction 46 is operating well within 
capacity. At the time of the observational visit, it was apparent that the queues 
reported by the modelling were not present at that time. This is particularly the case 
for the M4 off-slips, which appeared to be free flowing or with minimal queuing. The 
modelling is therefore considered to represent a ‘worst-case’ of existing conditions 
at the junctions. 
12.5.17 The analyses is carried out as part of this chapter will be based upon the previously 
observed traffic flows and queues and will therefore be a robust assessment of this 
part of the network. 
iii. Road Safety 
12.5.18 A review of PIC data has been undertaken to determine whether there are any 
locations on the local highway network with poor collision records. 
12.5.19 The data was obtained from CCS for the three-year period from 1st October 2014 to 
30th September 2017 (the most recent three-year period for which data was 
available). The reports for each of the PICs recorded in the study area together with 
a plan showing the location of each PIC (these are not included in this ES for data 
protection reasons). 
12.5.20 A total of 25 PICs were recorded in study area over the three-year period, of which 
three were ‘serious’. The remaining 22 PICs were all ‘slight’. No ‘fatal’ PICs were 
recorded in the study area. For ease of analysis the PICs have been separated into 
those occurring at junctions and on links in the study area. The following account of 
the events which led to a PIC was taken from the records provided. 
Abergelli ES 2018 – CHAPTER 12: TRAFFIC, TRANSPORT AND ACCESS 
Prepared for:  Abergelli Power Limited  
AECOM 
12-23 
 
PICs at Junctions 
12.5.21 One ‘slight’ PIC was recorded at the M4 Junction 46 Northern Dumbbell 
Roundabout. This involved a collision between a vehicle entering the roundabout 
and a vehicle already on the roundabout. 
12.5.22 Four ‘slight’ PICs were recorded at the A48/Pant Lasau Road Mini-Roundabout. 
These all involved a collision between a vehicle entering the mini-roundabout and a 
vehicle already on the roundabout. These types of collisions are not uncommon on 
mini-roundabouts, due to the limited separation between entry arms. Further 
analysis has been undertaken of the listed causation factors for the PICs (these 
cannot be explicitly stated here for data protection reasons); this has not identified 
any highway defects contributing to these PICs. 
12.5.23 One ‘serious’ PIC was recorded at the M4 Junction 46 Southern Dumbbell 
Roundabout. This involved a vehicle on the M4 westbound off-slip losing control 
and colliding with a tree on the central roundabout island. 
PICs Recorded on Links 
12.5.24 One ‘slight’ PIC was recorded on the B4489, south of its junction with Rhyd-y-
pandy Road. This involved a collision between two vehicles on a bend; one vehicle 
was travelling northbound, and the other vehicle was travelling southbound. 
12.5.25 Three ‘slight’ PICs were recorded on the M4 eastbound, between the off and on 
slips of the M4 Junction 46. Two of these PICs involved vehicles losing control, and 
the remaining PIC involved a rear-end shunt collision. 
12.5.26 Two ‘slight’ PICs were recorded on the M4 eastbound, east of the M4 Junction 46, 
both of which involved rear-end shunt collisions. 
12.5.27 Two ‘slight’ PICs were recorded on the M4 westbound, east of the M4 Junction 46. 
These involved a rear-end shunt collision, and a collision between two vehicles as 
one vehicle was changing lanes. 
12.5.28 One ‘slight’ PIC was recorded on the M4 westbound off-slip. This involved a vehicle 
losing control and leaving the carriageway. 
12.5.29 Three ‘PICs’ were recorded on the M4 westbound, between the off and on slips of 
the M4 Junction 46. The ‘serious’ PIC involved a vehicle losing control after 
entering the drainage system. The ‘slight’ PICs involved a rear-end shunt collision, 
and a vehicle losing control and colliding with the central barrier. 
12.5.30 One ‘slight’ PIC was recorded on the M4 eastbound, west of the M4 Junction 46. 
This involved a rear-end shunt collision. 
12.5.31 Two ‘slight’ PICs were recorded on the M4 eastbound off-slip. One of the PICs 
involved a vehicle losing control, colliding with the barrier and overturning. No 
description was provided for the remaining PIC. 
12.5.32 One ‘slight’ PIC was recorded on the A48 between the M4 Junction 46 Southern 
Dumbbell Roundabout and the A48/Pant Lasau Road Mini-Roundabout. This 
Abergelli ES 2018 – CHAPTER 12: TRAFFIC, TRANSPORT AND ACCESS 
Prepared for:  Abergelli Power Limited  
AECOM 
12-24 
 
involved a vehicle travelling southeast-bound entering the opposite side of the 
carriageway and colliding with an oncoming vehicle. 
12.5.33 One ‘serious’ PIC was recorded on Pant Lasau Road, northeast of the A48/Pant 
Lasau Road Mini-Roundabout. This involved a collision between a vehicle and a 
pedestrian that had entered the carriageway. 
12.5.34 One ‘slight’ PIC was recorded on the A48, southeast of the A48/Pant Lasau Road 
Mini-Roundabout. This involved a collision between a vehicle performing a u-turn 
and another vehicle. 
12.5.35 One ‘slight’ PIC was recorded on the A48, southwest of the M4 Junction 46. This 
involved a collision between a vehicle pulling off from the side of the carriageway 
and a vehicle travelling southwest-bound. 
Summary 
12.5.36 Overall, the analysis of the PIC data and listed causation factors has not identified 
any existing highway safety issues in the study area. Where PICs have been 
recorded, these have been identified as being as a result of causation factors 
relating to driver/road user error and weather conditions. No causation factors 
relating to highway defects have been reported in the PIC data. 
iv. Walking and Cycling 
 The walking and cycling facilities and PRoW are shown on Figure 12.7. 
12.5.37
12.5.38 There are no footways that serve the Project Site. The nearest footways are on the 
B4489, approximately 475m south of the Access Road (on the approach to the 
junction with the Felindre Park and Share. This footway continues to the M4 
Junction 46. The 500 m section of the footway to the north of the M4 Junction 46 is 
separated from the carriageway edge by a barrier. At the M4 Junction 46 the 
footways continues south along the east side of the carriageway, serving the 
southern arms of the southern dumbbell roundabout, with dropped kerbs and tactile 
paving to facilitate crossing movements across entry arms. 
12.5.39 There are no formal cycling routes in the vicinity of the Project Site. Part of the 
B4489 is identified as an ‘advisory cycling route’ on the CCS’s cycle map. This 
covers the section of the B4489 that routes north from the Access Road to Felindre 
and to a point approximately 475 m south of the Access Road. Due to distance 
from the Project Site, no assessment of cycle routes has therefore been 
undertaken in this chapter to cycle routes, although is discussed in Chapter 16: 
Socio-economics. 
12.5.40 There are numerous PRoW crossing/in the vicinity of the Project Site. Footpaths 
LC34 and LC117 cross the Access Road (and the new section of Access Road) at 
points approximately 350 m and 1.3 km from the B4489. Footpath LC35B passes 
through the northern part of the Project Site, connecting to Rhyd-y-Pandy Road to 
in the vicinity of the AGI Access.

v. Public Transport 
12.5.41 The nearest bus stop to the Project Site is the ‘Lliw Reservoirs’ stop located on 
Rhyd-y-pandy Road. This is situated to the east of Felindre and approximately 500 
m to the northwest of the northern extent of the Project Site boundary. There is no 
footway between the Project Site and this bus stop. It provides access to Service 
142, which routes between Morriston and Garnswllt. This service is operated by 
DANSA, a community transport organisation. There are three to four services per 
day in each direction, although these can generally only be pre-booked. 
12.5.42 Service 141 passes to the south of the Project Site, routeing between Gorseinon 
and Morriston. The nearest stop that provides access to this service is the ‘Pant 
Lasau Cross’ stop located on Mynydd Gelli Wastad Road. It is situated 
approximately 750 m to the southeast of the southern extent of the Project Site 
boundary and can be accessed via Footpath LC117. 
12.5.43 There are no railway stations in the vicinity of the Project Site. Llansamlet railway 
station is situated approximately 5.5 km southeast of the Project Site, accessible by 
car via the A48 (from M4 Junction 44 and 46). Swansea railway station is a further 
7 km from the Project Site; this is a key local transport hub and is more easily 
accessible by public transport. Swansea railway station is managed by Arriva 
Trains Wales. There are four services daily from Swansea to Shrewsbury; an hourly 
service from Swansea to Manchester Piccadilly, which calls at Cardiff Central; and 
a total of two to three services hourly from Swansea to Cardiff Central. Great 
Western Railway also provides services from Swansea to London Paddington, 
calling at Bristol Parkway. 
12.5.44 Overall, the opportunities to access the Project Site by public transport are limited, 
and it is therefore considered that, for the purposes of this assessment, no trips by 
construction, maintenance and permanent staff will be undertaken by these modes. 
vi. Parking 
12.5.45 Felindre Park and Share is accessed from the B4489, approximately 550 m south 
of the Access Road. It is located on the site of the proposed Felindre Business 
Park. It has capacity for 480 spaces and its use is encouraged for employees of the 
Driver and Vehicle Licensing Agency (DVLA) Headquarters HQ in Clase. A shuttle 
bus service runs between the Felindre Park and Share and the DVLA. There are no 
other parking facilities in the study area. The Felindre Park and Share is 
understood to be managed by the DVLA and will not be available for use by the 
Project. 
12.6 
Embedded Mitigation 
12.6.1 As detailed in Chapter 3: Project and Site Description, a number of embedded 
mitigation measures have been identified through the iterative EIA process and 
have been incorporated into the design and construction planning of the Project. 
12.6.2 As these mitigation measures have been embedded into the design, are legal 
requirements or are standard practices that will be implemented, the assessment of 
likely significant effects assumes that they are in place.

Assessment of Effects 
12.7.1 This section presents the findings of the TA for the construction, operation and 
maintenance and decommissioning phases of the Project. 
12.7.2 This section also identifies any likely significant effects that are predicted to occur 
and Section 12.8 highlights the additional mitigation and monitoring measures that 
are proposed to reduce or eliminate the identified significant effects. 
a) 
Construction  
i. 
Traffic Generation 
Power Generation Plant 
12.7.3 The construction of the Power Generation Plant is estimated to take 22 months. 
The new section of Access Road will be constructed as part of the Power 
Generation Plant and is expected to take around six months. To ensure a robust 
assessment, the peaks in construction staff traffic and HGV traffic have been 
assessed together against the background traffic. The traffic generation for these 
peaks are shown for the weekday AM and PM peak hours and 24-hour period in 
Table 12-11. On average, it is forecast that it will generate around 80 HGV 
movements and around 140 light vehicle movements per day.

12.7.4 The traffic generation consists of tankers transporting foul effluent and water, 
delivery of materials and the export of waste/excavated materials not suitable for 
use on site (it is assumed that all excavated material will be unsuitable for re-use to 
represent the worst case). 
12.7.5 There will also be a requirement to transport some abnormal loads. The shape and 
scale of these loads will be refined as the construction process develops in more 
detail. At this stage in the assessments we have taken instruction from the current 
design and from previous experience from within the Applicant team. There are 
expected to be two abnormal loads; these are likely to be around 5m in width, 
potentially 6.5 m in height and up to around 50 m in length. The total vehicle weight 
could be up to 400 tonnes per vehicle. The new section of Access Road has been 
Abergelli ES 2018 – CHAPTER 12: TRAFFIC, TRANSPORT AND ACCESS 
Prepared for:  Abergelli Power Limited  
AECOM 
12-27 
 
designed to accommodate these vehicles, and provision will made along the 
Access Road through widening as appropriate. These loads will be travelling with a 
full complement of technical operators, mobile safety entourage and police escort. 
It is assumed that the heavy and large equipment will arrive via water transport to 
either Swansea or Port Talbot Docks. The route to the Project Site will be confined 
to the strategic highway network wherever possible and will take as direct a route 
as available given the local circumstances. The pre planning and lead up time 
required for the transportation of such loads will ensure that all appropriate 
measures are in place and relevant authorities are notified. 
Gas Connection 
12.7.6 The construction of the Gas Connection is expected to take place alongside and 
within the period of the construction of the Power Generation Plant. The peaks in 
construction staff traffic and HGV traffic are shown for the weekday AM and PM 
peak hours and 24-hour period in Table 12-12. This includes traffic associated with 
the construction of the AGI.

Project 
12.7.8 The traffic generation of the Power Generation Plant, Gas Connection and 
Electrical Connection has been combined to enable an assessment of the Project, 
as shown in Table 12-14. This ensures a robust assessment as it combines the 
peaks in construction staff traffic and HGV traffic of each component of the Project; 
in reality, the construction programme is such that these peaks will not coincide.

ii. Traffic Flows 
12.7.9 Growth factors have been applied to the observed traffic flows in the study area 
network to represent the traffic flow conditions on the study area network in 2022 
(the ‘2022 Baseline’ assessment scenario). These are shown for the weekday AM 
and PM peak hours on Figures 12.8 and 12.9 respectively. 
12.7.10 The construction traffic flows generated by the individual Project components and 
the full Project have been applied to the study area network. It is assumed that all 
construction staff trips will route to/from the M4 Junction 46, where it has been 
distributed based on observed turning proportions. All HGV traffic will route to/from 
the M4, where it has been distributed equally between the eastbound and 
westbound movements. These routeing arrangements will maximise the efficiency 
of movements to/from the Project Site given its proximity to the strategic highway 
network, and therefore minimise the effect of the Project on the wider highway 
network. The construction traffic forecasts for the Gas Connection include traffic 
associated with the AGI. Construction traffic associated with the AGI will follow the 
same routeing arrangements, but will continue north along the B4489 and then east 
along Rhyd-y-Pandy Road. This is considered the optimum route to the AGI Access 
Abergelli ES 2018 – CHAPTER 12: TRAFFIC, TRANSPORT AND ACCESS 
Prepared for:  Abergelli Power Limited  
AECOM 
12-29 
 
both in terms of distance and minimising disruption to local communities. These 
routeing arrangements form part of the CTMP.  
12.7.11 Although some traffic associated with the Gas Connection will enter the Project Site 
via the Access Road and new section of Access Road, to ensure a robust 
assessment of the B4489 and Rhyd-y-Pandy Road it has been assumed that all 
traffic associated with the Gas Connection will route to/from the AGI Access. 
12.7.12 The resulting construction traffic flows on the study area network during the 
weekday AM and PM peak hours are shown on the following figures: 
 Power Generation Plant Construction Traffic – Figures 12.10 and 12.11; 
 Gas Connection Construction Traffic – Figures 12.12 and 12.13; 
 Electrical Connection Construction Traffic – Figures 12.14 and 12.15; 
 Project Construction Traffic – Figures 12.16 and 12.17. 
12.7.13 These have been added to the ‘2022 Baseline’ traffic flows to derive the traffic flows 
for the following scenarios: 
 2022 Baseline + Power Generation Plant Construction Traffic – see Figures 
12.18 and 12.19; 
 2022 Baseline + Gas Connection Construction Traffic – see Figures 12.20 and 
12.21; 
 2022 Baseline + Electrical Connection Construction Traffic – see Figures 12.22 
and 12.23; and 
 2022 Baseline + Project Construction Traffic – see Figures 12.24 and 12.25. 
iii. Severance, Pedestrian Delay, Pedestrian Amenity, Fear and Intimidation – 
Traffic Flows 
12.7.14 The assessment of severance, pedestrian delay, pedestrian amenity, and fear and 
intimidation has primarily been based on changes in traffic flows on the study area 
network. The key links are as follows: 
 Link 1 – Rhyd-y-Pandy Road, between the AGI Access and the B4489; 
 Link 2 – B4489, between Rhyd-y-Pandy Road and the Access Road; 
 Link 3 – B4489, between the Access Road and the Felindre Park and Share; 
 Link 4 – B4489, between the Felindre Park and Share and the M4 Junction 46; 
 Link 5 – M4 eastbound on-slip; 
 Link 6 – A48, between the northern and southern dumbbell roundabouts of the 
M4 Junction 46; 
 Link 7 – M4 westbound off-slip; 
 Link 8 – A48, between the M4 Junction 46 and the A48/Pant Lasau Road mini-
roundabout; 
 Link 9 – Pant Lasau Road; 
 Link 10 – A48, southeast of the A48/Pant Lasau mini-roundabout; 
 Link 11 – B4489, south of the M4 Junction 46; and 
 Link 12 – A48, southwest of the M4 Junction 46. 
12.7.15 These links have been identified with reference to the location of existing 
pedestrian infrastructure, i.e. where existing pedestrian movements can reasonably 
be expected to occur. 
Abergelli ES 2018 – CHAPTER 12: TRAFFIC, TRANSPORT AND ACCESS 
Prepared for:  Abergelli Power Limited

12-30 
 
12.7.16 An assessment has been undertaken of the individual Project components and the 
full Project in respect of changes in two-way total link flows during the weekday AM 
and PM peak hours, and changes in two-way HGV traffic flows over the weekday 
24-hour period. Traffic flows are presented in the following sub-sections for 2022 
both without and with the individual Project components/full Project, the difference 
between the two and the percentage change. For each link, the significance of 
effect has been determined with reference to the magnitude of change and 
sensitivity of the link. 
12.7.17 In terms of HGV traffic flows, data for the existing weekday 24-hour period is only 
available for Link 2, (B4489, between Rhyd-y-Pandy Road and the Access Road), 
Link 3 (B4489, between the Access Road and the Felindre Park and Share) and 
Link 4 (B4489, between the Felindre Park and Share and the M4 Junction 46).  
Power Generation Plant 
12.7.18 Tables 12-15 and 12-16 show the two-way total link flows during the weekday AM 
and PM peak hours respectively for the ‘2022 Baseline’ and ‘2022 Baseline + 
Power Generation Plant Construction Traffic’ scenarios, the difference between the 
two and the percentage change.

12.7.19 Tables 12-15 and 12-16 show that, in terms of total traffic flows, Links 3, 6, 8, 9, 10 
and 11 will experience a Minor adverse effect during the AM peak hour. Links 3, 4, 
6, 8, 10 and 11 will experience a Minor adverse effect during the PM peak hour. 
The routeing arrangements for the Power Generation Plant will not involve the use

of Links 1 and 2, and therefore the effect will be Negligible. All other links will 
experience a Negligible effect. 
12.7.20 Table 12-17 shows the two-way HGV link flows during the weekday 24-hour period 
in 2022 both without and with the Power Generation Plant construction traffic, the

12.7.21 Table 12-17 shows that Link 2 will experience a Negligible effect, and Links 3 and 
4 will experience a Minor adverse effect. No pedestrian movements have been 
observed on Link 3; there is no footway along the majority of this link and no key 
destinations that pedestrians are likely to travel to. There is a short section of 
footway at the southern end of the link, which serves the Access Road that serves 
Bryn Whilach Farm. The footway is approximately 2m wide and is of sufficient width 
to accommodate the limited pedestrian movements at this location. Minimal 
pedestrian movement has been observed on Link 4. There is a 2m wide footway 
along the entirety of this link, which is separated from the carriageway edge along 
much of its length by a barrier. The area is also street lit.  
12.7.22 The other links in the study area on which the Power Generation Plant construction 
traffic will result in an increase in HGV traffic movements are Links 5 (M4 
eastbound on-slip), 6 (A48, between the northern and southern dumbbell 
roundabouts of the M4 Junction 46) and 7 (M4 westbound off-slip), associated with 
movements to/from the M4. These links are part of the strategic highway network 
and are designed to carry high volumes of HGV traffic. Whilst the increase in HGV 
traffic from the Power Generation Plant will result in a deterioration of the 
pedestrian experience, minimal pedestrian movement has been observed at these 
locations, which is typical given the nature of the strategic access junction. It is also 
likely that any pedestrians at these locations will already be accustomed to the 
levels of general traffic and HGVs. 
Gas Connection 
12.7.23 Tables 12-18 and 12-19 show the two-way total link flows (all vehicles) during the 
weekday AM and PM peak hours respectively for the ‘2022 Baseline’ and ‘2022 
Baseline + Gas Connection Construction Traffic’ scenarios, the difference between 
the two and the percentage change.

12.7.24 Tables 12-18 and 12-19 show that, in terms of total traffic flows, all links will 
experience a Negligible effect during the AM and PM peak hours. It is not possible 
to determine the magnitude of change and sensitivity of Link 1 given the absence 
of existing traffic data. However, it considered that the effect of an increase in traffic 
of only six vehicle movements in both the AM and PM peak hours will be 
Negligible.

12.7.26 Table 12-20 shows that Links 2, 3 and 4 will experience a Negligible effect. Again, 
it is not possible to determine the magnitude of change and sensitivity of Link 1 
given the absence of existing traffic data. However, it considered that the effect of 
an increase of only four HGV movements over the 24-hour period will be 
Negligible. The other links in the study area on which the Gas Connection 
construction traffic will result in an increase in HGV traffic movements are Links 5 
(M4 eastbound on-slip), 6 (A48, between the northern and southern dumbbell 
roundabouts of the M4 Junction 46) and 7 (M4 westbound off-slip), associated with

and are designed to carry high volumes of HGV traffic. The level of increase in 
HGV traffic associated with the Gas Connection will have a Negligible effect on the

12.7.32 Tables 12-24 and 12-25 show that, in terms of total traffic flows, Links 3, 6, 8, 9, 10 
and 11 will experience a Minor adverse effect during the AM peak hour. Links 3, 4, 
6, 8, 10 and 11 will experience a Minor adverse effect during the PM peak hour. It 
is not possible to determine the magnitude of change and sensitivity of Link 1 given 
the absence of existing traffic data. However, it considered that the effect of an 
increase in traffic of only six vehicle movements in both the AM and PM peak hours 
will be Negligible. All other links will experience a Negligible effect.

12.7.34 Table 12-26 shows that Link 2 will experience a Negligible effect, and Links 3 and 
4 will experience a Minor adverse effect. No pedestrian movements have been 
observed on Link 3; there is no footway along the majority of this link and no key 
destinations that pedestrians are likely to travel to. There is a short section of 
footway at the southern end of the link, which serves the Access Road that serves 
Bryn Whilach Farm. The footway is approximately 2 m wide and is of sufficient 
width to accommodate the limited pedestrian movements at this location. Minimal 
pedestrian movement has been observed on Link 4. There is a 2 m wide footway 
along the entirety of this link, which is separated from the carriageway edge along 
much of its length by a barrier. The area is also street lit.  
12.7.35 Again, it is not possible to determine the magnitude of change and sensitivity of 
Link 1 given the absence of existing traffic data. However, it considered that the 
effect of an increase of only four HGV movements over the 24-hour period will be 
Negligible. The other links in the study area on which the Project construction 
traffic will result in an increase in HGV traffic movements are Links 5 (M4 
eastbound on-slip), 6 (A48, between the northern and southern dumbbell 
roundabouts of the M4 Junction 46) and 7 (M4 westbound off-slip), associated with 
movements to/from the M4. These links are part of the strategic highway network 
and are designed to carry high volumes of HGV traffic. Whilst the increase in HGV 
traffic from the Project will result in a deterioration of the pedestrian experience, 
minimal pedestrian movement has been observed at these locations, which is 
typical given the nature of the strategic access junction. It is also likely that any 
pedestrians at these locations will already be accustomed to the levels of general 
traffic and HGVs. 
iv. Severance, Pedestrian Delay, Pedestrian Amenity, Fear and Intimidation – 
PRoW 
12.7.36 In respect of PRoW, Footpath L35B passes through the Project Site perpendicular 
to the route of the Gas Connection, connecting to Rhyd-y-Pandy Road in the 
vicinity of the AGI Access. Footpaths LC34 and LC117 cross the Access Road. 
Footpath LC34 crosses the Access Road at a point approximately 350 m from the 
Abergelli ES 2018 – CHAPTER 12: TRAFFIC, TRANSPORT AND ACCESS 
Prepared for:  Abergelli Power Limited  
AECOM 
12-40 
 
B4489. This would be affected by works to widen the Access Road. Footpath 
LC117 routes adjacent to the perimeter of the Felindre Gas Compressor Station 
and would be affected by the construction of the new section of Access Road to 
serve the Project Site, crossing at a point approximately 1.3 km from the Access 
Road. The proposed management of the PRoW is set out in the CTMP and will be 
developed further in consultation with the PRoW Officer at the CCS. 
12.7.37 There is no recent usage data for these footpaths and therefore their sensitivity has 
been assessed as high to ensure a robust assessment using a worst case. The 
magnitude of impact is anticipated to low, as all users should still be able to make a 
pedestrian movement, but there will be some hindrance in doing so (e.g. due to 
short term closures/diversions). The significance of effect will therefore be 
Moderate adverse, which is significant, albeit temporary. This level of effect is 
considered to apply to the individual Project components and the full Project. 
v. Driver Delay 
12.7.38 The assessment of driver delay has been based on the capacity assessment of the 
junction network described at Sections 12.4 and 12.5. The following sub-sections 
present the driver delay at the junction network during the weekday AM and PM 
peak hours in 2022 both without and with the individual Project components/full 
Project, the difference between the two and the percentage change. The capacity 
assessment output reports are reproduced in Appendix 12.2. 
Power Generation Plant 
12.7.39  Tables 12-27 and 12-28 show the driver delay at the junction network during the 
weekday AM and PM peak hours respectively in 2022 both without and with the 
Power Generation Plant construction traffic.

12.7.40 Table 12-27 shows that, during the AM peak hour, the entry arms of Pant Lasau 
Road, A48 (Southwest), B4489 (South) and A48 (Southwest) will experience a 
Minor adverse effect. The B4489 (North) and M4 eastbound and westbound off-
slips will experience a Minor beneficial effect; this is as a result of changes in the 
balance of traffic flows at the junction, which will result in more gaps for traffic

exiting from this arm as priorities are changed. This will result in a reduction in the 
level of delay of the arms benefitting from traffic flow balancing and an increase in 
arms which are forced to concede priority more than before flows were balanced. 
The A48 (Southeast) will experience a Negligible effect, which is not significant. 
12.7.41 Table 12-28 shows that, during the PM peak hour, the entry arms of Pant Lasau 
Road and the A48 (Southeast) will experience a Minor adverse effect. All other 
arms will experience a Negligible effect. 
12.7.42 In summary, the Power Generation Plant will, at worst, have a Minor adverse 
effect in terms of driver delay, which is not considered significant. This effect will be 
temporary in nature, and only experienced during the peak of construction traffic 
movements.

The B4489 (North and South) and the M4 eastbound off-slip will experience a

Negligible effect, with the exception of the A48 (Southeast), which will experience 
a Minor adverse effect. 
12.7.54 In summary, the Project will, at worst, have a Minor adverse effect in terms of 
driver delay, which is not significant. This effect will be temporary in nature, and 
only experienced during the peak of construction traffic movements. 
vi. Accidents and Safety 
12.7.55 As discussed in Section 12.5, the analysis of the PIC data and listed causation 
factors has not identified any existing highway safety issues in the study area. 
Where PICs have been recorded, these have been identified as being as a result of 
causation factors relating to driver/road user error and weather conditions. No 
causation factors relating to highway defects have been reported in the PIC data. 
On the basis of this analysis, it is considered that the sensitivity of this receptor is 
very low. 
12.7.56 The individual Project components and Project will result in an increase in traffic 
flows in the study area. Whilst an increase in traffic flows may result in an increase 
in the risk levels, the increases in traffic that will occur from the individual Project 
components and Project are such that the magnitude of change in terms of risk 
level will be very low. On this basis, the individual Project components and Project 
will have a Negligible effect.  
b) Operation and Maintenance 
12.7.57 The traffic generation of the Project during the operational phase is expected to be 
minimal. The Project will employ up to 15 permanent staff working on a shift 
pattern. This will likely generate 30 movements per day (two movements per staff 
Abergelli ES 2018 – CHAPTER 12: TRAFFIC, TRANSPORT AND ACCESS 
Prepared for:  Abergelli Power Limited  
AECOM 
12-48 
 
member). A demineralised water trailer and diesel fuel tanker will visit the Project 
Site periodically. 
12.7.58 Maintenance periods will occur annually. During these periods, there may be up to 
40 additional staff on-site for a period of one month. Based on a vehicle occupancy 
level of 1.6, this will equate to an additional 50 movements per day (25 arrivals 
during the AM peak hour, 25 departures during the PM peak hour); this is well 
within the peak traffic generation forecast for staff during the construction phase.  
12.7.59 Overall, when assessed against the same receptors as construction and assuming 
the same sensitivity of each receptor, the significance of the effect of operation is 
anticipated to be Negligible, which is not significant. 
c) Decommissioning 
12.7.60 The decommissioning phase for the Power Generation Plant is likely to be similar in 
nature to construction although some elements are expected to be left in situ. The 
number of construction staff will be less as the new section of Access Road will be 
constructed for the development and left in place and therefore the impacts are 
likely to be similar or less than those described for the construction phase. The 
decommissioning phase for the gas and electrical connection will generate very few 
vehicle movements, as it is likely that the Gas Pipeline and Electrical Connection 
will be capped and left in situ. 
12.7.61 Overall, the impact of the Project during the decommissioning phase is expected to 
be lesser in nature to the construction phase as many aspects are to be left in situ. 
As a result, no further assessment of the decommissioning phase has been 
undertaken.  
12.8 
Mitigation and Monitoring 
12.8.1 As a general rule, additional mitigation measures have been proposed where a 
significant effect is predicted to occur. Embedded mitigation measures, which have 
been incorporated within the design of the Project or are standard practice 
measures that have been committed to are summarised in Chapter 3: Project and 
Site Description. 
12.8.2 The assessment has identified that the individual Project components and full 
Project will have a Moderate adverse effect during the construction phase and this 
is restricted to the three PRoW; these effects will be temporary. No other significant 
adverse effects have been identified through this robust assessment. The CTMP 
that has been prepared includes proposed measures for management of the 
PRoW, which will be developed further in consultation with the PRoW Officer. 
Where possible, connectivity will be maintained by the use of temporary diversions 
and working methods to allow the PRoWs to remain open for the majority of the 
construction period. 
12.8.3 No additional mitigation measures are proposed in view of the temporary nature of 
these effects. There will ongoing monitoring of the CTMP and CSTP during the 
construction phase to establish the effectiveness of the measures contained within 
these documents.

12.9 
Residual Effects 
12.9.1 Table 12-35 presents a summary of the TA. It identifies the receptor/s likely to be 
impacted, the level of effect and, where the effect is deemed to be significant, 
includes the mitigation proposed and the resulting residual effect. 
12.9.2 As discussed, the effects will be Negligible during the operational phase and 
similar to construction during the decommissioning phase. Therefore, only the 
residual effects during the construction phase are shown. Negligible effects are not 
included. 
12.9.3 Table 12-35 provides a breakdown of the effects by Project component (i.e. Power 
Generation Plant, Gas Connection, and Electrical Connection) and the full Project. 
12.9.4 Table 12-35 shows that the effects of each of the Project components and the 
Project as a whole will be significant in regard to receptors relating to the 
pedestrian experience (severance, pedestrian amenity, pedestrian delay, fear and 
intimidation) on the three PRoW (Footpaths LC34, LC35B and LC117). The 
embedded mitigation measures will seek to manage these effects and their 
associated risks but will not reduce the significance of effect. No additional 
mitigation measures are proposed in view of the temporary nature of these effects. 
There will ongoing monitoring of the CTMP and CSTP during the construction 
phase to establish the effectiveness of the measures contained within these 
documents.

12.10 Cumulative Effects 
a) Assessment 
of 
Potential 
Cumulative 
Effects 
– 
Construction 
and 
Decommissioning 
i. 
Description of baseline where cumulative impacts expected 
12.10.1 The following sensitive receptors have been identified which could, potentially, 
experience cumulative effects generated by the construction phase of the Project in 
combination with other schemes set out in Table 4-6, Chapter 4: Approach to 
Environmental Impact Assessment. 
 Severance; 
 Pedestrian Delay; 
 Pedestrian Amenity; 
 Fear and Intimidation; and 
 Driver Delay. 
ii. Description of Impact 
12.10.2 The following potential cumulative impacts on transport receptors have been 
identified as potentially arising as a result of construction of the Project in 
combination with other schemes set out in Table 4-6, Chapter 4: Approach to 
Environmental Impact Assessment. 
 Deterioration in the pedestrian experience (associated with severance, 
pedestrian delay, pedestrian amenity, fear and intimidation) resulting from 
increased vehicle movements associated with the construction of the Project, in 
combination with the increased vehicle movements associated with the 
construction/operation of cumulative development; and 
 Increased driver delay at junctions resulting from increased vehicle movements 
associated with the construction of the Project, in combination with the 
increased vehicle movements associated with the construction/operation of 
cumulative development. 
iii. Assessment of Cumulative Effect 
12.10.3 The assessment which has been carried out and presented in Section 12.7 has 
been repeated to take into account the effect of cumulative development on 
locations where the Project will have a significant residual effect. It is important to 
give appropriate consideration to the cumulative impacts arising from other 
committed development. This is defined by a development that is consented or 
allocated where there is a reasonable degree of certainty that it will proceed within 
the next three years. 
12.10.4 A list of the cumulative development considered as part of the ES is included and 
agreed with CCS in Table 4-6 of Chapter 4: Approach to Environmental Impact 
Assessment. From this list the developments shown in Table 12-36 have been 
considered suitable for inclusion in the TA.  
12.10.5 The request for inclusion of the two strategic sites from CCS has been considered. 
Under the guidance, it is important to give appropriate consideration to the 
Abergelli ES 2018 – CHAPTER 12: TRAFFIC, TRANSPORT AND ACCESS 
 
Prepared for:  Abergelli Power Limited 
 
AECOM 
12-55 
 
cumulative impacts arising from other committed development (i.e. development 
that is consented or allocated where there is a reasonable degree of certainty that it 
will proceed within the next three years).  
12.10.6 In considering the current status of the LDP and the timeline of the Project, it is 
considered that, under the guidance set out above, it is unlikely that the Project and 
Sites SD, E and G will impact upon each other in the near future. The guidance 
defines committed development as a development which is consented or allocated 
and where there is a reasonable amount of certainty that it will come forward in the 
next three years. The Swansea Local Development Plan is, at the time of writing, at 
the inspector’s hearing and may become formally adopted by the end of summer or 
autumn 2018. Therefore, the official status of all the strategic development sites is 
unallocated. In the case of SD and G, the tender for transport planning services 
was released approximately 18 months ago. At present, there is no planning 
application submitted or sufficient information in the public domain. Therefore, the 
sites in question is also not classed as consented. 
12.10.7 Notwithstanding the above, this Chapter does consider the likelihood of the 
strategic sites coming forward in the next three years and in the timeline of the 
Project construction period. If a planning application was to be submitted for the 
strategic sites within the next six months, it could take another six months or more 
to gain a formal decision. Following any grant of planning permission, there will be 
conditions to discharge. The form the applications will take is not known; if only an 
outline application is submitted the timeline could double. If the applications are in 
full or a hybrid then the detailed design of new highways and/or improvements will 
begin. These will be submitted for technical approval by the LHA; this process of 
design and approval is likely to take around 12 months or more. The anticipated 
time for this development to become consented is between 6-12 months from 
submission and then a further 12 months or more to be able to proceed. 
12.10.8 The Project is adhering to a legislative timeline for submission with a substantial 
amount of work already been completed and within the public domain. Once 
accepted, a decision on the DCO Application is expected in autumn 2019. 
Therefore the probability of the Project and the strategic sites being in construction 
at the same time is low. In the worst case (which is considered unlikely), 
construction on the strategic sites may commence at the end of the Project 
construction period. This would be after peak construction traffic for the Project, 
which occurs around 11 months from commencement. Construction on the 
strategic sites would also be limited to initial preliminary construction activities at 
that time. 
12.10.9 The conclusions that were drawn at the time of consideration was that the Project 
consenting process was considerably ahead of the nearby potential strategic site 
allocations. Thus if, in the unlikely scenario, the sites were to overlap construction 
periods for less than a year, the strategic sites would need to account for the 
Project as committed. This approach would also ensure robust assessments were 
undertaken in the future given that Project traffic impact will be in the public domain 
and agreed with the LHA; this eliminates the need for broad assumptions and 
Abergelli ES 2018 – CHAPTER 12: TRAFFIC, TRANSPORT AND ACCESS

follows logical steps. There are complexities with trying to assume development 
quantum, access arrangements and mitigation measures associated with strategic 
sites that would prevent meaningful assessment at this stage.

12.10.10 Other cumulative development listed in Chapter 4: Approach to Environmental 
Impact Assessment has been omitted for one or more of the following reasons: 
 Construction phase will not coincide with construction of the Project (i.e. will be 
completed prior to commencement of the Project); 
 Operational phase will involve maintenance only (such as for solar and wind 
farm uses), the traffic generation of which is negligible; 
 An existing use or will result in a net reduction in traffic generation; 
 Not yet been subject to a planning application, so no details of traffic generation 
are available. Where these sites are part of the LDP, it has been are assumed 
that these have been accounted for in background traffic growth;  
 No details of traffic generation included in the planning application 
documentation; and 
 Does not comply with the assessed definition of committed development. 
12.10.11 The traffic generation and distribution of traffic associated with the included 
cumulative development has been derived from supporting documentation 
contained within the respective planning applications. The cumulative development 
traffic flows during the weekday AM and PM peak hours are shown on Figures 
12.26 and 12.27 respectively. These have been added to the traffic flows on 
Figures 12.18 to 12.25 (i.e. the ‘2022 Baseline’ with individual Project 
components/full Project) to derive traffic flows for the following cumulative 
development scenarios: 
 2022 Baseline + Power Generation Plant Construction Traffic + Cumulative 
Development – see Figures 12.28 and 12.29; 
 2022 Baseline + Gas Connection Construction Traffic + Cumulative 
Development – see Figures 12.30 and 12.31; 
 2022 Baseline + Electrical Connection Construction Traffic + Cumulative 
Development – see Figures 12.32 and 12.33; and

vi. Summary 
12.10.7 The cumulative assessment for the individual Project components/full Project has 
identified that there will be no change in the significance of effects relating to the 
pedestrian experience (severance, pedestrian amenity, pedestrian delay, fear and 
intimidation). The residual cumulative effect will be Minor to Moderate adverse. 
Therefore, no mitigation is considered to be required.

Prepared for:  Abergelli Power Limited 
 
AECOM 
12-70 
 
12.10.8 In respect of driver delay, it has been identified that will be a change in the 
significance of effect, primarily during the AM peak hour. The residual cumulative 
effects will be the same for the individual Project components/full Project. During 
the AM peak hour, the residual cumulative effect will be Minor adverse on the 
B4489 (North), M4 eastbound and westbound off-slips, Pant Lasau Road and the 
A48 (Southwest), and Major adverse on the B4489 (South). During the PM peak 
hour, the residual cumulative effect will be Minor adverse on the A48 (Southeast) 
and Major adverse on Pant Lasau Road. 
12.10.9 Whilst these effects are significant, the contribution of the individual Project 
components/full Project will be temporary in nature and does not require the 
delivery of mitigation measures such as capacity improvements. As identified in 
Section 12.5, observations in 2017 suggest that the junctions assessed are 
currently operating with a greater level of capacity than is reported based on the 
2014 traffic survey data. The junctions are therefore unlikely to show the levels of 
delay reported in future year assessment scenarios. It should also be taken into 
consideration that the assessments carried out in this report are robust and 
compound a number of peak scenarios that would not normally coincide to create a 
theoretical worst case scenario. 
b) Assessment of Potential Cumulative Effects – Operation 
12.10.10 As discussed at Section 12.7, the residual transport effects of the individual 
Project components/ Project during the operational phase will be Negligible. 
Therefore, no further assessment of the cumulative effects is required. 
c) Assessment of Potential Cumulative Effects – Decommissioning 
 The residual transport effects will be as for the construction phase.

Historic Environment 
13.1 
Introduction 
13.1.1 This chapter of the ES provides an assessment of the effects on the historic 
environment arising from the construction, operation, and decommissioning of the 
Project. Maintenance is included within the operational assessment of the Project. 
13.1.2 A detailed description of the Project and Project Site is provided in Chapter 3: 
Project and Site Description. A glossary of terms and list of abbreviations used in 
this chapter is provided in Document Reference 1.4. 
13.1.3 Historic assets include Scheduled Monuments, Listed Buildings, Registered 
Historic Parks and Gardens, Registered Historic Landscapes, Conservation Areas, 
upstanding archaeological earthworks and buried remains, and historic hedgerows. 
For the ease of presentation in this document, all cultural heritage features are 
referred to as ‘historic assets’. 
a) Objectives of the assessment 
13.1.4 The purpose of this chapter is to outline the historic environment resource of the 
Project Site and its environs, to identify potential constraints to the Project, to 
assess the likely significant impacts on historic environment receptors, to formulate 
mitigation measures where a significant impact is identified, and to quantify any 
residual effects. 
13.1.5 The following tasks were undertaken for this assessment: 
 Legislation and policy context review; 
 Consultation with statutory and non-statutory bodies to identify interests and 
concerns regarding cultural heritage; 
 Desk-based study to obtain baseline archaeological and historical data; 
 Site survey to augment desk-based baseline data; 
 Identification of the potential impacts of the Project and assessment of their 
significance; and 
 Formulation of mitigation of potential impacts. 
13.2 
Changes since the 2014 PEIR 
13.2.1 The main updates to this chapter since the 2014 PEIR have been in response to 
the change in stack height (to a maximum of 45 m instead of 40 m) and reduction in 
stacks as outlined in Section 3.2 in Chapter 3: Project and Site Description. 
Updates have also been made to the assessment due to the length of time since 
the original study; these updates have taken place alongside further dialogue with 
statutory consultees. Since the 2018 PEIR there have been alterations to the 
alignment of the new section of Access Road. These changes have not changed 
the findings of this chapter.

Legislation, policy and guidance  
13.3.1 This section identifies and describes legislation, policy and guidance of relevance 
to the assessment of the potential impacts associated with the construction, 
operation and decommissioning of the Project, upon historic assets. 
13.3.2 Legislation and policy has been considered on a national, regional, and local level 
(although no relevant regional-level legislation or policy was identified). The 
following is relevant to the assessment as it has influenced the sensitivity of 
receptors and requirements for mitigation or the scope and/or methodology of the 
Environmental Impact Assessment (EIA). 
a) 
National 
i. 
Overarching National Policy Statement for Energy (NPS EN1; Ref. 13.1) 
13.3.3 Paragraph 5.8.1 of National Policy Statement for Energy (NPS) EN1 states that the 
construction, operation, and decommissioning of energy infrastructure has the 
potential to result in adverse impacts on the historic environment. Paragraph 5.8.2 
defines the historic environment as including all aspects of the environment 
resulting from the interaction between people and places through time, including all 
surviving physical remains of past human activity, whether visible, buried or 
submerged, landscaped and planted or managed flora. Those elements of the 
historic environment that hold value to this and future generations because of their 
historic, archaeological, architectural or artistic interest are called heritage assets. 
The NPS defines a ‘heritage asset’ as any building, monument, site, place, area or 
landscape, or any combination of these. The sum of the heritage interests that a 
‘heritage asset’ holds is referred to as its significance. 
13.3.4 Paragraph 5.8.3 of the NPS discusses ‘Heritage Assets’ that merit designation and 
identifies these as assets falling within the following categories:  
 A World Heritage Site;  
 Scheduled Monument;  
 Protected Wreck Site;  
 Protected Military Remains;  
 Listed Building;  
 Registered Park and Garden;  
 Conservation Area; and  
 Registered Historic Landscape (Wales only). 
13.3.5 Paragraph 5.8.4 of the NPS goes on to highlight that there are heritage assets with 
archaeological interest that are not currently designated as scheduled monuments, 
but are demonstrably of equivalent significance. These include: (i) those that have 
yet to be formally assessed for designation; (ii) those that have been assessed as 
being designatable but the SoS has decided not to designate; and (iii) those that 
are incapable of being designated by virtue of being outside the scope of the 
Ancient Monuments and Archaeological Areas Act 1979. 
Abergelli ES 2018 – CHAPTER 13: HISTORIC ENVIRONMENT 
 
Prepared for:  Abergelli Power Limited  
AECOM 
13-4 
 
13.3.6 In paragraph 5.8.5, the NPS notes that the absence of designation for such 
heritage assets does not indicate lower significance. If the evidence before the SoS 
indicates that a non-designated heritage asset of the type described in 5.8.4 of the 
NPS may be affected by the proposed development then the heritage asset should 
be considered subject to the same policy considerations as those that apply to 
designated heritage assets. 
13.3.7 Paragraph 5.8.6 dictates that the SoS should also consider the impacts on other 
non-designated heritage assets, as identified either through the development plan-
making process (local listing) or through the SoS’s decision-making process on the 
basis of clear evidence that the assets have a heritage significance that merits 
consideration in its decisions, even though those assets are of lesser value than 
designated assets. 
13.3.8 Paragraph 5.8.8 of the NPS states that, as part of the applicant's assessment, the 
applicant should provide a description of the significance of the heritage assets 
affected by the proposed development and the contribution of their setting to that 
significance. The level of detail should be proportionate to the importance of the 
heritage assets and no more than is sufficient to understand the potential impact of 
the proposal on the heritage asset. As a minimum, the applicant should have 
consulted the relevant Historic Environment Record (HER) and assessed the 
heritage assets themselves, using expertise where necessary according to the 
proposed development's impact. 
13.3.9 Paragraph 5.8.9 of the NPS is concerned with heritage assets with archaeological 
interest and states that the applicant should carry out appropriate desk-based 
assessment and, where such desk-based research is insufficient to properly assess 
the interest, a field evaluation. 
Infrastructure Planning (Decisions) Regulations 2010 
13.3.10 Section 104(2)(c) of the PA 2008 provides that in deciding an application under the 
PA 2008, the SoS must have regard to any "any matters prescribed in relation to 
development of the description to which the application relates". 
13.3.11 Regulation 3 of the Infrastructure Planning (Decisions) Regulations 2010 sets out 
such a prescribed matter. It provides that: 
1) 
When deciding an application which affects a listed building or its setting, the 
decision-maker must have regard to the desirability of preserving the listed 
building or its setting or any features of special architectural or historic interest 
which it possesses. 
2) 
When deciding an application relating to a conservation area, the decision-
maker must have regard to the desirability of preserving or enhancing the 
character or appearance of that area. 
3) 
When deciding an application for development consent which affects or is 
likely to affect a scheduled monument or its setting, the decision-maker must 
have regard to the desirability of preserving the scheduled monument or its 
setting.

13.3.12 In carrying out this assessment, APL has had regard to these considerations. 
The Ancient Monuments and Archaeological Areas Act 1979  
13.3.13 The Act (Ref. 13.2) imposes a requirement for Scheduled Monument Consent for 
any works of demolition, repair and alteration that might affect a Scheduled 
Monument. The Act sets out a presumption in favour of preservation in-situ 
concerning sites and monuments of national importance.   
The Planning (Listed Buildings and Conservation Areas) Act 1990 
13.3.14 The Act (Ref. 13.3) sets out the principal statutory provisions which must be 
considered in the determination of any application affecting either listed buildings or 
conservation areas.  
13.3.15 Section 66 of the Act states that, in considering whether to grant planning 
permission for development that affects a listed building or its setting, the local 
planning authority or the Secretary of State shall have special regard to the 
desirability of preserving the building or its setting or any features of special 
architectural or historic interest it possesses. By virtue of Section 1(5) of the Act, a 
listed building includes any object or structure within its curtilage. 
13.3.16 Section 66 applies in relation to a consideration of whether to grant ‘planning 
permission’. ‘Planning permission’ is defined under Section 91(2) of that Act as 
having the same meaning as in the principal Act (which is defined as the Town and 
Country Planning Act 1990 (TCPA 1990)). ‘Planning permission’ is defined under 
the TCPA 1990 as a permission under Part III of that Act. Under Part III of that Act, 
planning permission is required for the carrying out of any development of land 
(Section 57). Section 33(1)(a) of the PA 2008 provides that, to the extent that 
development consent is required for a development, planning permission is not 
required under the TCPA 1990. Therefore, Section 66 does not apply to decisions 
under the PA 2008.   
13.3.17 Section 66 will apply for applications made under the Town and Country Planning 
Act 1990 for the Gas Connection and/or the Electrical Connection.  
13.3.18 Although APL considers that Section 66 does not apply to decisions under the PA 
2008, it has taken into account the principles from the Barnwell Manor Court of 
Appeal case in undertaking this assessment (see Barnwell Manor Wind Energy Ltd 
v E. Northants DC English Heritage, National Trust & SSCLG [2014] EWCA Civ 
137). This is because, pursuant to Section 104(2)(d) of the PA 2008, the Secretary 
of State must have regard to “any other matters which the Secretary of State thinks 
are both important and relevant”. 
13.3.19 In the Barnwell Manor case, the Court of Appeal held that decision makers should 
give 'considerable importance and weight' to the desirability of preserving the 
setting of listed buildings when carrying out the required balancing exercise 
pursuant to Section 66(1).

The Hedgerow Regulations 1997 
13.3.20 The Hedgerow Regulations (Ref. 13.4) allow for provisions to be made for, or in 
connection with, the protection of important hedgerows in England or Wales from 
activities that are not necessarily subject to planning consent. The identification of a 
hedgerow as ‘important’ was to be determined in accordance with criteria laid out in 
Hedgerow Regulations 1997.   
13.3.21 The regulations state that a hedgerow is important if it is at least 30 years old and 
meets one of the following criteria: 
 Marking a boundary of a historic parish or township (prior to 1850); 
 Associated with a Scheduled Monument or site on the Sites and Monuments 
Record (now HER) at the relevant date; 
 Marks the boundary of a pre-1600 AD estate or manor, or associated with a 
building of such a manor or estate; 
 Part of a field system pre-dating the Inclosure Act (1845); or 
 Related to a building or feature associated with a system pre-dating the 
Inclosure Act (1845) and that system is substantially complete or part of field 
system where the pattern was identified in 1997 as a key landscape 
characteristic. 
Historic Environment (Wales) Act 2016  
13.3.22 The Act (Ref. 13.5) makes amendments to the Ancient Monuments and 
Archaeological Areas Act 1979 and to the Planning (Listed Buildings and 
Conservation Areas) Act 1990 as they apply to Wales. The Act provides a better 
means of protecting scheduled monuments and listed buildings in Wales, aids in 
the management of the historic environment and imposes a greater degree of 
transparency and responsibility concerning decisions affecting the historic 
environment. It also makes provisions for the compilation of historic place names, a 
historic environment record for each local authority in Wales, and for the 
establishment of the Advisory Panel for the Welsh Historic Environment. 
Planning Policy Wales 2016 
13.3.23 The Welsh Government’s Planning Policy Wales (PPW 2016; Edition 9, November 
2016) (Ref. 13.6) aims to protect the historic environment, including archaeology 
and ancient monuments, listed buildings, conservation areas and historic parks, 
gardens and landscapes. This national policy provides guidance to local planning 
authorities during the determination of planning applications and makes it clear that 
there is no need for local plans to duplicate national policy. 
13.3.24 Chapter 6 of PPW 2016 specifically relates to the protection of the historic 
environment in Wales. The objectives of PPW 2016 are to: 
 Conserve and enhance the historic environment, which is a finite and non-
renewable resource; 
Abergelli ES 2018 – CHAPTER 13: HISTORIC ENVIRONMENT 
 
Prepared for:  Abergelli Power Limited  
AECOM 
13-7 
 
 Recognise its contribution to economic vitality and culture, civic pride, local 
distinctiveness and the quality of Welsh life, which must be maintained for 
future generations; 
 Base decisions on an understanding of the significance of historic assets and to 
contribute to the recording of these assets and making these publically 
available; and 
 Protect World Heritage Sites, safeguard the character of historic buildings, 
preserve or enhance conservation areas, historic parks and gardens and 
historic landscapes, and to conserve archaeological remains for their role in 
education, leisure and the economy. 
Technical Advice Notice (TAN) 24 (to PPW 2016)  
13.3.25 TAN 24 (Ref. 13.7) is supplement to PPW 2016 which details the advice regarding 
archaeology and the planning process within Wales. The purpose of this TAN is to 
provide technical guidance on how the planning system considers the historic 
environment during development plan preparation, and decision-making on 
planning and Listed Building applications. This TAN provides specific guidance on 
how the following aspects of the historic environment should be considered: World 
Heritage Sites; Scheduled Monuments; archaeological remains; Listed Buildings; 
Conservation Areas; historic parks and gardens; historic landscapes; and historic 
assets of special local interest. 
b) Local 
City and County of Swansea (CCS) Unitary Development Plan (UDP) 
13.3.26 The CCS UDP (as detailed in Chapter 2: Regulatory and Policy Background) 
(Ref. 13.8) was adopted in November 2008 and sets out the key policy relating to 
the historic environment, as follows. 
13.3.27 Policy EV6 states that the Council will seek to protect, preserve and enhance 
Scheduled Monuments and their settings, and also unscheduled archaeological 
sites and monuments and their settings. Applicants are required to submit an 
assessment which enables the historic environment baseline, the development 
impact, and the proposed mitigation to be clearly understood. 
13.3.28 Policy EV9 states that development within or adjacent to a conservation area will 
only be permitted if it would preserve or enhance the character or appearance of 
the conservation area or its setting. 
13.3.29 Policy EV11 states that development that would harm the character or setting of 
registered Historic Parks and Gardens or the character of Historic Landscapes will 
not be permitted. 
13.3.30 Policy EV12 states that character of lanes and public paths that contribute to the 
amenity, natural, and historic qualities of an area will be protected. Development 
proposals that include requirements to set back improvement lines, remove 
hedgerows, and provide new access and visibility splays will be resisted where this 
would result in a loss of character.In rural areas the design of any necessary works 
Abergelli ES 2018 – CHAPTER 13: HISTORIC ENVIRONMENT 
 
Prepared for:  Abergelli Power Limited  
AECOM 
13-8 
 
should be appropriate to the character of the area and should not detract from the 
landscape or suburbanise the area. 
City and County of Swansea Deposit Local Development Plan 
13.3.31 The City and County of Swansea Deposit Local Development Plan (Ref 13.9) sets 
out the key policy relating to the historic environment (as discussed in detailed in 
Chapter 2: Regulatory and Policy Background), as summarised below: 
13.3.32 Strategic Policy HC1 – Historic and Cultural Environment, states that the County’s 
distinctive historic and cultural environment will be preserved or enhanced by: 
 Requiring high quality design standards in all development proposals to 
respond positively to local character and distinctiveness; 
 Identifying and safeguarding heritage assets, sites and their settings; 
 Supporting heritage and cultural led regeneration schemes; and 
 Safeguarding and promoting use of the Welsh language. 
13.3.33 The above policy therefore seeks to secure the sustainable management, 
preservation and enhancement of the character and appearance of the historic and 
cultural environment, whilst supporting appropriate heritage-led regeneration 
proposals to release the social and economic potential of these assets. 
13.3.34 Strategic Policy HC2 – Preservation or Enhancement of Buildings and Features 
states that the County’s buildings and features of historic importance will be 
preserved or enhanced through the following measures: 
 Proposals for alteration and/or extension to a listed building or its curtilage must 
ensure that the special architectural character or historic interest is preserved; 
 The change of use of a listed building or its curtilage will only be permitted 
where this contributes towards the retention of a building or its sustainable 
reuse without having an adverse effect on its character, special interest or 
structural integrity; 
 Permission will not be granted for the total or substantial demolition of a listed 
building, or an unlisted locally important building that makes a positive 
contribution to the character or appearance of an area, unless there is the 
strongest justification and convincing evidence that the proposal is necessary; 
 Proposals which have a relationship to a listed building or its curtilage must 
ensure that the setting is preserved; 
 Development within or adjacent to a conservation area will only be permitted if 
it would preserve and enhance the character or appearance of the conservation 
area or its setting. New development in such locations must also be of a high 
standard of design, respond to the area’s special characteristics, and pay 
particular regard to: 
 Important views, vistas, street scenes, roofscapes, trees, open spaces, gaps 
and other features that contribute to the character or appearance of the 
conservation area; 
 The retention of historically significant boundaries or other elements that 
contribute to the established form of development; 
Abergelli ES 2018 – CHAPTER 13: HISTORIC ENVIRONMENT 
 
Prepared for:  Abergelli Power Limited  
AECOM 
13-9 
 
 The relationship to existing buildings and spaces, and grain of development; 
 Scale, height and massing, architectural design, established architectural 
detailing, the use of materials, boundary treatment, and public realm materials; 
and 
 Ensuring that development does not have a significant adverse effect upon 
historic assets of special local interest. 
13.3.35 The policy seeks to ensure that the conservation of the whole built environment is 
taken into consideration in the determination of applications for both listed building 
consent and conservation area consent. It also seeks to ensure that any new 
development accords with the special architectural and historic interest of 
designated conservation areas and their settings. Whilst the character or 
appearance of conservation areas must be a major consideration, it does not 
preclude carefully considered contemporary design. Development proposals will be 
judged for their effect on the character and appearance of conservation areas. It 
must be noted that this is an emerging policy. 
c) Best practice guidance documents 
Conservation Principles for the Sustainable Management of the Historic 
Environment in Wales 
13.3.36 These principles (Ref. 13.10) provide the basis upon which Cadw discharges its 
statutory duties, and advises and makes decisions regarding changes made to 
historic assets. Cadw encourages the use of the principles to assess any potential 
impacts on the significance of any historic asset during potential developments. 
The Setting of Historic Assets in Wales  
13.3.37 This document (Ref. 13.11) outlines the definition of the term ‘setting’ and how this 
can contribute to the significance of a historic asset. It also explains the standards 
used to assess the potential impact of a development within the setting of World 
Heritage Sites, ancient monuments (scheduled and unscheduled), listed buildings, 
registered historic parks and gardens, and conservation areas. These principles 
can apply to all types of historic assets regardless of their designation.  
Standard and Guidance for Historic Environment Desk-based Assessments 
13.3.38 This assessment complies with the professional guidance laid out by the Chartered 
Institute for Archaeologists’ Standard and Guidance for Historic Environment Desk-
based Assessments (Ref. 13.12). 
13.4 
Methodology 
a) 
Scope of the assessment 
13.4.1 The scope of this assessment has been determined through a formal EIA scoping 
process undertaken with the Planning Inspectorate (PINS). Comments raised on

c) 
Study area 
13.4.5 This assessment adopts three ‘Study Areas’, as follows: 
Abergelli ES 2018 – CHAPTER 13: HISTORIC ENVIRONMENT 
 
Prepared for:  Abergelli Power Limited  
AECOM 
13-12 
 
 Project Site; 
 1 km Study Area (1 km buffer around the Project Site); and 
 5 km Study Area (5 km buffer around the Project Site). 
13.4.6 A full suite of baseline data for both designated and non-designated assets has 
been gathered for the Project Site and 1 km Study Area (Figure 13.1). This 
provides information about all known assets within the Project Site (i.e. those 
potentially physically impacted by the development) and the broader context in 
which they exist. These data also provide a potential indication of the date and 
character of any undiscovered archaeology that may be present. The decision to 
adopt a 1 km Study Area is based upon professional judgement. 
13.4.7 The 5 km Study Area enables the assessment of effects upon the setting of 
designated historic assets (Figure 13.2). Only data for designated assets has been 
acquired for this study area. The Zone of Theoretical Visibility (ZTV) for the Project 
has been established by Chapter 11: Landscape and Visual Effects (Figure 11.7) 
and has been refined in the field by both the landscape architect and the 
archaeologist undertaking the assessment. The field visits enable the true situation 
on the ground to be appreciated, particularly in terms of the role of tree cover and 
other vertical landscape elements which dictate the availability of long-distance 
views. This has been used to help define the potential visibility from heritage assets 
within the 5 km Study Area used within this chapter. 
13.4.8 In subsequent parts of this chapter, where reference is made to the ‘Study Areas’, 
this applies to all ground within the Project Site, 1 km and 5 km study areas. 
d) 
Site visit 
13.4.9 The Project Site and the 1 km Study Area were visited on 8th November 2017. The 
purpose of this survey was to assess the character of known historic assets, 
identify any additional visible assets, and to assess possible factors which may 
affect the survival or condition of known or potential assets. Additionally, the 5 km 
Study Area was visited in order to allow an assessment of the potential for impacts 
on the significance of the setting of selected designated historic assets. 
e) Sensitivity 
i. 
Sensitivity of historic assets 
13.4.10 This assessment adopts the criteria for value set out in the Design Manual for 
Roads and Bridges (DMRB), Volume 11 Section 3 Part 2, Annex 5 Archaeological 
Remains, Annex 6 Historic Buildings and Annex 7 Historic Landscape (Ref. 13.13), 
Table 13-2). The value of a historic asset reflects its significance and, therefore, its 
sensitivity to change. 
13.4.11 The Cadw document Conservation Principles (Ref. 13.10) offers further 
complementary guidance relating to the assessment of asset value. It states that 
cultural heritage significance is based upon a set of prescribed values: aesthetic; 
communal; historic; and evidential. In order to identify the heritage value of an 
asset, its history, fabric, and character must first be understood. The relative 
significance of the different values then needs to be considered. It will be necessary 
Abergelli ES 2018 – CHAPTER 13: HISTORIC ENVIRONMENT 
 
Prepared for:  Abergelli Power Limited  
AECOM 
13-13 
 
to compare the values of the asset under consideration with others in the locality, 
region or even nationally, depending on its importance.

h) Setting of historic assets 
13.4.14 The principles of historic setting are expressed in a number of planning-related 
documents, including for Wales within Conservation Principles and the Setting of 
Historic Assets in Wales (Ref. 13.10 and Ref. 13.11). The latter also sets out a 
staged approach for the assessment of the impact of change or development within 
the setting of historic assets, as follows:  
 Stage 1: Identify the historic assets that might be affected by a proposed 
change or development; 
 Stage 2: Define and analyse the settings to understand how they contribute to 
the significance of the historic assets and, in particular, the ways in which the 
assets are understood, appreciated and experienced;  
 Stage 3: Evaluate the potential impact of a proposed change or development 
on that significance; and 
 Stage 4: If necessary, consider options to mitigate or improve the potential 
impact of a proposed change or development on that significance. 
13.4.15 Beyond these broad guidelines on process, there is no detailed methodology 
prescribed for the assessment of visual impacts on cultural heritage assets in 
Wales. 
13.4.16 Factors that may contribute to the setting of a historic asset include: 
 Functional and physical relationships with other structures/historic assets and 
how these have changed over time; 
 Topographic features that influenced its location;  
 Physical character of the surrounding landscape or townscape, including any 
formal design or land use; 
 The original layout of the historic asset and how this has changed; 
 Potential buried or archaeological elements surrounding the historic asset; 
 Views to, from and across the historic asset or place; 
 Formal or planned vistas; 
 The prominence of the historic asset in views throughout the surrounding area 
 Views associated with the aesthetic, functional or ceremonial purpose of the 
asset; for example, defensive sites, beacons or designed landscapes; 
 Historical, artistic, literary, place name, cultural or scenic associations might all 
contribute to the significance of a historic asset;  
Abergelli ES 2018 – CHAPTER 13: HISTORIC ENVIRONMENT 
 
Prepared for:  Abergelli Power Limited  
AECOM 
13-16 
 
 Other sensory elements — noise or smell associated with the historic asset; 
and 
 Tranquillity, remoteness, ‘wildness’.  
13.4.17 In respect of setting, Cadw guidelines laid out within the Setting of Historic Assets 
in Wales (Ref. 13.11) suggest that impacts be ascribed a positive, neutral or 
negative description with varying degrees of magnitude. Within this assessment, 
the same categories for magnitude of harm are applied as for all other effects 
(Table 13-3). 
13.5 
Baseline Environment 
13.5.1 The following sections describe the archaeological and historical context of the 1 
km and 5 km Study Areas and the known sites within it. Full details are contained in 
the cultural heritage gazetteer (Appendix 13.1) and the assets are shown on 
Figures 13.1 and 13.2. 
13.5.2 In the following discussion, the following asset identity codes (IDs) are used: 
 Five digit IDs with a letter suffix (w) are Primary Record Numbers (PRNs) 
recorded in the GGAT HER; 
 Five or six digit IDs without a letter suffix are National Primary Record Numbers 
(NPRNs) of the NMR;  
 Numbers preceded by the letters ‘LB’ are Listed Buildings;  
 Numbers prefixed by the letters ‘GM’ are Scheduled Monuments; and 
 Numbers prefixed by the letters ‘AB’ (for Abergelli) are new assets identified by 
the present assessment. 
13.5.3 Table 13-5 summarises the number of historic assets within the Project Site, and 
within the 1 km and 5 km Study Areas.

13-17 
 
a) Palaeolithic and Mesolithic (1,000,000 – 4000 BC) 
13.5.4 Evidence for human activity during the Palaeolithic period is extremely sparse 
across Wales as a whole, with the principal find sites being concentrated on the 
Carboniferous Limestone zone of the south-west coast and north-east Wales. The 
known settlement sites in South Wales have been discovered within caves, with no 
open sites yet recognised. The coast of Gower has yielded several very significant 
sites, but there is nothing known closer to the Study Area, nor have any stray finds 
been recovered locally. Although the Mesolithic period is somewhat better 
represented across Wales as a whole, known sites in South East Wales are once 
again concentrated in coastal areas, with few discoveries made in inland locations. 
No Mesolithic sites or finds are known within the Study Areas (Ref. 13.14). 
b) Neolithic and Bronze Age (4000 – 700 BC) 
13.5.5 The Neolithic period in Britain is differentiated from the preceding Mesolithic by the 
onset of a series of profound social, technological, and economic changes. The 
period coincides with the first domestication of animals and of cereal cultivation, 
and is accompanied by changes in material culture, including the development of 
ceramics and new lithic typologies. It was also a time when long-distance 
connections developed across Britain, Ireland and mainland Europe, alongside 
mechanisms of long-distance exchange, principally of lithic artefacts (Ref. 13.15 
and Ref. 13.16). From this period the evidence for human activity increases 
significantly across Wales, and it becomes possible to discuss the Study Areas 
specifically, as opposed to merely the broader regional pattern.  
13.5.6 Neolithic communities were the first to leave their mark prominently on the 
landscape through the construction of monuments, which have traditionally 
dominated interpretations of the period. The emergence of monumental 
architecture provides evidence for new forms of social organisation and complexity, 
including ritualised mortuary activity involving formal burial deposition, ceremonial 
practices and the construction of social and cultural identities. The range of 
monument types present in South Wales is narrower than in areas such as 
Wessex, but its uplands are characterised by numerous, highly visible Neolithic and 
Bronze Age funerary and ritual monuments – principally but not exclusively in the 
form of cairns (Ref. 13.17). The majority of cairns were funerary monuments, 
although some may have served as memorials or have marked territorial 
boundaries. Very many appear to have been located for dramatic effect, often on 
ridge crests or on the saddle of hills close to well-travelled paths (Ref. 13.18 and 
Ref. 13.19). Others had utilitarian origins, having been formed by field clearance for 
agriculture: however, dating these latter features is difficult and some could 
plausibly relate to more recent times. 
13.5.7 Within the Study Areas there are five cairns of presumed Neolithic to Bronze Age 
date that are designated as Scheduled Monuments. All are shown on Figure 13.2. 
These comprise a ring cairn on Craig Fawr (SM GM380), Pant-y-Ffa Round Cairn 
(SM GM201), Mynydd Pysgodlyn Round Barrow (SM GM202), Garn Goch Round 
Barrow (SM GM199), and a ring cairn on Tor Clawdd (SM GM353). The visual 
interrelationship of such monuments is a well-established theory as a key to 
Abergelli ES 2018 – CHAPTER 13: HISTORIC ENVIRONMENT 
 
Prepared for:  Abergelli Power Limited  
AECOM 
13-18 
 
understanding their positioning within the landscape. A study of a stone alignment 
at Bancbryn, located approximately 3 km north of Tor Clawdd (8 km from Project; 
not illustrated), posits (but cannot prove) that the inter-visibility between those 
stones and Hartland Point, on the north Devon Coast, is significant. Incorporated 
into this alignment is Tor Clawdd, which is framed to the left side of the Hartland 
Point (Ref. 13.20). 
13.5.8 There is no evidence for contemporary settlement within the Study Areas. 
c) Iron Age (700 BC – AD 43) 
13.5.9 The society that emerged in the Late Bronze Age and Iron Age was markedly 
different from its predecessor. The emergence of the hillfort points to a changing 
emphasis in the settlement pattern and to a radically altered social dynamic.   
13.5.10 Although hillforts are the dominant monument of the period within the modern 
landscape, they are known to have existed in conjunction with wider undefended 
rural settlement, of which traces are mostly ephemeral and easily destroyed by 
cultivation. As Lynch et al. comment, ‘though overshadowed by the hillforts, the 
lightly enclosed or open farmstead must have shared a close relationship with their 
more impressive counterparts’ (Ref. 13.18). Given this situation, it is reasonable to 
assume some level of settlement in the area, although its character and location 
remains unknown. 
13.5.11 A probable Iron Age site is located within the 1 km Study Areas, located 1.5 km to 
the west of the Project Site, as shown in Figure 13.1 and 13.2. This is Scheduled 
Monument (SM GM308), which comprises an oval enclosure measuring c. 90 m x 
60 m, defined by a wide earthen bank that stands up to 1 m high in places. Its date 
is unproven but its morphology suggests it belongs to the Iron Age, with either a 
defensive and/or settlement function. The monument, now standing within 
woodland, is well preserved and retains considerable archaeological potential. 
d) Roman (AD 43 – AD 410) 
13.5.12 The Study Areas are removed from the main framework of Roman forts and roads 
in the region, which developed during the conquest of South Wales between 47 
and 77 AD (Ref. 13.21 and 13.22). Forts were established at Coelbren, Neath, 
Loughor and Carmarthen, connected by a road network that can, in part, still be 
traced in the modern landscape (Ref. 13.23). The remains of two Roman practice 
camps are known within the 5 km Study Area, 4.6 km south of the Project Site, on 
Mynydd Carn Goch (SM GM269).  
13.5.13 A re-analysis of the rural evidence may challenge the widely held belief that the 
indigenous population was largely untouched by the Romans (Ref. 13.24). 
However, identifiably Roman sites are entirely absent from the 1 km Study Area, 
although a continuity of native occupation must be assumed throughout this period 
and into the immediate post-Roman era.

e) 
Medieval (AD 410 – AD 1540) 
13.5.14 The early medieval period in South Wales is broadly characterised by the 
emergence of distinct regional kingdoms, and of Christianity, with the possibility of 
some level of Viking depredation (Ref. 13.21). Archaeologically, the period is very 
poorly evidenced, and no settlement sites of this era are known within the Study 
Areas – although it is possible that some Anglo-Norman and medieval Welsh sites 
may have earlier origins. One possible monument belonging to this period is the 
base of a stone cross within Llangyfelach churchyard, 1.7 km south of the Project 
Site (SM GM299). Though not precisely dated, stylistically it would appear to 
belong to the early medieval period. 
13.5.15 Evidence from the later medieval period in South Wales (i.e. after the Norman 
Conquest of the region) is far more abundant. No certain medieval sites are known 
within the Project Site or 1 km Study Area, but Pen y Fedw (PRN 01525w) is 
suggested to have its origins in the 14th century (Ref. 13.25), although the evidence 
supporting this assertion is unclear. Assuming some degree of continuity, some of 
the other post-medieval farms in the district could reasonably be assumed to have 
earlier origins.  
13.5.16 Within the 5 km Study Area, the scheduled earthwork known as Cae Castell is 
probably medieval in date and, on the basis of its place-name, quite possibly 
defensive in character (SM GM439). Meanwhile, the tower of the St David’s church, 
Llangyfelach, is the likely standing remains of a former 14th-century church that 
stood within the curtilage of the present churchyard (LB 26236). 
13.5.17 The present-day agricultural field pattern was largely established by the beginning 
of the 18th century, as evidenced by the 2”:1 mile map of Glamorgan and 
Monmouthshire (1812-14; Ref. 13.26). Of particular interest on this map are the 
hedgerows identified in this assessment as AB03 and AB04, both of which are 
within the Project Site. The date at which the field pattern as a whole began to 
develop is not known, but it is possible that some parts may have medieval origins. 
f) Post-medieval (AD 1540 – AD 1901) 
13.5.18 Within the 1 km Study Area, the earliest forms of post-medieval remains appear to 
be predominately of domestic and agricultural purpose. One example (albeit 
immediately outside the 1 km Study Area) is Cynghordy Fawr (PRN 02750w), 
which is located in the north-east of the Study Area. This building is fairly typical of 
the architectural style of this period, comprising a 17th-century longhouse with a 
courtyard and further ranges including a stable block and granary. 
13.5.19 George Yates’ Map of Glamorgan, dated 1799 (Ref. 13.27), shows ‘Abergelly Fach’ 
(AB02) as an isolated farm building, disconnected from a north/south aligned lane 
that cuts across the north-western corner of the Project Site. A map of 
Glamorganshire (1812-14, Ref. 13.26) depicts the same farm as comprising two 
north-east/south-west aligned rectangular buildings set within their own grounds, 
and connected to the existing north/south aligned lane via a short driveway. To the 
east of AB02 is the farmstead of ‘Abergelly-fawr’ (AB01), featuring at least two 
buildings and an associated connecting lane to the north. The remaining land is 
Abergelli ES 2018 – CHAPTER 13: HISTORIC ENVIRONMENT 
 
Prepared for:  Abergelli Power Limited  
AECOM 
13-20 
 
shown as an enclosed field system, which includes boundaries AB03 and AB04, 
located immediately north of Abergelly-fach.  
13.5.20 By the time of the surveying of the Llangyfelach Tithe Map of 1838 (Ref. 13.28), 
new field boundaries had been created and the fields made smaller and more 
irregular in shape. Boundaries AB03 and AB04 remained intact, forming the 
southern boundary of three irregular fields to the east of ‘Abergelly fach’ (AB01). 
The field systems depicted on the tithe map can also been seen on OS map of 
1883-1884 (Ref. 13.29). By this time ‘Abergelli-fach’ (AB02) had expanded, 
comprising a farmstead of at least six buildings. The most significant development 
is the establishment of a large plantation in the south-east of the Project Site 
boundary. The subsequent OS edition of 1897 (Ref. 13.30) names the plantation as 
‘Abergelli-fach Plantation’. A quarry (PRN 01349w) is depicted for the first time, and 
is labelled as a ‘gravel pit’ immediately south-west of AB02.  
13.5.21 In the early post-medieval period the population of the larger Swansea area began 
to decline as the administrative centre for the region moved to Cardiff (Ref. 13.31). 
This decline reversed in the early 18th century as the transport of materials for use 
in industry such as coal and metals along the River Tawe became essential. The 
River Tawe was a vital trade route during the 18th and 19th centuries at the time 
when Swansea became renowned as a copper smelting centre with such works as 
the Hafod Copperworks (PRN 05956w) and the Landore Copperworks (PRN 
01586w). Swansea’s copper industry rose to prominence in the 18th century. 
Llangyfelach Copperworks (NPRN 34094), established in 1717, was the first of the 
major Swansea copperworks; its site is located beyond the 5 km Study Area, at the 
junction of Cwm Level Road and Neath Road to the north of Landore viaduct (Ref. 
13.32).  
13.5.22 No copper-working sites are known within the 1 km Study Area, but several sites 
attest to the supporting coal-mining industries which grew up in Swansea’s 
hinterland. Collieries established during this period within the Study Area include 
Bryn Whilach Colliery (PRN 01340w) and an unnamed colliery at Mawr (PRN 
01345w).  
13.5.23 Industrial transport networks are also evidenced. In 1798, the Swansea Canal was 
opened, serving to increase the industrial capacity of the area, such that at one 
stage in the 19th century, three quarters of the world’s copper ore was being 
transported to Swansea for processing (Ref. 13.33). The century following the 
canal’s construction saw the city’s population grow from approximately 10,000 
people to 95,000 people. Transport routes were established over land not only to 
supply the copperworks with raw materials but also to link the mines and collieries 
with the works and ports. Within the 1 km Study Area these include a tramroad 
(PRN 05950.0w) linking Bryn-whilach and Pen-rhiwfelen coal pits to Clydach Road, 
a mineral railway (PRN 03017.0w) situated within the community of Llangyfelach, 
and now a dismantled railway (PRN 02916.0w) serving Felindre Pit on the east side 
of the Lliw Valley.

13.5.24 Due to the availability of cheaper copper and coal from overseas, the industrial 
prosperity of the South Wales region began to decline in the early 20th century (Ref. 
13.32). Throughout this period Swansea still remained a centre of industry within 
South Wales, with a population at the time of the outbreak of World War II of 
167,000 people (Ref. 13.35). The Velindre works (PRN 02905w; 0.8 km south of 
the Project Site) was built as part of a post-war development programme begun 
after the Steel Company of Wales was formed in 1947. In 1952 the company 
started work on the construction of a cold reduction and electrolytic tinning plant at 
the site near Llangyfelach. The Velindre works began production in October 1956. 
The main building, the Mill Bay, was of very significant size: 1440 ft long, 100 ft 
wide and 66 ft high. It was closed down in September 1989 and its buildings were 
subsequently demolished. 
13.5.25 One historic asset immediately to the west of the Project Site originates in this 
period: Abergelli Colliery (NPRN 80607). When first shown on the OS map of 1931 
(Ref. 13.36), it comprised a water tank, engine houses, a slant (slanted shaft), and 
a tramway or railway following a course from the slant to a slag heap at the north 
end of the colliery site. The colliery worked the Four Feet and Graigola (also known 
as the Brynwhilach) coal seams and was a registered colliery from 1926 to 1960 
The owner, up to nationalisation, was the Graigola Merthyr Co. Ltd and it was 
worked in association with Clydach Merthyr Colliery located at Craig Cefn Parc, 
approximately 2.5 km north-east of the Project Site (Ref. 13.37). 
13.5.26 Aerial photographs of the area taken in 1970 (Ref. 13.38) show the addition of an 
electrical substation to the south-west of Abergelli Farm. The next significant 
changes to the Project Site are shown on aerial photographs taken in 2008; these 
reflect the construction of the Felindre Gas Compressor Station. The photographs 
show that the works included the installation of the Oil Pipeline from the road to the 
north of Abergelli farm, traversing the fields to the east and south of the farm, to the 
Substation, which extends over much of the Abergelli fach Plantation. As a part of 
this development, a section of historic field boundary AB03 was removed for the 
pipeline easement. 
13.5.27 Aerial photographs of 2010 show this complex being extended southwards. By 
2015, much of the land to the east of the farm had been utilised for solar panels 
(Ref. 13.38). 
h) Historic landscape characterisation 
13.5.28 The Project Site area lies in Landmap Historic Landscape Aspect Area H27 (Gower 
Supraboscus Agricultural). This is characterised by an irregular fieldscape with 
hedgerows and hedgebanks, reflecting a history of gradual and piecemeal 
enclosure in the valleys and foothills throughout the medieval and post-medieval 
periods. There is some evidence for enclosure in the pre-Norman period, and the 
process continued into the second half of the 19th century. Some unenclosed land 
and woodland remains. Limited industrial activity (mainly mining) also took place 
here in the 19th century and has left residual traces in the landscape. The 
Abergelli ES 2018 – CHAPTER 13: HISTORIC ENVIRONMENT

AECOM 
13-22 
 
settlement pattern is 
predominantly of dispersed character, but ribbon 
developments occur in areas of former industrial activity. 
i) Previous Investigations 
13.5.29 A watching brief was undertaken by Cambrian Archaeological Projects (Ref. 13.39) 
during groundworks associated with the construction of a high pressure gas 
pipeline between Felindre and Brecon. The watching brief was carried out within 
part of the Project Site through the fields to the east of Abergelli Farm. A single pit 
was noted and revealed evidence of in situ burning, which was potentially the 
remains of a hearth or furnace. It measured 1.5 m in diameter and was 0.2 m in 
depth. No date was ascertained for this feature. The site of this feature was located 
to the south of Abergelli farm at NGR SN 65136 01433, approximately 100 m 
outside of the Project Site.   
13.5.30 Archaeological watching briefs undertaken by Cotswold Archaeology during the 
construction of the Oil Pipeline in the northern extent of the Project Site revealed 
two undated charcoal spreads. Elsewhere, two pits with charcoal and burnt stone 
were exposed, and were associated with a spread of burnt material containing two 
worked, undated, flints. An evaluation at Waun y Garnwen, forming part of the 
same scheme of works, recorded four probable former field boundaries (Ref. 
13.40).  
13.5.31 A geophysical survey in the area immediately to the east of the Project Site was 
undertaken in advance of the installation of a solar energy farm. The works 
identified probable soil-filled features in most of the survey areas, and concluded 
that although some of the anomalies were weak or diffuse, most have potential to 
reflect the remains of archaeological features (Ref. 13.41). 
13.5.32 On the south-east fringe of the 1 km Study Area, a watching brief was undertaken 
by Oxford Archaeology within the grounds of Morriston Hospital prior to the 
development of new parking facilities. A linear field boundary and ornamental 
features relating to the garden of the former Maes y Gwernen Hall were recorded 
(Ref. 13.42). 
13.6 
Embedded Mitigation 
13.6.1 As detailed in Chapter 3: Project and Site Description, a number of embedded 
mitigation measures have been identified through the iterative EIA process and 
have been incorporated into the design and construction planning of the Project.   
13.6.2 As these mitigation measures have been embedded into the design of the Project, 
are legal requirements or are standard practices that will be implemented, the 
assessment of likely significant effects assumes that they are in place.

13.7 
Assessment of Effects 
13.7.1 This section presents the findings of the historic environment assessment for the 
construction, operation and decommissioning phases of the Project. 
a) 
Construction 
13.7.2 This section identifies any likely significant effects that are predicted to occur and 
Section 13.8 highlights the additional mitigation and monitoring measures that are 
proposed to reduce or eliminate the identified significant effects. 
13.7.3 All impacts discussed in relation to construction are those of a physical character. 
No impacts on setting are predicted. 
i. 
Power Generation Plant 
13.7.4 Construction of the Power Generation Plant will not have a physical impact on any 
known historic asset. No known historic assets exist within its footprint. 
ii. Gas Connection 
13.7.5 Construction of the Gas Connection will not have a significant physical impact on 
any known historic asset.  
13.7.6 The Gas Pipeline will cross the line of historic boundary AB03, necessitating the 
removal of a portion of this feature for the width of the pipe easement. However, 
only a small percentage of this feature is affected – and this was substantially 
altered when the preceding Oil Pipeline was installed, with little of the original 
historic fabric remaining. A negligible magnitude of impact on this low value asset is 
anticipated. This will result in a Negligible effect which is not signficant. 
13.7.7 The easement for the Gas Pipeline will also run parallel to historic boundary AB04, 
which coincides with the western limit of the Project Site boundary. However, this 
feature is 25 m from the Gas Pipeline centreline, and thus beyond the limits of the 
pipe easement. There will be no effect upon this feature.

iii. Electrical Connection 
13.7.8 Construction of the Electrical Connection will not have a physical impact on any 
known historic asset. No known historic assets exist within its footprint. 
iv. Unknown Archaeology 
13.7.9 As described above, a number of archaeological interventions have been carried 
out within the 1 km Study Area, and one within the Project Site. The findings of 
these suggest that there is some potential for the discovery of buried 
archaeological remains. However, given the sporadic and isolated nature of these 
recorded features, and their likely character, there is a low probability of 
Abergelli ES 2018 – CHAPTER 13: HISTORIC ENVIRONMENT 
 
Prepared for:  Abergelli Power Limited  
AECOM 
13-24 
 
encountering buried archaeological remains of high value during the construction 
works. 
b) 
Operation  
13.7.10 Impacts upon below-ground archaeological remains will only arise if significant 
ground disturbance is anticipated during the operational phase of the Project. As no 
such activity is envisaged, there will be no further impact upon below ground 
archaeological remains once the Project is operational.  Maintenance activities are 
unlikely to require significant ground disturbance. 
13.7.11 Within this ES, the assessment of effects upon the setting of historic assets draws 
upon the Project ZTV, the Landscape and Visual Assessment (LVA) as presented in 
Chapter 12: Landscape and Visual of this ES, and supporting viewpoint graphics. 
The assessment has also included field visits to selected archaeological sites, 
historic buildings and areas, these being chosen on the basis of: a) higher 
significance (e.g. Scheduled Monuments, Listed Buildings, historic parks and 
gardens, and Conservation Areas); b) proximity to the Project; c) location within the 
Project ZTV; d) identification as a concern during stakeholder consultation. 
13.7.12 The assessment followed the four-stage process set out by Cadw (Ref 13.11; see 
para. 13.4.11). In the single instance where an impact upon setting was identified, 
the significance of effects was quantified as per Table 13-4. 
i. 
Power Generation Plant 
13.7.13 Operation of the Power Generation Plant will not have a physical impact on any 
known historic asset. 
13.7.14 Of the various elements of the Project, only the Power Generation Plant introduces 
any alteration in respect of the settings of historic assets, as follows. 
Conservation Areas 
13.7.15 Of the two conservation areas within the 5 km Study Area, only one lies within the 
ZTV for the Project: Llansamlet Conservation Area (CA027). The ZTV suggests that 
the stack of the Power Generation Plant will be visible from some of the northerly 
parts of the conservation area. However, the landscape between the Project Site 
and the conservation area has been extensively developed, including the Swansea 
Enterprise Park and the M4 motorway. Thus, despite bringing about a minor 
change to north-eastward views from the conservation area, neither its setting, nor 
those of the listed buildings within it, will be adversely affected by the Power 
Generation Plant. There is no effect on the conservation area.  
Registered Historic Parks and Gardens 
13.7.16 Of the three Registered Historic Parks and Gardens within the 5 km Study Area, 
only one lies within the ZTV for the Project: Penllergaer Park and Garden (GM054). 
The Project is theoretically visible from within a small area of this registered park. 
However, the park and its constituent elements are well screened by woodland on 
its northern and eastern margins. Moreover, the park and Project Site are 
separated by the M4 motorway and surrounding urban and industrial development. 
Abergelli ES 2018 – CHAPTER 13: HISTORIC ENVIRONMENT 
 
Prepared for:  Abergelli Power Limited  
AECOM 
13-25 
 
As such, the park’s setting will not be adversely affected by the Power Generation 
Plant. There is no effect on Penllergaer Park and Garden.  
Scheduled Monuments and Listed Buildings  
13.7.17 A number of Scheduled Monuments and listed buildings fall within the ZTV for the 
Project, and their settings are therefore potentially subject to change. However, as 
described below, where visual changes will occur this does not necessarily equate 
to an adverse impact, whether because of the limited extent of visibility of the 
Project, the attributes of setting, the existing quality of setting, or a combination of 
these factors. In some cases, setting may not contribute to the significance of an 
asset. Various assets are discussed below for which no impact is predicted – this 
being done in order to demonstrate the reasoning behind the outcome of the 
assessment. 
13.7.18 The ZTV also demonstrates that certain key monuments will not be in the viewshed 
of the Project. These include several prehistoric monuments for which the visual 
environment is particularly important: the ring cairns on Tor Clawydd (SM GM353) 
and Craig Fawr (SM GM380); Garn Goch round barrow (SM GM199); and the 
Pant-y-Ffa round cairn (SM GM201). These assets will be unaffected by the 
Project.  
13.7.19 Within the settlement of Penllergaer there are four listed buildings from which the 
Project Site will be visible. These relate to Bryn-rhos Farm, are located within a 
single cluster 3.6 km south-west of the Project Site, and are all Grade II-listed 
(LB26496-99). This group of buildings was listed as a little-altered 19th-century 
estate farm group. As such, the primary focus of their setting is their functional 
inter-relationship with each other and adjoining buildings. The setting of this asset 
group will be unaffected by the Power Generation Plant and there will be no impact 
upon this group of farm buildings. 
13.7.20 To the north of Penllegaer is the Grade II-listed Penderi Fawr Farmhouse and 
attached cowhouse (LB26257; 2.4 km south-west of the Project Site). This modular 
building was listed due to it being a good example of a surviving 17th-century 
farmhouse built on the unit system. The immediate physical and functional 
relationship of these adjoining structures are key attributes of their setting, their 
wider environment of setting having been wholly compromised by the construction 
of the M4 motorway, McDonald’s restaurant and the Moto Services less than 100 m 
away. The Power Generation Plant, although theoretically visible, will be a minor 
addition to the north-eastern views from the farm and will not cause any further 
adverse effects to its setting. 
13.7.21 To the south-west of the Project Site (1.2 km) are two connected Grade II Listed 
Buildings: LB19983 (Tredegar Fawr); and LB19984 (Lofted Pigsty at Tredegar 
Fawr). These buildings were listed as being of historical interest due to their 
connection with the locally-important Morris family. The significant factor in the 
setting of these assets lies with their historical associations and their physical and 
functional relationships with each other, which will not be diminished by the Project, 
rather than in far-reaching views. Moreover, the outward views from these assets 
Abergelli ES 2018 – CHAPTER 13: HISTORIC ENVIRONMENT 
 
Prepared for:  Abergelli Power Limited  
AECOM 
13-26 
 
have already been substantially affected by the Felindre Goods Depot (01229.10w) 
and the Velindre Works (02905w), as well as the construction of the M4 motorway. 
On all of these grounds, therefore, the Power Generation Plant will not alter the 
setting of these assets and there will be no impact caused by the Project. 
13.7.22 To the north of the Project Site (2.9 km) is Scheduled Monument GM202 (Mynydd 
Pysgodlyn Round Barrow). As a Neolithic/Bronze Age funerary and ritual 
monument, its topographic setting and visual interrelationships with contemporary 
sites are deemed significant elements of its setting. The Project will be visible from 
this location, but the views from, and including, this monument will not be 
significantly changed. As demonstrated by LVA Viewpoint 5, the Power Generation 
Plant will be an extremely minor element of the viewshed, in which a substantial 
quantity of modern development is already present. An important attribute of the 
setting of this type of upland prehistoric monument is its sense of isolation. While 
the Project will be visible, marginally adding to the massing of modern elements to 
the south, the extent of additional change is very small and the intervening distance 
means that this sense of remoteness is maintained. No historic sightlines or visual 
connections with other monuments will be affected. The magnitude of effect is 
therefore considered to be no more than negligible. On an asset of high value, this 
results in a significance of effect of minor adverse, and therefore not significant 
(Table 13-7). 
13.7.23 There are a number of assets in the settlement of Llangyfelach, 1.8 km south of the 
Project Site. These lie within the Project ZTV and comprise: 
 GM229 (Llangyfelach Cross Base);  
 LB 26235, Grade II* (The Church of St David and St Cyfelach); and 
 LB 26236, Grade II* (Tower of the Church of St David). 
13.7.24 The Scheduled Monument and the Grade II* Listed Buildings form a cluster within a 
walled churchyard located near the centre of Llangyfelach. The assets have strong 
functional associations and represent the continual use of land for religious activity 
since the medieval period. The integrity of the tower (LB26236) and church 
(LB26235) have been retained, despite repairs and modifications in the modern 
period to LB26236. The assets are located within an extensive graveyard, partially 
enclosed by a stone wall with mature trees to the west and north (see LVA 
Viewpoint 11). The setting of this group is essentially inward-looking, with little 
reference to the modern urban environment that surrounds it. The Power 
Generation Plant, while theoretically visible, will be an extremely minor addition to 
existing views; the modern urban development is dominant, and thus the Power 
Generation Plant’s effect upon these assets’ setting is considered neutral.

ii. Gas Connection 
13.7.25 Operation of the Gas Connection will not have an impact upon on any known 
historic asset. 
iii. Electrical Connection 
13.7.26 Operation of the Electrical Connection will not have an impact upon on any known 
historic asset. 
iv. Unknown archaeology 
13.7.27 Operation and maintenance of the Project will not have any impact on unknown 
archaeology. 
c) 
Decommissioning 
13.7.28 The decommissioning of the Project will not require the disturbance of previously 
undisturbed ground or the demolition of any standing historic asset. As a 
consequence, there will be no physical effect on archaeology or cultural heritage 
during the decommissioning phase. 
13.7.29 The Minor Adverse effect on the setting of scheduled monument GM202 will cease 
to exist after decommissioning. 
13.8 
Mitigation and Monitoring  
13.8.1 As a general rule, additional mitigation measures have been proposed where a 
significant effect is predicted to occur. Embedded mitigation measures, which have 
been incorporated within the design of the Project or are standard practice 
measures that have been committed to are summarised in Chapter 3: Project and 
Site Description. Mitigation is inherent within the final design proposals in order to 
prevent or reduce direct and indirect impacts and effects on heritage assets. 
13.8.2 This section describes the proposed additional mitigation measures for the 
archaeology and cultural heritage assessment, beyond that described in embedded 
mitigation, Chapter 3: Project and Site Description.  
13.8.3 This section also describes any required monitoring regimes, including monitoring 
of specific receptors/resources, or monitoring the effectiveness of a mitigation 
measure.  The requirements, scope, frequency, and duration of a given monitoring 
regime are set out, as far as possible, in this section. 
a) 
Mitigation 
13.8.4 There is a presumption in favour of preservation in situ of nationally important 
archaeological remains, whether scheduled or not. In some cases, unscheduled 
remains of local and regional importance will be considered worthy of preservation 
in situ. In these cases, the results of the assessment should influence the design of 
the development in order to protect a monument or remains. Proposals for 
enhancement may also be identified. 
Abergelli ES 2018 – CHAPTER 13: HISTORIC ENVIRONMENT 
 
Prepared for:  Abergelli Power Limited  
AECOM 
13-28 
 
13.8.5 Preservation ‘by record’ may also be considered as an option for mitigation. For 
buried archaeology this implies excavation, whilst standing features are recorded 
by a combination of drawn, photographic and written record. Preservation by record 
is normally considered a less satisfactory outcome for cultural heritage, since it 
presupposes loss of, or damage to, the feature in question.   
13.8.6 In respect of setting, Cadw guidelines for mitigating the impact of a development on 
the setting of a historic asset suggest that in the first instance impacts are best 
mitigated for either by relocation of the development or changes to its design or the 
introduction of screening. Where relocation of the development is not possible, 
good design alone may be capable of reducing the harm. 
i. 
Known historic assets 
13.8.7 The only identified effect on known historic assets is that upon the boundary of 
AB03. Given that this feature is subject to only a limited impact, is of low value and 
the section of boundary in question has already effectively been removed by 
previous development, no additional mitigation is proposed.  
ii. Unknown archaeology 
13.8.8 Previous investigations within the 1 km Study Area suggest that there is potential 
for archaeological features to be present. However, neither the results of this 
fieldwork, nor the findings of the current assessment, point towards the existence of 
significant or high value archaeological remains within the Project Site. 
13.8.9 In keeping with the other recent projects in the 1 km Study Area, an archaeological 
watching brief will be maintained on construction ground works which is included as 
embedded mitigation as set out in Chapter 3: Project and Site Description. This 
will apply to all areas subject to significant disturbance, unless scoped out due to 
existing conditions (e.g. made ground). No additional mitigation will be required. 
13.8.10 In the event that the watching brief reveals archaeological remains, sufficient time 
and resources will be allowed to ensure that these are adequately excavated, and 
recorded, and for samples to be taken if appropriate. Provision will also be made 
for post-excavation analysis and, if appropriate, publication of the results. 
iii. Effects upon setting 
13.8.11 Due to the scale of the Project, and the fact that it is the Power Generation Plant 
stack which introduces the principal changes to views, no additional mitigation is 
possible. The effects therefore remain as described above. 
b) 
Monitoring 
13.8.12 The watching brief will be subject to monitoring by GGAT. 
13.9 
Residual Effects 
13.9.1 The following tables present a summary of the residual effects identified by the 
archaeology and cultural heritage assessment.

13.9.2 With the mitigation measures implemented, it is not anticipated that there will be 
any significant residual adverse effects associated with the Power Generation 
Plant, Gas Connection or Electrical Connection relating to archaeology and cultural 
heritage.

Project ‘“in combination” Effects 
13.9.3 The predicted effects of the Power Generation Plant, Gas Connection and 
Electrical Connection upon known archaeology and cultural heritage are limited to 
those assets listed in Table 13-8 and Table 13-9. No other known assets will be 
affected. The combined effect upon known archaeology and cultural heritage from 
the whole project is therefore Negligible and not significant. 
13.10 Assessment of Effects on Historic Features (APFP Regulations 2009) 
13.10.1 Regulation 5(2)(m) of the Infrastructure Planning (Applications: Prescribed  Forms 
and Procedure) Regulations 2009 requires DCO applicants to provide, where 
applicable: 
“a plan with accompanying information identifying any statutory or non  statutory 
sites or features of the historic environment, including scheduled monuments, 
World Heritage sites, listed buildings and other historic structures, archaeological 
sites and registered battlefields, together with an assessment of any effects on 
such sites, features or structures likely to be caused by the proposed 
development.” 
13.10.2 The sites and features of the historic environment mentioned in regulation 5(2)(m) 
are shown on Figure 13.1 and Figure 13.2 and are listed in Appendix 13.1. 
Sections 13.7 to 13.9 of this chapter assess any potential effects of the Project on 
these features of the historic environment, and consider whether or not they are 
'significant' for EIA purposes. This EIA process, relative to cultural heritage and 
Abergelli ES 2018 – CHAPTER 13: HISTORIC ENVIRONMENT 
 
Prepared for:  Abergelli Power Limited  
AECOM 
13-30 
 
archaeology assessment, has determined that there are no effects anticipated on 
the setting of historic assets within the study areas resulting from the Project.  
13.11 Cumulative Effects 
a) Construction and Decommissioning 
i. 
Description of baseline where cumulative impacts expected 
13.11.1 It is considered that there is no potential for cumulative impacts on archaeology and 
cultural heritage receptors arising from construction of the Project in combination 
with other schemes. This is for the following reasons: 
 The direct residual effect of the Project on known archaeological remains is 
negligible, and therefore cannot not contribute in any meaningful way to any 
wider significant, comparable, losses to the cultural heritage resource; and 
 No effects upon the setting of historic assets are predicted. 
ii. Mitigation 
13.11.2 No mitigation is required. 
b) Operation 
i. 
Description of baseline where cumulative effects expected 
13.11.3 It is considered that there is no potential for significant cumulative impacts on 
archaeology and cultural heritage receptors as a result of operation of the Project in 
combination with other schemes. This is for the following reasons: 
 No physical effects upon known historic assets are predicted; and 
 Effects upon the setting of historic assets are limited to a single Scheduled 
Monument, for which the Project’s effect was classed as minor adverse. This 
monument is not affected by the other identified schemes. 
ii. Mitigation 
13.11.4 No mitigation is required.

Socio-Economics
14.1
Introduction
14.1.1 This chapter provides an assessment of the likely socio-economic effects arising
from construction, operation, maintenance and decommissioning of the Project.
14.1.2 A detailed description of the Project Site and the Project is provided in Chapter 3:
Project and Site Description. A glossary of terms and list of abbreviations used in
this chapter is provided in Document Reference 1.4. Appendix 14 includes further
detail to accompany this chapter.
a)
Objectives of the assessment
14.1.3 The objectives of the assessment were to assess the likely significant effects on the
labour market, tourism economy, and community infrastructure arising from the
construction; and the operation, maintenance and decommissioning phases of the
Project.
14.2
Changes since the 2014 PEIR
14.2.1 There have been changes to the Project design as a result of design evolution and
consultation as detailed in Chapter 3: Project and Site Description. To aid the
reader, Table 14-1 below outlines the changes to this assessment compared with
the 2014 and 2018 PIERs.

Reference
Baseline
Socio-economic: The socio-economic baseline was updated
for 2018 PEIR and has not been updated subsequently.
Tourism: Audit of tourism receptors updated with Paintball
Activity Centre added. Tourism volume and value data was
updated for the 2018 PEIR using most recently available
data at that time,
Community Infrastructure: Audit of community infrastructure
receptors was updated for 2018 PEIR using most recently
available data at that time.
Section 14.5
Methodology
Approach to assessing socio-economic and tourism, and
associated impacts is consistent with the 2014 and 2018
PEIR assessment.
Section 14.4
Significance
of Effect
No significant labour market or tourism and recreation or
community infrastructure
effects
are expected. This is
consistent with the 2014 and 2018 PEIR.

14.11
14.3
Legislation, policy and guidance
14.3.1 This section identifies and describes legislation, policy and guidance of relevance
to the assessment of the potential socio-economic impacts associated with the
construction, operation & maintenance and decommissioning of the Project.
Abergelli ES 2018 – CHAPTER 14: SOCIO-ECONOMICS
Prepared for: Abergelli Power Limited
AECOM
14-4
14.3.2 Legislation and policy has been considered on an international, national, regional,
and local level.  The following is considered to be relevant to the socio-economic
assessment as it has influenced the sensitivity of receptors and requirements for
mitigation or the scope and/or methodology of the ES.
a)
National Policy
14.3.3 National Policy Statement for Energy (Ref. 14.1) (NPS EN-1) acknowledges “the
construction, operation and decommissioning of energy infrastructure may have
socio-economic impacts at local and regional levels”. Paragraph 4.2.2 states that
the Secretary of State “will find it helpful if the applicant sets out information on the
likely significant social and economic effects of the development, and shows how
any likely significant negative effects would be avoided or mitigated. This
information could include matters such as employment, equality, community
cohesion and well-being.” Paragraphs 5.12.2 and 5.12.3 identify that where the
Project is likely to have socio-economic impacts at local or regional levels, the
Applicant should undertake and include in their application an assessment of
relevant socio-economic impacts, which may include: creation of jobs and training
opportunities; provision of additional local services and improvements to local
infrastructure including provision of educational and visitor facilities; effects on
tourism; the impacts of a changing influx of workers during different phases and
cumulative effects.
14.3.4 NPS EN-1 (Paragraph 5.12.7 and 5.12.8) further notes that in making a decision on
energy NSIPs, the Secretary of State may conclude that limited weight is to be
given to assertions of socio-economic impacts that are not supported by evidence
and may take into account positive provisions and mitigation such as planning
obligations and in particular options as to phasing the development in relation to
impacts.
14.3.5 NPS EN-2, Paragraph 1.72 details the benefits of a low carbon economy including
the likely “positive effects on the Economy and Skills, and Health and Well-being as
secondary benefits and positive effects in the medium/long term on climate
change.”
b)
Welsh Policy/Guidance
14.3.6 Planning Policy Wales (PPW), Edition 9 (Ref. 14.2), promotes sustainable
development and sets out a vision, some of which is relevant to this socio-
economic assessment, including at paragraph 4.1.4:
·
“A Prosperous Wales - An innovative, productive and low carbon society which
recognises the limits of the global environment and therefore uses resources
efficiently and proportionately (including acting on climate change); and which
develops a skilled and well-educated population in an economy which
generates wealth and provides employment opportunities, allowing people to
take advantage of the wealth generated through securing decent work”.
14.3.7 Chapter 7 of PPW defines economic development as “development of land and
buildings for activities that generate wealth, jobs and incomes”. Paragraph 7.1.1 of
Chapter 7 of PPW states that the construction and energy sectors are important to
the economy.
Abergelli ES 2018 – CHAPTER 14: SOCIO-ECONOMICS
Prepared for: Abergelli Power Limited
AECOM
14-5
14.3.8 Furthermore, Chapter 7 Paragraph 7.6.1 states that “local authorities should adopt
a positive and constructive approach to applications for economic development”.
PPW states that planning authority decisions should be based on a robust evidence
base and should take account of factors such as the number and types of job
created and whether a development enhances employment opportunities.
c)
Welsh Local Policy/Guidance
14.3.9 The City and County of Swansea Unitary Development Plan (Ref. 14.3) sets out
the plans and policies for development in the area, up to 2016. The goals relevant
to this chapter are, “help promote the sustainable growth of the local and regional
economy,” and “make more efficient and sustainable use of the area’s resources”.
14.3.10 The Swansea Local Development Plan (LDP) 2010-2025: Deposit Plan July 2016
(Ref. 14.4) outlines a number of strategic objectives for the area, including
delivering economic growth and prosperity and of particular relevance is the aim to
“facilitate growth and diversification of the local economy and an increase in high
value, skilled employment”. Policy IO 2 Employment and Training Opportunities
requires that developers maximise added benefits from developments through the
creation of jobs and training opportunities with particular focus on economically
inactive people. Chapter 2: Regulatory and Policy Background, Section 2.11.31
discusses the progress of the LDP examination and weight attributable to the LDP
policy.
14.4
Methodology
a)
Scope of the assessment
14.4.1 The scope of this assessment has been determined through a formal
Environmental Impact Assessment (EIA) scoping process undertaken with the
Planning Inspectorate on behalf of the SoS. Comments raised on the EIA Scoping
Report have been taken into account in the development of the assessment
methodology and these are detailed where relevant in this chapter. Responses to
the comments raised in the EIA Scoping Opinion and further consultation can be
found in Table 14-2.
b)
Consultation
14.4.2 The scope of the assessment has also been informed by ongoing consultation with
statutory consultees throughout the design and assessment process. The purpose
of this consultation was to: agree or refine a methodology; to secure relevant data;
to ensure accurate interpretation of relevant policy; and to enable stakeholder
views to inform the assessment.
14.4.3 A summary of the comments raised and responses are detailed in Table 14-2.

From our perspective, we would be
particularly
interested in impacts
being assessed at two geographical
levels
– “City 
and 
County 
of
Swansea” 
(the 
local 
authority
boundary area) and the “Swansea
Bay City Region” (encompassing
the four local authority areas of
Carmarthenshire, Neath Port Talbot,
Pembrokeshire,
and 
Swansea
areas) – in addition to the study
areas 
you 
have 
defined.
Our
Unitary/Local 
Development 
Plan
and 
the 
economic 
regeneration
strategy we have adopted relate to
these two areas respectively.
The socio-economic
study area is defined
as the area within a
60-minute drive time
of the Project Site.
Direct employment
impacts are unlikely
to occur outside this
area. This study area
does however cover
the vast majority of
the Swansea Bay
City Region. See

In relation to labour market impacts,
we 
would 
wish 
to 
see 
the
professional skills profile of the jobs
created during the construction and
operational phases to better gauge
the Project’s employment value, as
well 
as 
identify 
opportunities
locally/regionally 
for 
developing
suitably skilled people to compete
for 
jobs 
created 
by 
the
Project.
Also, 
will 
the
Project
provide opportunities for people to
obtain work experience, training, or
apprenticeships?
An assessment of
construction skills is
provided in Section
14.7.
The Applicant aims to
provide mechanisms
to deliver an

in the local area.
Beyond visual impacts on sectors,
and in addition to labour market and
any specific community economic
impacts, we would be interested in
potential 
economic 
impacts 
on
businesses 
and 
particularly 
on
relevant 
supply

providers in Swansea, the City
Region, and the other study area.

c)
Defining the Baseline
14.4.4 The study area’s socio-economic position (provided in Section 14.4(g)) has been
described using standard indicators, such as population, economic activity, skills,
education, and availability of relevant workforce. This provides a baseline from
which potential impacts can be assessed, as follows:
·
Economic/Labour Market: The area has been defined using a combination of
2001 (Ref. 14.5) and 2011 (Ref. 14.6) Census data, indicators research
available at study area level, and research into the business and labour market
structure of the local economy;
·
Tourism: The area’s visitor attraction has been profiled including, visitor
attractions; visitor accommodation; tourism volume and value; and the local
tourism economy (based on Welsh Government and VisitWales data); and
·
Community Infrastructure:
The
area’s demographic structure has
been
examined.  An audit of community infrastructure has been prepared (para.
14.5.13).
d)
Assessment of Socio-economic Effects
14.4.5 A detailed assessment of likely effects on the local, regional, and national economy
has been prepared. The assessment is consistent with HM Treasury Green Book
Appraisal Guidance (Ref. 14.7) and the Homes and Communities Agency (HCA)
Additionality Guide (Ref 14.8).
14.4.6 The assessment evaluates the scale of:
·
Direct economic impacts: Jobs and Gross Value Added (GVA) that are wholly
or largely related to construction, operation and decommissioning of the
Project;
·
Indirect economic impacts (beneficial and adverse): Jobs and GVA generated
in the study area in the chain of suppliers of goods and services to the direct
activities;
·
Induced economic impacts: Jobs and GVA created by direct and indirect
employees’ spending in the study area or in the wider economy; and
·
Wider economic (catalytic) impacts (beneficial and adverse): Employment and
income generated in the economy related to the wider role of the Project in
influencing economic activities (including wider socio-economic effects).
14.4.7 The availability of appropriate labour and skills to meet the Project’s construction
and operational requirements is a critical consideration in examining economic
impacts. Adequate capacity results in a low sensitivity to economic impacts while a
shortfall or constrained capacity yields a high sensitivity.
14.4.8 The key socio-economic indicators for the study area include:
·
The proportion of skilled workers in the study area relative to national
averages;
·
Educational attainment levels compared with national averages;
·
The proportion of employment in relevant sectors (i.e. manufacturing and
construction workers) in the study area;
·
The availability of labour (including the unemployed workforce); and
·
Relevant education and training provision, including existing and proposed
programmes provided by institutions serving the study area.

e)
Assessment of Tourism Effects
14.4.9 Tourism behaviour will only be detrimentally affected where the effects of the
Project either change the visitor or user patterns in terms of numbers, and/or their
patterns of expenditure for the worse. As such, opportunities for tourist and visitor
expenditure, any potential variation in expenditure or visitor numbers, and
consequent effects on turnover or employment are of key importance.
14.4.10 A business survey was carried out to gain a more detailed understanding of the
local tourism economy and its current performance.
The business survey findings
are summarised in Section 14.5 (c).
Businesses contacted include key visitor
accommodation providers, leisure activity providers, and other relevant tourism
businesses.
14.4.11 The survey sought respondents’ perceptions of the potential impacts of the Project
on their business performance (turnover and customer base) and on tourism in the
wider South-West Wales area. Impacts were categorised as follows:
·
Low Impact = <10 %;
·
Medium Impact = 10-15 %; and
·
High Impact =>15 %.
14.4.12 The definitions of perceived impact (both beneficial and adverse) are based on
market experience.
In tourism-related business surveys across the UK,
respondents have generally stated that reductions in turnover of in excess of 15%
are critical to business sustainability/survival, while reductions of 10%-15%
represent a moderate impact which can be recouped through marketing, cost
saving and similar market responses.  Reductions of less than 10% are seen as
being within the parameters of general changes in trading conditions.
14.4.13 Visitor facilities1 and notable points of focus2 in the study area have been identified
through carrying out web-based research3.
The assessment reports on the
likelihood of the Project influencing visitor and tourist attitudes and behaviour
towards them.
14.4.14 The significance of effects on tourism is assessed by reference to the sensitivity of
the receptor and the anticipated magnitude of impact which represents the extent of
change to that receptor.
14.4.15 In considering the level of tourism sensitivity, the standing4 of the receptor or
resource is the defining factor. This is established against:
·
Tourism business’ relative attraction to customers from outside the study area
and the Project’s potential to influence broader perceptions of the area.
Where a majority of trade is non-local this is more likely to be the case; and
·
The relative importance of tourism as a business sector. Where tourism is
more important relative to other sectors, impacts may have the potential to
generate broader impacts (as the receptor is highly sensitive). Similarly, where

nationally significant projects.

AECOM
14-10
it is of relatively low sensitivity, impacts on tourism and related sectors are
unlikely to generate a significant adverse effect across the broader economy.
f)
Community infrastructure
14.4.16 An assessment of the likely significant effects on local, regional and national
community receptors during construction, operation and decommissioning of the
Project has been carried out. This assessment also includes an audit of community
infrastructure facilities/receptors (Para. 14.5.3 and Figures 14.5-14.8) within the
local area and its associated effects (i.e. effects on local schools, local authority
services and other infrastructure).
g)
Study areas
14.4.17 The socio-economic study area is based on drive time catchment areas from the
Project.  The ‘local area’ is defined within a 30-minute drive time; ‘wider area’ within
a 45-minute drive time; and ‘wider region’ within a 60-minute drive time (Figure
14.1). The wider study area covers most of the Swansea Bay City Region
(excluding the Pembrokeshire county area). The majority of employment impacts
will occur within a 60-minute drive time area.5
Smaller geographies (30 and 45-
minute drive times) are also provided to show the effects of sourcing labour from
smaller areas.  This approach has been accepted as valid for similar DCO projects
and is considered to be a robust approach.
14.4.18 The tourism/business survey study area is limited to a 10 km radius of the Project
as this is where the majority of impacts are anticipated. This is based on
professional judgement. However, some tourism receptors within this radius have
been excluded as they are either screened by roads and/or situated in an urban
area where visual impacts are unlikely to be experienced, such as:
·
Businesses/receptors to the south of the M4 have been excluded as they will
be physically separated from the Project Site by the M4.  This separation will
significantly diminish any potential visual, noise, traffic/accessibility or air
quality effects on businesses which may cause tourism impacts
14.4.19 Businesses/receptors in the settlements north of the M4, such as Pontarddulais,
Clydach, and Pontardawe, have been included due to their relative proximity to the
Project. Businesses/receptors have also been included in settlements such as
Pantyffynnon and Tycroes because of the relative flat environment to the north of
the Project (Figure 14.2). This approach has been accepted as valid for similar
DCO projects and is considered to be a robust approach.
14.4.20 The community infrastructure assessment is focussed on the area defined within an
approximate 5 km radius from the Project (Figure 14.3). This is based on
professional judgement and has been accepted for similar DCO projects and is
considered to be a robust approach. As proximity is likely to be the main
determinant of impacts and their magnitude, the status (or catchment) of
community facility receptors in an area determines the scale and significance of
any effects. Sensitivity
5 60 minutes is considered the upper threshold at which workers will commute on a regular basis

14.4.21 In addition to quantitative and qualitative assessment, significance of effects is
defined by the combination of the sensitivity of receptors and the magnitude of
impacts upon them. The criteria set out below are specific to socio-economic,
tourism and community infrastructure factors and have been adopted to assess
receptor sensitivity and impact magnitude. They therefore differ slightly from those
in Chapter 4: Approach to Environmental Impact Assessment of this ES6.
14.4.22 Socio-economic sensitivity is outlined in Table 14-3.

14.4.29 In line with standard EIA practice, the sensitivity of receptors, as defined in the
tables above (Table 14-3, Table 14-4, and Table 14-5), are considered against the
Magnitude of impact (Table 14-6, Table 14-7, and Table 14-8) to determine the
significance of effect (Table 14-9).

Baseline Environment
14.5.1 This section describes the baseline environmental characteristics for the Project
and surrounding areas with specific reference to socio-economics, tourism, and
community infrastructure.
a)
Socio-economic
14.5.2 The socio-economic profile sets a context for the assessment and highlights key
socio-economic issues. The socio-economic indicators are also used to determine
the overall sensitivity of the labour market (socio-economic receptor). The socio-
economic profile is summarised below. Supporting tables and text can be found in
Appendix 14.1.
14.5.3 The socio-economic study area7 surrounding the Project is characterised by:
·
An increasing population (2001-2017);
·
Projected population increase of c.7% between 2017 and 2035;
·
Slightly lower levels of unemployment comparable to the UK average;
·
A higher proportion of people working in construction and manufacturing jobs;
·
Above average levels of employment in electricity and gas related
occupations;
·
A lower proportion of people working in high value professional, scientific and
technical activities, and finance & insurance occupations;
·
A higher proportion of people employed in semi-skilled/unskilled jobs and
lower proportion of people in highly skilled jobs; and
·
A higher proportion of people achieving no qualifications and low level
qualifications compared to the UK average.
Description of socio-economic Sensitivity

14.5.4 The study area for the labour market is assessed to be of low sensitivity in
accordance with the criteria provided in Table 14-3, as the area has a readily
available labour force.

Tourism Volume and Value
14.5.5 The tourism economy is assessed using visitor statistics for the Swansea local
authority area and the South West Wales area.
14.5.6 Swansea had on average 7.35 million Great Britain (GB) day visits each year
between 2013 and 2015 (Table 14-10; Ref. 14.10).

biggest indoor water park, and the National Waterfront Museum are situated c.8 km
from the Project in Swansea. However, these projects are outside the defined
tourism study area which excludes tourism receptors to the south of the M4 due to
the physical separation that the motorway creates. The tourism study area is
defined in Section 14.4.8.

14.5.9 There are a limited number of tourist attractions within the tourism study area, as
shown on Figure 14.4, with most of the tourist attractions being located in the city of
Swansea, outside the study area:
·
Cwm Clydach Nature Reserve: Woodland with nature trails;

Trail, which connects Swansea with Builth Wells, north of Brecon Beacons
National Park; and
·
Teamforce Paintball and Laser Tag Activity Centre: Outdoor activity centre in
Llangyfelach.
14.5.10 Cwm Clydach Nature Reserve is classed as having medium sensitivity due to its
regional appeal. National Cycle Route 43 is classed as having a high sensitivity due
to its national status as a long-distance cycle route. The activity centre is classed
as being low sensitivity due to its local appeal.
c)
Findings of the Business Survey
14.5.11 A tourism business survey was carried out during November and December 2014.
This has not been repeated for this assessment as baseline assessment shows the
visitor economy has not materially changed since 2014. The 2014 business survey
findings are therefore considered to remain valid for this assessment.
14.5.12 The survey population included all businesses which could be considered to derive
part of, or all of, their trade from tourism within the defined study area.  The study
area was selected as it was considered unlikely that tourism businesses located
outside this would experience either beneficial or adverse impacts (tourism study
area described at Section 14.4.19). A full write-up of the business survey results
can be found in Appendix 14.2 The baseline conclusions from the business survey
are summarised below:
·
Of the 58 businesses surveyed, 17 responded to the tourism business survey
questionnaire, giving a 29% response rate;
·
A high proportion of responses were from businesses located in Pontardawe
and Bryncoch.   A number of the businesses were small in size;
·
The highest proportion of responses was from bars and pubs. The survey
identified that a high proportion of trade was from local customers. The origins
of tourist/visitor customers were mainly from the UK;
·
The main activities customers participated in when visiting the area were going
on long and short walks, as well as sightseeing;
·
The majority of businesses considered that their business performance had
been increasing over the last three years. Current levels of satisfaction were
high, with all respondents reporting trade as being fair or good. Respondents
were also optimistic that their future business performance will improve and
level of business increase; and
·
Weather, reputation, product, price and value for money were deemed to be
the most influential factors impacting upon business trends.
d)
Community Infrastructure
14.5.13 Demand for community infrastructure facilities could arise from the in-migration of
construction workers during the temporary construction phase. However, based on
the number of construction workers required for this Project, professional
judgement and experience of other projects, this requirement is likely to be minimal.
An audit of community facilities within approximately 5 km of the Project Site
indicates the provision of the following community infrastructure facilities in the area
(Figures 14.5 – 14.8).

14.5.14 A full list of these community infrastructure receptors which corresponds with
Figures 14.5 – 14.8 can be found in Appendix 14.3.
14.5.15 The schools, GP surgeries, dentists, pharmacies, park and libraries are classed as
low sensitivity as they are of local significance and serve a local catchment.
Morriston Hospital is classed as medium sensitivity because it is of regional
significance8.
14.6
Embedded Mitigation
14.6.1 As detailed in Chapter 3: Project and Site Description, a number of embedded
mitigation measures have been identified through the iterative EIA process and
have been incorporated into the design and construction planning of the Project.
14.6.2 As these mitigation measures have been embedded into the design, are legal
requirements or are standard practices that will be implemented, the assessment of
likely significant effects assumes that they are in place.
14.7
Assessment of Effects – Socio-economics
14.7.1 This section assesses the nature and magnitude of construction and operational &
maintenance effects. The socio-economic assessment of effects is carried out on
the basis of the Project as a whole as impacts cannot be disaggregated into
elements, i.e. Power Generation Plant, Gas Connection, and Electrical Connection.
As a worst case scenario decommissioning effects are considered to be similar to
construction effects9.

Employment and GVA
i.
14.7.2 A detailed schedule of the level of employment and skills required to build the
Project was provided based on relevant project experience10.
14.7.3 The construction period is estimated to last 22 months from 2020-2022. The
number of construction workers on site per month ranges from 25 to 122 during the
peak construction period11.
14.7.4 Table 14-13 and Table 14-14 show the average number of construction workers
and full time equivalent permanent construction jobs on site for Years 1 to 2.
8 It is recognised as the major trauma centre for South West Wales.
9 A decommissioning programme would be required to accurately assess decommissioning effects.  Impacts are therefore considered to
be consistent with the level experienced during the construction phase.

14.7.5 Gross value added (GVA) is a measure of the value of goods and services
produced in an area, industry or sector of an economy.  Annual construction GVA
per head in Wales is £76,725.  The construction phase could therefore deliver up to
£7.1 million GVA13 to the wider economy.
Magnitude of Construction Effect
ii.
14.7.6 The study area for the labour market is assessed to be of low sensitivity in
accordance with the criteria provided in Table 14-3, as the area has a readily
available labour force. The Project as a whole would provide a low beneficial
construction employment magnitude of impact in accordance with the criteria
provided in Table 14-6 and professional judgement.
Skills Requirement
iii.
14.7.7 The Project’s construction schedule shows approximately 40% of the construction
workforce will be highly skilled14, 45% moderately skilled15, and 15% low skilled16.
The majority of construction related employment will be in relatively high value and
high paid positions that required a high degree of training and qualifications.
14.7.8 The baseline assessment shows construction and manufacturing employment
accounts for almost a fifth of all jobs in the study area. The study area’s
concentration of skilled manual workers is also higher than the national average17.
The Project will therefore present an opportunity to develop the skills of the local
workforce and increase the value of the construction industry.
12 It is generally accepted in economic appraisals that 10 years of continuous employment is equivalent to 1 Full-time equivalent (FTE).
13 £76,725 x 92 person years= £7,058,745 (note this is the same as 9.2 FTEs x 10 years continuous employment x £76,725 = £7.1m)
14 Highly skilled jobs include: Purchaser/ Engineer; Operator; Contractor Management; Contractor Supervisor; Electrical Installation;
Cabling; Exhaust Duct; Hoists; Lagging; Trace Heating; Air Cooled Condenser
15 Moderately skilled jobs include: Earth Moving; Civil; Fire System; Tanks and Piping
16 Low skilled jobs include: Fencing; Painting; Scaffolding; Security; Canteen and Others

Accommodation Capacity
iv.
14.7.9 The study area accommodation capacity assessment is based on hotel and bed &
breakfast accommodation, i.e. it assumes that construction based demand will be
directed towards these sectors rather than other types of accommodation18.
14.7.10 Average hotel19 occupancy rates (Ref. 14.13) for Wales have been used to estimate
the number of available bedrooms at hotels and bed & breakfast accommodation
within a 10 km radius of the Project Site. The Project Site is located c.8 km from
Swansea where there is a range of accommodation, retail, leisure, and other
services. Construction related accommodation requirements are therefore likely to
be met by accommodation providers within 10 km of the Project.
14.7.11 The Project programme indicates the estimated number of construction staff on site
on a monthly basis during the construction programme. The construction
programme indicates that 122 workers would be on site at the peak of the
construction period.
14.7.12 The extent to which construction workers use accommodation in the study area20 is
influenced by: site proximity or ease of access to it; availability, quality and price of
accommodation; the range of leisure and other services in the immediate area; and
other factors.
14.7.13 Table
14-15
demonstrates
that
100% of construction workers could be
accommodated each month within a 10 km radius of the Project.   The values in
Table 14-15 assume that existing sources of trade are maintained at their current
levels (as reflected in occupancy rates).  Critically, it then shows the effect of
construction-related accommodation demand on the residual capacity.
14.7.14 In reality, a large proportion of unspecialised jobs will be provided locally and will
not require accommodation. However, Table 14-15 demonstrates that a worst-case
scenario involving 100% of workers requiring accommodation could be easily
accommodated without causing any shortages or pressures21.
18 It is more likely that construction workers would choose to stay in centrally located serviced B&B and hotel accommodation as opposed
to non-serviced caravan parks or self-catering accommodation which tends to be in more remote locations.
19 Hotel occupancy rates exceed B&B occupancy rates.  Hotel occupancy rates used to investigate the impact of a worst case scenario.
68% for peak, 54% for off peak
20 A security cabin will provide accommodation for security personnel on site 24/7 during construction phase. Construction workers will
however be  accommodated in Swansea.
21 It is noted that construction workers will also provide a positive contribution through increased business.  However, the assessment
seeks to prove the ‘worst case’ i.e. all construction workers can be accommodated without creating adverse pressures on the
accommodation sector by crowding out existing tourism and business visitors or by leading to price rises.

region’ within a 60-minute drive time.
14.7.17 Table 14-16 shows that the required construction labour force would also account
for 0.7% of the employed construction workforce or 0.6% of manufacturing workers
within a 30-minute drive time.
14.7.18 If the demand for construction labour were fully sourced from the ‘potentially
available labour pool’ (i.e. unemployed) it would account for 0.8% of unemployed
workers within a 30-minute drive time.
14.7.19 The demand for construction labour arising from the Project’s development would
not therefore result in any pressure on labour market capacity (i.e. requiring more
than 15%23 of existing capacity).

Employment and GVA
i.
14.7.20 Best practice principles outlined in HM Treasury Green Book Appraisal Guidance
(Ref. 14.7) have been applied to assess the effect of permanent operational
employment.
14.7.21 An Economic Impact Model was developed to measure net additional employment
and GVA.  The Guidance has been used along with professional judgment to
estimate values for:
·
Deadweight – what would happen in the absence of the Project;
·
Leakage – the proportion of employment opportunities accessed by people
living outside the study area;
·
Displacement – the proportion of Project benefit accounted for by a reduction
in benefit elsewhere;
·
Substitution – when a firm substitutes one activity for another to take
advantage of public sector assistances; and
·
Multipliers – to estimate further economic activity associated with additional
income and supplier purchases.
14.7.22 Table 14-17 shows the values used in the model.  Explanatory comments are given
for each value.

(HCA) has provided a methodology for
calculating additionality through a ‘net additionality framework’.  This is represented
in Figure 14-9 below and can be described as: ‘Impact of intervention option’ less
‘impact of reference case’ (deadweight) equals ‘net additional impact.’

Note: Figures 14.1-14.8 are included as separate Figures
14.7.24 The operational phase of the Project would provide an estimated 10 FTE direct
jobs.
The net effect, taking account of the leakage, displacement, and multiplier
effects shown above, would be 6.0 additional regional FTE jobs and 5.5 national
FTE jobs24.
Average GVA per utility employee in Wales is £91,05325.
Assuming
Project related employment generated average levels of GVA, the Project’s
operation would provide approximately £0.55m GVA26 and £0.50m GVA27 per
annum to the regional and national UK economy respectively.
Skills Requirement
ii.
14.7.25 Each of the Project’s gross 10 FTE jobs will be highly skilled positions that offer
permanent employment opportunities for 25 years.  Each position will be relatively
high paid and requires a high level of training and qualifications.
Significance of Operational Effect
iii.
14.7.26 The study area for the labour market is assessed to be of low sensitivity in
accordance with the criteria provided in Table 14-3.   The Project as a whole would
provide a minor beneficial operation employment magnitude of impact in
accordance with the criteria provided in Table 14-6.
The low sensitivity and low

beneficial impact results in a likely negligible beneficial effect on employment, in
accordance with the criteria provided in Table 14-9.
Absorption Capacity
iv.
14.7.27 The labour market data from the baseline is used to show the extent to which the
study area can supply relevant skills and labour for the construction and operation
of the Project.
14.7.28 Labour market data is expressed at drive time level, i.e. a catchment reflecting
travel to work patterns.
14.7.29 Operational impacts have been assessed against the current labour market (Table
14-16).
The operational workforce requirement accounts for less than 2% of the
electricity and gas workers and less than 1% of the working age, economically
active and highly skilled, skilled and unskilled labour force.
14.7.30 Demand for operational employment would not therefore result in any noticeable
labour market pressure on the 30-, 45-, or 60-minute drive time areas and would
not exert negative pressure through labour shortages and wage increases.
14.7.31
The labour requirement during the operational phase would provide a benefit
and in reality would be sourced from a number of economically active categories
including workers in directly relevant industries, workers with transferable skills and
unemployed workers.
14.8
Assessment of Effects – Tourism and Recreation
a)
Tourism Business Survey (Impact Analysis)
14.8.1 This section summarises the tourism business survey responses in terms of
perceived impact on business performance of the wider South-West Wales tourism
product. A full report can be found in Appendix 14.2.
14.8.2 In terms of impact, the vast majority of respondents felt that the Project would have
no impact on business performance. Some businesses felt that they would benefit
at the construction phase through related demand for accommodation, food and
drink, and other services.
14.8.3 Only one respondent predicted an adverse impact on business performance based
mainly on perceived adverse visual impact.
14.8.4 The majority of respondents felt that the Project would have either no or low
adverse impact on tourism in South West Wales.  Less than a fifth expected the
impact to be either medium or high adverse, with visual impact and potential traffic
congestion (during construction) cited as the main factors.
14.8.5 Overall, the business survey analysis has shown that a number of accommodation
providers, food and drink, and other similar businesses in the study area are not
reliant on tourism trade and are reporting high/increasing business confidence. The
vast majority of respondents do not predict any significantly adverse impact on
either their own business performance or the wider South-West Wales tourism
offer.

Tourism and Recreation Receptors (Impact Analysis)
14.8.6 Tourism and recreation receptors within the study area may experience the
following impacts:
·
Visual;
·
Noise;
·
Traffic/accessibility; and
·
Air quality.
14.8.7 The tourism and recreation assessment assesses the potential impacts on three
distinct components during two distinct phases.
14.8.8 The three distinct components include the:
·
Power Generation Plant only;
·
Gas Connection; and
·
Electrical Connection.
14.8.9 The two district phases of the Project include the:
·
Construction/decommissioning phase; and
·
Operational phase.
14.8.10 The structure of this section ensures potential visual, noise, traffic, and air quality
impacts on each component during each phase are individually assessed against
tourism and recreation receptors in the area.
Power Generation Plant
i.
Construction/Decommissioning – Visual
14.8.11 The Paintball Activity Centre may experience visual impacts during construction.
For further detailed assessment of visual impact, please refer to section 11.2,
Chapter 11: Landscape and Visual Effects.
14.8.12 The Zone of Theoretical Visibility (ZTV) shows that the other tourism and
recreational receptors including one cycle route (National Route 43) and a nature
reserve (Cwm Clydach Nature Reserve) are unlikely to experience visual impacts
during construction of the Power Generation Plant.
Construction/Decommissioning – Noise
14.8.13 As stated in
Chapter 3: Project and Site Description,
a
Construction
Environmental Management Plan (CEMP) (Outline CEMP: Appendix 3.1) will be
implemented during the construction period to mitigate any effects.
Chapter 7:
Noise and Vibration confirms that there will be no significant noise effects.
14.8.14 Moreover, as stated in Chapter 3: Project Site and Description, all construction
activities would be carried out in accordance with the recommendations of BS5228
(the industry approved code of practice which is used in assessing noise from
construction sites). This will ensure that no tourism or recreational related
businesses or receptors are affected significantly during construction or
decommissioning.
Abergelli ES 2018 – CHAPTER 14: SOCIO-ECONOMICS
Prepared for: Abergelli Power Limited
AECOM
14-28
Construction/Decommissioning – Traffic/accessibility
14.8.15 The implementation of a Construction Traffic Management Plan (CTMP) [HOLD-1]
during the construction phase will ensure that no tourism or recreational related
businesses/receptors are affected significantly.
Construction/Decommissioning – Air quality
14.8.16 As stated in Chapters 3 and 6, a CEMP (Outline CEMP: Appendix 3.1) will prevent
construction activities generating levels of atmospheric dust which would constitute
a health hazard or nuisance to local people. This will ensure that no tourism or
recreational related businesses or receptors are affected significantly during
construction/decommissioning.
Summary: Power Generation Plant Construction/Decommissioning
14.8.17 A summary of assessed magnitude of impact of the Power Generation Plant on
tourism and recreation receptors is provided below in Table 14.19. Taking into
consideration the magnitude of impact identified below, together with the sensitivity
of receptor (as defined in Section 14.5.9) the significance of effect on the receptors
would be no greater than minor adverse.

Operation - Visual
14.8.18 The ZTV shows that the stack is likely to be visible over a proportion of the study
area. The ZTV analysis used to determine visual impact is based on the
topography of the land and does not take into account physical or natural aspects,
such as buildings and trees. Visual impact is likely to be reduced due to the
screening effect of buildings and woodland. Section 11.4.12,
Chapter 11:
Landscape and Visual Effects makes reference to the fact that significant
adverse effects on visual amenity are likely to be limited to within 5 km of the
Project Site. The Paintball and Laser Tag Centre is located in a heavily wooded
area and, as such, visual impact is likely to be reduced.
Operation – Noise
14.8.19 Any noise impacts of the Project will be localised and will not affect tourism
receptors within the study area, as confirmed in Chapter 7: Noise and Vibration
which states that there would be no significant noise impacts during operation.
Operation – Traffic/accessibility
14.8.20 Chapter 12: Traffic and Transport confirms traffic to the Project Site will be
infrequent during the operational phase. Traffic to the Power Generation Plant
Abergelli ES 2018 – CHAPTER 14: SOCIO-ECONOMICS
Prepared for: Abergelli Power Limited
AECOM
14-29
would be limited to occasional maintenance vehicles, deliveries, and visitor access
and will therefore not have a significant impact on tourism and recreational
receptors.
Operation – Air Quality
14.8.21 Chapter 6: Air Quality confirms that the Power Generation Plant is unlikely to
have any significant impacts on air quality during operation and therefore will not
have a significant impact on tourism and recreation receptors.
Summary: Power Generation Plant Operation
14.8.22 A summary of assessed magnitude of impact of the Power Generation Plant on
tourism and
recreation receptors is provided in
Table
14.20.
Taking into
consideration the magnitude of impact identified below, together with the sensitivity
of receptor (as defined in Section 14.5.9) the significance of effect on the receptors
would be no greater than minor adverse.

Construction/Decommissioning – Visual
14.8.23 Any visual impacts would be predominately restricted to the construction phase of
the Gas Connection. As noted in section 11.7.45, Chapter 11: Landscape and
Visual Effects, the gas connection would not result in any significant visual effects
from the viewpoints assessed. Any impacts would be temporary and there should
be no significant adverse visual effects on tourism and recreation receptors within
the study area.
Construction/Decommissioning – Noise
14.8.24 As noise impacts assessed in section 7.8.2, Chapter 7: Noise and Vibration will
be primarily limited to the construction phase, they would be temporary. The
mitigation measures noted in Chapter 3: Project and Site Description should
ensure that no tourism or recreational related businesses or receptors are affected
significantly during construction/decommissioning.
Construction/Decommissioning – Traffic/accessibility
14.8.25 Table 12-35, 12: Traffic, Transport and Access confirms that construction vehicle
movements will lead to no significant effects, with the exception of the footpath
closure, which is very localised. Therefore, no tourism or recreational related
businesses/receptors will be affected significantly.

Construction/Decommissioning – Air quality
14.8.26 As stated in Chapters 3: Project and Site Description (section 3.11.14) and
Chapter 6: Air Quality (section 6.6.1), an outline CEMP (Appendix 3.1) will prevent
construction work generating levels of atmospheric dust which would constitute a
health hazard or nuisance to local people. This will ensure that no tourism or
recreational related businesses or receptors are affected significantly during
construction/decommissioning.
Summary: Gas Connection Construction/Decommissioning
14.8.27 A summary of the assessed magnitude of impact of the Gas Connection during
construction on tourism and recreation receptors is provided in Table 14.21. Taking
into consideration the magnitude of impact identified below, together with the
sensitivity of receptor (as defined in Section 14.5.9) the significance of effect on the
receptors would be no greater than minor adverse.

that they will generate any noise or vibration during operation.
Operation – Traffic/Accessibility
14.8.30 Traffic movements to the Gas Connection during the operational phase are likely to
be minimal and there are therefore not anticipated to be any effects on tourism and
recreation receptors.
Operation – Air Quality
14.8.31 No impacts on local air quality are anticipated from the operation of the Gas
Connection and therefore this has not been assessed.
Summary: Gas Connection Operation
14.8.32 A summary of the assessed magnitude of impact of the Gas Connection during
operation on tourism and recreation receptors is provided in Table 14.22. Taking
into consideration the magnitude of impact identified below, together with the

11: Landscape and Visual Effects, the electrical connection would not result in
any significant visual effects from the viewpoints assessed.
Construction/Decommissioning – Noise
14.8.34 As noise impacts assessed in section 7.7.14, Chapter 7: Noise and Vibration will
be primarily limited to the construction phase, they would be temporary. The
mitigation measures noted in section 3.11.21, Chapter 3: Project and Site
Description should ensure that no tourism or recreational related businesses or
receptors are affected significantly during construction or decommissioning.
Construction/Decommissioning – Traffic/Accessibility
14.8.35 Users of the road network may be affected by additional construction workers
travelling to the area. However, the construction/decommissioning phase of the
Electrical Connection is not anticipated to generate an amount of traffic movements
which would have a likely significant detrimental effect on tourism or recreation
receptor as noted in Table 12.35, Chapter 13: Traffic and Transport and Access.
Construction/Decommissioning – Air quality
14.8.36 Any air quality impacts are expected to be restricted to the immediate local area
around the Project Site as noted in section 6.8.2, Chapter 6: Air Quality. The
adoption of the embedded mitigation measures mentioned in section 3.11.14,
Chapter 3: Project and Site Description should ensure that no tourism or
recreation receptors are affected significantly during construction/decommissioning.
Summary: Electrical Connection Construction/Decommissioning
14.8.37 A summary of the assessed magnitude of impact of the Electrical Connection
during construction/decommissioning on tourism and recreation receptors is
provided in Table 14.22. Taking into consideration the magnitude of impact
identified below, together with the sensitivity of receptor (as defined in Section

Operation – Noise
14.8.39 The Electrical Connection will be buried underground and therefore it is not
anticipated that they will generate any noise or vibration during operation.
Operation – Traffic/Accessibility
14.8.40 Traffic movements to the Electrical Connection during the operational phase are
likely to be minimal as noted in section 12.7.50, Chapter 13 Traffic Transport and
Access and there are therefore not anticipated to be any effects on tourism and
recreation receptors.
Operation – Air Quality
14.8.41 No impacts on local air quality are anticipated from the operation of the Electrical
Connection and therefore this has not been assessed as noted in section 6.4.3,
Chapter 6: Air Quality.

Assessment of Effects: Community Infrastructure
14.9.1 There are no community infrastructure facilities situated in the immediate area
surrounding the Project. Therefore there will be no significant effects (visual, noise,
Abergelli ES 2018 – CHAPTER 14: SOCIO-ECONOMICS
Prepared for: Abergelli Power Limited
AECOM
14-33
traffic, or air quality) on these facilities during construction/decommissioning or
operation as a result of the Project as they are sufficiently far away (see Figures
14.5 – 14.8).
14.9.2 The construction period for the Project is estimated to last 22 months from 2020-
2022. The number of construction workers onsite per month ranges from 25 to 122
during the peak construction period. In terms of community infrastructure capacity,
the construction jobs for the Project will be temporary and therefore it is reasonable
to assume that the majority of workers will not move their families for this relatively
short period of time.
14.9.3 No capacity information is available at individual school level for schools in Wales
but it is not envisaged that there would be any pressure on schools capacity in the
area as a result of the construction of this Project for the reasons noted in Section
14.9.2. In terms of GP Surgeries, four in the study area are accepting new patients
and several accept patients who are temporary residents in the area, such as
construction workers. Morriston Hospital, which has A&E facilities, is situated in the
study area.
14.9.4 The level of existing community infrastructure in the area is considered to be
sufficient to accommodate any additional demand.
The magnitude of impact is
considered to be low.
14.9.5 Taking into consideration the magnitude of impact identified above, together with
the low/medium sensitivity of the receptors (as defined in Section 14.5.15) the
significance of effect on the receptors would be no greater than minor adverse.
14.10 Mitigation and Monitoring
14.10.1 Effects on tourism and socio-economic were not found to be significant, therefore
no additional mitigation will be required.
14.10.2 The community infrastructure assessment shows that there are a limited number of
community facilities in close proximity to the Project and are therefore unlikely to be
any significant impacts in terms of visual, noise, traffic, and air quality. The level of
existing community infrastructure in the wider area is considered to be sufficient to
accommodate any additional demand and mitigation will not be required.
14.11 Significance of effects
a)
Socio-economics
14.11.1 The low labour market sensitivity and minor beneficial construction and operational
impact results in a likely Negligible beneficial effect on employment, in accordance
with the criteria provided in Table 14.9.
Construction and operational effects on
employment and GVA are considered to be Negligible and therefore not
significant.
b)
Tourism
14.11.2 Of the three tourism and recreation receptors identified, the Paintball and Activity
Centre is the only one in close proximity to the Project. The low sensitivity and low
magnitude of impact results in a Negligible effect which is not significant. Effects
Abergelli ES 2018 – CHAPTER 14: SOCIO-ECONOMICS
Prepared for: Abergelli Power Limited
AECOM
14-34
on Cwm Clydach Nature Reserve will be Negligible and therefore not significant.
Effects on the National Cycle Route 43 will be Minor Adverse and also not
significant.
c) Community Infrastructure
14.11.3 There are no community facilities situated in the immediate area surrounding the
Project. The level of community infrastructure provision in the wider area is
considered sufficient to serve any additional requirements as a result of the Project.
The magnitude of impact is low. Taking into account the low/medium sensitivity, the
likely effect would be at its greatest Minor Adverse and therefore not significant.
14.12 Residual Effects

Project Effects
Socio-economics
i.
14.12.2 The Project in the context of employment and labour market pressure is considered
in Section 14.728.Project impacts cannot be disaggregated into elements, i.e.
Power Generation Plant, Gas Connection, and Electrical Connection, because
these three elements are so intrinsically linked.
Tourism
ii.
14.12.3 The Project will not cause any significant effects on tourism and recreation
receptors in the study area.
14.12.1 The majority of tourism related businesses stated that the Project would have ‘no
impact’ on their trading performance, while a proportion of survey respondents
stated it would have a beneficial effect through increased trade from construction
workers.
14.13 Cumulative Effects
a)
Assessment of Potential Cumulative Effects – Construction
Description of Impact
i.
14.13.1 Cumulative impacts on the labour market have been identified as potentially arising
as a result of construction of the Project in combination with other schemes set out
in Chapter 4: Approach to Environmental Impact Assessment.
Assessment of cumulative effect
ii.
14.13.2 Table 14-31 shows the construction job requirement for each project included in the
cumulative assessment. Estimates have been based on estimated construction
costs using Building Cost Information Service (BCIS) data (2017)29 (Ref. 14.14).
Projects that are currently under construction are assumed to be completed by the
anticipated construction start date for the Project in 2020.

14.13.3 A total of 3,858 temporary construction jobs would be required to build nearby
projects, or 3,950 when including the Project.
14.13.4 The Absorption Capacity Table (Table 14-32) demonstrates sufficient labour in the
study area to build all of the cumulative projects (i.e. the total requirement does not
exceed 15% at the 60-minute drive time33).
14.13.5 The cumulative projects could therefore be built using labour from the Project’s
labour market area without creating any minor labour market distortions. In reality,
the labour market for the cumulative projects will be much wider than the Project
labour market area providing access to a wider labour market pool34.
33 The wider region (60-minute drive time) has been considered for construction employment impacts as construction labour is more likely
to come from these areas than from the 30 and 45 minute areas. Smaller geographies are included to show worst case effects
34 The Construction Industry Training Board research document (2015) suggests that about 42% of construction

14.13.6 The Absorption Capacity analysis assumes a worst case scenario. All projects are
assumed to be constructed during the same year. A one-year build programme is
assumed for projects where construction programmes are unknown.  This
increases the annual labour requirement35.  In practice, the ‘worst case scenario’ is
unlikely to occur for a number of reasons:
·
Some of the projects may not be consented or developed;
·
The construction of the noted schemes is unlikely to take place concurrently;
·
Some involve construction over a more extended period than the Project
(further diluting absorption effects);
·
The labour market catchments for a number of the noted projects will differ
from that of the Project;
·
A number of the projects are likely to require more specialist construction
skills. It is unlikely that the construction needs for all of the projects noted can
be met from within localised catchments;
·
Construction labour is highly mobile and flexible. Should capacity bottlenecks
emerge, labour can generally be brought in from further afield; and
·
A proportion of specialist labour would be sourced from across the UK.
14.13.7 It is therefore considered based on this assessment that there will be no cumulative
impact on the wider labour market area, as the total projects are anticipated to
workers in Wales regularly travel more than 50 miles to their place of work
35 Most projects have available build programmes and these have been applied to the annual requirements.

constitute below 15% of total construction labour in the wider area. Combined, the
cumulative projects will provide a positive stimulus to the study area economy
through the provision of construction related training and employment opportunities,
supply chain linkages and demand for accommodation, food and drink services.

Other Effects Considered 
15.1 
Introduction 
 This chapter addresses topics that are not specifically addressed in the context of 
15.1.1
the main topic chapters elsewhere in this ES, or effects which are not considered to 
merit a chapter in their own right, but have been considered in line with requests 
from consultees, including through the Scoping Opinion.  
 This chapter therefore addresses the following topics: 
15.1.2
 
How waste generated by the Project will be dealt with; 
 
Public health; 
 
Aviation; and 
 
Health and safety. 
 Although not specifically requested within the Scoping Opinion or consultation, APL 
15.1.3
has also provided an assessment of Major Accidents or Disasters and Climate 
Change for completeness.   
15.2 
Waste 
a) Construction  
 The amount of excavated material associated with the new section of Access Road 
15.2.1
is approximately 19,000m3 and will be confirmed when further detailed cut and fill 
calculations are undertaken. It is expected, however, that the excavated material 
will be stored within the Laydown Area prior to use elsewhere on site or disposal in 
accordance with the Outline Site Waste Management Plan (SWMP). Management 
of waste will be controlled and managed via the SWMP which is presented in the 
Outline CEMP, Appendix 3.1.  
 For the purposes of the traffic assessment in Chapter 12: Traffic, Transport and 
15.2.2
Access it has been assumed that none of the excavated material will be used, as 
this is the worst case scenario. However, the suitability of the excavated material 
can only be determined during construction following a detailed geotechnical site 
investigation by the contractor. 
 The laying of the Electrical and Gas Connections will involve the excavation of a 
15.2.3
trench or drilling, temporary placement of the excavated soil and then backfilling 
with soil. The Gas Connection will require the construction of the AGI. No surplus 
waste materials are expected to arise from this activity if excavated material is 
reused onsite, which is normal practice.  In the event that material is not suitable for 
re-use on-site it will be managed in accordance with the Outline SWMP. 
 The Project will operate in full accordance with the Waste Framework Directive 
15.2.4
(Ref. 15.1), together with the Environmental Permitting (England and Wales) 
Regulations 2016 (Ref. 15.2) and the Waste (England and Wales) Regulations 
2011 (Ref. 15.3) (where relevant).  
Abergelli ES 2018 – CHAPTER 15: OTHER EFFECTS CONSIDERED

AECOM 
15-3 
 
 Section 5.14 of the Overarching National Policy Statement for Energy (NPS EN-1) 
15.2.5
(Ref. 15.4) requires that waste is managed through the ‘waste hierarchy’. It 
explains the relationship with the environmental permitting regime and sets 
assessment principles to be used by the Secretary of State (SoS) in determining an 
application for development consent. The waste hierarchy consists, in order of 
preference, of: 
 
Prevention; 
 
Re-use; 
 
Recycling; 
 
Other recovery (e.g. energy recovery); and 
 
Disposal. 
 In accordance with this ‘waste hierarchy’, Section 4.3 of the South West Wales 
15.2.6
Regional Waste Plan (Ref. 15.5) suggests that the most effective environmental 
solution is to minimise the generation of waste. Where this is not practical, products 
should be reused. Failing that, products should be recycled and only if no other 
option is appropriate should waste be disposed of through incineration or landfill 
(paragraph 4.3.1). Regard is also given to Technical Advice Note 21 (TAN21) (Ref 
15.6), and the National Waste Strategy (Ref 15.7). 
 The SWMP (within the CEMP, Appendix 3.1) demonstrates how waste volumes are 
15.2.7
to be minimised and managed during construction. Measures for controlling waste 
will include, amongst others, the appropriate storage of excavated spoil and testing 
for Waste Acceptance Criteria (WAC) to determine whether it can be re-used on or 
off-site. 
 The treatment of waste will follow the waste hierarchy set out in the Regional 
15.2.8
Waste Plan (Ref. 15.5), Technical Advice Note 21 (TAN21) (Ref. 15.6), and the 
National Waste Strategy (Ref. 15.7), with minimisation at source through 
construction planning and Project design, and the Engineering, Procurement, and 
Construction (EPC Contractor) will aim to reuse, or recycle waste where feasible. 
 The National Waste Strategy July 2015 Progress Report (Ref. 15.8) also confirms 
15.2.9
that there is good provision of waste management capacity in South West Wales to 
cover all types of waste arisings including industrial, construction and demolition, 
and hazardous waste. There are licensed thermal treatment, MBT (Mechanical 
Biological Treatment) and physical treatment facilities on the northern and eastern 
edges of the City of Swansea. There are also hazardous waste disposal services 
located at Swansea Enterprise Park.  
 The routes used for construction traffic entering and leaving the Project Site are 
15.2.10
described in Section 3.4 (d) of this ES. These routes will be used during 
construction for the removal of any waste materials. 
b) Operation 
 During operation of the Power Generation Plant, a small amount of waste will arise. 
15.2.11
This generated waste will include waste which is both hazardous and non-
Abergelli ES 2018 – CHAPTER 15: OTHER EFFECTS CONSIDERED 
 
Prepared for:  Abergelli Power Limited 
 
AECOM 
15-4 
 
hazardous in nature. Appropriate treatment facilities exist locally, as discussed 
above. Final types and volumes have not yet been confirmed but will be restricted 
to the following: 
 
General office wastes; 
 
Used gas turbine air intake filters. These are typically replaced annually for 
generating station operating constantly and hence will require much less 
frequent replacement for this Project. The air filters contain approximately 
eight tonnes of plastic and steel a substantial proportion of which can be 
recycled or reused; 
 
Small quantities of water from compressor blade washing (five cubic metres 
(m3) of water per month); 
 
Separated oil/sludge from any oil/water separators on site, and used oil, 
chemicals or chemical containers (approximately one tonne per year); and 
 
Other miscellaneous wastes (e.g. scrap metal, used gas bottles). 
 Only small quantities of potentially hazardous waste from the above list will be 
15.2.12
stored on the Generating Equipment Site at any time (final types and volumes have 
not yet been confirmed). Such substances will be held in secured containers under 
appropriate waste management legislation. 
 All waste management practices will be in full accordance with regulatory 
15.2.13
requirements under relevant legislation and the Waste Framework Directive (Ref. 
15.1), and with industry best practice. Waste will be treated and disposed of by 
licensed contractors. Routes for waste removal would be as per operational access 
requirements described in Section 3.4 (d). 
c) Decommissioning 
 A range of waste types are likely to arise during decommissioning and will include 
15.2.14
materials such as structural steel, metal cladding, and block and concrete waste, all 
of which will be suitable for recovery and reuse or recycling. Redundant generating 
equipment will include the turbine, ducting and pipework, generator and associated 
machinery and controls. These will be composed primarily of recyclable metals and 
other materials suitable for specialist commercial recycling and could also involve 
re-use of equipment elsewhere. It is not predicted that significant quantities of 
residual waste requiring disposal will arise during decommissioning. 
 Based on the above, it can be concluded that that no significant effects in relation 
15.2.15
to waste are predicted to arise either during construction, operation or 
decommissioning. 
15.3 
Public Health 
 In its response to the Scoping Report (letter dated 23rd July 2014), Public Health 
15.3.1
England (PHE) identified the local population as a sensitive receptor. In their S42 
response dated 2nd January 2018, PHE noted that the PEIR was in line with current 
guidance and good practice. The effects on public health of impacts to air quality 
(Section 6.7), noise (Section 7.7), groundwater contamination (Section 9.7) and 
Abergelli ES 2018 – CHAPTER 15: OTHER EFFECTS CONSIDERED 
 
Prepared for:  Abergelli Power Limited 
 
AECOM 
15-5 
 
land contamination (Section 10.6) have been assessed and the findings included in 
the relevant topic chapters of this ES. The relevant topic chapters also describe the 
risk assessment undertaken, the proposed mitigation measures, and any residual 
effects. These assessments are summarised below, along with health risks 
associated with electromagnetic fields. 
a) Electromagnetic Fields 
 An Electromagnetic Field (EMF) is a physical phenomenon that is produced by 
15.3.2
electrically charged objects. EMFs comprise electric and magnetic fields:  
 
Electric fields: are the result of voltages applied to electrical conductors and 
equipment. Fences, shrubs and buildings easily block electric fields.  
 
Magnetic fields: are produced by the flow of electric current; however unlike 
electric fields, most materials do not readily block magnetic fields.  
 UK power developers rely on national guidelines in accordance with Government 
15.3.3
advice to ensure that new installations consider health risks based on current 
knowledge. In the absence of statutory regulations to limit the public exposure to 
power-frequency electric or magnetic fields, guidelines published in 1998 by the 
International Commission on Non-Ionizing Radiation Protection (ICNIRP) (Ref. 
15.9) are adopted in the UK as set out in National Policy Statement for Electricity 
Networks Infrastructure (EN-5) (Ref. 15.10).  
 A detailed EMF assessment has been undertaken and provided in Appendix 15.1. 
15.3.4
The below provides an overview of the likely significant effects. 
 
Underground cables, as proposed, do not give rise to electric fields above 
ground due to the shielding effect of the cable sheath.  This is explained in the 
British Insulated Callender's Cables (BICC) Electric Cables Handbook (Ref. 
15.11).  
 
In 1998, the ICNIRP issued guidelines reference level of 360 μT for public 
exposure (basic restriction) to magnetic fields. The EMF assessment 
(Appendix 15.1) predicts an additional 3.1 µT (at 1 m above ground) from the 
underground cable, which is considerably lower than the ICNIRP guidelines. 
 
The intensity of both electric fields and magnetic fields also diminishes with 
increasing distance from the source. 
 
The above-ground components of the Electrical Connection will also lie within 
the Substation where there are already EMFs present that were considered 
as part of the application for the Substation; they will not make a significant 
difference to the EMFs already present. It should also be noted that the 
general public will not spend any prolonged time in close proximity to the 
Electrical Connection or to the Substation. 
 The general public will thus not be exposed to any increase in EMFs from the 
15.3.5
Electrical Connection and there will be no significant effects arising from EMFs.

b) 
Air Quality 
i. 
Construction and Decommissioning 
 The results of the air quality assessment are set out in Chapter 6: Air Quality. 
15.3.6
 The limited numbers of vehicle movements associated with the construction of the 
15.3.7
Project means that significant effects on human health from exhaust emissions are 
not anticipated. Vehicle movements during decommissioning are likely to be less 
than construction.  
 The likely significant effects on human health regarding air quality from construction 
15.3.8
and decommissioning of the Project relate to dust/particulate matter generated from 
construction activities (e.g. excavation for new foundations, Gas and Electrical 
Connections). These small particles (<10 µm) can give rise to effects on human 
health when inhaled. 
 With the implementation of dust control measures through the Outline Construction 
15.3.9
Environmental Management Plan (CEMP) (Appendix 3.1) the effects of the Project 
are predicted to be negligible in respect of human health and nuisance dust during 
construction and decommissioning. Additionally, the majority of particulates from 
construction and decommissioning activities settle within a very short distance of 
any construction site. Therefore, no significant effects are predicted in relation to 
human health. 
ii. Operation 
 The main likely significant effects on human health in relation to air quality arising 
15.3.10
from operation of the Project are associated with the stack emissions from the 
combustion of natural gas in the Generating Equipment releasing emissions of 
NOx. 
 However, modern gas-fired power plants are inherently clean and produce far fewer 
15.3.11
emissions than other fossil fuel power plants (e.g. coal) when compared on an 
energy output basis. Emissions of NOx are strictly limited under national and 
international guidelines such as the Industrial Emissions Directive (IED) (Ref. 
15.12) and the 2017 guidelines on Best Available Technologies (BAT) for large 
combustion plants (Ref. 15.13). Operation of the Generating Equipment will also be 
regulated by NRW under an Environmental Permit, which will limit emissions in line 
with national guidelines. 
 Stack height sensitivity testing was undertaken using the emissions data set out in 
15.3.12
Chapter 6: Air Quality, Table 6.7 and meteorological data from 2012-2016.  
 The appropriate stack height was determined as the point at which the change in 
15.3.13
maximum predicted annual and 99.79th percentile NO2 concentrations with each 
stack increase ceased to be significant.   
 This resulted in a conservative estimate of the minimum stack height (35 m) 
15.3.14
required for the adequate dispersion of emissions ensuring there would be no 
Abergelli ES 2018 – CHAPTER 15: OTHER EFFECTS CONSIDERED 
 
Prepared for:  Abergelli Power Limited 
 
AECOM 
15-7 
 
impact from emissions on human health during operation. This would also ensure 
legislative limits are adhered to and any impacts to other identified receptors are 
prevented. 
 During the operational phase, there may be some emissions from vehicles 
15.3.15
accessing the plant for maintenance reasons. However, these will be Negligible and 
therefore will not have a significant effect on human health. 
c) 
Noise 
i. 
Construction and Decommissioning 
 Excavation for foundations for buildings across the Project Site, delivery of plant 
15.3.16
and excavation for laying the Gas and Electrical Connection during construction 
could lead to increases in noise in the surrounding area. This will, however, be a 
temporary source of noise. The noise assessment is presented in Chapter 7: 
Noise and Vibration. 
 Construction noise mitigation measures are included in the CEMP (Appendix 3.1). 
15.3.17
In order to keep noise effects from the construction phase to a minimum, all 
construction 
activities 
would 
be 
carried 
out 
in 
accordance 
with 
the 
recommendations of BS5228. 
 It is anticipated that core working hours during construction will be limited by a 
15.3.18
Requirement in the DCO to between 08.00 and 18.00 on weekdays, and between 
08.00 and 13.00 hours on Saturdays and public holidays, unless otherwise agreed 
with CCS. Should it be necessary to work outside these core hours for certain 
activities, this would be with the prior written agreement of CCS. These limits will 
not apply during commissioning and testing of the Project. 
 With the implementation of mitigation measures to control noise from construction 
15.3.19
activities as set out above and in the Outline CEMP (Appendix 3.1), the residual 
effect at each sensitive receptor is therefore predicted to be Negligible during 
construction. 
ii. Operation 
 During operation, noise could occur from the rotating components of the 
15.3.20
Generating Equipment (e.g. the Gas Turbine Generator) and there will be small 
amounts of noise generated by the AGI as it regulates the flow of gas from the 
National Gas Transmission System to the Generating Equipment.  
 There may also be a limited amount of noise from the Access Road from the small 
15.3.21
number of vehicles accessing the Generating Equipment Site for operation and 
maintenance activities.   
 Chapter 7: Noise and Vibration assesses the effects from the Power Generation 
15.3.22
Plant during construction as Minor Adverse and is therefore Not Significant. 
Abergelli ES 2018 – CHAPTER 15: OTHER EFFECTS CONSIDERED 
 
Prepared for:  Abergelli Power Limited 
 
AECOM 
15-8 
 
 In respect of noise and vibration during operation of the Power Generation Plant, 
15.3.23
the embedded mitigation to be incorporated into the design, include: 
 The Gas Turbine Generator and major compressors are to be housed in 
acoustic enclosures. In addition, these will be housed within secondary 
acoustic enclosures specified at 75 dB(A) Sound Pressure Level at 1 m; 
 Gas turbine air inlet filter and ventilation apertures are to be fitted with 
silencers, and designed such that all sensitive noise receptors benefit from 
screening and/or directivity corrections; 
 Silencers are to be fitted in the exhaust stack. Due to the impracticality of 
screening stack noise, discharge noise will be controlled using these silencers, 
which will be tuned to attenuate low frequencies from the Gas Turbine 
Generator exhausts; 
 All plant items will be controlled to minimise noise of an impulsive or tonal 
nature; and 
 Noise breakout from the stack will be controlled using silencers.  
 A Requirement in the DCO (as set out in Document Reference 3.1) will impose 
15.3.24
maximum noise limits at Noise Sensitive Receptors which are not to be exceeded 
during operation of the Project.   
 The residual effect at each of the sensitive receptors is therefore predicted to be 
15.3.25
Negligible during operation and therefore not significant.  
d) Pollution and Contamination 
 A desk based assessment has been carried out to assess the baseline geology and 
15.3.26
ground conditions underlying the Project Site in Chapter 10: Geology, Ground 
Conditions and Hydrogeology. 
i. 
Construction and Decommissioning 
 During construction and decommissioning of the Project, the main potential impacts 
15.3.27
to human health are from; disturbance and mobilisation of potentially contaminated 
soils, groundwater, ground gas impacting on human health, and ground instability.  
 After implementation of good practice methods and mitigation measures such as 
15.3.28
working within and adhering to a detailed CEMP, an outline of which can be found 
at Appendix 3.1, the potential effects on human health are predicted to be 
Negligible, and therefore not significant.  
ii. Operation 
 During the operational phase, there is the potential for the contamination of surface 
15.3.29
water resulting from the flushing of silts and hydrocarbons from areas of 
hardstanding within the Project Site. However, such impacts would be controlled by 
the embedded mitigation measures implicit within the Project, comprising industry 
standard/good practice and measures required to ensure legislative compliance, 
contained within an operational environmental management plan secured through 
the Environmental Permit (EP). 
Abergelli ES 2018 – CHAPTER 15: OTHER EFFECTS CONSIDERED 
 
Prepared for:  Abergelli Power Limited 
 
AECOM 
15-9 
 
 The effects following the implementation of embedded mitigation are therefore 
15.3.30
predicted to be Negligible, and therefore not significant.  
 The effects to Public Health including those effects from EMF, Air Quality, Pollution 
15.3.31
and Noise are therefore all considered not significant.  
15.4 
Climate Change 
 Climate change impacts have been considered throughout each of the individual 
15.4.1
topic chapters, where relevant. Climate resilience has therefore been built into the 
Project design to reduce effects from climate change. The following outlines the 
different topics associated with climate change and reference the relevant chapters 
within this ES: 
 
Ecology: Examples of the potential ecological consequences of climate 
change include the shifting of species ranges, loss of species at the limits of 
their ranges, eventual disruption of ecological processes, and damage to the 
wider functioning of ecosystems. However, these effects can be lessened on 
species through the strengthening of ecological networks to allow species to 
migrate as the climate changes. The proposed ecological mitigation (see 
Chapter 8: Ecology) and landscaping scheme (see Chapter 11: Landscape 
and Visual Effects) for this Project seeks to strengthen connectivity in the 
wider area and would therefore contribute to the efforts to provide 
opportunities for species to migrate as the climate changes.  
 
Air Quality: The effects of the Project on climate change from emissions have 
been assessed in Chapter 6: Air Quality. The Project's carbon emissions are 
considered marginal in relation to overall UK emissions and, therefore, 
considering current policy, impacts on climate change from carbon dioxide 
emissions are not considered significant. 
 
Flood Risk: The topic of climate change has also been addressed in 
Appendix 9.1: Flood Consequences Assessment, which considers flood 
risk at the Project Site. An allowance has been made for climate change 
(predicted more frequent and/or more severe rainfall events than historically 
has been the case) in the attenuation storage calculations of 20% above the 1 
in 100 year flood event. This will mean sizing of culverts in the drainage 
design to allow for these potential more severe rainfall events. The impacts on 
climate change from flooding are therefore not considered significant. 
15.5 
Aviation 
 APL engaged with the Civil Aviation Authority (CAA), Ministry of Defence (MoD), 
15.5.1
Abertawe Bro Morgannwg University Health Board (which uses air ambulance 
services in relation to Morriston Hospital) and CCS between June and November 
2014, and again between January and March 2018, to seek their views on the 
likelihood of the Project affecting aviation assets and infrastructure. In particular, 
their views were sought on the effect of construction of a stack at the Project Site of 
up to 40 metres (m) in 2014 and up to 45 m in 2018 (the anticipated maximum 
height at the time of Phase 1 and Phase 2 consultation respectively). 
Abergelli ES 2018 – CHAPTER 15: OTHER EFFECTS CONSIDERED 
 
Prepared for:  Abergelli Power Limited 
 
AECOM 
15-10 
 
 The MoD replied on 17th September 2014 to confirm that the Project falls outside of 
15.5.2
any safeguarding areas and therefore it has no objection to the Project. For 
completeness, the MoD were once again consulted during the Phase 2 
consultation though the Project remained outside of safeguarding areas.  
 The CAA identified the potential to affect civil aviation in regard to the height of the 
15.5.3
stack with particular reference to Swansea Airport. As part of the EIA the 
safeguarding zone mapping held by CCS has been consulted and the Project falls 
outside these zones. As a result it is concluded that the Project will not affect civil 
aviation activity.    
 Abertawe Bro Morgannwg University Health Board confirmed in an email dated 23rd 
15.5.4
February 2015 that the stack will be just over 1.5 kilometres (km) away. As such 
they will not affect the (Bond Air Services) operations in and out of Swansea 
Morriston Hospital.  
 During Phase 2 consultation on 9th February 2018 the CAA responded similarly, 
15.5.5
suggesting that APL consult with Swansea Airport, local emergency services Air 
Support Units through the National Police Air Service (NPAS) organisation and the 
Wales Air Ambulance Charity. As suggested, APL then provided information to the 
NPAS organisation. In addition, CCS safeguard zone mapping was examined to 
once again confirm that the Project is located outside of the relevant safeguarding 
zone for Swansea Airport. Nevertheless, as a courtesy, details about the Project 
were shared with Swansea Airport for information purposes. 
15.6 
Health and Safety 
a) Construction and Decommissioning 
 The site manager will have the day to day responsibility for maintaining Health and 
15.6.1
Safety throughout the construction period. They will produce a risk assessment and 
method statement detailing how they will minimise the risk. An approved procedure 
which will:  
 
Identify the significant Health & Safety impacts that can be anticipated;  
 
Assess the risks from these impacts;  
 
Identify the control measures to be taken and re-calculate the risk; 
 
Report where an inappropriate level of residual risk is identified so that action 
can be taken.  
 There is a small risk of construction workers coming into contact with contaminated 
15.6.2
soils and groundwater during construction.  
 There will be no access to construction areas by the general public. The Project 
15.6.3
Site will be secured to avoid unauthorised access. 
 Traffic safety will be promoted by all project personnel to prevention and control 
15.6.4
traffic related injuries. Speed restrictions will be imposed onsite. This will also 
minimise disturbance of bare surfaces.  
Abergelli ES 2018 – CHAPTER 15: OTHER EFFECTS CONSIDERED 
 
Prepared for:  Abergelli Power Limited 
 
AECOM 
15-11 
 
 Mitigation measures as set out in the Outline CEMP, include: 
15.6.5
 
Maintaining safe working practices and the use of correct and appropriate 
Personal Protective Equipment (PPE). 
 
Site welfare facilities will be made available; 
 
A protocol in the event that unexpected contaminated land is identified during 
ground investigation or construction; and 
 
Training requirements will be provided. 
 The employer will ensure that qualified first-aid can be provided at all times. 
15.6.6
Appropriately equipped first-aid stations will be easily accessible throughout the 
place of work. 
b) 
Operation 
 Routine maintenance of the Generating Equipment would take place on average 
15.6.7
once every six months. Bi-annual inspections will also take place to assess general 
condition. Inspections to replace or refurbish combustion and turbine ‘hot parts’ 
equipment are typically carried out approximately every six years.  
 In the event of an issue with the Generating Equipment, alarms would signal any 
15.6.8
instance of abnormal operation. These alarms would not be audible externally. The 
plant would be shut down immediately in such instances and, if required, additional 
engineering staff would attend the Project Site. The Generating Equipment would 
not start up again until the issue had been resolved. Alarms would only be audible 
outside where there was an event affecting personnel safety such as a fire alarm. 
Operational maintenance is described in more detail in Section 3.4 of Chapter 3: 
Project Site and Description.  
 It is considered that effect on health and safety is Negligible, which is therefore not 
15.6.9
significant.  
15.7 
Major Accidents or Disasters  
 The Project’s vulnerability to risk of major accidents and disasters is considered in 
15.7.1
the following sections. Details on appropriate prevention measures and mitigation 
for significant effects on the environment from such events are either provided in 
the sections below or within the referenced chapters.    
a) Air Quality Events 
 In an air quality event where metrological conditions such as prevailing winds or 
15.7.2
inversion result in reduced air quality, the Project, as an emitter to air, has the 
potential to exacerbate the effect of the event. The effect of the Project on air 
quality has been considered within this ES. Details on the air quality assessment, 
prevention measures and appropriate mitigation to control the Project’s emissions 
to air can be found in Chapter 6: Air Quality. Limits are also set within the 
Environmental Permit to regulate emission levels. 
 
 
Abergelli ES 2018 – CHAPTER 15: OTHER EFFECTS CONSIDERED 
 
Prepared for:  Abergelli Power Limited 
 
AECOM 
15-12 
 
b) Engineering or Industrial Accidents 
 Due to fencing, and distance from residential areas, engineering and industrial 
15.7.3
accidents are limited to on-site workers. Existing legal protection for construction 
workers is considered to be sufficient to minimise any risk from major events to a 
reasonable level. Legislation in force to ensure the protection of workers in the 
workplace includes: 
 
Health and Safety at Work etc. Act 1974 (HSWA);  
 
The Management of Health and Safety at Work Regulations 1999;  
 
The Workplace (Health, Safety and Welfare) Regulations 1992;  
 
The Control of Substances Hazardous to Health Regulations 2002; and  
 
Construction (Design and Management) (CDM) 2015 Regulations. 
 Given the nature of natural gas there is an inherent risk of both fire and gas leak 
15.7.4
and explosion associated with the Project from its supply and use. The Project has 
been designed to comply with industry safety standards and to meet legislative 
requirements for safe operation.  
c) Proximity to Other Third Party Infrastructure  
 The Project is in close proximity to other third party infrastructure features namely 
15.7.5
the Substation, Felindre Gas Compressor Station, Water Main, overhead lines, oil 
pipeline, along with other utilities such as the National Gas Transmission System.  
 Mitigation has been embedded via the design of the Project by implementing 
15.7.6
appropriate minimum distances and having due regard to the required standoff 
distances between the Project and these infrastructure features.  
It is anticipated that potential major accidents and disasters resulting from third 
party infrastructure would be unlikely as the appropriate operational safety 
procedures relative to that installation would be implemented on a day to day basis, 
is regularly maintained and is closely monitored. In addition, the standoff distances 
from and to the Project would also take account of any effects from third party 
infrastructure on the Project. The Project is also being closed to the public and not 
in close proximity to residential areas/centres of population.

Summary of Residual Effects 
16.1 
Introduction 
16.1.1 This chapter provides a summary of the residual effects following the 
implementation of the embedded and any additional mitigation measures as 
required. Full details can be found in the respective topic chapters of this ES. 
16.2 
Summary of Mitigation Measures 
16.2.1 Schedule 4, part 7 of the EIA Regulations requires an ES to include “A description 
of the measures envisaged to prevent, reduce or where possible offset any 
significant adverse effects on the environment and” 
16.2.2 The mitigation, monitoring and enhancement measures included in this ES fall into 
one of the following categories: 
 
Embedded mitigation incorporated into the design, such as the height of the 
stack and layout of the Project; 
 
Embedded mitigation in methods of construction as included within the 
Outline CEMP (Appendix 3.1); and 
 
Additional mitigation measures identified as a result of the EIA, such as topic 
specific management plans. 
16.2.3 The Mitigation Register contained within the Outline CEMP (Appendix 3.1) lists 
each item of mitigation relied on or identified in the ES and shows how it is secured, 
either in the Draft DCO (Application Document 3.1) or through other mechanisms. 
16.3 
Residual Effects 
16.3.1 The residual effects of the Power Generation Plant, Gas Connection, Electrical 
Connection, and the Project as a whole following implementation of the mitigation 
measures have been assessed.  
16.3.2 Each technical chapter contains a detailed account of residual effects and Table 
16.1 summarises the main residual effects. The criteria for assigning the 
significance of effects are set out in section 4.6 of this ES and within relevant 
technical chapters where a different, topic-specific approach is followed. 
16.3.3 Note, as set out in Chapter 4: Approach to Environmental Impact Assessment, 
Negligible effects are not considered to be residual and have therefore not been 
included in Table 16.1 below. Minor effects are not considered significant, and 
Moderate and Major Effects are considered significant.  
16.3.4 The Project will result in the following beneficial residual effects: 
 
Socio-Economic: There will be Negligible beneficial effects on the labour 
market due to employment produced through the Project, during both 
construction, decommissioning and operation.

 
Traffic: There will be temporary Minor beneficial effects on Weekday traffic on 
the B4489 (North) and M4 East Bound and West Bound Off-slip during the 
construction phase. 
 
Ground Conditions, Geology & Hydrogeology: There will be Moderate 
beneficial effects where the previously worked land and known mine workings 
are stabilised if / where discovered and remediated if required.  
16.3.5 The ES has also identified a number of adverse effects that will mainly occur during 
construction and decommissioning as follows:

 The construction of the Project will have no more than a Minor adverse effect on Noise Sensitive 
Receptors which is therefore not significant. 
Operation of the Power Generation Plant 
 The noise from the operation of the Power Generation Plant at night will have at worst a Minor adverse

 There will be potential Minor adverse effects to Bats due to temporary removal of foraging habitat and 
disturbance from construction activities.  
 There is a Minor adverse effect from the potential for construction activities to spread invasive species. 
Construction of the Electrical Connection 
 There will be temporary Minor adverse habitat loss to broadleaved woodland and trees.  
 There will be a Minor adverse effect to Amphibians, Reptiles and Bats from construction activities.  
 There will be temporary Minor adverse effects to Breeding Birds from noise and localised night time 
illumination in winter months.   
 There is the potential for Otters to be effected due to construction of the Electrical Connection which is 
within 10 m of several watercourses. This is classified as a Minor adverse effect.  
Operational Phase of the Power Generation Plant 
 Bats and Invertebrates will experience Minor adverse effects from the operation lighting. 
 Reptiles will experience Minor adverse effects from risk of collision from the use of the Access Road by 
operational traffic. 
The residual effects from the construction, decommissioning and operation of the Project are therefore not 
significant. 
Water Quality and

pollutants and sediment loads from movement of materials to the Loughor Estuary, which was considered 
to be Minor adverse.  
Operation of the Power Generation Plant 
Effects from surface water runoff from impermeable areas and disruption of water storage and flow from 
the presence of the Generating Equipment Site on the Afon Llan and its tributaries are predicted to be 
Minor adverse.  
The residual effects from the construction, decommissioning and operation of the Project are therefore not 
significant. 
Geology, Ground 
Conditions and 
Hydrogeology 
Construction and Decommissioning of the Power Generation Plant 
 
The construction of the Power Generation Plant is predicted to have Minor adverse effects to mineral 
resources, structures from stability or ground conditions, land quality, human health and controlled waters. 
Construction of the Gas Connection and Electrical Connection 
 
The construction of the Electrical Connection and Gas Connection are both predicted to have a Minor 
adverse effect on mineral resources for both coal and sand and gravel reserves.  
Operation of the Project 
 
The operational phase is anticipated to have a Minor adverse effect on all receptors from the Power 
Generation Plant, Gas Connection and Electrical Connection, with the exception of Power Generation 
Plant structures which have a Moderate beneficial effect from the stabilisation of ground conditions as 
part of the presence of the Power Generation Plant.  
The residual effects from the construction, decommissioning and operation of the Project are therefore not 
significant with exception to the Moderate beneficial effect from stabilisation. 
Landscape and 
Visual Effects 
Construction and Decommissioning of the Power Generation Plant 
 
Landscape Character  around Project Site is Moderate Adverse 
 
Landscape Character within 5 km study area Minor Adverse 
 
Effects on visual amenity from viewpoints 9, 14, 15, 16 and 17 are Moderate or Major adverse, which is 
significant. All other remaining viewpoints conclude Minor adverse effects or Negligible. 
Construction of the Gas Connection 
 
Construction of the Gas Connection would affect the Public Right of Way, north of Abergelli fach

Residual Effect 
(viewpoint 9), resulting in a Moderate adverse effect. This is considered to be significant, however this 
effect is temporary as the trench would be reinstated post-construction.  
Construction of the Electrical Connection 
 
Construction of the Electrical Connection would not have any significant effects on the landscape and 
visual receptors due to its location beside the Access Road and the temporary trench being reinstated 
after construction.  
Operation of the Power Generation Plant 
 
The effect on Landscape Character around Project Site is Moderate Adverse. 
 
The Power Generation Plant would impact the same five representative viewpoints (viewpoints 9, 14, 15, 
16 and 17) as during construction, with Moderate to Major effect, which are therefore considered 
significant.   
Traffic, Transport, 
and Access 
Construction and Decommissioning of the Power Generation Plant 
 The majority of the transport links within the assessment will experience a Minor adverse effect during the 
peak hour for severance, pedestrian delay, pedestrian, amenity, fear and intimidation.  
 Effects to the footpaths which cross within the Project are considered to be Moderate adverse due to 
effects on the pedestrian and user experience.   
 There is predicted to be an increased delay on the B4489 (south) due to the Power Generation Plant 
which is considered Minor adverse, and a reduced delay on B4489 (north) M4 East Bound and West 
Bound Off-Slip which is considered Minor beneficial.   
Construction of the Gas Connection  
 The construction of the Gas Connection is predicted to cause Minor adverse effects from severance, 
pedestrian delay, pedestrian, amenity, fear and intimidation on the majority of receptors, and Moderate 
adverse effects on footpaths due to temporary closures and pedestrian experience during construction. 
 There is predicted to be an increased delay on the M4 WB Off-Slip and Pant Lasau Road which is 
considered Minor adverse, and a reduced delay on B4489 (north and scouth) M4 East Bound Off-Slip 
which is considered Minor beneficial. 
Construction of the Electrical Connection  
 The effect on footpaths during the construction of the Electrical Connection is expected to be Moderate

 There is predicted to be an increased delay on the M4 WB Off-Slip, A48 and Pant Lasau Road which is 
considered Minor adverse, and a reduced delay on M4 EB and WB Off-Slips which is considered Minor 
beneficial. 
The residual effects from the construction, decommissioning and operation of the Project are therefore not 
significant with exception to the Moderate adverse effect during construction and decommissioning from the 
footpath closure.  
Historic 
Environment 
Operation of the Power Generation Plant 
 It is anticipated that Project may be visible to the Scheduled Ancient Monument (Mynydd Pysodlyn Round 
Barrow) and therefore is considered to have a Minor adverse effect on the basis of its High value

Socio-Economics 
Construction and Decommissioning of the Project  
 The construction of all components of the Project is predicted to have little to no adverse impacts on 
tourism, business, and communities during construction. The National Route 43 is likely to experience 
Minor Adverse effects during construction, and is therefore not significant. 
Operation of the Project 
 During the Operational Phase of all components, the Project is predicted to have little to no adverse

Cumulative Effects 
17.1 
Introduction 
17.1.1 This chapter provides a summary of the likely significant cumulative effects 
associated with the Project, both for intra-project (where a single receptor is 
affected by multiple aspects of a project, worsening the effect) and inter-project 
effects (where effects are exacerbated due to other reasonably foreseeable 
projects either in construction, consented or yet to be built).  
17.1.2 Chapter 4: Approach to Environmental Impact Assessment described the 
processes used to assess cumulative effects in this chapter. This chapter also 
provides the approach to the cumulative effects assessment, which has been 
included within Chapters 6-14 in the individual topic areas. A description of the 
Project is provided in Chapter 3: Project and Site Description,  
17.2 
Summary of Relevant Legislation, Planning Policy and Guidance 
17.2.1 Chapter 2: Regulatory and Policy Background outlines the legislation and 
planning policy associated with the project, and that relevant to cumulative 
assessment is detailed below. 
a) EIA Regulations 
17.2.2 The EIA Regulations require a description of the likely significant effects of the 
Project on the environment, which should cover cumulative effects (Schedule 4, 
Paragraph 20). The inter-relationship of likely significant effects of the Project 
therefore needs to be assessed.  
Overarching National Policy Statement (NPS) for Energy (EN-1) 
17.2.3 The Overarching National Policy Statement for Energy (NPS EN-1) (Ref 17.1) 
states the following in relation to requirements for the assessment of cumulative 
effects: 
Section 4.2.5 - ‘When considering cumulative effects, the Environmental Statement 
(ES) should provide information on how the effects of the applicant’s proposal 
would combine and interact with the effects of other developments (including 
projects for which consent has been sought or granted, as well as those already in 
existence).’   
17.2.4 Inter-relationships between effects are also referred to as follows: 
Section 4.2.6 - ‘The Infrastructure Planning Commission (IPC) [now the Planning 
Inspectorate 
(PINS))] 
should 
consider 
how 
the 
accumulation 
of, 
and 
interrelationship between, effects might affect the environment, economy or 
community as a whole, even though they may be acceptable when considered on 
an individual basis with mitigation measures in place.’

AECOM 
17-3 
 
17.2.5 In considering any proposed development, and in particular when weighing its 
adverse impacts against its benefits, the Secretary of State should take into 
account: 
17.2.6 Section 4.1.3: 'its potential adverse impacts, including any long-term and 
cumulative adverse impacts, as well as any measures to avoid, reduce or 
compensate for any adverse impacts.' 
b) Guidance 
17.2.7 Guidance that is applicable to each specific topic assessment is identified in the 
relevant Chapters (Chapter 6 to 14 of this ES). 
17.2.8 PINS Advice Note Nine: Using the 'Rochdale Envelope' (Ref 17.2) states that: 
 
‘The inter-relationship between aspects of the proposed development should be 
assessed and careful consideration should be given by the developer to explain 
how inter-relationships have been assessed in order to address the environmental 
impacts of the proposal as a whole.’ 
17.2.9 Advice Note Nine provides a definition of cumulative effects which are described as 
considering ‘…other proposed development within the context of the site and any 
other reasonably foreseeable proposals in the vicinity'. 
17.2.10 Advice Note Nine also establishes that ‘other developments’ and more specifically 
‘major developments’ need to be identified to assess the probable significant 
effects against the baseline position. Built and operational developments are 
included in this baseline. The ‘major developments’ that should be considered 
within the cumulative assessment include those that are: 
 Under construction; 
 Permitted application(s), but not yet implemented; 
 Submitted applications(s) not yet determined; 
 Projects on the Planning Inspectorate’s Programme of Projects; 
 Identified in the relevant Development Plan; and 
 Identified in other plans and programmes (as appropriate) which set the 
framework 
for 
future 
development 
consents/approvals, 
where 
such 
development is reasonably likely to come forward. 
17.2.11 This list is also included in the document Planning Act 2008: Guidance on the Pre-
Application Process (Ref. 17.3). This document acknowledges that it is not always 
easy for applicants to assess potential cumulative effects due to the lack of 
information available and that a pragmatic approach should therefore be taken 
when determining what is feasible and reasonable.   
17.2.12 PINS Advice Note Seventeen: Cumulative effects assessment (Ref. 17.4) provides 
advice on a ‘staged process that applicants may wish to adopt in cumulative effects 
assessment for NSIPs'. The four assessment stages comprise:

AECOM 
17-4 
 
1. Establish the NSIP's zone of influence and identify a long list of 'other 
development' which could potentially have effect interactions with the NSIP. 
This long list is presented in Table 4-6 of Chapter 4: Approach to 
Environmental Impact Assessment; 
2. Develop a short list of 'other developments' which could potentially have effect 
interactions with the NSIP. Essentially analysing the ‘long list’ developed in 
stage 1 in more detail in order to include only those developments that have 
potential to give rise to significant cumulative effects by virtue of overlaps in 
temporal 
scope; 
due 
to 
the 
scale 
and 
nature 
of 
the 
‘other 
development’/receiving environment; or any other relevant factors. The projects 
for inclusion in each technical assessment (the ‘short list’) have been noted 
where applicable in the cumulative effects section of Chapters 6 to 14; 
3. Gather available information on the shortlisted developments; and  
4. Assessment of likely significant impacts arising as a result of the NSIP 
cumulatively with the short listed developments identified during stage 2 and 
available information gathered in Stage 3. 
17.2.13 Table 3 of Advice Note Seventeen describes potential schemes for cumulative 
assessment in three tiers and recognises that for each tier, there is a decreasing 
level of detail likely to be available. The three tiers are: 
i. 
Tier 1 
 projects under construction (which are expected to be completed before 
construction of the Project and the effects of those projects are fully 
determined); 
 permitted application(s), whether under the PA 2008 or other regimes, but not 
yet implemented; and 
 submitted application(s) whether under the PA 2008 or other regimes but not 
yet determined; 
ii. Tier 2 
 projects on the Planning Inspectorate’s programme of projects where a scoping 
report has been submitted. 
iii. Tier 3 
 projects on the Planning Inspectorate’s programme of projects where a scoping 
report has not been submitted; 
 Identified in the relevant Development Plan (and emerging Development Plans 
with appropriate weight being given as they move closer to adoption) 
recognising that much information on any relevant proposals would be limited; 
and 
 Identified in other plans and programmes (as appropriate) which set the 
framework 
for 
future 
development 
consents/approvals, 
where 
such 
development is reasonably likely to come forward.

17.3 
Methods 
17.3.1 The methodology for cumulative assessment is outlined in Chapter 4: Approach 
to Environmental Impact Assessment, and summarised below. 
17.3.2 The cumulative effects assessment for the Project follows the guidelines as set by 
the Institute of Environmental Management and Assessment (IEMA) and advice 
from PINS.  
17.3.3 IEMA’s guidelines recognise two major sources of cumulative effects: 
 Intra-project effects – These occur where a single receptor is affected by 
more than one source of effect arising from different aspects of the Project. An 
example of an intra-project effect would be where a local resident is affected by 
dust, noise and traffic disruption during the construction of a scheme, with the 
result being a greater nuisance than each individual effect alone; and 
 Inter-project effects – These effects occur as a result of a number of past, 
present or reasonably foreseeable proposed developments, which individually 
might not be significant, but when considered together could create a 
significant cumulative effect on a shared receptor, and could include 
developments separate from and related to the Project. 
17.4 
Consultation 
17.4.1 Consultation regarding cumulative development undertaken in relation to the 
Project is listed in Table 17-1 below.

17.5 
Intra-project Effects 
17.5.1 For the purpose of this chapter, consideration will be given to the additive or 
amplified effects resulting from environmental effects on ‘shared receptors’ and also 
where sources of effect from different components of the Project may combine to 
be of greater significance than when considered alone. Each of the topic specific 
chapters from Chapter 6 to 14 has outlined the cumulative effects from that specific 
individual topic including the mitigation required. These measures will be 
incorporated in the Outline CEMP in Appendix 3.1 where appropriate or secured via 
specific DCO Requirements.  
17.5.2 As outlined in Chapters 6 to 14, there are unlikely to be any intra-project effects 
from the operation and decommissioning phases of the Project and so these are 
not considered further. 
a) Shared Receptors  
17.5.3 Shared receptors from individual elements of the Project (e.g. construction of 
Power Generation Plant, Gas Connection and Electrical Connection) are likely to 
be limited to nearby residential dwellings.  
17.5.4 Potential effects at these shared receptors may comprise of the following: 
 Noise effects;  
 Views from residential dwellings; 
 Potential effects on waterbodies and water based receptors from increased risk 
of sediment runoff and polluted discharges during the construction phase; 
 Traffic effects from increased vehicle numbers during the construction phase; 
and 
 Production of dust during the construction phase. 
17.5.5 Due to the application of embedded and additional mitigation measures (such as 
the avoidance of habitats, the CEMP and topic specific management plans) which 
ensure that likely significant effects on shared receptors are unlikely, or the 
absence of any effects on shared receptors, the following topics are scoped out 
from the intra-cumulative assessment:  
 Ecology - due to the embedded and additional mitigation, there is unlikely to be 
any cumulative effects from multiple components of the Project working 
simultaneously affecting several species. In addition, the total permanent 
habitat loss will be mitigated by the creation of the Ecological Mitigation Area 
and / or enhancements via the Landscape and Ecology Mitigation Plan (LEMP) 
(Figure 3.6) and Landscape and Ecology Mitigation Strategy (Appendix 3.4)

 Socio-economic - Absence of effects on shared receptors. 
 Historic Environment – Absence of effects on shared receptors.  
 Geology, Ground Conditions and Hydrogeology - Absence of effects on shared 
receptors. 
17.6 
Assessment of Potential Intra-project effects 
17.6.1 Table 17-2 outlines the potential intra-project cumulative effects from the Project. 
As previously described in Chapters 6 to 14, it is considered unlikely that there will 
be any intra-project effects during operation or decommissioning, and so the 
assessment only considers construction stage effects.

Effects 
Comments 
Residential  
Dust, 
Noise, 
Traffic, 
Landscape   
Construction of the whole Project will result in 
construction activity not previously present and 
additional vehicles along access routes. This creates 
an increase in traffic flows for all Project components, 
disruption of views and potential production of noise, 
dust and air pollutants from the Project as a whole 
during the construction period.  
This may have an effect on local communities and 
nearby residential dwellings. As embedded and 
additional mitigation is proposed within the individual 
topic chapters (such as a CTMP and CEMP), this will 
result in a Minor adverse in-combination effect, 
which is not significant 
17.7 
Inter-project Effects 
17.7.1 A review of the planning applications and proposed developments within a 5 km 
study area around the Project was undertaken to scope any other projects that 
were considered to constitute ‘major development’ schemes within the Zone of 
Influence (ZoI) (the study area). A further review was undertaken to determine 
which developments had the potential to result in likely significant cumulative 
effects with the Project within each individual technical chapter.   
17.7.2 Further to liaison with CCS, a “long list” of consented, in construction, or consented 
but not yet implemented developments, in addition to those allocated within the 
Local Development Plan (LDP), was agreed for the 2018 PEIR. The “long list” was 
then reviewed and refined, resulting in the following developments being identified 
as having likely cumulative effects.  
17.7.3 There are no other major developments, Tier 1 or Tier 2 developments or 
applications present within the 5 km study area. There are 22 Tier 3 sites within the 
5km study area which are the proposed strategic sites.

17.7.4 For the ES, the ‘long list’ was updated and agreed with CCS with a cut-off date of 
end February 2018 (to allow assessment and finalisation of the ES). This list is 
presented in Table 4-6 and located in Figure 4.1. 
17.7.5 Sites where there is the potential to have cumulative effects are outlined as follows: 
 The Mynydd Y Gwair windfarm (planning reference 2012/1221) is currently in 
construction and will be operational prior to the commencement of this Project. 
Therefore the potential cumulative effects are restricted to landscape and visual 
during operation of the windfarm. Construction traffic from the Project will not 
have any cumulative effects with operational traffic from the windfarm. It is 
considered that there will be no cumulative effects with the Mynydd y Gwair 
windfarm due to the intervening topography ensuring that there is no 
cumulative visual impact (as shown on the ZTV in Figure 11.8).  
 Proposed sustainable urban village at Felindre and other allocated sites have 
been scoped out of the cumulative assessment as they are aspirational 
development opportunities which are not reasonably foreseeable to assess at 
this stage. Section 3.4.2 of the PINS Advice Note 17 (Ref 17.4) outlines that a 
cumulative assessment should be undertaken on a more qualitative basis if the 
status of knowledge is insufficient. As there are very limited details about the 
scale and nature of the proposed developments on which to form a robust 
basis for assessment, this has been the basis of scoping out these 
developments.  
 The Brynwhilach Solar Park (2014/1022) is already constructed and complete. 
The potential cumulative effects are limited to landscape and visual during the 
operation of both this Solar Park and the Project, and this is discussed within 
paragraphs 12.10.22 to 12.10.32 of Chapter 12: Landscape & Visual.  
 The Felindre Business Park is currently under construction (planning reference 
2006/0773) with a second application (planning reference 2013/1835) approved 
but not yet implemented for the Felindre Park and Share Facility. The potential 
cumulative effects relate principally to traffic and transport on the B4489 during 
the operational phase of the Business Park and construction traffic for the 
Project, and landscape and visual effects, however there are no shared 
receptors. The cumulative effects relating specifically to landscape and visual 
and traffic and transport are discussed within Chapter 12: Landscape & 
Visual and Chapter 13: Traffic, Transport & Access.  
17.7.6 To summarise, the Landscape Character around the Project Site and visual 
amenity viewpoints 9 and 15 are expected to experience cumulative effects during 
the construction phase of the Project due to views containing construction 
equipment, lighting and construction activities. This is expected to result in Minor 
adverse effects, which is not significant. During operation, both developments 
would experience cumulative effects due to changes in landscape character, 
landform and presence. However these are also considered to be Minor adverse, 
and therefore not significant.

17.7.7 The cumulative assessment for the individual Project components/full Project has 
identified that there will be no change in the significance of effects relating to the 
pedestrian experience (severance, pedestrian amenity, pedestrian delay, fear and 
intimidation). The residual cumulative effect will be Minor to Moderate adverse. 
Therefore, no mitigation is considered to be required. 
17.7.8 In respect of driver delay, it has been identified that will be a change in the 
significance of effect, primarily during the AM peak hour. The residual cumulative 
effects will be the same for the individual Project components/full Project. During 
the AM peak hour, the residual cumulative effect will be Minor adverse on the 
B4489 (North), M4 eastbound and westbound off-slips, Pant Lasau Road and the 
A48 (Southwest), and Major adverse on the B4489 (South). During the PM peak 
hour, the residual cumulative effect will be Minor adverse on the A48 (Southeast) 
and Major adverse on Pant Lasau Road. 
17.7.9 As detailed within the cumulative assessment of Chapters 6 to14, no other projects 
were considered to have potential to cause cumulative effects with the Project 
either in terms of shared receptors, shared access routes or simultaneous 
construction or operational phases. Therefore, it is unlikely that there will be any 
inter-project effects from other Projects in Table 4-6 and so effects are considered 
to be not significant. 
17.8 
Summary  
17.8.1 The assessment of intra-effects of the Project on shared receptors has concluded 
that the effects are Minor adverse, and therefore are not significant.   
17.8.2 The assessment of inter-project effects have been described, summarised and 
assessed in this chapter. It is concluded that the cumulative effects on shared 
receptors from individual topics and also cumulatively with the Project and other 
proposed developments are mostly Minor adverse effects, with the exception of 
cumulative effects relating to driver delay as these are considered to be at worse  
Major adverse, which is considered significant. However as these effects are 
temporary during construction, no further mitigation is required, and they do not add 
to the overall significance of the effects of the Project.
