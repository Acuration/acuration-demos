Introduction 
1.1 
Overview 
1.1.1 
This document is the second Preliminary Environmental Information Report ('PEIR') 
for the proposed Abergelli Power Project (hereafter referred to as ‘the Project’) 
described below. This PEIR has been prepared by AECOM on behalf of the 
Applicant, Abergelli Power Limited (APL).  
1.1.2 
The Project is situated on open agricultural land located approximately 2 km north 
of junction 46 of the M4 within the administrative boundary of the City and County 
of Swansea Council (CCS). Figure 1.1 shows the location of the Project 
approximately 1 km southeast of Felindre and 1.4 km north of Llangyfelach. The 
land upon which the Project will be developed, or which is required for construction 
of the Project, is referred to as the ‘Project Site’ (see Figure 1.1). The approximate 
centre of the Project Site lies at grid reference 265284, 201431. The Project Site 
covers an area of up to approximately 30 ha. 
1.2 
The Project 
1.2.1 
The Project is a gas-fired ‘peaking’ plant which is designed to operate when there is 
a surge in demand for electricity associated with a particular stress event (e.g. 
where there is a sudden demand in power required by consumers or a sudden drop 
in power being generated by plants which are constantly operational such as a 
sudden outage).  
1.2.2 
The Project is comprised of the below, and explained in greater detail in Section 
3.4.

part of the DCO Application, APL is 
likely to seek powers of compulsory 
acquisition over the land required 
for the Gas Connection.  
Electrical 
Connection 
This is an underground electrical 
cable to export power from the 
Generating Equipment to the National 
Grid Electricity Transmission System 
(NETS) (see Section 3.6). 
The Electrical Connection will be 
consented 
through 
Permitted 
Development and is not part of the 
DCO 
Application. 
Though 
this 
Project element is not part of the 
DCO Application, APL is likely to 
seek 
powers 
of 
compulsory 
acquisition over the land required 
for the Electrical Connection.  
1.2.3 
The proposed DCO Application will seek consent for all works required for 
construction, use, operation and maintenance of the Power Generation Plant 
(including the Access Road and the Laydown Area, which are integral to the NSIP).  
The Gas Connection and Electrical Connection are considered to be Associated 
Development within the meaning of the Planning Act 2008.  As the Project is a 
generating station in Wales below 350 MW, development consent cannot be 
granted for Associated Development in the DCO1. However, the Gas Connection 
and the Electrical Connection are considered and assessed in this PEIR to provide 
full information on the effects of the Project as a whole. 
1.3 
Abergelli Power Ltd  
1.3.1 
The Applicant is APL, an energy development company established for the Project 
and recently acquired by Drax Group PLC (Drax). 
1.3.2 
Drax is responsible for generating 7% of the UKs electricity, predominantly via Drax 
power station in Selby.  Drax is one of the UK’s largest energy producers and is 
committed to helping to reduce carbon emissions, displacing more coal off the 
system and providing additional system support to plug the gaps created by 
intermittent renewables and boost security of supply.  
1.3.3 
Drax acquired APL from Watt Power Limited (Watt Power) in 2016. Stag Energy 
Development Company Ltd (Stag Energy) previously provided management 
services to Watt Power in relation to APL. Stag Energy continues to provide 
resources to APL through a management services agreement. Stag Energy was 
                                                                                                                     
1 The Secretary of State concluded in the Hirwaun Generating Station Order 2015 that a gas connection and an electrical connection 
were not integral to or part of the actual generating station.  As such the DCO will not seek development consent for the Gas Connection 
or the Electrical Connection, but is likely to seek powers of compulsory acquisition over land required for the Gas Connection and the 
Electrical Connection (which is the approach taken by the Secretary of State in making the Hirwaun order).

founded in 2002 and the company draws on a depth of experience within a team 
that has created and delivered over 10,000 MW of power generation and related 
infrastructure projects across the globe, of which 2,500 MW has been delivered in 
the UK. 
1.3.4 
Drax currently has three other power generation projects which have either already 
been granted consent under or are being brought forward through the PA 2008 
process. 
They 
are: 
Progress 
Power 
Ltd 
at 
Eye 
Airfield 
in 
Suffolk 
(www.progresspower.co.uk): Hirwaun Power Ltd at Hirwaun in South Wales 
(www.hirwaunpower.co.uk): and Millbrook Power Ltd in the 'Marston Vale' in 
Bedfordshire (www.millbrookpower.co.uk).  The first two listed projects were 
granted Development Consent in July 2015.  
1.3.5 
APL is committed to the development of assets to support the UK Government’s 
drive to a low carbon economy.  APL recognises the need to balance commercial 
issues with the environmental benefits and concerns relating to energy projects and 
believes this balance can be responsibly delivered. The Project would be designed 
and developed to high quality, safety and environmental standards. 
1.3.6 
Further information on the companies referred to above is provided at 
www.abergellipower.co.uk or www.drax.com. 
1.4 
Purpose of this Preliminary Environmental Information Report 
1.4.1 
The Power Generation Plant constitutes a Nationally Significant Infrastructure 
Project (NSIP) pursuant to the Planning Act 2008 (as amended) (PA 2008) and 
therefore requires development consent under the PA 2008.  
1.4.2 
This PEIR assesses the Project as a whole which includes the Power Generation 
Plant (to be consented under the DCO), the Gas Connection (to be applied for 
under a separate Town & Country Planning Act (TCPA) application), and the 
Electrical Connection (to be constructed under Permitted Development). This PEIR 
documents the preliminary findings in relation to the environmental impacts of the 
Project and is published to inform the statutory consultation on the Project. 
1.4.3 
The Infrastructure Planning (Environmental Impact Assessment) Regulations 2009 
(the ‘EIA Regulations’) require an EIA to be carried out in respect of any 
development listed in Schedule 1 to the EIA Regulations (‘Schedule 1 
development’). The Project is a Schedule 1 development as it is a thermal 
generating station with a heat output2 of 300 MW or more as listed in Schedule 1, 
paragraph 2(1) of the EIA Regulations.   
1.4.4 
The Project falls under the EIA Regulations and not the Infrastructure Planning 
(Environmental Impact Assessment) Regulations 2017 (EIA Regulations 2017). 
This is because a scoping opinion was requested from the Secretary of State under 
the EIA Regulations before the commencement of the EIA Regulations 2017. This 
means that, in accordance with the transitional arrangements at Regulation 37 of 
                                                                                                                     
2 Thermal output is commonly defined as the amount of ‘useable heat’ which is produced as part of the process of the combustion of fuel. 
Only a part of this useable heat can be converted to electrical energy, which is why this is a larger value than electrical output.

the EIA Regulations 2017, the EIA Regulations 2009 will continue to apply to the 
Project. 
1.4.5 
Under Regulation 10(b) of the EIA Regulations, the Applicant is required to set out 
in its Statement of Community Consultation how it intends to publicise and consult 
on preliminary environmental information relating to the Project. Regulation 2 of the 
EIA Regulations then defines preliminary environmental information as being the 
information referred to in Part 1 of Schedule 4 to the EIA Regulations that has been 
compiled by the Applicant and which is reasonably required to assess the 
environmental effects of the development and any associated development. 
1.4.6 
Accordingly, this PEIR has been prepared to present the environmental information 
collected to date and an assessment, on a preliminary basis, of the likely significant 
environmental effects of the Project. 
1.4.7 
This document is the second “PEIR” which has been prepared for the Project. The 
first PEIR was published and consulted upon in 2014 (the “2014 PEIR”) together 
with supporting information and a Non-Technical Summary ("2014 PEIR NTS"). 
This information accompanied APL’s initial phase of statutory consultation ("Phase 
1 Statutory Consultation") with both the local community and prescribed 
consultees. 
1.4.8 
The feedback received relating to the 2014 PEIR has further helped to inform and 
refine the EIA process (including this PEIR) as well as the design and development 
of the Project. 
1.4.9 
Because the DCO Application for the Project was put on hold in 2015, APL is 
undertaking a further round of statutory consultation (‘Phase 2 statutory 
consultation’) and has prepared this PEIR to accompany this further statutory 
consultation. This PEIR reflects (and provides information regarding) updates on 
Project parameters and design evolution, as well as the refined EIA processes.  
1.4.10 This PEIR presents a comprehensive description of the nature, scale, location and 
preliminary information on the likely significant environmental effects of the Project 
in order to inform the statutory consultation. The approach to assessment 
undertaken in this PEIR is described further in Chapter 4: Approach to 
Environmental Impact Assessment.  
1.5 
Application for Development Consent 
1.5.1 
An onshore electricity generating station is considered to be a NSIP under the PA 
2008 if it is in England or Wales and its generating capacity (rated electrical output) 
is more than 50 MW. As the Project is in Wales and will have a rated electrical 
output over 50 MW, it is classified as a NSIP under Section 14(1) (a) and Section 
15(2) of the PA 2008. 
1.5.2 
Under Section 31 of the PA 2008, a Development Consent Order (DCO) is required 
for development that is or forms part of a NSIP and therefore it is necessary that an 
application for a DCO is submitted to the Secretary of State (SoS).

AECOM 
1-7 
 
1.5.3 
A DCO for a NSIP may be granted only if an application is made under Section 37 
of the PA 2008 to the SoS. Section 37 of the PA 2008 (and associated legislation) 
also governs the content of an application for a DCO, including requirements for 
certain accompanying documents. 
1.5.4 
These requirements are specified, in particular, in the Infrastructure Planning 
(Applications: Prescribed Forms and Procedures) Regulations 2014 (as amended) 
(the “APFP Regulations”). The APFP Regulations require that an application for a 
DCO, where applicable, must be accompanied by an ES and any associated 
scoping or screening opinions or directions. A screening opinion was not sought for 
the Project, however a Scoping Opinion, dated 1st August 2014, (Appendix 4.2) 
has been sought from the SoS. A notice of the intention to submit an application for 
Development Consent (Regulation 6 Notification), including an Environmental 
Statement, was submitted to PINS on 8th October 2014.
