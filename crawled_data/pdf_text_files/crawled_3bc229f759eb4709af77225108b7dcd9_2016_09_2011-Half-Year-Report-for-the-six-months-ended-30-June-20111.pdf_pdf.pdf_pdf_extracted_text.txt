business review
chairman’s introDuction
we have seen improved profits for the first six 
months of the year, compared to the same period 
last year, which are a result of a better trading 
environment and some attractive forward sales 
made in previous years. we remain cautious in 
our outlook for the power market and recognise 
that for the rest of the year we will have less 
benefit from strong forward margins secured 
in prior years.
Our operational performance has continued to be 
good following the record-breaking performance 
of last year, and we have seen high output and 
availability supporting both our contracted 
position and our ability to take advantage of 
market opportunities. we have maintained our 
tight control on costs, which continues to support 
our earnings and assist in protecting our business 
in the current economic environment.
As a result of our overall performance during the 
first half of 2011, and in line with our dividend policy, 
i am able to confirm that in October shareholders 
will receive an interim ordinary dividend of 
16.0 pence per share, equivalent to approximately 
£58 million.
it is always pleasing to report on progress made 
in reducing our carbon footprint, which is now well 
embedded in and central to our business strategy. 
with just three low pressure turbine modules to 
be replaced next year, we are now nearing the 
completion of the largest steam turbine 
modernisation programme in uK history, which 
brings with it a carbon dioxide (“CO2”) emissions 
saving of one million tonnes a year.
The key strand of our carbon abatement work 
focuses on biomass. we continue to believe that 
generating electricity from sustainable biomass 
has considerable potential and that it should have 
an important role as a low carbon, cost effective, 
reliable and flexible renewable technology in the 
future energy mix of the uK. 
As reported at the time of our preliminary results, 
our plans to expand our biomass operations are 
wholly dependent on the regulatory framework 
and level of support, and during the year we have 
continued to work with the Government to advance 
the case for biomass. we will maintain our 
engagement with the Government throughout 
the remainder of the year as we look to secure 
an appropriate level of support. 
Finally, my thanks go to all Group staff for their 
commitment to the business throughout the first 
six months of the year.

introduction
we entered 2011 with strong forward sales, a 
significant proportion of which were executed 
on more attractive terms than could have been 
captured during the first six months of the year. 
Our contracted position combined with 
improvements in trading conditions and good 
operational and cost performance have led to 
increased profits for the first half of the year 
compared to the first half of 2010.
in April, we were delighted to reach an 
agreement with HM revenue & Customs (“HMrC”) 
on the long-standing and complex matter of the 
Group’s eurobond financing structure, which 
will result in the release of £180 million cash tax 
relief for the business over the coming years, a 
substantial proportion of which is already available 
to the business. The cash will form an integral part 
of the capital required for our biomass strategy, 
should the Government deliver an appropriate 
regulatory framework to incentivise further 
significant investment in electricity generation 
from biomass.
The refinancing of our letter of credit, working 
capital and term loan facilities, which were due 
to mature in December 2012, was completed 
in July. Our term loan was repaid in full out of 
cash on hand and a new revolving credit facility, 
which can be used for letters of credit and 
working capital purposes, will mature at the 
end of April 2014. subsequent to the refinancing, 
standard & Poor’s confirmed that the new facility 
is investment grade.
Our dialogue with the Government over the future 
support levels for biomass technologies and the 
market reform agenda has continued apace. 
Positive progress in both these areas is critical 
if we are to deliver value both to our shareholders 
and the uK as we transform from a reliable, 
flexible and cost effective high carbon generator 
to a reliable, flexible and cost effective low 
carbon generator.

in July, the Government published its electricity 
Market reform white Paper setting out key 
measures to transform the market and attract 
the investment necessary to secure a new 
generation of power sources. Alongside the 
white Paper, the renewables roadmap was 
published identifying eight technologies offering 
either the greatest potential to meet the 2020 
renewables target in a cost effective and 
sustainable way, or great potential for the 
decades that follow. we were delighted to see 
biomass named as one of the leading contributors, 
very much in line with the potential we have 
long identified and advocated. 
strategy
Our vision for Drax is to be a bold, customer 
orientated power generation and retail business, 
driven by biomass innovation. we have two key 
strategic initiatives to enable us to achieve our 
vision, namely, our project to convert Drax Power 
station into a predominantly biomass-fired 
generating asset, subject to securing the 
necessary regulatory support, and our 
programme for the expansion of our retail 
business, Haven Power Limited (“Haven Power”).
Commodity markets
since February, we have experienced some 
improvement in near-term and forward commodity 
market margins for coal-fired generators, 
driven largely by increasing gas prices. in the 
longer term we see conflicting tensions through 
the introduction of the carbon price support 
mechanism from April 2013, which is likely to erode 
our competitive position in the market. The dark 
green spreads (the difference between power price 
and the cost of coal and carbon) available to us 
in the traded markets are good in the near-term, 
but there remains little visibility beyond 2013.
Operations
we have enjoyed good operational performance 
at Drax Power station during the first half of the 
year. Our safety statistics continue to be industry-
leading, and the periods when we were unable 
to generate, referred to as forced or unplanned 
outages, are in line with our long-term target.
The single unit outage for 2011 was completed 
in very good time, and especially so given the 
complexity of some of the renewal work 
undertaken during the planned downtime. 
The low pressure and high pressure turbine 
modules of five of our six generating units have 
now been replaced and are operating as expected. 
with only three low pressure turbine modules to 
be replaced during the first of next year’s two unit 
outages we are nearing completion of the project, 
which commenced in 2007. On completion, the 
improved overall efficiency of the power station 
will lead to a reduction in CO2 emissions of one 
million tonnes a year. 
Our biomass co-firing facility, albeit subject to the 
economic constraints of the current regulatory 
regime, is operating well, and during the first six 
months of 2011 we burnt over 600,000 tonnes 
of sustainable biomass. in addition to burning 
biomass, we made further progress, and continued 
to derive benefit, through burning alternative, 
economically advantageous fuels.
we are furthering our work on the options available 
to us for compliance with the more stringent 
emissions standards of the industrial emissions 
Directive from 2016. The fuel mix, and so the level 
of biomass co-firing, is a key factor in determining 
the optimal solution for compliance.
Downstream, i am pleased to report that our 
retail business, Haven Power, is meeting its growth 
expectations. The substantial iT systems project, 
which supports the growth strategy, is progressing 
to time and budget. Haven Power continues to 
provide us with a valuable, credit efficient alternative 
to trading through the wholesale market.

expanding our biomass operations
we announced at the time of our preliminary 
results that we stand ready to expand our biomass 
operations, should the Government deliver an 
appropriate regulatory framework to incentivise 
further significant investment in electricity 
generation from biomass. in preparation, we have 
continued our research and development work 
around increasing the level of biomass burnt 
at Drax Power station.
The combustion trials are progressing well with 
a wide variety of sustainable biomass materials 
being tested at different throughputs and under 
varying operating conditions. Although the 
evaluation of these trials is ongoing, all the 
indications are that we will be able to co-fire 
significant volumes of biomass in our existing 
boilers and move towards our vision of becoming 
a generation business fuelled predominantly 
by biomass. 
we have progressed, where possible, our work 
with siemens Project ventures on our dedicated 
biomass developments. However, we have been 
unable to make any significant advancement due 
to the lack of clarity surrounding the future level 
of support available for dedicated biomass plants. 
Much progress has been made on biomass 
sourcing. All our biomass is procured against 
our own industry-leading, robust sustainability 
criteria, which includes greenhouse gas emission 
reduction requirements, and habitats and 
biodiversity protection, as well as socio-economic 
considerations in the source areas. A programme 
of independent audits ensures all our suppliers 
comply with our sustainability criteria.
we firmly believe that robust, mandatory 
sustainability criteria are vital to maintain and 
enhance public acceptance, and ensure that 
sustainable practices are implemented. 
Assessment of the full life cycle carbon footprint 
of biomass, that is, from field to furnace, is now well 
developed, especially in the uK where a mandatory 
life cycle standard comes into effect in 2013.
At Drax, we calculate the life cycle carbon footprint 
of all the biomass we procure and we are confident 
that our biomass fuel sourcing strategy will meet 
the mandatory standard. Our calculations show 
that the range of biomass materials we have 
burnt over the last few years has a far lower 
carbon footprint than those of typical gas-fired 
and coal-fired generating plant, being, at worst, 
half that of gas and a quarter that of coal.
Legislative and regulatory framework
electricity market reform White Paper
The content of the white Paper had been well 
trailed ahead of its publication and, therefore, 
held little in the way of surprises. unconventional 
in the sense that there are still many aspects 
subject to further consideration and consultation, 
the white Paper nevertheless confirmed the 
introduction of a Feed-in Tariff with Contracts 
for Difference (“FiT CfD”) approach, as the 
replacement for the renewables Obligation, 
to incentivise investment in new, low carbon 
generation. we believe the FiT CfD provides the 
lowest cost solution for the consumer and the 
necessary stability for investors. we are also 
pleased to see that a wider capacity mechanism 
is to be considered and look forward to engaging 
further with the Government on potential solutions.
Although we welcome the reform process, 
believing that reform of the electricity market 
is essential to creating the right environment 
to stimulate the huge investment necessary to 
provide adequate, affordable and sustainable 
supplies of electricity into the 2020s and beyond, 
we still harbour concerns over the introduction 
of a carbon price floor and an emissions 
Performance standard.
business review
chief executive’s statement
Drax Group plc  |  Half year report 2011
05
we continue to hold the view that the carbon price 
floor will not deliver all that is expected of it, and 
indeed that it may have unintended consequences. 
For example, to encourage investment any 
incentive mechanism must be “bankable”. That is 
not the case for the carbon price floor, which is to 
be set annually and is subject to discretion, both 
of which increase uncertainty for investors. 
The introduction of an emissions Performance 
standard is, we believe, an unnecessary layer of 
additional legislation. existing legislation already 
provides the framework for the agreed eu-wide 
emissions standards for electricity generation 
plant, and further we believe that the planning 
regime is more than capable of ensuring that only 
low emission power plants will be built in future.
renewables roadmap and renewables 
obligation support levels
in July, the Government published its renewables 
roadmap setting out its approach to unlocking the 
uK’s renewables potential. we are encouraged 
by the Government’s recognition that burning 
biomass in place of coal, in facilities like Drax, is 
one of the most cost effective means of producing 
renewable electricity. Further, we agree with the 
Government’s estimate that electricity produced 
from sustainable biomass could provide a third or 
more of the required renewable power by 2020. 
Although very much in line with our aim to expand 
our biomass operations, the execution of our plans 
is dependent on there being an appropriate level 
of support under the current renewables incentive 
mechanism. To that end, we await the publication 
of the Government’s consultation on its proposals 
for the support levels under the renewables 
Obligation from April 2013.
Bribery act 2010
Our Company has a commitment to conducting our 
business with honesty, integrity and in accordance 
with applicable laws and regulations, as well as 
in compliance with our internal Code of business 
ethics. Our Code ensures compliance with the 
recently enacted bribery Act 2010 through the 
adoption of a zero tolerance policy towards bribery. 
we expect those we do business with to have 
equivalent standards in place in relation to their 
dealings with us.
Looking ahead
Dark green spreads have strengthened in the 
near-term markets, but there remains little visibility 
beyond 2013. in the second half of 2011, unlike the 
first half, we will not benefit from the same level 
of enhanced margins from forward sales made in 
prior years. Therefore, underlying profitability will 
be lower in 2011 compared to 2010, as recognised 
by the markets. 
Our dialogue with the Government will continue 
over the remainder of this year with the same 
intensity as in the first half. The right regulatory 
framework and an appropriate level of support 
are essential for the transformation of Drax into 
a generation business fuelled predominantly by 
biomass. As a biomass-dominated business Drax 
will become a cost effective, low carbon electricity 
generator, whilst continuing to contribute to the 
uK’s security of supply through maintaining both 
reliability and flexibility in electricity production. 
we firmly believe that through this transformation 
of Drax the uK will not only secure large volumes 
of cost effective renewable generation for the 
consumer, but will also increase significantly its 
ability to meet its 2020 climate change targets.

our key Priorities
To achieve our overriding objective to maximise the 
value of the Drax business and our vision to be a bold, 
customer orientated power generation and retail 
business, driven by biomass innovation, our efforts 
are focused on six key priorities. This spread gives the 
highlights of the first half of 2011 against the relevant 
key priorities.
key priority:
maintain 
oPerationaL 
exceLLence
we have maintained our world class standards of safety 
and availability during the first half of 2011, which have 
helped to underpin our improved profitability for the 
period. Our forced outage rate is in line with our long-term 
target, and our availability at 86% and load factor at 80% 
demonstrate well the competitiveness of Drax Power 
station in the market.
key priority:
DeveLoP 
our Biomass 
oPerations
we stand ready to expand our biomass operations, 
should the Government deliver an appropriate regulatory 
framework. in preparation we have successfully continued 
our r&D work and trials indicate that we will be able 
to co-fire significant volumes of biomass in our existing 
boilers. Much progress has been made on biomass 
sourcing, with all our biomass compliant with our  
industry-leading sustainability criteria.
key priority:
GroW our retaiL 
customer Base
The growth and development of our retail business, 
Haven Power, is on track and is supported by good 
progress in setting up the business processes and 
systems to handle an increasing volume of sales. 
During the first half of 2011, sales were double those 
for the same period in 2010. now accounting for 13% 
of our forward contracted power sales, compared with 
6% a year ago, Haven Power is proving its value as an 
alternative to trading through the wholesale market.
Drax Group plc  |  Half year report 2011
07
key priority:
DeLiver carBon 
aBatement
The low pressure and high pressure turbine modules of 
five of our six generating units have now been upgraded 
and are meeting operational expectations. On completion 
next year, the project will save CO2 emissions of one million 
tonnes a year. Our biomass co-firing facility is operating 
well and during the first six months of the year we 
burnt over 600,000 tonnes of sustainable biomass. 
when running at full capacity, a saving of 2.5 million 
tonnes of CO2 will be possible each year.
key priority:
infLuence 
the reGuLatory 
frameWork
we have continued to work with the Government to advance the 
case for electricity generation from biomass. in its renewables 
roadmap, the Government identified biomass as one of eight key 
renewable technologies offering either the potential to meet the 
2020 renewables target, or great potential for the decades that 
follow. we will maintain our dialogue with the Government during 
the critical second half of the year as we look to secure an appropriate 
level of support under the current review for renewables. 
key priority:
maintain an 
oPtimaL suPPortinG 
caPitaL structure
we maintain a capital structure which supports our business model 
and is resilient in the market arrangements which govern the way 
we trade in commodity markets. Looking forward, if we secure an 
appropriate level of support, we may need to adapt our capital 
structure to support our biomass strategy. successful resolution of 
the eurobond tax position and the refinancing of our debt facilities 
during the first half of 2011 have strengthened our balance sheet, 
providing a strong foundation to begin that process.

introduction
ebiTDA was £190 million for the six months ended 
30 June 2011 compared to £184 million for the six 
months ended 30 June 2010. we benefited from 
our forward hedged position, and also from a 
general improvement in the trading environment. 
improved profitability was supported by continued 
good operational performance, which we achieved 
whilst maintaining careful control over the 
underlying cost base of the business. 
Our retail business, Haven Power, is meeting our 
growth expectations with sales of 1.4Twh in the 
six months to 30 June 2011 compared to 0.6Twh 
during the same period 2010.
in April, we were pleased to report that we 
had reached agreement with HMrC over the 
eurobond tax position, resulting in cash tax relief 
of £180 million. This has enabled us to release 
£135 million of previously ring fenced cash to 
the business as at 30 June 2011, with a further 
£45 million to follow over the coming years as 
we utilise the remaining losses. 
in July, we completed the refinancing of our letter 
of credit, working capital and term loan facilities, 
which were due to mature in December 2012. 
These facilities were replaced by a £310 million 
revolving credit facility, maturing in April 2014, 
with the term loan repaid in full out of cash on hand.
The board has resolved to pay an interim dividend 
for 2011 of 16.0 pence per share (£58 million) for 
the six months ended 30 June 2011, compared to 
14.1 pence per share (£51 million) for the six months 
ended 30 June 2010. 
This review provides further explanation and 
commentary in relation to our principal performance 
indicators and the results for the half year. 
Drax Group plc  |  Half year report 2011

oPerationaL anD financiaL Performance
revenue
Total revenue for the six months ended 30 June 
2011 was £866 million compared to £781 million 
in 2010. Total revenue in 2011 includes power sales 
of £733 million (2010: £712 million), retail sales of 
£115 million (2010: £49 million) and other income 
of £18 million (2010: £20 million). 
Higher power sales reflect both an increase 
in the average achieved price of electricity 
to £55.3 per Mwh in the six months ended 
30 June 2011 compared to £50.6 per Mwh in 
2010 and an increase in net power sold from 
12.7Twh in 2010 to 13.1Twh this year.
Our average achieved price of electricity reflects 
our contracted position, as well as higher power 
prices during the first six months of the year. 
The gas market continues to be the dominant 
factor in determining uK power prices, with 
increases in 2011 resulting from Japanese demand 
and uncertainty of supply caused by the unrest 
in north Africa and the Middle east. 
Higher power prices have improved the margins 
available to coal-fired generators during the 
first six months of the year, which together with 
our good availability and efficiency advantage, 
resulted in an increase in net power sold. 
retail sales volumes have increased from 0.6Twh 
in the six months to 30 June 2010 to 1.4Twh in the 
six months to 30 June 2011. This largely reflects 
planned growth in Haven Power’s industrial and 
commercial (“i&C”) customer base from 0.1Twh 
at 30 June 2010 to 0.7Twh at 30 June 2011, along 
with continued growth in our sales to the small 
and medium enterprise (“sMe”) market. 
in addition to power and retail sales, total revenue 
also includes income from the provision of ancillary 
services, the sale of by-products (ash and gypsum), 
and the sale of rOCs and LeCs. in the six months 
ended 30 June 2011 these revenues were 
£18 million compared to £20 million in 2010.
fuel costs (coal and other fuels)
Fuel costs in respect of generation during the six 
months ended 30 June 2011 were £446 million, 
compared to £382 million in 2010. The increase 
was due to a rise in the average cost of fuel per 
Mwh and higher generation. 
we burnt approximately 4.6 million tonnes of coal 
in both the six months ended 30 June 2011 and 
30 June 2010. This coal was purchased from a 
variety of domestic and international sources 
under either fixed or variable priced contracts 
with different maturities. 
in 2011, we also burnt 0.6 million tonnes of biomass 
(2010: 0.3 million tonnes) and 0.3 million tonnes of 
pond fines (2010: 0.1 million tonnes). Pond fines are 
a coal mining residue, which trades at a significant 
discount to coal, and requires specific blending 
and handling techniques to burn in large volumes. 
we have developed these techniques at Drax over 
the last two years. 
Coal comprised around 88% of total fuel burnt 
(by energy content) in the six months ended 
30 June 2011 compared to 89% in 2010. biomass 
comprised 8% of total fuel burnt in 2011 compared 
to 5% in 2010. The increase in biomass burn is 
the result of a full six months of operation of our 
co-firing facility, which was commissioned in the 
summer of 2010.
Our average cost of fuel per Mwh (excluding 
CO2 emissions allowances) was £29.8 for the 
six months ended 30 June 2011, compared to 
£24.7 in 2010. The increase in average fuel prices 
was a function of the timing of purchases under 
domestic and international contracts in the 
forward and near-term markets, of commodity 
price movements and of fuel mix, with biomass 
typically at two to three times the cost of coal. 
Coal prices began to trend upwards towards 
the end of last year, when severe weather in a 
number of regions across the world resulted in 
supply constraints. 
Drax Group plc  |  Half year report 2011

fuel costs (co2 emissions allowances)
For Phase ii of the eu eTs (2008–2012), 
Drax has an allocation of 9.5 million tonnes of 
CO2 emissions allowances per annum under the 
uK nAP. we purchase CO2 emissions allowances 
under fixed price contracts with different 
maturity dates from a variety of domestic 
and international sources.
Our CO2 emissions allowances requirement for 
the six months ended 30 June 2011, including 
those allocated under the uK nAP, was 
approximately 10.6 million tonnes compared 
to approximately 10.8 million tonnes in 2010, 
as a result of higher biomass burn and plant 
efficiency improvements.
The average price expensed for purchased 
CO2 emissions allowances during the six months 
ended 30 June 2011 was £13.0 per tonne 
compared to £12.4 per tonne in 2010, reflecting 
the timing of purchases under fixed price 
contracts in the forward and near-term markets. 
Carbon prices rose slightly during the second 
half of 2010 and continued to trade in a fairly 
narrow range early in 2011, before moving 
upwards in the immediate aftermath of the 
Japanese earthquake. subsequently, there has 
been a significant fall in the price of carbon since 
mid June, driven by a strong supply and low 
demand outlook. 
cost of power purchases
we purchase power in the market when the cost 
of power in the market is below our marginal 
cost of production in respect of power previously 
contracted for generation and delivery by us, and 
to cover any shortfall in generation. in addition, 
Haven Power purchases power in the wholesale 
market for delivery to its retail customers. For the 
six months ended 30 June 2011, the net cost of 
purchased power was £78 million compared to 
£94 million incurred in 2010. Haven Power’s cost 
of power purchases amounted to £69 million for 
the first half of 2011, compared to £30 million 
for the first half of 2010, including the cost of 
power purchased directly from Drax. 
Grid charges
Grid charges for the six months ended 30 June 
2011 were £50 million compared to £35 million 
in 2010. Grid charges include costs of £24 million 
incurred at Haven Power (2010: £10 million). 
The increase in grid charges at Haven Power 
is a function of the increased sales volume 
experienced in the six months to 30 June 2011, 
compared to last year. 
As a result of these factors, gross profit for the 
six months ended 30 June 2011 was £281 million 
compared to £265 million in 2010.
operating and administrative expenses
Other operating and administrative expenses 
before depreciation and amortisation were 
£91 million for the six months ended 30 June 2011 
compared to £81 million in 2010. we continue 
to carefully control our cost base, with most of 
the increase (£8 million) related to investment 
in growth (biomass research and development 
and Haven Power). These costs include £9 million 
incurred at Haven Power, compared to £8 million 
in 2010.
ebiTDA for the six months ended 30 June 2011 
was therefore £190 million compared to 
£184 million in 2010.
Depreciation and amortisation was £29 million for 
the six months ended 30 June 2011 and £25 million 
for the six months ended 30 June 2010, with 
the increase arising following a full six months 
depreciation of the co-firing facility in 2011.

unrealised gains and losses on 
derivative contracts
The Group recognises unrealised gains and losses 
on forward contracts which meet the definition of 
derivatives under iFrss. where possible, we take 
the own use exemption for derivative contracts 
entered into and held for our own purchase, sale 
or usage requirements, including forward domestic 
coal contracts. As such, the net unrealised gains 
and losses recognised in the balance sheet 
principally relate to the mark-to-market positions 
on our forward contracts for power yet to be 
delivered, net of mark-to-market positions on 
financial coal and foreign exchange contracts. 
The following table describes the movements in 
unrealised gains and losses and where they are 
recorded in our financial statements.

During the first half of 2010, power prices 
increased such that by 30 June the difference 
between power that had been contracted but not 
yet delivered and the market price had narrowed 
considerably since 31 December 2009, reducing 
the unrealised gain in the balance sheet from 
£234 million to £56 million.
Power prices continued to increase in the second 
half of 2010, thereby reducing the unrealised gain 
further. in addition, following a period of coal price 
stability during the first half of 2010, prices 
increased significantly in the final months of the 
year, driving an increase in the unrealised losses 
on our financial coal contracts which expose us 
to floating prices. Together these factors resulted 
in an unrealised loss in the balance sheet of 
£61 million at 31 December 2010. 
During 2011, power prices have risen further, 
eroding the difference between contract and 
market price, and driving an increase in the net 
unrealised loss in the balance sheet to £75 million 
at 30 June 2011. 
The unrealised gains recognised in the income 
statement of £25 million for the six months ended 
30 June 2011 and unrealised losses of £12 million 
for the six months ended 30 June 2010 arise from 
mark-to-market movements on our derivative 
contracts which do not qualify for hedge 
accounting; largely financial coal and foreign 
exchange contracts. 
Mark-to-market movements on most of our 
derivative contracts considered to be effective 
accounting hedges, have been recognised through 
the hedge reserve, a component of shareholders’ 
equity in the balance sheet. Movements in 
unrealised gains and losses recognised in the 
hedge reserve are mainly the result of unwinding 
mark-to-market positions relating to power 
delivered during a reporting period, and the 
recording of mark-to-market positions on power 
yet to be delivered at the end of that period. The 
net unrealised loss recognised through the hedge 
reserve in the six months ended 30 June 2011 was 
£39 million, compared to £166 million at 30 June 
2010. The net unrealised loss in 2010 arose largely 
as a result of a significant increase in power prices 
over the first six months of the year. Although 
power prices have risen during the first six months 
of 2011, the differential between contract and 
market price is far lower than in 2010, driving a 
smaller unrealised loss in 2011. 
Drax Group plc  |  Half year report 2011

in considering mark-to-market movements, it is 
important to recognise that profitability is driven 
by our strategy to deliver market level dark green 
spreads, not by the absolute price of electricity 
at any given date.
After allowing for unrealised gains and losses 
on derivative contracts, operating profit for the 
six months ended 30 June 2011 was £187 million 
compared to £146 million in 2010.
interest
net finance costs for the six months ended 
30 June 2011 were £18 million compared to 
£14 million in 2010. The unwind of deferred finance 
costs in relation to our previous bank facilities 
has been accelerated to reflect their reduced 
revised term following the refinancing (see Capital 
resources and refinancing). This resulted in a 
one-time interest charge of £5 million in the six 
month period to 30 June 2011. 
tax
The tax charge before exceptional items for the 
six months ended 30 June 2011 was £35 million 
(an effective rate of 21%), compared to £38 million 
in 2010 (an effective rate of 29%). Tax for 2011 
includes the impact of the reduction in the 
corporation tax rate from April 2011 on current 
and deferred tax liabilities. 
under the Group’s previous financing structure, 
a subsidiary company was partially funded by 
a eurobond payable to another Group company, 
which was unwound in 2008, potentially 
accelerating additional tax losses with a cash tax 
benefit of up to £220 million. The Group began 
utilising these potential losses in 2008, with cash 
saved notionally ring fenced, and no benefit 
recognised in the income statement prior to 
agreement with HMrC. by 30 June 2011 the Group 
had saved cash taxes of approximately £135 million 
(£117 million at 31 December 2010). 
in April 2011, we reached agreement with HMrC 
over the eurobond tax position which will result in 
the release of £180 million cash tax relief. This has 
enabled us to release the £135 million of cash saved 
to date to the business, and will enable us to release 
in the region of a further £45 million over the 
coming years as we utilise the remaining losses. 
The exceptional tax credit of £198 million includes 
full recognition of the eurobond settlement of 
£180 million and a further £18 million in relation 
to other legacy issues, being the release of historic 
tax provisions no longer required following 
settlement of these issues. 
Profit for the period and earnings per share
As a result of the above factors, profit 
attributable to equity shareholders for the six 
months ended 30 June 2011 was £332 million, 
compared to £94 million in 2010, and basic 
and diluted earnings per share were 91 pence 
compared to 26 pence in 2010.
underlying profit attributable to equity 
shareholders (that is profit excluding the after tax 
impact of unrealised gains and losses on derivative 
contracts and exceptional items) was £117 million 
for the six months ended 30 June 2011 compared 
to £103 million in 2010. underlying basic and 
diluted earnings per share were 32 pence in 2011 
compared to 28 pence in 2010.

notes:
(1) The forced outage rate is expressed as a percentage of planned capacity 
available (that is, it includes a reduction for planned losses). The planned 
outage rate is expressed as a percentage of registered capacity. Accordingly, 
the aggregation of the forced outage rate and planned outage rate will not 
equate to the total outage rate. 
The load factor for the six months ended 30 June 
2011 was 80% compared to 77% in 2010, reflecting 
an increase in electrical output (net sales) to 
13.1Twh in 2011 compared with 12.7Twh in 2010. 
we continue to demonstrate our leadership 
position in the coal-fired generation sector with 
plant availability of 86% for the six months ended 
30 June 2011 compared to 90% in 2010. The plant 
despatch dynamics described in revenue above 
drove our load factor to 80% for the period, which 
was significantly higher than the average for the 
rest of the fossil fuel fleet.
The forced outage rate and winter forced outage 
rate for the six months ended 30 June 2011 were 
4.2% and 3.7% respectively, compared to 2.7% 
and 2.4% in 2010. The 2011 forced outage rate is 
in line with our long-term target of 5%.
The planned outage rate achieved for the six 
months ended 30 June 2011 was 9.8% compared 
to 8.1% in 2010. Our maintenance regime includes 
a major planned outage for each of our six units 
once every four years. Consequently, there is an 
irregular pattern to planned outages and 
associated expenditure, since in two of the four 
years two units will each undergo a major planned 
outage. we had only one unit undergoing a major 
planned outage in both 2010 and 2011. 
health and safety
Our lost time injury rate was 0.05 for the six 
months ended 30 June 2011 compared to 0.09 
in 2010. Our safety record is industry-leading, 
and we continue to work hard on our commitment 
to deliver a positive health and safety culture. 
Liquidity and capital resources
net cash including short-term investments was 
£198 million at 30 June 2011 compared to 
£204 million at 31 December 2010 and £71 million

net of overdrafts were £300 million as at 30 June 
2011 compared to £331 million at 31 December 2010 
and £229 million at 30 June 2010. An analysis of

Cash generated from operations was £131 million 
in the six months ended 30 June 2011 compared 
to £240 million in 2010, reflecting an increase 
of £6 million in ebiTDA as described above, and 
a working capital and intangible asset outflow 
of £58 million in 2011 compared to an inflow of 
£55 million in 2010.
The working capital and intangible asset outflow 
of £58 million in 2011 was driven by an increase 
in coal stocks of 0.4 million tonnes over the first 
six months, to meet forecast generation for the 
second half of the year, along with an increase 
in rOCs held for sale. The working capital inflow 
in 2010 reflected a reduction in coal stocks of 
0.6 million tonnes, with high coal stocks at the 
start of 2010, and increased generation following 
unseasonably cold weather during the first 
quarter of last year. 
net income taxes paid were £42 million in the 
six months ended 30 June 2011 compared to 
£29 million in 2010. 2011 payments include 
settlement of the 2010 liability. 
net cash used in investing activities includes 
payments in respect of capital expenditure of 
£14 million in the six months ended 30 June 2011 
and £39 million in 2010 (see Capital expenditure). 
2011 includes an increase of £50 million in 
short-term investments compared to a 
repayment of £25 million in 2010, comprising 
cash deposits with a maturity of more than 
three months at inception. 
net cash used in financing activities was £99 million 
in the six months ended 30 June 2011 compared to 
£68 million in 2010. The 2011 amount includes 
equity dividends paid of £65 million and term loan 
repayments of £34 million. The 2010 amounts 
included equity dividends paid of £35 million and 
term loan repayments of £33 million (see Capital 
resources and refinancing).
The decrease in cash and cash equivalents was 
therefore £81 million in the six months ended 
30 June 2011, compared to an increase of 
£119 million in 2010. Drax’s policy is to invest 
available cash in short-term bank, building society 
or other low risk deposits.
capital resources and refinancing
Following scheduled debt repayments of 
£34 million during the period, senior secured 
debt was £101 million at 30 June 2011.
in July 2011, we completed the refinancing of 
our letter of credit, working capital and term loan 
facilities, which were due to mature in December 
2012. These facilities were replaced with a 
£310 million revolving credit facility which matures 
in April 2014, and which can be used for both 
letters of credit and working capital purposes. 
The margin over LibOr on our new facility has 
reduced from 3.5% to 2%. The existing term 
loan was repaid in full out of cash on hand. 
The unwind of deferred finance costs in relation to 
the previous banking facilities has been accelerated 
to reflect their reduced term resulting in a one-time 
interest charge of £5 million in the six months 
ended 30 June 2011. 
Going concern
we acknowledge guidance on going concern 
for companies preparing financial statements. 
we have significant headroom in our new banking 
facilities, a recent history of cash generation and 
good visibility in medium-term forecasts, due to 
our progressive hedging strategy. The directors 
are therefore satisfied that the Group has 
sufficient resources to continue in operation 
for the foreseeable future, a period of not less 
than 12 months from the date of this report. 
Accordingly, they continue to adopt the going 
concern basis in preparing the Half year report. 
seasonality of borrowing
Our business is seasonal with higher electricity 
prices and despatch in the winter period and 
lower despatch in the summer months, when 
prices are lower and plant availability is affected 
by planned outages.
Accordingly, cash flow during the summer months 
is materially reduced due to the combined effect 
of lower prices and output, while maintenance 
expenditures are increased during this period 
due to major planned outages. Our previous 
£100 million revolving credit facility was undrawn 
at 30 June 2011. it is envisaged that the new 
revolving credit facility will assist in managing 
the cash low points in the cycle when required.

capital expenditure
Fixed asset additions were £16 million in the 
six months ended 30 June 2011 compared to 
£32 million in 2010. This includes expenditure 
of £6 million in 2011 (£7 million in 2010) on the 
turbine upgrade. On completing this project next 
year, we will have invested around £100 million 
to upgrade the high pressure and low pressure 
turbine modules on all six generating units to 
improve efficiency. using proven technology we 
expect to achieve an overall baseload efficiency 
(that is, the ratio of energy out to energy in when 
operating at full capacity) approaching 40%. 
This will represent a 5% improvement on 
original baseload efficiency of around 38%. 
when complete, the project is expected to deliver 
annual savings of one million tonnes of CO2 
emissions allowances and approximately half 
a million tonnes of coal.
During this year’s major planned outage we 
successfully completed the turbine module 
upgrades on one of our units. we are now 
delivering tangible benefits in terms of efficiency 
gains and carbon abatement, the latter amounting 
to a saving in CO2 emissions of over 0.8 million 
tonnes per year. The final turbine upgrade will be 
undertaken in 2012. expenditure remains in line 
with budget. 
2010 expenditure included £14 million in relation 
to the biomass co-firing facility, completed in 
summer 2010. 
we continue to evaluate other investment 
opportunities which may result in additional 
capital expenditure. Further investment will be 
required prior to 2016 to meet the requirements 
of the Large Combustion Plant Directive and 
industrial emissions Directive. we are currently 
assessing the most appropriate technology 
to ensure compliance. 
Principal risks and uncertainties
we manage the commercial and operational risks 
faced by the Group in accordance with policies 
approved by the board. we set out in our 2010 
Annual report and accounts (pages 28–29) the 
principal risks and uncertainties that could impact 
performance. These remain unchanged with the 
exception of the tax risk. Following agreement with 
HMrC over the eurobond tax position (see Tax 
above), the risk of additional tax liabilities arising 
in relation to this structure has been eliminated. 
Our remaining principal risks and uncertainties 
are therefore:
 – Commodity market risk
 – Counterparty risk
 – ratings risk
 – environmental and health and safety risk
 – electricity wholesale market risk
 – biomass strategy risk
 – Plant operating risk
 – regulatory and political risk
related parties
we also included details of related party 
transactions in our 2010 Annual report and 
accounts (page 105). On 21 April 2011, Charles berry 
resigned as the Chairman and as a director of eaga 
Limited (formerly eaga plc), upon the completion 
of the acquisition of that company by Carillion plc. 
During the period 1 January to 21 April 2011, 
services purchased from eaga plc totalled 
£2 million.

we continue to follow our stated trading strategy 
of making steady forward power sales with 
corresponding purchases of CO2 emissions 
allowances and fuel purchases. Our aim is to 
deliver market level dark green spreads across 
all traded market periods and, as part of this 
strategy, we retain power to be sold into the

matching CO2 emissions allowances amounting 
in aggregate to approximately 7.2 million tonnes 
in each of 2011 and 2012 and approximately 
2.4 million tonnes in 2013. 
The contracts provide the Group with a series of 
fixed dark green spreads, with the spreads on the 
first contract having been agreed in the first 
quarter of 2006 and with those in the second 
contract having been agreed in October 2009.
Distributions
Distribution policy
The board has previously committed to target a 
pay-out ratio of 50% of underlying earnings (being 
profit attributable to equity shareholders adjusted 
to exclude the after tax impact of unrealised gains 
and losses on derivative contracts and exceptional 
items) in each year. For the half year, underlying 
earnings per share on this basis were 32 pence 
per share. 
Dividends paid
On 21 February 2011, the board resolved, subject 
to approval by shareholders at the Annual General 
Meeting on 13 April 2011, to pay a final dividend 
for the year ended 31 December 2010 of 17.9 pence 
per share (£65 million). The final dividend was 
subsequently paid on 13 May 2011.
Dividends proposed
On 1 August 2011, the board resolved to pay an 
interim dividend for the six months ended 30 June 
2011 of 16.0 pence per share (£58 million), 
representing 50% of underlying earnings for the 
period. The interim dividend will be paid on or 
before 14 October 2011 and shares will be marked 
ex-interim dividend on 28 september 2011.
This Operational and financial performance review 
was approved by the board on 1 August 2011.

24 NOTES TO ThE CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED 
fINANCIAL STATEMENTS
1. General information
Drax Group plc (the “Company”) is incorporated in England and Wales under the Companies Act. 
The Company and its subsidiaries (together the “Group”) operate in the electricity generation and supply 
industry within the UK. The address of the Company’s registered office and principal establishment is 
Drax Power Station, Selby, North Yorkshire YO8 8PH, United Kingdom.
2. Basis of preparation
The condensed consolidated financial statements have been prepared using accounting policies 
consistent with International Financial Reporting Standards (“IFRSs”) and in accordance with IAS 34 
“Interim Financial Reporting”.
The information for the year ended 31 December 2010 does not constitute statutory accounts as defined 
in Section 434 of the Companies Act 2006. A copy of the statutory accounts for that year has been 
delivered to the Registrar of Companies. The auditor’s report on those accounts was not qualified, did 
not draw attention to any matters by way of emphasis and did not contain statements under Section 
498(2) or (3) of the Companies Act 2006.
Management performed a review of the presentation of certain items in the income statement and balance 
sheet in advance of the 2010 year end. Management concluded that ROCs should be separately presented in 
the balance sheet. As Drax increases the amounts of biomass burnt at the power station, the value of ROCs 
in the balance sheet is likely to become more significant. Accordingly £27.8 million has been reclassified from 
“inventories” to “intangible assets – ROCs held for sale” in relation to the 30 June 2010 comparative.
Additionally, management felt that metering charges, broker fees and ROC costs incurred at Haven 
Power should be separately disclosed under “other retail costs” within the income statement in order to 
provide better information to users of the Annual report and accounts and Half year report, as the retail 
business continues to grow. Accordingly £3.9 million of costs included in the cost of power purchases and 
£0.6 million of costs included in other operating and administrative expenses have been reclassified to 
other retail costs in the six months ended 30 June 2010 comparative figures. 
These are presentational changes only and have no net impact on operating profit or net assets for any 
of the financial periods disclosed. 
The condensed consolidated financial statements were approved by the Board on 1 August 2011.
Adoption of new and revised accounting standards
In 2011, a number of new standards and interpretations have become effective as noted in the 2010 
Annual report and accounts (page 79). The adoption of these standards and interpretations has not had 
a material impact on the financial statements of the Group. Since the Annual report and accounts was 
published the following significant new standards and interpretations, which have not been applied in 
these condensed consolidated financial statements, have been issued but are not yet effective:
 – IFRS 10 “Consolidated financial statements” – effective for accounting periods beginning on or after 
1 January 2013.
 – IFRS 11 “Joint arrangements” – effective for accounting periods beginning on or after 1 January 2013.
 – IFRS 12 “Disclosure of interests in other entities” – effective for accounting periods beginning on or 
after 1 January 2013.
 – IFRS 13 “Fair value measurement” – effective for accounting periods beginning on or after 1 January 2013.
The adoption of these standards in future periods is not expected to have a material impact on the 
financial statements of the Group.

3. Significant accounting policies
The accounting policies adopted are consistent with those followed in the preparation of the Group’s 
Annual report and accounts for the year ended 31 December 2010.
4. Segmental reporting
Information reported to the Executive Committee and the Board for the purposes of assessing 
performance and making investment decisions is organised into two operating segments. The Group’s 
operating segments under IFRS 8 are as follows:
 – Generation – the generation of electricity at the Drax Power Station.
 – Retail – the supply of electricity to retail customers in the small and medium enterprise and industrial 
and commercial markets.
As a result of the growth in the retail business, this segment has become more significant to the Group 
during the six months ended 30 June 2011, and therefore the results of this segment are separately 
disclosed from 1 January 2011, along with comparatives for the six months ended 30 June 2010, and 
year ended 31 December 2010.
The Executive Committee and the Board assess the performance of the operating segments based on 
EBITDA, with sales between segments being carried out at arm’s length. Assets and working capital are 
monitored on a Group basis with no separate disclosure of asset by segment made in the management 
accounts and hence no separate asset disclosure is provided in this Half year report.

The accounting policies of the reportable segments are the same as the Group’s accounting policies 
which are described in the Group’s latest Annual report and accounts. All revenue and results arise from 
operations within Great Britain therefore no separate geographical segments are reported. The revenue 
and results of both segments are subject to seasonality as detailed in the “Operational and financial 
performance review – Seasonality of borrowing” section.
Major customers
Total revenue for the six months ended 30 June 2011 includes amounts of £243.9 million, and 
£135.9 million, derived from two customers (2010: £145.0 million, £120.3 million and £74.3 million, 
derived from three customers), each representing 10% or more of the Group’s revenue for the period. 
5. Taxation
The income tax expense reflects the estimated effective tax rate on profit before taxation for the Group 
and the movement in the deferred tax balance in the period, so far as it relates to items recognised in the 
income statement. 
Exceptional items
Under the Group’s previous financing structure, Drax Holdings Limited (a subsidiary company) was 
partially funded by a Eurobond payable to another group company. This Eurobond debt structure 
was unwound in 2008, potentially accelerating additional tax losses with a cash tax benefit of up to 
£220 million. Because of the risks related to the unwind of the Eurobond structure, no benefit was 
recognised in the Group’s financial statements prior to agreement with HMRC.
On 5 April 2011, we reached agreement with HMRC, resulting in the resolution of the Eurobond tax 
position and certain other smaller legacy tax matters. Accordingly, we have recognised an exceptional 
tax credit of £197.9 million in the income statement. This includes a current tax credit of £149.5 million, 
and a deferred tax credit of £48.4 million. 
Changes in the rate of corporation tax
Following the announcement of the 2011 Budget, the Finance (No. 3) Bill 2010–11 (the “Bill”) was presented 
to Parliament on 29 March 2011. The Bill proposed a further reduction in the rate of corporation tax from 
27% to 26% from April 2011, which was passed by resolution with immediate statutory effect. In addition 
the Bill proposed further reductions in the rate of corporation tax from 26% to 23% by 2014–15 which 
had not been substantively enacted at the balance sheet date. Since the period end, only the reduction 
in the corporation tax rate to 25% from April 2012, has been enacted, which would have impacted the 
valuation of the Group’s deferred tax assets and liabilities held at 30 June 2011 by £8 million, had it been 
enacted prior to the period end. It is currently expected that each future Finance Bill enacted will reduce 
the corporation tax rate by 1% until the rate of 23% is reached.

6. Earnings per share
Basic earnings per share is calculated by dividing the earnings attributable to ordinary shareholders by 
the weighted average number of ordinary shares outstanding during the period. In calculating diluted 
earnings per share the weighted average number of ordinary shares outstanding during the period is 
adjusted, when relevant, to take account of share options and contingently issuable shares in relation 
to the Group’s share-based incentive plans. The underlying earnings per share has been calculated 
after excluding the after tax impact of marking-to-market derivative contracts which are not hedged, 
and exceptional items.
Reconciliations of the earnings and weighted average number of shares used in the calculation are set 
out below.

£33.8 million of the term loans were repaid on 30 June 2011. During the previous year, term loan repayments 
of £32.5 million were made on each of 30 June 2010 and 31 December 2010. These repayments were made 
in line with the target repayment profile as a result of the levels of cash available for debt service.
Refinancing 
On 28 July 2011, we completed the refinancing of our letter of credit, working capital and term loan 
facilities, which were due to mature in December 2012. These facilities were replaced with a £310 million 
revolving credit facility which matures in April 2014, which can be used for both letters of credit and 
working capital purposes. The margin over LIBOR on our new facility has reduced from 3.5% to 2%. 
The existing term loan was repaid in full out of cash in hand and we subsequently drew down £10 million 
against the new revolving credit facility. 
The unwind of deferred finance costs in relation to the previous facility has been accelerated, to reflect their 
revised term, resulting in a one-time £5.2 million interest charge in the six month period to 30 June 2011. 
9. Hedge reserve
The Group’s cash flow hedges relate to commodity contracts (principally commitments to sell power), 
forward foreign exchange contracts and interest rate swaps. Amounts are recognised in the hedge 
reserve as the designated contracts are marked-to-market at each period end for the effective portion 
of the hedge, which is generally 100% of the relevant contract. Amounts held within the hedge reserve 
are then released as the related contract matures and the hedged transaction impacts profit or loss. 
For power sales contracts, this is when the underlying power is delivered.
The expected release from equity of post-tax hedging gains and losses is as follows:

32 INDEPENDENT REvIEW REPORT TO DRAX GROUP PLC
We have been engaged by the Company to review the condensed set of financial statements in the 
half-yearly financial report for the six months ended 30 June 2011 which comprises the Condensed 
Consolidated Income Statement, the Condensed Consolidated Statement of Comprehensive Income, 
the Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheet, the Condensed Consolidated Statement of Changes 
in Equity, the Condensed Consolidated Cash Flow Statement and related notes 1 to 10. We have read 
the other information contained in the half-yearly financial report and considered whether it contains 
any apparent misstatements or material inconsistencies with the information in the condensed set 
of financial statements.
This report is made solely to the Company in accordance with International Standard on Review 
Engagements (UK and Ireland) 2410 “Review of Interim Financial Information Performed by the Independent 
Auditor of the Entity” issued by the Auditing Practices Board. Our work has been undertaken so that we 
might state to the Company those matters we are required to state to it in an independent review report and 
for no other purpose. To the fullest extent permitted by law, we do not accept or assume responsibility to 
anyone other than the Company, for our review work, for this report, or for the conclusions we have formed.
Directors’ responsibilities
The half-yearly financial report is the responsibility of, and has been approved by, the directors. 
The directors are responsible for preparing the half-yearly financial report in accordance with 
the Disclosure and Transparency Rules of the United Kingdom’s Financial Services Authority.
As disclosed in note 2, the annual financial statements of the Group are prepared in accordance with 
IFRSs as adopted by the European Union. The condensed set of financial statements included in this 
half-yearly financial report has been prepared in accordance with International Accounting Standard 34, 
“Interim Financial Reporting,” as adopted by the European Union.
Our responsibility
Our responsibility is to express to the Company a conclusion on the condensed set of financial 
statements in the half-yearly financial report based on our review.
Scope of review 
We conducted our review in accordance with International Standard on Review Engagements (UK and 
Ireland) 2410 “Review of Interim Financial Information Performed by the Independent Auditor of the 
Entity” issued by the Auditing Practices Board for use in the United Kingdom. A review of interim 
financial information consists of making inquiries, primarily of persons responsible for financial and 
accounting matters, and applying analytical and other review procedures. A review is substantially less in 
scope than an audit conducted in accordance with International Standards on Auditing (UK and Ireland) 
and consequently does not enable us to obtain assurance that we would become aware of all significant 
matters that might be identified in an audit. Accordingly, we do not express an audit opinion.
Conclusion
Based on our review, nothing has come to our attention that causes us to believe that the condensed set 
of financial statements in the half-yearly financial report for the six months ended 30 June 2011 is not 
prepared, in all material respects, in accordance with International Accounting Standard 34 as adopted 
by the European Union and the Disclosure and Transparency Rules of the United Kingdom’s Financial 
Services Authority.
